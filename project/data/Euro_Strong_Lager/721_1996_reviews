"Just like its name, feels heavy but still is attractive. I would compare it on par with Guinness. Not standing out that much, but not bad. Slightly better described with the word ""a bit better than just fine"""

"This beer tastes nothing like Carlsburg."
""
"Not really my thing, but not that bad either. You could do worse."
"A- cloudy"
""
""
"O- this was actually much more drinkable than I expected, the finish was a little harsh but not as bad as its rating"
""
""
"Overall weak flavor and smell with short thin mouth feel. Price wasn't bad."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not something I would go out of my way to drink again, but it was not at all as bad as I feared after reading some of the reviews here."
""
""
""
"Overall –This brew actually delivered much more then I was expecting form the look or smell.  It was a rather enjoyable brew overall.  While not something all that exceptional, it was both rather refreshing and flavorful.  Not a bad one to at least try."

"O: Luckily got a few non-skunked bottles and I think that made it quite a bit more enjoyable. Not complex by any means, but as a higher abv brew that's meant to taste like a fizzy yellow beer, it's not bad at all. I like to think of this style as the Euro style of American malt liquor. With that outlook, this is actually a half-decent brew. I wouldn't risk multiple purchases just because of the green bottle and high risk of skunkiness, but I have no shame in rating this with a score that is quite a bit higher than average"

"         Overall a 3 for Elephant Beer - Carlsberg Danmark A/S. I won't buy this brew again."
""
""
"Elephant Beer brewed by Carlsberg Denmark A/S with an ABV of 7.2%.  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head.  This brew has a the look of an American Lager.  Keep in mind this brew was pours out of a green bottle. The smell is skunky with some grains and hops. The taste is smooth with some skunkiness. For having an ABV of 7.2% it is really smooth. I'm not big on the taste of this brew.  The mouthfeel is ok but it has some skunkyness.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5.  Not the best but far from the worst. I may by this brew again.  I may buy this brew again. I would like to try this brew in a can."

"Surprisingly nice and smooth"

"Very euro lager... Sweet malt just a touch of hops.. Really hides the higher ABV. Pretty thin but cool and refreshing. Overall not a bad euro lager.. Really makes me think that this is a higher ABV version of Heineken."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice head and crisp mouthfeel, this strong Euro-lager is refreshing on a hot day. The aroma is distinctive, with a toasted biscuit hint. The taste hides the alcohol well, finishing clean. Not the best beer, but not as poor as many of the reviews suggest."

"I really enjoyed the slightly sweet, crisp and moderately dry aftertaste. Taste on the front end...it was okay; nothing to write home about. I've had only a few kolsch beers but this wasn't my favorite. It reminded me of a blended white wine. In one hand, its refreshing on a hot Summer's day. But on the other, you really can't do much or get much out of it. It's obviously supposed to be paired with lighter foods but there's still nothing that I'd pair it with. A couple by the pool wouldn't be bad, though."

"The graininess makes the otherwise crisp and not-quite-smooth feel a little harsher, while alcohol thins the back end."

"This one seems to be fresh and it tastes much better than average Malt Liquors, though a style that is far from my favorite. It did not get repulsive after warming up, norm for the style and most Adjunct Lagers (just as a reference). I actually liked this Imperial Pilsner, I could have a few."
"It's imbalanced and not good. There are much cheaper malt liquors that will do the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Seems like only some of mine were skunked. I took another one out of the fridge tonight, and found it pleasantly unskunky. When it hasn't been ravaged by the light, it's not half bad. It's still pretty generic-tasting and nothing to clamor for, but it's good for what it is. I'll up the taste and overall rating by a little bit."

"This is my First Review on this site,so please Excuse my less then stellar Review style,But I have been a Huge ""Beer Enthusiast"" for over 30 years, so I am no Noob when it comes to the frothy goodness of the wonderful world of Beer & Ales,I Know this does not qualify me as any type of expert in the least,but I do know what I Like..with that said,I Honestly can not understand why ""Carlsburg Elephant"" seems to be slagged and hated on so much,by so many..I mean this is a damn good beer![IMHO] It's Crisp,nice and hoppy & not too bitter,a perfect brew for these Hot Humid days of summer,very refreshing,with a nice finish,perhaps it does have a slight Alcohol taste that lingers a bit too long & a Head that is nothing to brag about,but overall I find it to be a Very Nice Refreshing Brew and quite drinkable,not the horrid stale, skunky swill so many reviewers make it out to be here in these forums,but thats the thing with Beer,what I enjoy and find to be a decent brew,the next guy may very well Hate,anyway my point is do not dismiss this brew if you have not tried it,because IMHO it's well worth checking out for yourself~Cheers."

"O: Imagine Corona with 7.2% alcohol. It's not terrible but I would not buy it again."

"I like bigger lagers and this one is better than most. Nice summer lager, and probably a good winter one too. In either season, dangerous, as it drinks close to a lighter lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aftertaste: There isn't much of an aftertaste here. It does end sweet, and becomes drying as I continue to swallow. My favorite part of this beer is the sweet finish. I just wish it would hang on for a bit longer. For $1.99 a bottle, it is worth every penny for the sweet finish and the high ABV. This is the first and only beer from Carlsberg on the list, too. I am not even sure what else they do… maybe I will look the next time I am at Total Wine. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"The sweetness and sticky texture make this a ""no-go""."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will say I'm disappointed with my purchase. Could have just got some other swill at a cheaper price and would have never known the difference. I will say that the 7.2% is not a lie. After one I could definitely feel it. Would not buy again though."
""
"Overall this is just not my style. I havn't tried many Euro brews of this style, but if this is any indication then i think I will just stick to something else, anything else. Got it as a part of a mix 6 so I didnt waste money on a whole 6 pack. Maybe try this if you like skunky funkiness? Up to you. Drinkable."

"Picture needs to be updated, there is a new green bottle with silver green and gold label. A little cloudy but nice golden yellow color. The Malt taste is clean and smooth with faint hops. The best part is that the Alcohol sneaks in and does the job well. Seems like this beer is underrated here, but honestly it's a good Malt beer IMHO. Having drank 4 of these just now I'm having trouble focusing on this review, so what does that tell you? :)"
""
""
""
"Overall - if I had been given this without knowing what it was, I would have thought this to be some corporate American product. It has some audience and may even be a staple for some, but for my taste it pushes the definition of beer too far in a single dimension."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Green bottles are never the way to go and this proves it. Would I drink it again? Highly unlikely."

"Overall, a nice and sneaky beer, will get you there before you know it."
""

"Mouthfeel is the beer's strong point. I genuinely enjoyed this beer, based on this criteria alone! Crisp, hugely bubbled, and it'll-get-you-drunk. Or, better yet, a good beer for when you're already drunk and not concerned about flavor and for some reason want to get more drunk AND want to look classy by drinking a sexy looking import bottle with a large African mammal on it. So, when you're in that sort of mood, drink the piss outta this one."
"O= This is a bad beer. I'm sure it's trip over seas doesn't help but this beer tastes offensive. It makes me make the face after every sip. Don't waste your money on this one."
""
""
""
"O: Typical Euro lager – skunky and not a whole lot more."
""
""
"O: Another Euro Lager, not bad but only if nothing else is available."
""
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the flavoring. We were not expecting much after that nose, but we found a shocking depth to the malt bill. There was butter and diacetyls, light esters, and nice sweetness. The backing was still full of adjuncts, which ultimately took away from it, but this is not a bad experience on the whole."
""
""
"Overall Impression- I remember having this one @ Growlers Pub in St. Louis but wasn't such a beer advocate at the time so probably chugged it. This one has a very strong profile while being very drinkable. Enjoyed but wouldn't be my typical style I would go to."
""
""
"O: I'm really not into this beer. The best thing it has going for it is its mouthfeel and that really isn't much. I really don't think I'd have this again, period, and am glad I have no more of these. I tried to be as fair as I could by waiting until I had the last one to offer a review and literally, as each beer I consumed it gradually got worse. I think this is not a good beer."
""
""
"Another standard Euro lager- in this case a strong Euro lager- In my experience, that just means a little harsher- and a little worse. This one is no different. Pours golden with a slight head and constant stream of bubbles. Smells harsh- alcoholic and grainy with a harsh bitterness. The taste starts out sweet, then grainy, then hot and harsh with a bit of sour graininess in the end. Not pleasant- made me grimace. If anything, the mouthfeel is even worse- harsh and solvent like. Bleh."
""
""
""
"Overall: a reasonable lager, I had no idea it was so high ABV when I was drinking it. A good sessional, but a bit steep at AU$63 a case (2012) for just a lager (thanks to Australian pricing regulations)."
""
"This very ""malt-liquorish"" brew is pretty nasty. It has a nasty bitternes mixed with the malty taste that is a bit hard to drink. If given a choice of chewing my arm off or drinking a six of these, I'd drink these!"
"I would call it an ""above average"" Lager, although not too far away from average."

"Pours a clear gold with fast acting white foam. Some remains. Depper smell. Malt amongst the adjunct, if that makes any sense. Taste is a richer fuller lager. Firm pils hop with a citrus tang close. Quick finish. Some bitter remains."
""
"This is definitely a beer to at least try. Personally, I am enjoying straight from bottle on my 5th out of 6. The slightly higher alcohol content takes away from the taste, but it's still smooth for a 7.2. It may be a bit pricy for your particular vendor ($10 for a sixer at Gator Beverage in gainesville fl). Overall not bad for a strong ale. Easier to drink than an Heineken in my opinion."

"Carlsberg Elephant is a very clear, very sparkling, light golden beer. It has a thin, white head that vanishes quickly. It has an aroma of light grain, malt extract and skunk. It's medium bodied, pretty smooth and pretty sparkling with a reasonably clean finish. It's quite sweet. It tastes like malt extract and fusel oil with an aftertaste of burnt rubber. This is pretty unpleasant. Is this malt liquor?"

"This is a beer I would not have again. I would accept it if it was on draft to see if there would be a difference."
"Decent smell, I like stronger beers so I was looking forward to it. But after I tasted it I was disappointed. This was not good at all, bad after taste too. I was tasted much smoother beers at much higher alcohol concentration. So overall I see no reason to buy this beer."
""
""
"boozy beer. in the smell, taste, feel, and after effects."
""
""
""
""

"O - not nearly the crisp and light beer that it's brother is."
"O - A better than average lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It exceeded expectations. It's an above average pale lager, but it's not a particularly great beer."
""
""
"Poured a 2"" white head. Clear straw yellow color. Smells moderately skunked and I'd suppose the green glass bottle despite looking cool contributed to that. Everything about this beer up to this point struck me as BMC. But then with the taste it surprised me. It is very sweet, creamy, has malt, an herbal aspect, and a mild hop finish. This is more than your typical BMC."
"Food match: It's almost sweet enough to be a dessert beer, and I'm inclined to suggest a flan of some description, perhaps strawberry [jokes on me - I just did!]."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent. Well balanced. No off characters. Smooth. Easy."
"Feel is a bit below medium with crisp carb felt on the tounge, which stings after a few sips. With that, the alcohol stings and puts tears to my eyes. glad I got another go at this one, but maybe it is time for me to retire it forever."
"D: Low drinkability as I am having it, I think it might be better chilled."
"I know this is not a perfect beer. I, and many other Euro-fans on here enjoy this beer it seems for similar reasons, it reminds of us a time when beer was something new, and was directly tied to locality. To me, this beer is terrific in its unpretentious attitude and overall European confidence."
"Overall, this is drinkable but not a great example of the style. I did appreciate the bottle (green glass with raised Carlsberg, not as currently pictured)."
"-Overall 4.0: Very good beer and worth tracking down. This is almost like a ""dubbel German lager"" in that it tastes like the a condensed version of the best German lager you've ever had. All those flavors are here and intensified. If you like the German lager style, you will really love this beer. Be sure you remember that this is a 7.2% ABV."
"A little surprised at the low scores on this one. But to each his own...."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells heavily of skunk (green bottle?) and some very light grain aromas. Pretty gross. Taste is of sweetened grains and some minor metallic notes. Mouthfeel is a bit flat with a smooth and slightly creamy taste. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer for any style. The skunk smell is very hard to get over every time you bring the glass to your lips for a sip. Blah."
"This review brings me closer to one of my reviewing goals, 3 beers per style (all 104) on beeradvocate. I am now only missing one Gose review and one Bière de Champagne. Soon."
"(D)- Thin, light, and refreshing, though to a point since there really is not much to this."
"(O) This beer doesn't get any love on here. In all honesty, this is one of my go-to imported beers. It could scale back just a hint on the lemon and orange peel, but other than that I think this is pretty good."
"Dr: Very easily drinkable, low quality, and high ABV. A great chugging beer for a night in with the lads if ye're seeking to get bollocksed, but not worthy of a proper serving if you're wanting a good beer. Pretty cheap, at least by German standards, especially for an import."
"Overall, this another bottle I bought just cuz I needed the bottlecap. I use to buy this sometimes about ten years ago when I was 21 and broke, because of the 7.2% ABV. I'd only recommend this to someone who happens to like Heinekin because of the abv."
"I got purchased this beer as part of a mix and match six pack that I got at a Wegmans grocery store. I thought that it was a pretty decent European lager. However, it is a tad overpriced if you're buying it here in the states. It reminded me of a Heineken, only with much more kick since it is 7.20% ABV. I would recommend giving it a try."
"The nose offers grain a bit outdated with a fine touch of alcohol, such as through any fruit liqueur. The taste is alcohol, syrupy (a bit too much) and offers an array of ripe fruit on the edge of decay. In addition, it is unfortunately not easy to drink. Many blabla finally a beer that is closely related to ordinary strong lager without any personality and originality."
"Purchased a bomber of it as this was the best option. Yikes..!! The beer poured a dirtly straw colour with a instantly vaporized head. It smelled of corn syrup, pale malts and biscuit all along a cheap alcoholic line. The taste was nothing to write home about - just what you would expect from a mass produced lager - fake maltiness from syrup, zero hop presence and a lingering skunkiness that simply prolonged the misery. The regular Carlsberg is so much more drinkable. Its inevitable that any ""strong"" variant of a lager will end up tasting all messed up like this. I could finish only less than half of the bottle. Not recommended."
"Probably one of the first beers I had after turning 21 and haven't had it since. I was told that this beer was good from a friend of mine and I took his word on it. I picked up a 6 pack and found this to be rather gross. I asked him what he liked about it and he just said that he liked it because it was strong. On the Strong side is correct especially for someone who's just getting into beers. This brew was yellow in color, it looked like a Becks, Smelled and Tasted like one too. The only thing this beer has going for it is the 7% ABV. Other than that you can leave this one on the shelf."
"D: Normally I wouldn't really review a beer that I didn't care for, but this was so bad (drain pour) that I had to give it my lowest score because it was one of the worst beers I've had IMO. The green bottle and twist off cap should have warned me. I understand that some may like it, but I found nothing good with this beer, sorry Carlsberg."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a bitter aftertaste. A low quality beer, which I will not try again. Avoid."
"The CPJ"
"It got a C from me. Most green bottles get an F."
"drinkability; the alcohol is well hidden to say the least, why by malt liquor if this is available?....well if price is not an issue, a little too expensive for the quality received."
"RJT"
"An average appearance, a golden orange hue with a bubbly white head. Had a grassy, grainy aroma with some whiffs of alcohol. Moderate carbonation and a smooth, alcoholic medium bodied mouth feel, average drinkability. Had a sweet alcohol taste, a slight hop bitterness and a dry finish. All in all just an average beer."
"Pours a clear straw color with an one finger head which recedes to skim and leaves a small amount of lacing present. The smell is of hoppy bitterness and alcohol. The hop smell is generic though. The taste is a sweet malt up front with a generic hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly dry. Drinkability is okay, its an easy drink nothing to really make you dislike it. It is very generic and bland but you could take a couple. An overall okay beer."
"D: A little to bitter for consistent consumption; not bad, but borderline skunky hoppiness keeps me on the fence with this one"
"Certainly an interesting beer that may take some time getting used to. The 7.2% alcohol kicked in even with just one bottle, so I don't think I'd have too many of these back to back."
"Slightly off white head of one finger. Splotchy lace with little cling. Matches a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Aromas of wheat straw, barley, and a little citrus. Taste has flavors of wheat, barley. Starts heavy, sweet in the middle, tart at the end. Some body in the mouthfeel, sort of creamy, but just a little thin. Beer has some kick, good for a party with limited time to get a buzz."
"Drinkable and amped up, but a little rough around the edges."
"Notes: not my favorite euro strong lager, but a respectable beer when choices are limited"
"I thought this was a Canadian beer. Maybe I've got this wrong. All I remember is that it had an Elephant on the label and was 11%ABV. And again, that's all I remember. Other than that, just a typical pale lager with extra alcohol for getting cheapos drunk faster."
"I got the real stuff brewed in Denmark, not the Canadian version. Nothing special in the appearance category. Pale gold-yellow, little to no head and scant lacing. But, Scandinavian beers pretty much follow this appearance in general. Smells not bad - some doughy orange rind and faint lemon. The flavor is good. Very smooth carbonation and great mouthfeel. A little spicy, vanilla cream or orange cream flavors. More malty than hoppy. Sweetness comes through nicely, similar to some Belgian ales I've tried. The booze quotient is high, but I hardly notice it. In fact it's pretty refreshing and I can happily down a few of these without getting tired of the flavor. The downside to the taste is a bit of an astringent bite, but the overall positive taste wins me over. I buy this on occasion and I'm never let down. Compared to Canadian ""strong"" beers or malt liquors I've tried this is exceptionally good."
"Drinkability: this beer's flaws, combined with its high ABV, make for not much drinkability. Still, I suppose you could do a helluva lot worse."
"This beer pours a pale yellow with a thin white head that dissapears quickly with little lacing out of the bottle. Clean aroma with you can smell some alcohol and grains. Starts a little bitter and grainy tasting, then turns to some sweetness and noticeable alcohol kick. I felt this beer is kind of thin and watery, not very good. Nice to taste once."
"The grain alcohol taste of it makes it disappointing, especially considering I rather like the creamy soft carbonation otherwise."
"D. The smell and taste are acceptable and it looks good for what it is, but the mouthfeel really lets this one down. It isn't crisp and refreshing like one would expect. It's unlikely that I'll pick this up again."
"D: if I'm trying to tie one on quick, I could see this coming in handy - couldn't drink more than maybe two in one sitting as I could anticipate tasting more paint thinner than lager as I go on. But, honestly, its okay for what it is"
"This falls away significantly as a drinkable beer, leaving it too harsh and too unpleasant. For all its aggressive characteristics, it doesn't have the quality in the base beer to support it. It ends up feeling overblown and harsh."
"Cheers"
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple fingers of white head. The beer is a beautiful golden color. That's where my compliments end. It has a bready malt aroma and of course the initial skunk smell because it was in a green bottle. I get a strong bitter metallic taste. I had this beer probably ten years ago and couldn't remember how it was. Now I realized that I had repressed the memory of the ordeal."
"I'm not really impressed. I cannot imagine including this on any rotation of beers in my fridge."
"I had a nice finger of bone-white head, but the humidity here is astounding and it took a powder. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I could definitely smell alcohol heat along with the lager sweetness on the nose. Standing by to have my butt kicked for my transgression. Mouthfeel was medium with a slight heat on the tongue. I noted the burnt popcorn mentioned by EwaldEichstaett, but as a taste rather than a smell. It was odd, but I have tolerated far worse. Finish had the immediate dryness associated with Malt Liquors and the manipulation of the yeast to produce a high ABV quickly. Whew! One unexpected result of The CANQuest (TM) is that I have become quite familiar with (and let's call a spade a spade here) cheaply made lagers and the flavors they produce. I would be interested to try this from a CAN, but I CANnot recommend it to the casual lager drinker. There are just so many better lager-style beers available that to foist this on someone would be too much for even Bro. Woody to forgive."
"The beer tastes decent, at least there is some flavor to the beer, malty with a touch of hops. You can taste the alcohol a little, although it is not as present as I expected. The beer has quite a bit of body to it. All in all it tastes like a regular carlsberg with a bit of alcohol added."
"I actually really liked this beer. As a Carlsberg fan in general, I figured I'd give Elephant a shot when the opportunity presented itself to me at a Swiss ""Beers of the World"" shop. I bought it in bottle form, and was instantly surprised to see its relatively high alcohol content, 7,2%. Now, as a Canadian beer aficionado, this instantly made me curious, and upon tasting it I wasn't disappointed. It tastes a lot like the usual Carlsberg, meaning quite carbonated, strong taste of corn and hops which I do quite appreciate. Overall a really nice beer, catches up with you surprisingly quickly for a beer, so be mindful of the alcohol content. Give it a try!"
"Drinkability: The sweet taste doesnt do much to hide the higher ABV content of this beer, however I did not find it hard to finish. Overall, its a fairly simple, mediocre lager that delivers the punch when its needed."
"Nothing to seek out but if your caught in a bad spot better than most marcos."
"Pours a rich, amber-gold with plenty of head and lacing. This nice 7.2% ABV lager has a nicely floral nose and a balanced malty flavor profile -- not too challenging or challenging but certainly enjoyable and easy-going. A good, solid beer with a surprising alcohol kick."
"Not exactly my favourite lager."
"Drinkability: This is little more than a slightly-tweaked malt liquor in a European label. Don't be fooled."
"D: The alcohol is very well masked, but I'm not sure if I would try this again given the lack of interesting flavors in the taste."
"D - In the end it'll pack an unexpected punch for how light and moderately refreshing it is, and for what it is, it's definitely drinkable. A fair session beer to get drunk off of if that's what you're shooting for. Otherwise it's much like any other Euro-style lager."
"I'll confess when I bought this I wasn't looking for quality, but quantity. It was on sale at the liquor store and some buddies and I had a party coming up. It kept me from buying a 30 of Natty, so I can't complain. That said, this isn't a good beer."
"Golden yellow honey color with some chunks of sediment floating around. Pretty respectable head. About two inches of thick white foam. This beer does not smell good. I don't want to be one of those guys that compares a beer's characteristics to puke, but that's pretty much what we have here. A vomit smelling beer. The taste is very grainy and chemical. Alcohol is presant which makes for an astingent solvent like flavor. It's not good but you can get it down. It kind of reminded me of an old english 800 or some other hard core forty ounce malt liquor. The only reason to drink something that tastes like this is for a quick cheap buzz. The problem is this stuff is not cheap. If you want a cheap drunk, go for a forty in a paper bag. If you want to spend the money on a six pack of quality beer don't go anywhere near this."
"D: I can't find a reason for anyone buying this beer, besides the obviuos: it makes you drunk faster compared to macro-beers at 5% ABV..."
"I've been on a beer tasting kick for the last few months or so and so far I have tried about fifty beers and this is the worst one yet. It doesn't ever really taste like beer honestly. It tasted like it was rotten. I don't recommend it. Cool bottle though..."
"Poured from an 11.2 ounce green bottle with no freshness date. Golden rod yellow murky color. Almost no carbonation and no head. All lot of malts, honey and spices in the smell. Flavor has a lot of yeast, some honey, clove flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Alcohol well hidden. Drinkable nature is okay."
"Green 12 OZ. into a pint guy. Not so crystal clear light honey color with 2 fingers of fluff white that receedes to a super thin layer atop with some lace. Smells sweet, thats about it. First sip i took i thought ""tootsie-pop"" for some reason, sweet and bitter, the alcohol does show through some. Med. bod and decent carbonation, i could see a couple of these on a hot day its not a bad beer, but i feel if they toned down the alcohol content a bit this would be a more enjoyable brew."

"D- didn't expect much, but i hoped for something a little better. the beer isn't skunked, thanks probably to the oxide killing sulphites, but being aware of preservative content is also a turn off. i just can't finish this glass."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall, I am quite impressed with this beer. It goes without saying that there are far better brews out there but this is actually quite good for a malt liquor. Well done."
"D: The smell and flavor kill it. After a few of something else, this would be a great way to keep going...though at 7.2 you might regret it in the morning."
"D: This tastes like someone took regular Carlsberg and re-fermented it in his basement to up the alcohol content. There are so many better beers I can think of that have higher ABV levels and taste delicious, all of them ales. I don't think lagers were meant to be high-alcohol. I can't say I'm a fan at all of this one."
"I honestly can't see what my dad sees in this. It's one of his favorites and I'm struggling through a bottle. I don't think I would pay for this again, but I could see myself drinking a free one in the name of father-son bonding."
"Drinkability runs strong here. I liked Elephant beer actually, and think it would go great with seafood dishes."
"Easy to drink, though not really much flavor or anything else noteworthy."
"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a rich, golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of hops and malts. Taste is of alcohol with some hoppiness. Feels rather light in the mouth. Drinkability is about average. Considering the ABV this is a fairly decent brew."
"I think Carlsberg beer is one of the most drinkable pale lagers out there and to make Elephant I think they just inject it with steroids. Not a lot of character or nuance, just a big boozey hit. It's interesting but flavour-wise I don't think it's wholly successful."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is medium and coating. The body of the beer is medium heavy and the finish is medium. This beer overall is just okay at best. The flavor are all over the place and there is no uniformity."
"I only was as generous on the scoring as I was because I was comparing it to other malt liquors which I have had."
"Conclusion: It's like an American Malt Liquor...but with a bit more depth/character"
"Prickly mild carbonation takes away some of the flavour (thank god)."
"-RR"
"D- Drinkable on occation if you need a beer for the buzz and dont want to go for a malt liquer deal. A-Ok with me."
"It looks good for the color, which is golden with a nice thick head. The smell is by far nothing to write home about with only hints of the ingredients. The taste is mediocre as it gets which seems to me it would be a Canadian light beer, but it does taste like a beer. Another mediocre on the feel too. It goes down smooth so there is another positive. Assessment: drink this beer if you want to play a drinking game in Denmark, but save your money in being a beer condenser."
"Drinkability: A bland, vapid lager gifted with a bulky alcoholic character makes for a somewhat unpleasant drink. Skip it!"
"Golden bodied with a big pillowy white head that leaves wispy rings of lace behind. A big whiff of skunk hit my nose as I cracked the cap, that has since dissapated after decanting into a glass and waiting a minute. Now I get euro hops, toasted grain and alcohol in the nose. This beer tastes like a euro version of a malt liquor, more hoppy and less sweet grittiness than U.S. versions though. Finishes a little hot. Medium light bodied with a creamy carbonation. I would drink this if it was $2.00 a 40 OZ., but not for ten bucks a sixer."
"This beer is very drinkable, with a 7.2 abv it packs a little punch for a little bottle."
"Elephant is alright, but nothing more. It's priced the same as Carlsberg's flagship lager (at least where I live) and its crisp, but with a bigger, boozier punch.  Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, simply because there are any number of macro-style Euro lagers that I would opt for if that's all I had to choose from, along the lines of a Stella Artois or Heineken/HL on draft."
"So at the liquor store I work at I have people buying this stuff by the case and I have got to try and see what the hype is about. Pours a rich golden color with a fizzy short lived head. The smell is mostly sweet malts with a faint cereal aroma. The taste was mellow with a sweet corn and cereal grain quality and a warming but stingy finish."
"D: Nothing spectacular about any of the individual parts, but not a terrible thing to drink."
"It's just a lot of alcohol in a golden yellow delivery product. I'd rather drink an IPA with the same abv if alcohol was the only reason to drink."
"D- The warmer this beer got the more I can taste it. The more I can taste it, the less I like it. One's enough for me."
"This is really quite bad. It will get you drunk, it doesn't taste horrible but really undesirable. I will not drink this again unless it is a last resort. I'm not going to finish this."
"Pours a pale golden with creamy, pillowy head that leaves a creamy lace. Head sustains longer than I would have imagined. Smell upon opening the green bottle was mildly skunk-pungent-marijuana-funk. Taste is suprisingly clean, crisp and dry. No discernable taste other than the hint of high ABV. Mouthfeel is thin, almost watery but there is something there, slight graininess that keeps it from having no flavor at all. Recommended only if you've never tried it."
"D: Not something I would go out of my way for, but not something I would completely avoid. At over 7% ABV this beer could pack a punch, but the overall taste wouldn't allow it to be one of those beers that sneaks up on you. You'd see it comin."
"D: This is no better or worse than any other Euro lager. At least it's robust - that sets it apart from many other lagers in this style, even if it doesn't necessarily make it better. I'd be curious to see how this stands up to an American macro ice beer or malt liquor - how much of the appeal here is its Euro label?"
"D - The skunky taste is too much for me. For those who can handle the skunk smell and taste this one might not be bad."
"Overall: another bad beer from Carlsberg. Avoid. They should put more money into Jacobsen and spend less on these kind of products."
"Not a lot of life here, which I was surprised by given the ABV on this. Even a sharper feel of booze might have been welcomed by me. I think the elephant forgot to bring flavor into its own beer."
"This is a pretty boozy, strong tasting lager. It could be worse, but its pretty unworthy of actively seeking out."
"Overall impression: This malt liquor tastes like malt liquor. That's really about all there is to say about it. Not a repeat buy."
"D - Not bad but won't be on my list to get again"
"D: Not really a beer I want to revisit. I remember thinking this beer was a big deal back in the 90's. Not so much now."
"Golden colored beer with a slowly fading head with pretty decent staying power.Aroma has that damn skunk smell.Taste is grassy and pretty gross.Not a very appealing beer in any way.I guess good if you want to get drunk.I'm glad I gave this a try but it's time to move on!!"
"The taste is like a malt liquor with some light bitter herbal hops thrown in. It is sweetly malty, grapey-alcoholic with some grain and an herbal-pine bitterness. It's not bad, generally pleasant, drinkable, smooth, with nothing unpleasant."
"Not a good beer at all. I've had much better pale lagers than this. I'm not sure where they were going with it."
"D: This is not a very good beer. Not much taste or personality and a very harsh quality to it. Pass."
"Drinkability- The bottle says malt liquor, thats what this is Im pretty sure. Do not buy it."
"First things first, there's nothing patently offensive about this beer-bravo. That's not an easy accomplishment for a high-alcohol macro lager in green glass. The aroma is pretty non-existent however, I got a hint of strange scented candle-like spice I wouldn't expect in beer. The flavor opens with smooth bready malts and finishes with a big lager tang. In most beer this tang is unpleasant and astringent, but here it comes off more like a mix of strong perfume and fruit punch. Still not something you usually demand in a fine beer, but this could be worse."
"Pours a nice golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some citrus notes. The taste is malty, very slight hops, with some citrus. Medium body. Not drinkable, I would not buy this brew again."
"Elephant Beer basically comes across on the tongue as exactly what it is -- a strong lager. It's like Carlsberg just took its flagship beer and poured a bit more alcohol into the mix, and the overwhelmingly alcoholic character kills any real drinkability that the beer would most likely otherwise possess."
"Undercarbonated and slick and not particularly exciting. Meh."
"Huge off white head clung very well to my glass. I was surprised, and it laced well too. Strong aromas of alcohol, some malt and yeast. Taste is of malt up front followed by a hoppy middle and then sour mashed malt at the end. Bitter and flavors as taut as a corset, like a punchy pilsner. Don't care for the aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and a light body. Too bad the flavors aren't better because otherwise this could be a very good beer."
"Pours a very nice golden color with great initial head, although it fades fast, with a bit of lacing. Nice scent, extremely malty with a little sour/skunkiness. Good taste, a deep malt flavor with some good hop finishing, with bites of sweetness. It goes down fine, but a bit rough. A nice strong lager."
"D: Drinkable, but lots better available. Smell, taste and mouthfeel didn't make for a pleasant overall experience."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Way more body than I expected. Moderate carbonation. A lot better than I expected, but not by that much"
"D: Not terrible, but I don't think I'll be having again. Can't say that this brew is recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty good too. My only complaint is that it's a bit high on the carbonation side. Don't drink these on an empty stomach, as they can burn quickly. Either way, this is a good malt liquor, a bit pricey, but good."
"Had a smooth flow with some hopiness and citrus coming off, but then a rather nasty backbite. The ABV more than crept in and overpowered the hops and the maltiness in the middle, and while this is a passible beer I'll pass when offered again."
"D - I would not recommend this beer to somebody it has a bad taste with a very weak mouthfeel"
"The taste is very sweet with a lot of grain going with it and, the way this one goes, it doesn't even come close to tasting good. There's some bitterness there as well mostly in the finish but... Wow. This is a very rough brew and I'm going to find it hard to finish the bottle and not *just* because of the abv. This is a ghastly beer. Ok, I can't take it any more....down the drain."
"D-it packs a nice punch,and the label looks kind of cool,but,I'll stick to the regular Carlsberg Pils from now on!"
"My overall impression from my tasting notes were that this beer is basically a Heineken on steroids."
"A good overall brew. Good session beer."
"Oh and pour it out, shit this stuff sucks straight out of the can."
"EDIT: The reviews make it sound like the canned version is better than the bottles. It seems to alleviate the smell issues. Still, barely worth trying in this format."
"An okay beer except fo the god-awful smell. Plug your nose and enjoy?"
"In all, tastes like cheap, corny malt liquor with a big dash of hops thrown in that were left to sit out in the light too long...not that this is a bad thing?"
" ~ I can't see myself ordering one in a pub, unless that pub is in Denmark. In that case I'd certainly try one on draft. Friends, give it a try, as you might be pleasantly surprised."
"This just isn't a very good beer--not a total dud, but not one I'll buy again. When cold, it's fine. But there are scores of better Strong Lagers worth buying."
"D-I doubt i will have another one of these in my time. It was ok to try."
"Overal it didn't quiet win me over and I wouldn't want a pint of it, the little bottle I had was enough. I did have a draught one years ago at a trade fair in Berlin but I can't recall much about the day let alone which beers I enjoyed the most."
"If you want a decent tasting beer, for a reasonable price, that will also get you feeling fine, this beer is for you."
"D: You can drink this beer, and a good amount of it. The alcohol does not cut into the taste, but overall I'd pass on this beer if other beers are available. Something about the taste and mouthfeel that just did not bode well with me."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours an amber yellow into the glass with a short white head that had a little bit of volume to it. The aroma was of hops really with some light malts in the base. The flavor was a bit different. It had some light malty taste but I was expecting more hops from the aroma. The aftertaste is a bit strong and it has a harsh kick to it, but that is due to the higher amount of alcohol in it. I think it should be smoother but overall it's OK and OK to drink."
"very easy beer to drink, drank five for this review and could easily have had more."
"Not bad, but I don't think I'll be going for another one of these for awhile. Lots of better stuff out there, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: This is a decent beer, and if under the guise of another label/company, might be considered a good beer. It's quite simple but doesn't have any strong negatives either. A good beer worth trying, don't hate. I probably would never buy it again though. ;-)"
"Drinkability: Great drinking, medium-strong brew. Easy and enjoyable to drink, but can hit like a herd of elephants."
"it if that's what you're after. So far, the worst old-world brew I've tried."
"Pours a pale-ish amber colour with a rather thick head that lasts for quite a while. It smells rather sweet, almost floral. Initial taste is rather passionfruity but doesn't have the sweetness. The big turnoff for me is that it leaves a very very bitter aftertaste. I didn't find that it had much of a body to it either as far as mouthfeel. I'm thankful I only bought the one bottle. I'm a little disappointed as I quite like the regular Carlsberg. Fortunately I don't have to buy this one again."
"Pours a darkish golden color with lots of creamy/chunky white head that sticks around for a while. I really can't smell anything on this beer. The taste is very sweet from the alcohol, and a little from pale lager malt. There's a bunch of hoppy bitterness there as well, some sort of noble hops, I believe. The bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick and fairly creamy, not bad at all. Overall, it's fairly drinkable, but it's not really my kind of beer."
"D: An easy to drink malt liquor, taste can be a bit off-putting at times, but better than most American representations of the style."
"d: not terrible, not worth another try"
"This brew isn't too bad for a Euro Macro with bite."
"Pours an almost orange color with a very thing head and minimal lacing. Never heard of this style before. Aroma is very strong of malts and alcohol. Must be the European equivalent of American Malt Liquor. Says so on the label. Anyway, the taste is very strong and somewhat unbalanced. There's a rough bitterness upfront that doesn't go down as smooth. The aftertaste is grainy and full of alcohol. I've had better malt liquors. I can't rate this one very high."
"Now that I've tried this beer, I see no need to do so ever again. it's drinkable, but so's water, and it's skunk-free. On the other hand, Denmark is now off the list of countries I need to try a beer from."
"Overall, better than expected, but not something I feel a need to have regularly."
"Overall, quite drinkable and hides its alcohol contect quite well [which might be dangerous]. Goes down very easy. Good session brew."
"D: Although there isn't anything special about this beer, it's still very drinkable.."
"Overall I was a bit underimpressed with this as a specialty beer, but as a macro lager, I was quite pleased. I would rather have this then most other macros I have tried, but I would rather not havea macro at all if you follow that, anyway, if its around give it a shot, but dont expect to be blown away."
""
"Appearance is a light murky yellow-orange, with a light head that quickly goes away. Smell of sweet malt and orange honey. Taste of light malt, hops, and slightly sweet with a hint of orange honey. mouthfeel is light - medium with a good amount of carbonation. Not a beer I think I'd buy again, although it was at a good price at the local grocery outlet store, so for the money it was worth a try."
"Well, what to say in the end? For me, as long as I can easily name an occasion with which to match a certain beer, then it's a beer worth drinking. It's not that this is a bad beer, but I'm having trouble placing it with such an occasion. Perhaps the beer du jour prior to attending a European football (soccer) match. Hooliganism, anyone?"
"D - Decent enough but not too often given the sweetness and price. I know I can buy much more balanced and cheaper aussie micros than this."
"D: Not bad... not great. Probably will not purchase again since it is so expensive and only average overall."
"NOTE: I've entertained the idea that maybe this beer was lightstruck; it is imported and the bottles are green. If someone wants to send me a bottle of Elephant to prove that it really is Denmark's greatest gift to the world, that's fine, but I sure as hell won't pay money for this stuff."
"It is taste where this beer departs from the nomenclature of ""malt liquor"" and into the Euro Strong Lager category. Most malt liquors are very sweet, malty, and frankly, blah. This beer really hits home with its similarity with Euro lagers. Granted, there is MUCH more malt to this beer, but it is complemented with a nice citrusy twinge of hops to balance it out. Mouthfeel is also good, more along with a malt liquor's fullness, but drinkability is much better when thinking about the taste and smell. This is one beer that will get you drunk, but won't leave you with as bad a taste in your mouth as with a crappy malt liquor."
"D - I could drink one of these if I just wanted to catch a buzz. The best Danish brew I've had. I like this more than I thought I would."
"Why is this the only Carlsberg I can find in the store? I just want some of the original stuff... Rest assured that I won't get this again. One of the worst beers I've ever hard."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. I got this because it seemed interesting and it was something I hadn't tried in the create-your-own-6-pack section of World Market. Pours a very nice orange-yellow with very little head and not so much lacing, but decent carbonation. The smell didn't impress me, it smelled a lot like cheap beer and only after it warmed a bit did some sweetness come through in the smell. I was generally surprised at the taste after I smelled it. It has a good amount of sweeness with some citrus flavors. It's a little acidic in the mouth but it goes down easily and I may even detect a bit of hops in the aftertaste. Overall not a bad brew for something that's oftent classified as a ""malt liquor."""
"Carlsberg Elephant Beer pours a light yellow with a thin white head from a green 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit skunky, but mostly just grainy. There is a decent hop taste and a bit of grain. Not as bad as I remembered it, but I still wouldn't want to drink more than one or two."
"Call it your advocate's Natural Ice. Really, I'd say it's cheaper tasting, pastuerized forerunner to Dogfish Head's excellent malt liquor. For what it costs, well worth it."
"Pours an orange gold with continuous fizzing from carbonation. Thin head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is mostly a sour tinge with some sweetness hidden. Noticable alcohol content in the taste with little else. Much like a Miller High Life with a little more grit and sweet. I can tell hops are hiding in there somewhere, but it's very light. Moderate to light bodied, the alcohol content is the one attribute this has over an American macro."
"D - This beer was strong and malty. It seemed a little unbalanced."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Medium carbonation. I have positive feelings about this one because once upon a time I drank this with a Danish friend, I remember him being proud of this Danish beer."
"D: Not very tasty, but goes down easily in spite of that fact, not filling at all. Despite all of the bad qualities of this beer, it is not the worst that I have ever had. However, that is not to say that I liked it, because really did not. There are plenty of more flavorful beers out there with a 7.20% ABV or higher, if you are looking for a beer with a heavy kick."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear bright yellow , with a white medium head - nose of hay , skunk , slight hopps , banana , sweet corn and copper  taste of hay , skunk , hopps , and sweet - body well carbonated , and light  aftertaste of sweet corn , bitter , and gummy  but love the 7.2%"
"Mouthfeel was extremely carbonated and unpleasantly greasy. Not a drinkable beer, simply because of the poor taste."
"This ""malt liquor "" pours a very slightly hazed , golden color , with a half inch of whit foam sitting atop. The smell is a little malty , some light struck aroma , maybe the slightest tinge of floral hop and some alcohol. The taste is also of slightly malty grain , some warming alcohol , and a touch of balancing hop. This is a drinkable brew that definatly packs a punch , but it's kind of one dimensional and thin. Goes down easy enough , but it nothing that special in my book."
"i just dont have alot to say about it other than it tastes like heineken only stronger it looks like some regular domestic stuff and it just plain isnt what i look for in a beer"
"Pours a hazed pale gold with a dense and creamy two and a half finger head. Great retention that will leave delicate spotty lacing. Pilsener malt and saaz in the nose, an nice strong aroma. Pale base malt and pilsener malt are immediatly sweet, but are quickly overshadowed by an assertive adjunct flavor. Possibly corn or rice, or a combination, but not neccesarily bad; passable for the style anyway. Semi-dryng aftertaste, with a saaz/tettnanger hop flavor and bitterness that fails to balance out the strong adjunct taste. Medium body, and lighter carbonation allow a creamy smooth mouthfeel. However, a highly crisp carbonation might have softened the blow of the cloyingly sweet adjunct better. An good drinkability for a euro strong lager/malt liquor though, the off-flavor is restricted to the aftertaste and the finish shows only some saaz flavor and mild residual sweetness. This is a great alternative to most american malt liquors."
"Eric"
"Poured with an awful tarnished colour. No head. Aroma badly skunked (green bottle) but like no other skunk sensation before! Harsh alcohol is the first feature that sticks out. Skunking has removed any dimension of malt so you're left with a mouthfeel of rubbing alcohol. Low carbonation doesn't help. Gross really. This was quickest drain pour (and drain pours are very rare for me). Simply one of - if not the - worst beer I've ever tried. Do not recommend what so ever."
"I seem to concur with most of the reviewers for this beer when I say it's somewhere between marginally good and okay. Pours and settles a slightly ruddy, golden yellow. Thin white head fades to a cloudy solid film over the top of the brew. Smell is sweet, sharp, and fruity. Starts creamy and calm, but immediately full-bodied. Settles with a slight caramel flavor and malt smoothness which is quickly replaced by a bland but unmistakable group of bitters. Finishes sharply hoppy and almost wet. Sandy texture has a lasting but somewhat pleasant aftertaste."
"Drinkability: I would rate as good, I didn't fall in love with this beer, but it did have an interesting flavor, and I might try em again?"
"I'd never guess that this beer was a high alcohol beer, the alcohol is completely hidden. I'm not real fond of the aftertaste, but it is really a good beer to try."
"Some metallic elements are also noticed. Dry clean and crisp mouthfeel. Reasonably drinkable but a little too sweet. Overall, I think this is an okay beer and would have it again. I dont think its anything to write home about but I do feel that the ratings for this are autoimatically low due to Carlsberg being perceived as somewhat of a macrobrew of Europe."
"Drinkability: man am I sorry I got suckered into buying this one. I wanted a nice pilsner before going out tonight, and I wound up drinking a malt liquor."
"Anyway, out on a charter fishing boat, I had a six pack of this, 85 degrees F, sittining in the sun. This beer was perfect. Even when the cooler couldn't keep it cool, it was a refreshing drink. A little bit of a bite to it, but I'd have never guessed it was 7.2%. It had a bit of a hoppy flavor, I thought, which reminded me of some of my favorite ales."
"Color is golden with a moderate level of carbonation. Head is medium height, creamy, and on the thick side for a lager. Aroma has a grainy sweetness alongside mild skunking. Herbal hop is noted as well. Taste has a pleasant grainy sweetness that actually works well with the adjunct flavors noted here. The herbal hop flavor is the star here, strong and tasty. Drinkability is high, even at 7.2% ABV."
"Pours out to a slightly hazed light yellow color with a head of foam that remained consistant at about a half inch. Lots of lace. Aromas were buttery, with malt and sweet creamy notes. Nice. Taste was quite quaffable; yeasty bread and buttery malts mixed with a touch of hops and sweet citrus well. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and kind of creamy. Definitly not what I was expecting. Drinkability is good for a so called ""malt liquor"". I'd have this again, no question. Recommended for sampling."
"Surprise to find the ratings so low. I rather enjoyed it. Has a bright golden - straw color with a lightly oily appearance. A fluffy, stark white head that held it's retention rather well. Smells sweetly malty (pilsner malt) and hopped particularly high. The malts take on fruity characters of peach, pears, apples, and a light corn sugar flavor. Hops start off a little musks, and almost light-striken, but balances well to contribute a well balanced bittering and an earthy flavor. Full and creamy (almost thick) to the mouth. Would finish very clean and crisp if not for such bold sweetness. Alcohols contribute a warmth and drying quality from midpoint into the finish. Surprised the corn flavors never become dominant or distracting. One of my favorite lagers."
"I heard about this beer on one of my favorite directors, Roger Avary's, website so I decided i'de see what it was all about. Comes in a green bottle with a pretty cool looking elephant on the label. Poured an unimpressive golden color with a light white lace that lasted throughout. Smell was very grainy and a bit salty as well, giving it a less then inviting nose. Taste wasn't much better, lots and lots of malt on the tongue and cereal grain, but not a whole lot more. Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Drinkability? If you want a stronger beer that will probably get you wasted, then by all means, but not much in the flavor department with this brew. Can't say I too fond of this one...reminded me of a heinken crossed with malt liquor."
"Not drinkable. Too cloying. In a word: Horrid"
"Drinkability: Good versus the styl, not too good against a good craft brew."
"At heart, it's a malt liquor. I've had worse, but this wasn't created to be art. It's the sort of beer you buy if you're trying to get whammed in a hurry. Not something I think I'll buy again."
"Crystal clear gold liquid pours from a green bottle, and produces a soft white head of moderate size. Moderate carbonation. The appearance is fairly unremarkable. The aroma is laden with corn and sulfury hop smells, theres also alcohol, a bit of malt, and a grass and grain quality. Its not particularly enticing. The taste follows the aroma: sweet and alcohol, with some pale malt flavor. Moderate body, which is maybe just slightly tilted to the watery side. As far as malt liquors go, this is decent. Unfortunately, its still forgettable."
"There's nothing at all to recommend this beer other than the fact that it isn't offensive to those who can tolerate the style. Since even passably good beer should be judged by a higher standard than that, I can't recommend Carlsburg's version of a Euro strong lager/malt liquor. It has been said that elephants never forget. That may be true, but I won't remember much about this Elephant within minutes of draining the glass."
"Not a very good beer. I'm not even sure I'm going to finish this bottle."
"Sweet grainy, grassy taste, very typical for a Euro lager. The major difference here is that the Carlsberg Elephant has a funky rubbing alcohol kick on the finish that leaves an unpleasant flavor on your tastebuds. It's great that this beer has a 7.2% ABV, but the flavor of this beer isn't so great. An average to below average beer with some power to it."
"Nothing special, just a mass market beer with a little extra alcohol kick."
"I like this brew, not something I would have all the time but I believe it to be quite good. I wouldnt mind pounding some of these babies to help with a cold winter trek somewhere, the alcohol would sure help."
"Notes: not much to say about it"
"Pours a clear golden color, with a very small white head that disappears fast. The aroma is pleasant. Malt and alcohol with some grassiness. The alcohol in this beer is not hidden at all. The most prominent part of the flavor is the alcohol burn you feel slide down your throat. Before that this beer is very grassy. The aftertaste is also grassy. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Overall, drinking this beer is like drinking a glass of my lawn."
"The beer pours a light orange hue with a little cream head. The smell is very skunky at first, the green bottle just dissapoints once again. Once you get past the skunk you can smell slight wheat and buttered toast. The taste is heavy on the malts, a hint of buttered yeast will float around. Light and overall awful. Stay away from this."
"Drinkability: In spite of its commonness, it's OK to drink, especially if you're with a large group of footy fans at an inner city English pub. Goes down pretty easy, and isn't here to be savoured. A temporary beer."
" The beer poured a golden color with a decent white head that left good lace in the glass. My first whiff was very slight hops and bigger malt. The flavor is malty, almost a sweet flavor. I was very surprised at how fresh this beer tasted. The second bottle was every bit as good as the first! The 7.2% alcohol was not evident at all in this strong lager. I hate that malt liquor label crap! It conjures up immediate visions of Mickeys or Colt .45. This is not in that category. I would put this up against Checkvar or Pilsner Urquell anyday. I know they are not exactly the same style but as far as an imported lager goes they are close. I would strongly recommend anyone who rated this poorly in the past to give it another try. You may be pleasently surprised, I was!"
"Pours a bright, uriney yellow gold with a small, fizzy, off-white head. Nose is reminiscent of a standard Euro pale lager. Light, cerealy honeyish malts play second fiddle to a slightly skunky hop aroma. I can't catch any alcohol fumes (luckily). Taste features sweetish malt up front that has kind of a syrupy feel to it. Light toasted cereal in there too. Hops even out some of the sweetness with some skunky bitterness. Not terribly skunky though, and not that bitter either, as the sweetness lingers into the slightly burning finish. Not bad; certainly better than most US malt liquors I can remember drinking from my college days."
"Pachyderm ghetto juice is my take here, the alcohol is 7.2% by volume so why the sulfites? for a preservative, or for taste?"
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"Came in a 11.2 oz green bottle. Pours a dark yellow with an orange tint. Only a little head remains, but not too bad for a lager. Smell quite malty, but pleasant and I thought I was in for a treat. Mouthfeel is mediocre and not very carbonated. Taste is strong as the alcohol content would indicate, but you're left with a hoppy aftertaste on the palate. I don't mind that, but it's a little more than you'd expect from a lager. I might try this one again, but probably not for a while."
"This one was new at my local shop, so I figured I'd give it a try. Then I looked at the reviews ... and nobody seems to like it. Pours a yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Very clean color. The aroma is very grainy with some hints of sweet malt. Very skunky smell at first, but that aroma disappears very quickly. The flavor was a surprise. Smooth and slightly sweet with a nice malt character and a bit of hopping. I honestly enjoyed the flavor of this one. It was smooth and had a crisp and clean flavor."
"I honestly cannot think of a positive thing about this beer, unless you are into pain. The only positive is that it will be a nice addition to my bottle collection."
"Of the 6-8 people I tried to pawn my 24 bottles of Elephant off to, nobody liked it."
"I can't recommend this brew."
"Well the aroma is something, it is not skunked, and it actually has a dry biscuit like note to it. The beer is a brilliant gold color and pours with half way decent off-white head. The aroma has notes of lightly spicy, herbal, lemon-like hoppiness and that austere grainy character. A clean, lightly sweet taste from the malts used. Actually the taste is not as bad as I thought it might be, there is a bit of a hop bite at the end, and perhaps an herbal hop flavor in the middle as well. There is an interesting aftertaste that is a bit minty, and perhaps a wee-bit off-putting, but it is oh-so-much better than I was expecting. Certainly not something I will ever pay for again, and I am still ashamed that I bought it, but to atone for my transgression I have ordered a case of Cantillon Loerik :-)"
"I sort of like this beer, and I wonder whether some of the lower scores are based on the Canadian version. I'll have to compare and contrast."
"Pours a golden pilsener color with a fluffy white head. Bready, malty aromas with a touch of hops in there, too. Alcohol punch in the start and finish, with some maltiness in the middle. Not entirely enjoyable in the sense of it's inbalance towards the alcohol side while not retaining ""beer"" qualities. I'm not biased against malt liquors, just not this one."
"An amazing plain and placid beer for the alcohol volume. Very 1 sided and boring. Don't bother."
"Pours out of the can as a super clean light amber with a quick fade of a bright white head. Not bad, but nothing special. I was expecting bad though. The malts lend out a good mouthfeel with an easy going flavor. There is a small bitter balancing in the finish. This is not a brew which I would seek out, but I certainly do not mind drinking it."
"Draught: This one is a somewhat golden yellow color. Typical big, fizzy white head. It has a strong alcohol taste. There are some malts in the background, with a body a few ticks above thin. Seems to exist for the buzz factor alone. Perhaps this is why I liked it in college, but am not as keen on it now."
"11.5 ounce twist off cap bottle."
"Not real drinkable, worst thing I have tasted yet. Elephant must be Danish for Mad Dog 20/20"
"The beer pours a light golden color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It boasts of pale malts and lager yeast. It has a slight malty aroma that is pleasant to the nose. The taste is not that great. It is malty with a skunky aftertaste. It has a bitter finish and a lingering flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It goes down with a thick mouthfeel. This beer isn't that good. It has a better make-up than most commercial lagers, but it's one and done for me."
"Drinkability  Sorry, Id like to think of something positive to say but this stuff is horrible."
"after reading what people have said about this brew i had to buy a couple to see if i was ignorant, because ive drank this many a time and found it to be satisfying when ive called upon it to do the job. after drinking those im sticking with my original assessment. a good but not great beer."
"A malt liquor with all the properties of most crappy lagers except for a slightly stronger and sweeter (is this meant to be favourable?) taste. Pours clear golden tone slight head; smell is malty and some hops as well, mouthfeel is nothing out of the ordinary lagerish types, and, oh, well, Im done with this boring brew."
"Prost"
"Used to drink this in high school. Poured a golden yellow with a large white head. The smell, is well, not revolting, but off-putting a bit. Makes me think of urine. Sickly sweet tasting that leaves an oily coating in the mouth. Too much residual sweetness for me. Some metallic tastes in there, along with a harsh alcohol. I thought other reviewers were being unkind to this beer, but its fair to say that this beer just plain sucks. I wouldnt drink this again if I could help it."
"I don't see how anyone can drink this and enjoy it. After you and your buddies drink a few of these, you'll be galloping around the house making elephant sounds (arrroooh!). I usually don't trash a beer that much but this is bad, bad stuff."
"A small white head with fine-small sized bubbles.The body was clear with carbonation and the hue was yellow-gold.This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass.The nose was skunky and the flavor was bitter, sour, tart, and it left a terrible aftertaste that lingered.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, thin, watery and light bodied.There is nothing to write home about with this beer."
"Sec.....ooops, awhh, fell into my sink."
"At around $5.99 a six in my area i recommend this beer."
"Transparent gold with an extremely white head of 1/4 of an inch. Actually laces the glass in some rings. Malty and untoasted grain aromas, buckwheat and timothy hay. Mouthfeel is decent, silky and lighlty carbonated. There's little sense of hop balance to this brew, not surprising, but still, this had a decent start. Gets cloying at the third sip. Finishes decently dry with a slight sense of alcohol. I suppose if it HAS to be a Malt Liquor...but this beer does not deserve to command its ""premium"" price..."
"Pours a nice looking gold color that was almost clear. The white head was about 2 fingers high, thick and dense, and lasted a while. There was decent lacing through most of the glass. Very little aroma but what was present seemed quite malty. The taste has a husk sense and is fairly well alcohol laced. What hops are present are pushed to the rear. A fairly harsh taste overall with a decently balanced mouthfeel between body and crispness."
"Pours a medium golden color with a thick snow-white cloudtop head, excellent lace, and very subdued carbonation. Very aggressive aroma of alcohol, and grain; the sort of stuff that ""would peel the paint off the walls", as my Dad used to say. The alcohol dominates the taste as well, it hits from the moment of tasting and lingers to the end, this is particularly noticable as the beer warms a bit. Beneath the alcohol are strong and mildly bitter hops and solid grain flavors that give the taste a sweet flavor, a bit like home-baked bread. Carbonation is all but absent, so the mouthfeel is richer than it would seem otherwise. A decent and quite potent malt liqour."
"slightly hazy pale straw in color. nice bit of a head appears, settles down to a fine lace. pleasant malty aroma, some hops and an alcohol aroma prevelant. a tish sour...weird for a malt liquor. a medium body supports the stinging alcohol. it's got a bite! malty and somewhat sweet. alcohol gets in the way of any hopping. you get what you pay for in alcohol punch. for a malt liquor, it's got character and vigor. i wouldn't recommend drinking too many of these!"
"The beer pours the typical lager translucent gold color with the head average and bright white, the lace adequate to cover the glass. Nose is malt dominated, crisp and clean, as a lager should be. Front is sweet and heavy malt laden, the top skeletal. Finish has a moderate acidity and the hops understated with the aftertaste quite dry and in my humble opinion a rather mediocre beer at best."
"Another pseudo-import to the U.S. brewed by Labatt's in Canada. At least it's in a brown bottle. It pours a bright golden robe with a thick and frothy bright white head ...that shortly drops to a decent collar and lacy surface covering. On the up side, it does leave some very nice lace (which is not normally present in American malt liquors). The aroma is of a grainy maltiness and mild grassy hops. The body is medium/full with a very fine and mild carbonation. The mouthfeel starts lightly crisp at first, and then becomes creamy as it warms. The flavor reveals much more hop flavor than the aroma indicates, and the bitterness is quite bold as well. Were it not for the solid, sweetly grainy malt underneath, this could be an IPA. It's well balanced with the malt and hops tasting seperately, but also playing against each other. Quite lively and interesting. The alcohol is well cloaked, but becomes more apparent towards the end of the glass. It finishes drying with a lingering combination of malty sweetness and bitter hop character. A full and rich beer with lots of character. Interesting, and enjoyable, but not very drinkable beyond one or two."
"This beer has a light golden color, it's smooth and NO carbonation (water has more carbonation than this beer). Just like the original version of Carlsberg beer... Look for an alternative"
"Hazy golden orange color with a nice head. Grainy alcoholic nose. Grainy flavor with an overpowering alcohol flavor. Not much in a good beer flavor I was looking for. Fairly smooth, medium body low carbonation. Not enough hops."
"Pours a golden/orange color, with creamy lace and every so slight haze to it. On the nose it's pretty clean. On the palate, there is a slight sweetness, husky graininess, small hop bite, just not much there at all. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, medium body. Drinkable I suppose, but I don't see no reason to ever purchase this though."
"Bit more malt than the usual American malt liquor but still thin, not much to taste … it is more or less a beer that has a kick and sadly that is its greatest attribute."
"Medium straw with slighlty foamy head.  Kind of syrupy sweet with rich malt and adjunct flavor.  Slight hop bitterness more of an afterthought.  Very alcoholic, and that is too distracting. Almost undrinkable cold, very undrinkable as it warms."
"I had high hopes for this beer but after the first taste it just went down the tubes.  Good head and carbonation but that didn't do much good as the high ABV came through and not any maltiness.  Good thing I bought only two (my wife has to suffer too) and only 11.5oz."
"Well. After so so many nasty malt liquors, this one could be the worst. And yes, I have had OE 800. I dont know which is worse. At first, I didnt think it was so bad. My first sip was OK. Then, the aftertaste started tasting like wine. Then it revealed it's true taste, a mixture of rubbing alcohol and Popov vodka. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I would rather have a whole lot of the Steel Reserve than this crap. Steel is gourmet compared to licking the elephant's ass."
"tastes like beercahol. a hint of beer, and an overpowering blast of alcohol. other malts taste much better, and strong beers boot this right out the door. skunky and pale, this is just wrong. imagine sitting under and elephant pissing in your mouth. for only 7.2%, it is not worth the torture. it may be impossible to finish a few of these. the flavor is pure torture"
"This is fairly pale with a good head and better than average retention.  Good bittered malt nose.  Hearty body with bite but not rough.  not a great bear but better than average"
"Kind of oily alcohol flavour. Really thin, but its easy to drink and you can get drunk quick off it, which in my opinion isn't a good thing, i'd rather like what i'm drinking and get pissed off that, than this tasteless oily crap."
