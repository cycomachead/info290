"Overall Impression- While ordering this ""Euro Strong Lager"" I enjoyed it greatly but would argue that this is no Lager at all! Too strong and boozy with almost a Barleywine mouthfeel and many other styles (American Brown, Eisbock, etc.) put together. I'm glad I tried something of their specialty but would like to ask a brewmaster here (next time of course) what this beer entails and what style it is."
"drinkability: needs work. its not the strongest beer in the worl either as claims. too sweet and boozy."
"D: The alcohol is completely hidden from both the smell and taste, which make this beer go down rather easily. However, it definitely needs to be sipped given its strength."
"Pretty solid effort. The flip top pretty much exploded off when I lifted the lock; sprayed me with a mist of caramel smelling beer. Better than my cologne. Smell that n even I'd go out with me; something I don't ordinarily do. Poured with a fine, thick, small to medium sized light tan head that faded fairly quickly, leaving kind of a scummy layer and a little lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy deep medium amber. Aroma is hugely caramel, with toffee, malt, fruit, slightly floral. Flavor's like aroma plus oranges, nutmeats, and a bit of tartness from somewhere. Really works out over all. Body is as expected: full, round, luscious, and nicely cut with the good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. Much nicer in bottles than on draft at the pub. Nice dessert sipping brew. I think they even offer it at the pub as an ice cream treat!"
"drinkability: fine"
"In conclusion: For once, it's safe to ignore your curiosity and get something less ""interesting."" Their Oldgott is actually quite good, and is 1/3 the price. Or go somewhere else and get 5 decent beers for the price of this one."
"After three sips i have poured the beer in the toilet (and that is something i will not do very fast)"
"Drinkability: interesting to try once. can't say i would drink it again. must be an aquired taste. more like a dessert beer, something to sip on."
"The aftertaste is boarding on sickly, the rich sweetness stays a little to long in the mouth. I can see why other reviewers have complained about the sweet nature of the beer and the lack of an alcohol feel. The sweetness certainly hides the alcohol very well, but I wouldn't want to drive a car, even after only one!"
"Agree with everyone else who has reviewed this beer, it is way too sweet and, i believe, not as strong as they claim it to be. It's as though it did not attenuate all the way. The advertise it as ""the strongest lager in the world"". Worth a sip but not much more."
"Some wod in the back, but not our beer."
"Perhaps the most unusual beer I had in Prague--worth walking an extra kilometer to try. One of the great beers."
"A pleasant ride of taste, if you go to Prague, it is a must to taste this one."
