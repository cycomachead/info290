"Overall - This isn't a bad beer, but it's definitely not a good beer - it does meet some of the expectations for a strong lager, but lacks any balance, and leaves the quaffer with punches that remind me more of a bud light platinum with a shot of rubbing alcohol than a strong euro lager. To be honest, the price point is attractive and can provide a cheap buzz, but not one to seek out for BA's imho."

"O.K., SO MY USER NAME PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL. I LOVE THIS BEER ICE COLD IN AN ANTIQUE STEIN. VERY SIMILAR TO SOME BELGIAN STRONG ALES, WITHOUT THE HEFTY PRICE. I CAN GET A CASE OF 20 FOR ABOUT 30 BUCKS. MALTY AND SWEET, BUT NOT OVERLY SWEET. SUBTLE HOP BITTERNESS, WHICH SUITS ME FINE - I AM NO HOP HEAD. A BIG BEER FOR THE BUCK AND, OBVIOUSLY, ONE OF MY FAVES. WORTH SEEKING OUT."

"Great beer. Its light, adequately aromatic, flavorful, and extremely strong. It tastes very similar to Russian beers, specifically Baltica. For having such a high alcohol content (8.7%) it feels surprisingly light. I prefer it much better than Belgian beers which are typically heavy and sweet like maple syrup. If you can find a bottle, pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

"The best feature is that after the carbonation evaporates in about two minutes, it looks just like Scotch whisky. From the 500 ml bottle bought at AJ's Fine Foods in Phoenix."

"O: This beer reminds me a lot like a sweetned version of an American Malt Liquor except the taste is not that offensive. The apple flavors definitely help to mask some of the alcohol. This beer is surprisingly not that difficult to drink considering its style and strength."

"Overall- A very tasty beer for the style. Lots of flavor that is well balanced and pretty easy om the palate."
""
"Overall, a euro dark lager with nothing to stand out"
"Overall: This beer is good for a buzz, but that's really it. Not a bad thing, just don't treat it like the best beer will ever get because there is room for improvement. Salud!"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is malt, grain, alcohol, and some skunky aromas. Taste is much the same with an odd fermented fruit flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of alcohol burn and a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that has a pretty unpleasant aftertaste."

"O - Not bad bang for the buck with 8.7% for under 2 bucks."

"Finally finishing my style ticks with a beer I remember being pretty solid from my earlier drinkin' days. I hope it's still good... It pours a clear copper (go figure) topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty-white foam. The nose is almost entirely composed of buttery biscuits, though some very light grass and flowers vainly attempt to muddle their ways through to the 'strils as well. The taste goes in a different direction, opting for a melange of caramel, mandarin orange syrup, light maple syrup, candi sugar, and a touch of mint in the background. Gotta say, this ain't the best taste in the world... The body is the heaviest light-medium possible, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a sub-standard brew, one that's having me question my earlier beer opinions..."
"Pours a very clear, deep gold color with an off-white head. Aroma is pretty low, some malt, spice, and lemon peel. Taste has a rich, caramel sweetness and alcohol warmth, with a lingering bitter finish. Soft, medium-bodied mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not an elegant beer but decent."
"This beer pours out as light redish golden color with a fizzy white head that vanishes quickly. The aroma of the beer is a bit herbal and kind of strange, not the most appealing smell here. The taste reminded me of a Samichlaus Helles a little bit. It was almost too flavorful I think. There was just a lot going on and not enough of a balance to figure out what. The mouthfeel was a little heavier than most lagers. Overall I wouldn't need to have this one again."
"Not bad with food, but there are better Polish beers...though rated to style there are certainly worse."
"D-Among the most unpalatable beers I've ever tried. This one is just not my thing. The floral and herbal notes are overwhelming with the combination of the very present alcohol makes this one I won't try again."
"Look for the 1 Pt. 0.9 Flo. Oz. bottle."
"This is a good beer and good priced. It vaguely resembles a strong Belgian dark."
"Rich nutty caramel and dried fruit character, really gives more of a Bock impression. Standard appearance, copper gold, high clarity. Poor retention, fades fast from an initial fingers width of foam. Flavor is a bit sweet but not cloying. A low amount of oxidation, some papery dryness, but it doesn't distract. Low carbonation, an easy sipper. Overall it's worth a try, with a fairly unique flavor for a Polish lager."
" D- This beer hides the alcohol and flavor very well. It is a smooth drink with no off-flavors and in fact there are not really many flavors at all, especially for such a big beer. This is very thirst quenching which can be make a quick end to the night at 8.7 % ABV."
"D: Not bad overall."
"Taste: Not much better then the smell, it is not that it is bad it just doesn't really taste like anything. There is a slight nutty dryness to it but other then that it is pretty bland."
"It is a high octane brew but doesn't exactly drink like one, it is cheap but i prob wouldn't buy it again."
"Just cuz it was brewed in Europe doesn't mean it's any better than Colt 45."
"My friend used to buy this in college and was one of the first craft (if you want to call it that) beers I ever drank. I still buy it basically for that reason and it brings me back nicely. Not a bad beer overall.. sort of like half a dopplebock half a light Oktoberfest."
"Would not hold on to this much longer. Consumed Sept. 2009; ""Best by"" date on bottle of July 2007. Still pretty decent with the age."
"Drinkability-Very good. Can't drink these all night but definately can have a couple no problem."
"Whoa! That's a sweet (flavored, not good) beer! Poured with a decent off-white head and a bit of lace. Color is a lovely medium amber. Aroma is an extremely sweet smelling malt and a hint of beer. Flavor is the same but bolder. Real heavy alcohol character. Could be worse I suppose. Strongly suspect a headache in a bottle. Finish is sadly not short."
"Notes: I don't really know what to say about this beer except it's unlike any other I've ever drank. It's fairly prickly from the alcohol, but that curious spiciness is intriguing."
"D - Even with the 8.7% I was OK with drinking the 500ml bottle. The taste wasn't great, but it wasn't bad enough to prohibit me from finishing. Alcohol sneaks up on you and hits about half way through the serving - maybe this is good for Polish sessions, but not for mine. However if you're looking for a cheap way to get trashed, this stuff is a steal at $1.49!"
"Note: Be careful.... I drank this one pretty fast just to get it over with (I'm morally opposed to pouring beer down the drain in a recession), and now I'm a little bit buzzed."
"I got this at a small bar here in black river falls, WI The place is called rosarios(kind of a whole in the wall) great atmosphere tho lol sorry had to add that"
"(rated Sep 21, 2008)"
"This is an average beer that is consistent for style."
" It has a bit of a Czech lager taste to it and the alcohol is essentially unnoticeable. The taste is clearly alcholic, but very smoothly so, with nothing rough opr unpleasant. It has a light caramel quality, bread, and nice, warm spiciness, it's a bit rasiniy, sweet and spicy with a light bitterness coming to the fore in the finish. It does not taste quite as strong as it is."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange color with a thin white head with little to no lacing. Spicy notes accompanying crisp light fruit aroma. Flavor is very similar to aroma being spicy with hints of apple and pear as well as a slight alcohol presence."
"Poured a light copper color with a small slightly off-white head. Aroma has malt, caramel, and toffee. Mouthfeel is light with a moderate carbonation and obvious alcohol presence. Flavor is malt forward with a slight bitterness. Reminiscent of an Oktoberfest with lighter body and more alcohol. All aspects are well balanced and very drinkable."
"Pours a clear copper color with a fast fading off white head. Aroma has a malty sweetness, maybe some pear notes. Taste has a boozy quality to it, some faint bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, and leaves a faint aftertaste. Could use some more balance or depth in flavor to mask the relatively high abv. I'll finish the bottle, but would pass if offered this again."
"I feel that I may have gotten a bad bottle of this, and it should probably be tried again. I don't think that this is a fair example of this beer, especially after reading other reviews."
"Overall - I found this beer a bit lacking in complexity, taste, and character. However, it is still an ok Polish beer to drink with a porterhouse dinner. I probably would not buy this again unless someone actually wanted to try it with me."
"I respect beer and always willing to experiment with one. Won't do this one again."
"DRINKABILITY: This one is good, as long as you keep it cold. The warmer it gets, the more rice-like the flavor gets. For $1.99, though, this is a great beer, and one I would consider again."
"Another beer sold as a singleton at my local store. I saw the alcolol content, 8.7% and had to give it a try. It pours really nice with a copper color and nice head. It smells and tastes a little sweet but if it is not really cold can turn nasty. It is very strong and could make a short night of things if not taken seriously. I haven't had too many Polish beers, just the major labels, so this one was a little different. It should probably be brought out for special occassions only."
"The flavor is reminiscent of the smell. There's a big, malty sweetness up front, one that lingers perhaps a touch too long, but is still feels like it belongs. There is a noble hop finish, along with an alcoholic kick. Mouthfeel is sticky and a bit syrupy, but overall it's not bad. This one does pack a punch and is quite sweet, so I wouldn't call it a sessioner. But it's a very solid Polish beer that I would have again."
"Three hundred-plus years of brewing experience, eh? Lets see...crisp and dry aroma from a generous head in a 22-oz. lager glass...a burnt sienna body with effervescence... a picture-perfect lager to the light...hints of alcohol early are not a good sign...yet, mellow, balanced and drinkable throughout the sampling.. full-bodied malt flirts with a metallic tinge...""European strong lager"" was not in my lexicon before tonight, but I can appreciate the work on this...not so recommendable as it is a first-time thrill..."
"D-This is kind of gross. I am not a fan to say the least. At least it looks good."
"Overall: Another pleasant surprise from Poland; Ive been seeing a lot of good Polish brews at the local specialty liquor stores lately. Pleasantly malty with a solid 8.7% kick, this one is also priced reasonably enough to stock up on a few. Grab one (or a few) and check it out."
"A decent ""sipping"" brew from Poland. Caramel candy balanced by woody hops with some peppery/spicy alcohol."
"Far more drinkable than expected, but I expected Eastern European Malt Liquor. A tasty beer from Poland, a country that regularly produces beers that are better than I would expect. Really this is the European interpretation of the Imperial Pilsner and it is a good one."
"Hevelius Kaper pours a light copper color with a thick fluffy white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavor is kind of grainy, hops and malt are both pretty noticeable, and alcohol is definitely there in the finish and there is definitely some warming. Just kind of average taste wise."
"This beer looks beautiful, and it tastes just as smooth; however, its not carbonated enough to balance the alcohol. Unfortunately it must be consumed super cold, heineken type coldness, in order to be very drinkable."
"Pours a light brown. Not much head,but good lace. Smell is sweet. The alchol is evident. Body is medium, not much carbionation. Big flavor in this beer! Has a apple/fruit taste that was very appealing. Very whiskey like. I do reommend trying this beer."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with substantial foam. After settling, a fairly tight head resulted, which, unfortunately, dissipated with vary little to no lacing in the glass. The taste yielded a orange peel like, hop taste, with mixed honey notes. Fair beer for the price ($2.19) for a 1pt 0.9fl oz bottle at 8.7% alc."
"M&D - smooth and well balanced, but again not my stuff, too much of a alcohol taste, but made with quality and very good for its style"
"Jen: For $1.49 a bottle, I can't complain too much (well, maybe I can)! Starts off with a malt scent, so I expected sweetness right off the back. The ending is quite metallic tasting, like a penny was in the bottom of my glass. There is some slight hoppiness to it, but it is quickly hidden by very apparent alcohol taste. Not a typical Euro lager, but not that great either!"
"Picked this up yesterday for the sole purpose of my dinner today of pork loin ribs and sweet and sour apple kraut with potato perogie and it fit the bill.Poured into my 1.5 liter stein a rich copper with a big fluffy white head that stuck around for a few,very clean aromas with only a hint of carmael sweetness showing thru.For the hefty alcohol of this beer it went down extremely well and awesome with big flavors of the kraut and pork,starts out somewhat sweet cand caramelly but dries out nicely in a spicey finish,somewhat grainy mouthfeel.There is a slight burn in the finish but its an oh so nice burn,extremely food friendly and it has some real flavor a damn nice suprise today."
"Highly sweet, big malt, and a heavy alcohol presence. Reminiscent of a malt liquor in some ways. This one's a clunker with zero grace or subtlety."
"The bottles in my 4-pack say 8.7% abv. Not a bad brew from Poland. Something I will have again."
"16.9 oz. bottle. Very dark yellow/copper color, with a big white head, about 3/4", slow fading, with some visible carbonation. Smell is very fruity, but not a natural fruit, a syrupy, candy like fruit, also a good amount of carmel. Taste is huge and malty, very dry in mouthfeel and taste, but also fruity, with huge alcohol. As far as ESL's go, this is a very unique and interesting one, no skunk whatsoever, very drinkable, I like it and would definitely recommend it."
"Very well-designed, great balance. Strong, but held together in such a way that the booziness never goes over the edge. Medium-bodied, long, malty finish...I like this, and will most likely return to it."
"Overall this is a fine strong lager. It has lots of malt flavor and is good with a meal."
"I have to admit, this kind of grows on you. Just enough hops to counter the huge malt sweetness. Wouldn't want to drink a ton of this but...Recommended with reservations."
"I won't be looking for this again but it could be worth it as an adventure."
"Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, but goes down pretty easy. Smooth. You can put a lot away pretty quickly without realizing it- which could lead to becoming inebriated a lot quicker than you'd think. A sneaky bastard. A bit too sweet after a while, but the first one... sneaky."
"Taste was similar to the aroma, a fairly sweet malt party with a slight hint of alcohol in the finish although considering the ABV (my bottle was 8.7%), the alcohol presence wasn't as overpowering as you might think. I highly recommend (not?) drinking this on an empty stomach as it really kicked my ass and put me in a very good mood. Of all the Euro strongs I've tried, this may be my favorite and it has a cool sounding name. Cheers!"
"Pours gold and lightly carbonated wtih a thin white head. No lacing is evident. Smell is sweet with faint hop notes. Taste is sweet malt with an alcohol finish. The price is good on this if you are thinking in terms of bang for the buck, but the character of this beer is not all it could be. It is not balanced and a little to sweet and a little too much alcohol in the finish. It is not an unpleasant beer it is the pale equivalent of a winter warmer..."
"Full syrupy body."
"Pours a one-finger white bubbly head leaving a ring and not much lace. Clear light, amber color. Medium carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is sweet. Starts and finishes sweet. The high ABV is not really noticeable. An excellent choice. $3.50 for a 400ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Medium bodied with good bitterness and a moderate amount of carbonation. A decent tasting beer, and it goes down smooth."
"I think it's a good beer. They balanced the sweetness and spiciness just right to make this a good brew. Some good hop bitterness at the end takes place. Give this beer a shot, it'll be well worth it."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent with a slight hop aroma. The taste is good. It is a smooth, yet awfully malty beer with little complexity, but full of flavor. It warms at the finish. It boasts of many pale malts and other low lovibond malts that add a slight orange hue to it's appearance along with added malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It drinks well; a fine strong ale."
"Comments  A big BA Thanks to JohnnyDuvel for hooking me up with this awesome offering from Hevelius."
"Poured deep amber with a massive tan head that retained and laced rather well. Aroma was sweet, malty with a bit of spice and alcohol. Tastes of malty alcohol, caramel and more spice. Hops were barely present and the malts dominated to the end of a smooth finishing beer. Very different, but also very good."
"This rather strong ale is a copper/amber color with a thin white head and some trailing lace. The aroma is a mix of doughy malt and alcohol, with a faint smell of apples. The body is somewhat sweet and herbal, with a touch of toasted white bread. The hops are hard to define as they are masked by alcohol esters. Upon not so careful tongue smacking and breathing in through the mouth (Kathy's sleeping...I hope), a lemony sour flavor and lightly metallic tang can be detected. It seems a bit stronger than it's 9.1% ABV indicates"
"It has a highly viscous mouth and is almost caramel like. The character of the beer only comes out after it reaches a fairly high temperature, so leave it out of the frige to get the most pout of the beer. Aout one a night is enough at this level, maybe sharing a snifter is best."
"This medium bodied strong lager has a medium orange color. Large head. The aroma is fruity, pears and peaches. It definitely has a high alcohol content; its the first thing you taste, then comes the near cloying sweetness. The malts are caramel and toffee. The hops are spicy. Its way over balanced and the taste is all over the place. The flavor beats the hell out of most malt liquors and if you are looking for a quick buzz, this stuff is a good choice. Interesting beer, not sure I can recommend it; the flavor battle makes it worth trying once. The buzz is fairly clean, Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is harsh and alcoholic. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Update: 8-21-2003 2nd time having this beer ""Wow""--Makes me want to move to poland..."
"9.1% from Poland...is this gonna taste good? hmmmm.....well it's a clear amber in color with a small and nicely coating head. The aroma is sweet malts and alcohol, plain and simple. Flavors? Try chewy maltiness on a parade down your throat with alcohol as a sidekick, or shall I say cohost? Super malty and very warming alcohol. It's kind of pleasant though. And what do we have here?....a spicy hop kick to compliment the warm alcohol finish! Well that was a nice accent on a very boozy brew. It keeps it in line and I ended up enjoying it, even though I didn't have much of a tastebud or palate left after 3/4ths was consumed. Drinkability is down for the simple fact that one is enough......not a bad brew, surprisingly enjoyable to me."
"This is one cool, boozy-assed beer that I will definitely buy again. It gets better as you go, and I wish I had another right now! Tastes like a mixed drink. Malty, tangy taste, but dominated by the alcohol. Despite this, quite drinkable, and definitely warming. Kind of like a cousin to EKU 28. The ABV IS NOT well hidden here! This is, I'm sure, exactly what it is intended to be, but is relatively easy to drink and packs a helluva whollup!"
"Pours a clear, light amber (golden) color with creamy white foam that left a nice coating down the glass. The smell is good: hops with a bit of malt. The taste is dominated by hops (floral and bitter) with some malt sweetness in the background. The hop bitterness lingers long on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, dominated by the hops, but with a bit of a ""soapy"" aftertaste. Medium body. The drinkability is OK, but there is not quite enough malt to balance the hops, in my opinion."
"Medicinally sticky and all around less-than-attractive."
"Medium clear brown color. Almost Amber in color. Slight white fizzy head, fades fast. Smell is sour, mushy. Some saaz hops taste, but mostly super sweet malty. A bit syrupy on the feel. Sweetness lingers. Slick feel. Must be the 9.1% abv, but I really didn't notice the alcohol taste. A wierd beer indeed, but still tasty."
"Not bad at all....a little better than I expected, to be honest. The beer is a rich brown-to-amber color. It has a densely packed head that doesn't really last very long. The aroma is malty and grainy. Taste is initially sweet and somewhat woody. The beer hides its alcohol content very well...in the taste as well as the aroma, although there is little warming as you get to the bottom of the glass. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Finish is slightly metallic and at times the beer is a bit astringent. All in all, it was enjoyable."
"As it sits in the glass, limpid amber in color, the head immense in it size, frothy consistency with oodles of fine lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt, somewhat musk, or moldy if you like with a quite sweet start and middling top. The beer finishes with a strong acidic bite, purposeful hop presence, and a alcohol bitter dry aftertaste. The high ABV warms the tummy and makes this a bit more robust than I would have thought."
"Call me a naysayer. But my worries started as soon as I saw the 9.1% ABV on the bottle. I've tried a few of the other Polish imports over the last few weeks, and my experience has been that they tend to pack in far more alcohol than the complexities of their beers would warrant. If this was going to be anything like the Pilsners I'd had, 9.1% was just too much. But I gave it try. Poured a nice copper color, with a thin uneven head which soon dissipated to a fine lace top. The aroma is alcohol, a hint of malt, and not much else. The flavor. I tried it cold. I tried it warm. I kept trying it even though each sip made me shudder. Earthy and medicinal and intensely alcoholic. Like someone crumbled up some hop leaves in rubbing alcohol and served it in a glass. There's a bit of malt sweetness to it, but even the sweet tastes in this beer manage to come off rather harsh. Hugely astringent aftertaste. I'm a fan of strong beers -- barley wines, Stone's Double Bastard, you name it. But at least two thirds of this beer went down the drain. I only hope the EPA doesn't get on my case for polluting the sewers."
"Tawny copper color with an off-white head that thins to a collar but leaves no lace. The aroma is of sweet malt, esters, a light but sharp hop, and some alcohol. Full bodied with a tight effervescent carbonation that is zesty on the tongue at first, but becomes quite creamy once warmed in the mouth. The flavor is of rich, straight-forward malt combined with an earthy & spicy hop flavor (a real nice blend of flavors at mid-palate) backed by a solid bitterness. The finish is quite hoppy and shows the alcohol readily, leaving an almost minty flavor in the finish along with some honeyish sweetness. Somewhat sticky but bitter as well. An extra-strong, deep golden lager that is richly malty, hoppy and enjoyable, but not complex."
"Hevelius Kaper:  named after the “astronomer and brewer.”  In a 17.52 (?) ounce brown bottle, with 9.1 percent alcohol.  Very deep brown color, with a pure white head.  Rich malt flavor, and alcohol warmth. Very nice for $1.29 a bottle, an after dinner drink, not for frying up the polish sausage (as I was doing)."
"Whoa! Is right...Heavy alcohol taste throughout this brew, along with some light notes of malt sweetness and hints of spiciness. Nothing balancing this brew out though, very one sided. Overall not too shabby...Very nice looking bottle though..."
