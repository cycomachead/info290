Taste is lackluster; a bit watery and weak and not and rather fizzy. Not at all like the back label description of ""Intense, rich, full bodied taste..."" .

If it weren't for the pronounced carbonation, it would be about undrinkable. Even so.... Body is ok, while carbonation seems forced.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty white foam. The nose comprises musty caramel, light wheat, light buttery biscuits, and a definite air of green apple flesh. The taste pushes the green apple to the fore, fruity caramel (still as musty as before), a light twinge of alcohol, sweet flowers, and straight cane sugar. It's all just a sweet, boozy mess. The body is a hefty-aspiring medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a sorta painful beer to drink.

3.5,5.7,3,3,3.5,3,4.5,"First off, the picture of the beer should be changed because it has long since changed to a new label. I saw Warka Strong at work, Wines Unlimited of Stratford CT, and noticed many of our European and especially Polish customers would purchase this item like hot cakes. While many of our other imports would be at a stand still this beer remained supreme. This encouraged me to at least try it, of course. When I first drank this beer I was very impressed by how smooth it was for a beer at 7%. It was a light amber color, plentiful taste of semi sweet characteristics that weren't overwhelming. Warka Strong is a delicious beer, and has a nice firm but subtle finish that doesn't linger a nasty hop-full mouth. After having this beer, I researched it, and have gathered the following: Warka Strong is a Polish Beer, from Zywiec Group, also available in a lower AVB, and is paired well with Polish pastries that include blueberries, and also buttered toasts. However, the beer is good by itself. Nothing to scream about, but impressive. This beer is available to our store through a small distributor called Amtec, in Fairfield County in Connecticut that has an all Polish Beer portfolio.","StevenBilodeau","Dec 17, 2009"

Golden bronze color with a short-lived head and good clarity. Occasional bubbles stream to the surface. The aroma is better than what I'm used to in strong lagers. There's a welcomed absence of that alcohol/chemical scent. I only detect sweet carmel maltyness and grain. Good texture and it leaves that sticky sweet film on your teeth. Sweet malt flavor with a little carmel and perhaps a tiny trace of honey. Starts off easy and gets heavy towards the end in terms of drinkability. Pretty filling.

Tasted of sweet caramel with some nuttiness, the 7% wasnt detectable in the taste. The mouthfeel was smooth with nice coating.

2.96,-10.6,4,3,2.5,4,3,"Amber body with a nice off-white head gives this Polish lager a pleasing appearance. The aroma has grainy notes mixed in with lemon. The initial flavour impression is of sweetness, with bunches of caramel malt. Thankfully is settles down after the first few sips and becomes better integrated into the overall taste, which although still sweet malt heavy, now reveals a husky graininess and a slight bitter kick in the finish. Probably still too much sweetness to earn more than an average mark. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying...easily the heaviest I have come across in a lager. The carbonation is about right for the drink and prevents it from becoming too cloying. Pretty drinkable, and a pleasant surprise.","bobsy","Mar 31, 2008"

I drink the beer a bit cool at first, and then let it warm. Usually, this improves smell and taste. Not with this. Beer warms, and their is a foul dust taste. Reminds me of an attic. If the beer is warm, taste is a 2.0. Cold, 3.0. I'll give it the cold rating. Has a carbonation similar to sodas. Still, a bit creamy. Drinkable only when cold.","slitherySOB","Jan 19, 2007"

Aroma is sweet, somewhat adjuct-laden, as expected for the style. Taste really follows the nose, the adjunct notes are present throughout, but actually not so much in a bad way.

3.11,-6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"This beer pours a clear, light copper color with a moderately-sized, stable soapy head. Its a fresh aroma thats focused on light malts and grassy smells, backed with just a slight whiff of hops. The aroma isnt all it could be, but its pleasant, mild, fresh, and inviting. Not much alcohol in the aroma, given the ABV. The taste left me a little under-whelmed. A serious sweetness, without a corresponding malt quality, is the first thing that hits you. Dont get me wrong, theres malt in the taste, its just not pronounced in a manner that corresponds to the sweetness. This leaves the beer with a hollow, and just this side of cloying feeling. I wouldnt call it well balanced. Behind the sweetness, theres some grassiness. A lot more hops would help. Moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is very nice.full, soft, rounded, and mouthfilling. It definetly gives you the sense that youre drinking something substantial, which is nicevery filling. I wish that there were some complexity to the flavor to go along with it. All in all, this one isnt badit would go well with some polish food (Bigos?). On its own, its not a standout. I probably wouldnt buy it again.","Suds","Apr 18, 2006"

Nevertheless, the watery qualities does even it out a bit. I was easily able to finish it, but was not feeling the need to go get more. It's better than malt liquors, but not by much. The thought that I had after it was a Polish version of a ""lets get bombed"" brew. While not offensive it really doesn't have much to it to make it anything above average.","jwc215","Mar 12, 2006"

Taste likes German hops were used.","scruffwhor","Mar 08, 2006"

Rather than an extreme hoppiness, there was a very deep and layered maltiness. What I most liked about the malt profile was the distinct nuttiness. Despite the high alcohol level, it is quite drinkable, and a beer that I will not hesitate to drink again.","bignick","Sep 22, 2005"
3.21,-3,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Looks nice, rich amber color and a reasonable white head. Smell is pretty basic, malts and slight hops. The taste however threw me a big curve ball. My first three sips tasted straght up like vodka, and it's not as if I'm not accustomed to drinking 10%+ brews. Thankfully the harsh flavor faded. Other than that, a basic, malty, strong lager with poorly masked alcohol. Mouthfeel was pretty average for the style, well cabonated and slightly slick. But personaly, I can't say this was much better than average.","zjungleist","Aug 15, 2005"
3.98,20.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Crystal clear dark copper color with a giant head that forms a nice looking dome atop the beer. Light malt in the nose and taste.

An above average euro lager that I could easily session.","TastyTaste","Jun 28, 2005"
3.12,-5.7,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Light copper/ orange in colour with a fair bit of carbonation. Aromas are of ripe soft fruit, caramel, menthol, and a bit of alcohol. Medium bodied lager type of mouthfeel with this one. Strong malt presence with at least some herbal hop contribution.

4.18,26.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5," The bottle I had just said Warka Beer and had an ABV of 7% so I would assume this was the ""strong"" one. Good stuff, Poland has some tasty beers!","BrewMaven","Beers"
4.08,23.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Warka Strong delivers a clear amber body beneath a frothy head of ivory foam that holds quite well and leaves some transient splotches of leace with each sip. The nose reveals only some sweetish, caramel malt. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with a medium-full body and soft carbonation. The flavor is surprisingly rich, caramelish, and nutty with a very thin thread of hop flavor and a low-key bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable, but at the same time, it almost adds to the character of the beer and helps to balance its malty sweetness. It finishes with a slowly receeding wave of toffee-like sweetnes that's dried a bit by a wash of alcohol before it fades and more nuttiness appears. Wow! I really liked this beer! But it's not a quaffer by any means. It would work well, I think, with a Thanksgiving dinner; and could certainly hold its ground as an apertif or after-dinner drink; and it might even pair well with a dessert such as a pecan or cherry pie. Very nice!!!","NeroFiddled","0"
