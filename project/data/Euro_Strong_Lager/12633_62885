Unfortunately, I don't think that you can find this outside of Spain to easily. It's a really decent beer and only costs about a $1.50 a bottle.","Enrico_il_octovo","Jun 11, 2014"

3.14,4.3,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"330 ml. bottle Deep amber colour, decent head, so it dissapears soon, leaves a lace. Smell of grass, grain, some bread or maybe biscuit. Medium body but I found it somewhat watery, good carbanation. Taste is sweet, some caramel and citrus, grassy. Not too bad for a San Miguel, but nothing really special.","janubio","Jul 24, 2012"

Smooth flavor & mouthfeel, slightly sweet touch. Light body, light carbonation. Drinkable. ABV is not felt.","GONZALOYANNA","Jan 13, 2012"

1.99,-33.9,3.5,2,1.5,3,2,"Bronze. Mouth when you feel a light syrup not really pleasant because too fast disgusting. It seems that it is a combination of three hops and a grape aged in cellars. Faced with such a conclusion, which is undergoing a presence in more alcohol too strong to preserve the balance of the beer, it is reasonable to ask whether such a hack was required. Conclusion: do not drink San Miguel, no matter its name, when you go to Spain.","ThaCreep","0"
