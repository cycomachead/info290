review_text
"A strong lager but without identity or complexity. Tried it from a one liter can. It creates initially a gogg head but it disappears rapidly. Nose is weak with some hint of sweet malt and alcohol. Taste is straightforward sweet malt taste. No bitternes or complexity. Not a very recommendable beer unless the purpose is to get drunk fast."

"Pretty bad. No helping this one."

"Haha, just kidding buddy. I always appreciate trying something new."
"O: Avoid this one. The high ABV does not redeem the taste or mouthfeel..."
"Poured a clear, pale gold. Very pale and almost watery. Generates a finger or two of head, before fading to nothing. Light lace. Nose is sweet malts, light grain, mild alcoholic notes, apple juice. A weird candied note develops as this warms. Taste holds more malt, metallic and weird fruits notes at times. Finishes relatively dry and mildly alcoholic on the tongue, but burns when it hits the throat. Blegh. Effect is amplified as it warmed. Thin body, dry and a weird lingering aftertaste. Everything got worse as it warmed."
"Light body and reasonable mouth feel. At 8% it is quite an easy drinker. For a tall cold can of beer I would take this over a big factory Lager anyday. Not a great beer but it has enough in it to make it OK."
"Ditto on the import Malt Liquor comment from Iron Jeffro."
"Well then, this is pretty much foreign malt liquor, same as we have here, yet to give it a bit of credit it's not too rough around the edges, although still not worth revisiting."
"For its strength, it's evidently, but not overly, hot. Otherwise, inoffensive, and lots of drinkable wowee juice, for your hard-earned dollar."
"Not a very good strong lager. There are many other beers of this strength and price that are more drinkable."
"D: I was very disappointed with this brewery's premium lager. I think this one is a tad better but still I'm not too impressed. I was surprised by the floral hoppiness too it and the rich fruit flavours, but it is decently heavy and I think they could have done a better job of masking the alcohol. Nevertheless, it definitely delivers an easy buzz for your buck and would make a good catch-up beer. Bottom line: too watery and too sweet for my liking so I don't think I could handle any more than one of these at a time. So unless I have some major catching up to do, I don't think I will buy this one again."
"D: Best buzz for the buck?"
"This is a really good looking lager, very clean looking, vicious carbonation, nice full looking head and nice body. Smell is very much of corn adjuncts, very sweet, but the first sip is really surprisingly hoppy. This beer is much more bitter than I thought it would be, but thats not a bad thing, most Euro Lagers tend to be a bit too much on the malts. Great bite on the tongue, smooth going down. It sticks in the throat a bit, but man, it hits you hard and fast. I couldn't drink more than a few of these before being quite buzzed. This isn't really all that bad though, I'm surprised..."
"Okay...but a bit overpowering. I might as well just buy the premium and save 15 cents."
"but rather a hangover in waiting"
