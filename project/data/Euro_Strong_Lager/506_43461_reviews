"Can't really say much more, some alcohol traces, but even those were masked by the overpowering sweetness of the brew: I normally enjoy malty, sweet brews, but this was too much."

"OVERALL: Not as good as their Admiral. Stronger with more sweet malt flavors, but without the hop bitterness to act as balance. Yeah, there's a lot of flavor, but not flavor that make me want to go back for more."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the appearance. The head actually showed nice retention and color, making the beer seem rather inviting. It really fell apart from there, as the flavoring was intensely sweet. There was actually a benefit to this in that it helped to mask the alcohol pretty well. Other than that it decimated all other traces of flavoring and overwhelmed the drinker."

"This beer lacks balance and depth."
"D: Low. Again, too sweet and molasses"
"Overall: Way to sweet, like most strong Grolsch beers. Not worth trying."
"D-Too sweet, and a level under many of the other strong lagers one can buy for the same price."
"This beer has one purpose, and that's to get tanked on. This is not refreshing or complex; it's just got a high ABV."
