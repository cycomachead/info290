"O - I was not expecting much from this beer, but it turned out to be quite nice. Easily, one of the most flavourful strong lagers from Europe."
"Overall: Nice beer, a classic Czech beer. Watch and learn, US bud"

"Pours dark gold with a small head. Nose show the same grassy and spicy hops as the regular Budvar, but loads more rich malt. Similar flavours, but the hops don't show as much. Very malty, hints of golden syrup and brown sugar. Very sweet. Nice syrupy body and moderate carbonation."
"I really didn't mind this. Simply put - a strong pils. That's what it is. Don't be surprised. A little less on the nose than I was hoping for but it wasn't unpleasant. Not as sweet as other high ABV lagers. Strong but palatable bitterness and a solid mouthfeel and finish. Pretty good."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and the taste, although this is a beer that really needs to be drank slowly given its strength."
"O: Good drinkability. Recommended"
"Not so good. Poured with a large off white head that quickly fades to almost zero and no lace. Color is a clear amber with small bubble trails. Aroma is malty and skunky ( green glass and I even got it towards the back of the cooler away from the fluorescent light). Flavor is a weird bitterness dominated by sweetness. Body is full and round and the carbonation while a bit fizzy does help cut the sweetness. Finish is sweet and that weird bitterness. Not for me. Alcky beer I think."
"D: Excellent, fantastic. Not particularly heavy for the alcohol content."
"D - Hard to drink, rather to heavy. Should be lighter. Hides its alcohol well though."
"Drinkability- I is not to bad. I am not drinking it like I would in my youth but it is an average beer for the most part."
"By the end, it's way too harsh and heavy, and it loses a great deal of its drinkability as a result."
"Suprisingly, and slightly dissapointedly, not a particulary stellar offering from Budvar. While I'll advocaate Pivovar Budvar to the death versus it's rival, I'll say that this beer is a possible ploy towards moving it's drinkers towards a market inflated by strong beers and a declination in quality. It's still a decent beer, but not something I'd regularly drink, especially because of the inflated price versus it's other, arguably higher quality, offerings. I'll recommend a try, but if you're in the Czech Republic and looking for a stronger beer, try some others like Svijany Baron or some by Pivovar Nachod."
"Try once just for the heck of it."
"(330 ml bottle, fresh from Praha/Prague). Golden colour, moderate head. Initially weak aroma, some alcoholic sweet and flowery notes come along. Flavour is quite malty for a pale lager, rather alcoholic but not unpleasant, warming mouthfeel. Not too sweet. OKish, but not great."
