"O: A very standard Euro Strong Lager."
"If I would rate this to style, I would give it probably a mean of 4, because it is well done. However, I do not get the idea of making such a strong beer with the limited possibilities to balance it provided by a pale lager. This style is not for me and I am definitely not going back to this."

"Alcohol and malt nose, with a little background grains. The mouth is in the style of the rest of the line Gordon, that is to say too much alcohol, so the other flavors, if any, of course, are completely overshadowed. There is also an excessive proportion of sugar. However, the aftertaste leaves some traces of peanuts, including nuts, on the tongue, which is a tad on the level of the beer."
"M/D: carbonation is fine, alcohol is to much in your face."
"Very good. I see all bad or average reviews for this beer which makes me think there is something wrong with me but I must say, I loved this beer."
"This brew pours a crystal clear gold color with a negligible head. Its aroma is very faint, with a touch of alcohol and a little malt and grain. Not much to be impressed with. The taste is intensely sweet, with a serious alcohol warming. The sweetness is not malt-like, but instead has a somewhat unpleasant sugary quality. It's a little cloying, but not quite as bad as the extra strong euro-lagers. The mouthfeel is moderately hefty, with a somewhat creamy texture. Not bad. All in all, though, this beer is not worth trying. Extremely disappointing."
"I guess this is a beer for people who want a buzz without having to pee a lot."
"Overall: an interesting beer. Quite drinkable as the alcohol is fairly well disguised. On the down side, it is too sweet, almost cloying on the palate."
"Interesting brew. Not a bad beer but not one I'll be racing back for."
"D= session if it's on-tap"
"Drinkability : an average beer in the lager style too strong !"
"Taste is a bit metalic, marzipan. Alcoholic, well balanced, but with some artificial flavour. Body is lighter than it used to be. Another one I remember being a better beer .some years ago. Disappointing."
"Had this brought back from Belgium. It pours a deep gold color with a medium-density, not too persistent head that leaves a bit of lace. Smells a bit of sour apples with a bit of pepper. Tastes of bananas, hops, with a honey finish and a sour aftertase. Its well-carbonated, which almost doesn't go with that honey. And oddly, although it tastes of honey, its not sweet at the end, which it seems it certainly should be. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, definitely thin for deep undertones the taste has. Drinkable? OK. You'd probably settle into the flavor after a couple but on the whole I think I'd go with something like Duvel instead."
"Sadly, this canned product was a total letdown, my two beautiful Thistle glasses (paid for, years ago in Belgium) will be used for other beers, I will not be trying this in a tinned form again."
"First time I got it was in a can, it was very strong and awful, it was wheater temperature. Then, I had it on bottle and was still strong and hard to swallow, the last time was in another bottle and was pretty soft, maybe the training changed the perception. THe colour is very golden, but something orange influences the final appearance. The foam is big and very white."
"A good beer, Iâ€™m satisfied."
"This is a beer that at 10% seems like it would be rough and hot. No, it really is quite a sooth ride with lots of malt and a bright finish. There are nunaces to this beer as more sips are taken but for the style this drinks all right. This was bought in the UK in Oct 2005"
"The belgian brewery john martin leader in it; offer this beer, an euro strong lager, abused on a corn starch, rice malt and hops, full blond color, good for mexican food and american and german cuisine, try with cheese and bbq. Enjoyit direct from the bottle; 90% recommended."
"Pours a clear deep gold under a one finger off-white head that lingers a bit and leaves a few spots of lace. The nose is surprisingly nice, with malt and spicey hops. The mouth is very prickly and quite light. The taste disappoints, though, dominated by a sickly sweet high alcohl taste above some bready malt and fairly harsh metallic hops. A dry bitter emerges in the finish and lingers long into the aftertaste. The brew is rough around the edges. There are better ways to get the alcohol."
