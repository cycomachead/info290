3.64,-2.2,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"A very odd beer. Pours a cloudy light brown with very little head. The smell is funky and raw, kind of musty. The taste is of something that's been sitting in a basement for 50 years or so, all decayed malt with some hints of hop shine long gone - but for all that, kind of interesting. The carbonation is all but gone, but it's lighter in the mouth than I'd expected. Again, an odd beer, but one that'd suit those who like old oddities.","gory4d","Jun 30, 2012"

4.15,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5," There is a nice flavor generated by the hops with a tea-like herbal and lemony taste. The malt is slightly toasty with gentle sweetish tinge which is characteristic of the pilsner malt with light bitter taste in the finish and very mild taste of alcohol. The drinkability is very high for the style -like an Imperial pils with smooth body and nice crrisp presence it is easy to drink for the amount of alcohol it contains and I would definitely order it again.","Slatetank","Dec 28, 2011"

The head was fluffy and white, once it settled the lacing stuck to the glass fairly well. The smell of the beer was hoppy, full of Nobel aromas. The taste of the beer wasn't the greatest but it was hoppy but still very earthy. The mouthfeel of this beer was on the heavier side which was interesting.

Poured with a decent foamy, frothy off white head that was short lived, some yeast sediment, and no lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is yeast, raisins, other fruit, malt. Flavor is like now but big raisin sweetness countering the tartness and yeast bitterness. No hop noticable anywhere. Body was full and thick with ok carbonation. Finish is like flavor and longish. Would like to try a good one.","drpimento","Aug 22, 2011"

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The carbonation seemed a little light during the pour, so I agitated it a bit to get a thick, short layer of whitish cap. Lots of sticky lacing and great head retention. The beer was a hazy lemon colour. Really fruity aroma up front, sort of like sweet tart candies, but this faded into a mix of grassy, lemony, spicy hops and pils malt. Hints of pineapple and honey. The flavour was good too, balanced bitterness with lots of fruity hops, some toasted malts, honey, and cereal. The texture was soft and velvety up front, lowish carbonation, medium bodied. Towards the finish, there were some solvent notes, stronger bitterness, mild spiciness and faint tropical fruits. Alcohol flavour and warmth were evident in the finish. Overall, pretty solid. Lots of hop character with some tasty malts -- you can't argue with that.","DrJay","Mar 25, 2011"

Nose is bursting with citrus, almost resembles Five Alive exactly. Lots of grassiness, and a hint of urine. Taste has more grassiness and citrusy, lemony and grassy hops. Some orange as well. Feels like someone has added alcohol to a glass of Five Alive, really. I can't get this comparison out of my head. Carbonation is high, fairly average mouthfeel. Bitterness, is short and lingers momentarily. No alcohol detectable in this. Interesting, but almost synthetic at times.","liamt07","Mar 14, 2011"

Very pale yellow beer, huge white head. Strong aroma of floral and herbal European hops, notes of grass and alcohol too. The flavour is sweet, hoppy and quite alcoholic.

3.97,6.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours the colour of peach juice and opaque with lees held in suspension. The head is just a little bit retentive but doesn't lace. A few chunky looking floaties can be seen in my glass. Powerfully aromatic and reminiscent of baked bread, freshly mown grass, lemon zest, and the florist shop down down the street. There's a hint of sulfur when first opened. Honeyed bread malt flavour with big noble hop character. The hop flavour is lemony and spicy with moderate bitterness and a little bit of linger. Unpleasantly boozy if it warms too much, I drank my first two bottles of this too warm and found myself dreading the third. After a month, here I am drinking the third one at a cooler temperature and finding it quite enjoyable. Full-bodied with somewhat low carbonation. Feels heavy. This is much better than my first impression of it. I'm still not sure if I want any more of it.

Pours to a cloudy yellow with a slight orange tint. Head is mostly white and very micro-bubble. Taste of this beer is heavenly. Silky smooth mouthfeel stands out right away. Taste is more bitter than malty and the AC is evident in the silky smoothness. The taste doesn't vary much and is quite consistent throughout, bitter with a piney-like finish. The mouth feel although it starts very viscous has good carbonation kicking in at the end for a nice sparkly yet bitter aftertaste. Pilsener? Woah. This is a good brew.

Pours a cloudy, hazed yellow with golden hues, one finger of white head, and spots of lacing on the lager glass. Smell and taste are sweet and grainy malts, honey, lemon, and grassy, bitter hops. Floral and doughy aromas develop as the beer warms. There's also a suggestion of lime. Super smooth mouth feel is medium-bodied, crisp and spicy, big hop bite on the back end, very refreshing.

3.49,-6.2,3,4,3,3.5,4,"Short swing top bottle pours a hazy light orange / brown color with an off white head that disappears shortly leaving moderate lacing. Smell is of wheat and slight alcohol. Taste is easy with slight hop bitterness but nothing outstanding. Alcohol does not stand out greatly but still present. Mouthfeel is light and easy with the most flavor hitting the back of the tongue. Smooth with medium to low carbonation. Drinkability is medium which follows with the beer in general. Medium ABV, medium carbonation, overall an average beer. Good but nothing amazing. An enjoyable brew nonetheless. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys stronger German lagers w/ hops.","BigDank","Oct 29, 2009"
3.73,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had a bottle for $7 at The Bookstore Speakeasy in Bethlehem, PA. I'd say this qualifies as an imperial pilsner. There's a big, caramel malt body upfront, followed by an earthy and heavy floral hop taste than rolls into a peppery orange peel finish. The hops are a little off balance, but this surprisingly fruity hopped up lager is worth a try for something different.","tempest","Beers"
3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste just slightly falls short of these expectations. The mouthfeel is full but not outstanding in any way, slight afteratset, coating. In all quite good","DerBayer","0"
3.33,-10.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall I don't have a lot of good things to say about this beer other than that it was interesting and I would not have guessed the 8.7% ABV. Worth a shot if you're curious.","glid02","Jul 27, 2009"
3.93,5.6,4.5,4,4,3,4,"I had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a glowing golden with a creamy white,thick head and excellent lacing. A very pretty beer. Smells very grainy, with a little banana, spice, and a fair dose of herbalness. Interesting. Tastes tangy with apple notes, caramel, and lots of herbs, followed by some grain and banana. Much bigger than usual for the style, and for that matter a very unusual interpretation of the style, but for all that fairly tasty. The mouthfeel is both spritzy and a bit grainy, and the combination is a bit offputting. Could be a little less sharp and a lot less grainy in the mouth. Interesting beer, but this certainly wouldn't be my go-to Pilsner.","Georgiabeer","Jul 26, 2009"
2.88,-22.6,4,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Too big for its own good. I can see the attempt. The brewery wanted to make a big good lager with a ton of nobel hops. While I salute the endeavor, something didn't go right. I admit the possibility that something could be wrong with this particular bottle, but I have no reason to think it's been poorly handled or anything. At any rate, it tastes like a cheap strong Euro lager or even an American malt liquor (and I dearly apologize to the Christoffel brewers who are probably very nice gentlemen who know a ton about beer and brewing). There's just a mildly stomach-turning flavor to that sweet malt married to a lager yeast that kills it for me. The boatload of metallic nobel hops don't bring enough spice for me, although there is a relatively nice grassy quality in there. There's a funny, thick aftertaste that I don't particularly care for, as well. The feel isn't bad, but it's hard for me to get past the flavor. As a sidenote, this beer tastes little to nothing like any Czech Pilsener that I've ever tasted. Anyway, it's another beer that I'd love to give a second chance particularly if I ever find myself at the brewery.","popery","Jun 30, 2009"
3.33,-10.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's not the best pilsener out there but it's one that packs a good punch.","TheManiacalOne","May 10, 2009"
3.91,5.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours rich, dark gold color with good head retention and lots of sticky lacing all around. I don't get a lot on the nose, just some light honey and biscuit aroma. While the flavors generally replicate the nose, there is a lot more flavor, with some moderate sweetness and a kiss of hoppy bitterness in the finish. This beer is very smooth on the palate, and is very easy to drink. The alcohol is a bit much for a pilsner, IMO, but for all that, drinkability is still pretty good.","John_M","Dec 31, 2008"
3.54,-4.8,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"Oddly, a barnyard aroma and served way too cold, found at Smokeless Joe's, expirey date December 2010. Peachy colour with pretty white soapy head and instant thick white lace. You have to appreciate the taste for what it is, a lot of nobel hops. For that it is good. Green grassy notes. Above average mouthfeel. Walk away, make cell calls and then as it room temperatures, it is better.","Sammy","Beers"
4.62,24.2,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth and there is a light sweetness to the beer. Aftertaste is lingering bitter and raw hoppy.","Absumaster","0"
