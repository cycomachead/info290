1,-59,,,,,,"Une bière sans personnalité,  dont l'unique intérêt serait le haut degré d'alcool. Mais l'argument ne convaincra que les alcooliques car pour le reste elle est totalement déséquilibrée.  Trop de sucres residuels, un goût désagréable et un arrière-goût carrement infect. A éviter.","Pinchart","Nov 02, 2014"

Take an average Euro pale lager and dump a double shot of 100 proof vodka into it before taking a sip; you will end up with this beer. Even if you just want to get drunk there are better options. I honestly had a hard time finishing this.","Raven3464","Aug 14, 2012"

1.7,-30.3,4,1.5,1,3,2,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. It had a nice color with a good froth and head over it. The aromas and corresponding taste were borderline offensive. As it warms these actually even out a bit and the maladies subside temporarily. The abv is over the top and is not hidden well. They should reevaluate the recipe and then worry about making something more over the top.","TheBrewo","Jan 20, 2010"
2.3,-5.7,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Nose quite fresh and sweet, slightly relieved by sugar alcohol. Mouth syrupy sweet enough to taste but with a touch of warmth without doubt due to alcohol. Also sweet, it feels a little orange syrup aftertaste, it can quickly become sickening. But for beer to 12 °, it does not really and can be drunk easily. A good point in that direction. But one bad point for the few flavors available and a sickening body quickly such as a poor quality alcohol.","ThaCreep","Jul 18, 2009"
2.3,-5.7,3,3,2,3,1.5,"Had this in Barcelpona with Maria and Zacca. Poured with a decent off white foamy, frothy head and lots of lace. Color was a clear amber. Aroma was malty, honey with a hint of skunk. Flavor was dominated by heavy sweet alcohol. Body wasnk't bad. Finish is the same as flavor. Way too sweet and boozy. One was more than enough, thank you.","drpimento","Dec 10, 2008"
1.15,-52.9,1.5,1.5,1,1,1,"You know those flavoured water drinks. They're just water with the 'essence of strawberry' or 'essence of orange' or some kind of fruit. Well, this beer is like that. Except it tastes like vodka with the essence of beer. Awful, just awful.","EskimoDave","Dec 09, 2008"

3.08,26.2,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"I'm usually a fan of strong beers, but this one really misses the mark. It's a stron brew, alright, but it lacks the flavor and complexity that I find engaging in other strong beers. It's pale and limp, with a s fair clarity. The smell leaves little to describe, except for some ethanol and a bit of grain. The flavor is a bit harsh, but under the alcohol is a bit of malt and a little bitter hops. The beer is of medium body, and fairly low carbonation. This brew didn't excite me at all.","Suds","May 28, 2007"
2.48,1.6,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Smell, where's the smell? Apart of detergents with pine or lemon or whater aroma they had, nothing. Flavor, only alcohol. Mouth is again alcohol, though I can even notice something hot, kind of pepper. And that's all. It's not the worst beer I've had, but I find it just artificial and not much interesting, unless you want to get drunk quickly, and even if that's the case, I wouldn't take more than one or two before going to a lighter one.","janubio","Mar 14, 2007"
2.06,-15.6,3,2,2,2,2,"33cl bottle: This one pours an absolutely clear golden color with a bit of a white head on it. The head drops off rather quickly, despite some fizziness. The aroma is thinner, with some fruit and alcohol notes. Some malty smell also. The taste is rather harsh, although somewhat sweet. There is also alcohol up front. Some malt notes. Overall, this is not offensive, but not very good either. I feel that the only purpose of this brew is to get you trashed.","Boto","Jan 12, 2007"
3.33,36.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I wouldn't recommend this as an everyday beer, but it is really not that bad, and interesting to see how these brewers (whose other beers I admire quite a lot) managed to come up with a drinkable 12% offering. That's really impressive, and I think one should at least try it to see how masterfully this was done.","Socrates","Oct 21, 2006"

2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A neat looking label. Hesitant because of previous things I'd heard about this one, but gave it a fair, objective shot - and was, pleasantly not poisoned. While far from anything of quality, it managed to keep itself well beyond the realm of under-the-sink cleaning products. Alcohol, at an alarming 12%, stayed surprisingly hidden, or at least nondestructive to the beer. It's real shortcoming would fall in a simple lack of taste and aroma. An acceptable draft at the style, but lacking in the finer touches. Flavour offers little interest or complexity, equally can be said for the aroma. Both, present, but void. It managed to produce some head over the clouded (unhealthy looking) yellow appearance. In the end, I can say with some truth that I didn't mind this one; well, in all honesty I've had worse anyhow...","biegaman","Jun 30, 2005"

1.53,-37.3,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"The beer itself is a deep golden brown color with low carbonation, and a poorly retained head of off white. The smell is of corn syrup and grain alcohol. The taste is of a very thick malt base, without nuance or flavor. Tastes like an overblown bock with some raw vodka or some other distilled spirit added. Mouthfeel is sometimes cloying, and thoroughly dissatisfying. Drinkability? I don't know. For being a get drunk beer (this is obviously it's only purpose as the taste will attest) you'd think they'd put it in a can. The little 8 ounce bottle should not fool you into thinking that you've bought something decent. Really, quite bad.","99bottles","Aug 02, 2004"
1.06,-56.6,2,1,1,1,1,"OK, here's my story. I was in Florence, Italy, last spring, without a clue on how to find any decent Italian beer, and I ran across this in a convenience store. I didn't have my reading glasses, and the label looked interesting. When I got back to the hotel, I finally was able to read 12% ABV, and I knew I was in trouble with this one. 8 months later, I fianlly get the nerve to try it. I should have left it in the hotel room. This is only 8+ ounces, and it's about 6 ounces too many. It looked like a slightly dark version of BMC, had little or no aroma, but it's all about the flavor. The vodka/rocket fuel flavor that burned my mouth on the way down. My (non-beer drinking) friend took a sip after I warned her, and it's a good thing she's still my friend. I think this is the worst beer I've ever had, because it isn't beer (no matter how they made it). The only reason I see for this beer is as a quick way to get drunk. No thank you.","Dukeofearl","May 02, 2004"
1.23,-49.6,2,1.5,1,1.5,1,"Oh my, I remember that beer from many many years ago. The color wasnt very distinct at all. But, I do remember how it felt! It was an attrocious experience, I took that beer one evening before going out. Poored it, smelled very alcoholic. Tasted mettalic, strong, so strong it had no taste, and it was at the good temperature. It was like having a beer /strong alcohol shooter at once. There many beer with 12% that are sweet, but this one wasnt, it gave me stomachaches for the rest of the day!","3Vandoo","Oct 29, 2002"

1.43,-41.4,2.5,2,1,1,1.5,"Golden yellowish color with a white head that does not last and all traces of lace vanish.  The smell is all alcohol and the taste is the same.  With a strong beer I like a small amount of alcohol in the flavor and nose but this is overpowering with no other real characteristics.  The French gave this kind of a thick feel in the mouth with a bit of a burn on the throat.  I paid 5€ for three 8oz bottles, definitely not worth it when I can buy Tennents Strong Lager for half of that if the mood for a quick buzz arises.  I will probably never buy this beer again.  Not Impressed!","Sheldon","Jun 20, 2002"
