"Good Imperial Pilsner, rather malty, its hops, though very present, they seem to contribute more on its flavor and aroma than its bitterness. Well executed brew that grows overtime. They were able to make an Imperial Pilsner that is more accepted by beginners and still satisfying for the initiated."

"A very odd beer. Pours a cloudy light brown with very little head. The smell is funky and raw, kind of musty. The taste is of something that's been sitting in a basement for 50 years or so, all decayed malt with some hints of hop shine long gone - but for all that, kind of interesting. The carbonation is all but gone, but it's lighter in the mouth than I'd expected. Again, an odd beer, but one that'd suit those who like old oddities."

"O - Not overly enjoyable, though not terrible. I certainly wouldn't buy it again. I suspect the fact that this was an older bottle might have skewed the review a bit, but it was rather disappointing."
"However . . . If I was in a small Dutch village for the night I could get merrily drunk on this beer!"
" There is a nice flavor generated by the hops with a tea-like herbal and lemony taste. The malt is slightly toasty with gentle sweetish tinge which is characteristic of the pilsner malt with light bitter taste in the finish and very mild taste of alcohol. The drinkability is very high for the style -like an Imperial pils with smooth body and nice crrisp presence it is easy to drink for the amount of alcohol it contains and I would definitely order it again."

"O: It started off very interesting, but then turned as boring as most Euro Strong Lagers."

"This brew poured out as a hazy looking golden color with a some sediment floating around in there. The head was fluffy and white, once it settled the lacing stuck to the glass fairly well. The smell of the beer was hoppy, full of Nobel aromas. The taste of the beer wasn't the greatest but it was hoppy but still very earthy. The mouthfeel of this beer was on the heavier side which was interesting. Overall I think this beer is a little bit better than most typicval Euro Strong Lagers, however I don't see myself having to buy it again."
"Think I might’ve gotten a bum one here. I let this warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a decent foamy, frothy off white head that was short lived, some yeast sediment, and no lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is yeast, raisins, other fruit, malt. Flavor is like now but big raisin sweetness countering the tartness and yeast bitterness. No hop noticable anywhere. Body was full and thick with ok carbonation. Finish is like flavor and longish. Would like to try a good one."
"This beer is fantastic. I want to go back to the restaurant right now just to get another one. I just got back from that place."
"Decent enough, but not something I'd ever want to drink again."
"Cloudy yellowish amber.White crown dense & thick.Nice lacing left.Perfumed hop & fresh fruit aromas.Sharp & dry bitterness.Alcoholic presence is felt.Oily,resiny & woody finish.Medium body but a little fat in mouth.Drinkability is ok."
"O: The beer is rather easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"No reference point for this style, but I bizarrely enjoyed this much more than expected."
"O - Interesting taste, a little too dry for my liking. The herbal flavours start creeping in as the beer warms. Nice to try but the bitterness would put me off drinking any more of these."
"Edit... after reading what a strong lager actually is, I can not even compare this to what is listed. this is hands down the best strong lager."
"Pours a cloudy dark gold with a finger of thick white head leaving heavy white lace down the glass. Very nice distinct noble hop aroma and flavor. Spicy and herbal. Lots of alcohol on this one, too. The 8.7% abv really comes through. Warming, yet refreshing- a nice “Nobel” brew."
"Overall - nothing i would buy or try again, this beer didnt do it for me."
"Overall- A nice strong euro that is a nice step away from my normal pick of brews, would I go out and drink this one again? Probably not, but it was still worth a try and a nice offering from this Dutch brewer."
"Excellent and easy to drink despite the high ABV."
"Good clean crisp flavor, again grass and clean crisp metalic bitterness. This a fine pilsner in my opinion. I know they say its a lager, but it drinks like a fine pilsner. Maybe an Imperial with the high ABV, but it drinks really well so watch out for that high ABV."
"Overall a tasty beer with great mouthfeel and appearance. Exceeded my expectations. Would class this more along the line of an Imperial pils."
"The carbonation seemed a little light during the pour, so I agitated it a bit to get a thick, short layer of whitish cap. Lots of sticky lacing and great head retention. The beer was a hazy lemon colour. Really fruity aroma up front, sort of like sweet tart candies, but this faded into a mix of grassy, lemony, spicy hops and pils malt. Hints of pineapple and honey. The flavour was good too, balanced bitterness with lots of fruity hops, some toasted malts, honey, and cereal. The texture was soft and velvety up front, lowish carbonation, medium bodied. Towards the finish, there were some solvent notes, stronger bitterness, mild spiciness and faint tropical fruits. Alcohol flavour and warmth were evident in the finish. Overall, pretty solid. Lots of hop character with some tasty malts -- you can't argue with that."
"Thanks, Sammy!"
"Pours a pale orangish-yellow, unfiltered and almost hefeweizen-like in appearance. Less than a finger of thick white head, lots of lace and decent retention. Nose is bursting with citrus, almost resembles Five Alive exactly. Lots of grassiness, and a hint of urine. Taste has more grassiness and citrusy, lemony and grassy hops. Some orange as well. Feels like someone has added alcohol to a glass of Five Alive, really. I can't get this comparison out of my head. Carbonation is high, fairly average mouthfeel. Bitterness, is short and lingers momentarily. No alcohol detectable in this. Interesting, but almost synthetic at times."
"With this being readily available and fairly cheap I pick this up every once ina while and I'll always enjoy it. Listing as a Lager strikes me as being odd. This seems more like a Belgian style IPA."
"D: This is a conundrum - a tasty and somewhat unique beer, but one I probably wont seek out again."
"Not bad sweetness could be an issue."
"good carbonation and found it to be really drinkable for the alc. %."
"Well balanced flavours and lingering finish that is both sweet yet bitter. Delightfully dry hopped, leaning towards my personal APA preferences, and definitely a beer I'll purchase again."
"Pours a hazy pale gold colour, soapy white head and no lace to speak of. Smells of malt and not really much else, faint alcohol, some dry hops are noticeable, it is clean smelling but nothing special. Taste is malty, grassy, dry-leafy hops, finishes dry with earthy tones. Solid weight and mouthfeel, crisp with OK carbonation. ABV in this isn't noticeable and drinks pretty good but I probably will save the 3 bucks next time and pass on this one."
"I really wish the lcbo would bring in less mediocre Euro-trash when there are so many good beers from other provinces and across the border available. I'm done with this brewery now."
"Drink - This beer just didn't do it for me. It was okay but there lots of other beers I would have rather been drinking."
"D - It's a fairly pleasant way to tick the Euro Strong Lager category, but I probably won't bother with this one unless I could verify freshness. Perhaps it will show up on-tap somewhere in the future."
"D - Not a bad beer for a changeup, not exactly sure what to make of the style, it's kind of odd, but solid."
"The best way I can describe this beer is a doppelbock made with very light malts with a touch of Belgian blonde ale. Extremely unique and pretty interesting. Not sure if I'm crazy about it, but drinkable."
"This monstrosity should have never, ever made it into bottles. Nice aroma, but overall, a terrible beer."
"The abv makes this a beer for only 1 or 2 bottle, or glasses. But very enjoyable."
"D - This is, in my opinion, a really, really enjoyable pilsner. I think the age really muted the ABV on this. This would be a refreshing beer at 6%, let along 8.7%! I'll definately be buying this again and sharing with friends."
"D - Decent beer but the overtly boozy flavours on my tongue ruins this one for me."
"It would be easy to suggest this beer with pub fare or BBQ, but I actually think that it is lacking the caramel and charred flavors to properly match BBQ, and it is a bit to bitter and tart for pub far. I would really enjoy the Nobel alone and allow it to quench you fully; and it will."
"Granted this bottle is probably 3-6 months old so perhaps there was some more hopping originally.... as is, this is a miss."
"D: Enjoyable, but the ABV hinders this beer."
"Taste, again, minimal hops despite advertising itself otherwise. Does have a nice bitterness that lingers that is unique. Dry. Impressed how well the alcohol was hidden. Seems to havce too much flavor for a pilsner, this is one of those exceptions I guess. Geez, if they really delivered as promised with the hops, this would be a great, not just good beer."
"D - This beer would be alot easier to drink if the alcohol were masked by a more generous dose of hops but I could definately see myself getting through a few in a night without any problems."
"330 ml swingtop bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. Dry hopped, unfiltered, unpasteurised, bottom fermented, classic open fermentation. ABV is 8.7%. Very pale yellow beer, huge white head. Strong aroma of floral and herbal European hops, notes of grass and alcohol too. The flavour is sweet, hoppy and quite alcoholic. Strong and sweet pale lagers rarely ""go home"" with me, and this one is no exception, even though it is much better than its more industrial counterparts."
"I tried this beer on April 30, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy golden orange, with a thick fluffy white head. The aroma was grainy malt, and a piney hoppish note. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was grainy malt, some citrusy lemon notes, and a hoppy bitter finish"
"This beer is definitely some very tasty stuff with a heavy yeast component and welcome blast of hop spice that is accompanied by a nice round body for the style (?? I guess my experience with triple lagers is pretty minimal though). Highly recommended."
"This is a seductive imperial pilsner with no hint of its strength in the flavor profile. I understand why the 330ml bottle ...this is so smooth and tasty you'd like to session it but beware. This kicks Duvel's ass for flavor and drinkability."
"Poured a murky sorta lemon tea-like color with a fluffy one finger white head atop.Big nobel hop aromas,spicy and leafy,honey malt notes as well.Flavors are quite yeasty with the honey malt making its self known from the get go,a blast of the noble hops give a spicy,herbal finish.Goes down well for how hefty it is,flavorful and chuck full of hop goodness,a really nice lager beer.In some way it reminds me of the Sam Adams Hallertau big pilsner with its big raw hoppiness,and yeasty flavors."
"Bottle pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a couple fingers of head. The taste is of grassy like hops with some honey lingering in the background. Considering its 8%, this went down pretty smooth and I didn't taste any of the abv%. A pretty solid pilsner overall."
"Good stuff."
"Overall, a tasty option when yearning for 1 or 2 pints of something relatively light but flavourful in this warmer weather. Especially given the reasonable pricepoint at the LCBO, will definitely reach for this semi-regularly throughout the summer months."
"Pours the colour of peach juice and opaque with lees held in suspension. The head is just a little bit retentive but doesn't lace. A few chunky looking floaties can be seen in my glass. Powerfully aromatic and reminiscent of baked bread, freshly mown grass, lemon zest, and the florist shop down down the street. There's a hint of sulfur when first opened. Honeyed bread malt flavour with big noble hop character. The hop flavour is lemony and spicy with moderate bitterness and a little bit of linger. Unpleasantly boozy if it warms too much, I drank my first two bottles of this too warm and found myself dreading the third. After a month, here I am drinking the third one at a cooler temperature and finding it quite enjoyable. Full-bodied with somewhat low carbonation. Feels heavy. This is much better than my first impression of it. I'm still not sure if I want any more of it. I think I'd rather wait for the Christoffel Blonde/Bier the LCBO is carrying this summer."
"There's no doubt Christoffel make quality products, and while this lager is well in excess of the ABV I'd usually drink for the style, I found it to be a pleasant experience. Would I buy again? Probably not, but I won't rule it out. Definitely worth trying."
"Definitely an interesting Pilsener and certainly not Christ-awful as its name would suggest, though I feel this brew does present some flaws. I can't claim this to be all too drinkable; it's a sipper at best. I can't see myself ever wanting more than one bottle of this and don't think I'll be buying it again. Of the two Pilseners sampled here, I'd have to say I definitely prefer the original, Pilsener Urquell."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but carbonation is a little lacking. Drinkability is only average due to the alcohol."
"I can't say I'm a huge fan overall. For one thing, it doesn't really know if it's a strong pilsener or a strong Belgian pale. There are characters of both here and they clash more than a little. It doesn't have the body for a Belgian Strong or Belgian IPA, nor does it have the crisp drinkability of a good highly-hopped pilsener. It takes the middle ground, and as a result ends up being pretty average."
"Cool 12 oz swing top bottle. Nice pssst on popping the top. This brew smells like exotic fruits, maracuya and pitaya and with dry and pungent hopping. Pours to a cloudy yellow with a slight orange tint. Head is mostly white and very micro-bubble. Taste of this beer is heavenly. Silky smooth mouthfeel stands out right away. Taste is more bitter than malty and the AC is evident in the silky smoothness. The taste doesn't vary much and is quite consistent throughout, bitter with a piney-like finish. The mouth feel although it starts very viscous has good carbonation kicking in at the end for a nice sparkly yet bitter aftertaste. Pilsener? Woah. This is a good brew. I think this would make a great pairing with spicy seafood."
"D: I enjoy this one quite a bit. I couldn't imagine this is a pilsener though to me it tastes like an IPA. Smooth and easy to drink and the alcohol is not noticeable at all."
"Nice spritzy, carbonated feel and overall very refreshing, especially for the 8.7% alcohol. One of the best pilseners I've had, very unique. I would try this again for sure."
"What a smack upside the senses! Definitely a surprise - tasty and big, but balanced all around, and given the near 9 points of ABV, would suggest more of an Imperial (Czech) Pilsener..."
"D - Very drinkable, interesting and tasty brew. Well done."
"This is very easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden. Very easy to drink with its fairly high carbonation, frothy body, light and airy, very crisp and dry. A great drink that would pair lovely with a ricotta and spinach lasagna/ pasta dish with a tomato based sauce."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty damn smooth for its ABV, some warmth going down. Nice stuff."
"If you want a hopped up, big alcohol, imperial pilsener, this is a great beer."
"330ml bottle from the LCBO. Part of the Spring 2010 Beer Release. Pours a cloudy, hazed yellow with golden hues, one finger of white head, and spots of lacing on the lager glass. Smell and taste are sweet and grainy malts, honey, lemon, and grassy, bitter hops. Floral and doughy aromas develop as the beer warms. There's also a suggestion of lime. Super smooth mouth feel is medium-bodied, crisp and spicy, big hop bite on the back end, very refreshing. IBUs cling to the palate. Booze warms the insides but I can't detect it in the flavour. A kick ass Czech pilsner packed with Noble hop goodness."
"Not a bad little brew; I quite enjoyed it. Certainly threw off my perceptions of a pilsner. Strong, but the alcohol indetectible, making this a dangerous beer. A good sipper, but the ABV and the sweetness reduces its drinkability. Worth a go."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy bright yellow color beer with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some dry Noble hops notes. Taste is also a somewhat unbalanced mix between some dry hopped Saaz and some overly sweet malt notes with a hint of cereal. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I kinda like the idea of a hoppier Christoffel but just too sweet for my taste buds."
"Overall a nice smelling beer that tastes okay, but nothing worth seeking out or repeating for me unless I could try it fresh."
"I glass is fine for me, this is a tough beer. I'd definitely recommend it though."
"If this beer displayed a better head with a good amount of retention and lace, it would be outstanding. But of course, the appearance doesn't take away from the taste and smell, and that's where this beer really stands out. I can't believe this is 8.7% ABV, there's nothing about this beer that would indicate such a high alcohol content. Well worth a try, especially if you're in to pilsners."
"If hops and alcohol were people and this beer a bed, it would be like trying to cram a dozen bodies into a twin. I don't know what gave this Dutch brewery the idea to dry-hop their pilsner and then double-down on the alcohol, but I'm glad they went ahead with it. It wasn't an easy experiment to pull off but they did it. Good work Christoffel."
"Drinkability: I found it adequate. For better or worse, it's a beer that goes beyond the boundaries of the style."
"This beer is surprisingly smooth. There is no hint of alcohol in the flavor at all. There is no aftertaste, just smoothness throughout. There is some malt sweetness on the front of the mouth, but overall the drinkability and mouthfeel are really high. I would recommend this beer to everyone."
"Short swing top bottle pours a hazy light orange / brown color with an off white head that disappears shortly leaving moderate lacing. Smell is of wheat and slight alcohol. Taste is easy with slight hop bitterness but nothing outstanding. Alcohol does not stand out greatly but still present. Mouthfeel is light and easy with the most flavor hitting the back of the tongue. Smooth with medium to low carbonation. Drinkability is medium which follows with the beer in general. Medium ABV, medium carbonation, overall an average beer. Good but nothing amazing. An enjoyable brew nonetheless. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys stronger German lagers w/ hops."
"Had a bottle for $7 at The Bookstore Speakeasy in Bethlehem, PA. I'd say this qualifies as an imperial pilsner. There's a big, caramel malt body upfront, followed by an earthy and heavy floral hop taste than rolls into a peppery orange peel finish. The hops are a little off balance, but this surprisingly fruity hopped up lager is worth a try for something different."
"The taste just slightly falls short of these expectations. The mouthfeel is full but not outstanding in any way, slight afteratset, coating. In all quite good"
"Overall I don't have a lot of good things to say about this beer other than that it was interesting and I would not have guessed the 8.7% ABV. Worth a shot if you're curious."
"I had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a glowing golden with a creamy white,thick head and excellent lacing. A very pretty beer. Smells very grainy, with a little banana, spice, and a fair dose of herbalness. Interesting. Tastes tangy with apple notes, caramel, and lots of herbs, followed by some grain and banana. Much bigger than usual for the style, and for that matter a very unusual interpretation of the style, but for all that fairly tasty. The mouthfeel is both spritzy and a bit grainy, and the combination is a bit offputting. Could be a little less sharp and a lot less grainy in the mouth. Interesting beer, but this certainly wouldn't be my go-to Pilsner."
"Too big for its own good. I can see the attempt. The brewery wanted to make a big good lager with a ton of nobel hops. While I salute the endeavor, something didn't go right. I admit the possibility that something could be wrong with this particular bottle, but I have no reason to think it's been poorly handled or anything. At any rate, it tastes like a cheap strong Euro lager or even an American malt liquor (and I dearly apologize to the Christoffel brewers who are probably very nice gentlemen who know a ton about beer and brewing). There's just a mildly stomach-turning flavor to that sweet malt married to a lager yeast that kills it for me. The boatload of metallic nobel hops don't bring enough spice for me, although there is a relatively nice grassy quality in there. There's a funny, thick aftertaste that I don't particularly care for, as well. The feel isn't bad, but it's hard for me to get past the flavor. As a sidenote, this beer tastes little to nothing like any Czech Pilsener that I've ever tasted. Anyway, it's another beer that I'd love to give a second chance particularly if I ever find myself at the brewery."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's not the best pilsener out there but it's one that packs a good punch."
"The beer pours rich, dark gold color with good head retention and lots of sticky lacing all around. I don't get a lot on the nose, just some light honey and biscuit aroma. While the flavors generally replicate the nose, there is a lot more flavor, with some moderate sweetness and a kiss of hoppy bitterness in the finish. This beer is very smooth on the palate, and is very easy to drink. The alcohol is a bit much for a pilsner, IMO, but for all that, drinkability is still pretty good."
"Oddly, a barnyard aroma and served way too cold, found at Smokeless Joe's, expirey date December 2010. Peachy colour with pretty white soapy head and instant thick white lace. You have to appreciate the taste for what it is, a lot of nobel hops. For that it is good. Green grassy notes. Above average mouthfeel. Walk away, make cell calls and then as it room temperatures, it is better."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and there is a light sweetness to the beer. Aftertaste is lingering bitter and raw hoppy."
