2.3,-5.3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"OVERALL: Not as good as their Admiral. Stronger with more sweet malt flavors, but without the hop bitterness to act as balance. Yeah, there's a lot of flavor, but not flavor that make me want to go back for more.","Jeffo","May 13, 2013"

2.73,12.3,4,3.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the appearance. The head actually showed nice retention and color, making the beer seem rather inviting. It really fell apart from there, as the flavoring was intensely sweet. There was actually a benefit to this in that it helped to mask the alcohol pretty well. Other than that it decimated all other traces of flavoring and overwhelmed the drinker.","TheBrewo","Nov 28, 2011"
