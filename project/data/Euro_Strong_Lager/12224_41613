3.2,-1.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Out of a bottle this beer was bright yellow color with lots of rising carbonation. The retention was so-so and the lacing light. The aroma was of sweet malt, adjunct grains and a strong note of booze. The flavors were similar, boozy and bold with lots of adjunct grains and some sweet malt that tried to blanket the wallop of high-impact ALC content. Punchy, but little more. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation levels about right. Perhaps I’m being a bit strong, but I kept thinking “Euro malt liquor for euro-trash types.”","thekevlarkid","Dec 21, 2011"
3.27,0.3,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear deep straw yellow, little head and little retention, to be expected with a beer of such strength. Aroma of toffee, apricot, alcohol, and honeyed breads. In the taste, buttery toffee, mild bitterness, spent grains, light malts. Has a mildy fruity aspect, but mainly buttery, grainy and some booze. Not at all unpleasant, which is quite the achievement for a cheap import malt liqour style lager. Overall, not a bad brew that does its job. A Lithuanian brewer worthy of respect.","Stinkypuss","Mar 31, 2011"
4.52,38.7,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This shit is awesome! I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. Don't hesitate to try this. I paid $1.79 and got a better value and taste and buzz than any kind of American malt liquor. Great beer. Familiar taste that I can't place -- but alcohol is well-hidden.","MarkBlackout","Jan 20, 2011"
2.13,-34.7,2.5,2,2,3,2,"Topping off at a 9.5abv isn't too bad of a eye catcher for someone who likes strong beers. I feel that for the strength that this beer packed that it should be more than just a Lager. The flavors are a little too boozie and there doesn't seem to be much balance in the whole thing. The beer is a golden color with a little bit of head. The taste a little sour, kinda strange. It's not the most refeshing brew out there in my opinion.","Knapp85","Mar 03, 2010"
2.9,-11,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Honey golden with a fizzy off-white head that quickly shrinks to a film. Odd cinnamon and fermented apple notes in the aroma. Wow you gotta love Lithuanian Malt Liquor to enjoy Zhiguly Grande because that is exactly what it is, a high octane pale lager. ""The most heating and famous beer of beer country!"" is proudly displayed on the bottle. The flavor is cidery and strong with plenty of fusel alcohol for a decent burn on the way down. Full bodied, borderline syrupy mouthfeel. This one is tough to drink.","biggred1","Feb 01, 2010"
2.63,-19.3,3.5,3,2,3,3,"It is a high octane brew, it seems like a strong ale in a lager's suit.","crossovert","Jul 05, 2009"
3.35,2.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: highly drinkable for its ABV. This is kind of the Night Train of beer: relatively sweet and mostly inoffensive with a felony-inducing alcohol kick. Am I weird for rating this above average?","flagmantho","Apr 24, 2009"
3.58,9.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I believe I like this beer a lot more than any other reviewer so far. I was absolutely surprised and it was truly unexpected. Would recommend to anyone.","Psilo707","Aug 03, 2008"
2.98,-8.6,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Picked up a bottle for $3 at Blanchard's in Allston. Poured into a wide mouthed lager glass. Yellowish orange in color. Moderate carbonation. Decent sized head, but faded quickly. Small amount of very fine particles at the bottom of the glass. Unusual for a lager. Smelled a lot like an adjunct lager, with corn noticeable right up front. Very thick mouthfeel, which was not what I prefer in a lager. A few things make this beer hard to drink: thick aftertaste, the oversized bottle, and uncharacteristicly high abv. Do not let this beer get warm, as it does not improve. I was interested in trying a lager hovering near 10% abv. Now I can see why many brewers don't attempt this -- it just turns out mediocre.","morebeergood","Jul 30, 2008"
2.83,-13.2,3.5,3,3,3,2,"I really don't get a lot of flavor here but what flavor I do get is very grainy and just a little caramel malty . You really can't taste the alcohol here so this must be a pretty good beer.","peabody","Mar 16, 2008"
3.97,21.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D: very drinkable for 9.4% but I think one will do the trick for me. very interesting and enjoyable. the best euro strong lager I have had.","paulthebeerguru","Beers"
3.7,13.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable. I was expecting the taste of a macro lager with a shot of vodka, but this beer is actually very refreshing and refined. Within this style of beers, in ranks near the top for me.","IPAcraig","0"
