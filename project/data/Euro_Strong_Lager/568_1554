3.05,2.7,3.5,2.75,3,3.25,3.25,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden straw amber with a two finger white head that dissipates quickly to a thick cap with heavy lacing. Aroma malty; bready malt, slightly sour and grainy. Similar to a somewhat soured bock. Flavor is sweet malt, grain and adjuncts, hints of apple juice and diacetyl. Hints of hops and oxidation in the finish. Mild flavor does not quite cover the alcohol, tasting like a fortified light bock. Light bodied with decent carbonation. This can is also labled "Malt Liquor" obviously for the US market and that is actually a good description. This tastes like a slightly maltier adjunct lager fortified for getting a buzz. Except for the diacetyl, no real off flavors, but nothing much to recommend it either. A cheap, fortified lager. Needed to tick this brewery and style. Done and moving on.","LiquidAmber","Jan 15, 2014"

Large amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is not as impressive as the appearance. It is grainy, sweet malt, and just a faint wisp of hops. The beer comes back to life in taste. Not too sweet with a decent amount of hops to balance things out. Almost has a clean finish but there is a little lingering astringency. Otherwise has the Polish lager taste. The body is light despite the elevated ABV. Good carbonation that is far from harsh. I think I picked this bottle up right after it got off the truck at the store. So it may of benefited by being as fresh as an import could be. Add some more hops and this beer could be something really good.","morimech","May 09, 2010"

3.07,3.4,3.5,4,3,3,2,"Par for the course for the style: golden body with an upward torrent of big, soda-like bubbles and an active, fizzy white head with not-too-bad retention. Smell is noticeably full of alcohol, but in a kinda nice tripel-like way; in fact, there is some delicate fruitiness and a nice fresh grain aroma here that is quite Belgian in character. Apples and pears flesh out the predominantly sweet nose; hops are basically undetectable. The taste is rather sweet, too, and boozy. There is a little nuance, but of course the problem with this style is that it was basically developed to try and answer the demand for beer that will get you drunk fast, slake your thirst, and cost you next to nothing - nuance doesn't really factor into it. So for what it is, it's not bad; off flavors are kept to a minimum, and while the alcohol is noticeable, it's not too hot. Hops are too timid, though; a bit more oomph from them and they could help balance out the sugars. The same goes for carbonation; it's too soft. More sparkle would help keep this refreshing. Overall, like most strong lagers like this, there isn't much point to this beer - Duvel, for example, is stronger, more delicious, more nuanced, more refreshing, and (this is key), not very much more expensive. So why waste your time?","soulgrowl","May 17, 2009"

2.31,-22.2,2,1,3,2.5,2.5,"It says "malt liquor" right under the "MOCNE" on the bottle so I wasn't expecting a refined brew. The initial impression is of a thin, weak brew with very little lace and rapidly retreating bubbles. The taste is surprisingly approachable for a malt liquor with a strong wheat maltiness that satisfies a thirsty palate. The deeper flavor veers toward apply and sour, but the aftertaste loses the rawer tones, helping disguise the 7% ABV. Unfortunately, the whole experience is crippled by the ever-present aroma of raw alcohol...ultimately, the bouquet more than anything batters what could have been a decent high-alcohol sour lager.","Brandegee","Jul 23, 2008"

It had a solid lightly sour aroma of apple juice, malted grains, and a dash of pepper at the end. I don't know how you could make apple juice sour. They did it! The taste was thin and weak with sweet malted grains, more apple juice, crispy herbal hops, and then all of these "great" flavors ended with some malted wheat. I know the mouthfeel was weak and light, but I did enjoy the aftertaste of crispy herbal hops and malted wheat. The aftertaste was better than the initial taste. I wouldn't touch this beer again.

Faint dusty hops and grain, minus the adjuncts of malt liquor. The 7.8% is not overly powerful, and despite the taste being pretty bland, the alcohol does give an astringency like malt liquors either. Light grain, sourish syrup, distant hopping in the finish. Not bad as a strong lager actually, just not very drinkable. The sugary malting gets a bit much towards the end.

3.57,20.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light brown/golden, with lots of head and no lace, pretty clear and the head leaves quickly. Smell is sweet and malty, some alcohol is present and a tiny bit of hops. Taste is sweet, with alcohol but not as present as I thought it would be, little hop bitterness at the end, but not cloying sweet. Smooth, carbonation is high, really not a bad beer, but not good and its a good price.","Viggo","Jan 31, 2005"

3.16,6.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a deep gold color with a big foamy white head that coats the glass with thick lace. The aroma is of bready some what vegetal malts, fusel alcohol and a floral hoppiness. The taste is malty, with a sterilized white bread character. Theres also a herbal hop flavor and some spicey alcohol. The maltiness could be fuller and smoother. The finish has very little to no bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is actually quite in check for a strong lager, its definitely not as strong as I thought it would be. This is quite a good, but a little bland, Polish lager.","CAMRAhardliner","Sep 05, 2004"

4.05,36.4,3,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Where the smell was certainly nothing to write home about, everything else was quite impressive, especially for this style. I poured this from its 500mL can into my commemorative Lord of the Rings chalice. Yes, I'm a dork. Anyhow, I am typically not a fan of lagers, but I am a fan of just about anything from eastern Europe, so I figured I'd give it a go. Usual golden colour, snow white head. Doesn't look terrible, but doesn't strike me, either. The smell was a nice mix of malt and hops, but again, typical. Not striking or unusual in anyway. Then, however, came the taste. Very good. Typical lager at first, but then a maltiness followed by a roasted nuttiness in the aftertaste. Very good. There also doesn't seem to be a hell of a lot of carbonation with this stuff, either. That said, mouthfeel is very nice, very smooth. Easy to drink, and at 7%abv (not7.5%) this is a good level of "horsepower" for a brew of this style. Overall, I was quite surprised by this one, especially given the style. Fantastic.","SilentSabre","0"
3.69,24.2,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Not too bad. Near golden color with a tall somewhat fluffy white head. An average lager taste, with a bit more alcohol, much like a higher strength version of Carlsberg Lager. Actually seem to gain flavors as it warms. Loses the sourness and has a dry roasted nut flavor and finish. A strong pale malt flavor to start with a mild hop after taste. Definitely drinkable.","stoutman","Feb 19, 2004"

3.68,23.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"A decent unoffensive brew that you can have again and again. Malty and did pick up carbonation others didn't, perhaps theirs was too cold or old and mine fresh in. And that likely affected taste and ratings too. Cannot detect the high alcohol. Sweet up front with tad bitter at end.","Sammy","Dec 26, 2003"
2.05,-31,3,3,1.5,1.5,2,"Not the kind of beer that would move me to purchase another. I laboured to finish the contents of the bottle and had a fleeting thought that maybe a Molson Dry would have been more satisfying","Beersignal","Sep 26, 2003"
2.53,-14.8,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"There really isn't much difference beyween Okocim Lager & Okocim Mocne. This is a very flat looking lager with little head. Reminds me of apple juice. The mouthfeel is smooth/flat and lacks body. The taste is bland....light malt, not really any hoppiness. Some alcohol aftertaste. A boring beer experience.","Popsinc","Aug 07, 2003"
3,1,3,3,3,3,3,"The quintessential lager color a unblurred gold, the head portly in size, brilliant white in color, frothy in texture and as it disintegrates, a fine film of lace forms on the glass. Prototypical lager nose, malt, citrus crisp, clean and fresh, with the start cloyingly sweet, full of malt with the top skimpy in its feel to the palate. Finish is stingingly acidic, alcohol bitter along with the hops that are pertinent to the style, the alcohol bitterness lingers on as a substitute for the aftertaste, and the 7.8% ABV, gives the Tummy a bit of warming. Damn I wish this was their Porter, but this is just an average lager with double the alcohol, which does little for me.","Gusler","Jul 10, 2003"

3.13,5.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Overall, this is a decent strong lager and worth a try if you like the style. Personally, I really prefer the Okocim "OK" Beer, which this beer seems to try and emulate but with more of a kick. The kick is there, but the OK has more flavor and is far more quaffable.","TripelJ","Jun 01, 2003"

3.56,19.9,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Poured a darker gold than a normal lager. Fairly good head that didn't stick around, but leaves a fine lace on the glass. Not much for aroma except for hops. Good carbonation that really explodes in the mouth, leaving a little sweetness in the finish with very little bitterness. Another enjoyable lager, I could sit and drink this all night.","Indybeer","May 10, 2003"

It is quite a nice beer, and if you ever find yourself saying “Chce mi sie pic”, then I do recommend that you give this boozy little friend from Poland a try.","lipschitz","Dec 27, 2002"
3.41,14.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A crystal clear golden body displays dozens of streams of fast rising bubbles. It's quite effervescent! The bright-white head starts full and frothy, holds well, and then drops to a creamy 1/4" lid. The retention is quite good and it holds through the entire glass leaving spotty lace as it goes. The aroma clearly expresses alcohol along with some grainy/husky malt. It's very clean, however, and the alcohol isn't overly distracting. The medium body is accentuated by its effervescent carbonation leaving a mouthfeel that's gently crisp. In the flavor a clean, lightly sweet, and grainy malt is tempered by alcohol. It's not overbearing, but present, and seems to diminish a bit as you progress through the glass. It finishes with a drop of sweet honeyish malt on the front of the tongue. One of the better strong Polish lagers.","NeroFiddled","Nov 15, 2002"
3.15,6.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours with a soft white head over clear golden liquid, actively carbonated. Nose is malty with just a hint of pear. Taste is predominately sweet , showing hints of dryness and a strangely metallic presence, then some alcohol flavors. A touch of bitterness in the finish, fades out quickly. An unremarkable strong lager.","beerluvr","Sep 18, 2001"
2.44,-17.8,2,3,2.5,2,2,"I liked this more than the Zagloba but it was still a slightly below average beer. I had the can version and it poured a golden color with a thick white head and lively carbonation. Faint hops aroma. A little on the weak side flavor-wise, it was mostly hops and metal. Dry finish. I won't bother with this one again.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.66,23.2,4,3,4,3,4,"Czech Lager are hard to fit into styles. Anyway this one is a bit lighter on the malt with a nice spicy hop flavor, not too bitter. Good beer with a respectable alcohol level.","mattmaples","0"
