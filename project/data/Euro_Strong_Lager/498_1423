3,22.4,3.25,2.5,3.25,3,3,"Poured a tall 500 ml can into a pint glass. ""Why am I drinking this?"" crosses my mind. A bright yellow hue with a crazy amount of beige foam ... Looks a lot like ginger ale. Smell is almost non-existent with the exception of a corn sugar sweetness accompanied by a twinge of wet grain. Tastes like vodka-harsh boiled grains, chalky grape juice or sour hard candy, and anemic grassy hops. Less sweet and perhaps just a smidgen more refined than American malt liquors but the same basic idea. A notable industrial alcohol warmth emerges and I am thinking that this is reminiscent of a very low-rent imperial pilsener. Watery body is coupled with the expected aggressive carbonation, and there's a hint of peppery spice that you don't get in North American brewed cheap beers. Finishes crisp but with more residual sweetness than a Euro pale lager, grainy with an echo of saccharine fruitiness. Basically the intent of such a beer is to provide a cheap intoxicant, a la North American malt liquors. It probably suits this purpose admirably and tastes marginally better than its New World cousins. That's the best that can be said.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 04, 2014"

The thing that impresses me most about Bavaria 8.6 is probably the drinkability; it basically just tastes sweet and wet, and even though you can tell the alcohol is there (and it will hit you eventually), this is definitely not an especially raunchy-tasting lager considering the abv. Reminds me a little of Boxer Ice, with its weird, fruity, funky off-tastes. I worked at a liquor store in Alberta that sold these; the only customers I ever saw purchase them were homeless people and 'regulars' (alcoholics). Two of these might give you a decent buzz for 4-5 bucks, but Warka Strong can do the same while allowing you to retain your self-respect for the rest of the night. I'd only drink this again if I were pretty desperate.","thehyperduck","Mar 11, 2013"
