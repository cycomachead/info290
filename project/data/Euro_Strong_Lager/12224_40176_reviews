"Wow - this beer is really foul.."

"If this is considered an ""ok"" as far as taste to price for European standards, I'd like to try a better!"

"Smells boozy and musty. Tastes the same, with hints of bread and banana, typical for the yeasts used in the Baltic states. I started drinking it too cold, but the second half of the bomber was poured into a room temperature glass and was quite a bit better. Thick full mouthfeel, feels like a triple. I wasn't sure what to expect from a beer with a huge lobster on the label, but my expectations were not high. Overall a decent beer but not one I'd choose again."

"overall: Not something I would drink again, just really boozy version of a euro style lager, not very good. But for the ABV and price, it's not a bad option in that regard. With that said, this was my first drain pour."

"Maybe I will put it back to a 3 at some point as I still have four bottles left and want my wife to try,"

"O: I truly hope no one else has to experience how bad this beer tastes, looks and smells fooled me, if you find yourself in Lithuania needing a drink buy some vodka instead"

"Served from bottle into a Hair of the Dog tulip. Poured a golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, floral, grain, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, fruit, alcohol, grain, and floral. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty below average brew. I bought this to amuse beeruser and funkydelic at GBX as they laughed when they suggest that I tick it. Phew! I now know why... The manager at Trappe Door described it as 'hot trash'. Not only does this thing not appeal to the palate, it does not do so for the eye either. I didn't know what to expect going into this one and there was honestly no way I could have prepared myself short of pounding a few 40's prior to this one. Just so harsh in flavors like nails on the chalkboard. Yeah guys, you got me good. Based on this one Lithuania should stick to whatever they are good at and leave beer alone in my opinion..."
"The beer pours like crisp apple juice or piss with a quick firecracker head that disappears as fast as it appears leaving nothing. The beer smells very light with damp pils-like malts. There is some slight fruity character in the smell as well but it is very faint. The beer tastes very sweet with a candy-apple bite and a very light sweet finish. There is also a very strong butter-flavor traveling throughout this beer which is probably why it is called “Lobster Lovers” and is strange and smooth upon the mouth. The mouthfeel is super dry after it passes through the mouth but is very clean and slightly watery as it passes through with a light hint of sharp bubbles and a gelling feeling in the mouth. This is my first strong lager and I am quite interested with it. The heavier malt bill seems to give the lager a more ale-like than any lager I have consumed. The mouthfeel is the major downside of this beer, leaving you thirstier than before the sip, but the taste is quite intriguing though a little too sweet for my palate. This is an intriguing beer to say the least, but I’m not sure I’ll have it again."
"Overall: This beer will please everyone, yes i know it doesn't the greatest reviews but it is above satisfaction. Have one on me, Salud!"
"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it was a below average to average Euron Strong Lager, I haven't had this style before so I can't say for sure, but Beeradvocate says that the style is the European version of Malt Liquor, so I think this is right around average and tastes similar to some shitty Malt Liquors I have had. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it went down a little rough and it was boozy, I am glad I am splitting this bottle, I don't think I could drink it all by myself. What I liked most about this beer was the way it looked, it looked pretty nice in a Pilsener glass, the only flaw was the head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, they wen't that good and were overly sweet and boozy. I wouldn't buy this beer again, if I wanted a beer that tasted like this I would save some money and just a buy a shitty can of Malt Liquor, I don't recommend this beer to anyone even Lithuanians. This was my first beer from this brewery and I wasn't a fan which didn't make for a good first impression. I have yet to find a decent tasting Lithuanian beer, but I haven't given up hope just yet... the search continues."

"Underneath the expected blast of alcohol and rough husky aromas are some surprising sweetly floral notes. Huge alcohol and sweetness- let this stuff warm at your peril- but it ain't half bad, really. Just keep in mind that this is basically a fancier Euro version of our malt liquor. Peppery and husky with a touch of honey to the malt profile. A touch more carbonation might improve drinkability a bit. For the price point, you could certainly do worse."

"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, big alcohol, with small fruitiness mixed in there. In the taste, a small sweetness of fruit and a dry alcohol presence all the way through. An alcohol bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol aftertaste. It took me a minute, but this would compliment lobster and butter really well, but as a beer on it's own, it is struggling."
""
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, but at the same time not extremely intriguing either."
"O: I like the smell and flavor, but I'm much more inclined to prefer Werewolf from the same brewer. It seems that the higher the ABV in this series, the poorer the quality gets."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a bit of white soapy head. Smell of pale malt and a small malt sweetness. In the taste, big presence of euro pale malts, just a slight sweetness to a smooth creamy malt finish and some honey. Alcohol is pretty well hidden between a very euro pale malt flavor and mild herbal hops providing little bitterness. Deceptive in its strength, smooth, easy drinking, and rather light for a beer 9.5% ABV. Would have again, a very nice place to start."
"Enjoyed this beer for the first time today. The beer had a pleasant aroma and went down smoothly. The ABV of this beer at 9.5 is better than average for what can be found locally and provides a nice kick even after one serving. I also liked the extra volume of beer in the bottle with 16.9 oz instead of the traditional 12 oz that you get with most beers."
"random exotic beer at my little corner grocery store. Maine= Lobster must have been the owners thinking. VERY cherry smell and almost no head on mine. alcohol became more prominent as I drank more and the last sip had allot of alcohol flavor on the mouth. overall very sweet and Malty would not buy again as I prefer hoppy beers but glad I tried it. 1 bottle gave me a buzz ( I must be getting old)"
"I don't mind boozy brew with some real character. This is what it is. Sweet and boozy, this is beer to get wasted on. I cannot see this with food, nor can I see having more than one. Structure and quality are there -- no bitching here about that -- I just had a hard time getting this down."
"A pale yellow with thin white head that fades fast but leaves nice lacing. The smell is a sweet malty bomb of pilsner malt, honey, caramel, banana, and spice. The taste is malty, honey sweet, fruity, a bit cloying but the alcohol was hidden well. Creamy, full bodied and slightly syrupy. Interesting beer. Almost like a lighter version of Samiclaus. Too sweet for me."
"Reveal is Lobster Lover's Beer from Rinkuskiai in Lithuania. Very interesting curve ball."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with little head, no lacing or retention. The aroma has notes of floral hops and honey. The taste is strong with honey and also floral hops. The mouthfeel is average with some over carbonation. Overall worth a try... It may be your thing."
"This beer poured out with a typical yellow color with a white fizzy head on it. Lots of bubbles rising in this one but the head fades away and doesn't leave much lacing at all. The smell is pretty much like any other lager out there. The taste is stronger than I expected. a decent amount of flavors in there but nothing that really makes it taste good to me. The mouthfeel is pretty light and the ABV will run its course quickly if you let it. I can't see myself drinking these back to back though."
"Anyhoo, clear dark yellow hue with no head or bubbles or anything. Nose is sweet and boozy with a touch of dark fruit. Taste is heavily malty and sweet and has all the subtlety of a bazooka. The lesson here is clearly to get blackout drunk as quickly as possible and get some tender stuff from a ruddy crustacean. The texture is thin and the finish is reasonably clean given the metric. Not something to hunt for, but if you find it, feel like getting shitefaced and are in the mood for seafood, you're in luck, or something..."
"Pours a clear golden honey like color with a thin head and a decent amount of lace. The aroma is of an unknown sweetness and grains. The taste is of grains with a slight buttery taste at the end. The nouthfeel is creamy and full it is very nice. The drinkability is ehhh its a tough drink and you could only have one."
"Very tasty for it's affordability. If you are an every day drinker that can't afford $6 for every pint size bottle you purchase then take advantage of this bargain from eastern Europe. Lithuania's marketing strategies are confusing especially with Werewolf's slogan and this unexplained title, but I would drink this everyday."
"D- Moderately high. Cleaner than most of its stateside cousins, this is a pretty good beer. Lacks the vegetal grainy off notes of malt liquors. I`d buy it if I had it alailable locally."
"M - light/medium body; low carbonation."
"It's fortified, it's big, it empties pretty quickly. At $2 each, it'd be great to get a load of these in a bucket of ice water for a weekend party. It's not nuanced, and it won't win you points with the hop snobs, but I've had worse."
"Brilliantly clear golden color with a creamy white head. Hints of cherry, white chocolate and rose water in the nose ... seems the alcohol wants to take over even in a subtle manner. Creamy body with a struggling crispness. Maltiness is pretty sweet with some vague fruit and buttery flavors. Warmth from the alcohol is of a clean solvent and peppery likeness. More malt sweetness in the end, though the beer does move forward. Surprisingly good, and for its hefty strength, it does not stray too far. The name says it all ... this would be good with a fresh lobster and drawn butter."
"D - This isn't terrible, but not something I would drink again."
"This beer was surprisingly better than I anticipated. With an ABV of 9;5%, I expected more of a sweeter taste. Not to say this beer is not sweet, but it is decent. It has a golden rich yellow color, minimal head, A sweet aroma and a nice slight aftertaste. The first Lithuanian beer I have ever had, probably will not be the last."
"While it doesn't taste like lobster it certainly is rich, sweet, and salty like a seafood hotpot. Plus I swear to you as it fully warmed to room temperature the initial no smell at all blossomed into quite the pungeant aroma. I'd dare say if you shared a case of these at a party and left the empties sitting around until morning you'd really need to air out your home."
"This beer started off O.K., as I served it very cold. In the mouth, I thought the alcohol was well blended and nothing really jumped out - slight citrus and sweet flavors. However, the finish, especially as it grew less cold, became more and more offensive. Highly alcoholic finish. However, I won't be getting another."
"The taste is relatively bland. There's honey-like sweetness on the initial sip. The body is similar to skim milk--not bad. The carbonation is quite high. Very little bitterness. The swallow features the sourness I described above in the smell. The aftertaste is mild and short lived. Interestingly, the alcohol is quite hidden, which, given the abv percentage and the style, is stunning."
"Love the label! I think my first Lithuanian beer."
"drinkability - another drain pour for the night i wouldnt buy this beer again even if i was wanting to catch a cheap buzz"
"D: Nothing too offensive to say no. That's why it gets a 3.5"
"I think it is the nasty malty flavor not balanced by decent hops that makes this taste so bad. I don't get the almost sexy label (or name, for that matter) either."
"The feel of this beer is medium at first but seems to kick with a strong bitterness before long. Not my favorite import by far and a beer that would take some getting used to."
"D - easy to drink because there isn't very much going on here. I think I will pass next time."
"The label said ""Porter"" but it's actually a lager. It pours a nice clear medium amber, more like a fine ale than a lager, with a decent off-white head. Aroma is crisp and malty, typical for a lager. Flavor is rather sweet and fruity, just a little malty. Texture is quite smooth and hardly fizzy at all."
"Not bad overall, but the unchallenged sweetness was a little much after a bit. High ABV is hardly even noticeable. Not great, but I can see this compliment sweet lobster meat & butter well."
"""Grab it by the claws!"" Wow, 2 dollar pint of 9.5% abv let's get fucked up Lithuanian beer. Pours a deep semi viscous golden orange sunrise hue with a bright quickly dwindling white head. Thin scattered lacing between sips. Aroma is sweet honey tones, green apples, mineral water, barley husks with some cooked creamed corn. Flavor this is malt liquor it might as well come in a forty ounce bottle. Super cloying mess of a beer, just not acceptable. More green apple with honey bursts of gag reflux sweetness, cooked veggies and a bit of rust or penny sucking sensations. Mouthfeel is so bad I can't really stand taking a big gulp it's offensive. Medium bodied cloying mess with residual sugars clouding the palate, it's so bad it's making my head twitch with each sip. Drinkability, I don't think so drain pour, but it was worth the fun."
"EDIT: I don't know why this beer is so unpopular. Normally I would be the first to bash import lagers, but to me, this one is a winner."
"D- This one wasn't for me. Too boozy and sweet."
"I wonder what the hell this label means. A naked chick with a giant lobster on her back. I wish there was a story on the bottle or something. Anyway, it pours out a cloudy brass color and has a dense foamy off-white head. Smells awful. I swear to god I can pick up a hint of Limburger cheese and that's about the last odor you want coming from your beer. Musty like a urine soaked diaper stench exists as well. Old grain. Just awful! I'm switching from a 1.5 to a 1.0 for the smell. Every time I sniff again it gets worse. The taste is ruined by the smell. Those terrible aromas are detected in the flavor also but there's a also a sweet grainy element that improves this whole experience ever so slightly. Did they boil some lobster then use the same water for the brewing process? Appearance and mouthfeel are the only things going for this disaster-of-a-beer. This is the worst beer I've had in a while. I'm choking it down."
"Overall, not something I enjoyed, but something I'm glad I tried. I was disappointed but glad at the same time that there was no Lobster flavors in this one. A strange name for a beer, but honestly how else would this beer sell. Great marketing technique if you ask me."
"A pretty bad beer, doesn't bring much to the table besides corn like sweetness. Just a touch of grassiness saves this from being truly terrible, but just barely. Alcohol is pretty strong as well"
"Lobster Lovers certainly does not taste like a lager, Euro strong or any other, but it's not bad as a novelty beer. I enjoyed it, I just don't want to enjoy it that often."
"**** Over a year later (11-23-10). I just threw up in my mouth a little, while thinking about this beer. Whew."
"They're very proud of how strong it is. It has a big hanging tag on it advertising 9.5% ABV. Good for them."
"So if this is the Lithuanian equivalent of malt liquor it's good in the sense that it's cheap, alcoholic and could lead to questionable desicion making at social gatherings. Sucess!"
" Palate is sweet with fruity, adjunct malt, and a very slight hoppy bitterness. Finish leaves a lingering sweetness, with a touch of warmth. A mild chalky character is not particularly pleasant. While the alcohol is well-integrated, this is not exactly a beer I'd like to try again. Try again, Lithuania."
"Drinkability: No thanks... I'll choke this one back.... but I'll not be seeking this one out again...."
"Seriously...Pass"
"taste is thick, sweet malt, some caramel, grain, slight skunky aftertaste, no taste of alcohol with a 9.5%, ends sweet."
"It's drinkable. I can't imagine pounding something with an abv this high over and over again, but it's certainly not a beer I'd be opposed to drinking again... though probably not very often."
"Drinkability: Very average, even for the style, which I'm trying to rate to very hard here. Just not a terribly good beer, with a lot of strange, yeasty, ""off"" note, and a little too much alcohol to be too terribly drinkable."
"I can't really drink much of this beyond the sips it's taking me to review this beer. Just too many bad flavors at work. You can pass on this one."
"D: i have become unhinged by this beer and its flavors and bizarre presentation/aesthetics. This beer has a type of stalwartness with a large dose intractably for the drinker"
"OK. Another Lithuanian oddity found in Topsham, Maine, this one being 9.5%. Seriously? Madness. Out of the bottle this Euro Strong Lager was a deep gold color with a thin, off-white head. The retention was decent but the lacing was actually quite good in thin sheets. The aroma was of musty and earthy malt with some sweetness of adjunct grain mash and a light spiciness. The flavors were at first quite spicy and rather sweet from the caramel and toffee-like malt along with some artificial tasting sweetener probably being used to cover up the alcohol. The middle of the beer was grainy and after a while I began to taste the ALC in that part. The finish was a little musty. The mouthfeel was smooth but a bit slick, the carbonation soft and the body medium. I didn't really care for the taste but it was almost exactly like their blue label, only twice as strong. If you're not going to enjoy the flavors you might as well enjoy the buzz..."
"Gotta give it to this one, the flavor is completely enjoyable. I've always liked this idea of this style but never found a decent representative until now. It may not look the business, and the smell is dull, but it performs where it matters most. Euro Strong Lagers could be the next thing for U.S. brewers to mess with--I'd love to see it. The strange name and weirdly sexy/disturbing label probably don't do it justice. I'd buy it again, as $2.99 a bottle seems fair."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear, amber color. Malty nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet malty, caramel finish. The high ABV is hidden. Decent strong lager, big improvement over their 5% version. $4.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall better than expected and a steal at $2.50. I'm relieved there's no lobster taste."
"D: There were four reasons I picked up this beer: the country, the price, the huge red tag that said 9.5% ABV, and the intriguing, arousing, and yet disturbing label. As someone who loves both lobster and the female form I can't complain about the bottle graphics while strange, even for me. I would drink more of this beer and maybe even give it a spin with lobster."
"I tried both this and its 5% ABV brother, and didn't like either of them. This beer was a gold color with a small white head that disappeared quickly. It had an aroma of grain, and that was pretty much it. I thought the alcohol was very noticeable, but despite that, the beer was pretty bland. I finished this 500ml bottle and couldn't imagine having another one."
"Lobster Lovers Beer has one of the strangest names and one of the strangest labels that I've ever seen. Even though the contents of the bottle are essentially 'same old, same old', this is one of the best ESLs going. That still doesn't make it good beer."
"This is not very good for a 9.5% but you can 't tell that there is that much alcohol in this stuff."
"And a note to all of you with a glass full who can't properly review a beer... Drink less, drink better, think more... please."
"This beer is not as clean as the last one I had from this brewery; though both are extremely similar. It packs a punch, and despite the subtle flavor, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. It gets tough to finish this one when it warms up"
"Drinkability: The kind of beer that just begs to be drank straight from the bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag."
"Overall: This beer comes off as a thin-bodied Maibock. Ultimately, this beer shows what happens when you brew a Maibock without a nice, malty backbone, and in the process shows why a nice, malty backbone is essential to a Maibock. Still, it's not a horrible beer and is worth it for the bottle alone."
"16.9 oz bottle. Pours golden with 1.5 cm white, mostly diminishing head. Aroma is sweet, mostly apple, a little yeasty. Initial flavor is sweet, balanced citrus and apple. Flavor ends on slight yeasty and apple notes and the alcohol catches up at this point. The aftertaste is dominated by the alcohol content. A thinner body, moderate carbonation, alcohol is noticeable as it warms. The flavor of cherry cola only comes out for the aftertaste once the beer warms. Stronger alcohol aroma when the beer warms. Drinkable beer and a nice change of pace from other beers I generally take home."
"Clean but with a nice lingering buttery texture. The booze it well hidden and palatable. Moderate carbonation mellows the whole experience out a bit. Slick and a bit creamy in the finish. Extremely well crafted. I am impressed."
