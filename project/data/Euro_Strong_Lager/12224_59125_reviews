"While not quite an abject failure, one wonders if the producers of this beer have ever actually had anything approaching a doppelbock before. While I can find one or two things to enjoy about the flavor, and I'm able to finish the bottle (only had one or two ""drainpours"" in my life), this is at best a novelty beer, and a worst a headache in a bottle. Avoid."

"This beer pours really nice with little to no head. It has a golden-honey color. The initial taste is wheat with a bit of sweetness. There's not much of an after-taste. I can't believe this beer is rated so low, it's very smooth and delicious. I recommend it."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a mostly clear dark gold/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing at all. The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, sugar and booze. Unfortunately the taste is similar to the aroma. I think it tastes mostly like sugary booze, with some grainy malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's syrupy and coating with low/moderate carbonation. This certainly wasn't one of the better brews I've had lately. But I also finished the bottle without a problem so it wasn't exactly awful either. $2.49 a bottle."

"O - This is a very clean, inoffensive, high alcohol beer. It does not have any particular aspect that stands out, but it is pleasing in a generic, high-alcohol way."

"Despite this beer clocking in at 12% ABV, this beer wasn't overly boozy. Sure it was mostly sweet and grainy, but at least it didn't drink like rubbing alcohol. If you want a cheap beer with a lot of alcohol in it, you might want to pick up this beer with the creepy label."

"Avoid this one at all costs. It had a $2.99 tag around the 500ml bottle, I should have known. The taste was much too sweet, like fake candy, way too boozy and the aftertaste was like vomit. Almost zero carbonation and a very strange mirky orange color. I drink all kinds of beer but this went down the drain. Too bad."

"Good God, this beer is downright awful. I tried, I really did. I muscled down about half the glass and had to pour the rest down the drain. It got far worse as it warmed up. A colossal train wreck of alcohol, adjunct grains, malt, and whatever the hell else is in this beer. Head for the hills, this is the worse beer I've had."

"This is really not a good beer. Ugh."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a nice orange amber with virtually no head no lacing. Sour grain aroma. Taste is light sweet malt and alcohol. A kind of caramel flavor in the middle, but it is overwhelmed by alcohol and an acidic, estery flavor. Not very good. Hopefully won't give me a headache."
"Avoid this one."

"Overall, this is really terrible, when you can have standard like Ayinger Celeberator or Weihenstephan Korbinian why would you even want this? Troegenattor please!"
"O- After reading the reviews, I was surprised by how bland this beer was. It wasn't offensive but it wasn't good either. It would be better if it had more carbonation. I have another bottle which of course I will drink when I'm looking for a cheap drunk. However, if you're only looking for a cheap drunk off of beer, your average Euro-Strong lager is a better option. Or, just get some Black Boss Porter or Zweic Porter. At least those beers have some character to it."

"Don't buy this, buy Steel Reserve, or some other malt liqueur that does a better job than this impostor"

"I purchased this bottle lured in by the cool optical illusion label and the promise of 12% ALC. Unfortunately, these turned out to be the only highlights of the experience. Out of the bottle the beer was a dark golden color with a very short lived head of tan foam. Minimal lacing. The aroma was of booze, ethanol and some skunked malt. The flavors were about the same, dominated by the booze and ethanol with hints of something fishy and an acidic bite. Pure unadulterated garbage. The mouthfeel was slick, the body medium and the carbonation average. Not worth it and sadly one of the worst beers Iâ€™ve had in a while."
"It's not the worst thing... but it's not to style even despite the alcohol, and it's just not worth drinking."
"But if that's your goal, talk to the guy who reviewed before me and got the huge bottle for only $2.99!"
"Overall: Reprehensible before, during, and after."

"Look, if one wishes to get plastered, do it with vodka, not swill like this."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Very interesting taste."
"O: I expected something pretty potent from the big 12% ABV warning on the neck and the picture of the ""before and after"" thing on the front... and I was right. However, I hadn't expected the pleasant caramel notes that help make it drinkable."
"I don't like to throw beer out, but this was complete drainpour."
"Overall: Glad I tried this but I will not make that mistake again"
"Not difficult to drink, and kinda tasty. Just nothing impressive and memoriable."
"O- The clean lagered beer has some nice malt notes with some ester character but this beer is a bit thin for the big alcohol that soon dominates."
"Overall I like it better than the scores would indicate, but it almost seems like a fruit beer instead of a dopplebock. The fruitiness just overwhelms the maltiness that I associate with dopplebocks."
"Overall not bad, nice wheat and malt flavors, chewy malts, good fruits, but too sweet and not enough carbonation."
"One word to sum this one up: Booze. It has one hell of an alcohol burn but what flavor there is (other than alcohol) is balanced but really it's just sweet grain alcohol. Nothing but a buzz in a bottle."
"Very cool bottle... the whole reason I bought it. Very thin head which immediately dissipated. Clear with bubbles rising. Smell is of rich full caramel malt and well straw actually. The taste is of fruity esters in a rich caramel brew... alcohol flavor is not prevalent despite 12%ABV. Mouthfeel is cheap and expected @ 2.75 per 16.9oz bottle. Overall definitely worth the experience and a hella cool bottle."
"D - I finished the pint but it was a lot of alcohol. Will not be having again."
"What a surprise! This tasted boosey, but not as much as I would think being 12%. Very refreshing for such a powerful brew. A nice profile of caramel and skunky hops. I expected this beer to be terrible, but for less than $3 I was very happy. It went down way too fast for how strong it was. Probably why I'm feeling it so much today. Will seek out more."
"Pours a one, three-finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied (thinner than I expected). Light alcohol and caramel nose, flavor has hints of alcohol, caramel, hops are in background, not cloying. Not as bad as the ratings suggest. $4.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"I was a little scared of this beer. I thought it would be a hot adjunct laden mess, but it's actually quite tasty when you're in the mood for something like this. Try it out. It's worth the $3 for sure."
"Overall, a below average beer. Try it for the hell of it, but you won't be missing anything if you skip it."
"Verdict: Weird but well-priced and fun."
"The main selling point of this brew was the ABV (displayed in huge lettering on a tag on the neck of the bottle). That, and an increasing interest in bocks. I wasn't pleased, but I have had worse, so I can't fail Before-After."
"Thankfully, taste and feel are a lot better. It is malty and overall like the aroma, but more pleasant. It has a spicey-sweet, faintly meaty, raisiny character with a hint of dough and rather like cheap, fortified wine with a hint of basic blended American whisky. It is one-dimensional, devoid of complexity, but nevertheless fairly pleasant. Alcohol is evident, but amazingly smooth, with a strong warming quality and not rough or unpleasant. It is surprisingly drinkable for all of this and for the high abv, but rather boring."
"Poured with a small, short lived, off white head and no lace. Color is a clear amber. As soon as I opened the bottle I got a whiff of the malt. Aroma also has lots of grain, caramel and circus peanuts. Flavor's about the same and very sweet. Body is like I'd expect from a beer this sweet, full and thankfully there's enough carbonation to cut through it. Finish is like flavor and has some length. Probably won't finish it."
"The mouthfeel was very sharp. Can't believe this is a bock. It bears no resemblence to a bock."
"D- i dont think ill have another of these anytime soon."
"Drinkability - a thumbs-up for this Lithuanian surprise. Pretty nice value too at just $3 a half-liter. I'll have to set one of these down for posterity to see how it ages."
