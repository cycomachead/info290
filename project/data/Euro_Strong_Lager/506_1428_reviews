"Not bad for a strong lager, very hard to find."
"Not amazend me. Strange and difficult. Malty aroma and flavor, very sweet. Definitely feel the alcohol and it's not a plus. Slightly saturated. I would not return to this beer."

"Honestly there is no reason to drink this beyond getting drunk fast. There is nothing really revolting about this, but neither is there anything good."

"Overall, this beer does not seem to be designed for people who actually enjoy drinking beer. People who enjoy getting drunk possibly might like it, as it gets the job done quickly, if a little unpleasantly."

"The strength of Kanon definitely earns its namesake with the power that's twice that of the standard pilsner. This lands the beer somewhere between Samichlaus Helles and a plethora of American microbrewed imperial pilsners."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. While it seemed way overdone, muddy, and forced, some of the notes enlivened the nostrils. The flavoring suffered from being overly boozy, and you really had a hard time getting past that to find much of anything at all. Had they been willing to subdue that a bit more, it could have potentially been a much more curious, complex drink."

"Maybe this works for someone who wants to get drunk fast and doesn't care about taste but I'll pass."

"Poured from a 300 ml bottle. Minimal head that also dissapeared straight away. Colour is clean, dark yellow. Strong taste, expected from the high alcohol but other than that, nothing. Midly carbonated. it's okay if you have difficulties to go to sleep although you have already drunk a bunch of normal lagers."

"Sent to me in care package from the Netherlands. This is a beer that looks great ( the can that is) and is obviously for the comsumer to get drunk fast. Why else brew a 11.7% lager? That being said this beer is not as bad as other reviewers have said. It is slightly sweet but the alcohol is not that pronounced. I got hops off the nose and a decent midbody. I drank it out of the can at first but once I realized it wasn't terrible I poured it into a glass. Way too much ABV for the style but drinkable"
"D: It's not. I had a few sips and had to toss it. Very disappointing."
"I got this bottle free when I was at a Beer Fest and I can say I am happy I did not spend money on it but am not sad that I at least got to try it."
"Cheers to them."
"Drinkability is low, all booze and no real taste otherwise."
"Overall: This must be the worst beer I ever had, pure ethanol and other solvents, nothing else. Tastes and smells like nail polish."
"Not a very pleasing drink. I can't tell what the Grolsch brewers were trying to do but this beer didn't turn out so well."
"Tried this one a day ago. 11.6% hmm? Just what you'd think - strong, little in the way of anything BUT alcohol, and still, pretty decent. The smell gives away it's strength, but the taste is not nearly as harsh as one might expect. And like someone else said, there was in fact some relatively good lacing on the glass. Ahem, well, good bang for your buck."
"Taste is Aaaah... alcohol, burning alcohol, the kind that burns a hole in your stomach. The sweetness of the malt is covering up some of the alcohol, but not enough to give the beer whiskey-like booziness. Other than the alcohol and sweet malt tastes, there is not much else going on. After 1 bottle I feel a big cannon stampeding through my head and I feel that this is a one time experience. Not bad, but alcohol is not the reason to drink beer."
"I'd normally try and find at least one positive thing to say about a beer but with this one its difficult; it's simpy so unbalanced. The appearance is good - just look at it for a while then pour it down the sink."
"This was a very fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. He brought this back home for the unique chance to enjoy."
"Beware the cannon..."
"This ridiculously strong beer pours a very thin head, about 1/8"". The head is persistent, though. Its color is a lovely golden yellow with lots of fine bubbles rising along the glass. The smell is a sweet, overpowering alcoholic experience. The alcohol is very strong in the mouth, lingering long after swallowing. It has a bitter, almost pilsner-like taste. Originally sold in half-liter bottles it was brought back by popular demand, but now in the cowardly 30cl euro bottles. If you're not aware of the strength of this beer and you drink it too fast and then try to stand up you immediately will sit down. Hence ""Kanon", the Cannon..."
"This beer was original one of six (I think) beers to celebrate the 100 year birthday of the swingtop. The other beers were must better. But probably due to the Dutch pilsner culture this was the beer that had a great impact. Three of these and you need only a glass of water the morning-after to be intoxicated again. It reminds me of Eku 28, not taste wise, but more image wise, look what we can brew. No Grolsch, leave the high ABV beers for the microbrewers, they can make tasty ones, and stop brewing this. Try Grolsch Amber again!"
"BB aug 05. Not that great of a head annd golden to copper beercolor. Nose is malts bading in pure alcohol or at least that's the feeling you get. Taste is absolutly horrible, terrably sweet and very alcoholic. No bitterness noticeable and even malt is not detectable. What a horror brew this is. Unbelievable it's still has costumers cause I can't imagine anybody liking this accept for fuel to get as fast as possible drunk. Undrinkable IMO."
