"A superb afternoon in all respects."

"theres a malty & syrupy taste that okay isn't great but stops it being flavourless"
"Pretty much reminded me of US malt liquor."

"As it turns out, my last beer from Malaysia was pretty much like the majority of the others I tried whilst actually in the the country and proved to be a terrible offering. There's not much that can be said from this other than that the alcohol content wasn't hidden at all in the taste and overpowered everything else the beer had to offer, which was a real shame as the aroma was pretty good for the style."

"Avoid."
"Back in my room in Hong Kong and enjoying some beer. Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and grains. Taste is strong of alcohol, some malts, mot paticularly pleasant or enjoyable. Feels light in e mouth and overall there is nothing special about this beer."
"I can't even remember if I finished it all. Started to feel dizzy."

"it wont produce two fingers of good head, or challenge you pallet, but it also dosent want to. it is what it is."
"Carlsberg Special Brew...what was I expecting ? Let me be concise - this was shit smelling cabbage water carbonated with farts, aged in camel balls and coloured with fly squash. This vile liquid exists in its Asian avatar mostly in Malaysia, so unless you are on your death bed because of dehydration and have nothing else around - stay away !"
"This beer is exceptional compared to its American counterparts. I consider this to be the European version of American malt liquor and high gravity lagers, which is the preferred fare of the indigent stateside. If that is so, then the hobos in London are really living it up. They're a bit more posh than American hobos as you might expect. The smell of this was classic bad beer taste and alcohol. The taste was more of the same. Grainy and alcohol, but in addition, it had just enough astringency to accompany the alcohol burn. It was perfect. And the hops were very basic, they didn't add any undesirable flavours to the beer, just a basic astringency. It was the perfect mix of grains, astringency, and alcohol. And it wasn't overly sweet either like the American counterparts often are. It tasted like there may have been some corn syrup adjunct, but it was hard to tell. It certainly wasn't overdone to the same extent as American malt liquors. This is a prize gem in hobo beer. I'm bringing back a pack to the states."
"please try any chimay trappist beer or any thing not based on euro strong beer"
"I will drink the ""special"" beer again if I ever do get a chance. Its not bad, but not that ""special"" really. There are much better beers in Hong Kong than this though, so I would call this a ""gimmick"" beer."
"Drinkability - For a 8.8% ABV it was a bit bland. No real complexity that a beer of that strength can have. Didn't have that nice hoppy bite or crispness a good lager can have either. Not brilliant but when compared to other macrolagers, this isn't too bad and I found it easy to knock back."
"d: overall not so good but still better than i thought it would be; the only upside is that it is a shitty beer that you would only need to chug a few of to be pretty far gone; i think that people slammed tis beer an inappropriate amount probably because it is from terrible carlsberg"
"Difficult to score, it is not as bad as some claim, but it isn't a world beater either."
"Appearance is just as you'd expect: pale, clear, and yellow. Some head, not much retention though thanks to an 8.6% alcohol content. Aroma is surprisingly light, considering the assault on the senses that follows: light alcohol, malt. Tastes like someone took Bud Light and dropped in a shot of 151: horrible boozy aftertaste and finish. I found myself wincing after every sip. Mouthfeel is more or less what you'd expect in the style: light and fizzy. Really horrible, will actively avoid. Surprised it's not worse-reviewed on BA."
"I'm actually slightly torn about this beer, since it often provided a respite in 95*F heat and 95% humidity in Singapore and Malaysia from the solid but thick Guinness Export (8%) and the less thick and less solid Danish Royal Stout (8%.) In Malaysia, on duty-free Langkawi island, it's a mere USD$0.50 per can, and the standard swill in these countries truly isn't worth paying for, including normal Carlsberg; Tiger isn't fit to wash sidewalks with."
"Drinkability: For all its faults, this beer is not all that difficult to drink. Salty snacks make it all the more palatable. If you're just looking to get drunk quickly, this is a fairly safe and inexpensive avenue to do so."
"Other comments: The bottle advises that it be served ""extra chilled"". Gee, can't imagine why. There's even a color-changing thermometer on the label to be doubly sure that you get it cold enough. So, that's what I did. Not sure I would want to try it at the warmer temps that I usually prefer when reviewing a beer."
"honestly, the alcohol makes it difficult for me to judge this on any other criteria, but you see the numbers."
"Theres nothing really here that should warrant you buying this beer, if you want to get drunk buy a bottle of bourbon or some strong belgian ale, but not this"
"strong lagers have long been on my list of beers to avoid, and this beer merely helped me make that decision. if you want something strong, these types are not the way to go at all, ever!"
"Horribly sweet and boring, i can't dig this at all, nothing that special about it really, too much alcohol for the beer, give this a miss."
