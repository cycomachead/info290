"Trying too hard to compete with other high alcohol beers, Efes Extra falls terribly short in all aspects."

"I'm not sure what I was thinking buying this and thankfully it counts as a new style that I have tried because it had nothing else going for it. Granted it is strong and cheap but why this one was on sale in an airport is beyond me, and since it was an airport it wasn't all that cheap. Disgusting from start to finish with too much sugar, alcohol and grain throughout and on top of that I was drinking it from a plastic cup on an airport floor so that didn't exactly help it any. That being said, nothing was saving this one."

"The Crack & Glug produced barely two fingers of fluffy bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a very pretty sunshine yellow on this sunny Thanksgiving afternoon. Nose was quite malty sweet, but seemingly free of adjuncts like corn. Xtra is not extra, at least not with adjuncts but with a nice pop to its ABV. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a pleasant enough lager sweetness and only about half the heat that I kind of expected to be hit with. Finish was fairly dry, again not surprising given its relatively high ABV, simply suggesting that the fermentable sugars were all, as the Amish might say."
"I had a can of this which I shared with my neighbors as part of a beer tasting. The color was yellow with decent carbonation. The carbonation yielded a white head that did not lace. There really wasn't much to smell outside of teh alcohol....some thought they could smell faint plumb. The taste was just alcohol and grain to me....I did not like this beer. The mouthfeel was yuck and I will not drink this beer again. However, when in Turkey...one should at least try it."
"One bottle was enough, too much alcohol and not enough real flavor."
"Could have been any of those terrible extra strong lagers dotted about Europe, all of which should be avoided."
"This is the strongests beer that I could find in Turkey. Efes beers are pretty much the only ones you can get in Turkey. Beer culture is o0bviously not a big component in this country, but this beer in particular makes Miller light seem drinkable. Quite simply even for its style profile, its boring, bland, under-carbonated, and doesn't feel right."
"I'm used to hops and alcohol from the styles I drink but this is a nice malt-and-alcohol concoction--maybe the first Euro Strong Lager I've ever had? And honestly it makes me want to drink more. It beats the hell out of the rest of the Efes line."
"D: Not too bad really. One of the best Efes offerings."
"The taste is a bit alcoholic, but not overly so, with only a hint of roughness and with a definite warming quality. It tastes mostly of fermented white grape juice with white bread, a hint of fruit candy, and a light grain quality with a vague hint of grapfruit and orange juice. It has a slightly candy-like sweetness up front, followed by a vague bitterness and spicey bite to balance out in the end. It's mostly rather bland and a bit thin in the feel."
"From an old bottle brought back from overseas. Sharing it with friends at Bodega in La Crosse. Ok head and lace. Very slight hazy amber. Likewise mild nose. The flavor is malty sweet without much distinction. But, where the beer really shines is in the body - Luscious!! Silky, mouthfilling, softy, very satisfying. maybe even too much. a bit warming from alcohol. decent finish."
"Opinion: Well, this beer has been a bit better than some of Efes other offerings. This beer is a bit hollow for as big as it is. I think that the gravity was increased by the use of adjuncts, and in this case a bit too much. If this is all Barley, I would be surprised. I may drink this beer again if it is given to me free again as this one wasotherwise I will stick to something more well-rounded."
"Too bad I picked this up in Brooklyn, I would definitely go get more soon if it was more local."
"Drinkability  This Turkish ghetto juice went down OK."
"Overall, it's a very nicely done strong lager with a beautiful maltiness and hop character."
"Poured out hard it forms a massive cream colored head that is moderately longlasting above the dark gold body. Good clarity and quite attractive. The green body imparted a lightly skunked aroma but was very reminiscent of Pilsner Urquell hopping. The flavor imparts an adjunct finish with some noticeable harshness. Smooth body and reasonable drinkability on a hot day."
"Turkey's answer to Olde English 800? The clerk said this is drunk straight from bottle. Well, for a proper review, I poured it in a glass. Hmm, a transluscent liquid copper pours out of this. The head, at first, foams up to a gargantous foam, only to subside to nothing. A ring of lace is left on top where the head reached it's peak. Strong, malt liquor alcohol smell. But around that, the nose detects a good indication of malt, hops, and even a peppery aroma. First taste is very harsh and coarse. The alcohol is evident on the epiglotis(the hangy down thing on the back of the throat). After the second sip, it's not too bad. Strong alcohol flavour, but their is a malt sweetness. It reminds me a little of cheap scotch whiskey. Course, almost granular mouthfeel. Leaves the throat refreshed, though."
"A hard pour generated a 3 fingered white head that was nice and firm, with plenty of contour, but still managed to fade fairly quickly, leaving just a bit of lace behind. This sat above pale bubbly gold liquid. The nose was sweet and mild, definitely not skunky. The mouth is fairly heave and lightly carbonated. The taste starts smooth and sweet, with barley and corn competing for dominance. This battle is followed by a mild but astringent metallic hoppy bite. The aftertaste was more sweet than bitter, though, much smoother than most of its Soviet cousins. Certainly drinkable."
