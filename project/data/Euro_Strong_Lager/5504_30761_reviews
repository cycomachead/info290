"Pretty decent beer overall. Nice and strong, quite flavorful, kinda sweet. Not bad at all."

"If your boss is a lazy prick who doesn't care about presentation, benefits or general tastefulness, then the name of this beer is well suited. I drink this as I write this review, and much like a horrible job with said boss, it gets worse with every sip, like every passing day is worse than the last. I refuse to stop, however, because I did pay for this and I desire the effects of a promised 8% ABV. Disappointing, considering that the Black Boss Porter rates rather well with me. This... never again."

"Only thing that saves this is high abv, which is inflated due to euro measuring standards."

"cereal. sweet and floral and cereal. before I even sip it, I must say the abv HAS to be the best thing about this one.... no? IF you can get it down... from Bourbon County to THIS...? kind of like the state of our nation, no? could this be the Obama of the beer world?? I also want to state that I DID NOT capitalize his name above... damned democrat spell checker... barf beer, at its best. last beer of the evening for me. figured i'd get rid of the garbage.... and I know because I had the 'black' one a few weeks ago. took all I had to grab this one from the frig. and, being partly polish, I am utterly ashamed of their beer making prowess... this might have been a winner when I was 15 and pimping beer, but geez, this stuff is GARBAGE now that I understand what beer CAN taste like... blehhh. does that translate to a number? if you're reading this right now, you're too close!!! I mean, seriously, if you're reading this right now, you must have bought this crap like I did. i'm sorry. just remember, friends don't let friends drink $h*t beer... save the world... slap it out of their hands if you see them reach for it... aaahhhggg... barf. I believe I have sufficient legal grounds to sue Total Wine for selling me this.... put it back and move to another country..."
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, minerals, slight smoke, and pickle or cucumber aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is quite a poor beer with a really weird pickle-like smell and flavors that make this one a chore to drink."

"Overall: not among my favorite beers. I think this bad boy is going to be a drain pour."
"An okay brew. A bit on the sweet side for me, but not overpowering with its alcohol content (as far as flavor goes). I'd drink it again, but it probably just would not be my first choice if other options were available."

"500mL bottle. Pours a clear straw color with zero head. No lacing. Aroma is bready. Picking up on grains, sweetness, a bit of skunk, and honey. Really nice aroma. Taste is a sweet, grainy flavor with a honey aftertaste. Very little, if any, alcohol flavor. Nicely hidden for the higher ABV. This is a really tasty, easy drinking, high ABV beer. I like Black Boss Porter and I am digging this beer as well. A solid beer for under $2. Tough to beat that deal. Overall, looks like I will be stocking up on this one for the warm weather and the Black Boss Porter for the cold weather months."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how there was nothing majorly offensive. Everything about it was kind of middle of the road for the style. Adjuncts were highly detectable in both the aroma and the taste, making this a bland choice."
"An OK drinkability, syrupy and sticky, some extract flavors take away a bit, and not as crisp and clean as a lager should be."
"Drinkability: My only experience in this style is Mocne and Baltika #9. This is way better than both of those. That said, it is still not a favorite. The honey taste is above average, but this beer is too sweet. A little hops to counterbalance that would go a long way with this beer. Above average for style, ok for beer."
"The body was good, fuller than most lagers and a little heavier. The body also was not as crisp, but the fullness nicely countered that. Drinkability was very good, although at 8.1% it's not exactly a ""lawnmower"" beer. You could have a couple of these enjoyably and it's a beer you might keep a couple of around for when you're in the mood. I suspect you'll be in the mood regularly."
"Drinkability: Don't bother. This is just a high-alcohol adjunct lager. You can get this quality for much cheaper in the states. This is one occasion to forget about Poland..."
"Drinkability: This is the easiest drinking beer I've had for its ABV, bar none. That being said, there isn't a whole lot to this one."
"Drinkability- Very refreshing and quaffable, but not this brewery's best beer. Try their porter-Black Boss much better."
"Notes from and tasted on: 12/12/05"
"Let this one air out a bit, the skunk went away pretty much. Sweet grain in the aroma. Huge metallic twang in the taste. This ones going down the drain."
"Pours with practically no head even with an aggressive pour and smells/looks like malt liquor. Take a sip.... even tastes like malt liquor. It isn't terrible... the 8% ABV is very well hidden, but the beer doesn't taste too good either. Basically if you want a cheap, strong beer that isn't offensive give this one a whirl. My first stab at a ""Euro Strong Lager""... I think I'll avoid this category in the future."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here, but definitely a solid strong lager, and better than many I've had the pleasure of trying. I could easily see drinking this one again, as the flavor isn't bad, the mouthfeel is clean, and the abv is essentially hidden. Not outstanding, but definitely not bad. Worth a shot if you can find a good deal on it."
"D: For the price this is worth picking up. Plus it's from Poland. Throw on some Chopin, Vader, Riverside, Behemoth, Decapitated (RIP), Sceptic, Nyia, or any other great music from the motherland and enjoy."
"overall not that impressive."
"This beer is a nice pale wheat color and smelled of malt and grains. It had little head and some lacing that fades quickly. Tastes of malt and honey with a smooth mouth feel and nice carbonation. This is a nice brew with all the Lager characteristics and a little more oomph."
"Pours a hazed gold with almost no head. Nose is of grain and alcohol. Typical stuff. Flavor is smooth with a sweet overall tone to it, but not so overly sweet that it overpowers. Slight corn taste it seems, but overall just a smooth lager. Feel is nice. Good amount of carbonation and goes down smooth. Highly drinkable. Sure it is a typical old lager, but these guys go down smooth and even. Could sit with these all night."
"Chicago"
"500ml bottle Light golden beer, small white head, some lacing. Aroma is actually not too bad, honeyish malts mainlly but it smelled fresh to me. Flavour sweet malts, rather honeyish,marshmallow even, the barest hint of hops, somewhat salty. Not bad on the palate, heavy but smooth enough. FAR FAR better than any of its American cousins , the Malt Liquors."
"Emptied it steadily. I could drink this stuff every day, may be my #1 micro lager for a while."
"BOSS Beer doesn't come close to the quality of Black Boss Porter, but then I didn't really think it would. It deserves credit more for what it isn't (a typically rough ESL) than for what it is. Expectations are easily exceeded when they aren't that high to begin with."
"Pours with almost no head, very little carbonation. Just lighter than a standard amber lager in color. Light hoppy odor. Light malty taste and texture. Alcohol level is just slightly noticeable. Very easy to drink. Not quite as strong as a barleywine, but noticeably stronger than your standard lager... Good stuff."
"There's obviously a good bit of adjunct to this beer, and the alcohol is quite obvious. A cooler fermentation seems to be in order. Still, it's pretty typical of a strong lager from eastern Europe (ie Latvia, Lithuania, Russian Federation, etc.), and it can be enjoyable if you're in the mood for it."
"Pours a bright golden color topped by a bright white head that vanishes after about a minute. Aroma of light sweet malt and a touch of robust fruity hops. Palate is rich and sweet, with a medium malt profile that has notes of turbinado sugar and sweet pomaceous fruit. Body is nice and creamy, very enjoyable for such a strong lager. Not something I'll drink every day, but a good change of pace."
"Drinkability: Clearly crafted in a German mold, this is a very sweet lager. It lacks depth and is not much fun to drink on its own, but it would do nicely with sausage. In fact, it would be perfect for cooking brats."
