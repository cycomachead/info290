3.04,33.3,4.25,2,3,3.5,3.75,"I have to be honest, I'm presently drinking a 500 ml can of Faxe 10% Extra Strong Beer, that I won in a bet over the Stanley Cup playoffs (go Blackhawks!). I am a Viking at heart, so the logo's kind of cool. I like the color as it resembles someone else's clear healthy urine specimen on the nurses station counter top. The aroma is reminiscent of the bed pads I wash in the long term care facility laundry room that I currently work in, so it is familiar and quite nutty, i might add. The taste is somewhat marmaladish, leaving me with a comforting tingly sensation on my palate, satisfying my desire for the bold, pungent flavor I was expecting in a beer of this strength. It is perfectly carbonated, boasting 43 tiny bubbles (no, 44...there's 45, 46, ..47, 48) that ascend into a beautiful 2 finger head with an eyelet lace. As i sip again, I am noticing something else... ..I think it is a hint of cabbage (or perhaps rhubarb) that seems to settle into a delightfully smooth aftertaste that lingers on. I actually really like this beer and don't mind the intensity as it becomes closer to room temperature. The ABV is high but the price is low ($3.35) so it is perfect for anyone who wants a good beer buzz early in the morning before going to their McJob. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely drink Faxe 10 again, especially knowing that I only need one can to forget about the bad day I may have had washing the linens in a nursing home. Ok, so here's the bottom of the can. ...last drop..alrighty then, there you have it. Faxe 10 is ok, if you ask me. Now i'm ready to tuck in.","BeerBateo","May 01, 2013"

3,31.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the wide range of aromas and flavorings. For such a strong beer it provided a wide range of grainy flavors to work with. Among these there was a surprising ester character to soften up the beginning, while a more biting hop presence took up the final legs. This is a perfect beer if you’re wandering around the streets of Rome looking for a party, but nothing you would want to sit back with and relax.","TheBrewo","0"

2.35,3.1,2,2,2.5,3.5,2,"It's malt liquor. From Europe. So it's classy malt liquor. Light yellow, with a small amount of head that quickly disappears. Smell reminded me of cheap wine, oddly. Sweet. I guess it's malty sweet, but I've never detected malts that were so winelike. Alcohol smell as well. Like one would find in... Cheap wine. Taste wasn't too bad. Very sweet, but not sickly sweet. Slight metallic twang as well. Mouthfeel was, oddly enough, very smooth. Slight bitter aftertaste, more from the alcohol than any hops used. If any hops were used at all. It's one of the better malt liquors I've had, but it's still malt liquor. Cheap, high alcohol beer meant to get you drunk. Not meant to be enjoyed.","slitherySOB","May 15, 2006"

2.43,6.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours a thick amber with a white head that fades quickly. Smells strongly of alcohol, grain, and hops. The taste is rather overwhelmed by the alcohol, and is quite bitter. The beer is sticky in the mouth, and difficult to drink, which is probably good, because I had a decent buzz after finishing the pint. More than two or three of these and I'd be pretty loaded, which is pretty much the point I think, and the reason that my college town liquor store has so much in stock.","Mandrake","May 09, 2005"

Strangely, I only saw about five bubble while looking into the glass for a while. Maybe I got a poorly packaged can. The smell is of caustic overwhelming alcohol and some slight saltyness. The taste begins with a massive hit of alcohol fire then trails of into some alcohol spicyness and German malts. The hops are very weak and only detectable in their bittering potential. The mouthfeel is pretty nasty, it makes me think of an 'aluminum aged' beer for some reason. The alcohol is noticeable though this beer is pretty cheap (though I think Kasteel Brune is still a little cheaper, and a far better beer). Its subpar, though strong.","CAMRAhardliner","0"
2.03,-11,2.5,2,2,2,2,"One would expect something boasting a 10% ABV to have the appearance other than that of Budweiser. Sadly, such is not the case from this brew from Denmark. It poured a clear, fizzy yellow in color with a crackling short-lived white head. Aromas are sweet...not a malty sweet but a candy factory sweetness. Flavor is nasty. A grainy-corny front that is quickly shoved aside by a sickly sweetness that gets worse as it warmed up. Finishes with a most unpleasant alcohol burn, much like wood feels when paint remover is applied to it. Syrupy mouthfeel and virtually no drinkability. On the plus side, I've now tried a beer from Denmark.","OldFrothingSlosh","May 30, 2004"
