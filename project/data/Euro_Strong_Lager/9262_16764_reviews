"Nose spicey malts, corn, grass, faint skunkiness & burnt caramel.  Taste crackers, slight spicey, grass, sweet malt, ABV, honey.  Ok Pils!"
""
""
"Even though its a pilsener its a very nice pilsner"
""
""
"It has a strong after taste."
""
"Flavours are a little harsher but retain some of the spicy hops and grainy malt. Some cardboard notes."

"Very tasty beer. Nothin like a Boc."

"Clear deep gold beer with a good white head. Palate is fairly dry with a light crispness. Dry malt, a little cream. Light minerals. A whisper of hop - and citrusy marmalade. Lingering finish with a nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. Finishes smooth. A touch dry but okay."

"Drinkability : an average beer in the style strong pale lager."
""
""
"Deep golden colour with a creamy two fingers foam taht takes its time to fade and leaves some lace. Smell... well, you can detect both malts and hops. Corn, liquor and a bit of barnyard. Creamy and sticky palate, medium to full body. Taste of corn, some caramel and liquor."
""
"The taste was more malts than hops with the alcohol content also being detectable in the mouth feel. Fairly thin for a 'super lager' and I'm sure three 33cl bottles would give almost anyone a hangover, even so I quite enjoyed the thing."
""
"Not very nice. A crappy lager with lots of unpleasant off-flavours and excessive booze. It's strength doesn't improve anything. It gets worse as it warms, but it wasn't good to begin with. Don't let the classy bottle deceive you - this is best avoided."
"O: Medium drinkability. Not a beer that I'll drink againr"
"Pleasant and mild aroma of hops. Good carbonnation, with a medium body. Taste of grains, with bitterness coming in the middle and fading. Alcohol of 6.4% was well hidden, and use of corn did not harm much. Above average lagers."
""
""
"Nothing to exciting or really worth noting about this strong pale lager, it started off quite nice but gradually faded to an average beer about half way down. It was drinkable but a little basic and unimaginative for my liking with nothing grabbing my attention other than perhaps the nice look of the beer."

"330ml engraved label bottle. Pokal glass. Review on jun´12 –enjoyed many times since Antonio, one of my best friends, bought it for me fifteen years ago. Bright golden color, crystal appearance. White, small bubbled, froth creates a close & creamy crown. Good retention. Sweet malty aroma & citric hop hues. Light body, moderate carbonation. Sweet maltiness & pleasant bitterness provide smooth & creamy palate. Very nice drinkability. Refreshing & flavorful."

"o: pretty decent, although the sweetness/alcohol detracts. however, coming in at the same price as Leffe/Grimbergen and almost twice as much as better lagers means I probably won't pick this up again"
"O: The taste is Ok, but the rest really doesn't stand up."
""
"slight hops in the taste. malty with a nice bitterness and also little sweetness to it. better than i expected and was definitely enjoyable, especially in the hot weather."
"Very satisfying drink with a knife's-edge balance of hoppy bitterness with toasted malt to great effect. Would love to have this one again."
"D: Good drink-ability, the alcohol content is not to terribly high. This beer makes me imagine what a high alcohol Stella would taste like. More flavor, bigger character..."
"A bit sweet but rather well balanced, worked well with dark meat."
"Serving: Bottle"
"this is the first time I've ever drank this beer with out a plate of nachos from Julios Burio here in Calgary. This is an average beer that's better with some spicy food then by itself"
"D: Had this one for 2 nights in a row at the same club. Will surely drink this one again on my return to Lleida, but will not do any effort to find this beer in Holland."
"D: A very nice beer paired with with food or by itself. Perfect with tapas."
"Has some good stuff here, but not the right stuff."
"Cool bottle aside, this prime candidate for being light-struck seems to have had its ticket punched, as such. Too bad, since I remember liking this a lot more in the past, but perhaps it was really the heat of the summer day, and the long-awaited paella."
"The bottle is intriguing - raised text for the ingredients and logos - but is unfortunately green, which can cause problems (though this bottle does not seem to have been lightstruck)."
"This is probably one of the better Spanish beers available, and as the most expensive 6-pack for sale in my local supermarket (costing twice as much as a 6-pack of Heineken), it damn well better be a good beer. I will probably ""splurge"" on an other 6 pack of this, but I'm in no hurry to do so."
"Alibi Room special import. Perfumy hops, then something off, or rotten later on in. Creamy head, creamy and also grainy mouthfeel. Above average carbonation. Drinkable and my rating is good for this one. Tigglmtl insists it is skunked and so could be."
"The three strikes I give it from totally destroying most American Macros are...almost overwelming corn sweetness as it warms, Alcoholic harshness when above occurs, and price...@ $13.49/six it's a bit on the pricey side, let's see what a $1.03 Cdn $$ vs the greenback does....if anything"
"Overall: balanced and interesting beer. Best Spanish pale lager Ive ever tasted."
"Taste was subdued hops with some other undertones (couldn't put a finger on it). Alcohol well disguised and a nice mouthfeel made this a good well crafted brew and quite drinkable."
"A good brew. A welcome departure from standard macros."
"Bottle: Poured a ginger-ale color lager with large bubble and a medium head with average retention. Very strange looking beer. Aroma of malt and crisp hops is clearly identifiable and no trace of skunk even though green bottle had to travel 3000 miles. Taste is quite refreshing with very fresh and crisp hops. Easy to distinguish from a pale lager and quite refreshing."
"Note to Self: Rated #4 Euro Strong Lager"
"Managed to get a single of this at my local, recommended by the cashier who's opinion I trust. I like the embossed green bottle it comes in, no paper label on it whatsoever. Large frothy white head on the initial pour, with a fairly impressive head retention. Deep golden in colour with an amber tint to it, good carbonation seen through a clear body. Crisp grainy malt, almost bready, with herbal hops to round out the aroma. Sweet bready malt up front for the flavour, becoming more grainy in the middle, and finishing with a bitter, somewhat astringent hop character. A full mouthfeel for a lager, rolls over the palate and tongue, but has a bit of a caustic texture to it, making it more of a sipping beer than one to tip back and chug. More impressive than what I had been expecting, but still average all things considered."
"The higher ABV makes this beer taste more like Singha than Becks. Cool find."
