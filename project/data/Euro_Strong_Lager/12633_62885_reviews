"San Miguel tries to give some strength to his beer and , even better than normal beer, fails to reach make a decent beer"

"Probably one of the best beers you can find in Spain. There are only half a dozen Iberian beers that really say something and this is one of them. Unfortunately, I don't think that you can find this outside of Spain to easily. It's a really decent beer and only costs about a $1.50 a bottle."

"330 ml. bottle Deep amber colour, decent head, so it dissapears soon, leaves a lace. Smell of grass, grain, some bread or maybe biscuit. Medium body but I found it somewhat watery, good carbanation. Taste is sweet, some caramel and citrus, grassy. Not too bad for a San Miguel, but nothing really special."

"330ml bottle. Stern glass. Deep golden color, crytal clear appearance. White, close, crown & correct retention. Subtle sweet malt & aromatic hops to the nose. Smooth flavor & mouthfeel, slightly sweet touch. Light body, light carbonation. Drinkable. ABV is not felt."

"o: it ends up overly sweet, malts, and boozy, with nothing to balance the beer in the way of hops or cut the sweetness with carbonation."

"Not overwhelming, but definitely worth a try."
"Bronze. Mouth when you feel a light syrup not really pleasant because too fast disgusting. It seems that it is a combination of three hops and a grape aged in cellars. Faced with such a conclusion, which is undergoing a presence in more alcohol too strong to preserve the balance of the beer, it is reasonable to ask whether such a hack was required. Conclusion: do not drink San Miguel, no matter its name, when you go to Spain."
