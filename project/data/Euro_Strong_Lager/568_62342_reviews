"This has more malt flavour than you get with lagers. I like malt but this one doesn't really come together very well."

"This pours a clear, golden-yellow color with some initial foaming but poor to no foam retention. There’s a honeyed, malty-sweet aroma. Rice? Corn? Some cereal malt hints nip at the edges. The flavor has a rounded crispiness to it. Lacking any hop flavor or aroma, although there’s a mild bite on the flavor. Warms with some mild harshness masquerading as sharpness. At 7% it’s surprisingly strong for such a thin-bodied brew. Everything that I expected, although that doesn’t mean I’ll go out of my way to have it again."
"Smells and tastes of cooked corn, green apples, and a touch of musty graininess with a little touch of solvent alcohol. Yup, it's a malt liquor all right. However, it does merit mentioning that the harsh alcohol burn seen in a typical malt liquor is actually somewhat restrained in this brew. It's there, just not right up in front of everything like usual."
"A largely inoffensive drink that goes down easily and maybe dangerously so."

"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Not extremely intriguing, but not boring either."
"Sweet, grainy, grape and apple flavors. Dry finish, low to medium carbonation. Not especially clean, but it does the job. Dull bitterness in the back, husky grainy flavor dominates. Overall not the worst, but far from the best. This is cheap crunk juice."
"Dr: High ABV and dirt cheap by Irish standards. A crap beer at a great price. For what it is, it's not a bad choice for a night in with the lads."
"At $1.49 per bottle, this is a decent option for getting drunk on a malt beverage on a budget."
"Not a bad brew but nothing here warrants the premium tag over any other Euro strong. Not a bad deal at $1.75 for 500mL."
