3.46,23.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 12/6/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, white grape, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with decent balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too fruity/estery on the nose. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and slightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid pale lager style. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 01, 2014"

Imagine malt vinegar you put on boardwalk fries, but on crack&steroids. Yes, its THAT overpowering. The appearance was that of malt vinegar. I could barely get over the disgusting smell before I took a swig. After I swallowed it, the fumes were just too much&it came right back out. I don't mean to bash this product, this is just my firsthand experience when I drank it. Judging by the bottle itself, I'm assuming this is the Russian equivalent to a 40 oz of malt liquor here in the States.

Very mild and tender though, with a slight sweetness reminiscent of honey for a nice balance. As it travels over the tongue it becomes milder, feeling almost watery with a slight grassy, tart flavour as if it were tea. The finish is bold but now overpowering. Nutty, sweet and savory with the honey backing it. The flavours don't necessarily harmonize but do compliment one another well. This a well adjusted, flavorful lager.

There is also some cheap hops to balance, giving it sort of a pilsner-like taste. There's fruity, yeastiness present too. It's not as clean as other euro strongs. Tastes less like a chemistry project and more like a beer. This would probably be top notch to a beer snob within this particular category. However, I like that higher alcohol taste and am sad to see it lacking in this beer. However, it's still a decent lager and unique from anything else you can buy in America, so I will probably be getting it again.

The flavors were actually not bad, given how strong this beer was. I tasted the cereal grains first and foremost but behind that was a more subtle note of pilsner malt and bread. However, these distinctions did have to be made by ignoring the undeniable punch of booze that left no doubt this was a Euro Strong Lager. My Russian gf used to get hammered drinking this with her friends when she was younger and I can see how that easily could have gone down. I actually didn’t mind the flavors, including the punch, but I’m sure many would not be impressed. The mouthfeel however was nice, the body medium and the carbonation light.

Those sweet malty grains morph into a biting alcohol presence which dominates. The heaviness in the flavor makes it hard to finish the entire the half-liter bottle.

Taste is a lot of phenols and bitterness. A good deal of those malts, but with bitter-beer face to follow. Possibly alcohol-face as well. Finishes strong, like a punch to the liver. A sickeningly sweet aftertaste that you just have to wash down with more Baltika #9. Speaking of, will this pass Magic Hat in the beer lexicon popularity of said number? I doubt it.

The alcohol nose on this is quite harsh. Hints of apricot and apple in the nose as well. Taste is sweet with grainy bready malts. The same fruits in the nose make their way into the taste, but are drenched in higher alcohols. Tastes like someone literally took a malt liquor and added some vodka to it.

This had Minhas-stink all over it, from the bubble gum sweetness to the plastics factory interior and even a little gasoline thrown in for good measure. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was Russian for "Cyberman". Oh, kill me now! It was the all-too-familiar taste of overworked yeast, adjuncts and fusel alcohol. It pains me that one of the primary tenents of The CANQuest (TM) states that "In order to qualify for inclusion, the entirety of the CAN's CANtents MUST be CANsumed. If a drain pour occurs, the quester MUST open a new CAN and drink its CANtents." I really hate whoever wrote these rules ...

Maybe that accounts for the sweetness. Other than that, this is a good beer and held up well on the shelf -- the production date was ll months before I bought it for $2.99 in a grocery store.

The flavor bounces back and forth between table sugar and green apples with hints of grainy malts mixed in. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the 8% ABV could barely be detected under the sweetness.

Wow, this is not what I expected at all,after my last Baltika experience I was looking forward to something a bit smoother and enjoyable,this is neither. Barely drinkable, I do not blame others for pouring this out. This is garbage,must be Russia's version of Shlitz Bull Ice.

There is, perhaps, a slight fusel note. It is medium bodied-- a little bubbly and syrupy, with a sticky finish. It tastes sweet. It's like... barley pop. It pretty much tastes like malt extract. There is the slightest green bitterness, but it's mostly just that sweet malt flavor. It's almost like it wasn't fully fermented.

The reason I bought this is because for 3 bones I was able to get 75 oz of beer in a large brown textured plastic bottle. The bottle has been textured so it reminds me of bad plaster work. The kicker about this beer is that it was exactly 1 year out of date when I bought it. I went up to the front of the store to ask about it and was informed that they had just received it (no dust on the bottle) and everything they get from that brewer comes that old. On to the review. Poured the first glass into my Chimay Chalice. This beer looks like someone fermented dirty dishwater. Slightly murky with no carbonation. I definitely think that the plastic bottle made it impossible to hold the carbonation for this long. Aroma is really sweet, like unrefined sugar and bananas. Taste is mildly interesting. Much of the same but the mildly interesting thing about it is it feels like there is an analgesic in the beer. Something is making my tongue numb. This is definitely the first experience I've had like this with a beer. Mouthfeel is numbing. Its drinkable but not great. Definitely if you need a beer to buy as a joke look for the big brown plastic bottle that says 9 Extra Lager. It looks like a bull's-eye. Pick it up.","hwwty4","Feb 23, 2008"

Aroma was lemony, perfumey, alcoholic, and slightly vegetal, but overall not a bad smell for the style. Taste was rather simplistic due to the excessively sweet and underattenuated body. The hops were present, and evident, but not in a quantity sufficient to offset the sweetness. Unlike the domestic malt liquors, I could not detect any harsh adjunct flavors. There was a nice lemon twist sourness imparted by the clean lager yeast strain. Alcohol was not too obtrusive either. The bottle had a best before date of 4 September 05, so I guess the ageing on the shelves of Greens did this beer some good. Either that, or I just like this one better than most of you.","rajendra82","Aug 15, 2005"

Very aggressive carbonation rips across the tongue, barely giving anything a chance to be sampled. Herbal raw bitterness leads the second advance moving to a mild alcohol bite wrapped in residual sweetness. Simplest way to describe this would be malt liquor with hops, and not quite as thick.

The smell is quite unusual in that, it doesn't really smell quite like any other beer or ale that I've had before. One can smell a wee bit of yeast, but other characteristics seem to me, unidentifiable. The taste, like the smell, is peculiar. Not bad or dis-satisfying, just peculiar. It goes down easy (the 8,0abv is evident when it hits bottom; to one who is used to quite mild beers and ales) but all in all, there's nothing terribly wrong with this one.

However, in typical Russian-style, the medium body is coupled with a fine-bubbled but moderate carbonation that leaves it more smooth & creamy than crisp. Still, it's fairly nice and doesn't work against the beer. The flavor is mainly of sweet grainy malt with a light touch of hop flavor and a supportive bitterness.
