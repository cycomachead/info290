"I've had many beers across the world, but this one is by far the best. There's no beer in America that can even compare or come close. Strong alcohol content and a sweet taste. Enjoyed this beverage at many establishments in Legnica Poland. Does anyone know where I can order this from in the U.S.?"

"Overall, after the initial bad smell, this is not that bad for what it offers. I am now already down to half the glass, drinking it rather quickly and I already find it better than when I opened the can. Either it gets better once it warms up, which I doubt, or the 7% ABV has gotten me."

"D- suprisingly high in alcohol; not a bad beer, but not great."
"O - A nice flowery beer, a bit sweet and not to bitter."
"B'ham UK March 2011"
"A pleasant one compared to others in the genre. Would definetly drink it again, but I have other preferences in this bracket"
"This beer was fairly bland and slightly watery, no real aroma. I consider 7% abv quite strong but the beer hides this very well, i was expecting a drain cleaner for taste but it's a very drinkable lager just don't expect too much taste(hops/malt etc). Blandish macro, was a good price, would buy again."
"This beer had been reduced to Â£1 as it was slightly over its BBE date, I bought the last bottle and this WILL be my last bottle of this beer. Debowe Mocne could be even 'gassier' than San Miguel and that is some statement from me as I thought nothing could be as bad as that which is why I have only given it 1 for drinkability."
"The sun obviuosly helped to mellow my thoughts and I needed a refreshing drink, which this beer gave me, but I think my first review is now somewhat unfair on this above average product."
"D: A gift from my Polish boss. While this goes down quite easy for a Mocne, it's not a very pleasant experience. Feels rather unbalanced."
"pleasant taste, kind of malty and bready with some light fruity notes...quite pleasing for a strong lager, lacking the usual sweet nasty syruppy taste - a very drinkable brew"
"This beer reminds me of malt liquor from the states and it's for the same purpose. I am disappointed and I was expecting more from a 7% beer."
"Poured a light amber color with a medium-sized white head. The head dissipated but left some mild lacing. Mellow aromas of malt, metallic grain, and mild hops. Taste is sweet and bitter malt, light hops with a fruity quality. Some light spice notes in there too. Pleasant carbonation. A nice and drinkable lager, went well with some Polish meats and cheese at a picnic in Warsaw. Certainly a pick over the Zywiec lager everyone was drinking."
"Overall - An OK beer - nothing groundbreaking... Better than the initial aroma indicated... worth a try..."
"500 ml can, bought in Poland. Golden to amber colour, large head. Fairly strong sweetish musty and fruity aroma. Flavour is fairly malty and sweet with evident alcoholic notes, partially balanced by tolerable hops. I had it on its own at cellar temperature, would probably prefer it cold with a solid Polish meal."
"i'm not about to pick this over a baltic porter, but it's way ahead of some of those awful pale lagers"
