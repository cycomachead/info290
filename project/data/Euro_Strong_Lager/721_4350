There's not much that can be said from this other than that the alcohol content wasn't hidden at all in the taste and overpowered everything else the beer had to offer, which was a real shame as the aroma was pretty good for the style.","flyingpig","Jan 23, 2014"

Taste is strong of alcohol, some malts, mot paticularly pleasant or enjoyable. Feels light in e mouth and overall there is nothing special about this beer.","tone77","May 08, 2013"

1.78,-28.5,1.5,1,2,2.5,2,"Carlsberg Special Brew...what was I expecting ? Let me be concise - this was shit smelling cabbage water carbonated with farts, aged in camel balls and coloured with fly squash. This vile liquid exists in its Asian avatar mostly in Malaysia, so unless you are on your death bed because of dehydration and have nothing else around - stay away !","BeerSingh","Sep 02, 2009"
3.94,58.2,3,4,4,4,4,"This beer is exceptional compared to its American counterparts. I consider this to be the European version of American malt liquor and high gravity lagers, which is the preferred fare of the indigent stateside. If that is so, then the hobos in London are really living it up. They're a bit more posh than American hobos as you might expect. The smell of this was classic bad beer taste and alcohol. The taste was more of the same. Grainy and alcohol, but in addition, it had just enough astringency to accompany the alcohol burn. It was perfect. And the hops were very basic, they didn't add any undesirable flavours to the beer, just a basic astringency. It was the perfect mix of grains, astringency, and alcohol. And it wasn't overly sweet either like the American counterparts often are. It tasted like there may have been some corn syrup adjunct, but it was hard to tell. It certainly wasn't overdone to the same extent as American malt liquors. This is a prize gem in hobo beer. I'm bringing back a pack to the states.","ElCommodoro","Beers"

2.95,18.5,2,2,3.5,1.5,4,"Drinkability - For a 8.8% ABV it was a bit bland. No real complexity that a beer of that strength can have. Didn't have that nice hoppy bite or crispness a good lager can have either. Not brilliant but when compared to other macrolagers, this isn't too bad and I found it easy to knock back.","Tagger24","Nov 01, 2007"

1.75,-29.7,2,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"Appearance is just as you'd expect: pale, clear, and yellow. Some head, not much retention though thanks to an 8.6% alcohol content. Aroma is surprisingly light, considering the assault on the senses that follows: light alcohol, malt. Tastes like someone took Bud Light and dropped in a shot of 151: horrible boozy aftertaste and finish. I found myself wincing after every sip. Mouthfeel is more or less what you'd expect in the style: light and fizzy. Really horrible, will actively avoid. Surprised it's not worse-reviewed on BA.","hunteraw","Jan 25, 2007"
2.16,-13.3,3,2,2,2,2.5,"I'm actually slightly torn about this beer, since it often provided a respite in 95*F heat and 95% humidity in Singapore and Malaysia from the solid but thick Guinness Export (8%) and the less thick and less solid Danish Royal Stout (8%.) In Malaysia, on duty-free Langkawi island, it's a mere USD$0.50 per can, and the standard swill in these countries truly isn't worth paying for, including normal Carlsberg; Tiger isn't fit to wash sidewalks with.","warmstorage","May 01, 2006"
2.02,-18.9,4,2,1.5,3,2,"Drinkability: For all its faults, this beer is not all that difficult to drink. Salty snacks make it all the more palatable. If you're just looking to get drunk quickly, this is a fairly safe and inexpensive avenue to do so.","soulgrowl","Sep 03, 2004"
2.6,4.4,3,3,2.5,3,2,"Other comments: The bottle advises that it be served ""extra chilled"". Gee, can't imagine why. There's even a color-changing thermometer on the label to be doubly sure that you get it cold enough. So, that's what I did. Not sure I would want to try it at the warmer temps that I usually prefer when reviewing a beer.","GreenCard","Mar 22, 2004"
