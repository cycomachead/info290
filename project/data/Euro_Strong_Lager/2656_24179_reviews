review_text
"From bottle to shaker glass at Polonia in Hamtramck. Pours a deep amber color, little head. Smell is malt and fruit, caramel and raisin. Taste is smooth, finish is crisp, mouthfeel is almost creamy, much fuller than I expected. Not something I'd seek out, but not gonna pass it up if I see it out and about."
"Alcohol % on label says 6.5%, not the 7.00% listed in the description. Purchased at a local Polish deli. Color is a dark amber. Head disappears fairly quickly.  Taste is lackluster; a bit watery and weak and not and rather fizzy. Not at all like the back label description of ""Intense, rich, full bodied taste..."" .  Perhaps it suffered from being on the patio during a freezing night or two, but (judging by other ratings here), perhaps not. Drinkable, but not one I would buy again."

"Overall: hmm... I think the bottle says it best ""Strong Beer - Unique Taste"". Very interesting, and no alcohol whack for being 7%. I think worth another go, specifically as it is far cheaper than most beers of this ABV - it is a reasonable, higher ABV refreshing ale. Not great, but good for the last week before pay day."

"Pours a brownish-gold color with a fluffy but quickly-dissipating white head. Aroma was heavy malt with dark fruit. Taste is malt, dark fruit, with honey and vanilla. Hops barely detectable, though there was a slight, crisp finish. Smooth creamy palate. Nothing spectacular, but I liked the flavor and alcohol warmth in this on a cool fall day."
""
"Poured at a good temperature with a large, foamy, off-white head that soon settled down to a scummy islandand ring. Color is a clear medium honey amber with a lot of large bubble trails. Aroma is coincidently of malt, honey, hop. Flavor is mainly two parts: sweet and carbonic tang with a little bitter in back. If it weren't for the pronounced carbonation, it would be about undrinkable. Even so.... Body is ok, while carbonation seems forced. Finish is like flavor, has significant alcohol warmth, and is totally forgettable. A fairly shallow brew. Not for repetition."
""

"So for those days when you're watching football or whatever and want to get buzzed, forget Bud or Yuengling and pick up a few 4-packs of this stuff. Well worth it."
""
"I'd drink this again."
""
""
"Overall - one of the better ones in the style, the nose isn't great, but everything else is enjoyable, refreshing, boozy enough to get a buzz on and affordable. May repeat this one yet again."

"O - A reasonably tasty euro strong lager, flavour is mild, but at 7% this stuff is surprisingly drinkable. Probably wouldn't buy it again but I wouldn't turn one down if offered."
""
"O: This is a really easy beer to drink and hides its alcohol very well. I liked the maltiness and thicker mouthfeel compared to other malt liquors, especially the American varieties."

"O: A good strong lager, all my relatives were crushing it, and there arent many 7% that I'd imagine they'd like, that counts for something. A boring style well executed perhaps. A good ""table beer""."
"Pours a dark golden treacle colour with a limited head. Aroma of smoky and sweet malts, however the flavour leans more towards a ""malt beverage"" or simple barley wine. Unfortunately the alcohol burn in the finish is the most pronounced feature. Although my experience is limited, I don't believe this is Poland's best!"
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a sweet finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a better smell than taste in my opinion."
""
""
"This beer tasted better than it smelled and exceeded my expectations. This might even pair well with Polish food. All in all, this might be worth trying again."
""
"Overall: When you factor in price and what your getting out of the beer, it is like hitting lotto buying this beer. I really liked it, was it the best beer ever no but it was damn sure satisfying. Salud!"
"I think the flavour starts to improve as the beer warms. Finish remains somewhat sour, although aftertaste is smooth. This beer definitely has some redeeming characteristics and is starting to grow on me a bit more from when I first tasted it. Not amazing but not terrible."
""

"It's hard not to give Warka Strong a decent rating. It's my regular ""go to"" beer. It's a bit malty with some sweet notes. The color is between dark yellow and amber, but the head doesn't hold up as well as with other beers. The mouthfeel is somewhat crisp and, as other reviewers have mentioned, there isn't much of a bitter aftertaste. It's fairly strong (7% ABV). Comes in pint-sized bottles."
""
"the label wasn't real clear that this was the ""Strong"" version, but the 7% abv was noted on the label. decent, my first Polish beer."

"An okay beer."

"Not a bad beer for a winter night, at it's price and size. I drank it solo but it would pair well with almost any lunch, dinner or snack."
"O - Not bad really. Not sure what would be the right time and place for drinking this stuff. Sweet and boozy without much else."
"O - I was pleasantly surprised here. An inexpensive Polish beer at the local store, with a good balance of flavor and drinkablity. A complete steal for about $1.50 for a half litre."
"Final Grade: 3.56, a B grade."
"O: Wow. Not at all what I was expecting. A well balanced beer, that was enjoyable from first sip to last. Not necessarily a beer or style I would hunt for, but a beer worth revisiting."
"Are you drinking a wimpy Polish beer? Wanna get the girls' attention? Then try Warka Strong: A Stronger Beer for a Stronger Man. ... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty white foam. The nose comprises musty caramel, light wheat, light buttery biscuits, and a definite air of green apple flesh. The taste pushes the green apple to the fore, fruity caramel (still as musty as before), a light twinge of alcohol, sweet flowers, and straight cane sugar. It's all just a sweet, boozy mess. The body is a hefty-aspiring medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a sorta painful beer to drink. It's too sweet, it's too fruity, and there's way too much alcohol on the tongue for the ABV."
"Overall I wasn't expecting to like this and didn't, but was quite surprised at how bad it wasn't. This was a sample and samples are always great 'cause they're free. Not a bad example of a European Lager. Thanks Bill for this freebee!!"
"Overall, there are really quite a lot of beers in the world, and this seems to be just one of them. Average"
"Nope, this is not my kind of beer, boozy, sticky and frankly quite uninteresting. I do not understand the ranking it got so far ..."
"This beer pours a light bodied bright copper in color with a one finger white head. It smells of pale malts and that's about it. The flavor is of only pale malt and light honey. It is so, so light. The honey like sweetness is moderately appealing though. It drinks so, so light in body and is pretty thin. This beer just isn't complex in any manner. I can see why the store can't keep it in stock, being 1.99 but I wouldn't drink this again. It's a middle of the road beer."
"Overall this is a good beer for the price and will get this again when needed. $1.80 for a 500ml single."
"Overall - I was happy with the fact that it was at least a little bit different than the hundreds of other euro beers that are available at the lcbo. It had a little bit of a Vienna lager aspect to it. That being said, it still wasn't anything fantastic. Happy I tried it, but wouldn't buy it again."
"not a drainpour but hard to finish."
"Pleasantly suprised, thought this would be an alcoholic street drinker special, this isn't the case."
"all around i'd say this is a pretty solid beer. i tend to shy away from lagers, but this is a beer i'll be revisiting in the future."
" D- This beer has a nice character in the aroma but no follow through in the flavor. The sweetness is almost syrupy with out much support."
"Dr: Not going to buy it again. It is an interesting take on the style, and is fairly high ABV (relatively speaking), but it doesn't appeal to me."
"B'ham UK Dec 2010"
"For the price this beer is worth a try. This is my first time reviewing it, I usually drink this beer after a heavy hitting barleywine, it makes for a nice change of pace and goes great with any kind of beef."
"Pours an amber color with one finger of fluffy head that fades with minimal lacing. The aroma is a mix of nutty and green hops and sweet grain/adjunct. The taste starts out pretty thin, but then builds into a creamy, strangely sweet end. Its a bit on the flat side, which exasperates the sweetness, which almost reminds me of honey. Finish is slightly lingering, will some mild bitterness coming through and the body is medium. The bottle does a good job of describing this one - it says ' Beer Unique Taste' around the top and I'd have to agree."
"Final Thoughts: When I drink this, I'm perplexed. It honestly tastes like I'm drinking a high class malt liquor, which then begs the question, if you are drinking malt liquor are you really looking for something high class? I wouldn't pick up this beer again, but I'll give it one thing. I was honestly expecting it to fare a lot worse."
"D: I would drink this again."
"I bought a single 16.9 bottle just to try something new. It had a much darker color than I expected. I also was not aware of this beers strength. It sure does pack a punch at 7 percent. There is a strong aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. The consistency of this beer is good for a session, but not at 7 percent. Just an average beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep golden color lager with a medium bubbly head with minimal retention and light lacing. Aroma of adjunct is kind of gross with loads of residual sugar. Taste is also dominated by adjunct and sugar which does not make for an interesting drink. Body is quite full with an oily feel and medium carbonation. Light notes of fusel alcohol are perceptible. I don't see myself drinking this again in the near future."
"Not a bad beer, but a little too sweet to drink too much of."
"Overall, it's fine, but I don't think I'd go looking for it. I've tried a couple others of this style, and I'd have to say it's significantly better than average, but maybe the style just isn't much to write home about."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some alcohol. Taste is of malts, caramel, some alcohol, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D: While the alcohol would certainly load up after a few of these, I'm afraid the overwhelming sweetness would get me well before then. This is a smooth, quality strong lager that was a good pick from my local Polish supermarket. I just wish it had more of a hop profile."
"D: Drinks reasonably easy, though it is a bit high on the ABV side (higher than it tastes)."
"One of the better Polish beers I've encountered at the LCBO. Nothing to get too excited about, but still a fine effort. I'll probably pick up another bottle or two to get me through this wintry week..."
"Notes: Seems kind of like a Polish malt liquor. Flavors just don't quite work for me, but they grew on me a bit. I'm not entirely sure why, but they are just a little off to me."
"From the 500 ml. bottle that does have a ""best by"" date but it is unreadable. Sampled on February 22, 2010. The pour is actually kind of copper-amber with beautiful clarity but virtually no head to speak of. The aroma is malty with a bit of licorice and a vague dash of hops. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. The taste is sweet, well-malted and has a nice toasted bread backdrop. There is also a hard liquor feel to it as well like bourbon. It was a strong ale that did a yeoman's job hiding the 7% ABV."
"D - Meh, I've had worse, but I wouldn't track this beer down."
"First off, the picture of the beer should be changed because it has long since changed to a new label. I saw Warka Strong at work, Wines Unlimited of Stratford CT, and noticed many of our European and especially Polish customers would purchase this item like hot cakes. While many of our other imports would be at a stand still this beer remained supreme. This encouraged me to at least try it, of course. When I first drank this beer I was very impressed by how smooth it was for a beer at 7%. It was a light amber color, plentiful taste of semi sweet characteristics that weren't overwhelming. Warka Strong is a delicious beer, and has a nice firm but subtle finish that doesn't linger a nasty hop-full mouth. After having this beer, I researched it, and have gathered the following: Warka Strong is a Polish Beer, from Zywiec Group, also available in a lower AVB, and is paired well with Polish pastries that include blueberries, and also buttered toasts. However, the beer is good by itself. Nothing to scream about, but impressive. This beer is available to our store through a small distributor called Amtec, in Fairfield County in Connecticut that has an all Polish Beer portfolio."
"11.2 ounce bottle. I hate when the imports jip me of that .8 of an ounce. The ""best before date"" is six months from now. Golden bronze color with a short-lived head and good clarity. Occasional bubbles stream to the surface. The aroma is better than what I'm used to in strong lagers. There's a welcomed absence of that alcohol/chemical scent. I only detect sweet carmel maltyness and grain. Good texture and it leaves that sticky sweet film on your teeth. Sweet malt flavor with a little carmel and perhaps a tiny trace of honey. Starts off easy and gets heavy towards the end in terms of drinkability. Pretty filling. Good beer."
"I got a little more then expected while drinking this one and that's never a bad thing."
"While just a wee bit one-sided, this is an enjoyable and drinkable enough strong Euro lager, without any of the bitter edge or skunkiness I've come to expect from its forebears around here. The alcohol that begets the 'strong' denomination is noticeable, sure, but pretty well integrated, for the most part."
"This Polish lager tastes a wee bit like a Scottish ale to me. Quite enjoyable, I believe I will head back to the shop I got this and look for a sixer."
"D - Better on the colder side as the adjuncts come out a little more as it warms but I was still pleasantly surprised."
"D - Drinkable yes but I find it's lacking some flavor."
"This beer pours a pale golden colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with average lacing,the first aroma i get is straight out malty honey not much else gets thru,it has an average mouthfeel with a honeyish,malty weak hop taste to it which finishes pretty smooth,this is definately i beer that im glad ive tried but wont go out of my way for it again."
"Drinkability- ok for an euro lager, probably won't buy it again"
"Drinkability: I'm not terribly impressed. This is a beer that I'm glad I tried, but I doubt will get again."
"Drink- I wont buy it again. I guess if you want a high alcohol sweet tasting lager, go for it."
"A decent brew. Would work well with a fully loaded pizza. Surprisingly balanced in the style. Well worth a try if you can pick up a bottle."
"My friend offered this beer to me when I was over to his house for dinner. He warned that it was strong and boy he was not kidding. The beer had a hint of a sweet taste to it but the bitterness on the tongue made it clear that it was not something that I was willing to drink more than one of at a time. It had no real aftertaste. Definitely would recommend."
"I'm glad that I tried this, but I'd like to try other types of this style to compare to, and will probably try other Polish beers before coming back to this one."
"This is a remarkably average sort of beer, with it falling short on a lot of its aspects. Decent, but certainly not fantastic."
"Not a fan."
"A lager on steroids."
"Would recommend trying especially at $1.50 a bottle. If the belgian strong ales are little expensive this is a nice alternative."
"Warka poured a pale orange kinda burnt orange that looked like it wanted to turn light brown. Nice inch white head that dissapates quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell was grainy, bready, with scent of alcohol present. It also had a sweetness smell I have difficulty labeling almost like juicey. Tasted of sweet caramel with some nuttiness, the 7% wasnt detectable in the taste. The mouthfeel was smooth with nice coating. The drinkability would be high if it werent for the fact that its a strong euro lager."
"This is one of the smoothest strong beers I've ever tasted. I wish there was a little more hop aroma and bitterness but it's still a really good beer."
"So this is essentially Euro-macro-malt liquor? Hey, I've had much worse. The mild grainy sweetness must go well with pierogi."
"The taste is also very nice, with bread, a hint of herbs and pine, light fruit mix, grapes, bread crust, and a light smokey-woody quality in the finish. It has a flowery quality and is zesty but in feel becomes a bit watery and flat by the finish. Otherwise, it's quite good, with plenty of nice flavour, if a bit on the sweet side. It has a light bitterness but could use a bit more. It's smooth and easy to drink and stays interesting."
"D: This beer packs a wallop. One 500ml bottle was enough for me. Definitely not a session beer in my mind. Worth a revisit."
"D: A pleasant surprise, making for a solid recommend and drink. Definitely one of the better and stronger beers ive had out of Poland and worthy of a buy and try."
"I tried this beer on February 11, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The poured a translucent gold colour with a slight reddish tinge. The head was thin, and white, and there was quite a bit of effervescence. The aroma was rather weak, nothing at all that comes to mind aside from some grassy hints. The mouthfeel was light. almost watery, and little carbonation. The taste was very grassy was well, with some malty hints."
"Amber body with a nice off-white head gives this Polish lager a pleasing appearance. The aroma has grainy notes mixed in with lemon. The initial flavour impression is of sweetness, with bunches of caramel malt. Thankfully is settles down after the first few sips and becomes better integrated into the overall taste, which although still sweet malt heavy, now reveals a husky graininess and a slight bitter kick in the finish. Probably still too much sweetness to earn more than an average mark. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying...easily the heaviest I have come across in a lager. The carbonation is about right for the drink and prevents it from becoming too cloying. Pretty drinkable, and a pleasant surprise."
"Pours a hazy dark gold, fizzy head rises up, smells of more fusel based alcohol, grains and hops as well. Body is a little muddled, taste is strong, nice hoppy kick near the end. The beer has character is well constructed, I enjoyed drinking it and it was fine but there was nothing unique or exciting about it."
"D= I really like this beer, but that sweetness keeps me from wanting more than one. If it was only slightly less sweet, the high abv would make it a killer session beer."
"A hop flavor of fresh cut grass develops late. A fine polish lager. A bit sweet, understated nose - but full bodied, warming, and flavorful. A well constructed beer."
"Me Tarzan. You Jane. Warka Strong. Actually, the beer isn't very strong and it isn't very good either. I almost wish the alcohol was more prominent. Malt liquors and Euro strong lagers need to be ballsy to be good. This one is simply boring and forgettable."
"This is one helluva beer. Wish I would have tried it sooner. By far one of the best polish brew's I've ever locked my lip's onto. A must try for bock lover's. My bottles said best by 6/ 2008 so I know it's fresh. Very very good. Dont pass this one up"
"D - Not too bad for what it is - definitely malt-liquor-y and there's a forced booziness, but drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is kind of heavy and allows for good transitions in the mouth. Little carbonation to speak of on the tongue. Try this beer and don't be fooled by the look."
"Tallboy cans, very fresh. Smooth with no off flavors, nice toasted malt and sweet apple notes. Clean and refreshing, it's a solid budget buy for the style. Raising scores a little bit."
"Well done and tastey when fresh."
"Overall: A good brew, malty, pleasant and understated. Worth a try."
"I like this beer. Give it a try."
"Lots of bubbles streaming to the top of my glass and a small one finger head that is white and didnt last long.Clear,golden body,it looks very lagerish.I smell carmel and rice.Carmel in the taste and its pleasant.Nice lacing on the glass,mouthful is good but you can taste the alcohol in this and that brings the mouthful and drinkability down a notch.This isnt a bad beer but I wouldnt seek it out or anything like that.Thanks to Stosh for this beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good but this is not a beer you are likely to chug. Really I think this should be considered a bock beer, it certainly tastes like one."
"Pours a clear amber/gold, big fluffy white head, settles down to a thin ring rather quick, some lace spots. Smell is sweet, some citrus, minor skunk, booze, metallic, one of the better for this style I've smelled. Taste is not bad at all, almost a figgy caramelized flavour to it, citrus, floral, booze isn't out of control, weak finish, but quite enjoyable when cold, alcohol does not show itself at all. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium carbonation. Surprisingly okay."
"Pours with an almost orange colour. Very little head to speak of. Somewhat dusty malt smell, with a bit of fruit. Beer has a very bready taste, with some dry crackers and even cookies. Dark fruit taste, with a tad of citrus. DOES NOT IMPROVE WITH WARMTH! Oh man. I drink the beer a bit cool at first, and then let it warm. Usually, this improves smell and taste. Not with this. Beer warms, and their is a foul dust taste. Reminds me of an attic. If the beer is warm, taste is a 2.0. Cold, 3.0. I'll give it the cold rating. Has a carbonation similar to sodas. Still, a bit creamy. Drinkable only when cold."
"If it's ice cold, & I mean, near frozen, it is good malt liquer. If it starts to get warm, you better start sucking on some keilbasa, or you're in line for one sharp headache."
"A really fresh malty smell. Reminds of when I was in Munich even though this is a Polish beer. Th common denominator being that it's fresh and robust. There are many Eastern European brews at the LCBO and most are pale, and some are putrid but some are very fine. This one is very fine. It's strong and flavourful. Warka you are my friend."
"Pretty close to malt liquor in my opinion - sweet, bland and alcoholic."
"Honeyish colour with fast dissapearing head. No aroma. Taste was a bit of malt, a bit of bitter. A drop of fruit and spice. Neutral mouthfeel, slightly grainy. I would like more malt, and yet not all that bitter. Not too drinkable. There are a lot better Polish beers about."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the clear golden amber brew. Foamy head lasts well, with good lacing. Aroma is sweet, somewhat adjuct-laden, as expected for the style. Taste really follows the nose, the adjunct notes are present throughout, but actually not so much in a bad way. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth from beginning to end, esp for the style, and drinkability is great. Reminds me of DFH Malt Liquor, just not quite as strong. Surprisingly worth a try."
"Keep this one cold, becomes much less drinkable as it warms. Could be sessionable, but not to hard to find something better. Wont be buying this one again."
"I don't suggest this as a session beer, But it is certainly worth a try."
"Taste isn't unpleasant when very cold. Some nuttiness, summer fruit such as apple and apricot. Spicy notes followed by a wholesome breadiness. As it warms though, the taste becomes almost too sweet to bear. There's no decent hops to balance this out, and that makes things very hard. Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated but very creamy smooth. Drinkability is low because I need to worry about the dentist bills incurred by drinking more than one of these in a row."
"Overall - A pretty decent strong lager - nothing amazing but probably worth a try..."
"Lately I have been induging in a variety of Polish beers that are readily available in the Buffalo area and I have to say for the most part I have been pleasantly suprised.This poured a beep clear golden with a quick to form and quick to fade 1/2 finger white head,somewhat sweet and toasty in the nose a little caramel and hints of alchol even more so as it warms.Nice full mouthfeel it even seems to coat the mouth a little starts out with some caramel sweetness over top of some toasty grain the alcohol seems to stay in check there is a subtle peppery spic in the finish wich caps it off quite well.Being of Polish dissent its great to try the different beers from there many of wich people have no idea about."
"This beer pours a clear, light copper color with a moderately-sized, stable soapy head. Its a fresh aroma thats focused on light malts and grassy smells, backed with just a slight whiff of hops. The aroma isnt all it could be, but its pleasant, mild, fresh, and inviting. Not much alcohol in the aroma, given the ABV. The taste left me a little under-whelmed. A serious sweetness, without a corresponding malt quality, is the first thing that hits you. Dont get me wrong, theres malt in the taste, its just not pronounced in a manner that corresponds to the sweetness. This leaves the beer with a hollow, and just this side of cloying feeling. I wouldnt call it well balanced. Behind the sweetness, theres some grassiness. A lot more hops would help. Moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is very nice.full, soft, rounded, and mouthfilling. It definetly gives you the sense that youre drinking something substantial, which is nicevery filling. I wish that there were some complexity to the flavor to go along with it. All in all, this one isnt badit would go well with some polish food (Bigos?). On its own, its not a standout. I probably wouldnt buy it again."
"I have had beers with higher abv's that cover the alcohol taste more. This has little else, except leaving something of a sticky, caramel flavor. Nevertheless, the watery qualities does even it out a bit. I was easily able to finish it, but was not feeling the need to go get more. It's better than malt liquors, but not by much. The thought that I had after it was a Polish version of a ""lets get bombed"" brew. While not offensive it really doesn't have much to it to make it anything above average."
"Poured a highlighty amber with some spearse lacing and a one finger head that quickly disappeared into nothingness. Smell was a metallic, toasted malt with a few bananas. Tasted almost the same as the smell except instead of a metallic taste, it was more like hard water and the malt presence was more pronounced. Hop flavor is pretty light. Taste likes German hops were used."
"This is a very complex, full flavored lager. Its definitely the second best Polish beer Ive tried so far (after Okocim Porter). Highly recommended."
"Clear coppery colour. Nice lacing off the pour, after the head recedes a bit. Quite a rich caramel malty aroma, very mildly hopped. Mild bitterness that's present throughout, just not the focus here. Malt is definitely the focus. Light caramel and brown sugar with some nuttiness. There's a bit of spicy alcohol in the finish as well. Medium bodied, slightly drying. Easily quaffable with more flavour than I expected."
"This was my first Polish beer, and cannot say I was dissapointed. It was a nice change of pace from the strong hopped out American beers that I typically drink. Rather than an extreme hoppiness, there was a very deep and layered maltiness. What I most liked about the malt profile was the distinct nuttiness. Despite the high alcohol level, it is quite drinkable, and a beer that I will not hesitate to drink again."
"Looks nice, rich amber color and a reasonable white head. Smell is pretty basic, malts and slight hops. The taste however threw me a big curve ball. My first three sips tasted straght up like vodka, and it's not as if I'm not accustomed to drinking 10%+ brews. Thankfully the harsh flavor faded. Other than that, a basic, malty, strong lager with poorly masked alcohol. Mouthfeel was pretty average for the style, well cabonated and slightly slick. But personaly, I can't say this was much better than average."
"Crystal clear dark copper color with a giant head that forms a nice looking dome atop the beer. Light malt in the nose and taste. This beer is relatively bland, but definitely hides the 7% abv well. Some sweet malty flavors, a touch of grass and adjunct. I like the mouthfeel, carbonated enough but not overpowering. An above average euro lager that I could easily session."
"Light copper/ orange in colour with a fair bit of carbonation. Aromas are of ripe soft fruit, caramel, menthol, and a bit of alcohol. Medium bodied lager type of mouthfeel with this one. Strong malt presence with at least some herbal hop contribution. I was expecting bad things from this beer, but its not too bad at all (although not really my style). It would probably go over well with the malt liquor crowd."
" The bottle I had just said Warka Beer and had an ABV of 7% so I would assume this was the ""strong"" one. Good stuff, Poland has some tasty beers!"
"Warka Strong delivers a clear amber body beneath a frothy head of ivory foam that holds quite well and leaves some transient splotches of leace with each sip. The nose reveals only some sweetish, caramel malt. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with a medium-full body and soft carbonation. The flavor is surprisingly rich, caramelish, and nutty with a very thin thread of hop flavor and a low-key bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable, but at the same time, it almost adds to the character of the beer and helps to balance its malty sweetness. It finishes with a slowly receeding wave of toffee-like sweetnes that's dried a bit by a wash of alcohol before it fades and more nuttiness appears. Wow! I really liked this beer! But it's not a quaffer by any means. It would work well, I think, with a Thanksgiving dinner; and could certainly hold its ground as an apertif or after-dinner drink; and it might even pair well with a dessert such as a pecan or cherry pie. Very nice!!!"
