"OVERALL: Good drinkable, short finish of cognac and a little weak."
"O: Average beer. I don’t have much to say since it didn’t blow me away or disgust me."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Worth trying."
"From a 330ml brown bottle. Bought at the SAQ. Nice copper colour with a beige thin head. Nose with a nice mocha nose, with some nuts. Good taste of malt, some alcohol, nice equilibrium. I drank this beer 10 years ago and it was disapointing now it's a very good beer."
"The beer pours a deep, dark reddish brown, with a few fingers of puffy, off white head, that melts away, leaving no lacing. It smells of sour grape essence, and mildly sweet malt. It tastes of sweet wood flavours, citrus, grape must, and caramel malt. The carbonation is quite mild, and the alcohol not really noticeable, just a slight warming. This finishes smooth, with the brandy edge holding on for a little while. A pretty interesting and natural pairing of French beverages, that, while being a blend instead of an aged in wood product, produces similar impressions as those offerings from Innis & Gunn and BrewDog."
"I love both cognac and beer and beleive blending them or perhalps aging beer in cognac barrels is a good idea. I don't feel the base beer used here is the best one for this combination."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the French style ""bière de garde""."
"This beer gets an unfairly bad rap. First off, it's a weirdie right off the bat, as it's an orange/amber beer blended with actual Cognac. If you don't like Cognac (or any Brandy), don't try it! You won't like it. It's Cognac beer. For those that are interested, read on... it pours nicely, its head isn't remarkable, but not unacceptable. Very pronounced cognac nose. I must have had a fresh bottle - the beer tasted fresh, and the balance was better than most reviews had me believing. Cognac taste is very present, of course, but it's still a beer. Smooth and drinkable, pleasant. Alcohol was not overly pronounced. Excellent alternative to a port or cognac after dinner, or with a cigar or dessert. I find it's similar in spirit to Innis & Gunn. I'd recommend it for those who like ports and cognacs."
"The astringency of this beer makes a little bit of a sipper, but I would definetly not mind having this beer again."
"I tried this beer on August 17, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe' in Toronto. The beer poured into a tulip glass a beautiful reddish brown colour with almost no head. The aroma was cognac, malt, alcohol and burnt butterscotch. The mouthfeel was very very smooth with a medium body and some mild carbonation. The taste was very heavy on the cognac, and a little hint of fruit. I did feel the alcohol burn, and for a beer with an 8% abv, that's not good in my book. A little pricey at $14.25/bottle as well when I can visit some other places and get an Abbey Quadrupel for less."
"Truth be told, this biere-du-garde-type base beer, while not a perfect match, does little to hinder the cognac, except with regards to regulating its alcoholic intensity and remodeling it for slightly larger, more casually quaffed sips - both of which are positive amendments for my purposes. Still, however, the beer by and large retains much of the balance and delicacy, the sublime serenity, that characterizes even the youngest of France's cognacs."
"D: Interesting, but not highly drinkable."
"OK but not great, not enough beer flavor and too much alcohol flavor."
"Not horrible, not amazing, not likely to get this one again any time soon."
"Drinkability/notes: Well-balanced example, quite well done."
"I like this one. It isn't an amazing beer, but it is quite unique (from my tasting experience) and pleasant to drink. I could see it being a nice desert beer for a winter meal."
"The idea for this beer was interestingbut Id say an experiment gone wrong."
"Overall Impression: The alcohol is a bit hot for me, but cognac isnt a favorite of mine. If you enjoy it; this is a beer worth trying."
"As someone else mentioned, this makes a good desert or Christmas beer."
"Bottle: decants a brilliant clear garnet with amber hilights...not much of a cap even from a hard pour. Aroma is perfumey, some grape with some sweet treacle tones. Starts sweet with some molasses tastes then you catch the dry grapes and the alcohol takes over the palate for the rest of the ride to the finish. The finish is alcohol pronounced and warming...this is more like a cocktail or mixed drink than a beer....not to my liking...wont revisit. Rye and coke is more palatable"
"Drinkability & Notes: I dont think I have every used the term Drain Pour before  this is without a doubt a drain pour. Not even sure I would cook with this."
"Drinkability: The perfume almost put me under, but interesting."
"That said, while I enjoyed this beer, I think you need to use it it the right place. Definitely not something you want to knock back a lot of in short order. You wouldn't swill a cognac, so I'd suggest treating this beer the same way. Sip at it and enjoy it slowly after dinner."
"The taste even though initially strong of raspberries was very abrupt and left me wondering ""what happened?"" Cognac was to quick to respond."
"Weird beer! - but then, mixing cognac in beer IS a weird idea! The result: Aroma and flavour neither of beer nor cognac - but of RASPBERRIES!! and boysenberries. Rather sweet, but not as sweet as the aroma makes you fear. Not really godawful, but definitely not a beer I'll buy again. Beer is beer, and cognac is cognac - and never shall the two meet (again)!"
"This was very enjoyable for a sweeter beer and would be perfect as a dessert beer. Get into it!"
"i wouldnt drink this on a regular basis, but its a lovely beer that i could polish off next to a big slice of coffee torte."
"simply superb."
"Because it is so sweet you may not want to have too many."
