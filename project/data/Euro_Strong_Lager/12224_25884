2.15,-20.7,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,"Half liter bottle pours out nearly clear copper –gold with thin off white head. The aroma offers up sickly sweet sugary malts, a sweet mead like quality and a cheap maple syrup covered apple and pear slices like sensation. The taste isn’t as sweet like I was expecting. I get a sugary sweetness, a pleasing and trying to be dry yeastiness that cuts the sweetness with a slightly nutty like maltiness, and a strong alcoholic finish, which brings my overall rating of this brew down.","stoutman","Dec 08, 2011"
2.43,-10.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours a dark corn color with moderate carbonation and head that thins to a lace. Smells like a standard Euro lager that is slightly sweet and somewhat fruity. Tastes pretty much the same as it's smell except the alcohol is definitely more prominent. Goes down pretty smooth, but somewhat bitter. I don't really recommend this beer. For 9.5% it's pretty bland and the aftertaste is the same as a Bud.","DrainBamage","Oct 27, 2011"

3.23,19.2,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Out of a bomber bottle all the way from Lithuania this beer (which I sampled at The Russian House in Washington D.C.) was a dark golden/nearly copper color with an off-white head (lighting?). The retention was so-so; the lacing scattered. The aroma was punchy, lots of booze and dry grains. It was also served to me in a pint glass which did little for the aroma. The flavors were very much like a spiked Lager beer; imagine a Corona spiked with vodka. I tasted dry grains, alcohol heat and little else beyond hints of wood. But otherwise it tasted just as it smelled. It wasn’t unpleasant, and certainly if one wanted to get F’ed up it would be efficient AND superior to most American malt liquors which sport similar percentages. However, I wouldn’t quickly recommend it, especially to beer-lovers who tend to be snobs (what happened to you people?)! But, doubtless, one can give it props for rarity! The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation light.","thekevlarkid","Apr 22, 2011"
3.02,11.4,2.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a somewhat hazy golden orange color, small white head forms. Smell is clean, mildly sweet, and alittle lager-like. In the taste, lemony twang of spent hops, sweet grains mimicking dirty, raw honey. Theee is an odd somewhat sour twang of hops, and super sweet malt. These factors hide the alcohol well, which is a much needed success. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat crisp. Overall, an interesting brew, Lithuanian Premium Malt Liquor? Hows that for a new beer style.","Stinkypuss","Apr 06, 2011"
2.1,-22.5,3,3,1.5,2,2,"Mouthfeel is flat, thick and sticky. Overall, I think I'm not finishing this beer.","snaotheus","Feb 02, 2011"
3.89,43.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall - again, I don't love the taste, but maybe just because it's different, but because it's different is why I like it as a beer.","Nerudamann","Jan 23, 2011"
3.12,15.1,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"D: Decent allthough not what I expected from the labelExtra Stout...And at 9 % could not do many of these. but the taste is not a bad one if I wanted to get pissed drunk could drink about 4 and would be very much on my way.","nukem5","Oct 29, 2010"
2.83,4.4,3.5,3,3,3,2,"D: The lager has an alcoholic flavor, like mouthwash without the peppermint. On the upside, it's cheap and provides a near-instant buzz.","akorsak","Oct 17, 2010"
1.81,-33.2,3,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"Taste: I bought it because it was a Lithuanian beer, thought it would be interesting to try. It is unbalanced and seems too sweet for a beer. Not what I was expecting. It is kind of boring and not complex. Not very good and probably won't try again.","Schneic8","Jun 30, 2009"
2.13,-21.4,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,"The only quality of this beer that makes it worth trying once is that it captures the spirit of post-Soviet Eastern Europe of the 1990's quite well: rogue, rough, anything-goes, highly alcoholic with the smell of industrial decay (burning factory nearby?).","Cannoneer","May 15, 2009"
1.76,-35.1,3,2,1.5,2,1.5,"Umm, why does the label say this beer is "Extra Stout?" My guess is because people will think it is a stout... until a stream of clear yellow-gold comes flowing out. Average white head, some lacing. Non-descript chunks in the bottom. Hard-candy sugary nose with some banana, kind of medicinal. The taste is, well, bad. Sweet, to a sickening level. Hay/straw flavors, if they were dipped in sugar. Here is where the nasty, over-sweet grape candy flavor punches you. Its identical to the taste of a super-cheap purple jellybean. I hope this isn't the best Lithuania has to offer.","magictrokini","Apr 04, 2009"
1.56,-42.4,3,2,1,3,1,"Pours a murky gold with huge chunks of off-putting sediment floating around. The head wisps away quickly. No lacing is left behind. Smells of honey and malts. Tastes malty and some alcohol in the background. The alcohol becomes hot and pervasive after a few drinks. It's cloying and a bit thin and weak. Can't do this one.","stephens101","Jan 23, 2009"

1.73,-36.2,3,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,"Bottle pours a clear, golden orange body with a small, large bubbled head that quickly vanishes. Scattered wisps of lace are left behind. Aroma is golden delicious apples and booze. Light medium body is well carbonated but has a sickly sweetness. Taste has fruity apple notes, lots of alcohol, and a very bready maltiness. No hop presence. Syrupy sweetness grows sickly after a couple of sips. Most of this one goes down the drain.","merlin48","Beers"

1.86,-31.4,3,2,1.5,2,2,"It tastes like cheap candy. And not good cheap candy that will lull you into a state of nostalgia. This is "I'm not going to that house next year on Halloween" cheap candy. After a glass what was left in the bottle went down the drain.","Morbo","Aug 12, 2008"
2.16,-20.3,1.5,3,2,1.5,2,"Lithuanian Ghetto Liquor very sweet with an alcohol kick. Sweet candy corn aroma. Nice pour strong carbonation real cool to watch. Sticky sugary mouthfeel. Candy flavor common among the beers I've had from this country, but there is nothing to back the sweet taste. Very one dimensional and definitely a slammer.","kinger","May 02, 2008"
2.14,-21,3.5,2,2,2.5,2,"D: I tried this one just for the experience of trying a Lithuanian beer. It seems to exist solely for the purpose of getting the drinker completely wasted, not for the enjoyment of drinking. It's not a nice beer to drink.","avalon07","Sep 02, 2007"
2.55,-5.9,3,3,2.5,3.5,1.5,"Don't really know what to say. It looks sort of like pee, smells like alcohol and sweetness and grain, and tastes the same. Feel is okay.

3.52,29.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This is my first "Euro-lager," and while it doesn't exactly stand out as an amazing drink, it certainly isn't as bad as some people have rated it. Definitely worth a try if you want a unique flavor.","Thanby","May 22, 2007"
3.25,19.9,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"The Zaibo is an acquired taste for sure. It doesn't really match up with most American craft beers, or old world Euro brews either. It's kind of in its own little niche, as far as beers go. The brewers of Zaibo haven't really mastered the art of malt/hop balance yet, as this could definitely use a heavy dose of the latter. But I'm not so sure they haven't done exactly what they set out to do either, which is create a mildly drinkable strong beer. All that said, it's not that bad, and I'd be more than willing to experiment with the Rinkuskiu brewery again in the future. The Zaibo is worth trying if you're looking for something different.","Atlas1","May 12, 2007"

3.29,21.4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinks slow, waming/alcohol heat shines through once this sucker warms up, shows every bit of the 9% alcohol. Worse euro strong lagers out there, but this this would be plan c or d. Better than your basic malt liqour options","russpowell","Mar 03, 2007"
2.21,-18.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,2,"The brewery's website says that Zaibo 'is often used as a synonym for a strong beer'. That little fact is the most interesting thing about this lager. I can't imagine that anyone (outside of Eastern Europe) loves beer of this style. On the off chance that there are a few, I can think of a handful that are vastly superior to Zaibo. Not recommended under any circumstances.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 28, 2007"
2.73,0.7,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, golden orange color with a thin foamy head. The smell is not very apparent but is of grainy malt and spicy phenol. The taste has a grainy sweetness as well with a spiced alcohol finish. Not much of a hop presence. About what I expected from a lager that offers 9.5%. The mouthfeel is light and has little carbonation. This beer's drinkability is damaged by the unbalanced sweetness.","gmfessen","Dec 20, 2006"
3.32,22.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"I found this to be a mediocre beer. The taste did a fairly good job of masking the high abv, but I found it to be much more drinkable when very cold.","86sportster883","Dec 16, 2006"
3.21,18.5,3,2,3.5,3.5,4,"If a domestic that had these same characteristics came in 40 oz size at a gas station for 2 bucks & was called "raging rhino" or something I'd feel like I struck gold. In the malt liquor category this'd kill all competition. As it is though, it's good but not worthy of the price I paid.","longbongsilver","Dec 05, 2006"
3.15,16.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"For a European malt liquor this brew drinks alright and cerainly carries a kick. Not exactly a laying down beer unless you mean that is what you will do after a few.","brewQ","Oct 21, 2006"

3.14,15.9,2,3,3,3,4,"Pours a three finger white head that vanishes to a ring leaving no lace. Barely cloudy pale amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose.

2.46,-9.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Hmmm... Lithuanian malt liquor? Pours out to a syrupy golden orange color wiht nearly no head of foam. Aroma of alcohol and sweet grains mixed with corn. Taste is not enjoyable; strong notes of booze, a touch of malty and a astringent like flavor attacks the taste buds. Mouthfeel was uneventful. Drinkability is poor.

3,10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer renounces the 500ml brown bottle a clear deep gold with the head semi-creamy and bright white in color, the size average, as it fades, the lace forms a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is the prototypical lager malt, somewhat sweet with the start slightly sweet and the grain profile adequate for the style, top is relatively thin. Finish is customary in its acidity, the hops archetypal, aftertaste normal and dry, the high alcohol tends to warm the tummy a bit, so all I can say is that its average for the style.","Gusler","Sep 17, 2005"

3.63,33.9,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Clear gold body, head is small, with only small islands of bubbles on top of the beer. Smell is strong graininess, lots of grassiness, alcohol, and skunk. Smells like malt liquor. Taste is strong in alcohol, there is no hiding that. Does not have the same syrupiness as many other strong euros do, though. Also the skunk is not very present. Doesnt make the same mistakes as many other strong pale euro lagers do. Good, well carbonated mouthfeel and a predictable mouthfeel.","TastyTaste","0"
