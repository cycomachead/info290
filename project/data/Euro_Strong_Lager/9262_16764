3.03,-9.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Managed to get a single of this at my local, recommended by the cashier who's opinion I trust. I like the embossed green bottle it comes in, no paper label on it whatsoever. Large frothy white head on the initial pour, with a fairly impressive head retention. Deep golden in colour with an amber tint to it, good carbonation seen through a clear body. Crisp grainy malt, almost bready, with herbal hops to round out the aroma. Sweet bready malt up front for the flavour, becoming more grainy in the middle, and finishing with a bitter, somewhat astringent hop character. A full mouthfeel for a lager, rolls over the palate and tongue, but has a bit of a caustic texture to it, making it more of a sipping beer than one to tip back and chug. More impressive than what I had been expecting, but still average all things considered.","IronDjinn","Beers"
