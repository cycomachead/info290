Sometimes American brewers can do magical things with Belgian styles and other fall short, this one to me falls on the short side. Its not a bad beer but certainly not one I would go after again, when there are so many amazing offerings out there these days.","humuloner22","Mar 07, 2015"

I like this but it is dangerously close to being too sweet for my taste. It reminds of the time I fried pears in WAY too much honey. That was sticky sweet and this beer is almost there. Huge honey notes  with light pear and flowery heat blanketing everything. There is a lingering clove flavor that helps cut the sweetness somewhat. Great name on packaging for a pretty good beer.","DIM","Nov 13, 2014"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"American made Belgian beers are usually hit or miss for me, but this is definitely a hit and I would expect nothing less from NEBCO at this point. First, this pours a hazy orange/yellow color with a two finger white head. The aroma is sweet with some citrus and the funky belgian yeast clearly apparent. The taste definitely has that distinctive belgian yeast flavor, but its not overdone at all, which I feel is the problem with American Belgians (too much spice/clove/etc). This beer definitely got a good addition of hops with juicy grapefruit coming through, but it stops just short of any bitterness and instead mellows out into a smooth, almost creamy feel.. Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer and its a good thing I didn't try to guess. Its a one of a kind beer, and its definitely worth buying again. (90/100)","CTbrew32","Apr 15, 2014"

The color is golden with a great foam. It's refreshing yet still has ample body to be drank alone. The hints of citrus on the end balance well with the wheaty taste in the beginning. We paired it with light Italian and were very happy with how well the beer paired. The price point on a four pack is pretty fair and the availability in stores inside CT is very nice. Everyone we turn on to this beer keeps coming back for more. While some beers tend to give either a love or hate reaction, this one is almost guaranteed to appease almost anyone's palate. On a side note, absolutely love the name and the artwork on the side of the can.","WhiteHillsStore","Nov 26, 2013"

The beer gave off a moderate aroma...malty with a hint of citrus. The taste, defiantly Belgian, but it also had this slight cherry taste to it, which I thought was very interesting. The beer had a heavier feel to it, but it was smooth, creamy and pretty easy to drink...although I would probably not drink too many in one sitting.

It definitely establishes that it's a BSPA in the nose. The taste works in a complex melange of yeast fruits, honey sweetness, and grains followed by a slightly bitter, semi-dry white grape aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very approachable and drinkable for being a 9% beast and leaves a lot of traditional elements present (compared to a Duvel for instance). I'm excited for such a delicious canned beer available in WNY/CNY and recommend a brief warming period followed by some smooth jazz and reasonably paced sippage.","ThePorterSorter","0"

The appearance score would be lower if not for the fact that I didn't have this problem with some of my other 668 cans. The nose is a nice blend of pear heavy fruits and pepper and clove phenols. The two are pretty evenly balanced, though overall the aroma could stand to be a little bit more attention grabbing. The flavor profile is top notch. Some green apples creep in to join the the pears at the open, and the spicy phenols still have plenty of zip. There's also a pleasant warming sensation from a slight alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is good, but stops just a step short of being great. It's unquestionably got a dry body and bubbly level of carbonation, each could stand to be taken even a little bit farther. I really like Neighbor of the Beast, it's one of the American brewed Belgians I've liked the most in recent memory.","axeman9182","Jan 18, 2012"

Head dissipates into a band around the shoulders and a bull's eye dollop in the center. Delicate slashes of lacing revealed during the tasting exhibit excellent retention. Clusters of tiny bubbles adhere to the base of the glass. Nose expresses coriander, clove, Belgian yeast and a faint medicinal character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also some candi sugar present in the flavor profile that nicely softens the medicincal phenols. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation, some citrus astringency and a semi-dry finish. This is one tasty BSPA. Great balance and a remarkable tribute to the style.

The beer was a cloudy golden yellow with a one finger dense, white head loaded with a great combination of banana, vanilla, and spice. It starts with a very mild bite of hops and finishes very smooth and sweet. This year's batch was probably running at a very sneaky 9.5% ABV with no alcohol burn whatsoever.

4.27,7.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Massive thanks to Pabs311 for sending this one my way as an extra! Served from can into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quite quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and subtle hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, spices, and subtle hops. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. I had actually been waiting to get my hands on this one for quite some time. Definitely glad I got to try it. It had an excellent aroma and flavor going on with this one. The flavor was very well balanced with the sweetness from the malt and fruit aspect and was then rounded out with the spices and hops to balance it out. Quite an excellent combination. This is totally worth seeking out to try it without doubt!","thagr81us","Dec 02, 2010"
4.23,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This can is awesome. The design is sweet and hilarious. I think it is awesome they put a Belgian strong in a 16oz can. I poured about 7-8 oz's into my duvel tulip for the review. I wanted to keep the rest and drink it straight out of the can. Anyways, this golden, slightly hazy straw yellow with very rocky white head. The aroma is distinctly Belgian yeast with some citrus and alcohol. The taste is strong, and very good. It hints at a farmhouse-like funkiness but mainly from the yeast. Kinda spicy, peppery. This is a great beer. The alcohol is strong which makes the mouthfeel very dry. I loved the novelty of drinking a great Belgian strong ale directly out of a sweet can. Cool.","OakedCanuck","Nov 22, 2010"
4.18,5.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Not the best begian pale ale I've had, but still a great interpretation of the style. Aside from the 9% abv, this beer goes down very easy. Smooth and creamy, and packed with flavor. Another solid offering from NEBC.","JMD","Nov 20, 2010"

4.17,5.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The Crack & Glug - works every time, although here it was close to an overflow. Gotta work on ramping back just a tad on the pour of some of these beers. Two rocky fingers' worth of thick, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving behind a lot of sticky lacing. Nose was peppery, black peppery with a slight funk, not unlike a farmhouse saison. Hmm. Color was a slightly cloudy golden-yellow. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a slight viscosity to it on the tongue. I could feel an initial heat that gave 'way to a pleasant spicy sweetness. I was reminded of the interplay in MexiCAN hot chocolate between the sweet and the heat. This was more black pepper and sugary sweetness, but it may give you an idea of the mix of tastes. Finish was very dry, thanks to the yeast-driven spiciness. Wow! I felt like I had been kicked by a goat. Say, is somebody experimenting with sulfur in my basement? What is happening? My cooler just melted into a puddle of plastic slag! I need to move on.","woodychandler","Nov 05, 2010"

On the palate, I get a hint of sourness, along with more Belgian yeast, lemons and no alcohol whatsoever (until the end, when you realize how potent this one is). Very good.","emmasdad","Sep 17, 2010"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. 668 appears a hazey golden color with a finger of creamy white head. Spotty lace clings to the glassware. The aroma of this brew is typical belgian characteristics of yeast, clove and some alcohol sting in the back of the nose. The taste is a bit yeasty and sugary with a candy-like sweetness that clings to the mouth. There is an abundant amount of alcohol warmth through the back and a bit of almost bubblegum flavor mingled within. Medium bodied brew that is moderately carbonated. Drinkable and well balanced overall but nothing I would be upset about if I never tried again.","stakem","Sep 14, 2010"

3.65,-7.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I love how closely this guy resembles Carl Brutananadilewski, though without the effect of decades of disappointment crashing down on his shoulders. The beer pours a hazy amber straw topped by a steadfast finger of white suds. The nose comprises banana, clove, Belgian-yeast spiciness, orange zest, cinnamon, and coriander. The taste is heavy on the citrus aspects, pumping that coriander and orange peel to an overt level. The cloves are joined by some peppercorns, and behind all of this citrus and spice looms a mass of honey and light caramel. The body is a solid medium, with a light medium carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a solid brew, a bit hard to drink heavily, but a decent Belgian-style sipper.","TMoney2591","Aug 11, 2010"

4.05,2.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to Ohoove for hoofing down to NEB for this nice growler full. It's a nice amber color with a modest off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma brings mild clove-malt and allspice wheat, and just a kiss of the proverbial banana, nice. The flavor offers notable citrus hops blended nicely with subtle clove and solid sweet malt. Kind of tart and sweet, citrusy and mellon, mildly spicey with some alcohol but not too prominent. I pick up some banana-orange flavor and tea. Medium to full bodied, fully carbonated but very fine and smooth in feel. Reasonably drinkable for the high ABV. A very beautiful brew. Nice work NEB. I'm generally not much of a fan of hardcore Belgian styles but this seems to ""Americanize"" the idea a bit and makes this something that just might excite the masses as well as the discriminating hardcore.
