This one is really unique, the banana and citrus peel notes give it that classic Belgian taste. The dry finish from the pale ale style really gave this a refreshing finish that left me wanting more. Moreover, the star of this beer was the yeast; it flawlessly combined both of these great styles into one wonderful and unique beer. A must try for anyone that is a fan of the style.","santomark","Oct 08, 2014"

4.04,-1.9,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"Opened cold into a chilled Pilsner glass. Appearance is a cloudy golden haze... Great looking beer. Little to no head/lacing. Nose consists of chocolate, tobacco, lemon zest, with a healthy dose of "wet dog" funk up front. Mouthfeel is exceptionally dry, ropy and sticky with mild carbonation crispness. Taste is astringency balanced with malty sweetness and hints of vanilla, citrus fruit, tobacco and oak. A very nice emulation of a true Belgian, with RR's trademark funk in the mix.","Antnego","Jul 29, 2014"

Banana, apple, clove, pear and a hint of alcohol. Very well rounded and medium bodied. Great example of a strong golden ale done well in America.","WheelsPSU","May 08, 2014"

The typical Belgian yeast flavor is there but does not overpower the beer. The taste is slightly more spicy and earthy in flavor, slightly floral and a bit boozy. The mouthfeel is heavier than expected, full-bodied with a slightly dry finish. Overall, this is a tasty beer that is slightly less Belgian than expected. Drinkable and warming; glad I got the chance to have it.","mattsdenney","Jan 02, 2014"

It's been a while since I've had Duvel, Delirium Tremens (lulz), etc. but as far as I can tell this one puts up some good competition and has its own unique characteristics that make it stand out. It's also nice that it's one of the cheaper RR offerings, and I really appreciate it when brewers use these awesome 375 ml corked bottles, so bonus points for that.","Erbayd","Nov 13, 2013"

Taste is wonderful. Lots of fruit, pear, apple, classic Belgian yeast taste, spice notes, and pepper. Mouthfeel was medium, nice creamy texture and the carbonation was decent.

4.03,-2.2,4,4,4,4.25,4,"You would think that with a name like damnation it would be roiling. Shouting from the depths or something with all kinds of strong flavors clamoring. It is the exact opposite of that. It's depth is in the grain and how that sweetens fully and naturally and without any sugary quality showing that the earth is deep and golden in it's nature. Drinks easily and it's only flaw is that there isn't more fruit sweetness in the finish. But, even that fits the concept of damnation as it leaves a bit of longing. Easy and refreshing. Nothing heavy about this one it has a silky texture and excellent balance. It sparkles with depth and complexity rather than with carbonation and has a softness on the palate that is tangible. All of the qualities are only lightly forward making this one a very demure drink.","utopiajane","Sep 06, 2013"

Maybe I should have aged this a little bit longer, or let it sit out a bit to let it warm and let some of the carbon dioxide off to taste some of the more subtle flavors. Nonetheless, it is another good Belgian-style from RRBC. Worth obtaining a bottle and cellaring it for a bit.","beepill","Aug 23, 2013"

The aroma is very spicy, and has an alcoholic fruity smell, like a cider, and a very slight but pleasant hop aroma that comes through right at the end. Really amazing aroma on this beer. I would say it's the high point of this brew but honestly it's great all around. Moving on to taste. The spice comes across on the palate quite strong at first but gives way to earthy malty notes almost reminiscent of straw. A very pleasant, fruity aftertaste ends the experience. This beer has a really nice, crisp, and dry mouthfeel. Overall this is a really tasty double pale ale. Lots of interesting stuff going on in this beer. By all means worth giving a try if you stumble upon it and this seems to be the easiest Russian River brew to track down.","CA_brewster","Jul 22, 2013"

Honestly, I haven't found a better deal, and when I need a quick fix on the style I go for this one. The alcohol burning sensation removes a bit of the mellowness that I enjoy in these beers, but luckily the flavor is very tasty and juicy as they should be.

4.03,-2.2,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured a pale gold with good looking head on top an of aroma that has typical light Belgian charateristics such as touches of funk, some spices and yeast as well as touches of tropical fruit or at least apples and pears and there is a candi-sugar type sweetness underneath it all. Light-bodied, easy to drink, goes down realy easy and enjoyable and finishes with crisp hop bite that isn't cutting or bitter but a good balance of hops and sweetness so you keep wanting more. Overall, the beer is well-balanced and while drinking it I was not only getting some hoppiness but fruit notes from orangey, citric (banana), to spicy clove as well as some sweet fruits and a little bit of sweet malt. Great beer and did not realize how high in alcohol because it does not bleed into the beer at all and this is a must for any beer "snob".","clayrock81","Apr 06, 2013"
4.1,-0.5,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall: Anyway, I enjoyed this offering quite a bit more than the Redemption, which I had later that night.

In the aroma, one detects an almost grape-like wine aroma. In the mold of wine, it projected notes of a dry wine. In the initial taste, one detects notes of grape, grape skin, wheat, dry biscuit, yeast, and banana. The ale was smooth, yet pleasantly bubbly. When the fruits of the initial tastes evaporate, a dry aftertaste becomes apparent. In my overall impression, this is a complex beer with several tastes occurring at once. Though this is not the most respected Russian River, it holds up nicely against other beers.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 24, 2013"

4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"Russian River ales are always fun and special because they are bottled and presented well initially. The ale itself poured with a thin fizzy head that dissappated in mere moments. The color was of an apple cider like tint, cloudy and yellow but almost reddish in a way. The aroma is of apple and cloves but the taste follows on the apple. The taste is more complex than just apple as three distinct stages were present. It felt as the first taste disappeared quickly, a new taste emerged at the swallow and the aftertaste linger softly for some time. I simply could not describe each taste and it seemed I wanted more. My only complaint would be the feel was quite carbonated and bubbly, almost thin. Overall this was an experience and a good one at that.","KYGunner","Nov 05, 2012"

Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pear, grape, apple, lemon, herbal, grass, honey, pepper, wheat, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, pepper, herbal, grass, honey, wheat, bread, light earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, herbal, pepper, wheat, grass, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Excellent flavor balance of spiciness/fruitiness, with nice complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong pale ale. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Oct 12, 2012"

The aroma is spicy with pepper, along with a large amount of fruity flavors. The taste is very good, it's a well composed Belgian ale. It's got the whole bananas, pepper, and yeast thing you'll expect, paired with crisp apple and pear, along with some raisins. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is fine. Overall, it's a good Belgian Strong ale.

There is virtually no carbonation in my glass. Aroma: Citrusy, astringent, grainy, spicy, with hints of banana as well. The taste is very nice - I'm picking up a fruity pear taste that's dominant, yet something I did not detect in the aroma. It's got yeasty/spicy elements to the taste as well with a clean, semi-dry finish. Medium bodied and decent coating of the palate going on. Although it warms on the way down the alcohol presence goes very much unnoticed. Overall, I am a bit disappointed, as this is Russian River we're talking about. Maybe I will try this again on the chance that the cork loosened and let some air in before purchase. This was very expensive though.","Neorebel","Apr 21, 2012"

It lacks the crisp, stony dryness of Duvel, but makes up for it with a delightful hint of fruity sweetness. It's an excellent beer and fans of Duvel should give it a try.

Mild malt, light fruit, light citrus and moderate Belgian spicing. Not that complex. Nice medium body and obviously well made, but I prefer a bit more malt and other flavors. Finish was dry and a bit astringent; this increased as the ale warmed. Pleasant, but not really in the league of other Belgian strong ale and the finish is lacking.","LiquidAmber","Mar 19, 2012"

The carbonation is really good, and the mouthfeel is full but goes down fairly smooth. Has a very slight smoky feel to it. Overall I feel like the taste and mouthfeel are pretty complex on this beer.

Color is a slightly hazy amber with loads of medium size bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, caramel, malt, hop. Flavor is much like nose, but amplified, vineous; great interplay between bitter, sweet, and carbonic tang. Body and carbonaton are just perfect. Very well balanced in all regrards.

The aroma is not overly strong but getting some peach, pear and a light banana along with just a touch of hops as it warms. The taste is somewhat simple but in a good way. You get the belgian yeast gum like flavor then some sweet fruits and some hop bitterness at the end. It has a light, dry finish that pretty much begs you to take another sip. The alc. is very hidden.

Has a half-inch of white head, no retention, and no lacing. This smells of belgian yeast, spices, and the ocean. For some reason, Belgian ales always remind me of the ocean. The taste is spicy up front and out back, leaves a tingling sensation in the throat. Mouthfeel is really good on this one, pretty effervescent.

In fact that balance to me is what makes this beer a success. Some beers of this style can get a bit sweet.

The nose comprises wheat, light lemon zest, light coriander, and a tough of Belgian yeast. The taste holds notes of wheat, lemon zest, orange rind, lime zest, and a very light touch of caramel. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a fairly solid BSPA, but a bit on the boring side.

If I was someone looking to start drinking Belgians, this is the best tasting around. I normally like bottle conditioned beers better but this was outstanding. It looked good from the start. It smelled great. Not too much funkiness and slight spice notes present. Really makes me want to drink instead of regret like some Belgians. The taste is amazing. Nice sweet tones with a touch of spice that is expected but not too strong. The good mouthfeel really helped this quench my thirst on a warm summer night. Amazing beer with the high abv. It is not present at all. It almost made me wonder if Russian River is accurate with their calculations.

3.94,-4.4,3,4,4,4,4,"D - An interesting take on the style. I was initially worried that this bottle might be undercarbonated, based on the strange lack of head, but as it turned out it was very well carbonated. I can't explain the lack of foam as this sort of beer is usually capped by a tenacious head of sticky suds, especially in bottle conditioned versions. Aside from the foam issues, everything else shapes up nicely. There is some of the obligatory fruity yeast character present, but the emphasis is really on the soft, bready malt and the intense, spicy hop profile. This is a bit of a departure from the most successful Belgain Strong Golden ales that I have had, which tend to emphasize bright fruit notes and yeasty spice along side the hops and malt. It works fairly well here, but I feel like it would be more enjoyable with a stronger yeast profile to fill things out.

4.4,6.8,4,4,5,4,4,"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - This is the most drinkable Belgian I've ever had. Usually with most others, I enjoy it up until the aftertaste. That's where the skunked, weak, rotten yeast taste comes in. But not with Damnation. The finish remains strong in the bread department. Sweet biscuits and fruity spices are a nice change from that uncomfortable Belgian finish I am used too. But maybe I've just been drinking the wrong Belgians. I have not enjoyed a Belgian Beer this much since St. Bernardus Tripel; which Damnation completely destroys. Medium bodied and extraordinarily enjoyable. I may have to ask MadVermin to send me another of these in the near future.","Jesse13713","Mar 20, 2011"
3.96,-3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is very diverse and well-done. Starts creamy and rich as mentioned earlier, almost like a milk-shake, then moves to a gritty, chalky middle and finally to a dry, bitter end. It's a nice cycle of feels that is the best part of the beer. Initial feel is good, but a bit too much combined with the sweetness at that juncture for me though. Drinkability is solid due to the variation in textures and flavors, although hindered by the start. Affordable, good beer from Russian River, and a great American brewed Belgian strong pale ale.","veinless","Mar 19, 2011"

4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty wimpy head, not much there, not even a fingers worth. The color on it is very nice though, it's orange and cloudy, looks like it's one step away from being a belgian wheat beer. It is a very unique appearance, in some ways the color has hints of white, very interesting. If it weren't for the head this would get a great rating, to it's credit though, the frothy-ness and bubbles have stayed at the top of the glass where they were poured, it's leaving a nice foam rim around the top of the glass, almost like huge lacing or something. I'll go ahead and give this a 4, just because I know it deserves it. The smell is very nice, it smells very crisp. You get that sour smell on the nose, but it is not offensive at all, in fact it smells like it compliments the beer very well. You don't get much other smells other than that on the nose, maybe in the distance you can pick up a little but of that beer smell. Wow, this beer is bursting with flavor. You get that Sour taste, but like I said it is not overpowering or offensive, then you get a nice sweetness at the end, not too much though. I'm definitely picking up hints of fruit in here as well, maybe mango, tangerine, or peach, it's hard to tell. There is also a nice spice or herb flavor, it's very hidden, but it balances out the fruity flavor well. Not too much hop or malt here, you maybe get a little bit of hop bite in the front end, but not much at all. Overall the taste is pretty good! Mouthfeel is good, not amazing but good. Drinkability is very high for it being 7.75% ABV, they hide the alcohol very well in this beer. Overall A very well done beer all around, nothing is wrong with it and there is a lot that is right with it. Are my socks blown off? No, but it's a solid beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 12, 2011"

A medium bodied brew; fruity with little hop character but the powerful yeast is balanced nicely by a little note of alcohol at the end. Great lacing all the way down which would have been a nice sight at the end if it weren't for the empty glass.

Flavor has the same funky, musty quality but the fruit notes aren't as prominent with the herbal, spicy notes standing out more and with hints of wood and sourness. Light, dry mouthfeel with plenty of soft carbonation and a lingering bitter, slightly sour finish. This is a particularly good Belgian style ale, very faithful to the style.

Aromatics provided a nice malt driven honey drizzled biscuit pale malt with hints of spice and dry yeast notes, tropical fruit with a spicy alcoholic tone as well. Finishes with herbal spiciness from both the hops and the yeast a bit of citrus as well. Flavor was actually not as complex as the smell, which I was surprised by. Expected a tropical fruit flavor also accompanied by pale malt breadiness with citric/herbal hops shining through, nice dry yeast finish with a touch of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel was perfect this is where must brewers screw up a Belgian style ale, this one hits it with a nice effervescent level of carbonation perfect for the style. Drinkability was effort lesst this is definitely textbook solid Belgian style ale everybody else take notes, because this is the training wheel level Belgian ale from Russian River once they start with wild yeasts and barrel aging things get even better.

The spice sticks through to the aftertaste, and there is a smooth, slightly sour finish to the brew. Pretty tasty throughout, but a creepingly strong flavor that makes this a tough one to follow-up immediately with.","GarthDanielson","0"

Pours a cloudy, bright yellow with an inch of lumpy foam an lots of carbonation. But the foam quickly dissipates and there is no lacing. Spicy and sweet nose with classic Belgian notes of banana. Medium bodied with spot on carbonation. Rich and full on the palate. There is an earthy quality to it that is unique. It's not a roasted malt taste. I enjoy it. Honey and banana on the palate. The finish is long and sweet but not syrupy or resiny. Very pleasant. Even though it doesn't exit the palate cleanly, it is quite drinkable.

Mildly sweet, there's a blend of sugar and honey. The mid-palate also has a floral character with some rose water. Medium light in body with high carbonation, this is really zippy on the palate, more than I like, and more than I remember it being. I wonder if the elevation here in Breckenridge is causing more carbonation to be liberated than would be expected at sea level. The finish is drying and spicy, which, while intense, is not too much.

I've had this beer fresh, but this one's got a bit of time on it. The flavors are very complex with such subtleties that make it an awesome Belgian style ale. Initially, you get the crisp floral notes followed by a peppery/spice bite. There's a fruity sweetness that is in every moment of the sip as well. The mouthfeel as crisp and clean (like a triple).

My prayers are answered, as in addition to the flavors present in the nose there's a distinct lemon-grass flavor that works well for the beer. It's still not quite a 5 in terms of flavor, but warrants a bump from the smell score. Vinnie and co. absolutely nailed the mouthfeel, flawless. I can't speak an ill word towards either the body or the carbonation. Damnation tastes good enough that I'd like to sip and savor it, but the otherworldly mouthfeel makes it hard to restrain myself and do so.

The flavors were equally enjoyable, a well-balanced blend of citrus hops, tangy yeast, toasted malt, pale malt, spices and a touch of grain. The alcohol was well folded into the brew and it had a nice arc of starting sweet and then heading towards bitter finishing on the yeast note.

Poured a translucent golden orange with a dense, two inch bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap, leaving behinds thick, clumpy strands of lacing as it recedes. Nose is fairly clean - citrus, a hint of candi sugar, a touch of anise and perhaps a slight earthy/herbal quality. Taste consistent with nose, but some light fruity esters come out in the mix as well - perhaps passion fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a palate cleansing background carbonation that culminates in a dry, fairly clean finish. Excellent brew - might be my favorite Belgian Strong Pale. Well-hidden abv, refreshing and all around easy drinking. I just wish RR was available on the East Coast.","Jwale73","Nov 08, 2009"

The aroma has some pear and green apple, some light lemon, cinnamon and spicy alcohol, and some leafy hops. Pretty sweet, honey-like malt flavors, with fruity accents and light citrus. Finishes a little peppery and bitter, but there is a lingering sweetness too. Medium bodied with fizzy bubbles, and a little stickiness in the end.

Taste is a fantastic balance of sweet fruit, pepper and light bitterness from the hops. Yeast was a little more up-front than I would like in a belgian pale, but overall the brew was quite good.

The off-white head lingers for a few seconds then dissipates, leaving a nice stripe of lace all around the snifter with a few skinny fingers jutting toward the rim. Belgian Strong Ales always have an appeasing aesthetic to me, and this one is no different. Aroma is yeasty and malty with a fruity, floral undercurrent. Some sweet candy exists as well. Tastes fruity and malty with a good hop kick toward the end. Some subtle sweet bread, spice and underneath it all some sour apples find their way out. An almost indiscernible phenolic essence is noted. Some notes of alcohol present themselves as the beer warms up. Mouth-feel lies on the heavy side of medium, and it's fairly highly carbonated, making for a smooth, easily drinkable beer. Nice one for sure, and although there are a few others I prefer over this one, I can't find any big faults with this Damnation.","stephens101","Jun 05, 2009"

Light bronze orange in color, not much hue change towards the rims, clear enough to se the pinpricks of bubbles rise upwards. Sort of a "beery" nose, yeasts and raw pie dough predominate, then there's orange blossom, clove stick, apricot pits and pear skins, comes across as remarkably openly knit and airy, very restrained sweetness. Medium-bodied, the foaminess in the mouth is gentle, however, takes up a considerable amount of space before finally settling down. The clove, cinnamon spices offset by notes of sharper white pepper. In turn, sweeter orange citrus met by more sour white grapefruit. Not a lot of esters, the apricot, pear, peach fruit succinct and dry. The yeasts too are dry and not overly leesy and creamy. Not "bitter" on the finish but has a certain astringency which might throw off some imbibers. Almost shy about its complexity.","farrago","May 30, 2009"

A moderate amount of lacing. A fairly high level of carbonation (which is apparently an issue with some RR brews). A nicely subtle spice and fruit aroma. The typical spicyness of this style is quick on the tongue, with a slight clove note on the finish. The body is light and refreshing as usual for the style. Nicely drinkable.

Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied, more so than other BSPA's, perhaps, with a very creamy feel to it. Maybe a little less carbonation than Duvel or Delirium Tremens.

4.2,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to dbatch and our CA friend for hooking up a shipment of limited release Russian River to the east coast. 750ml bottle marked Batch 36. Pours a creamy gold color with a big soapy head, even with a slow pour, recedes steadily to leave a nice surface film and lacing. The aroma up front is an almost wine-like sweet fruit bouquet, behind that there was citrus and hops. The taste was quite complex, I was curious why the site listed this as a Belgian pale ale but the RR label showed Belgian golden ale, there are definitely characteristics of each. The fruits and spices from a golden ale are there, and the more than expected hops pushed it more towards the pale ale spectrum (although I would agree with the brewers this is a "unique" golden ale). It is bottle fermented for a little extra carb, but I found the mouthfeel to be fairly smooth with just a little bite, nice warm alcohol/hops aftertaste. I could definitely throw back a few of these if they weren't so hard to get where I am...very solid offering from the guys at RR.","Iceman77","May 03, 2008"

4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cork-n-cage 750 ml bottle - batch 12. Brewed 6/1/06 with abbey ale yeast, and bottled on 6/27. Instead of conditioning with wine yeast like most batches of Damnation, they finished this one with the same abbey yeast. It pours a nice, solid gold hue and appears unfiltered, but it could just be some yeast particulates. The beer has adequate carbonation and is capped with three fingers of slowly-receding head that deposits lots of lacing. Sweet and toasted malts in the nose, sprinkled with flashes of orange, banana, and perhaps some pineapple. On the palate, it's the same toasted maltiness, along with grassy/spicy hops that impart a mild bitterness (25 IBUs). The beer has a slightly musty character, along with some yeast, a touch of clovey phenolics, apples and a late citric quality that imparts oranges and light lemon. Medium to full body, with tingly carbonation and a dry, lingering finish. This is a beer that is way too easy to drink and quite tasty, which is great for the palate, but at 9 bucks a bottle is a pain on the wallet. Although I haven't tried this beer fresh, I feel the aging has had a positive effect on this brew. Definitely a brew worth visiting and revisiting.","mmmbeer","0"

4.35,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Damnation. The name basically sums it all up. This beer has all of the Duvel and Leffe components, but in a much more aggresively malted, hopped, and fermented way. It's basically amped up Pale Belgian. The difference here is that the balance remains firm and unwaivering. A very tart Belgian berry-like vineous (chardonay) flavor is balanced with big perfumy hop additions and a soft nectar-like quality-- kinda like you'd expect to find in a Mead. Then throw in some peppery spices, basic pilsner maltiness, and fresh tropical fruits (pineapples, apricots, mangos) and folks, we have a super complex beer. Quite dry and warm in the finish with a lingering numbing effect. Not that it's better than those beers metioned before, but it's a good choice if you want more strength with a similar profile, but don't want to sacrifice unnecessay fusals or phenols.","BEERchitect","Jan 31, 2008"

Sweet honey glazed banana slices as well as some pear flesh leads into a light clove, candied orange peel, and pepper finish.

This is one beer I would gladly pass over others in order to get to for a return engagement. This is the reason I keep a clean, empty growler in my car.","Foxman","0"
3.67,-10.9,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Draught @ Hollingshead in Orange, California. Light dark straw, bordering on orange with a large, frothy and lasting head of foam. An aroma of papaya mostly, with other hints of banana and pear, along with some funky yeast notes and hints of salty pizza dough. Big, doughy, fruity malt flavor with hints of tart passion fruits and grassy and earthy hops. A pretty tasty beer.","Crosling","Mar 05, 2006"

A nice thick, white-colored head devleoped and left behind loads of lacing. Aromas of honey, yeast, grains, and dried fruit came out nicely. A bitter taste with fruity tones; dried apricot, pears, mellon, and white grapes. Rich and fruity with a sweet finish that is long and mellow. Highly addictive with a creamy texture that just rolls into your mouth and leaves behind intense flavors.

Medium-bodied and tart with fruit and peppery spices, along with some hops and malt. The finish is spicy and short with a lingering sweet aftertaste of banana and clove.

Spicy and slightly phenolic nose has a mild hay-like propensy, its dry yeastiness offering plenty of tea-like tannins and candied fruits (pineapple, sprucey orange skins etc.), like a less nutty chardonnay. Even for a belgian ale, it is pretty spicy, though balanced and youd have a hard time picking dominant tastes. Certainly herbal, honey geared malts, tannic and yeasty. Medium carbonation, medium bodied, slight astringency. Quality, friendly and accurate artisanal farmy belgian ale, if not managing the extra steps to scar our imaginary world.","Rastacouere","Oct 24, 2005"

I can taste a small hop presence. I can not detect the alcohol in the flavoe. I really like how this beer hides the alcohol. This beer is quite carbonated. The carbonation does not detract from the beer at all. This beer leaves a spicy, citrusy aftertaste. It goes down smooth.

Also some cantaloupe sweetness which is very tasty - a little bubble gummy as well. Very complex without being overbearing or particularly "strong" tasting, which I like.

So I poured the rest in a glass, yeast and all, and tried again. Now that it has "aged" a bit, and it includes the yeast, I get a solid banana-pineapple-clove nose, and the peppery-dry sharpness has mellowed a bit, but it still dominates.

Lots of lemony zest upfront, but also with an almost black peppery spice as well. With a very big inhale, I find the last 0.75 of the inhale to change character and give me light alcohol-innoculated banana. Very nice. The flavor is not as complex as the aroma. It starts with a crisp lemon, slightly spicey follows finishing with a light sweetness, but very dry. It really hits me on the back of the tongue with the dryness.

That funk is present in the flavor, almost has a musty funk going on - but in a very good way. Citrus and spice and some earthy hops.

Enjoyable blend of sweet fruits and mild spicy hops. More subtle hints of sour apple throughout along with some drying woodiness.

This beer poured a cloudy pale gold, head was pure white and retained well, lacing was good. Banana notes dominated the aroma and taste profiles, the usual yeasty characteristics were also present. This Belgian strong golden checks in at 7% I'm glad I tried it, upset I didn't like it. I would like nothing more to report one day that I had found one I do like. Suzanne liked it though! I almost fell off my stool. I'll bet most if not all lovers of Belgians will like it, seems well made.","Mark","Beers"
