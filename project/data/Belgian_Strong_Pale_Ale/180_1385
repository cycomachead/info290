I had heard a lot of hype about Delirium Tremens prior to procuring this bottle, and I'm quite happy to state that, for the most part, this beer has lived up to its impressive reputation. This is an excellent strong Belgian pale ale; one that can be expected to stand up and compare equally (or even favourably) to most of the other big names in this style. All fans of strong Belgian-style beers should consider this one to be a must-have - I'll definitely be keeping a couple of bottles in my cellar for later enjoyment.","thehyperduck","Mar 10, 2015"

Aromas of mostly bananas with notes of cloves and Belgian yeast. Aroma matches taste very well, adding some light citrus into mix. Long lasting aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very smooth and low in carbonation. Acidity lingers toward front of tongue for a short while. The higher alcohol is disguised well, making this sessionable, yet on the pricey side. Still worth it. Overall, a wonderful classic Belgian. One of the better ones I've had. Highly recommended.","sporklift87","Mar 01, 2015"

The smell of pine nuts and roasted almonds blended with erotic citrus tones gets me excited. Hmmmm.","TheBroadSword","Nov 07, 2014"

Spices, mainly cloves, dominate the taste of this beer, with yeast shining through in an enjoyable way. Medium-bodied beer, convincing due to is unusual present spices, even for this style of beer. Yeast provides depth and balance, without becoming too present on its own. Aftertaste is still very soft on the palate, while warm, sharp spices have already left the palate.

It pours bright gold, has a petite head that sticks around a little bit, and stable body (average carbonation). It has a natural taste of grasses, malts, hops, earth, and sweetness, with the yeast taste running major interference. It has an edge to it's tast becuase of the 8.5% ABV, it has malty aftertaste, and is a filling beer.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

The smell has so many citrusy and beautiful aromas that give such a strong draw to this beer. Delirium Tremens also a well-known international name that commands respect. But in comparison with other breweries of Belgium in the southern French speaking region of the same style, this beer maybe able to stand its ground, but is just simply not as tasty as its southern cousins. The taste is alright, good but not the best for Belgium Blonde lovers, and the mouth feel is nothing out of the ordinary. I would say the beer is still advanced for the Belgium Blonde drinker, and is also a must try, as despite the taste ratings, in comparison to all beer styles and Belguim Blondes from other countries, Delirium Tremens is a great beer. I just choose to compare the beer with others of the same style inside their country.","Fuldner","Dec 20, 2013"

3.86,-6.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Maybe the second best known Belgian strong pale after Duvel, fairly easy to track down and worth trying on tap as well as from the bottle. DTs pours a nice lemon drop yellow, pretty clear and sparking with a minimal amount of white head that nevetheless leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a compelling blend of dusty spicy yeast, sweet fruits, and an interesting funk or horse blanket note, almost like an old library full of musty tomes. Not brett per se but you are definitely sniffing something full of interesting esters. Palate is sweet, sour, and bitter all rolled together, a rich honey malt sweetness coupled with cardamom and coriander spice notes like a yellow curry, and some orange rind, apple and pear fruit to round out the corners a bit and provide added juicy complexity. Reasonably chewy and thicker than a tripel but still pretty crisp and refreshing with some hops cleansing the palate. The alcohol is amazingly well obfuscated. Its almost not there. I actually prefer this to Duvel, itself a classic. The additional spice is ... Nice.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 21, 2013"

It's so uninhibited, that I'd even go so far as to say that I've had 15% ABV brews that are smoother than this. It's cloying, distracting, and out of place. The mouthfeel is too syrupy and thick, and it allows the alcohol to cling to your taste buds and distract you from further sips.

The problem with the bottle though, is that it makes it impossible to see any sediment lying in wait, and the Delirium beers always seem to be chock-full of it, rushing into your glass with even the most gentle pour. Chunky floaties aside, Delirium Tremens embodies the Belgian Strong Golden Ale style; fragrant, tasty, and dangerously drinkable, ready to knock one on their ass if they're not careful.","BeerFMAndy","Sep 02, 2013"

It's available so widely, it's not a treat to find it, and if you're going to drink a beer this style, there are much better choices. Don't get me wrong, this is a great beer.

4.26,3.1,5,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 4/2014. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass; with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Aromas of big grape, apple, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with a moderate malt balance. Taste of big grape, apple, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, lemon zest, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters; with a good amount of malt balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale ale. Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with good malt balance; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

No matter how long I kept it in my mouth, the sting of the carbonation never really went away. The flavors which I was able to discern weren't too flattering.

Very sweet smell, possibly floral in there as well as a slight note of alcohol as the beer is 8.5 abv. This beer is sweet to the tounge as well on the first sip. Can't drink it too fast though as it is very thick and syrupy. No noticable or dercenable bitterness nor any hop notes. Excellent taste for the Belgian Golden ale lover.","Ryanm1","Feb 10, 2013"

Pale gold, hazy, and with a rapidly dissipating head, it smelled sweet and fruity; tart green apples, close to no banana and clove in the nose but it was detectable near the end as it warmed. Very strong tasting; best description would be too imagine what an ""imperial"" Belgian would taste like. Tart and dry, fruity and slightly spicy with a medium-thin mouthfeel and lots of carbonation, almost over carbonated actually. Only slightly less carbonated than an American pale lager, in my opinion. Coriander and spice notes more apparent as it warms. Very hot and warming, with an alcoholic buzz started minutes after the first several sips. the name is very appropritate. I'd drink this again!","Aaron_Ramson","Dec 20, 2012"

Smell a bit on the sour side like grapes and apples with ethanol and hops present as well. The flavor seemed to match the smell with a bit too much of the sourness coming through for my taste. Overall, this was a great Belgian strong pale ale, but with so much competition, I would put it lower than some others. I enjoyed it and I recommend it, but I might have to revisit it in order to give a better opinion.","shigg85","Jul 10, 2012"

The flavor is rather complex, initially spicy and peppery, then a moderate hop bitterness emerges, enhanced by a slightly tart and notably dry finishes. Beneath it all are noticeably fruity notes and finally a bit of hop emerges again long after the swallow. The body is moderate, boosted up by an appropriately high level of carbonation. Overall a tasty, all around well made beer, glad I tried it.","uwmgdman","Jul 07, 2012"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink but it will sneak up on you.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 03, 2012"

4.26,3.1,5,4,4.5,4,4,"A very dry taste and finish, only a hint of sweetness in the front that is reminiscent of white wine. Hints of lemon and orange zest come through lightly in the front side of the palate as well. Here is where it comes right to the brink of tart, but is dried out by the peppery notes and hops. It moves into a very inviting dryness with the help of these light peppery notes and a little bit of clove. The hops then come in with a lemon grassy quality that goes well with the carbonation and peppery notes. The second half of the bottle proves to have more yeasty notes, nothing overly funky but a definite added belgiany farmhouse character. The vinous qualities are very pleasant and work well with this beer. The bone dry taste is superb and complex, letting this beer shine. I definitely recommend for the fan of Belgians as this one is worth it.","chodinheaven","Jun 14, 2012"

It may be hard to get past what seems like gimmicky packaging, but the strong Belgian pale ale inside is well worth the effort. The rich golden colour is enticing, the thick white head inviting. And then you get a whiff of the spicy, fruity nose--that Belgian yeast working its magic--and, man, it's just amazingly complex and fragrant. Great carbonation makes the high level of sweetness tolerable and it has a fairly dry finish. Again, you get the complexity of the interplay of the malt, kandi sugar and yeast and all kinds of fruity flavours pop up--pear, pineapple, citrus peel.","CookstLiquor","Jun 07, 2012"

Being from Western Canada I don't see very much American craft, so much of my craft beer experience has been focused on Belgian beer, which we seem to get a lot of (Having Unibroue up here as well doesn't hurt!). An all around tasty and balanced Belgian, but a step below some others I've tried. It's also a touch too weighty and sticky to make for a great summer time brew. Overall, a fine Belgian offering that I will certainly be drinking more of down the road.","Converge","May 25, 2012"

Sweet biscuit with a significant pepper, spice, and a hint of apple that leads to a dry finish. Spicy sweetness lingers until the next sip. Pepper and spice grows with the warmth initially with the 8.5% alcohol remaining unapparent the entire time. Taste goes a little flat when it warms too long. Oddly, it helps the taste to warm a little, but there's a window of peak flavor for this beer. I've always liked this beer a lot and can see why it's a popular at multiple tap bars. It's a quality beer that's extremely approachable.","FightingEntropy","Apr 13, 2012"

Ripe fruits: green apple, banana, also some clove. The taste mimics the nose with the addition of a soft, tangy finish that ends up clean. Extremely drinkable - dangerously so. Overall, a must-try.","yamar68","Apr 10, 2012"

It has a cloudy, golden color with visible sediment and abundant carbonation visible that fuels the long-lasting head. It smells very sweet, a combination of floral hops and a number of fruits that I couldn’t easily decipher. When you first take a sip, it begins by being sweet. As soon as you pull the glass away the spiciness sets in and it is honestly very unique compared to everything else I’ve had. As it settles there are slight notes of bitterness and long lingering spiciness that leaves you wanting more. I could barely tell the alcohol content was so high while drinking. Very high carbonation, but it doesn’t take away. Medium mouthfeel that lingers with the taste. Overall a great and unique beer.","DarthNerdus","Mar 04, 2012"

The beer is a yellow golden color with a good 2.5 finger white billowing head. Good retention and lacing. The nose is an impressive blend of citrus (orange and lemon) with a gentle belgian clove and malty sweetness. No hint of alcohol whatsoever. The flavor is a crisp citrus fruit with bananas and clove from the yeast. The malty sweetness works well to balance the mild bitterness. Again, not hint of alcohol. Very good. Finishes crisp with a lingering fruit sweetness on the tongue. Well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. The price tag would be the only thing keeping me away, which won't be for long. Enjoyable.","hopfacebrew","Mar 03, 2012"

The taste mathced aroma well, sweet, fruity, but also had a bit of bite to it. Mouthfeel is smooth, lots of carbonation but not harsh, very airy. Great beer, I really enjoyed it. It has a great aroma and taste and is not heavy. Definitely a bottle you can put down alone and enjoy it.","stalker5","Jan 09, 2012"

Scent is pale straw, light watery fruits such as apple and pear, moderate spice from the yeasts, bready. Taste a tad bolder than scent dictates, spicier too... solid watery fruit notes and fresh bready yeasts. Medium bodied, bubbly and briskly at first, as carbonation escapes becomes smooth, dry finish. Overall, great representation of the style and easy drinking.","rfgetz","Jan 03, 2012"

The smell included spice, clove and some banana/citrus. The taste had a boost from the ABV, but their was definite spice/clove taste. Mouthfeel sucked since it was a dead beer and the higher ABV did not make this a session. Overall though the flavor and smell was good.","WoodBrew","Oct 13, 2011"

The taste was very strongly yeasty and that did not sit well with me. There were also clove and fruity hops present, but the yeastiness dominated. That immediately prevented me from enjoying this beer. I do not like yeasty beers, so I can't say anything good about this one. If you don't like a dominating yeasty flavour either, then don't even try this one. If you do, I guess you can give it a try. It was a bit sour, even. Very much not my thing.","ElCommodoro","Oct 09, 2011"

I can't stress this enough, this beer needs to be served at almost room temperature in order to really ""taste"" it.

Then you are hit again with that summer-citrus thing I was talking about earlier. There is, toward the back of the palate, a subtle change in flavor… but nothing that lasts, or is noticeable to really investigate. Past that, it’s a very drinkable beer that I could enjoy time and time again. (Maybe I just like lemons…)","rickyleepotts","Jun 27, 2011"

Brilliant yet cloudy gold color. Very inviting pale ale hops and wheat and sweet smell.

Lots of zesty spice with hints of pepper and coriander dominate the front end and linger over the earthy hop notes, pale malt and sweet boozy heat into a dry finish. The alcohol is much stronger in this beer than I remember. Really hot for it's ABV with warmth in the finish. This takes away from the pleasant light fruit notes and earthy, grassy notes. Underneath the spice and alcohol there are hints of apple, pear, banana and bubblegum. I used to really like this beer but now find it astringent and one dimensional.

Pored a straw yellow clear color with a bit less carbonation than I was expecting. Thin lace around the rim but no retention. Slightly tart grapes and peaches and a lovely yeasty aroma that is as well balanced in the nose as I can imagine of any Belgian pale. Slight straw and browned grass at the front followed by a stringent and slightly bitter aftertaste. crisp fruit and subdued slickness and mixed in well with a lovely tart finish.

The flavor is round, with a mouth full and warm alcoholic which leaves the aftertaste of bitterness with that presence always spicy where it collects a few grains of pepper. It also receives a key that gives a sweet finish more or less syrupy. Very good duivelbier, probably the best direct rival of Duvel from Moortgat.","ThaCreep","Feb 08, 2011"
3.85,-6.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Not sure what the packaging is all about - the faux ceramic is an interesting touch, though query what it does to flavor after prolonged periods. The glass is an oddity as well, with its elephants and whatnot, though I guess it's all part of the overall experience. Once you get past all the pomp, the ale pours a nice golden color with a thick head that holds well and laces even better. The first sip provides a bursting cocktail of fruit flavors with strong honey and mild pepper. Good creamy carbonation. The alcohol is hidden nicely in the sweet maltiness so be careful, it packs a wallop. A bit too sticky sweet for my taste, but fine for those who prefer that. Overall, a solid ale for its type.","CountJustinian","Feb 03, 2011"

When I first started drinking this beer, the color was a deep amber color. Now I'm noticing they are a much more pale yellow color, and the taste has changed also, but not for the better.

There are clumps of stuff swimming in the glass. A living beer. Smell is peppery with a honeyed malt and yeasty fruitiness. Apples and grapes are a feature. Taste is wonderful. More like a tripel than a BSPA. That being said it does fall a bit short of the tripel standard in its malt core. The honey/sugar notes are not as big. To move on to what is there I must confess a real love of the balance in the blend. Malt is sweet with honey and cupcake batter. Pepper with a coriander like spiciness. Some clove and banana but not hefe like. A subtle blend of the two. Apples and grapes from the nose are here. Finish is nicely hopped with herbal notes and a dry clean edge. Feel is medium with a creamy carbonation and supple fluidity. So drinkable so tasty so good you just go through the bottle in an instant.

A complex mix of fruit/malt flavors hit the palate, and joyfully dance from front to back to one of the smoothest finishes I've yet discovered.

Nose is dominated by the yeast, some coriander notes, a bit of floral hops, but not much fruity esters, perhaps a bit of lemon but not much. Taste mirrors nose, surprised how how un-fruity this was.

The flavor is more forward than the aroma, with ripe citrus fruits, spices, clove, and alcohol. I find the alcoholic aspect to be too prominent. I would prefer the potency of this brew to be disguised in a bouquet of hops and/or Belgian yeast. The feel is medium bodied, with a warming finish.

The taste is familiar as a sweet white wine would be, similar to a Riesling. The mouthfeel is light and crisp as would be appropriate with the delicate flavors that abound.

4,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"12oz bottle, courtesy of Amanti Vino's Beer of the Month club, poured into my Duvel tulip. The beer pours a somewhat dull goldenrod, closer to clear than cloudy, though not entirely translucent. A strong pour leads to a voluminous, creamy and frothy white cap. Head retention is above average, but lacing is subpar for a BSPA. The nose is mostly sweet, grassy and pale fruit (apples and pears) malts. There's just a hint of spice, which isn't quite enough in my book. Fortunately Delirium Tremens' flavor allows a bit more of the yeast influence to shine through, with some pepper and clove being the most appreciable. All the requisite parts are in place for a phenomenal Belgian Strong Pale Ale (at least as far as flavor goes), but for some reason the result is just a little bit short of that. One area where the brewery nailed it though is the mouthfeel, there's enough heft in the body without crossing the line into being too viscous and thick, and the carbonation is invigorating and exciting without seeming fizzy in any way. That, along with a solid (but not top notch) taste makes Tremes quite quaffable, especially with the alcohol not really shining through. Delirium Tremens is a more than passable Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but falls short of ""all time classic"" status","axeman9182","Sep 10, 2010"

Tasting honey, light use of hops, small bit of breadiness, and maybe almost a slight pear fruitiness followed imediately by a sour, dry, but somehow still wet and creamy finish.

The inviting aroma is malty and yeasty with a firm fruity undertone that is mainly citrus and has just a hint of banana. Flavor is a delight, malty and yeasty with strong fruity tones.

The yeasty scent plucks at the nose at the front of the aroma, this soon followed by a coriander fragrance, mixing with a bread aroma. It all ends with a citrus scent, mostly of orange. A slightly hoppy start to the taste at the beginning, that brings strong earthiness. That is trailed by yeasty esters bringing fruity flavors, mostly of pear. A hearty mouthfeel that is slightly chewy in the front. Then it gradually thins out as it reaches the back of the palate. It all finishes with a strong crispness, that would be associated with a lager. The strong Belgian characteristics that one wants from this beer, along with the extra kick of hops and the crisp finish make this a one of a kind beer.","cameraman","Aug 29, 2009"

The taste is similar, starts with a citrus yeast flavor, moves to the fruity and finishes with some alcohol tones, with the tones staying throughout the aftertaste. This has a nice crisp light mouthfeel, nice carbonation, and great flavor balance. This one is a pretty good session beer, but the ABV or aftertaste might get old soon.

Well rounded flavor, strong alcohol, and overall a nice beer to relax with or to enjoy on a special occasion. Just don't drink it too cold or at room temperature.

Oh well, it was sorta worth it. It had a huge, glowing-white head. the smell was piny, citrusy. The taste: out of this world. My buddies and I all tasted fruit. Big, big fruit like apples an melon.

Right away I could detect a strong similarity to La Fin Du Monde, another excellent strong Belgian style ale. There was little head and a transparent golden color with many fine bubbles rushing to the top of the glass. It smells sweet like brown sugar and/or honey. And the taste was very smooth, sweet, honey-laden, and maybe a little yeasty. It was delicious. Heavy and fizzy with a little alcohol bite and warmth yet quite drinkable considering the high ABV.

Smells strongly of sweet/earthy malts and citrus with a slight amount of hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Thick and chewy mouth feel with some associated sweetness and a little bitterness in the aftertaste. There's a high carbonation level present. The alcohol is noticeable, but not so concentrated as to put you off the beer. The citrus flavors are very strong throughout the brew. Malt flavors are strongest up front and slowly decline through the drinking. A little hop bitterness is there, but again not in too strong of a way. Overall, after a few sips this beer gets amazing as far as flavor goes. This is worth a try if you can get past some pretty huge yeast chunks suspended in the brew.","Tone","Jan 26, 2009"

There is also some warming from the high alcohol content, without any harsh alcohol flavor. As the beer warms the citrus and yeast comes more to the forefront and changes the dynamic. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and crisp, with a slight thickness and light carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the alcohol content, a great beer to get as a treat.

I've had it probably six or so times, and I always have a similar opinion. First, the beer is over-carbonated. It's not a bad looking beer, but the head generally doesn't always stick around when it's actually in the glass, as opposed to when it's crawling its way out of the top of the bottle. To a certain extent, the beer looks and tastes like orange soda. I do enjoy the flavor, but it's very one note, in my opinion. On top of that, comparisons to the Duvel are hard to avoid, and DT loses in that matchup. DT seems to lose a matchup against any of the top widely distributed Belgians. Ok, any of the strong Belgians, oh Leffe. Anyway, I love the bottle and the glass. I don't know how it ages, but I would be happy to try a vintage bottle to see if the complexity goes up as the age does.

Circling the bubbles is an army of sediment soldiers. After the head decides to fade a deep sheet of pocked lacing is left behind. Smells bready, sweet, spicy and phenolic. Tastes of sweet malts, dried fruits, florals, yeasts and bananas. There's a good, welcomed hit of alcohol heat in the throat.

While there are a lot of fruits in the taste, apple, orange, pear, berries, there are also some figs and a caramel/honey syrupy sweetness and texture on the outside of the beer. Also had some spiciness to it, and a little sour crispness with some of the fruit taste. Finishes warming and with a spicy fruit taste.

Not very bold on the nose but mild and subdued. Some yeastyness and a little spice show up also. Taste has a little more umph than the smell. Same mild fruityness and spice just more noticable. 9% is well hidden. Full body with a smooth finish. There is no doubt that this is a quality brew with no flaws. The flavor profile is not as in your face as many of the extreame beers but is very full in a somehow subdued way. A great sipper to take your time with and enjoy what shows itself with each sip.

4.15,0.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a beautiful and brilliantly clear yellow gold in color with a little over a finger of dense white head that retreated rather quickly. Pleasant aroma, lots of esters with some phenols and just a hint of malt character. The esters are mostly pears, some green apples, and maybe just a touch of banana. The phenols are restrained and slightly spicy/peppery. There is also a light floral character, possibly from some later hopping or from the esters, I can't really say. It is quickly becoming evident that the yeast is the star of the show. The yeast character is, however, not overwhelming as all of the esters, phenols, and alcohols it produced coexist quite well and exhibit an excellent balance of flavors. The taste is much like the aroma with the emphasis on the fruity esters. Pears and green apples are present and dominant but not overwhelming throughout. Towards the finish the spicy/peppery phenols return and take over but soon yield to a pleasant floral/fruity character that lingers long into the finish. A solid but not domineering bitterness builds and crescendos at the finish but still plays in the background. A soft malt character that compliments the other flavor components quite well, comes and goes. Carbonation is a bit more than moderate but not quite as high as i would have expected for the style. Body is relatively light. Smooth alcohol an a somewhat dry finish. The alcohol is failrly hard to detect and sneaks up on you a bit. Drinkability is good, very quaffable and relatively complex. This brew is somewhat more restrained than others of the style but is thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.","mnj21655","Sep 15, 2008"

The texture was very smooth with practically no carbonation. The light Belgian ales aren't really my thing (I want to try Delirium Nocturnum), so I can't say that I particularly enjoyed it.

Wow what a snapshot BSPA. Somewhat hazy beautiful golden-straw color. Smells of yeast,tart lemony aromas. Biting on the tongue, flavors of lemony-apricots, cherries, slight burn in the throat. Very long sweetish aftertaste that is cut pleasently by the tartness and carbonation. Wow, one of the bes example of this style I have sampled thusfar I must say.

Spicy nose with the presence of clove, citrus fruit and belgian yeast. Taste similar to nose with the additional presence of lemon zest. Extremely lively mouthfeel. Very effervescent across the entire tongue and mouth, but a little too much burn. Alcohol was very well-hidden, with a clean, crisp astringency at the end.

The taste is also quite good; a light grape-like fruity maltyness that does a perfect job of covering the alcohol - almost to the point of making the alcohol indiscernible. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a full, creamy carbonation to boot. Given the abv rating along with the smoothness and drinkability of this beer makes this one dangerous brew.

The aroma is a very pleasant lightly sweet blend of straw, flowers, citrus, white grape and spice. The taste follows suit, with the fruit and citrus not being to dominant flavor yet being the most noteworthy, and they carry through the finish and win out over the alcohol and a light aftertaste there. Not bad enough to really knock any points off for, but it's there. It has a medium body, almost juicy texture and low carbonation.

Very bubbly and soapy with great thickness cover the glass. The smell is at first of lemony cirtus with a strong sense of oily components. By going deeper through this, light floral complexities are noted with a nectar-like smell. The taste repeats these flavorings with a very slight hint of spice and a sour aftertaste. The foamy body creates an incredible mouthfee that goes down very smooth, beginning as frothy and ending as light and watery.

There are visible flecks of yeast floating around the commotion caused by the constant bubbling. The smell mostly belgian funk. There is also a cidery aroma that comes through. If someone didn't know what they were smelling, you might almost be able to convince them it was cider. The taste is much better than the smell.

Tough to smell anything through my stuffy cold though. Malty and citrusy taste with a little bitterness on the finish. A little taste of alcohol on the finish as well.

Bottle is indeed quite unique with its yellow opaque color and pink elephants on the label. Poured from the 750 ml corked and caged bottle it was a beautiful gold bronze color. Slightly cloudy it produced a big soap suds looking head that left a clean set of lacing rings as it settled. Really powerful nose of yeasts and malts, with lots of spices with coriander most prominent, with citrus, fruit, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is crisp, and feels good going down with a slight creamyness. Finish slightly bitter. But overall while this is good, there are Belgium Strong Ales domestic versions right here in my own back yard such as North Coast PranQster Belgian that tasted just as good, and costs a fraction of what I paid for this one.","rkuhnel","Jan 21, 2007"

Clean, crisp, balanced flavors of citrus hard candies (orange, lemon and pineapple), bananas, yeast, spices, fresh-baked bread and caramel malts are enjoyed.

The mouth feel is yeasty and carbonated, but not too much of either. A reminder of its goodness hangs about on the back of the tongue. It's 8.5 ABV is not apparent, absorbed by its blend.

Beautiful deep golden color, with a great aroma of banana and possibly some apple in there. First hit on the tongue wakes up the taste buds in a big way. I always thought Tremens was a Tripel, but that big initial blast of hop proves it is really the Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It isn't overwhelming, but surprising at the very least. After your buds get over the initial blast, you begin to taste the incredible floral boquet. There's a little coriander, maybe a little citrus. It definitely stays there for quite a while, too. Great lingering aftertaste. Overall, this is just one of my top beer favorites worldwide. Can't beat the bottle and packaging, either. Pink elephants?

This beer really slides down easily, and although I intended on just sipping it as I do most Belgians, it's so extremely drinkable I find I'm trying not to down it in bigger gulps.

The first thing to hit my nose was strong flowery esters, namely sweet rose and tulip. There are also lots of apples and pears, giving an overall sweet nose. The taste, again, was huge on flower petals and pears, though not overwhelmingly sweet. There was a sour bitterness which was a bit pithy or zesty maybe. On the back of the palate, the alcohol really comes through (especially in vapors), and released a bouquet of sweet and savory spices.

Being a crisp, dry, and sweet beer, this is easy to sip. I did not like the slightly chalky, earthy texture it had, especially in the finish. A bottle of this was all I really wanted.

Aromas are solidly sweet of malts and sugars form other sources, spices, Belgian yeast, fruity, and alcohol. Colors are strong yellow-straw and vigorously carbonated and retained its head well. Tastes sweet with malt and honey (maybe some wheat thrown in). Spicy and hot from fermentation and spice addition makes the beer peppery and prickly to the mouth. Fruitiness reminds me of lemonheads candy with tartness of grapefruit, pears, and under-ripe cherries. The body is medium-full (would be full, but thinned by the alcohol). The carbonation numbs the mouth, except for the fusal alcohol flavors (which are a bit much.) Finishes with a cotton candy sweetness and alcoholic warmth.

Starts sweet, then gives way to faintly sour fruits on the mid-palate, and honey at the end. Finish is dry and warm with alcohol. Mouthfilling carbonation provides the illusion that this is a heavy bodied beer.

I dont know if it was due to the temperature I drank it at, as it was slighlty chilled, but the carbonation seemed to dominate the taste, almost like carbonated water.

Also detected some sourness/sweat-like funk to it in the background, kind of like what you would expect with Brettanomyces, but not as upfront. Nice spicy taste with banana flavors - a very German wheat beer-like profile to it but with some other flavors going on. Frothy on the mouth with moderate body.

Layers of fruit character are also found here with apple and pear being prominent along with a sort of fruit-reminiscent tartness that is also found in these fruits. As the beer warms up a tad, I begin to get some notes of hot alcohol in the finish. It almost adds to the perceived spiciness of this beer, and actually is not all that detracting.

Lots of excited bubbles in this one, and the beautiful, light color of the nectar I'm beholding showcases them perfectly. Even as I was pouring I unintentially caught the aroma of this baby--I smelled that familiar, sweet, belgian smell. Has that citrusy, fresh smell that screams, ""stop smelling me and get me on your tongue!"" I obeyed. I'm not the biggest fan in the world of the wheaty taste of wits and belgian strongs, but I'm loving this and know something good when I meet it, and this is good. The head is receding now I'm about halfway through the glass, but has maintained a good, solid sheet of foamy love about 2 mm thick across the surface and a few thin tendrils lacing the glass on the side I've been drinking from. Still lots of bubbles. Still delicious. It's not as sweet as some belgians and seems to have found a great balance. The just-enough hops backs it up and the alcohol hardly seems present.

Anyway the beer poured a very enticing cool golden color with a nice thick head into a sniffer. Smell was wonderful...there were many different fruit aromas going on, each one not overpowering but just right. If you can imagine fruit salad in a beer then you get the idea. There was also a slight spicyness that strangely enough complimented the fruit smells very well. Taste was also very good...pretty big hop presence with fruit flavors going wild. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled with was the carbonation, which was a bit too much for my liking. Drinkability was pretty damn good, but I think the alcohol could be a factor considering that after one I felt a bit buzzed. Final Verdict: A very nice beer, definetly worth a try.

Light sweet malt melds with the assertive yeast, yielding sweet, bready notes with light spice. Clove, banana, a touch of pepper. Body is nice, creamy, and a touch buttery.

By the time you pour it into the glass, the aroma (something like a Hefe Weizen) is very pronounced. This is my first Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I thought DT tasted very much like a Hefe. There is a citrus and astringent taste but the astringent part is much more balanced and acceptable than any Hefe I have had. I did not notice the high alcohol from the taste.

When I popped the cap, the bottle started to push the foam to the top rather quickly, threatening a spillover, so I had to pour quickly. A nice off-white head, leaving thick lace on the distinctive DT glass. The head receded rather quickly, but kept itself at a moderate level for the entire drink. In this bottle, I have thick, murky yeast sediment, which I do not remember when I had this last. Colossal chunks of yeast floating. Hmm. The beer is dull light amber, hints of orange. Massive grapefruit aroma is the initial smell. I actually quite enjoy the aroma: sugary peach and nectarine, with some spicy clove and yeast, with enough light caramel malt for balance. I also smell tomato juice and brown sugar. At the same time, there is some smell which is off-putting to me, which I cannot quite describe. The flavour does the aroma no justice. I was expecting more fruitiness, and more body. Soapy yeast at first, with some dryness starting in the middle and following through to the finish, leaving very little aftertaste. Citrusy grapefruit, light malt, some hop bittering, and a definite alcohol presence. The taste is definitely not as complex as the aroma. Medium-bodied: in fact, it tastes quite watery; for a strong pale ale this should have much more weight in the mouth. Medium carbonation. DT is not terribly drinkable, with the yeast mustiness and the alcohol. Not quite the defining example for the Belgian Strong Pale Ale class, despite what some might say.","Cwrw","Jan 11, 2005"

The taste is nicely complex with a piney, citrusy flavor and dry peppery, and herbal finish with a warmth of alcohol. From the few of this style I have tasted, this one represents them well.

The aromas were of dried fruits (pears, strawberry, tropical), spices, light hops, some sweet malt and a hint of yeast and alcohol. The flavors were dominated by the fruits (pineapple), some spices (clove, pepper), hops, sweet honey, malt (light), yeast, and nice warming alcohol. Finished with a slight dryness mixed with alcohol on the tongue. Medium bodied. Sweet, spicy and dry came to mind while drinking this beer. All the flavors seemed to be very nicely balanced; each aroma and flavor seemed to compliment one another well. A must try.","Jarod","Aug 04, 2003"

I certainly don't appreciate this like others, but this is a nice beer. If all the subtlties of the aroma were evident in the flavor I'd give it a highter rating. Maybe it's a freshness issue.

The alcohol is very subtle fot the stregnth of this beer, which is 8.5% not 9 as listed above. A very solid beer though I think its winning the world beer champoinships is a little bit much.

Alcohol flavor is mild, and aftertaste is cherry-like. I actually found it to be a bit too sweet until I added the yeast -- this gave the flavor a bit more zing and helped to balance.

The head was huge (and a beautiful color and consistency), and even though I though I poured it properly it still ran over! The color was a cloudy pale gold, with only a faint aroma of lemon and malt. Alcohol was fairly noticeable, which leads me to believe the content may be a bit higher than 9.0%. I also noticed that the flavors became more subtle and pleasant as the beer warmed slightly and was exposed to the air.

It pours a clear golden/orange color with tons of carbonation. Its topped off by a thick and fluffy white foam that fades down into a 1/4-inch head, which retains itself for the entire duration, leaving a sticky lace splattered on the side of the glass. This beer is bursting with a huge arsenal of aromas. Bananas, coriander, malt, alcohol and grapefruit are very prominent, intermixed with subtle hints of vanilla and hops that are blended together splendidly to give this beer an extremely complex nose. I detected a different scent every time I took a whiff. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma. The spiciness of coriander and the tanginess of citrus fruit hit the taste buds first, followed by a mild sweetness, possibly the banana, and then finished off with a mellow bitterness of hops. The vast array of flavors masks the alcohol taste quite well. The high carbonation level gives this brew almost champagne-like qualities, which tickles my tongue. This is an extremely balanced and complex beer, theres so much going on. If it werent for the high cost ($8.99 per bottle) I would always have this beer on hand. I just cant say enough about this beer.","Scooter77","Apr 04, 2003"

Nose is fruity and spicy with notes of fresh citrus, sweet malts, and pepper. Very nice! Very smooth and creamy mouth feel with a fine carbonation.

I hope I didn't get too much yeast in the pour, it was hard to judge since the bottle is opaque. On to the aroma, spicy pepper, a bit tart, and a bit sweet. Very yeasty as well, which I find quite pleasant actually. The flavor comes in as a wave of pepper spiciness with a big backbone of yeast-coated hops. Malt shows up as part of this as well in a slight bready character. As it swirls in your mouth, the pepper character (and slight alcohol presence) really make your tongue tingle, but the aforementioned backbone is still huge. Turns sweeter in the back and in the finish. Other spiciness is present here and there. A very tasty tripel, highly recommended! Mine actually stated an 8.5% abv on the bottle, not 9.0%.

At one point I did let it settle too long and it got warm, one of my friends tried it out of curiousity and told me ""Thats a good wine cooler"" Hmm..

Of all of the beers i've tried, this one would probably be the most ""dangerous", because it is very light, quite carbonated, and the flavor is fairly restrained (considering the high alcohol content). Spicy, fruity, and quite easy to drink. Not quite as flavorful or distinctive as my personal favorite, Duvel, but similar to a few other beers of the style (particularly Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde and Don De Dieu? - maybe this is the beer they modeled those after?))

Man - Weird !!!, its almost as though its not the same beer I remember, but that it is, in a strange Twilight-Zone sort of way. Bad beer, or bad memory??. I'm not sure. Onto the review, a highly carbonated pour, with a frothy head that soon dissappeared into thin lacy lines on the Glass and a scum almost. The spiciness was there - but not the hoppy character I (think I ?!) remember. A strange non-descript mouthfeel, but clean tasting. Orangey-Amber color and very clear - too clear. Again, I recall many DT's with a very slight haze in Belgium. Well I'm confused !!!?. But I have to be honest, I hate to admit this as a die-hard fan, and mark this one as a huge disappointment. At the risk of potential libel action no doubt - I really do wonder to myself if it is the same beer as sold in it's homeland. If it is - it does not travel well.

Anyway, it looks great, clear golden yellow with copious carbonation that ensures a fluffy white head and lacing that follows the brew down the glass. Sweet pear aromas, honey, apples; at this point I'm intrigued. The taste, however, is almost too sweet, slightly out of whack.

3.41,-17.4,4,3,3,4.5,4,"Pours a deep golden color, appears cloudy a bit, with good white belgian lace. On the nose it is super perfumy (don't like), tangy, fruity, zesty, and spicy. The same is on the palate spiciness, fruitiness, sweet maltiness. Overall a decent Belgian, sort of feels like your drinking perfume though...","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 29, 2002"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"A very tasty beer that packs a wallop.  Clear golden yellow in color, pours with a large white head.  Smells quite sweet, spicy, candyish.  Starts sweet, almost cloying.  Lots of sugar and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg) throughout.  Alcohol is fairly noticeable.  Medium light body.  One makes an excellent nightcap.  Two would make a good sleeping potion.","htomsirveaux","Jul 15, 2002"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"An excellent beer.  It is very fragrant and floral.  Hints of fruit and spice abound in this one.  And these aromas are robust.  This is the equivalent of real Columbian coffee - very aromatic and flavorful.  The first sip is a bit harsh if you are not ready for it, it will jump up at you.  At the end, you may be tempted to have another, but be wary, the ABV will seek and destroy after more than two if these Belgian beauties.  Bottoms Up!","goindownsouth","Jun 29, 2002"
1.86,-55,3.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,1,"Well, I didnt like it. The alcohol hits very hard in the taste and smell, but there was also a sweetness which I didnt think fit. If you can stand this stuff, more power to ya. I wont be buying any of this in the near future.","IrishRedRock","Jun 24, 2002"
4.73,14.5,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Unique ceramic off white bottle, with shiny blue foil. Characters on the label include pink elephants, green alligators, and purple dragons. My sweetie liked the bottle so she bought it. Hmmmm...Well it tastes great ! Pours golden orange/yellow, nice initial fluffy white head, settles quickly but leaves an interesting circle of foam. Lots of sweet floral and citrus smell, very smooooth. Nice sweet taste, not overly carbonated like others in the class (see orval) Very sweet finishes with lots of maltness, almost no hops or bitterness until seconds later. Very very easy to drink (guzzle) 8.5 %abv will sneak right by. Leaves you warm, and fuzzy wondering about those pink elephants on the label. Go ahead and buy it when you see it, you won't be dissapointed. I think it's better than the Golden Monkey in it's class.","StevieW","Jun 07, 2002"
4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Impressively thick and very dense white head.  Hazy dark yellow hue.  The highly appetizing aroma is comprised of fruity pear and kiwi notes along w/ green apple acetaldehyde.  A fragrant floral rose petal note can be discerned as well, and mild phenol and heaty fusels round out the nose.  Fairly full bodied when compared to Duvel, w/ a lower carbonation and smoother feel. The rich, sweet, honey - like malt flavors are accompanied by black pepper notes, w/ just a hint of clove.  Finishes quite sweet, pleasantly musty and with mellow alcohol warmth.  This is a highly enjoyable brew.  Delirium Tremens has characteristics of strong golden ales and trippels and falls in between the two styles flavorwise.","marc77","May 25, 2002"
3.06,-25.9,4,3,3,3,3,"A nice beer, but tends to have that alcohol sweetness that you find in malt liquors, still nice and strong in its body and flavour, worth atry.","rastaman","Apr 05, 2002"
4.18,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Further update: Yes, overzealous indeed, but as a Belgian Strong Pale, the availability is a plus. There is some variability, but I like it quite a bit, still.","cokes","Apr 03, 2002"

4.7,13.8,4,4,5,5,5,"You know you've got a strong ale when it comes in a signature snifter style glass featuring pink elephants.  The alcohol kick was deceptively well blended in this golden elixer.  Definitely a sipper.","Brent","Sep 02, 2001"
