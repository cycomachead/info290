"O: My biggest complaint, way too much carbonation, I'm not sure if the tart funk bitterness is a regular flavor in this style but it seems to not be, no bottle date, so it may be old. I would love to know the bottle date or try one fresh. It starts well but doesn't finish well."
""
"The taste has a dry bite to it along with the toasted and juicy fruit characters already mentioned."
"Im glad I revisited this beer, havent had in a couple years, really great all around but only 7.99 @ Bevmo I had to grab with a fresh Carnevale last month."
""
"At Monk's.  Just not for me.  Straight up Strong Pale Ale."

"A really great Belgian-styled beer from Lost Abbey, a drier, hoppier alternative to the original ones, without ignoring the rich yeasts."

"Wasn't sure what to expect from this beer... poured very light, almost looked like a wit-beer... but the taste was great... paired with spiced chorizo sausage and cheese and spicy Gouda cheese and was great, brought out the flavor in this beer, perfect pairing..."

"O- Definitely one of my new top 5 BSPAs.  Has all the components that I look for in the style: Champagne-like carbonation, is dry yet still somewhat sweet and has a yeast presence that's almost perfectly balanced toward the malt flavor."

"The body is very creamy with a fine soft effervescence."

"25.4 oz Bomber.Finally I get to review a Lost abbey product I have heard so much about.Inferno ale at 9.0 surely gets the job done but the taste is not quite there.A little Hoppy with a touch of grapefruit and a lot of carbonation.You can feel the alcohol burn when you drink it.Maybe better suited as a winter beer.Watch out for the heartburn.Ok beer but at 10.99 a bottle you want more than ok.Probably would not get this beer again.Not even Black Sabbath could make this and excellent beer.Motley out"

"A solid Tripel. Good flavour even if there isn't a twist. Carbonation a little lacking."
"It's not all that easy to drink. It smells so good, but then it's just painful to finish. I have a whole bomber to get through and I have no idea how. This misses the mark."

"pours hazy yellow orange. lot of musty grain and alcohol on nose. flavor explosively earthy. wow this is a great beer. I right now prefer it to Russian river damnation. still the duvel is king of strong pales and will always be, but yea these American brewers know how to get it close"

"O - Complex and bold in aroma and flavor, Inferno Ale packs a wallop (of alcohol) that goes generally unnoticed through it's consumption, a trait sought after in this highly drinkable style. An incredible Belgian Strong Pale Ale from start to finish, The Lost Abbey's Inferno Ale get as close to replicating the classics as possible, so close in fact, one might believe it straight from Belgium in a blind tasting! To top it off, every time I've experienced this beer it retains it's quality, which is more than I can say for one of the largest producers of this style. The Lost Abbey's Inferno Ale is a world-class beer that absolutely must be tried by any self-respecting beer lover."
"D: drinks pretty good after 3 years. a tasty Belgian strong blond, with some very interesting barnyard funky notes. really found this enjoyable and wonder if it is equally as barn-like fresh."

"First, I prefer IPAs, the bitterer the betterer. Given that, I got this as a gift and had to try it. The color was a nice golden, the head was one finger floating above four in a snifter, slowing melting to a nice coat on the top. Ale was about 36-38 degrees F. (I like my IPAs cold) Smell was mild, fruity, typical of a belgian, with no individual overwhelming flavor. Taste was nice, extremely complex, sweet after-taste, but enough bitterness not to be cloying. Spices well mixed, several different fruity hints overlapped each other. Mouth feel was great - smooth, thick almost, left nice coating. Alcohol was nicely hidden by the complexity of the flavors, nice buzz after a while. I just might try some more of these unique belgians from now on."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/4/2012. No carbonation pop upon opening. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a thin lace cap for a head that reduces to a ring. Minimal clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, honey, wheat, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters and malt sweetness; with a great malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Zero carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall, despite having nearly zero carbonation; this was a very good Belgian strong golden. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden - there is a decent amount of complexity. I found this one enjoyable and I would recommend checking this one out."
""
"taste is . . . . very floral. very 'belgian'-like. nice for 9%, but very rich. I've kind of burned out on the rich brews and the Belgians, but this is still very well crafted. it was my fault for going on an all-out Belgian-fest and getting tired of these beautiful rich brews... not sure why I even picked this one up.... but here I am, here it is, and I haven't officially logged a review on this one yet although I've had it many times.... I still love this one and appreciate the what they've done on this one...."

"o: good stuff! nice mix of spice, yeast, and sweet malt and citrus flavors. all harmonized well. a real easy drinker. be careful though, the 9% is completely hidden"

"O: This beer has a nice amount of complexity and manages to hide its alcohol very well. It's a very good representation of the style."
"Bottle. Hazy golden, almost pale colour, with a good head with a two figers head that goes quicly, big bubbles. Smell of tropical fruits, spices, bananas. It feels really good in the palate, soft but pungent, mild with a note of sweet and wild fruits and spices. Taste of tropical fruits, banana, spices, kind of hot spices, semisweet and dry finish... a lot of things that seem to change from aone moment to another. Brilliant."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a chunky cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and some peppery aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."

"Highly enjoyable Belgian strong pale. Easy to find here in SD too and a good price."
"Hmmm, could be the condition of this bottle, but this is far from Lost Abbey's finest. Comes across blunt and amateurish."

"Overall: Very tasty, could be an everyday kind of beer if I didn't have so many others to try first."

"This January 2013 I review a bottle of Inferno bottled October 2011. This pours with the same thick head, but it dissipates faster and sticks around the sides of the glass above the beer. There are no bubbles rising in the orange liquid. the smell actually reminds me of wine- lots of fruit but a lot more alcohol in the smell than what I recall a young Inferno to have. I raised smell up to 5 after it warmed and the alcohol in the nose went down bring more of the raisin and pear and peach like smells out. Before the taste I will describe te mouthfeel as it is unique for how little bubble action we see: as soon as it's in my mouth it starts to lightly bubble and fizz. As if it was just waiting for me to taste it for it to come alive. First you get the fizz on your tongue - then you get the flavor. As the carbonation dies down in your mouth the different flavors of bread, fruits, and a metallic alcohol presence (that I associate with wine) come about. It isn't that it tasted different with each sip- it is well balanced between the bread and jam-like flavors with the alcohol resting underneath, but the way the flavor opens up in your mouth with the strong carbonation apparently starting to bubble in your mouth- then instantly ceasing to reveal a marvelously mixed flavor is something I don't recall at all from a young bottle, and it's quite an entertaining drinking experience. And it maintains that fizz-in-your-mouth quality to the end of the bottle. I would have liked to review alongside a fresh bottle but these are big bottles. Off my memory of a young bottle: main differences as far as flavor: the young bottle I remember had a somewhat sharp presence of yeast. It really stood out and brought a somewhat bitter funk flavor. Here that flavor is still present but is more entwined with the overallflavor rather than tasting like an element that stands out. You taste more of the fruity malt influence and a slightly dry metallic aftertaste. I didn't know what to expect- this is a first aged beer but damn it shows that it's worth the time."
"An all around tasty Belgian Pale with great flavors and aromas traditional of the style."
"Another very enjoyable Belgian from the lost abbey."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this beer is more interesting than many others in this style. Powerful yeast driven flavor make this one a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely the best American brewed Strong Golden Ale I've had. Slightly Maltier than the original SGA, Duvel. Well balanced, and begs to be paired with some freshly grilled salmon and a green salad with a light champagne vinaigrette drizzled on top."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall inferno? this is heavenly with a sweetly well balanced flavor that flows together oh so smoothly from start to finish. A lot of subtle notes bring out the complexity with a well toned nature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: as I said, objectively this is a good beer. But it has a je ne sais quoi that really appeals to me: the light funk, perhaps, or the annoying head. In any case, I like this beer a lot and would gladly have it again."
""
"O: had to force this beer down....would have happily dumped it down the drain but did not want to waste the trade...yuck...I could be done with lost abbey beers...this was the pits!"
"a nice bottle for about 10 bucks. pours a fuzzy pale straw color with some suspended yeast and a growing white head that seems to stay a few inches tall the whole time. it smells fresh like cut grass and meadow flowers. theres some fruity pep from the yeast, and a waft of alcohol indicating the strength of this one. it tastes similar to the nose, more springtime than fall, with some floral notes as well as that grassy hop complexion. it finishes very quickly and is bone dry. its not bitter, but there is a strong hop presence in the finish as well. the mouthfeel is great, excited carbonation from the belgian yeast, a deep medium body, and a moderate alcohol sting. i love the dry finish too, perfect for this type of brew. while this certainly isnt my favorite lost abbey selection, its one im glad i purchased. its different than many other beers in this genre, and it was the perfect (if ironic) choice of beer for making my annual hot sauce for canning. just right."

"O. A fantastic BPA. One of the best I have had. This should be a go-to for fans of the style. Spectacular achievement, very much enjoyed."
""
""
""
"We have yet another winner from the Lost Abbey line of beers. Now I'm a little upset at myself for purchasing the smaller bottle and not the larger 750."
"The color when poured into a pint glass was a hazy yellow with a reddish hue, with a load of white foam and a load of lace on the side of the glass from top to bottom. The smell of carbonated yeasty bread and spices was evident in to aroma. The flavor had a very carbonated yeasty, spicy and fruity finish. Well balanced and a very pleasant aftertaste."
"Not bad, I kind of like it!"
""
"From a corked 750, this beer is a straw yellow with bright clarity on the first pour (with some subsequent yeast haze). The head is tall, firm, and white. It's aroma very spicy...Belgian...phenolic and grassy. Some malt, but it takes a backseat to the complex yeastiness and pepper. The flavor is very bitter, with some alcohol warmth. No real sweetness...dry and firm. Full and enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a lightly hazed golden orange color with a white head. Very nice citrus note on the nose, yeast, and some spiciness to it as well. A touch of alcohol, some floral hops, just a light malt sweetness. The citrus really comes through on the nose. A bit citric, some yest, some spices, and a touch of booze. Lightly floral, quite dry, and a light sweetness in the middle."
""
""
"Wonderful version of the style. Less fruity than many others, including those from Belgium. Who cares. This one is a winner."
""
"O- A very nice spicy, Belgian-style beer, it's damn drinkable for 9%, I basically pounded this bottle pretty quickly, tasty stuff."
"O - good beer. Nice interpretation of the style. For a beer called inferno I find it quite refreshing."
""
""
""
"A very well crafted brew that is so nice to drink. Solid belgian here."
""
""
"Very good ale here. I really enjoyed it for the complexity of the several flavors working together. I would put this up there with other big names of the style for sure."
""
"This beer ain't messing around. It knows what it wants and does it well: Deliver a serious tasting Belgian Strong Pale to your taste buds and get the heck out of there! This would be refreshing on a hot day or a cold winter night. I'll have to pick this one up again when I see it."
""
"Overall I will buy this again instead of La Fin Du monde. Just as good and one heck of a lot cheaper."
"Shortly after finishing this review, I realized that I had no desire to finish the bottle, and I've got too many good beers on hand to drink another pint of this one. When I realized I was about to drainpour half of a $10+ bomber, I also realized my rating of 3.5 was too high, so I've adjusted it accordingly."

"Overall (4.5/5): The Lost Abbey's Inferno Ale is one of the best American takes on a Belgian ale of ANY style that I have had the pleasure of drinking. Its aroma and taste are both top notch; its appearance and mouthfeel both help to enhance the former two and the overall drinking experience. This is another great ale from Tomme and the gang at The Lost Abbey. If you're into strong Belgian pale ales, seek it out."
"D - Very well done. The bottle conditioning really shows here and helps with both body and carbonation, making this one of if not the best American made Belgians that I have had to date."
"Overall: this one is very well rounded and very drinkable. The rating is high but this one deserves it."
""
"O- This is a wonderful beer. I only aged it for a few months, but it might be a candidate for much longer aging. The again, with the relatively normal ABV... The point is get this beer."
""
"Lost Abbey Inferno Ale is a Belgian Strong Pale Ale that pours a slightly hazy, pale golden color. A BIG fluffy white head caps the brew, which lasts quite a while and clings all over the glass as it dissipates. BIG aromas of yeasty funk slide into slight lemon an honey notes. Bready yeast and sweet malt flavors mix wonderfully with hints of pepper, citrus, and honey. 8.5% ABV, Inferno Ale is medium bodied and clean, with a medium-high level of carbonation. We LOVE this brewery!"
""
"Overall: a very good belgian ale that is refreshing and very flavorful. Superb beer."
""
""
""
"Paired with sushi and spicy mayo, this beer really cleans the palate and clears the heat off the back of your tongue from spicy foods. Such an incredibly dry clean finish."
"O: Well-balanced. Bold flavors, crisp. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wish there was also a scoring button for the label because this one is epic. The beer in the bottle is pretty darn good too, I enjoyed it."
""
"Overall pretty solid beer and a fun one to drink. Carbonation seems to hint at a displeasure but even this big it's actually feels like an enhancement. I would have this again."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was very enjoyable."
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Exploded out the bottle, losing about 10%. Pours a medium yellow-orange amber, lots of carbonation. Massive thick white head and lacing. Aroma of Belgian spices, yeast and light fruit. A light metallic component to the aroma. Flavor is dry, spicy with light fruit and a hint of Brett or wild yeast. Dry peppery finish. The wild yeast component is mild enough that I enjoyed this ale. I'd probably choose a Belgian over this because of the dryness, but it is well made and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An unmitigated success that cements The Lost Abbey in my mind as an excellent brewery. Highly recommended if you like Belgian pale ales. I would drink again, despite the steep price tag. Drinkable and undeniably pleasant."
""
""
"B-"
"Wow. Amazing overall. Beyond earthly description."
""

"O - Very tasty. I bit heavier than Duvel,but not at all in a bad way. Nice depth of flavors."
""

"Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one with me on Super Bowl Sunday as a pre-game snack! Bottle on 10/5/11! Served from bottle into a Bell’s stemmed tulip. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a pure white five finger head that subsided to three fingers very slowly. It maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, floral, floral hop, spices, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, clove, fruit, floral, floral hop, earth, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The appearance was pretty nice on this one. There was a lot going on in the flavor of this one that really made you guess on the style of this brew. The aroma was pretty complex too. Definitely worth trying if you have a chance to try it, but I know I would love to try this one on tap to be able to see how different this one is from the bottle."
""
"first things first, i inverted the bottle to get some of that yeasty goodness that had settled, i did notice what looked like long stick like sedament, which was kinda strange, i blamed the cork, but that was fully intact. so i poured it and got a nice fruit rind arouma, look is foggy golden with some roasted grains, again..cirus fruit rind(maybe lemon ad/or grapefrut) head retention is amazing. nice thick white foam, with good looking lacing. mouthfeel is robust, full bodied with slight bitterness. it does make you wana take a whiff with everysip. suttle spices in auroma. alcohol is noticeble, but not overpowering. great beer, i can see this stocked regulrly stocked in my fridge. big thanks to jay from stone liquor."

"I know that this 'style' is attempted a lot by domestic brewers, but in my opinion it is seldom done without numerous flaws; however, not this offering. Flavorful yet balanced and well in line with a traditional Belgian Strong Pale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Really great Belgian style pale ale, big aromas and flavors, great body, really well crafted all around and at $5 a pretty good value in comparison to other beers in this style like La Chouffe or Duvel."
""
"Very clear, well filtered beer that is gold in color for the body and a very fluffy white head. Carbonation just keeps coming and coming. Yeast is pronounced in the front of this. Earthy, herbal, cloves, almost masala like. Taste is vanilla, herbal and floral. Yeast is still very much there. Nice alcohol burn to finish. Carbonation is high which give the impression of being a light beer. I really like this beer. Very versatile. I had several sips of this to begin and felt that is a great stand alone beer. However, I had to sit down for lunch and wasn't finished with it yet. Had it with some Nepali food. Great combo. Pairs well with food in spite of the alcohol. Would have this again."

"Poured a hazy brownish orange, immense offwhite head that's dense, soapy with huge lacing. Nose is yeasty and fruity, quite Duvel-like. Great hop notes, light grassy and green apple notes. A bit of alcohol and general sweetness. Taste reflects the nose, great fruitiness, a little spice in the finish. Yeasty and lightly grainy finish. Dry and gentle effervescence. A very nice golden strong, stands up nicely to Duvel and I would revisit this regularly if available locally (yeah right). Impressive."

"Overall a fantastic brew. Would seek it out for sure."
"This was a very nice beer, and a great Belgian-from-a-non-Belgian. This had style and sophistication far above its genesis. Good work."
"O- Good first review for Lost Abbery. I could have done without some o the herbal character, but nonetheless a solid beer."
"O - Very solid BSPA, Duvel is still king, but this makes for a nice runner-up!"
"Effervescent body, light and bubbly, dry aftertaste. Dried apricot and pear flavors, some floral notes also. Crisp with some dusty sweetness lingering, yeast esters, very slight hint of alcohol as it warms. Decent, but probably not something i'd go for again as the sweetness limits the appeal personally."
"Great flavors, but the alcohol is a little much on the finish."
"O: I like it. I enjoy a drier Belgian-style ale after so many sweet American interpretations. Tasty"
"Pours a crisp, light golden color, with a huge, fluffy white head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, apples, pears and some nice spice. On the palate, this one is light bodied, complex and refreshing, with flavors of freshly ground black pepper, crisp, juicy apples and pears, Belgian yeast and some sweet malt."
"Not my favorite of the style. Very sweet. Hides the alcohol well."
"O: This is a very delicious Belgian Strong Pale, and I would thoroughly recommend it."
"O - Now this is a great Belgian pale ale. this is up there with one of my favorites..the Horny Devil. I will be back for more..."
"25oz bottle. Surprisingly clear and light golden pour, with a medium white head. Yeasty and fruity. Very reminiscent of some staple belgium strong blonde offerings. Light tropical fruits balanced by a moderate hop presence. Nothing to freak out about, but good."
"O: Very balanced malt and yeast character. Nice looking beer too."
"O: Not quite what I was expecting but a tasty brew"
"Overall is real good. Highly drinkable and yet another great Lost Abbey beer. Worth drinking again."
"This brew poured out as a pretty nice looking hazy yellow color. Not really what I expected when I read the name of the beer. The head that formed as I poured this one out was big, rocky and white. Pretty good lacing on this one. The smell of the beer gave off a decent amount of Belgian yeast aromas and some sweet malts. The taste of the beer was rather mild also, I thought that maybe there would be a touch of peppery spice in there but I wasn't getting any from what I could tell. The mouthfeel of this brew is pretty smooth, a very easy going drink. Overall I liked it, I found it to be pretty good and would probably drink it again one day."
"O - This is a very tasty Belgian-style ale. Another good one from The Lost Abbey."
"Finish is lightly lingering with the hops bringing citrus and a little pine needle."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The appearance, nose and mouthfeel were all great, but the breadiness is a bit much in the flavor. At the pricepoint, I would probably stick with something more balanced, like a Duvel."
"Overall it's a solid beer. Pleasing aroma and taste and easy to drink. I don't have much negative to say really."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this beer. Not overly complex, but a wonderful blend of subtle flavors make a sweet, interesting, easy to drink strong ale."
"Overall, a very nice and comforting beer. Something I might drink if I was in Nosferatu's castle after a long journey through the canyon."
"I am seriously trying to get into Belgian beers. It is a hit or miss and this counts for both domestic and imported beers. After popping the cork and pouring into my snifter, it looked good but I was hoping for something less filtered. The smell was sweet and spicy but nothing special. The taste was a little better. I let it warm a bit and got a bit more spice but was not savoring every sip. I got bored with it pretty quick. The mouthfeel was pretty average. Nothing special. Overall this was good, but for a Belgian Strong Pale, I was left with my desires unsatisfied. The carbonation was there but did not clean the palate like I would have liked. The strong portions of the flavor stuck around a bit too long. Lost Abbey makes some good brews. Despite my warm buzz at the end of the entire bottle, I felt as if I was ripped off by the brewer. I'd rather have a Damnation or a Pranqster, which can be argued as a different classification. But for American brewed Belgian golden/pale ales, this one is not at the top of my list. However, many may think I am wrong."
"Light to medium mouthfeel with nearly no notice of the alcohol. Hard not to compare this Duvel, but it does not really measure up to that level. But, good in it's own right with a different mix of flavors. Solid brew."
"Overall: This beer is a tad bit sweet for me. There are just too many fruit flavors going on. This beer would go down very smoothly on a hot summer day or a relaxing day at the beach."
"O – Herbal throughout. Does an incredible job of hiding it’s booze at 8.5%."
"Drink- Pretty tasty little beer. Had good flavors and was pretty light at the same time. For a small bottle, ill come back to it."
"Overall its good. Not Duvel good, but IIRC its a hell of a lot dryer."
"""Bone dry"" indeed. Somewhat husky and abrasive as well. Very little residual sweetness. The golden fruits I'd expect from this style are fairly subdued and lack the smooth, airy quality I want from this BSPA."
"Overall, definitely one of the better Belgian Strong Pale Ales around. I would recommend this beer to anyone and suspect that I will be buying and drink many more."
"This brew pours a cloudy honey hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head and some nice clingy lacing,the smell is a mixture of aromas of pepperoni,avacadoes,barley wheat and herbal hops,it has a light-medium bodied nicely carbonated mouthfeel which allows the tastes of honeydew,mini-wheats,pepperoni and grapefruit all to combine nicely before being infused with a nice hit of herbal hoppy bitterness and overall an enjoyable ale that hides its ABV very well cheers."
"Overall, this is a very well done beer. Very spicy and it fills the mouth to an extreme. First ever beer from the Lost Abbey I think, and I like what they did with it."
"Overall this beer has some of my favorite characteristics for the style. I like the yeast and spice but when the green apple and pear fruit flavors are allowed to shine through and lend a hint of sweetness to the taste it works best for me. This beer hits on those counts. A bit of alcohol comes through in the taste but it's easy drinking for the most part. Definitely very enjoyable and refreshing for a beer with an ABV of 8.5%."
"Carbonation is way down from my first review, as there was barely any head, and virtually no prickly carbonation in the body. Much fruitier and sweeter than my original review. Still plenty of yeasty spiciness, and reminded me of a fiery hell when I first took a sip of this one. Bitterness is way down. Must've mellowed after sitting for two years."
"I've been sitting on this beer for a couple of months. With the fourth snowfall in as many weeks, I figured that it was time to pull out a special beer to celebrate such a special occasion. Cork was a little tough to pull out, so I was concerned about a yeasty pour, but this is actually relatively clear, with nice carbonation. Color is a pale golden yellow. Smells super fruity, with a pleasant, almost cherry aroma. There's light cereal in the background, too. Smells pretty damn good. No head retention, but then again I'm using a Chimay glass, so there's really none needed. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but there's a ton of flavor hitting the mouth at once. Trying to catalog the tastes is a fool's errand. There's a slight sour funkiness that starts, followed by by some surprising levels of spice. The spice recedes and there's this wonderful Belgian fruitiness in the middle of the beer, with some light citrus, melon, and pear notes bleeding through. Mild citrus hop character helps to usher in a bone dry finish. Simply wonderful, and it only gets better as you let the beer warm up. The high ABV is never really all that noticeable, and the light body with the dry finish means you want to drink a whole bunch of it ... even if you probably shouldn't. Very good and would easily make it into my usual rotation if I could find it more often around here."
"o - Overall a nice Belgian style pale ale. I loved the smell; the mix of cloves, Belgian yeast, and bananas was exactly what I like in a Belgian ale. While the taste was fine, it just had too much pepper and spice for me. I enjoyed it more as it warmed up, and it is something I would certainly give another shot to. My advice is to let this one warm up a little bit so more comes out in the taste."
"Very drinkable for 8.5% ABV"
"A bit raw, but a good representative for the style anyway."
"The ABV is really well hidden on this one, you don't taste it at all, but of course you do feel it as you work your way through the bottle. I'm a big fan of these C&C 375ml bottles for the bigger ABV beers."
"Pours a five+ finger thick, white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy light amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is tart fruit, flavor is sweet and tart fruit, smooth. Higher ABV is hidden. $10.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Overall impression: high alcohol and tasty, this is a great beer!"
"Pours out the bottle a golden belgian with a nice head and lace. Not much on the aroma front balanced but nothing stands out. Given I am not the biggest fan of belgians the taste of this brew is outstanding. The balance of flavor and alcohol content leaving your tongue with a nice little after taste that only make you want to drink more. Overall definitely one of the better strong belgians I've had."
"Mine was light on carbonation, and I consider that a plus for the style. Pure, clear straw yellow at first but plenty of sediment so cloudy later. Tons of bright fruit yet dry, some grass/hay and spice. Sweetness in the nose yet actual sweetness gobbled up by the yeast. Will pair well with food, especially cheese, like many in the Lost Abbey repertoire. Perfect for one beer with a meal. Not sessionable and I would never touch this after anything with serious hops. Share a bottle with a cheese plate."
"Aroma is not strong, but is fruity and a little malty with a nice crisp edge, slightly sweet and fairly inviting. It pours a hazy solar yellow with a very thick, white, persistent head that leaves some thick lacing. Flavor is malty and fruity, mainly pear with a little apple, a hint of honey and a subtle alcohol bite. Texture is very smooth, somewhat thick, and quite fizzy, leaving behind a nice tingle."
"D - It's drinkable considering the ABV but you obviously wouldn't look to this for refreshment. Overall its very tasty and finishing the bottle was no problem."
"Awesome wicked golden cloudy ale with all kinds of fruity esters in the flavor - Finishes dry and clean. One of my favorite Tripels (or whatever its trying to be) Little bitterness there wavering in the background, but in the end the dry beats the bitter or the sweet. Sweet!"
"D: I have really enjoyed this beer from start to finish and would not hesitate to seek it out again. Cheers."
"I have had other Lost Abbey stuff and have been impressed by what was done, but those never really paid homage to the ""Abbey"" like this one has. I was looking for it, I found it, and it was worth it. Experience the west coast of America bring you a true flavor from Belgium."
"D: I love a good Belgian Golden Strong and this one was good. It however was missing some carbonation characteristics relating to crispness of finish, head retention, and lacing that make it a notch lower than the stylistic examples. Good flavors that are balanced between spice and fruit. Will re-review after sampling it from a bottle with the appropriate glassware."
"Pours a very murky golden orange color with a medium white head that is very fluffy and hangs around for a bit. Aroma is EXTREMELY spicy! Probably the spiciest scents I've ever gotten in a beer. There are also hints of green apple and Belgian yeast, but the spice overpowers by a lot. Taste is initially lemon and green apples followed by tons of spice and pepper with hints of banana and a lot of yeasty flavors. There are also light bread flavors. Beer finishes with very boozy. Strong alcohol flavor...like vodka. Mouthfeel is nice, and clean...very crisp and full. Drinkability is fair...this is no Duvel, that's for sure!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours a cloudy golden-orange with almost brown tones in the deepest parts. There is a large, foamy, light head, approx 2"". The beer has citrus notes on the smell, with a hint of some spices to balance. The flavors are of very light citrus, with a blended spice tasting of coriander and nutmeg. Very smooth in mouth, and a crisp, light finish. The alcohol helps balance the sweet and spice flavors, and the spice follows through to the aftertaste. Almost peppery notes on the aftertaste, also. Very tasty, and very easy to drink. Kind of wishing I had grabbed a few more bottles of it while we were at the brewery."
"The mouthfeel is really dry, as the awesome label says. Nice on the palate. The drinkability isn't too high for me its just a little hard to put down too long. Nice beer overall."
"This one pours pale gold with a one inch head. Smells of apples and yeast, and tastes of apples, yeast, with a wee bit of sourness in there that was a little disappointing. Overall, the taste was a bit on the weak side, and the touch of sourness made this one slightly less than first rate, but still a pretty good beer."
"D: This was my least favorite LA brew to date, however, I'd like to give this one another go in the future just to see if my taste buds were just off this night."
"D-the huge soapy flavors and the assertive bitterness make this somewhat off putting. the flavors are all there but they don't seem to work that well together. it isn't bad, the malt body is still nicely done and the assertive hop finish is different just too soapy."
"Poured a hazy pale golden orange in color with yellow highlights that had a thick finger of head and left plenty of bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty fruity belgian yeast upfront alongside citrus, slight spice, apple esters, and mild hop notes. It also had a good malty presence. The taste was also pretty fruity from the belgian yeast with clove spice, apple, pear, and citrus accents. There was plenty of malts and a touch of underlying hops to cap off the flavor. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, spice, citrusy, and malty finish. It drank real good and really did some justice for the style. I've had this brew a few times know and each time has been solid without the LA carbonation issues."
"Mouth feel is really nice with a thicker tasting body yet lots of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden and I found the citrus rind a little overpowering which made it a little less drinkable."
"M/D - Crisp but full bodied. Very dry. Excellent BSPA."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with ample head; impressive adhesion, the lace defies gravity! Abundant carbonation observed. Aroma is very floral and the taste features mild estery banana notes with a definite hop presence. Mouth feel is somewhat astringent but drinkability is high."
"jd"
"Taste is of- well belgian yeast, not too malty, and hopish. Unfortunately, for me, the hop flavor tends to overpower the Belgian flavor. I think Raging Bitch does a much better job of balancing the two components. It is a fairly lighter bodied beer with lends itself to drinkability, though I can't really recommend it."
"Thanks to afatty for including an extra for me in his order of Lost Abbey beers. 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Hopus glass pours a nice bubbly, hazy dark yellow with a frothy pale, almost yellow head that takes its time dying down to a thin layer that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is loads of pale malts and spices such as coriander and lemon zest. Taste is an absolutely wonderful plethora of citrus hops, pale malts and spices all dancing together in perfect harmony on the tongue. Sweet fruits, pepper, clove and lemon all add a nice accent to an already complex brew. The beer is medium bodied with nice smooth carbonation. This is a great beer to wrap up a hot Summer day, one I would certainly love to have again."
"This is quite a drinkable beer. There is a lot of flavor here, and is a great beer to linger upon. Highly recommended."
"D- this is one tasty beer! One of the better I've had of the style and certainly top of the pile for americans. Paired wonderfully with a bacon wrapped fillet with blue cheese on top, savory corn pudding and broccoli rabe. Ahhh!"
"overall: this is a wow beer for me its just great! if you like Orval or Duvel you need to try this and it is worth trading for!"
"another nice beer from lost abbey."
"Taste, ugh, sweet alcohol overpowers. I thought this might be a little hoppy like Mischief. Its a little peppery, maybe plum. Getting clove in the mouthfeel of this. Ah, so glad I didn't buy a whole bottle and waited to check it out at the SDIBF. Finishes too 'hot' no pun intended. Can't recommend."
"D- Really a big-flavored beer; tastes wonderful with it takes a while to kick a bottle of this. Would probably be wonderful with some stinky, wash-rind cheeses."
"D - very good, nothing stands out but just very well balanced and easy to drink...ABV barely noticeable. really grew on me after the first 8oz or so."
"M/D - Medium body with tons of carbonation that finshes a bit on the dry side. Wonderful refreshing flavor makes it real easy to drink and no hint of alcohol warmth adds to the characteristic."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very different. I get some smoke, caramel and biscuit malts as well as wheat. The flavor is Belgian yeast, biscuit malt, wheat, honey, caramel and toffee. I didn't expect the caramel and toffee notes in this beer since it was yellow in color, but they are a welcome surprise. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is bone dry, and I dig it, seems spot on for the style."
"D: It's decent."
"D: Very drinkable for the style and for this beer in particular. Overall this was delish and I would buy it again in a second if they sold it in OR!"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable, dry, Belgian that has saison qualities to it. While I do want this again, I would sooner choose other Lost Abbey beers first. A very good, nice and fruity/funky beer."
"Very crisp on the tongue, with a nice but not overpowering nose. The yeast flavor was there, but also not overpowering, so you could still get a nice taste. The spices and light citrus combined came out well. Tomee did a great job on this one."
"Pretty drinkable for a begiun beer. I suppose."
"the huge clove and dry body make this beer a little less drinkable. still a good example of the style."
"D: A very good Belgium strong pale ale. Easy to drink but the alcohol will sneak up on you if you're not careful."
"The 8.5% is barely noticeable while drinking, but it creeps up on you. I felt it before I was midway through. Otherwise, this is light and crisp with a good dose of bitterness that makes this perfect year round."
"D - While the taste is pleasing, the alcohol is the only off putting piece. However, this is minor."
"I went back for one last pour and with all the sediment in the bottle, a lot of it made it's way into my glass. I get a big taste of old cheese now, which is a good thing for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very good tasting Belgian ale. Belgians beers are not my favorite style but this was a very good one."
"Review from notes taken 1/15"
"D - not bad. A bit too bitter for a belgian. I'm drinking it on it's own, so maybe with certain foods it could balance out."
"D: Very, very drinkable. This was my introduction to Lost Abbey and absolutely did not disappoint."
"I've come to expect a lot from the Lost Abbey beers, but this one really blew me away. The best beer I've had by them hands down."
"Overall - Another very good brew from Lost Abbey although nothing groundbreaking... definitely worth a try though..."
"75cl bottle purchased early this summer down in Orange County. Crystal clear maybe a touch darker shade of gold than Duvel. They didn't really hide the fact that they were basing Inferno on the original devil of beers himself, so excuse the flagrant comparisons. The head almost lackadaisically rose to the rim of my Duvel tulip but manages to stay there for a few minutes, leaving a plethora of lace in it's wake and remaining as a nice pad of white foam for the duration of the beer's stay in the glass. ample carbonation trails up from the bottom of the glass. The aroma leaves an initial impression of doughy malt and yeast, with pear, strawberry, lemon, and spicy hops adding subtle complexity. In the mouth, there is an initial fruity sweetness that is quickly taken over by spicy hops and bitter fruit peel. Cracked grain and honey also seem to add the to the sweet quality, though the finish dries out pretty well with hops and alcohol. The body is light with carbonation on the higher side, and a dry feel on the back of the tongue. I love Duvel, and this may not be spot on, but is just as enjoyable. Seems like people are expecting something fro this beer that it never promises in the first place. I mean, the style was Belgium's answer to the pilsener, for what it's worth."
"Drinkability was impressive. This is a clean, crisp, refreshing beer that would make for a perfect aperitif."
"D-A nice tribute to Duvel, certainly not as good, but then again nothing to drain pour."
"(D)- Incredibly smooth and balanced yet ridiculously complex that keeps you guessing. Its criminal to not consider this a sipper though due to how nice and complex this beer is. Fantastic stuff!"
"The taste is nice and light. There is sweet orangy start with a nice light hop finish. Pretty complex taste that sticks to your tongue. Nice mouthfeel and pretty easy to drink."
"I didn't really have any objection to this beer, but it didn't really do much for me either."
"This beer betrays the name bestowed upon it. Pours out clearly, very light and vibrant, with a citrus scent. However, It is not an inferno of taste, smell, or sight. A good Belgian, but not a great beer. The taste is fairly good, with a lot of background flavors. Lots of malt and hops, which is balanced out by the carbonation."
"D - Decently easy to drink for an 8.5%, but just a bit too sweet for me to make a session out of. Good stuff."
"Overall, a nice BSA. A little less than my favorite Belgian version, but nice indeed."
"Pretty damn drinkable with good carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden and came come up to bite you! I would grab this one again if I'm looking for an easy drinking Belgian golden ale."
"D - good, nothing too special here. a solid example of the style."
"Excellent drinkability in a great example of the style."
"The mouthfeel here is really amazing, and the beer looks great too. It just feels a bit lacking a bit in the flavor department, and I wish that the alcohol and aftertaste could be toned down a bit. Still, I think it is worth a try if you get the chance."
"Big thanks to cletus for the bottle!"
"Taste is lightly sweet to tart, lemony in the center, with spiciness coming in on the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is excellent."
"D: Complex flavors with an overall mellow vibe."
"Overall a solid beer. One that I'll be getting again!"
"It's controlled beer, easy to drink, hard to believe it's 8.5%, sneaks up on you. Instead of inferno is should be rogue as it silently takes you out when you think all is well."
"Drinkability is, again, fantastic. No hint of alcohol, dryness lends a refreshing quality, and the mouthfeel is lighter than expected, meaning this one slides right in effortlessly. Beautiful beer."
"The bad-ass infernal name, label imagery and text don't really match this nice, polite, clean ale, but this is no slouch or wimp of a beer either. Perhaps something of a more angelic persuasion would've been more fitting. No matter, this nonbeliever found Inferno Ale to be a delightful experience and a more-than-worthy tribute to real-deal Belgians of a similar kind."
"Even if it was supposedly brewed by the Devil, you'd swear Inferno Ale was a gift from the heavens. It is tasty, palatable and refreshing. My mouth waters at the thought of how this would fair with a number of my favourite dishes. Tomme Arthur will surely go down as one of the most talented and inspirational brewers even in an era that knows no lack of talented and inspirational brewers. I hope we see this one again."
"A fine beverage for just about any occasion. Thanks to WasTrinkenSie for a real nice one."
"Taste is pretty mild with a noticeable alcohol bite. Has a light and airy feel to it and the hops are nice and plentiful. Tastes like a finely crafted Belgian ale. Has a welcoming yeasty funk with the last few dregs swirled in there. It's a good beer that is true to the style, but didn't quite live up to my expectations for popping my Lost Abbey cherry."
"D- easy to finish and something i wish i would have picked up sooner. another success from lost abbey. something ill come back to."
"Highly recommended."
"Pours a cloudy straw/yellow with a ton of carbonation and a giant white foamy head that leaves fantastic lacing.I hardly ever give 5's for appearance,but this is a special beer. The smell is not as outstanding as the appearance. Some tart apple,pepper,lemon,and wheat are present,but it's not all that strong. The taste is crisp and refreshing with lemon,pepper,bread yeast,alcohol,tart fruit,and wheat. The m/f is light for a high octane brew and all the flavors mix well. All in all,a damn good beer that if you can find it,Try it."
"This was sent to me by Tomme Arthur directly (replacement for a flat bottle), and he was confident of its carbonation. BOY is this one carbonated. It's a damn shame their stuff is so inconsistent from beer to beer. But if they were all like this (that is, consistent and having the appropriate carbonation for the style), I'd be a damn happy customer."
"Inferno overall is a pretty solid BSPA. The nose and body could use a little work. Carbonation is a little low, but it is carbonated. No worries about that here. I like the flavor. I'd like a little more yeast and spice flavors, but their slightly weak nature doesn't hurt it too much. Lost Abbey did a more than respectable job with this one. Definitely worth checking out."
"D- Very easy to drink and a pleasure."
"D - Even with the ABV, easy to drink for sure."
"M: Surprisingly light body, given the smells I got from this beer. After all the spices & adjuncts I smelled, I expected a big heavy taste, but this is light, almost crisp."
"Tasted again recently and got a slightly more pilsner malt and much more pear aroma and flavor than previously. Adjusted the drinkability up a notch but other than that things are fairly similar. Still worth a shot."
"D: A very nice take on the style. The well hidden alcohol makes this beer one that can sneak up on you if you're not careful. Overall, a very nice pickup."
"Pours a cloudy yellow that looks just like grapefruit juice. Smells of beautiful funky wild yeast. First sip is funky and yeasty that is on the mellow side and not too over the top. There some grapefruit notes present but again...not over the top. A tad on the bready side. With a noticeable hop presence this puppy is easy to drink and a pleasure to boot."
"750ml bottle shared with psycohops. Poured into my tulip glass. Appears a cloudy pale yellow color with about two fingers of fluffy, tight bone colored head. The nose contains notes of black pepper, orange peel, spicy yeast, caramelized candi sugar, bread, and cola. Tastes of black pepper, sour/bitter lemon (like the drink mixer), orange, spicy yeast, really bready as it warms. Bone dry finish, moderate carbonation and medium bodied."
"Inferno Ale falls far short of Duvel, but then every other BSPA on the planet does as well. In the end, this is a semi-impressive ale from a brewery that produces far more hits than misses. If you have any interest in the style, it's also an easy recommendation."
"Having not had many Belgian strong pales, this one was pretty damn solid. It was well-constructed and flavorful enough to hold my interest for the whole bottle (yes, I finished the entire bottle myself). Given my limited exposure to quality Belgian ales, I'd rate this as a decent stab at the style, and a pretty tasty one at that!"
"Not a bad beer, but not really what I was expecting (not sure what i was expecting actually...)think I might give this one another chance."
"Decent, but Duvel is much, much better."
"Good, but not great. I'm missing some depth and complexity. Still worth a try."
"Very solid, I am definitely liking my first Lost Abbey Offering."
"Pours a cloudy amber/light orange, very nice colour, thick white head forms, quickly drops down to a thin ring and layer around the glass, a lot of lacing is stuck on the glass, nice pattern, great looking beer. Smell is nice, sweet and fruity, honey, very fruity, nice peachy aroma, honey and caramel, some candi sugar, apricots, toast, yeast and light spice, some floral hoppiness, not spectacular but enjoyable. Taste is similar, very sweet at first, honey and candi sugar, very fruity, floral, grapefruit tartness, apricots, wheat, quite dry in the finish, very tart fruitiness, touch of yeasty spice, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, , nice dry finish, some warmth from the alcohol but it is pretty well hidden. Quite a nice BSPA, great fruitiness and really dry in the fnish. Thanks Chris!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced and tasty. good stuff."
"Very drinkable and tasty Belgian Strong .. it was sold to me as a ""saison"" and I see how it'd be pitched that way. Good stuff."
"Pours a hazy orange with a frothy and disappearing off white head. Aroma is medium sweet, nicely spiced, yeasty and citric. Flavor is mild spice, yeasty, doughy malt and light alcohol. Finish is dry and very yeasty. lMedium to full bodied, a very enjoyable beer to share with a coupple friends."
"Thanks again Eric.. I really appreciate the super cool trade."
"D: So far this is the most impressive of the year-round LA beers that we've tried so far. Very nice."
"Very nicely done, would get this again."
"Tastes fantabulous. Excellent balance. Starts off saisony, very crisp and sweet with lots of flowers and lemon. This moves into a honey sweet middle that's lightly peppery and strongly, wonderfully alcoholic. Normally things would fizzle out after that, but here we move into a tremendous yeast profile that lingers long after the beer's been swallowed, sweet fruit and burny booze. The yeast tastes like a blend between west coast USA and straight-up Belgian and it really, really works."
"Pours a hazy yellow color body with a humongous craggy white head, very lasting. Extremely floral aroma. Sweet and Belgiany. Sweet spiciness present too, muted. Watery palate, some sweet spiciness. Some hotness present. A nice floral taste, but not a lot, more alcohol. Some alcohol in the nose as it warms up more."
"Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol hidden very well. Almost too easy to drink. This one is a winner."
"D: I had no issues polishing off a bottle but it is a bit telling..."
"I could almost guess they add fruit juice to this beer. It is just so juicy and full of complex layered fruit flavors. Very peachy in the mouth with nectarine as well ad a grapefruit with some alcohol burn in the chest. Some spice with great yeasty finish and a hop bitterness on the finish as well. A perfumey finish. Hell just a long complex interestig finish. Good carbonation and slightly creamy in the middle. Great beer here."
"D: Would definitely have again. I'm sorry it only comes in 750ml. Would love to have another 12oz or so to top off the bottle for the night."
"Smooth and even a little watery with a prickly mouth tingling carbonation, it matches well with the flavors, and overall theme of this fine ale."
"d: good"
"drinkability: fine"
"D: The ale is only 8.5%? It feels like an 11% behemoth at the midpoint. I was looking forward to this beer but walk away underwhelmed (and with a B+ rating, that is sayin' something)."
"D= I wanted to like this beer, and it was not bad by any means, it just left me not caring about it. Sort of a ""meh"" experience for me. I don't regret trying it and will do so again someday, but this time I was not very impressed."
"Light yellow body and lots of lasting white head, with lots of lace left in the glass. A funkly yeast that gives it a funky aroma. Medium mouthfeel, metallic taste. Kind of so-so for the brewer.I think this will become my next meat tenderizer. Thanks Dr. Jay."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D- easy."
"Overall, a nice Belgian. It's lighter and fruitier than expected, but the sweetness is offset well by the yeast. It is nice and drinkable."
"Pours clear gold with a puffy white head. Lemon, citrus, and spice in the nose. Fair amount of the same in the taste, but with honey and earthy farmhouse notes. Taverner made a great call with the Sangria-like flavor of this one. A bit too carbonated, but still enjoyable."
"This is an extremely drinkable Belgian pale that opened up nicely as it warmed. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly spiced, and hoppy in the finish."
"HV"
"Nice beer for certain, but not quite as complex as some."
"D: Lovely, very drinkable, one glass invites another; now where are my mussels and frites?"
"D- This is wonderful, light, and very drinkable. The ABV is not at all noticeable. While sipping I was really enjoying the complexity of the flavor with its different layers. The only complaint that I have is the mouthfeel could be much more smooth and yeasty. Good beer and would buy or trade for it again."
"Overall: This is a good beer. Nothing special, but a solid Lost Abbey beer."
"Pours a sunshiney amber golden sunshine amber, Only gets opaquer the deeper you get into this 750ml bottle. Good, spritzy one finger head that slowly recedes to a film o' foam, to nothing. Sporadic, small bubbles slowly make their way to the top of this bubbly brew. Yeasty nectarines and some soft, hoppy grass clippings make up the brunt of this brews nose. Dried citrus fruts in a bag as far as the taste goes. Nectarines, mandarin oranges, limes, and even some grapefruits. The finish is an herbal, grassy, yet slightly sugary hop. Pretty dry palate, a little sweetness, and more of a pronounced hop profile for a Belgian beer than I'm used to. Very easy to drink, cosidering the high abv."
"Drinkability and overall: A pretty decent beer. I liked this. The 8.5 ABV is surprising for a beer with this flavor and feel. I won't run out and get more, but if someone gave me some, I'd drink it."
"I would conclude that this is a bit too hoppy and a bit too carbonated than my favorite examples of the style. Nice but difficult to make it through 750 mils."
"Cheers"
"Cheers!"
"A: A touch of haze to the beer, a light straw color, a fair amount of cottony head - 4.50, S: Lots of zest and some spice, the Belgian yeast is very apparent, a dry crispness to the nose - 4.50, T: Quite hoppy and tart, some green apple to the beer, what I assume are noble hops, slightly earthy, this does a good job of masking the high alcohol which I can tell is there - 4.00, M: Quite light and smooth - 4.25, D: An excellent sample of the style - 4.25"
"Notes from 8/13/08"
"Drinkability: This is an excellent strong ale that has a soothing, refreshing taste and feel. Drink this while relaxing after work, while watching tv, during a meal (especially chicken or meat), or any time you choose. A beer this good has no limit on when to enjoy it. Get some now."
"D: Lost Abbey is an amazing brewery that is changing the shape of American brewing from a hop head and macro lager dominated arena to one heavy influenced by the Belgian and French brewing traditions. Every one of their beers deserves a tasting and sharing among friends."
"MF/D: Very smooth and lightly carbonated. It is very light for the 8.5% ABV tag. Could drink these all night before you knew what hit you."
"In the end, while not my favorite thing from Lost Abbey, it was definitely solid. I would have no issue with trying this one again any day. It seems like it makes a very nice addition to their regular lineup."
"Drinkability: If you like a hoppy Belgian, then you will enjoy this beer; to my palate, however, there are others in this series I prefer"
"D: A tasty beer...not quite to the level of a Damnation or Delirium Tremens, but a damn enjoyable brew. I wish the flavor were just a bit more overstated. They do avoid the over-hoppiness that Devotion seems to suffer from though, which is a bonus. Alcohol is enough to get a buzz, but doesn't really smack you in the face. Combined with the relative smoothness, this is a frighteningly drinkable beer. Lost Abbey rarely disappoints."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, and slightly smooth."
"Typical L.A. bottle, caged and corked, w/o freshness/vintage info...pours light yellowy apricot, cloudy, huge off white head, rocky cap, merainge, tons of lace, the whole nine! nice...fruity, yeasty, flavorful on the nostrils..yummy..tasty, fruity, complex, flavorful, thoroughly enjoyable, pineapple, candied apricots, vanilla, honey, lemon/lime initially, then more hoppy, some alcohol and gin notes floating around...love the style, the Port beers in general, so this one is a natural for me...wish I could find Port offerings closer then Massachusetts!"
"Overall a solid representatioin of style. Defenitely a decent introductory belgian. I would like some more light fruit flavor and a bit less pepperiness here, but overall a good beer. For some reason Lost abbey belgian pales/goldens kind of rub me slightly the wrong way. Mostly good, but something slightly off. Dont get me wrong tho, as this is good beer, and i would probably revisit it on occasion if LA would send us more than 4 styles! Good beer, and thanks again to my man Wetpaperbag."
"D: Not a spot on Duvel clone but kinda close and tasty nonetheless. Drinks pretty easy with minimal alcohol showing through."
"This is my first foray into Lost Abbey, although I have a couple more in the basement for a rainy day. Maybe it's just the stylish bomber, but I was expecting something a little more...radical. This is a solid beer, but not the hellion I was expecting."
"Good stuff..."
"It's good overall but maybe not as subtle as I would prefer. I definately need some cheese and crackers to take the edge off. And an ice pack to numb my sore hand."
"Great work from Lost Abbey. But as a drinker, I'll just stick to the real thing."
"Pours a cloudy gold in color. Nice frothy head forms on the pour. Smell is very floral and fruity. A little bit of spice. Taste is much more floral. There is a good amount of bitterness in the flavor as well. Decent and good mouthfeel. Very easy drinking. Don't notice the ABV at all."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, a descent shot at the style. This would go great with Thai, Sushi, & or Indian IMO"
"Quite a tasty beer and one of the better Lost Abbey beers. If you like a spicy and hoppy version of the style this is your beer."
"Drinkability - First Lost Abbey i've had, and thought this one was a little too straight forward. Expected something bigger that would pop in your mouth more. Not a bad entrance into this brewery, and hoping to try more of their offerings."
"Poured into a chalice. Cloudy peach gold colour with a thin layer of fine white bubbles that stuck around for a long time. Just a bit of lace. Very fruity aroma, yellow grapes, white wine, crackers, bread and yeast, cloves and a hint of lemon zest. Good balance. Bitterness was present throughout, but remains restrained. The fruity character so prominent in the aroma was pulled back a bit (and was more of the pear and apple variety), allowing the malt to add some smoothness and honey sweetness. Spice and alcohol appeared towards the end and lingered into the finish, along with light citrus. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation, some dryness (not bone dry like the label warned). Nice texture. This one's pretty drinkable, quite thirst quenching."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma consists of semi-sweet Belgian-style malt with some light alcohol but no fruity ester as I had expected. Taste is a mix between some sweet Belgian malt with some hint of alcoholic phenols but no signs or fruity yeast ester or floral hops notes. Full body with good carbonation and some alcohol showing. I can't say that this is bad but it is still somewhat short from Duvel."
"D: ABV very well hidden. Very light and refreshing with not-too-sweet fruit notes. Probably would pair better with stronger or spicier food than on its own. Sure, it's drinkable, but I would enjoy drinking several dozen other beers more."
"I think maybe it needs a food pairing instead of solo drinking."
"D: Put the 750 ml down with no problem."
"Drinkability is beyond exceptional. Balance. Duvel is the obvious inspiration for the this beer. I never tasted a beer that came as close to Duvel's complexity and perfect balance. Highly recommended."
"Inferno is very fine Belgian Strong from Tomme and the crew at Lost Abbey. While I wouldn't go out of my way to get this (it ain't miles better than the other classics of the style) if you see it you should certainly crack into one."
"D: A good BSPA, the flavour is tasty, though overall I found it kind of light to style, but still enjoyable - the actual content of the flavour profile makes it work. Another good one from Lost Abbey."
"The body is moderate to light moderate. Carbonation is light for style but ok. Overall disappointing. Some off notes with some really off blending tastes that don't work."
"Not what I would call a Belgian Strong Ale at all. Too much of a California Hops influence without a lot of complexity."
"D: Another excellent example from this brewery, although as always watch your intake as it doesn't take much to push sobriety."
"Another solid offering from Tommee, but coming up short at $14 per bottle."
"Really pretty straight forward. Nice notes of esters in the nose, some spice, light fruits, maybe a bit of candy or bubble gum but the hops really come through, not floral but rather stronger American hop notes of citrus. Nice tight fine carbonation with a lively head, good retention. Some bready malt notes that are overtaken by a combination of phenols and hop bitterness. Strong long lasting carbonation and a medium body are right in line and provide for good drinkability. There are many very solid beers in this style so it's a tough go. A good showing but not great."
"Notes: Not bad by any means, but if you're gonna do a clone, make it at least as good... and cheaper."
"A nice attempt at a Duvel clone, I really dug the prominant toasted malt character of this very much. Tasty and easy drinking for the size, I would revisit this again."
"Shouldn't session this but I definitely cod-great stuff."
"aside from the general rising prices today, there's nothing to complain about with this brew. It's a nice slightly hazy yellow belgian pale ale. flavor wise it comes across soft with light esters, grain and honey notes. It's delivers a kick but makes it a happy easy to accept kick. Worth a try."
"Really glad that i had the opportunity to consider it!"
"Pours a slightly fogged gold with a thin white head. Nose is dough and a very minimal yeasty funk. Flavor is smooth with a dough and citrus edge and a bit of an earthy bite on the backside, but the flavor doesn't stay that long really. What's there is good though. Feel has a full carbonation and a good liquid feel. This is a nice enough Belgian Pale Ale. Fairly easy to drink and unobtrusive. Best paired with food I think."
"Drinkability- I will be getting one of these again. Wonderful output from Port Brewing."
"Pours a hazy straw gold color with lots of frothy white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Smells of fruit, bread, spices, and light grass tones. Tastes of apples and pears up front followed by spices, honey, bread, and light barnyard yeastiness. Finishes with nice dry grass and citrus notes as well a hint of alcohol. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Smooth, bready with some spiciness and good fruit flavors. Just enough alcohol warmth. Not the best Belgian Pale Ale out there, but a pretty nice attempt that I won't mind drinking again."
"taste is grain, spice, lagerish, some citrus, finishes somewhat dry."
"This is a well-balanced Belgian that shows a good range of phenol-produced spice flavors. The appearance is a mostly clear gold with a short, white head and the aroma has a hint of bubblrgum that the flavor lacks. Otherwise the taste and smell share a slew of white and black pepper notes with a touch of clove. The beer finishes with a bit of herbal, slightly grapefruit hops. All in all, a tasty and spicy beer. Worth a try for something a little different."
"Drinkability isn't too bad, it's tasty and fairly digestible. Overall, I'm a little underwhelmed. But since it's more expensive and much less available then it's inspiration, there's really no need for me to bother with this again when I'm in the mood for such a beer. I also think it's a bit rougher then Duvel, and reminds me that I haven't had one of those in way too long."
"Overall, not as spectacular as I had envisioned. A decent take on the style but my wife ended up liking Inferno better than I did. Still, worth a try."
"thanks to psprings for the bottle"
"D- Easy to drink. I will have to get some more."
"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one-inch foamy white head with tiny ringlet craters embedded in the cap. Eventually settles into a thin, consistent skim with some webs of lacing that adhere as the volume of the brew diminishes. Scent of citrus, belgian yeast, pepper and spice. Taste is tart up-front with light fruity esters in the mix (perhaps pear and melon), a hint of candi sugar and a hops presence detectable at the finish. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that tingles throughout the mouth and a slightly tart finish that lingers between quaffs. Alcohol was well-hidden and there is a nice complexity to this offering."
"Thanks to Kempleton and gford217 for a bottle of this!"
"Pours a cloudy golden hue with a fluffy two finger head that quickly dies down to a thin layer. Swirling the glass leaves some nice webbing on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of spices, yeast, and pepper up front. Pear, apple, and grapes lightly tickle the nose as well. Some honey and hops can be detected too, nice smelling brew. Taste begins with sweet citrus quickly followed by white bread and honey. Midway some pale malts and dry hops emerge on the tongue with a touch of booze. Aftertaste is light and fruity with a good amount of grapes and banana leaving the mouth somewhat dry. Medium body with a soft feel to it. Carbonation is strong and plays well into this style of beer. Nothing about this beer is too over the top and that's what I like about it. The 8.5% abv is pretty difficult to find, so be careful with this one. Anoter chart topper for Lost Abbey, keep 'em comin'!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a pretty good initial head that ultimately fades to a thin ring. Smells quite fruity with tropical fruits, juicy and a bit sweet while maintaining a decent balance. Tastes quite nice. Smooth and even a bit waxy with some restrained fruitiness, some firm malt, a touch of sweetness and a bit of short, sharp bitterness that is pretty well integrated to the overall taste. Very smooth and even a touch soft in the mouth. Not at all too sweet. Very nice. Starts more like a tripel but mellows into a more Belgian pale taste as it opens up."
"Drinkability: Very tasty easy to drink beer. Great for the summer. The alcohol (8.5%) is very well hidden. The hops used are a little too long lasting in the finish and not my favorite varietal."
"Hmmm...hmmmm...What does this taste like?...Sweet?...Sour?...Bitter?...Tart? Wait, wait, let me try to convey the taste of this amazing renaissance man of beer. The Inferno Ale must just be the greatest, most diverse beer I have ever had. I keep taking sips from my tulip glass just to make sure I'm not going crazy. This beer really is sweet, sour, bitter, and tart at the same time. Wait a minute, I'm on sensory overload again. I apologize but I feel like the cop at the end of The Usual Suspects. I just can't get my head around this beer. There's definitely orange slice taste to this brew as well as hop attack. The cloudy color doesn't give you hints of what's about to enter your mouth. Most likely, you haven't tasted anything like this before; I don't mean just beer, I mean ANYTHING. The alcohol isn't too overpowering but you definitely know it's there like skeletons in your closet. Oh maybe I haven't tried enough beer yet and this is just like puppy love and what do I know? But this is as real as it gets from my perspective, I'll keep this one as one of the fondest memories I've ever had drinking."
"A very interesting beer, with one of the more complex flavor profiles I've come across. While very good, I have to say that there are other Lost Abbey beers I've liked more then this one."
"Much like other posts this was an above average beer but didn't wow me. Should be some further development as bottle fermintation takes place over the next couple years. Minerals, some roasted banana leaf, mild oil citrus. Weird to have a ""mineral"" taste as they make their own reverse osmosis water, and don't run that water over any type of stone or rock to allow the water to pick up minerals and flavor. Though this beer still expresses minerals? I do enjoy that flavor in this beer. Would buy again but only a couple for the next couple years. $9 locall I believe, so not terrible expensive."
"Yet another quality brew from Lost Abbey. I'm a big fan of the Duvel style Belgian Strong Pales and this is quite a good version. The fruitiness is all over the place and I dig it. Thanks again for the treat Bill!"
"One must learn to accept that Lost Abbey beers build up a lot of expectation. This one was not amazing, but overall I find it's a good Belgian Pale, and I would try it again..."
"Lost Abbey labels are really nice and the artwork on this is no exception. I heard this was similar to Duvel which I had for the first time two weeks ago. This is a nice golden straw color as the label states. The smell is very hard for me to describe but it is nice. This is easy to drink and I can see some similarities to Duvel but I think I like this better because it seems less carbonated. The only thing I don't like about this beer is the price. This seems more like an $8 beer (Red Barn and such) than an $11 beer."
"D: This is in my top 5 of favorite American crafted Belgian-style beers. Well crafted, I am ready to try more!"
"This is not my favorite Lost Abbey offering, although it is definitely worth a try. A good brew, but not necessarily my preference."
"Nice, I enjoyed it and am sure I will equally enjoy my next one."
"Golden color with a long lasting foam, but it doesn't have the fun mountainous shapes of Duvel. Nose doesn't offer a lot up, but has a light hint of fruitiness. Flavor is similar to Duvel, but doesn't have quite the authenticity or depth. A lot of light fruit flavors are present. I like it pretty well. Well made and a nice American Belgian style."
"Very refreshing, dangerously drinkable. A bit underrated. Glad I bought a few, as this appears to be a one time deal."
"I was pleased to see that another Lost Abbey beer has made its way to the East Coast. This was bought at Marty's Liquors in Newton today. I love the Dante esq looking artwork on the bottle. Just a side note; this was tasted, as recommended by some, alongside some Duvel, which apparently shares some of the same features. Pour in to a sniffer resulted in an orange/amber color, with a moderately large white head. Nose is based in fruit, with a bit of a cinnamon gum aroma. Must and alcohol, similar to a farmhouse ale in some ways, also show themselves in the nose. Taste is wonderfully floral, with spices all around. It transitions from sweet, to tart to dry, to slightly spicy within the span of a single sip. Body is full, but the alcohol is not particularly noticeable in the taste, very well hidden in fact. This one is easy to sip as well, but be careful, as it is a decently strong ale. Overall this is a very solid offering from The Lost Abbey. Not my favorite, but still great. For those that are wondering on the side by side tasting, Duvel won by a tiny amount. Inferno is more concentrated on complex flavor and aroma, whereas Duvel is all about mastering the feel and drinkability. I highly recommend putting the two down against each other, as it was a very fun experience."
"D: A very refreshing brew. Alcohol is hidden very well."
"D : Really good and another great beer from them that I wouldn't mind having again."
"this is a belgian-style pale, with emphasis on pale--the hops dominate the flavor, with little malt balance, missing that great fluffy floating head that i love so much"
"Orange Rind Wine with an eye opener. This princess pale is into biting and scratching. Crispy youth, sticky hat of a head, refreshing every last inch of my inebriated body. She's my Citrus honey bunny...hopping heavy. Royal, Imperial qualities, behind an innocent, surrendering appearance. Humble aromas and healthy, light skin mask a freaky nature. We may never meet again, we may indulge every day, but I will never be this beer's friend. Im gunna savor every last drop."
"Notes: A damn good Summer thirst-quencher, though it'll get you drunk pretty quickly if you're not careful. Bonus points for the awesome front and back labels - this is one seriously metal beer. Heavy metal, that is."
"Drinkability? Coming in at 8.5% it's a powerhouse of a brew. Fairly easy to drink (if you enjoy hoppy beers) but should be careful of how much you imbibe."
"The drinkability is amazing. I finished the entire bottle in about 30 minutes. A great strong pale for a 85 degree day. I will definitely be visiting Lost Abbey again!"
"Very good beer, though I feel the appearance and aroma are weak for a BSPA."
"Drinkability: Very high. I'd like to line this up against a few of my other favorites from this style and then update the reviews - Duvel, Fin du Monde, Brooklyn One and maybe Mathilda if I have a bottle left."
"For the alchohol content, this was extremely drinkable - I wonder how this would age."
"Drinkability: Another quality release from Lost Abbey."
"The alcohol isn't present as many had noted, but i do drink a lot of Belgian beers. Honestly this is a daily drinker type beer for me, i would age but i see no point. The beer was release in April, two months later i wonder rather it piked or did i just catch it late?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a average carbonation for the style. Aftertaste is of tongue smacking dryness with a slightly bitter twist to it. The alcohol, to me, isn't noticeable. This one is going down very easy on this warm afternoon. I don't think there's much hope for three I stashed in the cellar."
"Disappointing, considering all the hype that this place receives."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Bottom line: Excellent example of the style and it is one that I'd seek out again. Highly recommended!"
"Was hoping this was going to be released to the general public after seeing it offered in Michael Jackson's Rare Beer Club, very similar to Duvel and even better in some ways, like the hop profile more for sure, one of the better Belgian-style ales I have tasted lately, would definitely drink again, hope to see some in stores out here in the Inland Empire, recommended"
"Overall, nice drinking beer. Very light in the body, which surprised me. I guess you could say that ""the alcohol was hidden well."""
"D- Although this is not as clamored about as the other LA barrel-aged, or blends, or unique releases....this is a very solid beer that is a pleasure to drink."
"I must try this side-by-side with Duvel next time to see which one I prefer most. Cheers!"
