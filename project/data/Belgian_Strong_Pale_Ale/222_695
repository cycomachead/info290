Upon settling, there were nice lacings floating about.  The aroma gave spice and a hint of the tart fruit that would come in the sip.  The flavor was a neat and spicy up front (allowing the nose to influence). Across the palate there was a nuanced maltiness, so slight it wasn't biscuit but more sourdough bread - but this was a background note. There was an underlying tone of ""European"" less ""Belgian.""  It finished with a lovely tartness that at first seemed like a mild citrus but upon reflection was more like a apple or pear. The lager people would say ""crisp."" Some reviews mentioned some alcohol in the finish, but I did not sense that s being of note (even though it is an 8.5). Pretty big bubbles in the carbonation, which gave a nice complement to the crispness. Awfully refreshing for an 8.5 brew.","MisterGone","Mar 06, 2015"

I can absolutely understand how people could call this the best in the world, although I'm not quite there - tend to think I'm still looking.  It's beautiful yellow-orange with a fluffy head and clouds up just a tad at the end when the sediment/yeast makes it out on the last drop.  Nice citrus and floral on the nose, but the yeast really steals the show.  It's a sweet organic scent that I normally wouldn't call appealing, but this just seems different, like the mastermind behind a great symphony.  And the music that follows is special.  Bright, bubbly, and complex, but balanced in an uncanny way.  Didn't realize this was 8.5% until after I drank it, you'd never know.  Could very well be the best there is, but Belgium definitely is.","Foxybrau","Feb 23, 2015"

I never gave it the chance because I thought it would be significantly less refreshing and never was too keen on the bottle shape.  I could not be more incorrect.  Refreshing, carbonated and perfectly balanced into a magnificent ale that bursts with flavors.  The drinkability is phenomenal, and the alcohol is masked perfectly.  Pretty good price too, I will absolutely be picking up more of this when I run out.","Bisco42","Jan 16, 2015"

Wonderful nose of spicy Belgian yeast, banana, sweet fruit (pear with hints of orange) and subtle biscuit.  Light medium body, yet nice and slick.  Heavily carbonated with rich effervescent rushes throughout the profile. The flavor profile is of normal intensity, complex and balanced.  The 8.5% alcohol is perfectly hidden.  It begins with the fruit flavors, then flows into a light biscuit sweetness.  In the middle, an effervescent light hop bitterness emerges coupled with a light note of pepper.  The finish is rather clean, somewhat dry and a light bitterness lingers a bit over a blend of the previous flavors while notes of clove come to the forefront.  World Class and one of the highest scores I've ever given.","tillmac62","Oct 21, 2014"

The first sip feels heavily carbonated and one might be tempted to wonder what all the fuss is about. However, this beer is meant to be sipped slowly. After a while, as the carbonation settles and the beer warms up the taste becomes more pronounced. As you get to the bottom of the snifter glass you feel a poignant sadness that it is all about to end. The taste is so unique; it feels like you are drinking a white wine at times. The alcoholic content is high, yet the flavor is so clean and the taste so pure, I didn't even feel a buzz. (I mean this in a good way) it is a taste I will dream about and think about for a while.","Gajo74","Oct 07, 2014"

Appearance: a 750 ml bottle brings sophistication in simple; the tulip was unable to effect the imp in the bottle, but it should be because the glass is not the brand, with laser engraved (my mother said a pebble in the background would make the effect); abundant, fleeting foam to keep enough; citrus color, translucent. Aroma: It is not unpleasant, but simple, refers to a citrus. Taste: balanced, it seemed like a champagne beer, at first I did not feel the alcohol, but it rises quickly to noggin (inset). Anyway, I was happy to try this beer, but I can not pay more for it, value more when the hops are more pronounced (personal taste).","denisconrado","Sep 19, 2014"

APPEARANCE: light gold color with a bit of haze. large white head that persists for very long time. characteristic viscosity leading to belgian lacing. TASTE: faint fruity flavours mixed with a low sweet background. medium bitterness that lingers beyond a dry finish. some spicy alcohol notes. PALATE: medium-low body with high carbonation. some astringency is present as some alcohol warmth. OVERALL: a classic but now it seems with less overall quality.","titvs","Sep 19, 2014"

Smooth, goes down easy and just begs to have two or three per sitting. I wish I could stock this beer in my kegertor.","robertlovesbeer","Jul 27, 2014"
4.19,-1.6,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"As previously mentioned, the head on this beer is just beautiful, although for me it did not last as long as it seems to have for others. Pure white, fluffy, initially three fingers high but fading to one finger and then just a ring after a few minutes, although the carbonation was superb and lasted the entire time. The color of the beer is a rich golden orange in the glass. The nose on this beer is very nice and spicy, and hoppier than the flavor seems to be (until you get to the pleasant lingering tartness at the finish). This beer was challenging, in a good way, as it has so much going on. I found it much more enjoyable as it warmed a bit, since I think I served it a bit too cold initially. The flavor is yeasty and spicy, with some fruit but not too much sweetness, and a tangy bite in the finish. Would cheerfully have again...one of the best beers I have ever tried. Would highly recommend to anyone...am looking forward to my dark-beer-obsessed husband to try this golden ale and see how complex and rich a golden ale can be.","TheMcCollums","Jul 27, 2014"

OCCASION: NBA Draft Day 2014--Cavs take Wiggins and intend to keep him...APPEARANCE: two-tiered head--rocky, mountainous atop bubbly,, crystal white that occupies half the glass; slightly opaque golden body with a wellspring of bubbles centering the glass; lacing is appealing... AROMA: brilliant pilsner introduction; fragrant floral, perfumed hops; some suggestions of pepper...desirable... PALATE: quick, aggressively smooth with a solid, lingering finish--a bit dry and mouth-watering... TASTE: honey and hops are warming--nectar of the gods! a bit sweet, like a Riesling--but oh so rewarding... OVERALLL: only three sips are needed to bring the tingle, not unlike your team drafting first overall for the third time in four years; as its name suggests, sadistically drinkable, tempting with crisp, clean flavor, then punishing with cruel, powerful alcoholic hammers...the steep price--literally and figuratively--is unfortunately warranted.","dacrza1","Jul 02, 2014"

I figured I must be missing something if many beer experts including Michael Jackson consider this one of their favorite beers. I like many Belgian Ales and thought maybe my palette just wasn't developed enough to appreciate the subtle nuisances of this beer. Three years and over a thousand beers later I now appreciate a wide spectrum of styles and my palette has definitely advanced. Duvel however hasn't changed for me. I find that the high carbonation deters from my enjoyment, the high alcohol content which I usually find as a plus takes away from the taste. The appearance and mouthfeel are nothing special. Sometimes I feel that some beers get rated high because of the ""buzz"" over it. For example, I was at Russian River six weeks ago and had a Pliny the Elder. Good IPA not great. I've had many IPAs that are better! Again, all about the hype!","ELS","Apr 07, 2014"

As I sit here typing this conclusion, sipping the last few ounces, I'm metaphorically slapping myself in the face for putting this brew off for so long. You know you have something special on your hands when you're utterly dumbfounded by how good a brew is, regardless of the fact that it's a style you're not fond of. Duvel is the top of the line. It is the be-all-end-all Belgian strong pale ale. It is the gold standard in which every BSPA aspires to be. If you're looking for the definitive, look no further. Duvel is here to satisfy.","ThePaintedGrey","Feb 14, 2014"

I was hoping for something more ""Belgian""...i.e. a big hit of malt or hops or spicy yeast. Instead, I am left thinking that Duvel is the lager-drinker's Belgian ale. Not that this is bad. It's just that -to me-- Duvel is a bit ""dialed down"" for the international market. Again, just my opinion and this is not to say that I would not buy Duvel again, I would. Certainly recommended if you have not had it before.","BeerDocT","Jan 04, 2014"

Aroma offers some nice super balanced spiciness from the yeast, nice bright lemon rind, and some grassiness. Flavor follows suit. Mouthfeel was active and on the thinner side. Overall, a great beer. Not really a fan of too many golden ales, but am definitely a fan of this one. Such a well constructed beer.","denver10","Jan 04, 2014"

4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Had a bottle decanted into a genuine Duvel goblet at 1410 Bier Haus in Calgary. This classic world-renowned brew pours a lemon-drop bright yellow with the oft-cited bright white head that forms a nigh-impenetrable cap that bottlenecks right at the rim of the glass and protrudes a bit over said rim without spilling. A majestic sight. Exudes an aroma of fruity yeast and very clean pale malt, some green apple and Saaz hop perfume. Palate is quite crisp and dry but with some residual sugars and a lot of fruit: Apples, pears, and a little banana perhaps, white sugar, candied ginger, citrus pith and white pepper spice against a backdrop of floral perfumed lemon cake. A large bloom of alcohol along with noticeable Saaz hops. Finish is bitter with a little cork. Clean, without noticeably funky flavors. Hard to argue that this isn't the perfect example of the style ... It is the original after all and the intent to to yield something clean and crisp: Perhaps less complex in terms of yeast-derived spicy ester profile than some similar beers.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 08, 2013"

I always take a spoon (or a finger) and try some of the froth before drinking. The texture is buttery, slightly acidic and with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. While high in alcoholic content, the floral aromas and delicate flavors cloud the ABV.....so much that trouble can ensue if one is not careful. Slight notes of apple and stronger notes of orange emerge, especially if this classic is not served too cold. Where I live, Costco often has it in stock for only $10.","Wobbly","Oct 25, 2013"
4.53,6.3,4.75,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is a great golden ale, it can be expensive and is usually cheaper to buy as a 4 pack ($14)of 11.2 floz each (1.3l Total) instead of in the 750ml - 3l bottles, which range from $12-$115. It is a beer you want to take your time to enjoy as it boasts a 8.5 abv. As well it has a very fine fruity flavor to it, the amout of foam that comes with this drink is something I didn't care for, but the taste made up for it. I would recommend that you drink this Belgian ale in the proper glassware, in other words use a chalice glass it will brining out the fruit like smell that Duvel has and add to the experience.","_--TAD--_","Oct 25, 2013"

I'm not the biggest fan of Belgian ales, but this along w/ a few of the Unibroue Belgians are outstanding representation of the styles. I really like the malt in this brew, and the dark fruit isn't as noticeable in this one, which is good. I think the dark fruit in some Belgians can make the beer wine-like, which I do not care for. Overall, an excellent Belgian Strong that I look forward to sampling again.","stella77artois","Sep 17, 2013"

Bottle conditioned and as this is the 3rd of the 3, all have been slightly different -this the most funky of the bunch. Pours dark gold, thick head fades fairly quickly. Aroma has a slightly stale moldy essence. There is a twang to it, like budweiser with corriander dryhopped. And that is exactly it -an upscale, and expensive bud that has gone bad. I dont mind a little skunk in a green bottle lager, but this was intentional and went horribly wrong. They tried to ""high end"" this and screwed up when it could have been a decent (and drinkable) mile golden ale. Like a homebrew experiment that failed. Never again.","Curtis","Jul 06, 2013"

4.51,5.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Fruits engage the palate and the sour makes the mouth water. The light grain malt sways and bends across the tongue for a feeling that is light and refreshing. The champagne bubbles tickle you and the dry finish is complimentary. There is a touch more alcohol than you might at first realize and that is ticklish too and makes you smile as it warms you. The pear comes out more and the grainy malt starts fluffy but then deepens slightly to remind you of a still life painting with fruit and bread and cheese. This is a work of art. Radiant and pleasing to the senses. Captivating.","utopiajane","Jun 17, 2013"

4.28,0.5,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a very good example of the style, I've had more than of a few of this style and this beer seems to do the best job at showing what this style is really about and all the aspects of it seems to be balanced nicely. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, not filling, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, it would be nice to drink a few of these during the summer, but the price prevents me from doing so. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was and the appearance was also very good. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it's a very high quality beer, but I still don't think it's worth the price, that's the only downfall with this beer. I would buy this beer again, but it wouldn't be often because of it's price, this would have to be a once in a while beer. I recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales, it's a very good and true example of the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I had some higher expectations for this beer since it's highly regarded and it met my expectations nicely and I think this beer gets all the respect it deserves. It made for a good fist impression and I will be on the look out for some different Duvel beers, great job guys. So far there is no doubt that is my favorite Belgian Strong Pale Ale.","StoutHunter","Apr 30, 2013"

The head retains for most of the life of the glass of beer and leaves streaks of fine lacing all over the glass. The light penetration is pretty good, though there is a little haze from the pour. The nose on this beer is phenomenal and by far the highlight of the beer. There is hoards of bright fruit notes and esters that seem to jump out of the glass. At first you are hit with lots of ripe banana peel and candied sugar drops. There is a good spicy hop aroma that lingers along as well. As the beer warms a little and you give it a nice swirm, bright and fresh lemons come out as well. The malt is present too with a little soft bready smell as well. The 8.5% alcohol is nowhere on the nose. The taste is also quite good with fresh fruit, especially golden raisins, dates, and a touch of maybe some cherries as well. I tend to think of the cherry flavor in sour beers, but this is more of the sweet side of the cherry flavor. The hops are present, earthy and spicy, very much like a noble hopped beer. The mouthfeel was a little overly-dry, almost like something produced from a champagne yeast (though I have no clue if it is used in this brew), but otherwise has great body to it. The alcohol, at 8.5% is impressively well hidden. I never even got any sort of burn from it. Overall, this beer is fantastically well done. The only detriment I found was the dryness which I thought was a little over the top. Nonetheless, it was overall an exceptional beer.","estlinska","Apr 17, 2013"

Has a citrus smell and is a refreshing pale yellow to amber colour. Taste reminds me of an English ale as there's a slight hoppy bitterness as well as banana notes. There's also a smoky deeper notes reminiscent of whiskey. Effervescent refreshing mouth feel, that makes for a surprisingly easy drink, goes down like a regular beer so be warned!","beercansandwich","Apr 16, 2013"

A constant flow of carbonation bubbles feed a head that persists forever and making pouring 12 oz into a pint glass impossible in one attempt. The aroma on this is quite unique. Apple cider and pears along with a bready yeasty aroma are quite inviting. Bits of pepper and spice round out the nose quite well. The flavor is crisp and just a hint of sugary sweet with a heavy does of apple and light fruits. Light hints of pepper and other yeast derived flavors balance this quite nicely. Light to medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet almost tart and bubbly mouthfeel. This is a unique and wonderful beer, how come I am just trying this now?","johnnnniee","Jan 11, 2013"

Plunge a little deeper and there's a delicious green apple note that is more than welcomed. Other citrusy notes combine perfectly with the yeast and create a miasma of flavor. Mouthfeel is slick, wet, and infinitely refreshing all the way through the finish. This reputation is well-deserved.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

However in the taste department I found this to be rather lacking. For me its was almost entirely yeast with very little malt. I would have enjoyed a more complex flavor. The feel was very smooth and 8.5% alcohol wasn't noticeable at all.","Theheroguy","Oct 08, 2012"

The aroma of Belgian yeast, alcohol, and a touch of ripe fruit. Opens with yeast, grassy hops, and a pleasant accent of alcohol, a touch of juicy ripe fruit midpalate, and a crisp, clean finish. Adundant effervescent carbonation, however still smooth with just the right touch of creaminess. This brew is the standard for Belgian strong pale ales. A triumph.","chanokokoro","Jul 24, 2012"

4.68,9.9,5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy yellow with a three finger fluffy white head that kept expanding for minutes after the pour. Truly a gorgeous beer. Scents of barnyard funk, sour notes, lemon zest, cirtus, and very slight bit of banana. A complex nose, predicting the flavor to come, and being quite appealing on it's own. Taste is complex, with flavors of pilnser malt, citrus, fruitiness, graininess, moderate hop bitterness, spiciness and a bit of malt sweetness. The finish is dry as is the aftertaste. There is also a flavor in the after taste that reminds me of burnt marshmallows. There is a lot going on in the flavor, it's quite complex and combines in an excellent way. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A good, easy to drink and refreshing mouthfeel, hiding the ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent beer. It has a complex nose and flavor, it looks fantastic, it has a wonderful, fluffy head and an excellent mouthfeel. I enjoy it now far more than I did a year ago when I first tried it. Duvel is truly a world class beer and well worth drinking.","Auraan","Jul 14, 2012"

4.31,1.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a hazy straw color with a mountainous, craggy white head. The aroma smells mildly of apple, pear, and trace amounts of hops. The massive head tempers only slightly as you drink, maintaining itself like a champ. The first thing I notice upon tasting is the intense carbonation, whose prickliness near singes the tongue (though not in a bad way). The flavor is sweet and juicy up front, similar to the aroma, while some bitterness presents on the back end. There is an almost honey-like sweetness that melds with the apple and pear notes. A strong sense of apple peel becomes increasingly evident as it warms, and a slight spiciness begins to manifest in the finish. Hops are tastefully integrated, just enough to lend some balance and complexity. As the session continues, alcohol becomes more present in the aroma, though not so much on the palate, which is impressive for the ABV. Swaths of lacing cling to the glass as the beer recedes. This is a crisp and refreshing brew indeed, and not short on flavor. Hard to find fault here in any regard, and pretty much the grandest head you'll find in a beer. A real winner.","MaximalC","May 28, 2012"

Some peppery clove smells come through with some subtle fruit notes.. The taste is dominated by the yeast no one unique flavor come out of the yeast, but some spice and malt in there as well. This is a medium bodied beer, which adds to the beer, nice blend of all elements. This is the best aspect, every flavor seems to be in just the right proportion to every other flavor.

The head retains fairly well, leaving less than a finger of head atop the beer and plenty of lacing on the glass. There's a strong aroma of fruity yeast, spices, and light malts. The flavor is very bold, but it does follow the smell. The yeast and malt flavors come together very well with the spiciness and the hops. There is some apple flavor as well. It's a very pleasing flavor and the sweet and bitter flavors balance extremely well. The alcohol is covered very well by all the flavors. The body is light and the carbonation is abundant. The finish is crisp and dry. This is very easy to drink for a beer that is 8.5% ABV. Overall, this is an excellent beer that every one exploring beer should consume at least once.","acevenom","Apr 19, 2012"

Constant, needlepoint beading that doesn’t let up. The beer smells just wonderfully bright and clean, fresh. All kinds of inviting esters and clove. Some light pepper and fruit, crisp sweet grain. The taste is equally impressive. Just the right touch of spice to complement everything found in the nose. The Belgian yeast really comes to the forefront - the pinnacle of the beer I think. It’s perfectly carbonated with a nice dry, slightly spicy finish. This beer is, overall, nearly without flaw.","yamar68","Mar 13, 2012"

The mouthfeel was almost like drinking a soda. Fizzling sensation throughout the whole drink but somehow it works out. Very well balanced belgian ale.. i want more!!","intensify","Mar 10, 2012"

4.36,2.3,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip, best by 12/24/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, pear, bready grain, grass, pepper, coriander, and yeast spices. Nice and clean aromas with good strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, biscuit, light tart grains, pepper, grass, coriander, herb, clove, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; with some lingering notes of light fruit, pepper, bready grains, and yeast spices for a bit. Great flavor balance, with a good amount of complexity. Medium body with high carbonation; and extremely smooth drinking for the level of alcohol with the prickly carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden, which is surprising for 8.5%. Overall this is just a fantastic Belgian strong pale. Great balance, complexity, and smooth drinking; and also has the best glass in the beer world.","superspak","Feb 24, 2012"

As I cruise up and down the aisles, i'm always telling myself, ""I can always get Duvel..."" I'm a sucker for Belgian strong pale ales, and this is the one that turned me onto them. The head on this beer is thick enough to support a dime. Sometimes, I get a bit of a sour scent that comes off of it, but other than that, this beer is damn near flawless. Amazing floral mix in the taste that incorporates lots of hops with a mix of fruit such as citrusy gold. Pour this into a tulip glass if you have one, but even a pilsner will do... anything that will lead the head expand and release all of its magic.","shigg85","Feb 10, 2012"

I cleaned the glass and poured from one of the bottles (the freshness date was indiscernible to due lack of ink and rubbing) to the Duvel tulip. The beer pours a huge 3 finger white head with excellent retention and lacing. The head slowly fades. Beer is a perfectly clear and bright straw color. Excellent appearance. The aroma is that of a crisp fruity character: pear, mild banana, apple. Hints of spicy hops. Very nice. The flavor is even more impressive with such complex character and ultimate balance. Again light fruity character as found in the nose with pairs perfectly with a tart bready flavor. Mild bitterness works very well with the citrus tart. Full bodied and crisp and clean. Overall, a supreme beer, instantly one of my favorites. Highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","Jan 27, 2012"

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into huge Duvel tulip glass. Pours a straw yellow, with 4 inches of fluffy, white head that lingers the entire beer. Lacing every where. Smell is clove, banana, q breadyness, and a hint of spicy hops. Taste is all that, more powerful then the smell, clove dominates, but in a pleasant way. Body is nice, not thin or thick, easy drinking for abv. I think it is a good amount of carbonation for the style. I am not a huge fan of Belgians, but this is very pleasant. I am coming around to the style, still a work in progress.","SawDog505","Nov 10, 2011"

4.9,15,5,5,5,5,4.5,"330ml into a Duvel tulip...it's hard to call this anything other than the perfect beer. You don't even realize it has alcohol in it. The head is massive on top of a clean golden body. I take care to pour it to the point where Duvel recommends, so that there is an even divide between head and body at the Duvel logo. Lacing is excellent. Deep clean funk in the nose. Balanced like a tightrope walker. Tastes soo clean. It's not the beer with the most depth ever, but I have to give it a 5 for sheer excellence. Mouthfeel is unreal. So much energy. Perfect. It only gets a 4.5 overall because it's quite expensive in these parts--a 4 pack for $16. However, if you haven't had Duvel, you should immediately try it. Regardless of the quantity this beer is produced in, you can see that the brewers keep quality at the top of their priorities.","chicagoabbot","Nov 01, 2011"

4.27,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Aroma is the quintessential Belgian yeast, with malted grains and spices. Flavour is well balanced from start to finish. For me the Belgian yeast dominates, but there's a lot going on between the initial malt & bready sweetness to the pleasantly dry & crisp finish. Alcohol warmth is present, but 8.5% ABV is surprisingly subtle.","hopsolutely","Oct 13, 2011"
4.29,0.7,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle (with ""best by"" dating) into a pint glass. I thought I was being careful but the pour must have been too fast as it foamed into a head at least half the glass. The head was very light and fluffy as was the lacing. The color was very pale blonde. The nose lent notes of malt and bready goodness with a hint of pepper and clove. The taste was complex with clove, grass, pepper, and resin. There was a trace of alcohol, but nothing way out front that grabs. Mouthfeel was light-bodied with greater than average carbonation. A brew that lives up to its reputation...well worth the time to find it and price to buy it.","maleman","Oct 11, 2011"
4.16,-2.3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"This seems to be the epitome of the style, but all in all - nothing spectacular for me (personal taste). Easily downed the 25oz bottle & hides the alcohol really well. Picked up at Total Wine & More for $8.99, might do again someday.","hoptualBrew","Oct 10, 2011"
4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- There are a handful of beers that I consider true benchmarks of their style, and Duvel is one of them.

4.41,3.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is beautiful, through and through. Bright golden with a rich head - an impressive example of head retention. Natural, spritzy carbonation forms at the nucleation point in the base of the glass. The aroma offers subtle earth tones, light fruit, and a hint of spice. A medium, but surprisingly quaffable mouthfeel for the ABV is both inviting and alluring. A dry finish leaves you thirsty for more.","AlphaFiend1","Oct 06, 2011"
4.25,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy pale golden colour, 2 fingers sticky white head, fluffy lots of lacing left on the glass. Smell is yeasty with notes of grass, lemon citrus, green apple, sweet candy like notes, moderately hoppy, good malty backbone with faint alcohol notes. Taste is yeasty with notes of lemon rind, green apple, lightly sweet, grassy hop, mild to moderate bitterness, minimal alcohol in finish, malt is there as well. Aggressive prickly carbonation, med to full body, solid weight. Without a doubt one of my favourites, easy drinking and full of flavour, complex without going over the top, well balanced and enjoyable.","peensteen","Oct 04, 2011"

4.26,0,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall (4): A fantastic looking beer, lacing on the tulip looks top-notch the whole way through. The clean, dry, crisp taste coupled with the carbonated mouthfeel and the warming of the alcohol combines for a beautifully crated Belgian Pale. The bottle fermentation is reflected in the smell which carries into the taste undertones. Well rounded.","tonyf55","Sep 28, 2011"

4.33,1.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The lively carbonation and balanced flavor profile make this beer extremely drinkable in spite of its 8.5% ABV--perhaps dangerously so!

This seems like a great beer for pairing with a meal.","pettis","Sep 11, 2011"
3.93,-7.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall: Very unique belgian beer, can't really say I've had something quite like this before. The Duvel brewery did a good job brewing a beer which has so many different flavors which compliments each other, somewhat like a flavor bouncing effect.","hoobaga","Sep 10, 2011"

4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I'm not 100%, but I think this tasted different when I had it in Ireland. Not sure if shipment has to do with a slight difference (it shouldn't with 8.5% ABV).

4.36,2.3,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is deceivingly drinkable. The body is light, crisp, refreshing, and easily swallowed. The carbonation is extremely fizzy but does not seem to adversely effect the taste at all.","output01x","Sep 07, 2011"
4.56,7,5,4,4.5,5,5,"D: This is another Belgian mainstay I'd never had before. It's also an excellent beer, but it's a bit more pilsnery than I was expecting for the style, at least in terms of its apparent body and hoppiness. Definitely a unique and memorable brew. This is stunningly drinkable, balanced, and refined for such a hefty offering.","Clydesdale","Sep 04, 2011"
3.46,-18.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O - If I was stocking up at a specialist beer store, this is not something that I would choose - I've had quite a few beers that I've enoyed far more. That said, it is definitely above average and still a very enjoyable beer. The fact that I can buy it at my local supermarket (which is not the fact with Rochefort 10, for example) means that I will undoubtedly be purchasing it on a semi-regular basis.","mrkipling","Sep 04, 2011"

4.33,1.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is just a delicious and thirst quenching Ale. The 8.5% ABV is not at all noticeable. A very refined and balanced Ale that reminds me of a fine Champagne. It seems at its best at about 45 to 50 degrees. This is not a “big” Belgium Ale and if you are looking for a very intense experience you should look elsewhere. I have overheard some negative comments about this Ale but I feel that it is exactly what it should be, not every Belgium can or should be a Triple. If you have not tried this please do so with an open mind and you will be rewarded with a very pleasant experience.

Very good, this is way better than I remembered the last (and only) time I had it a few years ago, but I was just starting on Belgiums then. Excellent beer, I'm glad I made this purchase.","DavidST","Jun 29, 2011"
4.04,-5.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Obviously it’s good, it’s a well balanced Belgian style beer with a satisfying flavor, but it’s a little lighter than I expected. It’s everyone else’s fault, really, since everybody said it was one of the best beers out there and set my expectations way too high. I still like it a lot, but it fell below my expectations just a tiny, tiny bit.","TheBeerAlmanac","Jun 28, 2011"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Overall - I'm absolutely in AWE...you MUST try this incredible ale! I am now questioning all of my previous high ratings, by comparison this would get 6's or 7's. I've never seen lacing like this, the color is very close to a Witbier and is the ""weekest"" attribute of this beer, the flavor and complex harmony is unlike anything I've ever tasted before, and the mouthfeel is so wonderful, smooth, drinkable and inviting. This beer is downright dangerous in a fantrastic way - I could drink this every night - I will buy this quite often from now on. It is fairly expensive, but absolutely worth every penny - I LOVE this beer, pure Pefection, Period.","blackcompg","Jun 27, 2011"

I poured 22 ounces of water to the rim of the glass, but it was a perfect fit for the 11.2 ounces of golden sunshine and the pillowy, white clouds of foam. The lacing was artful and distinct. The smell was bready and spicy ... I was expecting a bitter taste resembling a lager, but was surprised by a crisp, complex taste. I was pretty much all about thick Russian Imperial Stouts a few, cold months ago, but I'm trying new styles and finding them to be more refreshing as the weather warms up. A very memorable brew that I will surely be revisiting soon.","marchoftheclouds","Jun 16, 2011"

Big Belgiany aroma that at first reminds me of pineapple. Smells semi-sweet, almost like a bread dough. Carbonation translates to a very fizzy mouthfeel that isn't unpleasant. Taste is of lemon grass with some spicy hop character in the background. Malt profile is deftly handled with the beer sliding more to the bready side of the spectrum. Taste finishes with a light sourness and is very dry. There's a little bit of alcohol warmth the more you drink it, but that's certainly welcome for the style.

Very good looking lace with lots of clinging power. The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart, but don't let the color fool you, this is some fine beer, not a light beer. Smell is a bouquet of savory fragrances: apple, spices, pepper, and sweet malt. Flavor is what a beer should taste like; clean tastes of apple, spices, sweet malt, and just the right amount of citrus. Very creamy and full feeling in my mouth as I savor every taste. Warning: Drinking the complete 750ml bottle at one setting will put a real hurt on you. I had no idea by the flavor that this beer was hiding a mule kick.

I'd argue this is the benchmark model, as there's incredible balance here. Having had aged versions, I prefer the fresh version much more for drinkability.

Very smooth and creamy taste that combines well with notes of ripened fruit, yeast, and a touch of citrus.

Pours a huge, billowing lacey, white-as-the -driven-snow head that must be properly poured into it's own glass, or the closest equivalent.Spicey, fragrant, floral, angelic. Pours clear and golden like a lager or a pils, but is far from. Letting the yeast in with the pour gives an extra amber/ orange. Taste: the yeast is very prominent on the tongue, along with a pepper spiciness, citrus, decent malt levels, and crisp bitterness. Alcohol is slightly noticable. Mouthfeel: super crisp at the start and finish, and the finish is slightly dry.

The clove and banana are not overwhelming, which happens a lot with Belgian pales and triples. The lemon gives a bit of tartness, and the earthy, Belgian yeast flavors make this one delicious treat.

Almost too amazing as I poured slowly into a tilted pint glass, but had to wait after 6 oz poured as the head was already 3 to 4 fingers thick and near the top of the glass. The appearance was slightly murky somewhere between a pilsner and a wheat. The flavor was good, not great, and the high alcohol content was well disguised. For the high price tag, I was expecting a little more spectacular beer, but its still a decent beer worth a sampling. It is very drinkable and if I weren't such a lightweight, I could probably have a 2nd or 3rd..however 1 is enough for me to feel it.","bubseymour","Dec 13, 2010"

There is really no reason not to drink Duvel more often if one does not. The pour on this beer is perfect! The beer is a bright sunshine yellow with goldenrod highlights and is capped by billowy, finely held-together pearly white head that sticks and stays forever. Duvel has a nice fruity aroma with notes of spicy yeast and toasted malt. The beer has good flavors of apples skin, juicy asian pear, a little pepper spice and a nicely dry finish. The beer is highly carbonated and does a light spritzy dance on your tongue.

A yeasty fragrance strikes the nose, followed by a mild funky scent, but not off putting. It finishes with a light to medium grassy scent. A bread and cracked grain flavor comes through at the front of each taste. Then it blends to a yeasty twang, then moving to a grassy and earthy bitterness. A watery feel, with cleansing sensation of carbonation, it then finishes with a strong dryness that seems last forever on the palate. Another beer that is the standard for its style and does not disappoint.

Tons of carbonation and bitterness derived from Styrian Golding hops lend dry finish with bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body seems lighter due to effervescent texture and crispiness. One might say that Duvel is a style of its own, but in terms of Belgian golden strong ale it does a poor job. Fruity esters are somehow indecisive and lacking any citrus notes, spicy and peppery phenolic to subdued (at least in the aroma section). Duvel was created as a response to the growing popularity of Czech pilsners and their German counterparts that ravished across Europe at the time.

It pours a golden color with a head so foamy it looks like clouds dancing on a field of golden sand. Bubbles rise from the bottom to the top until the end.

Damn impressive. The nose is of pale malt sweetness and spicy flavors from the yeast, and it's very good but it's not quite worthy of a perfect score. Each sip leads off with some juicy sweetness, apples and pears. A flash of white pepper-led spicy flavors follows, before closing with an aggressive hop bite. Served cold Duvel is quite crisp, but as it warms up the mouthfeel becomes a bit more chewy and lets the various flavors linger around a little bit longer. Either way, it's delicious, and the high yet creamy carbonation ties everything together nicely. Every part of this beer fits together and integrated itself so nicely that Duvel is a pleasure to drink, my biggest challenge was keeping some in the glass long enough to type up this review.","axeman9182","Jul 05, 2010"

Poured from a 330ml bottle into, what else, a Duvel tulip, the glass adds a wonderful effect to the beer allowing it to showcase its four finger head and the tornado bubble gimmick doesn't hurt either.

It was fantastically smooth and clean finishing. If it didn't have that odd twinge to the taste it would have received a five. The label says it is good for another two years, I don't know.

Aroma of spice from the yeast, tiny hint of hops and light fruit, maybe apples. The taste - it's almost impossible to describe the relative complexity (for such a light beer), but of course, I'll try. Peppery sweetness initially, it mellows in the middle to a yeasty fruity balance, and finishes a little dryer than one would expect with the perfect amount of hop bitterness and flavor.

There's a nice ring of foam that manages to stick around after most of the head dissipates. Aroma is of fruit (apple/pear), spice and yeast. Taste is so clean... again, there's a touch of pear, followed by pepper and a light touch of grain and some sweetness. Alcohol and/or medicinal notes peek through. Mouthfeel is crisp, lively and pretty light on the palate. Drinkability is exceptional - it's almost impossible to put the glass down.

It is of white color and leaves blankets of thick lacing. I have never seen one centimeter lacing before this beer. Smell is mostly Belgian yeast and breadiness to me. A good amount of citrus, probably from hops comes through in the nose also. The standard dark fruits gets into the mix too. Taste is a great balance of flavors. I get a lot of yeast/breadiness. The dark fruit and belgian typical spices are nice. There is a citrus peel hoppy bitterness aspect that I really like. These are greatly balanced to almost perfection. A really nice laid-back belgian strong pale. Moderate body and carbonation suit the flavor balance well. The beer coats the tongue with the citrus peel bitterness. A tiny bit of warmth feels good also. I could session this and the 8.5% ABV is hidden amazingly. This is definitely one of the better Belgian beers I have had. The price is a bit much for me right now but I understand why it is that way. The citrus bitterness might get to me after a few of these, good beer worth trying.","cbutova","Mar 17, 2010"

Everything from the sturdy bottle, to the well made duvel tulip, to the carbonation & clarity of the beer, and to the amazing taste has been well thought out and executed. One of my favorite aspects of this is the appearance of the beer, which isn't at all indicative of the flavors contained therein. Tasting provides flavors of Belgian pilsner malt, the Saaz hops, and the unique tart/pear-like flavor that comes from the yeast strain used. Just a hint of alcohol lets you know that this is a serious beer, but is so well blended that it is hardly noticeable. Completely refreshing, could be had at any time of the year. Definitely a must try if you haven't ever picked this one up.","Prostman81","Mar 17, 2010"

The nose is floral hops mingled with bready malt and yeast with light spices poking through. On the tongue you get an extremely well balanced beer. Bready malt, banana, yeasty, sweet, light spices poking at the tongue, all while the hops whisper sweet nothings to your uvula. This effervescent beer is deceptively drinkable for 8.5%.

Large fluff/foamy brilliant white head that didnt last all that long but looked great. Was hard for me to get the aroma, light fruit, grape? Tasted slight alchohol, white grapes, like a good champagne to me. Lots of carbonation and light feel that gets slighty heavier and warming and dry at the end. I tend to compare this too delirium tremens, very similar however crisper and less fruit flavor going on here. I feel like you could pour this as an alternative to a good champagne and most wouldnt know the difference. Definitely a drinkable beer but the ABV would keep me having only a few spaced out. Ill most likely get the proper duvel glassware and get this again.","BeerMasterD","Jan 29, 2010"

Just a hint of alcohol and maybe some grain. Had a fruit taste. Maybe apples or pears. Also tasted slightly sweet. Good all around balance. Not bitter by any means. It didnt have any type of aftertaste at all. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I think it would make a good session beer. But you would have to be carfull. Lots of alcohol.

So, let it sit for at least 3 days before drinking, and don't pour the yeast into your glass unless you know you like it.

Duvel has a very nice head, that is just as impressive as its color. The head doesn't stay too long, or too short. Nice lacing occurs, and leaves behind a spiraling foam covered glass edges. A taste of hops, strong flavor, with notes of citrus. The citrus element helps to create a smooth drink, with a crisp and refreshing finish, that lingers a grateful amount of flavor. Carbonated just right, which adds to its crisp taste, without taking away from the overall beer. This beer, has a good amount of AVB, so this really does hit you if you let it it. Also, this is a great beer to have in a Belgian Tulip glass, or in a bottle, but preferably from a glass. Duvel is also great on tap, or course, what beer isn't good on tap.

Tastes quite dry with hops up front and a medley of fruit undertones that fade in as it warms in your mouth. Crisp apple and pear, as well as some wine-like notes that are enhanced by the alcoholic warmth. Nice dry finish and a pleasant lingering bitterness on the tongue. Crisp and probably too drinkable for this high of an ABV. It is obvious why this beer has so many imitators.","zoso1967","Jan 07, 2010"
3.79,-11,5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"11.2 oz bottle. Pours very light golden, with the infamous Duvel towering white head. Sediment floats about in a strange vapor-like form. Just the head by itself is more complex than most beers, sits on top the whole time, slowly getting all awesome and chunky looking and leaving good lacing. Smell is strong of yeast, lemon, pear. Not a fan of the pilsner malt used, I'm not really a fan of pils in general and gives it the scent a bit of a macro vibe. Tartness hits your mouth right away followed by many tastes, peppery Belgian yeast, apple, white grape, warming alcohol finish. Definitely alot of complexity here. Pretty good mouthfeel, but I have to knock it down to a 3.5. There is a little too much carbonation and alcohol presence for me, but I suppose that is understandable for the style. Feels very heavy too with a very dry finish. I like the complexity and I can understand why people love this beer, maybe I'm not a huge fan of the style.

Duvel has a champange-like richness to it that the carbonation enhances into by making it creamy and frothy.

The smell was of grains and yeast funk with most of the intricacies in the yeast funk. The grain was plain, somewhat bland in both aroma and in taste giving a vague note of frutiness. It seemed a tad like wine and it seemed as if I could taste some green grapes in their with the yeast funk that reminded me of a very very laid back lambic.

Duvel has an attractive, thick and creamy head. The flavor is rich yet the beer itself, by my estimation, is relatively light. (The alcohol is hidden but it hits you. Hard.)

The 8.5% is not a big deal with this beer as other Belgian beers can be. Do not get the strong alchohol taste that other Belgian beers have. That is what sets it a part from others.

Powdery pilsener malts, some light sugary smells, but not a very intense sweetness. A very faint earthy spiciness from the noble hops. The taste comes across first with some nice pleasant pilsener malt. Then the noble hops kick in, with some minty, almost peppery spice with a nice earthy finish. There's a nice struggle between sweetness and dryness in the finish, and I enjoyed the battle. Very nice, right on, could maybe play more to some more raisiny, bready malts, but still a standard for taste I'd say. The carbonation is sharp on the tongue, which is kind of normal for a BSPA. The beer itself is kind of right on too, not too heavy/thick, or too light/thin. Good. The drinkability is good too.

4.36,2.3,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Stubby Belgian bottle; best by 05/2010. Brewed with Flemish water, French pilsner malt, Scottish yeast and Czech hops. Boiled for 1.5 hours, fermented with ale yeast, lagered for 3-4 weeks at 27° F, bottle-conditioned warm for 10 days, then cold-conditioned for six weeks at 41° F before leaving the brewery. Whew! This brew pours a bright, crystal-clear gold, with lots of beads of carbonation and three inches of beautiful head. I can tease the foam two-fingers above the rim of the glass, and it is as dense as meringue at the top, with fluffy froth below. There is a bit of haze at the end of the pour, and a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Smells sweetish, with subtle esters and traces of noble hops. It's a bit muted at first, but as it warms, it opens up and becomes more aromatic. The flavor has sweet pilsner malts that interplay with fruity alcohol and esters, lots of warming alcohol, flashes of spicy Saaz, and notes of banana and spice. Becomes more and more Belgian toward the end, with lingering hops and malt. Medium-light on the palate, nearly creamy, with a medium finish. Definitely a unique brew; each sip begins and ends like a pilsner, sandwiching spicy/fruity Belgian notes in the middle, making me want to call it a Belgian imperial pilsner. A one-of-a-kind beer that is in a class all its own. Definitely worth revisiting.","mmmbeer","Mar 11, 2009"

Pours light golden, almost champagne colored, with tons of soapy head that fills the glass easily with a careful pour. The sides of the glass are covered in lacing from the head and a string of bubbles rises non stop around the glass. As I poured it I was strangely reminded of Busch beer in the scent. Upon letting it sit I get more banana like scents. Taste is surprisingly mellow with the same banana flavor as I got in the smell and Belgian yeasts. To me this tastes like a watered down tripel in a good way. Very similar in flavor to many of the tripels I've had lately but much smoother and more balanced. I've been slowly backing away from Belgian styles lately but this one makes me want more. A perfect example of a Belgian strong pale. Mouthfeel is a little tangy on the tongue and dry as you drink it but makes you want more as soon as you set the glass down. I have to say this is very drinkable for being 8.5 abv.

Citrus, wheat, malts and light spices were all evident; this is how I expect a true Belgian to smell. There was nothing overpowering, just welcoming. The mouth feel was beyond exceptional, very crisp with excellent carbonation, initial sweetness followed by a slightly bitter, yet satisfying finish. Perfect balance of flavors that tasted much like the nose. This beer is extremely drinkable. The only reason I give it a 4 is because of the alcohol content.

Head was very long lasting with a lot of sticky lacing. A wonderful spicy aroma that can be picked up from a distance. The flavor follows where the aroma has led. The spice is the most noticeable, but is not overpowering. The secondary flavor is the unique yeast. A crisp, full body that leaves no aftertaste.

The first thing that the aroma brings to mind is yeast that gives off a nice fruit aroma, banana, apples and slight citrus. Also spicy smells waft out which are nice mixed with the hop aroma, Saaz? The flavor comes across as sweet at first from the malts then breaks to a mix of fruit (apple and/or pear) and spicy pepper. At the end the hop aroma identified in the nose comes out on the pallet and mixes extremely nicely with the carbonation levels. The 8.5% alcohol is so well hidden that even as it warms I am not really picking it up, just dynamic flavors that play together so well. Overall this is a fantastic brew, clearly the best Belgium strong pale I have had, though I have not had many.

Brilliant quite clear orange in color, with orange peel and coriander up-front, and a pretty significant alcohol aftertaste. Having tasted Duvel in the corked cage, 330ml and on cask, I must advocate for the big bottle, the bottle conditioning sets it apart from its brethren. For anyone looking towards gaining an appreciation for Belgium's weighty contribution to the world of brewing, this beer is an absolute must.

Medium-bodied, with the firmness to appear denser and larger. The ginger, clove more evident here, teams up nicely with the lemon, grapefruit citrus. The carbonation nudges more than pushes. Apple, apricot, cherry fruit, more snap than juice. Allusion to honey, grain to granola flavors. While well-paced, there's also a creaminess to absorb any bumps in the road.

Tons of bubbles really attack your throat. Light and hoppy, heavy and smooth at the same time. You can find yourself drinking this quite easily, but also you can feel that this beer is no joke and certainly has some substance to it and has a bit of alcohol backbone. This is one of the first Belgian beers I have ever had, and will always be one of the best.

There are large and small bubbles that pile atop one another and take ages to settle away. The smell is all Belgian. It's earthy and spicy and perfectly blended with the alcohol.

It smells great as well. A fair bit of alcohol in the nose. Whats truly exceptional about the beer is its mouthfeel and drinkability. at 8.5% it really is a devil, and the alcohol is hidden so well that it will put you under the table if you choose to session it. Its perfectly carbonated and even sweet on the tongue, and leaves just a slight crispy finish coupled with enough alcohol to make you want to dive right back in.

I kind of felt as thought I was drinking a cocktail. it also could have something to do with the temperature at which it was served, but I did warm it with my hands and had the same feelings about it. In the mouth it has crazy carbonation which I didn't mind at all. Its quite comparable to a brut champagne in my mind.

At 8.5% you can definitely taste the alcohol, so this one's a sipper, but that makes savoring it all the better. Some spicy and citrusy notes from the yeast are complimented by a solid bitterness. Other reviewers have commented on how Duvel tastes almost like a wine or champagne, and I'd have to agree with them-- hard to describe, you've got to try it to know what we're talking about (maybe the acidity?).

Citrus and other light fruits are again present in the taste, but the hops come forward to add some bitterness. The sweetness is still rather overstated. Some spice, and big alcohol. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. Not really a fan of this one at all; the ever-present sweet pear taste combined with the alcohol just aren't appealing. I've had this many, many times; it was a cheap nachtwinkel beer in BE that did the job.

I'd say this could be a white wine substitute. Substantial enough to complement a pizza or an Italian sausage or could very well be paired with some fish or grilled chicken. Swirling the bottle and adding yeast gives it a whole new level of complexity and added cloudiness to the glass. The alcohol will catch up to you so if you bought a 750 mL like I did, please enjoy it with a special someone. As the temperature increases, so does complexity and detectability of the alcohol.

4.55,6.8,5,5,4,4.5,5,"As belgian strong ales go, this one is very different than one would suspect. The normal flavors many associate with Belgian strong ales are not as prominent. Bannana/bubblegum tones from the wheat and yeast, candy-like fruity sugars,etc. This is not La Fin Du Monde or a Trappist beer. The malt flavor is more toward the pilsner or pale lager taste spectrum. That being said, it's really drinkable and I really liked the black pepper spiciness. And trust me, It is way more complex than most pilsner/pale lagers. It just looks beautiful in a glass with a crystal-clear pale golden color and a huge foamy white head. There's a good amount of bitterness and complexity but the sweetness you'd normally get in such a high ABV is just not there. I'd love to try a beer that is similar to Duvel in taste.

Nonetheless, there is perhaps one style that identifies a nation more than others. This to me is it. It also has its own goblet. Gabe at Two Brothers seemed to be on a mission to educate us late one evening and started opening various Belgians. Pale yellow and slightly hazy in the glass, the noticeable thing is the head like a meringue that lasts the entire time: such fine structure and density; amateurs beware when pouring. Aromatic and raisiny aroma. Excellent slightly sweet aromatic palate but with complexity and biscuit, yeasty earthy components. Savour and enjoy slowly.

4.61,8.2,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pretty exceptional in the glass this beer is bright clear yellow gold with a huge frothy head the volume of which is almost equal to the volume of the beer. The smell is dominated by lemon and pepper, delicate hoppy spice and ripe summer fruit. The taste is upfront peppery spice, some due to hops but a good deal of it is from the alcohol. Incredibly brash and right out in your face just under the pepper is a fair amount of sweet pale malt along with a lemony tart kick with a bit of yeast ester as well. This beer feels very lively in the mouth clean yet drying with a near stinging peppery bite that invites another sip almost slightly harsh but in a good way. Overall this is quite good definitely a style defining beer and world class by all accounts. A good choice to have on hand at all times for special occasions.","fank2788","Jan 23, 2008"

Lively mouthfeel and ample carbonation during the duration. Finish was crisp and clean with a bit of citrus that lingers in the mouth. Very refreshing, but deceptively so given the 8.5% abv.

You can definitely pick up the sugar content in this, though it's not immediately apparent. In a way, it reminded me of a lager or pilsener. This had a medium range carbonation, giving it a good mouthfeel. This is a drinkable beer, though I'm not as enthusiastic as others on it.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light yet it has a slightly creamy texture. Drinkability for this high of an ABV is simply outstanding. Only the effect of the alcohol will slow you down because it is well hidden in the taste. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. By far the best Belgian that I have had yet.

The aroma is so intricate and complex that it is hard to describe... somewhat fruity with a smell of bananas... Taste is equally complex with a nice, pepperish sting to it... The mouthfeel is good, somewhat acidic... and due to the hefty alcohol percentage, wouldn't want to down too many of these bad boys in one night... a distinct alcohol taste is definitely present, and the beer contains a white-wine character...

Though its taste was decidedly pale ale, it was somewhat sweeter than most pale ales I've encountered. It finished very nicely, with a very slight hoppy aftertaste that I enjoyed. I was very impressed with it overall. It wasn't a beer of which I would have several in a row, but it was a brew I can easily enjoy by itself or with another immediately afterward.

This is an excellent example of a BSPA (my favorite style) and one I will purchase again and again. The ABV is almost undetectable and this is one that's complexity will have you sipping and sipping again.","PittBeerGirl","Sep 12, 2007"

I decided to have a go for the football weekend and shared a bottle with my brother. Perfect as always. With all the other descriptions on flavors I'll pass and just note that once again I find the easy to get (for me) and in my backyard is damn good.

5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended.","Maracuja","Sep 01, 2007"

I often use it as a reference when reviewing other beers, and I think it exemplifies what a fine golden ale can be. Everything progresses naturally from pour to last sip, and creates a total sensory experience that must be experienced to believe. Also, this beer is incredibly available. I have found this beer at most stores I've been to, from ABC to several local liquor stores. If they don't have it, request it.

High carbonation and an almost creamy feel to it. This might be the best beer I've every had so I dont have too many words to describe it other than that.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sharply effervescent with a dry quality.

Forms a volcano-like plateau in the middle and leaves huge, chunky lacing on the glass. Smells of pale malts, bread, (saaz?) hops, white pepper, and yeasty, spicy phenols. Flavor starts off with bright maltiness; bringing lots of bread and honey. There is some crisp apple in the middle. Finishes abundantly spicy: spicy alcohol, spicy phenols, and spicy (and grassy) hops. Finishes dry with a nice finishing bitterness.

Poured into a snifter from a 11.2 oz. bottle, which took almost 10 minutes to pour, due to the huge head it created. The beer poured a clear almost white color, settling to a light gold in the glass. Huge thick creamy white head, that very slowly dissipated, with thick spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is slightly fruity. The flavor is not as complex as expected, but still interesting. Fruity flavor, I'm assuming from the yeast, along with a slight hop presence. Light mouthfeel, along with a not-so-smooth finish. The beer had a slight hop-harshness at the end, but still this is a very drinkable Belgian. I can see why it is so popular.

The color was golden, very pale, and clear in the glass. The smell was sweet and alcoholic, it reminded me of La Fin du Monde, though the flavor was not as strong.

I poured this beer into a chalice of no speciality and half the damn thing was thick white cream. My face was in this beer before I could even reach the actual liquid through the head! Gotta love that, and on the two other pours the head stayed, even after sitting in the sun for a good 10 minutes. Thats damn good. The smell is like a hefe suprisingly, a little acidic though. The taste is like a hefe with balls, or like the Chimay White, but a little toned down. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but hey, its a pale beer, what do you want? The drinkability takes a huge hit after the first chalice-full, it just brings the alcohol out a little too heavily for how light the beer seems, so it plays tricks on you.

Bright white in color. Smells kinda like a tripel with light spicy hops and winey, light fruity smells. Also somewhat phenolic. Taste the crisp and light spicy hop profile and the sweeter pale malts. Lighter mouthfeel and extremely bubbly. Slightly drying with a pleasant bitterness. Laces the glass from the highest point of the head all the way down.

The meringue-like head, eventually, settled and after two pours the bottle was empty. Clumps of foam stuck to the glass as the head rescinded into the golden liquid. Appearance was slightly hazy from the yeast, and very effervescent. I guess that's why the bottle made an audible ""pop"" when I opened it. Aroma was malty, sugary sweet with peppery hop notes and lightly phenolic. Taste was on the sweet side as well, but there was enough bitterness for balance. Malty, yeasty, and the alcohol was barely noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and amply bosomed, er I mean carbonated. Drinkability was very good.

A very aromatic scent, floral and fruity, quite welcoming. The taste is rich in flavor, fruity, slightly hop-y, and strong in the alcohol region.

Touches of yeast, bready, clove, some bananas, spices. It starts off rather sweet and evolves into a very tart and semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but feels very light, champagne-like carbonation - tons of tiny little bubbles. This beer, in many ways, does remind me of a fine glass of champagne.

Pours a huge fluffy white head that takes forever to disipate. It took a couple of minutes, close to 3-5, for me to pour all the beer into my glass. It smelled strongly of Belgian yeast with a nice amount of malts. The taste followed the taste with a fruity yeasty taste with the sweet malts but left my palate with a semi dry body that was suprising for such a thin body. I was expecting to be extremely dry but it had just a bit of the residual sugar build up on my tounge. It was a nice beer for a hot day, which it was 94F with a heat index of over 108F. I would buy this again on a hot day but by no means is it my favorite Belgian.","cproioi","Aug 01, 2006"

A tough beer to pour, it says ""pour unhurriedly"" right on the bottle and they mean it! You have to lay your glass nearly sideways and pour very slowly when starting to pour to avoid a huge head build up. Taste is good, and clean, with a little bite at the finish. Tastes fairly simliar to a pinsler except with loads and loads of flavor. A hint of fruit, and maybe a breath of peach are present too. I would like to try again!","btighe428","Jul 31, 2006"

As always this is a beautiful pour, golden clear with a head that filled the glass out. The head takes a minute to settle and the smell is of spicey hops topped back with a malt ester wind that carries the idea of alcohol. The glass is starting to be laced as I take the first sip. Truly an artful construction of a golden ale with high ester yeast. Slightly fruity and sweet with a spice zing from the hops and alcohol make a play on the tongue.

I was lucky enough to get a free Duvel glass and it really seems to make a difference with this beer. At 8.5% and $12.00 for a 4-pack, this is a ""special occasion"" drink.

Poured (appropriately enough) into a Duvel glass slowly, to form a huge white stucky head that faded into chunks of foam as it faded. Coloration was similar to what champaigne looks like, very lush looking. In the nose were some light fruity apple flavors, a touch of mild earthiness, pears, overall extremely clean. Flavors detected included spicy pepper in the beginning, fruit in the middle, and alcohol hitting you right at the end. Duvel is one crisp beer, and by crisp I mean that it is pretty big on the carbonation. This one seems to turn to foam straight away when sipping, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I could see myself drinking a few of these and liking it more with each sip. I was never truly impressed with this beer until I gave it a fair chance, and began to appreciate the vast amount of complexities it has to offer. A superb beer.","jamie2dope","May 23, 2006"

Tons of bubbles rise to the top, especially a pillar of carbonation in the middle where the stem meets the bottom of the glass. Aroma is very sweet with hints of fruit. Taste is surprisingly dry considering the aroma. There is some initial sweetness followed by a dry, white wine type of bitterness. There is a sharp, spicy bite of yeast, hops, and alcohol in the swallow, but nothing overwhelming. Medium mouthfeel that tingles on the tongue from all the carbonation. All in all, pretty good stuff!! Not quite on the level of say, Delerium Tremens, but not a bad 2nd choice, either. Well worth the price.","CJfromPhilly","Apr 01, 2006"

Forms a dense head that fills the glass, then settles to hills of foam that retain very well and leave a thin sticky film on the glass. Abundance of tiny carbonation bubbles racing to the top. Heavy belgian phenolic aroma like bananas and lemons, with a mild medicinal note. Noble hops and a pale malt background round out the nose. Whiff of ester as it warms. First sip is sweet pale malt, with zesty citrus and light fruity phenols gently washing over the palate. Mild yeast bite in the aftertaste, with a snap of well-attentuated alcohol that is subdued by a faint hop bitterness for a nearly perfect balance of flavor. The carbonation is high, but not overdone; the light/medium body and results in a lively yet extra smooth mouthfeel. The phenols linger in the finish but fade and the drinkability remains high considering the ABV. Nearly perfect execution of style, very sexy.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 31, 2006"

This is hands down the most beautiful looking beer I have ever seen. Straw colored with the most breathtaking stormcloud of white towering foam. If poured correctly you should have roughly half beer and half head in your glass. The head retention is pretty amazing and the lacing extensive. Really a site to behold. The smell is hay, pepper, and lemon zest. Taste is light, crisp at first. Taste of rich spices like coriander and pepper, a little lemon, and some nice buttery malts. Aftertaste is that wonderful spice flavor followed by a nice glowing warming sensation in your belly and body. This must be what it feels like to give your spirit a bath. Alcohol feeling is present and strong, but not so abundant in the taste. Still a quaffer and a sipper...take her real easy. Drinkability suffers slightly because of the high alcohol.

Theres a chaotic vortex of bubbles erupting from the bottom of my glass sustaining this mammoth head. As the head collapses, it leaves behind a meringue-like cratered head. Almost looks like some forgotten water-carved desert valley in AZ. As I drink this beer, the head collapses and leaves big awkward clumps of head hanging out on the surface. The color of the beer is soft honey. Truly one of the most visually entertaining beers I can ever imagine drinking. The smell consists of tangerines and plumbs, an enticing spicy yeast and what I can only describe as dark brown lake water. These smells are magnificently intertwined with each other that make this really unique. Tastes surprisingly bland compared to the smell, but far from bad. Im getting some very dry grapefruit rind, black pepper and fruity orange jello with a medicinal, dry yeast finish. If I allow some air to stand trapped in my mouth, I pick up strawberries. I must add that this is the most prominent spicy yeast flavor Ive had with out it being too dry. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a lot of unobtrusive carbonation that disappears when I swallow.

Smells really good, candy sweet and dry yeasty notes intermingle and caress my anxiously awaiting olfactory sensors. Taste is dryer, with just a bare hint of sweetness laced with dry champagne. The yeastiness noted in the nose is subdued, in part due to the carbonation coming alive and foaming on the tongue just as you begin being able to taste it. Hops finish up almost resinously bitter, but in balance with such a light malt profile. With a light body and that carbonation that sparks to a rolling boil in your mouth, the beer is pretty refreshing, and hides its 8.5% to a degree.

Smell and taste are sugary sweet, with traces or Belgian spices and spicy herbal hops. Taste is nice, but there's a strong alcohol kick to it that doesn't seem to belong in this beer, and I have no beef in general with a little alcohol kick. And maybe a little overly sweet.

Floral aroma greets my eager nostrils and fills them fresh cut apples, herbs, bitter lemons, some grass, and a little brash alcohol. Taste begins deceptively mellow - one sly devil of a brew. Smooth bready malts take the lead before being outshined by strong spices and some herbs. Yeast is noticeable and transitions into clovey bananas before giving up to warming alcohol.

At 8.5% alc. it can really pack a punch, but try serving it instead of wine (it does come in a 750ml bottle) at your next dinner party and you may just be surprised at the reaction you get.

You could guzzle these down and be caught totally unaware by the alcohol which remains completely undetectable in taste or smell.

A stream of champagne bubbles rise from the bottom, a testament to the carbonation of the bottle conditioned beer. I detect characters form the yeast in the nose. A doughy hint followed by apples, pears. There is a hint of citrus and just a touch of spice (pepper). The flavor has more of the spiciness up front followed quickly by more of the apple/pear character and topped by grapefruit and orange.

This beer is almost indescribable. It seduces you with fruity and spicy aromas and flavors, yet every drink begs another, until the 4 pack that you bought is gone. And, of course you're incapacitated on the floor from the 8.5 ABV. Think of a heavy bodied beer, how it tastes/feels, then somehow make it as easy to drink as iced tea.

Poured into a large sniffter, this beer appears to be clear. It's a golden honey, clear colour. But no, that's an optical illusion. It appears clear, but it's actually quite cloudy. I couldn't see through the glass like I thought I could. Large, puffy, five finger head that ever so slowly settles down to three. Lace abounds the glass like etched artwork. I wonder, how can this look any better? Simply put, it can't. Such a delicate aroma. Spices, peppers, sweet and pale malts, juicy apples, ripe pears, and an almost juicy hop bitterness. Tastes just as good as it smells. Starts out with a bready maltiness, mingled with a pepper and spice taste that tingles the tongue. Middle is very fruity. Dry apples, pears, and just a touch of sourness. Citrus maybe? Leaves with a spicy bitterness, with still a bit of sweet and juicy fruit. Damn, what a mouthfeel. Smooth, thick and creamy. Excellent drinkability. Can be savoured and quaffed. An excellent thirst quencher as well. A beer worthy of respect.

Huge, thick feathery down lacing along the glass. Scent is sugar and spice and everything nice. Well, just spice and sweetness wafting forth. Taste is a bomb of spiciness and bitternessa dn finishing off slightly bitter with a warm sweetness and ending with the hops. I have to mark down mouthfeel only because the bubbles are occasionally intrusive. They fill the mouth and you really have to fight them to taste the beer and then it's over and you have the nicest hops and spice coating your tongue... I really could drink this all night.

The head gradually collapses into a rocky cavernous landscape with chunks of lace strewn about the glass. The second fill of the glass the body was much murkier. The aroma had hints of apple with a spice and yeast notes present as well. The spice was the main contributor to the smell as this warmed to room temp. A bit of malt sweetness is the first thing you taste before the spice comes in and sticks around though the finish. This has a very clean and crisp taste that has a strong bready and yeasty presence. Mouthfeel on this is medium to full with a very filling quality about it even when you take a small sip.

4.62,8.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Luxurious ultra-foamy aspirin white head forms quickly, remaining until the first sip, after which it slowly puts on a magnificent churning, foaming show, until it reaches a good 3 or 4 centimetres. Upon my word, the head is like a living thing. Untouched, it remains like styrofoam. Sometimes it appears so thick it looks like ice cream sticking to the side of the glass. Lacing is the thickest I have ever seen. The liquid is almost rose-wine coloured, slightly pink and occasionally almost white. Light light orange and very pale, with only fleeting golden glimpses. Whilst at first it appears to be transparent, held up to the light it is clearly not, but quite thick and murky. Aroma immediately is sugary aged peaches or nectarines, along with a baking-bread yeast smell. A definite aged smell to this bottle: musky, dusty, and very mature. The sweetness borders on sourness, and some honey aromas become clear. Candy apples, pears, apricots, sugar-rich candy, light but very bready malt, ripe green apples, soap characteristics; not as spicy as it is sweet. Taste delivers on the aroma fully. What struck me immediately was how incredibly drinkable this was for a strong Belgian. The taste is a superbly balanced experience. I was expecting cloying sweetness with some fruity yeast, but it has so much more. The hops, undetectable in the aroma, complement the sweetness expertly. Dusty, full yeast taste on the middle, giving green apples again strongly, along with other fruits, perhaps pear. Toasted malt with strong caramel and semi-sourness, almost akin to tomato juice if tasted strongly enough. Very full, yet it disappears in effervescence on the tongue in a slight tingle and foaminess. When exhaling with the beer in the mouth, I get strong dough or pasta tastes. Some fresh pine wood tastes. The aftertaste for me personally was all green apples and sugary pear. Yes, the phenols are there, but at first I did not even notice the alcohol--it was that smooth and balanced. Certainly it does not suggest 8.5%. This bottle seemed to be very foamy, but not overly gaseous in the mouth. The lees, tasted separately, give super fresh apple and fresh dough smells, dust and ultra-sweetness. The lees give the beer even more of a white appearance, almost like a wit-bier. Smooth in the mouth, very full, it tasted basically as though I had poured some dry yeast into a glass full of lukewarm water and consumed it. The yeast made the beer warmer. Personal verdict: one of the best. This is classic beer, and when aged it accrues even greater proportions, like a classic novel written a hundred years ago. This is something most people will revisit again and again, with friends, on memorable occasions. This beer is one of the few I have found that have an indescribable quality about them; it is not easy to put into words why this is such heavenly liquid.","Cwrw","Aug 24, 2004"

You can eat the head with a fork. The smell is exquisite, with spicy and fruity tones and a bit of malt. The taste is wonderful. I enjoy belgian ales, and this one is excellent for a bottled beer commercially available in the USA. It is a strong, crisp, spicy ale with a bit of fruitiness that goes down incredibly smooth.

The beer itself is crystal clear and effervescent. My glass has a scoring at the bottom, and the steady stream of bubbles that rises from it looks vaguely like a flame on a roaring fire. The taste is sweet up front, followed by an intense hoppiness. I remember the surprise that I experienced when I first tasted this beer. Its so intensely flavorful. In some beers, the aroma is the dominant attribute, but with Duvel, the mouth-taste is essential. Its full, and almost chewy. I get a yeasty taste throughout the beer as well.

It is thin in the mouth but the carbonation really gives it a fuller feal. While you can taste hints of the 8.5% abv, it adds to teh beer, and overall youwouldn't think the abv was that high making it quite drinkable. I probably drink this beer slower then most, a definate sippin' beer because the flavor burst on your tounge with each small sip, and as it warms the pear/cirtus flavor comes out more and the slight peppery flavor disapears.

You can just smell the spicy, fruity Belgian yeast esters. The taste definitely has those. It reminds me of Grand Cru's I have tried. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth.

The taste was fairly sweet with citris flavors on the front end and a little bit of a peppery kick to it on the tail end. The carbonation made the mouthfeel failry light and gave it an almost champagne-like quality to it. Overall the drinkabilty is remarkably high as it is a very smooth beer.

The aroma is evident as soon as the bottle is opened. The taste is a clean, malty ale with almost no bitterness, and a hint of sweetness. There are spices present that I have a hard identifying but this is a powerful elixir. It has a clean, bubbly feel in the mouth and then the alcohol hits. It is excellent from the first drop to the last. It gets more drinkable as it warms up. The only drawback is my inability to drink more than one due to the alcohol content, but I'll be back tomorrow.","rdrummer","Mar 13, 2004"

Champagne like bubbles rapidly race to the surface of this beer. Aroma is of spice but with some notes of yeast. The taste is clean and yeasty but balanced well with some spicey aftertaste. I thought the 750 ml bottle had less hoppiness than I am used to in the 33 cl bottles. The same duvel character remained though. Mouthfeel is exceptional as this beer goes down creamy and bubbly. Drinkability is also amazing considering the massive alcohol content of this brew. I wish I could have more than a couple of these in a night and still feel fine the next morning. This beer is a true masterpiece in my mind.","soper2000","Mar 03, 2004"

The smell was quite unique, with a slightly bitter apple scent and a grainyness to it as well. The taste was quite dry like champagne but with better flavor. The apple scent came out slightly in the flavor but I mostly detected a peppery spice which was very nicely paired with the bubbly mouthfeel. This is definanlty not a beer that I could drink all of the time, but I think it would pair well with many meals and would convert some wine and champagne lovers to beer as well.","Dmann","Feb 22, 2004"

It only lost points due to the alcohol which overpowered the others a bit. The taste was also exceptional. Grains, musty yeast, and some spiciness and alcohol in the background. I didn't taste the fruit notes in the middle that some have described, but I only had one. Alas, maybe next time. Mouthfeel was very good as well.

It looks much lighter than it truly is. The head is quite nice-good and sticky, snowy white and long lived. Aromas are fairly complex and inviting-malty, somewhat anteseptic and spice driven with some citrusy hop notes as well. The mouth feel is damn nice! Refreshing with good dryness and medium to full body, this is a solidly balanced drink-never flabby or sticky. Flavors are classic in that they cleanse with a sweet/spicy clove-corriander? and, banana like flavor much like a German Hefe, while at the same time offering Belgium richness and complexity which kicks the beer up a notch. This is like a Hefe Squared! Interesting how easy this beer is to drink-remarkable really! I will be re-visiting this brew with food very soon as it seems to offer great potential.

Starts out with some of that alcohol kick, but it's very well hidden with the yeast then finishes off with some apples/pears. 8.5% is a little to laugh at, you can't taste it at all.

Thick, rockiest white head atop a hazed straw pilsner colored nectar. Gobules of foamies cling to the sides of the goblet. Sweet candi sugar and musty hops with accents of spicy yeast and a completed fermentation. Citrus notes and black pepperiness, not unlike Orval. Tastes complex like a sneak attack on your tastebuds; sweet and dry, tart and zingy. Effervescent like you would not believe, bubbly to the tongue. Beautiful tight lacing in glass. It's complexity makes it one of the best beers in the world, whereas the recipe history stated that Duvel was initially formulated to compete with the growing pilsner boom of the 30s and 40s.

I'll concede that there is a lot of complex tastes here, but none of them is really what I want in a beer - standard francophone sweetness, a bit of pepper and clove, very little in the way of malt, and practically no hops.

Fine balance of belgian hops and malts, light fruitiness, more citrus than sweet. Spices present themselves, but not in memorable fashion. The mouthfeel is crisp and micro-bubbly, as much as any champange. It imposes itself and therefore detracts, on the flavor a bit. Tastes present are citrus malts, genuine Belgian hops, apple, and coriander. Even at 8.5% you have to search for alcohol flavor, which is dangerous if put in the wrong hands.

The first sip is an arsenal of spicy fruit flavors with a nice bite from the carbonation and alcohol as if the beer is reminding you show respect where its due. Everything becomes extremely balanced and much more mellow as I take a few more sips, which is where the deception begins.

A very foamy white head, lots of carbonation. Poured a straw color into my Chimay goblet (so I don't have a Duvel glass - sue me!). Scents of sweet fruits and honey. Taste of honey and bananas, and a nice crisp zap of hoppiness that keeps it from being too cloying. Definitely did not notice the high amount of alcohol, so this would probably have led me to dance in the middle of the street if I had a large supply of them on hand. I'll have to get my wine snob old man to drink this as part of my ongoing campaign to get him to respect beer.","woemad","Aug 02, 2003"

Head remains throughout glass. Strong hop presence. Beer practically floats off the tongue and hops grab onto the sides of cheeks and the flavor lingers there. Excellent amount of lace. As beer warms and settles, hop flavor mellows and the beer seems to thicken up and gains a citrus finish.","BobLuvBeer","Jul 29, 2003"

Looks like heaven in a glass, slightly hazed golden hue, massive amount of carbonation action (more fun than watching sea monkeys), and a massive chunky white head that stayed all of the way and left some serious lacing. Light citrus aroma, some coriander, a bit of hay. Flavour is very light and subtle at first, considering that this is 8.5% abv, but it all seems to come out in the finish and linger, mostly citrus tones lightly surrounded by spice. Very smooth mouthfeel, deceiving, as the angel on my one shoulder says to stop at one, but the devil on the other side says to go hog wild.

The carbonation reminds me of a few bottle conditioned homebrews that went wrong. The beer is light bodied.

The smell is very fruity, mostly banana and citrus. It is very pleasant. The taste is a great blend of fruit, spices, and alcohol. It isn't overly sweet though, there is a good malt/hops balance. The beer has a great strong mouthfeel to it. The drinkability is just a little lower, because the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked, as in other stong ales.","SheepNutz","May 24, 2003"

Silky smooth, the ""Devil"" comes on in a wave of lightly sweet bready malt combined with a bit of banana and mildly spicy esters.

What a perfect pour with one of the most amazing head retentions I have seen, will have to credit this with the priming of the candied sugar. Brilliantly spiced aroma along with a thicket of musty maltiness and a decent amount of hopping. The mixture of malty sweetness, bready yeast notes, and striking bitterness equates to one of the most amazing beers in the world. The mouthfeel is a complex combination of fizzy carbonation and syrupy sweetness. If and when they begin to keg this stuff it is going to be the true end of the world.

It is slithgly dry, but sweet at the same time - I can't explain it well. This is a great beer and I would highly recommend it. The taste is one of a kind with a bit of spicyness about it.

An initial combined taste of fresh fruity, sugary, bubble gum, spicy flavor is quite nice, with an immediate belly warmer feeling going on. The alcohol is noticed throughout, but does not seem to be overpowering. Very creamy and delicious throughout, crisp, malty and fizzy finish, leaves you begging for more. A sipping beer, take note though, this one will sneak up on you in a hurry, the Duvel feeling will last for quite some time!

Banana, pear, citric sourness; ruthlessly, at first, a rude, invading stampede, but then following with a finish that lingers long as it dissolves into exotic, florid memories. The dénouement is sophisticated, an ethereal stretch; it is the proper occasion for a taste of cheese, a nut, or a bit of fruity juxtaposition.

The mouthfeel is very crisp from the high carbonation, but it's a most enjoyable carbonation. To simply state the complexity of taste: sweet, fruity, spicy(mostly on the finish), simply amazing. This beer defines what high drinkability is. 8.5% ABV? You would never have a clue of that high level without the label on the bottle stating it. Not to sound repetitive, but this beer can definitely be dangerous. I'm going to struggle to limit myself to one 750mL bottle.","AudioGilz","Feb 03, 2003"
4.89,14.8,4,5,5,4.5,5,"So good it's painful. This is a beer you don't ever want to stop drinking. One of the best qualities of this is the sound it makes when you pop the cap. The ""whooshing"" sound of the air escaping lasts twice as long as most beers and if you put your hand near it, you can feel that it's twice as powerful. It takes much longer than most beers to pour also because the head was so large. I once tried to take a sip of this straight out of the bottle, and was punished with a head that rushed out and foam went everywhere. I learned my lesson: A beer of this quality requires respect. As for the taste, a strong yeast flavor is the first thing I notice. A wonderful flavor of ripe fruit follows. Apricot, apple, peach, it's all there. It's got a slightly alcoholic finish which doesn't bother me in the least. It just serves as a reminder of the strength of this brew. The apperance could have been a little darker, and the mouthfeel a little thicker, but other than that, It's pretty close to perfection.

Clean malty grains and yeast with some spice on the edges. A really wonderful, interesting taste. The easiest aspect of the taste to pick out is the yeasty, bready finish. Sweet grains start it out, giving way to noticeable carbonation and an astringent warmth and finally the afore-mentioned finish.

As for you Belgian beer fans, try it head to head against the ""competition"". Somehow, the Duvel is totally unique. Enjoy!!","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 13, 2003"
2.47,-42,5,3,2.5,2.5,1,"Phoosh, off goes the cap with a blast. Pouring it slowly was not enough to tame this wild head. The head literally GROWS before your eyes, forming a peak of meringue so thick, you can float a half dollar on it. The beer itself is highly carbonated. It actually formed whirlpools of spiral bubbles in my glass. The color is crystal clear straw golden. Aroma is typical Weihenstephan Weizen yeast, with that banana/clove tang. Pretty typical in the aroma department. The taste is also pretty typical bavarian wheat, but with a warming punch of alcohol. No lambic aroma or taste. Has a sweetness in the back of the throat for the finish, and not much for hop flavor. Fumes of alcohol warm the nostrils after a hearty gulp. Aside from the wonderful head, I don't know why this beer earns such stellar reviews. It may be a Belgian-style strong pale ale, but it tastes like a typical bavarian wheat, and not even a good one at that. In my opinion, it tastes like a ""DoppleWeizen"". I had a hard time finishing just one bottle, and would not buy another in the future.","Mitchster","Jan 09, 2003"

The beer had a cloudy, mucky appearence as well, with lines of bubbles dragging up the sides. The smell is of fruits and alcohol in my book, even here I notice some champagne-like characteristics.

It poured a rich golden blonde with a sweet aroma and luscious fruity essence that was one of the main attractions I had hoped for.

Very fine bubbles of carbonation can be seen trailing up through the liquid. The lacing this beer leaves on the glass leaves no doubt why the call it ""belgian lace"". The aroma is unmistakably Saaz hops, with some similarities to Pilsner Urquell. However, this beer has much more going on in the nose. An overall sweetness, with some fruity pear notes dominate the aroma. The taste is fantastic. At first, it doesn't seem like much is going on, but then the flavors start developing. None of the tastes are stronger than the others, as this is a beautifully balanced beer. Alcohol notes of sweetness are present immediately, but just a hint. Then a light peppery citrus flavor appears, only to be replaced by a spicy bitterness. Then some sweetness reappears, but it's different than the initial sweetness. The finish is clean but yet flavorful. The mouthfeel is very good, but the carbonation seems a little strong as it tickles the back of my throat. For 8.5% ABV, this beer is amazingly drinkable. the alcohol is present in sweetness only, and that nice warming feeling your throat gets as you swallow the beer. I could easily make drinking this beer a regular occurence. Truly an exceptional beer.","aaronh","Dec 07, 2002"

It also has an outstanding retention and laces the sides of your glass as the head eventually dissipates. Nose is clean and fruity with notes of citrus, sweet malts, pepper, and spice. A light fruitiness of orange and lemon come through in the taste upfront with a nice blend of sweet malts and bitter and spicy hops. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a very nice carbonation.

The aromas were a bit strange at first with a slight skunky twang to the aromas, but after letting it sit for a while, nice fruity esters and spices with a slight hint of yeast in the background revealed themselves. The taste was out of this world with nicely blending of yet again, fruity twang, spices, and light yet not sticky yeast and alcohol on the tail.

I had expected the body to be cloudy from yeast, but it was clear. The yeast was firmly attached to the bottom and I had not left any beer in the bottle to swirl with thinking that enough yeast would come out that I wouldn't have too since I wasn't wanting a lot of yeast in the beer. The aroma was typical spiciness of the style, with a little of the spicy noble hops (saaz) complimenting the yeast spice. Lemon and a faint sweetness were also present. Duvel seems a bit maltier than other belgian strong pales. Besides the malt and typical yeasty flavors, there was a very faint hint of vanilla and cantaloupe melon. There was also a very faint cheese flavor in the finish. The flavor leaves the palate quickly and is rather dry.

Half of the glass is filled with the pale golden elixir, which is only slightly hazy since I left about 2cm in the bottle to keep the yeast out.  This is topped off with a huge, rocky, pure white head that leaves a generous amount of lace, yet stays very well.  A steady stream of bubbles rises from the very bottom of the glass, helping the head's wonderful staying power.  Spicy aroma of pepper and fruit esters, along with some malt presence in the background.  On the palate, delicate yet spicy pepper tickles at the tongue, creating a tingly yet smooth mouthfeel.  Slightly fruity sweetness is the major player here, and goes perfectly with the spiciness.  Very slight hop character shows itself in a rind-like bitterness around the middle and in the finish.  The finish is otherwise sweet, but is dominated by the aforementioned hop bitterness.  The high alcohol content is not at all noticeable, making this dangerously drinkable!

Hazy yellow-gold body with an orange-cast topped by a dense, rocky bright-white head that holds extremely well - buoyed by a tight-beaded effervescent carbonation - and leaves some exceptional lace . The aroma is quite fragrant: fruity, yeasty, candy sweet and malty, lightly peppery with a touch of spicy hops. The body is light/medium with an extremely fine and highly effervescent carbonation that is pillowy soft and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended.","NeroFiddled","Oct 11, 2002"

Later much laciness on the glass.  Aroma changed over time.  Initially light malt with fruitiness and spice that turned to clove.  Pale yellow color and clear. Taste has complexity.  Starts off light, moves to spiciness (cloves and some fruitiness) with malt, then a shot of alcohol (that stays to the finish), and concludes with mild lingering somewhat bitter dryness.  Thinner mouthfeel and despite the huge head the carbonation while evident doesn't seem excessive (yet there is some experience of fullness).  Very interesting beer.

The beer is very refreshing, and very fruity.  Somewhat dry finish, very pleasant.  For a beer with this amount of alcohol, I do not get the alcohol warmth from other high octane beers.Looks great, smells good, very drinkable, but to me it misses the essence of a good beer.  Great for its style, but it ain’t my style.  Addendum:  more than a slight hangover the next morning.","jackndan","Apr 19, 2002"
3.96,-7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"My initial impression is that this beer is overrated. That said, it's still pretty good. I am unclear on the delineation between a tripel and this style; no matter. Prolific frothy head, very pale; vaguely reminiscent of Aying's Jahrhundert although milkier and lacking the lager characteristics. Also a hidden spice but this is very subtle. It is an unseasonably hot and humid day today, and this seems to be affecting the beer in positive ways. It is crisper, more refreshing. This is the 3rd bottle of a 4 pack and the most enjoyable so far. The first 2 (and this one, to a lesser extent) had vague euro-skunky characteristics, much like Heineken. Expiration date is 5/04 so that can't be it. I wonder if this is a slightly off batch since I've recently had Victory Golden Monkey and Unibroue Eau Benite, and greatly prefer them both to this world-class, top-rated brew.","Thrasher","Apr 16, 2002"
4.85,13.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is what the style is all about, strong but easy to drink. With its sweet, fruity, spicy flavors, wonderful head and high Belgian level of carbonation makes for one perfect package.","mattmaples","Apr 13, 2002"

4.82,13.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I have finally found one of the nectars of the Gods! Duvel is fabulous. From it's cloudy apperance to it's peppery spice taste this brew is dangerous to drink. At 8.5% it will rock your world in a hurry.","Reverand","Mar 24, 2002"
4.67,9.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"With a spritzy mouthfeel, Duvel is deceivingly light, but has a myriad of flavors.  It's got a bit of alcohol warmth and a nice touch of clove in the finish.  Duvel's a wonderfully complex beer, is one of my very favorite Belgian beers, and is WAY too drinkable for the alcohol content.  Be sure to try this one in the 11 ounce bottle-- I had several of the large bottles flat.","marc77","Mar 10, 2002"
3.98,-6.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Its good, but perhaps a bit overrated, great appearnce, nice flavour, bitter finish, all good things, but just lacked something.","rastaman","Feb 15, 2002"
4.3,0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"-Duvel Beligian Ale-Nice fogged, hazy, peach color. Fruity & complex but very balanced... Very fine brew! Don't drink to many, 8.5 abv. will make you see double. Price for a case around Philly will leave you crying & asking were is all my money! It's between $45-50 a case!","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 03, 2002"
4.32,1.4,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"Extremely carbonated (quite a spectacle), head froths so easily and endures long long after initial pour.  Super pale yellow, almost white.  Mellow spices on the nose, a typical belgian scent.  Initial shock comes when the razor sharp bittersweetness hits your tongue, follows through with a spicey almost hot notes.  The flavor penetrates deep into the palate, leaving a long aftertaste.  A sharp tangy crisp mouthfeel.  Would be quite the summer refresher beer, despite the 8.5% ABV.  Always wanted to try this infamous brew, was worth $9 for the four-pack.","Jordan","Jan 21, 2002"
4.9,15,5,5,5,4,5,"Giant rocky white head that lasts forever and laces the obligatory Belgian Chalice. Fruity malt in the nose followed by a deceptively smooth taste for the alcohol content. Spicy malt followed by a long dryish hop finish. Lovely to watch the champagne like bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass as I savor this first class Belgian.","QXSTER1","Nov 17, 2001"
4.94,16,4,5,5,5,5,"This beer deserves its place in history.  Just the right mix of hops and sweetness for a crisp, clean flavor that somehow hides its devilish alcohol content.","mmthompson33","Nov 03, 2001"
4.65,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"What can I possibly say? This is a world classic, one of the greatest beers brewed, bar none. You've got to drink this one in the proper glass if you want to contain the massive head. Fruity and complex in a clean, delicate way. More than 750 ml and I'm down for the count.","BKotch","Oct 12, 2001"
4.9,15,5,5,5,4,5,"Outstanding brew. Remarkable fruity flavor imparted by the yeast. I prefer to let this warm a bit and let some of the carbonation dissipate before drinking.","John","Oct 02, 2001"
4.76,11.7,5,4,5,5,5,"Nice and peppery.  So smooth and mild, I can't believe it has an abv of 8.5%.  Wait, what's that buzzing sound I hear?  I guess I can believe it.","Brent","Sep 27, 2001"
4.38,2.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I reviwed this a year ago and felt tit was time for an update.  Poured into the glass with a big rocky and creamy head.  Clear- doesn't look strong.  Spicey smell- almost like wine.  Taste is smooth and crisp, but dry.  Some flowery taste as well.  So drinkable, it's scary.","AaronRed","Sep 18, 2001"
