"Sour Brettanomyces driven first impression, coated up by bready, soft malts. Also ripe, fruity orange, which goes well with the sourness. Then dry, noble hops hit the palate, which give the beer a well balanced, decent complexity. Sweet molasse becomes detectable for a glance, which soon gets swallowed by the hoppy sourness. This actually reminds me of Orval in some way, but adds a very well fitting fruit note to the beer, while it isn’t very aggressive on the hops. Leads to a bitter finish, very dry aftertaste, which dries up the mouth completely."

"A mid-range sour beer. I prefer other Mikkeller efforts in this style space. Was appreciated by my friends who would generally shy away from anything too funky. I might taste this again down the road to see if the present assessment holds up."
""
"Bad phenolic off flavors just like about 50% of mikkeller beers I try"
""
"Amber to brown in color with plenty of haziness.  A fingernail of off white head is on top.  Brussels lacing.  I smell sour Brett.  The flavor is Brett forward with a tart cherry note.  The body is heavily carbonated and crisp."

"I prefer the Orval. Getting that out of the way, this was indeed a nice Belgian-style ale with nice saison characteristics, not as funky as the Lychee/Wine Barrel version (only one that i tried, pretty sure the others are great too), but lighter and actually.. almost a different thing entirely."

"10/02/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. This is a tongue twister. Team taste buds is having issues with signals. One swallow is sweet-ish, the next less so, & the next not at all. Never any sweet or bitterness but far from all together sweet. Hate to submit to the suggestion, but it does strike me as an organic/evolving taste. All this w/a funky finish. Can't imagine what a bottle gets you."

"I should also note that because there is no bottling date I'm not sure how old this is; I feel like age may account for some of the shortcomings."

"still great beer here, but unfortunately i think i enjoy the many variations far more than the original here. this is more of a belgian than the others, and as such the brett comes through a lot less. the ak alive version i thought was the supreme wild ale, a perfect example of dryness and brett character, while its alive here is just a bit more generic as they go. hazy rust colored liquid, maybe a touch lighter than that, with a prominent several inches of cream colored fluff. it smells like belgian yeast first, orchard fruit esters and dusty grain ith some amber malt sweetness. the brett is really only on the finish for me, not super dry or effervescent, but farmy, more like a belgian saison here than a true wild ale as i have come to know them from mikkeller, but i like it a lot just the same. the brett pushes the denser grain to the forefront of the flavor, where its sweetness is balanced nicely. the diversity of yeasts and yeast characters make this beer unique and special, but i just dont find the complexity or wonderment i discovered in all the variations of it. great carbonation and a lof of body still. very well made beer, but i would take ak alive over this one any day."

"2011 bottle that I split with scotchzi. Pours a perfect amber-brown-tan. Healthy amount of light tan head with very sticky lacing. Aroma is a funky butterscotch, toffee, earthy. Really great smell. Taste is more funky than the aroma; but otherwise follows the smell. Great carbonation lends to the bubbly mouthfeel. Light in body, but it works very very well for this beer. Definitely looking forward to the variants I have of this."
"Copper colored ale slightly hazed with yeast sediment big chunky off white khaki head leaves fine Belgian style lacing, great look to it. Aromatics tart funky yeast notes acidophilus, brettanomyces, the gangs all here...It's Alive! The beer's yeast that is. Great barnyard funky edge to it, acidic hints of yogurt borderline vinegar lactic acid notes, this beer was aged on white wine barrels. I'm not sure what they were going for but I like sour ales. On the second sniff I'm getting ripened pineapple, oak barrel aging effects, a slight buttery note, there's everything in here. Flavor wise, bitter yeast and acidity collide, a hint of band aid, medicinal notes, with big fruit thing ripened pineapple, tropical fruit notes embedded in barnyard/horse blanket type flavor aspects, grassy hay and wet acidity. Some people would say cat piss but I don't find it offensive in the least regards. I find hints of sliced green apple, plump raisins, and other fine infused tart characteristics, this is probably my favorite Mikkeller thus far, I find hit or miss to be their game but this is dead on for a beer called...It's Alive! I'm a fan, of their de Proef gypsy brewed offerings I've had limited contact with their hoppy ales but have found them to be lackluster compared to most American brewed versions. Mouthfeel upfront has a rolling carbonation a bit prickly with acidity and sharp dry finish but the mix of carbonation and dry character seems to treat the beer superbly on the palate. Overall what can I say that I didn't already go try this brew."

"M&O: throughout the drink the mouthfeel remains softly refreshing with rather decent and subtle carbonation, against a medium-plus body of Orval-like flavour profile. The attenuation level is not quite as high as the original, nor is the funky Brett’s performance, but all in all this is a highly drinkable Belgian ale with layers of flavours and aroma to offer."

"(4.0) D: This is very easy to drink considering the smoothness. Having not had something like this before it's difficult to compare but I thoroughly enjoyed this. Taste profile is a very well integrated mix of belgian ale and wine – can’t find much to complain about here."

"Overall: A good beer- a lot like champagne. Not the best, but worth having. The shelf talkers for this beer at BevMo said that this is Orval-inspired; I can kinda see that, but this is definitely its own animal."

"Overall - Simple flavors. I like the balance of this right now. Would probably be way too bretty with age."

""

"Nice and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about."

"This is really earthy. I'm thinking the Brett really lent this quality to the beer that would have otherwise been just another hoppy pale. Really interesting, but not necessarily memorable."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/23/2012 on the cork. Cork did no pop off. Pours hazy reddish orange color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of oak, raisin, red wine, pear, caramel, apple, wine vinegar, earth, grass, hay, herbal, pepper, leather, funk, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and high complexity. Taste of oak, raisin, pear, caramel, pepper, earth, hay, leather, molasses, grass, clove, funk, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of oak, dark fruit, caramel, molasses, pepper, earth, herbal, grass, leather, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavor; no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is ok; definitely needs more carbonation. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian wild ale. The taste was a bit odd at first, but it grew on me; nicely complex and smooth to sip on. Enjoyed this quite a bit despite low carbonation."
"Well worth a try if you're a Mikkeller fanboy like I."

"O- not great. Not bad. Also not worth the price though"
"This is really strange. It's lightly sweet, lightly fruity, lightly funky, definitely phenolic, and watery. It's doesn't really make sense to list this as Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but I guess it doesn't really fit into any categories."
"Overall: Unique to say the least. Belgian yeast layered over a pronounced Brettanomyces funkiness is just crazy. Not sour, not really funky, not Belgian. This is a beer made of nots because I have no idea what it is."
""
""
""
"This is medium bodied. This might be passed its prime. I'm not sure how wild I am about Mikkeller's wild ales in general."
"the body is light with slightly low carbonation. Overall this one is okay. A little messy overall but this one is drinkable."
""
""
""
"Thanks to TheBishopco for this one!"
""
"This should definitely be listed as an American Wild Ale. Pretty complex and unique, but deeper and richer/stickier than a BSPA."
"O: This is an interesting strong ale. With its overpowering wild yeast character, it should please fans of lambics, American wild ales, and the funkier, yeastier saisons. A very solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Something away from Orval, or those I have had in some malt, sweet/caramel sense, but rather nice and memorable."
"A nice beer with lots and lots of funk. I feel like it lacks a bit of depth and is a little one dimensional in terms of the funk but that is what you get from Brett."
"D ~ Good beer, but only the frame work of Orval. Lacks finesse, but is drinkable. It is merely a shadow of the beer it is imitating but I'm glad I tried it."
"not worth 15$ but there was only one way to find that out, looks great but perhaps it needs some age or something, I remember loving USAlive this ones not as impressive"
"Overall damn tasty funky pale ale that, in my opinion, comes close to a saison/farmhouse in style - maybe even more so than a pale ale. Easy drinker that I could post up on all night."
""
"O: I was drawn to this beer by its stark label, don't regret buying it and trying it but I dont see myself seeking this out ever again. A mediocre base beer with an overly funky character."
"As it sits, the funkiness mellows a bit (or your taste buds simply get used to it), but the beer really touts its wild side. While I very much enjoyed the entire bottle, I don't know that I would ever seek it out again. It's not for the faint of heart or the unadventurous, and it seems a little one dimensional. However, if you enjoy wild ales, you should really pick this one up at least once."
""
"This drinks really easy if you are into Brett, A nice take on the style, albeit a touch pricey"
""
"B-"
"O: My first wild ale and I really enjoyed it. Hard to pinpoint the exact flavors and aromas but truly enjoyable. I will be looking forward to more of this interesting variety. "" It's Alive"" will be frequently enjoyed in my house."

"Wow! One of the funkiest aromas I've ever come across from a beer. The taste followed the nose only way less funk. The funk almost rounds out the flavors. Very good especially if you like funky brews. I enjoyed this one with some aged cranberry white cheddar."

"750ml cellered for a good while Thanks to Gregus. Mikkeller is alway expensive, but pretty much alway unique and good. Clear amberish color, amazing looking head. Frothy and solid looking, like wax. I walked away for 20 minutes and came back to the head still holding like a champ, and lacing still clinging. This beer has great visual appeal. Smell is an appealing, but very delicate aroma. I smell flowers and bright acidic yeast. Not what I was expecting. Beer is surprisingly drinkable. Subtle malt notes, minimal hopping. Seems like the recipe is designed to push the yeast character, which is complex and exciting to the palate. Ph is low and puckers the lips a bit. Thin body, booze is quite well hidden. I could have used a bit more sour. But wonderful beer. Pleasure to have tried."
"O- I am not a fan of Belgian beers very much, but i thought this was pretty good. I dont know where this beers horrible reviews came from...."
"Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one at the Down South Beer Tasting while aasher was in town to visit! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, orange rine, fruit, banana, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sugar, wheat, banana, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was just something about this one that was a little off-putting in the flavor. Maybe it was the way the sugar blended with the fruits present??? Who knows, but this could have been a lot better if this were not the case. Glad I got to try it, but that is about it."
"O- I like this beer more than I expected to. It reminds me of the BBB from fantome, but a little richer. Good beer and I am now a Mikkeller fan."
"Medium body with high carbonation, very smooth on the palate and very drinkable."
"So, I have no idea where to write this review. I found this bottle just recently, but it is in a 750ml bottle and labeled as a Belgian Wild Ale. I thought it may be the It's Alive that is not retired, but the ABV is off and there are no 750ml bottle reviews...so I'm VERY CONFUSED. So anyways, pours an almost-clear golden amber color with a HUGE, beautiful, frothy cream-colored head. Scent is a bit of Brett with some sugary sweetness to it. Lots of pepper and spiciness to it with a hint of lemon zest and citrus...orange peel. Taste is initially citrusy with hints of funk from the Brett. Not as funky as I was expecting. Has a lot of Belgian yeast flavors and sugar cane. Then I some lemon tartness that finishes sweet and Bretty. Mouthfeel is full and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome beer. I can definitely see how people would compare this beer to Orval, but IMO it can't compete. In fact, any beer that is a tribute to Orval can't compare...this one may be the closest though."
"Pours a rich burnished brown leather with a ridiculously frothy massive head leaving thick chunks of foam on the glass as it ever so slowly dissipates. The nose has bright sour citrus, red fruit, a touch of pleasant funk along with belgian spices. The taste brings sour raspberry, lemon, along with clove and almost a touch of banana, very light sourness and funk - tasty stuff. I did find it to seem a bit diluted at this abv though i was highly impressed with the look and taste."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a nice bronzed amber with a thin ring of white head. Smells of yeast, citrus zest, and bubblegum. Sweet taste, pale malts, very citrusy, pear, pineapple, and a bit of hay. Some hop bitterness coming through, but not much. Almost saisonish. Very complex and enjoyable array of flavors. Medium mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"M/D/O: medium bodied, lots of carb. Smooth and easy to drink with very wide appeal. A delicious beer with good balance; a great introduction to the saison style for newbies."
"O: This makes me think of the typical run of the mill amber ale with a bit of oak. I was really hoping for more hops and more Brett."
"D: A solidly made, tasty and drinkable beer."
"Pours a pretty, slightly dark, slightly hazy golden amber with a VERY thick buttery off-white head. The bottle I got fizzed like nobody’s business, so have a towel handy! Aroma is average strength, fruity, yeasty and somewhat sweet with a malty hint. Flavor is mainly fruity, sweet but not too sweet, and has malt and yeast hints plus just a bit of butterscotch. Texture is fairly fizzy, leaving a rather persistent tingle on the tongue and lips."
"Light and fluffy, the beer itself is a light yellow amber. Smells are pretty plain, but pleasant - very light fruits, citrus, bread, and thick floral smells. The taste is that same collection of smells after they go to funk dance-off. Very wild and Bretty. I think the taste takes a hit with the body. Those notes get lost a little bit in the ensuing explosion in your mouth. Still, very fun to drink and maybe even more to pour!"
"-Cheers"
"Overall: this is only my second of Mikkeler's beers and I like it. Its not spectacular but its still pretty good. I'm still new to wild beers, so the restrained brett character, lack of acidity, etc was easy for my palate to appreciate. I think it is worth a try but I don't know if I would've paid for a bottle of this, given how expensive Mikkeler products are. On tap, it was fairly priced. Cheers!"
"Overall, a good but not great wild ale for me. Not many wild ales choices here in TX but for $17.99 it would need to be a lot more re-memorable before I'd buy another. [N;O]"
"D: This owes more than a little debt to Orval, but it's pretty much exactly what I look for in a BSPA. Incredibly easy to put down."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass- pours a crazy amount of foam that fills the glass immediately. Excellent head retention. Smell- tart sour, musty, green apples. Taste- dissapointing. Not much here, not bad by any means. Flat apple juice. Some bitter funk from the brett. Boring, bland, but I guess highly drinkable, since it really doesn't taste like anything. The store owner advised me against this one, and I didn't listen. Oh well, could have spent 14 bucks worse ways than this. Mikkeller dissapoints here for sure."
"There are some redeemable things about this beer but on the whole it was ""just ok."" I'm really tempted to drain pour it, not because it's not palateable but because I was expecting something much better and much different and I didn't get it."
"Drinkable? Ya. Edgy hops, neutered yeast and underwhelming malt? You betcha. Enjoyable enough to warrant the price? The jury's still out..."
"D - Easy to drink, very glad I got to try this brew."
"mikkeller does not dissapoint"
"D: beers like this tend to go down quickly as there not rich and filling but rather crisp and refreshing. it was good I enjoyed it"
"I am surprised to learn that this beer is retired? I just had this on tap at ChurchKey in Washington, DC. Poured into a snifter glass. Beer was served at almost room temperature which is the norm at ChurchKey. Pours pale coppery amber with a lovely, medium, staying, creamy, white head but then fizzles quickly. Retains nice lacing throughout however. Picking up some funky aroma, bread, grapes, oak, and floral notes. Light vinious. High, prickly carbonation, fine dry and mild creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is quite mild, some sugary grape-like sweetness, and esters. Vinious and warming. Good fresh hoppy bitterness to the finish as well."
"D - Very drinkable and worth trying if you get the chance now that this one is retired."
"This beer pours like the muddy creek out back. It looks like dark, murky muddy water with an off white head that laces the glass beautifully. It smells great. It's tart, it's sour and it has this light fresh fruity-like sweetness that rounds it out. I know this beer hasn't been made in a little while but it could be more. It could be more tart, it could bolder, it could be more fruity, it could be more sour. I would guess I'd rate this an A- if fresh, but right now I can't do it. Some sours get stronger with age, this one lessens. It's tart but not tart enough. It drinks smoothly enough but it's not what it could be. It's drinkable but not overly so. This beer I'm sure could be better. Regardless, I'm glad I could try it."
"Decent, nothing great. I enjoyed their yeast series Brett more than this one but they are different beers entirely."
"D- Fairly Neutral for a Wild Ale. I was hoping for a little more punch, but what I got out of this was another tasty brew from Mikkeller anyways."
"I want to buy the store out of these. This beer hits all the right notes for me. After the initial tasting I finished the bottle with a farmer's market meal of halved and browned brussel sprouts (with salt and olive oil), artichokes (with salt and olive oil) faro, mustard greens, with sautéed oyster mushrooms, garlic, and caramelized red onion! I felt like I was having a king's feast! This has tied Maudite for one of my favorite beers for my personal taste!"
"SkÅl!"
"D: This was a great wild ale that was delicate and complex and very clean. It wasn't too funky, as the brett was well integrated and balanced. Body was decent, and the alcohol was well hidden, so it was incredibly easy to drink. Great brew fresh that may improve with age."
"Would drink again if given the chance."
"M & D: nice feel with a good brett aftertaste. The beer has a prevalent brett aroma and taste, but I wouldn't say this beer is sour. There is no pucker or tartness in the flavor or finish. Overall, a decent beer. I'd drink it again."
"Overall a nice Belgian style beer who's sweet malt overshadows the Brett. If I had a bottle I would age it 6 to 12 months to allow the Brett. character to develop."
"I guess that's the only thing that would keep this from being exceptional, it didn't have layers of things going on. Of course, that's not always a bad thing."
"It's Alive is pretty drinkable. Its a filling beer. I wouldn't want more than one, I think it would sit too heavy. There is a good amount of funk--it isn't limiting at all."
"Pours a hazy, amber/orange color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight floral, slight citrus, slight spice, and hint of tart malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight grass, slight wheat, slight tart malt, slight floral, sweet malt, and hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"Overall this was a solid beer but no one thing stood out as exceptional. Still, it's worth a shot."
"If you like Orval give this a shot to just compare the two, if you don't know Orval, skip it."
"I'm noticing a trend of higher ABV amber Belgian styles that I'm not crazy about -- the alcohol is too hot, the flavors muddled, not crazy about it. This is right in line with those characteristics. There are some interesting things going on, but they don't outweigh the toll that this takes on your palate & sobriety. Kind of disappointing."
"Poured a cloudy orange with a soft fluffy head that lasted for a good while. Left a lot of lacing behind with each sip. Smell was good. I picked up spices, mainly pepper, and citrus fruit. There was also something funky in the nose too. I've smelt it with other beers of this type but I can't really place what it is. It reminds me of the stables at the horse track. The taste was on par with the smell. Spicy and peppery with a nice citrus fruit character. The funk was present in the taste also but not near as apparent. I swear I tasted watermelon in there too. Mouthfeel was full and it left a nice tingle on the tounge.Very drinkable and hides its alcohol well."
"D: It's Alive drinks well and is a satisying brew, but not the mouth-killer I expected. I'd buy it again, but not for $18."
"Drinks pretty well as far as not finding the alcohol much. The semi-harsh finish makes it a little hard to quaff though. A solid offering from Mikkeller, and definitely a beer to think about. If this is supposed to be their answer to Orval, well, those are tough shoes to fill. Check this one out though."
"D - Honestly, if you like your hops, this is very easy drinking. The brett-funk that turns some people off is not dominating, so its really just a matter of liking the dryness. The ABV is not obvious, so a 750ml bottle per person is too easy."
"Pours with a big fluffy off-white head, that leaves two or three fingers of sticky Belgian lace. Aroma is sour apple and fresh sourdough bread. Very dry and funky, with sparkling carbonation. Bursts of brettanomyces yeast come through now and again, bringing notes of leather and hay. Astringent hops complete the grainy finish. A refreshing, straightforward wild ale, on par with many of the classics of the style."
"pours a cloudy copper orange with spare head but much more heavu in the lacing. delicious and lively but very flat at the same time. bit of a funky hay flavor. very cloudy but lively carbonation is still very noticable. medium body with a sticky oily texture. slightly bitter to the finish. over all very good beer, but don't let the smell fool you, the taste doesn't quite follow through."
"D - Very easy drinker. Glad I tried it."
"Wow! What a brew! Poured with a nice small (in a small sample glass) off white head and a little lace. Aroma is an incredible floral with yeast, malt and some hop. Flavor's about the same with massive malt and a little earthiness. Great, chewy body and carbonation. Color is a copper amber. Finish is like flavor. Deliscious. Brett. adds a lot to the the beer with the flavor and edge. Could even be a session for slow drinking."
"This is another hit form Mikkeller, quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. And they are certainly one of the true innovators of the brewing industry."
"D - For the style, a fun and very drinkable beer."
"Verdict: I had high hopes for this beer, but it falls a little short in the flavor-intensity department. Think of this as Orval with training wheels."
"Pours a big foamy off-white head. Semi-turbid body, dark amber in color. Creamy head, good lacing, almost like melted ice cream. Very hoppy sour smelling aroma. Sweet sour aroma. Dry and grapefruity. Chewy taste, some nutty biscuitiness. Light taste. Bitter and sour, but not hoppy tasting. Was expecting more hops. Slight sour taste, and something else. Can't taste the alcohol. Not a fan, not much taste."
"Finally decided to crack this brew after it has been sitting in my collection for a while now and must admit i had forgot about it anyways it pours a deep mahogany hue with decent carbbonation that leaves a two finger head and some lacing here and there,the aroma is candied fruit and alcohol infused toffee,it has an above average mouthfeel with tastes of boiled candy,toffee,dried fruits and finishes with a nice bitter edge to mash the sweet and sour tastes perfectly,overall a nice beer indeed thats very easy to drink but cos ive been spoiled by this brewer i know he can do better although it is a nice drop."
"Glowing and cloudy amber orange with murky sediment in the body and golden highlights on the edges. Two fingers of foamy, bubbly white head that holds up quite well. A few spots of lacing on the glass. Strong and pungent phenolic aroma, equal parts plastic and dried mango, very herbal in character. Taste is sweet caramel and pale malts, spicy Belgian yeast imparts black pepper and wheat. Some grapefruit, Anjou pears, and wine-like grape skin, with a bit of cedar and mildly dry bitterness from the hops. Boozy, warming finish gives off a medicinal flavour. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium-bodied, clean and peppery, not much aftertaste. Great beer to savour over the course of an evening."
"D- I'm going to enjoy this entire bottle quite thoroughly tonight"
"I liked this well enough, however, at $12.50 a bottle it's not likely something I'll pick up too often."
"D-At first, the beer isn't easy to drink. period. But as it warms, the beer becomes very easy to drink. I would highly suggest buying some if you can find it. I'm so glad for my friend Jason who hooked me up with this beer for my birthday."
"The beer pours a cloudy amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an excellent pale and crystal malt scent along with a some yeast fruitiness and a bit of farmhouse funk. The taste us decent as well. It has a crisp pale and crystal malt flavor along with a dry earthy farmhouse funk. The Brett character provides a mild sourness, but mostly a dry earthy flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer got bad reviews, but it's actually quite enjoyable. I'm not sure it's true to style, but it has good malt and yeast character."
"Drinkability: Try as I might, I just cannot get past the finish in this schizophrenic beer"
"Mikkeller is really quickly becoming my favorite brewery, US or abroad. This is some amazing stuff. Not for everyone? Fine by me. Gimme some more!"
"Very yeast medium body with slight roasted malt, peppery spiciness and a sour/tart earthy dry finish. There is some slight crisp light fruit character but this is overpowered by the funky tart brett flavor."
"."
"Notes: Glad to have tried this one but the Struise Mikkeller (Eliot Brew) remains my favorite from the brewery to date."
"In the end I'm not sure how I fully feel about this stuff, it's decent in it's seperate aspects, but the way it all comes together doesn't completely gel with me. An earthy ale, that's fore sure, but not necessarily something my palate wants to return to."
"Very tasty beer--more of a saison with light brett than anything else, though the hops taste American."
"Beer pours a dark amber color with a small white head. The aroma has a little bit of funkiness, with some fruit mixed in. No real hops on the aroma. The flavor is where the funkiness comes in. It is not as sour or wild as some other beers, but the flavor is definitely there once the beer has warmed up. By the time I finished my beer, it had been out of the fridge for over and hour and was very good. There are also some hops in the flavor as well as some slight fruitiness. A very good beer. Not too sour or funky, but a very good, drinkable beer that I hope to try again."
"really enjoyed this beer and would certainly drink it again!"
"Opinion: Well, this beer falls short of what I would classify as a wild ale. As i mentioned in my review, it seems more to me of an oak aged IIPA than a wild ale. Unfortunately it even falls short a bit for an Oak aged IIPA. It is an alright beer, but not one that I will be trying again after i drink this whole 750ml myself."
"Drinkability - I'd *almost* have this again, lol. Not quite, that funk still doesn't quite pass muster on the re-buy option, but this was reasonably drinkable."
"interesting mouthfeel. fizzes up a bit when it hits the tongue but then becomes very silky and smooth."
"Medium body has a crisp carbonation and is quite refreshing. Nothing like Orval, but still a very nice ale."
"this brew pours up a murky apricot color with a nice white head. verrrry nice lacing, mi amigo. the nose is hops straight up, floral hops dominate, a little funky, some light fruits, subtle light raspberry, apricots. I taste hops again, dry earthy character, Brett!!!!, very light fruits, a pretty dry brew. medium to full bodied, low to medium carbo. quite alright...."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in snifter, the beer pours a hazy copper/brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is mostly fruity (but also a bit light), it smells like tart apples, vinegar, funk, peppery spice, and some pears. Unfortunately, a lot of that doesn't come out in the taste. It tastes like some bready malt, yeast, peppery spice, and a little bit of tart fruit. There's also a bitter finish, but something just seems a little bit ""off"" about the taste. Mouthfeel is medium, it has moderate and soft carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. I'll have to revisit this one in the future."
"75cl bottle. Pours kind of a nasty yellow-brown with a smallish off-white head. Sweet, yeasty smell. Brown sugar and some very light Brett character. Faintly fruity. Not very pleasant. Very yeasty taste, again fairly sweet with a bit of fruit. Very restrained Brett notes. Hops evident toward the end. Light-medium body. An underwhelming take on this style, that I really just don't want to drink much of."
"I know I have said this with a number of reviews but for the price this beer should be passed over. Very good beer for the style but seems to be about twice the price of some of its competitors."
"Overall not at all what I was expecting but still delivered it quite nicely. I would not have a problem going for this one again, but maybe after it has a couple of years on in it."
"I will look to try again, as I think there's promise in the balance and subtle brett character."
"I am kind of at odds with this beer. Not bad at all, but nothing really special. All in all, I have had better Brett beers. It is worth a try though."
"I also expected the Brett to play more of a role, but perhaps that will come with a little more age. An overall good beer that I would buy again."
"Light bitter finish. Not what I was expecting. Tasted a bit like an English Barleywine to me. Still, very good beer."
"Well, I'm impressed. This beer is basically American, in its scope and ambition. This is not surprising coming from Mikkeller and DeProef, though, as both are among the more experimental European brewers. I'm finishing this 750ml bottle in no time, and filing this beer under ""right up my alley."" This is tasty, tasty stuff, and ridiculously easy to drink."
"Poured a hazy auburn with a big, fat, foamy white head. Good lacing. Funky, spicy aroma. Sweeter, fruity yeast rather than the barnyard variety. Malt sweetness as well mixed with apples and melon. Effervescent mouthfeel, kind of velvety, dry finish. Fruity taste, again with green apples and now peach. Some pepper spice aiwht maybe clove; but not the clove that may be found in a German hefe, a bit sharper. Sweet yeast funk as well. Some bread-dough malt from time to time. Easy to drink, but one bottle was my max."
"D- I couldn't drink this beer all the time but...well every once in a while this is a perfect tasting beer."
"D - An interesting beer indeed. Not quite a ""Belgian Wild Ale"" like the label suggests but certainly different to most BSPA. A Brettified Belgian IPA? Anyway, well worth a try."
"D. It goes down decently well, especially for the abv. Probably not something that I would drink again, but it was something that I was glad I tried."
"Drinks very well at 8.00%, while not being what I could call smooth."
"Pours a red-orange with good amounts of head. Bottle was filled all the way up to the bottom of the cork. Aroma is a little acrid and slightly sour. Reminds me of a drier white wine mixed with beer. Not really what I was expecting from reading the bottle, this makes much more sense when listed as a Belgian Pale Ale than as a Wild Ale. It tastes like a hybrid in style, not sour enough to really be a wild ale, but too acrid to be a strong ale. Not a terrible beer and I'm glad I tried it, overall though I am not impressed."
"Overall - A pretty good take on a Belgian pale ale. If you like Orval you'll definitely like this... well worth a try"
"Bottle: Poured a shiny amber color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and very good lacing. Aroma of fruity ester is very interesting with nice Belgian style malt and a slightly dry hoppy finish. Taste is also dominated by some fruity ester with some Belgian style malt with some lingering sweetness and some very light Poppering style hops at the end. Full body with great carbonation and no signs of the alcohol. Very well done though not very close to Orval as suggested by the label."
"Overall, very funky and unusual. Hard to evaluate, but definitely worth at least one try."
"Drinkability is pretty terrible. It's not revolting, but it's definitely not something I'd look forward to."
"M + D: Slightly sparkling, but it could be a bit richer, really. Modest, but medium body, quite smooth. As mentioned above, the flavours and aroma opens up very nicely with time, so it is good to allow it to breathe and open up."
"Drinkability: A fantastic bottle to split with friends. We all got weird things from this, probably due to the yeast and the brett overall, though it's missing some good prominent funk we were all hoping for. I could drink a bottle of this, but it's such a different and exciting brew that it's nice to see the responses of others also. With some tweaking in the future this could be amazing stuff, but right now, for the price, I'd stick to spitting the cost (around $12-$14 in my area) with a few friends."
"D - Looks, smells, tastes, and feels like a well-crafted IPA - except that the label calls it a ""Belgian Wild Ale."" So much for trying to categorize beer, I suppose! I had a really tough time picking out the brett here. Try as I might, I couldn't pick up any funk. Nate from Gordon's recommended that I get two bottles of this, one to drink now, and one to cellar, so we'll see what happens with the other one after a while."
"Somewhat tame for a Wild Ale, but it still has the same complexities. Very drinkable, and a good introduction to the style. Recommended."
"Comparisons to Orval come to mind. But this beer takes on a more caramel flavor and not as aggressive with the 'wild' character. Still, musty, horse-y, and dusty throughout. Even the dry-hopped character of the beer draws comparisons."
"D: Wild and funky but overall well done and toned. A sour citrusy, Belgian pale, good for a single serving (bomber) but not intriquing enough to warrant repeatability or future purchase. One try is suffice and only moderate when compared to their other fantastic beers they brew."
"A 750ml corked bottle split with psycohops. Poured into twin shaker glasses, the ale appears akin to murky iced tea with a finger of off white foam. The head settles to a thin layer as it warms. Nose and taste - spoiling tart apples, mild funk, candied apples, smarties candies. Super dry and bitter."
"D: One 750ml is more than enough for me on this one. It is ridiculously complex, yet only somewhat flavorful. Nothing quite makes me say, dude, take another drink, this is amazing, its more like, take another drink, did you really taste that. I highly recommend this beer to anyone that wants to challenge their palate, this one is a workout, almost to the point of being annoying. Still good, but wow."
"Burnt orange in color with an off-white head. Beer has a malty aroma with citrus and some mild brett funk. Taste is very similar with a finish that is slightly bitter, sour and dry. Alcohol is well masked. The beer got better as it warmed and as I drunk it but I was a bit disappointed overall."
"D: The heft of the 8% alcohol never gets in the way, allowing the funk to shine through. Another Danish standout."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is mixed for me, while it was and enjoyable break from what I am used to, I wouldn't come back for this again"
"Drinkability: this wild ale is a slow sipper. Nice flavor but one bottle will be enough in a session."
"D - This is a pretty interesting Belgian-style pale ale. It tasted nothing like it smelled but it was very good."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, not a problem to finish the 1 pt 9.4 fl oz bottle but I'm not craving more from there."
"Ok as a session brew but it needs more of the sour."
"d - I dunno. I kinda got used to it by the end but I can't really say it was pleasant and I wanted to open another. My cat Jingle loved it."
"The aroma is wild and funky, there is pepper and ginger as well as sour fruit, malt, herbs, and cedar. The appearance is amber with a huge head. The flavor is like the aroma but not overly funky. The palate is thin. Overall not bad for a wild beer. It's more than I expected."
"Overall, once I put the anticipated taste aside, the beer definitely became more drinkable. Still, given the price tag on this beer, I would probably not buy it again."
"D - Shows great complexity, and weak balance. The funk is fantastic, but even a sucker like me would love to see some more sweetness to balance out the huge funk. Fun, but not overly drinkable."
"Pours a very deep, translucent copper amber hue. What an awesome, thick, dense, sticky head. Spongey and very light tan in color. But very small and slow lacing. The aroma makes me think of the produce aisle at my local grocery store, Dominicks. More specifically, like when you bury your nose in th apple display. Particularly, green apples. Very yeasty, fruity taste. Unsweetend apple sauce and caramel malts. The apples and caramel slowly move to a smokey toasted malt. Hints of Tandy leather give an earthy hop finish. Not as funky as expected, but pretty hoppy and earthy. Saddle leather palate earthy. Pretty easy to drink considering the 8% abv. You would never guess the abv. without looking at the bottle."
"D- No thanks I'll pass."
"D: No thank you sir. If every sip tasted like the first, this would be a solid beer, but this unfortunately did not happen."
"not very drinkable...just not my favorite"
"Very drinkable. People put this down very easily and wanted more. That's a good sign."
"My expectations where met with another of my top active bottled beers for style."
"Drinkability: Fairly easy to kick back. Can be sipped or thrown back."
"Amber colored with a white head that retains pretty well. Smell is pretty good, I got a lot of horse blanket in it, as well as some earthy notes, and some spices. Taste unfortunately, did not have as much of the horse blanket, or much of what I find enjoyable, best thing to describe it was like Vick's green cough spray. I wanted to like the taste better, but I just kept being distracted by this flavor. Medium bodied and high carbonation. Don't know that I'd have this again."
"Pours off brown/orange/amber color, hazy, and light coloured head. Nose is miscellaneous soft fruit and spices, with a marshmallow scent as well. High carbonation is noted on the palate, with a soft malty core and sweet candy flavors. Finish is a tad warm and the candy sugar coming back again."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"drinkability is pretty good. nice balance. good overall, just not really fitting into the expected style parameters."
"This one had a gigantic, frothy beige head that produced big, chunky clumps of lacing. Semi-clear and a red/amber colour. The aroma was full of hops of the floral/soapy variety and there was a bit of fruity tartness, some sweetness, and faint earthy funk, perfume and jasmine. Bitterness was a bit assertive, but still nicely balanced. The flavour was very floral and perfumy, with many of the same characters that were in the aroma. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, decent texture. Pretty good overall, but outclassed by the other beers we enjoyed this evening."
"Pours a hazy copper orange, huge off white head forms, tons of lace on the glass, great retention, forms a solid layer. Smell is neat, sweet and spicy, fruits, musty grapes, grapefruit and orange peel, wood, very fragrant and perfumy, some jasmine, bit of funk, neat. Taste is similar, perfumy, floral, very spicy, jasmine tea bitterness, bit of funky woodiness, light fruits, interesting stuff, a bit astringent and drying in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodieed with medium carbonation, not too bad. From the name I was expecting more of a wild ale, but for a Belgian pale this had some pretty cool character to it. Thanks Russ!"
"taste is warming, lots of spice, apricot, peach, orange, and lemon, a touch of caramel, some hops, a few malts, end is dry and just a little bitter, aftertaste has a spiciness that lingers."
"D= Though I am not a big fan of sour ales, this was one of the more enjoyable ones I have had. The peppery spiciness saved this from being a one-trick sour pony. Could be a good gateway beer into the style."
"From a 22oz bottle - Pours a somewhat cloudy orange/red color with small quickly dissipating head. Average carbonation. Smells super sweet with plenty of bread and fruity yeast notes. First sip is very bready and biting with mild tartness. Extremely tasty. Great and welcomed bitter finish. Nice medium bodied."
"umm... Wow, the smokiness has changed to cigarette butts... Not even kidding. While the nose has gotten funkier and sweeter smelling, almost candy like, the flavor has, shall we say, developed. It still has the fruity front, but the smoky flavor that was once there has become more prominent and the aftertaste is straight ashtray. Not as bitter as before but not better. Still very interesting and complex flavors but good god..."
"This beer is curiously lackluster. Not bad in any particular way, but it really doesn't have any spark or zing to it. Pours a hazy orange amber with a nice head that sticks around. Smells very earthy and with a fairly big hit of dry malt. Tastes earthy as well, but fairly plain. Nice bitter finish, but no hoppy zing or Belgian yeast fruit and spice or candi sugar sweetness. Just sort of dry and bready with some earthy hops and fairly flat in flavor. Some spicy hops at the end that carry through in the mouthfeel, which is a bit rough around the edges. Not bad, but not memorable."
"The description of this beer on BA is ""Belgian Pale Ale."" Is that right? Doesn't taste like it to me."
"Bottle from Julio's, brought back by Jason. Cloudy orange with lots of white head, lots of lace after. Wierd aroma, but great control. Spiciness with a malted offset. Musty, a funky experience from the wild yeast but very good for what it is. This aroma may fall away with some ageing."
"Shared with a couple of friends over the weekend. Pours a dark copper color with a full champagne-like head into a snifter. Good retention. Smells of sweet carmel type candy with a good amount of mustiness to boot. With some warming you cna get more funk on the nose. Taste is sweet and malty at first. Finishes extremel dry with no aftertaste. I get some pheno/ bandaid flavor in the finish that intensifies as the beer warms. Good active, fizzy mouhtfeel. Solid wild ale, nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: A beer inspired by Orval as a homage of sorts, but certainly quite unique in its own right with a complex, zany array of flavors. Fairly decent overall."
"This is pretty good, but not spectacular. The nose is really complex and interesting, but that doesn't translate flavorwise as this tastes much more straightforward. For the price, I would hope for more."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Herbal, peppery, slightly tart up front. The malt base is very dry, but there's more bitterness than I'd like and not enough bretty funk or sourness. Like a rough, unrefined Orval with excessive bitterness. The finish is loaded with bitter herbal hops and dry husky grain. After half a glass all I could taste was bitterness - not terribly impressive. Most of the bottle went down the drain."
"Not sure I would seek this one out again."
"This almost has a Jekyll and Hyde flavor personality (thankfully the aroma is all nice, funky, goodness); up front it is quite fruity, smooth and tasty, but towards the finish it starts to get wild, harsh and phenolic. In the end I would balance this a bit more towards the pleasant notes; even in the finish there are solid, good tasting, flavor contributions, all of which ultimately save this from being un-enjoyable."
"D: Better than expected. This beer is meant to be consumed at warmer than cellar temps. I was able to pick up a lot of subtle details of this beer the warmer it got."
"Drinkablity is not to stellar at this point, just not too exciting or tasty, a bit thick, very bitter and lacking depth. For the price, you'd be better served to sit on these for a while. The cork had a nice pop, but the beer barely moved. I'd hope with some time under it's belt, it would overflow a bit!"
"Darker orange color with a long lasting foam, but it doesn't have the mountain-like froth of Orval. Aroma is pleasant, similar to Orval, but doesn't quite have the full aromatics of the original. Flavor is spot on in terms of the trappist pale style...this is a beer style hardly ever replicated because it's hard, but they nailed it, imo. Flavor is a lot like Orval, dry and hoppy, with a little touch of brett. I'm not crazy about the beer, but it's a good recipe and well brewed."
"I'm a bit confused by this one. I'm not sure what else to say."
