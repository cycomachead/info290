"Overall, this is a pretty damn nice beer.  It does not have an over-the-top, in-your-face presence.  However, it is smooth, somewhat complex, and easy to drink.  It may not be at the top of the list of Trappist ales, but you could do far, far worse than this brew."
"Smells as rich as it looks, with some leather, prune, and strong raisin scent on it.  Taste follows the same path, with a mild bready flavor on top.  Goes down nice and smooth with a small, yet soft and fluffy head.  Not a ton of complexity, but certainly delivers where it's needed.  Nothing to complain about with this Dutch take on the Trappist."

"Pours a murky brown-red, one finger of fizzy white foam, settles to a thin ring, a few dots trail down the glass. Was a foamer, lost 1/4 of the bottle. Smell: cooked pear, overripe nectarine, whiff of date bread, buttery note. Taste: lots of plum, dried dates, pear and spiciness and some vinous booziness in the finish. Building prickly yet overall subdued carbonation is really nice. Enjoyable."

"Unusual offering from La Trappe, with a yeasty, sherry taste - decent beer, but not really one for me."

"Almost juicy banana along with cane sugar and a subtle hop dryness, including dough wheat, which blends well into the malty body of the beer. The hops compliment to the sweeter body of the beer, not only by adding balancing bitterness, but also by giving the malts a bready characteristic, including a somehow chewy aspect to the otherwise smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with a noteable, lively carbonation, which brings out honey and raisins. This gets accompanied by a supportive bitterness, which leaves the palate a little earlier than the malts do."

"Isid'or pours a welcoming shade of golden brown, with a fizzy froth of vintage white sitting on top. The brew is somewhat murky, and more than adequately carbonated. From the nose, I am picking up lots of fruit esters, primarily plum... apple cinnamon, some phenols, and a bready malt character. The initial wave of flavor reveals a big molasses taste, with fig, moving onward to a very spicy, alcohol-laden ending, and a fair amount of sharp hops. The finish is smooth however, leaving a very wholesome grainy flavor on your tastebuds. Overall, very good, but could use some improvement in the balance department."

"Overall, this is a very good BPA although it fall a bit short of being outstanding. I love the fruitiness but the malt could be turned up a bit. All in all, though, a good beer."

"Not bad, though it's pretty obvious that I've held onto this bottle for too long. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are reminiscent of fruity yeast notes and sherry. Somewhat oxidised and with little bitterness. Body is OK. Goes down alright, but I reckon this is overly oxidised and not as the brewer intended. I may re-review in the future if I have the chance. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"750 ml. corked bottle. Pours an amber orange colour, with a small head that does not take much time to fade, but leaves a good lace and and a tiny layer on the surface. Smell of caramel, plums, raisins, cloves, apple and sugar. Medium carbonation, medium body, crispy texture. Tasteof caramel, oranges, sugar, plums, raisins, sugar and some spices."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/5/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, clove, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, clove, caramel, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"The price is right on this one as it was one of the cheaper Trappist beer selections but is not cheap on taste. Would certainly try this one again."
"Overall: A very sweet beer with lots of dried cherry/fruit notes, toasty caramel and brown sugarish malts. Very carbonated and warming. Nothing to really go out of your way for but I wouldn’t mind trying the oak aged version of this."

"330ml bottle. La Trappe Tasting Goblet. Cooper color, orangish amber to the light & cloudy appearance. Intense caramel malt & Belgian yeast aromas, orange hues, as well as biscuit, herbal, flowery & phenolic notes. Sweet mild toasted flavor & spiced touch at first sip. Medium to full body. Moderate to soft carbonation. Oily texture & kind warming & well integrated ABV. In the middle, fruity, delicate & low bitterness rounded by gentle notes of wood resolve in a very subtle citric zest astringency. Sweet/bitter finish. Fruity aftertaste & spicy hints. Refreshing, flavorful & suggested for a paused drink !!"
""
"Lots of caramel and sugar. Very sweet, but not tooth jarring. A bit of dark fruit. Lots of spice and yeast. Comes across as reminiscent of a weiss. Fairly easy drinking."
""
"A lot of heftiness and flavor coming at you, however, without being bold. A sturdy Belgian golden ale with a darker side."

"Overall / Drinkability: Definitely better as it warms up, as when first poured and cold I wasn't that impressed. That being said, I always feel like I'm missing something when I put a Trappist Ale in a chalice, that I'm not concentrating all the complex flavors properly and I'm missing something. However, this could be the point: the monks just want me to drink it and not obsess over it. It's just beer that they made for charitable activities. Or maybe it is more of a visual wow that they're looking for: Look at that glass! Now look at what is in it! So here's my conclusion. Great packaging, but the inside contents are just good, not great. I wouldn't mind having a bigger glass, but I'm okay with the fact that I just have a 11.2oz as well. So overall, I think above average, but not hugely so for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. There are better examples out there."
""

"Overall, an alright beer. Not one I'm likely to rush out to buy again, but I might have it again depending on the other options I had available to me. I can see this one being appealing to those who like Dubbels or other Belgian Dark Ales, as it seems to skirt the line between styles a little bit to me. Not as much on the dark fruits, but the overall profile is definitely different from many of the top-notch BSPAs I've sampled."

"The taste tends to have a higher bitterness than the aroma might suggest. There are upfront Belgian malts and pear or other fruit along with a moderate lingering after taste. It has its redeeming qualities."
""
"A birthday beer for me! On tap at Brass Tap Gainesville. Pours a cloudy copper with small creamy head. Aroma of plums and figs, candy sugar, and a bit of yeast. Flavor is big plums, and more plums. Wow straight up fruit flavor here with some candy sugar sweetness. Easy drinking with medium mouthfeel. Excellent beer, but not quite as good as the barrel aged version."

"I like this beer a lot. you should have one."
"Overall- A rather nice, tasty, and drier Belgian strong with just the right level of hop to compliment the flavors of the brew. Rather easy drinking and a good brew to try."

""

"O- Better than the Oak Aged (might be due to differences in age) and one of the better offerings from this gang of monks."
"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and wood flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but smells slightly better in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, dark copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, alcohol, slight spice, slight grass, and a hint of floral hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight hops, slight alcohol, and a hint of spice. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"overall hard beer to find, but well worth it!"
"A bit dry and dominated by brisk carbonation, this BSPA tends to maintain the basic characteristics of any of the other La Trappe ales I've sampled so far. I enjoyed it for what it is, there are really no faults to be found here, yet held up against other offerings of this style it does not really stand out from its peers. To put it bluntly, from my snobby opinion this is a well-crafted ale for the style, but at the same time isn't very memorable either. Chalk it up to an embarrassment of riches when it comes to selection."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours hazy copper with a thick, biege colored head that dissipates slowly. There are some visible streaming bubbles that can be seen along the side of the glass. Some lacing is left behind on the glass as the head retreats. The beer smells pretty malty with some mild sweetness and fruit, but the aroma is not strong. The flavor is of malt, light toffee, and banana. Some flavors of clove come out as the beer warms. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry, but the drinkability is high for a high ABV beer. This is an excellent beer."

"O: descent beer, flavor is solid, but not heavy. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. I enjoy it, but I would not pay $7 for the 11.2 oz. I would order if on tap for sure. Easy drinking and nice flavored, just not accessible."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a La Trappe chalice. Pours a medium red-orange amber with beautiful one finger fine white head with great retention and massive lacing. A very nice presentation in the La Trappe glass. Aroma of caramel malt, stone fruit, Belgian yeast and spicing; hints of banana and plum. Classic Belgian strong ale flavors, caramel malt, light and dark stone fruit, Belgian yeast, very light clove. Medium creamy body. A bit lighter in taste intensity compared to other Belgian pales, but very pleasant and well made."
""
"O: Nice. Love the bottle which feels like a work of art from a European gallery, and love that its Trappist. Feels like a more watery version of a Rochefort 6. Still love its authenticity and uniquenss. Would go well with spicy puddings, and mild to medium strong cheeses."

"This brew has surpassed a lot of the Belgians that I have tried in the past. It's super complex, tasty, and the flavors really mesh to create a balanced and complex brew."
""
""
""
"O-I don't know exactly what I would call this style, but it is Belgian, and it is amazing. It is such a wonderful flavor. Fairly complex. I could drink a lot of this. It is so tasty! I recommend this for anyone who likes Belgians!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a bottle into a tulip, hazy golden pour, very fizzy on the pour. It settles down, slight head, no lacing. Lots of phenols on the nose. The flavor is overpowered by the phenols, some alcohol, lingering alcohol on finish. The body is medium, light carbonation. IMO an underwhelming beer, pales in comparison to other belgians."
""
"O - a tasty Belgian ale, the pale ale aspects are a little subdued for my liking but a solid brew none the less that I am glad I came across"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good strong ale."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom 335 ml brown glass long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Overall: Really really good brew, the worst part about it is finishing it. I will definitely another when I see it again. Salud!"
""
""
""
"but whe is drinkable crispy and pleasant. Hats off the fellows add lasses who make such stuff of angels!"
"This isn't so bad that it isn't worth finishing. In some respects the flavors pulled together later on in the glass. Regardless, this is hardly worth $4.99 a pop."
""
"For a special anniversary offering Isid'or lacks the twinkle in its eye. Still, De Koningshoeven found a nice middle ground between elegance and playfulness (read: easy, casual drinking). It's effervescent enough to make a good 5 o'clock boost but works just as well as a late evening wind down; a large-size bottle of the stuff is better than a day at the spa. I'd be happy to finish all my stressful evenings off with it."
"One of the better BSPAs that I have encountered of late, and that's WITH the big sugary nature that just won't quit. The subtly of the Trappist name may be a tad challenged here, but it still passes quite easily - the yeast and fruit seemingly calling in favours to do so."
"This is a ""nice"" brew. Gentle - carbonated, but not too. Balanced, but sweet. It doesn't make magic the way the quad that was in the set does, but it holds up as a very good brew. It's a solid example of a ""bubblegum"" Belgian brew."
"The yeast is the main attraction in Isid'or. Very easy drinking and mellow...and quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty Belgian, solid flavour profile, and easily drinkable. The ABV is dangerously subtle and this is well worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"overall worth a try and i might buy this again"
""
""
"Candi-sugar sweetness also was on display in the flavor. Additionally, there was some caramel and toffee making it, to me, a bit dubbel-ish. I also detected some subtle hints of raisiny dark fruit. Solid, all in all. Thnx Thijs! Prosit!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear amber colour, about two fingers of white head, sticky with quite a bit of lace. Smell is of belgian yeast, fruity, greaan apple, spicy points, clove and a bit of alcohol along with a tiny bit of funk as well. Taste is quite yeasty and lightly sweet, a fair bit of malt charachter as well here, a little vinious and again lightly funky, quite fruity too. Light-Med carbonation, Med-Full body, really smooth with a great feel. Solid belgian pale here, something I could easily revist and probably will."
"Overall: It's a very nice beer, but not really what I'd expect from a brewery like La Trappe. It'd be really great if found at a nice local brewpub, but the taste is a little too watery to be outstanding despite its excellent execution of its apparence and mouthfeel. (3.5)"
""
""
"-Overall 4.5: This beer is a wonderful abbey ale and has so many subtle differences from any other abbey ale you may have had previously. The color alone is unique and worth buying the beer just to see it in your glass. The taste is excellent and is representative of the product of generations of master abbey brewers, men who have nothing else to do other than perfect their beers. This is an excellent brew and well worth tracking down."
""
""
"Overall - Nothing wrong with this one at all. A nice well rounded and very drinkable beer. Not the cream of the crop as far as trappists go, but very close. I'll buy more."
"If this were not a Trappist product, I don't think I would recommend it very highly simply because of that strong sweet taste up front. However, as it is ""special"" in the regard that it is a Trappist beer then I would not pass this up if you can find it."
""
""

"O- easily drinkable a touch to sweet IMO none the less very enjoyable for a 12 oz serving"
""
"4.0 D: Tasty, well rounded beer. No complaints."

"O: Enjoyable and easy to drink, especially for the style. The alcohol is well hidden and this is a good sipping beer."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep caramel color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of Belgian caramel malt with some sweet notes and some light fruity ester. Taste is also a mix between some Belgian caramel malt with some good notes of fruity ester and a balanced level of sweetness. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed with nice level of complexity and great level of drinkability."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Belgian Pale Ale style."
""
"Pouring out this opaquely hazed coppery amber brew creates a huge rush of craggy head and a nasal blast of peaches, bubblegum, pears, plums, brown sugars, flowers, and a touch of spicy yeast. Flavors include all of the elements from the nose with the addition of bready elements and a harder emphasis on the yeasty spice. Long lingering finish. Lighter texture and snappy carbonation. Very well made."
"O- Not too bad at all. Maybe a touch on the sweet side for my liking."
""
"Carbonation is too full on."
""
"(originally reviewed: 11-23-2011)"

"O: Great yeast, fruitiness tartness, light finish, heavy body...engaging combination. I'm a fan, and I'd recommend it to those who like beer, Belgian styles especially."

"Still the beer is of high quality, smooth and balanced, not likely to ever get a headache of this beer, it is just not special enough for a trappist."
"Poured into La Trappe glass. Pours a semi cloudy dark orangeish red, with a creamy white head. The retention is great and the lacing is significant. The aroma features mellow spices characteristic of Belgian yeast. Notes of banana and clove are present along with some candied grapes. The taste is similar to the nose, a bit on the mellow side, very well and delicately balanced. This is very easy drinking and enjoyable. The 7.5% abv is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, the carbonation is moderate. Overall, this brew is very enjoyable. Perhaps it is lacking in bold flavors, but for what it is, it is quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- total refresher. This one goes down so easy and the 7.5% doesn't rock ones head too much (seemingly). Tastes great but feels diluted after a second and a half. I only wish it could match the powerful and amazing aroma. Very glad to have had this one."
"Cheers"
""
"Hazy orange brown, with an offwhite head. A thick collar is left and some sparse retention. Nose has some banana, with big yeasty fruity esters. Some caramelized fruits and gentle breadiness. Taste moves more into dark fruit territory, plums and others similar fruits of the caramelized sort. Some yeast and dark bread character still. Medium full body, typical drying Belgian ale finish with some subtle spicing. Gentle carbonation. Somewhat complex, sits in a not-well defined area between a Belgian Strong Pale and Belgian Strong Dark - quite nice, I'd have this one again."
""
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Nice copper-amber pour with one finger head that quickly dissipates with decent lacing. Fruity, malty nose with hints of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, banana, and just a touch of bubblegum and oakiness. The fruitiness shines through in the taste as well with lots of pear, apple, and a bit of banana. Really solid malt backbone with hints of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but very smooth with just slightly chewy and syrupy. I tasted the oak aged version of this first and really thought I'd be let down with this version since the oaked was so amazing. But this one holds it's own and it's one of those beers that just screams to be put in a barrel. I'll definitely be picking up more of both of these incredible beers!"
"In short: a bit too sweet Belgian Ale with caramel & malted-wheat sweetness, spice and lemony esters. (330 ml, BB date 05/2014, into tulip.)"
""
"D: Pretty good and one that I would have again"
"Flows easily with food or conversation. This is just a great beer."

"Overall a solid Belgian ale - reminds me of a dubbel but not as strong. A malty treat that I can recommend."
""
""
"O: Very good overall, love the tart finish and huge sweet fruits"
""
"Overall, sort of an unusual beer. The apple flavour really sticks out. I could see some people being really into this beer. I like it, but it is not something I would be in the mood for all that often."
""
""
"O: Very nice Belgian style beer, though I can't help but think this is misclassified. It reminds me of a slightly toned down La Trappe Quad, which I guess makes sense. Is that what this is supposed to be? More drinkable due to lower abv, and I could drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"Overall quite good."
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the unique aroma and taste components. The esters were huge, and contrasted nicely with the synthetic, chemically phenols. This beer is Belgian through and through, but the finish was a bit souring for our liking. It isn’t entirely overpowering, but some persistence of some of the softer flavors would have helped balanced this beer in the end."
""
"Notes: A very well rounded beer and a solid amount of sweetness all the way through. Cheers."
"Overall a well made beer that is certainly worth having again. Nice balanced and nothing is overdone. Recommended."
""
""
""
"this isnt the best la trappe brew, but that said its still superior to many many others in this genre. pours a not fully clear glowing red color with a lovely belgian head into a leffe thick stem goblet. smell is very sweet, malty, and alcoholic. taste is quite tart, and way less sugary than the nose would suggest. a hop crispness washes over the mouth and leaves a delicate fizz on the tongue. belgian yeast notes trickle in and so does the sweetness in the aftertaste. chewing this flavor for awhile now. nice mouthfeel, to be expected in these beers, bright and clean. it aint the quad, but its delicious"

"I won’t be looking for this one again, but an interesting beer and imo a different spin on the Belgian Pale Ale than I’ve had before."
"This is a really nice beer that just doesn't move one way or another for flavor. It is also a bit too alcoholic for the subtle flavors therein. Still, it has that great Belgian yeast character...easy enough to drink."

"O: this beer 'wants to be a popstar', but it isn't."
"O - Very good. Love everything Konigshoven brews and this is no exception. Just damn good beer."
"D - nice for sampling from the 11.2 ounce size. Good for the now and then dip into the naturally sweeter Belgians."
"Pours an amber-caramel color with a great white head and plenty of lacing. The nose brings light fruit and some caramel. A bit of bread crust. The flavor adds in a fair amount of fruit. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a bit of alcohol and light bitterness. Nothing spectacular."
"D - I don't really know what to think about this one. It isn't much of a belgian pale ale, it seems more like an amberto me. The sugary malt is dominant and it really pages out any yeast and hop character. Drinkable, but not real exciting."
"O: This is a heavy beer. I like the flavor changes but the fruity ness was more on the semi sweet side."
"Overall Drinkability - Great beer. Would have again."
"This brew had caught my eye at my local shop the one day I was there. I was interested in trying this one because I like mostly everything that La Trappe puts out. This beer poured out as a slightly murky orange color. The head was decent but didn't lace the glass all that much. The smell of the beer was a little spicy but had more of a yeasty malt aroma to it. The flavor has some bread-like qualities with some light herbal notes as well. The mouthfeel is sooth and nicely carbonated. Overall I found this to be a pretty good Belgian Pale Ale."
"Some nice malt/sweet character and a decent toast/herb finish."
"O: Pretty good Belgian pale ale. It was easily drinkable, well balanced, and had enough alcohol to make it interesting. Worth price and would have it again."
"I must confess I haven’t had the original Isid’or, but the oak aged version is very good. A delicate caramel aroma matches the amber transparency which leans gold. An effervescent head lightly flows to the surface. Flavors are abundant starting with a mild hop bitterness, lingering into a smooth caramel mid with intricate notes of oak in the back, and finishes with a complex dark red fruit combination reminding me somewhat of raspberries. It might just be worth the $25 price tag, but a 4 pack of Rochefort 10 may have been more satisfying for a similar price."
"Overall I rate this a low 4. Doesn't compete with the big boys from Belgium."
"An enjoyable brew and done well. A tasty Belgian, if not a big bold one."
"The first beer in my quiet Saturday night in (4th June 2011)."
"Decent, and a good example of the style, though this reminds me why this is one of my least favorite Belgian styles. Still, worth a pour."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a tart carbonation and a pleasant dry finish. A nice brew that's satisfying but kind of falls a little flat in the long run. Tasty and one I'd try again but it is a little expensive at $4 a bottle, ouch! So it might be a while before I buy another."
"Very drinkable. Each sip has that surprising sharp fruitiness with a touch of sweetness. Long mellow aftertaste. I'll look for this on tap."
"O/D - Nice but weaker in all things I expected. Good but I wouldn't seek it out. They could have put a little more into this. It seemed mild for the ABV."
"Poured dark, burnt sienna with a nice finger of white head that retained well. Smell of light fruit and citrus. Tastes of rich caramel; light spice; light and dark fruits: pears, cantaloupes, raisins, plums; smooth and light, and nearly perfect to my palate. Medium body and some carbonation, highly pleasant and very drinkable."
"M: Medium to light mouthfeel with a perfect level of carbonation that tricks you into thinking it is thicker than it actually is. Possibly fermented a little hot as there is a slight nail polish flavor."
"Overall, it's very pleasant, but the flavor is not quite able to match the great aroma."
"D: good beer, not the most unique, in fact I'm not sure that I could pick it out from a crowd Trappist beers, but that shouldn't detract from it's drinkability. It's easy to drink and well balanced which counts for a lot."
"Overall very pleasant trappist, second only to Orval."
"Cloy and sweet. Rich, thick body with enough carbonation to prevent the beer from being syrupy. The malt flavor is strong enough to cover the alcohol which is lightly evident. There's a moderate bite of the Belgian yeast. With the exception of the nearly non-existent hop, it is a well balanced beer."
"a staple abbey from a staple abbey. Every beer i've had is rather good. But i would like to state that they seem to be a bit better on the european side of the water as quality goes. This one was spot on la trappe. Pour is murky dark apple with a small but thick head. Nose of belgian yeast plum and apple pie. The palate with a nice sweet toffee and almonds and clove. Not as malty in my recollect as the dubbel."
"Quite an average beer to be honest, no huge flaws but nothing worth praises"
"A really nice trappist."
"D - Easy to drink, more-so than others I've tried in the style. I wouldn't rush out to get this one again, but it's a good one to have on hand to use as an introduction to Belgian brews for a craft newbie."
"D: I think I'll buy a six-pack and keep it for special occasions. I graded drinkability 5, but I wouldn't be able to drink one after another. I don't even want to! Keep it exceptional!"
"Wine glass brought to the table. Hmmm. Well wine glass pour and I am met with an amber colored ale with a big foamy white head that hides quickly. Fruity aroma central! Pears, grapes and apples to name a few. A lot going on here. As fruity as it smells, the taste comes at me with a bitter smack to the palate followed with a light floral swallow. Lingering dark fruit aftertaste. Awesome. Dry mouthfeel with light carbonation. At 7.5% this drank very smoothly though I drank it slow to savor each and every sip. You should too. Great beer!"
"A great find, I've never seen this one before, and glad I got it. I look foward to the Quad tommorrow."
"It's remarkably drinkable, and the more it warms the more velvety and supple it becomes both in terms of mouthfeel and in flavor. It's a charming, delicately complex and sweetish sipper. It's almost sherry-like in a way, but not as rich or full. If I were to pair it with food I'd stay on the lighter side: soft cheeses with chewy bread, moules in white sauce with a hint of anise, sweet potatoes fried, roast pork, carrot soup - you get the picture. Well worth trying before it's gone!"
"Very drinkable, just a bit on the sweet side"
"Good stuff just like all La Trappe beers. Give it a try"
"D: Drinks really good. I could drink a bunch of these. Would buy again."
"This is a very drinkable ale and is enjoyable. Solid."
"Drinkabilty - Has just enough alcohol to keep it from getting any higher drinkabilty . This is pretty tasty and easy to drink. Love the sweet fruits and tart yeast. Really good, not world class but glad i tried it out."
"Not sure I would have more than one."
"A well made beer I think with lots of nice lacing. With a dry finish."
"The beer feels very smooth and is very easy to drink."
"Part of a gift pack with a gold rimmed glass. A hazed amber with a sizable off white head and decent lacing. Smell is sweet and malty with a Belgian fruitiness. Banana and funk predominate. Light , sweet malt and a floral hop presence. Taste is rich and malty with a carmel sweetness and mild but firm bitterness. Nice fruitiness running from banana to light fresh figs. A touch of pear. Finish is clean and dry with a bit of cork. Feel is velvety and full. More like a quad with a good amount of carbonation that is almost creamy. Quite drinkable even though the glass, feel, and taste encourage sipping. You just don't want to rush this one. Yum"
"D-- Different pale ale to me. Vanilla is interesting and quite different. Gets sweeter as it warms up and the alcohol becomes more obvious as well. Not so sure I would do more than one at a time with this. I like the differences as opposed to a US style Pale Ale but it is better colder than warmer as the alcohol is hidden better and not nearly as sweet. Would drink again though."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are pleasant, but a bit overwhelmed by the spice and alcohol at the end. Not bad, but not entirely interesting."
"Wholesome as liquid bread, this is a pleasure to drink and would pair nicely with roast beef or a thick slab of prime rib and roast potatoes."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite Trappist Ale, but I'd take this beer over a large majority of everything else that's out there."
"This brew pours a orange bread hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy,velvety looking head with a nice rim of lacing aswell,the smell is very bready with also strong hints of caramel,toffee and dried fruits,it has a nice creamy over medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and the has rich tastes of bread,toffee lots of caramel and finishes with a nice caramelized fig like sweet finish and overall ill have no trouble finishing the bottle but if your not into a sweet amber ale then this would not be for you but for me quite enjoyable."
"Appears an amber semid clouded crust of bread like hue...with a nice off white cream colored head. Fine Belgian style lacing coats the sides of the glass. Aroma contains toasted caramel malted barly with cherry/raisin/apple fruitiness going on. Hints of Belgian yesat spiciness blends in as well to form a unique BPA experience from the Netherlands lone Trappist brewery. Flavors slightly bitter roasted malts caramelized sugars flow with a fruity spicy mix of flavors. Caramelized apple/raisins with a slightly nutty spiced edge from the yeast. Effervescent carbonation kicks the medium bodied ale across the palate nicely. Overall this is a decent beer made for sipping on, glad I grabbed a gift pack with two bottles of Isid'or and Quad with an official glass."
"D - This is my favourite La Trappe beer and is recommended."
"This is a nice Belgian-style beer with substance and caramel malt flavor, equal noble hop character, and a subtle Belgian yeast hint sneaks in. A nice find worth a try if you prefer more mellow Belgian/yeast character."
"D: So easy to drink, hard to believe the abv. Actually pretty refreshing."
"Pours a nice clear copper color with smallish white head that laces ok. Nose is largely bready malt on top of some yeastiness, simple, but not bad by any means. Flavor is similarly simple, bready and yeasty, witha bit of depth added from some light fruity notes--pears, maybe some apple. Moderate mouthfeel, well-carbonated. Decent drink, sometimes the booze shines through a bit. Not a bad beer overall, though not something I'd grab on a regular basis."
"HV"
"Copper pour with a 1 finger, white head. The aroma is caramel, toffee, tree fruits, bubblegum, dry spices, and nuts. The flavor is dry and relatively clean with very mild Belgian esters, some subtly sweet bread and caramel malt and a touch of nutty tree fruits on the finish. Dry, medium body wit lots of carbonation."
"In all: A-, thumbs up."
"D) I really enjoyed this beer and will be certain to buy more (if I can find it...)"
"Not too inspiring, but definitely a solid brew."
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a nice head that hangs around for a while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The flavor has a nice caramel malty sweetness with some fruit, yeast spiciness, and a touch of alcohol. The body is medium with a nice bit of carbonation. Drinkability is fine, but I'm not sure that I'd have two in a row. Probably my favorite beer from La Trappe."
"drinkability: fabulous belgian ale."
"Overall, a good BPA but not something that I'll remember tomorrow. Just now available here in TX. Rotation - not memorable enough to make the rotation. Also, it's pricey so hurt by that. [N;N]"
"D - Smooth but becoming bitter towards the end which may be slightly offputting. Quite pleasant to drink though."
"A solid Strong Belgian Pale. Good flavour all around and not overbearing in any way."
"D - great. I could drink more. I might have rated it a bit highter, but you can pick up on the booziness a bit more than I'd expect. But if you like Trappists & other Koningshoeven brews, you'll probably like this or at least feel it's worth trying."
"Poured into a Koningshaeven chalice a opaque burnt orange almost brown with a one finger head. The scent has strong raisin and grapefruit notes. The alcohol scent is actually detected in the scent. The taste is rather bready with some rasin flavors mixed in. Not much of a hop bitterness that I can tell. Overall, this is an ok Belgian, but I wouldn't really call it a pale ale."
"High drinkability, overall very good."
"O/D: not bad at all, but a disappointment overall. I'm wishing I had tried one fresh first in order to have a comparison with my cellared version."
"Just try the beer if you can find it, and don't share it with any food. While I can think of a great many cheeses, desserts and mains that would work very well with this beer I would argue that it is meant to be savored as a meal itself."
"Drinkability: Good beer and sessionable, but maybe just a little too sweet."
"Flavor is big and fruity, with bananas, sweet bread, and clove leading the charge. Hops are faded, but show up in the finish to contribute a detectable bitterness that lingers well. Nice balance of spices and sweetness, but this beer does become slightly cloying after a while. Creamy-slick consistency to the medium body, with a bubbly carbonation level that perks up the tongue and allows the underlying complexity to really take hold. There's a lot going on in this beer, but it ultimately works. A great Trappiste ale, could fool even the most seasoned Belgian beer drinkers."
"Not bad, but I think we have come to expect more from Trappist brewers."
"With all the complexity and balance displayed here, I keep looking for those finite intangibles that make this beer premiere. But, in the end, there are none- it's only a good beer. Somewhat of a let down in the Trappist world."
"D - Very good beer, but lots of better belgian pale ales to choose from. The alc is also a bit in your face instead of chilled back in the mix for my tastes."
"Drinkability: Very good. All the elements are balanced well. This is one you want to drink all night."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, sugary, small gingerbread like maltiness, actually, quite mellow. In the taste, a gingerbread maltiness and a sugary balance to it. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malt and small sugar hints in the aftertaste."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink for this style because the alcohol is well hidden and there's a good balance between sweetness and bitterness."
"It is a solid pale ale, a somewhat unique one that has a bit different drinkability and mouthfeel characteristic than your standard Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"I will have to try this one next time when i am there in a bigger glass."
"This beer tastes good. I would seek it out again."
"D Good drinkable beer, but there are other Trappists that I would prefer to drink."
" D- This beer is a bit bland or mundane with the apple flavors the only thing that stands out."
"Only my second beer from the La Trappe family, but Isid'or, unilke the Quad, will bring me back to try other products of the family. Recommended."
"M/D: Alcohol noticeable, a bit down on carbonation, not enough in there to drink it often"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied. Refreshing it is because of the active carbonation, making it well drinkable."
"Nice no holds barred Belgian complex ale."
"D: The ABV is well hidden and the taste is good, but the overcarbonation makes it a one and done for me."
"Quite downable for all its sharp edges. Not a bad beer at all. I think the best offering I've had from Koningshoeven."
"Actually gets rather tiresome after a while. The phenolic bitterness is overwhelming when it's concerted, and I feel the heat in the body a little too much."
"yeasty complexity of a top notch Biere de Garde. Most of what comes through in the nose is present in the flavor profile, particularly the caramel. The finish is dry and lingering."
"D - Pleasant and easy to drink. This one would make a great start for those new to Belgians."
"Overall, best ""belgian style"" beer I have had in a long time (even though it is from the Netherlands). Awesome, must have beer for any beer geek. No question."
"I rested this foaming gusher for a week in my cellar, obtained from Premiere Gourmet. Tolerable yeasty aromas from the surving majority of the bottle. Beige coloured body and abundant bubbly head. Above-average mouthfeel, although alcohol stung my parched lips. Satisfying though still drying finish. A little cooca and vanilla in the yeast, nothing complicated. She is about right for the style, me thinks."
"Overall a solid Trappist beer, but not really an award winner. Still I would be glad to drink it anytime and I really enjoyed it."
"D - Don't like the cork stuff - in wine nor beer. I would like to try it again sometime with a bottle holding a non moldy cork."
"La Trappe, IMHO, is the ""less good"" Trappist. However, still a quite good beer."
"The beer pours a nice orange color with a white head. The aroma is strong Belgian yeast with some fruit, wheat and bubblegum. Very nice smelling. The flavor is very similar with the bubblegum and fruit being fairly strong. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall, a very nice, classic trappist brew. Not too heavy, not too light, massive flavor while maintaining solid drinkability and authentic trappist character. A great example of trappist brewing, and a fine beer. Very enjoyable."
"D: I liked this effort, sort of a Trappist session beer, and more of a dubbel/Chimay Red type brew instead of a BPA, in fact it reminded me a lot of that beer."
"Taste is nice and dry very smooth and crisp. Really sharp an tasty and easy to drink worth trying."
"This is a bit disappointing, despite the fact that I wasn't really expecting too much from it to begin with. It might really benefit from some age, which would hopefully diminish the metallic note. This isn't overly complex either, and I truthfully don't know if age will really improve this much (but it will change it)."
"Very good, but not great."
"Conclusion: Don't get me wrong; this is a tasty Belgian; just not quite what I was expecting from a Trappist brewery brewing a special-edition beer."
"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed lighter amber shade with some burnt orange tinge to it,a large fluffy white crown atop that left broken chunks of lace behind as it settled slowly.Bubble gum was the main thing I got in the nose,a bit of phenolic spice as well.Flavors are decent but one dimensional in the medicinal hop,and bubble gum notes,there is a some caramel malt and pear-like flavors that come in but they dont compete with the medicinal qualities.Its a good beer (not worth $11.99)but not great,someone who like Belgian hops and phenols would be more inclined to like this beer."
"Very tasty Belgian pale; certainly one of the better I've had. Very well balanced and alcohol well hidden. The first beer of Koningshoeven I have tried and I am pleasantly surprised."
"M: Medium to full-bodied, this beer is a stepping stone to Trappist ales. Very tasty, easy to drink, and flaavorful. From start ro finish, it's a very good beer."
"D: I tried this last week and Max's and wasn't impressed. That must have been alcohol fatigue because I really am enjoying this bottle."
"My first sample of this Dutch company's offerings and I have to say that this was a good brew that i'd be willing to revisit."
"D- Goes down smooth. The concept of fusel alcohols make me consider the prospect of a headache to come..."
"Had this beer on-tap at a 2 Amy's pizza restaurant in DC. I was pleasantly surprised that they had such a great brew available, and it was only $7/glass. The appearance was a nice caramel color, with redish/pink undertones. The taste was excellent! Lots of juicy fruit, bread, and sugar. The main flavor that kept coming through for me was cherry. I would have thought it was some kind of cherry beer if I didn't know otherwise. I would definitely have this beer again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good Belgian Pale."
"D: Very nice drinkability, the 7.5%abv is nicely hidden behind a luscious malty body that makes this go down with much ease and delight. You can hardly go wrong with a trappist product."
"Cheers!"
"A dessert beer, and a real treat."
"D - Very nice drinkable beer. The ABV isn't too high and the flvaors are just right."
"Taste is bready yeast with a bit of dark fruit and a surprisingly high amount of alcohol for a meager 7.5% ale. Caramely malt with a definite candi sugar flavor. A touch of toasty malt and a kiss of hops give it a little bit of bittering on the finish. Body is a bit thin, it just doesn't have a whole lot of heft to it. Not a bad brew by any means, but this has been my least favorite Trappist beers, perhaps the Dutch cannot quite hang with the monks from Belgium."
"Opinion: Well, obviously I really liked this beer. If it truly is a ""Belgian Pale", then I think that this is probably the best one that I have had to date (Is Orval REALLY a Belgian Pale?). It has a very well blended and refined flavor that makes it easy to drink, yet substantial enough to make you take your time with it. I will give it pretty high marks for my review, and that is because I am reviewing it against other examples of this style. I would not drink this beer all the time, and I would take other styles over it...but if you tell me that all you have is a cooler full of Belgian Pale Ale (Like that would happen), I would probably reach for this one first now."
"Overall this reminds me more of a Tripel than a BPA - a unique and flavorful example of the style - very much worth a try if you run across it."
"Book says Belgian pale ale, but the look says anything but. Pour is a brownish orange with an appropriately big white head. Aroma is quite solid, lots of passion fruit and light citrus mixed with Belgian sugars. Taste is not as sharp as expected, some pear and fig in there with some light fruit. But it misses that bite that I like in Belgian golds. Finishes light like a decent American pale ale. Overall a solid brew, but not one to search out."
"D - This is a pretty good brew. I expected more from an Anniversary beer, but it was still quite tasty."
"Cheers"
"Thanks Netherlands, this is a good beer."
"D: A nice Belgian Pale Ale. Maybe a bit too strong for the style, but definitely nice. I really enjoy the style however. The yeastiness may be a bit toned down for some as well. Overall, this is a solid BPA and worth a try. I would like to see the price (10 bucks a bottle)a bit lower though."
"Drinkability is high. I'm really loving this beer, killer!"
"750ml bottle $10.49, I feel cheated. Hazy orange color, the head sucks, ha! It smells like funky fruits, belgian yeast, interesting. the taste is more of the same, weird fruits but not sour, maybe a bit of apple in the aftertaste, odd. This was an odd trappist beer, I would have rather had the dubbel."
"Overall it's a nice example of the style, worthy of a try, probably not again."
"D) Easy drinking, but definitely Belgian. A very pleasant sipper."
"Belgian style bomber, caged and corked, $10.99 @ DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Happy 125th birthday Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V., this one pours cloudy light brown/orangy amber, the lighter tan head is initially fluffy and about 3/4 inch in height, slowly the fade begins, very slowly, the head remains frothy and puffy, leaving a thick film, an ample collar and elongated bands of thick, sticky lace. Orangy, fruity nose with minty bubblegum also shining through. Fairly complex Belgian, with notes of more minty bubblegum, plenty of fruit, sweet malts and Belgian spice. On the sweet side of the street, tasty and warming none the less. Nice offering from the monks of La Trappe."
"Very refreshing beer. Wish they would make this a year-round beer."
"OVERALL: Pretty good brew by La Trappe. The mouthfeel detracts a bit from this one, but it might rival their Quad for best offering. Give it a try if you find it."
"Pours pale amber with slize haze, and enormous white head. Plenty of carbonation! And the carbonation is noticeable on the palate as well, giving a pleasant effervescence. Nose has some bread and peach skin in the aroma. Palate has a lot of yeasty/bready flavors, mouth tingling soft spices, and a soft biscuity to caramel like malt sweetness. Easy drinking."
"D: This is a really nice beer. To bad it's only brewed once. If you get your hands on one - buy it, drink it and enjoy!"
"Overall, I thought this was a quality Belgian beer and I would love to have it again. Too bad its fairly limited and hard to come by. I can imagine this being a great summer beer while you're kicking back and relaxing outside."
"Overall it's not bad. I don't know if I'd pick it up again, but it was worth a try."
"""Trappist"" isn't really a style of beer of course, but I still felt this didn't have a Trappist vibe to it. Very odd altogether."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this Belgian Pale Ale. If you find it on draft, order up!! This one is a real treat."
"Okay, maybe its the geek I try to suppress, but I was very excited to try this beer, mostly because it just sounded old and important. I was not disappointed. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a short, creamy white head. Some lacing in the tulip glass. Dank, fruity aroma reminiscent of a trippel. Apples, pears, clove, spice, and sweet yeast. Direct is not always bad. Lively mouthfeel adds to the taste. Long finish. Very, very nice flavor. Smooth, spiced fruit and pale malt character draws you in. Mostly sweeter spices, but a touch of white pepper. Plays well with the white apple and tangy fruit. Warming finish. A great long-sipper that makes you sad when the bottle is empty."
"Served in a tulip. Poured a light, hazy plum with a half inch off-white cap that dissipates into a think slick of foam. Nose is mild - earthy, herbal and a little minty. Taste follows nose; however, some candi sugar comes out in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively effervescence. I fell in love with this beer as soon as I tried it. It's exceptional and unfortunate that it's limited. That being said, I think I preferred the bottle to the draft."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice Belgian-style beer with substance and flavor that make it worth drinking for a while."
"This is nicely drinkable, but watch out for that 7.50%abv, it'll sneak up on you, quickly."
"Taste is sweet and fruity and has a heavy malt base. A very light hoppiness. Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky. This appears to be a light version of the quadrupel and is a nice addition to the La Trappe range."
"If this were available to me on tap regularly, I would drink it regularly. Very nice."
"Hazy pale amber with a 3/4"" off-white head that settles down to a good thick cover. Traces of lace here and there. Aroma definitely has some bananas in, mild belgian spice, mild malty sweetness comes through with a hint of apple skins. Not a terribly complex aroma, but nice. Flavor picks up a bit more than the aroma, initial taste is a forward malt sweetness with faint flavors of oranges and bananas. As the flavor progresses the hops come forward, earthy and a little citric. The finish is very intense, full of big caramel and bitter hops, spicy cinnamon-clove. Long after the swallow I'm still tasting some tannic apple skin and vanilla caramel. Mouthfeel is very nice, rich and smooth, the carbonation is soft and keeps everything light and easy drinking. This drinks just like a 7.5% should, nice and easy, smooth with a hint of warmth. Very tasty, disappointing aroma is saved by an otherwise excellent drinking experience."
"Draught at Churchkey. Slightly cloudy amber colored with a very thin light tan head and not much lacing. Aroma of caramel and nutmeg. Taste is mostly malts with a subtle background of spice. Body was a bit on the thin side. No noticeable finish. Nice enough, but not very complex."
"Drinkability: this beer was very easy to drink and was overall very enjoyable."
"Great, well-rounded flavors with a blend of honey, caramel, fresh bread (and bread yeast-like). There's some of the spice character but the clove is relatively muted. Mild floral character with rose water. Solid, this finishes mildly drying with a nice, spicy, yeasty character. Mildly overcarbonated, this fact hurts the mouthfeel, creating a unwelcome sharpness. Medium-light in body, this finishes great, and is enjoyable. Good stuff!"
"So far my pick of the La Trappe family. Looks fantastic with a some serious carbonation, a cheesecake lookin head (if you know what I mean), solid and meaty. Nice, hazy sunburst orange. Some fruity esters mixed in with bready malt and some sticky pudding vibes. Caramel brittle, and some sweet yeastiness on the palate. This is very drinkable. Alcohol touch is only light. A great lasting finish. This is a pretty damn good beer, plus at $8 for a 750ml this is insanely cheap."
"Overall this is a solid beer on the darker side of Belgian Pales. Easy-drinking and worth a shot."
"Notes: A nice surprise to find on tap the Beer Engine, this place is incredible!"
"Flavor follows the nose, smooth and somewhat rich, yet disparate from its initaial association with a tripel at this point. Nice perky carbonation helps this along. Becomes a bit thin in body after some time yet remaining very drinkable. Alas, an amber triple or a light dubbel. A manageable and drinkable Belgian of moderate strength and character that is enjoyable with or without food and which offers many subtleties."
"Medium body with a good balance of spice, earthy notes, malt backbone, dark and light fruits and sweet alcohol. Clove, pepper and cinnamon spice up front followed by a nice malt backbone with hints of candi sugar, apple, raisin and plum. There is also a slight medicinal syrupy note but it is not overwhelming and actually blends well with the other flavors. The alcohol is noticeable but still pretty well masked at 7.5% making it pretty drinkable. This is a pretty complex beer with some unique flavors and I will definitely be drinking a lot more of this in the future."
"I really like this beer. Not an Orval clone by any means, but if you like Orval then this will also be a treat. Something I highly recommend."
"Pours deep amber with fluffy white head. Smell is rich clove and cinnamon, like a spiced peach. Flavor is carmelly, strong yet delicate, with apricot and pineapple, lightly phenolic and spicy. Mouthfeel is sparkly and carbonated."
"D - Pretty high for the style. This is a very nice beer overall."
"M/D: Slightly bitter character in the finish the is juxtaposed nicely against the sweet flavors the comprise most of the flavor. The beer is medium bodied with the ample carbonation that you would expect from a BPA. It leaves the palate feeling fresh and crisp. Delicious and flavorful, the alcohol provides a nice bit of warmth to usher in the fall."
"The beer poured a slightly hazy, deep copper (with a thick, creamy white head) into a chalice. There was a distinct aroma of Belgian yeast (banana/clove) and fruity esters - what you'd expect in an authentic Belgian ale. More of the bubble-gum Belgian yeast component in the flavor profile, with a nice tart (cherry?) component, and a clean bitter hop finish. A slightly fizzy mouthfeel which brought out and blended all the flavor components together nicely. Heavy Brussel's lacing down the glass. Overall, a nicely balanced and flavorful Belgian ale, true to to style, with its high ABV disguised well."
"This beer poured a murky copper amber color and formed a light tan foamy head the left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast and spices. The flavor was of malt, orange, spices and a hint of pepper. The body was medium light and slightly silky. The finish was sweet yet sprite."
"drinkability: nice"
"Drinkability: This is very drinkable. I could easily have had a second one (and almost did). I will return to this beer again if I ever have the chance."
"I would thing this a BSPA.... hands down.. too much going on for a standard Belgian Pale... but what do I know? Good stuff for sure... I am gonna get these while I can.. I think a bit of time in the bottle will help.. but Isid'or is pretty nice right now... I want another glass.. but Brenda polished off the remnants.."
"Overall a decent brew. One of the reasons I like La Trappe/Koningshoeven is that they seem more willing to do one off beers like this. Not a trait the Trappist brewers on the Belgian side of the border seem to share."
"Ordered a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $7. Served in a chalice it appears light amber with a slight haze. Man, this is a delicious beer. The flavor is a subtle mix of lemon peel, vanilla, white pepper, sweet candy bread, and white grape. The spices are very mellow, but the flavors are deep. The body is very drinkable and if it weren't a little expensive I'd order another."
"Excellent."
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but nevertheless, this is a pretty solid Belgian pale ale."
"As a one off batch it was nice to try once, but I prefer their Quad & Dubbel more."
"The body is what makes this a little extra special. Really nice silky body, coats the mouth and tongue. Very very pleasant. With the 7.5 abv, and a body like this, I could potentially drink this beer all evening. Quite enjoyable."
"I had this beer from a bottle this evening while awaiting some friends. It poured a nice tan color with some red highlights. The nose was like a good bier de garde, which I was not expecting, though it was a pleasant surprise. The taste was reminiscent of Gavroche for me, but a little bit more spice in the back of the palate. Mouthfeel was smooth and excellent, you can roll the beer pleasantly around. Overall a highly drinkable 7.5% Belgian. Get it while you can."
"Make sure you try one soon as this batch should be a one-off production and most likely just available in Holland, the homecountry of this monastery/brewery. Not sure how many bottles will be produced."
"Overall a very good Dutch beer, especially for the summer period. One of my favourite La Trappe beers already (although not better than the la Trappe Quadruppel). I hope that the la Trappe brewery will decide to brew this beer also in the future!"
"When they say ""jubilee beer," I think they mean amber, cuz it pours amber. Big fluffy head with an effortless pour - nice. Smells wonderful. Belgian yeast qualities dominate - very clovy, a bit buttery and peppery, candied sugar. I was expecting a sweet taste, but no, excellently balanced - starts a bit bitter, has some caramelly sweetness, and then a long dry finish. Not as complex as the nose suggested, but nice. Pretty high carbonation, but not out of the ordinary for a belgian ale. Very drinkable. This is the kind of beer that can pair well with almost any dish - it's balanced, not terribly complex, not too heavy, but not watery. I like it. I don't know when it will be released on the large scale but It's definitely worth a try."
