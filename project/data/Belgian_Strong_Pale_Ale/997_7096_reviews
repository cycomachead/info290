"A bright beer. Bright in the glass, bright on your tongue, bright on the palate, and bright in the finish. Its got a great round mouthfeel, with a sweet yet bitter flavor. well done."

"Let me first say that my rating is biased by nostalgia for the first time I had Ozzy, the predecessor the Beazly, in Baltimore, MD. I was at a fantastic bar and was interested in the local brews and choose the Ozzy based solely on the type of beer it was. My expectations were normal, for a beer enthusiast that is. It was poured for me out of a can.  I was surprised by how good it was! Since then, I made a trip to Brewer's Art in Baltimore and enjoyed the beer again on tap in their marvelous cellar atmosphere. It felt very right. The beer is exquisite. Even now that Ozzy has been rebranded as Beazly, the look, smell, taste, feel and might I mention nostalgia remain the same. It is a great belgian style pale ale and always a refreshing delight to enjoy. I highly recommend. Do not be turned off by its container - a can is more environmentally sound, protects it better from UV, and when poured into a glass does not take away from the experience. Overall: it is a fantastic beer."

"Overall (4/5): Beazly/Ozzy is a very good, easy-drinking Belgian-style pale ale that works in quite a bit of complexity. I particularly like how it goes from fruity to slightly bitter/grassy to earthy and dry in the finish. Good transition of flavors. I do wish that this beer was slightly more carbonated. After it sits in the glass for a while (we're talking 45 mins.), it tastes flat and still. This can EASILY be remedied, so I'm hoping the good folks at Brewer's Art do so."

"O: A tasty beer overall the phenols are kept in check even though the yeast is the star in this beer. The hop character comes through more so when it warms up and it gets more drinkable."

"Overall, this beer isn't a winner. The aroma and appearance thought this would be an out of the park home run, but the taste and mouthfeel left me disappointed. Brewer's Art makes much better stuff."
"O - Didn't know what to expect with this brew and was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't taste like anything I've had before. Definitely a kludge of styles. Thumbs up."

"O/D - Good stuff. Nailed the style in the ways that I wanted it to. Dangerously drinkable. Strong Belgian Pale Ales don't need to be really complex or over the top, just have the requisite components that have made this style world famous. This was better than most North American takes on the style."

"A well made Belgian brew that is packaged in a cool can with a fist."

"Taste also shows alot of yeasty phenols - banana, papaya, pepper and cloves. The malt is light...maybe some biscuits and the hops have a nice little snap of bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is a little less lively than, say a Duvel, but it is hearty enough with a nice creaminess. Easy to drink Belgian style brew...one of the better American made versions...and in a can!"

"Revisited my review when having the beer again, and yes, right on. For a beer that you can find for $9.99 a six this is an absolutely awesome beer. Will be a regular in my fridge for sharing with those who want to experience a Belgian."

"D: not bad, not great. finding this very middle of the road. wish I knew what this crap was sitting at the bottom of my glass. working past that, this thing still doesn't have anything that really grabs me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I like this one a lot. It's vibrant and tasty while remaining fairly approachable - perhaps because it's a bit less phenolic than some other Belgian-style pales. A fruity, dry, and drinkable winner."
""
""
"I thought that it was going to be like duvel since the description said it was their answer to it. Didn't have much of a smell. served in a chimay like goblet glass. Touch of apple on the nose, some alcohol, and malt. half-one finger head. For me it didn't feel like a belgian strong ale. It tasted more of a saison with a boozy bite to it. That didn't mean the beer was bad but it was not described properly. Would I get it again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm always skeptical of any Belgian-style ale in a can - they always seem syrupy and strange. This, however, really does a deft job of skating around the fact that it's not bottle conditioned by successfully pulling off a sweeter, more cidery bend. Even better, it keeps the epic drinkability I look for from the style. It's not quite Duvel, but I reckon it's as good as a canned BSPA can get."

"12oz can. Clear gold with a finger of fizzy white head that leaves patches swathes of lacing behind. The aroma is mix of sweetness, fruit and spice. This is quite zippy in the nose. The taste is similar. Bready sugars, fruit (getting a good bit of tart apple) and spicy throughout. The finish is especially dry and spicy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp and lively feel to the carbonation that pops in the mouth. There is a little alcohol here. I’ve always thought that Ozzy was a decent beer but I’m happy to see that you can now enjoy it in a 12oz portion instead of having to commit to a 750ml bottle. This translated to the canned packaging well."
"Overall this is an interesting beer but it's a little too sweet for me. I agree with another BA that the ABV seems higher than the label indicates"
""
""
""
"A flavorful, complex devil beer that is a delight to drink. Seems the ABV is a bit higher than advertised. The alcohol, strong spice, and good amount of hops makes this a strong ale that takes the palate for a serious, tasty ride."
""

""
""
""

"o: Deliciously simple and a bargain to boot. A case purchase is imminent for sure. I wonder if a little something was lost without the bottle conditioning? I need to buy a bottle some time to find out."

"The Crack once more revealed a brimful CANtainer and I CANnot hold back my joy at this seeming trend among craft CANners! An inverted Glug later and we were on a roll. I had a solid finger of rocky bone-white head that boiled and bubbled like any good witch's brew and slowly fell, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and suddenly King Midas and Croesus were wrestling with me, not over the beer, but over our new favorite Nebraska native, Val MidWest! Nose was spicy, but not from adjuncts, but undoubtedly from the yeast, which also imparted a pleasant mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was a CANglomeration between JuicyFruit and Big Red gum. It was mixed fruity, but also hot and spicy! Jeez-O, man, I may need a lay-down after this one. The lacing that had begun to appear was going to require a jackhammer to remove and I just returned my rental the other day. My mind is starting to smooth out and this is not helping! In fact, it may be paving the way. Finish was dry, thanks to the yeast having done its job in a big way. I'm done."
"Overall I really like this coming from the can, great flavors and BSPA qualities, just missing a bit more malt flavoring in taste."
"The dry yeasty finish is quite pleasant, and not overly dry. Even some honey taste. It seems like a nice balance of yeast flavors-- the bitterness, fruit, and dry sensation. From the 750 ml corked bottle bought at Whole Foods in Washington, DC."

"Overall it's pretty good BSPA, it could use a little more body, but that's a minor knock."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is fruity, sweet, some malts. Taste is the same, but milder, still fruits, some hops and malts, alcohol is well hidden. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable and good quality beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a very nice clear golden color. The head was fluffy and white with a thin retention and decent lacing. The smell of the beer is floral, fruity and very bready. The taste of the beer was a little metallic up front, the more you have the less of that you get. The beer has a nice bready sweetness with a banana-like fruit flavor. The hops give this a nice balanced bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a good body and carbonation. Overall this beer was really quite good. I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be really good."
""

"Cheers!"

"Insanely smooth and easy drinking. Overall a fantastic BSPA!"

"overall, I am buying shitloads of this one. my new favorite. Also, it is now available in cans!"

"O- A very enjoyable, above average Belgian style offering."
""
""

"Glad to see this on tap, as a full bottle would be a little much for me. Golden colored pour, pristine clarity, topped with a small, rocky, white head; low retention and just a bit of lacing at first. Quite Belgian in the nose, bready yeast, light spice, herbal hop notes. Taste of toasted cereal grains, Belgian yeast with fruit ester undertones, grassy, peppery spice. Light body, pretty easily drinkable, but nothing amazing. Not really sure what this beer has to do with Ozzy, unless it's a ""prince of darkness"" reference or something."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates slowly. Smells of sweet and candy sugar with a hint of citrus and a bit of light caramel, pepper and spice. The flavor is malty sweet with sweet sugars up front that are sandwiched between tangerine and orange peel. Light pepper and spice with a hint of yeasty funk before a sweet lingering finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice Belgian ale, a bit sweet and fruity but so easy to drink."
""
""
"O- A nice easy drinking beer. Worth seeking out. I will definitely pick this up again."
"Poured a clearish gold with good head that stuck around forever. Had a decent aroma of yeastiness, touch of orange and citric and bitter hops, tad bit of fruit and some sweet sugary malts. Easy to drink, has a mix of sweet and tart fruit as well as some spiceiness for a little kick. A bit on the plush, juicy side with a filling mouth, can't really pinpoint the fruits other than something like apple/pear and a touch of tropical as well. Some sweet malt as well but ultimately finishes dry with a crisp kick and is an excellent beer to relax with on a terribly hot summer day."

"O: Another great Belgian beer by Brewer’s art. I liked this more on tap than the bottle."
""
""
""
"Notes: flavors are spot on, but the mouthfeel gets a little cloying after a few sips. Decent, but not Duvel."
"D-overall this was a good BSPA but it wasn't as good as i hoped. I had really high hopes for this one but it just wasn't balanced enough for me. the spices and hops and champagne flavors just didn't mesh as well as i hoped. it was still an easy drinker but not the mind blowing flavors and complexity that i had hoped."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow. A good amount of white frothy head. Very pretty. Smells yeasty and lightly flowery. Hops are barely detectable on the nose. Tastes sweet and little citrusy. Floral flavors coupled with some nice hoppiness. The sweetness masks the bitterness of the hops well. Good carbonation. Solid mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable"
"Again I say, this has got to be one of the better American versions of a Belgian Strong Golden Ale available. Enough complexity that I would want to buy again and I think that this has great potential for interesting food pairings. I have had the entire bottle in one sitting and I think I now know why these beers are considered ""devilish""..."
"Appearance is a light gold color with a bright white head. The first pour with the pressure from the cork, left two fingers of it. Ozzy has a nose with spices, belgian yeast, malts and citrus. It is very pleasant and balanced. The taste has more malts, caramel, some hops, lemon and grass. MF is medium and nice carbonation level from this bottle. From the U.S. produced BSPAs that I have had the opportunity to try. this was one of the best."
"O- This one was a great introduction to Brewer's Art. If it was available to me, I would snatch it up for dinner parties as a wine alternative. It was easy to drink, and the abv makes its accessible in somewhat larger quantities. This is one of the first Belgian golden ales I have really enjoyed. Nicely done!"
"Notes: I was looking forward to try this one for a while but since it is not particularly a style I´m after I was setting it aside, and setting it aside… That was quite a mistake, this is very quaffable, rich and pleasing, and makes for a great quality social brew. Regional touch to it, and if for people getting the nod to Black Sabbath-Osborne it even adds an extra nice touch to it."
"D - If didn't already know this one was from Baltimore, MD, I would have truly mistaken this for an authentic Belgian brewed pale ale... Worthy for all BAs to seek out, this one comes highly recommend... Next trip to MD, I'll be stocking up on a couple of these bottles... This one goes down easy gulp after gulp..."
"This beer flat out kicks ass. I'm putting it on my wants."
"Medium bodied and fuller than I expected with lots of tight carbonation and earthy, bitter hops up front that linger throughout into a dry finish. Well balanced with a good bit of earthy, tart flavor countered by zesty spice, light fruit, sweet alcohol and dry champagne yeast effervescence. Hints of pepper and clove as well as some apple, pear, grass, straw and alcohol. Similar to Duvel but not quite as good with a fuller body, stronger hop presence and less alcohol bite. It has more of a spicy and herbal presence than I prefer and all of the flavors are a bit much. Pretty good and easy to drink but it could be a bit more balanced."
"All these factors make for very high drinkability. Excellent beer glad I bought it. Will buy/have again."
" The BSPA was a joy to savor, I found this to be the most intriguing ales of the night at Brewer's Art, the hop flavor works so well with the yeast with the dry finsish and moderately strong alcohol -a very quenching beer w/ lots of hops much like a Belgian IPA. This is a class act."
"Uh, is there any way to sublet our souls to be able to drink this beer on a regular basis? Sure, it ranks very well within the ""Devil Beer"" realm, but it comes across more like a Belgian IPA / Devil Beer hybrid, which makes us salivate that much more. Dangerously drinkable. Another glass, please."
"D - Light and easy to drink."
"F: Finishes very dry again, with a touch of bitterness from more hops and some of the spices. Some lingering Belgian golden malts and light fruit. A light lingering off bitterness though that isn't as pleasant as the rest of the beer, but it's not too bad. It drinks very well too, especially for 7.25% abv, and pretty dry."
"I loved the place and look forward to trying other offerings."
"-notes from 02/06"
"Golden liquid bread, nice golden glow in the glass, smells like fresh bread with something spicey on top, good lacing with perfect carbonation. Improved as it warmed to room temp. Just a little sense of the alchohol, not objectionable tho. Will be buying this again most definatly."
"Overall just solid as could be. Love the style and it was super drinkable. Nothing at all to complain about here."
"d - A pretty good Belgian. I enjoyed the citrus fruit in the taste and thought the spices and yeast made for a typical Belgian style beer. Would try again."
"Pours a pale golden color, nice and clear, lots of bubbles, bubbles rising up through the beer from the pour to the last sip. Nice looking. The final pour yields a little haze (I split this one into a couple pours). A nice looking beer. The smell is great. Powdery milled grains, a little spice and grassiness. Lemongrass and herbs are strong, very leafy. But also the pale grains are nice, crackery, a little bready. The taste is good. A very nice malty sweetness hits the tongue first, along with a pleasant fruity flavor and some peppery yeast. Then you start to get this spicy, herbal leafiness. As it warms, the herbal flavors start to come alive more, and mix in well with the dry crackery flavors. The yeast character is also very nice, provides excellent dryness, almost a little chalky/powdery, with a nice spice. The body is a nice medium thin, with a good bite of carbonation - it bites as you swallow a bit. The alcohol sort of slowly gets to you (I'm glad I shared a bit with my roomate), but I really really enjoyed this. A very nice take on a belgian style beer brewed stateside and a nice beer that I would've never tried otherwise. Thanks Paul."
"Thanks Chad for the trade was a great way to kick off the trip to WBF Raleigh 2010"
"The beer looks really good, clear golden pilsner appearance but with a large rocky dry-looking foam. The taste is sweeter than Duvel, otherwise it tends to mimic the profile. The finish is somewhat dry, and it's hard to notice the alcohol."
"There is a slight aftertaste with this beer that grows. Its cereal and not pleasant unfortunately. There is some sweetness and good yeast character coming through. Some estery components. It finishes a little dry. Overall its OK. Its not Duvel."
"D: An okay version of the style."
"Overall this is quite an enjoyable Belgian Strong Pale Ale that can give its Belgian brethren a run for their money. Recommended."
"Drinkability is quite good, a very nice blonde. The went great with burritos, and stood strongly on it own as well."
"Really nice and wonderfully drinkable. I've really enjoyed all the beers I've had rom Brewers Art."
"D: dangerously drinkable, excellent flavor and aroma. while alcohol character is fairly muted, its effects are not felt until standing up."
"Good beer, good drinking."
"Overall, a pretty solid shot at the style on the part of the Brewer's Art and I'm happy I got to try an offering from a brewery I've never tried before. That being said, it was a bit overly sweet for the style in my opinion and there are other examples I'd turn to first when seeking out a belgian pale ale."
"A 750ml corked bottle shared with psycohops. Poured into matching shaker glasses. The ale appears a hazy light amber color with around an inch of creamy off white foam. Aroma and flavor consist of spicy yeast, fresh black pepper, lemon zest, caramelized pears and apples, with not a whole lot of alcohol to speak of. Medium to full bodied with lively carbonation. This was a great warm weather ale. My glass was empty rather quickly."
"Shared by gford217 at one of our Brick Store Pub gatherings. Thanks for the opportunity. My first beer from this brewery. Pours a relatively light golden with lots of suspended particles. Okay head. Smells very grainy with some late creaminess. Tastes a bit like a Saison- certainly far more than it tastes like a Belgian Strong Pale, but with a lot of graininess thrown into the mix that distracts somewhat from other flavors and muddies the taste a bit. Not as sweet as a Tripel, but sweeter than most Belgian pales. There are some grassy hops here as well as a touch of lemon citrus, but the grain kinda dominates everything else. medium bodied, and fairly pleasant, but a bit of a mixed bag."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle picked up for me by Dyan, thanks man and I look forward to meeting you Saturday afternoon, the original price on this was nine dollars, split with my dad tonight, poured into my Duvel tulip glass tonight, light golden yellow color with some small orange highlights, two inch white bubbly and soapy head, some retention, lacing at first, aroma is made up of hoppiness, Belgian yeast, mild citrus, pepper, coriander, orange peel, and berries, flavor starts off sweet with yeasty accents, citrus in the middle, some nice hoppiness in the finish to give the Belgian yeast a nice balancing point, spices come out later on as it warms and pretty peppery too, gets sweeter by the end but the hops are still there to mediate, sweet, spicy, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate to high level of carbonation, taste lingers well, could have drank this bottle myself, not too strong and does not taste like it either, pretty smooth, actually smoother as it warms, not a bad interpretation of this style, first beer from this brewery and it was pretty good, one of the closest things I have had to Duvel, would drink again, recommended"
"Overall this is a solid BSPA - nothing overly exciting but well done. Worth a shot."
"d: way too drinkable!"
"This is only my second beer from Brewers Art, and, like the first, it's a well-constructed brew that shows extremely good drinkability. Good stuff."
"~Both the taste and mouthfeel are good. Has a dry woody finish with a healthy aftertaste. Fairly smooth with average drinkability. A good brew, but from what my friend tells me, I'd probably like the other Brewer's Art beverages more."
"D - Very good beer thats a little too easy to drink if your not careful definitely worth getting to try sometime"
"drinkability is good. well balanced. once the carbonation settles a little it is even nicer. solid belgian pale."
"Pours a very lightly hazed golden yellow, some bits of orange around the edges, big thick bone white head forms, never quite settles down, drops a ton of lace on the glass, lots of spirals, great retention, keeps up a solid layer. Smell is nice, some sweetness, caramel and honey, biscuits, light fruit, pineapple, wheat, yeast, light spice, kind of peppery, some toast, peaches and apples, nice. Taste is nice, yeasty, honey and caramel, quite sweet but lots of fruit to back it up, apple spice, apricots, wheat, a bit of pineapple tartness in the finish, some spicy bitterness, pretty nice. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, a little rough going down because of the carbonation but still quite nice. I dig this BSPA, nice flavours, thanks Dyan!"
"4.0 D: I would have had another if I didn't have other beers to try."
"Overall: served its purpose"
"Drinkability is good. This is a well done Belgian Golden. A bit on the strong side as far as ABV is concerned, but it doesn't feel too heavy or overly strong. Overall, it comes off as a pretty pleasant beer to sip."
"Big, fluffy white head sits atop a straw/golden colored beer. Somewhat hazy. Spicy, black pepper aroma. Very spicy and peppery bite upfront. Mild sweetness against the bite. Quite sulfury tasting. Good body. The finish is fairly dry. Lingering spice flavors. Good beer all around. I find this a bit more in your face then a lot of other Belgian storng pales I have had. Best brew pub in Baltimore by far. Worth seeking out."
"A fluffy eggshell cap topped this bright gold/orange beer. There were a few particulates floating around in there, but not too many. Good head retention with lots of clumpy lace. Bready aroma, crackers, a bit fruity with lemon/zest, plus some spice (white pepper and a hint of coriander seed). Low herbal bitterness with some bread crust, lemon, pear, and indistinct spices (other than white pepper in the finish). High carbonation, light to medium bodied with an airy texture. Quite dry. I really liked this one. Well balanced with mellow fruit and spice character."
"Notes from: 09/25/04."
"Drinkability: It ain't Duvel - it's different, and good in its own unique way. A crisp and enjoyable brew, very impressive from such a small establishment. Reasonable and well-hidden alcohol over a solid and decently complex array of flavors and aromas earns this one a solid recommendation."
"8/3/7/4/15/3.7"
"M/D - a little over carbonated for me, it was also way too sweet and had a strong coriander flavor that made drinking more than one too much for me"
"O: Overall the yeasty character definitly defines this beer, an aspect so many american brewers are afraid to charter into. Not at all timid, musky, damp fruit with a dry tart lemon touch really pulls all the punches here. The belgian malt is biscuity, doughy, and crisp. Its a beer that slowly reveals itself to you overtime gaining appreciation and complexity with each savory sip. The yeastiness really feels like an authentic belgain style. and it comes in a can"
"D: A great ale, I love the melding of big hops and Belgian flavors. This is the best offering that the Brewer's Art produces."
"D - says it's just over 7%. I say once you let it settle down it drinks quite nicely."
"This is one of the better Duvel styled beers I have had in a long time. I'm glad I was given the chance to try this one and I hope I can get my hands on more bottles in the near future. Thanks again Dyan!"
"Serving type: 750ml."
"A: Overly carbonated - four fingers of foam to a mere two fingers of beer, as the massive frothy head subsided a billowy cloud lingered, crystal clear, color of straw with the slightest hint of pint, almost like a pink champagne - 4.25, S: Loads of fruity and herbal aromas, the Belgian yeast does much to define the beer, also evident is the alcohol - 4.50, T: Some hop bite on the tail, like it was on the nose; the alcohol is very evident, quite dry and somewhat puckering on the tongue as a result of the booze, some definite sweetness, possibly the faintest hint of cherry - 4.25, M: 4.25, D: A beer to be enjoyed with a group of friends, very flavorful - 4.00"
"A crisp, well balanced beer in taste, with a nice bite. A slightly astringent alcohol taste and the warming contribute nicely to the overall taste and feel of the beer. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Easy drinking."
"Delicious, isn't lacking in anything, isn't overpowering or too light on the flavor. One of the best and most consistent offerings from a great brewer."
"Pretty drinkable, decent beer."
"The mouthfeel is slightly clingy, emphasizing the bitterness and spice, but that over-carbonation is distracting, making this the clear weak-point of the beer. If you want to enjoy the beer the best, I would suggest letting it settle considerably in the glass (which might also warm it slightly, which mutes the sourness and brings forward the pilsner-like malt character)."
"D- nice overall. This is one of my favorite beer styles and they did a good job with it."
"D: At 7.2%ABV, I can see myself drinking a lot of this"
"Damn, what is up with Brewers Art, all three beers I have had from these guys have been outstanding. Why am I not hearing more buzz about these guys? They certainly deserve it. This is a fantastic take on a Duvel inspired beer; fruity and spicier than Duvel, the added character definitely works wonderfully, especially considering that this is a bit sweeter than Duvel, that added flavors definitely help to tame the sweetness quite well."
"Drinkability- I could drink this all night long."
"Had this on the can and it's much better; just as I was told it would be at The Foodery. Not so earthy this time, but still very thick on the profile. I'd get this in cans if it was readily available."
"Overall, I wasn't too impressed and the high ABV might make this a one-a-night kind of beer. This was my least favorite of the Brewer's Art beers; that having been said, I still think I'd drink it agian."
"Just an excellent beer from the folks at Brewer's Art."
"D- Very drinkable for such an alcoholic beer, very refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good, would definitely have another."
"Drinkability: Nicely balanced Belgian Pale; love the finish; in the top echelon of US brewed Belgian style beers"
"D - Considering that this tastes more like a mild picante salsa than a beer, this is pretty good. It is definitely unique. I would imagine there are a lot of foods with which this would go well (tortilla chips stands out in my mind). Sessioning would be difficult, but not unimaginable. This is one worth seeking out."
"This one is definitely Duvel-ish...not as complex and certainly more mild."
"Mouthfeel: Seemed to me like it could have benefited from a little more carbonation. Moderate body from the sweetness. Drinkability is good, but it seems a little ""rich"" to be a true sessioner."
"Tried this beer before Orioles-Red Sox game at a local Baltimore bar. Appearance is of most other belgian strong pales, golden with a little haziness and a small white, foamy head. Aroma is nice and malty, with a hint of fruit and some peppery spices. The taste is of citrus fruit with a nice bitter hop aftertaste lingering. Not too powerful or complex. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is high, nothing too special about this beer but a good local brew for sure"
"On tap at UJ's on the Manatawny. Nice to see a Brewers Art beer in the Philadelphia area as they don't come around that often. The beer poured a light golden color with a medium thickness white head that lasted for a bit. The aroma of the Ozzy was a nice malty / sweet smelling bouquet with a bit of hop bitterness to the nose. The taste is a nice malty, bready taste with some sweetness and a good touch of hop bitterness at the end. With a medium body, I found this beer to be rather drinkable."
"Pale gold in color with a wisp of white head. The nose of grainy malts and peppary spiciness come through rather good in the flavor as well. Sweet, citrusy, and dry finishing, this is just an all around good pounder. Finished one or four while watching the Yankees recently lose in the postseason. The best of both worlds."
"Substantial, goes down good, tasty finish. A beerdrinker's beer."
"Had this on tap in the Brewer's Art. Pours a liight gold with a thin finger of head and pretty good retention. Nose is a grainy malt with a slight bit of pepper. Taste is a pretty rich malty bread, with just a slight bit of sugary sweetness and a citrussy hop finish which is strong for the style. Medium bodied this beer has a really dry finish. This is dangerously drinkable for its alcohol content and goes great with the garlic fries."
"A very clear pale yellow with a decent head, this gives off the expected sweet lemon and spice/pepper aromas with some hints of cracked, dried coriander and light malt. Similar flavors with a bit of a rind-like bitter twist on the end, which threw me for a bit of a loop. Not nearly enough body; this really did taste and feel just a bit watered down. Perhaps it's a bit too filtered? I didn't notice any haze at all."
"Drinkability is very good. Smooth and lush on the palate with nice transitions between grain, pale malts and the citrusy hops."
"This is one of the better beers at Brewers Art. Unlike many Belgians, I find this one if very well balanced and definitely has some noticeable hop character. Of course the malts take precedence but do not to over the top. It is extremely drinkable and care must be taken since it is a bit stronger than the usual beer."
"Unbelievable to be able to get a belgian of this quality at a $2 happy hour price."
"Drinkability: Very."
"Other: no spices are used in the making of this at all. It's all from the yeast."
"From the tap at the Grey Lodge, this beer poured a clean and clear gold color. A thinning white head topped off this brew. Low carbonation. From this beer emits a strange egg like aroma, or it can maybe be described as a Sanford felt tip marker. The taste is light fruity and has a spicy, almost peppery hop bite. Lemon cough drop notes come out. Medium malt bodied beer and finishes sharp and clean with a light and peppery dryness and a dry spicy hop sting. This is an enjoyable beer that has a distinctiveness about it."
"This is now one of my favorites."
"Straight 4's down the line on this solid brew,pours a lighter shade of gold with a nice big fluffy head that leaves some nice lacing.The aroma is yeasty and very citriusy.Seemed to be a very malt accented brew tastes of citruis and some light smokiness with a big malty finish.I have had 3 or 4 of The brewers Art beers and all seem to be pretty solid."
"The beer was gold in color with a very thin head. The aroma was nice with some floral, citrus, and other sweet notes. The taste was as expected, malty and yeasty with some bitterness. The mouthfeel was thinner than expected. Very drinkable and satisfying. Overall I thought this was a mellow version of Duvel."
"A clear yellow-gold body displays streams of very tiny bubbles rising steadily beneath a bright-white head of creamy foam. The retention is decent, and although it eventually drops to a thin but creamy collar, it does leave some very nice lace about the glass. The nose offers a distinct apple/pear fruit note amidst sweetish malt, slightly citrusy & floral hops, and a gentle spiciness (coriander?). The body is medium-light; and it's crisp in the mouth with a very fine carbonation that tickles the tongue. In the flavor, all of the elements found in the nose are carried over. It starts crisp and fruity (some light cherry?) on the front of the tongue with a low-key, fruit-like tartness; develops some malty sweetness and delicate spicy character as it crosses the palate; and finishes with a firm bitterness, a drying wash of alcohol, some low-key hop flavor, and a touch of residual fruity malt. Very well-balanced with a restrained spiciness! Flavorful, smooth yet crisp, and deceptively drinkable! Impressive!"
"This beer poured into the glass an amber color that had yellow/red hues to it when held up to the light, that was fairly clear. It produced a creamy white head that lasted fairly well to mid glass then formed a small film and ring on the sides of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of fruits, sweet malt, caramel, spices and floral hops. Nice balance to the aroma, each aroma seemed to be well pronounced. The tastes were full of flavor, good fruits (apples, oranges, pears), some spices (clove), rich malts, floral hops, citrus, alcohol, and some yeast. The aftertaste was rich in malt and fruit. It was medium bodied and big flavored. All flavors seemed to be very well pronounced and blended very well. A smooth drink, and somewhat sneaky because the flavors disguise the alcohol very well. A really good beer from this brewery."
