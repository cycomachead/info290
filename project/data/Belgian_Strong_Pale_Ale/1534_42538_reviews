"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 3.5, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4"
"O- A nice score of a pre-aged bottle I found on the shelf.  Not as incredible as the Blue but still mighty tasty."

"Notes of metal and tar are unexpected in aroma. There's an estery profile of banana, clove, pear skin, and apple accompanying a fairly sweet dark fruit and caramel malt backbone. Notes of figs and dates become more pronounced as it warms. Flavor is exceedingly sweet initially, with caramel malt and treacle dominance. Luckily, esters of tart green apple and pear, along with sherry oxidation, counter and add complexity. Still fairly hot, with alcohol warmth lingering in the finish.figs and dates add depth as it warms. Fairly complex beer, which will probably continue to age well."

"2009 Vintage poured into tulip."

"Flavor is very nice.  Very sweet up front.  Pepper comes through as well as the cloves and some cinnamon.  The alcohol content is noticeable, but not overpowering at all.  Spicy, dry finish.  Excellent mouthfeel.  Overall a very good beer."

"Overall it took a while for this to make sense to me. It is complex and I spent a lot of time trying to unravel what was going on. Maybe too much...but an enjoyable beer that I would drink again. One to savor and linger over."

"Pours a five+ finger white pillowy head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Light cloudy amber color. Light citric nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is citrus, some sweetness, smooth, clean finish. $5.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"The sweetness dictates that this beer be sipped slowly and savored. For me this is a very good dessert beer !"

"Somewhere between a strong pale and a triple in reality. Definetely a solid fruit forward Belgian. I Would prefer a little more pale, but it is worth trying."
""
"A quality brew. Well balanced. I think I would have enjoyed it more in the winter, but it's a nice contrast to all the IPAs and Imperial IPAs Iv'e been sampling lately."

"2012 vintage - Poured a cloudy orange with two finger head that left lace and stuck around a long time for better or worse. A spicy and yeasty aroma with touches of tropical fruit and a touch of floral hops as well sweet and breadlike malt. Smooth and easy to drink with a light to medium body, there is a liveliness and crispness in this beer thanks to some spice and carbonation and the alcoholo gives it a heated snap on the finish. The fruit flavors and malts are balanced and I'd say you can equally detect some plush tropical fruit like pineapple with citric hoppy orange alongside both sweet and grainy malts. Overall I just found this beer to hit the right notes in terms of balance and taste and I really enjoyed it this dangerous sipper."

"Dare I say it but the alcohol burn masks this one and really hurts the beer ever so slightly. A good SPA but there is better to be had for the price."

"MF – Good carbonation, medium to dry creamy with hints of spice in the finish, medium bodied."

"I gave the 2009 bottle's taste a 3.5 but think I am going to have to up it. Even though the bottle is younger I am not getting the hot sensation that I had from the 2009 bottle. Going to go up to 4.25 on this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/9/2009. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apricot, pear, golden raisin, apple, banana, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, herbal, light pepper, clove, floral, and herbal earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with zero alcohol presence. Taste of apricot, golden raisin, pear, apple, banana, honey, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, honey, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes; with a great malt balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with and slick and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong pale ale! Great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy esters; and very smooth to sip on for 10%. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Sweet, grainy beer. Feels like the type that gives you a headache. Just sweet overall, not my thing."

"O: Letting this beer develop really helped mellow the booziness. the alcohol is slightly notable"

"Overall: This beer did it for me just right. I prefer the Blue a little more but this one is still on point. Grab your favorite pork chop and give this a go. Salud!"
""
"Overall, it's good: I mean, it was always going to be good. It's good, in a standard, comfortable and recognisable way. It's good so that you know it's good, and so you can't disagree with the fact it's good. It's comfortable, it's warm, it's familiar."

"The taste is well balance with the same characteristics as the smell with a fruity taste with notes of apple, pineapple and peach. There are some light cardboard whiffs, but very light. The malt is grainy and gives the impression of wheat with slight musty taste. The bitterness is low, but high enough to balance the alcohol. The alcohol is very well hidden. The body is quite thin. Aftertaste is pretty short with the fruitiness lingering for some time."
"Medium plus bodied with plenty of carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink, with an apple and pear aftertaste. Finishes somewhat dry. Just like most everything else Het Anker makes, this is a great beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, honey, yeast, slight spice, and some floral aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness and a sweet fruity finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. There is also a slight numbing quality in the mouth that I got after each sip. Overall, this is a good beer that is strong but easy to drink."
"OVERALL- This was a fantastic beer that really made me re-think the style. Has almost nothing in common with the ""Devil"" beers. Popped it open because the brewery reccomends aging no more than 3 years but I think it could go longer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very nice. A very good BSPA."
""
""
"O - This is really good with years of age on it. I imagine it would be just as good fresh."
"Bottle. Pours hazy-orange with a short lasting white head and a lot of carbonation. Aroma is of Belgium yeast, pale malt and sulfur. Body is medium, tangy. Taste is cherry, pears, peach, yeast, candy sugar, peppery hops, biscuit malt. Finish is long, spicy and dry. Taste is much better than nose."
"Edit: suddenly, BANANAS!"
"Let's look at that label copy now: "" Cuvee van de Kaiser Rood is brewed once a year on the 24th of February on the birthday of Charles the Fifth. It is brewed in a limited quantity by the Anker Brewery of Mechelen, one of the last remaining classic producers in Belgium. This blonde ale of top fermentation illustrates the subtle balance between the different natural ingredients. Bottle fermented."""

""
"This is a delicious beer. Crisp and refreshing. Nice belgian flavor with just the right hop. Had with a chile relleno at Beer Kitchen in Kansas City and it paired well with the spiciness."
""
""
""
"O - This is pretty good, but kind of boozy and perhaps a bit too sweet. Nice beer though, can see this aging well."
"O: Great beer. Belgian to the bone"
"Bought this beer cold and the review is based on a beer at about 40-40 degrees. As this warms to between cellar and room temp it completely changes. Not as balanced, looses all of the tart fruit. Still has some pear but it is not half the brew it is colder. Strange, this is usually not the case with strong belgians."
"Overall, It's got a wonderful nose but I am not feeling keen on this one or desiring it ever again. Nice to try it though."
""
"O: a good beer, this. Highly quaffable and the 10% ABV is barely noticeable. I would like a bit more balance on this. A bit more hops to balance the fruit. Nice brew though."
""
""
"2009 vintage. I had this in a Belgian Brunch tasting and was my least favorite. This beer looks pretty good, but I wonder if the aging had cause it to go too sweet. I barely notice the 10% ABV on this because it has this overwhelming brown sugar nose and taste. It tasted light a really floral quad. This could be good as a share for dessert, make a fruit crumble or a cheese plate. I wonder if the b lue is as sweet."
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body and sweet throughout, mildly dry finish but overall a nice beer. The yeast character on the palate is strong and sweet, floral with nice fruity esters. I'd have this again."
""
"I quite like this. The earthy notes really complement the classic pale strong ale flavours here. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Loved this. Nose is a bit weak, but the rest of this just shines. The age on the bottle probably helped. This is not overly boozy or hot. Fruit, grain, and alcohol. Grab a bottle."
"O:Delicious. I approve wholeheartedly. In reading other reviews, many people complain of a bit of heat and off flavors. All I can say is that this one is fantastic and well worth sitting on."
"O - Great flavors and mouthfeel. One of the best belgian strong pale ales I have had."
""
""
""
"O: A light, sweet beer whose flavour belies its strength. Elegant. Noticeably Belgian. Quite recommended, but it doesn't find the same favour with me as have some other Brouwerij Het Anker beers. Still, a good buy. Would have again."
""
""
"O - Nice balaced beer with subtleties that really make this and enjoyable BSPA. Would benefit with a couple of years ageing. The alcohol is very well hidden."
"O: This is the first beer I both aged and reviewed. It certainly became more subdued due to its age. The flavors were more restrained and the body lighter. It is very easy and pleasant to drink, and it is more elegant due to its age."
"overall: very enjoyable overall, I wasn't sure what to expect as a result of the aging process, but my expectations were not in line with my actual experience, but that is not a bad thing, lighter character was indicative of age, but I was expecting more complexity from the scent than what I got in the taste."
"Cheers!!"
"Overall: I really like this beer. It does lack some of the complexity you might expect from a 10% ABV brew from the Low Countries, but I really like the base flavors here. I'll look forward to having this beer again."
"The sweetness dictates that this beer be sipped slowly and savored. Not one I'd drink every day but this beer is unique and one I'll come back to again."
"Overall quite nice, though (and I know it's apples and oranges), I definitely prefer the Keizer Blauw, though it's almost undrinkably rich, whereas this is pleasant and could be had all night, were it not for the price and ABV. This could go well with steak or chicken."
"Overall, I expected the age to have mellowed this beer more, but it didn't seem to help tame the hops and alcohol."
"O - A good belgian strong ale. Strong, but drinkable. Slightly syrupy, but not tongue-coating. I will probably buy another, and let it age in the cellar."
"Smell is good, bready with some fuits behind it. Good taste, fresh and drinkable."
"2008 vintage poured into my snifter. This beer pours a cloudy honey gold in color with a one finger, spongy white head. The foam just sit atop the brew for a couple minutes without going down at all. The nose isn't prominent at all. All I can pick up is some muted honey cream and some pale malt sweetness with perhaps some clove. The flavor is light and sweet. It tastes of honey, clove, pale malts, with a light trace of alcohol. I'm surprised at how subdued the alcohol is for the content. Despite the short list of adjectives I used to describe the flavors, it's actually very, very good for the style. I'm pretty impressed by it. It drinks exceptionally smooth, being at just over three years old. This is a very good Belgian Strong Pale and worth trying."
"Served into pilsner glass from champagne bottle at refrigerator temperature. Cork was extremely hard to remove. Pours with a very thick, creamy head which dissipates very slowly. Aroma is of malt and honey; flavor is of also of malt and honey but much more heavy on the honey sweetness- this is a very sweet beer. No appreciable alcohol or hop flavor- this could certainly benefit from another 10 - 15 IBU of bittering to balance the overwhelming (but not extremely malty) sweetness. The head is certainly long-lasting, especially for a 10% brew."
"I enjoyed this beer and would recomend it. It is not as complex as many other Belgians that I have had, but it has a nice balance of sweetness and that hint of alcohol that one expects from a Belgian. I think that Charles V would have been happy with this beer."
"I'm going to get another bottle and cellar-- this one's dated 2008- would be fun to see how it ages."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking, tasty brew. Some great, classic flavors all around with a nice surprise regarding the apple flavor. I'd recommend this to anybody that's a fan of the style."
"2008 bottling. Pours gold with an orange tinge and a lasting fine whitish head. Pears and pepper on the nose. Strong but not a complex aroma. Flavor is very perfumey but not in an alcoholic way. Very vivid peach and pear notes atop a caramel malty base. The clarity of the esters is unlike anything I've tasted in beer. A rather nice beer."
"D: Really good brew. There is nothing really to say about this one other than it hits all the right notes and is just a solid brew."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and the smell and taste, which makes this beer rather drinkable considering its strength."
"D- I like the beer, it's interesting, strong, and it will keep you coming back for another sip. This one is much better than the blue label and is quite possibly my favorite Het Anker brew to date; however, it's more of a once in a while beer for me, if there are any left."
"Tight carbonation up front that lingers throughout affecting the palate in a negative way. The alcohol presence is overpowering and dominates throughout into a very hot finish. There is some peppery, zesty spice and light apple and pear notes but again they are completely overpowered by the alcohol heat. I'm a huge fan of the blue version but this was very disappointing."
"This one needs to breathe quite a bit before it begins to unfold its complexity. Still a fairly solid Pale and fits with Het Anker."
"A very strong, very pale, and very good Belgian ale, the prominent, yet in the end, balanced sweetness rendering this as a readily enjoyable sipper, though the masked ABV will eventually make me pay for generally ignoring its duly specified, but not perceptible at the given time, potency. A bloody good BSPA, but alas, poor Rood, I still prefer the Blauw."
"drinkability - shared some of the bottle and still i could not finish more then about 12oz"
"I am a 10-12 time visitor to Mechelen and Het Anker...previous memories of earlier Cuvee reds are about the same."
"Overall a difficult one to describe. It doesn't wow at first, but the more I get to know it, the more I like it!"
"jd"
"Similar to Delirium Tremens, Piraat, and Lucifer, the beer seems agressive and over bearing. Where big sweetness needs big spice to balance; I feel that there's too much conflict and not enough roundness to the balance to be more pleasurable."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is extremely boozy. Once I got past the alcohol, I got some flowers and spices. The flavor is alcohol, wheat, spices and flowers. The alcohol is very hot and makes the beer tough to drink. As it warms, the other flavors come out a little more but the alcohol is always very present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nice beer, but the alcohol could be hidden better."
"D: Despite a rather pleasant malt and sugar base, this beer is somewhat ""ruined"" by the presence of the alcohol."
"Appearance has a slightly off pale yellowish golden color with a thin bubbly white head with minimal retention and lacing. Aroma is alcohol heavy, almost like rubbing alcohol with some fruity esters, candi sugars, sweet spices and Belgian yeast. Medium full body with strong, active carbonation. Very effervescent, but finish has a strong alcohol presence detracting from the overall perception of the body and flavor. Flavor is super sweet, tons of candi sugar, ripe sweet fruit, and yeast. Very uniquely flavored, not particularly dry, crisp or earthy, but the extreme booziness and sweetness makes this a challenge to consume."
"2008 vintage poured into a Bernardus Blond glass. I have been looking forward to this one. Not so much any more. The beer pours a light golden color. A little tint of yellow in the head. No lacing in sight. The alcohol was super strong in the taste. at 10%, it tasted way over that. I decided to let it rest in the glass for a minute or two. I wanted to see if it would soften up a bit. It did a little. I started to pull out some of the flavors; lemon zest and some floral characteristics came to mind. I did finish it, but I was not overly empressed."
"Notes: Vintage 2008. A bit surprised by the amount of alcohol flavor is still present after 2 years, it's not necessarily hot or really off-putting but it is a little higher than I'd like. Fairly typical BSPA flavors. A fairly enjoyable beer from a solid brewery. I was expecting a little more from this beer, but it is a solid offering. Definitely worth a try, but there are some better BSPA."
"What an amazing beer! It pours a great pure golden color with a pure white foamy head that explodes once it hits your glass. The nose on this was absolutley fantastic, I could hardly stop smelling this long enough to take a sip. You pick some great spice notes on the nose along with a sense of tropical fruit. The palate fantastic with flavors of orange zest, and baking spices that are immediatley noticable with some notes of caramel, anise and corriander coming through in the mid-palate."
"The mouthfeel is seemingly light at first, but the amount of carbonation is simply misleading, giving off an ""airy"" feeling that makes it seem much lighter than it actually is. It's rather thick, and settles heavily in the stomach, which doesn't help its case for drinkability a whole lot either."
"Aftertaste: Orange, Alcohol, and carbonation are almost modest for the style."
"$10.29 @ Joe Canal's"
"D: ABV is well hidden and each sip is a refreshing invitation to drink more. Goes down far too easy for a beer this big."
"I really like this, very drinkable, bubbles make you want to drink more."
"Taste: stunning; one of the most beautiful beers I've ever tasted. Floral hops, great citrus notes but what really hit me are the tropical fruits and fine herbs. I am a Belgian freak and this one has recently joined my favorites."
"D: A little sweet (not as 'digestive' as some Belgians), but a good drinker."
"Served in a snifter, this thing pours a nice light color with a thin head. To be honest, my memory of the initial taste is a bit overpowered by the fine licorice/ fennel taste that comes on during the finish. Indeed, fennel is all I could think about by the end of the beer. Loved it!"
"Impression: Couldn't resist trying last year's before this year's, but now I may not taste this year's, and just put it away. With a year this beer is astoundingly tasty. If you like this style, this beer is a must try."
"A very tasty brew that does not disappoint, but might stand with a little more aging."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer. If you have had Duval or Delirium or La Chouffe, you have had this, but I wouldn't pass it up if you are in the mood for something Belgian-y (i.e., fruity and spicy). It does the job well."
"The fact that Cuvee Van De Keizer Rood is a bit of a letdown speaks as much to my love affair with Brouwerij Het Anker as it does to this beer. Something is off here and I hope the brewery makes a few changes if they decide to release this ale again."
"My expectations where met with an above average brew."
"Carolus Van De Keizer Rood is a strong BSPA from Brouwerij Het Anker. It's not quite the masterpiece that Cuvée Van De Keizer is, but not many beers reach that level. The only thing really holding this one back is the alcohol. I think it would be a little better at 8%. As it is, it's really warm and the flavor is a bit strong. Other than that, it's a solid BSPA. Not good enough to compete with the likes of Duvel, but very good. Easily recommended if you have the opportunity."
"2008 vintage. This poured a hazy straw color with white head. It smelled like faint lemon and mild Belgian yeast, with powdered sugar and honey and a bit of coriander. It tasted like candied lemons and oranges and honey, with coriander and sourdough yeast and confectioners sugar. It was somewhat thick with smooth carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was one of the best light Belgians I've ever had. It was very delicate and clean, but still flavorful and delicious. It had a very refined body with the natural carbonation, and it hid the alcohol amazingly well, so it was quite easy to drink. I could enjoy this beer often, and highly recommend it. I need to find a fresh bottle, since my sample was over a year old, and I'd also be curious to try one with several years on it. I have a feeling this is one of only a few light Belgian ales that could improve after multiple years of age. Great stuff."
"This beer doesnt really do it for me. There is some spice, along with some tart fruit and a bit of underlying sweetness. It almost has a skunkiness to it. I dont believe it is really skunked, I just think the combination of the tartness and spice combine for that flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Finish is dry. I wont try this again."
"Drinkability: Do I want another? Not now, hell no, this is a 10% 750. On another day, hell yes. This is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale. This is the kind of thing you could pop for a special occasion and get all sorts of non-beer drinkers to enjoy it."
"D: A delight to have, I could cradle of bottle of this all night and come back to it the next morning."
"D - goes down surprisingly easy dispite it being a 10% beast. 750ml is the perfect nightcap. I will seek this one out again. amazing!"
"Imported a case of this for the Toronto gang. A stong blond that grows on me. 2008 edition. Generous white head on golden that generates rising carbonation bubbles, heavy lace. A story of yeast. Interesting yeast, even somehwat funky and certainly creamy as the glass is downed."
"D: Another real nice ale from the fellows at Het Anker, they know what they are doing when it comes to making great Belgian beer."
"Drinkability is solid alcohol is evident but dangerously shadowed by the rest of the beers characteristics. Overall very enjoyable brew and one that I may have to revisit especially at 8.99 in the state of Ohio."
"At $16.95, you could argue that the price is steep, but I'd point out that this is the equivalent of three pints of regular beer, and damn good ones at that. Goulden Carolus have an excellent line of beers, and this one (even if it is just the Easter rebranded) will only add to their reputation."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow-orange color. The head is a huge three inches in height, and doesn't recede. The aroma is of lemon and orange peel, leather, fresh cut grass, and a general yeastiness. The taste leans more toward the leathery, yeasty side than the aroma does. The orange and lemon peel are there, but they are tucked into the background. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer, that I would certainly drink again."
"I know the some might find this beer off putting because of the malt sweetness but the complexity keeps me coming back. Once again, one of my all time favorite brews from one of my all time favorite brewers."
"Highly recommended, will get some more soon."
"Drinkability- Very good, all-around strong Belgian blond,"
"Notes: Malty rich, fruity sweet, and explosively spicy, this BSPA is quite enjoyable! This is the second brew from Het Anker that I've had the pleasure of drinking, and while this is not as good as the Van De Keizer Blauw, it is still a pretty damn good brew. Recommended"
"Poured hazy gold with a huge, rocky white head that exploded out of my Old Guardian tulip glass. Thick white lacing. Tart, apples-and-spice nose with some yeast esters and a slight musty hay aroma. Crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that battles the stickiness in the finish. Sweet taste that was expected from the style. More pear and apples blended with spice and candied sugar. A funky yeast flavor follows along with a boozy finish. The 10% isn't well-masked but it doesn't take over the beer, either. I enjoyed it."
"Overall, an very good BSPA that I really enjoyed. Highly recommend as it's a great example for the style. I'd have another if I could easily get it but since not avail here this will probably be my only one."
"D= Wow, what a great beer. This was right in my palate's comfort zone and I am wondering why I haven't pulled the trigger on this one before now. Highly recommended!"
"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a nice big pure white foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma of apricot and peach ester is just incredible and must admit that not many brewery can get this much from their yeast. Taste is very smooth with no signs of alcohol and fruity esters are very well balanced with some sweet Belgian malt. Light floral hops are also noticeable. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. Another winner from a top Belgian brewery that I have some a tendency to forget about."
"Drinkability: very flavorful beer that is a slow sipper based on the alcohol level."
"This isn't the biggest or most complex Belgian pale but it's extremely drinkable. Recommended."
"Yeasty nose is slightly offputting. But the initial sweetness with apricots, pears, and clove is very nice. Boozy with a hot alcohol finish that is nice in that it is dry, but does not balance as well as it should. Nice carbonation. I don't get the sick-sweetness that some others have alluded to. I think there is enough spiciness here to firm it up a bit so that it is more refreshing than syrupy. Overall, not a classic, but very good."
"I will try and buy another couple of these just to stick in the basement and forget about.. I would worry about the carbonation.. it was already creeping out of the bottle as soon as I cracked the cork."
"Taste/MF/Drinkability: Clean with a light belgian yeast derived spice character, a touch of hops but scrubbed very quickly by the big carbonation. Slight alcohol warming but extremely palatable and quaffable for the overall strength. Deceptive like a fine Belgian Strong Pale should be."
"Overall: This is a nice complement, if not antithesis of the Gouden Carolus Cuvee van de Keizer Blauw/Bleu. Great for sipping, and very full-bodied overall."
"D: Woo this is a strong one. Just one bottle please. But this bottle can last half the night if sipped on properly. A great strong ale!"
"7/4/6/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"This beer poured a clear golden color and formed a huge pillowy foamy snow white head that refused to subside and coated the glass with lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus, Belgian yeasts, hops and spices. The flavor was of malt, hops, bread, pepper and phenolics. The body is fairly light and the finish rather sprite yet peppery."
"Purchased: Liquor Max, Loveland CO"
"taste has lots of carbonation to it, sweet fruit, malt, a little caramel in the back, nice ending with a little spicy kick."
"I bought this nottle (750ml, corked & caged) for $9.99 at Whole Foods in Columbus. This was the first time I've seen this version from Gouden Carolus, ""Special Blond of the Emperor"". The beer was pale yellow color with a little haze, and a thin but lasting film of bubbles. The smell is really good, honey and sweet malts, similar to Grotten ale from St Bernardus (high praise). The taste is just as good, this could be Barbar or Grotten ale rebottled. Near-perfect flavor and drinkability, this is great beer."
"(Bottle) Pours golden with a huge white head. The aroma is of doughy, ester-ish and spicy yeast with undertones of candi sugar, pears, red/yellow apples, fresh and dried oranges, tart white grapes, subtle tropical fruits, mild lime, bubblegum, wine gum, vanilla powder, fresh nutmeg, coriander, mild white pepper and almond paste. Also some hospital/clove-like phenols. The malt and the aromatic hops bring tones of grain, dry crackers, white bread, spices, fresh grass and mild flowers. Wood dry hints from the alcohol, yet elegant on the nose. At the same time, there is a good deal of almond paste sweetness present. The alcohol warmth also holds some hints of nail polish. The flavour is of mild citric and fresh spicy with balanced tones of herbal hops, cracker/white bread-like malt, candi sugar and some phenolic hints lurking in the background. Hints of nutmeg, pepper, tart white grapes, apples and pears, black wine gums are all notable. The mouthfeel is dry (some sweetness in the beginning), round and clean without being lifeless with a carbonation that adds some champagne-like qualities. In the aftertaste linger phenols, citrus, candi sugar and a light bitter hop sting. Medium to full bodied. A very well made example of the style."
"Overall: nice belgian blonde with lots of flavors, but too much alcohol in the taste."
"D - Near-cloying sweetness and alcohol limit this a little more than my other fave BSPA's, but still relatively tasty."
"After letting this beer sit an hour, the flavors came together a little better. Opened this for holloween last night left about 8oz. in bottle overnight, then drank in the morning and it was much more drinkable. Tasting a liitle like a blonde Chimay. My advise would be to let this breath for a couple hours, then drink. Or better yet put this in the cellar for a couple years then enjoy. Not ready now!"
"Drinkability: It's certainly not subtle, as there's tons going on here. A bit alcoholic initially, but once it starts coursing through your system you learn to live with it, even enjoy it, and focus on the expressive fruit character and punchy phenols. Still though, I'd stick with the blue, babies!"
"D = This one is a very good drinker even with the high and noticeable ABV."
"Pours a very pale golden color with tons of carbonation and an immense white rocky head that goes nowhere. Great lacing sticks to the glass. Smells of honey, candy sugar, belgian yeast, spices, pear, very pleasant. Smells a lot better than it tastes. Initial sip, while still very cold, was extremely biting with alcohol. Bitter, extremely phenolic. As it warmed up, more flavors came through like doughy malts, the yeast, some honey, hops, but the alcohol presence was still very much there. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, extremely carbonated, with a somewhat dry finish. Drinkability factor definitely lacks."
"It's a dark golden colored beer with a fully lasting head, purely Belgian, it laces well on the glass. Nose of dough and cookie, bready malts, polish and fruit. Smells Belgian, but doesn't seem to have a lot of refinement. Flavor has a bit too much strength and doesn't have a lot of delicacy or complexity. Sweet, it possesses heavy notes of light fruits and alcohol. This Belgian misses the mark."
"This might get slightly higher scores (?!!?) in a couple months, it still seems a TAD on the hot side... hopefully that doesn't correspond to a more subdued aroma, but I can't wait to revisit. This is superb, and immediately a favorite."
"Review Number 250. Served in my Maudite tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a dense, two-inch bright white head and copious tiny bubbles evident in solution. Strands of sticky lacing spotted the sidewalls of the glass during the tasting. Alcohol was clearly identifiable in the nose, followed by candi sugar, belgian yeast and a hint of tropical fruit (perhaps passion fruit) detectable at the back. Taste consistent with nose, as well as a citrus astringency present up front; however, flavors are somewhat masked by the alcohol. Consistency is between light- and medium-bodied with a considerable carbonation burn concentrated up front and then dispersed throughout the mouth, with a booziness that lingers at the finish. Nice offering, but drinkability is impacted by the over-representation of alcohol imposed on the senses."

"D - Complex and tasty. A little sweet. I would like to try this one with a little age on it."
"D: For a 10% brew, this is dangerously drinkable"
"750ml bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a golden yellow hazy body with a good inch of off-white head. Smells fruity and spicy. Tastes citrussy (orange/grapefruit) with spice (coriander? clove?) and the slightest hint of caramel malt toward the finish. On the lighter side of medium in body with ample carbonation. A fairly easy drinker considering the ABV, and a solid example of the style. I'll definitely be getting this again."
"I tried this at a beer tasting at a local store and had to buy a bottle. It's interesting, complex, and full of character. It is also quite young and certainly has not reached its full potential. This is a very good beer now, but in a couple years I can almost guarantee it will be outstanding. I am definitely going to have to buy a couple bottles to put down. I suggest anyone who comes across this buy at least two bottles, drink one now and lay the other down for a year or more. Highly recommended."
"D: A slow sipper with a big ABV... pleasant to nurse over an evening, and let the day slip away. One to try again with a bit of age on it."
"Quite impressive."
"Had this beer on draft at the Dive Bar in Worcester a few days ago. I was dreaming about it all day today to the point that I went back and had another at 17:30 today!! (opening) Its a light blonde in color but the flavor is big...exactly what Id expect from a Carolus big blonde. A bit of a pleasant bite at the end. I dont think the 10% really comes through. Im sipping a 2005 cuvee van de Keizer blue right now...just to pay respect to this anniversary beer!!"
