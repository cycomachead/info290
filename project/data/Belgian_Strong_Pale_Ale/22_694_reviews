"Carmel notes subltle banana wonderful beer"
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color, with a huge foamy white frothy head.  There is good carbonation and foamy lacing.  The odor is very spicy, clove, cardamom, grassy, apricot, orange, citrus, lemon, fruity, peach, berry, slightly floral.  The taste is herbal, orange, citrus, lemon, very spicy, clove, cardamom, very malty."
""
""
"Slightly fruity, somewhat astringent. A good kind of sweet. Bright. And a lot of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Reminds me a lot of La Fin Du Monde, but with more fruit notes to it.  Great stuff and long-lasting."
""
""
"Not Unibroue's best.  Go for La Terrible instead."
""
""
"- overall a good beer but hoped for something more from unibroue, great brewery just not as much flavor or anything that stood out to me from this beer"
""
""
""
""
"An excellent example of the style, yum..."
""
"Very good. Unibroue does it again."
""
""
""
""
"A soft pour resulted in carbonation that you could hear, not just see.  The strong stream of bubbles from the central nucleation point persisted for a long time, even after calming down somewhat.  Golden color with a touch of orange.  Quite clear.  Little haze.  Nice aroma, in strength and quality.  Touches of sweetness, vague fruitiness, and a bit of spice.  Taste is similar.  Some wheat characteristics.  Nice balance.  Feel is also good.  Modestly dry.  Excellent beer."
"Lightly hazy deep golden color with a huge frothy white head and a huge amount of stickies and carb bubbles.Fruity spicy earthy yeasty, has that Unibroue sameness but it just works, nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very dry, spicy, salty, fruity."
""
""
""
""
"Pineapple. spicy hops. moderate carbonation. thick yeasty bread mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there isn't too much to say since It's from Unibroue, so it's one of the best New World Belgian-style beers out there. Excellent balance and full of flavor. An ass-kicker at 9% but easily drinkable."

"Overall:  a very good beer.  Not quite as lively as some in the style and not quite as interesting as some of Unibroue's other offerings, but this is very good."

"Final Grade: 4.34, an excellent A. I love me some Belgian strong pale ales, and Don de Dieu is one of the absolute best I've found. Fans of their La Fin Du Monde will find a lot to appreciate in this one, though as a BSPA it definitely lacks much of the spicy, yeasty kick found in its sister tripel. This is one of the best beers in Unibroue's (very impressive) year-round portfolio, and a definite must-try for any fan of Belgian-style beers. Hopefully this one returns to the LCBO in a more convenient format at some point."

"So overall would I recommend it ? Damn yes ! This is a beer that you have to give it a try in your existence. You can t go wrong with Unibroue. You want a strong Blond Belgian Ale, go and grab Don De Dieu !"
"Everyone seems to love their la fin de monde, with great reason, but this is my favorite beer from my favorite brewery. Ill drink this everyday and not get tired of it"
"Overall - very well crafted Belgian pale ale, with only subtle alcoholic suggestions that lie beneath. Delicious and extremely well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don De Dieu is another great brew from the Unibroue folks.  It looks great, has a complex nose and taste, plus the mouthfeel tickles like champagne.  All the standard goodness of Belgian ales are present.  It may not hit the high note of La Fin de Monde, but I'd never turn this one down if offered."

"You want to know what this tastes like, well, the brewery's notes cover it all. This beer is phenomenal. It is a bit pricey, but oh so worth it. I found it very light in mouth-feel and quite drinkable."

"Great complexity, excellent fruity notes. It's a bit boozy, but tasty. A Belgian pale the way a Belgian brewery would make one. Nice departure from the Americanized versions of the style."

"This is hard to find in my neck of the woods; BevMo and Total Wines usually don't carry this Unibroue offering. Thanks, Whole Foods - I'll be back!"

"12/19/13 From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Now this is a beer. Mid-December cold as a... outside but this cool, low alcohol beverage hits the spot. Welcoming spiciness greet me on the nose & tongue. The familiar yeasty aroma of Unibroue adds to this homecoming. I don't know whoever made this, but they know me & I thank you one and all. XXOO"

"It's hard to describe this, but it is a unique Belgian ale with a sweet coriander malt richness, smells great tastes great, So for all the ales from Uniboue are excellent.  I'm seeking out there other offereings as well to try them out."

"Unibroue is so far ahead of its North American competition, it's painful for their challengers.  While the competition continue toil away in their basements with their poor experiments they  call beer (Victory Golden Monkey, anyone?), Unibroue continue weave golden wheat into bottles to create magic."

"Very smooth, sweet, doesn't taste very beer like. It's pretty good but its just not my type of beer. As you drink more it gets better, but I guess all alcohol's like that. Reminds me of wine so don't buy it if you're not into that sort of thing. C"

"There is something special about the Unibroue ales/beers.This one is no exception to the greatness from this Canadian brewery.I wont go through the normal smell taste and what not.Its what a Belgian should be.Bold,Spicy and leaves you satisfied.Just be careful the alcohol is well hidden.Cheers."

"The verdict...brilliant stuff from the folks at Unibroue. My only complaints would be the relatively poor head retention, and DDD's $9.99 per bottle price tag which cost it a couple of points on the 'value for money' factor. This definitely goes onto my 'special treat' list, and becomes a must buy when in Montreal."

"Truly a delight to drink. I really enjoy what Unibroue has to offer and need to visit their beers more often"
"Overall, I'm disappointed. I'm certainly not aided by the fact that my last beer was a La Fin Du Monde. Don De Dieu is still above average, but with so many amazing Belgian-style beers out there, this one struggles to hold up in my opinion."

"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium goblet. Two finger white head, reduces to very thick clinging lacing. Lovely unfiltered deep amber color. Aroma is something I have never encountered before, herbal, yeasty, unfamiliar to me, wierd and not entirely pleasant. Flavor is a bit sour, yeasty, herbal, not fruity. I have to say here that I have not learned to appreciate wheat ales, and I don't really care for this one. Mouthfeel is medium thick, not overly carbonated. Overall I have to say that I don't care for this style of ale, and do not plan on trying it again soon. You will get more helpful reviews from those who understand and appreciate yeasty wheat ales."

"Pours a copper/yellow hue with a very healthy white foam head. Has a sweet wheat and yeast aroma, along with some hints of fruit. Taste is sweet wheat and yeast, with some apple and honey, and then a touch of bitterness in the finish. Has a full body feel as well as a little bit of carbonation. This is most definitely a ""Gift of God," and is one of my favorites from Unibroue."
""
"Don de Dieu is a nice strong golden ale. Familiar Unibroue yeast flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice beer, basically to me it's a Trippel crossed with a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Quite enjoyable and refreshing. I like it a bit more than Duvel and Local 1."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A well-crafted Belgian Strong Pale Ale by Unibroue. Excellent spicy flavours coming from the hops and yeast. Doesn't drink like a 9%. Unibroue always knows how to deliver a great Belgian brew."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is another outstanding brew from Unibroue. The quality is always solid. You can count on an authentic classic belgian brew from this brewery!"
""
""
"Good beer with great complexity, though inherits the usual ""defect"" of several Belgians, it is overly sweet."
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer that initially seems simple, yet the more you taste it, seems more and more complex. I agree with the label that this is more like a Triple than anything else. This French-Canadian Belgian was a nice beer to accompany college football on a freezing December day in eastern Washington."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Little bit carbonated, heavy bodied but not too heavy."
""
""
"If I remember well, however, this is far better fresh, especially with the herbal, citrus dried hop experience, that is all but missing here at its current age. However, it's quite nice to sip on, and paired so well with a pork stew and stilton cheese for the night. While I usually don't drink beers of this style so much anymore, it's a very welcome addition in my fridge for the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Typically Belgian, outstanding for the pleasant overall flavor and the fact the 9% ABV is so well covered."
"Overall 4.0: Another triumph from the screwtop kings at Unibroue. Light, dry and very well measured, this beer would be fantastic with food and would make a lovely session beer. However, even though it feel like a light beer, it is a mighty 9% ABV. Be aware! Let someone else drive the hovercraft if downing more than one of these."
""
""
""
""
"750mL / $8.99"
"O - 4.25 - Great beer. Very smooth. I'd like to compare Le Fin Du Monde (their triple) and this and see which I like better."
"Unibroue Don De Dieu ---4/5."
"O: Great drinkability. Just another Unibroue masterpiece. No mistake!"
""
""
""
"Bravo!"
"O: Despite Unibroue's general popularity I've never been a huge fan of their beers. This one is different however. A very fruity and crisp BSPA. Sugary sweet in all the right ways with just enough spicy belgian yeast to mix it up and balance it out. Easy drinking. Very nice."
"Like a tripel-hefeweizen hybrid, this yeasty sweet bottle hails from a Unibroue mixed pack. Pours extremely fizzy, nearly fills a glass with white foam but settles quite quickly. Aroma is banana, other fruity notes that recall apple and citrus, strong Unibroue yeast and peanut butter. Palate is suitably complex, spicy even by Unibroue standards with some candied ginger and nutmeg, a caramel banana richness, orange marmalade, pound cake and perfumy bubble gum like Thrills (look it up). Strong alcohol character that is more assertive than in some other Belgian style offerings where the booze is stashed away. Rather sweet but some bitterness reveals itself over time, and there is a background apple sourness that adds an extra dimension. Not the most complex Unibroue beer but light years ahead of most other wheat beers in this regard."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 355 ml bottle. Pours a hazy light orange yellow colour. Nose has notes of tart fruit, yeast and spice. Taste is dry and tart with a lots of apple and tangy citrus fruit notes. There's a hint of boozy sweetness as well. Very big, complex beer with ample palate-scrubbing carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Try this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden with light white head that quickly dissipates to a fine ring and consistent effervescing. Nose is yeast, banana, lemon, and clove; not terribly complex but very good. Taste is much the same but is also vaguely reminiscent of apple sauce. Tart, with some honey sweetness, and plenty of herbal spice. Very faint note of boozey warmth. Mouthfeel is pretty good, lots of carbonation, slightly stick from the sweet but not badly so. Overall a very good beer, and one of the most accessible from Unibroue. Clean, crisp, and good all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle pours a hazy golden color with a finger of head. Decent lacing. The aroma is a mixture of malt, fruit, and spice with just a hint of alcohol. The taste is the same, but for a 9% beer the alcohol is well hidden. This ranks up there with the best Belgian strong ale's and, thanks to the reasonable price, will be a staple in the refrigerator."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer especially when I'm looking for the comfortable, refreshing flavors of a hefeweizen, but the alcohol punch and increased complexity of stronger beers in fall/winter. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice offering for the style and enjoyable."
""
"To me, this is a typical Belgian strong pale / tripel. Enjoyable Belgian, if that's your thing."
""
""
"O-nice flavor, really enjoyed this BPA"
""
"This pours a semi-clear golden yellow color with a creamy off-white head. In the aroma there is a mixture of banana, yeast, and spices. The taste is very much along the lines of a classic Belgian beer with yeast and banana flavors. Another very enjoyable brew from Unibroue."

"June 25th, 2014 - And as an update on aging potential for this one, I popped the cork of a bottle that was just shy of two years old. It smelled and tasted of green apples and grapes, lemon, pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, ripe peach, and sweet bread dough or sourdough pancake batter. There was also a peppery spiciness with accents of cloves and ginger. Bravo. I think the age enhanced it. A prime cellaring candidate."
""
""
"O: Anyone looking to try Belgian style ales would do well to sample Unibroue's lineup. And, Don De Dieu does not disappoint as it delivers a lively, fresh experience of green fruit and honey profiles. I will certainly be coming back to the Don in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first unibroue I've reviewed or even tasted but I must say it was very pleasant. Upon pouring, the appearance highly resembled apple cider with mild carbonation bubbles, and a thin white head. The smell reminded me of Spaten, Snelling of orange zest, yeast and apples. The taste was not far off from the smell, the mouthfeel reminded me of sparkling apple cider with it's carbonated bite. The 9% alcohol level left an enjoyable light buzz and I felt warm after drinking. While this is not my favorite beer overall it has been very enjoyable and I highly encourage new beer advocates out there like myself to try it. Beer on my friends."

"This beer really grew on me as it went down. I have it No. 3 of the four Unibroue’s I have tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An extremely well done wheat tripel. Definitely reminiscent to La Fin Du Monde but different enough to be worthy of its own beer. Unibroue has never let me down!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Along with their 3 other most popular beers, this brewery has continued to impress me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Nice but not the best Unibroue has to offer. A nice crisp ale reminiscent of a tripel. A good summer beer. Flavorful and refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Excellent. You can call it a Belgian strong pale ale or a Tripel Wheat or just call it delicious. I'm becoming a big fan of Unibroue. Complex, balanced, and full of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Initial taste is much more aggressive than the nose, as much spicy as bitter. The grain bill is pretty seriously pronounced with both wheat and pale barley malts. Moderately heavy mouthfeel is complimented by the substantial carbonation, which in turn brings out the additional flavors of pepper and clove. Very enjoyable and totally drinkable, though there are certainly examples of the style (especially if you're willing to consider Tripels and Belgian Saisons) which are even better."
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good and very tasty. This is like a hefeweizen on steroids."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: A great beer from Unibroue, all of them are amazing that i've had. This is one of the most flavorful wheat beers i've ever had, lots of spice and bubble gum flavors."
"Overall I think this is a classic Belgian style Ale. It is very bubbly and so fruity that it doesn't really taste like beer. It tastes more like a soda."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorites from Unibroue. I think this one is underrated and overshadowed by the rest of Unibroue's beers, but it deserves recognition for being an awesome BSPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best beers I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For fans of an aggressive wheat type beer, probably a good choice, but a little too much spice and yeast for me to purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
" but I probably will not buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is lightly floral, with a touch of pollen and that distinctive Unibroue house yeast character holding court. The flavor definitely lets you know it’s a Unibroue beer, with their yeast contributing that floral-ester character familiar from their line up, but there’s also a wheated ‘tang’ that gives just a kiss of tartness and a well-rounded smoothness to the finish. A Belgian wheat ale? It won’t replace my love for some of their other beers but this was a fun one to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm about to consult Mary Jane, and see what she thinks of this whole development. I'm sure she would approve, but I'll never know, until tomorrow when I wake up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is quite reminiscent of La Fin du Monde, but is certainly different. There is a lot more tartness and bitterness here than in that beer, but many of the same notes are there. While it is very drinkable and very refreshing, the balance is a little off and the ABV is a little high at 9%. This was my least favorite of the variety pack, and is not one I will probably purchase in the future. Still, it is good for its style. 15/20"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice pale ale that is quite easy to drink. Fits nicely into the Unibroue club with their other beers. I think Don de Dieu might be one of my favorites from the folks in Chambly."
"Oh, man, Unibroue, what are you doing to me? This gives La Fin du Monde a run for its money. Based on the full and gorgeous mouthfeel and toned-down hops, I think I'd even go as far as saying I like Don De Dieu more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, but not as good as I remember it being. Way too much carbonation to the point where it's hard to taste the beer. That's the only real downfall of it, otherwise a pretty good beer, nice touch of booze with some esters and faint phenols, nice orange peel, wit like spices, Belgian candy flavors and sweetness also get a little too heavy IMO, but still drinkable and tasty. Def a staple of a tripel wheat beer to try outside of Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"this is another winner form unibroue. similar taste to la fin du monde, not quite as funky. i may even like this one better. excellent beer."
""
""
""
"O: It's a bit like La Fin Du Monde, but with wheat. Enough said, really."
""
""
"O - this is why I love Unibroue. I mean come on now, a tripel wheat ale? I bought it based on that phrase alone and I could care less what it actually is. This is a Belgian inspired ale with spices that are spot on. Glorious flavor and a stunning color to look at. Every single Unibroue ale I've had is really something to appreciate and the Don De Dieu is no different. It falls in place amongst a great offering of beers from this Quebec outfit. Great for the warm weather that's faster approaching. I know I'll have this again soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has the same spirit as Fin du Monde, but is less intense, less sweet, a bit more bitter and carbonated. Which makes it perfect, since Fin du Monde is way too sweet and yeasty for me. If it was just a tiny bit more hoppy I'd love it, but for what it is, they did a great job."
""
""
""
""
"This is not my favorite style, and I prefer more depth and complexity as in the La Fin du Monde or La Terrible."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good. Not really my cup of tea, so to speak. I think it is a solid beer for what it is. It's tasty and if it weren't 9% it would be a nice session beer for going to the mountains or something."
""
""
""

"Overall: I am partial to dark beers but this one is quiet nice. Perhaps a little too must ester aroma and taste for me but overall, this is a nice beer. Sip slowly at 9%."
"O: Very good beer. Unibroue is my favorite brewery and this just strengthened that bond. Will buy again. I will probably buy a mixed 341 pack though instead of having to sit down and drink a 750 by myself."
""

"Poured this Belgian Strong Pale Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pored a hazy orange color, produced a average white head, nice retention and it left an average amount of lace on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, toffee, pear juice and white pepper like spice. Medium in body, this ale had a pale malted base, fruity notes, apricot and pear come to mind, there are also subtle notes of white pepper, and grassy hops. Dry Finish, creamy smooth mouthfeel. One of the top Belgian style beers I have sampled- This brew has earned an entry in my personal top 10 list. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O ~ Not my favorite offering from Unibroue but still a good beer, definitely solid for the style but I would take a La Fin Du Monde over this anytime. Well balanced for a 9% beer but like I said if you are buying this at a store I would take La Fin Du Monde over it anytime because they should both be available."
""
""
""
"Overall – I think this is a nice triple wheat or BSPA (which I view as having overlapping taste profiles and characteristics). Unibroue never ceases to disappoint. Lots of great citrus and wheat flavors along with a nice spice and warming feel."
"O: nice complexity and balance.just another solid Unibroue beer! still one of my favorite brewing companies."

"Overall, a really great BSPA which lives up to the reputation of the brand. Unibroue has become one of my ""buy without question"" breweries and I am still amazed that they are in Montreal, not Belgium."
""
"I am just imagining what it would have tasted like if i had this before its best by date. Seek it out and enjoy. A gem."

"O: Great beer. Very drinkable and feels light for the Abv. The wheat makes it friendlier and hides the alcohol for me. Not the best triple but definitely worth every penny. I'll be buying again and hope to share with some friends next time, but its all mine tonight, 750 ml of 9% Abv goodness for me! Good job Unibroue."

"O: It's what I wanted and needed. Great body to it with even greater flavor, if it wasn't so expensive I'd be downing this stuff like water, unfortunately it's not, but it's incredible. Well worth the cost, it's bucket list worthy."
"O- another great brew from Unibroue, and quiet possibly my favorite. Packet w/ fruity aromas/flavors, complemented by butterscotch, caramel, and spices. White wine is the only sign of alcohol. Glad i still have half a bomber to finish."

"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy-golden with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of yeast, fruit, spices and wheat malt. Body is medium and smooth. Yeast, spices, sweet pale malt, banana and citrusy notes fill the mouth. Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle a cloudy pale orange with lots of carbonation; large white head; all the expected really big aromas; mouth-feel is lively and thick medium body; taste has a light note of spice, grasses, pear and apple; slight presence of alchohol"
""
"O- pretty tasty. Not big on wit beers due to the yeast flavors, but this has a lot of apple flavors which was nice. Alcohol is very well hidden."

"Overall, I have enjoyed and loved everything I've tried out of Unibroue.... This brew is a good representation of a Belgian.... I like this as much as ""La Fin Du Monde"".... Very good."

"Don de Dieu may be among the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales to pair with a meal. The flavor of these beers can be so complex and intense that one hesitates to oppose them with food. But the flavors of this beer are subdued enough to invite one to try. Lightly seasoned grilled meat and vegetables would allow the spicy flavors in the beer to shine through without concealing them."
""
""
""
"Very thick and fruity. Pears and apricots dominate most of the flavor profile. Lots of complexity to breakdown throughout the drink. It would be better to split this one with someone. Would have liked a dryer finish but still pretty good."
""
""
""
"large format prices under 8 dollars. nice! the appearance is caramel colored and perfectly clear. a lot of tiny bubbles frantically racing to the surface, forming a big bright white head. the smell is sweet malts, bright fruity belgian yeast, and subtle alcohol. the flavor is very earthy. hay or straw flavor at first is followed by a malty sweetness in a heavier dose than i am used to in a triple. i also taste some spruce at the end, really fresh and foresty. the finish is slightly spiced and very boozy. this beer got me from moderately buzzed to shitfaced pretty quickly. it is all of 9%, thats for sure. the mouthfeel is excellent, bold carbonation and a medium body. the finish is a little sugary for me because it overtakes the grassy elements, but this is an outstanding beer overall."

"It's easy to forget how good Unibroue can make a beer. Don de Dieu is very tasty, easily drinkable and quite enjoyable all without making a spectacle of itself. Recommended."
""
"Overall this is a very nice, flavorful Belgian ale. Not sure if it is quite a Belgian Pale ale but it is definitely not a Dubbel, maybe more of a Belgian Golden Strong, anyway it tastes good. It's less fruity and spicy than you typically get in a Belgian pale ale, which is a good thing for my taste preferences. Not too sweet to yeasty; balanced flavor wise."
"Overall: This is the first authentic belgian brew i've had, and it was pretty awesome. I'll be getting more of this and trying more of Unibroue's products."
"O: Another stellar offering from Unibroue! A must try for all spiced Belgian Wheat beer fans!"
"best by date of 10-26-14, pours from bottle into a tulip. cloudy yellow, almost bananna colored, body with a nice fluffy four finger tall bright white head. wonderful aromas and tastes of apples and spice and everything nice, including bananna and wheat. for me the mouthfeeeel was a little too spicy, seemed to dominate everything else, including the sweet and subtle fruits. overall this is a great beer that i don't think will take me so long to try again."
""
""
"Overall I am very impressed with this beer. I am normally a dark beer person but I found this to be very complex with good flavor and a strong deep beer with lightness. Would definitely recommend this to my light color beer loving friends."
""
"T: Lots of Belgian yeast and clove, some apple seed and slight lemon. Mouthfeel seems a bit heavy, but this is another solid offering from Unibroue."
"O-Not overly excited by this beer. I like the aroma, but it let me down a bit in the taste and mouthfeel. The alcohol is not well hidden and does not have a ton of flavor complexity. Not my favorite brew from Unibroue."
""
""
""
"O-Too much apple for my liking. Maybe I don't care for apples in my beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- way too rich for me. my favorite for a long while was the Franziskaner Hefe, but it grew very much too rich for me. i'm getting that from this brew. maybe in an earlier day, but not anymore. got a really nice smell off the cork and there is DEFINITELY no hint of the high alcohol content- maybe that's the best tribute to this brew- but it's WAY too rich for my liking. i would still recommend this heartily, though. i'm certain it's only a thing with my tastebuds...."
"Overall - This is a style I'm not crazy about, but this is certainly a good beer, one worth trying. I love Belgian Strong Ale, but Belgian Strong Pale really isn't my thing. Points were deducted for the unflattering appearance of this brew. I would certainly recommend to try this once, but I don't think I'll buy it again."
"O- Damn near perfect! I wanna try some of this with some years on it! This just made it into my monthly rotation!!!"
""
""
""
"O - Really interesting flavor, I can't think of any other beer I would compare it to, which I find to be a good thing."
""
""
""
"This was also cellared for about a year and a half prior to drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fine carbonation."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange amber. Nice white head and bubbles from the side of the glass, some lacing. Belgian aroma. Belgian spices, faint malt, wheat present. Wheat/malt middle and end finishing with moderate hoppy bitterness. Well integrated. Another pleasant Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very well balanced, great flavors and very drinkable. Highly recommend"
""
""
""
"Take a chilled bottle and set it out for 15 minutes prior to opening it. Once opened, pour a glass, then leave it open. let it warm up a bit in between pours. The taste and smell change throughout. The warmer it becomes the more fruit esters and phenols blossom. wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
"I guess I shouldn't have opened this bottle expecting something at the level of Duvel. It's good, and it's a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but it's a little too fruity and too sweet. This is one of the better uses of the potent Unibroue yeast strain, but it's not one of my favorite beers."
"Overall: Smells far better than it tastes. Nice complex nose and then the Unibroue house yeast trashes it. So sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall - Does well to hide the 9% ABV, but unfortunately just a tad sweet for my tastes. Good beer, but not one I couldn' t live without."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The Unibroue lineup consistently delivers and this is one of the peaks of that group. I would recommend this beer to anyone and drink with a variety of food in any season."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had some commendable qualities but I found a few aspects to be a bit of a letdown. I really would have liked more sticking power on the head and a more rounded flavor profile. All in all, Don de Dieu is not one of the better offering from the usually solid Unibroue brewery."
""
""
"It is boozy, but the boozy is well integrated in the taste. This is a treat that I would never refuse."
""
"O: A simply outstanding beer. I would rank the nose, taste and mouthfeel as being world class. Too bad I only had one in the taster's pack..."
"O:  This was my first Belgian strong pale ale and I can say I chose wisely. An abundance of delicious fruit and a super dry finish makes this high % alcohol brew a delicate treat. Super easy drinkability and becoming a favorite fast. "
"Overall: Still one of my favorites from Unibroue. If the retention was better, this would be stellar."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 96"
""
""
""
""
"This is a great take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Easy to drink, great flavor, high ABV, another great beer from Unibroue. The only real negative here would be the lack of balance. Starts and ends quite sweet and creamy. Smells the same."
""
""
"Overall - Another winner, maybe not my favorite of there beers, but it makes a great beer for summer with its citrus notes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Palate: begins with almost creamy citrus taste. Soft is more of the right word. Moves right into the clove/yeast taste of these beers and finishes fairly dry and a little hoppy. Excellent all the way through, but a little thick so its difficult to guzzle."
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 3/18/2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grape, lemon, pear, apple, peach, floral, honey, grass, light pepper, and earth. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of big peach, pear, apple, lemon, grape, grass, herbal, floral, earth, pepper, and honey-like sweetness. Lingering notes of grape, pear, lemon, apple, honey, and floral on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a slickly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Overall this is an incredible Belgian strong pale! Insanely complex and balanced; and extremely smooth to drink . Outstanding!"

"Overall another great beer by Unibroue. Any of their year round beer remain quite impressive. A must for anyone who enjoys Belgian beers."
""
""
"Another winner from Unibroue. This is a great warm weather beer but I could also drink it in the winter and be satisfied. A MUST try."
"A very good example of the style and a relative bargain for under $9. An overall well crafted belgian."
""
"Overall, this is a good example of the Belgian strong pale ale, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. Unibroue is a wonderful example of a brewery on the western hemisphere that can brew just as well as most true Belgian breweries."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, every time I grab a unibroue beer I'm continually amazed at the complexity of it. This is the last of the sampler pack I grabbed and I sat on it for a month or two but I think I'll have to go grab another. Would have to do a sampling of all 4 but this is my favorite as of now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great beer, this has never been my favorite style but this one is rather impressive. It has a sense of brewing perfection with a rather impressive spiciness that makes this one stand out."
""
"O - No matter one's preferences, I can promise that this will prove an amenable experience. The spicy nature will beckon the lover of darker brews, and the texture will attract lovers of traditional ales. As with texture/mouthfeel, I believe that only personal preferences detracted from the overall score of this sensational brew. I will always be true to Trois Pistoles myself, but I salute another fine brew from Chambly's own Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable and very easy to drink, which is quite a complement with the high ABV. I found the spice notes to really add to this beer and make it stand out form some others in the style. Definitely one I would have again."
""
"O- How else do I describe this...simply outstanding. Although I think I prefer the crispness of Duvel over Don Dieu, this is certainly an exquisite representation of the style. Furthermore, I suggest sampling this brew as fresh as possible, as I don't think your review will be congruent with mine when tasting an aged bottle."
"O: wonderful brew - has some characteristics of a tripel. Unibroue (and Ommegang) are very adept at brewing Belgian-style beers"
""
"O-Overall, I enjoyed this beer very much. I'd like to try a fresh bottle and see how different it is, and how much age has really effected this beer. Cheers everyone!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Served in a tulip glass as recommended."
""
""
"Overall, I think this is really good. Carbonation is high, body is medium/medium-full, and it finishes a tad dry, but not as dry as tradition. Drinkability is unfortunately low, but you can't win them all. Its defiantly a sipper."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer here, great mix of flavors.... Not a session beer, 1 or 2 will do you. Well worth looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the last of my Unibroue taster box and they have all been good but all very similar."
"Overall: Sip after sip this beer is prime. Rare you can treat yourself to quality like this. I will buy this again and again and so should you, Salud!"
"While I don't have a lot to say about this beer, I totally love it.  Brings a smile to my face every time I have one.  Someday I'll have to do a side-by-side with Duvel, because I think I like this better...."
""
"I would suggest drinking this in whatever small 11.2/12oz bottle format they do as it got boring towards the end of the 750. Still a good beer by all means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It was promising at first, but finished just so-so. Not bad, but there are many better wheat beers in the world."

"overall its very easy to drink, but a little sweet, without any bitterness,which i like in beers for a balance."
""
""
""
""

"Thoroughly intense in the classic Unibroue style. Complex and totally drinkable, sip by pensive sip. From a 12 oz bottle."
"Great beer! Exceptional flavor and highly refreshing."

"Overall another solid beer from Unibroue."

"Top notch BSPA from Unibroue. Can't wait to try the Fin du Monde as well. Maybe Canada isn't so bad after all."

"D - Incredibly well built, very high quality, and very affordable. It's one I'll definitely have again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Just a hair below La Fin du Monde’s supreme fruity drinkability; I really should drink more beer like this. Props to Unibroue, as this rounds out its great line-up of Belgian-inspired beer. Worth seeking out if you have the chance."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, best before 08-04-14. This pours a slightly hazy goldenish color with a massive white head which leaves a lacing behind. The smells are of yeast esters, some banana, bread notes. The feel is medium, with lots of carbonation. The taste is pretty good, the obvious belgian yeast esters the bread malts, a slight hop bite and a little bit of dryness in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: B+, would like to enjoy again"
""
""
""
"Finishes smooth, lingering spicy aftertaste. This is a great brew, especially aged for a year or so. Careful to let the beer sit upright for at least one week and pour carefully to avoid the yeasty slurry at the bottom."
""
"Overall a great beer from a great brewery. This beer is second to La Fin du Monde from Unibroue for me. They make some of the best beers in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent but not my favorite Belgan Strong Pale, a little muddled in flavors."
""
"A very good beer that would be (suprisingly) perfect on a summer afternoon."
""
""
"Quite refreshing, oddly for the style, but welcome. This one is great with food or on its own. It warms well and might accompany conversation nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer. This is not the best I have had from Unibroue, but does hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice tasting brew with great tartness and complexity, finishes clean and smooth, quite enjoyable"
""
""
"O: This is a sneaky beer. I feel that the pieces of my review didn’t equal the sum of its parts. In other words, my review somewhat masks the enjoyment that I got out of drinking this. While no single aspect of this blows you away, you can’t help but appreciate how it all comes together. I will remember this one when I’m in the mood."
""
""
""
"O: Wow – this beer kicked some ass. Very complex aroma and flavor and enough alcohol to make it interesting."
"- Not my favorite from Unibroue overall from the regulars around these parts, but it is a fantastic beer, and seems to be made with great old-time quality. We all know they make great beers at a great price, and even brew some for Trader Joe's. I just never had this one, and had to jump on it. It had been in the fridge for a couple weeks. It's solid, but not really worth the super high marks."

""
""
"O: 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Spectacular."
""
""
"For a beer from Unibroue, this one is somewhat lacking. The aroma is floral and attractive, with all of things we all love about Belgian ale. But the taste is nowhere near a match: it manages to deliver some bready, lemony flavor, but overall is flat, spongy and directionless. They hid the ABV somewhere, because this 9% didn't leave behind much of an effect. Not something to drink around power tools, but you ought to at least be able to write your name neatly in third-grade cursive after downing a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great for a sunny afternoon lunch or hell just anytime. I would not believe it was 9% if it wasn't on the bottle. The beer has a complex profile but then finishes with a solid refreshing finish. I would love to try this same beer with some age on it and see if the profile changes at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like the whole bottle conditioned real ale, but im turned off slightly when i actually see yeast floculation in suspension. A good solid belgian strong ale, but lets tone it down with the sediment unibroue."
""
""
""
"It pours a medium bodied and dull cloudy gold in color with a one finger, quickly dissipating head. It smells like a tripel through and through. It is incredibly yeasty, and features some citrus and spice. It's almost in the La Fin du Monde mold. The nose is very soft and near perfect for a trippel yet does feature some slight alcohol. The flavor features plenty of wheat, yeast, coriander, slight spice, and citrusy esters. The flavor is really nice. It drinks medium in body and has moderately high carbonation. Overall this is a fine Belgian and again, a great beer from Unibroue. I don't like this as much as La Fin du Monde but this is a world class beer for the style."
""
"Overall: This does not feel like a 9% ABV brew, yet after one I'm feeling warm and fuzzy inside. Perfect as an after-dinner aperitif or if you're craving a big Belgian."
""
""
"Not really my style, but I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O: This is fantastic. Looks phenomenal in my glass, and the nose is unparalleled. Great taste and mouthfeel, and I would not have guessed 9% ABV. One of my new favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer everyone should try at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is about as good a beer as I can remember. It's amazing it's not a Belgian brewery because they've got this beer down pat. No flaws. Really, really a must have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- As one of my top 10 breweries, you literally can't order a bad Unibroue! I'm surprised I haven't had this one before either. Enjoyed the complexity, body, and ingredient in this one. Enjoy this next time you order!"

"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. Another great ale from Unibroue!"
"O - A great beer, but since I have not had many BSPAs, I cannot compare it to its competition. Although, compared to Duvel, it's no contest. I'll take this any day."
"Overall - Very tasty and balanced. Lots of flavor, strong, and yet easy to drink. Another winner from unibroue, fans of tripels, strong ales, saisons etc must try this one."
"Honestly, not that impressed. Average head, yellow/gold beer. No lacing. Smell is bready, sweet. A little funky, really, and I'm not a fan. Taste is sweet, fruity, not a lot of hops. Enjoyable enough, I suppose, but not a session beer. Mouthfeel is OK, not watery, full enough, but nothing special."
"O: I love this beer! I thought Unibroue maxed out with La Fin Du Monde, but I think this might be a bit better. I know they have their differences, but still, awesome beer. This will probably now be a regular for me."
"O: Tasty but not as good as I hoped for the stellar reviews. I'd definitely take some of their other stuff first."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet and yeasty, mellow and in your face at the same time. In the taste, dry, yeasty, and nice presence of fruitiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Easy too drink, sweet to dry nice fruitiness all the way through."
"D: I honestly couldn't ask much more of a Belgian strong pale ale, and in the NY market, this one is a bargain."
"Overall-Wouldn't expect anything less from Unibroue, another quality beer."
"first drink was heavy with peppery and clove. now that my taste buds adjust more of a lemon and honey. pepper and clove still linger but become more subtle. carbonated and light mouthfeel makes this beer just awesome. this is one of the more complex unibroue brews i have tried."
"O: Another solid offering from Unibroue but this wouldn't be my first pick among their excellent beer portfolio. Tastes like a citrusy Tripel. Flavorful, packed with banana, wheat, citrus and spices. No alcohol presence."
"The flavor offers less complexity than the aroma promised. Still, a tasty brew. This is fairly easy to acquire, as it's seemingly everywhere. Not at the top of its class, yet worth a try."
"This is a complexly boring beer. I get a lot of spices in the nose and taste, but nothing I can pinpoint and nothing I haven't tasted before. This is interesting, but I became bored at the end of the bomber."
"Nicely done. Not Duvel, but not quite the same style. A very good example of a BSPA. Worth trying."
"I'm not sure this is really in the same style as Duvel but whatever style it really represents it's amazing. This has just joined La Fin du Monde in my permanent rotation."
"95."
"O: Considering its strength, the alcohol is very well hidden from the taste, which makes this beer quite easy to drink (particularly compared to others in the style)."
"O: Again, I'm disappionted by Unibroue. I just can't stand their yeast, but I understand it makes many, many people happy."
"O - A good BSPA but a bit disappointing given my {limited} experience with other Unibroue brews and other BSPA's."
"The brew continually felt light and sharp on my pallet, leaving a tingle as it passes down my throat. Overall, I really enjoyed drinking this beer and will have to try again some day in the future."
"O: very easy to drink, elegant and smooth, hard to believe this is a 9% ABV beer"
"**best before date: 02-07-14"
"D - A satisfying Belgian pale ale. The drinkability is high for such a strong ABV. Yet again, another solid offering from Unibroue."
"O: An excellent Belgian Strong and yet another really strong showing from Unibroue. I love their beers and I'm always glad to have them so readily available."
"O- The best beer I have had in the style. One of my favorites, if not my favorite beer of all time. Perfection."
"Overall: A very good version of a Belgian pale ale. Nice fruity sweetness is well balanced by the spices."
"This beer pours a slightly hazey golden yellow color with a decent slightly off white head that laces the glass as it slowly recedes. the smell is belgianm yeast notes and some light malt aromas. the taste is full and you get the wonderful belgian yeast notes as well as some hints of bread and malt. the mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation, overall a very good beer"
"D -- Dangerously drinkable, very nice. I could see drinking a few of these, and at the well-hidden ABV of 9%, I could find myself in an odd spot."
"Overall really good beer from an excellent brewery, perfect blend of fruit and malts make this a very drinkable and refreshing beer"
"D: very tasty brew. mild sweet fruits and alcohol make this a great starter brew or after dinner drink."
"This beer was a very pleasant surprise for me. While I adore Unibroue and Belgian ales for the most part, pale ales are hardly my beer of choice. While this one is undeniably a pale ale, on a warm summer night like tonight, Don de Dieu is precisely what was called for! The color is decent, if a little light, but the smell and taste is ripely reminiscent of summer fruit. While evoking the flavor of blue moon with a slice of orange, the Don de Dieu rises above that bar classic and sits easily among the top of its style."
"The liquor store warehouse had this in stock, and it was the first time I've seen it for sale. In my opinion, it's right up there with La Fin Du Monde and Maudite. I will definitely purchase this again."
"Overall: It's a textbook strong pale ale and I like strong pale ales. End of story."
"M: Medium bodied, nice biscuity feel, coats the mouth well. Light carbonation moves the beer along, also the semi dry finish helps to renew the palate. Overall this brew is an amazing drink, highly recommend. Great representation of the style."
"O - Overall a fine beer. A nice lighter alternative to other Unibroue beers. I see it as a great beer for all seasons, as it is refreshing while also robust and flavorful."
"Pours a very hazy, golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is packed with tropical fruit and a hint of booze. There is a tone of pineapple and mango...A TON! Sweet sugar aromas all around. Taste is initially slightly floral with all those tropical fruit flavors coming through. This beer is one tropical fruit bomb for sure! Very interesting. This beer is very sweet...but not too sweet. I mean, it is sweeter than most beers that I like, but it somehow works for this beer. No alcohol detected in the flavor...hints of cinnamon as it warms though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat warming. Drinkability is scary high for this beer. At 9% ABV... no one would ever know. Overall, this brewery makes amazing beers and this is one of them."
"Overall, an interesting beer. The wheat addition to this style has a neat effect, but I don't think the experiment is a total success. Still, no doubt a quality beer."
"O: I really enjoyed this- very complex yet easy and fun to drink. This will definitely be a regular."
"Poured a hazed golden color with a delicate white head that fizzled out almost completely. Floral aroma, with scents of pineapple and papaya, light sugar, and a bit of spice. Yeast and sugar up front in the taste, with notes of banana and pineapple, with some spice following, and a mild hoppiness. Some alcohol warmth. Light-medium bodied, good amount of carbonation, and quite drinkable."
"This beer really threw me for a loop with that intense clover and cooked pea vibe. Honestly I didn't like it, which makes me think that I could have perhaps had a bad bottle. Although many of the fellow BAs here may not describe what they're tasting in quite the detail that I do (they probably have lives), I have complete faith in our collective palate. It's a bit strange for me to be so divergent from both the bros' and the collective grade. Especially when it comes to the world class beers. So I'm reviewing this now with the goal of giving this beer another chance in the future..."
"O- Fantastic beer from Unibroue - tastes like a cross between a tripel and a witbier. I would definitely buy this beer again."
"At one year out this beverage is incredibly smooth and well balanced, without any hint that it is at 9% abv. Fruity, refreshing, effervescent and downright enjoyable. A masterpiece!"
"Overall I hadn’t had this beer in quite a while and after revisiting it I realized it’d been too long. A phenomenal beer that sneaks under the radar. Well worth a shot."
"Been hoping to try this for quite a while. Worth the wait, and certainly up to the caliber of Unibroue's other awesome Belgian styles."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a nicely drinkable beer that I’ve enjoyed more than once and will continue to enjoy in the future. It’s a good example of a Belgian style Strong Pale Ale with some unique character of its own that sets it apart a bit from the style."
"Well....time to buy more."
"O- Overall a very solid example of the style. Its easy to notice that signature Unibroue yeast flavor which I happen to like quite a bit."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being high. Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer and probably one of the Unibrue beers I've enjoyed the most so far. Nice range of flavors, they kept the yeast spice in check and while they showed off some nice sweet flavors, they didn't let it get overly sweet. Pretty nice beer overall."
"O: An interesting brew - don’t know if it’s something I’d frequent - especially over Unibroue’s other offerings (ie, Trois Pistoles, La Fin du Monde, and Maudite), but its a flavorful and interesting beer for sure. Definitely worth a try!"
"It’s a great balance between more champagne like Belgian brews and heavier tripels."
"D - I like this beer; one that can be enjoyed slowly and with a good meal; great for conversation; more importantly, the folks at Unibroue have done it again, great beer after great beer; can't get enough of their Belgian, monk-based classics; keep them coming"
"O: Great pale ale brew. Would be nice to have if there was some good weather."
"Pretty much what I was expecting. I like the way Unibroue does beers. They're all pretty fruity, but top-notch."
"This beer poured out as a hazy orange color with a white fluffy head on it. The smell of the beer was lively with yeast and citrus. The taste had the citrus too along with some spices. The mouthfeel of the beer was light enough that you could drink a few in a sitting. The abv may get to you pretty quick though. Overall it's a pretty refreshing beer and has good things going for it."
"Hazy deep orange, 1.5 fingers of head, some nice lacing on the glass. Nice yeasty scent up front, leafy hop, honey like notes, banana, spice and champagne like notes come out. Taste is yeasty with notes of honey, light alcohol, sweet notes, vanilla and toffee in the finish. Big feel, high carbonation, full body, syrupy in the finish. Solid brew for sure that I will revisit as often as possible."
"Another Unibroue revisiting, this time while watching movies with a friend late at night. (Not that that really matters very much, just sayin'.) It pours a hazy pale amber-straw topped by a finger of stiff white foam. The nose comprises light lemon zest, light orange peel, coriander, clove, light white bread, and a touch of flowers. The taste amps the orange up significantly, joining it with some lemon zest, clove, cantaloupe, light watermelon, and bready yeast. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, another solid outing from a Unibroue brew. I seem to recall this tasting slightly better, but it ain't at all bad right now."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass. Pours hazy gold with a creamy white head with lacing that lasts well throughout the drinking session. Aroma is herbal, lots of coriander, Unibroue yeast, a hint of something honey-chamomile and wheat. Taste is quite fruity, lots of orange, spicey too with the coriander and yeast, some bubble gum, no real alcohol flavors. Palate is smooth, very fine carbonation, a bit of a warm finish."
"PROST!"
"This makes me say with confidence that Unibroue is my favourite Canadian brewery. For me, this is near perfect from start to finish. Its beautifully rendered juicy fruitiness makes this beer world class and places it at the very top of the style. I'll be sure to buy some for the cellar."
"Tastes similar, with a trace of alcohol at the finish. A lovely and complex Belgian-style golden ale. Very faithful to the style, and a treat for the tastebuds."
"O - A very tasty and drinkable brew. With such a boastful alcohol content, you need to watch yourself as its difficult to keep the glass down."
"Finish: medium finish with an array of complexity and sophistication."
"Price: $9.99 at Witherspoon Wines"
"M - Perfection. Not watery, but not overly syrupy. Carbonation is dazzlingly refreshing, but it doesn't take away from the flavor of the beer."
"D - Smooth, flavorful and easy to drink."
"O: A very drinkable Belgian-styled ale, and it hides its 9% ABV quite well."
"D - Not bad, it finishes a little bit sweet but it has all of the right flavor characteristics. The malt sweetness helps to bring out the fruity characteristics of the yeast, while the spicy notes do just fine on their own. There is a lot of pepper and clove throughout as well as a light, spicy hop flavor in the finish. An enjoyable beer overall, though Fin Du Monde is a much better example of the style."
"ABV is extremely well concealed. Quite sessionable at 9.00%"
"O: A very good BSPA--definitely better than most non-Belgian versions of the style. Unibroue nails the attenuation like always, which is one of the most important factors. This beer definitely holds its grounds among the best of the style."
"Overall I thought that this was a good enjoyable beer to drink, but it seems to me to be like all of Unibroues other beers."
"o- not a bad beer if someone handed it to me i would probaly drink it but wouldnt buy it"
"I prefer the crispy briskness of this Belgian Pale Ale over Ommegang's offering. Really nice balance between the horse/must flavor of belgian yeast and the refreshing balance of a pale ale. Lingering aftertaste of green apple. Reminiscent of a nice pinot grigio actually. A slight boozy heat as it is imbibed reminds of it's 9% abv. Recommended for a change of pace."
"Overall, an amazing belgian beer. oh, wait, the bottle says Canada. If the label was gone there would be no telling. This beer is pictured in the dictionary right next to the word ""balance"". Every characteristic of this beer compliments the other. Definitely pick this one up if you haven't already."
"the CPJ"
"D: Kind of a let down, overall it just seemed to be lacking something for me. Kind of boring."
"This beer feels lighter than it is and has a crispness up front that makes it easy to drink; to me this seems like a hybrid between a true Belgian Strong Ale and a Hefeweizen, and it has all the makings to be a session beer for me, even with the 9% ABV. A really tasty beer that I highly recommend as I've enjoyed it for many years."
"O - a fine after supper sipper."
"Overall: My favorite beer from this brewer. This is a great Strong Pale Ale. Hard top believe that they hide 9% abv in such a pale beer that looks like a standard wheat beer. This goes down way too easy and you do feel it as a result. Thumbs up."
"Very sweet with a very subtle herbal hop note. Drinks like a concentrated apple puree with an oaky dryness. Slight tartness to it. Full and creamy with subtle complexities that follow the sweetness. Yum. Leaves a sticky residue in the mouth. Tastes like mid-summer."
"O: This is good but certainly not as dynamic as Duvel and some of the other true Belgians."
"Aroma is strong, fruity and yeasty with a hint of malt. It pours a clear yellow with a thick and not persistent head - not promising, but at least there are plenty of bubbles. Fortunately, the flavor is impressive and pleasing - malty, yeasty, fruity, slightly sweet, rather lip-smacking. Texture is fizzy and smooth, leaving a fruity and slightly tingly finish."
"Overall: A good BSPA. This has all the requirements for the style and the flavours are complex and tasty."
"OVERALL GRADE: A"
"Overall, a very impressive beer. Extremely refreshing, tasty and invigorating. This would be a great strong beer for the summertime. I look forward to popping open one of these outdoors at a picnic etc. Well done!"
"Overall a very solid and very well rounded pale. I had no problems putting this one down and could see it being a nice intro into the bigger styles. Really a solid offering here for sure."
"O - I may have had some high expectations with this beer, and I am not dissapointed. All the talk is true - Unibroue does it right. A very adventurous work."
"D: This one is extremely refreshing and not too overpowering in the taste department. This one is easy to drink, but a bit expensive for a day to day beer. Nice little treat and finished the 4 pack by the end of the night."
"Mouthfeel? Hardly any flavor sticks to the palate...just a mild Belgian yeast with wheat flavors. Overall? Subtle Belgian style beer."
"One sip is all you need to prove once again that this is one of the best breweries there is. Slightly sour tart with malt and bready finish. The alcohol is there, but not overpowering by any stretch. Nice carbonation. I'm no pro, but to me this is more like a heavy saison, amplified in every respect. This is a really great beer."
"The liquid is a hazy, golden, orange color, there was a thin, filmy, white head and some sediment floating around. The smell consists of sour orange, lemon, spice and yeast. The taste is crisp and tart, the flavors that stand out most are lemon, grass, yeast and orange. For the ABV this is incredibly light, the carbonation bites the tongue and the tart aftertaste really compliments the beer. Don De Dieu is a top notch brew, the alcohol is hidden very well and the tartness with the fruity flavors make it very enjoyable."
"D - As many other have stated, amazingly refreshing and drinkable; esp. with a 9.0 ABV%."
"Drinkability: I like this beer quite a bit. I'll definitely end up drinking it again in the future."
"Good taste and mouthfeel. Masks the relatively high ABV. Highly drinkable and recommended."
"Nothing about it really jumps out at me, but definitely another very good and authentic offering from Unibroue."
"Good very cold."
"Very drinkable beer. Great job."
"I don't even question Unibroue anymore - they make solid beers, end of story. This is by no means my favorite, but a nice warm-weather quaffer."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper and a beer for savoring. While fantastic in smell, taste, and mouthfeel, and nice to look at as well, that higher ABV shows up quickly for me, telling me that this a one beer per evening drink. Still, if offered I would take it every time - a great beer."
"Pours as most Unibroues light and hazy. white creamy head very light and airy. vanilla and honey fill your nose almost immediately. such a smooth not nutty but ...kinda nutty(odd i know) apparently there is supposed to be some sake in this, i smelt 0 and tasted none. alcohol is masked very well. would buy this again and again."
"Carbonation and high alcohol might limit its drinkability, but given the wonderful flavor I think I'd be willing to take the risk!"
"The flavor is not as delicate with a robust raw sugar sweetness and yeast-driven spice making up the majority taste. The fruitiness is still there, along with a bit of heat. The mouth is thicker than I would have guessed. Still effervescent enough to drink a bit before getting bogged down. I'll take this over Duvel anyday!"
"Drinkability: Light and drinkable with a refreshing overall character. I would enjoy drinking this beer outside in warmer weather. Complex but not overpowering."
"Normally I love Unibroue beers, but this has to be the weakest entry from them I have tried. While it goes down easy considering the abv, there just isn't much going on. I guess this shows that even the best don't always produce something amazing, if you want a much better similar beer from Unibroue, try La Fin Du Monde instead."
"I usually stay away from Pale Ales but this is a definite exeption. Very drinkable. This beer is definitely being added to my list of favorites."
"drinkability; the alcohol is no joke, a tasty treat but to be respected and sipped. Really nice to relax with on a cold evening."
"D: The sweetness got very cloying as I got to the bottom of the glass, but it was still a nice beer from Unibroue nonetheless."
"Pours a medium gold/yellow w/ a solid three finger white head. The smell is that of sweetness- pears, apples, spice, peach. A little on the sweet side smell-wise for my liking. The taste is nice. Pear, apple, spice... but something's missing. This beer is solid, but there's something missing, maybe a little more body to the flavor- and a slight hint of alcohol. At 9%, I don't get any alcohol at all, which is surprising. Most of my favorite Belgians in this style have a taste of alcohol to them, as well as a fuller body to the taste. Mouthfeel is nice- very smooth. Kind of like eating a sweet piece of bread. Drinkability is really good- you could have several of these and not know you were drinking a 9% beer. Good beer overall."
"drinks ok. alcohol apparent throughout, but never takes over a very good beer, but not a great one."
"D: A superb example of the style, as Unibroue is known for."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. The lively feel really helps here. Alcohol wore on me a bit as I got through this one."
"D: I love this beer! Unibroue is excellent and I forgot how amazing this brew is, you must try it!"
"D: It is very drinkable. Again, the smoothness makes it a comfortable drink."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I drink them from time to time, but Belgians just aren't my bag. The high carbonation just reminds me of champagne of which I'm not a huge fan. That being said, this is a good one. I really enjoy the taste on this one."
"Very drinkable for abv. Tastes lighter than abv. Very tasty, but only something I'd drink on occasion."
"Scary drinkable for the high abv. A must have."
"is a pleasent pale ale that drinks generous. not full bodied like some other ales out there. not as yeasty as other unibroue beers that i have had."
"Pours cloudy orange brown color. Head didn't last long and there are only splotches of lacing. The nose is very fruity. Apples, pears and peaches are coming through with spice and Belgian yeasty characters. Lots of fruit in the taste as well mainly apples and peaches with white grape acidity. Picking up the alcohol on this as well. Finish is sweet and slightly bitter. Mouth feel is very soft and smooth. Like fruit juice. Carbonation is medium, just right. This beer is f%*# delicious. So damn drinkable. I can't put my glass down. Unibroue impresses me yet again."
"Drinkability - id say this is a good beer to have tried, nothing that blows my mind. Very happy and would seek again."
"D - I will give it another try (have 3 more bottles and because it is generaly well liked). Did not find much enjoyable but will have to get a better perspective on some other Belgians."
"Overall a good beer, wish I could cone it!"
"Packaging is a belgian 750ml bottle, with attractive label. I love the font used on the Unibroue beers."
"D: Smooth and very drinkable for a 9% beer. Feels like a much lower alcohol beer. This would be an excellent brunch beer."
"D - This is very drinkable as the alcohol is not even detectable."
"D- Would never know its high ABV which makes this dangerously drinkable and a very solid beer"
"Bold and rustic as all hell... I like it!"
"I am going to have to go straight down the middle for drinkability. The beer has fantastic components on it that are flat out fantastic, but make me wonder if it was ruined. It's almost a mix of exceptionally good and exceptionally bad. Never had anything like it before strangely... I want to try this again.."
"D: I treated this as a sipper partly because I generally treat all Belgian strong ales that way, but I'll be honest, this doesn't seem like a 9%ABV beer. It's delicious flavor and fairly hidden alcohol make this easy to drink. If I wasn't so careful, my glass might have been gone in a flash."
"This is the third Unibroue that i simply don't like, and find hard to truly appreciate. Sorry, guys."
"This has got to be one of the best beers i have had the pleasure of drinking."
"Pours a turbulent, cloudy apple-juice yellow, with floaties, and a full and fluffy white head. Retention is pretty good, not much lacing. Smell is spiced apples and cinnamon, licorice, bready and slightly pungent notes, with a diffused alcoholic undertone. Strong, strange bouquet overall. Starts off and finishes not unlike a hard apple cider of some kind, with a champagne-like prickly, punchy middle, and a dry wine/dried-apple finish. I used to absolutely love this beer -- it was one of my favorites -- but after a long fall/winter season of stouts and porters, this tastes too much like some kind of weird, spicy candy-beer. While tasty, it is too sweet and apple-juicey, coming off a little like some kind of oddball glorified wine cooler. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty good, and there's a lot going on in it; but I am not as taken with it these days as I once was. B."
"Overall: Not my favorite from Unibroue, but still more than decent."
"Drinkability -- bought a 12oz bottle on a whim to put in a mix-a-six. I'm glad I did. While probably not a word-class BSPA, this still blows away nearly all of the examples from this continent. Well done, Unibroue!"
"Yep, a nice beer, without a doubt. Spicy and bold, but subtle with the big characters throughout. Probably an easy beer to get into, but one which rewards you if you're looking for complexity."
"Don't expect simplicity with this beer. It is strong and the variety of tastes hits you like a hammer. A very good example of Belgian style beers."
"Reviewed on 2/17/2010. Bottle. Pours a hazy light orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet fruits, melon, citrus, Belgian yeast. Flavor of bready malts, sweet light citrusy fruits, and Belgian yeast with a sweet finish. A pleasant surprise actually -- very tasty!"
"D - Yet another winner from Unibroue. Really glad I got around to trying this one (thanks to joemcgrath27 for the hook-up!), and I would highly recommend it to any Belgian Pale Ale fan. Fruit, hops and spices come together nicely with this one!"
"A cloudy, straw-copper beer with thin, white head that dissipates quickly. Earthy, spicy aromas; yeasty with citrus notes as well and some bready malt. As it warms it releases more citrus and spicy aromas. Flavor comes on sharp and spicy, more malty, some orange zest and coriander or other spice. Medium body, a bit on the sweet side though; crisp, silky carbonation."
"D - Not sure unibroue makes a bad beer. Solid beer that reminds me of a homebrew tripel I made with unibroue yeast. A touch sweet."
"D: This is vary drinkable for being 9% abv. If it wasn't for the high carbonation, it would be even easier to drink."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - amazingly drinkable at 9%, classic belgian flavours with alcohol very well hidden"
"What a delicious beer. I am falling in love with Belgian style beers and I love everything I've tried from Unibroue."
"Paradoxically warming and refreshing. A wonderfully constructed, complex brew."
"Overall, we were impressed by this brew. What we liked most about this brew was its creamy feel, and the unique blend of tastes that, while lacking any hop flavoring, nicely control the beer. When you first bite into it, it seems as if the sweetness will be overwhelming, but the other characteristics quickly lend a hand to make this a delicious and balanced find."
"D - A drinkable beer for only one or two. Not sure I'd want to have more than that in one serving. Always happy with Unibroue's stuff though."
"Nice cloudy golden copper color. Initial thick white head that quickly receded. On the nose there are hints of mango citrus and a sweet buttery smell like kettle cooked popcorn. Tastes very fruity. There are notes of bananas, peaches, mangos coupled with a hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The beer has a decent body with considerable carbonation. It is definitely a beer one can drink any time of year, but drinker be wary, the alcohol is not obvious."
"This is an amazing beer that I had no idea existed. Whenever you think of a Belgian Strong Pale Duvel is what comes to mind, but I think our friends from Canada are beating them in a run for the title with this one. The fruits and spices are fresh and strong without being overwhelming. And for a 9% alcohol I can't taste it at all. I really don't hear much about this beer, but it is definitely one of my new favorite ""Belgians""."
"D - Drinkability is high. The alcohol in this doesn't hinder, and the beer is expertly balanced where the malts, honey, and fruit doesn't overwhelm and the finish is nice, dry, and crisp to keep the mouth from being destroyed."
"The flavor and aroma are a bit too bright for my taste; mellowed, with a little sweetness might increase my likening for it, but that's really just me. That said, this is still a very good beer."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden straw color with minimal head of champagne like bubbles and very little retention. Nose is heavy on the yeast with notes of watery fruit such as apple and grape, a hint of light sweet malt and even a hint of alcohol. Taste brings the strong yeast and alcohol tastes to he front, easing into the watery fruits and lightly sweet malts. Highly active, bubbly carbonation, bone dry finnish. A very stong flavored Belgian Pale with lots of yeast and alcohol throughout."
"Don de Dieu pours a something between a burnt yellow and a tangerine, and it's quite hazy. A billowing four finger bone colored head comes together, filling the top half of the glass. It doesn't stick around for very long though, and there's barely a suggestion of lacing left behind... very disappointing. Nose is a little better, but not great. It's largely pale, sweet malts. There's just a hint of clove and pepper from the yeast, and nothing really added from the wheat. Everything comes much more into balance in the flavor, to great effect. There's still the same, expected green apples and pears sweetness, but it's accompanied by a noticeable vanilla note from the wheat. The counterpoint to all those malt flavors is a big punch of clove and black pepper, with just a hint of coriander thrown in the mix as well. No one flavor dominates, each take a turn as the star of the show, and the blend of everything is delicious. Unibroue nailed both the body and carbonation. The byueer is surprisingly light for its heft, with just a hint of a velvety texture from the wheat. It's quite bubbly, but falls short of being over the top. There's no alcohol burn at all, always appreciated from a 9% beer. Don de Dieu and I started off on the wrong foot, but it really is a very good beer."
"Easy to drink, well constructed brew. Love this one."
"D: A very easy drinking beer with enough complexity to make you come back. I have not had this beer in quite a few years but it is solid. One of those beers you see on the shelf all the time and ignore but probably should not."
"Picked up a 4-pack of Unibroue brews from Rays in Wauwatosa. Don de Dieu pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger head. Has a crisp, light feel with great tones of orange, lemon, yeast, and malt. D-train recommends."
"D- Not the best from the brewery, but it's still a good beer. Slight flaws to it, but still a highly regarded beer."
"Like his/her Unibroue brothers and sisters, this beer is very drinkable. It's definitely a beer you don't want to have only one of. Bring this to gatherings."
"D - A very nice beer that moves into the Imperial wit category."
"Again, I am reviewing this as a witbier. It compares very favorably to most imperial/double witbiers out there. Belgian Strong Pale Ale my ass. If you like wits then you will love this. Hand a glass to your Blue Moon-drinking friends."
"D: Very much so. It is all around pleasant. You don't even notice the alcohol. Delightful."
"Drinkability: This is another winner from Unibroue. Unibroue hasn't let me down yet. This isn't quite as good as their tripel la fin du monde, but definitely one of the better belgian strong pale ales."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a large white head and a good dose of lacing as it makes its way down my tulip glass. The nose is somewhat complex, with some spice, alcohol, light stone fruits, and a touch of sweetness. The taste brings light citrus and stone fruits as well as a bit of spice and yeast. Some light sugars. Good mouthfeel with carbonation to carry the flavors. Drinks well, but not as good as the prototypical Belgian examples."
"i had high hopes for this one. I really like La Fin Du Monde so trying another brew from Unibroue was very exciting. The pour was nice and the fluffy head lasted for a long time in my favorite snifter. Smell was fruity and delicious as was the taste. I was expecting a big difference from La Fin but thought it was about the same only not as delicious. The mouthfeel was nice as was the easy drinkability. I'd go for the La Fin Du Monde when given a choice..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a dry crisp feel. Overall, this is a solid example of a BSPA, and as with all Unibroue beers, has a nice price point to help."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Another strong offering from Unibroue. I would definitely recommend this one."
"Worth picking up. I'd grab a few more if I ever encounter them again."
"Drink - Another world class beer from Unibroue. Not their best, but right up there for sure. Worth seeking out."
"This is a very nice brew. It is similar to many Trappist brews, but with a malty smoothness."
"The feel of this beer is quite smooth and sting retains a bit of a sweet sting as well. The carbonation is welcomed for the type of beer this is and goes well to spread the flavor around. This goes down quite well and is quite enjoyable."
"Overall, I prefer it's cousin, La Fin Du Monde."
"Overall it's a really awesome beer. Definitely a sipping beer and not one that you can drink a lot of. Would recommend it to other people. But drinkers beware of the high alcohol, it'll jump up and bite ya."
"Unibroue can do no wrong in my book. This beer was great with some crackers; it seems like salty foods bring out the sweetness more. I was going to steal my roommate's crackers but then I saw he only had a few left, and he likes his cracker breaks, but I fortunately had a box lying around. Anyways, great beer. Definitely pick up that Unibroue tasting pack if you see it... for me it was only $7 for 4 great high ABV beers!"
"750mL bottle. Pours hazy golden orange with a big white head that gradually dissipates and leaves no lacing. Aroma has yeast, ripe fruits, and some mustiness. Nice flavor with yeast, spices, honey, lemon, and sweet malt. Only a little alcohol is noticeable. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body, crisp, and a dry finish. Drinkability is above average for a 9% abv beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer has a medium body and is pleasantly carbonated; the carbonation makes it a touch sharp and spicy on the palate. At 9% ABV I thought the alcohol would be easily detected in this beer....not so. The alcohol is hidden very effectively."
"jd"
"From the 355 ml. bottle with a date 12-16-12. Sampled on September 16, 2010. The pour is a very cloudy poale orange-yellow with a long-lasting, silky, floating white head. It boasts a beautiful aroma of wheat, yeast, coriander, and other spices. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and of medium texture. The taste has both a crispy freshness and a satisfying malt and wheat character with a hint of pear in the background followed by a modest but delightful thin hoppiness on the end. The 9% ABV is hardly noticeable at all. A true winner."
"D: Almost dangerously easy to drink at such a high ABV."
"D - High drinkability on this. Not the most complex thing in the world but nice and tasty."
"Taste is highly carbonated and crisp, the yeast presence is a bit high for my liking, the fruit aspect is refreshing and well done in this beer though, some nice spiciness lingers about."
"Once again, Unibroue offers a great example of a Belgian style. The pear flavor really differentiates this one for me making me want to keep it on hand with alongside my Duvel."
"Probably the best name for a beer I've ever seen, especially to say it loud. Weird fruity, kind of sweet nose, but pleasant. There are berries and other dark fruits, and alot of tropical lighter fruits. Overripe mango. A lot of honey in the flavor, and mango again, almost too sweet but just enough bitterness to balance that. Very good offering, one of the best from Unibroue."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated. Drinkability is good, finishing the bottle was not a problem - but another was not what I was reaching for."
"Cheers!"
"Overall quite an excellent brew, I have to give credit to my girlfriend who picked it out on a recent trip."
"Cheers!"
"This is one of my favorite beers. Sweet and spicy. A definite favorite for me. Packs quite a punch, too."
"D: an excellent example of the style, it would be very easy to reach for another 750, but that would probably be a mistake. Highly recomended."
"Overall: This is a great beer and well worth every cent. Though it has high alcohol, great carbonation and expressive taste make the beer not only balanced, but elegant. To be honest, elegant is the word to describe most of the beers Unibroue makes."
"This is a very smooth drinkable beer and you have to remind yourself of the high ABV."
"This opaque golden brown ale from Unibroue does not disappoint. After uncorking, and pouring into a fluted glass the 3 inch head quickly formed. Smell was less than inspiring with rather flat aroma of mild (I tried so much to smell I inhaled) typical yeast/fruit. The taste improves the character significantly with above average but not complex taste. The mouthfeel was good with appropriate carbonation and clean aftertaste. This was an overall good but underwhelming ""strong"" Belgian pale Ale."
"Smells wonderful, a nice alcohol smell with a bit of a citrus. A slight spicy flavor in the background. Deceivingly smooth and creamy, but be warned this is 9% beer. It's wonderful one of my favorites from Unibroue"
"Don de dieu poured a hazy golden color with a head that lasted through out the beer. It smelt spicey and very strong. It tasted simiar to a wheat beer with a strong flavor and a strong spice flavor. It is easy to drink. Overall a fantastic beer very enjoyable."
"D: The alcohol is almost undetectable, the body utterly deletable, and the beer absurdly drinkable. I definitely think this is the best effort from Unibroue I've ever tried. Magnificent."
"Bottle from Allen's in Toronto, while enjoying a nice medium-rare burger. Poured into branded glassware. It pours a cloudy yellow'ish-orange with tight white head. Smell has a nice fruity sweetness to it. Taste has lots of sweet fruit with a bready malt and a yeastiness to it. Some spicing too. Very nice beer and one of my go-to's. Alcohol is quite well hidden."
"I'm guessing the plate of duck confit and ham tacos that just landed in front of me are going to be a nice match but I'd prefer crispy scallops with plantain puree and candied citrus vinaigrette."
"D: Very easy to drink. High alcohol is almost completely masked. Not as good as Delirium Tremens or some of the other. Could use more spice. Still, delicious and recommended."
"Great beer, sharp and predominate yeast flavours, but well done. Gains complexity as it warms. Worthy of a high score and a try."
"Great beer. The smell is licorice, honey, and alcohol. Golden color with not much, if any, head. I would compare this to Affligem Tripel with not as much head. It is between a pale ale and a rough belgium tripel. Rough meaning it is more cloudy in color than a filtered Duvel. This is a good one! If you're into this sytle try one."
"D. I could drink a couple of these no problem. The 9% ABV is non-existent until I feel it after the bottle has been killed. Wow, almost too easy to put back on a warm day."
"All in all a very nice wheat beer."
"D: one of Unibroue's more drinkable beers"
"M & D - Nice fluffy and CO2 mouthfeel. Very delicious and Unibroue is a nice North American example of of Belgian beers."
"Unibroue's Belgian style ales always deliver high quality at relatively low prices. I've been drinking their beer for years, and Don de Dieu is one of my favorite offerings. I like all the apple and other fruit that gets kept in check by the great balance of the flavor overall. In some ways, the flavor feels like it could be a lot more adventurous or delicious, but it's definitely a solidly above average beer on all fronts."
"My favorite unibroue yet. Wonderful flavors and silky feel made this an excellent sipping beer outside on a sunny evening. The beer seems to evolve continuously as you finish the bottle with the end being much more yeasty, of course but still retains much of the flavors. Very enjoyable."
"D: I think I just found my new favorite BSPA: this one blows the wheels off of Duvel with its light spice and wonderful orange citrus character. One of the most underrated beers out there. I love Terrible and Trois Pistoles, but after aged La Fin du Monde, this one is next best in the Unibroue lineup."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a Trappist glass. Pours a lazy golden hue with a fizzy head that immediately disappears almost as soon as you pour it. Dry yet sweet aroma with some maltiness in the background. Very complex taste of cloves, fruit, raisin, and some yeast. Starts out dry - almost woody, more oak than pine, but finishes sweetly. Some alcohol heat in the middle. No real malt to speak of. The finish to this beer is incredible - it's almost arresting, at once sweet but not overly so, almost like a lemonade flavor. Very nice beer and not like anything else I've had."
"d - A nice pale ale. Some smooth malts and fruit really come out in the taste. Would try again."
"Huh. This has aged into a good beer, but what I'm getting off it doesn't match up with the past several reviews, but I'm not sure I dig it enough to grab one to taste fresh. Nice brew."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, although not my favorite beer and i would definitely choose the la fin du monde if I was going for a unibroue it was still a very enjoyable 4 pack."
"This is a very drinkable beer that hides the alcohol surprisingly well. Will certainly buy this again."
"Overall this beer blends the character of a tripel with a rich wheat base quite well, it is fairly bold with many flavors and is pleasant to drink. I would drink this again."
"D: Its a sipper, but disguises the alcohol well. Lots of flavor, good balance, slow down and enjoy."
"Looking forward to try the rest of my Unibroues."
" D- This beer is like an Imperial Weizen, with the 9% ABV well hidden. The nice complexity has a nice sweetness without being cloying and it is very easy to drink."
"(D) i probably wouldn't drink more than one at a time, but i would enjoy every sip. i chased this one with ""La Fin du Monde"" - a duet I recommend."
"D - Superb. I could easily drink a bomber of this stuff."
"Not as good as La Fin du Mond, but it's not far off. Color is similar and it seems as if only a few ingredients were tweaked to arrive at one from the other. But this stands on its own as another great offering from Unibroue. But do watch how much of it you drink...at 9% it will keep you from drinking too many."
"D = 9%? No way.... be careful... this drinks like a session beer."
"Still drank pretty well."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Just a fantastic brew. Really enjoyed sipping this beer and savoring the complexity of it. This, coupled with wonderful conversation made for an excellent afternoon - exactly what beer is all about. First rate."
"Overall another wonderful beer from Unibroue. I have yet to find a reason to expect anything less."
"Taste is deliciously sweet and a bit tart. Tangy, highly carbonated with a bit of wheatiness...I am concluding more and more that wheat is used here. Touch of tropical alcohol, but not even close to the 9% it boasts. Very drinkable, refreshing even. Some grassy hops come through in the middle-end portion of each sip and has a scrubbing bitterness to go along with some graininess on the finish. Delectable brew, another fine beverage from Unibroue."
"The ABV is almost undetectable, and the effervescent dryness makes this one of the more refreshing Belgians I've sampled."
"Poured into a snifter, tan orange color with thick white head, great retention. Major carbonation keeps it up. Smell fruity and chalky yeast, banana and sour cherry. Taste smooth fruity and yeasty, mild bitterness and sour fruity in the finish. Sweet and lighter up front. Very good, complex."
"Beer finishes a bit dry, lots of carbonation in the mouth, spicy, with a slight sweetness and some fruit flavors in the palate. Overall its really good but I do feel like its slightly over carbonated. It does remind me a lot of a tripel. I would pull back on the carbonation, I feel it would improve it. It would be interesting to have this on draft."
"I got a 4 pack of this and am so glad that I did. I can't wait to have another!"
"I will and do buy this and most Unibroue beers on an almost regular basis. Their in house yeast strain is unique and complex which more often than not makes for some special brews."
"D - Super easy drinker. No bite at all."
"D: I could drink this one all day. Absolutely one of my favorite beers."
"This poured a cloudy gold with fluffy off-white head. It smelled like lemon zest and waxy hops, with sweet candi sugar and sour Belgian yeast. It tasted like fresh apricots with candi sugar and some sour yeast and lemon zest. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and refreshing brew, with nice taste (although not super delicious). The body is good not great, but the alcohol is very well hidden, so this was quite easy to drink. Very enjoyable and true to style, but not terribly complex and doesn't rival the best in class."
"D-this is a fantastic beer, great complexity with some very nice soft golden fruits and an excellent feel on the palate. What an insanely drinkable beer especially at such a high abv, give me more!"
"D - Another great beer from Unibroue. I can see myself picking this one up again."
"Easy to drink, the alcohol doesn't kick hard but flushes the senses a bit. The quaff level is super high, but I was hoping for more substance overall."
"D: This is quite a nice beer out of Unibroue. They make good beer, what's not to like."
"Pours a hazy gold with a massive, dense white cloud that maintains itself well. The aromas are powerful and well blended, spanning yeastiness, light fruitines like pineapples, and a lot of interesting spices (white pepper anyone?). This is not the candied fruit bomb of some of its competitors, and I respect that. Don de Dieu is an amazing drinking experience in every regard."
"Mouthfeel has a very pleasant feel because of the carbonation. I guess that is to be expected of Unibroue beers. Drinkability is great and the alcohol is very well hidden in the flavors."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with freshness date on back label. Poured golden honey colored with abundance of head that took a few minutes to fade to about an inch. Scents of cloves, honey. Well flavored yeasts upfront with sweet grass hops flavors. Smooth drink able nature and slighty warm alcohols make this very awesome beer."
"Exceptional beer, one to really sink your teeth into. Great with food."
"it pours a nice bubbly yellow, looks great poured in my unibroue tulip. The nose is a sweet, but not overly sweet smell. The taste is fantastic only rivaled by true authentic Belgian pale ales. I personally love a nice carbonated beer, it's a nice change from a flat stouts, plus BPAs are traditionally pretty well carbonated. This beer is dangerously drinkable. I put back an entire 4 pack of 12oz'ers without a problem. I could have had more. Drinking a bomber alone would be a simple task, this is a beer I will always keep on hand, just like La Fin Du Monde."
"Overall: The mouthfeel is carbonated creamy and astringent. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. This is a really good beer. There are a lot of flavor compounds."
"As for drinkability...high carbonation plus 9% ABV should get you drunk fast but I don't see another reason to drink this beer. Especially when Unibroue has other much better offerings."
"Pours a cloudy, slightly orange gold color with plenty of carbonation. A nice frothy two finger head sticks around and leaves pretty mediocre lace on my DFH signature glass. Smell is sweet yet tart with orange, coriander and some alcohol. Flavor is very unique with a nice slightly tart wheat backbone and what I perceive to be a fairly firm bitterness for the style. Various spice notes such as coriander, orange peel and a touch of clove swirl around with a perceivable alcohol presence. None of these flavors overpower though. All in all a very delicate tasting beer, something I can appreciate in a style that I enjoy, but is not my favorite. The mouthfeel is medium and very creamy with a nice tart finish. Quite drinkable, but you can definitely tell it is 9% ABV."
"Another great beer from Unibroue"
"D: The drinkability score would have suffered severely had a trip to the emergency room been required. Luckily the flying glass debris only grazed my face and I could proceed with the tasting. Fine brew from a solid lineup by Unibroue."
"Notes: This is amazing and special brew I highly recommend trying it. Really, seek it out."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a white foamy head the dissappears quite swiftly leaving almost no lacing. Belgian yeast is definately present on the nose giving off a sweet fruity aroma. Sweet malts give a backbone to more fruity notes upfront, a touch of hop bitterness is present and candied sugars play a roleas well as tastes of alcohol. Medium bodied and a little thick, it will coat your palate. Over all a decent beer, not a favorite."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is good, lots of fruits and spices. Taste is also good, fruits and spices, some hints of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"This is a totally unique wheat. I was expecting more bread, straw, grass, etc. Not red fruit like a porter or an imperial IPA. It's really fantastic. Refreshing, smooth, and full of flavor. How often does that happen?"
"Mango yellow orange with two fingers of foamy white head that quickly dissipates to nothing. No lace on this pour. Smell and taste are ripe anjou pears, yeast esters, cookie dough, pie crust, apple cider, cinnamon, and other spices. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with medium carbonation and some fruity tang, but thins out toward the end, adopting a pop-like texture. Soothing alcohol accompanies the finish. There's enough going on here to keep things interesting, and it's definitely a flavourful and aromatic offering. I could just use more body and a better appearance. Not one of Canada's best, but still a tasty Belgian."
"Overall I don't know if this is better with age but it is delicious!"
"D - ABV is well masked and with great taste this pale ale is great and will be consumed in the future."
"Drink: probably wouldn't opt for more than one of these."
"Don-de-dieu i a pretty good name for this. With a bit of tweaking, this would really feel like a god-given brew. If you don't mind the high ABV this is great."
"Pours golden and slightly cloudy with a puffy white head that looks like it will not be long lasting. Yup, it is gone now, but it leaves light lacing throughout the drink. The beer has a wonderfully complex nose with coriander, citrus and fruit overtop a light malt. A nice beer, but not terribly complex. Tastes like a slightly better Hoegaarten, with the same flavours on the nose within the beer. The 9% ABV is not evident in the beer, and it feels light on the palate. A nicely drinkable Belgian ale."
"Love this beer... Nuff said!"
"D-A very nice strong pale; a touch fruitier than some I've had before (like Duvel), but this is not really a bad thing."
"I've had both Belgian pales and darks from Unibroue and they are, overall, comparable. They're my go-to beers when I want a Belgian and can't get anything from Belgium."
"I think this is the best looking of the Unibroue ""High ABV"" collection. It really stands out in the glass with a perfect golden color, properly cloudy complextion, classy thin white head and tiny lacing as the beer descends. The nose is nice and strong with lots of fruitiness (apple, peach, toasted banana) along with the proper clove presence. The flavor is delicately balanced between fruit and spice and contributes just a slight hop presence to keep things in control. The ABV clocks in a little higher than some of the best known beers in this style, but still very drinkable. A great selection in this class."
"Slainte."
"Always impressed with the belgian inspired offerings from the team at Unibroue. Don de Dieu is no exception!"
"Drinkability- Excellent, Unibroue always does a great job and they did again."
"Drinkability: I must admit, Belgian pale ale's are not my first choice for a drink. I did enjoy this beer though, but it wouldn't be something I have very often. The nose and and flavor all seemed to follow the style quite well, and it was an enjoyable beer."
"Cheers!"
"There is a slight astringency, but still pretty well done for 9%. The crisp and refreshing nature makes this highly drinkable. A fine example of a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Over all: A great beer. I wish I had more time to spend on this review, there are some subtle flavours in here that I just can't quite name. Unibroue churns out some great stuff, but this one really does stand out. The 9% abv is well hidden, possibly dangerously so. I'd pair this like most white wines: with cheeses and desserts or even lighter meals. If you have the opportunity to sample this beer, I would encourage you to try it. This one is difficult not to like and appreciate."
"Two very defining smells from this beer: cloves (and a lot of them), and amyl acetate (banana). The banana is very very faint and you might have to dig for it in a snifter but it is there. The cloves overwhelmed my palate, and seemed to sit much heavier than I would have guessed in my stomach."
"Into a snifter: poured a hazy apricot amber with 1.5 fingers of white head, with spotty lacing. Drank this at room temperature. Smelled of mango, apricot, pineapple, syrup, soap, and candi sugar. The taste was very syrupy and tropical fruit-based from start through the finish. Creamy medium-bodied mouthfeel, but it took me a while to get past the overwhelming tropical fruit aspect. Not very sessionable for my taste."
"D - Very good. Similar to Duvel, but more complex."
"Another fine product within the arsenal of the Unibroue crew. Well done."
"Drinkability: its very decent drinkability."
"Pours a hazy straw in my DFH tulip with little in the way of head or said head retention. Smells... like a triple- I'm guessing that's the yeast. A little bit of sour, malt, and yeast on the tongue. Fairly highly level of carbonation. Plenty tasty though."
"Another excellent Unibroue."
"It doesn't try to hide its 9% ABV but if you aren't paying close attention it will creep up. Also, drinking this one right out of the fridge isn't a good idea. It didn't seem ""great"" at first, but once it got up to temperature it really did come to life. If you have to store your beverages in a normal ~38F refrigerator like I do make sure you give this one time to warm up a bit. Beer fridge is definitely on my wishlist this year."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It presents a hazy gold with a big white head, slight lacing. Sweet cloves are the predominant smell. Sweet spicy cloves are up front followed by an alcoholic laced finish. For me this is a medium bodied sipper, the alchohol is too ""upfront"" for me."
"I wouldn't add this to my regular drinking schedule, but is a nice and exciting beer to expand ones pallet."
"New to this style, but I must say that if this is indicative of other Belgian strong ales, I am looking forward to more of the same. Highly drinkable."
"D - Great taste but a little too strong to do more than a couple of."
"Value: As with other Unibroue brews, it's pricey. This is one I could not see paying ten bucks for a 4 pack."
"Pours a bubbly yellow color with a nice 1 and 1.5 finger head. The aroma is of fruit, there is a wheat backbone and also aroma's of pears, apples, and some other light fruits. The taste is of sweet malt backbone and pears, apples, and other light fruits, there is a small hint of hop taste also. The mouthfeel is moderately to highly carbonated. This is a very good and solid beer, a lot going on to keep you interested highly drinkable."
"Can't say I like the mouthfeel, despite its obvious complexity, and its drinkability can't be high if you don't like the taste or mouthfeel usually."
"A nice beer to savor and I feel would pair nicely with dinner and cheeses."
"D - good flavor and mouthfeel"
"I think this would drink very well with food."
"D: A very good Belgian strong pale ale, but I admit I was ever so slightly disappointed, given my past experience with Unibroue... but it's still a really good beer."
"By far the best Belgian SPA I have ever had."
"The cap/foil thing still irks me."
"D: Quite drinkable, especially for a 9% brew. A nice picnic/outdoor event beer. Good sessionability. Overall a good beer, but certainly not my favorite from Unibroue. I'd seek out at least a half dozen others before turning to this one."
"Awesome, awesome Belgian Strong Pale Ale from Unibroue."
"Definitely recommend, a solid offering from Unibroue, will try again."
"D: Probably not a session beer because of the high ABV, but still quite a remarkable brew from the folks up north. I suspect after three of these I might have to call it quits."
"At 9% this beer is gulpable. Amazing in so many ways."
"Great brew...very easy to drink!"
"Notes: Complex malts and very drinkable and refreshing. Slightly above average, but not one of my favorite Unibrou beers."
"D: So far, this is by far my least favorite Unibroue beers. Alcohol burn is too much for me."
"Pours with a medium head settling into a fine and lively lace, gorgeous hazy orange/yellow hue. Very aromatic with notes of popcorn, white cherry, guava, passion fruit, and quince with floral notes. Flavors of tropical fruit with floral and bready notes are prominent. Texture is medium with good acidity and low tannins (hops). Very smooth and round."
"Pours a hazy straw in color with a big head right off the bat that works down to a foamy ring around the glass. No lacing to speak of. The smell is a bit fruity, mostly wheat and the Belgian yeast is noticeable. The flavor is tart with pear and apple flavoring and the distinct Unibroue yeast and spice flavorings are apparent. A lingering yeasty bite is present as well. The mouthfeel is exceptionally light and the drinkability is criminal. If I was told this was 4% I would believe it. This is a brewery I feel would have a hard time brewing a bad beer."
"Aaah Unibroue, you rarely let me down. CLoudy honey colour with a tight persistent head which endured but unfortunately didn't leave much lacing. On the nose I straight away think Duvel, followed by a sip and I think Duvel. And there is nothing wrong with that. Not that this is a carbon copy, it isn't. It is in that vein of spicy strong golden ale but it a robustness that separates it. Probably because hardly anyone seems to be able to do a good version of a Duvel style beer when one comes along it sticks out. Great beer."
"Overall - A good beer, but not good enough or unique enough to select over several other Unibroue beers."
"Drinkability: This is 9%?? But I dont taste any alcohol...This beer does a truly amazing job of hiding any hint of booziness. It's very drinkable, but I wouldnt necessarily want to have a bunch of these in one night. Especially because I'm definitely feeling a little buzzed already. Damn you Unibroue, conspiring to get me tipsy without even realizing it!"
"D: The light body makes this beer go down easily. It has a strong spicy white wine character that I liked. A very nice match for a cold autumn evening."
"D: Very good. This beer is not too ""user friendly"" and maybe it's not one I'd like to have again and again in one sitting, but the flavors and aromas are strong and complex, allowing it to pair perfectly with certain foods or stand on its one. Very unique and interesting."
"Overall - My least favourite of the Unibroues I have tried so far. This is a fair way off the quality of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales."
"Easy drinking for a high abv brew. Great taste but will not replace La Fin du Monde as my Unibroue go-to."
"D. Very drinkable. ABV is almost indistinguishable. Nice combination of fruit and spice. Glad I have 3 more to drink!"
"I've had this before but haven't taken the time to really think about it. This is really an excellent brew that's one of the most enjoyable to drink - it isn't pretending to be anything but very good, yet it can be enjoyed by n00bs and true beer geeks alike. Awesome!"
"Pours a hazy, maize color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus (banana), yeast, and slight tart malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, citrus (banana), and slight hops. Overall, a good blend, body, complexity, and mouth feel."
"D- had to give Unibroue another try after La Terrible. The strong cidery fruit presense just may not be for me in these belgian strongs. For what its worth I enjoyed it."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a two finger foamy head. Smells of spice, malt, and fruit. The taste is sweet fruit and spices. Oranges, apricots, and pineapple flavor are present. This beer is medium bodied with high, fizzy carbonation. The drinkability is good, and the 9% alcohol is well hidden. Best before date: 12-03-11. Nicely made."
"D: This beer goes down extremely smooth this thing is deff dangerously drinkable"
"At 9% you'd expect to taste some alcohol, but really, you don't. As much as I am loathe to do so, I fear I have to trot out the hoary old ""dangerously drinkable"" cliche for this review."
"(D)- Despite it rather extensive carbonation level, this is actually pretty good! Very light and delicate, but it gets lost in how highly carbonated this is. This could be up there with La Fin Du Monde if it werent so off centered with ridiculously high carbonation!"
"Drinkability: a fetchingly imbibable strong ale. I should watch out."
"Really solid, refreshing Belgian blonde/triple, another great one from unibroue"
"Yet another winner from Unibroue, I can't think of any reason why you should not try this beer"
"Unibroue is available at The Andersons in Dublin, Ohio -- and this is a good thing!"
"Drinkability: Fantastic. A very easy drinking and truly delicious BSPA style. Unibroue is one of the finest breweries in the world, and that's stiff competition out there. Love this beer, it's one of my new favorites. Can't believe I haven't tried this one sooner. Simply excellent."
"D: Excellent brew and good interpretation of a Belgian from a Canadian brewer. At 9% ABV, these go down very smooth."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This is another from Unibroue that blows my mind. This is definitely something I could get again."
"crispy mouthfeel but the alcohol cannot hide. above average drinkability but not a five."
"Great carbonation leads to a white fizzy head that is constant and on top of a clear auburn body. A strong yeast smell along with a sour fruit smell of orange and pear; also hints of bread and caramel malt. Crisp carbonation and a medium body leads to a sharp sour fruit taste of orange, apple, pear and grape. Some sweetness derived from fruit notes as well as some caramel malt; beer also has a mild creamy texture as well thanks to yeast and breadiness. ABV complements beer by giving the backbite a nice, cry bite. A definite sipper and great version of this style."
"Cloudy amber with a generous head that instantly disappeared. Aroma, I get some fruity, particularly after Don de warms up. The taste of over ripe fruit is overwhelmed by the massive carbonation (not unusual for this style). Feel is light bodied with the above mentioned, big carbonation. Drinkability is above average for a 9.00 ABV"
"drinkability: overall I appreciate it and it's a solid belgian pale. Unibroue always hits their mark and sticks with the style. Another great example..."
"The mouthfeel is clean and crisp partly from the flavors and also from the fine carbonation. It is delightful on the tongue and finishes with a superb fruity flavor and subtle dryness. A damn fine beer from damn fine brewers."
"D: Again, it's like an amped-up witbier that doesn't meld quite right. An interesting concept for a strong pale ale, but it doesn't work well in practice. Probably will steer clear of this one in the future, especially considering there are so many other strong options from this brewery."
"My favorite beer from Unibroue is still La Fin du Monde, but this one is well worth revisiting. The more I drink it, the more it grows on me."
"Pretty damn good, but nowhere near the levels of near perfection some Unibroue beers are."
"T/M: A crisp beer that bites back. Lots of carbonation keep it tingling and complement the thick body nicely. Flavors settle in with a lot of the nose. Fruity esters although it is more of a sweet fruit salad than anything identifiable. Malt is much more pronounced on the palate. Alcohol comes through in the end to dry out the palate. Nice!"
"Drinkability is solid for 9% abv."
"Pours a beautiful golden yellow/orange with a very fizzy three finger head that disappears instantly. No lacing is left behind at all, a very clean looking beer. Smell is a good example of a strong belgian pale ale. Smells of belgian yeast, fruits, citrus, bread and spices. Smells like a german meets a belgian and makes a beer, has that german banana smell. Taste is basically the same as the nose, a good example of a belgian beer. Might have a bit too much banana in here from the german influence, still good though. Got belg yeast, spices, citrus, and fruits too. Mouthfeel fits the style here, pretty light with a high (good) amount of carbonation. Drinkability is a bit lowrr here for me because of the strong german influence but its 9% abv is very well hidden, impressive."
"Unibroue Don de Dieu poured a cloudy amber with a nice white head. Smell was of yeast, with some citrus hints. The taste was sweet, hints of citrus and hints of warming alcohol. Hints of white sugar in the flavor. Mouthfeel was good, very nice carbonation. Drinkability was ok, lost a little for me because the high ABV hit me a little quick. Overall this was a wonderful beer, great flavor, very well done."
"Find it, try it , and enjoy it."
"Drink ability for this beer was pretty high. The alcohol wasnt even noticed until the beer warmed up a bit. I could go through the whole 750 ml bottle in one sitting which is pretty rare for such a strong ale. Only downside to beer was the overly phenolic after taste that the beer had but it was still very good, would buy again"
"Drinkability: This is a tasty strong ale. I like the flavors and it is classic Unibroue. That being said, it is not interesting enough to make me want another."
"Another solid beer by Unibroue. Simply a treat to drink."
"A nice beer, possibly overachieving a little as it only just achieved a 4.5 for taste, raising its score from a 4.05. Unibroue is a truly great brewery, to the best of my knowledge they do not make a bad beer, and this is certainly no exception. Would make great drinking any time of the year."
"A tasty enough Belgian-style strong pale ale, and easy drinking, if that is really a thing when it comes to offerings such as this, where the big ABV is fairly innocuous, and so many other things divert one's attention from that fact."
"Light orange in body with frothy head. A pungent aroma of booze, citrus, and hop resin. Tastes of booze, citrus, hop resin, and acids. Medium carb stings the palate and the acidic qualities make this beer difficult to drink for a while. Unfavorably acidic and pungent."
"Unibroue always seems to surprise me. This poured with a deep peach to amber color. It was very haze and had a nice head. I got wheat and lemon smell as I poured. It has a nice wheaty taste and there is citrus present, primarily lemon. It finished with a honey taste. I thought this beer might be sweeter than I prefer but it is not. It has a pleasant tart taste as well."
"Overall: A clean, pleasant vibe emanates from this brew, from the bottle art (which looks great blown up on a wall-hang) to the presentation to the final sedimental sip; dangerously drinkable, with a complexity of spices that had me drink each one in the case before I trusted my senses..."
"For being as strong as it is, this beer feels deceptively light to medium bodied. The high carbonation probably plays a role in that. Unibroue has proven they can create strong beers that are light and refreshing and this proves to be no different. Incredibly drinkable for the ABV. Me likey!"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are Unibroue's specialties....excellent. Nice clean and crisp finish from a medium body. Good carbonation brings it all together into a damn drinkable product."
"Overall- A good Unibroue offering. Solid throughout!"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel, highly drinkable at 9%.Very typical Unibroue beer, they never let me down!"
"D- Drinkable, but the flavor isn't interesting enough to keep me on it for a while. Worth trying, but not the best I've had from Unibroue."
"Notes: For some reason I forget about this offering from Unibroue. It may be because La Fin Du Monde is one of my favorites. I will need to keep this in mind for the future."
"taste is tangy on the tongue, yeast, some wheat, very carbonated, lemon, pineapple, apple, no alcohol taste, and some spice, leaves the mouth a little dry and a touch on the bitter side."
"Good show again, Unibroue."
"Nice offering from Unibroue, I would recommend giving it a try."
"The taste is good. Nothing stands out, but the flavors are nice and light. Really nice ripe orange carries some slight sweetness with it. A nice cherry taste rides out as well. There is a pleasant and refreshing crispness to this beer. A little bit of yeast comes out on the finish, which leaves a slightly dusty mouthfeel. Again, another valiant effort, and would definitely like to enjoy this on a hot summer day by the pool."
"D: This is quite a nice beer, certainly on par with other good examples of the style. I feel like the carbonation and acidity of the mouthfeel detract from the flavor a bit, but it's still tasty. A refreshing brew for a summer day."
"D - For 9% ABV, this one goes down dangerously smooth. With little residual sweetness or bitterness and a perfectly dry finish, it invites you to grab another. Definitely not a session beer, but I could easily drink a couple without flinching. This beer is one of my favorites in Unibroue's stellar lineup."
"D: A very nice brew from Unibroue, although it's a notch or two below many of its more famous Belgian cousins. Good for the style, but not great, although I'd be thrilled to be drinking this most nights."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer, and this is rapidly becoming one of my favorite styles, so I may be a little impartial when it comes to this -- even with the higher ABV, I would totally sit through a couple of these in a sitting if the opportunity presented itself. Moderately high."
"Drinkability: Overall, this was a decent offering. Due to it being an import, it isn't exactly the most cost effective drink but once in a while, I'll definitely splurge."
"(After drinking this a few more times, I was correct in my review: I think this is my favorite standard Unibroue. Better than Fin du Monde and Maudite in my opinion.)"
"The aroma was of apples and spice. The taste a wheat malt with a fruity finish. Mouthfeel was crisp and left a nice apple taste in the back of your throat. Overall a wonderful BSPA."
"Cloudy orange with a pretty solid head of foam that seems to dissipate a bit too quickly. Nose is yeasty, spicy Belgianness, and syrupy, bready Belgian waffles. Also hints of vanilla and cream. Ouch. A bit sharp on the tongue. First impression is a bit of creamsicle with bite. Neither sweet nor style with a little bit of up-front acidity and a touch of astringency as well. Alcohol is very well hidden. Fairly complex with a bunch of tiny flavours I can't seem to get a handle on. The big ones though, are some orange and a chalky earthiness. Not bad drinkability for a big beer."
"Mouthfeel-sweet and I get some wheat malt flavors that are quite tasty with the yeast here. Not too rich, finishes with a little tartness on the palate. A swirl and froth on the palate gets the alcohol to come out, which for 9% is well-hidden. Nothing spectacular, but I have had three of their brews lately for the first time and I enjoy the bottle conditioned flavors of all so far."
"High carbonation, but not over the top."
"[2-3x]"
"Taste was slight of the fruits I smelled with a wheaty coriander flavor. A bit too overcarbonated for me at the beginning but as you drink it it smooths out. One of the better Unibrou beers I've had."
"Don de Dieu is my favorite from Unibroue yet, although I haven't sampled a great deal. That coriander note really does me right. Thanks for the bottle Russ, this is some good beer!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with heavy carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is prickly and actually a little full for a Belgian. Nice beer for sure, I think a little less ABV would make this beer phenomenal."
"Poured from a bottle into a slightly oversized wine glass."
"High carbonation and syrupy and yeasty finish makes this beer a bit tough to drink. 9% ABV prevalent, but this wheat trippel does a terrible job at hiding it."
"overall another solid unibroue beer this brewery has yet to let me down"
"D - This is quite drinkable. I want to drink more but 9% ABV makes that a bit tough. Definitely a good beer and one or two in a night would be more than welcome. There is no overbearing heat that I feared in a Wheat Tripel so it does go down well."
"Very good beer. It is definitely top of the Unibroue's I've tasted."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop. Poured into my Duvel tulip and appears a cloudy (I stirred up the yeast) golden apricot color with about an inch of fluffy light ecru foam. The head lasts through nearly the entire glass. Smells and tastes of fall fruits such as apples, citrus, orange, lemon, a touch of pineapple (a liquid fruitbowl), spicy yeast with a nice dose of sweet malt to tie it all toghther. This ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with lively carbonation. Great stuff."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer. Like I said before, this reminds me alot of a Saison. If you are a fan of those, check this beer out. I got seven more beers from Unibroue to review, so we'll see how this one stacks up. Cheers y'all!"
"I'm actually really impressed with this one. After having Maudite and Chamblay Noire I have been feeling that, apart from Fin du Monde , all of Unibroue's beer is too similar and not spectacular enough to live up to the hype. Don de Dieu revives some of my feelings towards Unibroue. Classy, flavorful, drinkable beer that I would love to grab a couple more bottles of."
"d- sadly I love Unibroue but hate this beer. A La Fin Du Monde gone wrong"
"D 5.0 - I give it a 5, but at 9% you have to take this 4 pack slow.... I have not had a Wheat wine yet, but I am hoping it is something like this fine Belgian SPA. Well done Unibroue!!! You have not disappointed my Belgian fix yet!"
"Other than some head issues (which may be due to the age of the bottle, perhaps...?) this is a very solid beer. I've had several discussions with my beer advocating friends about the Unibroue beers, and this one rarely, if ever, came up in those talks. Well it will from here on out! I have always had a certain fascination with this particular style, and Don de Dieu may very well push me to change my preferred style. Only time will tell. In the meantime, I will definitely buy this again!"
"This is a nicely medium bodied ale that presents a strong ans smooth finish. The beer is a bit explosive in the mouth, a bit over carbonated."
"Overall, just a wonderful, well made beer. Enjoy!"
"D- such an easy drinker i could hardly beleive it was a 9% abv beer."
"Somewhat cloudy with lively carbonation. Frothy head. Strong aroma of golden hay and yeasty earthiness. The taste is bright, clean wheat and some yeast. Somewhat of a champagne mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing on the palate. This is one of my all-time favorite beers in the summertime."
"Delicious. I have to say this is probably my second favorite Unibroue beer, right behind La Fin du Monde and just slightly ahead of Trois Pistoles because of the unique flavor profile of this strong pale ale. I know Duvel is the standard for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but it's been about 6 months since I've had a Duvel and I would like to see how the two beers compare head to head."
"D - This beer is somewhat of an amalgam to me. It has so much going on. It looks and smells like a wheat beer but tastes like a dubble or triple. The carbonation distracts from the flavors but it tastes pretty good and goes down well. I was expecting more but in the end, it's a solid beer. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Good but not the best Unibroue."
"D: As with all Unibroue's, very balanced and easy to drink."
"Not the best I've had from Unibroue, but still rates well"
"As for drinkablity, it doesn't sit well in my stomach, and the taste is only average, so I'm gonna have to give this one a pass."
"Overall, the best Unibroue I've had. Maudite and Trois Pistoles both disappointed me. Had La Fin before but don't remember if I liked it. This brew keeps Unibroue in the game for me."
"D- easy to finish, but one bottle is enough for a night. another success from unibroue. something ill try to work into my rotation."
"Notes: This is a very nice BSPA. Like I said above, it's not nearly as fruity or spicy as others. But in the age of extreme beers, there is something to be said for subtle nuances. All in all, it's another good Belgian-style beer from the Unibroue crew. I know, what a shocker! The unique earthy/woody finish does make this one stand out for me amongst the crowded BSPA category. Recommended"
"Notes: Another successful Belgian style Ale from Unibroue!"
"i am surprised by how much i dont like this beer because i love most of their other products."
"Overall - Unibroue never fails to make a good Belgian interpretation and this is no exception. Nearly reminiscent of a tripel, but a huge touch of light fruits. A very good brew by a very good brewery."
"One word sums it up: pleasurable. It has heart and soul of a filling tasty Belgian style beer while also being truly refreshing. Came in with no expectations or preconceived notions, walking away impressed."
"Drinkability. The 9% alcohol is masked very well. Be careful to sip it and not drink it to fast."
"It pours almost orange with an ivory head. The carbonation holds up for a good fifteen minutes. This is one delicious beer. The aroma just jumps out as you before the glass gets near your mouth. And what an aroma - full of ripe peaches and home made toffee but not the least artificial - somehow clean on top of the fruitiness. The taste is even better -round and malty with just the right hints of fruit and spices to make every mouthful a joy. There certainly is some alcohol and wheatiness that give it spunk. The name means something like gift of God and that would be silly for most beers but not this one."
"Incredible in all aspects. It will be a tough decision whether to buy this one or La Fin Du Monde when I am in the mood for unibroue"
"D: One word sums it up: pleasurable. It has heart and soul of a filling tasty Belgian style beer while also being truly refreshing. Came in with no expectations or preconceived notions, walking away impressed."
"I do find that Unibroue's Belgian lineup can be, in some ways, a little monotonous. I also feel, however, that some of these Belgian style ales have been among the best that I've ever tasted. They make me grateful to have taste buds. Don De Dieu isn't my favourite of that bunch but it certainly deserves a spot on the cellar shelf just as much as the rest of them."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer, and one that exemplifies the style."
"Pours a dark gold in color, with a highly carbonated head forming on top. Smell is floral and fruity. Plenty of ripe fruit, mostly lighter fruits. Taste is delicious juicy fruits, some noticeable, typical unibroue yeast. Very bubbly mouthfeel and very easy drinking. Could drink a lot of this."
"Medium bodied with good amounts of carbonation, mildy sweet citrusy aftertaste. For 9% alc this surely does hide it well making this very drinkable. Overall another great beer from Unibroue"
"D: Tasty, but it feels like there's something missing. Could use a bit more complexity."
"D- Its fine but its just fine I'm not sure if its a belgian beer thing but the beers I've tried so far seem to be way over carbonated."
"Carbonation level is high in this one. Very crisp and fizzy in the mouth. I'd prefer it a tad smoother. Flavor is of pineapple, banana, vanilla, with a slight hop kick in the end. Finishes bready and leaves a tart aftertaste. Not bad. Drinkability is alright on this one, but there's a few things they could improve on for sure."
"D- Took me 3 days to get to the Don, but was happy when I finally go to this. Poured into a pint glass. Was being pestered by mother-in-law's boyfriend the whole time to finally open the La Fin Du Monde, because he loved the name, so somewhat detracted from this delightful little beer I had. I have always enjoyed the beers from unibroue, since my first trois pistoles for christmas"
"An excellent brew - worth checking out!"
"Had another on 1/2/10... small bottle, but still, fantastic beer. I'm picking up some caramel malt this time around, maybe even better."
"Appearance is a misty gold in color with with a thick crisp head. Smell has a wheaty, fruity nuttiness. Taste has an upfront wheat that ends in a fruity, but lightly bitter/sour. Mouthfeel is full, creamy with a good bite of carbonation. A good balanced ale, maybe not my alltime favorite, but one to savor."
"You can feel the carbonation hitting your lips your first few sips. Feels pretty light (for a 9% beer) and goes down pretty smooth. Definatly would like some of these in the summertime."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, I've certainly had better in the style, but it's still a decent beer."
"Taste is banana up front with a clove spice. There is a sweet taste that hits the mouth as the beer goes down. Bit of a medium body with higher carbonation. nice high ABV wheat style."
"Drink often."
"D: Don de Dieu is very drinkable. It has a nice balance, but its slight lean towards crispness makes it feel like a good summer beverage. Out of Unibroue's pale offerings, this is the standout. However, it doesn't compare against their dark ales in my mind."
"I typically don't care for wheat beers and the jury is still out on BSPAs...but I did actually enjoy this beer and thought it had a pretty high drinkability. Not one of my favorite beers but I believe it is a high representation of its style."
"I could honestly drink this beer all day, even at its 9% abv. The alcohol is hardly noticeable, and the taste, smell, and overall presence of the beer is incredible. Another great beer from Unibroue."
"poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. pours a cloudy yellow golden color with some orange hues. nice soapy head that faded to a nice ring of foam fairly quickly. not much lacing to speak of. in the nose their are some strong aromas of yeast (banana, clove phenolics) with some wheat and alcohol. very nice flavor going on here, im loving it! very yeasty with some wheat. hides the alcohol very well. it kind if tingles the tongue a little on the finish. carbonation is about medium, perfect for this beer. its very drinkable, but like most belgian beers with a high abv, it really creeps up on you so you have to be careful with these. unibroue makes some of the best belgian beers on the market (almost better than real belgians) and this one is definately one of their staples. this triple wheat ale is definately worth a try. i plan on getting some of this to age in the cellar for awhile."
"Smooth feel, great taste, and hidden alcohol combine to create a beer that begs you to keep taking big sips. Watchout!!"
"This is a very drinkable beer and its cirtus character as well as its extraordinary balance make it quite refreshing. This would be fantastic on a hot day. Give it a try!"
"D: This is a hard one, not something I would drink a lot of while hanging out. But something that is fantastic for a night cap, or an afternoon beer. Maybe I should get a meat and cheese plate to go with it."
"The first sip lets you know this is a good bear. Starts off dry with some grassy malt flavor that turns into a sweet, lingering finish. Not much bitterness, but great balance and character. A very lively and refreshing beer. I like this better than Duvel; it's not quite as drying."
"M/D - nicely carbonated and very crisp. Very easy to drink if you like the flavor and the alcohol is hardly noticable"
"Brewed November '07, consumed with an Ontario fresh water perch dinner, coated in milk and free range egg, my own crushed crackers concoction and pan fried in olive oil. My Canada includes Unibroue, white foamy head and a clear gold beer clouded by lees at last pour, honey murky colour. Head shrunk to a thin film with very nice lacing and a solid ring. Smell of tangerine, clementine, citrusy nose carries over to the taste. Effervescent mouthfeel, refreshing, alcohol well hidden, muted bitter, understated malt, big time yeast is well received. This is truly delicious. With warming, the ABV is a bit more apparent , bitterness more pronounced, smack of lemon-lime in the finish, but still exceedingly drinkable. I really enjoyed this brew, excellent example of the style IMHO, thanks for sharing biegaman."
"Future outlook: Another rock-solid offering from Unibroue. I'm sure I'll be back...."
"Drinkabilty- THIS beer is dangerously drinkable with having a 9.0 alcohol percentage. A REALLY GOOD BEER OF ITS STYLE. My degen bro is having with Mexican food and says it killer, great beer."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable...tastes like a tripel with much more alcohol burn. It does taste a little...unrefined, is the best word I can come up with. I definitely know I'm drinking something strong with this one. Definitely a sipper."
"Pours hazy golden yellow with a huge billowy white head. Aroma is a delightful combination of yeast, bubblegum, banana, and green apples. Taste is very clean and refreshing with a tart finish and some spiciness. Body is light with a almost excessive amount of carbonation. A very good brew to just savor."
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a head that fizzes like soda. Nose consists of light fruit aromas, cloves, and maybe yeast. Taste begins with a healthy dose of the clove and spice, with lighter notes of coriander, yeast, and mild hop. Slight boozy alcohol warmth is present if you drink quickly (I had a hard time putting the glass down). Light on the palate in spite of it's carbonation, also, the ABV is not really prominent here. Nice beer. I'm still kinda hit-or-miss on Belgian styles, but this brewery in particular is impressive."
"D - Great beer from the Unibroue family"
"Notes: It's very interesting to read other reviews - a lot of which center on overpowered carbonation. I am usually the first person to complain about that but I don't see it here. I did the standard BA pour - 50% at 45-degrees, 50% at 90% for head. The carbonation is subdued and perfect from my 750ml bomber pours. I bought this on a lark and can't wait to stock up on more."
"Full, if delicate, one finger head of tiny cream white bubbles, minimal lacing. Cloudy zinc orange to yellow squash in color, just light enough to allow you to view tiny bubble streams within. Clove, licorice, cinnamon, ginger spice form the backbone of the nose with plenty of flesh to be found in the orange, tangerine citrus and banana, pear, apricot scents, some yeasty softness but that's about it. Medium-bodied and actually less dense and more openly constructed than the sweetness of the flavors might suggest. The same array of spices appear here, the orange citrus joined by a brush of lemon. The yeast, raw pie dough starts to take on a honeyed feel before notes of straw and wheat balance them out. The carbonation is subtly aggressive and lengthens the whole, particularly the banana, peach, pear, red cherry fruit."
"D: Decent sipping beer."
"This beer has a nice balance of sweetness up front and dryness at the end. I could drink a few of these."
"Seems like a tripel to me, but maybe that's not so far from a belgian strong pale ale. The beer is a nice light golden straw color. I love the smell, reminiscent of apricots with a cinnamonish glance. The taste is very quality. Rich smooth maltiness with a bit of that fruit coming through, so although it's a pale ale, I don't taste too much hops influence. Reminds me a bit of Leffe Blonde, but with a little more juice/flavor profile. The aftertaste is nice and smooth and I find this beer extremely drinkable. I could easily drink 2-3 in a sitting, but I will hold back because of the strength and move on to something a bit more moderate."
"Drinkability is very good, a tasty beer and a fantastic value, this is one of the reasons that Unibroue arguably the best brewery out there, pumping out beers like this year round for only $3.50/750ml!!!"
"Notes - It just tastes like Belgian sunsets over golden wheat fields. That or I'm just high as giraffe pussy."
"A good beer from a great brewery. Everything the style should be, but it is not my favorite of the style or brewery. Something I would recommend though."
"Poured into sturdy chalice. Poured about 1 1/2 inches of sharp white head of mostly large bubbles. The head dissipated quickly leaving very minimal lacing. A deep, hazy, straw color. A sharp, spicy aroma. Taste follows aroma very closely. The spicieness mellows and leaves a very pleasant tartness on the tongue. Smooth, full body that is still light and not at all sticky. Very drinkable, but use caution because this beer hides its alcohol very well. An excellent example of the style from a brewery that does a wonderful job with their whole line."
"I am very pleasantly surprised by this offering. I know different styles and whatnot, but I'm liking this more than the other Unibroue offerings I've had, LFDM and TP. I need to buy more, now."
"Overall a really good beer. I can foresee the 4-pack being gone before the night grows old."
"Leaves an excellent taste behind. This beer for a 9% is extremely easy to drink and extremely delicious. What a solid beer."
"D: First review since the new year. I picked up a four pack of this, La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, and Trois Pistoles for under 15 bucks at Costco. This is very drinkable and at 9% it will still disappear quickly. I've seen this around constantly and I wish I would have tried it a lot sooner."
"Great belgian funk, great beer all around."
"Drinkability is off the goddamn charts. As I said, the 9% abv is so wholly unapparent that one could easily attempt to take on an entire four-pack in one sitting. I'm sure that would lead to a decent headache, but I'm just saying that this stuff makes it a possibility."
"Notes- over all, I find I am really enjoying this beer. I like Unibroue, but for some reason I came into Don de Dieu with low expectations. Happily, I was met with a very respectable beer."
"Overall - Very nice brew that finishes crisp and dry."
"D. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"Overall this is a great beer and very easy to drink. Highly recommended. Great beer and the high abv isn't even noticable."
"A nice sipper and a fine example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"(rated Jul 17, 2007)"
"D-Enjoyable. A good Belgian pale, tasty and smooth, but also quite complex."
"Pours hazy but bright yellow with a huge white head. Lots of bubbles in this one. Banana, yeast, champagne, green apples, and bubble gum in the nose. Taste was a cross between a trippel and a German hefe. Bubblegum and banana aplenty up front. Tart pear and apple bite in the middle, and finishes with a sweet, spicy coriander, orange, yeast concoction. The over-effervescence of the carbonation detracted from this, but it was still a good brew."
"The beer is gold-colored with a fizzy head that disappears quickly and entirely. There was just about no lacing. All of the Unibroue beers seem to pour better out of the 750ml bottles than the small bottles. This was a small bottle from the sampler pack, so I'll try to pick it up again later and revisit the appearance, particularly. Anyway, the aroma was the high point of the beer. There's plenty of spicy wheat notes in the aroma with alcohol, fruit and bread coming along as well. Unfortunately, these flavors don't all come through in the flavor. The wheat flavor should be amped up because the Unibroue yeast tends to dominate over much. The feel is nice and sparkly with lots of good carbonation."
"Taste was again quite fruity. Maybe some bannana up in the mix. Again alcohol is evident but this sucker is drinkable as hell! On that note maybe I'll run and get a 4pack right now"
"D: Incredibly smooth with no hints of its 9.0%abv. A crisp, thirst quenching, lemony summer time drink that is everybit as refreshing in the last sip as the first."
"Taste offers a bit of light fruit and a malty sweetness with a firm carbonation. Very deceiving for its strength with a slightly sweet and lingering effervescent citrus finish. Carbonation is rather high as for the feel of the beer, yet seems quite appropriate for the style, lending a strong drinkability nonetheless."
"Pours a cloudy orange/yellow colored body, with a smallish head, that is diminishing. Has a strong aroma of hops, lavender, perfume, some alcohol, and sweetness. Has a very fizzy palate, a taste of alcohol, flowers, medium body with a clean finish."
"Taste: Nothing spectacular about it, but it's still pretty good. It just seems like I've ""been there and done that"" after having a few other Unibroue beers. There beers are just too similar to each other."
"My first Belgian Strong Pale Ale.. that's a mouthful. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with lots of ascending bubbles. Not much head or lacing going on even after an aggressive pour. Smell isn't too pleasant.. almost a rubbing alcohol kind of aroma? Taste is much better though.. nice and spicy and smooth. A nice full body with a snappy finish. Alcohol is hidden very well, but somehow it smells like it.. weird huh? Either way, a pretty good, but not great, beer."
"D- my favorite unibroue to date, this certainly is a gift from god. almost on par with my beloved duvel, yet very different. nearly irresistible once in my glass, i had plans to pair the other half of this bottle with some chorizo and locally made longhorn cheese but those dreams have been shattered."
"Outstanding drinkability. This is a sipper, through and through. Don't be fooled... this one will sneak up on you. I would have this again in a heartbeat. Great beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with thick foamy head that settles into a nice lacing that lasts throughout. Lots of visible carbonation bubbling up. Aroma is kind of bland consisting of crisp, light fruit and strong alcohol presence. This beer was way too carbonated and sweet tasting with a very dry finish."
"I'd like to have this next to La Fin du Monde so I could really pick apart the differences. Otherwise, it's similar for the drinkablilty and spices. This, however, is a wheat beer and when I think about it, I can see the links between this and a lesser-strength wit. There's a very smooth creamy malt flavor with spicy vanilla, orange, and lemon. Yum. If you love wit's and tripels, this is a tasty hybrid of the two."
"D: This one is almost scary drinkable. It is so creamy smooth with such a clean finish it is easy to really knock these back. I wish I had another so I could knock it back."
"Best before 3/07, this one is well aged. Poured into a small tulip glass and was given a vibrant light golden ale with a huge white head, serious lacing, and intense carbonation. Light fruity aroma with some spicy notes and that signature Unibroue yeastiness. Light and fizzy on the palate, mellow going down. Flavor is light and malty with lots of fresh fruits blended with a medium spiciness. Hides the sturdy alcohol content real well. Unibroue's underlying yeasty flavor is well present, this is a refreshing tasty brew with a quick kick. Very nice indeed."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/3.5"
"A golden color with very very fizzy carbonation. I can smell apple juice and grapes in here, along with some spiciness. A sweet taste in front with a sour aftertaste. Fruity spicy and fairly alcoholic. Very carbonated mouthfeel. Enjoyable but a slow sipper."
"Let me start by saying that this beer has nice carbonation. So much so that I lost a few ounces because it exploded on me. Smell is yeasty, fruity, honey and alcohol. The taste is sweet, yeasty, honey raisins and banana. The mouthfeel is crisp with great carbonation and a dry finish. This beer has a light taste for such a strong beer which makes its drinkability exceptional. This beer is a must try."
"[mouth] Flavor is medium and gentile, fresh and fruity, spicy, sweet. Aftertaste is malty and yeast in deep. Body is medium-full and palate is very creamy. gooood beeer!"
"Pours a hazy light golden orange in color with about a finger of rocky white head that doesn't quite have the retention one would expect. Aroma is fairly soft, light fruits (apple, pear, a touch on banana) and a light spicynesss. Taste is much like the aroma. At first there is a very soft malt character but that is replaced by fruity esters, in this case apples, pears, and some oranges. The esters slowly segue into spicy/peppery phenols. The finish is relatively dry with only a light alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is good with medium-light body and high-ish carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer, fairly well balanced in terms of flavor but sometimes the flavors seem a bit too separate. I'd score this a bit higher if the flavors came together a bit better, a longer conditioning might do the trick."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Belgian strong ale."
"Clean taste at the start with a peppery spicyness and lots of flavor from the Belgian yeast. Has a tangy slightly soury sharp clean tart finish. The alcohol at 9% is very subdued.A refeshing beer that goes down easily,almost sessionable."
"A great strong Belgian-style ale. Really big fan of the Unibroue stuff lately. I'm glad the local market sells these things so I can have them every once in awhile."
"This is another fine brew form a GREAT Canadian brewer!"
"D - Medium/Low with the high ABV and sweet bite."
"re-taste 4/18/11: All that I said before holds but now I find this lighter and more refreshing and outstandingly drinkable. Did the beer change or di I change? Or is this bottle just younger? I have altered my scores to match how much I am enjoying this bottle tonight."
"Overall, an interesting Belgian. I like some aspects but not others."
"It's one I'd certainly buy again - one of Unibroue's best."
"D - 9% ABV? A nice ale in warm weather as it's certainly refreshing. Perhaps this was a bit too cold but I'm still searching for adjectives to describe this unusual offering."
"Another excellent brew from Unibroue. High ABV make for only a couple in a setting but well worth stretching the limits."
"Not bad but falls short of the last Unibroue I tried (Trois Pistoles). Pours a hazy orange color topped with a thick white head. The aroma is nice, that of a strong orange juice. Fruity, floral, yeasty and a bit sour and tangy tasting. High alcohol content, and they do a decent job hiding it. It's a good beer but not a great one."
"Unibroue did a great job on this beer. I will be drinking this one again."
"mouthfeel is pleasant with big champagne-like carbonation and a smooth sweet finish."
"Cloudy golden color. Huge, foamy off-white head that settles into a stubborn cap, so much so that it barely laces. Malt and dry yeast aromas. Flavors of sweet fruits like pears and subtle hints of apricots. Like a barley wine but not so biting. In fact it's very drinkable for the alcohol percentage (9%!) and you can barely taste it until it warms up a bit. Medium body and filling without being heavy. Impresseive. The best Unibroue beer I know of for the uninitiated. It would be easy to get a couple into your friends or girlfriend ;-)"
"Certainly a drinkable beer; one I'd purchase again. Not quite a session beer."
"i think i just got a bad bottle, that said, not very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Good not any better. Not as good as La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, or Trois Pistoles."
"The drink is crisp with an aggressive palate wash of zippy carbonation. Light and refreshing with superb drinkability."
"D: Deceivingly easy, especially given the ABV. It will surely catch up quickly, but it's certainly worth it in this case. Quite a nice brew."
"Any beer from Unibroue is a drinkable beer. I wish I would have had this one sooner."
"Light taste and feel for strong beer makes this great."
"This is a tasty, solid brew. I would be quite happy if I had a glass of this in front of me on any given night."
"D: Makes you a bit burpy and the appearance leaves something to be desired but I couldn't stop myself from drinking this one. Very complex without being overwhelming and muted. Something about this beer with stand out to whoever drinks it and what that is may change from person to person. Good exapmle of for the style and another well crafted beer from the folks at Unibroue."
"Pretty good beer at all. Maybe a bit too much sweetness for my taste. Another solid one from Unibroue."
"D: Tasty and decently drinkable even with abundant alcohol present. A dangerous brew."
"D - Amazing. I could sit and drink this beer all day. Absolutely loved it. Goes down easy, nice and sweet. I was grateful to only have one to try. I could easily sit and drink this beer all day and with 9%, it would be a good day!"
"Pretty good beer...Unibroue doesn't disappoint."
"Drinkability: Where's the alcohol!?! Only sign it's there is the number on the bottle. A superbly crafted brew that doesn't really excel in any one department - it's just solid throughout. Highly recommended."
"D - While pretty good I wasn't totally blown away and have other favorites in this style that I'd prefer to reach for"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz pint glass. Firm pour yielded 3 fingers of pure white head. Head diminishes quickly, leaving no lacing to speak of. Color is hazy golden with a half finger of of the aforementioned pure white head. Nose is all yeast, light malt and alcohol. On the palate, very crisp and creamy. Notes of sour apple and fruit. Very fine creamy carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden despite the nose. Slightly sour in the finish. Very nice beer, recommended."
"Very drinkable, high quality BSPA. Getchu some!"
"D- Easy to drink, and refreshing."
"I didn't like this as much as Maudite or Fin, but I would certainly drink it again. Does Unibroue make a bad beer?"
"D: I could die on a Don De Dieu pool, I simply loved this beer."
"D - I really love this beer and find it to be drinkable, but as far as overall - at 9% it is just good. I would not hestitate to pick this up anytime, it is fantastic. I would probably limit to 2 since the abv will creep up on you and you might not realize the 9% it contains at first taste."
"Quite tasty and glad to see a North American brewery really take on a Belgian style and succeed. I have yet to have a Unibroue beer I don't like."
"Not perfectly executed beer. Maybe I just did not get the best batch. Too sweet for my tastes and not easy to consume."
"Mouthfeel was effervescent and mouth-filling. Rich texture. It became smoother as the carbonation faded."
"A great taste and aroma. I like the toffee in the smell, fruits in the taste."
"D: Very easy drinking, not my favorite Unibroue, but alcohol is very well hidden and overall very refreshing and easily drinkable."
"D: I could drink a whole 6 pack. Great stuff!"
"Drinkability: Not bad, not bad. I'm going down Memory Lane with Unibroue, and, so far, I'm leaning towards the maltier offerings, Maudite and Trois Pistoles."
"D - A little too harsh for my liking... Too much going on for my liking... I like complexity, but this is a little too chaotic..."
"Goes down easy, almost wish I had another on hand."
"RJR"
"D- It's amazing how light and drinkable this beer is at 9% alcohol. Very refreshing. Though I find I like other Unibroue beers over this."
"Drinkable but not in my top 5 Unibroue beers for sure."
"A solid offering from north of the border. Would not probably seek out on my own."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Surprisingly (in a good way), this beer is mellow and reserved... the usual bombastic carbonation from Unibroue's lineup is nowhere to be found... perhaps time has tamed this one. For the final glass, I've poured all yeast sediment in... the appearance is of course completely opaque now, and the flavor is far less ""hot""... smooth and slithery, this drops a sack kick to the brain... time for bed."
"Scary drinkable."
"Golden cloudy yellow out of the bottle ... lots of yeast particles come out on the pour. Smells very tart, with hint of wheat, fruity esters and hop flowers. Very smooth tasting a drinking. Taste really reminds me of a good sweet bread with tartness and a small hint of hop bitterness in the end. This is very drinkable but the high alcohol is well-hidden, so use caution."
"Pours a translucent gold with dense white head and lots of lacing. Smell: pear and apple, phenolic, wheaty, floral hops, cracker like malts. Taste: pear, wheaty, yeasty, big time dried apricots at the end of the sip. Alcohol warmth pops up after the sip. Medium bodied with a dry wheaty finish. Good beer with a cool label... natives in canoes greeting Champlain in his gift from god?"
"Such a good beer. The three-finger head in my tulip glass quickly dissipates, leaving no lacing. The color is robust golden. The smell is huge but delicate: floral notes and fresh ripe apricot predominate, with some malty undertones. The taste is rich, sharp, sweet, and bitter, all in the space of a couple of seconds. Apricots again, with maybe some hibiscus tang, rounding out into a malty aftertaste that finishes with a mild hop punch. It feels great in the mouth: perfect viscosity to mask the alcohol burn that grows as you get deeper into the glass. I'd drink this all night, but for the rather heavy alcohol hit. This is my favorite Unibroue beer; too bad it's hardest to find around here."
"d: This might be my favorite from Unibroue. A superb warm weather sipper."
"Quite enjoyable brew, will seek this one out more often!"
"So, Don de Dieu. Remarkable. The closest thing to a Belgian Triple Ale that I've found that's not actually a Belgian. The Quebeçois have managed somehow to retain a bit more old-worldness to their brews than have the USA craft-brewers. Don de Dieu has a slight roasted-nut quality blending in with that great fruit-malt-yeast quality that I love about farmhouse-style brews. This beer would be fantastic with anything grilled (especially game), even more fantastic with spicy Latin or Asian dishes, and remarkable with artisan cheese. It's 9%, so watch yourself."
"This was a very smooth pale for its elevated alcohol content. I enjoyed this one chilled in my Duvel bubbler. Poured a brilliant sunset golden color. Nose had a mixture of floral hops and a hint of apple. Taste of tree fruit with a good balance of floral hop flavor and a dry finish. The alcohol warmth is noticable though."
"D- My first impression was that this could easily be a sessionable beer, due to its light body, great flavor and ability to go down easy. It is deceptive, however; an ABV of 9% makes this a double-edges sword if too many are consumed."
"d: Wow, why don't i drink this more often? A light and refreshing beer with a complex flavor profile. Wine-like. Good stuff."
"drinkablility is good. this is a full flavored belgian style brew with a sizable alcohol tag. overall a great one to enjoy over a half an hour or so. warming it a bit will prove to make this one come alive. cheers!"
"A friend of mine who isn't really a beer connoisseur recommended this beer to me after I turned him on to Belgian Trippels. Being that this friend's idea of a good beer is Corona, I reluctantly purchased a 4-pack on my latest trip to my favorite beer store. It's been sitting in my fridge for the past two weeks, waiting for me to get ""desperate"" enough to drink it. I'm sorry I waited so long. The smell is sweet and enjoyable. I poured it into my favorite Leffe ale glass and boy was I surprised. The taste is sweet and the high alcohol content is barely noticeable. I have another friend who is as big of a fan of Belgium Trippels as I am and I can't wait to share some with him. I would highly recommend this beverage. Well done, especially for a Canadian brewer."
"Delicious. Simply put, this beer is outstanding. Good carbonation, great flavor, a must try for wheat beer enthusiasts."
"I would recommend this beer. I believe I bought this bottle on New Year's Day at Koppa's Food on Farwell Ave in Milwaukee (across from Comet Cafe)."
"Pours a honey maple amber with a big pillowy head. Head quielty recedes to a simple ring. Smell is big fresh pears, green apples, white bread, honey, and some floral fruit (mango / papaya) finish. Taste is apple, a bit of green grape, overly ripe pear, honey wheat and that wonderful unibroue belgian yeast spotted with some spicy alcohol finish that warms the stomach. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and champaignesque. Very nice."
"From the bottle to the Unibroue glass this beer poured a murky gold with a frothy three finger head. It had aromas of citrus, hops, and honey. Grapefruit, citrus, honey, hops, wheat, and orange were all present in the taste. It had a good mouthfeel and it was refreshing, but I had to sip this guy to enjoy it."
"D= This is an outstanding ale and I highly recommend it as a great tasting sipper for after dinner!"
"12 ounce bottle, best before 2/15/2009. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden orange color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. It smells like peppery spice, pineapple, yeast and citrus. Taste is similar to the aroma, it starts off fruity but has a bitter and spicy finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium with above average zippy carbonation. Drinkability is good, even with the higher carbonation the beer goes down smooth and it's not hard to drink at all. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall I think it's a pretty decent beer, I'd pick it up again."
"Drinkability: I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these. Only downside is at 9%, it'd be hard to do anything else afterwards."
"Other comments: I haven't had a Unibroue beer in a long time (since I left the US in 2003). Really liked this brewery then, still do, but this beer was somewhat disappointed in that it didn't blow my socks off."
"Overall- Don de Dieu is a great example of the style. I'd drink it again."
"Not their best beer, but very solid."
"I love Unibroue stuff, for the price it cannot be beaten, and Don De Deiu is no exception."
"This is a really nice, strong Belgian pale ale that was quite refreshing (especially for my friend) after a more ""out there"" beer that kind of put him off a little. I didn't enjoy it much as some of the more widely available Unibroues (Trois Pistoles, Maudite, and Fin du Monde) but it was extremely drinkable for the ABV, quite refreshing, quite highly carbonated, and dominated by the classic Unibroue yeast, light fruity notes, some sugary malts, and a bit of a spicy hop backbone. Wish this were available regularly in Ontario!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a big, fine white head that settles to a thin cap and leaves some splotchy lacing. Slightly light in the nose, but with aromas of orange juice, banana, and maybe a hint of clove. Juicy and bright. Taste is somewhat similar in that it is also quite juicy, a bit sweet and tangy, and echoes the aromas of the orange and banana. Perhaps pineapple as well. A touch of light spice, mostly clove and coriander as well. Thinner in mouthfeel than some other quality Belgian Strong Pales. The body is not quite mouthcoating like some, but it also lacks that crisp zing that soem have that cut through that. This one comes off very slightly sticky. Still, quite tasty and one of the better Unibroues in my opinion. Not at all unhappy about having bought a four pack."
"High, dense head that dissipates quickly leaving very minute traces of lacing. Opaque amber body, yet very little yeast residue despite being bottle conditioned. Citrus and floral on the nose, strong citrus punch on the tongue. ABV (9%) well-concealed in this one, very pleasant--easy to overdo! This is one of my favorites, a leader of the pack, which I cannot recommend highly enough."
"Poured into chalice with very lively carbonation, gorgeous foamy two-finger head, moderate retention. Lively,fruity, brut champange-like on the nose. Tart citrus notes, yeasts,apples, ethers, slight alcohol on the nose. Taste is very appley(if thats a word)fruity, delicious. Damn good!. Medium mouthfeel, not too sweet, not alot of candi sugars to be found here. Seriously if you want a nice tart glass of champagne to begin your evening, consider this instead. The nose is slightly watery, but excellent flavor, mouthfeel, and drinkability make this a highly recommended BSPA."
"Overall, not very complicated and this isn't a bad thing at all, because what it does, it does very well. Dangerous too, I could easily kill a 4-pack and probably regret it in the morning. Excellent."
"Pours an attractive golden colour with a medium bubbly white head. The nose is heavy on cider and flowers, like a romp in a meadow with a west country lass. Really nice, almost cidery taste, with a few berries thrown in to bulk up a crisp malty body. Good carbonation to compliment a medium body. This goes down very easily, and considering the ABV that's quite a surprise. Another good Unibroue."
"It shall definitely be one I try again."
"Unibroue never seems to disappoint , and this beers a gem."
"appearance and head retention are real low points here. i'm pretty sure glassware wasn't the problem, as i've had more than one bottle, and the glass (an oversized wine tulip) has managed to get great head and lacing from other beers."
"This is an intensely drinkable beer. Not my favorite of Unibroue's (that's still La Fin du Monde), but it's an exceptional beer."
"Another damn fine ale from Unibroue. The yeaast they use is unmistakeble and gives off strong flavors that some people dont particulary care for(but I love). It remains similar to the rest of thier lineup but it does have its own uniqueness; the lemon character was great."
"D,notes: An assertively hoppy Belgian pale ale. Probably could use some more malt balance. Something is off in both the smell and the taste - a vegetable character - maybe the Unibroue yeast is the culprit here. I know of many people on the BA site who are not particularly enamored with their yeast strain."
"Deliciously complex yet well balanced and very enjoyable. Perfect example of the style."
"Hot damn! This really is the gift of god. While it may not enjoy the status as La Fin du Monde or Maudite, it's right up there in terms of quality. Don de Dieu scores extremely well here, and one score that's going to be mighty tough to beat. ...phémère will have its work cut out later tongiht."
" Well done, leaves the palate clean waiting for more."
"As with Trois Pistoles, Don de Dieu is eminently drinkable with the high ABV (9%) so well masked. Just outstanding, as Unibroue has quickly moved to the top of my list of favorite Canadian brewers."
"Another absolute winner from Unibroue... Every beer that I've sampled from this company has been absolute world-class, and this Belgian Strong Pale Ale fails to disappoint... living up to its reputation as an all-around outstanding brew... pours a very hazy, cloudy, off-color yellow color with decent head that soon dissipated... great smell full of sweet fruits, esters and citrus... excellent taste, sweet, rich, creamy, thick and satisfying flavor with strong, sweet aftertones coupled with an ultra vanilla, fruity palate... mouthfeel was thick, rich, and crisp, with an excellent drinkabiltiy covering a 9% ABV that is difficult to notice behind a cornucopia of amazing flavors that is above and beyond your normal, average brew... Unibroue is starting to become my favorite brewery because of all their terrific, world-class brews... Definitely recommended... One of the better depictions of the style out there... Those folks in Cananda really know their beer..."
"after blowing a power steering hose, i sampled the first of my 4-pack stranded in the grocery store parking lot drinking out of a plastic cup ; pours a slightly hazy light golden-yellow color w/ a much smaller than expected head which did stick around for a bit leaving a nice lacing in my snifter ; a typical belgian nose, grainy w/ a spicy pear-like smell, some citrus hop, coriander and a bit of alcohol underneath ; a crisp, dry malty flavor w/ a tart banana taste initially followed by a wheaty flavor about midway, finishes dry w/ a pleasant warm bread-like(sourdough?) aftertaste, maybe a minimal hop presence as well ; a very dry, med (maybe a tad lighter) bodied beer, not as carbonated as most ; a very good beer i definitely will be drinking this again..."
"Highly carbonated, and mostly light in body. Very drinkable beer, that became easier to consume as it warmed up nicely in my hands"
"It is incredibly light, slightly watery with low carbonation. It is incredibly easy to drink, and at 9%, this big boy is going to hit me sooner then later. Amazing beer, and once again, Unibroue have shown why they are one of the best in the world."
"Overall- It is nice and refreshing like Unibroue is good for to me. It is consistant and true to its style. Very nice!"
"Pours a hazy straw/amber with a white head. Nose is like a bright lemon. Has the potential to be overbearing, but does not (my definition of a bright lemon). Flavor is strong and light at the same time. Pungent sweetness combined with a heavy yeast flavor. Overall it is very smooth and even, yet powerful. Feel is slightly thin with a good carbonation on it. Extremely drinkable. Perhaps a bit on the sweet side, and too much so for some. But still. Extremely well crafted."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking brew. Another excellent member of the Unibroue family."
"Thanks again, John!"
"Pours a very light orange with a big two-finger white, bubbly head that fades quickly into a 1-2cm fluffy topping for a while before settling down with no lacing left behind. Swirl it around a bit in the tulip and a sweet, mildly tart and bready aroma arises. Tastes of bananas and pineapples up front with some bready maltiness, coriander and spice in the back and subtle alcohol heat to bring up the rear. Reflecting, after a few drinks, there's some delicate hops that go almost unnoticed, but serve to furtively embolden this beer. This medium bodied, fullfilling and smooth beer is my new favorite among one of my favorite styles."
"A little more than moderately carbonated with a light-to-medium body. Each sip is incredibly crisp. This is one of the more refreshing and accessible Unibroue offerings I've had. This definitely isn't my favorite, but that's only due to style preference. I'd recommend this to people looking for something more than the beer your grandpa has in his fridge. Great taste and easily drinkable. Way to go guys..."
"This was a very enjoyable beer which hid the alcohol content very well, making it quite easy to drink in large quantities. I'll definitely be back for more of this one. Another great brew from Unibroue."
"ahhh another belgian strong ale, one of my new favorite styles, really been emjoying these recently. has a pretty cloudy golden color with a mild head, lots of carbonation. the smell is awesome, banana, citrus, yeast, just fantastical amazingness. the taste is just as great. first the mouthfeel is like a bubbly champaign like beer. has a slight alcohol tingliness at first but is followed by a cider like taste. easy drinking and smooth. another great belgian style ale"
"D: Overall fairly drinkable. Cloys a bit, but overall quite nice."
"D: Good. A little too sweet for my preferences, but not in a cloying way."
"This is a classy brew. Unibroue has a unique taste to its beers and this certainly contains. It pours mostly tranparent golden. It is quite strong and has a hint of belgian trippel to it. The pale hops are still apparent but the malty tastes make their presence known to. Good finish and smooth aftertaste. Perhaps a bit highly carbonated which takes away from the drinkability, but overall one of unibroue's better ales."
"Bright golden liquid with a one finger head in my wide mouth goblet. The smell seemed to contain mellow but pronounced, fruity but not citrusy, esters followed by an underlying malt aroma. The taste is defined by the fruit esters: grape, pear, plum, etc. The fruit esters are beautifully balanced by the spicy phenols of Belgian yeasts and the absence of a stronger malt sweetness (I dare not call it tart). A soft carbonation gives way to a crisp and clean, light to medium body that disguises the alcoholic content in a spectacular way. This smooth golden nectar cascades down the delicious decent to your throat unhindered by the typical grimace of high alcohol beers. What adjuncts do they use to make this beer? Honey? Candied sugar? Both? Whatever they use the ratio seemed damn near perfect to me. Awesome beer."
"D - It is alright but not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Love it. Another great Unibroue brew. IMHO similar to La Fin Du Monde with less sweetness and more of a tart peppery aftertaste. Amazingly drinkable for the alcohol content as most of the brews from this brand are."
"D: A fine beer that I would have a few of but the sourness would probably need either some food with it or I would have to switch over to something else. The alcohol though not overly powerful in the taste does warm the face a bit."
"Appearance is a slightly hazy, pale orange. It starts with a very large white head that settles a bit but lasts throughout. The smell is sweet and fruity, mostly oranges and apricots. The taste is a complex mix of several flavors. It's sweet and tart with orange, malt, yeast and alcohol. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Drinkability is quite good for such a high ABV. Overall, this is an enjoyable beer that must be consumed in moderation."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, medium bodied, syrupy, doughy, tropical...maybe a little too sweet."
"Flavor is of sour fruit and heavy spices. Very smooth, yet with a sharp spicy kick. Apricot, wheat, pepper, even some light hops. Alcohol is virtually unnoticeable for a 9% ABV beer."
"Poured kind of orange but couldn't really see cuz i drank it from an opaque mug. not that the color matters much. pretty hefty head, didn't take too long to settle down. Smells very zesty. Impressions of orange peels, maybe slight lemon but with only small fraction of the bitterness. Taste reminded me a little of chardonnay, and also a lot of southampton double white, but thankfully with less sour bitterness and more akin to a strong pale belgian. i can't say ive had very many of those but this is definitely a unique interpretation of the style not lacking in complexity. It was so drinkable I found myself drinking it a bit to quickly despite the alcohol level. alcohol was a bit more prevalent as it warmed up but the taste also blossomed making it more delicious. Not really sure where hops come into play in all this because there's so many other spicy things going on but I couldn't imagine it any other way. I could easily see how people might find this beer a bit too outrageous, however I found it quite agreeable."
"Wishing I would have bought a couple of more as the store that carries this is across the city..but the pilgrimage will be worth it."
"Notes - Triple wheat ales aren't something you see very often, so I was pretty curious about this. It definitely lived up to my expectations; it's both unique and very drinkable."
"Drinkablity was good and I plan on getting another bottle of this from a different store tomorrow to see if it was just the bottle that tasted salty or if thats how this tastes. I drank this with a fish dinner and to anyone else, this is a strong recommendation to drink this with something else."
"belle couleur vieille-or, la mousse est blanche mais elle n'est pas persistante, beau nez frais et épicée, la bouche est piquante, épicée, longue, aucune lourdeur pour une bière à 9 degrée. j'aime cette bière."
"D - Pretty good, I moved on after one, but that's just because it's the Bier Garden. I could have easily stuck it out with this one. Excellent brew, Unibroue has yet to present me with a bad beer. Recommended."
"Pours a light straw color, rather light for a pale ale. No head or lacing to speak of at all. Almost no scent, either, as well as taste. A slight bitterness aftertaste, but nothing to really go with it. Goes down fine, especially for such a high ABV beer, but that's about it."
"Even given the high alcohol content, this is a very friendly offering from Unibroue. Great beer!"
"750ml corked bottle from Bevmo. Cork launched with enough force to dent my 14 foot high ceiling. Pours a hazy cloudy gold color with a huge head that receded to 1/4 inch and held. Aroma is moderate in strength and loaded with spice. Flavor is all Belgian; complex with cloves, allspice, coriander, citrus, thyme and hazelnuts. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying with lively prickly carbonation. Hops are well integrated. Finish is long and sticky-sweet. Overall an excellent beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a one finger short lived fizzy whitish head. Smells very sweet with hints of citrusy fruits in the background. Pleasant yeasty aromas also noted. Tastes a little tangy and sweet, lemony tartness... no, maybe pears. Definite summer fruit taste. Almost like a fruit beer, but its not. Earthy flavors in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would prefer, a little mouth coating, but the carbonation could be longer lasting, instead of a short lived fizz. As the beer warms, the tartness mellows and allows the real fruit flavors to pull through. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. And for $6 a bottle, its a definite buy every time I see it available."
"Very quaffable, tasty, and refreshing. Nice beer, and it seems a lot lighter than it actually is (9%). Lots of apples..."
"Magnificent."
"Opened with a strong scent of apples and yeast. Poured into a snifter with a beautiful hazy, honey-gold color. Nice foamy head with subtle carbonation. Lacing remained on the side of the glass throughout the tasting. Surprisingly light and smooth mouthfeel with a mild, tart taste. Nice finish with a hint of citrus (grapefruit?). Very pleasant and versatile brew."
"D - A fine beer, just not by favorite style or presentation. A little too sweet and carbonated for me."
"single bottle from WF Raleigh"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a decent white head that dissipated into a nice cap. Not a typical explosive Belgian head. The smell is of light corriander and orange peel, definitely not as strong as The End of the World. The taste is light yet flavorful. The corriander and orange peel makes its way to the taste, again not very strong. Some Belgian candi sugar, but not too sweet, quite mellow. It has a light fruity taste, maybe some lemon and some tart apple to balance. The feel is moderate and a bit fizzy, finishes fairly balanced. A fairly light tasting Belgian style brew that is quite refreshing. The 9% ABV is not close to being detected."
"This is a quality offering from a first rate brewhouse that does not get nearly the recognition it deserves. The beer pours an orangish, cloudy color with a white fizzy head that does hang around for awhile. The smell is Belgian -- sweet malts, candied sugars, spices, lemon, citrus. The smell is good but not brilliant in that it does impart some sourness and other unnatural aromas. The taste is quite good. The carbonation is spot on, the alcohol is warming but very well masked, and the taste is the yeasty fizz, candied sugars, sweets, spices, fruits one would expect from a Belgian pale. You also don't get that strong peppery finish that Belgian imitators seemed to get trapped in. This is an enjoyable beer but it is suprisingly lighter bodied than I would have expected and this does compromise the quality to an extent. The aftertaste is slightly warming alcohol but very mild for a beer of this ABV. You can't go wrong here. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability? Well, if you had told me this was a 4.5% brew, I would have said it has a surprisingly rich taste for a light beer. Truly, the alcohol is utterly absent from the taste. I wish I had some more. Sessionable? Don't think so. Drinkable? Very much so."
"D - This stuff is outstanding. Unibroue is quickly becoming my favorite brewer, and this is one of it's better beers. It doesn't quite stand up to the shinning example set forth by it's ""apocalyptic"" sibling, but it is much different than that outstanding brew and some may like it better. This one deserves world-class status for it's phenomenal mouthfeel alone."
"Not my cup of tea,will not buy this one again...to me...this isn't beer...more like a fruit punch."
"12oz bottle from La Trappe A Fromage in Gatineau. Pours a cloudy light beige with mounds of head. Yeasty aroma, but not as strong as some other Unibroue beers. Flavour also feels a bit restrained as compared to some of the other Unibroue upfront wallops. The spiciness is what is most noticeable about this brew, but the typical yeasty Unibroue flavours are not evident in their typical strengths. That can be OK, as some of the Unibroue beers taste somewhat similar, yet awesome, to me. This is an enjoyable beer, but I don't think it offers anything better than Maudite or Trois Pistoles."
"Highly refreshing and drinkable. Enjoyable from cool to warm and very well done. It seems I enjoy about half of Unibroue's beers."
"Greg I owe you one for introducing me to this!"
"One of my first foreign beer reviews, and I must say I am a bit disappointed. 12 oz. sealed bottle with a nice head and strong aromas. Smells mainly of maybe nutmeg spices and citrus, but pretty strong on those spices. Taste is a warming alcohol and strong malts with spices. A bit too much for me, but I see how some might enjoy it. My tasting party seemed to love the brew, but it was just way too spicy and strong for me. Overall, not even a hardcore fan of this brew would dare try too many of these in a sitting, and for me: I wouldn't pick this up over too many other domestics I've tried, but that might put me in the vast minority."
"Caveat: I generally like to pour the yeast sediment directly into the glass to add to the flavor of most beers. DdD is the exception, I would recommend decanting this, as the yeast seems to ""muddy-up"" the spicyness of the beer. Either way, however, you are in for a treat."
"Poured from 750mL bottle with some great art on the label. Pours a nice copper-orange color with good finger or two head. Slightly hazy but not too much so. Definite fruit in the nose, mainly of green apple, sour green apple, and slight smell of alcohol as well. Taste is good. Nothing stand our dramatically, it is a sweet taste with a strong fruit presence. Good amount of carbonation leaves a slightly dry aftertaste. Very light mouthfeel makes this very drinkable however the high alcohol content contradicts that. Overall a very good beer, not my favorite from Unibroue but a great choice."
"Poured nicely from a bomber into a glass and left a frothy head that sizzled away slowly. The color was yellow-orange and the smell was a lemon banana scent very champagne like look to this ale. The taste was great as usual another great one from Unibroue not to harsh just right. The alc/vol is a 9 so I couldnt put alot of these away all night but if you can be my guest."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The body of this brew is medium-light bodied with higher levels of carbonation and an almost wine like alcohol perception. Finishes slightly dry on the tongue. This is a brew I'll definitely drink again, though I think that for the style I'd have to say that Duvel or La Fin Du Monde is a better represention, however, this beer is on target. If you're looking for something a bit more unique then here it is. Overall a great brew, I'm sure I'll be back to this one at some point, however there are just too many more to try."
"This one pours a beautiful orange gold with a sticky white head comprised of minuscule bubbles with the odd yeast chunk or two floating around. The smell here is ripe summer fruit some light biscuit malt and a touch of spice, yeast and alcohol. The taste is pretty amazing sharp citrus and apricot balanced with steady peppery spice and a very light smooth hoppiness. Underlying honey, toffee and biscuits fill in the malt side of things while the yeast provides a clove/banana backing to round the whole thing out. Mouthfeel is also very good this medium to light bodied, highly carbonated beer dances around the mouth leaving a drying sensation with a lingering peppery bite that is very satisfying. The 9% abv remains expertly hidden in here making this a dangerously drinkable beer one that it will be hard to grow tired of."
"The beer pours a hazy amber with two fingers of beige head which collapses to nothing. The aroma is very yeasty with apricot-like citrus flavors and a hint of grassyness. The flavor follows the nose and includes a good balance of alcohol heat. Mouthfeel had a nice prickly carbonation. The lightness works well with the delicate flavor, although it may accentuate the alcohol. A very geed beer."
"Poured into a chalice pours a mango color with a fluffy head that does not hang around long but does have a ring that stays the entire drink. Smell is pears, a bit of earth and also a bit of straw and hay with hints of alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is a bit tart at first with a hint of banana finish also some clove and just a tad bit of pepper, lots of carbonation. This was a fine offering and for it being 9% alcohol this went down really smooth and enjoyable, another fine crafted brew from Unibroue."
"This is a masterpeice of a beer- my first offering from unibroue and it will not be my last."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Like I said before, a fantastic alternative to Duvel. Actually there's quite a lot in common, even price (at least where I am...) this is very simialr pricewise to Duvel, but just a hair lower in quality... though I really shouldn't be comparing. Just try it. You won't regret it..."
"Overall, another great Unibroue. Big flavors with a surprising amount of refreshment. Recommended."
"Very drinkable for a big beer like most of the better examples of this style. Deceptively strong but seems very quaffable. Lacking the spiciness of the best examples but still a very nice beer."
"I would recommend this to anyone interested in the style."
"Pours a very hazy light orange, dark straw color. A quarter inch head soon dissipates to a thin covering. Estery Unibroue yeasty aromas abound! Lots of bubblegum, caramel, vague orange and citrus notes. Candy sugar also present. On the palate, tiny bubbles hit the tongue with more candy sweet esters, complex malt aroma with lots of wheat like flavors coming through. Not much in the way of hops whose bitterness is either nowhere to be found or just barely enough to mask the malty sweetness. Alcohol is quite present in the flavor but great as a flavor vector. This is a pretty typical offering from Unibroue, tons of house yeast flavors and aromas and standard malt profile. However, it is all good IMO."
"Pours out a hazy brass with an initial thick head that quickly recedes to a thin layer of tiny bubbles. Minute lacing. Smells wheaty with a big presence of the Unibroue house yeast. Tons of clove and apricot with a hint of vitamin. Starts off with some bready pale malts and some cracker-like wheat flavors, but the house yeast dominates. Again, lots of clove and stone fruits: apricots, nectarines, and peaches. Hops come out a little and offer some herb to the finish. Mouthfeel is lively but I could like this a bit lighter and less sugary. Still sits well in the mouth. Really delicious and seems to showcase the yeast more than, say La Fin du Monde, which tends to lean a lot more to a grainy character. Great."
"Simple, yet elegant. I'd like to do a side-by-side tasting with La Fin Du Monde (my fav Unibroue)... I think it would be close."
"Into a chalice, pours a bright shiny orange, with little head to begin with and nothing left quite too soon, with no lacing. The aroma is kind of like it looks, bright fruits, decent but a little awkward or something. The taste is pretty good, lots of it, very sweet, incredibly fruity, citrus, a little bit too much, bunches of spices, the body medium with lots of good carbonation, drying. In all, its a goofy one that I've had a few times now, rubs me different ways each time I have it. This is kind of the average of those experiences."
"Excellent beer from Unibroue...."
"* (from either the French chair cuite, cooked meat, or the French cuiseur de chair, cooker of meat) is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products such as sausage and confit primarily from pork. The practice goes back to ancient times and can involve the chemical preservation of meats; it is also a means of using up various meat scraps. Hams, whether smoked, air-cured, salted, or treated by chemical means, are examples of charcuterie."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very smooth, light bodied, and alcohol is masked extremely well. It's very drinkable. Clearly not a session, but it's so easy to drink. Overall, very nice offering from Unibroue."
"D. A dangerous beer! So good yet the abv is well hidden. Would be easy to over imbibe, but definitely a winner!"
"Highly enjoyable slow drinker with a fiery spunk and chewy sweetness."
"A fine ale, but not one for a session, unless you want to get really hammered."
"Though I find it to be similar to many other Belgian-style brews I've tried, this one is surprisingly drinkable, especially with its 9 percent hanging around. This brewery's website calls this a ""triple wheat ale"" and I can believe it with this beer's drinkablity. It has a peppery aftertaste in it that reminds me of some of the better hefe weizens like Weihenstephan. It's not quite that drinkable (and definitely not as refreshing), but this one damn good beer. I could sip on this one forever."
"Overall impression: A light, fruity, refreshing Belgian ale. This would go well with a summer cookout or be complex enough to complement any chicken or fish entree. Strongly recommended."
"This beer pours a clear, pale color. Aroma is somewhat fruity, reminiscent of apple. The taste is pretty similar, except that it's somewhat sour and a bit bland. Can taste the malt though. I think the problem is that this beer reminds me too much of Ephemere and it should not be that way. Then again, it's still a solid beer but I can't differentiate it enough from Ephemere."
"D- For the style, there are better beers out there. Still, at $5 a bottle, this is excellent."
"This is a good sipping beer. Definitely worth a try."
"This one is a silent killer."
"D: This is a great, flavorful, excellent ale. Wish carbonation was lighter, but really great flavor and at 9%, you will forget what you're drinking too quick!"
"750ml corked & caged bottle. Pours a clear golden hue with a thin, rocky head that dissipates quickly. Smells of bubblegum, peaches, apricots and a hint of malt. Taste is bubblebum and ripe fruits. Nice balance of sweet & tart. Doesn't have the soapiness I've come to associate with the style, almost more like a triple. The mouthfeel is silky & nicely carbonated. The drinkability is wonderful. I could sip on this all night. And now I'm going to do exactly that."
"D- you can't even detect the high ABV of this one. I reccomend it to any fan of belgians. It has the keynotes of a good belgian. I will definately have this one again. great example from unibroue. My favorite so far."
"This was good. A nicely crisp, dry, spicy ale. Its not the best of the style I've had, but it was certainly good. Could easily hold up to a spicy, fleshy fish, chicken or even pork dish. A nice example of the the genre...check it out."
"I was expecting good things from this beer. Poured nicely from a 750ml into a goblet, with a nice, lingering head. The aroma was nearly non-existent, which was a little disappointing. Nice carbonation and had nice body to it. I detected a bit of a sour, almost metallic aftertaste which, frankly, turned me off a bit. Overall, it was good, but not as good as I was expecting. I could see it paired with perhaps a spicy dish, with the brew's sweetness a nice complement to the spice."
"good brew worth a try"
"D: Not bad, slightly cloying and pretty spicy. Not one of the better Unibroue's."
"Drinkability is huge."
"cheers!"
"D - Very good beer. I love the spicy/malt taste."
"I enjoy this less than the other Unibroue strong belgian ales, which only means I rate it Very Good instead of Great. Sure, I'll have another."
"An underwhelming example of the style. Easy to finish the bottle, but not something I'll be buying again."
"D: Very drinkable. At 9%, it could really sneak up on you."
"This beer seems to be a wonderful cross between a wit and a saison. Amy I crazy? If so, its still terrific."
"Don De Dieu comes out of the bottle with a very strong sweet citrus fragrance that is very pleasing to the senses and its hazy golden color matches its aroma perfectly. It has a very thin white head that quickly disappears into almost nothing and has some very mild lacing and carbonation. It has a strong fresh and crisp taste when it hits your tongue and is accompanied by a semi-sweet aftertaste that seems resemble bananas mixed in with a hint of alcohol, this is a very good tasting ale wont let you down."
"Medium bodied and extremely effervescent. Light enough to be very drinkable, yet also quite complex and interesting."
"I found this Belgian Strong Pale Ale very easy to drink. The only thing that slows you down is the sharp bite from the carbonation. Recommended."
"This is definitely an excellent sipping brew. More than one at a time I think would be a bit too much for the taste buds. I like my palate to be nice and clean to pick up all of it's fine subtleties. Not the best of the style in my opinion, but is is definitely a great brew that I would gladly try again if it was around."
"Drinkability: It's a nice beer, granted, but it's pretty ordinary and not one of Unibroue's best. Good if it's what you have in front of you, but I'd definitely go with Fin du Monde if I had a choice."
"Slàinte!"
"D- A good Belgian beer for when the mood strikes. Not overwhelming, but not a lot of wow factor here either. A quality beer from a quality brewery."
"Very easy to drink. Great example of the style."
"Golden hued with thin white head. Champagne bubbles steadily rising. Sweet aroma, pineapple and orange juice, ambrosia salad, little sign of alchohol. This beer tastes very good. Well-balanced profile, interesting sweetness with spicy citrus notes. Intriguing flavor, a pleasure to both taste and waft into the nose."
"Unibroue does it again. An excellent Belgian strong pale ale that competes nicely with some of their other beers. Crisp, refreshing, soft, and elegant. Recommended to both those who enjoy, and those interested in, this style of beer. I will get this again for sure."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable."
"mouthfeel was good and so is the drinkability. Im not a huge fan of belgians but not bad."
"Very nice."
"Overall the flavors were very rich, but the beer was dry enough to be very drinkable and refreshing. This is an excellent beer. Not quite as dry and spicy as its cousin, La Fin Du Monde."
"I'll definitely finish this 750ml bottle, and make sure to pick up more the next time I'm at the store. I love this beer and can't wait to drink it again."
"Notably malt strong when compared to other brews Ive tried from Unibroue. However, there is the wheaty and doughy aroma that is very common in these brews. Very cloudy and produces a good head that dissipates quickly into fine lacing. Tastes very unique and is a bit complex. I find hints of doughy bread, but also a Juicy Fruit type of flavor. Feels kind of syrupy and finishes warm."
"Apple juice on the noste- appearance is of apple juice color. Carbonation is more subdued than other Unibroue offerings like La Fin du Monde. Taste- apple, spicy with the classic unibroue yeast flavour. A solid offering from Unibroue, just not quite up there with there flag ships like La Fin Du Monde."
"D-It is my favorite Unibroue (that I have tried). It is what I could see a aged wheat wine taste like. Just a tad bit weaker."
"Drinkability is so good I wish I had more than this one sample."
"Another great Unibroue offering."
"Don De Dieu. Don De Dieu. Just love saying the name. Anyway, this is a pleasurable ale, balanced quite nicely and to be enjoyed at any occassion or just while watching your UCONN Huskies at home. Hold it up to the light and see the golden hue. Like pineapple juice. No, like the gold found in the colors of the St. Louis Rams. Ok, I digress. It's a lovely colored golden yellow. Cloudy from the abundant yeast, but pleasant to the view. This is also a beer bursting with aroma. Very easy to note citrus flavors ranging from clementines and tangerines to apricots and sweet raisons and then to lemons. Yeasty too, giving it a slightly bisquity mouthfeel and clouding the clarity. Bottom line; it works. Bubbly and noisy head, like the ""snaps"" fireworks from when you were a kid and then, just as quickly, it disappears in my tulip glass. No lace whatsoever. Light mouthfeel, particularly at the start and then the explosion of fruit and then just as quickly, gone. This is one to revisit during the spring (moreso than when it's 7 degrees outside like now in Connecticut) or summer. Buy it and embrace it's flavor."
"D - I would probably prefer this beer over La Fin du Monde just because the alcohol presence isn't as prevalent. Both are very good though, very well crafted."
"An exceptional beer, just by pouring it you can see the yeast setiment left in the bottle. This is a beer that has been looked after and cared for. Very complex yest aroma's, almost overpowering. But as it warmed, it became a little dryer, not as fruity, but still retained a flowerly, almost sugary/honey flavor. Very warming for a light beer, one that is recommended without reservation."
"a kick like a trippel, and they certainly succeeded."
"My second Unibroue beer, this one pours a coppery orange color with far less head than I was expecting. Every other BSPA I've had showed huge frothy white heads, but oh well. Smells citrusy, lightly hopped and very crisp. Taste more of the same, got some lemon rind and some orange flavors. It is a good beer, but still can't beat that La Fin Du Monde, which is my standard for Belgians."
"D- Very good strong beer. Overall balance make this one to go back to."
"Don pours a light golden color with a small rocky head that slowly slips away to something closer to a quarter of an inch. The aroma is that of apple, lemon and other fruit with hints of alcohol hidden behind the esters. The flavor is dry and cidery with hints of apple (duh) and subtle spice. Mouthfeel is smooth with just a tiny bit of alcohol bite. For a 9% abv beer, this is quite drinkable, though one is probably enough for me."
"D--This is my second."
"Not bad, but not great, expecially considering who makes it. You cold probably keep drinking this but I don't know why you'd want to."
"Pours hazy golden color with a massive bright white head, however it does not stick around and leaves not even a hint of lacing. Smells of citrus, lots of sweet mellow malts, raisins, and various other spices I can't seem to pinpoint. An overly sweet bubblegum flavor and honestly it's just too overbearing for me to really pick outany other flavors. Maybe I just got a bad bottle but it seems really flat and really overall just lacking in every department. I will say that it hides the alcohol quite well, but this (so far) is in my opinion Unibroue's worst and I really do typically like their stuff. I'll skip this one and pick up Maudite or Trois Pistoles ."
"Drinkability is quite good but the much of the Unibroue line-up is far more appealing."
"If you like Belgian triples, you will almost certainly like this beer too."
"Overall, a light feeling strong ale, that reminds me of a moldy gym sock."
"While it won't knock your socks off with an incredible array of flavors, it's not lacking, either. It's slightly fruity, citrusy, and only a bit tart. Very smooth. Lovely aroma and, of course, a great head. Very drinkable. Hard to tire of, from my perspective."
"Smells sweet, hints of honey, maybe banana? Hops also present to a small extent. Murky yellow body with thick, but quickly-dissipating head. Sweet with a bit of bitterness to it. Alcohol not as present as in some Unibroues or belgians in general. Very carbonated. Melon/banana/honey flavor dominates with hints of hop on the aftertaste. Not bad, but I definitely would reccomend the Maudite or Fin Du Monde before this one."
"This beer poured a nice apricot color with a decent head and nice lacing. It has a fruity smell that is sweet and inviting. The taste has a hint of honey. It is very floral and spicy. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. This beer does a great job of hiding its high alcohol content  barely noticeable. This is a delicious beer that Id consider very drinkable and worthy of pairing with food for a magnificent feast."
"out of the unibroue line-up, which i usually love, this was a bit of a dissapointment. maybe it was the fact that I had this during the winter while this was a summer brew, but I felt the don de dieu was way to citric and almost a bit alcoholic. almost an inch of head. golden color which gave it promise. the nose had a clementine or wheat type smell. it was much different on the palate, as the alcohol (9%) came through more than the flavor. it made it a bit difficult to have more than one, rather than an easy drinking beer. the finish was tart, as citric drinks go, rather than a refreshing finish that i enjoy while drinking a tripel. enjoyable, but not desirable."
"D-This one just doesn't come together nicely for me. It's Ok but but near the bottom of my Unibroue favorites. Won't purchase this again with some many other standout beers available from the U."
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow color with a rocky white head that sticks well. Nose is of yeast, citrus, spices, and pineapple perhaps. Palate follws this track ... prominent yeast flavors, quite spicy and fruity. Hints of black pepper are here too. Mouthfeel is really quite dry and lively. I enjoy the ""burn"" in the throat with this one ... more aneffect of the carbonation than of the ABV, I'd wager. All in all, a very good offering from Unibroue ... again. Despite it's high ABV, this is a very drinkable ale. Nice."
"Poured into a tulip style glass. The color is of a deep cloudy, golden hue. The large foamy head looks like creamy frosting on top of a cake. The aroma is mixed with honey and floral tones. The taste is big honey and then sweet candy sugar, there is a wheat flavor and sweet fruit. I would say that the flavor is complex at the least. The body is full without being a lead weight. I like to have about two of these in a sitting, after that the sweetiness gets in the way. Another Unibroue offering that is great!"
"This is the sweetest Unibroue beer I have come across. This particular one didn't match the complexity of la Maudite or la Fin Du Monde, but there were a lot of mouthwatering tastes in this beer. Very tasty."
"D: Very easy and pleasant to drink, at times I nearly forgot I was drinking a beer. Someone call highlife and tell them that the true champagne of beers has been found."
"The hazy tan-orange hue and massive foam with great sustainability make for an excellent overall appearance. The aroma has a nice mix of citrus, clove spice, banana, and tangy melon, all with a light candy-like sweetness. Initially, the flavor has a rich and bready malt character, with light orange and grapefruit notes and mild spice. The taste quickly starts to take on a sweet corn like flavor toward the finish, however, which detracts a bit from the enjoyment. The alcohol is very well hidden for 9%. Medium body, smooth and lightly creamy on the palate. This beer is pretty decent, it started out great, but I began to tire a bit of the sweet corn finish..."
"The taste is really where this beer shines. Very tasty. A fruity/sweet start that settles down into a nice mellow flavour. Plenty of taste to go around, though. Mouthfeel is rather thick, but the carbonation actually serves to smooth things out. Drinkability is quite good."
"A good Belgian for this side of the pond. Show our neighbors to the north some love and give this beer a spin."
"Alcohol, and vanilla seemed to be the most apparent in the taste, with mild hop presence, a little banana and citrus and some caramel malts. The acrid carbonation that hits you at first fades into a semi sweet, semi tart bittersweet feel thats quite enjoyable. I'd say this was medium-bodied and very well-crafted. An excellent example of a Belgian Strong Ale."
"Drinkability: I like this beer a lot, I really do. Do I think it is as good as when i originally tried it? No. Affordable, Belgian style ale, above average, and very easy to enjoy."
"D  it goes down way too easily for a beer this strong. I like many of the Unibroue beers and in my opinion this is probably one of the best."
"Although its on the strong side (durrr, its a Belgian-style!) Don de Dieu is scary drinkable. Be careful or you could have trouble speaking English by the end of the night, let alone French!"
"Golden color with a slight amber tint. Not a huge head but a nice film coats the top of the beer and leaves nice films of lacing as you drink. Smell is very spicey and yeasty. Taste is the same. High alcohol is well hidden. Very creamy lively mouthfeel. Just the faintest hint of alcohol in the finish. Overall another winner from Unibroue. Not as good as La Fin or Trois in my book but certainly a nice beer."
"Unibroue is a fantastic brewery with very unique beers. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this beer is full-bodied and not as carbonated as some other Unibroue offerings, but it seems to work here."
"Not quite as rich and outstanding overall as Fin du Monde, but another great Unibroue."
"The body is full and creamy. Very little carbonation on the palate, like a real ale. Still feels fairly crisp with a clean finish. Very pleasant, and one of the most drinkable 9% ales out there, in my book."
"Definitely not a session beer due to its high alcoholic content, but I like it because it has a crisp, clean finish and isn't overly sweet."
"The mouth is light, yet very complex, a tug of war of citrus and sweetness being pulled on by spice and alcohol. Once warmed up to the alcoholic finish, I found it highly drinkable. I have yet to find a Unibroue beer that I wouldn't drink, and then drink again."
"Unibroue has a firm grasp of the Belgian style at a fraction of the cost in the states."
"Pours hazy yellow, looks like a Hefeweizen. Fizzy white head recedes to a thin ring around the edge. Smell is yeasty and vaguely citrusy. Taste is cloves, spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is dominated by lots of carbonation. Like others have stated, the alcohol is well hidden, this is a very easy beer to drink."
"Overall: This beer tastes good, but I have had many better. I doubt I will spend my hard earned money on it with others so readally available."
"Overall: Another excellent Belgian Strong Pale Ale from Unibroue. This one is much fruitier than the others."
"But the drinkability just isnt there as a bottle goes for $2.50, just too pricey to enjoy many of these plain and simple brews."
"Jen: I find this to be a decent Unibroue, as is most of their brews. This is quite a smooth beer with an almost creamy mouthfeel. The taste is of mild citrus fruits with a caramel sweetness to it (without the overwhelming maltiness lingering). None of the flavors are too overwhelming, but are mild and well balanced.For a 9% ABV, this beer is quite easy to drink without the alcohol taste."
"The pour into my La Moneuse tulip raises a short-lived one finger head, off white. Lacing is very poor, as well. The beer's color is a somewhat transparent deep gold. Smells of caramel, a bit of grass, yellow raisins, a bit of citrus, and some peppery alcohol. The taste leads in with a bit of citric acid, has a candi-caramel flavor, with spicy alcohol, has a sweet middle, finishes medium-dry and not bitter. Medium mouthfeel with tingly carbonation. This is a smooth, enjoyable beer, but nothing too terribly special."
"This is very drinkable, and I could see downing it a lot faster than intended!"
"drinkability: pretty drinkable, nice canadian-belgian"
"D: A great example of a belgian strong pale ale should be, strongly recommend"
"Perhaps my favourite strong belgian from Unibroue. Pours a golden orange body with sediment clouding its appearance. Ripe mangos and apricots in the nose, with a slight alcoholic/phenol aroma. Some soothing spiciness in the back and a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel was full and creamy and this is extremely drinkable. Wonderfully crafted by Uniborue. This bottle was 2 years old and it was a very well balanced, mellow beer."
"Highly drinkable with loads of flavor, sip too fully enjoy this ale. Highly recommended !"
"D: A great Belgian style ... as with most Belgians, it is a little on the sweet side, but the orange peel rounds out the sweetness with a nice tart snap. This is definitely one to savor."
"Drinkability: Great - balanced, malty, with a little booze and some compelling fruits. Everything I've come to expect from Unibroue."
"Smells sweet--like a Riesling or a very citrusy sauvignon blanc. I'm salivating. Beautiful, beerish orange with slight head. It foamed up big upon pouring, but soon receded to thin, spotty bubbles on the beer surface. I may have let it warm up a bit too much before drinking, bit it's pretty straight-forward. I think the notion of orange in the flavor must me mostly due to my perceptions being swayed by the color. It's sweet and has slight remembrances of banana as well. Good, but far from my favorite Unibroue offering."
"This is my first beer from Unibroue. I look forward to trying there other offerings."
"it's got a thick feel (though well carbonated), that lets the flavors stick around. nice bright fruity flavors and a brief look at some alcohol spice. good balance: fruity & hop"
"CRUX: THIS IS THE REAL ""CHAMPAGNE OF BEERS."" Different take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale, that's for sure. For that alone it's worth the sample."
"Pours pale gold, cloudy from the yeast pour. Two and a half finger head, fizzles out quickly and leaves almost no lace. Complex yeast nose consisting of Unibroue's signature phenolics, heavy pilsener malt, and estery notes of apple, apricot and rose-like alcohol. Sweet high-gravity pilsener malt taste upfront followed by a barrage of belgian phenols. Dry and spicy aftertaste with fusels that pack a wallop. Tiny and abundant streaming carbonation in a med-full body- crisp yet with a thickish texture. The boozey characteristics help liven up the mouthfeel and the result is entertaining. Subdued and indistinct hops, but balanced none-the-less. Finishes dry and tart but mellow, with the alcohol and phenols lingering a bit. A real ""sipper""; and a fascinating interpretation of the style."
"Taste + Mouthfeel- good amount of carbonation helps to produce a well-balanced, and tingly mouthfeel. Some distinctive ""pale"" flavors like a typical pale ale are in the background, hidden behind alcohol, tart fruity flavors, and sugary notes."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a giant foamy head. The smell has lemon, coriander,pepper, and bananas. The aromas were good,but not as strong as I would have hoped. The taste has a creamy.rich mouthfeel that is very good. The taste is much like a Belgian, lemon citrus,floral,clove, bananas, coriander and pepper. The taste is very good with the alcohol hidden very well. This is a very good beer from a brewer who I'm starting to enjoy more and more."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability - this is very good, and goes down well. I like this a lot, but high abv limits this to one in a given session, maybe even the only thing you sip that session."
"It's hard to even tell there is more alcohol in this than an average 5% beer, it is dangerously and delightfully drinkable. Just plain a great beer. I loved how all of the flavors melded so well."
"12 ounce bottle. Unibroue Don de Dieu pours out a slightly hazy yellow color topped with a large, white head. Delicious aroma of bananas and peppery spices. Lots of malt and yeast in the flavor. Peppery spiciness. Finishes with vanilla and more spices. The 9% alcohol is very well hidden. Carbonation is a little high. Great drinkability. Unibroue makes great Belgian style beers, especially the pale beers. Don de Dieu is a fine example."
"I enjoyed it last night as a nightcap - wishing I had some good chocolate to accompany it - and was in beer heaven!"
"Yet another fine offering from Unibroue. Doesn't quite match up to La Fin du Monde or the amazing Trois Pistoles, but tasty nonetheless."
"D - Good, especially considering the alcoholic strength of this brew."
"This is an interesting beer but a little sweet for my palate. I don't consider this up to the superior standards of Unibroue's other offerings."
"Wow. This was my first Unibroue experience and will certainly not be my last. This poured a gorgeous hazy golden-orange color with a nice white head that forms a kickass dome. Good lacing. The smell is definately belgian. Nice and sweet. Clove and banana are there but even more so in the taste. Yeasty goodness. The mouthfeel was almost creamy, but prickly from the carbonation. I can't believe this is a 9% alcohol beer. You can't taste it. It definately hits you like a strong beligian pale but goes down more like a smooth wheat beer. An incredible drinking experience."
"Drinkability: Great to drink and it seems to release another quality after every sip."
" Eric"
"Its pretty easy to drink considering, but should be moderated as Im sure the ABV and the bubbles would go right to the skull if proper procedures were not followed."
"Overall: While there are a lot of interesting things going on with this beer, I enjoyed smelling it more than drinking it; the overwhelming combination of various sweet flavor sensations is difficult to consume in much quantity"
"Drinkability, I would say is decent, for a beer running at 9.0% ABV. Something about this beer keeps me coming back, but it's hard to put my finger on it."
"DA: Pretty drinkable, High Alcohol content limits this, but I could easily have one more."
"Poured a hazy yellow with shades of orange. Thick fizzy head appears quickly after pour but dimininshes within seconds. Smells spicy with fruits such as apples, lemon peel and slight notes of bananas. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and crisp. Taste consists of spicy notes (possibly clove) with other fruits to make a very crisp taste. Another great brew from Unibroue."
"This is a very drinkable beer in my opinion. I wish I could still get in in my area. I haven't seen it in a while where I live."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. It is way too strong and a bit too sweet for long term consumption. I wouldn't mind enjoying this again, but I would likely choose another Unibroue offering ofer this."
"M,D- goes down easy"
"Overall: A very nice beer. Great balance of spice and esters combined with a great mouthfeel. Really easy drinker, this one. The flavor is quite bouyant and really evolves not only with each sip but as you finish the bottle. Unlike some beers that develop a flavor that builds to something unbearable by the time you finish, this beer has flavors that compound into some pretty sweet things by the end of the glass. Glad I have more than one bottle."
"M & D: Stinging carbonation up front on the tip of the tongue. Fizzy mouthfeel with a slight dry wheaty finish on the sides and back of the mouth. Very good offering from Unibroue, but I'm more a fan of la fin du monde, which has more spicyness and flavor, etc. Nice high abv warms the tummy as it goes down. I give two thumbs up for this one. Defiantely drinkable, but there are others out there that are better."
"A nice, if nondescript Belgian from our friends at Unibroue. Reminds me of what would happen if a middle of the road Triple met with a Saison...without the cottony dryness."
"A rather typical offering from Unibroue, but one I couldn't pass up at the local BevMo after not seeing it for quite some time. Nose is of phenols and the ubiquitous Unibroue yeast. Taste is quite the same, but with a nice wheat finish. An enjoyable beer on occasion, but I quite prefer La Fin Du Monde to this. I'm admittedly not a huge fan of witbiers, but this is worth a try. I'm almost curious enough to place a lemon wedge in this, but alas I have none. Drinkability suffers a bit as this is a tad one dimensional for a Unibroue offering."
"Taste; once again, very hefe-weizenesque. The oranges, bananas and cloves are there, with a little honey sweetness, ginger and plenty of other spices. Not quites what I was expecting, but still very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is on the light side, and very easy to drink. This would make for a good summertime beer if the alcohol were not so high."
"The pour treats the eyes to golden wheat body and an icing like tight head. Nose is subdued ... lemon peel and sugary sweetness. Taste is full of lemon, sugar and tartness. After it warms substantially complex spiciness shines through in the middle, elevating the overall experience. Mouth is tickled with tiny carbonation bubbles. I suppose I will buy this again, it's pretty tasty, though not the best of the style I've had."
"Overall I enjoyed this brew and found it fully refreshing. My only complaint is that it is somewhat pricey... $7 for a 4 pack of 12 oz bottles here in Louisville (yes a 4 pack). I'm glad I tried it, and I will consider other beers from the same brewery."
"Unibroue Don de Dieu pours an orange color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The taste is strongly of wheat and maybe some apricot like flavors. This is really a tasty beer, definitely worth a try. This is the first of the Unibroue beers that I've tried, and it definitely makes me want to try some more."
"Pours a golden color with a cloud of yeast around the glass. The head is an off white sticky lace. The aroma is a light fuity sweetness and some alcohol. Crisp medium body with a lot carbonation. The flavor has hints of ripe fruits and bready yeast. A little spicy and sweet. Finishes clean and semi-dry. Delicious pale ale with one hell of kick to it! A bit pricey but worth every penny."
" Michael Jackson also mentions this brew in the same sentence as Duvel and that's a fair comparison, although I like this one a fair bit better. Another nice try from the boys in Chambly."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy, straw color with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is fruity - apples and caramel apples with hints of butter. The taste is unique with some apples and light cinnamon with a distict tartness. I expected some alcohol flavor, but, there was none that I could discern. The yeast gives it an bread-like flavor with hints of white wine tanginess. The hops are minimal. Overall, a good beer."
"Pours a hazy burnished gold with a nice pearl white head that retains well for a BSPA. The aroma has a wheaty twang initially, followed by some citrus, white pepper, corriander, light candy sugar, typical unibroue yeast smell and a touch of alcohol, very nice. The flavor also starts out with a wheaty twang almost like a hefe, then there are some big citrus flavors (orange and lemon) followed by some spice (white pepper and corriander), candy sugar, yeast and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with moderate carbonation; drinkability is good. Another solid offering from unibroue and the wheat adds some intrigue to the beer."
"Overall: The weakest Unibroue offering Ive tried. Trois Pistoles blows this one away (no pun intended)."
"I would only want one...this is good, but I think I prefer Unibroue's other brews....most of which are outstanding."
"MMmmm"
"Drinkability: I would enjoy this ale in moderation."
"This Triple wheat beer poured a slightly hazy , orangish gold with a white head of about an inch. Aroma is of some tangy ripe fruit and spice , a hint of vanilla , and a very light hop scent. Taste is kind of sweet , full bodied , creamy fruit flavors , a sturdy spice , and some warming alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is on the creamy side. A very tasty and drinkable Belgian. Refreshing , but packs a punch."
"I just wasn't too excited about this beer. It was clear yellow color with a thick white head that quickly dissipated. It had a grainy, fresh aroma with a little bit of spiciness. It tasted sweet and spicy, light on the hops. An OK beer, but not very inspiring. I've enjoyed othe Unibroue products more."
"Dee-friggin-licious."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, leaves a bit of film on my tongue. Alcohol is pretty well hidden."
"This beer poured a hazy gold color and was topped by a bubbly white head. Even with a load of champagne bubbles, rising to the top, the head receded pretty quickly. Lots of fresh bread in the nose. There is citrus there too lemon/orange and even a little pear. Just a touch of caramel on the finish. The flavor has a lot of lemon citrus, a light yeast character. The finish has a lot of apple cider. Just a touch of alcohol. Great carbonation, full mouth feel. Great beer. Unibroues beers really propelled me into Advocacy when I experience them for the first time a few years ago. I cant believe Im just getting around to reviewing them."
"Don De Dieu pours a hazy, darkish gold color with a pillowy head that lingers. Aroma was sweet, malty and spicy(cloves?). Taste was quite sweet with notes of malt, cloves, spices, ripe fruit and honey. There was a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol was barely noticeable and can be deceiving for such a strong beer. I gave this beer a 3.5 for drinkability because the sweetness was a little overpowering. It was just too damn sweet for my tastes. Not a bad beer, but it's my least favorite of Unibroue so far."
"Ive reviewed a number of beers from this brewery and Im starting to notice a trend: all of their beers (except for the dark brews) have one mild, though consistent flaw, a somewhat weak finish. Other than that, theyre drinkable and refreshing, even with high alcohol contents. Recommended."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is hindered by the abv. Outside of that, the ale is good and makes me wonder if Unibroue can do no wrong."
"Unibroue, an awsome brewery and a great beer from them. Pours a hazy golden color. Smells quite sweet. Taste is quite sweet but not sickly sweet, an odd yogurty taste with a bit of yeasty flavor too. Very drinkable, it's a bit powerful but this is another winner from Unibroue."
"The body is hard to trace but about the mid range. The carbonation is way too high for this and kind of masks some of the really good flavors out there. Overall this is a good beer but just like Cannonball Run, could be better."
"This review is done, and so is my beer. Highly recommended, and I'll definitely return for this one again and again. Santé!"
"A nice beer, but that said, not quite as awsome as some other Unibroue beers. Fun, in a simple kind of way."
"D - Very drinkable. Will definitely buy again."
"The color is a yellow-orange and slightly cloudy. I recommend this brew to anyone wanting to try something different and new."
"2/14/99, 750 ml bottle with cork and cap, 6.99 at the local Bevmo. Best by date is 6/29/08; cork reads 0502. Pours a cloudy golden color, about a 3/4 white head. Beautiful smell, yeasty and dry, but with some citrus notes, grass, graperfruit. Tastes incredible, dry and subtle but very complex  bread, hard water, cloves, champagne. Lots of carbonation right to the end of the bottle; that and the buttery finish belie the 9% abv. This is a great tasting beer that gets more interesting as it warms a little, revealing oak and walnut notes."
"D: Absolutely want this beer again. Got nicer the warmer it became. Very little of the alcohol strength came through - just a well-made tasty beer. Both my wife & I approve!"
"750ml corked bottle, pours light and golden with lots of carbonation. Nice white head with a bit of lacing. Stong vanilla and ester smell, tons of carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel hides the 9% alchohol very well. There is a bit of spice on the tip and a slightly Belgium sour aftertaste but generally very smooth from front to back. Made with wheat so flavor is much like a wit beer but much more potent and complex. For a strong beer this is really nice to drink, smooth yet full of complex flavors. Another awesome beer from Unibroue."
"Maybe not the best of Unibroue's lineup, but it is a solid contender. Triple wheat indeed."
"Drinkable but not moreish. two would by my max, really feel the abv. Not my cup of tea, but representative of its style. Belgian beer freaks will enjoy this"
"Corked and caged 750mL. Light haze in a golden straw coloured beer with a fluffy, bright white head. Minimal lace and the foam reduced quickly to a thin wisp. Sweet malt aroma with a great combination of lemon, bready yeast, light spice and alcohol. Bready sweet with mild bitterness to start, followed by citrus fruit (mostly lemon). Sweetness increases towards the end and it finishes with a bit of alcohol warmth and spice. Medium/high carbonation, medium bodied with some creaminess. Alcohol is a bit drying and there's light slickness. Great balance between malt, alcohol, and spice. Easy to drink given the high abv."
"It pours yellow orange with a quick to fizz away white head. Looks a little cloudy. The high point is the smell: raspberries and citrus dominate with a muskiness beneath. The taste is very mild fruity emphasizes berries and ends with the warmth of the alcohol. THe aftertaste is nearly absent, pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is fair, seems a little flat as time passes on, but a drinkable brew nonetheless. I would reinvest my money for that smell. It could be a good summer evening drink."
"Well done."
"You know, after drinking this, I've come to the conclusion that Unibroue is absolutely my favorite brewer of Belgian-style ales. Every single one I've had is wonderful."
"At 9%, it's good for sipping. There are better Belgian and Belgian-style ales of similar profile, but Unibroue gets close enough once again."
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer! I don't really know where the distinction between a Strong Pale and a Tripel are...but this one walks the line. I would guess that since the alcohol is ""only"" 9%, that is what makes this Pale."
"One of the best."
"This is really nice. I'm really diggin' the spiciness of this brew. Maybe it just fits well for tonight, but I like this one a lot."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden brown full of yeast with a tall foamy head. It smelled of fresh berries and slightly yeasty. The taste was sweet, fruity, mildly spicy, a little bitter and alcoholic but not unpleasantly so. It was thick and smooth, almost creamy. Overall I felt that it was a good somewhat sweet and full bodied beer."
"Don de Dieu is the favorite unibroue of several of my friends, I find it to be a bit too spicy and not heavy enough to sustain itself. The beer pours a wheat color and gives of strong hints of both citrus and coriander. It drinks relatively light; however, the taste is confusing and does not seem to have the cohesiveness of several other unibroue offerings."
"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter, pours a hazy golden straw color with a finger of fizzy white head that vanishes almost immediately, no real lacing. Nose is candi sugar, apricot, and slightly spicey yeast. Taste is nice and yeasty, a slightly sweet candi sugared malt, plenty of fruit--tangerine, banana, apricot, pear, orange; and some coriander spiciness. Full bodied with a moderate carbonation level and a smooth dry feel. This is a pretty good beer, but not even close to La Fin du Monde, the same style from the same brewery, which I think I'll stick with."
"I found this brew to be very enjoyable and easy to drink (especially for the high ABV)."
"Presented in a 12oz, foil-wrapped bottle. Pours a cloudy golden color topped by a pretty, 2-finger white head that dissipates a bit too quickly. Beautiful, clean aroma of Belgian yeast, wheat, light citrus, and some piney hops. Palate is intriguing - light sweet malt, some wheat, citrus tang, and a touch of astringency. Some piney Euro hops come through on the finish. Body is a bit too foamy, but still holds the flavor well. A bit lighter than some of the other Unibroue offerings, and very drinkable."
"Compares well with Duvel...I think this one is more drinkable for me right now. I like this beer better than Duvel, but will give Duvel another try...I think I had a bad open and pour with it...blahblahblah."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry, but a good kind of dry. A slightly muddy palate that reminded me of gardening."
"750 mL corked and caged. Golden with a massive snow white head that started to get out of control -- sipped some foam before analyzing! Nose is yeasty apples, lemons and pepper. Taste is much of the same: lots of appley white grape flavors with a lemony white pepper finish. Dry and very light bodied for such a strong abv. Mystifying stylistically. Quite a thirst-quencher considering its abv. Not my favorite from Unibroue, but definitely a choice offering."
"Drinkability: Give me more please! Beware this drink doesn't feel like 9%."
"This beer pours a lager-like creamy golden with not much head at all. Smells like wall paper paste, apricots, chocolate, play dough and lacquer. The smell makes a lot more sense when paired with the flavor. There are tons of delightful dry fruits with a well paired dry yeast. There are smooth and creamy apricots, sweet prunes and sour plumbs. Very delicious! Mouth feel is medium bodied with heavy carbonation."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a fizzy off white head that quickly disappears with no lacing either. Musty buttery aromas, lemon, pineapple, pear and pepper flavors. Medium to full bodied with a crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes a bit sour."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and actively carbonated."
"Sits pleasant and citrusy when it first enters your mouth. This grows, turns a little sour, and right before the fruit gets too sour it's washed away in a wave of caramel malt."
"smooth, nice. great beer."
"Mouthfeel is a touch on the light side with a fast moving carbonation that dashes across the palate. Really refreshing for a brew of this strength. I wouldn't mind having another if I had one on hand. Unibroue has not failed to impress me so far. This one is well worth checking out."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. The alcohol is covered up in both taste and smell. Very smooth to drink."
"ABV."
"Drinkability- Wanted to just glup this down it was so good. As it warms it gets even better. Kinda tough to find around here though. One of my new favorite brews."
"Two years ago, I would have turned by nose and mouth away from a Don de Diue. Now, in this post-Pop the Cap, 250+review pallette, this one is a great example of the style. Clean and fresh, this one sparkles in the mouth, gives only a slight hint of its alcohol content, and retains just the slightest head and bit of carbonation to make it welcoming from first sip to last. Only $2.50 a bottle at the local gas station of all places, this one is a great introduction to those just trying this style or high gravity beers. Another great brew from Unibroue."
"Short lived thin white head ... or a dirty beer glass, This pale gold brew has the odd floaty from this lightly sedimented brew Carbonation is initially very intense . Fruity, funky nose typical of this style. Taste is sweet pale malts, with fruity ale yeast and a short spicy hop finish. Mouth feel is smooth and light with tingly carbonation at first, though this fades as the brew warms. Very drinkable brew. Hides the 9% alcohol well!"
"Drinkability: Unibroue continues to produce amazing stuff, and this is no exception. This bottle is out of the 4-pack I just purchased, which means there are 3 bottles left, and you know what that means. I'd certainly more than recommend this."
"This is a special beer for me. It is my first belgian. My first beer that I consider exotic. It is an opaque orange to straw color. Has a white head with good retention and decent lacing. Tons and tons of carbonartion floading up out of it. This beer smells good. As soon as I open the bottle the grassy aroma hits me. It is sweet and delicious in smell-slightly fruity. When I drink this, it has tons of flavor. It has that grassy smell, it is slightly sweeter than I would expect, but it is delicious. I just cannot identify the fruity flavor, slightly citrus, slighltly spiced, and slightly like musk mellon. The beer is light to medium bodied and dry. It has no alcohol taste, but great alcohol warming. Not something I can hammer down, but not something I get tired of quickly either."
"Sticky mouthfeel. If this was a blind taste test, the looks and tastes of this beer seemed similar to any macro like Icehouse or one of those sweet beers. My fourth Unibroue, and definitely the worst of the four."
"what to say?"
"BB 11-15-07. Good white head and a very foggy pale golden colored beer. Nose is (buck)wheat, alcoholic and yeast phenolic. Strawberry fruithint and overal interesting nose. Tste is strongly alcoholic, dry but with sweet candyhint. Yes this is a lot like a good Belgium beer and has fine mouthfeel with good taste, well dosed but not to high bitterness and good carbonisation. Fine brew that I enjoyed all the way."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is carbonated feeling and slightly slick near the end. Ultimately, a tasty brew. And at 9 %... a sneaky one. Unibroue makes me a happy beer drinking lady."
"Notes: Overall this is probably the least favorite of the Unibroues I've tried so far. Of course it's still better than the vast majority of other beers I've tasted in my life, I just prefer their more flavorful offerings that I've tried. However I'll definitely never complain about drinking this one."
"Color was a pale golden color with a slight haze. Nice thick frothy head that was developing like a cumulus cloud on a hot summer day. If you know what that looks like. The smell was just what I thought from this style beer. A fruity and floral like scent, a nice balance. Not overpowering very subtle and pleasant. Tatste was spicy at first with a slight citrus zing. A nice dry aftertaste rounds out this well balanced and not so overpowering beer. The ABV is powerfull but you cant taste it. Its an amazingly smooth beer."
"Smooth and tart mouthfeel with excellent light body from the carbonation. High ABV is hidden. Dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a real hazy golden orange, big white head forms, laces well and has some nice legs. Smell is sweet, orange peel and coriander, some spicy hops, very nice. Taste is sweet honey like malt, orange peel and coriander again, some yeast and bread. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation. Smooth beer and great orange peel flavour, one of Unibroues best."
"12 ounce bottle. Code on back 050814. My 1000th consecutive review, but not the 1000th different beer review."
"This brew pours a clear golden orange color with a small white head that disappears within seconds. The aroma is of orange peel with a trace of alcohol. The taste is nice. Orange and spices. The mouthfeel is overcarbonated and gets in the way of the taste. Overall, this is a decent brew, but I would choose La Fin Du Monde over it anyday."
"Extremely well balanced with a clean finish. Easy drinking, strong and alcoholic. Dangerous combination."
"Pretty damn drinkable... wishin I wouldve bought the 750ml instead of the 12oz, but hell, there were so many other beers I wanted to sample, and just didn't have the cash on me :("
"Another very impressive and unique offering from Unibroue. What would you call this, a Triple Wit? This certainly could become my favorite Unibroue beer. Insanely drinkable, it hides its 9% very well, as most Unibroue beers do. Now that it's available here in NC, I'm definitely stocking up on this. I can imagine having a good creamy cheese with this that's a little on the sharp side. In fact, I may just do so right now as I finish this gem."
"Another winner from Unibroue. Pours out to a nice cloudy golden color with a white cloud like head. No traces of lace around the glass. High level of carbonation. Aromas of fruits, sweetness and floral hints are abound in this well crafted beer. The taste is utterly superb. Near perfect. Flavors of sweet fruit, with a smooth tartness and elements of a dry finish are all well balanced here. Some mild hop character is also noted. Very nice. Smooth and almost champagne like mouthfeel. This brew has high drinkability, as the flavors and complexity of this beer mask the 9% ABV very well. Highly Recommended."
"Nice combination. the sour notes sit for a while and escelates as it warms. Recomended."
"Drinkability is great on this beer, another Unibroue Winner!"
"Very fruity, citrusy beer. Sweet and sour on the palate. Nice notes from yeast. Interesting, tasty."
"I would love to drink these all day long, but it would be VERY short day due to the alcohol."
"Wow, much of what I'd expect to find in a Belgian Tripel, but with much more malt character. Looks nicely copper; what you'd find in any other pale ale, just with more carbonation and looser head. Aromas are malty sweet, toasty, bready, yeasty, earthy, mildly hoppy, and spicy. You can really taste the malt. Like and all-malt Tripel. Less of a powdered sugar flavors and more malt character, more toastedness and roastedness. Not the sharp spiciness either. Milder spices from an agressive hop bill. Nicely bittered. Still grapefruity, lemony, orange-ey. Finishes alcoholic and dry, with a touch of a lingering sweetness. This is a good beer."
"The taste is similar to the smell. There were flavors of more citrus, orange and pineapple, with some sweetness mixed with the sour yeast. Reminded me of a strong witbier. The high alcohol warms in the stomach, but is well balanced and hidden beneath all the flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, a mix of the warm alcohol and tingling refreshing carbonation. Would be great with a fine meal or as an after dinner drink."
"Hazy and gold in the glass, with the powerful aroma of yeast and lemons. More citrus flavors (lemons and oranges) combine with spices and yeast. A nice effervescent mouthfeel to this one too. Shockingly mellow for 9%... I couldn't pick up any alcohol note in the smell or the taste. This beer is probably best described as a kind of cross between a wit and a trippel. I wish this was available locally."
"drinkability is dangerously high because this brew is so delicious with little in the taste to warn of the 9% abv -- luckily the delicate complexity compels one to linger over each glass."
"Taste is the aforementioned spice up front, tingles on the tongue a bit, a biting wheat crispness followed by the slow alcohol burn. Peppery too as it finishes with hints of sour apple. Mouth is crisp up front with a lightly sticky finish. Damn good stuff really. One of my favorite Unibroue offerings thus far."
"An excellent Unibroue offering. Appearance is murky golden with bubbles rising in my tulip glass. The aroma is pleasant, with some yeast, spices, and a bit of sweetness evident. Taste is very complex and pleasurable, with some powdery and nutty yeast flavor complementing the ripe fruit essence. There is a bit of a toffee-type sweetness along with the oily phenolic undertones. The taste begins to become more complex as the ale warms, bringing out some very mellow and dark citrus along with the cashew nuttiness. There is ample carbonation and an excellent, light smoothness as the ale goes down. A very drinkable ale if you look past the ABV%. 2 or 3 of these and you're done. Another excellent ale from Unibroue."
"Definitely a session brew given how light and citrusy this one is and still clocks in at 9% abv. The citrus character is what makes this one unique. Worth a try."
"Hell yes this beer is drinkable. It is liquid cocaine, tasty to the nth degree. This is truly lovely stuff. I have no grievances. I was very happy to purchase a four-pack in St. Joseph, MO. Unibroue is so close yet so far away! Awesome. Recommended."
"This is definatly something I'm going to buy again."
"I hate to compare but if you really like Chimay Cinq Cents(wit), you probably would find only slightly less complexity in this Canadian offering, and at about $1.50(american) less per 333ml bottle. ($2.50=Don De Dieu v. $3.99 Chimay cinq cents)."
"Full mouthfeel that has a good tingle from the carbonation. The only limit to the drinkability is the high abv."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a 3 fingher billowing head that falls to half a finger. The nose is peppery and lemoney with a puff of alcohol. Not bad. The flavor is mellow. The lemon is subdued and the spice is not very powerful. There is a light grainey flavor and a creamyness. No hint of the alcohol except a warming sensation in my stomach. The feel is thick with a light carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer. Drinkability is huge. The alcohol in the nose is a little too strong."
"D: Excellent beer. The smell and taste are incredible. Seems to taste better as it warms up. This should be on everyone's list of beers to try at least once."
"Taste: A myriad of fruit and hop tinges coupled with a slightly spicy character. Slight yeast and bread taste from the refermented sedement. Finishes with a prickly carbonation which is very smooth on the palate. Unibroue makes some very solid brews, and this is no exception. The alcohol is well integrated into the taste as is the case with all Unibroue beers."
"Clear light golden-yellow with a very loud fizzy head that doesn't last too long, or lace at all. Smell tells you what you are in for - a yeast/spice showcase! Hooray! Alive and well with strawberries, marshmallow, white pepper, light citrus, and vanilla. Wow. Really superb. Big vanilla flavor reminiscent of some better white wines, with some butter, pear, and green apple present also. The pepperiness really plays off the simple malt sweetness here to make an absolute winner. Alcohol present in the perfect amount to compliment the rest. Light bodied and semi-slick despite the healthy carbonation. Finish is again wine-like, well balanced, woody, and warming. Awesome."
"This one pours a little bit more restrained than I was expecting, yielding only a 2 finger white head which quickly dissolves. It did produce a nice clear golden body however. Aroma is wonderful, fruity and spicy. Apple and clove are noticable. Taste pushes that spice out to the forefront. A light maltiness is overtaken by fresh apple/pear and a subtle hint of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is light for a beer of this abv and its drinkability belies its strength. Phenomenal brew from a phenomenal brewery."
"Huge off-white head is alive, both growing and ""popping"" at the same time. It's fed by a cloud of fine bubbles that rise through the hazy golden straw colored beer. Great aroma, a bit of yeasty goodness and some mild nectarine along with some coriander notes. Flavor is similar, some light fleshy fruit up front over a solid creamy yeasty base. It's a lot more complex then just those two, and there is a dolop of alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and light, just right. So much for 750ml bottle bias. This is 12oz's of heaven."
"Super tasty Belgian pale ale. Another great beer from Unibroue. Recommended,"
"Comments - This is a great beer. I suggest that it be warmed up a little bit before drinking to let the flavors really shine through."
"A little uninspired. Certainly a fine brew, but relatively disappointing. 750ml corked and caged. Poured a nice orange/peach combination with mild head retention; also is a bit cloudy. Smell and taste are almost identical, peach and fruity esters accompanied by a large kick of alcohol. Taste is fine, heavy carbonation, actually quite light, pretty drinkable too."
"Dedfinately a tastey and unique offering. I would call it a wheat ale on steroids. Lacks a little of the complexity of some of the better Unibroues, but still makes a pleasant after-dinner sipper."
"Nice golden/orange color with good head retention. Great fruity aroma. Peaches, pears, and oranges. Spicy flavor that leaves your mouth tingling. The alcohol is definitely noticable. Very sweet, tart finish. It went great with a grilled chicken sandwich that I made which was marinaded in honey dijon mustard."
"Overall a magnificent rendition of a Triple Wheat beer if you will. I'd like to know the % of wheat malt used (?) For such a sturdy ABV, I'm surprised the alcohol warmth is masked so well. This beer has definitely found a place in my heart and refridgerator."
"The taste is tastefully done. Once again, the heavily spiced nose typical of the Belgian styles I have tried made me skeptical at first. The flavor is really mild and refreshing though. Just the right components. Thankfully not a spice overload. Unibroue has renewed my faith in Belgian style ales. Nice wet finish that leaves in a crisp fashion with just a hint of spice and honey remaining on the tongue. There is an almost mead-like character to her although much more delicious. There is never any alcohol impression given off. Nicely crafted. I wouldn't have expected anything less from Unibroue at this juncture. They make some really fantastic stuff up there. The mouthfeel is like sparkling wine with the hefty carbonation effect. The effervescence lends to the crisp finish and enjoyability of the brew. I could drink these in the shade on a hot day and be in hog heaven."
"Another evil brew from Unibroue. Pours hazy pale orange with a reasonably white head. Aroma is sweet, fruity and estery - almost acetone in nature overlaid with hints of yeast and malt. Good carbonation and a smooth and silky mouthfeel and a finishes dry with a bit of bite from the alcohol. Ester overtones extend through the flavour, along with - of all things - a cherry tone (almost like kirsch).Very easy drinking, could easily have a few more of these but fortunately (in terms of tomorrow's hangover) I have only one bottle. Should have been called Don de Diablo!"
"Drinkability and Overall: It's not the best tasting, but it looks wonderful, smells delicious and feels oh so good in the mouth. The drinkability is brought down by the strong lingering alcohol burn. All in all, another good beer from Unibroue, but far from thir best."
"($8.99 / 4-pack)"
"Pours a cloudy apricot color with good head though not much retention. Smell is citrus, bread, banana and malt. Taste is malt, citrus, bready, banana with an alcohol bloom late. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and it warms the back of the mouth. Drinkability is quite high although I prefer others from this brewery more. None are bad, just not a big fan of the banana aspect."
"Great beer."
"Don de Dieu ('Gift of God' or 'God's Gift' if my rusty French is accurate) is a fine example of the BSPA style. Its minor faults, which are really just my prejudices, may be seen as positives by many. Another quality brew from a quality brewery."
"12 oz., best before 4/19/07. Served slightly chilled in a tulip glass. Pours golden orange with a white 3 finger head that doesn't leave lacing but keeps a quarter inch of foam throughout. The carbonation is very active and the beer becomes cloudy with a hint of brown after adding the rest of the bottle. Aroma is huge and very fruity (bananas/dark fruits/a bit of citrus) with some hop spiciness and alcohol scents. The alcohol also makes itself known in the flavor and the warming sensation it leaves. Other flavors are grape, apple, wheat, yeast, other fruits, a hop spiciness I had to search for, and a nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is full yet the beer is also light and incredibly refreshing for 9%. Smooth and very drinkable."
"Unibroue wins, give them the medal, its over. No one outside of Belgium makes Belgian beers as good as Unibroue. They deserve honorary citizenship. This beer can go head to head with a Duvel or La Chouffe any day of the week."
"One of Unibroue's top offerings. It's amazing how they out-Belgian almost every other brewery in North America that tries for these styles, on such a wide range of beers."
"Pours cloudy pale honey colored, one finger frothy head that lingers a bit. Smells of yeasts and citrus with hints of alcohol. Taste is wonderfully citrusy and yeasty. Ooh, and 9% doesn't hurt. Mouthfeel is nice. It's a good beer, although I've had better from this brewery. Also, at the end I'm getting huge chunks of yeast. Yuck!"
"Well I was under whelmed by this one. Looked and smelled great but just didn't deliver in the flavor department. Carbonation level seems low but the bottle is not spoiled. No off flavors or vinegarization. I hate to not give a Unibroue beer a good review but this one just didn't deliver in the taste department. Will try again and possibly revise this review."
"Another Unibroue from my sampler pack. This poured a pale gold with a tiny head. Smelled slightly like applesauce. The taste is ok, but again - like apples and thats not exaclty what i am looking for in beer. There is too much sweetness in this beer for my taste. It lingers in the mouthfeel. Pretty good drinkablilty, hard to tell its a high abv and still goes down quite well."
"Notes: This bottle is very old. I wonder when it was bottled. Definitely mellowed out, no hop bitterness, flavor, or aroma left. I?ll need to get a newer bottle to make comparisons."
"Yes, its not as good as La Fin, but who cares? It drinks just fine on its own."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer, although it's not as good as La Fin Du Monde. I'd buy that one first if I had a choice. This one, while good, just doesn't have enough oomph for a winter's night, despite the 9% ABV. (I have a feeling this one may taste better in the summer, so I'll retry it then.)"
"Pours out to a pastel yellow in the glass. Aroma brings forth a good dose of lemon. The taste falls in line with the Unibroue group of beers with a signature yeast doing its magic. Lemon, citrus and slight nuttiness are present. Such a well-crafted beer. It hides the ABV very well."
"A most excellent selection."
"As always, Unibroue chooses an historical name which traces the history/mythology of early Canada. Hence, Don De Dieu(Gift Of God), Samuel De Champlain's ship, from France, commisioned to explore the St. Lawrence. Unibroue's beer nomenclature has always impressed me: always somewhat arcane, but eye catching; intriguing. This triple white ale was a pale murky yellow colour, an extremely light pineapple hue with brown, definitely unclear, and non-sparkling. The head is near-bright-white. I am not sure if it was this bottle or my glass, but the head was surprisingly small, bubbling quickly to a thin film, leaving poor lacing. The aroma is an impressive display of Belgian know-how. Oak wooden smells along with musty yeast and sourish fruit. I get a very aged, dusty aroma from far above the rim; in closer, the soapy, citrusy yeast arrives, along with cork and wood. Pineapple, some salinity, apple peel, spice, seasoning salt, some red wine notes. An extremely sharp fruit taste not unlike some of their Ephemere versions, but less direct and one-track. Instead, the fruit tastes are mixed well, leaving orange, green apple, some lemon, nectarine, and white grapes. The malt is not totally masked, as I could get some decent caramel/crystal malt in the middle and front of the tongue. The saltiness is felt in the finish, along with the dry yeast, hops barely being felt at all. Some numbing clove in the aftertaste. Wheat, soap, clove--all the basics of a witbier. The alcohol, felt in the middle, is well masked. The finish leaves more oak/cork tastes, some tiny malt ones, and defining salty ones, bacon-like. The mouthfeel is as good as some excellent Belgians I have tried, with perhaps more citrus, akin to a hefeweizen. Medium, bordering on high carbonation. The lees, greener and more creamy, brought less of a phenol hit and more apple than anything. Sufficiently bodied without compromising drinkability, as indeed this refreshing but heavy white ale easily slides down the gullet, 9% notwithstanding. Gift of God? Undoubtedly."
"Overall, this is another excellent beer from a great Canadian brewery. I love them."
"Overall, excellent and easy to drink. Definitely gets put on the ""frequent purchase"" list."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a tall head that fades really fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a strong wheat character with some fruits and floral hops. The alcohol comes out in the flavor. Yeast provides a certain spice and clove to the taste. Has a bit of the wheat flavor. This one is good, but not great. A little too heavy."
"Pours a light amber/straw color, transparent, with a full white fluffy head. Co2 was light and head retention was low, but leaves a respectable level. Aroma is of fruity esters, malt, yeast, sour apples and citrus fruits. Flavor has a sweet start, tart middle and a tart and lightly dry finish. Palate is medium bodied and lively with lots of activity. An interesting balance of tart to sweet, and an unusual representation of the style. Worth another try."
"Very drinkable, this brew raises the bar for wheat beers."
"An excellent beer all around. No harsh flavors or subdued characteristics. Everything comes out with good force."
"I wish I could say it's more drinkable, but at first this beer is heavy, flavorful, highly carbonated, and potent. I like all of those things, but it doesn't make for a high drinkability. Just thought I'd note that."
"Pours a dirty opaque golden color. Head is probably the weakest part of this beer, sadly. A Belgian should just have more head, darn it. Smell is good, slightly fruity, yeasty, and strong. Taste is this beer's strength. Solid, bold, this could be a wheat beer, if it's flavor wasn't so strong. Big malt profile and very citrus-like, with the carbonation being integral to the flavor, along with some detectable alcohol flavor. Complex, and multi layered, but I feel it needs just a little more depth to claim the elusive 5. Still, this is surprisingly refreshing for a Belgian, which are usually too complex to be a summer beer, but this really reminds me of a wheat in terms of it's crisp favor. An excellent brew."
"This brew pours a hazy deep amber color with bursts of golden hues.. A huge white head forms over an inch high and leaves absolutely no lace. Aromas are yeasty and estery, with some banana, clove, honey, and light fruits.. Initial flavors start of with a slight peppery spice, followed by a sweet wheaty flavor and a big yeasty bite. A hint of lemony flavors work their way into the mix along with a slight clove, and bit of banana, some other fruity goodness and yet even more esters. The carbonation to this brew is quite crisp and just feel great on the pallate. The finish is smooth and yeasty, making a tasty Belgian Pale."
"I don't know which is my favourite now, this or La fin du Monde. Oh Lord, what a delicious brew. Pours a pale gold with a hint of orange. Looks like a sunset. Big, fluffy head with staying power. That sucker didn't diminish at all. Stayed two fingers and remained two fingers. Bonus points for that. Such a wonderful scent. Pale malts, cloves, bananas, apricots, pears, oranges, lemons, even a bit of grapefruit and other various exotic fruits. With an alcohol kick, of course. Oh God, what a heavenly taste. Sweet, smooth and delicious. Bananas at first show up on the tongue, entering like a close friend. Then KAPOW!!! It's a mob of fruits and malts. Their having a party. But not a rowdy party, a civilized party. More of a social gathering. Crowded, but polite. And ever so good. A nice, creamy mouthfeel that coats the throat and goes down smooth. Sorry though, needs a little more thickness for a perfect score. Drinkable? Oh yeah. I could drink this all day, every day. I dunno know. I think this and La fin du Monde are now tied. Hopefully, this will now be easier to get in Ontario."
"Somewhat lighter in color than expected. Malty aroma with fruity over tones and a hint of sulfur. The taste is smooth, malty and with a spicy fruitiness that blends very well. The alcohol is deceiving with this ale. A clasic example of a Belgan Golden Stong. Great beer to engoy with a friend."
"12 oz. twist-off bottle best before 4-19-2007. Pours a hazy golden color with a decent white head. Soft yeasty nose and aromas of candi sugar, malt, ginger and some fruity tones. Carbonation level is good and keeps the beer crisp. Sweet fruitiness like fuzzy-skinned fruit and honey-like in its malt with some subdued wheat ale charcteristics. Yeast play a role in the flavor adding a cloviness and cideriness to the whole profile. Somewhat of a drier, phenolic and estery finish. Ethanol is noticable, but not overtaking. Worth a shot."
"Poured a cloudy yellow with a tight sticky cap (Palest of the U-ales).Lively carbonation. Aromas of fruit, honey and spices. Starts with a light sharp prickly mouthfeel from the carbonation and hops then the large malts depart a more firm, bready, creamy body... finish lingers with the sweet malts mingleing with spice notes and a slow subtle drying accented by a very noticable warming from the alcohol. I like this ale and think it is smooth, light and the most drinkable of the Unibroue Belgians."
"CAUTION: THIS BEER CAUSES GOOD TIMES!!!! This is an amazing beer that everyone should try no matter if you like the style or not. This beer pours a very bubbly white head on top of a murky dark golden yellow base. The yeast smell is very very strong, it overpowers any other smell that might be present, but there was a little spice to the smell. The flavor starts as sweet malt, somewhat strong but not in a bad way. There is a little spice, and just a little hint of fruit flavor at the end. The sweet alcohol is hidden very very well, I have no idea how they hide 9%, but they do. This brew goes down so smooth that you will be in trouble before you know it, all the while bubbles will tingle on your tongue. The after taste fades somewhat fast. THIS IS ADDICTIVE. Amazing is the best word to describe this beer, every sip is the same kick of sweet flavor that doesnt seem to fade as your pallet becomes used to it. The alcohol will sneak up on you, WATCH OUT! I am very surprised this in not near the top of the BA top 100 list."
"Supremely drinkable for 9% alcohol and refreshing for hot summer months. My first GA legal high alcohol brew, hooray."
"Easy to drink, but nothing you would want to pay attention to."
"I used to be a stalwart Maudite man, but it's been so long since I've had a Don de Dieu that I have literally missed the boat on such a fine ale. I'll be heading back to B.C. soon to be picking up more of this to stockpile and cellar. This does nothing but prove the beautiful organic alchemy that Unibroue is capable of accomplishing."
"This is light in the mouth for the type of beer that it is but also rather dry and crisp. It is another Unibroue beverage that pleads for another round."
"Overall: Another top-of-the-line beer from Unibroue. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a dark orange, leaves a bright white head, but it is short lived. Lacing in the tulip glass is nice, and the carbonation gives the drink a lot of zest and pop. The taste is unusual, sumptuous, sweet (but not sickeningly so) and light on the palate. Lots of orange, tangerine, apricot, maybe some cloves or coriander in there, some wet wheat taste. I bought a six pack of these and experimented with them by pouring the whole bottle into the first beer (with a swirl and pour of the last 1/4 inch or so of the bottom yeast). The second beer I had I left the last 1/4 inch of yeast in the bottom of the bottle. The flavor was better by leaving the last bit of yeast out, in my opinion. High ABV is masked, though, so be careful with this one."
"Pours a creamy colored off orange with white head that falls quickly. Smells of citrus, tangerines with hint of banana. Tastes sweet and fruity blend well with the malt and yeast then tartness appears along with little bubbles tantilizing your tounge finishes with touch of alcohol and spice to round out the experience.Mouthfeel starts medium heavy then carbination and alcohol lighten the feel as it goes down. Drinkability is good hardly notice the 9%. Interesting little beer not the best by Unibroue but good none the less."
"The only thing that could make me believe in God is the taste of this beer! Unibroue has done it again with this one. It starts off super sweet, then it shifts to tart, and as the carbonation seeps off in your mouth this deliscious fruit salad emerges. Extremely well balanced, this is not a beer to be missed."
"Drinkability: Very pleasing, although with its very strong alcohol content, this beer is better suited to quiet, contemplative sipping, rather than quaffing, simply excellent."
"Large bottle, with cork and cage. Poured light brown, honey in color and cloudy, Not much of an aroma and minimal lacing. Subtle flavors of spice, yeast, and some mustyness. Fruity flavors, creamcicle Ice cream comes to mind.This one was a tad dull for my tastes. I guess I prefer a BSPA with some more assertiveness and this one just seemed to be fairly understated. Anyway, its a worthwhile brew, tastefully crafted."
"Another great beer from one of my favorite brewers. Golden yellow with a full white head. Aroma is fruity and yeasty with a slightly musty note. Fruity flavor with orange, lemon, and other ripe fruits. Lots of malty goodness with a spicy hop and alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is just about perfect. I could drink this stuff all day, ABV is totally hidden."
"The bottom line: While often overshadowed by more well-known and more highly regarded Unibroue regular offerings, I think Don de Dieu easily stands up there with the best of them. Honestly though, Unibroue has to be the only brewery in North America where literally 4/5 of their mainstream lineup (excluding Blanche) is easily amongst the best in its class and hence, a regular rebuy for me. Easy to find. Always tasty. Up there with the real Belgians for about 1/2 the price. What more could you ask for?"
"Nice looking beer. Served pretty warm so no chill haze which is somethink I'm realizing lots of Unibroues have. The yeast is very sticky which is nice. Smell is quite nice. Some warm light caramel notes with just barely some spice and some sort of soft fruit. Flavor is nice too, but nothing like the Fin du monde. A bit of spice, peppery, but barely. A touch of caramel flavor as well, but again, barely. I also get a little bit of that gelatin flavor I tend to get now and again in light belgians...mainly tripels. The alcohol is quite warming. The mouthfell is nice...full but not fuller than a belgian should be. Ok drinkable, but the alcohol is pretty obvious which might get old."
"Another ""ho hum"" Unibroue."
"While this beer feels a little thin, the flavor is so 'big bodied' that you'll hardly notice."
"Beer is heavy and cloudy, like a thick green tea. Spiced orange and lemon smell, slightly giving off alcohol--intense. Taste is incredibly smooth for its high octane, sweet and mellow, tastes of citrus fruits. Hops follow later on. I could trink, I mean drink another 3 or 4 of these. It was gone before I knew it."
"Nice hazy golden color with a generous head whose departure pretty much carries most of the hop presence. Spicy and fruity aroma of lemon, pears, apples, mango, orange. The taste is cut in 2 parts, in mouth entrance, you assist to a sweet light fruity and very very yeasty beer, rapidly replaced by a tasteful bitter taste, somewhat a little tart. Very nice!"
"Pours a deep hazy yellow/orange with a great fluffy,sticky head.Aroma is very spicey and very lemony,taste is spicey and a little yeasty with a great citriusy taste in the finish the alcohol really comes thru as it warms.another great one from Unibroue as to be expected."
"Don de Dieu was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was lovely hazed rich apple juice yellow, with mega effervescent bubbling, topped with an ample rocky white head that left excellent lacing. The enticing nose spoke of spices such as bitter orange peel, coriander, and zippy lemon. Tasting the attractive brew revealed a moderately sweet honey malt base, infused with assertive flavors of dried apple, peach, and fresh bread. Flavors of apple and dried fruit persist nicely in the finish. However, the sweetness level remained too high at the end, and excessive apparent alcohol dimished from the overall enjoyment. The body was appropriately full and smoothly satisfying for the flavors, as was the ample carbonation. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the above flaws."
"I really like Unibroue brews. Their brews are just full of flavor that really stands out. So far, Don Dieu is one of their best offerings. It poured out a pale yellow/lemony color with some huge carbonation that settled down later on. Smell consists of some pears and apples mostly. Umm..some oranges too. Taste is just wonderful. Nice notes of citrus fruits and some hints of vanilla. Yummy! Going down it's so silky and smooth. 9%? It only warms your throat and tummy. Go get a few of these. Excellent brew."
"When I poured this, I was excited by the nice golden color. There was a moderate amount of head, which disappeared rather quickly. I didn't really like the smell, which was creamy. The taste was like the smell, creamy, with some spice as well. I did not find this to be a good combination, however, and had a hard time finishing the beer. The creaminess overwhelmed me, and I couldnt really taste anything else."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The mouthfeel was smooth while some tingling of the mouth took place while swallowing. The aftertaste was slightly dry and the yeast and citrus tones seem to linger. This is an exceptional beer."
"It has a strangely ice-creamy flavor, which is also reflected in the thick mouthfeel. There was no real wheaty-flavor, which I was looking forward to, and no real hop consistency either. There is also an overly vanilla flavor to this one. I had trouble finishing it."
"Beef Notes: Not a bad beer from Unibroue, but I probably will not buy it again simply because I would rather have three or four of their other beers instead."
"A decent brew, but not my favorite Unibroue. Cloudy yellow appearance with a decent head and light lacing. Smell was fruity with a hint of alcohol. Taste was strong on alcohol with slight fruity flavor. Mouthfeel full with a slightly chewy quality...not a strong finishing quality. Drinkability for high abv was fine."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is decent. It is full of begian pale malts and fruity yeast. It smells spicey and refreshing. The taste is good. It is fruity and full of Belgian pale malts. It has a banana flavor to it. This is a tasty beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks great. It has good flavor and an elevated abv. that is hardly noticable."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: This brew pours a slightly cloudy dark yellow color with a thick white head. Fair lacing. Sugary sweet malt and fruit in the nose. Medium body with a nice blend of malt, citrus (mostly lemon) and yeast flavors. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. The finish is fruity with a touch of malt. Pretty good overall."
"Clear, orange in color with a very thin head. Aroma is very tart, citric. The flavor is, well, umm, wow... very balanced. Citric flavor, with a bit of spice, over a smooth surprisingly mild, honey malty body. Bit of banana? Pepperiness is mild. This is a pretty nifty beer, albet a difficult to classify one."
"Awesome."
"Very crisp and spritzy finish. Good drinkability hampered by the ABV that seems less than it is."
" This one is certainly better at near room temperature, and has a wonderful finish. High abv is well concealed, and this is highly drinkable. Unibroue continues to impress."
"A cloudy orange pour with a moderate foamy white head. The head fades quite fast. The nose is slightly sweet with fruity hints and a big champagne yeast type smell. The taste start dry and bready. Some wheaty and yeasty notes. Slight caramel sweetness while the beer maintains its dryness. A very lively and full mouthfeel. Lively and fresh. The finish again, dry and crisp. Very drinkable."
"This beer poured out a cloudy golden color, was intensely carbonated and was topped with a small but creamy head of foam. A sweet fruity smell emanates from this beer with a strong emphasis on pineapple. Flavorful and candy sweet with a touch of tangy lemon bitterness. The alcohol is well hidden behind a wall of flavor. This is a very tasty brew. Fruity sweet, flavorful and strong, but not so heavy that would impede enjoyment."
"Nice litttle beer, much like some of Unibroue's other fare. Solid golden color with a few tiny bubbles, like a good little bottle refermented beer should. Smells crazy fruity, like the best Belgian ales always do. Goes down fairly light and smooth. A good little Belgian, and the 9% ABV comes as an almost complete shocker. One that definately needs to be tried."
"Very easy to drink, this could be a dangerous one"
"Clean and crisp, dry wine like in finish with great carbonation. Very drinkable, especially considering the 9.0% ABV"
"Light amber color with a 2 finger head. Hints of wheat smells from the glass. First taste that occured in my mind was a honey flavor and caramel. With a 9% abv, I was expecting to taste the alcohol, but it is hidden by the delicate flavor. I have yet to be disappointed with anything from Unibroue. I could only wish that all of Canada's breweries were of the same caliber."
"Bubbly from in-bottle fermenation; Triple filtered. Large white head. Pour in proper glass (see picture on bottle) and drink within a few minutes. Delicious, drink slowly with meal. 9% masked behind spices. Excellent substitute where you would use bubbly wine or scotch or rum."
"Poured a cloudy goldenrod color with whip cream head and very slow dissipation. Aroma is of citrus, wheat and alcohol.Taste was very sweet with more citrus and a wheat finish. Mouthfeel is wheaty and fluffy with a lightly dry finish. Although 9% alcohol, this rates high in the drinkability. Not my favorite of the line, but very good nonetheless, and probably one to use for introduction into the brand."
"Note: 10-08-08 This beer has an over the top yeast, bread or biscuit flavor. This is still a fine beer but not as pleasing as I originally indicated."
"Highly recommended!"
"Pours a cloudy hazy orange with a nice white head that fades to lace the top and sides for the rest of the show. Fruity alcohol, esters, and yeast on the nose. Taste is similar, big flavors of alcohol soaked fruits--apricots, raisins, and then the mouth numbing Unibroue yeast kicks in. Finally the finish is dry and alcoholic. Fantastic."
"I would like to compare the 12 oz bottle with a 750 ml bottle. This was the 12 oz. bottle. Amazing beer."
"Golden orange brew with a nice head that did not dissapate too quickly. Taste is very refreshing but too sweet for my own liking. The alcohol level is not detectable which is a good thing. This is not the best strong belgian ale from Unibroue. The sweetness is too present. Nice try anyway..."
"This beer is a slightly hazy straw colored yellow with slow flowing bubbles floating upwards from the bottom of the glass. A nice snow white head forms on the surface, but quickly fades to a collar around the beer. An aroma of honey, toasted malt, yeast and spicy clove hovers over the beer. Each sip of this medium bodied brew begins sweet with a nice honey flavor. Clove and toasted malt fill the middle and a slightly fruity alcohol flavor finishes each sip."
"The True North Strong And Free!"
"Smells slightly musty/ corky, as well as a bit honey-ish. There is a bit of spice in the nose as well which makes one think that there are spices in this one. Pours with a medium carbonation for a Belgian ale. I taste a bit of acidity along with a bit of cider flavor to it. Nicely fruity with a wonderful woodiness. I could not perceive any bitterness in this beer. One can taste the alcohol a bit in the finish, but this is in no way distracting. There is a subtle taste of unspecified spices. Very good beer, and very interesting flavors to it. It keeps you guessing with every sip, what new flavors will you find next."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle, it's a radiant gold with a craggy white head. The smell is a compelling mix of fruit, funky Belgian yeast, and pepper. The taste is just as intriguing. So much is going on, yet it has a surprisingly mellow flavor. This stuff is as smooth as the prom queen's thigh. It's 9% abv? I wish someone had told me that before I knocked out the entire bottle."
"Pours a light golden color with a large bubbly head that retreats to a small lace of tiny bubbles. Carbonation can be seen bubbling up from the bottom of the glass perpetuating the lace. The malt aroma with slight hops on the nose. Don de Dieu has a full mouthfeel with quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue. Theres a warming sensation from the alcohol, but its not out of control. Taste is mainly of malt and spices. Clove, and I think coriander was noticeable. Some banana and citrus notes were also perceptible. Theres a slight bitter finish that balances things out nicely. My first introduction to Unibroue, and a nice intro at that!"
"Thanks to hoprus for this one"
"Drinkability: Wonderfully potable. Does not feel like the 9% ABV this sucker packs. More rustic in character than La Fin du Monde, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I wish this beer was more readily available to me."
"Overall Impression: YUM! Drinkability is only impaired by the high alcohol, which is well disguised. Too many of these and you’ll start your sentences with “Hello, my name is ___ and I’m an alcoholic”. One big ole bottle is just enough. Find this beer, try it, share it with friends."
"Huge rocky Duvel like suds head pearched atop a pale opaque body with some floaties that were much darker than the beer itself. Looked excellent though. Huge dry raison notes abound in the nose with spritzy champagne characteristics and a spicy alcohol effect tingling my nose. Taste was crisp and dry with some sweet vanilla like malts, hints of oak and a little bit of pine creamy orange (much like a creamsicle) and a huge peppery alcohol warming in the taste. That alcohol abounds everywhere and is on the verge of overmatching everything, but it is roped in by that wonderful orange and oak. Carbonation was medium to agressive making it a good high alcohol beer to drink on a summer night. Man, Unibroue does Belgian Strong Pales so damn well. This is more characteristic and assertive than La Fin. Damn tasty!"
"Big time sipper with this one. The alcohol is masked wonderfully and really snuck up on me in a hurry. Overall it's not as smooth or as drinkable IMO as the other Unibroue brother/sister brews La Fin du Monde and Maudite. But still its a keeper."
"More hats off to Kluk. There once was a time when I could purchase this beer myself. But now I am a hostage in the Deseret land of scarce beer selection and high prices. Hazy pale orange with a large frothy white head. I followed Unibroue's airline evacuation instruction card style drawings to the hilt. Smell is peppery, spicy Unibroue yeast, cloves, sweet malts, and estery alcohol. Taste starts with spciy-sweet malts, bubblegum, banana, with a naturally bitter, warming finish. Pretty syrupy on the palate, and big! This truly is a gift from Dieu. Man, I really wish Unibroue would stop using so much wussy French on their bottles. Use a manly language like Euskadi or Mongolian."
"Pours a beautiful honey golden color with a champagne-like white head and some rings of lace. The fading aroma is mildly bread dough, cloves, yeast and a faint citrus whiff. The alcohol fuminess becomes more prominent as the glass warms. A hint of honey barely counters a very spicy, dry clove, coriander, orange zest and somewhat citrusy bitterness. A distinct banana flavor emerges, creating a nice mellowing effect. The complexities of this ale blend and meld, creating a big one-of-a-kind flavor and aroma sensation. I'll buy another and try it directly on its Best Before: 03/19/05."
"Comments  Talk about love it or hate it! The veteran John from Rochester fived this beer and two of our most venerated BAs, Rastaman & (the ever articulate) TheLongBeachBum, canned it (2 & 3, respectively). My overall rating is middle of the road but the individual scores reflect my confusion with this tasting."
"Gorgeous looking beer. Hazy and golden in color with a large white head that diminishes into a fine lace. Alcohol in spices in the aroma. The tast is more fruity with characteristics od a wheat beer. Lots of bananna and tropical fruit. A very light bodied beer that makes it highly drinkable dispite it's strength."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers. A PERFECT example of how a strong belgian pale ale (9%) can be so balanced and incredibly drinkable. I could drink this until the room started spinning."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability. Finished with a nice warming effect from the alcohol. It reminds me of an Allagash with a higher ABV kick to it. Aftertaste is dry, slightly bitter. This was quite easy to polish off."
"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is fruity, peach? Malty and fruity. Lots of flavors; yeasts, banana and cloves, vanilla?. It is quite carbonated and fizzy. Also so spice action as well. It hides the 9% alcohol well. A nice drinkable Belgian Strong Ale. Mouthfeel is soft and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a slight alcohol bite."
"This one poured a dark yellow color with very little head. The head dissapeared instantly but left nice lacing. Small bubbles quickly rose with a fury showing me this one was well carbonated. The aroma seemed a bit weak and left me wondering what this beer would taste like. It has a very strong alcholic flavor to it. Fruit accompanies the alcohol, not one certain fruit but rather a bunch of fruits mixed. The fruit flavor is very sweet. Bready malts create a dry feeling in it. Finishes with more alcohol flavor. I could see how someone might not like this, but I thought it was excellent. Improved the more I drank it."
"An above average to stellar brew all the way around. milky orange, yellow in color with a nice wheaty head. The nose is deep with roasted aromas dominating. These aromas follow through on the palate with an almost wine-like taste profile. Roasted red fruits, and an almost chianti-like taste intermingle with over-ripe banana and sweet bread dough flavors. A nice grainy wheat flavor is present throughout. Some subtle spice in the way of clove and vanilla are also in the mix. This is a big warming offering that is oh soooo drinkable and easy to like. A fine offering indeed!!"
"The beer is a somewhat cloudy straw yellow color, with a touch of haze to it. This is a fairly good copy of a Belgian Tripel. It has the same aroma & taste of banana that you would expect of this style. Not quite as good as Allagash, but still enjoyable. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: smoothness and wide variety of tastes plus a deceptive %ABV (wouldn't believe it's 9% if you didn't check the label) make this a dangerous beer to drink. High %ABV the only reason to lower this category from a ""5". Complexity and sheer volumn of tastes make Don de Dieu a real treat."
"Golden yellow in appearance and almost lemony at the edges. Hazy upon pouring but clears up. Average amount of bubbly white head that dissipates quickly but shows a tight cling on the side of the glass. Malty, honey-sweet smell with crispness and grains present as well. Taste starts out with an immediate crash of crisp carbonation (particularly in the back half of the mouth) and malty sweetness. A certain spiciness makes itself known, as the smooth but strong warmth gradually takes over. Particularly given the alcohol content, this is wonderfully smooth and drinkable."
"The first taste is sweet malt, honey, citrus fruit, spices like coriander. Medium body with bubbly carbonation that tickles the tongue. Wonderful beer, so far Unibroue can do no wrong."
"This ale on lees, which is a fancy term for bottled conditioned ale, has a wonderful spice kick to it that I just can't place. Maybe a touch more coriander or cardamon? It has a cloudy appearance, so I assume they use some wheat adjuncts as they do with some of their other beers. Then again perhaps that spicey kick is from rye? It had a nice foamy and a wonderfully silky mouthfeel. It went down well on a humid Saturday below the Mason-Dixon Line!"
"Not a session brew by any stretch, but always a good pick for a special occasion or when you want something a little 'extra' in your glass."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into my new Unibroue tulip glass. It pours a light orange color with 2 fingers of foam that are gone quickly. There is no lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of fruit, mostly a grape aroma. The smell is very sweet. The taste is also sweet. There is a bit of apple taste and some clove spice. There are a few hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is a little light and carbonated. The drinkability is fairly good, even at 9%."
"This beer is immaculate the appearance is an apricot toned body with a vibrant massive white head, with fine lacing layering my tulip shaped glass. The aroma of this fine constructed brew de Chambly is layered and complex with a nose of sharply sweet malted wheat, vinous fruit tones shimmering in the distance, along with a yeast sent from the heavens to form such a piece of work. Light alchol notes can also be detected in the flavor underneath all of this making it refreshing yet warming at the same time. Sweet apple butter tones with honey drizzled on it, with the spices added by Unibroue combine so well on my palate this beer is magnificant. I am enjoying this so much, this could very well be my favorite Unibroue beer to date simply amazing. A must try for any beer enthusiast, the full body allows this beer to be slowly enjoyed the way it should be, and the high carbonation let's the flavors travel so well along the palate. Very drinkable beer one to be yearned for, but a force to be reckoned with at 9% by volume."
"This Belgian Strong Ale poured a large invigorating white creamy head with fine-small bubbles. The body had a cloudy yellow appearance. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma was that of apples and grapes. There was yeast and carbonation observed with this brew. The taste was very smooth in my opinion."
"Very dissapointing pour and not what I've come to expect from Unibroue.Poured a quick fizzy white head that dissolved to nothing.Tons of bubbling carbonation.It looks like a glass of alka-seltzer with the bubbles rising from the bottom.Bottle left sediment at the bottom.The color looks lke a gold to yellow and a touch cloudy.Extremely crisp mouthfeel almost harsh on the finish.Alcohol seems to be well-hidden but I'm sure it will catch up to me soon.Feel a warming sensation in the stomach so the alcohol is kicking in.No real distinct aroma or tastes that stand out.Faint lingering bitterness in the throat but nothing too strong.A sweet light caramel malt aroma.Very dry finish probably due to the high ABV.Between the high alcohol and the extreme carbonation it makes the mouthfeel harsh and the drinker quick to swallow.I was not impressed with this offering from Unibroue and will not try it again."
"This brew poured a large head of fine white bubbles that leaves no lacing and a cloudy dark yellow body with a lot of dark brown particles floating in it. There were a lot more particles in the bottom of the bottle. It has a nice banana malt aroma about it. The flavor of this brew is complex with notes of butter, banana, spice and mild clove. It is a very smooth brrew that leaves a slight tingling mouthfeel in tits finish. The alcohol content is well hidden in the flavor."
"It's hazy yellow/orange with a damn huge whipped head. Tons of carbonation bubbles rise up. Very enjoyable aroma od sweetness and lemon/citrus zest. This is very smooth on the palate, with a strong twang throughout. Fruity notes and spicy notes are there in abundance. The finish is super dry and crisp. I can't believe how refreshing this beer seems to be for 9% ABV. The alcohol level of highness is non-existent until it warms to room temperature. Wonderful stuff from a brewery that never seems to go wrong."
"Unibroue tries and tries but I've yet to find them producing a truly outstanding beer."
"Medium gold body with slightly fizzy white head. Despite excessive carbonation, head stays relatively small (for style). The aroma is pleasantly yeasty and the flavor is nicely fruity with bananas and pears. Could use a little less carbonation however. For the lightness of the beer, it covers the 9% extremely well, although I did pick up a hint of alcohol (and an unfortunately medicinal quality) as the beer warmed in the finish."
"This beer is a very light yellow, almost white. You can see some sediment inside it. Thin, pure white head. A little lingers for the length of the beer. Decent lacing. Fantastic aroma! Smells of apples, some vanilla, some wheat. This is a very good tasting brew. Can still taste those apples. A little sweet at first, but it turns creamy at last. Some citrus flavors as well."
"This beer poured into the glass a milky lemon colored, that seemed to have a darker core that looked to be either burnt orange or brown in color. It was opaque but you could see carbonation bubbles present. The head was thick and rich, white in color and well lasting to mid glass then subsiding to a respectable top covering and ring as it sat on top of the brew. The lace that it left behind was watery in texture but very present. The aromas that seemed to come from the glass were of sweet malts, caramel, fruits, alcohol, spicy hops, roasted nuts, yeast and a small hint of coconut. Generally sweet in nature that I noticed. The flavors that jumped out at me and all over my tongue were pretty consistent with the nose. Flavors of caramels, sweet malts, warming alcohols, big fruits, roasted nuts, grapefruit, spicy hops, and yeast were all blended together nicely. This beer was medium bodied. All the complex flavors that were in this bottle seemed to match very well with each other and the high alcohol content that is produced. Nothing out did each other which makes this a top notch brew. Smooth, rich and BIG are three words that I would use to describe this beer. I liked it a lot and will keep a few bottles around for a special treat on special days."
"This is my favorite Unibroue product. I have not been unimpressed by any of their brews, and I would highly recommend this to anyone. Makes Westmalle, Duvel Red, Chimay White, and La Trappe look like ugly red-headed bastard stepchildren. On with the beatings!"
"Fruity, tangy, spicey. Pale head and light golden hue. I think this beer sums Unibroue up in a single bottle, though it may be a little more on the fruitier side. These crazy Canadians are on to something, and it's something we should pay close attention to. If you see a 750, buy it and drink it. It's refreshing and warming at the same time. You'll be tipsy and satisfied."
"Poured a very yellow with some gold, a good bubbly head, some steady tiny carbonation but not much, and good lace. Very nice stringy looking stain (like that). Nose was zingy yet full-bodied: wheat and sweet, quiet cloves, some hops (Styrian?) Scents were very clean, and in time some wine-like esters started popping up. The taste was a typical golden pale ale: light wheat and malt, lemony hops but not much, moderate in profile. I experienced a light honey taste developing around my tongue with time, as well as a wine-tasting burp. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, with little finish. Good beer, ain't no Duvel, though."
"Pours to a deep golden color with a creamy white head. Leave a good amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is sweet candi sugar, spicy, and medicinal. The Unibroue products seem to all smell the same. I need to try all the Unibroue beers together. It has a sweet, medicinal flavor; hay-like as well. It is full-bodied, smooth with a sweet finish. It has a strength that will sneak up on you."
"I've had more than one Duvel at a time, but cannot imagine having more than one of these. A very full, complex, and creamy beer. Wonderful, but really more of a cap to an evening."
"."
"A little too much like it's cousin La Fin Du Monde. I liked this beer but it had a little too much citrus and a little too much sweetness. This was more of a wine cooler than a beer. It had a larger head that dissapeared rather quickly, and an almost overpowering yeast smell. Heavy on the fruity taste with slight caramel and or honey overtone. I liked this but it doesn't go in my top ten. It is easy to drink however due to the sweetness and with it's 9% ABV one ight tend to go overboard and not know it."
"I may have a new favorite beer."
"This beer is a lot like Unibroue's excellent La Fin Du Monde, but with a bit more (too much) sweetness. Like all of the offerings from Unibroue, this one hides its considerable alcohol content very well and is a real pleasure to drink. A very good beer, but it is a bit too sweet to have more than one or two in a night."
"OK, call me crazy. I don't see anyone else in the reviews who picked up anything floral. That's my first reaction and I'll stick to it!"
"Pours a clear golden hue with a fluffy white head. An excellent beer. A good deal of yeast coupled with a peppery spiciness. Smooth as hell and really tasty. this is an excellent beer. Unibroue never ceases to amaze me two thumbs up for an excellent ale."
"A nice tingly carbonation starts you off right with crispness. The pale malts and wheat form a great balance with the fine yeast. Then, you get a little spicy flavor and a hit of alcohol in the end. The alcohol really comes through in the aftertaste. This was strange coming from Unibroue. They usually hide the alcohol and tone it down much more. It is still excellent, and I will surely have it again as it drinks well, and has a great feel to it. An all around champ as far as I am concerned."
"Overall, a very good beer. Another bottle fermented winner from Unibroue."
"The smell is Unibroue spicy with fruit. The front is Sweet with a capital Swee and spicy. The middle is apples. The finish is dry and just a little chalky. This one is sweeter than the others, but with all the strong flavors, it's not bad. I wonder if I could mix this with a Blanche de Chambly."
"Nice beer for a 100th review."
"12 oz. brown bottle with a gold foil covering the cap and part of the neck. As I uncapped the bottle I could already smell the wheat and yeast. Pours a cloudy golden color with a rising delicate white foamy head. Aroma has a strong fruity essence, yeast, cloves, banana and spice. The mouthfeel is crisp with a light carbonation. The taste consists of wheat, lemony citrus, banana, spice and cloves. The alcohol warms the back of the throat and you are reminded of the 9% abv. As the beer warms, the carbonation softens and Don de Dieu becomes even more enjoyable as the flavors reveal themselves even further at this stage."
"I bought the 12oz bottle, with the ship on the label. Poured a nice carbonated golden color. Slight sediment, more than I usually exspect from Unibroue. Nice taste, not a lot unlike Unibroue 11. Good fruity taste, but the ABV was not as hidden as I'm used too. Not Unibroue's best."
"Not bad, but not my favorite Unibroue beer."
"The stiff, dense, slowly settling tremendously thick porcelain white head tops a lightly hazy dark golden hued brew. Amorphous, sparse foam aggregates are left. Sweet, slightly acidic ripe tropical fruit notes including Guava and Kiwi hit the nose at first, then are ensued by mellow pearish and green apple tartness. Subtle hint of bready pilsner malt. Trace clove adds a slightly herbal component. Very appetizing aromawise. Flavorwise, juicy, fruity sweetness continues where the aroma left off, albeit with an herbal, more pronounced phenolic tinge. Impression of sugary jackfruit and clove, w/ a hint of citric tartness. Light must and cidery beet sugar notes emerge mid palate. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth mouthfeel partially aided by carbonation lower than the norm. Light hop bitterness leaves the fruit drenched residual sweetness mostly unhindered. Finishes with a grainy dryness, accompanied by a brief surge of orange peel like citrus and phenol. Don de Dieu is delicious strong w/ a pronounced moist, ripe tropical fruit character. Devoid of any ethanol harshness. It's reminescent of Tripel Karmeliet, although not quite as complex."
" Perfect with food,either a banquet or a picnic. A lot like a witbier, but with more body, flavor, and punch."
"(For whatever reason, the last couple of times I've had this, it hasn't appealed to me quite as much as before. I had it last night between a La Fin and a Duvel, and it wasn't quite as tasty as the other two. Still a great beer, but somehow, it has dropped a notch for me)."
"Wow. Quite an impressive brew. I could smell the spicy, fruity aroma the second I cracked the cap off. It smells absolutely wonderful. The appearance is a cloudy off-yellow with a thin white head that retains well. Mouthfeel is quite bubbly, almost champagne-like, and the flavors come flying out the moment you sip it. A bit of grassy spiciness follows the yeasty, fruity, nearly sweet beginning. One of the best Belgian strong pales I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Simply put, a delectable brew. And 9%? You'd never know it."
"This is my favorite Unibroue product so far. The appearance is golden with a white medium head and constant bubbles. The smell is of fruit, mostly white grapes and apple. The taste also includes these flavors with a heavy emphasis on apple. The mouthfeel is good with the flavor being emphasized by the carbonation (alot of bubbles in this brew). This is the smoothest and lightest 9.0 ABV I have tasted. Really good."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color and formed a bubbly white head. An aroma of citrus, yeasts and spices. Some carbonation is present. A flavor of spice with some bready elements. The finish is a touch tart and reflects some of the alcohol present. A good beer for this style."
"This is something I could get into drinking, very tasty!"
"Very cloudy golden with a frothy white head and a fair amount of visible flaky suspended particulate matter left over from the bottle refermentation. Sweet smelling, with aromas of apple and cotton candy. Active carbonation, crisp mouthfeel. Not as rich in flavor as I expected, with some orange, sour apple, and confectioner's sugar-type sweetness. Warming alcohol presence. A nice North American Belgian-style ale."
"Drinkability: Fairly high...for a 9% brew. I couldn't drink this all night, but it does go down easy for such a strong beer."
"Got this bad boy in the Unibroue variety case. I didn't like a single beer in the case upon my initial tasting until I found out they haven't gone bad, they're supposed to taste like that. After overcoming that hurdle, they began to grow on me. It's funny how fast unfamiliar styles of beer can grow on someone after they get taken to school. Thanks to the fellow BA's who helped me out. Don de Dieu is a very carbonated medium bodied Belgian style pale ale that tastes like an overripe bananna. I also detected some notes of other ripe fruit like pear and apple, but overall, the yeast character plays the leading role in this one. The finish is very dry. Although this is by no means a mediocre beer, it tastes like slightly watered down La Fin to me. If I could get this but not La Fin, I would definfitely go for this but La Fin is just so much better."

"This Belgian-Style Strong Ale poured a pale golden color. Aroma of yeast, hops and fruit with a hint of spices. Taste was very pleasant, although high in alcolhol, it didn't mask the true flavor of the Ale!"
"Not to say it is bad beer, far from it. It's just that there are better choices. 10, Maudite, and Fin de Monde are much better, and even the Quelque Chose (their cherry beer) at least tried to be different."
"This beer pours a pale golden color with a huge, bubbly head that retains very well. Smell is heavy on yeast, hops and fruit. The taste is somewhat sweet and a little tart with lingering notes of apple and apricot. Mouthfeel is fitting with a carbonated backbone that provides a very welcomed prickliness on the tongue. For a beer of 9% ABV, this is incredibly easy to drink and the presence of the alcohol is hard to detect. A true winner."
"This beer is very good.  It pours with a nice white head that fades quickly.  The body is a nice hazy yellow.  The aroma is complex and difficult to describe, as is the spicy flavor.  Fruity sweetness is balanced by a nice malt flavor.  The alcohol is detectable, but the beer still remains remarkably drinkable.  Definitely one of the better beers I've had the priveledge to enjoy."
"Very spicy beer, reminiscent of a German weiss.  Cloudy gold/orange and well carbonated.  Spicy/phenolic aroma and taste.  Quite drinkable for a high alcohol beer.  Solid beer, but it really doesn't do it for me."
"This is one wild and strong ale … Belgian style at that! This is one beer I don’t drink enough of and should."
"well,   it's a good beer.  that can certainly be said - the taste is pleasant but a bit too weak, and it fails to really mask the alcohol.  I like the colour, a pale cloudy gold, but the head was rather small (especially in comparison to other beers of the type).   It kind of fails to distinguish itself like fin du monde though."
"A beautiful beer in all regards.  A fruity, slightly yeasty nose, a very fine (almost champaign-like) carbonation that balances the heavy mouthfeel, leaving a light aftertaste of dried fruit (apricots).  I drank this while eating a mixed-fruit salad, and it just made the picnic perfect."
"Quite hazy, even in a long-stored and carefully poured bottle. Orange-marmalade in color and topped by a rocky, bright-white head that eventually drops to an exceptionally creamy 1/4"" covering and leaves excellent lace. The aroma is bold: quite yeasty, fruity (orange rind, dried apricot), citrusy, spicy. I keep looking for more but don't find it. The body is medium/light with a very fine, tiny bubbled and effervescent carbonation and gives a creamy texture in the mouth. The flavor is mouthfilling and extravagant, following the aroma's lead with orange, citrus, and clove atop a gentle malty sweetness awash in alcohol. It starts boldly sweet upfront, revealing soft spices as it warms, and finishes semi-dry with lingering notes of dried fruits. The spice eventually builds to leave a tingle on the tongue. Quite intense. Very enjoyable."
"Thanks go out to cokes for leaving me with this ""Gift from God."""
"Scores better than the La Fin Du Monde I just had.  This thing is a virtual fruit bowl of aromas and flavors.  Ripe peaches, bananas and spicy yeasties abound.  Slighty sweet start, finishes drier and slightly tart.  Wonderfully complex and flavorful."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a snow white head of 2 fingers.  It dissipates rather quickly into lumpy leftovers.  The smell is that of strong fruit and alcohol.  Of the fruity flavored beers that Unibroue puts out, this one is put together well.  At 9% alcohol, whew!...that's what I have to say about that.  It has a slightly sticky mouthfeel, but it's drinkability doesn't suffer IMHO!  A votre sante!....again and again ;-)"
"Pours with a monstrous pure white head, golden colored liquid with slight haze, very lively carbonation. Nose is spicy, reminiscent of Belgian witbier. Tastes great, with a nice fruity light and effervescent mouthfeel. Tropical fruit esters present, smooth going down, nice finish. Not a hint of the 9% alcohol contained within! A very decievable, yet very drinkable ale...be careful with this one."
"Cloudy, orangey appearance and fruity aroma. Sweet, fruity flavor hides some of the sharp phenols. A little too sweet for my tastes, but is good beer to have once in a while. I like the La Fin du Monde much better."
"Effervescent amber color, leaning toward the yellow rather than the orange.  Head settles to a skim after 30 seconds.  Slightly lemony sweetgrass smell, touch of candy.  Taste is dense but subdued, sweet malts, lemon rind, and very enforced by aroma.  Sense of alcohol warming in the back of the throat and in the stomach.  Powerful impact but only medium bodied.  Hops balance well in mid mouth.  A well-made brew, a little too heavy duty and toward the sweet lemon side to my tastes.  Prefer Maudite."
"This is one great beer. Nice creamy mouthfeel, tantalizing color and aroma. The more it warmed up, the better it tasted. One of my favorite brews from Unibroue, very complex in flavor. The alcohol is subtlely disguised, this beer can kick ass!"
"Horrible!!!!! Very sweet with too much alcohol shining through, gag, gag, gag. Horrible unbalanced and syrupy, one of Unibroues worst beers, no doubt, get Maudite or trois Pistoles instead, this is junk."
"69"
"First off, this is an oustanding beer. It is clear that the masters at Unibroue are true artisans. Golden yellow, slightly hazy, with a beautiful white foamy head that thins but stays through the glass. Smells of spices, sweet citrus (qumquats and orange), and fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is very round, as it seems to impact just about every tastebud. Carbonation is perfect - not too much, not too little. Slightly sweet, orange and rind taste, a touch of honey, with a pleasant alcohol finish. What a treat!"
"Another excellent Unibroue offering.  Very noticable yeast smell and taste.  Smooth and should be drunk slowly - very high ABV.  The U.S. importer in Unibrew USA."
"Caveat: I generally like to pour the yeast sediment directly into the glass to add to the flavor of most beers. DdD is the exception, I would recommend decanting this, as the yeast seems to ""muddy-up"" the spicyness of the beer. Either way, however, you are in for a treat."
"Wow........I had read a lot of the reviews for this brew and it certainly lived up to the expectations.  It pours a beautiful golden yellow with a nice frothy head that slowly dissipates to about 1/2 in. thick and then even more slowly goes to a nice retaining lace.  The smell is very fruity and complex.  Due to my winter long stuffed nose I wasn't able to fully interpret it.  The taste is...wonderful.  Creaminess dominates throughout with traces of fruit (bananas?), biscuits, and subtle spices.  It finishes very crisp.  Smooth creaminess is what the mouthfeel is all about with the perfect carbonation.  Not too intrusive but just enough to let you know it is there and to enhance the taste.  A very drinkable beer for its 9.0 % ABV.  Another amazing beer from Unibroue.  Currently my favorite of theirs, although, my favorite seems to be whatever is in my glass at the time."
"Not as complex as Unibroue's Dubbels and Tripels but an outstanding beer."
"Have one with the meal, then one for dessert, and it makes for the perfect warm, culinary experience.  Definitely a beer to be reckoned with."
"Cloudy golden color, medium head. Fruity sweet malty aroma. Sweet, malty, buttery, spicy citrus taste.   It's fairly effervescent with a spicy finish. Alcohol is well balanced. A pleasure to drink, down to the last drop."
"Notes: At 9% abv this beer is suprisingly light and refreshing. It's also one of the best beers that I've ever tasted."
"In my mind (?), this is not a strong Belgian golden ale a la Duvel, nor is it a tripel.  It's a pumped-up wit.  A very, very good pumped-up wit, mind you. This ale is to Blanche de Chambly (Unibroue's wit) as de Koninck Grand Cru is to regular de Koninck; i.e. a beer to be sipped and not guzzled.  I believe Hoegaarden has a Grand Cru version of their wit but I've never tried it.  I bet they're similar."
"Gratification in a bottle. Some of Unibroue's finest work."
"Wow.  Curiously fruity, in that I could not put a name to the fruit notes.  Apricot?  I let it warm a bit and almost dunked my nose in the beer trying to figure it out.  9% alc. was nicely balanced.  Would have rated it higher, but it got just a tad too sweet at the finish."
"I first got my hands on this brew back in '98 when it was available only in winter sampler packs. It's year round release proves me one thing, there is a god! A perfectly balanced 9% brew that can refresh you on the hottest of hot summer nights. Tasty!"
