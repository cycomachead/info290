4.62,9.7,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,"To start, La Chouffe is simply one of the tastiest looking Belgian ales.  The initial pour yields a big, inviting pure white head, and a hazy near-opaque caramel/orange body.  The smell is very nice - dry caramel, fruity Belgian esthers - although perhaps the aroma isn't as forthright on draught as it is out of the bottle.  The taste is magic though.  Full bodied with crisp carbonation and just enough hop bite.  It's really delicious and easy to drink.  One of my favorite beers of all time.  I sometime think of La Chouffe as a perfect foil to Duvel - a much softer, rounder, less-intense Belgian ale that nonetheless brings a perfect balance of flavor.  It's more playful and sweetly bodied than some Belgian ales, but definitely a serious contender.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of drinking it.","Duvel_Boston","Mar 05, 2015"

4.25,1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"one of the classics. i think this basically defines the genre of belgian strong pale ale. it has all the elements, and is one of the more balanced beers in this style thats out there. a little darker than golden, bright russet colored, with a tall white head that is vintage belgian. the nose is a showcase of this very dynamic yeast, as spice laden as it is fruity, and then bittering hops with a european grassiness. the flavor is quite similar, with a little grain sweetness on the front end before the yeast driven dry finish. carbonation is akin to champagne, and the beer is awfully drinkable and creamy for something thats 8% abv. very uncommon. i kind of always keep this beer in the back of my mind and internally compare all other belgian pales to it. very few stack up to la chouffe.","StonedTrippin","Dec 19, 2014"

Cloudy against the light with tiny hints of matter like clouds floating in the glass (this is a good thing) this beer is fairly typical in appearance for a Belgium blond although it may be cloudier than most I’m used to. To put it another way it is golden like an English sunrise over the Isle of Purbeck in mid-July with noticeable clouds that promise a very good day.  In some ways it resembles a wheat beer. . A cracking beer that I like very much!!","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 23, 2014"

3.89,-7.6,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"0.33L bottle poured into a bona fide Brasserie D'Achouffe glass at 1600 Bier Haus in Calgary. A light honey orange color just shy of reddish with a well-formed but quick-breaking creamy white head, this iconic Belgian "special" said to defy style guidelines smells like shortbread cookies, orange rind, and white pepper, along buttery sweet yeast and a vinous tannic note like champagne or boozy white grapes. Palate is similarly citric, fruity, and spicy, with a champagne-like undercurrent propping up some woody nectarine or apricot, pepper, fermented rank pineapple, coriander seed, and faint caramel popcorn, nice complexity but very dry and tart, almost an "imperial witbier" in character. Well-attenuated body adds to the drying effect, rather smooth and the carbonation and alcohol effects are decidedly mellow. I'd go here again although I prefer some other more funky brews. This one might appeal to the wine drinker closeted somewhere deep in us all.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 20, 2014"

Caramel or toffee dominates the aroma, perfectly complementing a similarly constituted flavor. Are there hints of fruit? Perhaps--of the full-bodied yellow variety, like ripe peach or mango; but maybe I'm influenced by the beer's color, which seems to deepen with the lowering of the angle of the sun. The texture is mostly silky, with just enough sparkle. If you're looking for something satisfyingly quaffable on the sweet side of the spectrum, you can't go wrong here.","Altrurian","Apr 02, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 15, 2014"

4.07,-3.3,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good and textbook example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale with pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style and nothing seemed out of place. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think the prickly carbonation would prevent me from drinking more than one of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and mouthfeel I thought they were both very nice and they were pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but the head retention and lacing were a little weak. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it's good, but it's a little pricey and for around the same price I can get Duvel which I like more than this beer. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style or Belgian beers in general. All in all i was satisfied with this beer, it wasn't the best of the style I have had, but I still thought it was good and I'll be on a look out for more beers from this brewery since this beer made for a good first impression, nice job guys, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Nov 14, 2013"

I wish it finished without any bitterness at all. This has a stout long lasting 8% alcohol effect on me. Feels more like 13% to me.

This was a great tasting beer that was herbal and spicy while being very well balanced and highly drinkable. This is their flagship beer and it was very tasty.

Its so drinkable that this could convert even non beer drinkers into avid beer snobs.

Aroma is fruity, yeasty and a bit woody, not strong but still appealing. Pours a nice clear bright solar yellow with a thick and fluffy, if none too persistent, white head. Flavor is better and stronger than what the aroma promised - fruity, malty, a little yeasty with a hint of butterscotch. Must be butterscotch. Texture is firm-bodied and a little syrupy; fizz is not strong but lasts, leaving a nice, fruity, tingly, slightly sweet finish. Worth ten bucks for 750 ml? Definitely.","Cyberkedi","Sep 02, 2012"

The nose comprises heavy Belgian yeast, light white bread, clove, a pinch of black pepper, light lemon peel, a hint of banana peel, and a touch of flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with that heavy yeast character really coming to the fore. This isn't to say that the spices take a full backseat, but they are definitely subservient to the yeast. Lesser beers would suffer from this situation, but this yeast works well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice BSPA, not quite up there with Duvel and the other standard-bearers, but it comes pretty dern close.","TMoney2591","Nov 14, 2011"

Tastes sharp and a little bit sweet up front, then slightly grainy, and quite spicy on the finish.

With all the pepper, one would think this beer unpleasant, but it surprisingly works. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, reminding me a bit of champagne.

Nose is very clean - grain, apple cider, hint of some sort of spice, white grape, and bubblegum. Taste is surprisingly big on bready malt, along with a good dose of spice and belgian yeast. Not as fruity/citrusy as expected. There is an iron-like metallic tinge that lingers throughout. Finish is slightly sweet but still pretty crisp. Medium-bodied, effervescent. Overall, I enjoyed it, but the lingering somewhat metallic taste distracted me, and will probably prevent me from picking up anymore of this, especially since other solid representations of the same style (i.e. Duvel) are much cheaper in the province.","MattyV","Dec 03, 2010"

There is a hint of alcohol in the finish. It's spiced to perfection. It has a heavier body than I expected, and a plenty of carbonation. It's a bit strong, but very good to drink.

The first flavours that hit you are malty, with lots of grainy cereal, this is followed by a nice warming alcohol feel, which lasts throughout. There is a definite taste of spice, hints of pepper and a gentle sweet sugar. It is definitely on the heavy side and the carbonation is huge in the mouth.

Fruity, spicy and malty on the palate, with a subtle, but near perfect hop bite at the end. More yeast, some sweetness (perhaps butterscotch) and a squirt of lemon finish it all up.

Ok, enough with that, it's just a damned good Belgian farm-ale. The wonderful 1pt 9.4oz bottle pours a hazy gold with bright white fluffy head & sticky lace. The aroma is a hearty spiced yeast that comes trough with sipping and stays in the nose. Hints of lemon & pepper come through as well in this highly refreshing ale.

Ripe sweet fruit (see smell description) with some yeast, bread, dry malt and grassy hops. Touch of spice as well (but I couldnt tell you what exact ones).

Poured an orange-gold with lost of yeast and bubbles floating in solution. Two inch bright white foamy head sizzled and popped as it slowly collapsed into a solid half inch cap. Some spotty lacing, but weak legs. Nose is lemon zest, yeast and grassy. Flavors consisted of pale malt, some citrus, yeast and muted spices. Detected some ligth fruit as it warmed (maybe pear).

This beer is very smooth with amazing drinkability. A bit light but the flavors blend nicely. Sweet malts, yeast, semi-tart fruits, with a floral hop character. Perhaps a bit fragrant. Again, at first it all seems a little light but the further I worked through the beer the more I appreciated it's delicate nature. Very nice.","changeup45","Aug 28, 2008"
4.18,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This one is on the lighter side for body and finishes semi-dry. Low levels of delicate carbonation that quickly fade and leave the palate. Alcohol isn't hidden all that well, however its presence enhances the overall experience when drinking this beer. Its warmth adds to the feel and semi-dryness of the palate, its taste helps to balance out and add complexity to the overall flavor.... This is one I'll drink again, one I'll buy again, and one I'll recommend to people. Overall quite a nice beer. In my opinion its almost a mix of Tripel-the dominant spicy notes mixed with a Belgian Strong Pale-the sweeter notes. This isn't one I'd look to for either as a definition of a style, but it is quite good. Give it a try.","becktone","Aug 27, 2008"

Smell is full of fruity goodness, some apple, some lemon, faint peach, lots of pepper and spice notes. Very delicate balance of flavors here, plenty of the apple coming through, a refreshing peppery zing, tartness aplenty. Excellent mouthfeel, really active little bubbles, super-refreshing...this could be a very unexpected summertime treat. This is something I'll be drinking plenty of in the future...fantastic Belgian beer.","corey0212","Aug 15, 2008"

The aroma is quite good....lots of floral qualities. Flowers and light pale malt. A touch of hops, black pepper (honestly), subtle spice, and yeast...the aroma provides the framework for this brew. The taste is moderately sweet and full of spice. Nice alcohol warming. Moderate carbonation and a little hop bitterness in the back. The beer has a terrific lingering aftertaste. Although it's not as flavor-forward as a lot of great Belgians, this beer is engaging and very enjoyable. The peppery aspect is very enjoyable. Certainly worth having again.","Suds","Jul 05, 2008"

The aroma is big with pale Beglian malt/yeast, corriander, tart apple, juicyfruit. Closer to the Wit side of the Belgian world. The taste is of pale malt, slight Belgian yeast spiciness, subtle corriander, a touch of sweetness from the candi sugar, a touch of pepper/earthiness and a hint of tropical fruit. Not big bold BSPA flavors but clean and well balanced. The feel is fairly light and fizzy carbonation, though not overly carbonated; finishes slightly sweet but balanced.

4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"hazy pale orange, ok retention. Smells sweet, citrusy, coriander. Coriander definitely present in the taste, though not overbearing. Citrusy smell becomes more of an orange-lemon tangy bitterness, most likely imparted by the hops. Good use of hops - sweetness nicely balanced out. The overall zestiness is really reminiscent of a wit beer. Combined alcohol, hops, and high carbonation makes the liquid dance in my mouth. I wouldn't say the 8% is totally unexpected but like many well made belgian ales, it really doesn't hurt the drinkability. Recommended.","redmagik99","May 17, 2008"

It had a delicious appearance in the glass, with a hazy gold color and a frothy head. It also had hints of spiciness - clove and pepper with a light hoppiness to the finish.

The flavor is sweet with more of the light yeasty esters. I don't quite taste any spices, but I think thats probably evidence of good light spicing, it's there but not dominant. This is a very good beer, but it's unfortunate that it comes in a green bottle, as I'm sure this contributed to the skunked off-flavors.","ericj551","Mar 09, 2008"

Some nice spices like clove and nutmeg really balance this out. Light mouthfeel, crisp and clean, with a great carbonation level. I think this beer is outstanding.

Pours a wonderful golden color with decent foamy head... serious carbonation is visible behind a grainy, straw-colored hue... Teriffic ripe-fruit smell, with a crisp, fresh, light, aroma... taste was full of grapefruit, bananas, sweet candy, with a clear, crisp flavor full of yeast... the 8% ABV is not detected behind a rich conglomeration of fruit-filled flavors that dance on the tongue... amazing, rich, tasty mouthfeel with ultra-easy drinkability that goes down crisp, clear, clean, and smooth... no trouble drinking this one... a world-class brew...

Lots of fruit flavoring, some apple and citrus, along with some honey, also some coriander and some peppery spice. However the fruity flavoring is soon subdued by a dry hoppiness and soft alcohol glow. Mouthfeel is fizzy, reminding me a little of a Duvel, but full and coating.

There is a lovely use of spices here, from coriander to whatever this yeast is giving off, in addition to the spices from hops through the beginning and end.

This is an amazingly smooth and balanced Belgian. Both the nose and the taste give an initial hint of astringency, followed by a mild candy sugar and fruit taste. Some of the Belgian beers I have tried have a bolder first taste but would not stand up well over the long haul. This would be a great Belgian "starter" beer. There is no overwhelming astringency or sweetness that could get annoying over the long haul. La Chouffe features a rich mouthfeel, very balanced sweetness / astringency and no alcohol taste. Drinkability would be based on how wasted you wanted to get. The flavor would stand up fine to a long, slow disciplined session.","JayQue","Aug 15, 2007"

Aromas release a juicy, mouthwatering plethera of ripe fruits, sweet malts, bold esters, tartness, and a splash of honey. The flavors are most bold with fruit flavors of peaches, pears, banannas, apples, lemons, appricots, mangos... Bold sweet malts swirl around the fruits and lend a full, rich cotton candy and bubblegum softness. Back-up notes of clove, corriander, curraco, ginger, and nutmeg gives a ton of variety to the brew.

Maybe a bit of coriander, a touch of honey, an ever so slight vanilla note, and just a touch of bitterness. It's impressive because it is so well crafted. Most beers impress by bullying your taste buds; this is subtle. The pinnacle of balanced flavors. Mouthfeel is also top notch. Very light, very quaffable for 8% ABV.

It had a nice thick white head that lasted throughout with little lacing. Also, to note, lots of yeast deposits in the bottom of the bottle and which some made to the glass, so it was a little cloudy with all the deposits floating around. The aromas were delightful, smelled delicious, very fruity. It is a smooth ale with hints of spice, fruity taste, yet even with the high ABV it is unnoticed till it hits ya and you have to check go BA what the ABV is!

It started out with a nice white head that faded a little too quickly but was beautiful none the less. It smelled of pears and pepper, along with other fuits and spice I couldn't quite pin down. It was very intriguing and begged me to dive in. It tasted of the same, with some malty sweetness and a dry, spicy finish. Again, more generic spice and fruit that i unfortunately can't nail down more specifically. The mouthfeel was simultaneously light and creamy. Active carbonation added to the dry perception and made it a very lively drink.

Sweet malt, grassy hops, a touch of Belgian yeast, and light aromatic herbs. Light body holds the flavor well enough, but becomes a bit foamy.

There is a taste of apples and coriander at the start, and the first few sips have a hoppy "rust" taste to them, which recedes as you polish of the pint and a half. This has a bitterness which is not unwelcomed. The bottle says "spiced" and certainly this does not mean nutmeg, cinnamon or clove. There is a floral nose with a definite citrus and lemony quality. There is some great drinkability, and even though it is not as creamy as Duvel or delirium tremens, for instance, it has a peppery spice. that makes it a beer to return to bottle after bottle.","andjusticeforale","Jul 06, 2005"

Not as much as I'd expect from the visuals and nose. Certainly complex and good tasting but nothing outstanding (at least in the bottle form).

As I worked my way through the bottle (and it warmed), the beer's complexity came through, the sweetness receded and the spices sorted themselves out, with coriander and orange peel taking the lead.

Bought with the Chouffe gift pack, so of course I poured it into the accompanying La Chouffe stemware. A deep hazy gold in colour, quite brilliant in its lustre for a hazed beer, with a massive sponge-like head that maintains impressive retention, I almost need a shovel to make a path through it to the actual beer. There is a very mild aroma, but it seems to draw me in with every inhale, a lot of complexity to something so subtle. Lemon and tangerine zest, bubblegum esters, fresh grass, and then the spices: coriander, black pepper, some nutmeg, and even cinnamon to my surprise. The flavour is light and refreshing, the mouthfeel is effervescent. This is quite an uplifting beer, I'm sampling this after an unsavory day at work, and it has completely managed to perk me up. Light grains and yeast at first, with a quick appearance of orange sweetness in the middle, then gaining some bulk on the finish with the spices, first coriander and cloves, with black pepper lingering on the aftertaste. I really didn't know what to expect with this, as the McChouffe didn't impress me much. I've certainly been missing out this past while in this case. As inexplicably annoying as I find gnomes, I can easily overlook that personal bias when it comes to La Chouffe, I'll definitely be picking more up, I can't remember the last time a new beer cheered me up so much.","IronDjinn","Jan 26, 2005"

I think this would be nice to marinade some chicken. The flavor was nice sweet lemon that finished peppery and spicey and refreshing. The feel was moderate with a nice creamy texture.

Cloudy despite being vertically stored in my cellar for 2 weeks, and poured without disturbing the lees. Interesting. Honeyed, wheat, orange browns, with a whipped cream white head, tight and small bubbled. Screen lacing that ever so slowly dissipates. Tiny bits of sediment are visible in the beer. Wow, another incredible aroma from Chouffe. Mild but extremely appetising fruits up front, clean fresh bread, baked sweet cinnamon rolls, definite cinnamon itself, spicy herbs, some metallic notes once it has warmed a little, sweet icing sugar, a cranberry or pomegranate seed tartness. Some detergent soapiness, and clove. Taste is not strong at all, but extremely flavourful. Lightly roasted malt in the front, faint smoked hints. In the middle are some wheat notes, and also some coriander, similar to a good wit. Some orange marmalade in the finish, and grapefruit; this is by far one of the most complex beers for fruit flavours. Definite orange flavours, and even a hint of lemon peel. Only faintly could I detect the alcohol in the taste, but in the feel it is most definitely there--warming and smooth. The aftertaste is mainly sweet and phenolic, hops only peeking their heads through on the sides of the tongue, and balancing this beer so it is not overly sweet. Their role here is balance, not flavour. The mouthfeel is exceptional, cream-filled, foamy and medium-bodied. This is one 8% brew I could drink quite happily through an entire night, without it becoming too overpowering. Undeniable drinkability marks. This would pair splendidly with a dry cheese, or aged cheddar. Nuts of all sorts would accompany this nicely as well.","Cwrw","Dec 10, 2004"

Coriander and orange peel seem to come in and mix well with the malts. The yeast is interesting and seems to be more flavorful the more I drink it. Finish is light, dry, and semi-fruity. Not a real sweet beer but not real dry either, this one has a good balance. Flavors are delicate but work nicely. I've drank this beer twice and both times I get a flavor that I can't put my finger on and I think its from the yeast strain.

The level of spiciness in this beer that I can't even begin to discern the varied flavors -- orange peel, peach, lemon, coriander, cinnamon, yeast... They form a sort of Belgian beer yogurt with this beer's creamy mouthfeel. There's a lot going on here. Maybe too much so -- but there's no hint of the 8% anywhere to be found.

Taste is nicely balanced. A little hoppy bite balances out the clove-like spiciness of this beer. Alcohol is hardly detectable. Finishes slightly sweet as well.

The taste is dry up front with a slight bit of clean acidity. There is a nice clean spiciness and an accompanying bitterness in the finish which really sets this beer off. The herbal character is in the taste as well, which perhaps contributes a bit of astringency, and there is a certain lemon like character here as well. As this beer warms up it develops a certain sweetness and a hint of vanilla up front. It has a very simple, clean malt character, from the Pilsner malt, that contributes just a hint of maltiness that reminds me of lightly toasted biscuits. This is a really nice beer, it is quite clean, and could perhaps use a bit of complexity, but the hopping levels, malt, and yeast character create a beautiful balance that works very well.

I get a slightly hazy golden color with a soft fluffy white head. Aroma is good and spicy with some cloves and coriander dominating. No real hop presence. First sip reveals a very light bodied brew with almost no carbonation. Flavor is crisp and refreshing, with citrus notes and very easy to drink. No hop bitterness present in the flavor either. No hints of alcohol anywhere to be found. This is quite a tasty brew that would be very enjoyable on a hot summer day.","sulldaddy","Apr 11, 2004"

I guess that's better than a pint glass, but I'd still like a true tulip for appearance's / smell's sake. This beer is a nice golden, with a frothy inch head of white lace. The smell is very fruity, lemon, with a prickle of hops and spice. The taste was quite good also. The malts are there, in a small way as this beer feels very light on the palate. I could tell there was some alcohol in it, but without remembering I would not have said 8% abv. Clean and very nicely balanced. There is a good interplay of clove and corriander with the hops which really show themselves on tap. I think that from the bottle, the beer has more of a esteric sweetness whereas fresh on tap the beer asserts itself with more pronouced spices and hopfeel. I thought this was quite refreshing and very drinkable. Price sort of hurts, but that shouldn't stop you if you find it on tap. Well worth it, at least for one. Great !","99bottles","Apr 05, 2004"

The aromas are all about the fresh floral smells, and zesty hops. The taste is floral, fresh, hoppy, and zesty and spicy as well. In fact this reminds me of a saison, more than a belgian strong pale ale. This is actually more refreshing, zestier, and spicier on tap. The mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and the drinkability is very good.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth with a nice crispness to the finish. Overall, I'm used to a lot more flavor from a belgian strong pale ale, but this was actually a nice change.

3.87,-8.1,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"La Chouffe, in my opinion, would be a good late spring beer. Poured a nice thick head and it look like it's going to have a nice full body taste to it. Lots of floating yeast in this thing. Smell consists of citrus and some spiciness along with it. Taste is quite good. Some spiciness in there, then some apricot/peach/honey kicks in, quite good. You can taste and feel the alcohol in this thing but you can't feel the whole 8.0% on it. It poured a full body but it tasted like it was a medium body beer. I don't know, maybe it's me but it's missing a little something in there. But nevertheless, it's a good, decent brew. But if you're looking for a belgian ale, go to Duvel instead. But I would recommend this beer.","necoadam","Jan 13, 2004"
4.35,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Update 4/14/14: Nice four packs for affordable prices with short stubby bottles make this one more approachable nowadays, nice to see it's being imported into the states into Ommegang/Duvel Moortgat in Cooperstown, NY. Pours slightly hazed honey golden body with a bright effervescent white head, fine Belgian lace forms on the sides of my glass. Aroma spicy yeast, cereal grains medicinal at times but not overly boozed up. This seems to be in higher production than back in 2004 when I first reviewed it and back in 2001 when I enjoyed it at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto, Canada on tap for the first time. My love affair with Belgian ale is still intact but nothing like it was when I first got into beer, to me a lot of their beers tend to have a lot of sweetness compared to American crafts that I enjoyed more 10 to 13 years ago. Now I'm a full fledged hophead that can still respect one of the beers that really helped get me hooked. The cereal grains come across on the palate with loads of coriander and other spices, black pepper, a hint of pear, a bit of alcohol comes through with the 8% abv, very balanced and well appreciated for what it is. If you need more hops just grab an Houblon Chouffe instead of La Chouffe you'll be glad you did. Tomahawk, Amarillo, there's one other variety of American high alpha acid hops that they use in that brew. Mouthfeel is effervescent the carbonation is a bit much for me but I can still appreciate the flavors it carries along some of the residual sugars left behind in fermentation much better with the higher carbonation. Overall I'm still a fan boy of beer in general and can appreciate pretty much any style, but La Chouffe was a beer that I held in high regards because of the enjoyment and experiences with friends I had when I found this on a weekend trip into Canada with some college dorm mates back in early 2000s.","WVbeergeek","Jan 10, 2004"

Color ranges from near-coppery at center to honeyish at edges of glass; all very hazy. Good carbonation with a few vigorous streamers. Aroma is super smooth, with golden lemon rinds; champagney in middle; hay and lemon pulp; the typical Saaz hoppiness; with the imagination running wild I find pine, butter, marijuana... Flavor? Just great. Light bready yeast, big coriander and a nice hop tingle suggesting rosemary or even bay(?); lots more lemon zest. At cooler temperatures, champagne flavors abound; with warmth, mandarin orange emerges in the front palate that melds wonderfully into a green apple tartness. Complex! Mouthfeel is so nice and smooth: slightly tingly and full; soft alcoholic foam; great lip-smacky tart goes to creamy and then swings back to dry. Oh so nice. Drinkability: 4.5, there you go.

The look is great with its lovely honey color and full, rich head and lacing. The nose is great giving off lovely aromas of citrus fruit, spice, and malt. This complexity follows in the flavor which simultaneously gives citrus fruit, spice, pepper and malt caramel sweetness with a tart overlay. The feel is light for such a full body owing to the lovely carbonation balanced by the creamy body. Dangerously drinkable given the ABV.","AtLagerHeads","Oct 26, 2003"

The nose is very inviting with whiffs of pears and apples, pepper and alcohol, kind of tart, a solid does of hops too (Saaz I believe). Good potency. The taste on this ale is divine! So mellow, so complex, so engaging the carbonation is much lower than many of its brothers, this only embellishes the flavor profile. The malt is so well developed it almost steals the show, it provides a distant but solid stage to let the hops dance allover it, pleasantly spicy, tart, mildly bitter in spots, some suggestions of a Wit... oh, what a palate! Sharp, acidic finish. Soft, medium body. 8% abv? Bullshit I could not taste a hint of alcohol, very well hidden.

Cleanses the palate, and left traces of fruit flavors, maybe peaches or apricots. Hints of honey, and cinnamon as well. Nice floral tone, and a very light earthy yeast quality to it. Very drinkable at 8%. Great summer beer, IMO. Would be great with a grilled chicken ceasar salad or something like that.

The beer was very warming and pleasurable to drink, with an underlying spiceiness adding to the complexity.

Aroma is of bavarian wheat cloves and mild banana esters, tart applejuice, and while I don't smell lemons, there certainly is an acidic tartness in the aroma. Mouthfeel is crisp and explodes on the tongue with a light body. Taste starts with a dry, grainy, non-hop bitterness, fades into a strong, yet clean alcohol peppery bite, a here-then-gone pale malt background, and ends in a very dry, astringent fruitiness with very subtle fusels and some bready yeastiness. No sourness or Belgian Funk noted. Throw in some Pediococcus and Brett and they have a great beer, but as is, it just doesn't do much for me.

4.75,12.8,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Light amber / dark golden in hue w/ good clarity for style.  Prodigious production of bubbles support the thick, persistent, mountainous, ivory - white head which resembles a topographic map.  The aroma is a balanced combination of honey, ripe tropical fruit sweetness and tarter, slightly underripe pear notes.  Green apple acetaldehyde is mellow and well integrated into the aroma, and complements the tart fruit nicely.  Flavorwise this brew exhibits a fine balance of sweet fruity esters, lightly peppery alcohol, and tart, slightly bitter citrus rind.  Is there Curacao in this brew?  Hop bitterness is mild, yet counters residual sugars enough to completely prevent and cloying sweetness.  Refined bready malt and hints of Coriander become noticeable as the beer warms.  Spot on bodywise, but with a carbonation lower than the norm for style that aids in drinkability.  Finishes a touch sweet, w/ soothing alcohol warmth emerging as an afterthought.  La Chouffe is one of the very best Belgian Strongs I've tasted.  The combination of spices and yeast esters result in an absolutely delicious brew.  The relatively high strength is superbly hidden; the drinkabilty of this fine brew is top notch.","marc77","Aug 22, 2002"
4.52,7.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Puffy and turbulent head, liquid is orange/amber with frosted impenetrability from yeast. Aroma is divine, and impossible to describe; suffice to say it's like, if God was a plant, and this plant was bearing its very first flower. Oh, and the plant was fertilized with alcohol. I would be happy just smelling this beer all night, but that would be downright nutty. Fruits, spices, and warm alcoholic burn in the taste. Other reviews have got some great flavor descriptions. It's the finish that kills me; orange, buttery malts, and a slight dry twang. The spectacular aftertaste goes on forever. This beer would be equally welcome on the Christmas dinner table as on a picnic blanket during a sweltering Sunday afternoon in the park. In a word, great.","Thrasher","Aug 08, 2002"
4.67,10.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy orangey gold color with a creamy white head that leaves a terrific lace.  Spicy nose, lots of peppery and coriander smells in there as well as about 10 other spices I can't even identify.  Slight bubble gum smells as well.  Sweet candy sugar jumps on the tongue at first and dances around with some juicy fruit flavors.  Grapes, apples, and some mixed citrus flavors are all in there.  Faint hops emerge to give the brew a grassy/hayish quality to it for a short while before the spices take over.  More pepper and some light coriander and again there are several spices I can't even pick up on.  No alcohol is even perceived on the tongue, only the brain notices it.  Creamy and somehow not sticky mouthfeel makes this brew an absolute joy to drink.  Damn, those little gnomes know how to brew some beer.  This is one awesome concoction here.","Murph","Jul 25, 2002"
4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"I'd probably suggest this as a beer to train oneself on the spicy yeast so common in Belgian beers. The spicey yeast flavor is present in this beer, but not so overwhelmingly so that it would scare off someone unfamiliar with the flavor. Huge carbonation and a big white foamy head top of a nice golden body. The aromas of peppers and peaches dominate and when you take a sip you notice a little lemon mixed in. The alcohol does poke it's head up, but it's not too noticeable. A very good, light beer that's very easy to drink.","aracauna","Jun 06, 2002"
4.47,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cloudy golden colour with a thick and creamy white lace. Light bodied and very effervescent that is close to a champagne-like mouth feel. Dry pale malt character with a complex spiciness of clove, cinnamon, black pepper and a light hoppy presence. Burst of peachy fruitiness in the middle that awakes the taste buds from more. Lovely in the bottle but even better on tap.","Jason","May 14, 2002"
4.4,4.5,4,4,5,4,4,"Hazy golden brown.  Charged head, bubbles settle out in about 40 seconds or so.  Spicy smell.  Understated but pleasant malt flavors, bit of cinamon and a touch of phenol.  Hop mix of Saaz and Goldings is a first rate balancer in this beer.  Not at all sticky or alcoholic in taste... very drinkable to me.  No sourness.  Low carbonation in the mouthfeel.  Skoal on this one!","ADR","May 07, 2002"

4.65,10.5,4,4,5,4.5,5,"thick white foam cresting on a cloudy golden beer, poured into my delirium tulip glass. excellent head retention, and a beautiful smell of coriander and noble hops, with a faint air of alcohol. Crisp in body and definately crisp in taste, heavy yeasty character that is soon shot down by the strong saaz hop character, leaving a pleasant aftertaste of spice and pepper. Already almost finished the whole 25 ounces while writing this... wonderful beer.","hooligan","Feb 12, 2002"
