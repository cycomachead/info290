"This is an interesting brew that calls itself a honey ale. Nice taste of citrus and spice, too, with a great mouthfeel and a nice tight medium head. Kind of expensive for me to drink it all the time, but I like it about as well as anything available right now."

"Not really doing it for me or drawing me back to it.  I had this since first writing this review though, and think really a worth while beer to try.  Would be good as an appertif, by itself, or with tomato based pastas.  Cool labeling with a long haired warrior."

"Being from Canada, the very idea of honey ale does not inspire a whole lot of hope on my beer radar when I am presented with an example of such. Leave it to some old-world brewing goodness to break me out of that bit of reverie - this one performs said charitable act with aplomb. Honey? Yes, up the wazoo - but moderated, by grain, yeast, hop, and yes, alcohol alike, to provide us with a crazily workable, and drinkable end result."

"O: A pretty good beer overall. I would drink this again if the price was right but not really something I would hunt down."

"Surprising to have this on tap at Mission Pizza great mellow family blue grass pizza pub in Fremont CA, and I ordered a pint after a taste, the bartender not knowing where it came from, so I figured it must be a new brewery in CA. Wrong and feeling ignorant. I just really like the subtle honey undertone of this. Surprisingly strong for the mellowness of it. Very golden and lovely as I sit at table on sidewalk as the sundry to the west. Aaaaah, California, but this is Belgium in a suburban East Bay buzz, and it feels and tastes so right!"
""
"The taste is a nice honey flavor with the fruity yeast character giving the beer a Belgian taste with fruit, light solvent and some clove, peach and lychees. The malt taste is a little thin but for a blonde beer this is ok, the mouthfeel is a little thin."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small jelly-like clumps of sediment are seen floating around in the glass after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and grape-like fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Price Point - $4.59/11.2 oz bottle"
""
"Poured in a small Struise chalice the beers looks quit nice, yellow colour fluid with a nice white head. Nice lacing. This beer has some very light sour notes in it. Smell like a saison. Not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"330 ml. bottle. Hazy golden colour, two fingers head with bubbles, not lasting much, lace around the borders. Smell of honay, of course, but also coriander, oranges and spices. Medium body, crispy and normal carnation. Taste of honey, chocolate, orange and spices, alcohol, like a brandy but sweet. Fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer, it brought some memories back too with its fantastic taste. Highly recommended."
"O- The big intense orange flavor is a bit to intense and it hides some of the malt and yeast flavors. It takes on a slight jolly rancher intensity with the coriander also dominating aswell. They are some nice flavors just need to turn them down a bit, or bring up some malt flavors to balance them."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Served in the original Barbar glass. Thick white head that lasts very well. The beer is amber brown. Aroma: clear honey presence but also yeast and fruits are detected. Complex and sweet aroma. The taste is very well balanced and not too sweet as one might expect from a honey ale. Long finish. Barbar is one of the best, if not the best honey ale you can get."

"O: A very special, unique beer. Unusual but quite appealing fruitiness."

"Overall: Nice belgian beer. Honey was not overpowering."
""
""
""
"never in a million years could one guess this was 8% abv by smelling or tasting it. it pours a very light sandy yellow color with a tall belgian style white head and a mild haze. smells like fresh floral clover honey and belgian yeast. this is a very bright beer, light in flavor but complex. honey flavor but not sweetness, pollen, wheat malt, and a gentle peppery quality are all present here in the flavor. mouthfeel is prime, light and crisp, infinitely drinkable, with fine carbonation and a miraculously satisfying finish. this is a great bottle of beer, and one i very much look forward to trying again. the honey is as well balanced yet prominent in this beer as in any beer ive tasted. bravo!"
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with a moderate off white head with lacing, nice looking. Belgian spice aroma. Nice medium body with pale malts, fruit, Belgian spices and distinct honey. Honey and slight hop finish. A bit sweet and has a brief acerbic flavor, but overall quite nice and interesting ale. Similar to a triple, but heavier bodied and with a nice honey backbone. I will try this again."
""
"Overall: this beer has a wonderful look and decent feel, but it is simply way too sweet for me. That said, the flavors are otherwise decent."

"O: I've used similar words a few times in this review, but the best way to describe this beer is strange. The honey character is big and adds some notes you don't find in most beers. Don't know if I would by again for myself, but interesting nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe a bit too much honey? Orange flip-flops with the coriander on the flavor and makes a bigger impression. Quite sweet and the coriander accentuates that a bit without much to offset the sweet flavors...maybe a kiss of drying alcohol. Not bad, especially if you think of it more as an imperial wit than BSPA, I think it has more in common with the former."

"Pretty good brew, alcohol is very well hidden so it’s good quaffable."
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."

""
""
"The taste is something I don't think I could ever get enough of. It is a good thing this is pretty expensive or I would drink it all day instead of going to work. I hope the perfect aftertaste lasts until tomorrow."
""
"O: Delicious beer. Best honey beer I've ever had"
""
"Nice beer, but I can't decide whether it is summery or wintery."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"not too overly sweet, mouthfeel very nice, and overall, a nicely balanced strong pale ale. the honey perhaps didn't add as much as i was expecting, but still quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a blast of zesty spice up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish. Huge peppery, coriander flavor along with some citrus rind. This is complimented by a spicy hop bite that has hints of dry, grassy pine.  The honey flavor is there but subtle and not artificially sweet. There's also sweet light fruit notes especially apple and pear along with some banana. A bit heavy on the spices at first but it's fairly light and easy to drink."
"O: Reading some of the other reviews; I don't see what the fuzz is all about. A decent (a bit above average) Belgian Strong Pale Ale. The honey makes it interesting, but in this style the grade is can't be higher..."
"This beer poured out as a nice lookin golden color. It has a nice white fluffy head on top and leaves a light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's got some Belgian yeast aromas and has just a little bit of honey in there too. The taste of the beer is on the sweeter side, it doesn't really taste like a Braggot ale or anything. It is more or less just a sweet golden ale. The mouthfeel had a good carbonation to it and still has a smooth body. Overall this beer wasn't too bad. Not my favorite but not bad."
"O Overall this beer rocks and I would definitely buy it again. The best honey beer style ale i have ever tasted."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer but there are several others in the style that I would choose first."
"D - semi sessionable in the flavor and mouthfeel but the abv is probably too high for that. A decent beer and a refreshing change of pace from most Belgian styles"
"Thanks to jdiddy for passing this one along. 11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Best before 10:13 indicated on the back label. Pours a dull, honey-colored hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose is really interesting - citrus, coriander, grass and honey (almost reminds me of an herbal cough drop ala Ricola). Taste comes together a bit better than I would anticipate from the nose. The same elements are still there, and the overall impression is still the same, however, the edges are a bit more rounded out. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that is lively and also a bit gassy. There's also a very faint citrus astringency in the mix. Finish is crisp, with some residual carbonation burn at the back of the throat. Overall, not a beer I think I need to revisit. It's definitely interesting and has some witbier qualities to it, but this beer just falls a little short for me."
"Drink-  This was pretty tasty and the honey was well tempered.  Honey isnt my favorite flavor but this was okay."
"Feels very good in the mouth, nice balance between heavy and carbonation."
"Very easy drinking. Just a slight warming from the 8%, but it really isn't noticeable at all. I could sit and drink a pile of these."
"Overall this is more Belgan Blonde (almost forgot to mention there is just enough funk here) than either Bier de Miel or Saison. Think a more interesting Leffe. Very tasty."
"O - What a great find! This brew is everything I was hoping it would be! Well done, I hope to find more beers like this one throughout the summer!"
"Dr: Not a good session beer, but maybe worth a go for fans of the style. Hides its relatively high abv pretty well. Very affordable in Belgium."
"D- a tasty brew but i'm just not a fan of sweet beers. one and done for me but it's always cool to drink something that is modeled after, or made according to, an ancient recipe."
"Barbar pours a clear golden color, bone white fizzy head forms and leaves some lace on the glass. In the aroma, honey, malt sweetness and some floral hops. Also a note of coriander like spice. In the flavor, dry spicyness reminiscent of coriander, lemon zest and anise. A nice sweetness and belgian yeast kick pair well with the spices. Solid mouthfeel, lighter bodied. Overall, a tasty little beer here. A pleasent mix of malt, belgian yeast, honey and spice."
"Barbãr sounds like the kind of beer made on a dare, but believe me when I tell you that it's one of the few 8% beers you'll end up chugging rather than sipping. It was a bold man, he who first decided to toil with such dissonant, oddball ingredients, and it was a very adept one who could formulate such a delicious, balanced recipe out of them. I loudly applaud brasserie Lefèbvre for this offering - I'd buy it anytime."
"D- This was a decent BSPA and it hides the alcohol well so I will merit it on that. I would drink another, but I don't know that I would pay for another."
"Notes: Overall Barbar (honey ale) is a very tasty and complex ale. It is definitely worth a try."
"D: This is delicious! Complex, fresh delightful bundle or various flavors. Amazing how those brilliant Belgians hide the alcohol in the various flavors. Do your soul a favor and give this a try, you deserve it!"
"Drink - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and will seek it out again. The alcohol well was well hidden and the flavours really came together well."
"D: Tastes bit strong, but is quenching, in its way. I could imagine quaffing a bowl after battle, but it's not something I'd want to sip after dinner. Not recommended."
"Not the best beer you'll ever have, but interesting enough to highly recommend a try."
"M/D: Pretty easy drinking for being relatively high in alcohol. This beers manages to set itself apart from the wonderful world of Belgian beers."
"Goes very well with strong cheese."
"ages ago, before there was sugar, they used to sweeten the beer with honey. Therefore, this should give a great idea how (sweet) beer tasted back then..."
"D - Really high. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. ABV is reasonable for the style and I got through mine quick considering it was shared."
"jd"
"Notes: At first, I wasn't really impressed with this one, but it grew on me. Tasty and very light for 8% abv. Very nice."
"This beer was bought et the SAQ in the kit ½ meter of beer. Poured from a 330ml brown bottle. Nice dark golden very clear bottle. White head on top. On the nose we can smell clover flowers (maybe clover flower honey). Good taste with a lot of residual sugar, some honey flavor too."
"Very drinkable. Tasted fresh and alcohol had a slight warming effect."
"D-Pretty high. At only $3.99 a bottle, this is a bargain."
"I like this beer, but only one at a time, I am sure the sweetness that it hides so well would eventually come to the fore and ruin the flavours for me."
"Bottle at Chancey Smith. Decent drinking Belgian pale. Unexceptional other than some orange in flavour, honey in the secondary. Golden yellow coloured body with some head, lots of lace. High carbonation. Neutral aromas, perhaps the honey absorbs it.Easy mouthfeel, the smoothness from the honey overrides the carbonation. Nice summer Belgian."
"D - Nicely drinkable, alcohol pretty well hidden. At only $1 a bottle, I am going to have to buy more of this."
"Sounded good, but I am not a fan. I really don't like the taste; it is a bit too ""chemical""-like."
"D: This was a pretty interesting and enjoyable beer, like a honey witbier. It was fairly clean and hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. But it's worth sipping to fully appreciate the unique honey character. Recommended, if only to try once."
"M/D: the feel is light sticky and carbonated like a European mineral water. The drinkability is good minus the smell."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours clear gold with a thin white head. Aromas of bread and a quite vivid honey note. Reminiscent of homemade biscuits with honey on them. Sweet grainy flavor, solid honey influence with a barely-there grassiness. Lightly astringent, dry, and a bit unclean in the finish. Still very drinkable."
"D: Very enjoyable, as the honey is there but not cloying like honey can so often be. A very nice Belgian Pale Ale."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer when relaxing on a winter night or hanging out with friends in the summer. I'm not sure I would want more than 2 or 3 in a sitting, but I will definitely be ordering this again."
"T: Taste of strong Honey, syrupy consistency, medium to thick mouthfeel, some orange, spices, very light malt flavor almost unnoticeable with the strong honey presence. Drinkability for me was unfortunately low as the honey was just too much for me. I havent drank many meads, excluding ""Hopslam"" but this has to be one of the thicker varieties of Honey Belgian Strong Ales. And to think it is only 8% -"
"Notes: A lot like a mead but with more of a beer (particularly a Hefe) base. Had it one winter night and it was great to sip on and have a warming feeling."
"A very nice, easy to appreciate and enjoy beer. Good stuff."
"The scent of flowers mixed with honey and orange, is sweet. And even if the beer is fermented honey, it reminds one chouia. It does indeed power than hanging around the bottom of the glass and points at this time honey roasted. The body is sparkling in his mouth while drinking sweet taste is quite pronounced. And post-flavored, honey has cut the bitterness of the drink and makes it light and easy to drink, but without making it sweet."
"Definitely notice the honey in this brew, pretty prominent in the taste, but not in a bad way at all. It is a brew that falls on the sweeter side, but not as sweet as I would have thought with the honey addition/theme. Peppery alcohol, some herbal spiciness; light hint of fruitiness; pretty nice actually! Lighter to medium body overall, and with very bubbly, tight carbonation. Interesting enough, but not as quaffable. Neat brew, and worth a try."
"This is a really well constructed brew. Flavours play off eachother treally well giving it a surprising drinkability given the big alcohol content."
"overall an above average belgian strong ale."
"On the other hand, with the honey sweetness it's not a beer you'd want more than 2 bottles of on an evening."
"D: This is one drinkable beer. Hopefully the sweet flavor doesn't change my mind. It is very palatable and would be sessionable if it were lower in ABV."
"Pours a golden clear orangish colored body, with a big frothy creamy white head, lastingish. Spicy aroma, some orange peel. Lemon and citrus. Floral taste, sweet and almost sickly. Strong honey taste. Some citrus and orange and lemon too. Mostly light tasting, sweet aftertaste, very floral."
"D- Very complex beer and one that would be a crowd pleaser as well. Good enough to have several in one sitting if you can put up with the carbonation. Good beer and its something that you should pick up if the opportunity comes about!"
"D-OK. Pretty easy going, but not amazing. This seems similar to some of the imperial witbiers that are popping up here and there in the USA. I think this one is interesting to sample."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit I liked the taste that the honey added worth trying sometime"
"Overall: This is a surprisingly good beer, different, but great. Spicy, sweet and creamy, this beer has it all. Highly recommendable."
"Drinks alright had this on tap in Germany at a beer fest & it was better. An interesting take on the style that may have suffered just a bit during travel. If I ever drink it again, I will let it warm WAY up"
"I tried this beer on December 22, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a pale gold with a thick, foamy, white head that lasted. The aroma was grainy malt, and a little honey. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, with mild carbonation. The flavour was more grainy malt, some milky tones, and a little honey. Nothing spectacular about this one."
"Barbar pours a finger of foam over a slightly cloudy honey colored brew. Carbonation is steady, the nose is funky Belgian yeast all the way- fruity and cidery. The flavor is sweet light malt up front, with notes of butterscotch, honey and orange- there's a bit of herbal hop off the back and a little bite of alcohol. Mouthfeel starts round, goes crisp and dries a bit- the honey mentioned on the label contributing a little to both, I imagine. Very smooth and drinkable- maybe a little too drinkable for 8% alcohol by volume. Very cool label- worth checking out!"
"Very tasty treat, I'm struggling not to take a sip every 30 seconds. Found down at Busters in Memphis - try one if you can find one."
"Really soft and full, great soft carbonation, love the feel. Very easy drinker, a great beer for this style."
"As the beer warms, the malt really comes through."
"D Not that great. There are more interesting, inspiring BSPA out there. This is actually a bit forgettable despite that unique white grape shot of sweetness in the beginning of the taste spectrum."
"Overall- Not bad, very honey sweet with a slight boozy touch."
"Medium bodied and drinkable but a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"D- Easy to drink. The alcohol is ever so slightly noticeable. This would make a wonderful summer beer. A sweet and balanced Belgian Pale Ale."
"33 cl bottle. This brew is a light golden color with a slight white head. The aroma is a mix of sweet, light honey, grain, and pale malts. It's strange, but the smell reminds me of a hot summer day. There's a touch of herbal hops in the background of aroma. The taste, though, carries almost no bitterness. It has honey and malt flavors, but restrained bitterness. Sweet, but not too sweet, and not at all cloying. A nice balance of carbonation and some bitterness round out the beer. It's quite good, much better than expected. Drinkable and flavorful."
"Overall not a bad beer. I'm not really sure how I feel about honey in a beer, but it is a decent brew."
"date consumed: 4 Nov 2008"
"D: Definitely unusual. Far too cloying for my taste, this one is a chore to drink."
"Overall, I couldn't help but be underwhelmed by this beer. Perhaps I should have expected something so sweet, but it just didn't hold a candle to the other Belgians I had that night. It does have a lot going for it, but I think I'll pass on it next time."
"Drinkability- Everytime I see a new Belgian brew with a low price tag, I'm always hesitant. In this case it was a nice suprise. Very drinkable and tasty."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: On the palate this one is oily/and slick. The body is medium-light with delicate carbonation. The beer has a dry finish that eggs you on to take another sip. This is an easy drinking beer, and I can see this one being dangerously drinkable in the hot summer months, Look Out! this is one that you might easily find yourself getting unintentionally drunk off of on a hot summer day... it drinks that well, just like a wit, and just like a wit it is equally refreshing. This is one that I can see myself picking up again. As far as beers brewed with honey, Midas Touch and this are the best I've had so far."
"This is an OK beer but not one of the best. Try it once and I am sure you won't want a whole case of the stuff."
"Taste is complex, tart, sweet almost to the point of cloying, but not quite, and a bit bitter in the end. Some spice, big fruits and clove exist, and the honey essence is mixed in fairly well, which finishes things off nicely. Mouth-feel is rounded and creamy at first, but finishes with a bit of crispness. It goes down pretty easy, with the 8% alcohol being barely noticeable. It's well carbonated, which keeps things pretty airy in the mouth. Not bad overall, but not totally my cup o'tea either."
"It's extremely drinkable cold -- warmth reveals a bit more of the alcohol and spice and turns it to more of a sipping beer. Cold, I could easily drink a sixer -- if I take it slow and savor its character as it warms I'd still want a second."
"D: A tad sweet but has a well hidden abv behind the sweetness. Good for a try if anything."
"Always game to try the new stuff to the neighborhood. It is not surprising that this beer is caught somewhere between a Witbier and a Mead. The pour brings out more of a mead appearance with a honey-like color (golden, light amber) with a heaviness and legging like brandy. Aromas are also mead-like up front with a sharp honey, nectar scent before the wheat malts, barley, and twangy yeast character builds in. Estery, citrusy, and flowery throughout the nose. Flavors heavily favor the sweet honey flavor, with a backup of wheat malt, barely, yeasty flavors and herbal tea notes to follow. The hop flavors give a much needed complexity, balance, and variety. Spicy with Wit-like corriander, curraco, pepper, and a lot of yeast contributions. The textures as expected are a bit syrupy, heavy, and more cloying than malty. A hoppy bittering is the only repreive. Finishes spicy, warm, and sweet -- a good substitute for a mead. Similar to the ancient brewed concoctions that are being revived by some Dogfish Head brews. Interesting, but not exactly sessionable."
"This makes a nice apertif on a day when the temperature is approaching hellacious, but I don't think I'd want to follow it up with another or several more if I had purchased more than one. I'd rate this a pretty good example of the style, but not an essential one."
"With all the honey it ends up feeling very heavy for a pale ale. A bit cloying. Pleasant, but not great."
"This is an interesting brew, that has a smoothness and a refreshing quality that makes it deceptively drinkable. When in the mood for a sweeter, honey-ish ale, this one is certainly one to grab!"
"An interesting and drinkable ale, sweet & spicy. Perhaps not the most balanced (although both sweetness & bitterness are both there in spades), but enjoyable nonetheless."
"D - Nice and smooth. Could have a few but 8% abv is a little high to sessioning."
"Barbar pours with a clear golden hue moderate head and carbonation. The real thing about it is trying to figure out what these flavors are doing. The sent of honey, wheat and pepper. There is this battle of funkyness between the golden style and the calming sweetness of the honey. Funky tartness like the inside of the skin of the granny smith apple mixed with a skin of a lemon held togehter with pepper and orange marmalade. Wierd, and it leaves a grassy aftertaste with a citric zest. Somthing refreshing yet contemplative."
"This beer pretty much comes as advertised. It pours an amber orange color with a slight bit of haze, modest carbonation, a reasonable head with retention, not much lacing. The aroma is quite mild, sweet malts, honey, candied florals, maybe some hard to pin down spices, some alcohol notes too. The taste is a bit sourish, some candied fermentables, spices such as coriander, definite honey notes, some typical Belgian yeastiness, a bit of orange rind. The alcohol is a bit too strong with this beer, and it is not masked over all that well. This could have been a much better beer with more crispness and less alcohol. The finish is a bit tart, a bit drying, and too alcoholy."
"Pours a five+ finger cream head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet apple cider nose. Flavor is sweet, fruity with some honey almost cloying. Clean finish. $3.70 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. Best before Oct 2007."
"Good beer, bought it for $3.50 @ 12oz to pit it against my clone. Flowery bouquet. Fine head and body. Flavor sweet and spicy. Honey evident without being cloying. Finish beautifully balanced and dry. Quite drinkable. Should not have been filtered I will drink my own barbarian from now on."
"Barbar (meaning 'barbarian') is anything but an unmannered brute. It's a civilized tipple that combines a handful of classic flavors into an enjoyable, drinkable whole. In spite of the $3.49 price tag, I could be convinced to buy it again. Actually, it wouldn't take any convincing at all."
"Overall, not a bad brew after you've already had a couple..."
"It's ambitious but it never really steps up to the plate for a full swing. The ingredients fall together but never mesh so much as co-exist tentatively. It's moderately drinkable on a good day, I guess. I gave it a shot, but I can safely say that, despite being more than mediocre, this won't be making a return trip to my fridge."
"Overall - A decent enough and slightly different pale ale... just maybe a little on the sweet side though... worth a try..."
"Pours a hazy, bright golden color with a nice, fluffy, white head that reatains great. The aroma came flying up during the pour. Smells of apples, bubble gum, fruity, bananas, coriander, citrus notes. Fantastic nose!!! The flavor is also reminiscent of apples, citrus notes, spices ala coriander, banana, hops in the finish. Very juicy but comes across very thin. Mouthfeel is light, very carbonated, and crisp. Pretty drinkable. Not bad at all."
"D: Goes down nicely. I could have had more of this one."
"Pours a slightly foggy orange/gold with an uneventful nose that has minor alcohol and spices peeking out. Flavor is strongly influenced by spices and there is a definite hint of orange there as well. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and a decent liquid feel. Very drinkable. As long as you don't mind heavily spiced beers, go for it. Cool cap on the bottle too."
"Overall, decent. I've had better, but this a solid BSPA. No outstanding flaws, just not very complex and a bit heavy on certain characteristics."
"Review added 11-14-2007, translated from french 1-21-2008."
"Typical teeny 11.2 ounce Belgian offering, Pours darkish golden, clear, under a nice looking tiny bubble film and leave some great, fine, striated and wispy lacing. The nose is of some honey, and ripe fruits. Pleasant enough creation, peppery spicing, bright yeasty notes, some sweetness picked up late, balanced by dry and, again peppery notes. Nice. Worth a try."
"Appears a honey golden semi clouded hue with effervescent bubbles streaming up to form a bright white head even fine Belgian style lacing. Aromatics mild cat pee funkiness, coriander spiciness with soft honey sweetness. Mild citrus peel with perfumey herbal hop accents, the smell works for me. Flavor brings upfront honey sweetness balanced with spicy coriander/citrus peel combo pale biscuit malt sweetness with light herbal grassy hops in the finish. I'm not crazy about honey beers but this one wasn't cloying in anyway pretty smooth and straight forward witbier, honey infused hybrid of a Belgian blonde ale. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with effervescent bubbly carbonation tickles the palate but flows nicely. Drinkability is decent not a session beer, but I'm glad I gave it a shot although in the future I know compared to some of my favorite Belgians I probaby won't return to this one in the near future."
"Drinkability: While this is a unique product and I applaud the craft that went into making, I just don't care for the flavor profile; too medicinal for my tastebuds"
"Simple and not totally balanced, but enjoyable. Refreshing and warming at the same time."
"Not bad, and definitely different. Worth a try."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into my DT glass. Had a best by date of Jan 09. It was a clear golden color with slight alcohol shimmer. It had a big white head that dissipated into a collar. Good carb with some lacing. The aroma was awesome. Spicy from the coriander balanced perfectly with the orange peel and honey. The taste was also incredible. Starts off sweet from the honey then the spices kick in to be followed up with a smooth sweet again finish. I find most beers with honey to be overpoweringly sweet and therefore pretty bad but this one gets it right. The honey should be a nice accent like here and not the dominant flavor. Mouthfeel was good but had just a tad too much carb. It distracted you from the great flavor. Overall, a really great beer that I highly recommend. Glad to see this one hit the Texas market and look forward to many more. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"Enjoyable and drinkable but laking certain characteristics that would make it an above average beer."
"The flavor is mostly light and a bit weak. As a result the 8% abv becomes painfully evident as the brew warms. Okay at best."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is sweet with honey and coriander and malted wheat. The taste is can be a little too alcoholic with wheat and honey. Overall, this is a pretty interesting brew but the drinkability is affected because the alcohol comes out a little too much."
"Poured a nice deep straw - yellow with a big white fluffy head. It has nice aromas of orange and coriander, suttle hops, and slightly alcoholic. It the taste, citrus and coriander, a bitterness, with a dry alcoholic end. A nice little burn too. Decent body, malty and smooth, it seems to go down too easy. A very nice beer, expecting something completly different, but enjoyed it."
"Now just put some yeast in the damn bottle..."
"This is a sipper, and definitely not something I'd visit again on a regular basis. Good, but not that good."
"I can definitely taste the honey, but it isn't overpowering. Sweet aftertaste is a kind of citrus. No strong bite or aftertaste that usually comes along with stronger beers either. I'd say that I could drink these all day long, but at 8%, I probably wouldn't get very far. Perfect beer for someone like me who is trying to make the jump from mainstream to more interesting styles."
"D: pretty good. an interesting beer, as long as you are in the mood for something on the sweet side. the 8% goes down without much fuss."
"Very easy drinking, similar in that respect to Duvel. Deceptive abv, and it's not easy to sip...more of a quaffer. Would be a nice sessioner in a 750mL serving."
"Not as interesting as I expected. Pretty average overall, I managed to drink it with a little effort."
"Fluffy pale yellow (almost white) head three fingers thick make it beautiful in the glass. Nice pale golden straw coloring with nice streamers of carbonation. Pilsner style smell with notes of hops, citrus, spice, slightly burns the nostrals. Thick in the mouth but very smooth on the tongue. Taste is complex and interesting. Honey sweetness mixed with spice overtones and slight bitterness just start the palate. Small tint of orange, lime, and mellow yeast. Yum. Not what the smell tells you it's going to taste like."
"Too bad this is priced so high ($12 for a 4-pack) or I'd be drinking this on a regular basis. This would make a very nice aperitif."
"Recommended!"
"I'll get it again if I see it, but not for the 1300 yen (roughly $13) I paid here in Tokyo!"
"Very good beer. It's easy to fall in love with it and it's even easier to get drunk with it. Beware!"
"D - Really good beer. I was expecting much more of the honey, which is in there, but intermingled nicely. Way too easy to drink for a beer of this strength."
"Overall a very nice brew. The honey is a nice addition to the beer and I'll definitely drink this again, it goes down just so well."
"Well worth trying!"
"Pours a good looking light hazy gold under a thick 1.5 finger head that lingers well and leaves lots of spots of lace on the glass. The nose is sweet, sweet, sweet, with the orange definitely coming on strong. The mouth is very heavily carbonated but fairly light, not nearly as sticky as I expected. The taste is sweet - honey and orange definitely come out strong. There's some malt here, but no discernible hops. The finish is sweet, while the aftertaste conjures up a bit of orange tanginess to go with the sweet honey. Undoubtedly a good beer, this is not what I'm looking for."
"Pours a clear deep gold with an impressive and persistant head. Aroma of honey and musty yeast with notes of coriander. Flavor begins slightly sweet with notes of honey, malt, and coriander... has a light bitterness at the finish which adds a nice balace. Moutfeel is velvety smooth and creamy, with moderate carbonation. This is a very good beer... one I'd be happy to drink often."
"Overall Impression: Seems to be another Duvel ""knock-off", only that its twist is the use of honey instead of candi sugar. I don't mean that in a bad way. It's a good beer. Could use a little more head; pretty skimpy up top. Aroma is quite alluring."
"Bottled under license by the Cheval Blanc in Montreal. Light golden ale witha medium head that did not disapear too quickly. The honey taste is very discreet. I could recognize the usual taste of malt from the Cheval Blanc. Enjoyable but not exceptionnal"
"Flavor is very sweet and rich. Honey is definitely apparent, particularly in the finish, where the honey sweetness finishes the flavor. Estery and very tasty. I liked it a lot."
"Look for this beer and try it if you can."
"Not as sweet as i was expecting. Sweet honey start, slightly peppery bitterness in the finish, medium bodied, herbal hoppy flavour in the finish, flavours didn't quite blend, but i thought it was OK."
"Hazy, gold with lasting head. Mouthfeel has a texture comparable to a Belgian Wit. Flavors of apricot, light honey and subdued alcohol (8% abv) blend well. Faint hops and some lemon tartness offset the sweetness nicely."
"It's also a tribute to the robust ales of the Barbarians. Adding a measure of honey and wheat to their barley gave it a new flavour and sparkle ... this type of drink became known as ""the Warrior's Reward."""
