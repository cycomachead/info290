The head is enormous – 3” or more of pure white finely bubbled foam that persists and leaves ledges of lace inside the glass. The palate offers peaches in different stages of ripeness followed by an earthy hop bitterness on the finish with a layer of malt sweetness and alcohol. It is slightly warming but the alcohol is not hot or solventy. The body is suprising medium for the amount of alcohol and flavor and the carbonation is above average.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

This is one of my favourite styles of beer, and I must say that Piraat compares admirably to many of my long-time favourites like Duvel, La Chouffe and Don de Dieu. This is a sinfully-tasty strong Belgian golden ale, and its alcohol content is so masterfully masked that I'd be likely to place it closer to 7-8% than 10-11% on a blind test. A great way to cap off Christmas 2014, and any fan of strong Belgian pales should consider this an absolute must-try.","thehyperduck","Dec 25, 2014"

3.87,-4.7,3.75,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a rich, golden amber and sits in the glass as a dark orange. A head of off-white bubbles forms above the beer but quickly whittles to a scrim. In body the beer is dark and opaque, with hints of cloudiness swirling before the eyes. When washed against the sides of the glass, it leaves a nice set of legs. On the nose, the beer smells of musty grains, honey, fusel alcohol, and cidery fruit notes. Hints of herbal and minty hops work their way into the scent as the glass is agitated, as well as subtle sherry. The smell is not particularly strong for a 10.5% ABV beer, but is instead richly subtle and restrained. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a warming, grainy, alcohol heat that builds to just before the finish. The finish splashes slight herbal hops and just a whisper of acidity and salinity, rounding the beer into a subtly complex giant. In flavor, the beer tastes of sweet cereal grains, which move into rich, silky clover honey before introducing sweet, grainy alcohol. The alcoholic heat builds into the finish of the beer, briefly skirting on cloying and then on to fusel notes, before it mellows into a minerally-sweet finish that blends the honey malts with herbal, minty hops, booze, very faint lemongrass, and a touch of salty bread. The aftertaste is of lingering honey and herbal, bitter hops that linger in the mouth for quite some time. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body with a crisp, sharp, yet smooth mouthfeel, and silky carbonation. The mouth is left tingling from the alcoholic heat when the beer leaves, but is then doused in a torrent of spittle that pours from the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a beautifully restrained Belgian Strong Golden Ale. The yeast character is soft, though subtle phenols and esters do start to sprout as the beer warms. This is a beautiful sipper, and a wonderful example of how to brew with a restrained hand (quite the opposite of most American brewers these days…). The more I drink this beer, the more flavors I unravel, which is excellent.","Maxwell","May 07, 2014"

There is a bunch of sediment in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. Lots of sticky lacing is seen with each sip as well. There is a bunch going on with the aroma as there is caramel malts, lemon grass, dark fruits and honey. The taste has a lot going on as well with sweet malts right up front, followed by plums and some sweet bourbon-like flavor for the finish. I am surprised it is a I.P.A. style brew as there is no bitter/hoppy aftertaste at all. You don't taste the high alcohol content either. Goes down easy and after one of these, on a empty stomach, you will feel it. Over a great brew!","BeerWithMike","Mar 30, 2014"

Not a great aroma, but the taste is very enjoyable and satisfying, with hints of spiciness and moderate floral notes. While a huge Belgian fan, this style has never been one of my favorites. I'm not sure why. But Piraat has always been a favorite of mine in this style, with easy drinkability, very moderate hops, and an almost undetectable alcohol presence for its high abv. And I love the bottle. I'll always have a place in my heart for this beer.","Beer-A-Lot","Feb 16, 2014"

The taste of candy sugar is there but it is not obtrusive, more complimentary to the yeast and supplements the bitterness of the hops in a tasty way. There is a good amount alcohol to bolster the hops in the flavor- more of a strong pale than Belgian IPA to my taste, but who knows what this is like fresh in Belgium?-Not me. I like this but it seems stronger than most of its strength. I like the taste and would definitely buy this again considering its complexity.","Slatetank","Jan 19, 2014"

Bits of light sweet fruit like apple, pear, and raisin offset with a spicy earthy yeasty flavor. Medium to thick body with a spirited level of carbonation but a thick sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

I don't get the other hop essentials, so im confused. rich flavor, creamy feel, vanilla before the bitter taste comes in. rich grain bill, oats maybe here, like a tripel, but not sweet at all, minus the candy sugar. interesting, but the alcohol is strong. its almost too strong. the taste finishes with a burn, and its moderately unflattering, but still unique to this brew alone with all that strange bitter. well carbonated and smooth, aside from the booze burn. less drinkable than many, but a complex and well refined glass of ale. ill be back.","StonedTrippin","Dec 02, 2013"

I was hoping for a more complex profile similar to Gulden Draak (triple). However, this beer is a great Belgian Ale that delivers and will definetly be carried now as its own item in my shop.

Even with the hint of lemon in the mouthfeel, this was very aggressive and spices are minor enough not to detract from that.

Pours fairly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, floral, and light earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with malt sweetness. Taste of pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, floral, honey, candi sugar, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, prickly, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters and malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for 10.5%. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

I probably wouldn't buy this beer again, but if this is someone's favorite beer, I can understand why. There's just too much sugar character for me. I think I'll steer clear of Belgians for awhile.","TheSixthRing","Feb 07, 2013"

I had to go for round two, and then round three in the bottle. Each time the carbonation pairing well with the malt for a pleasant mouthfeel. The color is something or other of a high heat fire burning the wet driftwood on a beach outside of Portobello while on a search for the rest of Captain Morgan's loot that the history books never got around to mentioning, and for good reason. The head and lace of a cloudy white, like a fire that has to churn the water to vapors to provide a dense white smoke that lingers in the glass while settling and becoming twice as dense. Aside from the mass production of this said product, we have a brew that would appease even the most eccentric of the privateers out there.","mndlssphlsphr","Jan 24, 2013"

Aroma was phenol, hubba bubba, yeast and booze which got more pronounced as the beer warmed. Tasted apples, bananas, yeast and molasses. As expected it was quite bitter, generally the booze was well hidden. Well carbonated which gave it a slightly coarse edge, slightly thick body. Liked it but don't think it did quite enough to justify some of the hype.","jonb5","Jan 08, 2013"

Head is two inches, dense and off-white and eventually settles into a consistent, frothy, quarter inch skim. Textured swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses notes of candi sugar, citrus rind, green apple, and a slightly herbal quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of a light, toasted malt character. There's also a trace of bitterness towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, with a lively carbonation and a bit of acidic astringency. I'm not sure I'd classify this as a Belgian IPA as it's closer to a BSPA in my opinion. That said, this beer is quite tasty and complex with an extremely well-hidden abv. I'm sorry I put off trying this it for so long.","Jwale73","Jan 02, 2013"

But the clashing nature of them somehow just really works out. It isn’t too much. It is delicious. In the nose, on the palate, the mouthfeel. It’s all spot on.

Amazing how much your palate can adapt in a year. Certainly worth checking out by any IPA or Belgian beer fan. Watch out for freshness however, I really enjoyed the hop profile in this beer.","TwelveOunces","Aug 14, 2012"
4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"One of my favourites, not top 10 but very close. This amber coloured strong blond ale can be enjoyed with our without adding the yeast from the bottle. Personally, I prefer to add, it gives the beer that extra 'punch'. Complex & rich taste, starting with an 'in your face' hoppy biterness, followed by a caramel-like sweetness with a peppery finish which is washed away by light sweetness again, kicking in a bit stronger then first ! It has a little sticky mouthfeel afterwards so it will not be your preffered thirst-quenching drink but still very enjoyable on a warm summer evening outside.","BelgianBeerPope","Aug 11, 2012"

The front end is sweet from the candi sugar and malts, bready from the malt and yeast, and that hop bitterness follows as well. The booze also comes through in the flavor. There is some faint fruitiness as well, but it is mild and takes a back seat to the other flavors. The body is medium with abundant carbonation. The higher alcohol can definitely be felt here, but it should at 10.5%. The finish is slightly dry. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Aug 04, 2012"

Piraat smells like a yeasty banana, pear and apricot concoction. In the taste there is also a light citrus peel-like quality. There is a smart tingle in the tip of the tongue, a complex fruity flavor, and, true to a good Belgian, a perfect hop balance. Forget the grog. Piraat will chase away the scurvy.","RedBear84","Jun 23, 2012"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, spice, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, spice, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The fruit presence on both the aroma and flavor were the dominant factor going on here and covered up what could have been quite a few subtle notes that got lost. I really hope this was not the case as this one had the potential to be a really nicely done brew for the style, but just lacked the complexity I love from some of the brews of this style.

Alcohol warms the palate and a sting of spice, then gives way to a smooth grassy bitterness and big dose of the pepper.

4.06,0,5,4,4,4,4,"Enormous fluffy head eventually collapses into itself somewhat but just won't quit, lingering on at no less than one finger. Unreal lacing. Beautiful burnished gold shade looks perfectly inviting especially when held right up by a light source, just a touch of haze but not so much that it obscures the perpetual effervescence at the heart of the beer. Simply gorgeous. The smells are spicy and yeasty. Pretty prominent clove aroma, maybe some nutmeg. Alcohol is fairly obvious - a human being will smell boozy after consuming this, and even a tiny person is considerably larger than a 11.2 oz bottle. Flavors come on sweet and spicy at first, a lot of intensely caramel sweet and somewhat acidic fruity flavors. The hops basically ambush the scene after hiding out on the aroma front. Not much in the way of hop flavor either, but their bitterness comes on strong right along with the boozy warming sensation to create a memorable beer experience. The hops are enough to dry your mouth out, but the beer itself could finish a bit drier. This is a big, pushy beer and the carbonation level also fits those descriptors, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing as it serves to lively up a beer that would feel much stickier otherwise. All together, I personally really enjoyed this beer after having one for the first time in a long time. I feel like this one sometimes gets disrespected or overlooked by some for being widely available, or being part of a somewhat larger conglomerate, or whatever, but if an American brewery produced something like this people would be falling all over themselves (if distribution was limited and they used the word "barrel", anyway). A must-drink for anyone interested in the wide world of belgian beer, and a good lesson that the concept of an intensely bitter beer had crossed the minds of belgian brewers long ago.","kc44","Apr 16, 2012"

Flavors are more heavily spiced, with a strong clove and grains of paradise character along the rich fruit and boozey backbone. Fruits range from pineapple to pear, and grapefruit to apple. Slightly cloying, resiny sweet aftertaste with a mild hopping. The finish is rich and slick, with an oily mid-linger.

This beer had pretty damn good drinkability, It went down smooth and faster then I expected and it hid it's 10.5% alcohol very well. What I liked most about this beer was the complexity of the aroma and flavor, there was a lot going on and it all came together nicely. What I liked least about this beer was the lack hops, the hops were there but there weren't nearly as noticeable as I would expect from a Belgian IPA, a bigger hop profile would really take this beer to the top. I would buy this beer again, but it was a little pricey so this would make a good beer for special occasions, if you like Belgian beers then this one is for sure worth a try. This was the first Belgian IPA I have had that is actually Belgian so the super hoppy aspect that I was expecting may be common for American versions but maybe not for traditional Belgian ones, I don't know, I am going to have to try more real Belgian IPA's to figure out the difference. It seems like the American ones have a more noticable hop profile and the Belgian ones have a better and more complex backbone, either way I still think Raging Bitch is my favorite but this beer was good in it's own right. This beer made for a good first impression for this brewery and it has inspired me to seek out more beer from this Belgian brewery, good job guys this is one memorable beer.","StoutHunter","Mar 02, 2012"
4.67,15,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with a one finger medium white head with moderate retention and nice lacing Aroma of light fruit, Belgian spices and a bit of caramel malt. Flavor follows with complex mixture of light fruit, caramel malt, coriander and clove, fairly sweet; spicing is reminiscent of a tripel. Finish is robust light fruit with a neutral, somewhat citrus hop kick. Medium to full creamy bodied with nice carbonation. Great mouthfeel. Very nicely done; complex with a nice progression of flavors. Sorry I waited so long to try this, the label looks like a lot of other middle-of-the road Belgians, but this is quite fine.","LiquidAmber","Mar 02, 2012"

But now I'm more educated and after trying it again, I can say it's good, but one is enough and I'm not sure I can see buying this again for the price. The mouthfeel is amazingly good, and the beer is nice to look at and inhale, but the taste...well the taste is something that is way too complex and difficult to tease out to my tastebuds. The alcohol is well hidden, but it's not a drinkable beer. I find that I sip and savor and once it's done I feel that I'm glad I tried it, but I need to wait another 5-10 years for my palate to get more educated before trying again. So overall - a good beer and I think there is more to this beer, but one per sitting is more than enough with this beer and I feel that maybe, just maybe, it's too much in a beer. Too much going on for it to be really just drank and enjoyed.","damndirtyape","Dec 30, 2011"

The initial taste was very smooth. Going down easy, one could drink a lot of this before it catches up to them. Sour notes tickled the tongue with balanced hits of banana, sour apple, and perhaps a hint of citrus before a level of hoppiness becomes evident. At the same time, the alcohol warms on its way down which is a wonderful feeling on an autumn evening. The aftertaste brought to mind lemon flavor in sun tea with its unique tart bitterness coating the tongue. The final taste has some staying power which is not afraid to remind the drinker what a good beer this is.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 23, 2011"

The nose detects intense citrus clove and brandy-like alcohol that ends up bringing a super glue idea that is a bit stronger than I would like. A bit scary! The flavor is a nice flowery hop over intensely sweet grains and muted clove. This is medium-plus bodied with a near syrupy feel and just a tingle of carbonation that keeps this fairly drinkable. This brew is classic and satisfying, and mellows so nicely as you work through the pint.","Durge","Nov 13, 2011"

Taste is spicy followed by mild alcohol, lightly sweet at points, fairly hoppy, yeasty toward the finish with some citrusy sweetness, bubble gum notes come and go, well balanced.

A wonderful dark cherry color that is excellently clarified to provide a stark contrast to the bright white head that provides almost an impermeable cap to the beer. The foamy head actually hinders any aromas at first, but once the beer warms and the head mellows, you are left with a sweet cherry woodiness with almost no alcholic character. The flavor is also very smooth and compliments the nose with a rich cherry flavor with a dark maltiness that is more oaky then chocolatey. An all around excellent experience.","vincicle","Nov 02, 2011"

4.42,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Soft copper orange in color with a yellowish hue. Poured with a brief, dense white head that reduced to a wispy cap. A plethora of aromas: banana, dark fruit, dark sugar, dark citrus. Different aromas seemed to pop up every time I lifted the glass. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly resinous feel. Citrus hop flavors, banana and belgian spice compete for flavor dominance. A solid sugary, fruit-like sweetness provides a solid back bone from beginning to end. Alcoholic heat shows through in the middle and intensifies toward the finish. Finishes with sweet but pine bitter hoppiness that doesn't linger for very long. Lots of aromas and flavors make this very enjoyable.","IronLover","Aug 18, 2011"

Taste is fairly sweet and fruity with a richness. Fairly long finish. This is from the same maker of Gulden Draak and in some ways this beer strikes me as a less concentrated version of that beer though they're probably unrelated in technique. Anyway, thoroughly enjoyable and in fact a better beer than I expected from the squat little bottle mine came in and the simple pirate reference of the label.","MoreThanWine","Aug 15, 2011"

In fact, despite the unmistakable presence of alc., somehow my palate finds the nectar surprisingly easy to quaff, partially thanks to the rather low profile of candy-sugary elements.

The taste of the beer brings all those qualities together in a very spicy flavored IPA. The aftertaste has some nice bread flavors also. The mouthfeel is a sharp and tingly.

3.62,-10.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Served in goblet glass at refrigerator temperature. Pours with slight head which dissipates into a thin lacing within a minute or so. The aroma is slight- heavily of sweet, somewhat spicy malt (not terribly cloying, though). The flavor is of a heavy malt which is just barely balanced by a subtly spicy hop flavor. The hop presence works but, for the pure flavor (rather than the style), I would have preferred a bit more bitterness to balance the big malt. (A judicious and slight addition of cascade would be sublime.) There's generally said to be a orange flavor but, if it's there, it's hidden by the malt. Given the double-digit alcohol count, it is surprising how little (if any) alcohol flavor is present. Would pair well with really spicy food.","matt20102","Jun 19, 2011"

The hops do not overpower the yeast or malt and it's well balanced. Great funkiness in the nose too, I really like their yeast strain.

However, as it warms up, the sweetness and honey and booze take over. The palate is spicy and phenolic, fairly sharp, with a grassy snap to go with the extremely expressive yeast.

This beer should be classified as a Trippel. Very high alcohol content which can be tasted, but the fruit aromas and fresh spices balance it out. Definitely has a sweet syrupy/bready aftertaste on the mouthfeel that lingers for awhile. This is a very drinkable beer with lots of nice spicy/fruit flavors.

The typical heavy Belgian carbonation is present. Aroma is very sweet and apple juice-like as well. Also, there is a slightly doughy yeast aroma in the background. 1st sip brings an initial surge of sweet fruit (apples, apricots), which gives way to a dry, spicy, peppery finish. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpoweringly so. It's a little thick on the tongue, with a sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is good, but I wouldn't call this a session beer due to the high abv. 2 or 3 slowly sipped over the course of an evening should do for me!

The taste ups the spice ante a bit, focusing on pepper and cardamom, while still maintaining a firm presence of hoppy citrus bitters and a Belgian farmhouse-like yeastiness.

On the front the sip the sugary sweetness presents itself with perfect balance. The sweetness fades quickly to a light crisp hop bitterness that leaves an incredible finish.

I really wish the hops were a little more prevalent in the nose but they really play second fiddle to the malt that's used to push the alcohol up to 10.5%. The flavor is almost exactly the same. Orchard fruits, big malty sweetness, with just a bit of hops at the tail. I think that if this beer wasnt so sweet, the booze would be almost untouchable. It still shows it head but its mostly covered by the big malt body to this beer. The mouthfeel is rather syrupy. The carbonation is light leading to the syrupy body.

The bottle smell of this brew has a distinct Belgian whiff, heavy malts, spices, smells like a HG brew. Pouring into a stemless wine glass yields a fizzy golden brew that has a head that disappears quickly but continues to fizz like a champ. Mouthfeel first, got any pancakes? This is one thick brew. All joking aside, the taste of this brew is a complex malt with slight spice undertones and a sweet yet dry bitterness that leaves a bready finish with hints of yeast.

Full-bodied yet smooth and easygoing, this in turn without sacrificing the kind of stickiness required to ensure flavor intensity. The carbonation is too aggressive through the mouth entry but does fall into line thereafter. The white grapefruit and lemon citrus on the lighter side here, however, sparked by fruit flavors of pineapple, green apple, papaya and apricot. Some banana but plays, err, second banana.

It's strong and intense tasting. Mouthfeel is medium, with good lively carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and the 10.5% ABV isn't noticable at all in the taste, but you can feel it after a while.

Lemons, pepper, grassy and a hint of sugar. Very intriguing & a definite hop presence. The taste is wonderful! A touch medicinal, taste of hay, a smooth caramel back, pepper finish. Very complex but surprisingly light. There's vanilla in there too somewhere. Mouthfeel is chewy and very, very nicely carbonated. Again, a balancing act that the beer pulls off very well. This one is very drinkable, with the malt making you want more, the hops making it seem light enough to let you drink a lot, and a pleasant alcohol warmth that just makes my toes tingle.

Aroma is of champagne, bread yeast, and candied fruit. Flavor is sweet and fruity, again champagne-like, but I felt it lacked structure or backbone...it's all melody and no harmony if you will. I felt like it needed more malt to balance out the other flavors that are present. Mouthfeel is light like cotton candy. Hides its 10.5% scarily well in both flavor and mouthfeel.

Every sip the flavor is slightly different. Every 5 sips the flavor is completely different. It never looped or repeated, it's just been a journey from first sip to last. In this way Piraat is like a movie where many other beers are more like a tv show or sitcom. Maybe it's more like a free-form jazz odyssey and less like a 4 minute repetitious radio song. Regardless, I love it and the $15 (or so, post-tax) is totally worth it given that you have the time to tear each little sensation apart at and analyze each one on a clean palate.

3.53,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours, the first half, with good clarity, a light amber color with a solid half inch of big bubbled head. The aromas contain a fair amount of Belgian character, light on the phenolics, more a citrus brightness. The hops in this one aren't particularly strong in the aroma, just notes of pine and a light floral spiciness. On the palate, things seem really out of balance, sort of wacky. I get a nice light crackery malt flavor, combined with some more nondescript hops, light yeasty character. But, it's the lower than usual carbonation combined with a biggish body that hurt this beer. The finish certainly has some hop bitterness to it. This is just a really difficult style to pull off (I feel) and Piraat comes up a bit short.","dreadnatty08","Jun 27, 2008"

It has a strong phenol character, which normally I don't care for, but it lends a bold sharpness to this beer which I found very alluring.

2.53,-37.7,5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a clear golden hue before the yeast pour, with a massive snow-white head that leaps out of the glass- just to let you know its Belgian. The typical stubborn head that comes with the style is here- one that forces you to wait; and admire the rocky billows of foam that slowly sink to reveal magnificent spiderweb lacing and active carbonation. The high carbonation releases effervescent aromas of candy-sugar, slightly buiscuity pils malt, and mild Saaz hops. The nose seems much more subdued than appropriate, and pales in comparison to the appearance or taste. First sip is light beet sugar and sharp pils. Some faint toasted notes and Trappist phenols similiar to Tripel become more obvious in the aftertaste, but the character is almost entirely devoted to bitterness. There is little to no hop flavor aside from a background spicy saaz and mabye a hint of floral Hallertau- but even the bitterness is lacking to balance the syrupy sweet malt and sugar. Of course this style is open to interpretation but Piraat is more sweet than bitter and has very litle hop presence(and yes- I am drinking the IPA Piraat). The medium body is made ultra light due to the knife-like carbonation that also whisks away some of the residual sweetness but further masks the timid noble hop character. Finishes sweet with mellow yet tart phenols, a bland and flat bitterness, and rosey alcohol notes as it warms. The phenols are interesting but other than that this seems to be a fairly simple beer and poor example of the style. This would score better as a hoppy BSGA.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 16, 2008"

Lots of fruits and malts, with some pepper, cardamon, warming alcohol and I swear I tasted paprika. Mouthfeel was a bit harsh. Overly carbonated, almost burning sensation.

I also picked up some of the hops w/ the high ABV, but there is also a dry backbite due to some pepper or spices.

4.52,11.3,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Poured into an oversized wine glass. It fills the glass about half-way with a cloudy, melon-amber color. There is about 1/4 inch of head that was produced by a relatively easy pour. It slowly begins to fade as it sets and it turns into blotchy swirls. It smells like strong sweet malts, grassy hops, and candi sugar. This smells a lot like St. Bernardus Watou Tripel. There is a creamy aspect to the smell that I think is produced by a very delicate balance of the malt used and the yeast. I like the flavor quite a bit. It is strong and sweet, the alcohol provides undertones of tart fruits that give it a sweet white wine dimension. The maltiness provides a strong base for the slightly bitter and grassy hops to build a bridge to the fruity alcohol. This is a well made, and extremely well balanced beer that gets better as it warms. The alcohol becomes more apparent, but I enjoy the level of fusel alcohol present.

The aroma is dry slightly funky yeast, I could mistake this for a hoppy saison. There is a nice subtley fragrant piney aroma like chinook hops but soft, not rough at all. The flavor is mostly like a triple. It's sweet upfront with a slightly chalky dry yeast flavor. It is slightly bitter in the aftertaste with some hop flavor, but toned done compared to the aroma. The beer is very smooth, and the alcohol is barely apparent, even after it warms. I will have to look into more beers of this style, because although this one is delicious, it's fairly expensive.","ericj551","Aug 15, 2007"

The beer is just excellent on the palate; with flavors of honey, butter and white pepper. The beer is not the least bit heavy and has a crispness I really appreciate it. It finishes just a bit dry/bitter from the hops, and is quite refreshing. Although you know the abv. is up there, this beer is surprising easy to drink.

Alcohol was quite evident up front and in the finish, but I didn't mind too much after half the bottle was gone. Mouthfeel was medium to full in the palate.

Hops are tasted on the finish for just a second. It leaves a short-lived bitterness. Very good Belgian IPA, but I cannot see myself drinking more than one of these at any given sitting.

I am not sure if it was the bottle that I had or what but I think that this was a very tough drink, just did not set right with me for some reason. It was poured to a somewhat hazy colored yellow with a smallish white hard that broke down quite quickly bur did leave a trace of lacing at the top of the glass. The aromas seemed to be complex, which really intrigued me, had fruit like lemon, spices, and a sweet property. So with the aroma, I was really thinking that this was going to be one of my great beers but the taste seemed to hold something that was very tough to take in. Upfront the taste was good with a sweet property and some spices piping through but then at the tail end I got this rough taste that I would imagine would be a mix hop and alcohol that was tough to finish. From the way it looks I am in the minority here but I felt that this brew was extremely tough to drink, and overall not very good. Again, it I am in the minority here so take this review with a grain of salt. Will I try it again, yeah will do that because this review is based on a single experience. Will update the review if I have a different perspective.","Stimack","Jan 15, 2007"
4.28,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"From a stubby bottle the pour yields a hazy, honey-colored ale with a three-finger, sudsy top. Tiny, streaming bubbles of carbonation are present. The smell is super bready/yeasty-sort of like the smell you get when cutting into a fresh loaf of sourdough, with a hint of honeysuckle and malty sweetness. Taste is also yeasty, with some estery qualities and a bit boozy too. Finishes on the dry side with a tinge of bitterness and detectable alcohol. Mouthfeel is grainy with good carbonation and a fuller body. Piraat is always easy to drink and perhaps too easy because the abv will catch up to you and before you know it you're three sheets gone. Make sure you're safe at home if you plan on putting a few of these down.","unclederby","Jan 13, 2007"

Lingering floral tangy bitterness hangs on for a while. Really quite well done. Improves and balances out with some time warming in the glass--the first swallows while cold were a bit harsh, sour, and too bitter...give it time and the components meld well. A somewhat challenging brew yet continually interesting, you keep wanting to drink more to see what the next sip will taste like. The high ABV integrates well, the strong hops hide the alcohol. Be careful!","kenito799","Jan 10, 2007"

Smell is not too intense, but is of Belgian sugars, and slightly of hops. Taste is similar to the nose; taste is initially sweet with Belgian sugars, transitions to a light hoppy taste with a slightly alcoholic, dry finish. I have to say though I would never guess that there is 10.5% present, well covered. Beer is medium-full bodied with tons of tongue stinging carbonation.

Wow lots of flavors going on in this one, starts off with a sugary bubblegum malt flavor that quickly leads way to a surprisingly bitter hop taste that balances out the sweetness quite nicely and finishes with a nice warm buttery malt flavor that lets the alcohol give it's kick. Sips nicely as it's carbonated a bit high but it seems just right for this beer and isn't overly watery or oily.

Apart from the creative label, which strangely juxtaposes a 17th-18th-century Caribbean pirate with a classic Viking longboat, this was a disappointing brew. It pours a nice cloudy amber and has a mildly hoppy flavor. You can also sense the power of the high alcoholic content, which most Belgian Ambers do not posses. Still, it does not overwhelmingly surpass other Belgian Ambers or IPAs in my opinion to warrant the costly price. A good beer nonetheless, but nothing I would buy again unless I was watching a pirate/Viking marathon on the History Channel.","ghscash","Dec 24, 2006"

I was surprised that the taste wasn't very alcoholic considering the 10.5% abv and the smell. Has a nice frothy mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation.

At the time ABV was a whopping 11.5%, which was unusual as it was very drinkable with the heavy alcohol way in the background, almost not present at all. Then ABV was brought down to 10.5%. This did not change the character of Piraat much. It was still a very enjoyable, nice sweetly tripel. Maybe this was the best version they made, and which I enjoyed on a brewery trip about ten years ago. Currently ABV is only a paltry 9.0%, a reduction that the beer did not survive. While still not a bad tripel it is now average, the taste having acquired a watery blandness that was not present with the previous versions. I now only purchase it if nothing else is available.","Regenpak","Sep 05, 2006"

One thing I do like about this one as opposed to some Belgians is how the head does not overflow quite as easily as many. Tons of lacing, typical of a Belgian... Sweet - citrus and pine definitely present. Alcohol noticeable but not overpowering like some beers of this high an abv or even lower. Very good. Flavorful, but smooth and mild. Pretty good. Similar to La Fin Du Monde, but less earthy and less overwealming. Not sure Id pay 11$ per bottle all the time, but not bad, definitely worth the try.","MrHurmateeowish","Sep 04, 2006"

The sweetness starts off fruity but reveals a more nutty and chocolately layer. Spiciness as well, perhaps a little clove. There's a little bit of apple/pear flavour in here too. Earthy hops try to balance out the sweetness, but the scales tip on the side of the more sweet and spicy notes. As I said before, not cloying in the least though. A lovely malty/yeastiness comes to light as the beer warms and it becomes more comforting. There's a lot of alcohol in this one, but it really serves to enhance all the flavours inherent here. Mouthfeel is near-perfect. Bites the tongue a bit but the flavours sparkle all over the tongue. A bit thick and so intense. So drinkable, a truly great sipping beer, and a classic Belgian.

My final thought was that the beer left me feeling like I had gargled with alcohol.

Nice lacing. High level of carbonation. Aromas of rich, sweet malts, yeast, grass and grain. Very fresh and lively smelling. Taste was quite good; flavors of malts, grain, dough, and yeast meet the palate in good balance, along with pineapple flavors and sweet citrus. Smooth aftertaste.

It has a great spicey yeast aroma, peppery with perhaps a little corriander, balanced with mild floral hop and sweet malt. The flavor is well balanced, slightly bitter with a good amount of sweet malt, with a wheat malt and yeast finish. The body is good, and it seems to hide the 10.5% well, this is a smooth beer.

The smell is quite complex:hops and belgian spices swirling in a harmonic blend that is very enticing. The first taste is delightful--cloves, banana, hops, that together with an underlying peppery backbone mask mischieviously the high alcohol content. I admit I was not sure I'd cotton to this combination, but it works, though I found the mouthfeel a tad too thin. Definitely a worthy choice.","longpondbeerman","May 29, 2004"

Great aroma of sweetness and fruits, lightly yeasty and citrus. Fresh tasting. Nice bite and alcohol taste to it which I do appreciate. The more it warmed the more I taste tart apples.

The finger's worth of off-white head quickly dissipates, though a fine lace clings aggressively to the glass. Yeast and grass scents are prounounced, as is a soft, peppery spiciness. Some underlying malt sweetness is detectable as well. Full, honey-sweet malt flavor gives way quickly to a massive wave of alcohol warmth and some peppery spice. While the warmth persists, it gradually yields to the grassy notes that are so noticeable in the smell. Full mouthfeel is sticky but not annoyingly, cloyingly so. A unique, interesting beer.","BitteBier","May 16, 2004"

It has a dry, yet fruity yeast flavor that is pleasant. It goes down easy for having such a high abv. . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation.

The taste is quite sweet and spicy from the interesting hopping that this beer has. The malts are a bit subdued, but lend a nice bready element to this beer.

As I quaffed a good amount of lace was produced. This is a fine looking beverage. The nose is plenty pleasant with fresh cut grass, hay, spicy alcohol and yeast, peppery, and fruity, it is a well-rounded nose, albeit typical for the style. The palate is wonderfully complex, grass, marijuana, pears, grapes, pepper, spice, and notes of wheat, apples, and hot candy yet sweet. This is an absolutely lovely drink; I cant help but sip and savor. The alcohol heat becomes great as it warms, oh it hurts so good! The hops bitterness is very noticeable on the back of the tongue, especially at the finish. Medium-full mouthfeel, this was surprising at how filling it was, modest and natural carbonation, what a very enjoyable quaff.

Also well noticeable is a dark spicyness and dark fruityness. The mouthfeel is fizzy while being a bit syrupy. I can't really say I would want another one after having just one small bottle of it.

The smell had a sweet honey and fresh lawn grass quality,with pleasant hop aromatics, subtle coriander, yeast, and a strong alcoholic component. I was very pleased with the taste and mouthfeel. The beer pulls in somewhat thin, but immediatly becomes silky and full, triumphantly carrying a parade of flavor onto the palate...a semi-sweet honey and candy-sugar backbone with notes of grass and pepper, finishing with a well-done cap of bitterness, which lingers on with the honey.

As far as drinking, I've got to say that the feel of the beer was better than it's taste, and that knocked the drinkability down. Not sure I would buy it again.","BillSempf","May 25, 2003"

3.85,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a rather dark golden color. I didn't know quite what to make of this beer from the get go. It has a wacky looking label with really no description of the contents inside. So, naturally it was time for an adventure. Piraat overall is a very drinkable trippel that leans more towards the dark trippel side. My main complaints about it is that its 10.5% ABV is VERY apparent, lacking a real balance. Additionally, it is very malty, which if you like that sorta thing is fine. Many do not, however. I was not disappointed in my purchase, however.","ChrisBowers","Apr 12, 2003"
4.3,5.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"My aroma was a nice mix of lemon with phenol/clove spiciness. Big full head, active bubble action from the bottom. Some lacing. Mine was less cloudy than others have described. Rather bright gold color. Flavor is explosive and intense. Not for the faint of heart (as beer flavor goes). Taste of alcohol is present throughout and lingers. Good mix of flavors with malt, spices, some mild fruitiness and a shot of bitterness too. Intensity of the drink makes this a sipping beer, but a nice ale smoothness helps it go down more easily. Some mild carbonation action with the drink. I like this quite a bit, including the goofy picture on the bottle.","garymuchow","Apr 05, 2003"

The aroma is light, with a bit of hops and maybe just a hint of citrus. The taste is mostly a malt sweetness, coupled with a strong alcohol note. There is a decent hops bittering in the finish, but this is all about sweet, fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is very rich and smooth, and the drinkability is good. I was surprised to see this was an IPA. It is a very good beer that malt lovers will enjoy.","aaronh","Mar 01, 2003"

Starts sugary, but the sweets are soon snagged up by a brutal alcohol bully and his sadistic hop sidekick; they're ruffians, sure, but troubled youth always has a softer edge that warms one's soul. Deep toasted golden fields under fleecy clouds edging a spritzy river of carbonation that's quick yet mellow and my mind lazed back for a picnic lunch of Piraat.","inebrius","Jan 12, 2003"

A very impressive head adorned a hazy golden liquid. As expected lacing was plentiful. I have tried to get in to Belgians and I think I can take em or leave em. This one was my favorite of the three I have tried. I know that's not a big sample but I really think they are not for me. This was a good brew though and I liked it more than this review leads on.

An impressive strong ale","ipogios","Dec 04, 2002"

Taste is equally intense, powerfully expressive malt palate followed by heaps of soothing sherryish alcohol notes and finishing up with a hefty dose of clean, strong hop bitterness. This is giant of a strong golden ale...drink with caution, this one hits hard!","beerluvr","Nov 02, 2002"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The pour a clear deep golden-orange color, the head is elephantine, spumous, with tons of lace. Nose is malt, citrus like, fruity, and quite pleasant. Top is reedy, the finish is mastodonicly acidic, sufficiently hopped, the aftertaste is malt dry and alcohol bitter. 10.5 ABV shows up as a nice warming sensation in the abdominal region (Belly Warmer). Another of those beers I like, but will need several samplings to average out the likes and dislikes.","Gusler","Oct 29, 2002"
4.35,7.1,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Lemon fruit and floral hop nose.  Hazy pale ale look with lots  of fine bubbles.  Lasting pale white head.Very smooth cream mouth.  Original alcohol tongue with bitter orange followed by a sweet finish with yeast notes of banana and pear.  The mouth is second to none.  The bitterness is up-front in this brew.  Very unique and complex with lots of complexity.  Quite drinkable for its 10.5 ABV.  The mouth alone is worth the price of admission.  As it warms the beer rounds in flavor.  Pop one open let it sit 10 min. and then enjoy!","frank4sail","Oct 15, 2002"
4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste starts off honey sweet, with a noticeable hop bitterness and a somewhat grassy aftertaste.  Medium-full bodied.  Not at all bad -- one of the more drinkable of Van Steenberge's ales.","mzwolinski","Oct 14, 2002"
4.52,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Hazy orange in hue, covered by a thick, dense, bumpy very well retained porcelain white head supported by copious bubbling.  Unripe pear hits the nose immediately, then is ceded by citrusy fruitiness comprised of sweet lemon and tangerine.  Lightly spicy, peppery alcohol and trace fusels are perceptible towards the end of the aroma.  Refined and appetizing aromawise.  Candyish sweetness hits the palate at first, then yields to citrus rind fruitiness and a drying combination of black pepper alcohol and bready grain.  Sweetness then reemerges, but takes on a floral, raw honey like character and when coupled with the subtle alcohol flavors a black licorice note surfaces mid palate.  Relatively full in body, but with a crisp, slightly dry mouthfeel that helps facilitate superlative drinkability.  Hop bitterness, although not assertive, superbly offsets residual sweetness.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet mix of fruity sweetness and pseudobitter alcohol brifely lingering on the palate.  Piraat is a delicious brew... Overall, it is akin to a Pale Strong / Tripel hybrid.  It's reminescent of a 50 / 50 mix of Duvel and Cinq Cents. Just a hair shy of the best of both worlds.  Unparalleled drinkability.","marc77","Oct 12, 2002"

4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"When I first had this beer compared with Duvel, Lucifer and a few of the other more balanced strong golden Belgian's, I found it to be aggressive and rough - with a bold sweetness, an apparent alcohol, and a rough edge of bitterness and acidity. I've since changed my opinion on that in so far as those qualities give it a bold, unique, character. There are times when you want something that will reach out and grab you! This is it! Beautiful deep gold with a bright white rocky head that holds. Nice, creamy mouthfeel that caresses and tingles. The aroma is huge, complex, fruity, spicy and sweetly malty. The flavor starts with a bright sweet malt, revealing some spice (coriander?) and light acidity, followed by a brash bitterness. Plenty of alcohol here. A very strong, highly flavored ale that tours your mouth and takes no prisoners.","NeroFiddled","Aug 19, 2002"

Pretty pleasant taste, the alcohol was not very apparent to me. Aftertaste is similar but noticeable. This is a special event beer to me, but it didn't have some characteristics that are off-putting to me. Glad I tried it, I think I prefer Gulden Draak...","ADR","May 24, 2002"
