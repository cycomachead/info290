"Color is amber/bronze and a bit cloudy. Huge white head with an amber accent. Smells like a sour beer, only a bit sweeter. A combination of different tastes, such as caramel, candied fruit and spices, gives for an incredible beer. Delicious."
""
""
""
"A really tasty strong Belgian ale, even tho i missed the targeted season by a month or so. Warms you up right away."
""
""
"Very easy feel with a bit thinner feel than the Reserva but perhaps a more drinkable beer."
"malt aroma with lots of fruit with a slightly boozey dark fruit flavor, mostly grape husk, fig and apple, somewhat slick mouthfeel, finishes pretty easy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very low spicing, caramel notes and biscuity malts make this like a caramel cookie. Hot as it warms."

"O - Very enjoyable and highly recommend, a little too sweet but ok"

"From a microbrewery. Oak-aged. It has a funny label of a drunk looking guy wearing a Santa hat with stars. I wonder what it means. It pours into a chalice with a nice creamy head. It looks dark brown, blurry. It smells like plums, licorice, brown sugar, some liquid bread, dark cherries. Medium body, medium to low carbonation, fruity in the middle and an explosion of flavors that hides the alcohol. This is pretty amazing."
""
"Overall: what a lovely beer. It is a bit too sweet for me, on balance, but there are too many good elements here to outweigh that factor. I think this is a great stab at a Christmas beer; big ABV and plenty of character, but not a big spice bomb. Dig it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is nearly as complex with a slight sweetness of fruit and candy. Definite notes of orange peel and cinnamon and allspice. Finishes warm and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and lively, but not too spritzy. Very good beer and recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Sweet malty flavours, again with a big confectionery character. Some noble hops remain along with a hit of booze. A little cloying."
""
""
""
"Foams a bit out of the bottle, pours a ruddy, leather brown body. Tight foam that's decent. Smell is Belgian candi, taste has much the same but has cinnamon more prominent. Carbonation is lively, good stuff overall."

"O- delicious. Nose is deceptive. Taste is remarkable. No alcohol presence whatsoever. Love what destruisse has to offer overall and this is a great treat. Reminds me so much of their neighbor in westvleteren just a few K away. Grab if you have the opportunity. DeS is so small we are lucky to have any in the US. Those in the know should be all over DeStruisse...Pannepot anyone? Miss my time there"

"7.4/10"

"It's a fine simple example, but it's also kind of pedestrian. Not my ideal Belgian big pale ale (tripel or not), and it seems like de Struise could have done better."
""
""
""
"Pretty good - a solid brew with excellent balance. Perhaps a tad too dry. The spices and herbs seem to have faded to the point where they cannot be individually discerned, but the overall flavour is pleasant. The alcohol is very well hidden, and contributes only slightly to the aroma/flavour. Not the most amazing Christmas brew in the world, but a decent, well-crafted beer. Worth sampling if you come across it."
"O - Getting old and a bit oxidized but still enjoyable. Not as good as their Pannepot but a nice treat at a real good price of $5.99 per bottle."
""
""
""
"Drink this while taking apart your Gingerbread house. I can only imagine how much spicier this would be fresh. At this point it's almost like an herbal tea. I really enjoyed the wine like character it had and the way the ABV was hidden. Probably one of the better ""spiced"" holiday beer I've had. But when considering the price I won't be buying this again."
""
"Overall: This beer was given to me last year's Christmas (2011) and served Christmas night a year later and without a doubt a beer worth aging and having again and again. Take your time and drink with pride. Salud!"
""
"O-a tasty sipping beer with the usual good blend of Belgian flavors"
"Dark orange/brown with an offwhite head. Nose is sugary, caramelized dark fruits, some candy syrup and some bready qualities. Taste has some Belgian yeast and spice notes, complex fruit and bready character and even some suggestions of a milder fruity liqueur. Medium heavy body, medium low carbonation. Alcohol is hidden."
""
""
"2011 vintage. I always feel odd when I don't know how to properly spell/pronounce beers. This one's just mean in that regard. It pours a clear sunrise brass-amber topped by over a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises mild fig, Belgian yeast, very light brown sugar, very light orange zest, and light caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with lots o' perfume-y flowers (seemingly lavender), pine resin, and plum. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a pretty solid BSPA, though nothing all that earth-shattering or anything. I'd be interested in trying a fresher one, if only just to compare the experiences."
"The body is medium with soft carbonation. Overall this one is going to down the drain. Complete fail."
""
""
"Despite being an ugly duckling of a beer, the taste is nothing short of amazing. It not only forms ""proper"" impressions in taste, but excells in the supple sweetness that makes Belgian-style beers magical. I just with it pushed further and challenged me to award it with even higher scores."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium in body and really sweet, it is like a hyperactive sweet tripel. You can taste the alcohol...for what it is I guess it is fine but for as expensive as this bottle gets, this is not a good beer. There are way better strong pales out there for half the cost and I won't be returning to this beer anytime soon."
"The beer is hazy and appears dark copper colored. Small head with little lacing. The aroma offers malt, sweet breads, yeast, caramels, rain. The flavor offers caramel and butterscotch candies with additional notes of Belgian yeast and bready malt. The beer is relatively light bodied with fairly low carbonation. Solid, but not quite as good as the Tsjeeses Reserva."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A reasonable beer. I don't mind the balance of yeast, malt, alcohol and earthiness here. It comes together fairly well."
""
"This is the 2010 vintage and pours a dark copper hue which leaves a creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is caramel candy,boozy alcohol,raisins soaked in brandy and fruitcake,the mouthfeel is full bodied and has tastes of caramel candy,fruitcake,marzipan,warming alcohol,cherries,spicy lemon and is finished nice and dry,overall its a nice drop full of interesting tastes and would love this at Xmas cheers.`"
""
"Overall this is a great beer. Pretty unique too, gets those lovely aged English Barleywine flavours with none of the cloying sweetness or booze, which while there does not detract from the beer. Then adds some of that funky cheesiness. Of course, pretty much everything De Struise makes is awesome so that should be expected."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, lot C/8/10. Pours cloudy golden orange color with a dense 2 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grape, pear, apple, herbal, floral, pepper, earth, citrus zest, and light funkiness. Some pretty nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of grape, pear, apple, pepper, herbal, earth, citrus zest, candi sugar, bread, honey, caramel, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, earth, herbal, floral, candi sugar, and honey on the finish for a good bit. Good amount of complexity in flavors; with a big malt forward profile over spiciness. No cloying sweetness at all as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 10%; with only a slight warming noticed on the finish. Very smooth to sip on for the alcohol level. Overall this is a very nice Belgian strong pale ale. Probably an older bottle as the spices are hardly evident. Quite enjoyable though regardless."
"Super interesting beer that is really difficult to deconstruct. Does become hard going towards the end though, with one definitely enough in a session."
""
""
"O: I would like to thank the stranger in the beer store who picked this up and placed it in my cart with the stern warning that I avoid trying this beer at my peril. It is, in fact, a magnificently constructed and executed 'Christmas ale', one whose strength lies in challenging conceptions of a Belgian Christmas beer -- who says they have to be dark? Highly recommended, despite the relatively high price point."
""
"Overall a very solid Belgian ale."
""
"O: not too drinkable due to high alcohol and unbalanced caramel."
"O: Meh. Far too sweet and uninteresting for my tastes. It's not awful, though... I think I've just had too many great ultra-dry beers."
"OVERALL: Really enjoyed this one. Struise makes a lot of good stuff, and this is no exception. I will also say that I enjoyed this one more than in the Reserva, as the barrel aging seems to have muted some of the complexities and mellowed it out a little too much. In the end, these were both fun to check out. Recommended."
""
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy dark orange amber. Light head and lacing. Light fruit and sweet malt aroma. Sweet fruits, leaning towards peach and pear flavors and a mild malt backbone. Faint spicing. Fairly mild flavored for the body and appearance. Flavors opened up and became more interesting as it warmed. Pleasant and somewhat different flavor for a BSPA. I will definitely buy this again"

"Overall: A really interesting brew, a bit one dimensional, but a nice dimension to be in. A solid holiday offering."
""
""
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a snifter, and it was a gusher. The beer was too heady, murky, lots of floaters. The aroma is spicy and sweet. The beer was too spicy for my liking, I could not place what spice it was, but there was too much of it. The beer had a lingering finish and noticeable heat. The body is medium, good carbonation, and noticeable alcohol. The spiciness was not for me."
"D - Yet another fine beer from this brewery. Looks good, the smells and taste are well balanced, integrated and transition sublimely, with the mouthfeel perfectly offsetting it all. What more can you ask for?"
""
""
"O - Glad I got to try this one. Little bit different from what I was thinking going into it. Thanks to sliverX for sending in the 10s=ME BIF."
"O: Flavors are quite good and feel is opulent ~ too bad for the cloudy fallout and a strong, but one-dimensional nose! I don't know how much time is 'right' for aging this beer but at 3+ years in the cellar and with over a year to go before the 'Best Before' date, I'll deem this ideal for drinking right now. Yep, my 'overall' is greater than the sum of its parts, but so be it... I see this around occasionally and gladly have one again!"
""
"pretty right on for the style, nicely made. i look forward to the reserva."
"This is a very rich beer which belies the strong alcohol kick. In a word: deceptive. Strong lightly sweet malt on the initial sip. This lingers through the aftertaste. Joining this is an increasing level of bitterness and warming alcohol. Still, this is a tale of sweet, barley wine-ish malt. If you like that style, you will likely love this."
""
"What?!?!? I've had this before and did not recognize this beer at all! I wasn't even close on the style. This is all kinds of crazy. Is there any wild yeast in here intentionally? I don't get many of the spices, but maybe they all come through as different flavors. This is an amazing blind beer. I don't get a ton of the belgian esters, but going back, I could see this with kind of a tripel/BSPA base. I do love me some Urbain beers, though. Cheers!"
""
"O: A different take on a Belgian Christmas beer, but still very enjoyable. Well made, I was glad to find this on sale post Christmas, because the regular $8 price-tag is none to pretty."
"Overall: BSPA are not my favorite style, that said this Struise rendition is absolutely delicious! I hope to have it again next Christmas, or if I am lucky the oak aged version."
""
""
"I'm usually not a pale ale fan but this was very good."
""
""
""
""
"Medium in body with light carbonation. Very drinkable...I could have gone for two of these. Recommended!"
""
""
"Overall this is a very strong, boozy holiday ale. I enjoyed it."
"Served in a tulip glass, this beer poured a slightly cloudy amber color mixed with ruby hues, and a foamy white head that receded quite a bit. Aroma of candi sugar, cherries, and wet grass. Taste of sweet malts, Bing cherries, grape skins, followed by some funky yeast and an appropriate dose of hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, and nicely drinkable."
""
"O: This is a decent beer. The bottle notes that this beer is brewed with herbs and spices, but I'm not picking up much in that regard. Perhaps the flavors have faded a bit over time. Seeing as how I didn't hate this beer, I'd like to try it again fresh... someday."
""
""
"Picked up this 2010 vintage at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Hazy amber-orange pour with one finger head, decent retention, nice lacing, and lots of floaties. The nose is very unique and hard to pin down. I'm getting sweet and sour notes with hints of orange peel, caramel, grass, and a touch of clove. As it warmed it really opened up. Very complex, spicy taste with hints of butterscotch, caramel, orange peel, lemon, apricots and alcohol. As with the nose, the taste really morphs as it warms. Slightly boozy, but it doesn't really hurt the drinkability. The finish is crisp and dry with a nice tangy, bitter bite. Headed to the O.B.E.R. Kerstbierfestival in a few weeks and can't wait to try this fresh. Another great offering from Struise!"
"I am usually not a fan of this style but, this beer is excellent. Very complex and balanced-so many different flavors going on but all meld together nicely. Usually the Belgian yeast just completely overwhelms everything else- not here though. The 10% abv is also very well hidden- another great beer from a great brewery."
"Overall, pretty interesting take on the style. My initial reaction was not overly enthusiastic, but I found myself enjoying it more as the bottle progressed. I would be interested to try it again, certainly."
""
"O: I don't know what happened here. This beer has been cellared properly for two years and things didn't really come together. Perhaps this was a bad bottle or maybe it was not handled as well as I thought it was. Regardless, this beer came off as a muddled mess. I'll revisit this one in the future to see if my impressions change."
"This thing is smooth and dry. Slight carbonation is present."

"The flavor has some caramel maltiness and honeyish sweetness, plus a distinct spicy character. A little cinnamon is in there, along with notes of candied fruit, akin to a rum-soaked Christmas cake. The finish is very dry, with some lingering bitterness. Still, an extremely flavorful, satisfying bier (though a touch pricey). Would love to have a few more of these for when the weather gets real cold around here. Prosit!!"

"This is an exceptional beer."
"O: Give me more! Delicious and complex, I see myself drinking this nightly in the dead of winter. Really outstanding."
"O: Very good Belgian Strong Ale. Defintely a sipper at 10% ABV."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, cinnamon, dark fruit, and some coriander. In the taste, cinnamon, sweet orange citrus, and coriander. A spice like bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. a nice mix of fruit and spice, and hides the ABV pretty well."
"O - This a good stuff. It s a complex thirst quencher that you can also enjoy after a good meal, in the morning, just out of bed, in the evening, at work etc. I just can't wait to try the reserva version."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-brown. Decent head which fades quickly and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is really interesting, and hard to describe. Hoppy and malty on the tongue, definitely tasting the spices as well. Alcohol warms you at the back of the throat. Overall a damn good beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden with some suspended sediment and a decent head that fades to a thin cap. Very sweet, with an explosion of orange juice, spice, and some alcoholic heat. tastes a bit like a spiced screwdriver. Very tangy, and a hint of orange peel bitterness is interlaced with the juicy and sweet malt notes- I swear I taste vodka here, very strange. Not exactly what I'm looking for in a winter beer, but interesting."
"Very interesting and quite good. It's labeled as a Belgian X-Mas ale brewed with spices. Luckily it doesn't have much in the way of ""traditional"" Christmas spices and they didn't go over board like most American brewers do when they make Christmas ales."
"O: a really good offering. I wish I would have bought more."
"o - overall, a quality BSPA, but not the best i've had. the spicing is certainly 'festive' for it as a xmas ale, but why not enjoy it in the dead of summer? booze is pretty well hidden and a tasty offering."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color with a finger of white foamy head that laces fairly well but doesn't retain well. The aroma has notes of earthy hops and caramel malt, as well as some floral notes. The taste starts sweet with floral and caramel notes and then has hints of oak and vanilla. The mouthfeel is nice a smooth and finishes clean. Overall a good unique beer."
"it goes down smooth. perhaps too smooth for the strength. pretty nice beer with 6 months age on it."
"O-One of the lesser Struise releases,but still a good one. Too expensive for what it is. Why is this close to $10?"
"Poured from two different versions of this brew (one with the ""stoner santa"" picture on the label and another ""cleaner version"" with santa wearing sunglasses) into a tulip glass. The pour is a clear golden/orange color with a very small layer of white foam that quicky fizzles away. Faint aroma of spices, floral, and sweet malts. Flavors are of caramel, orange zest, honey, Belgian candi sugar, and toasted bread. There is some alcohol heat to the brew. Medium-bodied with decent carbonation throughout. I was disappointed with this brew as I expected more."
"Overall this beer is very complex, strong and drinkable. It possesses the traits of an excellent Triple with a little something extra from very mild spices."
"O: Good but not my favorite. I was sort of let down by this, but such is life."
"Overall- When it comes down to it, I paid WAY too much for this 11.2 oz bottle of Belgian X-Mas Ale. The main reason for the purchase of this ale was that many people hanging out at the Stone Brewing sampling session have had this ale and suggested it. I enjoyed it all the way through and probably will never see a bottle of this again so am very glad I bought and enjoyed today. This Belgian is very strong and can say that its style is categorized well with Belgian Strong Pale Ale's."
"O- Overall this is a good beer. A nice spicy Christmas ale. My only complaint is that it is a shade bit too boozy-other than that soft, fruity, spicy and hoppy all at once. Well done overall."
"Pretty nice overall presentation, good one-off take on the style"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: As a holiday season spiced tripel I think this one works well. I’m finding each sip a pleasure to take and will be regret seing the end of the beer. I could see having this again from the next batch. My overall impression is of a well-made, imaginative beer that explores some new ground and does it quite well. However, I’m thinking this is not a good beer for aging in that with the eventual fading of the hop bitterness, what will remain is the sweetness. While it is a complex sweetness, if there isn’t a bit of bitterness to “terminate” it at the end the sweetness will probably be cloying."
"2010 Vintage, from the Struise Yeast Store. Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Lacing literally coats the glass. Really nice head retention. Smells of candy sugar, pear, apple with some Belgian yeast. A nice sweet flavour, almost no bitterness. I typically don't like overly sweet Belgians, but this seems to work really well. Smooth carbonation level. A very nice beer."
"D: Very good for a 10% ABV beer."
"Pours a beautiful hazy, golden orange into a maredsous chalice glass. Tastes of breaded malts with some fruits like pear, apple and apricot lingering in the finish. For a 10% alc beer, it drinks down pretty good and I detect no hotness. A very nice BSPA overall."
"Pours a dirty looking dark honey color with a very small 1/2 inch head that fades to nothing. Very little spotty lacing on the drink down. Smell is of dark candied fruits, sweet malt, and winter spices. Tastes of dark fruits, winter spices, sweet malts. There is an alcohol presence here at 10% ABV. Carbonation level is good and beer is a bit thick. Drinkability is good, especially for the ABV. The smell and taste are superb but I think I would only have one of these at a time."
"Nice orange color that is a bit darker than typical for the style. A decent amount of floral sweetness on the nose but not as much as I would have liked. The taste was outstanding and the stone fruit sweetness went really well with this slight bitterness. I wish more of this would have came through on the nose. The carbonation was nice and light providing for an overall great mouth feel."
"A clear orange-amber with a dense, white head, this looks good. The nose has stone fruit, honey, floral character and a mild sweetness. The palate has floral honey, some sugar, some peaches, pear and nectarine. This is really good fresh! Medium-light in body, medium-low in carbonation, this is excellent stuff."
"Deinitely made for those damp Winter days. The timing was just perfect."
"O- I like it, it's tasty, interesting flavor wise and interesting in the way it was brewed. It's not mind blowing, but it's definitely top quality and worthy of recognition."
"Interesting beer that works. Big malty base, caramel and loads of breadiness. Honey and apricot sweetness, light metallic dryness, hints of fruity esters, light grassy drying in the finish, cinnamon and cloves add a spicy note. Boozy and malty but somehow balanced out enough to call this drinkable. Creamy mouthfeel with just enough zip helps in that department. Nothing wowing but a well made sipper."
"D - This is a nice beer but the mouthfeel kills this. I can get past the taste as maybe it was due to the tapline but the mouthfeel is all the responsibility of the beer. A shame."
"Medium bodied, good drinkability. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D- too strong to want more than one. im glad i picked this one up on clearance. i enjoyed it, but i think that at the full $10/bottle price would have left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). i think i have liked everything i have tried from the sturdy brewers."
"Definitely a sipping beer, and at 10% abv. it is doubtful if you will want more than one at a time, but it definitely hits the spot on a cold winter night."
"Strong noble hop aromas mixed with a sweet fruitiness and some Belgian sugars and a touch of funkiness all rolled into one here with this brew... This has quite a bit of funky hay-like earthiness present in the flavors as well... Sweet and funk mixed tigether... Lingering dry noble hop presence on the finish as well... Pretty good example of the style but not upper echelon..."
"Drinkability: Very good beer but the high ABV would lead to a short ""session""."
"Medium bodied with a soft creamy carbonation up front which helps out the mouthfeel a bit. Hints of pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepermint countered by a slight medicinal feel as well as the berry and light fruit notes found in the aroma. The ABV is well masked and this one disappears from the glass quickly."
"The spices and the oddness combined make this a once in a while (like Christmas) type of beer to enjoy while listening to Coast to Coast AM."
"The flavours somehow blend into a fantastic tasting beer, each sip being slightly different from the last one. It is more of a 'barleywine' than a anything else, but whatever style you choose to put it in, it is a wonderful drink."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and malty feeling. Other that the alcohol in the flavor it is a pretty easy to drink beer."
"Heavy and not really inviting."
"If the flavor were more interesting it would be more drinkable, but it's not. The alcohol is forward enough that I'd never consider having more than one at a time and the bitterness is strong enough to reinforce that decision."
"Glad I tried it and would have again, just not at a bar, I gulped this quick and felt it. Strong beer here. I know some reserva jeesus is on tap in the area, now imma have to go find that. This is drinkable, yet a bit to big for it's own good. The taste is simple enough to fit style, but with a sweet kick."
"D: Once during the Christmas (or holiday) season is good for me. A very nice BSPA, but $8.49 for a 11.2 oz bottle is a little steep (for any beer)."
"D- this is an interesting brew and a nice treat on a cold night. A bug abv and towards the end you do start to fell it."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, with a solid amount of carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable and warms quite nicely as it goes down. Perfect beer to enjoy on this christmas eve, eve."
"Drinkability is OK, but the heavy bitterness and astringency overpower it, although the booze is typical for 10%."
"mouthfeel is fairly light, decent amount of carbonation. pretty enjoyable."
"Bright - somewhere in the land between Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a Trip. A bit fluffy with carbonation. Spices predominate, but not in a ""spices added"" sort of way - rather brewing process spice flavor. Not as much sweetness as I expected, with less Belgian Candy sugar notes than often encountered here."
"D: The alcohol is so well hidden at 10% that I could drink a few of these. It is a powerful BPA/Triple (according to the De Struise brewers), but one that I will visit repeatedly each year. Cheers."
"jd"
"Medium to light bodied with a modest level of carbonation. At times it seems a bit watery. Overall this brew seems a bit young with a green yeastiness playing a big portion in the flavor. I found this brew to be a bit ackward. Not much present in this brew to give it a real ""Christmas"" beer feel outside of the label. The young yeast taste mixed with the herbal flavors was a strange combination."
"Alcohol very well hidden. Nicely done!"
"D: very nice beer and very drinkable ,"
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a slight off white head. Good lace as the head settles. Caramel, spice, and a malty nose. Medium mouthfeel. Apricot like fruit like flavors along with some belgian yeast flavors. Lingering bitterness. No real alocohol notes prevalant. Overall, a tasty little beverage."
"Overall, not a bad trippel. I am definitely enjoying this one. A bit dry for me, but overall I like it and think it is fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability -- Great malty and fruity flavors, spicing is well-done, and the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. My only quip is the excessive amount of sediment that *never* settled down. Beyond that, it's a fabulous holiday beer from a brewery that seems to do no wrong."
"D: This is definitely a sipping beer given its strength although the alcohol content is well masked making this rather drinkable."
"Superbeer!!"
"This is yet another tasty and unique offering from the Struise gang, and for a holiday offering it's very different from the typical over-spiced, herbal winter warmer crap that roils me more than pumpkin beers. But I digress..."
"D - The sign of a quality beer that is full of flavour and aromas. Another top beer from De Struise."
"Served in an allagash flute, cloudy, murky orange brown. Smell has peaches, apricots, sour cherries and oranges but it has an overall dank muskiness to it, pretty interesting. Taste like a mixture of orange, peach, and cherry juice with belgian yeasty funk. Mouthfeel reminds me of orange juice slightly thick and a bit syrupy. Alcoho is well hidden making this easy drinking."
"Notes: Best before Dec. 2014. Another great beer from a great brewery. Sweet and spiced flavors mix around well along with the golden fruitiness. Wonderful beer that would drink well all year long. I would gladly drink this again and definitely recommend this."
"Bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Also sampled at Olympen, Oslo. ABV is 10%. Orange colour, moderate white head. The aroma has notes of Belgian ale yeast, some fruity and spicy notes, hints of brettanomyces / farmhouse. The flavour is sweet and spicy, noticeable hops in the finish. Quite good."
"2008 from the bottle. Medium head, significant carbonation, golden color. Sweet malt aroma and taste with slight citrus, spice notes...slight honey and clove. Nice brew with fun label and name. Sometimes you can find this on sale in Denver for under $7! More citrus than the Reserva."
"This would've really hit the spot in winter, but it's doing the trick here in May."
"What the hell style is this anyway? I first read ""blonde Christmas Ale"" somewhere. Hmmm, a 10% blonde ale. Called a Belgian Strong Pale here, and an Abbey Tripel on ratebeer. I guess it really doesn't matter, it's good! Super smooth, mellow, balanced and complex. A treat."
"Nice X-mas style brew, more of a night-capper."
"Drinkability: This is a ""one and done"" for me. No prolonged affairs. No need to rush it, this one is for savoring. Enjoy it after a good meal. It makes for the perfect nightcap."
"d - Not a bad Belgian. Nice body, but would have liked a little more of the smell and taste as bready malts dominated them. Would give another chance."
"Hmm, maybe I did a boo boo. Dint decant the bottle thereby pouring the yeastoids into the head and perhaps altering my perceptions. Anyway - Poured with a small to medium light tan head that mostly subsided and a little lace. Color is a cloudy (with chunks) medium to dark brownish amber. Nose is very yeasty, malt, spice, and a little vineous. Flavor's about the same with some citrus tang at the end. Real easy drinking and belies the strength. Great finish of the flavors. Round, mouth filling body and great carbonation. Easy to get schnockered on this. And happy to do so!"
"D: The alcohol makes itself known pretty quickly in both the aroma and mouthfeel...with some time for the alcohol to mellow, it could become far more drinkable."
"D - a beer to keep in an arsenal of Belgian standards. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly to a ring, leaving some lace. Hazy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Fruity, spicy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is fruit, spicy with a lingering sour fruit aftertaste. High ABV is hidden. Pricey at $9.25 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Another smooth drinker from Struise. How does Urbain do it? I've heard it's in the yeast..."
"D: Highly drinkable, dangerously drinkable as it is 10%. Well balanced, not what you would think as a Christmas brew, but it is a nice Belgian Strong. Definitely one to have a few of, or even just enjoy one."
"M/D - Very dry, light and crisply carbonated. Alcohol is well masked and this is one drinkable beer."
"D- at 10% abv this brew is meant to sip and enjoy. It isnt bad overall but the dry wheatiness of the character dropped it down a notch for me."
"Pours a hazy golden brown. I think that chunky is a good descriptor for the liquid. The head is a persistent white froth. The nose is yeasty and doughy, but dominated by fruits. Apricot, peach, and even red apple are present. There is also a very slight tinge of red wine vinegar and alcohol. It is slightly sweet with the pitted fruits coming through. The alcohol burns nicely, and there are lightly bitter and sour notes on the finish. We have a full body with a sticky texture. The carbonation is average and the finish is long. Overall, this is a very nice beer. The complexity doesn't really pull through on the palate, but I think that this beer will age well for quite a while."
"M - Thin, low carbonation, clean."
"With the exception of Struisse Witte, I have had nothing but outstanding beer from De Struisse Brouwers. Tsjeeses Belgian X-Mas Ale is a bold and beautifully spiced tripel that will almost certainly appeal to any Belgian beer lovers who are fortunate enough to make its acquaintance."
"Poured into a snifter with a finger thick head that shrinks to thin lace relatively quickly. Smells really good, lots of fruit, specifically pear and a hint of spice. The taste is strong of alcohol. The malt and yeast flavors are hard to detect because of the boozyness. The mouthfeel is normal for the style; maybe more carbonated than I would prefer. This beer looks and smells amazing, but the taste isn't that good. I'll try another bottle a year later."
"330ml, BBE 12/2014. Cap removal instantly releases bottle-trapped hoppy aroma. Everything less volatile than that goes into Karmeliet glass. Pouring produces half an inch thick bubbly white head that collapses creating a soapy film atop of murky pale yellow-orange fluid. Aromas are mostly hops followed by citruses, yeast and refined cane sugar with a touch of honey. Yeasty flavor with soft sweet malt supported hops and citruses creating an illusion of grapefruit sensation. Lots of hops in here resulting in long lingering bitterish aftertaste. I couldn't put my finger at any particular spice - this brew is all about quest for bitter-sour balance where hoppy bitterness always prevails over citrusy sourness, but that might change with time as the hops will lose aroma, flavor and bitterness as they age. The medium bodied beer is soft on the palate as its carbonation is bridled by viscous fluid. Absence of visible yeasty particles that Reserva abounds with and pronounced hoppiness separate regular Tsjeeses from his barreled brother. Oh, I didn't mention alcohol. Was there any?"
"D - Nice beer, but not sessionable in any real sense. Could see me trying..."
"330cl bottle, Lot B, bottled 9/09. In a snifter it was a hazy deep amber color with a small film of head. An aroma of fruit and spice. The taste was orange, with cinnamon/clove/pepper flavors. The peppery taste persisted for quite some time, and made the mouthfeel a bit on the harsh side. Enjoyable enough, but one and done for me."
"D: A drinkable beer. I don't really see what makes it a Christmas brew, but it is a tasty beer."
"D: this is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer--although you definitely become aware of the alcohol content when you stand up to get another. Will try to get back to the store and buy what is left on the shelf as it is likely limited-time available."
"The brewers insist that the name Tsjeeses (loosely pronounced as ""cheeses"" or ""Jesus"") is meant more as an expression of stupefaction than a curse - I can see why. This is a beer so well crafted that I wouldn't scoff at the idea of placing it up there amongst Belgium's best Tripels and Golden Ales. With offerings like this it's no wonder people have begun making the pilgrimage to Vleteren to see the messiah they call Tsjeeses, err, I mean Urbain."
"D: It was very special to drink this one with the master himself. Thank you Urbain!!!"
"D - Ho ho ho! What a good Belgium pale with spices. Hoppy Holidays!"
"Hazy peach tan color with a light, white head. Smell is Belgian and fruity sweet--yeast and alcohol are prominent. It smells at least as hot as its 10% ABV suggests. Tastes that hot, too! You know you're getting your full serving of alcohol with this one--it damn nears knocks you on your head! Taste has notes of bread and jam. As a Belgian strong pale ale, it is somewhere between a Belgian strong ale and a tripel. Almost makes me think of a blend of Maudite and La Fin du Monde--though it's more mellow than each of those. It may just be me tonight, but despite the apparent high alcohol content of the first few sips, it's going down quickly--a nicely drinkable winter brew! Goes great with the cheese, crackers, and deli meat I've paired it with."
"Drinkiability is good here. This is a damn good beer for such a high abv drink."
"Something of a disappointment really..."
"I would prefer more of a statment. Go for the fruit/malt or go for the bitter. This one is not balanced sufficiently to really be a pleasing drink."
"Pours a lovely hazy golden amber with a lot of tiny goobers floating in it and a VERY thick just off white head. Aroma is mainly yeasty with spicy and floral hints. Flavor is yeasty and fruity and a little spicy - mainly cinnamon - with a good strong alcohol bite. Texture is smooth and quite fizzy. Happy Holidays!"
"edited - had again with Urbain at De Struise and my score is higher."
"D - Really this is a 10% ABV beer? Can't tell well hidden really liked this one will search out more."
"Also has a subtle honey sweetness with a real creamy head and body that follows it through to the end. Some spices come through on the back end, followed by a grainy, somewhat dry malt that allows the beer to flow through uninhibited."
"D- This is exceptionally drinkable, despite the 10% ABV! The only thing keeping this from being a perfect 5 on the drinkability scale is the knowledge of high alcohol levels and the inebriation to follow with over-imbibing!"
"This is terrific stuff."
"D: WOW. 10%? This doesn't taste like it has any alcohol. Very drinkable in that regard. But I'm not sure I'd love the flavor all night long."
"MF&D - the feel was a bit thick if anything, coupled with a low carbonation level, or maybe one that is just not very crisp, made the brew seem even thicker. the drinkablity for such a high abv brew"
"If my wife wants to buy me another I gladly drink it again. I might even buy one myself"
"Overall: What is happening this evening, do I start to like triples? My second tripel this evening, and the one second I feel in love with. So many taste-layers, fantastic. Highly recommendable!"
"Draught at The Trappist. Had this side by side with Pannepot, and was surprised to find that I liked this much better. Amazing beer and the best tripel that I""ve had yet. Orange-gold with a creamy head. Incredibly expressive fruity aroma with lots of peach, pineapple, apricot and apple, along with some yeasty spiciness. The flavor is just an awesome balance of fruit, spice, and alcohol. Medium bodied with smooth bubbles. I""m dying to try the reserva now"
"D: Drinkability was decent while the enjoyment factor was good. Very boozy and delivers quite a bite makes this a slow winter sipper. The 10%abv is well noted and will keep your humble throughout the course."
"Overall I was impressed with this beer - a good attempt at a lighter Christmas beer. Worth a shot."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours an almost opaque copper with a fluffy white head. Loads of sediment. Smells quite bready and yeasty. Apple esters and a lot of spice. Taste is also heavily malty with strong yeast character. Apple/brown sugar and spice. Sweet, slightly boozy finish. Medium-thick, creamy body with good carbonation."
"More delicious beer from De Struise, quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries, Belgian or otherwise. I cannot wait til they are brewing authentic Belgian beer in Maine. Awesome. For now, I'll settle for the imports, happily. Pours a rusty amber with a good ring of white head, dies relatively quickly. Nice aroma of fruits and spices, raisins. Flavors here all meld together quite nicely. Lots of spiced rum and fruit flavors, a bit hot, almost like what I would think a Belgian barleywine to be, which kind of makes sense as this I guess is an interpretation of a winter beer, or seasonal, although I've seen it around all year. Sticky, thick mouthfeel. A nice strong sipper, would be excellent on a winter night but is quite ripe right now in the spring."
"Taste is complex and varies between fruits: orange, pear, peach, kiwi...wow. Some heavy spicing going on here as well. Nice solid backbone to this one as well, some candied ginger round out a medium bodied beer that is bigger than I expected. Dry but strangely metallic on the finish, one is plenty for me for tonite. This is an extremely interesting, well balanced beer. Enjoyable but slightly bothered by the aluminum foil on filling finish."
"Tsjeeses is a pretty good beer that could be very, very good beer with a couple of small tweaks. Tone down the sweet flavor and the abv. This beer would be more than good at 8%. It's just too much as it is. Despite those two gripes, it still manages to be a pretty good beer. De Struisse has done better, but it's still far from bad. It's definitely worth picking up, even if only once. Thanks, Brady."
"I'd have this more often if it wasn't so darned expensive, oh well."
"The mouthfeel is medium-to-full with a fairly dry finish. There is a lot of carbonation present. This is a very drinkable Belgian spice beer. I could easily enjoy a pint, and possibly two."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: A light body with medium carbonation."
"Another fine ale from De Struise. Pours a glowing cedar color with a creamy white head that settles to a thin cover. Nose is quite complex with ripe fruits, rich candy malts, peppery Belgian yeast, well balanced spices, honey and tart citrus. Taste is also quite rich. A delicous blend of sour fruits, sweet bready malts, spices, subtle hops and funky yeast. Medium to full body is well carbonated. Good stuff, very unique."
"I enjoyed this one a lot and the extra little bit of spiciness differentiates this one from some of the other Belgians I've had lately. Very drinkable for the ABV, which is barely detectable."
"Really one to savor and enjoy. Wow, I'll be back for more next holiday season."
"12oz bottle on sale for $7, Jesus is smoking...It smells spicy and herbal sort of like a fantome. Its got a dark orange color and yeasties floating throughout despite a sincere attempt at a careful pour. Tastes like I don't know what, good but spicy and mysterious (again reminds me of a fantome)."
"Drinkability- Uh. Not bad, not great. It's just kind of an overly sweet brew that looks beautiful, smells so-so and tastes so-so. It's a bit much for my tastes. Add another to the list of Winter Warmers that I didn't much enjoy."
"Drinkability- Either I'm sensing sweetness a bit too much lately or I've just got a run of really sugared brews. This one works better than some of the recent ones I have had though. A bit steep at the $7 or $8 I paid for it."
"An exemplary beer. Delicious."
"Tasty but not likely to buy again at $10."
"The label controversy is a joke, but the beer inside is anything but. It's not as much blended as notched together creatively and with a healthy spirit. It speaks of spice, and while clove is the only obvious culprit, it's the crisp close that mitigates a muscular ABV. So have no shame, take off those glasses, and let the partay begin."
"despite the astringency in the feel, this is quite drinkable for 10% ABV"
"Pours peachy golden with very white topping, and lace on the way down. Some spiciness in the nose, and certainly in the taste, as cinammon and sugar and cardamon impart sweetness. Livey carbonation that adds to mouthfeel. Quite tasty and drinkable, dangerous 10% that feels and tase a bit boozy.Pricey bottle from Premiere Gourmet."
"330 ml bottle acquired in a trade as an extra, thanks who sent me this but I cannot seem to remember right now, consumed 12/28/09, poured into a Stone pint glass, reviewed from notes, color is a vibrant golden orange, 1 1/4 inch creamy white head that stays around for close to ten minutes, some lacing, aroma consists of lots of fruit, particularly oranges and tangerines, also spice, honey, alcohol, pear esters, and light caramel, taste is very citrusy with a big peach welcome, some malt in the middle, dates and oranges make up the finish with a alcohol kick in the aftertaste, more sweet as it warms which turned me away towards the end, mouthfeel is too sweet, needs dry qualities to balance out the large amount of fruit, medium bodied, moderate carbonation, taste lingers a long time, could not finish the bottle and could not see myself being able to, alcohol is there too which does not help things out, not my favorite Struise beer, looking forward to trying the reserve version to see how much the barrel aging tamed down those aggressive citrus notes, would drink again and was quite unique, worth checking out"
"Notes: Worth a try. Reminds me of Gouden Carolus Rood, except good."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a pretty high amount of carbonation, though thin considering the strength."
"Not my style (yet)"
"Pours a pale golden color with considerable haze and lots of floaties. Bubbly white head dissipates to a cap and leaves minimal lace. Smells of nutmeg and cinnamon, very sweet and fruity, lots of brown sugar and dark fruits mixed with some Belgian yeast funk. Flavor is heavy on the yeasty funk side with a spicy fruitiness that finishes kind of dry. A bit of alcohol and fruit on the finish. Taste is both sweet and sour at different times. Really complex and hides the alcohol really well. Mouthfeel is creamy, carbonation is ample, body is medium to thick. If this one tiny bottle wasn't 8 bucks I would drink this more often. Great brew."
"of the christmas beers this year this one really stood out as something great. pours a cloudy light amber, heavy with sediment. smell is ginger bread, doughy yeast and complex fruit. citrus. taste is substantially yeasty, beligian sugar, coriander candied orange peel, licorice, dates. actually quite meaty saison licorice... as it interacts with doughiness. but not astringent at all. rotten pineapple hop with a nice blended triple style sugar finish. great beer will have again... wish it was a bit cheaper though it being 8 buck a 330ml. so right... merry christmas to the drinker."
"d: This wasn't much to look at, but it has it where it counts. Unique and well worth trying."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"For a high abv, it was hardly noticeable. Very easy to drink, sipper for sure. Glad it was in a snifter or I would have sucked it down pretty fast."
"The beer was a moderately cloudy orange, tending towards amber. The smell was wonderful, full of spice and yeast flavors. The taste was complex and up front without being overpowering. It was a very easy beer to drink and my glass was empty before I wanted it to be."
"D: Not bad, I think I like this more than the others I tasted it with."
"D: the alcohol is very well hidden but you can definitely feel it by the end of the bottle, this beer is very complex and one of the more unique and interesting Christmas beers I've had. Another example of why Struise is in the vanguard of modern brewing"
"Solid De Struise offering - a nice seasonal to mix things up with."
"drinkablility: good"
" Body is light and airy, yet not foamy - it's just perfect to convey the myriad flavors held within the beer. Even though this is billed as a 10% winter ale, it goes down very easily, and is a pleasant change from the usual slate of dark, over-spiced holiday ales."
"Overall - An outstanding strong pale ale... one of the best Belgian brews i've had for quite a while..."
"Rusty orange color, tan foam initially that fades to a skim later on. Tiny dark suspended particles. Candied fruit and alcohol in the aroma, which can be overlooked as a ""Belgian X-Mas Ale"". Strong rich flavors, caramel, stewed fruit, very mild spice level. Alcohol seems to be lurking at the edges, reinforcing that this is a slow sipper. Dry finish with lingering fruit in the aftertaste. Some vegetal hop character that I can't really endorse or veto, it reminded me of a homebrew I had once, but not in an amateur sense at all. One and done, this was worth a try."
"Pours a fully clouded brown hued orange. Thin white head. Nose is a touch of honey, melon, sugar, and sweet tones. Flavor bring a thick level of spices, sweet tones, and a bit of honey. But the sweetest side rides highest here. Feel is pretty smooth on the liquid and fairly low on the carbonation. This is a nice ale, but if you don't like the sweeter Belgian ales, you probably won't be able to appreciate this as much."
"Fine and dandy full bodied with big carbonation that matches the style nicely. Good alcohol bite on the finish. Middle is all fruit and spice. Cherry, berry, and citrus make for a pecuilar combination. Tingles on the toungue. A great christmas treat."
"Pours a nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some bannanas, licorice, coriander, clove. The taste is malty/yeasty, slightly sweet, with some bannana/licorice notes, with some spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, quite different."
"I picked up an 11.2oz bottle at Champane's in Warren for $6.99 (never seen it anywhere else to date). The label shows a stoned guy in a Santa hat, it couldn't be Jesus, there's no way it's a picture of a stoned Jesus, but with the name ""Tsjeeses"" I'm starting to think it's Jesus after all. The beer is completely hazed dark orange color, lots of sediment on the bottom. It might have been less hazy if I didn't pour it all in one go. The head was composed of big bubbles and receded within 30 seconds. The smell is very Belgian, with sweet candy, yeasty esters, and some cough syrup. It reminds me a little of Carolus brews' aromas. The taste is sweet and a little alcoholic, lots of fruits in the after-taste. The bottle claims spices, herbs, and noble hops, but I couldn't pinpoint any spices with accuracy. Mostly this is a strong pale ale, very Belgian in character, not the spiced christmas beer as I was expecting. The body is very thick and syrupy, and combined with the evident ABV this is a sipper. Final judgment = good beer, too expensive though."
"Overall pretty good beer. Hazy cider color with an unappealing suspension of yeast particulate (guess I overpoured it). Fairly prominent foamy head. Smells of tart fruit and spices. Tastes more of the same - apple, grape, honey. Mouthfeel is fairly thick but ample soft carbonation prevents this from being syrupy. Pretty good drinkability factor on this one despite the ABV. My biggest knock is the exorbitant $9 I spent for this bottle. This will be a once a year treat for me."
"Drinkability- Great, however alcohol will sneak up on you, and good god was this pricey."
"Very impressive, I would say."
"This is a standout beer."
"D - Interesting, complex beer. Very well balanced. Nice combination of sweet candied fruits with sour lemon, apple brett like quality."
"Drinkability is really good, wow! I was so busy enjoying this, I realized I hadn't been typing much of a review. In fact it's so good, that I'm not going to bother disceting further and just enjoy. ABV is well hidden. Unique for a Noel, I dig the fact that it's a pale and not overly spiced. They could have called this a Belgian IPA and it would be a standout in the category. Still, like most De Struise offerings, it's over-priced, but on the lower end of their spectrum at least."
"After a careful not to disturb the sediment pour.But with just enough umph to try and get maximum head, I get no head. Just a little quick foam in my Goose Island wine glass. Lovely nectar of life colored amber with quite a bit of suspension in their too. Can't see any bubling though. Very yeasty fruits in the nose with a little swirl. Some mangoey like hop characteristcs swirl around their as well. Tropical fruits abound at the forefront of the taste of this beer. The finish is a little dry and bitter. Some of those Brewers' Gold hops shining through I suppose. Long, yeasty linger after each sip too. Dry, fruity palated beer with a bit of chewyness."
"Pours a nice orange golden with big fluffy white head that disovles. Smells of yeast, orange, ginger? other spices. Tastes of citrus, little alc. noted. Nice balance. Good amount of carbonation, yet a slight creamy body to it. Extremely drinkable for a 10% alc. Nice xmas treat."
"It was great with pork as well as bleu cheese. Had great expectations for this brew and was very pleased. Rather expensive at $10.99 for a 330 ml bottle."
"Golden bronze colored ale, with a beautiful head of white creamy foam. Flavor is elegant and well structured, loaded with depth and nuance. Very sweet, well layered and complex, with well concentrated flavors from start to finish. Notes of peach and pear. Elegant mouth fell. Purely Belgian in every way. Wow, wow, wow. STUNNING."
"I don't like my Christmas Ales overly spicy, so that's probably why I enjoyed this beer so much. The only thing that hurts this beer is the price. It was expensive on draft and it's expensive in a bottle. You don't much for your money. Is it worth the hefty price tag? Yeah, I would say that's it worth a shot if you can find it. This beer would make for a great Christmas treat."
"T/M: Nicely carbonated. Very smooth and slick with a hinth of prickliness. Taste is similar to the nose with lots of honey and nutmeg, cinnamon, orangepeel, fading to a nice malty sweetness and then a bready ness. Finish has some hops coming through."
"Tsjeeses pours an awkward orangey, brown ruby burgundy color, thick with small suspended floats and a small peachy white head. Very winey in the nose, grape skin, green apple, orange peel, fresh earthy hops, sweet alcohol soaked grain and evergreen. Alcohol heat is pretty pronounced in this one, but it also allows the herbal, leafy hop character to take center stage, it too becomes dominant, shoving the malts into the passenger seat. Subtle wintery pepper spice and estery yeast is not over done, but i wish the sweetness of the malts was more apparent. Tsjeeses is a sipper for sure and most definitely a holiday treat, i still felt yearning for more of a 'wow factor' after the 9$ glass was through."
"D: Would drink this all the time if it wasn't so damn expensive. Paid $9.99 for one 330cl bottle."
"330 ml bottle from the Bayou. Pours out a cloudy orange color with a small white head. A very nice aroma of apples, some spices, and a lot of woody notes. The taste was very nice; sort of a warm and mellow brew, citrus flavors, apples, a dry yeasty flavor full of mellow barrel aged aspects. Very enjoyable. As it warmed it was much more flavorful and fruity. Drink it at 12 degrees maybe more. A fizzy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable."
"Overall a very solid, and very different take on the holiday Belgian ale. I really enjoyed this one as I felt the hops were rightfully placed and no where near overdone. Smooth and rich, I am going to have to go buy another one of these as quick as I can!"
"Bottle. Pours hazy orange with an average, fizzy, off-white head, somewhat lasting with fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (bread, cookie, biscuit), light hops (flowers), heavy yeast (barnyard, earth) with notes of apple, pear, and honey. Full bodied, creamy texture, lively carbonation, and a chalky finish. Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness."
"A very nice beer for those cold winter-evenings. Mesa likes!"
"D: Really very good. I really had to hunt hard to detect any of the supposed 10% that this baby is packing. Pretty dry and crisp, yet quite juicy and sticky. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Taste is brrrr.. oxidized, cardboard whiffs. I have to be strong. Underneath here is a good beer, or need I say was? Very spicy with bitter orange zest and other bitter spices. Warm alcohol is not helping drinkability. Malt is thin and I suspect a good addition of sugar. This is probably a good beer when fresh, but De Struise Brouwers need to keep an eye on oxidation during brewing."
"Pours a very nice hazy copper, plenty of sediment, an average size white head recedes to a ring. Aroma is refreshing blend of straw, grass, honey and wheat sweetness a bit of lemon tartness and citrus fruits, some spice as well. Flavor follows with lemon and apple tartness blending nicely with a honey like sweetness, peaches mid taste and lead into the dry grassy hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a bit of weight from the sugars, carbonation is on the lighter side but is somewhat sharp, peppery and dry feel in the finish. A very interesting beer, quite tasty and very well balanced for its strength."
"Bottle courtesy of fonefan: Poured a deep dirty beige color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention and some great lacing. Aroma of fruity (peach) ester with a spicy peppery yeast. Taste is also a mix between the very nice fruity ester and the peppery yeast with a dry hoppy finish. Body is full with limited filtration and great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Maybe a touch too sweet for my personal tastes but a very good example of the style nonetheless."
"Sampled at the Kierstbierfestival in Essen, Belgium a few weeks back. The beer poured a bronze color into my snifter with a slight off white head. There was a port like nose to the beer, high abv aroma. The taste was pretty hot, alcoholy but not to the point that it was all I got. The taste was also a bit citrusy with some grapefruit and a touch of sweetness as well. A very interesting beer that I am glad I got a chance to try."
"An interesting beer, and definitely an interesting take on a holiday beer; one usually sees heavy, sweeter malt character in these types of beers. The simple malt character is actually quite nice and accentuates a different side of the spices than one usually sees in a holiday beer. At times the spice notes and the fruitiness seem like they should be disparate, but they are not; in fact this beer is quite well integrated, quite complex & most definitely tasty. This beer is really growing on my as I slowly work my way through this 330ml bottle."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spicy, sweet up front with tropical notes swirling along the palate."
