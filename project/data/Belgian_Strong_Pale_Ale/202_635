Pours dark amber with a slight haze under a 1‚Äù tan tinted white foam cap that produces delicate lace. Rich malt flavors introduce the palate with traces of caramel, light malts, a faint hint of chocolate, and a trace of anise with a little brown ale character. The beer is fairly sweet throughout and may be cloying to some. The balance leans more towards the malt than yeasty esters. The carbonation is medium low with a medium full body.","pat61","Mar 13, 2015"

3.83,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Pours a clear reddish orange with two fingers of fluffy cream colored foam, settles to a thin ring, splotchy sheet of lace for the first few inches. Smell: raisin bread, sugary, overripe stone fruit note, lightly medicinal and spicy. Mildly alcoholic and a little underpowered. Taste: candy sugar, raisin, dried apricot, overripe plum; clove, grass and pepper notes. Medium-full bodied, lightly syrupy with low but quite creamy carbonation.

3.86,2.4,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,4.25,"Thanks to an awesome bartender at Liberty Tap Room in Mount Pleasant, SC, I was able to take home one of their iconic Kwak wood-handled beer glasses. It might be a gimmick, but it absolutely adds to the experience. I'm hoping the bottled variety is as delicious as I remember from that trip to the tap room. The cloudy, tarnished copper liquid pours with a tremendous amount of foam. Maybe part of it is the shape of the glass (with the spherical bottom) but either way, that's a lot of foam! As it settles down there's splotchy, soapy lacing on the glass. The aroma bears a strange metallic scent, like a handful of pennies, with traces of banana. A little buttery toffee in the nose too. The flavor is sweet and malty with a hint of clove bitterness. It's a tad cidery, imparting a tangy flash of flavor. There's a buttery, honey sweet bread-like taste that reminds me a little of sticky buns. A little funky Belgian yeast and fruity banana esters in the finish. The alcohol here is thinly veiled, lending a boozy solvent-like layer. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, with medium body and carbonation that may be a touch too lively. In total, this is a tasty Belgian strong ale that lacks some of the finesse and character of its contemporaries. Not quite as refined as some of the others I've tried, but delicious nonetheless. Perhaps if they put as much work in to the beer as the glass, it would be world-class.","JohnnyI","Jan 11, 2015"

It pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of cream foam.  The nose comprises candied orange peel, Belgian yeast, clove, light dry caramel, light grass, and a bit of vague breadiness.  The taste brings in more of the same, the Belgian yeast really driving through some fruity and spicy notes to balance out the caramel-laden biscuit residing throughout the background.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a solid BSPA, one that has earned its place as one of the constant Belgian offerings at nearby watering holes.","TMoney2591","Dec 03, 2014"

In the middle there is an attempt by the hops to come out and play but the yeast notes and malt notes and now some sweet boozy notes hold out and finish strong. The body feels smooth with lots of fine carbonation. Just right for a big Belgian Ale.","generallee","Jul 20, 2014"

Aroma is instantly boozy, a little grainy, with some raisin and nutty/spicy Belgian yeast notes apparent. On the palate, delivers some toffee, banana peel, dried plum/fruit roll up, cherry, and shortbread cookie flavors although everything is rather subtle, with some coarse alcohol overshowing the proceedings more than I would like. Medicinal clove and cinnamon oil flavors build over time and I get some minty wintergreen or something in the dryish boozy finish. Well-attenuated body and drinkable in this regard, on the fizzy side. Does not reach the lofty heights of some of its countrymen but worth sampling on tap. Do not be entirely dissuaded by the gimmicky glass. Does feature the expected estery/phenolic Belgian yeast profile and not super sweet.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 12, 2014"

Like the numbers say, outstanding in every category, I only didn't bump some categories up a bit because I feel it's almost more like a tripel than it's labeled variety. If you come across it I'd suggest a taste (especially if in a bar where they serve it in it's proper glassware and wooden holder (google pictures of it)- just be ready to get judgmental glances from MCB diehards, and maybe some BA's too).","1000lbgrizzly","Sep 28, 2013"

3.88,2.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/11/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, honey, caramel, toast, bread, clove, herbal, floral, pepper, light banana, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, raisin, caramel, honey, floral, clove, toast, bread, light banana, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, raisin, caramel, honey, toast, bread, clove, floral, light banana, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity.spicy yeast esters; with a large malt presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian strong pale ale. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with a sizable malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable sipper.","superspak","Jul 24, 2013"

As far as Belgian ale, this one holds it's own compared to Zotish style ale. It is middle of the road for good Belgian ales, but definitely drinkable. Not overly complex, a little caramel, banana and slight nutty finish, reasonable alcholol cover and slight sweetness. This is the kind of beer to drink, enjoy and not worry about style or flavor, on the other hand, quite fun to enjoy the Pauwel Kwak drinking system, which is like no other, one reviewer called it a mad scientist contraption, I would say interesting and make sure you don't embarrass yourself pulling the round bottom glass out of the wood stand to sip, pay attention and use your ingenuity figuring it out.","JimTeal","Dec 25, 2012"
3.85,2.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Final Grade: 3.85, an excellent B+. Pauwel Kwak makes for a worthwhile tipple, though as far as Belgian pale ales go I wouldn't consider it a particularly exceptional offering. I'd be hesitant to place this stuff on the same tier as my favourite BSPAs (Duvel and La Chouffe), but it's still a quaffable strong ale in its own right, with higher drinkability than average. If you're looking for an affordable strong Belgian pale to enjoy this winter, Kwak fits the bill nicely.","thehyperduck","Dec 25, 2012"

However, the smell and the taste for this just paled in comparison to other strong Belgians. Not much else beyond a hop scent, and the taste left me wanting more.

Poured from bottle undated to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a fairly clear amber color with a decent 1.5 finger white bubbly head with some retention and lacing. The nose is a disappointing mild caramel sweet character. Perhaps a hint of belgian yeast but nothing else really to report. The flavor is a little more impressive as the caramel malt sweetness blends well with the belgian yeast and provides a pleasing flavor. Mildly bitter with little hop character the beer is rather sweet and mild. Finishes crisp and clean and sweet. Well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall, nothing special really but not terrible.

Overall, the beer is drinkable, and if you like the belgian style, you will probably agree, and it packs a punch (though not like the beer called ""Donkey Punch"" that I had a few years back at Charlotte Octoberfest). I am confounded by the style category this was given, it doesn't seem to match up at all with the characteristics listed for a strong pale ale, or at least my idea of a pale ale. Seems more of a dark ale or dubbel, but I don't drink the Belgian styles often, so I am still trying to figure it out. Give it a try. It can't hurt.

The clove/spice idea dominates the fruit introduction as it works over your taste buds, but it finishes weakly with an odd, sweet but watery licorice summary. Not my favorite but not bad if you like licorice somewhat unbalanced in your beers. Moderate drinkability.","Durge","Jun 02, 2011"

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but was not awe-inspiring in any way. I know that some people swear by this beer, but I just don't see it.

Very crisp, almost grassy aromas- reminiscent of hayfields or being out somewhere on a meadow. Taste was fresh and somewhat bitter, with some subtle tartness in the back of the sip. The beer has strength, but you can't really tell when eating. Goes great with food, especially with mussels in a creamy bacon sauce.

Here, however, everything robust about it is laid out in the start of the sip, which is certainly interesting.

Aroma was rather weak, but I could still find some pears and apricots hiding in there, plus a strong belt of honey and some graham crackers (plain, not cinnamon, and not that cheap crap from Trader Joe's, either). Very smooth body with just a little thickness to provide some resistance; low carbonation as expected. Quite balanced in the taste: pumpernickel bread, cherries and apricots, more honey and a fistful of carmel malt. Nothing was terribly overpowering, yet I could taste everything distinctly. Low hop content and relatively high ABV makes this a nice thing to sip slowly while watching a Bogart movie, which is what my wife and I did. Well worth the expense and the uncorking effort.","gfreed","Mar 27, 2010"

No real alcohol in the aroma, despite the ABV, however, it is present in the taste. The taste itself is semi-sweet, with a distinct peppery and hop bitterness. Some warming.

There is a ton of chunky business in the brew but otherwise clarity is good and the carbonation is minimal. The aroma is a bit grainy, with a mild raisin sweetness. It gives me the impression of biscuit in the malt character, which is not my favorite aroma. The flavor is mild grainy biscuit with a more mild raisin sweetness that is accentuated with a touch of caramel. I'm not real thrilled with the flavors here. Mouthfeel is light with a very light to absent carbonation. I think the lack of body and carbonation really detracts from the brew. Overall impressions of this one are pretty low.

It is like a small yard glass with a bulbous part at the bottom and a bell mouth at the top connected by a long shaft but attached to a crazy wooden handle that you use to place it on the table and grab it for drinking. It had a light amber body with a thick foamy white head. The aroma was sweet and malty with a bunch of fruity yeasty esters. The flavor is equally sweet and malty, but with a flatness only broken by a bit of wheatiness at the back of the palate.

Not too much alcohol in the forefront on this one, given its strength. Definitely one you could sip (note ""sip"") all evening.

Clear, topped with a creamy dull white head, at first a perfect size, but then receding to a thin layer. Lace that does not seem to go away, sticking tenaciously to the sides of the glass. An attractive beer, glassware notwithstanding. Curious, the very first time I had Kwak, I smelt salmon on the initial smell. I still do: there is a salty fish aroma up front, equally appetising as not, but very unique. I definitely get a great deal of salinity in this beer however, perhaps more than any other I have tried. Baking bread, vanilla, ham, bacon, and a general meat presence to the whole nose. There is some malt, well roasted, a whiff of yeasty musk, and little or no hop. Spicy, like seasoning salt, along with some metallic iron notes. Tasting, again I get the fish, finishing with a nice red-malt sweetness, bready and medium-dry. The middle gives perfume, the alcohol, butter, tomato. Hops make their appearance in the finish, with a slighly oily grass taste, adding just enough dryness. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied; almost too creamy for the beer, as it turns to foam immediately in the mouth. At 8%, highly quaffable.

Sort of disappointing right from the start, no head on the pour, and although the body is a decent amber, it's not so much cloudy or hazed, as much as it is simply innundated with suspended particles, like a minor protein haze, or even pulp. The aroma contains papaya, candi sugar, sweet malt and alcohol. There is a tropical fruit motif to the flavour, a sweet and sugary taste, along with a buttery blended rum finish to it, an alcohol kick on the aftertaste. Strawberries, I taste ripe strawberries on the aftertaste, like a daquiri. Very light on the mouthfeel, it's an easy beer to drink texture-wise, goes down smoothly, but I don't feel much impetus to finish this sample, let alone to buy more.

Lots of yeast in the flavor even though there is no yeast in my glass. Very sweet at times with notes of ripe fruit and figs but then very spciy and tart/sour at other times. Alcohol is detectable in the burn and also in the finish the further I go, along with the alcohol sugars/esters. Finish is crisp and lingers but not as long as most Belgians.

Sour notes come through as well as some notes like a Flemish red (slight vinegariness). Gotta mention the nutty aroma again; the malt is most impressive in this light colored malty treat. Totally sweet and dessertish, yet so beer-like, in a connoisseur's kind of way. Again, complete fermentation despite sweetness which accounts for the slightest dry finish. Impeccable. I love this, unlike any other substitute for a dubbel Belgian. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel, but all good, me and my toothbrush are ready for any sugariness (goddamn Cavity Creeps). It's totally unique but I've experienced this many times before, draught and the 33 cl bottle, not the 75 corked and caged version.

This beer's sweetness sets it apart from others in its style. More dark fruit (especially dates), caramel, coriander, a minor alcoholic finish and a distinctive yeast flavor profile define Kwak. Mildly carbonated and especially smooth on draught, this beer can turn syrupy or oily as it warms. A nice sipper, but its sweetness and alcohol content keeps it from being overly drinkable.

Immediately a very earthy malt flavor comes through, then some woodiness. Theres a bit of chocolate in this one as well. Then the alcohol sweetness hits you. There's a touch of bittering on the finish, and perhaps even a slight astringency to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is rather light, but yet smooth. Carbonation is there, but barely noticeable as it meshes well with the mouthfeel. This is not what I expected, as something more like a Leffe Blonde was in my mind. I seem to remember being more surprised (and enamored) by the aroma and the sweetness of the Leffe, but I enjoyed this as well. Hopefully the rating reflects that.

3.78,0.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Note: I've tried both the 33cl bottle and the 75cl. The 33cl is not bottle-conditioned, so it tastes a bit tamer and the carbonation is quite vapid. The 75 can be a real treat, though!","GreenCard","Mar 31, 2003"
4.13,9.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer is pretty clear. It has a glowing presence about it. And is very orange in color. Maybe some scarlet hues in the mix as well. Aroma is sweet (like candy), musty, a little fruity (pears) and woody. The subtelty of this beer knocks me on my ass (if that makes sense). It always poses somewhat of a problem for me as picking out the flavors and complexities in a subtle beer is always more difficult. I get some definite pear flavors. Apple cider as well. Seems fairly high in acidity. Fruity esters and bubblegum esters dance about way in the background here and there. Dry finish is perceived. Nice little beverage here. Not as good as their Tripel Karmeliet however.","Bighuge","Mar 25, 2003"
4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Very clear and beautiful amber colored body. A few lonely CO2 bubbles rise to the surface of the brew. Initially pours to a thick, bubbly head. Head retention is moderate, leaving trails of running lace. Spicy, malty aroma with a bit of a yeast smell. Malty flavor, slightly sweet, and balanced exceptionally well with spicy hop flavor. Also a rather grainy flavor. Slight aftertaste of green apples. Moderate bodied brew, feels fairly rough due to carbonation and alcohol, while slightly oily due to hops.","Viking","Mar 25, 2003"
4.35,15.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Beautiful deep amber colour, just slightly hazy. Great head. INTENSE aroma of spiced alcohol (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, aniseed), hints of ammonium chloride too. Flavour is malty and spicy, but not as intense as you'd expect from the aroma. Sweetness seems just right. Aftertaste is good, but a bit short. An interesting beer, like so many Belgians.","Sigmund","Mar 24, 2003"
3.65,-3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Sweet malts at the start. They dry out as you would expect. Then the brew is a bit roasty. The aftertaste is fruity, and the alcohol becomes confident that I am safe with the gas. I am sure glad that this place is not set to sell as soon as someone shows interested in the product","ElGuapo","Mar 15, 2003"
3.45,-8.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Pretty good for an 8%abv brew. While the flavor overall is a bit too bland for my tastes, it certainly goes down easy enough. Still, I like to be challenged with assertive brews, and this isn't one I'll go out of my way for again.","MJR","Feb 18, 2003"
4.22,11.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Clear dark copper hue, covered by a thick, creamy, rutted ivory white head. Belgian lace is left. The aroma is an enticing melange of bright, acidic ripe citrus, and pronounced brittle like nuttiness. Mellow buttery caramel and mildly spicy hops add additional complexity aromawise. As the beer breathes, caramelized malt becomes progressively stronger in aroma and fruitiness diminishes. Flavorwise, this brew has caramel malt character far exceeding any Belgian style I've experienced thus far. Rounded, caramel and molasses tinged sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by mildly herbal phenol and an understated, but perceptibly grassy, chlorophyll tinged hop flavor. Quite light on fermentation byproducts, and other than the mellow clove, a hint of banana esters rides parallel with caramel malt. Hop bitterness is paltry, leaving the overall balance well skewed towards sweetness. Impressions of carob and oak emerge mid palate and complement malt character. Full bodied, with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes long with hints of chalk and fleeting biscuit and banana. Kwak is a delicious and highly drinkable brew. It's most akin to a dubbel in overall character, but with a uniquely assertive caramel malt presence. Kwak gains complexity and depth as it warms and breathes. Smooth, sweet, and somewhat dangerous.","marc77","Feb 16, 2003"
3.77,0,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"dark orange colour. light and refreshing look. the first sip had a noticeable alcohol kick. good maltiness that helped give this beer some body. spicey and hints of citrus make this beer pleasurable but not outstanding by any stretch. maybe sampling this beer in it's original ""yard"" glass would have enhanced the experience. nontheless, i liked it quite a bit.","Popsinc","Feb 14, 2003"
3.63,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Orangish/amber in color with a tan head. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, malty, and somewhat fruity. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. The flavor is sweet, bready, and malty. It is a medium bodied brew, and easily drinkable. I enjoyed this brew.","BeerBuilder","Feb 10, 2003"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I am generally not a fan of Belgian-style beers, but I liked this one very much. As an aside, my fiancee, who is German and loves the great beers of that country, proclaimed this beer with its abundant suspended yeast to be ""gross"".","Pegasus","Feb 01, 2003"
4.24,12.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth as butter with very very little carbonation. Fruity flavors blend sweetly with a touch of mild hops and warming alcohol towards the end. This is a fine ale to be enjoyed by all, and certainly can compete with the best.","IrishRedRock","Jan 20, 2003"

Nose was enticing with belgian yeast and almost candy like aromas. Flavor was dominated by a sweet maltiness but also showed signs of belgian yeast. Overall I found the flavors to be more subdued. Will definitely try it again hoping not to get the end of the keg.","jreitman","Jan 03, 2003"

4.32,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. Copper color, with an off-white head. Mild malt aromas, like dark fruits with a little pear thrown in for good measure. Taste is sweet, ripe pear, licorice, and pepper. Pleasantly bitter finish. Locals in Belgium might consider this a fad brew, but I liked it anyway.","mophie","Nov 27, 2002"
3.62,-4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Amber color. I found this to be a very smooth Belgian with a sweet and clean flavor. The flavor is definitely better than the name.","Dogbrick","Nov 26, 2002"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This pours with a white head that lasted quite a while, leaving great lacing on the sides of the glass. Deep amber colored beer with a nose of sweet and fruity aromas such as banana, cloves and bubblegum...not to far off from a good hefeweizen! Taste has much complexity and depth to it, with some flavors of banana, alcohol, and liquorice/anise all sensed. Little hoppiness to report, finishes up sweet and quite warming.","beerluvr","Nov 02, 2002"
4.13,9.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice bubbly white head.  A good amount of tiny bubble carbonation is present.  An aroma of malt and cinnamon.  A flavor of malt and caramel, with a decent amount of sweetness to a medium body.  Slightly astrigent finish.","Wildman","Oct 17, 2002"

4.3,14.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy, deep orangish-red-amber with a creamy white head that holds fairly well and leaves some good lace. The aroma is sweet, with a light caramel maltiness, and shows some alcohol. The body is medium with a soft carbonation that makes it very smooth in the mouth. The flavor is rich, with a lightly fruity & candyish character that has caramel & toffee undertones as well as a light spiciness. Again, the alcohol is somewhat noticeable but not distracting. It may in fact, help to thin the sweetness. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish, but that's the extent of it. Kwak's flavor isn't complex, but it is quite luxurious. A really enjoyable beer that should be lingered over. Highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Sep 16, 2002"
4.63,22.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I was not impressed with this beer when I had my first sip after it was poured.  But things definitely got better as it started to warm up.  As it warmed up the malt and hops became more apparent.  Nice little hop taste on the beginning of the tongue, followed by nice malt and toffee taste at the back of the tongue, warming itself as it travels down your throat.  This is a beer to be sipped over a long period of time after it has warmed to enjoy all its character.","rosebud","Jul 14, 2002"

3.68,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Notes: It is definitely a strong ale being that its alcoholic prowess flexes its muscles right away. A decent strong ale though seems to be a bit over the top for its own self, lacks complexity and depth and a bit too much on the esters(too warm of a fermentation?) though makes up with its drinkability.","Jason","Apr 16, 2002"

2.56,-32.1,4,3,2,2,3,"I thought this to be a mediocre brew when I had it in Belgium, and so did the locals. Most who drank it, did so because it's served in mini-yard glass with a wooden holder. More of a fad brew.","Todd","Jun 30, 2001"
