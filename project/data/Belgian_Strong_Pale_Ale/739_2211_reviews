"Decent, but not the best of the style.  Worth trying for the intense herb lovers."

"12/19/13  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. On tap. Not sure what I have here. No distinct aroma, good lacing, some hops, but not much, nice body but no distinguishing character. In the spirit of the season one might expect some warm spiciness. Not here. So what's left? Meh!"

"D: A decent brew. Quite bitter, which takes this down a notch in my book...clashes too much with the style."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Strong Pale Ale."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle. Pours a hazy orangish-brownish colour. Huge fruit and booze notes on the nose with hints of herbs. Taste offers apricot and stone fruits, some nutty/marzipan notes and a big bitter finish to cut through the sweetness. Bottle-conditioned, so big carbonation."

"D: I will be the first to acknowledge that this isn't the most Christmasy beer, at least in the traditional sense of dark, spiced and generally heavy ales. Nevertheless, it's a very nice beer and, given that I love Belgian pales, I'll pick one up around the holidays whenever I have the opportunity."

"I was fortunate enough to taste both 2010 and 2013 vintages side by side at the bull and bush holiday event last night, and my take on this beer is that time does not flatter it at all. it pours a dark honey color with rusty orange hues and a robust whitish head with excellent retention. the nose is strange, juicy, rotting fruit, and Belgian yeast, an odd combination. it smells like compost when its half ready, less earthy, but equally sort of sweet and vinegary, not fully appetizing. the flavor is fresher, but still with a juicy fruity element that doesn't really fit what I thought knew about holiday beer. not overly spiced, but some herbal flavors hit, as does some bitter citrus in the finish. Belgian yeast seems out of place for the flavor profile too, this is all over the place. the 2013 vintage had a decent mouthfeel, bubbly and cleaner than the messy taste, but the 2010 had lost its vigorous carbonation and came across particularly thin as a result. I didn't really care for either one, as they lacked that winter warming property that I love about holiday beer. I would pass this up if I encounter is again."

"Strong flavors in every area (hops, spice, farm, sweetness) make this seem a little all over the place, but it's good overall. Complex and somewhat intense flavors for 7%."

"Classy packaging, typical of De Ranke. Light amber, mostly clear, with a thick clumpy white head that sticks to the tulip. Just a nice spicy Belgian ale, big black and white pepper notes, along with a wallop of grassy hops. A hint of liquorice adds some intrigue but isn't obvious or overwhelming. Very dry and digestible. A snappy, almost chalky, hop bitterness lingers on the finish. This doesn't scream of the holiday season, but certainly screams of a quality, enjoyable Belgian ale. De Ranke makes good beer, I wish we got more of their range around these parts."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with spice and hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mouthfeel on this one isn't too good."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a slightly foamy, smooth, never fizzy mouthfeel that blends unobtrusively with the flavors. Closes quite dry, with modest stickiness lingering across the palate."
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours hazy orange golden with a thick off-white head that dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head retreats. The beer smells of barley malt with some nice fruity notes. I get lemon and banana as well as some clove and pepper spiciness. I'm also picking up some grassiness as well. The grassy hop notes provide a nice flavor for this beer as well as back end bitterness. I get the spice from the nose, but more of those pepper notes than the clove notes, but the clove notes do come out more in later sips. I also get plenty of that bready malt after the first sip. I don't notice the 7% ABV at all. The flavors are nicely balanced. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and there's a lingering aftertaste of hops from this beer. While the alcohol isn't present in the flavor, it brings a nice warming feel after a few sips. This is a very good beer."

"D- I don't know about this one. It's not a bad beer but it seems all mixed up."

"Overall: Not a bad brew, not sure if it's ""Christmas"" worthy. Worth trying but not keeping. Hope you have enjoyed better than me. Salud!"

"The mixed up flavor profile really set this back."
"Overall this is a good beer. It has good balance. I recommend trying it out."
""
"Altogether, lacking in complexity and it, at best, shows moderate depth. The little dextriny roll on the tongue and dry snap is something to be positive about.... Nothing to recommend here."
"O - it is definitely a quality BPA where both the Belgian yeastiness and Pale Ale hoppiness are married well, however nothing really speaks to this beer related to Santa or the hoiday seasons in any way other than the label which is a little disappointing"
"De Ranke get it right again."

"This is a very good Belgian winter ale. It's perfect for a snowy Christmas day—just like today!"
""
"750 ml bottle, stamp on bottle cap says EXP 11/08/17. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like grainy and caramel malt, peppery and sweet spice, candi sugar, citrus peel, and some apricots. It tastes like grainy malt, sweet spices, candi sugar, licorice, peppery spice, pears, and yeast. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. It's a good overall brew, but I'm not sure if I'd pay $13.99 for this again. With that being said, I think it's worth trying."
""
"Overall this is not too bad for a Belgian, but I don't find much unique about this or distinct for a seasonal beer."
"One of the better BSPAs that I have yet encountered, but also one that has little to do with anything remotely Christmas-like. Ok, maybe I grind pepper onto my potatoes and turkey, but that isn't quite the idea here. A good tipple, just maybe not one to that directly complements all those endemic holiday baked goods."
"Pere Noel pours a hazy, dark tangerine color. Two fingers of lightly whipped foam rise up atop the beer, but neither head retention nor lacing do anything to distinguish themselves. The nose is wonderfully complex. Aromas of straw, crackers, light peachy stone fruit, and a bit of pepper all show up, with any one of the above seeming to be dominant each time I take it in. The flavor profile just doesn't have the depth of vibrancy that was found in the nose. There's a good amount of cracker malt sweetness up front, and a fair bit of freshly cracked black pepper in the finish. Unfortunately, there's not much else. What's present is nice, I just found myself wanting a little bit more. The mouthfeel is just OK. The body is a touch chewy, and the carbonation is decidedly muted for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Aside from the aromatics, De Ranke's Pere Noel is a fairly ho-hum BSPA."
"O-i'm usually hesitant to purchase Belgians i haven't heard of. sometimes i'm met with a great surprise, but there are times when the beer scares me. they scare me because i think about how this bottle has possibly been on the shelf forever since most people will just walk past something in a bland label that they've never heard of. this bottle though clearly states it is drinkable until mid 2013...so i'm left to believe this is just truly a terrible beer that i'll never give another chance. tastes like a science experiment, a bad science experiment."
"a nice hoppy Belgian that's very easy to drink without a hint of booze at any point at all. I didn't know it when I grabbed this from the fridge but its just what I was craving on this snowy, chilly day"
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating but assumed to be from last year. Pours very hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big apple, grape, caramel, pepper, pear, clove, earth, toast, grass, herbal, candi sugar, and yeast spiciness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, bread, toast, pepper, clove, apple, raisin, herbal, earth, grass, pear, candi sugar, and yeast spiciness. Good amount of tart earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, pepper, bread, clove, herbal, grass, candi sugar, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Solid flavor complexity with decent balance; a light amount of astringent earthy bitterness is present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good Belgian ale. Solid flavor complexity and balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A fairly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Average and good BSPA. Enjoyable, but there are others that I would go to first."

"Overall - An interesting tasting beer. Can't say I've had one quite like it. There is a surprising amount of bitterness that lingers after there beers gone down. Not really a christmasy beer.. but still quite good. Not something I'd pick up again however."
""
"O: Decent but not too spectacular."
""
"O: an interesting spicy brew. its pretty drinkable, but im not crazy about it."

"Pours a cloudy medium to dark orange brown. One finger off-white head and some lacing. Mild aroma of hops, light malt, light fruit, Belgian spicing. Mild flavor of light malt and fruit, immediate hop kick. Finishes slightly dry with a nonspecific hop bitterness. Kind of low key for flavor and the hops are nice, but not very aromatic. A pleasant, but not that memorable Belgian hopped ale."
""
"This one lacks the special qualities one normally seeks in a holiday beer. However, it is satisfying on a rainy spring day."

"O - This a really hoppy Belgian ale. It almost tasted like a Belgian IPA."
"Different and interesting, not you usual Belgian Christmas beer that’s for sure."
""
""
"Overall, I like this very much. $12.50 for a large bottle is a little prohibitive, but it's a lovely splurge. As well done as any fine Belgian ale. That country truly has a lock on fine beer."
"Good, zesty carbonation. Nice mouthfeel. Decent beer, but a bit hard to drink a whole one unless you get a 330ml bottle."
""
""
"Somewhat disappointing in that it's not like other holiday offerings. The taste is run of the mill BPA, with only moderate ABV. Not a bad beer, just a bit disappointing."

"Santa hugs a tulip glass on this 750 ml bottle, shared by my wife and I. The beer is a pale amber color with lots of haze and a mammoth brilliant head. A fine looking beer. The aroma is just average. I expected more from a Belgian Christmas Ale. It's a bit fruity, some earthy hops, and has a malt character underneath. Some yeast, but overall, a very restrained aroma. The flavor, though, is strong and good. Great balance between initial sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness. Some peppery spice qualities and a nice dollop of yeast. Good. The mouthfeel is substantial and the beer is a touch warming. This is a fine beer."
"My third 12 Beers of Christmas beer. It pours a cloudy sunrise amber topped by a half-finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises clove, wheat, light lemon zest, light coriander, grapefruit zest, banana peel, light-ish toffee, and black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, with more black pepper, some nutmeg, and plenty of dark greens. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth-ish feel. Overall, a generally nice beer, but one that doesn't really impress in any meaningful way. It's tasty and solid, but nothing special."
""
"Taste was big as well, packed a lot of hoppiness in there with lots of the yeast phenols, very dry, slightly bready. Every sip was big time, there wasn't much in the way of nuance, the yeast flavor didn't impart any banana or fruityness. Can't really tell what makes this a xmas beer, its pretty much just hops and standard belgian yeast. Its enjoyable and all, its just kinda puzzling why they put Santa on the label, but then again, there's nothing xmasy about Lagunitas Sucks. . ."
"O: Good stuff. This beer is all over the place, but in a good way. Merry Christmas!"
""
""
"O: This ale had a great head and lacing, but the nose was a bit off to me, and I thought the bitterness was a bit overpowering. I liked the Grand Cru Winter Reserve slightly better."
""
""
"In the taste there is the same caramel touch, not much though. Taste is a bit too thin and i worder why this is called a Christmas beer."
""
""
""
"o - I love Belgian Beers and Enjoy the Christmas seasonals...This was a good blend of both..."
"O - overall gets the job done as far as belgian xmas goes - nothing too robust. Again, pretty sure something was wrong with this pour."
""
"This beer poured out as a nice looking golden color with a white head on top. The smell of the be beer was pretty nice, it doesn't have any aromas of a christmas beer, I was really surprised by that. The taste of the beer has some fresh sweet grains in there along with some hop bitterness in there too. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a solid amount of carbonation. Overall this beer was pretty good, I wouldn't ever say that this is a Christmas brew though."

"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, but at the same time not extremely intriguing either."
"A solid Belgian Strong Ale from the folks at Brouwerj De Ranke."
"O- The nice brett character is a bit clean and the fizz hides some of the character but the grapefruit flavor really grows as the beer warms."
"Overall, a very satisfying beer."
"Medium-bodied with a slick mouthfeel; this brew is easy-drinking if a little underwhelming."
"The name implies a holiday ale of some kind, but it isn't really. It's a strong, yet smooth, ale. Poured a cloudy amber with a nice white head. Pleasantly hoppy, and somewhat yeasty, in the nose and to the tongue, with just a tinge of spice. Smoother than a witbier; not to heavy or bloating. Nice all-around selection."
"Very good ale. Would definitely like to try it fresher as I just purchased on the close-out rack at the local Total Wine & More."
"I finished this, and it was worth the $2 and decent. Not sure how fresh / unfresh this was, so a bit annoyed at that, but still. De Ranke makes great beers; this is maybe the weakest offering from them I've tried. Would try again, but nearer to the source."
"A very murky cloud of amber brown colored brew with a modest white cover and great lacing. The aroma brings a polite but definitive evergreen yeast and subtle citrus hop and some mild cinnamon nutmeg. Nice. The flavor makes a mark with lots more yeasty lemon hop with a clove hint on the tongue. It's medium-light in body with plenty of lively carbonation and a crisp feel. It seems pretty drinkable if you enjoy this Belgian IPA idea. This is a bit grassy which detracts for me but it's a nice blend with some subtle ideas floating around including some banana and corriander but it's mostly a polite but edgey Belgian hop brew and I have no idea why this is billed as a Christmas brew. No complaints though. Worth a try though maybe not the price this bomber typically goes for."
"O- Well balanced, interesting, not too heavy and impressivey hoppy for a Belgian. De Ranke has my respect."
"Drinkability - Very interesting. Good beer. Complex and interesting. Great holiday beer."
"Pours a golden color with a creamy, dense head that reaches several fingers high. Lots and lots of lacing though not necessarily the best retention. The nose is pretty plain with some mild spicing--maybe a spruce-like character. The taste is a bit astringent and harsh, really. There is an odd bitterness in the finish. Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Really dry finish. This is pretty odd overall and I'm not quite sure what they were going for."
"Tastes like a fabulous combination between an American and Belgian PA. You got the fruity barley of a Belgian, starting things off, moving into a rusty, earthy middle, then into dry and citrusy hops, and then a finish that smacks of coriander, white pepper, and grass."
"D - Engaging drinking, I surely want it another but at a good level of maturation.."
"Can't say I've ever tasted anything like this. Very different Belgian flavors mixed together but with plenty of hops. Interesting brew."
"D: The alcohol is well masked and makes this beer relatively easy to drink."
"It smelled strong of citrusy hops. The beer was light and smooth to the taste. You could definitely drink more than one in a sitting. A good holiday brew."
"750ml bottle with a best by date of 2014 so this must be a 2009, darn. No wonder it was discounted. Hazy orange color and smells like citrus and spices, just ok though. The taste is more citrus and Belgian yeast. This is good as far as the style is concerned but it still wasn't worth the $10 I spent on it."
"D - High drinkability. Not to heavy and with the 7% not noticeable one wouldn't have to much of a problem drinking a couple of these."
"On-tap at Tap and Table. Got a very full tulip glass for $8 with very little head. The beer was tasty enough, however, that I was happy to have the headspace filled. The was a spicy, almost herbal cherry aroma (probably from the licorice) and flavor with a little apricot and pear before a peppery, borderline grassy finish. It was fairly drinkable for the strength, but it was also complex enough to leave me satisfied to slowly sip. This is one of the better Belgians I've had lately and completely worth checking out. The character is like that of a cleaned up farmhouse ale, not a standard spiced-up Christmas beer."
"The beer was cloudy, amber-orange. Not a good look. But the beer tasted exquisite, spicy, with citric hops, and a great long bitter-sweet finish. Yum."
"Had this one last night at a Christmas party, and enjoyed it. Poured a nice dark golden color with a big, fluffy white head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, citrus and spices. Light to medium bodied, nicely carbonated and drinkable, with a light sweetness, a hint of spice and a mild bit of tartness."
"D: A decent Belgian pale, possibly regarded as a winter brew because of the ABV elevation, clocking in at 7%, and the darker, fruity, sweeter flavors generated as opposed to other Belgian pales."
"No."
"Overall an enjoyable beer."
"This is one of those really delicious, and complex beers that I simply can't score highly in the BSPA category."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. Lots of lacing left behind. The smell is of noble hops and light malt/bread. Exceptional taste. Noble hops up front, followed by malt and a dry crisp finish. Mouthfeel is bubbly and delicious. I just can't get enough of this beer. Give me more!"
"Poured from a 75 cl into a tulip glass. Big head with a deep golden, hazy hue. Mild carbonation. The aroma is of an old farmhouse, grassy and earthy. The flavor is a drying bitter bite all the way through to finish. There is touch of spicy hops, but the drying effect is dominant. The body is full for 7% and I find myself thinking that this is a great hopped ale from Beligum."
"Overall, the beer has the same progression and intensity as Achouffe Houblon Dobblet IPA but with slightly different flavors throughout. Still this beer is on par with the better hoppy Belgian Ales from that region."
"Pours a dark, cloudy orange with a thick head that -- though it decreased a bit -- remained until the final sip. I would almost prefer to smell the beer than drink it. A brilliant aroma of hops, fruit, and something that I could not trace (and will bother me for a while). That ""something"" -- maybe sugarcane? -- really stands out. The taste, primarily the aftertaste, was a bit too grassy for my liking."
"Drinkability/Overall: Lemony and slightly funky/spicy Belgian IPA. Tasty! don't particularly want another glass of it though. I could see it going very well with something in the middle of a meal. Maybe steamed muscles, a heavy salad, or some well spiced chicken."
"Nathan shared a magnum of the 1998 vintage last night. What a delight! Clear amber with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is fresh, fruity, mildly hoppy, mildly musty with a damp cellar character. In no way would I guess this is 13 years old. Mildly spicy, Bretty even, with cloves. A little thin, but pretty excellent otherwise. The surprise of the night. 4.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"Overall, Good, but unbalanced. Without the mild Belgian funk, you'd think this was an American IPA. I had no trouble drinking this, but it isn't special enough for me to seek again. A one trick pony."
"Good beer...not sure about an Xmas brew, though. Would do well in the summertime."
"D-Nice beer. The sweetness starts to take over as the beer warms and the carbonation blows off. But still a good beer."
"Drinkability: A good example of a belgian strong pale ale with moderate strength. The 7% doesn't make itself known. Pretty delicious."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium body with what seems like it used to be higher levels of carbonation...I think they've dropped over the years. Carbonation is very very fine, tiny bubbles that don't attack the tongue but add to the beer's feel and flavor. All in all I'll most likely finish the bottle...wouldn't want to have paid for this bottle being the way it is now....Still, aged its something that I can drink, I'm positive that its better without any age on it."
"D – This is exceptionally drinkable."
"The pere noel pours a hazy orange color with a very nice 1 finger head and some lacing along the glass. The pour is very pretty. Smells of citrus, spices and hops. Quaff surprised me a bit. There is a distinct red wine dryness to the taste. A little alcohol is noted as well as a base of malts. Mouthfeel is dry and slick. Drinkability is pretty solid. A good belgian ale and an interesting take on a holiday ale. Good work De Ranke."
"Drinkability - highly."
"Overall this beer is all over the place but mostly not that good. Aroma is the best part but everything else is average or just a bit above. So, interesting but disappointing."
"A nice Belgain Winter Ale, well balanced malts and hops. The malty flavours hit the palate initially, then ends with the bitterness of the hops. Light mouthfeel, easy to drink, not a heavy winter ale like most winter ales. Suggest this for a change to a light winter ale."
"Aftertaste and mouthfeel are very clean."
"The feel is smooth though, I give it that, very easy going down with the feel of light but rightly proportioned carb. There is some spicy alcohol throughout this though that somewhat kills it for me. I'd say this is close to being on the medium side. I would not get this again, If I wanted a BSPA, I would of ordered a fucking Duvel."
"It's very crisp and refreshing with a little bit of hop dryness towards the end."
"D: not my favorite style of Christmas beer, but wouldn't turn it down"
"D: Definitely a top Christmas beer, unusual for its hoppiness and lack of sweetness."
"D - I'm going to give this one a pass, since Breweries are pretty much allowed to do what they want with the Christmas style of beer, but there is nothing Christmas about it, just a good Belgian Pale Ale"
"Overall, a nice belgian pale with a pretty pronounced hop profile. A nice beer."
"This was a nice brew that, for me, served as a nice change of pace from the flavor of the american pale ales and india pale ales im used to."
"Good atmosphere. Appearance is pretty representative. Great nose. Combination of a lot of components. Very pleasing, well done. Flavor is more basic, but very full. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"M - A little thin, almost no carbonation. This beer seems like it was a good idea gone bad."
"Poured with a slight head and a tiny bit a lace. Color isn't copper, but a slightly hazy light to medium amber. Aroma is spicy, malty, a hint of hop, yeasty, caramel, nougat, toffee, marshmallows, and toast. Flavor is similar; add pretzels, heavier on the yeast bitterness, and a tang that I can't identify. Great carbonation and good body. Finish is fairly long and bitter. Not bad. Very slightly boozy. Not a quaffing beer, but not really a sipper either."
"Pours a pretty clear golden with a fairly thick off-white head. Aroma is fruity and slightly malty and just a little bit sweet. Flavor is sharp, fruity, somewhat hoppy but not too bitter and slightly sweet. Texture is lively and tingly so it seems to dance on the tongue and down the pipes."
"Overall this was a unique beer and was surprisingly bitter however I didn't find it completely out of place. Worth a shot."
"Santa Claus is a simply man: he likes to eat cookies, be jolly, pose for photographs at the mall, and, once a year or so, he likes to deliver toys to all the world's boys and girls. A simple life for a simple man. It's only according, therefore, that De Ranke's Père Noël be a simple beer - just a modest, unornamented, simple and satisfying pale ale."
"Wonderful stuff and pure De Ranke. Now in my list of top Belgian IPA's."
"Very clear pour on tap with thick head. The beer smelled of spice and a little fruit. The beer was very sour/tart. I think maybe sour apples? It was also very thin and sharp, an intense taste/feel. A neat Winter beer. Still not sure why I was trying it in this hot August weather."
"On the strength of XX Bitter and Kriek De Ranke, I was all set to bestow legendary status on Brouwerij De Ranke. Pere Noel tempers my enthusiasm by a fair amount. It's possible that it's much better when fresh, but I seriously doubt it. And at $13.59 per, I'll probably never find out. If you run across a small bottle, try that first."
"750ml bottled in September of '08. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a huge, rocky, off-white head that lasts. A bit of sediment. The rush of floral hops aromas is fantastic. Grassy and grainy with some citrus and other light fruit, as well as a bit of must. Really complex. The taste is equally nice, with all of the hop presence suggested by the nose and then some. The perfect amount of bitterness is countered by nice, slightly roasty, earthy malt. Interesting mineral yeast notes. Dark fruits. Medium-full body. Another exceptional beer from De Ranke."
"My expectations where met with a change of pace brew."
"Very good... I'm glad I picked this one up."
"M&D: refreshing on the carbonation, medium-bodied, reasonably yeasty and marvellous hoppy, against a balanced performance b/w yeastiness and sour-fruity touch... All in all, this is not a bit less pleasant than the sister product XX Bitter, which is always one of my favourite Belgian ales. Although I fail to find this ale in line with the idea behind any other Belgian X'mas ale that tends to be highly malty, spicy, fruity, estery, or heavey-weight, I personally think this is a lovely tasty brew that should be enjoyed all year round, on any occasion, including the special season of X'mas of course!"
"Notes: This is a solid BSPA."
"This beer is very strong in flavor and was hard to ignore. It has spice and allot hops with a very bitter, clean, and dry finish. If you are a hop head and a big Belgian fan this one might be for you. The mouth fell was a little lacking but the smell and appearance with its massive head certainly made up for it."
"A very tart and dry beer, with light spice and a bit of Brett. Almost within Saison territory, but hoppier."
"Drinkability - not as sweet as I'd have my Christmas beers, but pretty good stuff all in all."
"Overall: just ok. Nothing special but not bad either. Worth the try."
"Pours an opaque and cloudy orange brown color with small froth puffs of foam on its surface, leaving some sticking. Fresh, oily and citrusy hops right up front in the nose, slightly resinous and piney, with a subdued grapefruit aroma that reminds of a West Coast IPA, this is to go without mentioning the slightly herbal, medicinal, classic, Belgian hop character dancing beside. Bright in flavor, big fruity, juicy hops and a bready Belgian yeast character. Grainy and obviously unfiltered, to the tongue, it makes the beers body and overall flavor profile incredibly smooth and drinkable. Moderate carbonation and a fresh but bitter finish. This beer will remain one of my favorites for years to come."
"2008 results - #6"
"Bitter, spicy, funky, but with a malt backbone that leaves a sweet stickiness that was undetected in the taste. This is a great Belgian hoppy winter brew."
"Pours a murky brownish gold with a somewhat small head. Smell is citrusy hops- lemons with some yeasty earthiness. Taste has very little sweetness. Big citrusy hops with a particularly strong grapefruit note. Finishes dry with a slight lingering bitterness. Crisp and well carbonated. Nice overall, reminds me of some belgian IPA's I've had but maybe a bit one dimensional."
"Seek out this is another great offering from De Ranke."
"Low end carbonation, in my opinion it could have used a bit more."
"I wish this were more readily available, but will settle for it as a great quasi-warmer BSPA. Fantastic."
"Pours a cloudy dark red color with a thin beige head that quickly dissapears with no lacing. Aroma of sour cherries and spicy cinnamon. Fruity taste (sour cherry, prune, raiisin) with a nice spicy cinnamon character."
"The taste is quite tart and biting, with much of the sweetness subdued behind a biting hoppiness and maybe a roughish tart malt. The beer sweetens as it settles and some of the harshness fades into the backround. The ABV is hidden quite well, the mouthfeel is pretty mild. This is a pretty carbonated brew. It is the tartness and hop bite that make this a slightly diminished Belgian pale. Not bad, but far from my favorite."
"Drinkability- A think it is a great seasonal a little different for this style."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with a big off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus, corriander and quite yeasty. In the taste, spicey corriander and a big yeasty flavor. A smooth and yeasty mouthfeel, with a yeasty and small corriander aftertaste. Fantastic beer, smooth and yeasty, nice big spiciness. A great flavor and good balance."
"An interesting holiday beer, at least one that doesn't go over board on the spice and actually has some hop backbone."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty hazy beige color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of Saaz dry hops with some light dry funky notes. Taste is dominated by dry Saaz notes with a light funky notes, some floral notes and a quite dry ending and all this being supported by a nice Belgian malt backbone. Full body with limited filtration and great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting experience but maybe a tad too dry to be enjoyed on a repetitive basis."
"Overall I was rather disappointed by this one. It was just too bland for me and really never did get off the ground. It is not really terrible in any way, it's just not really exciting either. I wished there could have been a little more depth to it, some more complexity. It's not a bad call, but for the price I would look elsewhere."
"Despite the nice look and pretty good nose, the taste just isn't balanced. Maybe it was a bad bottle, maybe not, but it's not one I'm itching to try again."
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger white head, basically no sticky lacing. The nose is malty, grapes, spices, slight caramel. The taste is slightly tangy, malty, nice little spice thing, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little winter ale."
"Cloudy darker orange color with a thin but attractive off-white head. A little cherry, berry fruit in the nose with some yeasty dashes. Flavor is slightly acidic, sour and a little more hop bitterness than usual. Sharp bubbles in me mouth and the feel was a bit on the thin side. Nothin very winter holiday like for me here. Maybe this should be an Easter beer."
"D: Overall I enjoyed drinking this beer. It was a hot, spicy and hoppy Belgian that really warmed the soul and drank much bigger then its advertised 7.0%abv. a 750ml would be more then enough."
"Pours a 1-finger head that dissipates slowly, leaving a thin ring of foam. Cloudy amber. Smells of volatile esters, bananas and papayas and hints of tobacco and brown sugar. Mainly taste the bitter hops down the center and tip of the tongue with ripe bananas and a hint of butterscotch ending with a little clove and a metalic aftertaste. Got this in the Shelton Bros. X-mas bundle, it is a nice bitter ale. I think it is a little darker and just a little fruitier and a bit more complex than De Ranke's XX bitter, but I don't see what is so X-mas-y about this one. It would be very drinkable on a hot summer evening. Good choice for an X-mas in July party, if you save it until then."
"From a 350 ml bottle this poured a cloudy orange with medium and light lacing. Nose of ripe fruits and grassy hops. Light mouth-feel, and flavors of light malts, oranges, grapefruit, and what I assume is Belgian yeasts. Long bitter finish. Good brew."
"This is a pleasant enough Belgian Pale Ale, but not exceptional."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Light-medium body, appropriate carbonation. Perhaps drinkability would have been improved by dropping the spices. Otherwise, XX bitter + more malt is a good description. Good."
"A 750ml bottle with best by 9/2012 on the label. Poured into a tulip glas, it was an orange color, nicely carbonated. A fairly thick head that quickly dissipated. It had a sweet, honey-like aroma, with a bit of clove spiciness. Initially sweet to the taste, with a fairly big hops presence soon following. Some clove. There was a lingering bitterness to the taste. I was very ambiguous about this beer, The bitterness really persisted and, while not unpleasant, it wasn't exactly pleasant. One of these was enough for me."
"Overall not bad but I would have just one. I might try it again if I saw it on tap though."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden with a thick creamy head  big bubbles, but quickly falling. The aroma is cereal, earthy, grainy and definitely spicy. The taste is also spicy earthy and cereal  quite well balanced. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and seems very appropriate for this beer. Overall this is a smooth, spicy and easy to drink beer."
"Overall: This was a good beer. It didnt do anything for me though. I thought it was rather middle of the road. I did like the malty surprise in the flavor."
"Overall not bad, but seems too simplistic to enjoy that often. Seems like not so much flavor other than light malt and hop bitterness."
"Overall worth trying I would say. But not because of any particular thing. It is just a very mysterious beer. Here, there, but nowhere. I suggest trying to mix up the sediment in the beer as it seemed to provide a more even and smooth experience."
"D: A nice surprise after liking, but not being that impressed with the De Ranke XX Bitter. The flavours here work better, and are less astringent than the former. A hopped up BSPA is not what you'd expect from a Christmas beer in Belgium, but it works pretty well."
"Palate is spicy ... earthy.. fruity.. complex.. Pale malts and yeasty esters.. spicy hops and peppery finish... lite/medium body and prickly carbonation helps tie the flavors together.. Interesting enough to make me want to pick up another bottle if I could. Very much like XX Bitter but without the palate bombing bitterness. Definately from the same brewery. Could use a bit more malt complexity."
"Drinkability - Overall a very easy drinker, but I'm taking points off a little for the unique flavors that I think might put some people off a bit."
"The beer is very hazy and unfiltered, pale golden color, with a very thick frothy head. There is so much foam that it slowly gushed out of the bottle after popping the cork. The aroma is of a hopped Belgian beer with some spices, kind of La Chouffe-ish or maybe Urthel Hop-It-ish. The taste is more of a bitterer version of Duvel. Nice and easy drinking, but not an everyday beer. I prefer the bitterness of American Pale Ales or IPA's to this."
"Drinkability:Great. I liked this one a lot, although the Christmas theme throws me off a little bit. I always can appreciate a hopped up Belgian beer. The best ""holiday"" beer of the season for me. Get some. I have a year old 750ml that I might crack soon."
"Definitely an interesting brew, I have to give de ranke credit for one thing---they always make something I can form an opinion on, but this is harder to do so than the others... I like it, but there's something about that peppery hop character that is a double edged sword, IMO. I imagine this could be paired very well with certain sweet foods, glazed meats and such.. On its own, the peppery hops just kinda bug me, though. If you like bitter, non-oily hops that don't have that profound tart character, check this one out. If youlike anything from De Ranke, this is definitely required drinking."
"Overall, not really a bspa i like. It's not bad, but its leaving me wanting a fuller and sweeter beer. I dont hate it, but i wouldnt think about getting it again."
"So, sorry, Pere Noel, still not loving you."
"Hops are subdued in the taste but definitely present. Light bitterness in the background, with a soft, cheesy hop character. Orange peel and fruit esters are also present. Yeast gives a certain level of smoothness. Carbonation is soft. The 750 was split two ways, which is probably the ideal serving. The hops seemed to build up and numb the palate a little bit. Last year I remember this being more earthy and spicy without much of hop character, maybe this is a fresher bottle."
"I wouldn't recommend this beer."
"A bit of a disappointment in what I would hope to be the brewers best effort at a festive ale."
"Almost flat feeling medium body. Carbonation isn't where it should be. I made it through about half of this 750ml bottle, but have no desire to finish it. It's a shame, really, because I was looking forward to it."
"I liked it. A new style - A hoppy, Belgian, winter warmer...Spices don't beat you over the head. Sweetness is faint, and the body is rather light. A bit like a saison. Odd winter offering - ABV reasonable, spices light, not sweet or heavy??"
"Mouthfeel- Very soapy and overly astringent. Hard to drink."
"Notes: So hard to think of this in a Belgian category as the ""hoppy"" craze is catching on even in a traditional style. I liked the way it worked and will buy one again on occassion."
"But overall this is a great beer, which hides its ABV pretty darn well, I'll gladly buy another."
"Poured into a small chalice a rich gold with real pech colored hure a tight formed 1/2 finger white head atop,slight medicinal hop aromas along with some earthiness and light overripe pineapple.As in the nose slight medicinal notes intertwined with citrus fruits give it a pretty good hop profile all along a pretty big dryer earthiness is there a hint of mustiness shows thru as well.A Belgian pale I like not overly yeasty with a nice hop profile,I would buy again for sure a nice treat on tap."
"What a great beer, complex, bitter and hoppy!"
"Neat dryness and complex. This is not entirely different in feel and complexity of the St. Bernardus beers that I have recently had. Do they share the same primary yeast strain? Anyway, the minerally oranginess gets tiring for me. It is a top-notch beer, but that flavor profile is not usually what I am looking for. I think I will stick with my XX for the most part."
"Pours a hazy pale amber with a good head. Smells slightly metallic and hoppy with some citrus background. Taste is very hoppy, but with soft hops, and lemon citrusy. Bubblegum and other yeasties on the finish. fairly unusual and interesting. Soft mouthfeel, but crisp. Quite drinkable."
"D: I'm finding that I'm not a fan of ""bitters"" outside the US. I guess I find them boring and uncomplete. This beer did grow on me over time though."
"D: Easy drinking, but I'm not sure that's how one would like to start out rating the ""drinkability"". I wasn't wowed by this brew. It wasn't bad, but nothing amazing or out of the ordinary. Spicy in the nose, but nothing in the taste. Although this is a belgian strong pale ale, I would take out the ""strong"". Noel? No Christmas spices here! I'd pass on this as it's not worth the $12-13..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabiliity; mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a bit of a biting carbonation in the finish. Drinkability but would be better if it were not quite so dry."
"D: This is an excellent brew, quite decieving. Very easy to throw back with the high alcohol content."
"1 pint 9.4 fl. oz bottle wrapped in a decorative green papering. Poured into a tulip glass that produces an orangish copper color with a large fluffy off white head. The aroma is dry and sweet with a fruity/floral notes that is a bit tart as well. Taste starts out somewhat sweet but finishes with a spicey bitterness that finishes bone dry. There is also a lot of must/barnyard in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is highlighted by a lively amount of carbonation. Overall, this really is a delightfully complex and unique brew that I found drawing me in more and more as the bottle emptied. It is really an intriguing beer that I would recommend trying if you can get your hands on it."
"it's not exciting, yet i doubt i could call it bland. beers like this inconvenience me because of this problem, though i routinely enjoy them"
"Body is medium, well carbonated, with a fluffy, airey mouthfeel. Good drinkability and not overly complex."
"Comments  I got a ton of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Gotta love it."
"Aroma is slightly musty with spicy/fruity notes just beneath. Orange tinted tan in color with a diminishing, thumb thick, white head. Has a crisp tartness in the fore and ample orange peel notes that arent truly bitter, but none the less hold that citrusy peel flavor. Some wholesome sweetness that is bread-sweet rather than candy-sweet, though there is a fruity (apple mostly) sweet twang in the finish. The mustiness of the aroma is evident again in the flavor. Carbontion is medium to low, but complimentary to the beer."
"Had a bottle a year later at cellar temperature and observed a nicely cellared spicey yeast melange, good drinking.A year and a half later, just as good."
"Hazy light tangerine in color with a light head of white foam that coats the glass fairly well. Strongly floral, slightly metallic, lightly smoky aroma with hints of spice and bright fruits, which give an orange/tangerine scent. Airy, coating feel. Light spice flavor, bright yeasty tones with bright fruit flavors, with a hint of herbs. Very tasty."
"This beer pours a tangerine color with a thin white lace that disappates quickly. The smell is of candied fruit orange citrus, peach, grassy/hay (wheat) notes. The taste starts with sweet apricot flavor then hits you with a slight alcohal essence then follows with a slight hoppy bitterness that compliments the whole beer."
"Merry Christmas!"
"This was my 2005 Christmas beer of choice, based solely on my affinity for the XX Bitter and Guldenburg. Not being home with my usual drinkware, I was forced into using a standard wine glass. The instant after uncorking, a mountainous fizz overflowed and consistently did so until the pour. It poured a lighter caramel color with an off white head that's dense and frizzy with very good lace. The nose is woody, clovish and pale...enticing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slightly acidic grit to it. The flavors are many; appley and cask-like up front with lingering clove spiciness, all tied neatly with a citrus hop character that is hardly subdued. The finish is peppery, with hints of oaken wood and a dryness that is there, but not overwhelming. This is a wonderfully complex beer that would be well served to lay down for a year. In fact, I may grab myself another one today for next Christmas' offering. Prosit!"
"My brother picked up a bottle of this for X-Mas as well. At first maybe I thought I had a bad bottle, but nope. Tasted exactly the same. He couldn't even drink it and he's just as much a beer nerd as me. Again, I could maybe undersand it, but... thought the flavors just didn't meld."
"The drinkability is very good, very smooth and complex."
"Hazy yellow orange with decent fluffy white head. Light sweet fruit notes with a light spicing. Not much else maybe a little yeast stands out as it warmed but it was a very mild aroma. More fruit with the flavor that was also backing with a light dusting of spices. A nice subtle grassy hoppiness melds in well. Ends with a dry spicy finish. Decent enough body and easily drinkable. It wasnt bad it just seemed a bit too mild for its own good."
"Drinkability- Yummy brew that makes one think of a Belgian IPA if there is such a thing. Glad I got to try it. I'll have to keep my eyes open for it again."
"750 ml bottle with a cork and cap pours a cloudy glowing orange with a huge creamy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Flowery , musty lemon aromas. Apple, pear, citrus and spicy pepper flavors, medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, almost perfect. Finishes dry and bitter, very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel on this thing is creamy, magical, caressing. Simply amazing. Overall, the beer is insanely drinkable. Now I can only thank God that there are still 6 ounces or so left in the bottle for me to enjoy."
"This was a gem. I was enjoying it too much to take good enough notes."
"The mouthfeel hit me as exceptional, as the start was crisp and the finish was lightly crisp and smooth on the tongue. The spices last long on the tongue after swallowing. This is a really enjoyable holiday brew."
"Taste: A light, airy fruitiness gave way immediately to a sharp hops bitterness that really dried out the beer in the middle. Some sharp, acidic fruits rose up on the finish. These became a little sweeter in the aftertaste, where they were joined by a light amount of roasted malt. Overall, dry with the bulk of the flavor being bitter and sharp."
"Best before september 2008 so about 1.5 years of aging. Pours in perfectly clear with good head and a nice bronze colour. Smell is delightingly fruity, mostly yeast but still litle hops there. Most of the nose though is very creamy orange & peach. First sip makes you notice the used hops in high amounts and still present. 2 nd sip made me get the nice and fruity arome that reminds me of good tripel. After that I found also litle malt and hops& hops. Great brew, also to lay down for a bit."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery for the style."
"In conclusion, this beer was unimpressive and overpriced by about $9.99 - money better spent on something else... Such a shame for a beer with a great picture on the label."
"750 ml bottle opened on 12-25-04. One of the most complex beers I have had in awhile, an excellent treat for Christmas night."
"Drinkable? Id say! God I love Belgian Strong Pale Ales, this offering isnt as forceful as most. In this case that is a good thing. Liquid gold. Amazing. I purchased a 750ml in Burnsville, MN. One bottle was not enough."
"Holiday brew? This is liquid Jesus."
"This was my reason for going to Rich-O's today. It poured a nice hazy golden color with one finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is sweet fruity strawberry and caramel with a nice peppery background. The flavor is great. Wonderful sweet caramel balanced with a spicey pepper and a great spicey hop on the finish that sits on my tongue. Good good beer. The feel was moderatly thick and velvety smooth. Drinkability is awesome. So easy drinking, sweet and balanced. I really liked it a lot."
"Definately refreshing, a big changeup in the christmas beer lineup. I enjoyed the full hop bitterness and fruity nose, but can't help but think that the flavor could have been better. Definately one to try out again next year, or even let another bottle lie for awhile."
"Had this at the Moan and Dove's 2nd Birthday party. What a fun time. Pours with a fairly big head, nice and puffy. Clearish light amber color. Soft looking. Smells a bit funky. Definate wheat presence, with a tad of dirt in there, also with a nice malt backbone and a floral hop profile. Tastes almost watery, but not in an bad way. It kind of tastes like a beer with a shot of wheat grass thrown in. Very musty and yeasty indeed. Sweet malt notes here and there, with a bitter dry hop finish for the mouthfeel. Drinkable yes, but you probably want to take your time with this one I'd say, as it's pretty complex."
"got this is the dark brown bottle with the tissue wrap, the cork was very dry (almost broke off into the beer when opening), very unimpressive, looks like a beautiful unfiltered gem, but doesnt back it up in the taste. Only recommended for purists looking to sample it all."
"This bottle seem to contain quite a bit of foam just waiting to flow out the top one the cork was out. It formed a very murky light amber color with a bubbly white head that dispated quickly considering all the foam that flowed out of the bottle. The aroma was of yeast, hops and some spices. The flavor was of citrus, spices, hops and some bread/dough aspects. The body was fairly light and the finish was complicated, with aspects of spices with a small bit of astrigency."
"Very light finish"
"750 ml, wrapped in paper without a label on the bottle. The first pour from a long-standing 750ml bottle is surprisingly clear, and its amber body displays orange and gold highlights beneath a magnificent pillow of soft and creamy white foam. The second glass becomes murky with the lees, but the brilliant head remains and it holds exceptionally well, leaving some very nice rings of lace about the goblet. The nose is fresh, exciting, and enticing with a combination of lightly fruity, earthy, and mildly musty yeast; delicately sweet malt; and bright, grassy hops. In the mouth it's very fine-bubbled carbonation is not as effervescent as might be expected, but rather median; and it's medium body combines with it to leave it just lightly tingly and then velvety smooth across the palate. The flavor is not overwhelming... to the contrary, it slowly draws you in, bit by bit. Some light, juicy and subtly tart fruit appears up-front, immediately backed by a soft, delicately candyish malt that wraps it like a blanket as a pillow of grassy, lightly floral, and somewhat spicy hops appear. Or are they spicy? Bolder peppery notes appear almost at the same moment. And a flick of alcohol is present as well; so is the peppery spiciness coming from the alcohol, spices, hops or a combination of all three? Who knows? Who cares? It finishes dry with some lingering pepper and a combination of citrusy and dried-apricot-like fruitiness that leaves you only partially satiated and wanting more. Raspy, pine-like notes and a bolder bitterness develop at the back of the throat as you progress through the glass, almost begging you to go back to the supple, juciy and citrusy fruit found at the start. Wow! What an enticing beer! It's certainly not what one might expect of a holiday ale (think bolder & spicier), as it's so much more the seductress. Refined... elegant... regal, perhaps. A brilliant pale ale that should be available year-round, and welcome on the dinner table at any time. Very nicely done!"
"Overall Impression: I guess I'm just not sure what makes a Christmas beer a Christmas beer. To me, it should be quite different from the norm: more flavor, more spice, more color, and some ""archivability"". This just seems like a usual Belgian beer. It's good though."
" Hops still mellowing in this - I think another year wouldnt have hurt at all. 3 - 4 years in a bottle might be best for this Gem."
"A creamy peach-like orange-ish hue with a lovely creamy head of off-white bubbles. The aromas are of melon, different fruits, spicy alcohol, yeast, belgian candi sugar, and fresh floral, just cut hops! The flavor is very similar to the aromas and follows thorugh wonderfully. As Loren said, this stuff is a hop heads version of Duvel, that is definately a good way to sum this beer up. It tastes of candy coated hops, honey, different spices and flowers, belgian candy sugar, and yeast. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and light on the tongue and the drinkability is excellent as well. Another grand-slam-home-run from De Ranke!"
"(edit 13/01/11)"
"size, creamy in consistency and the color an off white with the lace a silk like curtain to cover the glass. Fruit laden nose, to me an over ripe peach, also somewhat musk like or musty like an old wine cellar, not bad mind you just quite different some malt tones at the back with the start sweet, nicely malted, tart and somewhat vinous, top is light but rich in feel. Meekly carbonated finish, bitter, hops understated, alum dry aftertaste, different from what I would normally drink, so it takes a lot of contemplation to be accurate in my judgment, drinkable, but something I'd not want to sample on a regular basis, but after some serious decanting I found it to be a bit more pleasing to my palate, so if your not into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle, even if it means pouring a bit of the beer back into the bottle you may make a serious misjudgment of taste."
"Had on tap at Redbones...made me sing Father Christmas the rest of the evening. Anyway...Pour was a dark gold color, no head. Very clean aroma, I didn't pick up much action. I found this to be pretty darn smooth, and even though I knew it had some punch, alcohol wise, I really couldn't tell when drinking it. Definitely some candi sweetness in the finish. While good, and definitely well blended, there wasn't so much going on with this one. Might be a good choice for a novice, no off notes detected with this one. pat"
"This beer is damn good. So far De Ranke has really impressed me. This is a really good mix of flavors, very well balanced. Walks a wonderful line between sweet on the one hand and dry on the other."
"Appearance: Amber orange cloudy with an effervescent bubbly carbonation, this one was done in small batches reminscient of some hard to find farmhouse ales lacing is excellent fine Belgian webbed patterns. Aroma: A bouquet of floral Hallertau blended with a piney honey tinged tone with a streak of spicing to bring holiday cheers. Taste: I absolutely fell in love with this Belgian rarity, possibly up there on my all time favorite Belgian ales as well as Christmas beers I've tasted. Fruity tones accented and surrounded by the rush of pine cone like hops, so excellent this kind of hopping with the lucious malt backbone this is the Ruination of Belgian bier just a step below Properings Hommel in my opinion. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a champagne like carbonation this one is hard to beat. Drinkability: My lord I indulged in this beer at the Sharp Edge on a Thursday by Saturday this beer was sold out there they moved two cases like nothing. Found it at D's Sixpack and picked up their last two bottles just excellent for a dinner brew or just if chilling around and the snow's coming down crack one of these babies it will put a smile on your face."
"Pours a magnificent cloudy burnt sienna-orange color with a fluffy off white head. Strange aroma, can discern some hops and a bit of peppermint, malt and possibly some other spices, but subdued. Taste is most unique, unlike anything else I've tried. I recommend that if you find a bottle, buy it; can't miss the pale green wrapper on it. Mouthfeel is most excellent, effervescent and crisp. A lingering astringent aftertaste of lightly zesty hops and dull peppermint leaves. Totally unique for a Christmas beer. Floored by it."
"Man this is good!! Awesome deep honeyed/tan color with plenty of mouthwatering sticky beige head to welcome one, and very adequate lace that leaves a patch of web throughout. On the nose malty sweetness meets beeswax scented hop. The smell of the candy sugar is also evident, as is a very inviting while subtle fruitiness. In the mouth the beer hits all the buds! sweetness can be found on the roof of the mouth, while bitter teases the tip of the tongue and literally attacks the sides of the tongue. This is a great strong pale ale, and reminds me of a saison on roids! This is a big, hoppy brew that is oh so refreshing and clean! The finish with its bitter hop, and grapefruit zest like burn goes on, and on, and on! This is one of my favorite winter seasonals this year no question. Get as much as you can of this beaut!!"
"The surprise of the holiday season so far, and probably will be for the whole season! Simply fantastic, and an excellent use of hops, and certainly one I will have again, if I ever find it again! Thanks to WVbeergeek for splitting this one with me....a pleasure to share a fine beer with a fine BA!"
"Another sample is needed I feel to improve this Review."
"Another beautifully paper-wrapped bottle from de Ranke. It's copper with a nice white head. Fruity tartness dominates the smell, but the hops are more pronounced than they are in most Belgians. Granny Smith apples and grapefruit flavors make for a nice slightly mouth-puckering taste. Alcohol smell and taste did seem fairly pronounced for a 7% abv beer."
"Really nice murky orange stuff. kind of like a cross between an IPA and a belgian, it works well. Slightly residual mouthfeel, with some earthy orangey notes, finish is bitter, citric and hoppy, has a nice spicyness aswell. De ranke have done it again!!!"
"2002 edition: Paper-wrapped bottle pours a beer which is clear bronze in color, topped by a medium-thick white head which quickly settles. Aroma is mild in its maltiness and hops, though accented by a lightly tart fruitiness  green apple, perhaps, or hints of grape. The flavor is led by a full, toffee-like maltiness, which yields gently to a floral, spicy dry finish. The aftertaste is of brown sugar. A really surprising beer for me, and a nice example of a Belgian Holiday ale!"
"Turbid looking brown tone with orange highlights. A nice beige head recedes to a thin fillm that sticks around nicely. Lace is clingy and sporadic. Nose is perfumey, floral and spicy alltogether. Also fruity and orange-like. Even a little candyish. Very nice. The palate tells my this is one tasty beverage. Nice hop traits: dryness, hebalness, a recognizable, but understated bitterness, spiciness. Pretty cool. Some bready yeast undertones. Orange comes into play midway through. Some slight grainy malt tones surface every now and then. Slight musty/farmyard character adds even more depth to this complex brew. A light-medium body with just the right amount of spritzy carbonation makes this one drinkable (and enjoyable) beer."
