4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/13/2010. No pop of the cork upon opening. Pours very hazy red-orange color with a small fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, peach, orange, floral, caramel, honey, bread, light pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity brett notes with balanced hop and malt notes. Taste of pear, apple, grape, peach, orange, pineapple, floral, caramel, honey, bread, toffee, light pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Very slight fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, floral, caramel, honey, bread, toffee, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity hop/yeast notes with well balance malt sweetness; with no cloying flavors present after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is actually quite good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong pale ale, despite lack of carbonation. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity and malty flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 21, 2013"

Taste is very red apple forward as well. A lot of delicious hoppiness as well with a fair amount of booziness. Definitely some tasty Belgian yeast flavors with some great spiciness. Very sweet grape flavors as well. The label says this beer has subtle tartness, but I pick up zero tartness. None whatsoever, which I believe would have made this beer OUTSTANDING!

The nose is pretty plain, with some very mild esters and a bit of malt sweetness. The taste is a bit of a mess with too much malty sweetness and not enough yeast. In reality, not much of anything other than some sweetness. This carries over into the feel, which is almost cloying and isn't dry like I'd expect.

Despite the malts, it is a bit flat and thin on the palate. Hop bitterness is still kickin' pretty good, lasting into the finish. Malts taste a bit oxidized and this beer is obviously past it's prime. Really not very good, and a HUGE dissappointment considering the $18 price tag and the fact it is a DeProef and T.Arthur collab.

A fluffy medium body that is slightly chewey from breadi- and yeastiness and also a bit prickly thanks to some sour fruit/tart fruits that cut and sour citric hops as well as some carbonation. An excellent balance thanks to spice and honey/caramel/sweet malt that is clearly evident for a mix of sour and sweetness and perfectly finished with a slightly tart/dry backbite that grabs the tongue.

Aroma is deep and complex and as it warms up reveals different notes. Initially ripe fruit and sweetness, predominantly apple and tangy citrus. Some light spice, but the finish is more earthy and musky, strong yeast and brett funk. Body is medium-thick, with fine carbonation. The taste begins with apple and honey sweetness, and Belgian yeast. In the finish a fairly strong hop presence takes over and the brett asserts itself as the sweet is balanced by an earthier dry flavors. Very nicely balanced and rich blend of complex flavors, this is a very enjoyable beer but is a little boozy in the finish.

Honestly, it's exceeded the high expectations I had. Its uniqueness makes it special. I don't believe I've encountered a BSPA with such a citrusy, hoppy presence. I bet this stuff was flat out incredible fresh out of the gate. I also like the somewhat mild effect of Brett here. It works extremely well with its other elements. All in all, this Signature release is fantastic. I would've preferred a bit more body, but that's about all I can criticize. Find a bottle or two if you can. Highly recommended.","prototypic","Oct 09, 2009"

The aroma has biscuits and crackers with some grassy and lemony hops. Sweet and biiter, inviting aroma. The taste starts with crackers and brett yeast infusion. The middle gets somewhat fruity with the malt and yeast combo. But the hops give a bitter apple skin note starting in the middle through to the finish. Pretty complex flavor profile. And pretty bright palate. Bitter in a flash, but sugary sweet in just as much time. Brett yeast and bitter American hops mixed in a Belgian ale style of beer.","scruffwhor","Sep 19, 2009"

Wasn't expecting it to be to hoppy but there is a distinct presence of resinous, piney hops in the backbone of this brew. The brett presence is subtle but present, and the belgian yeast is there but not too much which can be the downfall of so many other belgians. What is this brew? A Belgian strong ale? How bout' a IPA-Belgian-sour? OK it's not that sour, how bout just a Belgian IPA? Close but there's more, Oh, screw it. Its a Belgian strong ale, and a damn good one at that.","mbrasi","Jun 21, 2009"

It tasted like apricot and lemon zest and banana, with sour Belgian yeast and metallic copper hops, with a bit of alcohol and cocoa powder and sugar. It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation that subsided over time, and had a lasting tart aftertaste. Overall this was a nicely done collaboration on a light Belgian ale. It had a fairly delicate and complex flavor that was strong but not overdone. The alcohol was present, but the beer was still pretty easy to drink. It had a mostly clean and enjoyable taste with a very nice smooth body. Not sure if it's worth the money to try again, but it was at least nice to experience once.","Pencible","May 30, 2009"

Also some grass, a little pepperiness, some more bright lemons, some funk, as well as a good yeastiness. Taste follows the aroma fairly well, lemon and honey up front, some soft spices, some bitter grassiness and pepper mixes in as well, lemon carries through mixing with some good yeastiness, bordering on just a hint of tartness. Mouthfeel is medium in body, refreshing bitterness and pepperiness on the palate,a bit of dryness in the finish. Much like a saison imo, I was hoping it might be a bit dryer, but still a decent amt of dryness mixes with the malts along with the slightest hint of lemony tartness to make it very pleasing and highly drinkable, very good beer.","hoppymeal","Beers"

A bit hoppy, more hoppy than any other Belgian pale ale I've had. Which I really like, aromatic and fruity hops lie on top of sweet maltiness and the classic yeast of Belgians. I really enjoyed drinkin this, but after 750 mL, I doubt that I would drink another. It took me nearly 45 mins to drink just one. But I really do like this.

The flavor really did a strange number on me - it was so very mild and shy, a touch of sweetness that I could not tell whether it was from malt sugar or added sugar balanced by a faint bitter dryness that once again I could not guess its source. Hops? Yeast? A very dry maltiness achieved through high attenuation? I couldn't say, and I couldn't even say if it "tasted good" because everything was so damn mellow and elusive. A very coy beer. It was the soft medium body, and something (again) elusive on the mild dry finish that made me just go, "damn" and keep on taking rapid sips to hunt it down. Something was happening but I didn't know what. This beer is invisible. Nothing bold or brash about it. You just keep wanting more and then it's gone.

When poured into a Duvel tulip, this one looked decent but not great. The golden color, and the large head were nice, but the chill haze was a bit heavy. The smell was quite a bit like a Saison with hops and wildness coming together for an inviting bouquet. The taste was a great marriage of two bold and proud traditions. The hops were immediately noticeable like they would be in a bright American IPA, but the malt content was quite a bit higher, and the unique dry and sour flavors that come only from Belgian Yeast and Brettanomyces were vying for attention.

First of all I have to say I like this beer better in the bottle than on tap even though its a great beer no matter the source, Second with a year age on it the Brett has developed mor and some of the hops have faded but help balance it out more like a BSPA. Poured into Duvel Snifter a Hazy Golden Orange color with a white head about a finger thick with good lacing. Smell is a light brett funk, spice, sweet candi sugar amd mellow citrus scents. Taste is sweet malt mixed with lemon zest, light grass flavors, atouch of spice and phenolic compounds. Mouthfeel is light body with an active but light carbonation.

Aromas of citrusy hops and a slight Brett sourness. This one will probably pick up more of this character with age, but then the hops will mellow a good bit as well, changing the profile a good deal. Nice fruity aromas of peaches, plums, and orange as well. The taste has similar components as are reflected in the nose. It's a seemless blend of piquant Brett flavor and citrusy hops.

The sweetness is light, it's not overwhelming at all. It also has a lingering bitter grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and coating but not heavy.

3.87,-4.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not a bad brew, but not quite as clean, refreshing and enjoyable as Duvel or Delirium.","saintwarrick","Dec 03, 2007"
4.23,3.9,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall a fine beer. A bit steep on the price ($13) but understandable. The hoppier Belgian Ale is quickly becoming a favorite style of mine...","bennetj17","Dec 02, 2007"
4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mixed bag on this one. The bitterness throws it out of whack and overshadows any pleasant nuances (i.e-the Brett character). It also limits it's drinkability. I love IPA's and am a hophead, but this just seems off-kilter. Enjoyable...yes, but not worth a 2nd purchase.","Mitchster","Dec 01, 2007"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D- Delicious and easy to drink, very well balanced between the sweet fruits and subtle malts","Stoneman78","Nov 27, 2007"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"On the palate is an rather sour, tangy, with human bile like flavor (yes, but it's still good). Mixed fruit and powdered sugar sweetness are present, with a highly carbonated sweet and sour finish.","yemenmocha","Nov 24, 2007"
4.77,17.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall I was shocked by how good this was. It was almost a perfect blend of the two styles and the west coast hop profile really shined here. It was just a great match between the two and I would love to see them do something else together soon. Great job on this I really enjoyed it and will have to go grab a couple more of them.","mikesgroove","Nov 01, 2007"

4.34,6.6,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"It's no surprise that the larger than life Belgian ale-type producers of De Proef and Port combine with the former's ability to churn out authentic product that couples with Mr. Author's artistry and attention to keen detail that separates the contenders from the pretenders.","BEERchitect","Oct 18, 2007"
4.19,2.9,4,5,4,3.5,4,"Glad I finally got to try out this cross-Atlantic collaboration. It's an American microbrew twist on your basic Belgian ale, and it works - the hops we yanks have come to crave on a crazy, candied Bel.","ojiikun","Oct 16, 2007"
3.83,-5.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: A good Belgian, kind of pricey, but I have good faith in anything that Tomme Arthur does, so I went for it. Maybe a little to expensive for what it is, but still very tasty. Didn't blow me away, but still a tasty Belgian, a good experimental brew.","Halcyondays","Oct 11, 2007"
4.47,9.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Tasty beer but really a bit strong in the mouth and a bit of a challenge for the tongue. I wouldn't turn a glass of this down but I wouldn't drink two bottles of it in a night either. Too intense and complex for merely drinking kind of like the lemon over dose that limoncello delivers. A bit pricey but worth it.","Zorro","Oct 10, 2007"
4.35,6.9,5,5,4,4.5,4,"The flavor could potentially have scored higher if not for the fact that as the beer rested and warmed it changed to that of simply an American IPA. All the Belgian elements were lost in the wash of bitter hops. Now this is not really a bad thing in and of itself, however had it retained it's initial balance between the two it would really be something special.","HugoGrim","Oct 06, 2007"
4.02,-1.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"A good beer that I was looking forward to trying, but the RR Sanctification was far and beyond the stand out go to beer for the weekend.","Onibubba","Sep 25, 2007"
4.6,13,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Flavor is soft malty with a bit of brown sugar and a slight tang that is couched in enough malt to balance the bitterness and tanginess and intense carbonation.","drewbage","Aug 26, 2007"
4.6,13,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is an absolutely kick-ass brew; ample hops and Brett derived funk, how can I not just absolutely love this beer. A beer to satisfy the inner hop head and funk-o-phile at the same time. I am so glad I found this lone, discardedly placed, wayward bottle at Hi-Times. Perhaps not perfect in any category, but I am just really digging everything this beer has to offer right now. I think part of my enjoyment of this beer is that it reminds me of a hoppy, 100% Brett fermented, 5% alcohol beer that I brewed that was just phenomenal. My biggest regret is that I don't have a couple of these to age.","Gueuzedude","Aug 25, 2007"
4.15,2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a slight hazy light amber color and formed a nice foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, hops, citrus and pine. The flavor was of citrus, pine and a touch of pepper. The body is medium light and the finish is a bit sprite, yet also slightly astrigent.","Wildman","Jul 27, 2007"
4.3,5.7,5,5,4,4,4,"This is a pretty aggressive beer for those not accustomed to the character of brett, which has become very prominent. I enjoy the complexity it adds, requiring a slower pace to fully appreciate. However, I thought this was fantastic when I had it fresh on draught, with the strong dry-hopping really nice, and ultimately didn't like this older bottle as much. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and really milked the last 1/2 of the last glass, as I really didn't want it to end!","ccrida","Beers"
3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A pretty good beer, it's release should be good news for any fans of the latest trend of hoppy Belgians.","ChainGangGuy","0"
