Nice aroma of Belgian yeast, bready malt, light fruit juice; apple and stone fruit, cloves. Flavor is light apple and pear juice, clove, light citus and bready malt. Medium bodied with a suprising creaminess. Tastes almost subdued after the aroma, but the light fruit flavor and malt are so nicely melded that this is a delight to drink. Finishes with faint sweet malt and Belgian spicing. Very difficult to believe that this light mellow ale is 8%, the alcohol is completely covered.","LiquidAmber","Nov 04, 2013"

Poured a hazy pale yellow color, produced a nice white head, nice retention and left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of citric lemons, semi-sweet pale malt and floral hops. Medium bodied, a foundation of pale malt, lemon citric hop bitterness and eastery yeast. Finishes dry. Overall, nice version of the style, aggressively hopped and full of malt backbone.

Tastes of funky Belgian yeast with a middling-sized dollop of spicy phenols over the top of a blend of light pear and apple esters with a certain raw cereal graininess and a very light minty hop garnish in the finish. It's pretty good, but the bottled version is not nearly as good as the hazy memory from a certain special night of revelry in which I had it fresh from the tap... sadly, I had forgotten to bring my notebook along that evening and I am left with naught but hazy and nostalgic glowing memories of a draft pour that this bottle did not quite live up to...

On the plus side, this beer sure went down easy, light-bodied, low carbonation, and a barely-noticeable 8%ABV.

Pours a cloudy light bronze with a fizzy white head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of light fruit, telltale Belgian yeast and coriander. Taste is light with non-citrus as well as light non-citrus fruit, also coriander and other "earthy" but light" spice. The elevated ABV is very well buried. Very nice.

Nose is typical of a Belgian Strong Golden, reminiscent of Duvel in many respects. Spicy, light floral, with a touch of alcohol and a prevalent sweetness and some light fruity notes - maybe a hint of pear. Taste is spicy with a high carbonation to compliment it, sweet malts take over as the carbonation trickles away with a flash of alcohol that isn't too subtle. Some mild graininess also. High carbonation with some good drinkability. Not something to usurp Duvel of its title in the style, but certainly pleasant and a nice example.","liamt07","Jul 17, 2011"

It's a full bodied beer. There is a medium amount of carbonation, but it feels lighter than it is. It's as close to a perfect mouthfeel as I can recall having.

It is quite tropical, with lemon zest, apple, pear, melon, oranges, peaches, and pineapple, along with light pepper and some spicy yeast. The flavor is similar, fruity, but not quite as robust as the aroma, along with notes of curacao and perhaps coriander on top of a medium body that is very refreshing for a beer of its strength.

This blonde is awesome and would be great as an after-dinner drink. the alcohol is present but mild as it mingles with the sweetness and the herbal spicyness of the hops. A swirl of the glass actually rejuvenates the aroma. A good froth on the palate releases a good sour taste that adds to the sweetness and the well-rounded hops.

3.35,-14.1,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Pours a brilliantly clear golden color with a massive head and also has a large swarm of bubbles racing to the top as if I'd dropped an alka-seltzer in the bottom of it. The smell of spicey fruit, yeast, malt, and alcohol make up the aroma. The taste has a sharp carb/hop bite off the starting line resembling sticking your tongue to a 9-volt battery and slowly tapers off into a light fruit and spice with yeast and alcohol in the background. It is over-carbonated in my opinion as it creates an almost IPA/Belgian version of a style beer. I believe the flavor would benefit from less carbonation in a big way. It is a medium bodied beer that finishes slightly sweet. I'm a little disappointed in this one. Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","Mar 05, 2004"
3.98,2.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Poured a clear gold with a nice fizzy head. Smelled very nice. Fruitiness abundant. Tastes the same with some spices mixing well with the hops. I had this with dinner and finished the rest with a buddy. A good Belgian pale ale.","AbePhroman","Dec 07, 2003"
4.17,6.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Cork dated 06/2001bottling. Initially pours a perfect pilsener color, but through stages of decanting the entire bottle, it becomes a hazy orangy gold colored brew. Smell is rather Duvelish, light musty and citrusy hop notes that comes across with a clean effervescence that shines in the aroma. Tastes smooth and sweet, with a finish consistent with a Belgian blond, slightly on the drier side. Drinkability is very good.","crookedhalo","Dec 01, 2003"
3.26,-16.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A big, white foamy, smooth head caps the pale, gold, slightly hazy body. Plenty of sediment. The smell is somewhat sour... some apples, some barbershop. The front is spicy/sour, leading through a tingly, fizzy middle to a dry, bitter, peppery finish. Alcohol is present. This has a little more flavor than the Troublette, but I still find it just a bit one-dimensional.","kbub6f","Nov 20, 2003"

4.22,8.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The appearance is hazy and pale golden. The aroma is spice up front, and sweet fruit in the background. Also present in the aroma is lemon. The taste is sweet yet hinted with spice and then the finish is dry. The mouthfeel is big enough to mask the 8% ABV. In fact the alcohol is very understated making this a beer with very good drinkability.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 25, 2003"
4.55,16.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a deep hazy golden color with a magnificent billowing white head that very slowly gives way to a thick and creamy lace. Nose is sweet fruit and fragrant lemon zest with some milder notes of yeast and peppery spice. Moderate in body with a lively and spritzy mouthfeel. Taste begins fruity with a good amount of spice (mostly coriander) followed by a somewhat earthy woodiness. Next comes a bit of grainy yeasts and a good deal of lemon tartness and crispness leading towards a bite of white pepper and a dry finish. A very fine Belgian ale to be had here and dangerously drinkable despite the 8% ABV.","Morris729","Sep 10, 2003"

4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Spice and pale malt with forward sweetness. Actually the sweetness is a little much for me and gets in the way of the drink ability. Grainy heaviness really complex, but at the same time balanced so the result is a medium bodied brew. Corriander flavors also a little heavy fo rme.","Naerhu","May 16, 2003"
3.44,-11.8,3,4,3.5,3,3,"I found this brew to have a fruity and a citrusy aroma to it which I like. It had a medium head on it. There was a lot of carbonation in this brew. In my opinion this brew had a bitter aftertaste to it. All in all this brew was drinkable. It was not a drain pour. Which is not to say that I would drink this particular brew anytime soon though.","hotstuff","Apr 21, 2003"
3.52,-9.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Cork dated 06-2002. This brew pours a medium white head of all sized bubbles that leave a fair lacing. It has a fruity citrusy aroma and a cloudy dark yellow color to its body with carbonation rising up the side of the glass. It has a fizzy fruity citrusy taste. It is very smooth with only a slight bitterness in its aftertaste. All in all a decent brew.","TheDM","Apr 17, 2003"
3.89,-0.3,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Final thoughts? This is a nice interesting ale. I really enjoy the estery flavours, especially when they're not overpowering -- and here they definitely weren't. If I were to suggest an improvement perhaps the slightest touch of sweetness (so you'd hardly notice it) would make it feel even fuller. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again.","Garin","Apr 12, 2003"
4.4,12.8,5,5,4,4,4.5,"This highly carbonated blond ale pours a clear golden color with a quarter inch head that lasted the entire time it took me to drink. The citrusy aroma was exceptonal and the citrus notes came through in the taste as well. The high alcohol also came through in the taste. The carbonation made this a very drinkable and refreshing beer, but with the high alcohol content I'd say this is pretty dangerous. I could see myself drinking several of these before the alcohol hits me.","dmarch","Apr 07, 2003"
4.45,14.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Mostly clear, gold in color with a moderate sized head. The aroma is rather tart, with hints of banana and green apple. Flavor is very smooth, and wonderfully balanced. Wheaty with hints of lemon, mildly spicy throughout, and finished with a gentle touch of herbal hops. Very flavorful for a blond. Body is fairly creamy and a bit viscous in the swallow. A really nice, very drinkable beer. Can't believe the ABV is as high as it is!","mzwolinski","Apr 07, 2003"

A very full-bodied beer to drink, I really enjoyed that. Not watery at all. Very smooth. The taste is not overwhelming, or screaming out this flavor or that flavor. I would recommend this for someone who wants to drink a smooth, full-bodied beer that is amazing light tasting at the same time. Definitely would drink again, no question.","PatandDavid","Feb 26, 2003"
4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: I'm not exactly sure of where to catagorize this brew, perhaps a laid-back Wit that is a little soured. At any rate, I did enjoy it and could see myself buying it again. Not on a regular basis, but now and then when the mood hits...","MJR","Feb 13, 2003"

3.92,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a golden yellow color and formed a light airy white head that subsided quickly and left a little circular lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of floral hops, lemon and grain/yeast. A flavor of hops, cirtrus and wheat. The finish was light for this style and remined more of a wit/wheat style. A good beer, even if not really a good representative of it's style.","Wildman","Jan 16, 2003"
4.12,5.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The pour an indistinct golden yellow with a bright white head that is modest in size, creamy in its texture and the lace nice fine sheets to seal off the glass. Citrus crisp and fresh nose, lemon like, malt and tart to the senses, front begins sweet. Top is slender in feel, finish has a biting acidity and the hops spicy with the aftertaste dry, citrus tart and long lasting, quite a nice drinking beer and well worth the sample.","Gusler","Jan 06, 2003"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Hop lemon nose.  Hazy "white beer" wheat look.  Original taste of lemon and wheat with a smooth mouth.  Lasting white head and lace.  Slight alcohol finish.  Very smooth blonde.  A big wheat base is apparent which pumps the ABV.  This beer is a Hoegarden on steroids!","frank4sail","Oct 11, 2002"
4.75,21.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I really like this beer from its yellowish orange appearance with white head that lasted to the last swig. Great hop taste with a nice lemon like aroma. Light in body with a lot of carbonation. Certainly worth a try.","Reverand","Sep 21, 2002"
3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3,3,4.5,"Turbid golden hue, topped by a moderate head that leaves... Belgian lace. Lemony, wheaty, and fruity aroma w/ mild phenol & a hint of peppery alcohol.  A touch tame in aroma.  Tart fruit & black pepper upfront, follwed by shandy - like flavors & mild hop bitterness.  Light in body, quite dry and well (perhaps overly so) attenuated.  Residual malt sweetness is minimal.  Finishes a bit tart, clean, and perhaps a bit bland.  Flavorwise, this is perhaps the most understated Belgian Strong I've had.  Perhaps my bottle (12 oz.) was old or the 750 ml bottles are better.  Highly drinkable, however.","marc77","Jul 31, 2002"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Richly complex drawing on the grain flavours, hop character and by products of the yeast to push the envelope in brings full and bold flavours. Not as clean as other strong pales and more on the raw side.","Jason","Feb 21, 2002"
