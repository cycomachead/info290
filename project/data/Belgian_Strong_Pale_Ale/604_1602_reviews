"Food match: Ibuprofen, Panadol and Aspirin - pick your poison. Or cheese platter."
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."

"Here's to life"
"O: Mellowed as it went on but not a subtle beer, I would describe this as Belgium’s equivalent of Special Brew, I think I’ll put the remaining 3 bottles away and hope that age calms them."
""
"This poured a translucent copper colour and produced a thin white ring of head.  The nose leads with toffee and malt.  There is a sweet fruitiness as well along with dates and dark fruit.  The flavour is much of the same along with an alcohol warmness.  Not the burn that you might expect with a 11.8% ABV.  The mouthfeel is a bit on the syrupy side but that adds to the experience because the carbonation balances it out."
"O: Can't taste the alcohol in this one."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18E). Bottle 33 cl - Batch B4 07 4. AROMA: sweet malt background with caramel and spicy notes. strong spicy alcohol presence but not solventy. APPEARANCE: coppery color and translucent. average ivory head with good retention. lacing is present due to high alcohol derived viscosity. TASTE: sweet caramely like flavour. high alcohol presence. low bitterness and a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-low body with a strong alcohol presence. OVERALL: a beer that lacks the malt complexity of the competition and with a very strong alcohol presence."

"Pours a hazy orange with a big head that dissipates quickly. Grape scents with a candied scent. Very nice lacing and a great mouthfeel. There isn't too strong of an alcohol taste. This is a definite must buy for a real drinker."

"Poured into snifter. Clear orange-amber beer with one finger off-white head. Smell of yeasts, caramel, pale malts, hint of spices. Flavour is rich and alcoholic, warming, semeisweet, malts, yeasts, caramel. Oily, sticky, boozy. Actually, excellent representative of the style."

"O-This was an outstanding beer with plenty going on"
""
"OVERALL - A very well balanced Tripel. The sweetness works, and the ABV doesn't hit you. Quaffable, but not chuggable. Do not limit this to dessert only."

"This has just hit the list of one of my favorite beers. I have nothing negative to say about this beer. I will buy again!"
""
"A worry free sipper that allows for pure enjoyment if you take your time."

"Unlike the nose the taste is more in your face, bigger fig and prune notes. The maltyness is prominent with a slight and I mean slight alcohol in the back."
"a classic belgian strong amber beer with a lot of character. the most impressive thing about it is the feel, and how well it hides its intense alcoholic strength, its barley there, not the least bit hot, and rather smooth drinking as a result. slightly hazy orangey amber in color with a patchy white head that lasts. i smell a lot of residual sugar here, sweet dusty almost english type grain on this, with a robust belgian yeast strain that gives off some dried apricot notes and maybe even a little apple. the sweetness is there, but its short lived, the finish is still pretty quick on it, and the big carbonation makes it drink a little cleaner too. i like the elegant simplicity of this beer, despite also being dynamic and very strong, it comes across well refined and completely dialed in. they do a refermented in the bottle addition of this, which i have to imagine is even more enjoyable with the rest of its sugar gone, but i like the little brother edition here. definitely an underrated brew."

"O/D-Not something I would ever buy. Happy I didn't pay for this and I sampled from a friend. Not what I'm looking for in a beer but I can see why someone who loves their Belgian sweet-brews would love its hot, sticky goodness."

"O - The best Belgian beer I have had."

"The beer was poured from the bottle into a glass. The appearance was okay, nothing special but also not bad. The taste was not good, in my opinion. Not balanced, too heavy alcohol taste, for my taste. Very strong sweetness. The beer was nice and thick though. Overall, not bad but also not great."
"O: Must try this one. Noted for its alcohol presence, but is a good Belgian as well. A little too much alcohol for my liking, but I love its uniqueness."

"Appears as a cloudy, dark maize. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of alcohol, slight dark fruit, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, dark citrus, hint of pale malt, and a hint of spice. Overall, very similar to Kwak, with more pronounced alcohol flavor."
"O: The ideal sipper to relax with at the end of the day."

"Afterall a good special Strong Pale Ale from Dubuisson Bush Ambrée."

"This beer is one of my favorite to have with food. Bitter, sweet and rich beers work well with more complex food profiles. Salty foods in general is something I would suggest."

" the flavor of this belgian is malty with tropical yeast which has a ripe banana element with slight spice -almost peppery but still has a mild caramel flavor with gentle sugary background flavor with a good amount of alcohol in the flavor, but not in an offensive way, just adds to the complexity with some woody hop and mild citrus elements in the peripheral taste. I am not sure why I passed on this before..It is a festive beer that I could have shared, but I am glad I didn't. The overall drinkability for a beer this strong is exceptional. It is pretty warming but that is part of the charm since the malt flavor and obvious candy sugar usage are utilized so well."
"Overall a solid strong ale, but would taste better with less booziness."
""
""
"Overall: This is closer to a finishing brandy or a barelywine than a beer. Wish I had more to say about this, as it received some great reviews from others and I want to like it, but...the alcohol dominates."
""
""
"Mouth feel is rich, thick and solid as you would expect with such a high gravity beer...full, semi sweet, luscious and frothy as the carbonation hits the tongue....this is what high gravity, full bodied, desert wine style speciality beers are all about!....lovely stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Thoroughly enjoyed this. Poured from a bottle into oversized wine glass at Monk’s Pub in downtown Chicago. Has a hazy, buckwheat honey color with brown hues. No head, but great lacing left on the glass- tan/white in color. Texture is extremely impressive, very thick without being haughty. Tastes like heaven, or hella caramel, whatever you want to call it. Amber malt, bittersweet finish and dry personality. Great."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty solid PA, but far from the best. It's worth trying if you like the style. Satisfying but not necessarily extremely memorable."
""
""
""
""
"O-My expectations of a simple, highly boozy pale ale were met here. The flavors are not bad, but are mostly overwhelmed by the alcohol, which leaves you with a sweet, sort-of cough syrup-like approximation of a pale ale. I won't go searching for this brew again, but it was not terrible by any means."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, yeast, fruits, and grape juice. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the alcohol is pretty noticeable and makes the flavor a bit abrasive."
""
""
"O- Packs a punch without being too overwhelming. Certainly a sipper, but is refined enough to greatly appreciate."
""
""
""
""
"This beer takes the strong of Belgian Strong Pale Ale to heart. It is much stronger than other beers of this style and therefore has some traits that I haven't seen in similar beers. Some will be put off by this beer's strength, but if that doesn't bother you, it is a fine beer to slowly enjoy."
""
""
"O: Off balance as it falls into the pits of becoming a liquor. The warming of the liquor didn't help the tastes which were hard to get into the mouth because of the burning eyes. At 12% the alcohol is wacky, but nothing I haven't seen before. Heavy handed, which leaves the brew rather a novelty instead of a drinkable delight."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is rather sweet, more so than I expected for the style but not cloying... Not the easiest beer to drink as the alcohol is quite present in the taste/smell/mouthfeel. Enjoyable but definitely a beer that needs to be sipped over a couple of hours. This would be perfect to sip in front of the fireplace with a nice cigar on a cold winter evening."
"Overall this isn't bad, but has a real weak body that doesn't seem to carry the palates flavors. It feels lighter than 12 ABV, but does come off just a little boozy and tasteless. It's ok, but I don't think it's also very easy to drink or enjoy."
""
"Pours out a semi dark copper color and is topped off with a nice thick head that could float a anvil. The head is an off white color and sticks around for quite a while and is accompanied by some good lacing. The floating fermentation looks very inviting! The aroma is rather light but very complex. There’s plenty of yeast, dark fruits, esters, caramel, fig, mild grape and malts in the smell. It has a much lighter body than you would expect, very drinkable, but still on the lighter side of being medium bodied oddly enough. All of these flavors blend together into one wave that just slowly rides over the tongue. No cloying sweetness, crisp finish. With a dash of medicinal herbs mixed in, this beer is just simply incredible in its subtlety and complexity."
"D - A sipper."
"O - Really poor drinkability because of the overpowering alcohol. It really spoiled my tasting! Fortunately, aromas are exceptional and bring this brew above the average. 3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped and makes for a good choice to finish the night with. It almost seems like a hybrid between a whiskey and a beer."
""
"O-really balanced and flavorful. Exceptional for the alcohol content"
""
"O: Great beer. Belgian to the bone"
""
"I would give this a five but I believe it was expired. Can someone explain how to read the expiration, thanks! Okay, I'll write more. I love the little bottle, love that it is from Belgium. I love that is 12 percent alcohol. It looked nice in a glass. The smell was wonderful. Fruity. The expiration is impossible for me to read. I think it actually from 10, If so, it was still amazing. Wife asked why there was stuff floating, one of the reasons I think it was expired. It was still drinkable."
""
""
"Overall - Holy booze! This beer might need some age to tone down the alcohol flavour.. Still an interesting beer to try, but not something I'd grab again. It's basically like a barley wine but without the sweetness."
"B-"
""
""
""
""
"Incredible incredible brew."
"D- this is a pretty intense beer. Alcohol and sugar battle it out for twelve rounds with sugar winning by decision. This 8+ oz bottle is the perfect serving size for this potent beast, as any more would be a bit too much. Having a tulip with a 0,25L market makes it even cooler."
""
"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with numerous floaters. Thin head and little lacing. Sweet malt and slightly sour aroma. Light fruit, sweet malt, Belgian yeast and caramel. Booze fairly evident and overwhelms the otherwise pleasant flavors. A satisfactory pale Belgian ale, but nothing really outstanding."
""
"O: Good, but pretty intense and not for regular drinking."
""
"O: incredible for alcohol"
""
"Overall: While this bottle is, I suspect, quite a few years beyond the ""Best By"" date, it is still drinking very nicely and, as others have noted, takes on Barleywine-like characteristics"
"O: good, but kind of weird in a way I can't put into words easily. It has all of the makings of a good beer of the style, but it was missing balance or something."
""
"DOA"
"This was a very tasty beer, all of the flavors were well balanced, even the very noticeable alcohol presence seemed to fit well into the flavor."
""
""
""
"Nice enough to the eye but makes very little effort to appeal to the other vital senses. Dull."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: I was expecting less, so this was definitely a surprise… None of the astringent notes I found in other Bush/Scaldis offerings and instead a rather assertive but enticing brew. Nothing to make a milestone of but rather notable. Old aleish at points even English barleywine with some central European hints…"
""
""
"Drinkability: This definitely gets two thumbs up, but I now understand why it is offered in 250 ml bottles. Though it is very well masked, the alcohol is still potent."
""
""
""
"Poured a 2"" beige head with decent retention. Body is a cross between golden yellow and amber and held to the light it shows clouding from fine particulates. Smell is really good with malt and caramel. Taste is rich with malt, caramel, and toffee, and it's creamy and sweet. There's a medium-long finish which feels like you just ate a sweet dessert. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"Scaldis is roughly what I expected. Altogether a beer with good flavor and a great amount of heat. More of a digestif than a beer to drink with dinner."
""
""
"From a personal standpoint, the presence of the ""Belgian funk"" common with Belgian yeast is barely there, which is a good thing. This is a fantastic Belgian beer that I would not only drink again, but recommend."

" My sorta brew."
"O - The balance is off in this beer. Its not going to be something I drink often."
"O- Overall a belgium of the bat. perfectly subtle and spiced. Perfect cant wait to drink my Noel."
"A quality brew, but not to my taste. Just too sweet."
"Overall decent, nice malts and hint of hops, a bit on the hot and boozy side but expected for 12%."
"Scaldis is strong and solid, but not that impressive in the end."
"Overall: This was a surprise. I thought it was a quad. If it is, it would have to be like a ""golden quad"" as it has none of the dark fruit flavors of a typical quad. Its pretty nice though. I was going to bitch more about the small bottle, but its the right serving size."
"Read this and a comparison of a few other high gravity beers at my blog at dearmondfood.blogspot.com"
"DRINK (3.5/5) Very flavorful and so tasty! It has a kinda port. More of a sipper, not a session."
"O- Looks great, smells insanely great... but starts falling off from there. The taste is good, but not like the nose says it should be. The mouthfeel is nothing like the smell... thin, whimpy and a bit to boozey (even for me!). Really glad I tried this, and plan to get more to stock away for a cold, wet, damp, rainy day next to the fire place."
"Overall this was very enjoyable"
"overall def. worth trying...not the most complex beer in the world though"
"A nice beer but with a strong alcohol presence."
"While drinking this you can tell it is the real deal. This was my first taste of this beer but I would consider buying it again."
"After a few tries and sips, I threw the rest away."
"The flavors are creamy, so it only makes sense that the mouthfeel is too. The style calls for more carbonation, but the relative lack of it in Scaldis makes sense. Overall, this is a solid, above-average beer. It is too unique to be corralled into the world of Duvel clones. It's a Belgian Strong Amber Ale, with all of the unique flavors that would come from such an imaginary style. Definitely worth a try."
"I was surprised by this beer. At first I thought it would be bland or just strong tasting but I was pleasantly surprised. The foam on the beer was somewhat big but it disapated quickly to leave just a thin scattered foam on top of a medium amber colored beer that I poured into a goblet to enjoy. I thought the smell was clean but it did not give a hint of the nice taste of the beer which was smooth with some carbonation with some hops and a light maltiness. The mouthfeel was very enjoying causing one to really savor the taste. Overall Bush is really a good beer and I hope to get to Brussels to bring more home."
"... if only the smell were a tick more pleasant ...."
"Notes: Awesome beer. A gargantuan brew that is delicate and complex, fruity and spicy and even hoppy as well as amazingly light even with the blatant booziness. A deft hand brews this bad boy."
"Overall. Good tasting but a little too sweet and boozy for me."
"O: A really good Belgian Strong Pale Ale; different from others I've had; not as sticky/sweet or heavy; the familiar Belgian candied sugar flavors aren't here"
"Stuff rocks my socks. You can make this four pack last for days. One of 'em is a night cap. Two of 'em is the start of a good night. Three of 'em and you can forget about playing darts. Finish four in a session and get meet your floor."
"Pours a rich golden color, perfectly clear and bone white head retains well and leaves excellent lace. Yeasty, green apple, fruity belgian yeast, light citrus hopping and an overall dynamite flavor profile. Full rich body. Deceptive @ 12% ABV, this one can really do some damage. Luxurious smooth feel, overall a pristine Belgian brew and one worthy of the praise. Fantastic."
"M: A good sipper of a beer. A bit hot though."
"D. A delicious Belgian beer that caresses the taste buds and keeps you all aglow during the winter months."
"Body is very thick and syrupy, could do with a little more carbonation."
"250 ml bottle into snifter. Pours hazy orange-amber color with a 1 finger off white head with good retention, and decent lacing. Aromas of dark fruits, spices, molasses, caramel, and a little bit of alcohol. Taste of spices, dark fruits, molasses, and some alcohol making the flavor seem a bit off. There is a giant alcohol warming after the finish that sticks around for a while. Medium carbonation and full body. Overall, it's not bad, actually has a lot of flavor. The only bad thing is that the alcohol can over power the flavors a bit at times, but the flavors do shine through at some points. It is definitely a sipper, and would be impossible to have more than one at a given time in my opinion. Pretty good."
"O: Decent beer with drinkability. Not as smooth as would have liked."
"D: Too much bitter honey in its taste for me and although it rather smooth even with the noticeable alcohol, a couple of these would be too much for most."
"Drinkability-Worth 1-3, much past that and it won't matter."
"Solid beer but not ""exceptional""."
"While i still enjoyed this beer, belgium has far more to offer."
"Drinkability is not great, but that's somewhat expected for such a strong style. The almonds notes were not appealing to me."
"D - Very delectable, but at 12%, how many can one have? This is a tastey beer, but on the downside, it leaves a heavy sugary aftertaste which drags the drinkability factor down."
"D - Big, sweet and boozy makes it tough to have more than one."
"Drinkability: This beer is definitely a sipper."
"D - It's not hard to drink, but it's a strong one and you can taste that along with all the other complex layers of this delightful beer, enjoy!"
"Very enjoyable strong ale, mighty at 12 abv, a great sipper. Not something you would gulp or session though. I'd like to have it again."
"jd"
"In small doses, however, this is a great beer worth seeking out."
"M, D - Medium-heavy, with a viscous feel. The alcoholic strength will moderate the pace of consumption for most."
"D: One of the Belgiums must have. I like it."
"Scaldis is a beer you should only buy if you know what you're getting into. It's very expensive (I think I got four 250ml bottles for around $16~, possibly more), and it's also very distinctive. If you want the burn of hard liquor and some whiskey reminiscent flavor profiles, along with subtle Belgian yeast and hops, and some big bready malt, this beer is exactly what you want."
"D - This beer delivers on what is promised by the aroma--a big, boozy celebration of malted barley. It proves a big beer doesn't need spices or fruit to make a statement. This is as simple and direct as it gets. I wouldn't advise having more than one at a sitting, but I'll take it any day as a substitute for brandy or an after-dinner liquor by the fire."
"This to me is very reminiscent of the more potent trappist beers. Maybe it's just the phenolic overtones but this tastes to me more like a triple than a pale ale. Tricky taste to unlock but well worth the effort. Now if only this was a mere 8%..."
"D: Low drinkability because of the high alcohol content, but I must give it a 4 because its delicious! I could definitely/obviously not session with it, but it is easy to drink the one I'm drinking."
"The taste is apricot, belgian hops and malt. The beer is rather sweet but not too sweet. Nice mouth feel and pretty drinkable for a strong one! This beer is worth seeking out. Reasonably priced as well."
"I don't think I could drink a bottle of this. The small pour that I did get I actually had to share to finish. The alcohol just strikes me as too poweful. I don't know if the brewers were going for boozy for the sake of boozy just to lay claim to the title of ""strongest beer in Belgium," but it seems that way."
"D - This beer has been patiently waiting for a proper introduction, the ugly girl standing in the corner of the ballroom. I'm very glad I got over my cold feet and introduced myself. What a true delight."
"drinkability - huge alcohol warmth, complex, strong, flavorful"
"This was boozy, so drinkability was low for me - I could only have one."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and alcohol nose. Flavor is sweet, dark fruit and some alcohol. Warming, nice strong ale. $4.75 for a 250ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D - This beer really manages to pack a lot of flavor into its diminutive bottle. The yeast aroma is nearly perfect with nice, soft notes of malt and an ideal yeast profile. The flavor has much of the same character, but with harsher phenolic notes and an intensity imparted by the high alcohol content. The lingering malt and yeast notes create even more complexity on the palate in the aftertaste with a creamy, boozy fruit character that is pleasantly brandy-like. A very nice beer overall, it doesn't get as much attention as beers like Duvel and Westmalle, but it is every bit their equal."
"Notes: This is an strange little beer in that it is a strong, Quad, but the flavors aren't what you would expect from that style. This is more similar to a stronger Tripel or BSPA compared to other Quads being more like a stronger Dubble or BSDA (although it isn't exactly like either of those 2 styles). Alcohol is very present and so it is reminiscent of a fruity liqueur or a fortified wine, and is probably best thought of as something similar to those when you are deciding when/how to drink it or treat it. Taste nice and is worth trying, but I won't really be seeking it out."
"D-a good sipping beer, but with the high ABV it would be tough to have more than one"
"It was quite drinkable. I enjoyed it, but I was slightly disappointed. I had high hopes, because I really like quads."
"Too strong and heavy to have more than one, and it was too sweet for my liking, but I'm glad I tried it as it was decent."
"I really enjoyed this one. Would buy again, if I can find it again."
"Overall a complex and tasty beer, recommended for sure."
"D: The alcohol is hidden quite well with this beer, so buyers beware."
"Overall, this is a wonderful brew that's worth your time."
"Drinkability: I picked this out randomly as a single from the store. At $9 bucks per, I wouldn't buy 12 of them for a Friday night and go crazy. But I will look to pick it up occasioanlly as a single again. At 12% alcohol I think this was very easy and a joy to drink."
"From the 250 ml. bottle. There is a space on the label for an expiration date but it does not appear to be clipped. Sampled on February 21, 2010. It pours a pretty nice looking amber color with a decent inch inch of silky, slowly diminishing head. The aroma has a decent caramel note but it tends to be more in the way of light hops and alcohol. The 12% ABV is quite apparent in the taste and even though it comes on strong and sweet; it also rips through the throat with a firey pungency. The aroma is constant as you drink it. In some respects I found this to be a fabulous beer but I also found it to be just a bit too heavy for my liking."
"d - Pretty good but kind of hot. The high ABV is definitely felt and was the only real negative to this one. Definitely worth checking out though."
"D – This stuff is super fine. Especially aged 3 years like this little 8 oz. bottle."
"We brought this back from Belgium this fall. Bush Ambrée pours a hazy yellow with a nice fluffy head that lingers. The aroma is sweet fruity esters and light malt with some vinous character. The flavor is sweet light malt with plenty of yeasty, fruity esters and some phenolic taste. The finish is sweet and sharp, only at the very end hinting at the alcohol content. I wouldn't put it quite on par with the Trappist Quads, but it is a solid beer overall."
"This is a full-bodied beer, and the mouthfeel is absolutely full, almost cloyingly. In a good way. This is a sipper, though. Enjoy it."
"*= Ideas from fellow taster"
"D this is a strong beer, i will try it again with food next time (hearty meat dish)"
"Her copper-colored dress off aromas of honey, strong, powerful and caramels a touch of hazelnut. Unfortunately, alcohol is much too noticeable in the mouth and final, this coupled with a bitterness too pronounced in the finish, we get an unbalanced beer. Certainly, it has nevertheless a special taste and richly observed, but in my opinion, alcohol is much too far to fully appreciate the flavors of this beer."
"Drinkability: I paid $3.99 for this at least three years ago, if not four or five, so this stuff ain't cheap. Therefore, the price to quality ratio goes down a bit, as this is no holy grail of brew. That said, this could probably last many more years, and I'm glad I got to try it."
"Full bodied, with a malt heavy, sherry like character. I thoroughly enjoyed this bad boy and man did the 12% creep up."
"Reminds me of a sweet sparkling white Italian wine."
"As one of my first Quads years ago, I really enjoyed this, but revisiting it now, I realize it isn't really on the same level as the top tier examples - still, worth picking up if you enjoy the style."
"D: Being that this brew is so well balanced, it'd be easy to go overboard considering the high alcohol content."
"Drank in the company of Joey Capps and JadoreBlanche at Chester's, in Hamilton, Ontario. Pours a cloudy orange body, with a a very thin coat of beige head to lock in the goodness. Lots of sediment flating around as well. Very nice looking brew. Aromas are of caramel, some sweet orange/citrus notes, corriander, very spicy. Taste is sweet, spices, orange rind, malty undertones, complex. Fairly smooth finish, full bodied, with a warming alcohol feeling. Great example."
"Not recommended."
"A suberb beer for cold winter days."
"Feel and Drinkability: Feel is medium. Higher alcohol and carbonation try to trick you but its a bit heavier than that. It feels great in the mouth, just like a sessionable amber. This is a very dangerously drinkable beer, easy to drink and easy to drink a lot of. Hard to say no to another one of these. It'll get you though...heh heh. This is one that I'll be sure to pick up again. Great beer, highly recommended. Like I said, the coolest thing about this beer is that its so strong but without it stated on the label you might be left guessing as to how strong this one is. That's what I think is so cool about it."
"Scarily easy to drink given its abv. Overall a good beer."
"Overall, Bush Ambrée tastes like a very strong tripel that is less yeasty and, therefore, sweeter than what would be considered typical of a tripel. Does that qualify it as a quadrupel? I don't know."
"Tight balance, strong flavors. This is a good beer. 8.48 ounces just isn't enough."
"D-An interesting brew. This is not one that hides the alcohol, though. It is warm and obvious."
"On tap at the Cheeky Monk in Denver. Clear orange color with a small white head. Aroma is mainly malty with caramel and bready malt as well as some spices and light fruit notes. Flavor is fairly sweet with caramel, spices, apple, pear, and a little alcohol. Body is medium and carbonation is medium-high. Fairly drinkable. This is decent but nothing to write home about."
"I would suggest that this beer be drunk a little cooler than a Belgian strong dark ale, as it becomes a little cloying with warmth. A brilliant sipping beer that has character to match its towering strength. A true Belgian classic."
"D - Would not search this one out not bad but the 12% ABV gives you a warm feeling even after one."
"Enjoyed at Cafe Hollander in Wauwatosa, WI as part of their first Belgian Beer Dinner. This beer was poured into a small wine glass and served close to room temperature. It had a reddish-mahogany body with a little bit of foam around the sides of the glass. Aromas of dried cherries, cinnamon, and oak. Full bodied mouthfeel that coats your tongue in silky sweet malts with a pleasant alcohol warmth. This is the perfect substitute for an after-dinner port."
"I would serve this versus dessert cordials to discerning friends (but if they didn't finish it I'd swig the remainders in the kitchen)."
"The flavor is very similar to the aroma in that there agai is a nice fruit presence countered by a strong spicey character and lots of alcohol heat. Light fruits like apple, pear and grape appear as well as some subtle hops and a very prominent cinnamon/peppery spiciness. The ABV is not very well hidden. Then again it is 12% but there is a ton of alcohol astringency and warmth in the finish."
"Pours a red-orange with a small beige head that fizzes away to a thin ring rather quickly. Smells sweet and spicy; definitely some citrus there. The alcohol definitely is part of the taste (expected from a 12%), but surprisingly not overpowering. Besides the alcohol, there were hints of fruit with the malt flavor. Not a big fan of strong beers, so not very drinkable in my opinion."
"Poured a dark orange body with a healthy two-finger head that left lace patches running down the glass. A mix of caramel malt, yeast, orange and other heav fruits along with a tad bit of hop bitterness. A medium-to-full body that had some nuttiness/breadiness malts to it along with minor touches of sweet malts like caramel, toffee and bitter chocolate. A little spicy and yeasty as well; has some minor hop bitterness also (yes, I ended a sentence w/ a preposition). Must say, while the ABV could be partially responsible for the drying backbite, it is mostly hidden (I would've guessed 8 or 9, tops, not at all 12). Some decent fruit tastes like orange, cherry and grape. A very enjoyable Belgian to sit back with and enjoy."
"Likely a nice drink perhaps with some cheeses and some desserts; not particularly food friendly. Likely also a sipping beer."
"Overall, it's heavy duty, a slow sipper, but a tasty one, the small bottle is enough to do some damage, maybe a 11.2 ounce bottle would be suitable but this is not a session beer just a good treat once in a while."
"Not my favorite quad but still a rich and malty pleasure. This beer is a light, sweet version of a quad, and I don't mean light in terms of lacking in flavor but being more pale malt assertive. The aroma is caramel and apricots. It's a dump truckful of pale malt flavor. There is some Belgian fruitiness in there, but it's not terribly earthy, which is my preferred Belgian flavor. There's some good spice on the tongue. The pepper prickles things up, but the malt gets a bit cloying. It's a very good beer but only a good quad."
"Hazy auburn color with an immense tan poof that lasted as long as there was liquid to support it. The aroma is sweet, like burnt or caramelized sugar, with some spices and lots of esters. The taste was sweet but hot with alcohol. Like a brandy this burns my uvula, warming my digestive system as it goes down. Delicious but too high ABV to be easily chugged."
"D- Ummm, how do I say this...Only drink one. It is big, it is only a 250ml but once it warms up it loses the sweet and fruity character and becomes just drinking alcohol. If this was a 10% beer it could be excellent. 12% is a bit much to me but that is also my palate. Took me 45 minutes to drink this puppy. If it is cold and kept cold it is a good beer. Once warm I lost interest quickly."
"I liked this beer a ton until I wound up with that finish that just leaves you with quite the alcohol burn. It's that feeling you get after taking a hearty sip of your favorite brandy or something. As much as I wanted to like the beer, that point really got in the way, especially towards the end."
"D - The high ABV make this a beer that shouldn't be just knocked backed, however, the well balanced flavours makes this hard to abide by. Although the taste and smell makes it quite clear that the alcohol in this beer is high, I still found it very moreish."
"Beware the 12% abv, but try this beer as soon as you find it!"
"D= This is a very sweet and very strong ale. It is no surprise that they put it into tiny bottles! Though the flavor made me want multiple bottles, the strength was huge and in most cases would keep me at one bottle."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but there is a bit of astringency in the finish that detarcts a bit. Flavor is quite interesting for a quad--fruitiness dominates, rather than wine-like notes. Aged taste and strong alcohol makes this seem like a tripel on steroids. The finish is tart and has a pleasing lingering bitterness that makes you want to continue to drink. Drinakable for such a big beer. Well done and unique."
"From a small bottle, this beer pours a clear amber color with a simple white head. It's a pretty beer, but not exceptional. I was a little disappointed in the aroma, which is very quite. There is some pale malt and herbal hop aroma, along with a little perfumy ester quality. Besides a hot alcohol smell, that's about it. Average. The taste is solid, however, lots of caramelized sugars and malts. Some warmth. The taste has a slight yeast character and a little frontside sweetness. The beer finishes really dry however. It's a pretty full beer despite the dry ending, and has a richness to it's body. Not bad."
"Finally decided to buy one of these cute little bottles. Kind of like a Belgian Hardy's, but not as good. Pours a glowing orangish brown with a lacy tan head. Nose has candy malts, ripe fruit, light floral hops, sweet alcohol and spicy Belgian yeast. Taste is also on the sweet side. Lots of fruit and caramel malts. Peppery alcohol and herby yeast. Thick body with delicate carbonation. Drinks easy for a twelve percent ale."
"D - Extremely drinkable. The 12% is hidden well. Big fruitiness and low phenolic character suit my palate well."
"The foam after it was poured was wheat in color, bubbly and diddapated quickly. Color was amber/bronze with gold/yellow highlights. Smell had a fruity first impression with wheat and hops balance and a carmel undertone. Taste was deep and heavy with also a wheat and hops balance. Felt very robust for an ale and a small bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel - full-bodied and somewhat smooth. Drinkability was really good except the deep feel dominated the palate."
"D: For a quad this is highly drinkable, what takes away from the taste makes up in drinkability."
"Splitting an 8 oz bottle is where it's at."
"Terrific balance, winderful aroma and high drinkability. A Fantastic beer."
"For me this is a sipping beer and the alcohol content definitely plays a role in the drinkability."
"For such a strong beer, very drinkable. Nice beer."
"Pours a red/brown cloudy colored body, with little head, white, and diminishing. Has an alcoholy floral aroma. Also, a deep earthy aroma. Has a strong alcoholy, dark fruit taste. Almost like rubbing alcohol. Very hot, could use some cellaring."
"Drinkability: wouldn't be my first choice of a belgian style double or triple but I wouldn't refuse it."
"Bought this 250ml bottle at Binny's Chicago. Bought it for the size and the ABV. Pours a quality head 1.5"" and stayed until the first sip. It dissipated after the first sip to a faint top and laces the glass nicely. The color is a yellow raisin and the immediate taste is that of sweet raisin with a jab of alcohol. 12%abv., that combined with the taste and there is no doubt this beer is fortified with extras like fruit and or other sugars. A good example of Belgian beer in the US that is not from the mass marketed types like Duvel, Chimey. Dogfishhead Midas Touch come to mind..."
"The first thing I noticed is the small 8.4 oz bottle it came in, with a golden foil over the cap. A ripe peach color with a slight head that faded quickly. Some tropical fruit and alcohol on the nose, not overpowering. I could taste the warmth from the alcohol immediately and it lingered for a good while. This is my first quad so I don't have others in the category to compare it to, but a great introduction."
"Notes from: 07/12/04."
"For a brew kicking in at 12% ABV this is damn good. Not something i'd like to have more than one of during a night but it does make a perfect sipper or something to pair with a dessert. Good stuff!"
"(rated Apr 3, 2007)"
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours hazy amber with a thick, rocky off-white head. Funky sweet aroma, lots of caramel and sugar, bubblegum, red apple, bread, and maple syrup. Strong flavor. Yeast ester bubblegum with nougat, but blended with a sourness and oak. More flavor comes out as it warms. Sherry, cherry, butterscotch, orange candy, and brown sugar blend with the early tastes. Somewhat heavy, and the alcohol is very warm."
"D: Not so much so. It's good tasting and smooth, but the alcohol OMG are you serious? It's so strong it like a bottle of Burberry purfume...it's so delicious at first. After that, it's just harsh. Love this, but for my body it's not humanly possible to make this a regular. I wish."
"D: On the whole, a very good example of a quad. Very tasty."
"Good viscous body with a fluffy, full feel as it sits in your mouth...smooth. Way to drinkable for a beer this big and a great quad, none the less. Belgian skills!"
"The taste is very well balanced, light and rather mild. Very drinkable. Alcohol is perfectly hidden for it being so high."
"Though full of sweetly succulent flavors, the balance is very malt-forward-- similar to Samichlaus while finishing generously sweet, fruity and spicy."
"250ml bottle. Hazy dark yellow ale, with a huge thick off white head. Maty aroma,slight medicinal/spice hints, alcoholic.Sweet aromas Sweet malty flavours, esters, spicy,medicinal hints, actually slight alcohol for the strength. Thick and luxurous on the palte..nice alcohol warmth in the belly. An OK drink..one for after dinner sipping..which I am partaking of now."
"Drinkability is good, like I said it's not to sweet. A really good unique belgium brew. Try it!"
"D - Drinkability is very limited. I'm not afraid of a beer with some alcoholic punch, but this shows off the alcohol way too much. I don't think ethanol necessarily needs to be *completely* cloaked in a beer, but it's too naked here."
"The smell was fruity and of sweet caramel. The taste was powerfully alcoholic at first then got better the more it warmed. It was sweet and the caramel was the first thing I could taste. It was moderate to highly carbonated. It was pretty bitter on the finish. Overall a quality Quad."
"taste is thick and creamy, roasted caramel, sweet fruits, with a sticky mouthfeel."
"On tap at The Back Abbey in Claremont, CA. Poured into a Delirium Tremens glass, a clear reddish-brown body with a light tan head. The smell is very sugary and raisiny. It's easy to tell you're in for a sweet treat here. I have a real problem with beers that are really sugary (ie Leffe Brune) but although this beer delivers a big sweetness, the alcohol punch and small amount of Belgian yeast character it provides is enough to not overbear me. The mouthfeel is a bit slick but somewhat medium in body. I drank this beer really fast as a digestif to my lunch, so it must be good if I was able to do that."
"d- felt very syrupy on the tongue. Maybe this one was just flat because it didn't have very much carbonation or head. I drank it only days after purchasing though. I was disappointed in the taste but I am feeling the alcohol! I would not be able to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Overall, I liked this one a lot. I can see why they put it in such a small bottle, but wouldn't mind it in a normal one. It has characteristics of a few different types of drink, which I liked. Complex, not enough to turn someone off, but maybe slightly more than I would have liked to make it a favorite. Will buy again though."
"Picked up a bottle to have as a nightcap this past Friday. Poured into my mini-Scaldis chalice (own one, why not use it?). No real head, very low amount of carbonation. Dark orange color. The smell was a bit sugar and somewhat floral. The first sip reminded me a lot of apples. Not really what I expected from a quad. I found this beer to be a bit thicker that I remembered, and not as flavorful as I had hoped. A bit too sticky sweet. A had a Bush on draft while in Brussels last year, and thought it was great. This, not so much. Kind of a let down."
"Served in a goblet, the beer was a clear golden color with a small head. A decent amount of lacing. The aroma was sweet fruit with a little malt. More fruit in the taste, as well as some spice. Warmth from the alcohol also apparent. Pretty full-bodied, and a bit of a handful. One of these was enough."
"Very enjoyable, but the alcohol warming reminds you of its strength. One is enough to sip on."
"Very creamy, with the alcohol very warming but also palate destroying. Amazing beer, but one of these is all I could take, and thank goodness it is 250ml. Any more and it would be way too much. A definite treat for all advocates."
"The draft version definitely had some subtle aspects that made it better than the bottle. Even if it is just the joy of getting it on draft. Would recommend this Belgian Ale to one and all"
"Overall this is a decent quad. It definetly will warm you up with the ABV content."
"Along with Corsendonk, this was one of the very first Belgians that entirely changed my thoughts on beer. Even among Belgian beers it stands alone. One of the country's finest. Well worth the price, too, even in these stupidly tiny bottles."
"D - Didn't really like this beer too much. Alcohol overwhelmed a lot of what this beer had going for it."
"I would have rated this higher in the drinkability area if not for the alcohol presence which took center stage in the taste department. I prefer a little more balance in my beer. I'd like to try another bottle at some point to see if maybe the one I had was a bit ""off""."
"Bottle from city wide in south bend. Tawny light brown, with thin whiff of a head and nice long lacy legs. Bready, slightly malty nose, with caramelized sugar, hint of ethanol. Taste is a quickly spiced malt, somewhat sweet, and with a little fruitiness. Thick and chewy, but not super aggressive... The large ABV is well hidden and it's a smooth drinker for what it is. Not as good as their holiday beer, imo, but still a fine beverage."
"Drinkability- Very scary on the drinkability with the gravity being 12%. It is obvious that the alcohol is high, but not that high. I could down a pint glass before realizing what I was getting into. But still a very nice beer to go with the great weather we are having lately."
"Overall Bush Ambrée (Scaldis in my Bottle) is a very strong ale. It is oversweet and cloying. Definitely not my stuff."
"D-Very impressive for a quadrupel as far as drinkability. Very balanced with a nice dark fruit and spice."
"A very odd quad."
"Creamy mouthfeel, with an alcohol and slight fruit taste. Slightly peppery. Not too overbearing. Very easy drinking. Finishes rather dry. Not as biscuity as some quads I've had, although no slouch in it's own right. 8.35 oz is a nice nightcap size."
"Well worth buying."
"D - There's a lot here, but my impression is that the booziness is a little strong for the other flavours. Definitely a sipper, and not more than one at a time."
"The high alcohol reduced the drinkability of this beer."
"Light, hazy maple-syrup color with thin white head. Nose of sugar and yeast. Tasted a bit like crushed aspirin, and the alcohol stuck out like a sore thumb. Mouth feel was thin and prickly. Finish was sorta harsh with the raspy alcohol notes and sugar."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this would be a good choice if youre in the mood for a strong Belgian beer, but its one you need to drink slowly."
"I have to say, it's the best 12% APV I've ever had. The alcohol is very well hidden. When I was at Gingerman, I remember not believing that it was 12%, but, the effect didn't lie! Can't have too many of these before you're in blackoutville. I probably drank the bottle in front of me way too fast.. about 5 minutes, but to me, it was still worth every sip. Simply delicious, well balanced, and alcohol well hidden. Yum! I should have bought more than 3!"
"A great quad, worth the price but will break your wallet in half. especially for 9 ounces! must pour very, very carefully to avoid dumping the lees, which is quite loose. unless of course you like the extra nutty flavor. Pours a clear brown, with chunks of yeast rather than a cloudiness. incredibly good mouthfeel and smooth drinkability. the taste of scaldis is unique to the brewery, like het anker, or d'achouffe is. very flavorful with almost a thick uh...dark peach?? or maybe papaya flavor. sugary and has the compulsory alcohol finish but still very smooth. great beer, enjoy slowly with dark meats or bread and butter. syruply delicious residue on the lips. get it!"
"I was pretty impressed with this beer. My wife (a wine drinker) was also impressed. I thought the taste was complex and interesting and the alcohol was reasonably well hidden, anyway it certainly wasnt prominent. There was a good amount of carbonation to balance the mouthfeel and the taste left me wanting more. In fact I have gone back to the bar that has it on tap just to get another one."
"Drinkability- Fantastic! This is 12%??? I could have had at least one more of these if I had any. Glad I have access to them. Tremendous brew here. Love it!"
"250 ml bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a cloudy orange/amber color with a small off-white head. Not much head retention or lacing. The aroma is mostly sweet, it smells like plum, sweet malt, candy sugar, and some alcohol. Taste is similar to the aroma, however I can taste some pepper, and also the alcohol shows up more in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's thick and coating. Drinkability is OK, but this is definitely a sipping beer. The alcohol is pretty noticable and catches up to you after a while. I don't know if I'd want to drink more than one of these at a time. Overall I think it's a decent brew. Not great, but not bad either."
"A good beer if you want to drink an exotic import and get drunk fast. Otherwise I would keep this as a one glass desert after a nice meal of some sort."
"Review added 11-21-2007, translated from french 1-30-2008."
"Pours a clear amber body with a small beige head. Some delicate curtains of lace decorate the goblet. Aroma is very fruity with melon and ripe banana. Medium body with subdued carbonation. Taste is sweet with fruity melon. Some noble hops bitterness and alcohol warmth. Too sweet to be very drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some hints of alcohol. Taste is also very sweet and rich with some notes of alcohol easily discernable. Full body with some average carbonation. Alcohol was way too apparent for a Belgian ale and the beer is too sweet to be truly interesting."
"I'm excited to try it fresher and compare."
"Received as a gift and glad I did not purchase myself. Pours a somewhat murky orange with virtually no head. Smell is sour, tangy, and some grain and bread smell. Taste is virtually all alcohol. I really cannot distinguish and standout taste other than than. Some hints of fruit, malt, bitterness, but not much. Definite warming affect as it goes down. Low carbonation lead into a thick mouthfeel. Overall I just was not impressed."
"D: It is an experience. A single bottle is sufficient. However, I strongly recommend this brew as a unique interpretation of the quadrupel style from Belgium...It's nothing like other quads...from Belgium or America."
"I don't see myself purchasing this brew very frequently, but I am glad I experienced it. It was too expensive for the serving size, especially since I can get better quads for less and more volume, ie St Bernardus Abt 12, and 3 Philosophers. I would much rather buy a Rochefort 10."
"I have had this on tap in Brussels and i enjoyed it then too, this is a good beer, but don't forget the strenght, it is a nightcap drink, not a session one."
"Good, but not my favorite quadrupel."
"On draft as ""Scaldis"" at Sunset Grill in Allston, MA. Pours a medium copper with no head or carbonation. Delicate aroma. Rather sweet, but not overpoweringly so. The sweetness feels like it hits the roof of the mouth more than on the tongue. (Not sure if that's physically possible...) The aftertaste doesn't develop any differently from the upfront sweetness. This one didn't really do it for me."
"D: A interesting Belgian, the drinkability was quite good for a beer of this size and intensity, I needed a bit more from the flavour aspect to make this a truly oustanding beer, but I liked it very much, a good showing from the strongest ale in Belgium."
"Overall - On OK beer... seems to me that it's just a strong beer for the sake of being strong... probably not something i would go back to..."
"8.48 ounces and 12 percent. Big things in small packages, I guess. The color is a golden brown with little or no head. The smell is fruity with a sharp edge. Notes of pear and spice. The taste is carmel and honey. Sweet up front but the finish dries out enough to keep the whole thing in check. There's a bit of toffee in there, no hint of the pear & citrus fruits that played hide and seek in the aroma. The mouthfeel is good, with decent carbonation despite the lack of head. (and who doesn't hate THAT?) Very silky, bordering on syrupy. The drinkability is good. The alcohol is very pronounced, warming you all the way down. I could have another but probably shouldn't. Well, we'll see how the evening shapes up, shall we?"
"Drinkability: flavorful and enjoyable, but one bottle is all you need. Can't see drinking more than one here."
"Overall, a very average beer. I probably won't seek this out again."
"Interesting, complex flavor that is pleasant to drink. Too sweet and heavy to drink in large quantities, but that is not the point. Definitely worth a try but not something I will return to often."
"taste is very sweet, malty, reasonably clean. a funky flavor in the aftertaste. I can't say that I like it very much. The aftertaste is strange and unpleasent. to me it's a citrusy funk. maybe just the alcohol without adequate flavors to complement it."
"Mouthfeel ws very zesty, prickly. Sweet oily refrain. I am glad I tried this one but I doubt I'll revisit."
"D= not all that drinkable in quantity due to the 12%ABV, but as a single or maybe two it's rather nice, an absolute must for the beer conniseur."
"This stuff is definately on the sweet side, but its not one-dimensionally sweet. The alcohol presence is very subdued in both smell and taste. Very drinkable."
"D- Not an everyday drink, but a decent dessert beer."
"D- I love a glass, but probably couldn't have a bottle."
"This beer pours an impressive orange brown color, with excellent head retention and very good lacing. Lots of sweet smelling Belgium spice on the nose; very inticing and inviting. On the palate this beer is very rich. I get flavors of honey, butter, cherries and Belgium candy, with an impressive (though not too heavy) mouthfilling texture. This beer is quite sweet, but is not cloying. The alcohol is a bit noticable on the finish, and this beer is not what I would call especially drinkable. It's definitely a sipper, but is a beer I'm always happy to see (and order) whenever I see it on tap. Very nice indeed..."
"D - Very boozy and not that enjoyabvle overall. It is too strong to be drinkable. I will pass in the future."
"I enjoyed my bottle, but it's not something I'll regularly purchase."
"This is a full bodied, almost syrupy beer. Not much head, little lacing, the smell is alcohol, malt, and pineapple liquour. Not overly carbonated. This is clearly a sipping beer and at 12 ABV, you don't drink this to excess in any case. The taste is sweet, syrupy, malt in the middle, some hoppy/alcohol bite near the end, definite alcohol in the after taste. This is a beer that will warm you. The high alcohol content is masked over quite well with the other flavors, but it is the sweetness and the liquour quality that is most pronounced. This is stronger than a Trippel, almost the consistency of a barley wine. An interesting beer worth seeking out. L'Chaim"
"Purchased at Binny's in River Grove, IL. $3.99/8.48 fl. oz bottle"
"As far as an archetype of the style, I would give lower marks, but I enjoy the sweet smooth taste, syrupy mouthfeel and the well balanced not too sugary flavor for the 12% abv. Its more of a tripel than a quad though, but a highly enjoyable beer if you arent comparing it against the westy, abt 12, etc and reviewing it against the BJCP standards (even tho scaldis is a noted acceptable exception to the Abbey style quad)."
"Not a very complex beer, either young or with age, I find. Still, not a bad late-night offering."
"Overall, a very powerful quad. Lots of fun strong flavors, but it left me without nosehairs."
"Pours a cloudy orangish color with little in the way of head, but what is there is fairly creamy. Smells slightly citrusy and a tiny bit yeasty, but can't really smell much else. Tastes very sweet and a bit citrusy with some caramel notes and some slight alcohol burn. Not much, but some hoppy bitterness at the back end. Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy, almost like brandy. Overall, it's pleasant and immensely drinkable. I only wish I could afford to drink it all the time."
"Footnote: The Dubuisson brewery was actually one of the first marketers of Stella Artois in 1926."
"D - Despite the very high abv, the drinkability is very good. I would definetly have this beer again."
"Impressive, and I will have a lot more of this one (although not sure if it always needs to be aged). I do not necessarily agree this is close to a barley wine, this one has too much belgian character, and is not heavy on the hops."
"for this greenleaf"
"A Quadrupel nearly dead-on in aroma and flavor for the style. Somewhat of a classic that deserves more respect than what it gets IMO. Certainly a Belgain to be savored over and over again."
"This is ia light colored beer; almost pilsner looking. Head was very minimal. The first few sips have a bite due to alcohol content but became very drinkable after that. This is an 8 ounce bottle and there was a little sediment in it which took away from mouthfeel score but overall it was a decent beer."
"Scaldis Belgian Ale... Bush Ambree... take your pick, is an okay little warmer upper from Brasserie Dubuisson Freres. It isn't nearly as good as Bush De Noel, a powerhouse of a BSDA that is well worth the coin. Unless you're a quad fan, I'd give this one a pass."
"Thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy direct from Belgium."
"I wouldn't seek this out again. As much as I wanted to enjoy it, I just couldn't find enough redeeming qualities in the taste that made me want to grab another. I'll finish this one and mark it off my list."
"I'm actually glad that this is only a 250mL bottle. Really not a very good belgian at all, and a pretty awful quad. At $3.69 for a tiny bottle, I won't be buying it again... hell, I wouldn't pay that much for a pint of it. Quite disappointing. Perhaps some age would let the alcohol fade a bit, but there isn't a whole lot left in this one to shine through. Not recommended.... save your money for something better."
"While quads in general are always interesting, this one didn't blow me away. Don't take me wrong. I would drink this again, but it would depend on my other options. I guess I want more peaks & valleys in the Belgian ales I drink, and this one was more Kansas than Colorado. If you get a chance, certainly try it, but don't be expecting any breathtaking views from the slightly over-sugary plateau this brew provides."
"this beer is very good but i must say i like the noel a little more."
"Danger, Will Robinson! It pours a pale orangey-brown with a moderate off-white head that thins to lace. It smells a bit spicy and it's alocohol doesn't hide. The flavor is a rather tropical fruity in nature, a bit malty and warm. It's thick and has decent carbonation. It's overpowering, and it'll knock me out quite quickly. Not for the faint of heart!"
"250 mL nip bottle, best before 03/08, served in a tulip. It pours a yeast-laden reddish-amber with medium carbonation and a finger of khaki head that leaves light lacing. It smells vinous (almost oxidized) with grains, toasted malts, and maybe some spices. There is also a touch of alcohol and a definite ""off"" quality. It tastes sugary sweet, with vinous and toasted malts, molasses, nuts?, grains, fruits, and maybe some phenols on top of a medium body that feels strong and leaves a light to medium finish. Overall not a great beer, but not awful."
"I found the syrupy, fruit characterstics to be somewhat overpowering. The beer does eventually grow on you as it warms."
"Not recommended except to hardcore (and undiscriminating) barleywine fans."
"Poured out a copper to orange color with a deep white head. Good head retention & minimal lacing The nose was rich, boozy & oaky, with some port-like notes. The taste featured alcohol, oak & apricot. Finished like a sherry or port, really dry, fruitty and burning. Had a rich, subtle carbonation."
"This beer is actually hard to describe but it is a good solid Quad one of the best I have had actually. A wonderful sipping beer."
"It has a medium-thick mouthfeel, and the alcohol does coat the palate. I highly recommend this for Belgian beer lovers."
"Overall: I picked this as one of two favorites to buy after sampling about 30 other beers at a beer festival. This is an expensive beer ($3.99 for an 8.5 oz. bottle) that is good in all respects, but unfortunately suffers from the relatively unmasked 12% ABV. Recommended."
"A tart malt flavor is what I tasted first. The alcohol becomes more present right at the finish. I'm not yet the Belgian connoiseur, but the hops balance well with the strong sweet malt and alcohol. I've had Quads with much different flavor profiles. This would be an excellent after dinner drink as the alcohol warms and does not burn. As it warms, it becomes eerily similar to a Wee Heavy."
"Poured into a half pint goblet at Zeno's in State College. The beer had a one finger lgiht tan/yellow head, over a hazy golden copper body. Seemed a bit light for a quad, but it looked nice. The nose had a bit of lemon, grass, and, oddly, a bit of powdered sugar. Light, but nice. The taste was hard to describe: bittersweet, with lots of alcohol. Not much character. The mouth was medium-light, with a bit higher carbonation - or perhaps alcohol burn? Overall, this beer suffered from being too strong."
"Overall Impression: Belgian Malt Liquor. Within 3 tastes I could feel my skull. Its a monster, but a sly devil. All smiles and soft words until you feel the knife in your back. I think this is what beer snobs drink out of brown paper bags when they just want to get messed up. Id suggest a cheese plate and a small glass, maybe split between two, but given the right backdrop, a very nice beer."
"Poured to a light copper, with tiny carbonation bubbles throughout glass. Had a medium off-white head that lingered thru much of the drink and then reduced to decent lacing on the sides of the glass. A nice mild aroma of sour fruit, mostly apples and grapes. Taste was more of the same with some malty sweetness as well. Some alcohol crept in at mid-glass, but surprisingly not too strongly, considering this is a 12% abv. Palate was a bit dry, but all and all, a good, tasty, enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazy burnt amber color with a good deal of sediment flakes swimming throughout the beer. Nose is sweet tropical fruit, peppery spice, and noticeable alcohol. Taste begins with a candied sugar sweetness along with very ripe and juicy fruit (pineapple, mango, peach, papaya). A rather pronounced spiciness is also present with notes of coriander and white pepper with a fainter taste of white cake in the background. Citrusy warming alcohol is also apparent. Theres a lot going on in this beer. The bottle may be rather small, but at 12% ABV, its more than enough for a nightcap."
"I don't think quadrupel is a particularly appropriate classification for this brew. More like the Belgian interpretation of a British barley-wine."
"Beer poured an amber color with not much head that is hanging on. The unfiltered yeast makes this interesting to look at. My nose says you do not want to light a match around this one. Alcohol dominates initially fading into a fruity sweet smell. Taste is pretty good. The initial sips indicate this is nothing but an after dinner liqueur. Ultimately the subtle elements come out nicely including a hoppy dark fruit finish which I did not expect. Mouthfeel is very full and smooth on the palate. Overall drinkability is OK. It is probably a good thing that this good beer comes in a smaller dose!"

"Taste was malty and alcoholic, which was a bit overwhelming at first. Then after some sips, some fruits (strawberries) come out. Also a good bitterness to balance the alcohol of this big beer. Still the alcohol remains pretty in my face and is a bit too much for me. Together with the one-dimensional bitterness, this beer is average in taste and mouthfeel, which inhibits drinkability."
"Good drinkability. It's complex, sweet, and alcoholic, yet balanced enough to not be overbearing in any single respect. Very solid indeed. Salud."
"drinkablity: a great start with the smell and appearance, but let down some by the taste...too much of a booze bomb. I like my alcohol buried a bit more, but certainly glad I tried it. Some how the 8.5 oz seemed like the right amount....go figure."
"The prevailing tastes include the malt sweetness and alcohol. No bitterness."
"Overall, definitely not a bad brew, and while I would have it again, I probably won't buy it again only because there are better quadrupels for the same price that are superior. However, this is a fine brew and everyone should at least taste it."
"Scaldis is an interesting reddish-brown (brick perhaps) in color with little head. Smelled slightly tart and of vinager and olives. Taste was initially nicely malted with a strong, toasty alcohol finish, very close to dessert liquor indeed. The malt started to wash out later on with more of an emphasis on the cool alcohol flavors. There was a bit of slight bite with the carbonation hitting the tongue. A nice quad all in all, though not the best of the Belgians"
"Thanks to Ding for allowing me to try it."
"Overall, a nice addition to the Quadrupel style but nothing Earth-shattering. I like this beer, but given its price here in Texas I probably won't try this again for a while. If you're looking for a good Belgian you haven't tried before I recommend this one though."
"A nice nightcap, and little different from your typical quad. An interesting beer."
"Drinks pretty well considering the heft. But more than bottles of this & its time for a nap! This is an ale that holds up well to crossing the pond. One to sip in front of a fire with winter chill in the air, still held up well in July"
"This brew yields a medium body while exhibiting low to moderate carbonation. Taste is slighty medicinal from the high alcohol content with caramel, ripened fruit and sweet malts trying to lend balance. They fail. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky and simultaneously astringent. Becomes almost undrinkable as it warms as a bready, brandy like characteristic develops. I had to put it back in the fridge to finish off the 8.48 oz bottle. The alcohol is just a little to in the forefront for me on this one. Not too bad, but not all that complex either. To me it is just imbalanced. It's a good thing these come in small bottles as I don't think I could stomach much more..."
"Very good beer. Just watch your head!"
"This is not a beer in which I would say the alcohol was well hidden. It seemed as though the flavors underneath were well developed, but it would likely require some major cellaring before I could fully appreciate what this beer has to offer."
"Hot alcohol rides over a nutty malt backbone with some bourbon notes, but not a lot more. No balance whatsoever, and not worth seeking out again."
"I'm rating it 4.0 on drinkability not because I want another tonight...no way that can happen...rather because I definately want another and will buy this again. Normally I do not like quads....too intense. This beer is actually very complex and balanced."
"I believe that I could drink this all night long, though it would be a short night with a 12% abv."
"Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, but the carbonation is perfect and offsets it nicely. For drinkability, I scrawled something that looks like ""gouof beirk!"" but I think ""good beer!"" is what I was shooting for. Alcohol is a little high to be drank in quantity, obviously - best shared with a friend, this one - and not one who's going to be driving! Good one to finish out your night on. Of course, you'll pretty much have to, anyway."
"Lots of alcohol in the aroma smells vaguely like bourbon soaked caramel. Light bown to amber in color with a diminishing wispy white head. Flavor is stiff alcohol, toasted caramel, rum raisin, raisins, prunes and fruitcake. Finish is alcohol bitter rather than hop bitter."
"A decent Quad. Wouldn't mind trying some more of Dubuisson's brews...namely the less alcoholic ones."
"Pours a very hazy golden orange color with a thin off-white head that doesnt retain well...not really to style but nice regardless. The aroma is even stranger than the appearance, with notes of cider and vineagar, along with some fruits (pear, apple), candy sugar, and alcohol. The flavor also has some cidery/vineagar notes, as well as fruit (peaches, apples, pears), toasted bread, candy sugar, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is limited. An interesting beer, definately shouldn't be classified as a quad...not my bag of tea but not terrible."
"Overall, an interesting beer. It has good qualities and is pretty drinkable, but not a great example. I see myself passing this one up for others."
"D: Tasty but too much alcohol not balanced well enough. Novelty drink."
"Drinkability: Tasty, but the alcohol is very noticable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the effervescent coppery brew. Head lasts well, with heavy coating frothy lace. Nose is spicy with malt sweetness underneath. Taste is sweet malts upfront, spices coming in next, and a warming alcohol close. Mouthfeel is excellent, so smooth, and drinkability is nice as well, although the alcohol limits a bit. Very nice, just not enough in the bottle, once decanted. Ah well, have to buy more sometime, I guess."
"I actually quite liked this, although after drinking it I'm not sure I'm up for the barleywine I had planned next for the evening. We'll try a few glasses of water first and see how it goes."
"Conclusion: this beer tastes bad. It might be better after some ageing but I'm not motivated enough by the first taste to even try."
"D - Sometimes big things come in small packages. At 12% ABV this baby packs a punch. As this one warmed up, became less carbonated, and the alcohol started to kick in, I grew fonder of it. I wouldn't follow this one up with another, but definitely recommendable to those who enjoy barley wine."
"Too much carbonation for my taste, instead of interesting, it really feels cutting. Still a great beer, and as it warms many of the problems are reduced."
"Mouthfeel- Very warming, thats for sure with a little sweetness. This is definetky a sipping beer."
"Drinkability - this might be a candidate for three to five years of aging. At only $4 per 250 ml bottle, it wouldn''t be overly costly to lay 3 of these down, maybe take the edge off that hootch For now, it's got some nice flavor but the booziness is overkill."
"a very phenolic brew, with alcohol spice and real spice flavors. too hot, in my opinion. very malty"
"On tap at Zenos in State College. Hazy, vibrant, medium-light amber with a small, tight milky, white film of head. Excellent lacing. The smell is sweet and strong. Wow, strong of alcohol like a liquor. The taste is more of the same: sweet, lightly hoppy, fruity and some wicked alcohol burn that grows on the finish. It has a medium body, lightly syrupy texture and soft carbonation. This beer does NOT hide the higher alcohol at all. But I really dont mind that. This is a very enjoyable nighttime sipper."
"Creamy attractive head with lots of lace on the way down. Creamy smooth, though a bit of tingling from carbonation. Very satisfying yeastiness and ice cream aftertaste. Excellent palate cleaner after greasy hamburgers. Medium to full mouthfeel. Alcohol only felt much later on."
"There are better and more readily available beers of this style. The price of this liliputian sized bottle could afford me a nice bottle of St. Bernardus or perhaps a nice American rendition."
"Overall, well balanced and very drinkable. Even 4 oz gets to the head pretty quickly, so be careful."
"Ah, bush amber is a nice beer that you can get almost anywhere in Belgium for like $1 or 2 in the bottle or sometimes, like today, on draft. I's a dark golden amber beer with a nice very big head of white foam that really sticks around and makes itself known. The aromas are all strong alcohol, sweet sugar, malts, and several kinds of spices. The taste is sweet, spicy, and starts to get cloying after a while. Mouthfeel is slick and a bit too hot, and this hurts the drinkability. Still a Belgian neo-classic."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is fine, with its foamy microscopic bubbliness. But once the flavor and swallow occurs, it's painful. My burps even hurt. What a huge letdown... I was really looking forward to this tasting. I think they're lying... this beer must be something like 24%. My stomach lining hurts."
"this beer is a style unto itself, unlike any other quadrupel I know. presents a lot of barley wine qualities with a belgian beer mouthfeel. very interesting and enjoyable."
"For the punch it packs this beer can be found in Nebraska fairly cheap. It has been available for over a year but I havent tried until very recently. I am happy I did. I know the Crescent Moon carries it in bottles; Ill have to drink some! In the end, all jokes aside, this is a nice sipping beer. Why this is listed as a Quad on BA I have no idea. IMO, this is a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I will buy more; I was a fool to wait so long to drink this. I purchased my bottle in Lincoln, NE but I can get it in Omaha too. Recommended."
"Scaldis is a golden ale and pours golden orange. The head subsided 3 minutes after pouring, leaving some clinging lace. Aroma is of caramel and is a bit alcoholic, but not as bad as some of my young belgian-style ales of lesser gravity. I suspect the caramel flavors are due to large additions of sugar in the boil kettle. This gets the abv up, but also creates a dryer mouthfeel, then say a barleywine. The aroma reminds me of a Samuel Smith ale. This beer lacklacks the fruit aromas of westmalle and some of the trappist ales and the complexity of the strong goldens. Taste is a mix of sweet and rich malts and dry/alcohol."
"Worth a try, but, not my favorite beer in the style."
"Opinion: Wow, now this wasn't what I was expecting! I am not really sure what I WAS expecting, but this surprised me. I don't think that I have ever had a beer this bold, yet this palatable. You can tell from the fumes in the aroma that this beer is no chump, but it goes down so smooth that it is almost scary. This beer was just released here in Houston, so I believe that this is a pretty fresh example. Good form!"
"Overall, this is an interesting taste experience, and I could imagine this being really great with certain foods, but taken on its own it has limited appeal for me."
"D - Nice. After dinner sipper. Warmed me up nicely."
"Happy Beering and to a new year!"
"N.B. This is one of those rare beers that I actually enjoyed much more while it was colder. When it warmed up the alcohol came out a bit more, but no more flavors did. Ah well."
"Body and taste - The whole things improves each sip and finishes perfectly."
"This was a very drinkable Belgian style ale. Intensely smooth with similarities to nice cognac. Delicious."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber color, with one finger of tan head. Not too exciting of a color, its the ""yes.. it's beer"" shade of amber. Smells sweet, with floral notes, as well as malt. Very nice smell! It tastes sweet and malty, not as much as you'd think from the smell, a bit tart as well, from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, lots of body, a good amount of carbonation, and it has a good aftertaste as well. This is a very interesting beer, very different from anything I've had before. This is definetly a beer I would drink with a meal or some cheese, not something I'd have several of at once. Not to say it isn't enjoyable like that, but the complexity of it doesn't make me want to overload my taste buds."
"Mouthfeel is medium but the alcohol makes it a sipper. Smells nice but I would prefer a little more complexity and a little less heat. A curiosity, not a fridge staple."
"Not bad, but this wasn't really fair making it follow the Rochefort 10."
"Thick bodied with a light carbonation, goes down easily. I would buy this again as a special treat. I was very very surpised by this tiny bottle."
"Overall, I'd say it's a damn fine beer. It is kind of hard to place into a category, but there are few belgians that actually do in the grand scheme of things. Worth seeking out."
"Being summer, I could have picked a less warming beer, but I'm inside with the AC. A very nice brew that is sweet but not cloying and may appeal to those that like lighter wine styles."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Clear medium amber with a creamy, long-lasting, off-white head. Smells very sweet, light alcohol, faint hops and a bit of spice. Flavour is a combination of candy sugar, moderate yet harsh hop bitterness, and a bit of spice, with a very strong alcohol warmth. Medium/full body, high carbonation, creamy and light texture. Overall, a bit overly strong with some harshness."
"It this beer was more affordable I'd quite like it regularly. Poured a cloudy dark orange with a thin head that held and laced well. Smelled of caramel and/or candied apples, strong enough to hit you right before each tip. You can definately taste the alcohol here and it's managed very well with a malty-creamy taste that's constant. The finish and the aftertaste leave more of the same but in no offensive manner. I have to say I felt like part of the beer was like a barley wine but not quite as sweet. The carbonation is heavy but works very well. I'm not sure it's drinkable but it's certainly drinkenjoyable."
"Doesn't pour oout to much in my Ikea chalice, way less than a regular size beer. Head is ok at first, then fades to maybe 1/8"". Body is very hazy and murky, brown and opaque. Smells of raisin and alcohol, woody and earthy, slightly sweet. Taste has a lot of alcohol and dark fruitiness in it, with a good amount of hops, and I will agree with past reviewers in saying this is very similar to a Belgian barley wine. Unique and quite beefy but not a full enough malt profile to it. I like this one, but not as much as the other quads i have tried."
"Sunset-like in color, with a thin, off-white head. The nose is fairly thin, with hints of alcohol but little else. Flavor is better, though very ""hot."" Alcohol is really quite overwhelming, actually, and contributes only a bit of peppery spice to the flavor. As the beer sits it develops some light berry flavors and some toffee notes to the malt. Overall, this is pretty harsh."
"Strong maltiness. Alcohol burn. Fruity. Unbalanced and not that tasty. Strong but that's about it. No complexity at all. Some sweet alcohol lingering on the tongue. Not so hot."
"Pours very active (bubbly) into the glass. A rich caramel color with minimal head that immediatley dissapeared. Sweet malty bouquot. Smooth medium bodied mouth feel. Nice hop bite upfront finishing with a mellow yet somewhat sour malty aftertaste. Nice effervescent burn all the way down to the stomach. Minimal lacing that melts away rather quickly. Good Belgian. Definitley one to enjoy in moderation as it is 12%."
"Pours a dark red color with little head. Smell is pungent like dark fruit or molasses with a touch of alcohol in the tail end. Taste is good when taken in a full sip, but when you try to hold it in your mouth and get the layers it mostly tastes like alcohol. Together it is like grapes and apples, very pleasant. Be careful, a little too delicious to have 12%!"
"Poured a huge light tan head atop an amber ber with a fierce carbonation that kept the head on top amazingly lopng for how high the alcohol level is. This is one very beautiful beer and before I even smell it i just want to stare at the brilliance and the streams of tiny bubbles. The aroma is pretty well blocked by the thick frothy head but I can still percieve a lot of fruity esters and a touch of sweet malt. The flavor is different than i expected from a quad as i thought it would be just like a really strong tripel but the malt flavors are more sweet than dry and the alcoholic heat is hidden a lot less well than in tripels. The flavor begins with a sweet malt and a lot of fruityness from the esters and a touch of an ironlike taste that i am very sensitive to and it is not very nice. Still the flavor overall is enjoyable and for how high in alcohol this beer is the finish is very clean and the flavors mesh very well with nothing sticking out except the alcoholic heat on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation has very little carbonic bite making this ale have a nice smoothness. The drinkablity is less than other beers as the very high alcohol makes this one a bit too strong to be a session beer but it is very tasty."
"Notes: I found this one in a small conveinience store way off the beaten path. Last place I would expect to find a quad, but a pleasant surprise to say the least. I'm going back for a couple more to cellar and see what she does over a year or two."
"It was a deep golden color with some foam, when poured into a tulip glass. The smell was of a sweet nature, like a sweet fruity aroma. The taste was not what I expected for a ale that's 12% alcohol. The taste was a mild sweet/tart flavor of honey and fruit and spices. A really big flavor and pleasant enough to sip and enjoy. I personally would will purchase this Belgium Ale again."
"Pours a clear copper under a one finger off-white head that lasts and lasts, but only leaves a few spots of lace. The nose is candy sweet, with liquer tones. The mouth is very heavily carbonated and rather sticky. As the beer warmed, the stickiness became more pronounced. The taste is light and sweet, not overpowering with alcohol, but its presence is definitely felt. Slightly bitter underpinnings, seemingly more from the booze than from any hops. The aftertaste is mainy fruity, rather like a strong wine. The impression is OK, but there are better ways to secure alcohol content."
"25 cl bottle, under its alias ""Scaldis", bought at Selfridges, London. Amber colour, large and fluffy lingering head. Vinous dry sherry-like aroma, elements of oak and leather too. Flavour is again sherry-like, medium dry (or medium sweet, if you like), loads and loads of oak, hints of German ""Weinbrand", warming mouthfeel as expected from a 12% ABV beer, but the beer doesnt feel inappropriately alcoholic. A substantial hoppy bitterness in the finish balances the sweetness nicely. Plays in the Premier League of beers, this one."
"Like Thomas Hardy's Ale or JW Lees it's just perfect with a bit of cheese and nosh with a late night book."
"Draft - 10 oz. flute goblet. Burnt gold appearance with little head. Probably due to the high 12% abv. Nice amount of carbonation. Upfront taste of fruit and honey with a biting alcohol finish which helps balance the sweetness. Definitely a beer to be sipped and savored over period of time."
" Exceptional and very complex beer to savour and linger over on a cold evening or after a lavish meal."
"Definitly one to sip. The alcohol is king in this one...maybe it's time for a revolution!"
"Not completely enjoying this beer, sad to say a single 250mL bottle is all I really want. If this beer could taste as good as it looks, we'd be in business, but no dice. For once, the quater litre size is a blessing."
"Notes: Very warming. I'm glad this brew comes in a small bottle. There is a slight burning and tingling. Soon after a few sips you can feel the alcohol surging through the bloodstream. Definitely not what I was expecting, is this really a quadruple? Nothing that special, will definitely want to try it again, if its been cellared for a long time."
"The head I fouind boring, lacking of a character of its own. Only when it fades into a thin collar does it get any interesting to look at. The body is active and has an orange amber color. The smell is quite enjoyable, very fruity, and especially peachy with notes of apple too. Also a bit yeasty, with notes of cake. The taste shows strong alcohol notes, but overall interestingly mixed with fruity notes of peach and pear and malty notes of syrupy caramel. The finish in particular is nicely caramelized. The mouthfeel is sweet, a but gluey, and not as dry as one could fear given the abv. Almost round. Interesting. A real potent brew."
"Aftertaste hold some nuttiness that I wish was in the body or taste. Low hops, low dryness."
"Appearance is brownish orange in the glass with some light coming through and a decent sized light tan head. The head stuck around a bit and left rings of lace as I drank this. Aroma is fruity and sweet with notes of apples and dark fruits with a bit of caramel and spice intertwined. Its a strong aroma that is good but a bit simple. Light fruit taste like caramel covered fruit. After taste is a bit fruity with a bit of alcohol bite to it, more than you would want. Mouthfeel is lighter than usual for a quad but is smooth feeling. Pretty good drinkability despite a few flaws. The alcohol really stands out in this one and the flavor seems a bit too sweet at times. As it warms though the alcohol starts to kill the drinkability."
"Light golden straw color with large foamy head. Aromas of sweet floral honey and metal. Sweet, floral at first, broken up midway by intense carbonation, drying hops, and aggressive alcohol. It ends up dry but leaves you with a sweet maltiness and brief hints of cherry Robitussin. Pretty good ride overall, definitely interesting... damn the tiny bottle which taunts me. The carbonation is almost distracting, it's so sharp in the mouth. You expect a nice thick and rich feel in your mouth and then BOOM, Bubbles, big ones."
"Settles into the glass with a non-descript white head over clear deep amber liquid goodness. Deep malt nose mixed with spicy yeast esters and potent alcohol fumes. First sip reveals a chewy, nutty maltiness first, then a tremendous drying hoppiness dominates the palate...but wait, now the touted 12 percent alcohol shows up to let us know who's boss here. The finish is wonderful, long and dry hop bitterness complexities mingle among the alcohol wallop and brief fruitiness for an intrigueing experience...a delicious classic strong (read:STRONG) Belgian masterpiece."
"pours a brilliant orange amber color with a big foamy head and trails of lace. The aroma is spicy, plumy and full of passionfruit, and other fruits I cant identify, theres also a big wiff of alcohol. The tast is very heavy on the alcohol. Its also very figgy, spicey and fruity. Theres also a surprising amount of hoppiness to this beer. Unfortunately it tends to get overwhelmed by the alcohol zing. The mouthfeel is tingly from the alcohol. Quite a good beer nonetheless. The strongest beer I tried yet so I guess some alcohol notes are expected."
"Overall a very nice nightcap- one is plenty, and afterwards it's bed time!"
"Poured a rich honey amber, no haze, with a slightly off-white head that quickly sank until I gave the glass a swirl - head galore, and the lacing sticks around this time. Smell is honey, caramel, alcohol, roses, and hint of bubblegum and fruit. That bubblegum can only mean one thing to me - fusels. Next stop, Headache City. The taste is very smooth. Apples and pears flowing into honey and light caramel malts, then to a dry alcoholic finish. Not as complex as what I would have thought originally, actually. Hopefully further warming will help that out a bit. Okay, guess not. At least it's consistent, right? Mouthfeel is not quite as thick and syrupy as the taste would have you believe, but the numbing alcohol wipes out any subtlety aside from the carbonation. Moderately drinkable, at least through the glass, but two or three of these in a night would slaughter my sense of taste, while four or more would slaughter my sense of good taste."
"Clear amber body, huge surprising off-white head, surprisingly very long-lasting and leaving nice lacing. Big potent alcohol vapours emane from the glass (and more and more as it warms). Flowers and dried fruits (apricots) alike. The palate is generally rather dry instead of the sweet and alcoholic typical big belgian I expected. It strikes me as zesty, bready, very alcoholic and hoppier than I thought with a big flowery and almost grassy hop profile that leads into a long bitter and spicy (cloves) finish. Nevertheless, this is too big for me and just so warming that its somehow hostile after half a bottle, very hot. Big full body providing mouth-coating heat, very high carbonation."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm malty scent with a sweet, dry finish. The taste is perfect. It is a really smooth tasting beer. It has a light, yet malty flavor with little hops and a creamy finish. It goes down easy with a warm aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It has a high abv., but it drinks well."
"Massive. I might be on my own here but I find Bush to be insanely drinkable and quite the dangerous session beer. I could have 4 or 5 of these easily, no problem at all. I also enjoyed its ""chewy"" mouthfeel. Very soft and smooth, with a small trace of its potency and a divine fruitiness, mainly cherries and plums but also a hint of juniper and a lovely caramel maltiness."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: Pours a clear golden orangle color with a thin white head. Decent lacing throughout. The aroma is very nice, a heady mixture of malt, honey and alcohol. Unfortunately the flavor doesn't come close to fulfilling the promise in the aroma. The body is carbonated with a rather Lager-ish character. Peppery alcohol and sweet caramel malt see-saw back and forth throughout. The finish is dry and lightly bitter. This beer was a bit of a letdown overall. Perhaps the (scalding?) alcohol content is to blame, but the beer seems unbalanced and is difficult to enjoy."
"Pours a hazy orange copper color, it is topped by a thin tan head. I get immediate strong aromas of malt and alcohol. These are joined by notes of orange, sherry, apricot, and a liquor like sweet aroma. The taste is only lightly sweet up front (drier than the nose would suggest). It finishes with a mix of fruity orange flavors and alcohol. This is much lighter in body than I was expecting. This beer is definitely malt dominated, the alcohol hotness is the next most dominant flavor. In fact the alcohol is a bit too much, there needs to be more beer here to tone down the hot alcohol notes. This is not bad by any means, but certainly is not great either."
"This review is of a bottle I bought in 96 and drank tonight. After 8 years it still has plenty of life with a nice light head with a rich buttered rum nose. It also has not lost any of its flavor exhibiting a caramel and sugar sweetness and an alcohol warmth that is great on a cold day - or a hot day in my case. The age has helped make this a joy to drink - too bad it is in such small bottles and much rarer than it was in '96."
"From a little 250 ml bottle, it has a big frothy white head that stays around to the end. The smell is strong alcohol, some ripe fruit, but most noticeably an underlying medicinal aroma. Although some of the fruit carries over to the taste, it's mostly alcohol. The alcohol taste is more in line with spirits than a beer. 12% is up there for a beer, but this one doesn't hide it well."
"Rich thick sticky white head. Very carbonated sparkel to the light ruby colored beer in the goblet. Carmel and malt sweetness are lifted by strong abv in the sinus. Very smooth mouth. Big astringent malt flavor upfront with a grassy dry finish. Very malty and hoppy. A huge beer. I like strong beers and this is a huge amber classic."
"I would say the high alcohol content would limit the drinkability, unless you are a Viking and want to find your inner Berserker. I really liked the alcohol flavor without the sweet taste that usually comes with a high ABV, and I'd fill my drinking horn with it."
"25cl bottle: Appears a murky reddish-brown in the glass. Slightly sour and alchohol in the nose. Strong alchohol taste. Somewhat sweet/sour taste, but the alchohol tends to be slightly overpowering. A good beer, but not nearly the best in this style."
"You can smell the alcohol in this beer. Orangy color and thin head that didn't give me any lacing (maybe my glass wasn't clean enough). Lots of floating stuff in this beer. Overall had great flavor, but I wouldn't be able to drink more than 2 in a sitting. Kind of an overpowering (but good) flavor. I would buy this beer again."
"pours a hazy deep orange/sunset with a small white head. wonderful lacing that leaves a crazy web like finish on the glass. big alcohol on the nose as well as some sweet malt and some tropical fruits and pepper. pineapple. thick in the mouth, sticky, and heavy. right off the bat a huge alcohol rush flies up the nostrils. whoa. fruity and medicinal. big thick malt backbone. spicey as all hell. this stuff is big time. this is a heavy brew, huge on alcohol...yet tasty and drinkable for what it is. the 12% abv is a real ass kicker. this has night cap written all over it."
"The smell and taste, overadministered by the malt which doesn't really permit the great side flavours, that you feel in the deep bottom (this is the fruity complexity), doesn't really make you wanna go past the first beer above another better creation. bof."
"Overall Impression: This beer tastes like having a rum and coke that is more rum than coke. The huge alcohol flavor is a bit overwhelming. Not very balanced, as such. A little more sweetness would be good in that regard. Bush de Noel is definitely better than this one."
"Some vanilla in the end."
"I Visited the Bush brewery in october. This newy revamped tasting room in french speaking belgium was a moment to be remembered for many years to come. This beer is a world classic.Extreme malty nose upfront. Sweet malty caramel flavor. Full bodied. Lasting head to the bottom."
"Appearance: Cloudy golden frothy white foaming head with a nice ticket of lacing evenly spread, nice. Aroma: Ginger honey tinted doughy like tones, with a rich syrupy mix of caramelized plums and other fruit tinged with an alcohol burn. Taste: Hops with rich malty flavors are flowing with brown sugar highlights reduced down to a syrup. Mouthfeel: Carbonation is smooth body is full and rich. Drinkability: Beware of the abv I didn't know before ordering, still very tasty Belgian delight."
"I agree when others say, ""Wow"". This is most likely the surprise beer of the year for me. Also my first at 12%abv. It pours a highly carbonated orange color. The head, while shortlived, is a light yellow peach. Lace is slight, but will ring on the glass. The aroma hits the nose with a wake-up-call, pow. Its a scent of sweet alcohol, grapefruit or pineapple. The taste and mouthfeel is smooth, carbonated and warming to the chest. The taste of tropical fruit, yeast or dough, backed yet ballanced by raw alcohol. An impressive strong dessert brew. One to take your time with & enjoy."
"Pours a deep orange with lighter head than expected,aroma was rich and nutty with some concentrated orange aromas as well.Flavors are sweet and orange liquore tasting pretty syrupy with some light nutty flavors that linger in the finish.The alcohol is very prevelant even more as it warms.I think this would be a nice nightcap,would make ya sleep well Iam sure."
"Drinkability  The alcohol notes will make or break your opinion of this ale. If its too much for you, you wont be able to enjoy it. If youre used to drinking hard liquor and the sting of 100 proof booze isnt offending, youll be able to appreciate this ale."
"Golden colored with a slight tinge of reddishness. Whitish head that dies rather quickly. Big alcohol smell almost like white grapes soaked in grain, miniscule woodiness also in the nose. Big alcohol punch mixed with a sweetness almost like Juicy Fruit gum finished with a dryness and a lingering alcohol effect that warms the esophagus. Almost like a barley cough syrup with a woody, estery finish. Mouthfeel is rather syrupy, yet the alcohol and esteriness work to counterbalance this. This was served in an authentic Scaldis/Bush tuliped glass that measured ~17 oz. full, so 13-14 oz. of one was enough for me. I've had this beer many times before, and I always go back for more, just not more than one at a time in the same night."
"The alcohol flavor in this is a bit more prevalent than I think works well on this background. The hints of fruitiness throughout are nice though, and the heavy hop flavor in the finish is an interesting surprise!"
"Comments: A very dynamic beer. The initial taste is very sweet and almost syrupy with a significant presence of alcohol and a warming sensation. It has an interesting complex combination of sweet, dry and tangy flavors, that evolve as the beer warms. Drinkability is low, because it is so intense."
"Comes in a small 8.2 oz bottle. The price is very expensive so this has to be great. Which it wasn't, but it wasn't bad either. Caramel sweetness is there with some slight floral hops. But alcohol is the most dominant taste. Tastes like whiskey. The head is solid which makes this kind of confusing for me. How strong would the alcohol taste if there was no head? Anyways, I drank about half then let it warm and the taste improved immensely. More of a barleywine, belgian mixture."
"It's a unique, tasty beer. And for the $2.75 I paid for it, it's a steal."
"with age."
"Deep orange hue with cream colored head. Sweet candy sugar aroma topped off with lots of alcohol and hints of raisins,prunes, and oak. Warm and alcoholic, some candy flavors (marshmellow?) and fruit with a wave of alcohol in the finish. I feel the body is too thin for the alcohol flavors here, overall medium bodied but needs more. The body fills out a little more as it hits room temp with a little toastiness with the alcohol in the finish. An average Belgian strong in my book, maybe a touch above average. Great as a replacement for a shot of hard alcohol."
"This ale poured a clear, peach-amber color with nice, long lasting white foam that left a trace of lace on the glass. There was a nice conisistent fizzing from the bottom of the glass. The smell was floral hops, malt, and yeast, as well as a bit of a vinous aroma. The taste was full bodied, sweet, malty, biscuity, with a little orange flavor, as well as a rather pronounced alcoholic taste. The flavor improved as the ale warmed to nearer room temperature. The mouthfeel was full, creamy, and clean, and very warming. The drinkability was good, and would be better if the alcoholic presence were less pronounced (at times I felt I was sipping a liqueur such as Cointreau)."
"As the beer sets in its appropriate Scaldis glass, it appears a crystalline amber color, the head impressive in size, frothy in its consistency, the color an off white, as it degrades, the lace formed is a fine covering sheet. A hint of fusel alcohol, with a majority malt nose, citrus crisp fresh and a pleasure to the senses. Start is malt, tart, the top middling in feel, the finish is passably carbonated, the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste and a nice Belly Warming sensation from the 12% ABV."
"12% ABV, judicious 8.5oz. bottle. Color is an odd, smoky, off-orange/dirty brown. Big, thick, creamy white head. Aromas of heady spices, sea-foam, soap, shrimp, slight fruit, but fairly dry overall. Massive malt buttresses an army of hops, huge but tasty assault on the tongue, fortified by alcoholic warmth. Heavy mouthfeel, full, lush texture, a dizzying sensation. Too much, too soon, and you'll be dumbstruck, friends, for the hops and the booze do a drumroll on your frontal lobes. Oh, it's a doozy!This is for slow sipping, and any guzzling will inch you quickly into inebriation. To continue to describe this beer's effect is to describe drunkenness. Fruitiness comes through in the middle --apricots, peaches. A hot, strong, yet tasty, ale that must be drunk to be understood."

"a nice full bodied belgian, that is a little sharp on the tongue. it is very rich and full of sweetness. the alcohol lets you know that it is there, maybe a little too much for me. i guess that is all that hurt this one. other than that it is a good beer."
"A lackluster high ABV Belgian brew. Still might be worth a try. If nothing else, use it a fuel for the lawnmower (or in WI's case right now, a snowblower)."
"Ha ! - Boy, if they ever did though !!!!!!"
"Beautiful copper gold color.  Rich head settles to a thin and persistent quarter-inch that leaves lace down the side of the glass.  Nose is malty and fruity, but the alcohol (12%) is apparent.  The palate is rich and fruity, but the alcohol dominates for my taste.  Long finish, but not a lot of complexity, and not balanced.  A glass by the fire on a cold night might be nice, but there are other beers I'd choose that taste better balanced to me."
"Cloudy amber hue w/ a thick, persistant, ivory - white lace leaving head. Honey glazed fruit, lightly caramelized sugar, light mustiness & trace phenol and heaty fusels. Fruity sweetness upfront fades into melange of honey, clove and mild vanilla. There's more caramel presence then that of a typical Belgian strong as well. Hop bitterness is meager, lending an assertive, but not cloying sweetness. Full bodied w/ a fairly viscous mouthfeel. Finishes w/ mellow biscuit sweetness and immedate soothing alcohol warmth. Scaldis is a rich, sweet, but very satisfying brew. Tremendously drinkable considering the alcohol content."
"Notes: Impressively strong yet balanced in a way given its strength. Makes a perfect dessert beer or a night cap to sip on. Certainly is close to the barley wine style though still lined with a big Belgian influence."
"Quite an interesting beer. Amber-orange colored with a sweet malt & alcohol aroma; leading into a rich and fruity malt flavor backed by a solid dry bitterness and peppery spiciness. I love the peachy-light apricot fruitiness! The body is medium light but has a high level of fine carbonation giving it a certain level of creaminess. Although this beer could probably offer much more, the higher alcohol content seems to limit it, as the taste does not change much throughout a glass. The finish is dry, not cloying in anyway, but with a memory of the malt and hop. Impressive, but not superior."
"I have to agree with Mophie.  This is an exceptional beer.  Fortunately I get to have this beer on tap quite often.  I've had it both ways, bottle and tap, and, I have to say, once you have this beautiful beer on tap, there's no going back.  This beer is so drinkable, and the mouthfeel ... exquisite, the way it invades your tastebuds!  Definitely a beer to drink slowly and enjoy."
"Little bottle of potent venom...murky brown amber, final head in the 1/4 inch range, lacy at the margins. Aroma is fairly restrained, slight peach and white wine in character. Alcohol (12% by volume) is apparent right off the bat, sizzles the taste before settling into a full prune/pepper/spice flavor. A little phenolic taste. Not as coating as I was expecting. Peppery at the swallow, a little upcharge through the nasal passages. Too ""rough and ready"" around the edges to me. There are comparable brews of a roughly similar style that I would prefer over this."
"I'm trying to expand my horizons to the Belgian brews a little more and have found some that I enjoy quite a bit and some that I can do without, like this one.  I will keep experimenting as I have 3 from Ommegang to try and the Unibroue anniversary one, but so far, I am still sticking with the Imperial Stouts, IPAs, Barleywines, Porters and Alts as my favs."
"Take an English barley wine and combine it with a Belgian tripel, and that's sort of what this beer is like. Looks very much like a barley wine: bright copper color, creamy white head, but with loads of bubbles. Aroma of faint peach and lightly toasted bread. The taste is awesome, fruity, nutty, spicy. Incredibly, beautifully complex. Nice, dry finish. Alcohol kick (it is, by the way, 12% abv). If you're into barley wines, this is a great way to get you interested in Belgian strong ales. If you're into Belgians, this is a great way to get you interested in barley wines. If you simply love great beer, check this out."
"It's not available in Texas, but every time I travel through New Mexico I pick up as many bottles as I can reasonably afford (last time it was $3.79 for 330ml).  It's that good.  The strongest beer in Belgium and perhaps the most complex.  Hugely fruity and nutty,  and surprisingly dry in the finish.  Called ""Bush"" in Belgium, it's about as far as is possible from the Busch here in the States."
"Scaldis (aka Bush Amber) is one of the most complex and incredibly strong beers in the world. Sit back and sip this one and appreciate it as one of life's finer things."
