"Smells good but is too bitter for my taste."

"Pours a light golden color with a few fingers worth of fluffy white head. Aromas of apple and slight clove. Taste is complex, starts a bit sweet and fruity and finishes somewhat dry with a bit of pepper/spice along the way. Natural carbonation gives it a bubbly but still smooth and at times buttery mouthfeel. A fantastic beer that is well-balanced and fairly complex."
"Very enjoyable. Slight effervescence.     Wonderful notes linger."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and i thought it was a nice example of the style, sometimes it can be hard for American brewers to do these Belgian styles justice, but this one seemed to have just about everything that the style should have.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, very crisp, prickly, pretty dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste just did an ok job at holding my attention, half the bottle is enough for me, anymore than that and the carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just what I expect from a Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was going to be a little brighter than it was.  I might buy this beer again if I'm in the mood for the style and I would only recommend it if your a big fan of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but it was still just a little rough around the edges, but I think for an American example of the style it's better than most.  It's not a favorite beer from this brewery and while it's not a favorite of the style, it was one of the better american ones I've had.  Nice job guys, this was a solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale, keep it up."
"This is a complex beer. Good American version of a Belgian Classic. Probably not fair to call it an American version as it could have easily come from Belgium if the bottle said otherwise"

"Reminiscent of St. Bernardus tripel. Bit overpriced, but very good."
""
"This is a crisp, clean beer. The aroma has a slight fruitiness, a slight bite, and a light maltiness. The flavor light yet rich, with a silky mouthfeel. There is a slight undertone of banana, which I expect more in a Triple, but isn't unwelcome here. All in all, I'm very impressed"
""
""
"750ml bottle poured into nonic. Clear yellow-gold beer with two fingers of active fizzy white head. Spots of lacing are left on the glass. Tropical fruity esters, pears, apples, pepper, clove, and alcohol make up the aroma. Taste is candi sugar, orchard fruit, and honey sweetness up front, followed by a little earthy bitterness and alcohol heat. Medium-plus body, slick texture, champagne carbonation, crisp sweet finish."

"Horrible horrible horrible.  Tastes like a bad bad champagne"

"Well aged bottle. (2nd of a 2009 to 2011 purchase) Still a reasonable head with nice nose, definitely a saison by nose. Flavors have all mellowed out in a very pleasant way. Just a touch of tartness mixed with muted floral notes."
"Reminds me a lot of classic Duvel beer. Quite good."
""
""

"I was a little disappointed by this one. Local 2 is so good, but this one was kind of meh. It dI'd nothing to distinguish itself from other Belgian strong pale ales."
"Just not my type of beer"

"O -- This is one of my favorites and by far the best I've tasted from that brewery. It is well balanced and really a refreshing beer with A LOT of flavor complexity."
"O--This is one of my favorites.  I find it to be very well balanced and really a refreshing beer with a lot of flavors going on.  Whether you want to argue its a farmhouse/saison or a belgian strong ale it doesn't matter--this is a great beer that I will get again for sure"

"The reason I give this beer a 3.75 is because of the alcohol bite. I'm sure it is extremely hard to hide the 9% ABV in this style but it hits you pretty hard on the first few sips and sticks around for a little bit longer than I'd like. Other than that, an extremely good beer."

"Aaaah, Brooklyn Local 1, where art thou? The body, color and aroma are impeccable... An Absolute Winner..."

"It should match perfectly with dessert or cheese after a nice dinner."
"Very champagne flavor saison ale ... very good but not my favorite ... too farmhouse for me."

"This is a very good beer, I had somewhat high expectations, and this is one of the few beers that probably exceeded them.  A very well done, close to perfectly balanced beer (carbonation is just a bit stronger than I'd like).  Nothing jumps out to grab you, and that, to me, is just fine.  Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled in 2011. I like this style, opening it filled the room with a banana aroma. Heavy on the banana taste as well. Super thick rich head that leaves a nice lacing. Not heavy on the carbonation, little flat. Seems like the age didn't help or hurt this beer much, although I did not have a fresh bottle for comparison. Enjoyable but not a rockstar"

"TOTAL: 38/50"

"Citrus and butterscotch in the aroma. The flavor is dominated by a tone of alcohol with some herbs and citrus again. A well made belgian strong ale!"

"Overall, just boring. Blah. Not a whole lot to talk about here."
""
""
""

"Overall this was a good beer but it probably won't ever make it into my rotation of Belgians to buy regularly."
""
""
""

"O: An excellent brew. Great mouth feel, very mellow in taste, definitely a Belgian style beer. Bought in Boca Raton, drank on Deerfield Beach, July 15, 2014."

"The taste is lovely with its toasted barley malt character, sugar and maybe brown sugar sweetness, chewy Belgian yeast, low hops, and overall complex character. Well worth the $8.65 I paid for it. I could drink this regularly."
"O- The more I drank, the more I approved. Letting this one warm a bit is a good idea. Nice complexity. Each sip is a little different, offering different combinations of many different flavors and characteristics. The most dominant flavors are bread based, but it is accented wonderfully by everything else."
""
"Yet another one of those beers best consued in the hot months oft he summer, as it is truly refreshing. An impressive offering to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was good for style. I highly recommend this beer. Listed as a Belgian strong ale, but had elements of a saison, which is a style I am really starting to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad BSPA. As I already mentioned, it tastes like a really heavy saison. Imperial saison maybe? Has that typical grassy, citrus, cloves combination. Just a touch of funk but barely. Loses a bit of the crispness of a lighter saison at the same time. Good but not earth shattering."
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer!"
"Can't remember where I got this one but I have tended to enjoy Brooklyn beers and Belgians so I am guessing that I will enjoy this one. Good looking beer, golden and cloudy with good head that stuck around. Good nose but not overwhelming, crisp but not much of a hint of the alcohol. Taste is very good, and smooth considering the alcohol content. Has a light taste and feel despite being at 9% which gives it good bonus points. Not great, but very good and I enjoyed it very much. Would certainly buy this one again depending upon the cost which I cannot remember. Would like to try it again with the 2 on the same night to compare and contrast which would help me narrow down my top styles."
""
""
"O- It's the best beer I've had in a while"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting, complex, very good."
"O - For a light colored/bodied strong ale it had a very pleasent smell and taste."
""
"An amazing beer and one that definitely lived up to the hype and the price tag for once. Ridiculously easy to drink given the strength of it & was up there with some of the best Belgian beers of the style that I have tried in the past. This one is a must try and I look forward to sourcing a bottle of their Brooklyn Local 2 sometime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a delightful BSPA worth a try and buy - fans of the style will be sure to appreciate it - leans toward the sweet/wet end of the spectrum."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable to be sure, this is certainly a well crafted beer, but I didn't find it earthshattering - and maybe my expectations were a bit high going in. Very well balanced with a light farmhouse character and plenty of light pilsner malt, chewy toffee also on the finish. Great beer and well worth having, but wont be in my top ten for the style. I think I would prefer a more assertive flavour profile to match the abv, while this accomplishes a near graceful balance, to each their own I suppose, still very good! When I eventually got down towards the bottom, I added the sediment, which added some nice bite and spice."

"O- Very complex beer that gives you many aromas and taste. Enjoyed it."
""
""
"O- very soir and fruity. I guess it is expected with this style. Has an almost artificial taste its that fruity. Way to sour for me. Wasn't really a big fan of this one just to sour and fruity for me. Worth the try but probably won't be drinking this one again."

"Overall - A very good and well made Belgian pale ale... recommended"
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/10/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon peel, orange peel, pear, apple, grape, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, honey, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of bright malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a very crisp malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian Strong pale ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a corked and caged bottle. Smell: I get yeast, orange, cream and lime maybe? Taste: I taste what I smell. It reminds me of... A Belgian ale. It's a smooth beer. Carbonation is a little bitey though. Not my style beer, but I wanted to try something new."

"Belgian replica by an American brewer. fruity. rich. very Belgian, but not the real stuff, but still very rich. overall, foamy, yellow, rich, decent abv, nice lacing, blah blah blah... thanks BA for killing me again. delete the review if you want, but I urge you to fix the site first, guys...."

"O: I bought this along with a Local 2 on a recent trip to NY. I would agree with the categorization of strong saison as I found it very saison-esque. I enjoyed the mouth feel and look of this beer and it was a nice enjoyable drink. I would revisit it...but not as fast as I would Local 2."

"overall; one of the better strong belgian ales I've tried, particularly impressive because its american, could easily pass for a fine belgian ale. if you are into this style, you will really enjoy it, but i don't know if it is something id rush to buy again."

"Very nice domestic version of a true Belgium. If blind folded I would never have known. Strong sweet tasting malts, alcohol strength is masked well. Smooth and no bitterness and improved as it warmed. Simple golden color with powerful carbonation. Poured in my regular pub style pint glass from the big corked bottle. Very nice , enjoyed it for a hour and half. Would definitely buy again. Drink at home dont drive !"

"Overall this may be the best Belgian strong pale ale I've had I just wish the carbonation was a little tamer. I'm not going to downgrade it too much though as the taste was very good."
""
""
"O – This is a dead ringer for a Bush Blond. A great example of a strong Belgian ale, even if it was brewed in Brooklyn rather than Belgium. The aromas and flavors are not blended as smoothly and don’t have as much depth as the classic examples, but this is a great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Like so many from Brooklyn, just such a clear representation of style. Solid. Classic. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Best to serve this one at a cold temperature: chilled its fizziness counteracted the sweetness, and warmer it became drier to compensate for the loss of carbonation. A rock-solid Duvel clone - not as good, but not terribly far off. This bottle will get killed solo."
""
"Nutty, fruity taste but spicy - hint of spiced peaches. Very fizzy mouthfeel with a dry finish like a champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - So this is what everyone is ranting about when they talk about Brooklyn Brewery products. I have heard so much, yet have never experienced it for myself. I am glad to see the beer has lived up to the hype. I may send my copy of the Oxford Beer Encyclopedia to Garrett Oliver to have him sign it. This is one excellent beer, strongly recommended, Condor approved."
""
""
""
"O - not a bad beer, but I was hoping for something more. Almost mundane for the style which is why I tend to prefer the Strong Dark Ales. Again, not bad because I would drink again but would not be at the top of my list forthis style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer, but I have to say that I think it's a lower quality beer than Aureus by Draai Laag Brewing. Now, admittedly, I am a Pittsburgher that likes local crafts, but I bought Local #1, Pranqster, and La Fin De Mondes a Total Wine while visiting a friend just outside of Delaware because they are very highly rated on Beer Advocate. None of these three beers is as good and complex as Aureus. So, yes, this is an outstanding beer that deserves a high score, but I prefer Unibrouwe and Draai Laag despite the 100 ranking from the Brothers."
""
""
""
"overall: A great Belgian, this is a great American take on the style. Superbly balanced and drinkable, price a little high, otherwise a solid overall beer. Drank with a lot of non craft beer drinkers and they loved it if that says anything."

"Pours a copper color with very active carbonation and a resilient head. Smells malty/grainy with a subdued Belgian yeast character. Tastes very malty: bread and honey. Mild noble hop finish. Yeast character is pretty restrained. A bit sweet but dries up in the finish. Kind of reminds me of a blonde biere de garde. Alcohol strength is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is very fluffy and frothy. Prickly carbonation goes well to keep this refreshing in spite of the high alcohol. I found this at half-price as my grocery store was trying to get rid of them. Good buy for the money, but I don't know if I'd pay $10 for this at regular price."
"O: A very nice BSPA with quite the kick. Very complex, with many layers. A great bottle to split at dinner in lieu of wine, and probably one that suits most people including wine fanatics. Definitely recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this is right up there with the top strong Belgian pales. At under $10 a bottle, it's a good buy, too. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a fine example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and one of the best American ones out there. This, IMO, could stand toe to toe with anything coming out of Belgium and is quite a bit better than many that do. A great beer at a really good price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good Belgian style ale. Good zesty fruit flavors with a good amount of funk and grainy malt."
""
"Overall this is a very refreshing Belgian that is surprisingly strong. Not overly complex, but very solid."
""
""
""
"D - An exceptional Belgian Strong Pale Ale... Other then a mouthfeel that only rises to the level of very good, everything else about this brew is excellent... One of the best American Interruptions of the style I've encountered... I can highly recommend and attest that I'll be indulging in this fine Brooklyn offering in the future..."
""
""
""
"I really liked this. I think this is the kind of style that's hard to do well, and even when it's done well is only ever going to hit a certain level (I described above the basics of every Belgian Strong Ale I've ever tried, some of them do the job better, of course, but it never really departs too much from that blueprint). That said, this is a very persuasive attempt."
""
""
"It's gold, it carries a solid finger of whites and a brilliant clarity. Smells of carbonation, belgian yeast, some sweet grain, some earthy hops, and a touch of household dust. Flavor is grain, sweetness, some hints of flowers and a bit of corn alongside a dose of belgian pale yeast. Body is thin on medium with hi carb and a bone dry finish. I have to drink water every time I taste the beer - that's just too much. Another beer from Brooklyn, another strikeout - particulary because the mouthfeel is just soo much to overcome."

"For a high ABV this beer has great taste and finish. I had it at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza in Miami with my salad and pizza pie. It was a great compliment to a good meal. Also, the price was excellent. Figure you get 3 glasses of beer versus ordering 3 beers. It is a great value."

"A high, fluffy head floats atop a pale, yellow-amber, clear elixir. The nose is more floral than fruity. The beer's physical character is an accomplished balance of thirst-quenching prickliness and foamy smoothness. Taste? Apricots. It has to be classed as sweet, but completely free of cloyingness. The beer is refreshing but substantial. It's lighter, I suppose, than the estimable Maredsous Tripel, with which it shares stature, but in a good way. Put me down as a fan. Quite good."

"Overall (3.5)- Not a bad beer but not one of my favorite interpretations of the style. I cant say I didnt enjoy it but if Im gonna be spending that kind of money on a beer I probably won't be revisiting this one."
""
""
"O: All aspectws of this beer come together to create a really superb ale. Drinkability is exceptional, and I was happy to have this 750ml bottle to myself. ... and happy to have bought a few more at the same time to share with others at a later date."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A rather nice drinking Belgian style strong ale. It had a good flavor profile and transitions with it even at 9% abv being very easy to drink. A quite nice beer to sit back and enjoy."
"I recommend this belgian for a warm summer evening. Props go out to Brooklyn Brewery on this one."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer, but what else would you expect from Brooklyn. A great version of the style and I hope to drink it again."

"this beer is unreal, and a steal for under 9 bucks. the pour is a little hazy, sunny yellow, with over an inch of thick white head that lasts the whole glass and leaves a fine lacing. the nose is a little saisony, lots of belgian yeast, and not as sweet as i would have thought with the sugar listed. theres something grassy and outdoorsy about this, lovely. the flavor reminds me a lot of the sorachi ace, but with some different hops. its got the same champaigney yeast vibe and belgian essence. balanced as anything, not too sugary, not too hoppy, just a near perfect golden ale with a little summer thrown in. this brings me somewhere far away from my upstate new york kitchen in december. effervescent carbonation and a light but not watery body. creamy feel in the mouth, invisible alcohol. this blew my mind, and is up there with sorachi ace as some of brooklyns best work. i cant wait to get this again, the culinary matchings are endless as well. what a quality brew!"
""
""
"O: A really delicious, fruity, and bready dry Belgian beer"
"O: This is a nice take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It has a very complex, vaguely German yeast character - almost like a weizenbock in many respects - coupled with a big, dry, fruity Belgian backbone. Drinkable and enjoyable."

"Strong Saison? Strong Belgian Pale? Whatever it may be, this beer is awesome."
""
"O- This one is tasty. It's a nice different take on a Belgian Pale Ale, or Strong Belgian Pale Ale which ever you want to call it. It really is hard to call this a strong one considering the way the 9% ABV is hidden. I like the sweetness mixed with the mild funk, and the added bonus of the wheat banana aroma / flavor. Hats off to Brooklyn."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very rich, tasty, and well balanced beer here, full of Belgian goodness and many nice flavors. The alcohol is not notable at first, but it shows up in force later. While you should sip and savor it has that great pull of flavor that can lead one to drink it faster than you should. So while I know for me it should be one is enough....I am quite glad I had a big Duvel-sized glass of this when I split the bottle with the Mrs. A dangerously drinkable beer, but a very good one overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I can't do this, and a good 3/4 of the bottle was a drain pour. Way too much of that ""Belgian flavor"" choking the hell out of me"

"Terrific Belgian pale, glad I finally got a chance to try it. Will pick up again."

"Poured into snifter with think white head, which thinned out in about a minute. Nice lacing though. Hazy amber color with lots bubbles darting up from the bottom of the glass. Smells mostly of fruits and some grain, with some faint spices. The nose is good, but not as strong as others I've tried. Taste balanced and thin; nothing is overpowering. Fruity flavors up front; mango or apricot and apple I think, but the finish is a little more grainy. All of the fruit flavors are subtle and not overpowering. There is a definite bitter bite that stays with you for a while, but it's more subtle than others I've tried. The taste it leaves behind is like apple juice. This has a medium light mouthfeel, but the first thing I noticed about this beer when I took a sip was how carbonated it is. It's like drinking a fountain soda pop; fizzy on the tongue, then it thins out quickly. Overall a very enjoyable beer, and I recommend trying it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think that this a pretty good Belgian Pale Ale. I recommend at least once. I personally do not care much for fruity beers but I think that this one gets right and I might buy another one in the future."
"Poured into goblet, this Belgian ale pours out a nice nutty and burnt orange color and is topped off with a nice thick head that’s just creamy and billowy. The body is mildly hazy and filled with carbonation. The head sticks around for a while and shows no signs of fading any time soon. There’s a thick wall of lacing that just seems to corral the bubbles together. The aroma overall is wheaty with some mild spices, citrus fruits and even raisin. It’s very crisp overall, slightly bitter when it hits the sides of your mouth and it does have a mild alcohol flavor in the background. The aftertaste is mild and filled with spices and hops"
""
"Overall an interesting take on the style. This one tends to emphasize the fruit and pepper profile, nearly no hop presence at all. A pretty good beer, but falls just short of being a great one."
""
""
""
"overall easy to drink as far as the ABV goes.. not my first pick but will definatly drink again"
""
"Tasted from a 0.3L Victory snifter. Pours with a vigorous healthy head of white foam, small bubbles rising through the slightly hazy light amber colored beer. Tropical fruit, light maltiness and slight funk in the nose, spicy yeastiness too. Fruit carries thru the taste as well, not too much hop bitterness for a Belgian P.A. There is a fair amount of malty sweetness though, light alcohol noted too. Finishes nice and subtle with no one component dominating. Not too bad but I've had better in this style."

"Did I mention it's sweet? One of the sugariest beers I've done heard of, but it keeps banging that note until my fingers turn blue. What? Pretty good beer."
""
"Price Point - $8.99/750ML bottle"
""
""
"O/D-A unique BPA. Not my favorite interpretation of the style. Tried it without needing to buy a bottle, but I would not shell out over $10 for a bottle of this. Not really for me, but I respect the liquid craftsmanship."
""
"Overall: I like this beer a lot and would definitely have it again, but I must say it is a bit on the sweet side, even for the style. Big and tasty, yes; a refreshing quaffer, decidedly not."
""
"A must try for most any beer drinker. So smooth."
""
"O: This is a different take on Belgian beer. It has plenty of that cool, funky Belgian yeast flavor. But, for me the sweetness just did not fit well with the Belgian funk."

"Beer is in a 25 oz bottle purchased for $10 bucks. Poured into an 18oz. schooner, it has a thick white head, with nice retention and lacing. Nothing special about the smell, it's sweet and a bit of alcohol. The taste is well balanced, hops dominate, sweet malt finish. Mouthfeel is where the beer is something special. It's medium body with wonderful small bubble carbonation, the carbonation is so good, it's notable. Overall, this beer is true to the style and something I will purchase again."
"I would buy this again and share it as it seems to be a very good beer for hot summer months."
""
"O - Really enjoyable. A bit of age certainly hasn't hurt this one."
"Overall - The booze was well hidden and the beer had a complex flavour. This bottle was a few years old and it's held up well. It had a lot of white wine qualities to it. Worth seeking out."

"Poured into my free Stella Artois Chalice. Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a two finger head of tiny bubble. A lot of visible carbonation. Smells of stonefruit, banana, green apple, and pepper. The taste is great, nice and clean with a good Belgian funk. It is of medium medium and finishes nicely. This is a mighty fine example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, the best beer that I have had in a while."

"Brooklyn Local 1 - The bottle says: “In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, we forge barley malt and hops from Germany, aromatic raw sugar from Mauritius and yeast from Belgium into Brooklyn Local 1. Behind the golden color, find a dynamic complex of flavors, Belgian flair, Brooklyn fortitude, and a dusting of yeast after 100% bottle fermentation. Enjoy it locally or globally, as an aperitif or with your favorite dishes.”"

"O-One of the bests beers to bring to an event with non beer drinkers. The beer went over great at Easter dinner."
""
"Note: This bottle was stored in a refrigerator for 2-4 years prior to opening."
""
""
"Overall I am enjoying this beer. Has a nice smell and taste that is complex but not overpowering, but could do with a little more carbonation in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was amazing. 750 ML bottle. The taste was fresh but pleasant. Fruity but complex. Absolutely the best beer I have ever had. A good beer to store in the basement for a special occasion. Easy to drink, with a decent alcohol content that is really unnoticeable. I cannot say enough about this brew."
"The aroma was sweet with a fruit aspect as it was being poured into the chalice. The aroma was estery and fruity through the white moussy head and contained a very well done earthy and lightly spicy character. Sweet candy with a nice peppery backbone. Floral and fruity rule the day. The golden elixir was lightly hazy in the chalice but the white moussy head lasted very well to lace the glass. The flavor was very, very nice with a prominence of pepper well balanced with a malty light candy/caramel. The flavors worked very well together with a moderate level of bittering and an earthy and lightly grassy hop presence which kept the complexity of the flavor from beginning to end. The body was medium full and with a moderate level of carbonation the mouthfeel was nice and creamy. The finish was just dry with lasting fruit and pepper spice long and pleasant into the aftertaste and beyond. The alcohol was well hidden with a slight presence in the nose and then a decent level of warming that occurred post consumption. This is indeed a beer to seek out, well done and very enjoyable. 1 pint, 9.4 ounce corked and bailed bottle."
"O: This is n awesome Belgian ale - well put together with great aromas and flavors."
""
"Overall: I had tried this years ago when it was first release. I didn't like it. I thought I'd give'er another shot in 2012. I didn't like it."
""
""
"An excellent, classy and beautifully executed Belgian Pale that is an absolute joy to drink."
""
""
"O- A beautiful beer with rich flavors and lots going on. Less fruity than the local 2 and a really, really nice beer. The best thing I've tasted from Brooklyn, by far."
""
"Overall decent and slightly different but the spice is a bit much and needs some food for balance. Some yeast bite throws things off a bit too."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This must be one of the best Belgians brewed in the U.S."
""
""
"Medium bodied with high carbonation, but the carbonation is extremely fine and mousse-like. Great texture. As a caveat to any reader, I will confess I have never had this beer fresh before. I have very little experience with aged beer. With that said, I greatly enjoyed this bottle of beer despite there being, I suspect, some oxidative flavour in it. I would love to drink this again fresh, but I still enjoyed this a great deal with the unintended cellaring I've subjected it to."
""
"Overall the best belgian style I've ever had, it being one of my least favorites. This one sat well with me though: the execution was excellent and this beer brought a lot to the table."

""
""
""
""
"O: Amazingly enjoyable. It just seemed to have the right balance of light malt and complex fruitiness with a kick of hops. I am immediately seeking this one out to try again."
""
"O- Other than it almost killing me and scaring the hell out of fiancee I enjoyed it. It's not as top notch as the Local 2 but that is like comparing apples and oranges."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - was really looking forward to this drink, and it has absolutely met my expectations. Flavors play with each other in your mouth, carbonation is great. Makes you think that someone took a lot of time putting this together, like a good meal or argument."
""
""
""
"I was really blown away by this one. I'd put it right up there with the greats such as Duvel."
""

"Great great beer - I realised it was rated highly on BA, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would!"

"O: AWESOME beer. I wasn't expecting this to be that good. It was just perfectly balanced for being a belgian strong pale ale."

"Overall: Overall you just got everything....one of the specimens ever brewed. I always have numbers in mind when judging a beer, and this is Brooklyn Brewery's finest (NO LIE). Take it for what it is, it is not soda or your really good flavored beer....it is for what it is, REAL BEER!"

"A flawless American version of the style and probably my favorite beer so far from Brooklyn."
""
""
"Deep orange, massive white rocky head, good retention and lacing. Yeasty with notes of spice, lots of tropical fruit, sweet candy notes, nice hop bill adding some citrus fruit, faint alcohol scents. Taste is of spicy yeast, lots of fruit, apple, mild banana, more of the tropical fruits from the nose, light sweetness that ends in a drying finish. High prickly carbonation, full body with good weight, Incredibly solid stuff, very drinkable and quite flavourful, better than most Belgian pales from Belgium."
""
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit. No off characters whatsoever. A little more complexity would have been nice, but the beer is still great as is."
""
"Served from bottle into goblet glass at refrigerator. From the first pour it is obvious that this is world class beer. It pours with a huge, slowly-dissipating head which is about as thick as a beer can have. The aroma is faintly of the trademark 'raw sugar' with a subtle noble hop presence. For such a flavorful beer, the aroma is surprisingly subtle. The flavor is similarly subtle with malt and raw sugar presiding over noble hops. This would be an uneventful beer were it not for the fact that it is, well, about as perfect as you can expect to find. The closest competition is Duvel and they are evenly matched. This is highly recommended. The 5-star rating was long pondered; it is not given lightly. The truth is that, after finishing the whole bottle, I cannot find fault."
""
"Pale gold in color and rather cloudy. A gentle pour of roughly ten ounces into a tulip leaves about an inch of foam that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. The majority of the smell seems to come as a result of the yeast as in the nose I get a great deal of ester ranging from fruity citrus to spicy cloves. That is backed by a solid pale malt with a touch of spicy hop and some slight alcohol. The good score is because I expected a bit more strength. The taste follows the nose. Things start out quite spicy with pepper like flavors on top of a touch of sweetness that wraps up slightly bitter. As the beer warms and I get deeper into the bottle more of the yeast esters and flavor come out creating a dynamic experience. The mouthfeel is wonderfully light and almost effervescent as the fine carbonation makes it feel as though this beer floats in the mouth. The alcohol does become apparent though it is mainly through a great warming sensation and never cloying or overly oppressive. Overall this is a very solid beer, this is a tough style to separate oneself from the crowd as there are many world class offerings but this beer does manage to hold its own within that crowd."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Soft, light appearance, but with a great head. Not much lacing though. Nose is a floral and sweet malty combo. Flavor is subtly sweet on a baked bread base. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O: I like this beer a lot, even my girlfriend and her friends love it and they hate beer. Very nice clean fruity taste, I will be buying one of these to age."
"overall its a solid beer. i'm not a big fan of belgians but hey i try them with an open mind nonetheless"
"Cloudy yellow tint with a frothy head, adequate lacing as it goes down. The aroma reminds me of molasses, maltiness, coriander, lemon peel, and sour apple. The taste starts with sweet brown sugar and apple intermingled with earthy spices. Surprisingly, it seems light for the alcohol and flavor as it coats the mouth. This brew exceeded my expectations."
"O- Disclaimer: I'm not a big Pale Ale fan, but have to hand it to Brooklyn on this effort. Found it very hard to set down. Smooth and flavorful with just enough carbonation and citrus to hide the 9%. Creamy and full, I will be having another one of these shortly-"
"Overall - Like other Belgian style ales, it hides its alcohol very well. It's a solid example of a strong BPA."
"Trying this back to back with the Local 2, it's hard to say which one was better. They both serve their own unique purpose and are completely world class."
"This is one of my favorite Belgian style US beers. The balance and carbonation are done extremely well."
"O- Really a top-tier beer. Worth the price of admission, for sure."
"Overall: I can't believe I waited to long to finally try this beer, I was very impressed with it."
"O: Among the BSPAs I've tried, this ranks right up there behind Duvel at the top. It's got everything you want in a high-quality strong ale. It's just a shame that it's not available in 4- or 6-packs, just the large wine bottle size. Good for sharing, though. Highly recommended. A solid A/A+ in my book."
"Have had numerous times before I joined BA and acutally sat down to review it."
"O - This is a good Belgian-style ale. Another fine ale from Brooklyn."
"Enjoyed it a lot. Thought it as more of a saison though. Have wanted to try this for awhile so thanks TATURBO. On the fence if id ever buy it."
"This is really good. Garrett Oliver seriously knows how to manage yeast and produce a stunning Belgian ale. The dried out malt is great without it becoming bland and the yeast is really nice."
"O: unbelievably good, I'm so impressed."
"third time thru on this one apearance is outstanding great rocky head that disapates slowly mouth feel is rich and just enough bitters to keep me into this beer, not that I'm regionally biased but this guy has me buzzing or maybe it's watching Adam Scott destoy the field in Akron at any rate damn good beer ."
"High carbonation, light bodied, and the alcohol flavor is front and center. I wish it could have been better disguised. A good beer, but does not measure up to the best BSPAs."
"O: great brew, very refreshing. Nice example of a style I usually enjoy. Brooklyn hit it out of the park"
"Big, bubbly white head that lingers a half inch thick in the glass after a big pile on the pour sitting on top of an old gold ale that brightens to a dull yellow with a bright back light. Banana, clovers, fruity esters and a hint of pepper in the nose. Very clean but a very pretty yeasty smell. Peppery and spice notes strengthen in the taste and build on the nose--almost like a preview. Significant carbonation intensifies the flavors--especially the spice. Extremely well balanced and bouncy. Fun beer that I will savor through the night."
"As soon as i opened this the cork wanted to fly off like a champagne cork but all under control and it pours a cloudy golden hue with a two finger rocky sudsy head and sporadic lacing,the smell is very Belgian with aromas of fruity floral hops,doughy bread,sweet candy and candied pears,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and quite creamy with tastes of candied pears,boiled candy,white grapes,doughy bread and finished with a floral bouquet hoppy sweetness and overall its a tasty drop that would be beautifully suited to seafood."
"Very nice."
"Medium to light mouthfeel that is reasonably pleasant on the palate. Less than I expected overall."
"O- a good offering but sort of 1 sided not complex..still good"
"O - I thought this was a Saison. Oh well, still an extremely tasty beer that I'd probably buy again."
"Perhaps not on the level of a Duvel but certainly an excellent ale. Paired swimmingly with the lobster!"
"A very good beer. Not at the top of the list but it will not disappoint."
"overall a solid beer not worth the big price in my opinion but definitely something worth going for"
"Overall I seem to prefer the local 2 over this since it has more spice and orange tones rather than heavy yeasts but it was still worth the try if only to uncork. May not have again."
"O - This has decent drinkability. It goes down pretty easily, and I could drink a few glasses, even considering the ABV. Overall, I think it is a decent beer. It was a little bit of a letdown for me, I was expecting something awesome, but I didn't quite get it. If the carbonation and the bitter finish were toned down a bit I would like it a whole lot more. It's worth a try though."
"Outstanding."
"Overall this is one of the better American takes on a strong saison. Extremely enjoyable - i look forward to trying Local #2!"
"D - the lingering finish might slow you down but overall an enjoyable/drinkable beer."
"O. Overall I would have to say that I am impressed. Was a lot more like a Saison for me, and a pretty good one. My first Broolyln beer except for the Brooklyn/Schneider Hopfenweisse. I am looking forward to trying more from them, especially Local 2. Only negative that I would say is the carbonation is a little over the top."
"O - a big beer that is very Belgian with a pale ale compliment, the hop character is generally subtle but does linger, ABV is well hidden here"
"Overall: Finally I get to have an American made Belgian Strong Pale / Golden Ale that actually rivals the Belgian heavy hitters such as Duvel and Delirium Tremens (Goose Island Matilda is more like Orval, so I am not counting that. Just mentioning that because I love Matilda). Great stuff!"
"Overall another great beer from Brooklyn. I will buy many of these and will do my best to share the bottle, although it will be difficult not to drink it all."
"Brooklyn's ""Local 1"" pours a slightly cloudy yellowish orange, with ample white head that does not dissipate very quickly and laces minimally. It smells great with ample spice initially, and aromas of bready malt, banana, and some citrus finishing out the nose. ""Local 1"" is big on taste, with nice malty breadiness, lemon, and more spice on the tongue. It has a great feel, very crisp, slightly dry, carbonation is great and the overall result is a great example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale from Brooklyn Brewery."
"This beer pours out as a hazy looking yellow color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer is sweet and yeasty, has a bit of citrus in there too. The taste of the beer is floral and hoppy. There is an aftertaste of bread in there. The mouthfeel is light even for the strength of the brew, it leave a dry feel in the mouth after each sip. Overall it's a pretty good brew."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the Belgian yeast with some lemons, coriander and orange notes. The flavor is similar. I get some nice wheat and bread malt notes with some pepper and coriander as well as some Belgian yeast, orange and lemons. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"M: Medium-bodied, some carbonation along with some alcohol warmth is great for cleansing the palate. Some biscuity qualities as well as it lightly coats the tongue and mouth. Solid drink even a newbie can appreciate."
"O: Very good and enjoyable all the way around"
"Someone brought teh Local 1 and Local 2 to teh beer tasting party that we have about once a quarter. The color was a golden cloudy with a lot of carbonation which led to good white head. There was not much smell other than hints of grain. The taste was quite nice fortified by clove and spice. The flavors are all well balanced even with the higher abv. The mouthfeel is hurt somewhat by the high abv. Overall a decent beer."
"Overall it's a 5 no matter how you slice it. Out of the ballpark with this one! 5/5"
"Bravo!"
"Overall-I would say this is a great beer to drink in between two BIG beers to cleanse the palate but this is a pretty damn BIG beer. I'm halfway through and can feel it. Overall a great and nicely balanced brew."
"O: Brooklyn Brewery provides an excellent introduction to a style which might not necessarily be appealing to the masses."
"The beer is really tasty, but it was slightly drier and spicier than others I've had from this category. My palate adjusted mid-bottle and I noticed I was throwing this back pretty easily. Not sure if Brooklyn plans on expanding to the West Coast, but I'll be sure to look for this on my next trip to NY."
"O- This is a great beer that has a great spiciness to it as well as some sweetness to balance it out. It looks great when poured and feels and smells great as well."
"My first perfect score. Simply one of the best beers I've ever had. Pours a golden yellow, small bubble head. Smells yeasty, fruity. Tastes of slightly sour peaches, has some sweetness, yeast is balanced, just a crazy good beer. Has some floral notes on the end, mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall, awesome!"
"O: I am a big fan of Brooklyn brewery... and beers like this is the reason why."
"New to the bottle fermented style of this white ale. Exceptional taste, refreshing and layered taste notes, complex feel and quality offering. The beer is harrder to find but worth the hunt. My favorite new beer this year. I will look forward to the Sarachi Ace and Local 2 but feel that this is their best offering."
"Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a about an inch of white head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a good amount of sticky head on the glass. Gives off floral scents and sweet fruity smell. Has the same sweet fruit taste and malts. Has a light body and has a lot of carbonation with a a lot of flavor for this style of beer. Very drinkable for the abv. Forgot that it was 9%."
"Finish: Malty sweet, biscuit, and a little sticky"
"Way too drinkable at the stsart for the 9% ABV. Result: it slows you down to a (very enjoyable) crawl."
"Smells like a real Belgian ale and taste like one too. Absolutely delicious. I've never had a beer from this brewery before but if this is representative of what they produce, I'm a fan."
"Poured into a tulip. Clear vibrant gold, champagne effervescence is apparent in the white bubbly head, it's not unlike anyhitng i've ever seen before. Smells of light tropical fruitiness and dry malt. Away we go. >pinch< first thing that comes to mind is that they must be full of b.s. that this is 9% or i'm dreaming. If you told me this was from an abbey in Belgium i'd never think twice. Dry apples, pears, and a wee bit of peach. The malt is dry too, almost like an unsalted cracker. The hops are playing hide-and-go-seek here but deliver a bit of spice here and there and it all melts together with finally a tiny hint of estery alcohol, but surely not hinting at 9%. This beer is easy, in a complex way. Cheers!"
"Overall a very pleasant, tasty and refreshing Belgian style brew from Garret Oliver. Another homerun from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"I never thought I would like a beer that favored the phenolic side of Belgian yeast, but this one is all right."
"D -- A must try. Everyone should experience this clinic of an American influenced Belgian Pale."
"CHEERS"
"Overall, a great beer. This is definitely an example of a Belgian beer being done well outside of Belgium. I would be very happy if it was regularly available here in Ontario."
"Overall: Not bad. The flavor's are nice, but they're not very strong. It might be a little too subtle."
"Bought this corked bottle at whole foods in new York city. The bottle and presentation remind me of a fire station for some reason. This beer was very Belgian influenced. A lot like chi may in appearance and a stout 9% alcohol content this beer was made for slow playing. Not a whole lot of sediment but still full bodied. A great beer made here in the states is a must try for any lover of the Trappist Belgian style beers."
"Pours pale orange with a thick, rich white head that lasts through the glass. Aroma of tart malt and apricot with some creamy yeast. Taste of crisp malt and yeast, a bit one-dimensional. A bit of fruity tartness mixed with the yeast, which is smooth. Taste is a pretty subdued for a strong ale, I expected much bolder flavors. Very smooth and clean mouthfeel and quite drinkable, but it really doesn't have powerful flavors. Quite impressive for a beer of this gravity to be this smooth and clean, but I would rather have it taste stronger in more ways."
"This beer is highly carbonated leading to a very effervescent mouthfeel. Finish is dry but some residual sweetness is left on the palate making for a nice sipping beer on a warm summer day. Overall a beer that walks the line of being a strong pale or a saison quite well. I'll have to agree with Mr. oliver though, strong saison is a perfect descriptor."
"I'm digging Belgian Pales. I'd say Brooklyn 1 lived up to my expectations. It is a gorgeous beer. I wish for more hopping and perhaps a stronger nose, but very well done."
"Mouthfeel if fairly light and quite dry. Overall a very refreshing ale, not quite Belgian in style but with a nice yeast presence. Not bad at less than $10 for a 750ml bottle either."
"Overall a great Strong Ale with a medley of components coming together for one really fantastic tasting brew which does a nice job of concealing the high alcohol content."
"D: I really enjoyed this one.Great flavor that makes this one very easy to drink. I could definitely drink quite of few of these before I land on my bum from the high ABV."
"Drinkability - A really good representation of a Belgian, but very sweet. Not sure if I would have more than 2 glasses or a 750."
"Well done Brooklyn!"
"D - Pretty decent, especially for the abv. Might go for again in the summer..."
"Overall: B-"
"This is a great food pairing beer, and has lots of applications for that. Even on its own to drink it's very refreshing. However, this isn't an anytime beer for me of this style but is still a real well done product."
"Good take on the style and an enjoyable brew. Easier to drink than some."
"D: If you can get past wasting half the beer in foam form, it's drinkable but there just isn't as much there as others in this style. Putting this one in the pass pile."
"Overall, not bad at all, but definitely worth sharing. Save for a special occasion, but (though it should cellar for a few years), don't cellar for too long. This one is meant to be consumed fairly young, and it's definitely tasty that way."
"A little bit thin, and over-carbonated even for a Belgian strong pale ale. The alcohol is too formidable, even after some time to age, and there isn't enough fruitiness or spiciness to really make this stand out for me. There are many other widely available BSPAs that I would choose over this one."
"D - Goes down fast. No booze, so easy to down for a 9%. A real treat and an exceptional beer for an event or special party."
"Crisp and refreshing, yet very complex in flavor. There's tropical fruits and spices up front, I get mixture of pineapples and banana with some cloves. Sweet bready malt in the middle, but very clean tasting. I notice there some yeasty and peppery notes in the taste. Finish off pretty dry, yet it's very smooth. Alchohol is well hidden."
"The taste was very refreshing. It was very light in flavor overall but the flavors that were there made for an excellent beer. The carbonation made it very bubbly and the Belgian-ish fruity sweetness (apricot?) was underlying throughout. The highlight of the beer, though, is the hop spice. Unlike most hoppy beers, Local 1 Ale did not have much bitter taste. Instead, it was spicy, almost like nutmeg. It tingled the tongue just enough to give the beer that extra goodness to make the beer stand out. This leaves a dry finish that goes well with the spicy hops flavor. It also has a strong but not overwhelming alcohol taste to it but that is to be expected because of the 9% ABV. If you want a light beer with some interesting flavors that has some (alcohol) kick then this is a bottle you should pick up."
"D - Very good drinkability. ABV not noticable. Seems like a great beer to have for a special occasion, very well balanced and such a wide aroma of flavors it should appeal to most crowds. This was described by most that were in this tasting as a mix of a saison and a hefe."
"Dr: Hides its ABV exceptionally well. Too dry to drink repeatedly."
"Nice appearance. Foamy head hold strong and lacing the glass. Hazy and yellow in color. Nice looking. Smells wonderful. Similar to how I expect an Achouffe to smell. True Belgian Yeast flavors. This beer is highly drinkable considering the respectable ABV. I split the 22oz champagne bottle three ways comfortably. And would gladly drink again. really nothing local tasting about the beer, but quite delicious. Nicely done Brooklyn Brewery. cheers"
"Pours a light golden color w/ a 4 finger white puffy head (in spite of a careful pour). The smell is very fruity- pear, apple, spice come to the forefront. Very light airy smell. The taste seems out of balance to me. The fruit taste seems muted, and the alcohol taste is a lot more present. I am actually a little disappointed this beer doesn't taste like the smell. It lacks a little flavor for me. There's also a bitterness that comes through w/ the taste. Mouthfeel is average, as well as drinkability. Glad I finally got to try this one, but probably won't pick it up on a regular basis."
"D - Great BSPA. Brooklyn really did it here. Refreshing with good strong ABV but nothing too overwhelming."
"750mL bottle. Pours a bright golden color with a huge frothy head. Guess I'm not in a hurry to drink this one. Lots of lacing. Aroma is sour with some yeast, banana, and grains. Taste is not nearly as sour as the aroma led me to believe. Flavors of yeast, banana, malt, and bread. Almost a banana bread taste to it. A bit of a warming alcohol quality. Pretty heavy brew and definitely a beer to take your time with. Worth checking out. Would be perfect for a nice sipper after a big meal."
"D - Easy drinking, careful...the alcohol will sneak up on you!"
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Golden colour, orange highlighting. Hazy. Compact white head. Nose has spicy yeast, citrusy orangey notes, some nice honeyish sweetness. In the mouth there is a nice citrus sweetness, some bready malts, caramel, spice. Finishes yeasty/spicy and ulitmately dry. Some bread and yeast aftertaste with some light alcohol. Medium body with a soft mouthfeel, light carbonation."
"Price = $9.49 at Witherspoon Wine"
"D: This is a great beer to sip on before dinner, and goes just as well with so many different foods. Drinkability is the same as a champagne; if you can drink that all night you could do the same with this. There's enough complexity to urge you to take another sip, but its very smooth and subtle."
"Overall: I'm in love with this beer. Seriously. I only wish it was a little cheaper, so I could afford to drink it all the time. Also, for what it's worth, I tried adding a little twist of lemon (I know, heresy, but I had to try), and not only did it NOT improve the beer, it actually skunked that particular glass of it."
"I found this to be a particularly interesting beer. It poured somewhat orange and smelled strong of yeast with some fruit notes there too. Taste was began spice with some malt notes following. The alcohol began becoming apparant after a few swigs but it wasn't overwhelming. It was a very smooth beer given the alcohol. I found it to be very drinkable. In some ways it reminded me of Saison Dupont's flavors."
"D: This is one of the better brews of its style and certainly the best American-made one."
"D: This beer is easily drinkable for 9% ABV, it is a smooth drinking BSPA, but this isn't my favorite style. It's good but I wouldn't buy it again, there are other Belgian beers out there that are far superior to this."
"Really solid effort from Brooklyn here. Apart from the appearance, this is not going to blow your mind or anything. But it does everything right. If you like BSPAs then definitely seek this beer out."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but on the lighter side of medium. Nice carbonation. Had a slightly dry finish. Overall a really easy drinking beer, especially ay 9%. Wish it was a little cheaper to buy in my area though."
"750 mL custom bottle with batch code. Brewed to 18.5 Plato with Bamberg (Weyermann?) pilsner malt, raw sugar, Perle and Styrian Goldings hops. Fermented with Belgian yeast and bottle-conditioned. Pours a chill-hazed orange, with loads of carbonation and an inch of frothy white head that reduces to a fine cap. Hugely fruity aroma contributes orange, mango, papaya and pineapple, spicy/floral hops and earthy yeast. Complex, fruity, delicious. The palate adds to (or perhaps detracts from) this notes of chalky yeast, a few phenols, an almost harsh hop flavor and a lingering sweetness. Light and crisp at the start, but as the carbonation mellows, the body fills out. This brew has a very flavorful yeast and it is very easy to drink despite the ABV. It tastes quite authentic, and despite my nitpicking on the flavor, this is definitely worthy of a revisit."
"Brooklyn Brewery - Local 1 from '07 was next. This was a rare treat especially since we don't get Brooklyn beers up here in Wisconsin. My friend, Jon, mentioned that the shape of the bottle was unique to the first run of Local 1 before New Belgium stepped up and cried copyright infringement (I haven't looked up the details). My notes start getting a little bit hard to read around this beer but I remember thinking it was an awesome. A big sweetness and an almost coffee-like roast to it made me feel that if I has tasted this blindfolded I would have describes a more dark-bodied beer. I wished there was more of this in that bottle."
"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. This is a pale golden color; extra-fizzy with a couple inches of head. Smells very ""Belgian"" with candy-sugar, lemon, and grass. Taste is a sweet lemon upfront with some hoppiness, peppery spices, and more lemon at the back end. Alcohol is blended in very well, making this dangerously drinkable for 9% ABV. Mouthfeel is extremely fluffy and well-carbonated. All-around, this is very good."
"Poured into a tulip from a 750. Complex aroma featuring light fruit (pear and apple), sweet malt and low alcohol aroma. Low spiciness, more from yeast than hops. The beer is a medium gold, with fairly high cloudiness - much more than expected for this style. Features a thick, fluffy, long-lasting white head. Very complex flavor: the grainy pils malt sweetness, medium hop bitterness, complex yeast spiciness, and alcohol all fight to dominate but none of them overpowers the others. Yeast character features almonds, citrus, pear. This beer is a bit sweet up front, but dry in the finish. High carbonation helps dry it out, even with a medium body. Drinkability would be better if the alcohol was a bit smoother and subtler. I really enjoy this beer, but there are better examples of the style."
"D: great for pre-dinner and with a meal, I prefer this to Local Two by a smidge"
"An American combination of various central European ale brewing tropes, and yet rendered without a heavy stateside hand - so kudos on that. Good stuff, and enjoyable, with no overwrought hop or booze wallop, which helps turn attention to a more (and intended, I'm sure) Belgian strong ale association, worthy of all the sturm und drang (there is a German component here) wafting about right now."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, flavorful brew. It definitely has more of a kick than something like Duvel which is quite enjoyable, particularly on a cold winter evening (about halfway in a felt a nice warming sensation in my stomach). For what it is the price is incredible and I would definitely be tempted to purchase this drink again. Great special offering by the Brooklyn Brewery."
"D: Alcohol content is understated, not too filling, complex but in a straightforward way thats very approachable. Has a generically ""familiar"" taste to it, in that these are some quintessential flavors in a style that's done as close to perfection as possible"
"D: Really quite nice. One of the better Brooklyn beers I've tried."
"Drink- A solid 5 really. My 1st offering from Brooklyn and thanks to my bro in law for bringing this from DC for his holiday trip. I have Local 2 in the fridge Ill pop that tonight."
"I paid nine dollars for the big bottle which is an ok price, would buy again."
"A well-made beer."
"Time to get back to the Brewery."
"The alcohol is well masked, but wipes clean any lacing on the glass. This would make for a nice aperitif or an accompaniment to seafood. I am looking out for the Local 2 as of now."
"Drinkability: One of the better Belgian ales by a U.S. brewery; I really enjoyed this."
"Also, Brooklyn Brewery has some of the best looking bottles... just thought I'd say it."
"D - great summer time Saison type ale."
"This beer pops beautifully in the mouth - full on flavor all at once. The sting of carbonation hits hard and releases multiple flavors at once in perfect harmony. Nice full chewey grain taste backed by citrus and fresh floral and greens - finnishes dry, leaving your mouth craving more. An excellent brew!"
"750ml bottle. Pours hazy golden with nice, long lasting white head and Champaign like carbonation. Brady, yeasty, fruity (banana and pear) aroma . Full, crisp body. Venous fruit, bready malt balanced by a good amount of spicy hops fill the mouth. Long dry finish. Another great, complex beer from Brooklyn."
"Overall: I liked this one. I was impressed by its drinkability. It tastes very smooth and refreshing. A solid American take on the Belgian Style."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"Overall, a long time favorite that I wish I could get with more regularity. Certainly worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Even with its strength, this beer is relatively easy to drink. A good apertif, and finishing just about the whole bottle was not a problem."
"D - OK drinkability. The alcohol is strong and the flavors are geared around that alcohol. Pair with some earthy cheeses and darker breads to balance the beer out."
"Had to pair it up with Brooklyn style margherita pizza. Would work with seafood as well."
"Light carbonation and a medium body."
"The fruity taste is nice, but it has high carbonation - not a good point with me. Also has high alcohol content and you can smell and taste that - not a good combo in a fruity carbonated beer. Definitely do not let this beer warm or the alcohol will take over totally. Also, this didn't need to come in such a big bottle, you can't (shouldn't) drink all that yourself at 9%. If they could tone down the carbonation it would really help this beer."
"D: very drinkable, astringency and yeast is a slight amount distracting but nothing bad"
"This is an exceptional Belgian beer, period. It is golden in color with a nice thick head. Very complex in flavor. Hoppy, estery, fruity...it is amazing what the Belgian yeast can do. This beer was a joy to drink. I liked even more than Local 2 which I had first. Have this beer with dinner or just enjoy it with a friend. It is a pure treat."
"Pours out cloudy with a nice white head. Golden color and some carbonation. Smells yeasty and grainy with a hint of wheat malt sweetness. Bananas grains and a citrusy backblast of hops.fizzy mouthfeel and syrupy. Medium overall on mouthfeel. Drinkability is very good and it makes me cheery."
"Notes: don't know why I overlooked the Local 1 & 2's for so long. Glad I bought both yesterday."
"D- Great belgian, quite an incredible take and I'll be back for this one!"
" It's a sipper, but makes a GREAT companion while watching the Patriots knock off the Ravens in OT. I really can't fault Local 1 in any way."
"D: This is a pretty complex drink with a higher ABV. One bottle sufficed."
"This is a very tasty and balanced ale. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Plus, the bottle is as cool as any I've seen."
"D: a great beer, i HAVE to be in the mood for it though. A heavy Pale Ale. Well done, Brooklyn."
"Very good - equal to some of the best Belgians. I took the cage off after letting the bottle sit outside the fridge to come to temperature. Then I got a little surprise as the cork gave a good pop and the bottle did a little gusher. Pours with a huge foamy, frothy, cream colored head that quickly settles to a small, but persistant cover and some lace. Color is a clear amber with some small bubble trails. Aroma is yeasty, malt, bread dough, grass, and a little fruit. Flavor is a little on the dry side at first and then yields to a mild sweetness; like the nose, and does go great with a variety of foods. Body is soft and carbonation is robust and a good match for the beer. Finish has duration, is like the flavor, and leaves a sense of satisfaction. Well done. Maybe not a session beer though."
"One finger pure white head small bubbles medium dissipation with minimal lacing. Golden orange body a bit cloudy (chill haze?) several streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is fairly fruity, meyer lemons, coriander, more fruity than spicy. The taste mirrors nose, pretty sweet. Medium mouthfeel, a bit heavy for the style, fairly dry finish due to yeast strain, decent effervescence. Pretty drinkable though the sweetness effects drinkability, not a lot of alcohol heat, fairly well hidden ABV kick. This beer certainly straddles the line between BSPA and a Saison, doesn't fit neatly into either category. Given the relatively high price point, I think next time I'll seek out Pranqster or Damnation or a real BSPA. Fairly tasty, but IMO not that great."
"Overall, I'm very pleased with this beer. I am not a fan of Brooklyn Lager so for the longest time I haven't given Brooklyn a fair chance so I am glad to be checking out their other offerings. I definitely recommend this one."
"Hands down the best Belgian Style Ale brewed in the US to date. All other American brewers that are thinking about brewing Belgian Style Ales need to take notice. A lobster roll on a gilled bun with a side of shoestring fries and mayo is the ultimate pairing."
"D: The amount of bitterness, dryness and spices makes this a beer that can only be slowly sipped."
"92 1/2 Points"
"I really love this beer. It seems like more often than not I'm disappointed by American attempts on authentic Belgian tasting beers and I think this one matches up to the likes of Duvel and other types quite well. This is stuff I would buy by the case if I had the cash."
"Nice job Brooklyn. I'll ride the Local 1 any time."
"D: An excellent saison, albeit a strong one. Wonderfully balanced."
"edit: as with many craft brews, but particularly so here, it does the beer a great disservice to drink it cold. let it warm and open up."
"Overall it is a decent ""strong saison"" and I can see how it would be difficult to categorize this one."
"I had it just recently with a very warm and melted Brie, which was excellent. The Local 1 so perfectly cleanses your palate for each new taste. I would expect that this will work well with most all cheese dishes, spicy foods, seafood, or roasted ham."
"A nice solid brew if not especially inspiring."
"The beer is very light in the mouth with a high level of carbination. Overall a very well balanced and enjoyable beer worth seeking out."
"Another great beer from Brooklyn. Dense foam with high durability and nice lacing. Aroma: citrus, floral, malty and orange. The taste, lost points for be extremely sweet, but has great fruity notes, bitter and herbal. Bitter end (much hops) and spicy. I noticed a more pronounced flavor of yeast and sweet, while the temperature of beer increased, bringing greater complexity to the beer, both in aroma and in flavor. Beautiful beer."
"Pours a murky light orange colour with huge white head. As the head dissipates, it has nice retention and lacing. Smells of clove and spicy Belgian yeast, almost like a saison. Has small amount of bitterness to go with delicious Belgian yeasty flavour. Great carbonation and dangerously drinkable. I had this with duck confit and it went great together."
"Drinkability: This beer seems like it should be so much better- between the massive head, the relatively weak smell, and the overpowering alcohol, something is definitely off about this one. As I noted in most areas, the beer mellows out a bit, but my first impression definitely wasn't good. This beer gets better as you drink a bit more, but I still expected it to be good throughout. I expect this one hasn't shelved very well (despite refridgeration) or I got a bad bottle. I'd be willing to try this again, though if it remains so terrible at the beginning, I'll stick to Local 2."
"D = Drink it slow"
"Taste is sharp and dry with tons of carbonation an a huge mouthfeel. Very rich and spicy. Excellent with spicy food."
"Into a stemmed Brooklyn glass, poured a cloudy golden hue, with nearly three fingers of bright white, with fantastic head retention and great lacing. Banana, clove, lime, lemon, bubble gum, coriander, vanilla, caramel, and modest orange peel were all detected in the nose. Impressive mix. The taste began with a lean towards citrus and bubblegum, followed by a more fruity/malt/caramel balance, and finished on a dry bitter orange peel note. Spritzy, yet medium-bodied mouthfeel. Only the feintest hint of the alcohol content makes this a very nicely drinkable Belgian-style specimen."
"A nice beer from Brooklyn. I'd like to share this with others next time. Also, I'm looking forward to trying Brooklyn Local 2."
"Solid offering from Brooklyn. A bit sweeter than what you'll find with Duvel (one can't help but compare the two), but that only adds to its uniqueness. Definitely worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"I like this and imagine it would work well as a food pairing brew."
"Overall, Brooklyn Local 1 is a good beer, but doesn't reach the higher level Belgian styles."
"Flavor is very good. At first this beer is on the sweet side, but the finish is actually quite dry, with rubbery yeastiness and solid hop bitterness. Malty sweetness reminiscent of butter cookies and caramel combines with a fruity, estery flavor a la orange, banana, and tart apples. There is a tiny bit of funk that hints at the Saison style, but I would say this beer is correctly classified in the Belgian strong ale category. The alcohol content makes the drink pretty warming, as does the peppery, spicy character of this beer. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and effervescent, though the body is not too overwhelmingly heavy for a high octane beer. I appreciate how this lighter feel contributes to drinkability. Still tastes like an American attempt at a Belgian, but nevertheless very good."
"Overall - I thought this was a really great beer! - This beer has been aged for just a little over a year now though - so I will have to try to find a fresher version to see how it compares."
"Pours a nice golden amber with an ebullient head that stays around for a while. Smell is a tad spicy and very full. Grains are up front with the spices and fruit in the background. A bit of a zesty character hidden in the mix as well. Mouthfeel and taste are full and bready. Drinkability is very high."
"Murky dark gold in body with thick, foamy marshmallow head. Lemon, pineapple, citrus rind, booze, spicy aroma. Citrus, citrus rind, lemon, sour apple, hop bitterness toward the finish and some booze. Thick, medium-heavy body with low carbonation in the mouthfeel. A good spiced pale ale that feels as if it were brewed abroad but was done nicely in BK. Cheers"
"Drinkability: I thought this was a reasonably well made beer. It went down easily and I would have no problem with purchasing another. That said I think that Duvel has nothing to fear from this or any of its competitors."
"Medium body with quite a lot of carbonation and a dryness that leaves you wanting more."
"The taste is subtle and balanced with light malts, green apple, pear and tangerine, a hint of mustiness and spice. A moderately dry finish that is crisp and smooth due to the very active carbonation. ABV% is so well hidden that it's more in the nose than in the taste."
"Overall, a nice rep of the style. Not my favorite perhaps but a good beer"
"D-it's a pretty good representation of the style; the creamy head remained for the whole beer and it was just an easy beer to drink"
"D - Tasty beer."
"The taste has a yeasty efforvescence and a slight pricklish mouthfeel, but not overly so. There is plenty of carbonation as the cork is ready to shoot across the room. The candied sugars, the Belgian florals, and the slight coriander and orange peel, star anise flavors are present. There is a nice pineappley flavor and enough spice and ABV to keep things honest. The beer is relatively complex, although not extensively so, with plenty of candied flavors throughout. Not much lacing going on and the aftertaste is fairly slight. The beer hides its 9% ABV quite well."
"2.5 D: This beer wasn't executed well, but maybe Local 2 will be better."
"Overall? Another great beer from Brooklyn. It's frightening how good Garrett Oliver and his team are at making amazing ales and lagers. Goes down crisp and clean but with a classic Belgian character."
"Overall, Brooklyn Local 1 is a fine beer, whether you want to call it a BSPA or a saison. I'll go with the latter because that's what the brewer prefers. In that light, it's a very tasty brew and an extremely authentic reproduction of a delicious Belgian style. I would definitely drink this again and would gladly recommend it."
"I was hoping for something closer to saison in style, but there's no denying the quality on show here!"
"Notes: Not exactly what one would expect for the style, but it is a rather well crafted concoction. The central European feel to the backbone with the Belgium yeast is unusual but is equally stimulating. Not a fav but also makes for a good quality social brew with great presentation."
"D: Alcohol is fairly prominent, but that is to be expected for a beer twice the ABV of an average beer. Good drinkability simply based on the style. Not a session beer, obviously, but an excellent interpretation of a Belgian strong ale, by an American brewery. Kudos to Brooklyn brewery."
"Pours a faded opaque orange color with a thin head. Despite the thin head, viscous lacing shows its legs. Subtle aroma of citrus, malt and coriander. The citrus and coriander follow through in the taste, but not to the point that they overpower. Not too sweet and a kiss of hops on the palate. This is an excellent American Belgian style ale, the best I've had, Brooklyn got it right. Despite the high alcohol content, it's hidden quite well making this dangerously drinkable. Delicious."
"Drinkability: Other than the smell, which I just didn't get, this was an awesome beer. Zach and I split the bottle, but I think I could've easily polished one off on my own. Would love to try this again!"
"D: A great sipping brew that impressively masks a sneaky 9.0 abv very well..."
"D - Good drinkability. the high abv is always a detractor but this beer's body and hop-yeast balance make it very drinkable. The best belgian pale I've come across after Duvel."
"Mouthfeel was good, nice and lively. But finish was a touch hot. Overall, this was nice but not a premier example of the style."
"D - Extremely drinkable. One of my favorite SBPAs."
"D - Very nice. abv is high up there, so this isn't exactly a session beer, but it is light-bodied overall and would go well with a good meal."
"Yeasty taste to it. Very sweet, belgian beer. Very strong alcohol taste to it, as well. Too sweet for my likes, but it's high quality."
"This is a great beer. The buzz factor sneaks up on you doing it's best to justify the price. I will get this again."
"Drinkability: truely perfect in this sense. An all season style beer for me, and able to be paired with both light and dark meats and dishes. Exactly what I am looking for in a belgian golden ale."
"D: Too strong on the alcohol to drink much by itself, but pair well with equally strong food. Followed the label and had with spicy seafood, a great marriage."
"D- I just don't understand this one, it drinks like the abv is way higher than 9%. I just can't get passed the medicinal booziness qualities, they just don't work well with everything else. I expected more out of this one."
"Cheers!"
"D- very smooth drinking 9% very little alcohol is detectable and doesn't show it's face until near room temp. I'd pick this up again and would likely pick it up over any imported Belgian Strong Pale"
"Very nice beer, although it did not necessarily live up to the pomp I gave it. Reminded me alot of a Farm Ale, the alcohol was hidden nicely in the hops and malts. Somewhat cloudy pour, we drank it at the Navy Club in Seoul in some wine glasses which seemed to suit the packaging. It did lace to the glasses and did seem to satisfy the beer snob in us as a hale beer well met. Will try again but maybe not with such anticipation."
"A very drinkable ale. Very effervescent and quaffable with hardly any alcohol burn."
"D-this is quite tasty and easy to drink. The alcohol is hardly noticeable and the beer is pretty big in terms of flavor. Pretty straight forward offering but quite tasty."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. I would say that it rivals any of the best Belgian Pale Ales and it is nice coming from an American brewery. I am not sure how much I will be picking this beer up as this is not one of my favorite styles...but regardless this is one of the best examples of this style that I have had. Give it a shot regardless, but especially if you like Belgian Pales."
"D-this is a huge beer that is certanly meant to be enjoyed so while its delicious it isnt really a session beer"
"Drinkability is pretty incredible, a long time brew that I've touted as one of the best beers in the last couple years. Only 9 bucks at the local Giant Eagle Market District, you can't beat that grab a bottle and split it with some friends."
"Edit: reading the notes on this it says ""it was classified as a Strong Saison by G.Oliver"". I can only say i completely agree."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"750 ml? no problem. ABV/serving size is the only thing holding the drinkability score back a notch."
"The feel of this beer is nice and crisp and has a good amount of carbonation. It is pretty easy drinking and goes down quite well."
"1225"
"D - Overall, the high carbonation makes it more a sipping beer for me, and with the 9% abv, one bomber is enough for me at one time. Pairs excellent with some dark chocolate covered strawberries. I will definitely be coming back for more of this one."
"Drinkability: A beer that I often pass up, but for $7-8 at the local Whole Foods, this will be in regular rotation in the future."
"Drinks well at 9%-though definitely not a gulper."
"Pours a very hazy pale yellow with some sediment visible in the glass. Lots and lots of head, forcing me to wait untill it dies down before I can take a taste. As I wait, the head dies down, there is tremendous thick lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very fruity, almost smelling like cinnamon applesauce. The taste is very boozy with a slightly bitter yeasty taste. Too strong to be anything but a sipper, not really an exceptional beer, and I probably won't get it again."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is quite tingly, which is typical to style but it is followed with a smooth and rich flavor. This is a sipper but a good drinker for the style."
"not one that ages well or nicely."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger thick creamy white head, with some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice spice note. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, yeasty, bitter, spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice brew."
"Drinkability- Drinkable, but overall not aesthetically pleasing. The complexity of this beer is lacking, the aesthetic quality of this beer is lacking, and most importantly the yeast is non-present. I enjoy what Brooklyn has done with this beer but I don't feel all the pieces of this style fit together as they could."
"It wasn't hard at all to finish, but not stellar."
"Looking forward to more of this - it's a stellar beer."
"Pours a hazy, maize/golden color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, alcohol, tart malt, slight sweet malt, slight honey, hops, slight citrus, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of hops, tart malt, yeast, citrus (lemon/pear?), slight alcohol, and sweet malt. Overall, alcohol really well hidden, good aroma, great body, blend, and complexity."
"Overall a wonderful beer and one certainly worth having if the opportunity arises."
"Drinkability: A very good beer that tastes like a dry white wine. I could have a couple of glasses. I was surprised by the funk. This will not be the first drink I look for but would have it again."
"M, D- A disappointing lack of substance, this brew comes across as thin and light. It is not thoroughly unpleasant, but it is not inspiring, and I don't consider it to be successful enough to drink again given the many other fine options available."
"D-Some of the flavors here were just weird. However, the beer is challenging in a very good way."
"Aroma is nice and bready. Taste is big, chunky, and somewhat sweet. Lots of yeast and malt, perhaps a hint of mango and a little spice. Mouthfeel is full and warm with alcohol. Overall, a very nice, classic-tasting Belgian ale. Quite good."
"D: Although this can be (according to the bottle) either an aperitif or served with food, to my mind this really works better with food, especially something spicy or peppery, as the peppery quality of the beer is quite strong."
"the mouthfeel is great and carbonation is perfect for the style. The bottle whole went down quickly and without a fight. A real solid beer."
"D - very flavorful and easy to drink"
"D: Can easily finish the whole bomber, but not much more."
"About three inches of whipped egg whites for a head sitting above a quite cloudy golden brew. All kinds of scents emanating. Clove, banana, bubblegum, pepper, and touches of citrus. You can really smell the Belgian yeast. Lots of spicy pepper in the taste. Yeasty citrus and some clove, but the taste seems a bit conservative when compared with the smell. The carbonation was a bit over the top and lent itself to the peppery sensation on the tongue. I agree with some other reviewers about the medicinal finish. You can really taste the alcohol. This wasn't up to the expectations I had for it, but it was still pretty good. I also found it better after it warmed a bit."
"It's not a beer I'll drink every day, but I'll get another bottle just to share it with friends."
"Impression: I keep trying Brooklyn because of the high ratings of many beers, perhaps no longer. I do not recommend this beer."
"D: I like this beer, but a bigger yeast component in both the aroma (to make it more inviting) and in the flavor (to give a more nutty smoothness rather than all the sharp phenolic, peppery qualities) would enhance this beer a lot. Maybe filtering changes to allow more yeast character are what's needed, but this beer, while beautiful, is just too sharp and and incohesive."
"Drink ability was good. Semi session able, especially for the high abv. Not my favorite in this style but still pretty good"
"Overall pleasant, but not perfect. It's difficult to review American beers in this style because it forces direct comparison to some of the best beers on the planet. It doesn't exactly match up against those but it's still enjoyable enough that I'll be in search of more Brooklyn offerings shortly."
"OVERALL a sipper for sure. But this a very well made and deliciously drinkable beer. Grateful to have had the chance."
"D: Interesting, but tasted a lot like Tripel Ale's I've had before. I was hoping for an Allagash Tripel Reserve like taste, but was left feeling like I had an average Belgian wit - nothing wrong with that just saying it wasn't what I expected."
"d - very light beer for the high abv (9%), could probably have 1 or 2 of these on a hot summer day"
"D - As usual, for the style, it's a very drinkable beer. The warm alcohol hits you after a while but it goes down nicely. A real treat for all the senses that I wish I had another bottle of. Thanks again to Onenote81 for this bottle!"
"Overall I could drink this beer anytime anyday. Great example of the style. I love when an american brewer makes me forget where the beer came from. Thanks again Andy."
"Drinkability is pretty good if you want to get a bit buzzed like I did from a whole bottle. This would be a very nice bottle for 3 people to drink with some fish and a piece of fruit pie."
"yet another beer that leaves me confused. listed as a BSPA yet defined as a strong saison by the brewer, and I can't help think triple, a world class triple for that matter. oh well I can stay confused with glee as long as I have one of these bad boys in front of me"
"This beer does a great job of both presenting an alluring package and delivering a high quality beer. The head of this corked beer is almost over the top. However, once it settles the foam is exceptional. It clings to the glass and allows the smells to be appreciated. The beer itself is very drinkable. Usually these high alcohol beers offer more sweetness than I like. That is not the case with this beer. I highly recommend the Local No 1."
"Overall- not bad, but I have had better Belgians."
"I'll finish the entire 750 tonight myself. I think it could be easily done by most, but this is also a great beer to share with a couple people. Worth the try."
"A decent, grapefruit skin color with a 2 finger head and moderate retention. Scents of red pear, cane sugar, and spices. A little touch of banana, but the citrus and spices take over, with some solid carbonation throughout and very nice, semi-complex flavors in the mouth. Balance is this beer's strong suit, but it does it by thinning out the beer more than is necessary. Delivers less in the mouth than on the nose."
"D: Again, for the amount of alcohol, this is very drinkable. I took this down a little too easily, and definitely was feeling a bit buzzed afterwards."
"Simply superb."
"Local 1 is a somewhat disappointing effort from Brooklyn Brewing. It's okay, but isn't a great example of a BSPA. The nose is weak and uninspired, there's not enough Belgian yeast, and the alcohol presence is a little too strong. I don't know if Brooklyn ever intends to release this again, but it needs work in the event that they do. It's definitely worth a try. But, for the price, there are many better BSPA choices out there."
"A corked 750ml bottle from the first batch. Poured into my Selin's Grove wine glass. 1 appears a cloudy pale golden color with about an inch of lingering, tightly packed bone white foam. The head leaves a nice lacing in its wake. A very nice looking pour indeed. Nose and flavors consist of green grapes, pears, spicy Belgian yeast, rather sweet and fruity, tropical fruits, a bit earthy and grassy. Lively carbonation at first, but that tones down quite a bit as the beer sits. The body is fulfilling and a bit slick with very little alcohol burn. This ale just keeps getting better as it breathes and warms up. Take your time with this one."
"Medium body and good carbonation. OVerall, good but not great. The initial aroma was amazing and had me excited but the taste just didn't deliver after my expectations had gone up. This still made a good sipper and I'm glad I tried it, but not something I'll be likely to buy again."
"D-Remarkably drinkable...bring this on again and again. 9% AVB....Really now..."
"Added Bonus: Goes great with homemade apple pie, it really subdues the citrus and brings out the yeast and tart sweetness."
"d: for me this was a slow sipper. the bottle (3 snifter glasses worth) took most of the evening, but was a pleasant change from the session beers I have been consuming as of late."
"Drinkability: Yes please. A great first stab at a Belgian-style brew by Brooklyn, always a brewery towing the traditional line, and this one doesn't stray far from what I'd expect or hope. A little more ""malty"" than I would perhaps like my Belgian strong pales to be - or expect them to be, w/ my frame of reference being the quintessential Duvel - this was nonetheless a remarkably crafted brew, subtle, delicate, well-balanced, and enjoyable in all its aspects. At 9%, you have to be wary of drinkability, especially w/ a 750 mL bottle - what, this isn't supposed to be a one-person show? I nonetheless made short work of it, which is in and of itself a testament to the quality of this brew. Fine work, Mr. Oliver - please keep it up."
"Pours light yellow , cloudy, supporting a long lasting fluffy looking near white head. Leaves nice looking splotchy/spotty and ringed lacing. Nice looking beer. Bright, fresh smelling. Notes of more lime, pepper, yeast, grassy, smells so good, time to dive in for a swig. More lime, Belgiany yeast, peppery spice, gin, honey, melon, soap, yum, sucker for the style and this one has got it going on. Fine creation from Brooklyn."
"Drinkability is about average for me. The flavor starts out good, but the beer is a bit of an alcohol bomb and finishes a little sour. I like plenty of beers with high ABV's (WWS, many RIS's and barleywines), but this one just doesn't fit very well. The ABV isn't hidden, nor does it compliment the beer very well. Overall, I think it's still a pretty good brew, but not one I would probably pick up again."
"Kudos to Brooklyn Brewery for this offering. I'd have liked a little less carbonation, otherwise it's up there with my standards."
"All-day. I would happily drink this all day."
"T:"
"Very nice Belgian style ale. Delicious."
"Finishes dry and crisp for an immensely drinkable Belgian-style strong ale. I would describe this as a hybrid between a saison and Belgian golden ale. Whatever category it falls into, it's pretty damn tasty."
"D: A nice beer, one bottle is enough per evening, well balanced and tasted great."
"I wanted to like this more. But I can't quite tell what it was missing, or what about it I that I didn't love. I can't tell if it's meant to be a typical Belgian strong ale or is just influenced by the style. Maybe the confusion lead to my slight disappointment. But it's all relative, this is still a finely crafted beer in the grand scheme of beers."
"Other than the mouthfeel, this is almost a perfect beer."
"d: pretty tough to drink not as crisp as I was expecting. the beer is good, but not something I can drink a lot of"
"D: A very different beer, good flavors and mouthfeel. Glad to have tried this one."
"I recommend. Not my first BSPA but certainly demonstrates the diversity of this style."
"Mouthfeel: Highly highly carbonated. Just too much. The beer does settle down after a while. I would recommend letting the beer sit for about 20 minutes before you pick it up."
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass. The beer is light yellow and cloudy. Nice white head, thick at first but falls back, remains as a thin head that nearly covers the top of the glass. Carbonation is steady and small. Aroma is good, yeasty and sweet. A very attractive beer. Taste is a little bitter, surprisingly. It is sweet and a little dry as well. There is yeast character in the beer but it is very drinkable. Overall a good beer. highly recommend it."
"Verdict: To be perfectly frank, after sampling a few of Brooklyn's more mainstream beers, I was starting to wonder what all the fuss was about. But after a bottle of Local 1, I wonder no more. This is, without a doubt, one of the very best Belgian-style American beers I've tried yet."
"Pours a partially clowdy straw yellow, slightly orange color. Straight out the bottle has a huge white head that dissolves back into a thin film across the top of the beverage. Leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Nose has a bit of yeast and slight citrus aroma, picking up some other spices on the backend as well. Taste has a pleasant malty sweetness and citrus followed by the yeast and minimal bitterness. Has a warming finish as expected with the 9 abv along with some slight hop bitterness. Very easy drinking and the high carbination makes this one have quite a lighter mouthfeel."
"I think that this beer is good for what the brewer intended, but the yeast strain used is much to clovey for my liking."
"Quite drinkable - whether you consider it a BSPA or Saison, it's just a really nice beer, that I would gladly drop some coin on a case of."
"D-I felt like drinking a whole bottle of this, but I knew that would not go well so I didn't."
"Drinkability: I'm really enjoying it, but I do wish the hops were a bit more subdued and the fruitiness had more of a presence. Beyond that, it's a very solid offering from Brooklyn and I'm glad I finally drank this one. I'm sure there will be more of this purchased in the future."
"Drinkability- This is a beautiful beer, delicate and beautifully balanced that goes down with ease. I drank the first glass by itself and the second pour I had with a seasoned, roasted chicken. It was nice on its own but absolutely sensational with the chicken. Definitely one to have with a nice meal particularly lighter fare."
"Overall I was again very impressed with a Belgian offering from Brooklyn. I don't think this neatly falls into any category but it remains well worth a shot."
"Notes: Overall good appearance, flavor and a fun lively palate make this an enjoyable beverage."
"This is an excellent beer that covers up the ABV until the tail end."
"-not bad for a 9% as soon as it filters through your mouth, you want more"
"this beer is beyond drinkable. While it's not my absolute favorite, I definitely enjoy it and could drink tons of the stuff... especially if it weren't 9% abv."
"They advertise this beer being like a duvel, belgian strong pale ale but it's really not as good. However, when not compared to the sacred duvel, this is a pretty good beer that should perhaps be in other size bottles beside the 750 ml size. Would recommend with caution."
"Fantastic! This is a really got beer in the Belgian strong pale ale variety. Trippel fans will also like it. Holds up very well against anything truly from Belgium and I will look for it again."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is star anise, coriander, cloves, and a mild yeasty funk. It is fragrant, and rather complex. But there is something about it, probably the plethora of anise, that just doesn't click with me. The taste is more funky than the aroma, with the anise more subdued. The coriander and clove are strong. I like this beer's flavor a little more than the aroma, but it still seems odd for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It is not bad just odd. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a smooth texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, I can tell you if a beer is crafted with quality, and if I like. But, sometimes they aren't the same answer. This beer was most certainly crafted with quality, and I'm sure there are many people out there who would thoroughly enjoy it. However, I do not. That is not to say that I dislike it, I just dislike this interpretation of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"Had this a while back but took notes. Poured a pal golden color with foamy white head that faded somewhat slowly and left good lacing. Smelled of malt, yeast, fruit, and spices. Tasted of fruit, spice, yeast, light hops, and malt. Smooth, but slightly overcarbed and left the tongue with a slightly bitter feeling. I definitely enjoyed the big bottle."
"Three fingers of gorgeous white, frothy head. A hazy, light golden hue is really inviting. Wonderful retention and some fluffy lacing on the tulip. Aromas are heavy in an amalgamation of ripe fruits. Flavors are wheat and spice, and incredibly fruity. A medium body and crisp mouthfeel add to the wonders of this refreshing beer. I really look forward to drinking a bottle of this one again."
"Pours a nice pretty golden with just a touch of haze and tons of very tight, very fine foam. Nose is a nice piny, citrusy, spicy Belgian character--a generally Belgian aroma but definitely a bit of that dryish, bready German essence. Mouthfeel is very light for the 9% abv, and there's also a robust, scrubbing-bubbles type of carbonation. Taste is definitely something different--slight citrus spiciness with a distinct dry bite. Hard to put my finger on what else is in there, but I suspect it's the German and Belgian elements mingling. Very cool beer and a great substitute for a dry white wine with dinner. I really liked this one!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with a tall head that hangs around for a while and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds me of a witbier - banana, clove, spice, and citrus. The flavor is very nice. Has a very nice spice character to go along with the citrus and clove flavors. Yeasty flavors are nice. The body is medium and it is quite refreshing at 9%. Nice brew."
"Drinkability: Man. I really wanted to like this more. Its fine, I guess. Interesting, and I'm glad I had it. I hate to pan something from a brewery that I really like when they branch out to do something new but its just nowhere near as good as many other BSPAs. Its also not cheap. At all. Nine bucks for my 750. You can buy a 4 pack of Pranqster from North Coast for that which is better in my opinion. Overall, a solid attempt from the guys at Brooklyn which is good, but falls a little short. I hope to try the Local 2 soon (I guess I already tried it at a beer festival, but I don't ""remember"" it for some reason)."
"Effervescent yet controlled with a perfect body. The alcohol is only slightly detectable and it's dastardly drinkable for a Belgian strong. Worth the wait."
"Overall: I think this beer would be an excellent beer to serve to all your wine drinking friends. In fact I think it's very similar to a dry white wine. A good beer to serve with salad or a nice cheese plate."
"Fantastic, a gem, a treasure and a summer session belgian at 9.0%? You can do the math-!"
"5 oz pour at the Flying Saucer Tri-Beer tasting served in a tulip glass a crisp straw yellow with a decent head that diminished to a thin layer. Aroma is slight sweet fruits with citrus and spice. The taste is sweet fruits and citrus malts with loads of spice in the finish. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable, refreshing beer."
"D- Ok at best I think I don't see me coming back to this one."
"I picked this up after ACBF because of the love it recieved by most of the BA people around the booth and I had not gotten a chance to try it. I was not dissapointed in the least. The Beer had a good body to it. Very Fruity smell and taste. the after taste was excellent as well. This is a great beer for sitting on a porch on a warm summer eavning. I will definitly be picking it up again."
"Strong, but the alcohol is somewhat difficult to detect until after you swallow the beer. Refreshing, complex enough to keep me coming back to the bottle. Lack of clarity likely has to do with the ""bottle fermentation"" it boasts, but the same is responsible for all these yeasty notes so I certainly won't complain of that overmuch."
"A very light peach/straw yellow color. Billowing white head. Beautiful to look at and really have not seen anything else that looks like it. Great carbonation as well. I want to try bottle fermentation. So much going on when it hits your lips. Starts a lot like any Belgian and then picks up with some very sweet, almost tart flavors. Strong. A little on the heavy side, but still very smooth to was down nicely. Very easy to drink but after a couple of these 750mL bottles should be well on my way. Another goodie from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"D: Rather drinkable. I didn't find alcohol to be too up-front or offensive like some other reviewers did. A clean, well-brewed and enjoyable beer that I'd definitely buy again to both cellar and enjoy immediately."
"D: Very good beer and easy to drink. Be careful, because at 9%, it's a little too easy to drink."
"From a brewery notable 750 ml bottle, this beer is a cloudy, golden color with a tall, firm, and very stable white head. The brew has a a peppery, spicy, Belgian aroma. Lots of Belgian yeast and spice character. There's a nice pale malt backdrop, followed by a little alcohol and fresh fruit (under-ripe pear). The taste is semi-sweet, with yeast, malt, and musty hop characteristics. The beer is a little spritzy in the front, but it quiets down by the finish. There's a notable warming in the taste. This one is engaging and well done."
"Pours a gold color with a huge fluffy white head. Lots of carbonation in the glass. A nice belgian yeast, bready, clove, spice, fuity aroma. A strong belgian ale flavor with some peppery spice, clove, warm alcohol, and fruit flavors. As the beer warmed up a little the peppery, earthy hop flavors really popped out. Very nice mix of belgian with the hops. Good mouthfeel an nice high carbonation to give the beer a prickly spice. I really liked this beer, I could drink it in large quantities."
"I'm not a fan of this style of beer, its safe to say I'm not enjoying it. although I can appreciate it for following the style well and rate it accordingly. If I never had this again, I would not be upset."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. I could drink a few of these a night"
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Not as clear as I thought it would be for this style, but the smell and taste were very full and wonderful. Recommend."
"750 ml brown bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket. Hazy golden color with an inch of off white head that holds very well with a bit of lacing on the glass. smells spicy and orange peel. The spiciness, orange peel, and the pithy quality is very prominent. Light/moderate mouth feel. very drinkable goes down smoothly. very well made beer."
"It pours a honey-shaded cloudy gold with no head but a touch of lacing. Intriguing. The smell is sugar and flowers. I think those may be two of the ingredients for little girls. The taste is hops, sugar, apricots, pine nuts and a great balance. What's not to like? The mouthfeel is chewy and slick. It is quite drinkable, very balanced and doesn't affront you like some 9% beers can. All aboard, this Texas boy says!"
"A decent if slightly boring Belgian from Brooklyn. Local 1 is a very good beer and I have few complaints about it. However, it was made in a Belgian style and must be reviewed against its style, which happens to include some of the best beers in the world. The flavor and aroma have a nice but fairly generic spice character of black pepper and clove. The yeast is earthy but not spectacularly so. There are some sweet fruits in the mix. The feel is smooth with fine, relatively gentle bubbles. The alcohol is well-hidden. I have heard (maybe from marketing materials) this beer compared to a saison, and I'm going to disagree with that characterization. It's just a generic BSPA that has neither big flaws nor big character."
"M - Effervescent and refreshing, but there is definitely a solid alcohol presence."
"Drinkable? I finished the full bottle in one sitting, but not without some effort - this is a hearty brew meant to be taken seriously. Enjoy."
"Drinkability - This level of spiciness may overwhelm some over the course of a few drinks but it worked well enough for me."
"This is such a well rounded, full, delicious beer. Pretty much as delicious as it gets."
"A solid brew - worth checking out."
"D - This was a good beer in my opinion, something good to buy to pass along to the buddies"
"Absolutely spectacular."
" Garrett and the other guys at Brooklyn."
"Got this as a gift for my birthday back in March and decided it was time to crack it open. Pours a huge, white head that stays around for a while. The aroma is of sweet malts, yeast, bubble gum and just a bit of spice. Taste starts off with strong banana, honey, yeast and finishes with a nice spicy bitterness that is really good. It is a bit sweet but with the finish it doesn't really overwhelm. I really enjoyed this one. Can't wait to try the Local 2."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Pours hazy gold with a large white head that recedes to leave a nice cap. No sediment. Smells quite spicy with notes of pepper and coriander. Overall sweet, fruity character with quite a bit of orange. Tastes of mineral are surprisingly strong, though quickly overcome by peppery spice. Lightly sweet and tangy with a bit of an alcohol presence. Dry finish that's quite warming. Highly carbonated. A bit too intense to be very drinkable."
"D: Has a high ABV, and the 750 mL bottle would be good for a night."
"D- i thought it decent. didnt compare to some other belgian pale ales like the delirium tremens but deff worth a try."
"d - surprised to see that it's 9% after drinking it. Very good for the style, which is not my favorite."
"D - Pretty drinkable, a lot of flavors going on here. That lingering bitterness is not pleasant however. That is the only thing that would prevent me from drinking a ton of this."
"So, well, uh... is this a saison? A big, sweet, burning one, yes. I'd have preferred less alcohol, more delicacy. But, I'm glad to have had this beer. It would be great with a long, slow, fine meal; perhaps prime rib, or veal. This is a beer that could put the meal on its shoulders and walk with it for a while, whistling..."
"D - Crisp and dry makes it a pretty drinkable beer. The carbonation and alcohol make it more of a sipper than guzzler though."
"I could drink this by myself without problem, something I will definitely try again."
"Good example of style, but not one I would seek out again."
"Drinkability- Crisp and light flavors make for a well-balanced, easily drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a wonderful bear, but at 9% ABV, boy I wish it came in smaller bottles."
"This is a good one to open at a byob."
"D- I'm enjoying it, and like I said, I can easily imagine having a distinct craving for this, because it is fairly unusual, but at the same time, I think one glass will be plenty for now."
"D: Tasty and flavorful, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good beer to either pound for while or sip for long time."
"I think this is the first beer from Brooklyn BC that I've been impressed with. Their other beers were fermented too hot and I didn't like them at all, but this one was obviously handled with care and it shows. This can hold it's own next to other standout BSPA's. Recommended."
"Loud pop from the cork, and I poured it into my standard tasting pint. Bad Move... Very hard to pour, im sorry if I sound naive, but its a difficult beer to control into a pint glass. As i let the head settle, I noticed pear, grains, and wheat wafting out out of the terribly poured head. The color is lighter and hazier than I expected, but at this point I am still hopeful that that this beer lived up to the ten dollars I spent at the brewery for it. I taste pear and plum very distinctly and im underwhelmed by anything else in this beer. A bit too watery by my standards to be considered great. In fact, i dont really like this beer... I was saving it for a special occasion, now i opened it, and I am left with a yellow plum beer that lacks depth. Try it for yourself."
"This beer hits some things really well, but misses the beat a couple of times. I think the mustiness overrides the other flavors. It's just not as complex as others. Like a really good beer just trying to struggle past the last few hurdles."
"Overall: A solid brew. Light and refreshing. The beer is very balanced with no one flavor overpowering the other. For 9%abv the alcohol is very well hidden."
"D - Good, no issues with the alcohol, nor do any of the flavors get in the way of each other or cause any issues with enjoying a few of these at a time."
"Feel and Drinkability: On the palate this one is medium-light bodied with low-moderate levels of carbonation. Alcohol warmth adds to feel, giving the beer some overall heft. Finish is slightly dry, hop flavor and bitterness coming thorugh at the end to mingle with alcohol and creating an overall drying effect on the back of the tongue whilst sweetness still plays on the front and sides of the tongue until my watering mouth carries it away, around the center of dryness. This is one that I'll enjoy drinking the rest of, but as afore mentioned am not all that excited about....its a great beer, but for me it just doesn't make me rave."
"Notes: I can imagine having this alone or at the dinner table."
"The taste is better, similar to other good strong pale ales, is reminiscent of some of the belgians producers of this style in general. The mouthfeel is fairly light, some sweetness, with a tang of the strongness of this style thrown into the mix. Drinkability is good...I like this beer quite a bit, and for $9, I am quite happy."
"The pour was average, but the head 1 finger at best dissapated quickly. There was some impressive bubble dancing to the top after each poor though, and the golden wheat color was on par with others of this style. It was the smell and the taste that left something to be desired however. It seems as though there is little going on besides the alchol. The burn seems to linger inapropriately for a 9.00 abv beer and is way to present in the nose. None of the subtiltle fruit tones I get in a Duvel. I gave the drinkability a 2.5 due to the bordem induced after more than one poor and the lack of complexity. This beer was worth trying, but not something I'd seek again."
"Belgian strong ale indeed... the heat in this one totally threw me for a loop and was all in all very unpleasant. Even let this one sit overnight in the fridge, and despite extra air time and cooled state, all I could get was alcohol in the finish. Not my cup of tea, which is a bummer as I was really looking forward to this."
"Overall, a very nice brew. Another quality brew from Brooklyn."
"The body was moderate. Some warming from the alcohol. The carbonation was high even for style. Overall some really strange off notes and limited malt and Belgian character really leaves me wanting more. Not exactly a drain pour but close."
"750ml corked & caged bottle served in my New Belgium Globe Glass. Batch 3028 indicated on the back label. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a torrent of tiny bubbles effervescing from the nucleation point in the well of the bowl. Three inch bright white head sizzled and popped as it slowly dissipated leaving behind cloud-like formations of lacing in its wake. Nose suggests coriander, belgian yeast, candi sugar and perhaps a hint of anise, some light fruity esters and a kiss of booze at the back. Taste follows nose on this one - great complexity. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied; tingly carbonation with no burn, a little bit of tartness at the finish. By far one of my favorite belgian strong pale ales - easy drinking, accessible and reasonable priced. Another top notch brew from Brooklyn."
"smooth, with faint resins in the finish. moderate yet slightly prickly carbonation is fluffy. later pours with yeast haze are actually creamy."
"Even laying its awesome bottle aside, this is an beautiful looking beer. I poured it as gently as possible into a white wine glass and had barely filled it one third of the way up with liquid before the foam shot up and filled and the other two thirds. It is a very clear gold with several jets of fine carbonation bubbles jetting up to join the foam. Smell is remiscent of a Saison. Strong notes of sour apple, freshy fruity ethers, and a bit of yeast. The warm alcohol vapors were strong enough on the palate to make my ears pop. What I said about the aromas applies doubly to the taste except that its sweeter than the nose suggested and is also slightly spicy. This is a good beer but not better than its main Belgian predecessors."
"D - Local 1 is practically chuggable. The alcohol is completely hidden amongst a myriad of flavors. I'm usually not a fan of the big bottles when it comes to styles like this but every sip of this has been a delight. Certainly the best I've had of the style and easily in the ranks with my top 10 favorite beers. Love it."
"D- Amazingly drinkable, especially given the ABV of 9%."
"M - Medium bodied, high carbonation."
"Drinkability - It was a nice complex beer that I felt fit the style nicely I would certainly drink it again."
"Honey colored and slightly hazy poured into a wine glass. Head dissipates quickly into tight lacing. Hints of honey and apricots in both the smell and taste. Slightly biscuity and yet enough astringency from the alcohol to clean and not strip the palate. Very well balanced and well described by the brewer as a strong saison."
"mouthfeel was crisp and the drinkability is no suprise that it's high. This brew is damn tasty. I might have to go stock up on a few more"
"Drinkability: very, very drinkable. This would go very well chilled on a hot day or slightly warmer in the winter. As it warmed up, some characteristics started coming out: spices and such, but not over the top. Also, the alcohol became more apparent."
"Pours a transparent golden yellow/orange color with a medium sized white head that dies down to a sturdy 1/4 in net across the top of the brew. Sweet nose, apricot, peach, biscuit-like yeast and quality pale malt. Fruity more than anything, i remember this beer being much more like a Belgian style Golden Ale or Tripel, more like a Corsendonk Abbey Pale, this definitely reminds me more of a Belgian style pale ale, sweeter, fruity and definitely more ""American"" in nature. Great drinkability all the same, would go excellent with food."
"D - Upon first trying this beer- I thought to myself ""this is a well made beer"" I echo that thought here."
"A very nice spin on a strong Belgian pale, with a few saison characteristics, as Mr. Oliver noted. I must say, having previously met Oliver at a festival that featured this beer, it is better in larger than sample quantities and warmer than an iced bottle. I was not a huge fan of it when I had it at that festival, but felt an urge to review it ahead of the release of Local #2."
"M&d: chewy syruoy mouth, slightly drying. Over all very nice."
"D: Very drinkable for 9% abv. I do not think the 750ml is going to be enough! I should have gotten more when I had the chance. Refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy, grapefruit color, with a deep and dense off-white head that slowly fades and leaves a thin lace all around. The aroma is a bit more subdued than expected, but some light fruits (pomegranate and pineapple), yeast, a bit of brettanomyces, and some slight phenols exist. The taste is a bit more bold and complex, with some more light fruits (including sour apples), yeast, spice, sugar and butterscotch. It goes down fairly silky and a bit dry, with a medium to heavy mouth-feel. The alcohol is well hidden, and it's quite drinkable despite it's 11.0%."
"D: At 9% ABV this is a beer to be shared for sure. Mostly because a person could certainly drink the whole bottle on their own. I've had this beer a few times now and it pairs incredibly well with roast chicken and curry dishes. Truly a great beer and I can't wait for Local 2."
"Not my favorite style but this is a good example of bspa."
"Brooklyn Brewery rarely disappoints with respect to flavor, and Local 1 is no exception. Crisp, never-astringent hop bitterness dances across the palate, balancing perfectly with a sweet crystal malt and white sugar note. Could stand to have a bit more complexity in the yeast department, but still a fantastic-tasting brew. The body is well-carbonated and lively on the tongue, while the hops kick in to add a nice bitter bite to the finish. Somewhat slick, smooth body with a medium consistency. Looking forward to the rest of my bottle, but at $8.99 for 500 ml, I might opt for a cheaper Belgian Pale if given the choice."
"The flavor is where this beer falters...fizzy mouthfeel is good, some bubble gum Belgian fruity notes but then a dry lingering bitterness and alcohol heat that are disruptive and ultimately overwhelming. As I drink I detect some tea-like flavors, looking for complexity and interest, but any complexity is overtaken by ashy dry bitterness. It isn't even a pleasant hoppy bitterness. The nose of this brew is so promising that the failures of its flavors are all the more disappointing. Not bad, but doesn't get anywhere near its potential."
"Pours a light yellow color with loads of carbonation. Little head though. Smell is warm and fruity, rather like hay on a warm summer day. Taste is not as sweet as I would imagine, its actually rather bitter and slightly acidic. Fills out palate well, but is nothing special. Overall not a bad beer, not a great belgian but a decent example."
"Would I buy it again? Maybe just one more 750ml :-)"
"D. The only reason this is a 3.0 and not higher is that the strong alcohol aftertaste would likely keep me from drinking more then 2 of these in a row."
"Overall, I had big hopes after the smell, but it didn't pan out."
"Poured a delicious and vibrant peach color with a good bit of carbonation (expected) and a tremendous unfiltered cloudiness. It had a yeast forward scent yet mellowed out quite a bit after breathing. The taste was clean, crisp and smooth with a great lingering finish hitting all the flavors. The most reminiscing flavor was a bit of Apricot and good deep cane sugar. Much enjoyed."
"Drinkability is nice, certainly a beer I would welcome another bottle of down the road, but not one I'm pining for right this instant. Glad I gave this one a second shot."
"Update: Enjoyed my second bomber during the Superbowl and was glad I brought it. Ratings hold up."
"D - This is a standout beer from Brooklyn for me after drinking their average regular line up it has a good taste thats easy to drink worth trying"
"Take a seat. Relax and enjoy this fine quaff; a warm and inviting beer for any brisk fall afternoon."
"This is a quite drinkable beer. Especially given the high abv it could sneak up on you. Enjoyable, but not remarkable for me."
"Without any effort, pouring this into a pint glass produces a luxurious thick white head. It's light golden color looks quite inviting. I smell banana, raisin, and other fruits in the nose. Down the hatch! A delicious smooth malt flavor up front but quickly followed but a hot alcohol bite. It's lightly carbonated, almost playful. A very pleasant and easy to drink beer. With the alcohol bite I think this could do better with a little aging but that will not stop me from buying it again and soon."
"D: Smooth drinking for the ABV."
"D- With the abv it will knock you on your ass but it didnt go down as smoothly for me because i t had too much of a champagne type of taste. Not bad but a lil over the top."
"Seems kind of a dumbed-down tripel. Not as good as the belgian examples."
"The residual sweetness lends heft to this and makes it more of a sipper but it's by no means tough to enjoy. Awesomely crafted."
"on a side note, hell of a bottle. the cork has multiple printings and the glass is done up with the breweries name in the mold."
"Pleasingly glowing cloudiness deepens the amber orange color, thick white foam across the surface, slow to break up, lots of visible carbonation and bubble beads. The nose is big on the citrus with sweet spices and softly fruity, some raw bread dough notes, digs in without ever seeming to. Medium-bodied, has enough weight upfront to cascade from thereafter, the citrus and sweet spices even more prevalent here, the baked character extends to the apple, pear, apricot fruit nuances. No heaviness as it finishes and the alcohol not discernible at all. Lots of flavor residue."
"Overall, this was not super amazing for me, but pleasant."
"First impression: There is a lot going on here. It's slick on the tongue, but the flavor profile isn't quite what I expected. I know it is described as a ""strong saison", but there alcohol profile is overly prevalent to me. That, and it seems ascetic, and a little metallic. I certainly taste the belgian sugars, but the sweetness serves as a background to everything else going on. As it warms, some spices come out, as well as some fruit (apple/pear, maybe.) The earthiness that I expected blends into the hop profile at the end, and the dryness never really manifests itself. I think I would like this more if it make it's alcohol content quite so well known. As it is, the mouthfeel is a little thin, not quite watery, but it feels like something is missing. Overall, the experience isn't quite what I expected. The sourness really doesn't agree with me, and the saison-like qualities are a little lacking. Disorganization is too strong a word, but it just doesn't want to grip me in the right places. The initial mouthful is better, but the lingering on the palate seems to feature what I didn't like about it. I want to chase it with a fresh glug, if that makes sense. Also, the booziness detracts from the overall quality for me, it just doesn't carry it too well, and that detracts from the drinkability. It's not a bad beer, and just might be to complex for my palate to appreciate all of what's going on. I think the fact that it is so different from what I was expecting through me for a loop. Thanks to my man-crush on Garrett Oliver, I when I read ""saison"" from him, my brain went into saison mode. As more of a generic strong pale ale, it might fare a little better."
"D= Wow this is a damn fine ale. I was blown away by the masterful combination of complexity and balance. As Mr. Oliver says, its more of a big saison than anything else. Easy to drink, but big enough to pack a wallop so watch out!"
"This beer is pretty carbonated and finishes very cleanly, leaving the tongue tingling a bit. While the 9% ABV is mostly hidden in the taste, I could feel its effect after just a glass. Still, the delicate nature of the beer made it mostly drinkable, and I easily polished off the bottle. With a pricetag of $8.99, I'd buy this again the next time it comes around."
"This is a fantastic beer. Really good stuff."
"If you like Belgian style ale, BUY THIS!"
"Notes from: 5/17/08"
"I poured this non spectacular expensive beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was cloudy and had an odd yellow brown color to it. The head was nice and the beer had good lacing. It smelled and tasted yeasty with a bit of a fruity aftertaste I did not care for. A complex brew and just not for my uncomplicated mouth. No."
"Despite the vigorous carbonation Local 1 is a smooth ass beer. It's like drinking a cold crisp cider that has some nice tart peppery bites. The only downside for me is the sweetness. It's a little much and paired with a 9% ABV it slightly kills the drinkability for me."
"This bottle is from batch 2977. One of the old bottles with the controversial rings. This stuff ages like a purebred. Smooth and complex like the finest Belgian. A two year old bottle of this will give a Duvel a run for the money."
"Had this one in the cellar for a year and it seems to have dried the beer a little and tightened up the flavours. This is a spicy little number that opens up to some interesting flavours over time. I noticed fruit such as nectarines, pepper, yeast, citrus and hops. Not the most drinkable saison due to the alcohol and the spicy touches on the finish but still another example of Garret's brewing skill"
"this is a drinkable beer its big and delicious"
"D- Highly drinkable. Even at 9% ABV the alcohol is very easy on the palate."
"This is a great beer. Exceptional balance - more so than most true Belgiums in this category. Pours a dark amber/brown with a decent head for a high octane brew. A rich malty brew balance well with a slight bitterness from hops and not too sweet on the plate. Lingers long and the 9% ABV is barely noticeable."
"D- It's an easy drinker considering the strength. While the beer is deceptively strong, the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Pours a pale golden color with a fairly substantial head. Retention is pretty good and there is little lacing. Smell is of mild spice and yeast with a hint of tropical fruit. The taste is similar to that of the aroma with the fruits and spice mixing very well to blend inot a nice smooth finish. This is a nice light brew that drinks very easily and a very solid Belgian-style offering form Brooklyn and is now one of my favorite brews from this company."
"Drinkability- Very nice and I would be happy to find one again (do I have another in the cellar?), I'll be searching it out again in a year or so."
"A delicious & unique mishmash of styles. Very, very tasty."
"perhaps a bit too effervescent and there is that alcohol hit, but overall a delicious 100% bottle-fermented belgian style ale made exceedingly well right here in america."
"D: I thought it was worth the price and quite another one-off terrific brew coming out of Brooklyn."
"**Edit: actually as I finished the bottle I realized it grew on me a bit. Nice spice subtle spice and fruit notes in nose and palate that weren't immediately obvious. Also sediment in the bottom makes it clear it's bottle-conditioned...despite the big fluffy fizzy bubbles."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Well done Brooklyn!"
"(rated Feb 20, 2008)"
"Pours a nice clear golden color with a thick, frothy white head. Fruity aroma of apple, grape, pear as well as a nice spiciness. The strong abv is excellently masked by a refreshing, crisp taste of white fruit and citrus. Slight dry finish. A very nice belgian-inspired tripel."
"Drinkability: This one was definetley a treat, awsome use of fruit, perfect maltiness, and good sessionability, I can easily top of a couple bombs of these a night. Well done."
"There just wasn't a lot going on here, no complexity. Overall, I found this to be indistinct. The 9% ABV was also very apparent."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink."
"Pours a clear golden color body with a big frothy white head, good lacing & lasting Flowery malty banana aroma. Light fruit and sweet spices. Not overpowering. Spicy banana taste. Light malts, watery palate, but carbonated. Some what warming. Nice Belgian-y taste. Super carbonated as it warms, harsh."
"Pours gold with a thick white head. Tastes and smells like a slightly sweeter version of many of the good Balgian pales. A hint of green apple and more than a hint of Citrus (mainly tangerine or oranges). Its drinks very, very smooth with a light-to-moderate mouth. It hides the abv fairly well. Its fairly similar to other Belgian strong pales (Duvel, etc). It seems like many of the Belgian strongs (dark or pale) have really similar characteristics, but this one is particularly enjoyable and really ""easy-going"" too."
"Overall: It seems to me that the ""strong pale ale"" subcategory of Belgian-style ale could be further subdivided into a sub-sub-category of ""devil beer."" This falls squarely within that sub-sub-category, and is at least as good as the Belgian examplars of that style I have sampled. In fact, it lacks some of the cattiness I often detect in, say, Duvel when I buy it locally, but seems to have captured all of that beer's positive categories and then some. This is simply an outstanding brew."
"The abv makes this stuff a one 'n doner, but it's damn good stuff nonetheless. There are times when I'll actually take this over Duvel. Not always, just sometimes. And that's about as high a complement as I can pay this great beer."
"This beer is awesome. It's a great examle of the style and done very well. Seek this beer out if Belgian are you bag."
"M/D: The beer had a medium body, it was smooth, creamy and very easy to drink. Next time I am at the store I will be picking up additional bottles so that I can keep it in stock in the beer fridge. This will be a staple in my fridge for some time."
"Drinkability is good. I've been on a dark Belgian beer kick for a year or so. This might pull from the darkside for a while. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability is fantastic. The alcohol doesn't dominate, and barely makes its presence known. Easy to drink with a great taste, one of the best beers I've had this year."
"This beer pours a clear light gold with a thick, foamy head. Slight lacing is apparent. Aroma is sweet pilsner malts and a dry, chalky yeast flavor. The flavor is dominated by the yeast and spicy alcohol, with a sharp aftertaste. Its slightly dry, but there is a nice sweet malt flavor. The alcohol is definitely present. This is a good beer, but not one that I would sit down for a session."
"Taste was good. Same flavors as in the aroma, but stronger and more pronounced. The orange peel, Belgian yeast and spices were all present but not to the level that some of the original Belgian brews would take them. The alcohol was very well masked. Mouthfeel was good. Went down smooth, felt rich and no offsetting alcohol burn. A very drinkable beer for this octane level. Very nice!!!"
"Fizzy and medium bodied. Heavy, fizzy, perfumey and flowery. Bursting wild estery flavors; no malt base to speak of."
"Not a bad BSPA at all. Though I find it a bit typical. Though it is a very good beer from a good brewery."
"Nice offering from Brooklyn. This is an incredibly creamy, orange, and tasty strong ale of the Belgian influence. Double Saison is a better assessment than Tripel. It is good, I like it more than many beers I've had."
"overall, this beer looks, smells and tastes like a Tripel, although it is not characterized as such on this website or by the brewery, it is a tasty beer although somewhat unremarkable, definitely worth a try."
"Lovely clear golden pour with a big frothy head and solid retention. Carbonation rises slowly to the top of the glass in a very steady stream and there are chunks of lacing down the glass. Smell is nice and inviting. Some honey glazed fruits, a little citrus. Pineapple, pear, peach, and grapefruit. A healthy dose of candy sugar and a definite yeast. Taste attempts to duplicate but is somewhat distracting. Peppery flavors are present along with the fruits. A moderate sweetness from the candy sugar. Alcohol is a tad dominant toward the finish, which takes away from this overall. A pretty solid beer that has some flaws. I managed to finish this bottle myself. While enjoyable at first, it became a little difficult in the end. I'd prefer to split this on the next occasion."
"Drinakbility: It was a nice take on a Belgian style of beer from a great American brewery, but again, my bottle relied too much on the alcohol and yeast to get this beer through the taste. Hopefully not all of the bottles are like this one. After my experience with this bottle, I doubt I would shell out any more money to try this beer again."
"I poured a 750 ml bottle into a tupip glasss. It pours a hazy orange color with a big fluffy white head. The beer leaves a significant amount of lacing. The nose of this beer is of alcohol soaked bread, heavy on the alcohol. The taste is suprisingly fruity. There is a hint of pears, with a phenolic finish. The beer has medium body with moderate carbonation. Despite the 9% alcohol, this is an easy drinking beer. Brooklyn Local 1 is an enjoyable brew."
"In my opinion this is the best offering from Brooklyn Brewery. Hats off to Garrett Oliver."
"The balance and complexity keeps the alcohol hidden. Great American beer."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose. Flavor is sweet and sour honey with sweet but clean finish. High ABV is hidden. $9.45 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Pours a semi-cloudy gold with an amazing two-finger that slowly dies and leaves lots of lace. Fruits galore in the smell, both citric and maybe some dark or tropical. Also some spiciness. Crisp and carbonated, medium-bodied, very smooth. Citric fruits dominated the taste for me, but there is a good helping of spices on the edges and there are nice chunks of malt in there. Finishes a little slick but with a crisp, dry edge. ABV hidden well; a must-try for any beer drinker."
"D - this is a great beer, which isn't a surprise seeing where it comes from. Definitely would recommend to others, and have no issue finish the bottle ;-) Check it out!"
"Disappointing beer, with little of interest."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy with the perfect steady flow of carbonation. This one is really easy to drink and deceptively so for the 9% abv. Goes great with food as well, I had it along with a chipotle chicken sandwich. This one is well worth seeking out and I'll probably be picking up another bottle soon!"
"Poured nicely with strong head, but head faded very quickly. I smelled cloves and honey but not much of the funk that I usually get with belgian style beers. Taste was very good. More of what I smell plus a little bit of taste from the yeast. The high alcohol content is not noticed in the taste, maybe because of the year stored in the cellar. The drinkability on this beer is quite nice. The 750 ml bottle was consumed by just myself nicely during a 2 hour session. Would definetly recommend this beer. My only complaint was the price, as it was a couple dollars more than most beers of this style."
"This brew pours a light golden yellow color with a thinish white head and good lace. It brings a sharp clove and light grapey alcohol aroma. The taste is crisp and clovey, melon and honey, good alcohol presence with lemony hops overtones. Finely carbonated and medium drinkable. Decent for the style."
"Overall a brilliant Belgian variation that is worth the $."
"Pours a cloudy straw/orange with a robust head and good lacing. Nose- spice (coriander, pepper) and honey. Taste- sweet malts and fruits initially, spritzy carbonation on the tongue, then quickly dries out to a peppery and earthy dry finish. Leaves a metallic yeast aftertaste and booze heat."
"Mouthfeel was smooth do to the fairly high carbonation associated with the style. It was not high enough to effect drinkability at all."
"Good stuff."
"D--Highly drinkable--almost too much so. Very fine Belgian hybrid that's almost a cross between Thiriez Blonde and Duvel, and at 9% I think Mr. Oliver should rename it Lucifer the Second, as this puppy starts more fires than it puts out."
"This beer pours a light cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head with no lacing. The smell is of alcohol and orange zest. The taste has hints or orange, caramel and some belgian spices. The mouthfeel is ok, the carbonation was a little high for my taste. Even with the high carbonation this is a very drinkable brew."
"T: Very crisp, dry body, with a medium mouthfeel and strong carbonation and light hop bite. Body is malty and fruity sweet. Undertones like a saison, but much sweeter and spicier. Warming alcohol in the finish. Very good beer, easy drinking and refreshing."
"The feel of Local 1 is stunningly crisp and medium-bodied, and the brew boasts good drinkability considering the potent ABV."
"I definitely think that this gives you the taste of Belgium with a much easier drink than some. A good stepping stone into the other import brews."
"This is a nice brew an easy sipper though will probably pass in the future given the cost and the abundance of good Belgians."
"Brooklyn Local 1 pours a lemon yellow with a white head from a brown 750 ml corked and caged bottle. The aroma is a bit fruity. The flavor is also fruity, at turns pear and lemon both come to mind. A bit of clove, and a bit peppery. Not really a traditional Belgian in flavor, but pretty enjoyable."
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to aerozeppl for the bottle."
"This was recommended to me based on my like for some others in the same sytle. While I was expecting a good beer I wasn't sure how great it would be coming from an American brewer. Well, I'm glad I got it because it was quite good. Sampled from a big 750ml bottle. Pours a somewhat murky peach color with a thick fluffy head. The head does settle just a little but there's still quite a bit of lace left on the glass. Aroma is nice and citrus fresh with the following characteristics in order of me noticing them; oranges, yeast, piney cloves, vanilla and faint banana. The flavor is light warm weather citrus fruits, most notably oranges or tangerine. Also yeasty and slightly spicy but not as spicy as I was expecting. This is medium to light-bodied, clean, very easy drinking with some carbonation and quite refreshing. The alcohol content is hardly noticed at all. Surely some will say it could use more of a bite to it. Overall this is a good beer, a solid Belgian Strong Ale and a great choice on a warm day."
"Alcohol is quite liquer-like in its warming and mellow lingering aspects. Fairly full-bodied. A very good brew if a bit off style. The 9% ABV is noticeable but nice and nowhere near overpowering."
"D- very drinkable. definitely awesome"
"For those of you out there complaining that Local 1 does not fit into a specific beer genre perfectly - STOP COMPLAINING and just love it for what it is. What is wrong with breaking out of the mold? Nothing, otherwise we would not be reading and writing about good beer and drinking fizzy yellow stuff."
"Decanted out of the 750 ML bottle into my pint glass producing a billowy head, three fingers thick of mostly medium sized bubbles with a slightly yellow tint. The brew itself is a natural, sunflower yellow tint with saffron hues. The head displays great retention and becomes rocky as the sampling continues and it laces in chunks. Aromas are pleasant but not overwhelming, fresh yeast. At first the flavors are slightly piqued by the lively carbonation but as the bottle oxidizes it settles. Fruit flavors of pear and green apple, grainy wheat, pale malt, slight nip in the ALC at the end. Sweeter than it smells but despite the fruit nuances it does not taste like a fruit beer. The higher % is well masked. Carbonation is high and yet not overwhelming; just vibrant all the way through. A good beer but not a God beer. Worth cellaring; if you haven't, try it."
"Pick up this bad boy at Fathead's in Pittsburgh today on a day long trip that took me all over the damn place....very excited to see it stocked. I came home and placed it lovingly in my fridge to chill...about three hours later I popped the top and poured into a Duvel glass. Right off I knew I was in for a treat; opening produced a loud pop, almost like a bottle of champagne. The color was a strong golden; with a thick opaque head that slowly dissolved over time. The aroma was absolutely incredible...a sweet musk with hues of hops in the background. Again the taste was incredible, smooth and hoppy, mellow and musky. Grab as many bottles of it as you can and lock them up for years to come. It's hard to believe that something that tastes this freaking good came out of New York and not Belgium, but the Brooklyn Brewery has done it again. Cheers!"
"d - great sipper and very enjoyable."
"Medium body, not too heavy or thick. Nice feel overall, but a bit syrupy right at the finish. I'll enjoy the rest of this 750 as my evening progresses."
"Drinkability is pretty good, not as complex as I'd like, but cleanly done. Still, a bit of a disappointment, as I was expecting a bit more."
"D: WIth the alcohol being quite noticable, it's certainly a mellow sipper, as it is intended to be. A nice way to spend an afternoon indoors, but suitable for good conversation on the patio with friends, as well"
"That said, Brooklyn has succeeded in brewing a beer with Belgian essence and for this they deserve full credit. It is a rare feat for brewers on American shores to replicate the art of Belgian brewing, their attempts usually result as caricatures. While this was no Bruegel, it certainly was no caricature either."
"Mouthfeel is sudsy and chewy, a wee bit thin. Overall it's a tasty brew- though I'd rather spend $12 on two delerium tremens, or la fin, I think they've got more punch and flavor and are more drinkable in general. But it's pretty good."
"This ale pours a yellowish amber, which is not impressive - but it does generate a nice, thick, fluffy, eggshell-white head. Aroma has about average strength and is malty with a strong fruity undertone. Flavor is crisp and pleasant, malty with a hint of apple or pear and a bit of an alcohol nip. Texture is smooth and crisp but has a little pizzazz."
"Drinkability is low due to the high ABV and the fact that it's made in a friggin' huge bottle. I couldn't finish this bottle off by myself if I wanted to. So it's limited to the occasions when I can get a few friends together to enjoy this beer. I'll give it another try someday but it wouldn't be joining my regular rotation anytime soon."
"I brought this over to my dads house to celebrate the birth of his new puppies. It poured creamy and left a real nice foamy head that really didnt go away. It had a dark rich golden color. Very complex taste with a soft smooth mouthfeel. Left a great after taste just begging you to drink more. Pretty easy to drink and an all around good beer."
"I kept tilting the bottle hoping more would come out. Great job Brooklyn Brewing. I plan to try one straight from the source."
"Not my favorite offering from Brooklyn, but definitely still top notch. I could see drinking a couple of these down the road if given the chance."
"Went really well with an apricot stilton cheese."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a bubbly white head that's a full 3 fingers thick. Aroma is of spicy yeast, very fruity nose. Taste is spicy funky yeast, some more spices and fruit. Carbonation is high. I hardly notice the 9% alcohol. Nice spicy Belgian brew, another fine offering for Brooklyn"
"Crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry, leaves the tongue puckery. Average drinkability, a bit one-dimensional for me."
"D: Very drinkable and comes highly recommended. A great spicy finish makes you want more."
"pours a cloudy yellow-gold w/ a rocky white head which never really settles leaving a thick lacing in my snifter ; a strong bready/cracker malt aroma, a good note of earthy hops and a ""hot"" spice, more pepper than coriander or both, hints of butter(?) detected but very faint ; taste is equally complex but more malty here, a def. floral-type hop present with a decent bite, pepper flavor asserts itself in the crisp finish, a touch of minerals, alcohol and butter at the end also ; a dry,creamy, med-full mouthfeel with boundless co2 ; an excellent beer, though i found it to be a bit too cloying and sticky as it warmed, prob. better during the winter..."
"D: Very tasty and flavorful beer. this is the best that brooklyn brewery has to offer and it impresses greatly. One of the most flavorful belgian pale ales you can find."
"Drinkability - Seemed to enjoy this one more in Atlanta the first time I had it, then again at the brewery in NYC. Definitely a sessionable beer as Oliver describes it, very easy to drink."
"D: This a very smooth Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I was thinking I was going to have a tough time bringing a 750 down by myself so I enlisted help. Based on mouthfeel and taste alone, I could have easily drank it by myself. I would have been buzzing hard, but possible. Still a great beer, much better than I expected."
"Picked up this fined brew after taking the Brooklyn brewery tour, which came in a package including two nice glasses and of course of the beer. Once pouring it into a hefeweizen glass I saw its great color. Nice a golden rich color with about a half an inch of off white head and some good lacing. At first the taste was typical of this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but as it warmed a bit more malty, sugary, and hoppy characters made appearances in the taste profile. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with some creaminess to it, definitely helped me dismiss the high alcohol content. Likewise, despite being 9% ABV it was quite drinkable. I would definately be able to drink a whole bottle on my own."
"Poured an attractive golden color with fluffy white head that dissipated fairly rapidly. Aroma is of yeast, spice, and fruit. Flavor was very similar to the aroma and I detected a fruity taste of pears. Beer is nicely balanced and mouthfeel is pleasant. Good stuff."
"Enjoyed a Brooklyn Local 1 from a 22 oz. bomber in my Allagash glass. It was better than I had originally thought it would be.. A true to form blegian ale from the Brooklyn Brewery. Taste was very good, not too strong for a 9% abv. Went down smooth, mouth feel was good as well. My brother-in-law who is normally a bud light drinker also throughly enjoyed this beer. I would drink this again and recommend to others."
"750 mL. Light golden color, with a full head of lasting foam. Authentic Belgian smells, with some light fruits, yeast, farmhouse. Flavor has nice balance, with a delicate sweetness and finish. Fairly similar to Duvel. Impressed by it being bottle conditioned and its authenticity. An ale of high quality."
"D: a very flavorful beer with good balance and feel, although alcohol character makes this a light drinker. Enjoy this like you would a tripel or golden strong ale."
"D - Very drinkable strong ale, would never turn this one down."
" depth to this beer I can't quit discern, but boy is it good."
"D: Absolutely fantastic. I'd drink it anytime offered and will definitely seek it out again. Highly recommended!"
" I have had a lot of this beer and I never get tired."

"750ml/Washington DC/Whole Foods/$7.99"
"Popped open one last night to celebrate a great weekend in NYC and Brooklyn. Bottle has been aging in my cellar for aprox. 6 months. Poured it into two Duvel glasses, and a gigantic head formed on each glass. The color was sunshine yellow, lots of tiny champagne-like bubbles, and tons of lacing on the glass. The smell had that hefe tingle to it, with spice and fruit hitting you. Taste was awesome. Perfect body to it, as I could feel it in the mouth but it was smooth enough to go right down. Stayed just as good at room temp. Didn't even notice the abv. Could this be even better than Duvel itself? One of the best limited releases from an American brewer that I have had in a while."
"I might sound biased, but I abso-fucking-lutely love this beer. I need to re-review just to confirm this. I try to be critical but I can't say anything truly negative about this beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a thick white head that dissipates slowly with medium lacing, lots of bubbles. Aromas from the sweet malt and sugar are complimented by banana and very fresh smells of flowers and citrusy hops, it smells like the beers I drank in Brugge. There is a citrus fruit flavor that is dominant with vanilla tones, almost buttery like a good chardonay. Different flavors pop from all parts of your mouth and tongue. Initially it coats the mouth fully, then the high carbonation cleanses. Amazing drinkability for a 9% beer. This is an elite American produced Belgian style ale."
"It is a solid brew but lacks a little smoothness that I would find in a Duvel. A good American brew trying to imitate what they do in Belgium but not my favorite."
"Overall- A fine beer, Brooklyn usually makes great stuff so I am not surprised. Maltiness is a little strong and I would've liked it a little more balanced so it isn't my favorite of the style, but it's fine."
"I think I prefer the more mellow malt character of Belgian Pale Ale's that allow the yeast and fruitiness, and other sweetness to come out more. This one seemed like a toasted type malt was dominating a little too much. Still a solid beer."
"Overall: A decent stab at a belgian pale ale that is quite tasty, I think the appeal in this beer is more in the spectacle of it than its actual quality. For a north american belgian beer I will be spending my money on unibroue and ommegang thank you."
"Very good beer Garrett."
"D: No problem drinking a whole bottle by yourself if you do not have someone to share it with."
"Ehhh... I don't know if I could tell this one from a bottle of Green Duvel (the unfiltered one)."
"Overall, this is a tremendous beer. It hints at being world class, but falls just short. Still, I would be happy to drink this any day of the week."
"D - The 9% ABV is prominent, I'd probably look to pair this with food and stick to a single bottle."
"D: Overall, I thought this was very drinkable. It bridged a gap between the Belgians I drink and the tarter fruit brew or lambic styles I love so much. I'll definitely buy it again."
"This beer is an awesome big boy. The feel and the flavor are excellent. The pour was a murky gold with a two finger white head. It wreaked of citrus, hops, and wheat. The taste was amazing. Almost a cross between a saison and wheat. I could really pull out grapefruit, orange, hops, with a wheat note mixed in. It was crisp and delicious. Very easy big beer to drink. Great for summer."
"Brooklyn Local 1 really isn't bad beer, it just isn't in the same area code as the world's best. Considering the price, I'd just as soon buy the Belgian BSPAs that make it to these shores. And the better American-brewed Belgian-style BSPAs. Thanks Sudsdog."
"D: Heavily carbonated, but that is easily compensated for by the taste and feel of the beer. It's a drinkable beer. Couldn't drink more then a bottle of it."
"Rather drinkable, no problem putting this guy down."
"Poured from corked bottle to pilsner glass. Had a cloudy golden orange pour with a nice half inch head that reduced to a minimal sheen. Mellow smell of malt and sweet fruitiness. Hops jump out front on the taste with a strong alcohol finish and apple hides in the booze burn. Had a dry finish with an alcohol aftertaste that reminded me of a spiced apple cider due to the heavy carbonation. Was ok for Brooklyn but I would not buy again."
"d - something about the taste just doesn't quite do it for me. This beer comes in 750ml bottle which is pretty rough to finish in one night on your own at 9% abv. I think I would rather have a duvel which comes in a smaller bottle and taste a little better. This is a good beer, but it's going to be hard to justify another purchase. Something worth trying once though."
"D: A really nice beer! Could hang out in a pack of belgians and be well disguised and in good company!"
"MF&D- Crisp and dry. Leaves the mouth immediately after the swallow, leaving behind only the alcohol warmth. Not a session beer due to the big 9% ABV but definitely worth going out and picking one up."
"I elected to swirl in the yeast at the bottom for the last pour, and it was definitely a plus."
"Very well balanced and drinkable. Among the best of this style I have had. Stacks up favorably alongside ""real"" Belgian beers such as Duvel and Delerium Tremens."
"It's a thin drink with almost no aftertaste; overall light and refreshing. Nothing about the flavor is overpowering; it has a good balance."
"Drinkability - I very nearly drank too much of this during the reception. Very easy to put back, a real winner."
"Medium bodied, with well hidden alcohol and a lively carbonation, it is very easy to drink and refres"
"I poured this beer into a snifter. Great light golden color. Lots of head and some nice lacing. Nice smell of apples (red delicious) Grapefruit and some sourness as well as some sweetness. No doubt from the sugar cane. I've heard a lot about this beer so i was excited to try it. I did like it but found it lacking in the complexity department .Maybe it was all that hype. Over all it was a good beer. Nothing like the real thing though. Sorry. I would definitely buy it again though. It was also a tad watery for my taste."
"D: Tasty and approachable. 9% is surprising until toward the end of the bottle. Normally wouldn't pair it with thick home made burgers but it fit the bill."
"D- Unique to the style. Unfortunately this style is not my thing."
"D- A very good example for the style. I don't think I would have ever guessed this was made by an American brewer. This is not extraordinary, but it is very enjoyable."
"Poured a slight murky orange with a two finger fluffy white head. The smell is of sweet apples, pears with a slight funk and some peppery spice. The taste is the same as the smell. There are slightly sweet fruits with a funkyness spice at the finish. The carbonation blends well with the flavors which makes this a smooth yet somewhat dry beverage with amazing drinkability. The weather is getting warmer and the light belgian style beers fit in so well."
"Lovely corked bottle here, prominently displaying the number 1. Tulip glass. Pours a wonderful amber haze, with a sustained off-white head, plenty of full lace down the side. Aroma is strong on the fruits: pear, apple, citrus, green grapes. Appetising, and slightly salty, with hints of caramel malting. Little alcohol detectable. Even better is the taste, which is opposite of how I normally experience these styles. Lovely burst of fruit, but never oversweet or sugary. Balance is the buzzword here: exceptional. Comes close to the complexity of some Belgians. Light but significant mouthfeel, just as it should be. Drinkability is almost flawless. This goes down beautifully. A fantastic beer from Brooklyn. Don't pass it up."
"Bottle into a snifter glass. About a centimeter of head from a gentle pour with little to no lacing while drinking. Pale orange color like those 25 cents plastic barrel artificial orange drink. Gentle nose of apples, pears, and spices. Cloves maybe? Light and easy body with a good amount of carbonation. Initially fruity and floral when it hits the palate. Even outs with some sweetness and ends with a nice bitter taste and feel. Pretty good drink, just doesn't make me go wow, this is good."
" Drinkability ; "" I drank two of these while writing this review and I feel fine""."
"Overall: An excellent Belgian style beer. Highly recommended to everyone."
"First off, I have to say I really love the Local 1 bottle. It's extremely appealing and bears resemblance to a Westmalle bottle. Generally I don't care much for Brooklyn Brewery beers, but I found this one to be quite exceptional. In the glass it had a golden straw color with a small head. As others have mentioned, the scent is very fruit, it reminded me distinctly of apple cider. The carbonation is fairly high and the taste is quite malty and sweet. The finish is very mild, which makes this beer very drinkable even with its 9% alcohol content. A real crowd pleaser as well, my friends really enjoyed cracking open a bottle at our favorite bar and my husband and I picked up another bottle at Total Wine the next day."
"Mouthfeel is that of typical Belgian quality no doubt due to the cane sugar from Mauritius. Highly drinkable. I enjoyed the closer it was to room temperature. Straddles the Saison and Belgian Strong Pale Ale styles smartly."
"D - hits you without you realizing it. Well done."
"This poured a hazy straw color with thin white head. It smelled like wild yeast and lemon hops. It had a bold, tart flavor of apricots with a hint of cinnamon. It was watery and carbonated with a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall this was decent, similar to a Belgian tripel."
"This is one is a twist on Belgian that I'll definitely search out again."
"It has a light mouthfeel to it and the carbonation is medium. I like sipping on this BSPA and I'm very glad I have another bottle. Well worth the effort to get some so please, do so. ;^)"
"there's some tartness in there"
"drinkability is great. nice balance. restrained but pleasant spicing. great light malt profile. very fresh and vibrant. really liked this one and will definitely pick up another bottle (or two) the next time i see it."
"Drinkability - delicious. Despite the abv, this is an easy one to just keep going on."
"Would buy again"
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a murky pale golden orange color with a lot of tiny bubbles ascending to the top to support a creamy white head that possesses awesome retention and lacing qualities. The aroma features fruity malts, spices and floral hops. The taste is malt and fruity esters up front with some earthy hops and yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, this is a solid attempt at a Belgian style brew from Brooklyn that is highly recommended. I have been disappointed with most of the Brooklyn lineup, but this is definitely my favorite beer from the Brooklyn Brewery lineup."
"The appearance is crystal clear, golden straw colored, lots of wet white foam on top. The aroma is really good, sweet and malty, sort of similar to some actual Belgian pale ales like Barbar or Petrus Blonde. The taste is also good, sweet malts and a hint of hops bitterness, some yeasty spiciness but also a little phenol flavor. Overall very good, very drinkable for the ABV."
"D: Very enjoyable. Almost a cross bread BSPA, BPA and heffeweizen. Refreshing and easy to drink. This stands up well with the top BSPAs."
"Worth every penny."
"I had a 25.4 oz bottle poured into a Chimay glass. It was a bright orange color with minimal haze and a nice, foamy white head that stayed throughout. No lacing on the glass, but the creamy appearance of the head was nice. It was a bit sweet to taste, with a lot of carbonation and very little in the aftertaste. It finished clean and left me wanting another sip. All in all, a very nice light brew good for sipping with a meal or on its own."
"Packaging is really nice, too. Curvy cork with a basket in the top, uber-slick label, hefty bottle. I'm a fan. This is an excellent beer, and I feel proud to live down the street from the brewery."
"this is a beer that's kind of interesting, given that's it's a lot dryer than a lot of saisons, and specifically, one saison. that garrett would make a beer like this is a little off-putting, until you remember that he loves hennepin (and uses it for a number of beer-cheese pairings) and hennepin is a sweet saison; so given his love of hennepin and the relative proximity of brooklyn and ommegang, it's easy to see how any saison he made would turn out like this; hennepin is a lot like other saisons only better, and garrett seems unable to make a bad beer. so we get local 1. i can't wait to drink this in the summer. something tells me this is a beer that will be an all-star come warmer weather. but even on nights that serve as a reminder of spring-yet-to-come its quality is not upon."
"D- This is an excellent American version of a Belgian SPA. The spicy/ fruity aromas and flavors are in nice balance with the doughy bread-like flavors. This is an excellent beer that holds it's own against the best SPA's that Belgium has to offer."
"Drinkability is moderate and the alcohol is well-masked at 9%, flavorful and fragrant version of a Belgian Strong PA, lacking in complexity and boldness but solid for the style"
"D - A fine Saison with some interesting subtle and not so subtle flavors. Its very hoppy which is a nice twist for a Belgian style. Try if you can."
"This beer poured a hazy golden color(almost the color of a mimosa) with a huge, foamy white head and had nice retention. The aroma was a burnt sugar(sugar refinery)smell and alcohol. The taste had a nice orange tanginess to it. The mouthfeel was heavy and creamy with medium carbonation. Overall this was a great, drinkable beer."
"D = NOt an everyday drink, but awesome if you are in the mood for a strong tasting, yet at the same time light refreshing Belgian."
"If I didn't know better I'd believe this was a belgium true saison. Very very good selection and recommend this to anyone."
"The appearance is golden and cloudy with a big fluffy white cap of foam. A beautiful bouquet enters the nose with lemon, yeast, some light bready notes, perhaps also some fresh fruit. Light carbonation makes the beer sally across the palate revealing flavors of citrus--lemon or orange, light malt breadiness, yeast and maybe apples. The beer finishes with a slight hint of spicy hops. This is a nicely balanced beer and very refreshing. The hefty alcohol content is not detectable at all and the beer is dangerously drinkable. Local 1 is definitely my favorite that I have tasted from Brooklyn thus far."
"The 9% alcohol is virtually imperceptible. A very easy to drink Belgian Strong. For $7.99 per bottle you can find the genuine Belgian brews, but this offering is not far behind."
"This beer poured a clear dark yellow color and formed a nice big foamy off white head that latef latticed lace as it subsided. No carbonation was present. The aroma was of malt, hops, lemon and yeast. The flavor was of malt, citrus, mostly lighter end like lemon with bread elements. The body was medium light and actually slightly buttery with a sprite, peppery finish to it. This beer surprised me."
"Overall- Very nice. Would drink well with a grilled chicken dish or seafood. Light and tingly on the palate."
"Pours a lighting gold with lots of bubbles and a little lacing at first that is nice at first, but quickly recedes to nothing. The aroma is herbal, malty, and flowery. The taste is a pretty compex mix of herbs and a hint of lemon zest in the middle of the palate. Then maybe some dry malts of very faint toastiness. Very dry palate. Lots of sweet earth, ad some light hops, Belgian style. Great American version of a classic Belgian style."
"750 Ml purchased caged and corked from Bottle King in Parsippany for $7.99... definitely the best beer that I've sampled from Brooklyn Brewery... in terms of a Belgian Strong, this is an excellent depiction of the style with an outstanding flavor that really hits home and is authentic in every sense of the word... nice golden, hazy, cloudy appearance with a minimial frothy head that soon dissipated, leaving a film of lace... smell was outstanding, complete with fresh fruit, florals, lemon, citrus, and slight coriander... taste strongly complemented the aroma with a superb, fresh, clear flavor full of grapefruit, pears, lemon-zest, esters, and citrus... very wholesome, refereshing, creamy, and thick taste that is certainly up there with some of the best... Brooklyn did very well with this one... very easily drinkable, which only took a slight hit due to the hefty 9% ABV... mouthfeel was also teriffic, as the beer felt like honey on the tongue... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Drinkability- What the hell is this beer? I don't know, but I really enjoyed it. Seems like a Witweizen Strong Golden Saison. Sign me up for another bottle. Good job Garrett and thanks for the bottle Ethan!"
"Pint+9 bottle. Pours a cloudy, golden yellow with a 2 to 3 cm foamy white head. Aroma of yeasty bread and banana. Initial flavor is very sweet with hints of citrus and yeast. Finish is clean and dry and very short lived. Nice lacing, no noticeable carbonation, and alcohol is noted from aroma as it warms through the aftertaste. Very drinkable and better than initially anticipated."
"Overall, this is a pretty great drink. The carbonation is a little strong, and the color is a little on the yellow side. Also, the alcohol hits hard (but not on the palate, fortunately). Another win for brooklyn."
"This beer has a slightly tart smell. It had a nice hop finish. A very good ephemeral, light body. Very enjoyable."
"Poured a pale golden color with a puffy white head slowly dissolves down to a half inch high and stays there. The fragrance has sweet spices of some ginger and corriander, then some cloves and banana scents that are more like a hefeweizen. This followed by sweet aroma of candied sugar. At first taste there is the light taste of wheat, folowed by the taste of spices coming through, ginger, coriander, and little bit of a dried fruit flavor. The kicker is there is a hop kick at the end, with a grass and piny flavor. A total surprise since none was in the aroma. A very smooth feel at first, a medium bodied feel, then it gradually thins itself out. There is the feint tingle of carbonation on the back of the palate. Now I am not partial to the saison style, but this is different. It started like alot of belgians, had some surprises in the aroma, plus the unique flavor brought on at the end, makes this a must try beer."
"""where and the hell did these IBU's sneak in to my mouth?"" Yeah, these hops hit you like a barrel of bitter monkeys. After the first taste, the tend to de-evolve to more of peat malt taste...wierd eh? AND yet, still a very drinkable beer. I applaude Brooklyn for trying something different with the increasing popular belgian brew... CHEERS!"
"Bottle courtesy of mgermani: Poured a hazy beige color ale with a medium foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of candy with some pears and apricot and some sweet malt is somewhat reminiscent of some of the Trappists. Taste is surprisingly not that well balance with a mix between the candy like sweetness and some dry fruits with sweetness just getting to be gross at the end. Body is quite full with some medium carbonation and alcohol was not apparent. I really wanted to like this and I am glad I had the opportunity to try this but I thought the flavour really clash and were not properly balanced."
" This brew transcends a style really and is proof Amercians to do Belgian's and very well."
"d. sorry to say but kinda boring, very little complexity here, will not buy again"
"750ml bottle: This one pours an almost clear, golden color. There was a fairly large white head on it that drops off quickly and didnt leave much lacing. The aroma is light and sweet. Some notes of spices, yeast, and some lighter fruits. A bit of effervescence of the tongue. The taste is a bit peppery, yeasty, some very mild fruits. Interesting mix. Not the usual dark fruits found in strong Belgians. This one grows on you."
"Overall, an extremely well done Belgian style ale, regardless of country of origin."
"750ml corked and caged brown bottle with no freshness date. pours a hasy golden yellow with a two finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Good tart aroma mixed with citrus - namely grapefruit. Slight honey and yeast smells as well. Good sweetness up front followed by a tart citrus flavor and a decent hop bitterness in the end. Richer and not as tart as the smell leads on to believe. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable. A bit rough but should smooth out nicely with a bit of time. All in all a very good beer."
"Partly hazy medium golden body with lemon edges. Frothy, rocky, off-white head. Excellent lacing along the walls of the tulip glass. Nose of fresh hay, shortbread cookies, estery fruits, and zesty, fresh hops. Slightly metallic, herbal hops up front. Tropical fruit, melon, and sweetish shortbread mid-palate. Herbal, minty, slightly funky hop bitterness picks up as the sweetness and alcohol crest. Yeasty, cobwebby, fresh hay and spicy hop finish. Medium-full body with a nearly syrupy feel, especially mid-palate. Very nice!"
"This beer is a major homerun from Brooklyn. I look forward to more of their unique offerings in the coming year."
"Not an overly complex nor bombastic Belgian strong pale ale, and I think that's why I enjoyed this so much, as it can still hold its own in the quality dep't without having to overdo it. Nicely balanced and contained, I think refined would be the proper term. A great ale to share or to finish on one's own, whether you have a good reason or excuse to celebrate something or not. I'll definitely be buying more of these as my budget will allow."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It has a light in color, cloudy look in the glass. The taste was smooth with a slight bitterness. I was really impressed with this beer. I have tried quite a few of the other Brooklyn beers and was thrilled to have tried Local 1 as my final 200th beer. Would definitely have it again!!"
"Bottle number 1437. Pours cloudy pale gold, with a massive, pure white head that leaves big lace all the way down the glass. Aroma is sweet, floral and lightly spicy with some fruity notes. Flavor is fruity and peppery, with significant alcohol notes. Finish is spicy and slightly phenolic, with more peppery notes. Body is suitably light."
"D - Pretty good. An enjoyable beer, I wouldn't mind having again. It isn't fantastic, but it is worth a try."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. Good taste and nice mouthfeel, but as I noted above, the evidence of alcohol took away from the beer a little bit. The burn of the alcohol on the palette took away from the citrus taste and banana esters that were evident in the smell."
"Pours a clouded straw gold with a huge white head. Nose is strong with yeast and a sugar tone. Just smelling it brings back memories of all the great Belgian brews I have had to this point in my beer journey. Flavor is superb. Put this in a plain bottle and no one would know it was out of Brooklyn I am willing to wager. Smooth and even sweetness with a noticeable yeast influence. So well balanced and smooth. Unbelievable. Feel is as good as everything else has been to this point. Smooth and with a great level of bubble on the tongue. Drinkable to the worlds joy and detriment. I immediately just wanted to go back and get more."
"Pours a cloudy golden straw in color with about a finger of white head that leaves some nice lacing. Great aroma, fairly complex. Slightly sweet, fruity (apricots?), a bit citrusy (oranges), spicy, and, only at first, slightly musty. Taste is a bit sweet, somewhat yeasty, a touch spicy, and again quite fruity. At first it is sweet but then becomes fruity and just a bit sour. Then just before the finish the spices return (cloves). In the finish this brew gets yeasty and just a touchy funky. Since Garrett oliver described this as a strong saison I'll say that all the flavors I described are just what was intended. mouthfeel is good, lightish body that just barely leans toward medium and low-moderate carbonation. In terms of drinkability this is pretty good. I can't taste the alcohol at all but I get just a bit of a warming sensation to let me know its there. Overall this is a complex and interesting brew that I'd recommend."
"Originally acquired via trade with mymrnngjctk. A huge 3 finger off white head with rocky bubbles erupts with a vigorous pour. Body is a hazy rich straw colored. Nose is slightly sweet and very fresh with notes of wheat, mellon, wicker, and zesty spice. Spicey ripe fruits hit the mouth and dances nicely with the wheat sourness and slight malt backround. This is very clean drinking and refreshing. Very polished and comes without the rawness this style sometimes is known for. Well made American version, reminds me alot of La Fin da monde. Alchol warms the belly well. Mouthfeel is realatively thick due to the hoppy bite on the back of the tongue. Scary drinkable at 9% alc."
"Hazy beautiful gold color with a smattering of bubbles across the chalice. It smells fruity like fresh cut apples, and also yeasty. The taste is immediately delicious with sweetness and then an odd spiciness with a full creamy texture. This was my first taste of Brooklyn Brewing and it was very tasty."
"Overall: A very good strong pale ale, a bit oversweet for my tastes, but enjoyable. Recommended."
"750 ml Bottle poured hazy orange with a white head that turns to lace. Aromas of bubblegum and a light citrus candy fill the nose. The palate is medium with a light carbonation on the tongue. Flavors of sweet sugar and bubblegum with a big almost pepper bite in the finish. Not one of my favorites Belgium strongs but one of the best Americans takes on the stile for sure"
"Medium bodied, very slick and supple. I could easily down a 750 myself as the drinkability is excellent. A very authentic example of this style and a job well done Mr. Oliver."
"Poured a clear, pale, only slightly hazy yellow with an astonishingly thick and tenacious head that persisted throughout the glass. Some yeasty, banana esters of the Belgian persuasion came forth. The most striking characteristic of this beer is the very dry and fully attenuated taste and mouthfeel. It is incredibly drinkable, or as the Belgians say, digestible, with very little of its 9% ABV being perceivable to the drinker. I felt like I could just keep quaffing this one, thought my rational mind told me not to. Feels drinkable as a session beer. I liked the fact that it had so little residual sugar and cloying sweetness, yet retained a complexity and character worthy of the strong Belgian genre. Very well done brew by Brooklyn Brewery."
"Overall, it's a balanced example of a Belgian strong pale ale. The aftertaste leaves something to be desired though. Regardless, this is an excellent beer that you shouldn't pass up. I probably should have aged this bottle but will do so with another bottle soon."
"Pours golden with a fluffy white head. Good retention,and lacing. Lots of bubbles. Smell is of fruit,candy,and alchol. Body is medium,and carbonated. Taste is a nice balance,sweet,but a tart edge in the finish. Fruity,and boozie throughout. Nice alchol burn."
"750 ml caged/corked bottle, bottle has #1377 on it, not sure if it's the bottle number or some kind of date code. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a hazy straw gold/orange color with a small white head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. It smells like candy sugar, apricots, citrus and spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of yeast and peppery spice. It seems with each drink I can taste a different fruit (pear, apricot, orange, lemon, grapefruit). Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, a bit creamy with moderate carbonation that has a zip to it. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. The alcohol isn't noticable in the taste, but you know it's there because after drinking it a while the alcohol warmth hits you. Overall I think this is a pretty good brew, I'd recommend it to anyone to try. I'd buy it again."
"Fresh from the distributor, who also obtained it fresh. Hmm. Sweet yellow, slick textured liquid. Aromas are estery and slightly canned corny. Decent flavors of red delicious apples and moist white bread and simple sweetness. This belongs to the Duvel/Pranqster tradition. It should have more complexity (or be drier). A vague detergent aroma and mild bitterness are the only hops effect."
"Yes, it's a touch pricey, but worth a try if you aren't a cheakskate."
"Very drinkable, i probably could have downed this one myself but i shared it with a couple friends instead--a much better idea. We all liked it. For the money, a delicious belgian style beer."
"750ml caged and corked bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Pours a hazy golden-orange with a half inch of off-white head that dissipates surprisingly quickly. Smells fruity (orange, lemon), somewhat pithy, spicey with hints of vanilla and wood. Tastes orangey/grapefruity, pithy, malty, with spice, piney hops, and vanilla hinted at as well. Medium to light in body with only moderate amounts of carbonation. Extremely (dangerously) drinkable for its complexity and abv. Phenomenal. Extremely impressed with this one - can't wait to see how it ages."
"I very nice farmhouse ale coming from Brooklyn."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very smooth, soft carbonation. The drinkability is good."
"Purchased over the summer in Brooklyn, and shared at a big tasting. A really nice saison, with enough kick to be good drinking in November. Pours a pale gold with a big fluffy white head. Sweetish aroma, slightly spritzy. Flavour is somewhat yeasty with light fruit elements, very low carbonation (which I like), and a fantastic mouthfeel. Another one of the best of the night (if I do say so myself)."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable. Never noticed the ABV. Really refreshing."
"750ml corked bottle into tulip glass. A: Cloudy yellow, some puffy white head that goes down after a few minutes. Minimal lacing. S: Candied sugar, caramel, lots of malt--nice, but I can't get much behind the thick sugar. T: Really surprising; sweet, yes, but a lot of bread, citrus, apple, grains, and I swear there are some vegatable tastes in here. Broccoli? Asparagus? My stomach feels warm from the alcohol but it's nearly imperceptible on the palate. M: Very crisp and refreshing, medium body. D: I wasn't expecting much from the appearance and the smell, but this is a very solid brew. Hard to believe the 9% abv, it's very drinkable. The balance is really great, and I'm enjoying it more and more as I continue through the glass."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer. Quite a bit of spice, but a bit less fruit than I would personally like; might benefit from some additional acidity."
"Nevertheless, this is superbly drinkable, and the carbonation is great in the mouth. Watch out, though, because it is 9% abv!"
"Hmmmm...JoeyBeerBelly did very well in our recent transaction of beery goods! Thanks Joe!"
"A true farmhouse ale that I suggest to any beer advocate."
"Drinkability: First glass is a shock of sorts, but quite easy afteward. Strong beer and not recommended for see through lager types(not me)"
"There's a brewery cat at Brooklyn that you should visit should you find yourself in Brooklyn. He may even start talking to you if you down a whole bottle of Local 1. Got to keep a great glass with the purchase, and the brew is a real triumph."
"Not bad, has a very nice smell, but the taste didn't live up to the aroma in my opinion."
"D: Great for it's strength!"
"·Drinkability: Not quite as strong in taste or mouthfeel as others of its style, but enjoyable regardless."
"A quite enjoyable brew that is more a nice change of pace for me than something I'd regularly stock."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed the 750mL bottle of this, but I don't think I'll be picking this one up again. It was a nice experience though."
"La Fin Du Monde blows this out of the water and is half the price."
"D: The bottle I tasted had a very pronounced phenolic taste and clove taste. The phenolic was very evident and really detracted from my experience with this beer."
"Mouthfeel- Creamy feel with a sweet beginning that ends in a dry finish that lingers for a long time. delicious. Carbonation excites the tastebuds but is not overpowering. ABV is a bit high but does not effect the drinkability."
"Poured a hazy yellow-orange color, with carbonation bubbles rapidly running up the side, even after sitting for a few minutes. There was a strong, frothy, white head, that started 1 finger as I pour, but quickly sprouted to 3 fingers. The smell and the taste were rich and complex. The aroma was sweet and floral, with a yeast presence and some spice and bubblegum in there too. The taste was wonderful: a golden-style body, with yeast undertones, hints of citrus, and potentially even the faintest, pleasant taste of alcohol. It went down smooth and warm, thanks to the medium carbonation and lighter mouthfeel, with a hoppy, tangy, lingering aftertaste. I need to get more of this! I could have sipped on it all night."
"Drinkability: I respect it but I don't love it; for a Belgian, it is just a bit too grassy and spicy for me"
"The taste is dominated by massive amounts of sweetness with rather pleasant yeast tones lurking in the shadows. The finish is above all else dry. Surprisingly mild."
"Overall- A good, mellow, saison. Easy drinking here, find this on tap and have a couple."
"Overall, very drinkable. Very refreshing. Quite impressive."
"Poured into a wine chalice. Not a big foamy head as I expected. The color was a cloudy straw with mild carbonation, slight white head. The aroma was a mix of candi sugar, earthy hops, and twelve grain bread. The taste had hints of the sweet pale malt, but also had a strong bite to it much more like a tripel than a strong pale ale. The peppery bite was present throughout the flavor profile. The body was probably just right for this type. It is one brew that I would love to try again and maybe with 6 months or so of aging."
"750 ml bottle. The brew pours very heady. After settling, it is about a finger high and steady as a rock. The beer is a deep hazy straw yellow with a few random bubbles climbing the sides. This is a nice looker. The aroma is lightly banana estery, sucrose-sweet, with orange and lemon zestyness. There is a mild yeasty spice running through it. As it warms a little, there is a solid puff of alcohol in there that plays nicely with the spice character. The flavor brins a good bit of yeasty spice, creamyness, and light mustyness. Orangepeel sweetness comes through along with a light sucrose sweetness. The finish is a light alcohol and mild spicy hop bitterness and a touch of raw hop leaf taste. The spicing and mustyness really come through on the finish. The alcohol is a little solventy, but not offensive at all. Warmth brings out some more fruity esters in the aroma as well. Mouthfeel is fairly thick with a moderate carbonation. It foams a little after taking a sip, which adds a bit of body to it without being too airy. Overall, this is a good brew. I like the musty and earthy yeast character and I think that a little more time will make this pop a little more. I think the alcohol will mellow and meld more with time as well."
"Lots of different aromas: moderate malt, hay, straw, light hops, grass, banana, clove, pepper. Smale, creamy head, excellent lacing, clear , yellow. Can't taste the alcohol, but can feel it. Since Garrett raves about this style of beer and Saison Dupont , in particular, I was very eager to try this beer."
"Decent carbonation, just enough to tingle the tongue. Despite the ABV, very drinkable."
"drinkability: good"
"Very interesting, I was not sure what to expect from this beer, but was certainly not expecting something so refined and austere. This is obviously a very well technically crafted beer, somehow it just comes off as a bit too squeaky clean to me (perhaps it was filtered a bit too much). Based on the initial aroma I would have definitely said there was spices added to this brew, but the flavor, while certainly spicy driven, is not so nearly convincing and even the clove dominated aromatic notes after the beer warmed a bit is purely fermentation derived. I really need to get another bottle of this, as I feel like some aging (a year or two) will add back some missing complexity. All in all a tasty beer, that seems a touch too phenolic to be really great, but one which I would be happy to have a case of in my cellar."
"This is a really nice Saison from the Brooklyn folks. Enjoy!"
"Promising from the start as the cork is released a big pop from a lot of carbonation. Pours a hazy yellow golden with a big airy, fluffy white head that reduces quickly to thin frothy cap. Aromas of acidic lemon citrus, pear, lots of alcohol esters, and twangy yeast. Medium body and smooth mouthfeel with a sharp carbonation that is well behaved, very little frothy build up. Starts with a mellow fruity citrus and sweet rock candy, quickly followed by a nice sour, musty yeast character, peppery spice, florals, pungent herbals, and clove. The finish is dry grains, earthiness, musty, and fermented lemon rind. Nothing wrong with this one, finely crafted."
"Overall, not bad, but not worth the $8 I paid for it."
"drinkable?: specially if you like the style."
"Bottle Number 1017. This brew seemed very effected by temperature and I would suggest drinking it on the warming side, as opposed to drinking cooler and letting warm with drinking time."
"Overall this is a fine Saison, and like others in the style, unique. Is it the best Belgian ale brewed in the United States? I need to try more of its colleagues before I can answer that."
"Don't drink and review."
"Okay, this has got to be the BEST Saison I have ever tried. Golden haze, lots of fruity esters, balanced amount of malts and hops, but wamring down the throat nonetheless. Would love to get my hands on a bomber of this sometime. Probably the best Brooklyn beer I've had, just a great version of this Belgium delight."
"Two and a third years later yeasty and tasty drinkable stuff, much better mouthfeel."
"I received this sample from my local distributor well before the beer was officially available in my area. Not sure how much time this has had in the bottle. As a fan of the Brooklyn Brewery in general, I am eager to try anything new they have to offer. Add to that the fact that this beer undergoes 100% refermentation and carbonation in the bottle, and this one should not be missed. Pours a pale straw golden yellow with a tightly knit head. The head recedes quickly, but there is nice lacing. Aromas are subtle--light grains and a little banana. The taste is no less than exceptional. Esters, grains, hops, carbonation--everything works together here for a common cause. The mouthfeel is somewhat slick and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation to give a little prickle on the palate. I can't get over how much this beer reminds me of a more refined DeRanke XX Bitter. Similar malt and hop profiles with less emphasis on being bitter and more focus on balance. While so many breweries miss when it comes to Belgian Style ales, this offering from Brooklyn is spot on."
"Drinks okay, but didn't quite pull together for me. Saison fans will think more of this I'd bet"
"Excellent drinkability. Fairly big price tag, but I will come back to this one again."
"A really good beer, I'm not sure how much of a saison it is, it strikes me as more of a strong pale in the Duvel, La Fin du Monde category. Still another excellent offering from an excellent brewery."
"750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. It was orange in color with a medium-sized white head. The aroma was mostly sweet and fruity, with a little bit of spice. The spice was more apparent in the taste, but also fruit, yeast, and licorice. A little bit of warmth from the alcohol. Very pleasant beer, a good saison."
"D: Could really only have one 750ml bottle in a sitting, but drinkable for the high alcohol and style."
"The aroma is what I would expect from a Saison...a little yeasty, a little spicy, a little fruity. Nothing overpowering the others, just a good aroma. The layers of flavor in this beer also hit a high note for me. All of what you get in the aroma you get on the taste buds, plus the mildly alcoholic finish. It's quite a drinkable beer. Certainly would recommend it to anyone interested in the style."
"Golden color with a huge white head on top. Head receedes but is still prominant the rest of the way down the glass. Earthy and sulfury aroma-somewhat spicy. Sweet and malty flavor dominates. Not as sweet as some reviews I had read when this first came out. Slightly spiced. Decent mouthfeel. A decent beer-definately drinkable and enjoyable. Another success for Brooklyn."
"The last time I tried this brew, I believe my taste buds might have already been a bit tired from a sampling of something else. Pours an excellent golden color, with a white head that holds up very well. Lively carbonation on this brew as well, with heaps of tiny bubbles rising to the top of my tulip glass. Aroma has elements of pear, grain, orange, and pineapple. Taste begins on the sweet side with juicy fruits and sugars, and then ends on a somewhat dry, champaign oriented note. Mouthfeel is medium, with the 9% alcohol extremely well hidden. Carbonation id moderate, and as it warms becomes even less noticeable. Easy to drink as well, it gets tastier with every sip. Lately Brooklyn has been my favorite brewery, and this is yet another good reason why. Very much worth a try, as this is a pretty complex beer. Cheers"
"If there were a bar that had this on draught I might consider drinking a few of these bad boys. The 9% isn't apparent at all here."
"Brooklyn, knowing where and who this beer comes from, a sence of trust or knowing this is the way this beer should be. A standard has now been set."
"As far as drinkability, it is a strong beverage and definately delivered a nice buzz."
"Poured this one into my tulip glass. The color is a nice light orange with an inch of head and great activity and head retention. A nice thick layer of white, fluffy, foam lasts throughout the whole drinking experience. The aroma is of citrus, malt, spices and nice earthy hops. Tastes very much like the aroma but also very peppery. It seems like the spices have a more central role in the taste. The mouthfeel and carbonation are excellent and make this beer very refreshing. There is a nice tangy aftertaste but this beer passes the palate very cleanly. I remember reading a review of this beer in the New York Times and I was determined to get a hold of a bottle--which also started my trading addiction. Will get some more in future trades, fortunately I have one more bottle to share with a friend or two. So far the best strong pale ale I have tried."
"750ml corked and caged. Bottled on 1/26/07. First beer to bottled in Brooklyn. Hopefully not the last. Pours a slightly cloudy, golden-orange color into my Brooklyn Brewery glass. An easy pour brings a foamy bright-white head with miniscule bubbles. Solid layer of foam lasts throughout the glass leaving some beautiful lacing. Yeasty smell backed by some white fruit - orange, peach and mango. Definitely fruity and sweet smelling. Complex taste of white fruit and yeasty spiciness with some tartness towards the end. That's the Saison part kicking in. Hallertauer Perle and Styrian Golding hops lend to a dry finish. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink for a 9% beer as the alcohol is well-hidden, but does leave a warmth in the belly. Very-well done. Cheers to Garrett for an exceptional beer."
"Hugely impressive, bursting with amazing depth of flavor and aroma...it's so delicious, you don't even notice or care about the 9% alcohol. Easily the best I've ever had from this brewery."
"At first I thought this was going to be another typical Belgian style beer. It has all the characteristics of a Saison, but the well balanced flavor and sparkling appearance are terrific."
"Speaking of Garrett Oliver, he should make more of this. It's good to know that I can drink local and drink Belgian at the same time."
"I truly enjoyed this, Brooklyn has a winner."
"D: Very good saison, this one is courtesy of limesmut. Thanks much for this one."
"Overall, I'm very impressed with Brooklyn's version of this Belgian beer. Local 1 is very refreshing and full of surprise. Very much worth dragging to Germany for."
"Refreshing offering that is very true to form of a Saison."
"Overall: I am a big fan of Saison's and this is one of the best. I really love Rabid Rabbit, which is atypical for the class, but barring that one this is my favorite Saison to date."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 3/4"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head fades slowly, with sporadic white lacing. Aroma is strong pale malts coupled with lots of sparkly spices. Taste follows the nose, with the sweetness coming back in the end, fading into hearty alcohol character. Mouthfeel is smooth, with drinkability a bit limited by the alcohol, maybe could blend in a bit better. Overall a very nicely constructed brew."
"Thanks to Tony for splitting this with me!"
"D - Overall, this is a very good beer. I've already gone out and picked up another bottle to age for a few months."
"Silky mouthfeel yet at the same time it is very light and crisp. Very digestable would be more so if phenols were toned down. That said this is a very good beer and is highly recommended."
"Golden color, somewhat murky. white head, dissipates but keeps nice layer. Citrus smell, bit of hops. Has a full-bodied taste, smooth mouthfeel. Strong taste and smooth aftertaste. No alocol burn which is shocking for 9%. Very good taste but nothing too exciting."
"D: Overall this beer is an impressive package. Quality ingredients. Well brewed and crafted. I could drink this all day but would get completely hammered in the process. I first tried this at the Beer Advocate American Beer Fest this past June - one of the best offerings at the festival."
"Received from my brother, srm71, and consumed on my 31st birthday."
"EDIT: After a re-tasting several months later, this brew is quite overwhelming on the coriander and spices now. It tastes like a pungent version of Hoegaarden for whatever reason. I'm not a huge fan of the coriander flavor, so I must degrade a bit. Not sure if it was just based on a bad bottle or what, but if I ever try again, I'll re-re-review."
"The beer's sweet/warm interplay makes is best suited for the same interplay in food. I simply can't wait to pair this beer with Pad Thai or other sweet and spicy cuisine."
"Poors a slightly hazy gold, with a big head soda esque head. Smell is rather faint but plesent with hints of sweet fruit and some light malts. The taste is complex but well rounded, and perfect for the summer night. The mouthfeel is crisp and light for 9%. Very drinkable and enjoyable"
"My favorite so far from Brooklyn and and very good saison. It seems to me I read this was a unique style mix between a strong golden ale and saison. It definately has the saison qualities and as far as saisons are concerned a very good one."
"Very well done. Somewhat of a surprise that Mr. Oliver's brewery has turned out such a fine pastoral Belgian style ale. Kudos!"
"Flavor: Sweet upfront with ripe fruit notes... bitter hop dominates the middle with a mild spice flavor... quite balanced finish."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale. Only its high abv limits sessionability. Also, I believe this to be a trippel, or a BSPA, and not a Saison as it is listed here."
"Anticipated. Recommended."
"Pours up a nice golden color with some peach highlights. Generous, pillowy off-white head lasts for a while and leaves good lacing. Snappy yet doughy malt aroma with hints of honeysuckle, pear blossom, white pepper, mentholated tobacco and lime zest. Lightly yeasty in aroma as well as a notable hop and alcohol presence. Upon first sip, I can't help but think tripel. Hefty alcohol warmth with some doughy pale malt sweetness that is cut with a healthy peppery carbonation and then moves towards a lightly drier finish. Some astringent grassy suggestions in the transition between the initial sweetness and lightly citrusy finish. A very nice medium to full bodied beer with a good carbonation level and hoppiness to keep the sweetness in check. Alcohol seems more prevalent in the nose than it is in the taste, which is a bonus. Very drinkable for how potent it is. Overall, not quite as dry nor refined as some Belgian counterparts, but a real nice beer worth seeking out and trying."
"the text on the top of this page fool you. This is a Belgian strong golden ale. Recommended!"
"Brooklyn Local 1 gets high ratings but I'm not that enthusiastic about it. Compared to the excellent Saision Dupont, for example, Local 1 tastes more towards a Weissbier. I guess it's the sweetness and strong yeast flavour that does it. Then again, a true Saision should really change from batch to batch. The one I tasted poured in a good pale yellow colour and with two fingers of creamy foam. The smell was dominated by a sweetness, yeast, and citrus (much like a Weissbier is). Luckily the taste was not as sweet as the smell indicated but it was still a little syrupy. The taste was also framed by notes of crackers, yeast and quite a lot of alcohol. Some bitter herbs back there too. I guess it was alright but not quite up there."
"This beer pulls of a very difficult task; it is a little better than Hennepin one of my all time favorite beers. This is one of those beers for all seasons; it tastes like spring and warms like a favorite blanket. Needless to say this is one of those beers that is permanently on my wants list."
"Saison? Really? Seems a bit more Triple or Strong Pale like to me, but whatever. Damn good beer regardless. Beautiful pour, nice white head and golden body. Taste is subtle - nothing really extreme or offensive going on here. Friends who tried this with me immediately insisted that this was very much like Duvel. We had a bottle of that afterwqards, and though I did prefer the Local, I am inclined to agree. Great body and mouthfeel. I wish all beers drank like this. A bit of heat from the alcohol, but drinkability is much better than I would have thought. A very good beer."
"Flavor is really quite ripe. Not ""fruity"" but more liquidy like when biting into a rip peach. And that liquidy flavor is full of sweet sugars and malts. Little bit of clover and just a tad of spioces. Just some slight bits of pepper too. Mouthfeel is medium to light and actually slightly syrupy. Just a little bit of heat from the alcohol."
"Pours a golden raisin dirty blonde leaving a thin white lacy frothy head that disappears quickly. The aroma is sweet raisins, plums, figs, honey, pitted fruit abound, a fantastic nose. The taste starts a bit boozy, but nothing crazy. The mouth feel is light, sweet, crisp, and delicious. The finish is slightly hoppy with a sweet fruit ripened ending this beer is great. Hopefully this doesn't go away."
"Bottle courtesy of BeerTruth, thanks again!"
"Last swigs: A lightly fruity saison without that signature doughy aspect."
"Pours cloudy pale yellow with 1/4 inch of soapy white foam on top and lots of carbonation. Not very convincing looking for a Belgian-style golden ale. Smells fruity and honeyed, with plenty of dusty lemon and candy sugar on a minty background. The flavor begins with tart limes, developing into a husky grain and honey center. Finish and aftertaste and dominated by strong urea notes. Body is highly carbonated, relatively thin. Quite a disappointment coming from the folks at Brooklyn Brewery. The beer can't decide what it is, but it's certainly not a saison, tripel, or typical strong golden ale."
"Good brew!"
"D: Pretty good for a beer of this ABV; the mouthfeel allows it to go down pretty easy, though IMHO the sweetness holds it back a bit."
"bottle 1017 on 9/19/2013: About 7 years on at this point, picked this one up when I loved on Chester Ave at NCSU. Fairly heavily oxidized at this point with some brown fruit character- overripe banana and peach - spread over honey, stone fruit, and touches of citrus. Some interesting yeasty character, more banana, and an age-absence of hops. Not terrible, but I can't say age did it any favors - still interesting to take in and think about from when and where it came."
"D: For all its complexity, nothing gets too out of whack, making for a masterfully balanced ale. Also, the alcohol doesn't out-do the flavors, and I can definitely see drinking another one of these this summer if I tire of all the miscellaneous wheats and lagers."
"All in all a great beer, I really enjoyed it. This is one of those brews that comes along and reminds you why you love craft beer so much. By far my favorite beer of 07 so far."
" Overall I would have to say this was very well done. Definatly worth a try and you can tell much time was spent on the production of it. Not too heavy and the alcohol really is well hidden. A more then decent offering and a good one to grab a bottle of for sure."
"This one does change character as it progresses, and I enjoyed it more as it went on. However, it still struggles to contend with other Belgians in this category, IMO. Still, it is certainly worth trying and it's certainly a decent American interpretation of a Belgian."
"Pours a straw gold in color, mainly clear with a decent size white fluffy head that slowly recedes. Aroma is some nice apple and lemon tartness balanced by a soft honey sweetness. These somewhat tart aromas are stronger on agitation, there is a fairly light spiced clove aroma as it settles, some background grassiness as well. Soft honey sweetness up front gives way to a somewhat grassy bitterness followed by a pepperiness. All the while the tartness is there in the background and lingering in the aftertaste, some light bready and belgian yeastiness as well that mix with the light maltiness. Light to medium body, fairly high level of carbonation tingles on the tongue along with the good sized peppery and drying bitterness. I am surprised by the abv here, it doesn't come across at all as 9%, in the taste, aroma, or how I feel after drinking it. Very enjoyable and the nice dry and crisp finish keeps me coming back for more."
"Very drinkable, must get more. One of the finest Belgians I've had from an American source."
"I'll admit I've been lukewarm about Brooklyn, but this creation rewards an open mind. Simply, this is one of the better, if not the best, high-octane Belgian style ales coming from America. The ABV is big but not especially bold, and the warmth is coy and sneaky. Still, no reasonable level of alcohol could dampen the fine drinkability. Here's to hoping for more greatness to come out of Williamsburg."
"D- A bit too alcoholic and a bit too bitter in the finish to merit a very high score here. However, it's probably the best belgian made in America that I've had so far."
"Highly recommended"
"Cheers!"
"The corked, and caged bomber looked authentic Belgian, except for the brown color of the glass. The beer was poured into a Duvel tulip, and it looked quite a bit like the original BSPA. The color was pale yellow (i. e., Pilsner like), and the body was extremely clear. The head was easily formed as a result of active and vigorous carbonation, but proportionally it seemed smaller than the great examples of the style. Aroma was oaky, Brettanomyces funky, and also had a tinge of orange peel to it. I liked the smell, but it was a bit busy in my opinion. Taste was spicy, quite noticeably Belgian with a confluence of bitter, sweet, tangy, and earthy flavors, but suffered from the one flaw that most American imitations of the style seem to be affected by. It just wasn't dry enough. The alcohol presence was also bigger than it should have been, making this probably a lot closer to a Tripel than a BSPA. Medium full bodied as a result of all the sweetness. Quite a big beer, but an interestingly easy one to drink due to the spicy and effervescent taste."
"D- In my opinion this one is a dud. No its not that bad, but Brooklyn has made so many fantastic beers that I expect more from them. This beer was just not worth the ridiculous price I paid for a bottle."
"A great beer no doubt. This seems very close to the Belgian Tripel style, but who cares about styles and genre...this is just a great beer! Worth seeking out."
"Clear light gold, just a hair darker than straw yellow, topped by a bright white head of soapy bubbles. Good retention with some clumpy, transient lacing. Spicy nose with a hint of clove, a little yeasty with notes of lemon, alcohol, and bread. The flavour's on the clean side as far as yeast is concerned, some spiciness is present, along with floral/herbal hops. Malt sweetness up front, tropical fruit and peppery spice linger in the finish. Nice texture, some alcohol warmth that's well controlled, medium body with plentiful carbonation. This came in a classy looking bottle and the beer is no slouch either."
"Pours a hazy golden, orange color with a massive rocky head. Lots of sticky lacing on the side of my Duvel tulip glass. Aroma was very fruity and spicy, with a good dose of perfumy hops mixed in. Definately smells Belgian. Taste was good, damn good in fact. Good maltiness along with lots of spice(coriander?), fruit(pear mainly and orange) and some peppery notes. Mouthfeel was light-medium and the finish was a perfectly balanced dry-sweet combination. This is an incredible beer that goes down very easily. This is without a doubt one of the top five Tripels/Belgian Strong Golden Ales that I've had. I'm amazed that such a tasty Belgian style beer can come out of the good old USA. Garrett, you've got another winner!"
"Drinkability: Very much so, even on a hot day here in NYC. If you actually do imbibe while mowing the lawn, of course, beware the 9% ABV, which is well concealed but could result in your mowing your neighbors lawn instead of (or in addition to) your own. Another very impressive brew from Garrett Oliver."
"D: I finished it and thought I still had 1/2 a bottle left. That drinkable."
"Pours golden with a slight chill haze. Fairly short head and no real lacing are the only slight dissapointments in this brew. The aroma has light cloves, a touch of banana, and a faint whiff of spice. Pleasant if a little lighter than I would like. The flavor and mouthfeel, however, are home runs. Beautifully balanced and subtle, with the same flavors found in the nose, but some delicious fruitiness as well, perhaps cherrry. The banana and clove are also slightly more pronounced. The finish has a long sustained hit of candi sugar, that almost tastes like palm sugar. Sweet and creamy. The mouthfeel is relatively light and refreshing, but luxuriously creamy and smooth. Each sip I take causes this beer to grow on me more and more. Beautifully drinkable, and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Smell is of doughy yeast, spicy alcohol and lemon zest. Taste is of citrus, bread and yeast, with a peppery and zesty spiciness to it. Some of the spiciness is probably hops. This is velvety smooth, a bit more than medium-bodied with a little spritzy carbonation; fantastic mouthfeel overall. It's weird to describe a 9%er as crisp and refreshing but this one is. Very drinkable. Recommended."
"Brooklyn Local 1 pours a clear light gold with a thick, foamy head. Aroma is sweet pilsner malts and a a dry, chalky yeast flavor. The flavor is dominated by the yeast and spicy alcohol, with a sharp aftertaste. Its a little dry for my taste, but there is a nice sweet malt flavor. The alcohol is definitely present but not really in a negative way."
"Overall its not to bad, easy enough to drink."
"Not a bad version of a Belgian. The flavors of this American version are more subtle. Easy to drink and high ABV is well concealed."
"D: Hands down one of the best Belgian style beers by a non-Belgian brewer. I'm kicking myself for only buying one bottle."
"100% bottle refermented ale  also the back of the bottle states the use of German hops and barley in the beverage. Corked and caged 750 ml bottle from 2007, chilled and poured into tulip glass. Head rose fast, good effervescence, with three fingers of fluffy white foam; retention seems good and lacing apparent. The body is a golden, glowing straw color, with peachy highlights. The nose is quite good, very aromatic with tons of light citrus, minor hints of yeast, definitely pilsner malt in here, with notes of citrus maybe apple, light pear and just a touch pepper. Id like to make a guess on the choice of hops: saaz and maybe styring golden, but thats just a guess. Taste is pleasant and very quaffable. Its very soft on the palate all tough rather complex. Carbonation tickles the tongue just enough, with out being too much, keeps it light and gives it a sense of brevity. The same esters are present in the flavor as in the nose. At the start its rather full and juicy (almost wine like) then finishes rather dry, very good. The bitterness is subtle and doesnt really express its self until the finish, which is prefect for the style. Not quite a sessional beer, but great as suggested. This beer is a pleasure to drink I will definitely buy again for food pairing. Congrats Brooklyn."
"This lovely creation poured a beautiful, light gold with a moderate head and a small amount of retention. Active carbonation from start to finish, but not overpowering. A rich, clean smell with a strong presence of estery oils. Incredibly complex taste that has a unique blend of boldness and mild character that can be as sweet and mild as honey but answers back with a kick of bitterness. Incredibly light and balanced in the mouth with a smooth finish and as drinkable as a big Belgian can get. Great stuff from a great brewery."
"Just starting to get the high-grav's from Brooklyn here. Very anxious to taste this after the review I saw in BA. Pour is clear gold with a nice lace around the glass. Aroma is pears and passion fruit and the taste is dry with strawberries and a tad bit of hop bitterness. Great taste and drinkability hide the alcohol on this beer. Damn tasty and I plan to age another bottle a little to see if it gets any better. Another solid brew from the boys in the borough."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent along with an earthy Belgian yeast aroma. It's fruity with some clove esters. The taste is excellent. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy. It's crisp and refreshing with a hint of warmth in the finish. The yeast esters are in the forefront and continue throughout the drinking experience. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinker. It's refreshing, but with bold flavor and warmth."
"Overall, this is a winner for a Belgian type beer."
"Went extremely well when paired with grilled shrimp and scallops"
"mymrngjckt hooked me up with this one. Big fluffy head and lots of lace, a great golden color, beautiful beer. Full of flavor, all very subtle and blended in perfect harmony. Finishes very dry. The flavor has the essence of chewing on pilsner malt. Very gently hopped. Lots of Belgian yeast aroma. Very subtle alcohol aroma, and it's well hidden, although it comes across as bitter rubbing alcohol when it does. Gentle fruits, like peaches and grapes, and white wine. Mouthfeel is perfect, full of champagne bubbles but never too carbonated. A great US take on Belgian beer, very true to style. This is a must try. Cheers!"
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The color is a hazy pale golden orange color with a fantastic rocky white head, big and pillow, left some nice chunk lacing. The smell is of tart apple, Belgian yeast and some candi sugar. The flavors are earthy, tart apple, spicy, slightly sweet, hint of lemon, a shot of hops in the end, well balanced. IMO this is a saison, good balance between sweet and tart/bitter, granny apple taste. The feel is fizzy and astringent, a bit watery for a saison or BSPA. This is a damn fine offering from Brooklyn, very impressed, and a must try. A very balanced brew."
"Overall, this beer is a terrific example of Belgian strong pale ale (though many consider it a saison). I would highly recommend pairing it with a goat cheese salad or a lighter style fish dish."
"Taste is sweet and fruity, with a bubble gum flavor follow up. A little alcohol flavor is in there as well, but not too strong. But its well noted on the way down, it does warm the chest a little bit. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, the carbonation warms the tongue. I'll be finishing mine tonight, since its open and all."
"Overall a nice beer from Brooklyn. I bought two, was going to age one but I think I will drink both fresh."
"slightly hazy golden color with a nice large white head that leaves patchy lace here and there... phenols in the nose... banana and some tropical fruit... i also get some graham cracker... goes down smooth, light, crisp and bubbly... just the way i like... very drinkable, although i would only take this one alone, kind of like an appertif... just my opinion... good job mr oliver"
"Overall: An excellent take on the style. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass a rich deep golden color with fluffy one finger head that slowly dissipates into a creamy mass leaving streaks of lace behind.Belgian yeast imparting some phenolic aromas as well as some herbal and floral hop notes with an underlying mineral quality to it,wow what a nice creamy mouthfeel full but it glides down with ease.A real central European hop profile in my mind on the palate quite herbal with some grassiness and hints of citrus the Belgian yeast shows itself with gentle phenolic and tropical fruit tones.I liked it much more than I thought I would its very well made and way to easy to drink,well done."
"This is a special brew indeed. The first second it touched my lips all I could think was ""BELGIAN."" It pours a hazy golden color with a huge head that takes days to bubble down. The smell is mediocre, nice and sweet but requires a lot of teasing to fill the nose. But the taste... oh the taste reminds me of my favorite De Jolle brews for sure. The BA review says that basically all of the ingredients come from Belgium, so technically this beer is not from America it would seem (but all the credit goes to Yankee ingenuity). The same sweetness and slight bitterness that we get with all Belgian beers applies to this one. It goes down very easy, almost too easy. The aftertaste is slight but mostly the same sweetness that you taste in the main palate."
"The flavor matches the aroma quite well. A really nice drinker; the 9.0% ABV is present but not distracting."
"Ovr: This and Black chocolate are by far my favorite BB beers. Very good example of a belgia strong. It's heavy and bod yet refreshing."
"Beautiful, classy 750 mL bottle. The Local 1 logo reminds me of Art Deco, but there's still the label on the neck with the Brooklyn ""B". Once uncorked, it poured cloudy gold with a dense head into a tulip Duvel glass -- looked picture perfect and left thin lines to form a delicate lace. Aromas were mostly sweet fruity phenols, floral hops, and yeast. A hint of what's to come. I thought the taste ranked among the best -- lighter and more subtle than Tremens, but with just as much flavor. Incredibly well balanced with sweet light malts up front, tender floral hops in the back with a slight bitterness, and yeasty spice. Full mouthfeel with a dry finish, and an incredibly well-hidden 9% ABV make this, in my opinion, Garrett Oliver's crowning achievement to date. Very pleased."
"Excellent new offering from Brooklyn Brewery, their first in larger format bottles. Beautiful golden colour with a frothy white head. Poured with about an inch and a half of head into a duvel goblet. Smell is crisp and yeasty, hints of spice and light fruit. Nice dry taste, very refreshing. The alcohol is virtually nonexistent in the palate. Spicy and lightly floral, very pleasant interpretation of the style. Mouthfeel is light with pronounced carbonation, very indicative of the style. As for drinkability, I had no trouble polishing off the bottle. A lovely warm weather beer with its bright and refreshing characteristics. Highly recommended."
"It was golden, nice dense and thick white rocky head. Smelled sweet and phenolic. Tasted sweet yet clean with a little fruity/ phenolic tropical fruitiness. Mouthfeel was light to medium and creamy. Smooth and fine carbonation. Quite delicious. I would like to put one aside and see how it dries out after further bottle conditioning. Don't hate me, but I would much rather drink this than Duvel or Delerium Tremens. Way to go Garret!!"
"I aspire to one day brew a beer as elegant as this! Another winner from the crew at the Brooklyn Brewery , I'm looking forward to Brooklyn Local 2."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Somewhat of a hybrid of a belgian strong pale ale and a tripple. Very well made, and an excellent offering from Brooklyn. Well worth seeking out. I wish Mr. Oliver would make this all the time. Highly recommended. I also love the two bands of raised glass on the bottle, reminiscent of those from westvleteren, and other trappist beers in small bottles. Nice tribute..."
"Pours pale golden with a decidedly murky quality from the yeasts. Smells of light lemons and the yeast of course. Taste is VERY yeasty, especially the dredges at the bottom of the bottle. Slight citrus and alcohols are also prevalent. It's not completely Belgian but hey, it's not from Belgium. And, it's a pretty hefty drinker."
"Overall, I really like it. It's not a Belgium ale, but I don't think it's trying to be one either. More crisp. Smooth but with a hoppy snap."
"Poured it out of a tall bottle and it immediately had a golden yellow hue. Lots of head, which settled after a while. The smell was spicy with some yeast with a hint of fruit and hops mixed in. As I tasted the brew, it was a bit bland. However, after a couple of more sips, it became sweeter to the pallate. With the mouthfeel, it became easier to enjoy the brew. As for the drinkability, it is easy to finish off a bottle before you realize that you need more."
"D- This beer is light and crisp but a bit boring. The yeast characteristics were nice but it would be nice to have more depth is such a subtle beer. There was no notice of the alcohol which made this a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a very light, clear straw color. Looks lighter than Coors light (but that is where the similarities end). Thick head of large white bubbles. Head retention is superior. Aroma is of bitter orange peel and spicy yeast. Smell is wonderful. Upon sipping, the first thing that struck me was the medium to heavy body on this one. Nothing like I assumed from the appearance. Maybe a bit to heavy for the style. Creamy with more orange and coriander. Great yeast character. Wonder which one they used? As it warms, the yeast takes on a woody character. Spicy and light bitterness linger long in the aftertaste. Dry finish. Great beer."
"Served in a Duvel tulip, this poured a big golden color, with a frothy white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy, but primarily yeast. Initial sip offered a little more hops than expected, but as it warmed the beer became sweeter, with much more yeast character, and matched the style well. Drinkability was incredible; very little hint of alcohol, with a smooth aftertaste."
"Edit: When I first reviewed this beer is was classified as a BSPA. The characteristics showed nothing close to the style therefore I rated it a tad low. I will have to try it again and re-review."
"This is a nice brew. It boasts a lot of flavour and blends everything together quite nicely. Not my favourite style in the world, but this one is good enough that I'd be more than happy to go back to it again, and certainly plan to do so..."
"Firstly, what is 100% bottle re-conditioned. How could you have any other percentage besides 0 or 100? Anyway, I was excited to try this beer but it kind of let me down. It pours a straw/light amber color with a thick off white head. The aroma is the classic fruity yeasty belgian funky aroma that I expected. The flavor is not as good as I had hoped though. The alcohol is very evident in the flavor and gives a pronounced warming in my mouth throat, and stomach. It has a malty fruity taste with a very strong spiciness. It is a bit sweeter than I would have liked."
"Ultimately, VERY drinkable. Frightingly so given the ABV. It was a great way to start the evening. I think it would've paired well with the crabcake appetizers, but we drank it all down before the food hit the table!"
"Overall though, this is a very good beer and quite a difference from the Brooklyn beers you're used to. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed."
"Shipped to me by Sulldaddy in a champagne-size bottle, it pours a pale yellow, chilled into a tulip glass with some haze. The head towers above, white, loose, but clingy and spongy. Aroma is slightly fruity (white grapes and lemon) with a nice amount of cloves or nutmeg as well that really spices it up. Just a twinge of alcohol also hits my nose along with possibly some slight yeast. Flavor sips at first quite sweet with reminders of pears along with some citrus fruit and some spice. Alcohol quickly coems in to dry out the body, which is medium at most with a slight bit of yeast flavors. The body again is medium, and the combined carbonation and alcohol phenols quikly make this a bit bitey on the tongue. However, this is scarily drinkable! Oh God, a whole bottle all by myself? I guess I'll take one for the team..."
"D - A good Belgian, but overall not a great one imo. It may have been that my expectations were out of porportion, but the depth was less than extraordinary. It has the kick of generous alcholic presence, pleasant odors, but the taste left me wanting more. overall a good representation of the style, though."
"Sweet, but not overly sweet. It's a dry sweetness that isn't thick on the palate. Spices, orange peel, lemon zest, with some pepper flavors. Yeasty with slight bready notes, though they don't leave that usual chalky mouthfeel. Dry mouthfeel with a lemony finish that doesn't pucker the lips. Spritzy bubbles remind me of champagne a bit and tend to take over the later half of the mouthfeel I'm not sure this is a belgian strong ale. I think I'd stick it under the saison or a strong saison. A nice one from Brooklyn."
"Poured from the .750ml into my DFH snifter. A pretty pale golden straw color with a fat and frothy thick white head. Lots of carbonation. Nice foam retention and some lace. Smells malty sweet with spices and some citrus. Maybe cloves? A pleasant aroma; not overwhelming. Subtle hints of peppery pineapple. Very nice. The taste here is delicious. A musky malt flavor throughout, with notes of pepper and clove. Slight lemon character in there. Has a dry white wine quality to it as well. Leaves a pungent but unoffensive bitterness in the back of the mouth upon the finish. Definitely more complex and more enjoyable after it warms up a bit. True to the style, for sure, but this definitely maintains an American craft brew signature. Garrett Oliver and company have done well with this one. The alcohol is masked well, although you know you're drinking something above par when you first taste this. Smooth mouthfeel. An all-around solid and drinkable beer."
"Nice job Brooklyn! Very solid offering."
"Aftertaste is a combination of pineapple and alcohol warmths."
"Superb offering from a solid brewery. This one would go great by itself as a preview to a pork dinner. Definitely pick up at least on to try. This should become a regular in Brooklyn's line-up."
"Interesting brew. despite the cloying sweetness, it really is a nice product. pick up a bottle or 2 if you get the chance!"
"Was excited to try this one as Saisons are my favorite style. Poured a straw color and fluffy white head. That funky smell was not present that i was expecting along the Saison Dupont style. The taste is a little weak but definite spiceness comes through in the end. I would try this one again but its a ways behind Saison Dupont and Hennepin."
"Drinkability: Very, the big bottle didn't last long."
"drinkability  Was glad and surprised to find this. I like looking for limited or seasonal brews. Would buy this one again. Enjoyed it with some meatloaf today."
"This beer could stand up against many of the belgian representations of this style. It's extremely drinkable and one of the very best I've had from Brooklyn."
"Drinkability: superb. This beer was enjoyable from start to finish, and what planned to be a Brooklyn and one other bomber evening, turned into a two Brooklyn bomber-only session. I'll be picking more of this up. Love this beer."
"Easy to drink, good carbonation. Among the best domestic Saisons available here, right next to Hennepin, but with it's own distinguished character."

"Yet another excellent showing from the folks at Brooklyn Brewing."
"Overall, one of the better American Belgian styles (I thought). Very drinkable, very potent. Well balanced. Only complaint would be that the spices could be toned down a notch."
"Very impressive in hiding the 9% abv. Not a great tasting Saison, but unique enough to grab a bottle for a try."
"This is a beer that really defies styles. Part German lager, part Belgian golden and a big part saison. This is really the kind of beer I've been waiting on from Brooklyn. Daring and pushing the envelope of what beer can be. Could use a little bit of aging to bring the bitterness down, but other that... nice beer."
"Drinkability: At 9% ABV, I wouldn't normally give this a good score, but this thing is just so damn tasty that I could seriously sip it all night."
"This beer rocks!!! It's a saison all the way. It's closest to DuPont Avec... However it doesn't have the cognac taste. It is beguiling.It's actually a changeling...the flavor goes from sweet to citric...I'd prefer you to drink it in lieu of telling you about it. Somethings are better left unsaid. Garrett...your love of the style shines through. Thank you...Case up...and make this a regular offering particularly in Chicago please."
"Interesting looking 25oz'er pours clear golden with a white head that does leave some lacing behind on the glass. Aroma shows some sweetness/fruitiness, but mostly yeastiness. Flavor too is full of yeastiness with a bit of spice. 9% alcohol is clearly there, limiting drinkability & adding to an already somewhat dryish finish. Somewhat spritzy carbonation levels. Interesting beer for sure, but not really much like other Saisons I've had, perhaps more like the Strong Goldens? (or a ""smaller"" Tripel)"
"Found Brooklyn's Local 1 to be a great offering, it was very refreshing and crisp. The higher alcohol didn't overpower the flavor. The aroma was amazing, it just kept pulling me back for one more sniff. I will be looking forward to Brooklyn's next big bottle beer."
" Sure, it took a lot of getting used to, and the alcohol can be felt here, but this is to be savored and enjoyed at a comfortable clip. There's no hop bitterness here, and the quality of the ingredients really stands out since this is solid from start to finish. It's hard to picture this as a saison, since the bottle fermentation leads me to believe this is a more Belgian-type style than that. No matter - Brooklyn's to be commended for going out on a limb, coming up with another Milton Glaser-packaged gem, and for brewing in the Borough that it calls home. Here's hoping that the Express 2 is on it's way down the track!"
"D-I could suck this down if it was cheaper. I wouldnt call this a Saison and i think it is mislabeled on this site. This is almost more like a Belgian Pale, or a light Tripel. This one is hard to score because it doesnt fit squarely into a traditional style. In the end this is a tasty beer and one i will be getting again."
"Overall disappointed. With the smell and pour I was ready for fireworks. It tastes more like a wheat than a typical saison. I know this one was brewed and bottled differently than most as with a Belgium twist, but overall for the style the taste didnt do it for me. I hope time will make this one better, or maybe this could be reclassified closer to a belgium pale (reminds me of Orval)."
"9% abv will prevent you from drinking too much of this beer, but over quite a few hours and a bunch of spicy seafood (calamari with hot sauce and shrimp fra diablo in my case) you can put down a fair amount of this fine beer I like to call, 'Belgium in Brooklyn'!"
"Drinkability  I thought this was off from the style but not a bad mix of ingredients."
"750 mL bottle bought from DAG in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Usually these corks are easier to get out, oh well. Poured a cloudy orange color. Lovely. It had a nice fluffy 1"" head. Fruity/citrus smell, then flavor. Mouthfeel is right on. Nice and quaffable, almost chewy. Fairly drinkable, but one bottle is enough. Very good over all. I was very excited about this release, but I think I will be sticking with Hennepin in the future....actually I'll probably have a few more this year. But Hennepin is about half the price for similar quality."
"Pours an almost clear perfect gold color with a sticky bright white head that leaves lacing and a collar. Very intriguing aroma of interesting sweet aromatics (left over from the sugar, I assume) along with some earthy hop notes and a slightly oxidized (after some time warming up in the glass) pearish smell. On the palate, huge carbonation and a touch of that Mauritian sugar, followed by substantial hop bitterness and raw alcohol. Some spiciness comes out at the finish (tastes like a yeast byproduct, not added spices), which is quite dry and long. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation, with some hoppy acidity but also some residual sugar making for a medium body. The mouthfeel is what places this somewhere between a dry saison and a thicker, sweeter Belgian golden ale. Overall, this is quite an interesting brew, sitting as it does between two famous and important styles. It will be interesting to see how this brew ages, but for right now it combines some of the better characteristics of each style without sacrificing much in the way of flavor or mouthfeel."
"Brooklyn Local 1 easily holds its own with those big boys (or ladies as they may be). Found my 750 mL bottles for 9.99 (or a 2 for $16) on Freshdirect.com. Beer delivered to your door. It's good to be alive."
"Kudos to Garrett Oliver for producing the best new beer, and perhaps best beer period to grace my lips yet this year."
"Mouthfeel is a little oily. Carbonation is light. All around it's a good beer, not greatly impressive to me, and I don't think I'm missing the point of the style. It just doesn't suit me incredibly well."
"Interesting bottle, caged and corked, no freshness indication. Pours light yellow , cloudy, supporting a long lasting fluffy looking near white head. Leaves nice looking splotchy/spotty and ringed lacing. Nice looking beer. Bright, fresh smelling. Notes of more lime, pepper, yeast, grassy, smells so good, time to dive in for a swig. More lime, Belgiany yeast, peppery spice, gin, honey, melon, soap, yum, sucker for the style and this one has got it going on. Fine creation from Brooklyn. Looking forward to trying it with a nice summer meal, salad, cheeses, chicken, fish, BBQ etc. Wide and year round distribution in the NYC area hopefully...life is good..."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a large white frothy head. The head leaves great lacing and lasts along time. The color is alot lighter than other strong ales,but it does look good. The smell is pungent with sweet malt,alcohol,lemon,pepper,and corriander. The smell is candy sugar,lemon,wheat,pepper,and alcohol. Not ,bad,but I have to say this is more like a Saison than a strong ale. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. A very good beer that I think is listed in the wrong style."
"Brooklyn meets Belgium -- two of my favorite beer sources -- in the latest offering from the Brooklyn Brewery. The Local 1 comes in an unusual 750-ml bottle (the cursive, trademark ""B" is etched subtly into the neck of the bottle and absent entirely from the large label). This batch is brewed using 100 percent refermentation--a rare method in which the beer is conditioned within the bottles, not before--giving it a natural effervescence. The resulting ale has a rich, golden color with a cloudy head that never entirely disappears and leaves a bubbly lace residue when swirled in the glass (I used a wine glass). Aromatic and sweetly scented. It's light on the tongue but has a complex flavor, with a hint of honey that masks the high alcohol content (9% ABV), and no bitter aftertaste."
"When did Williamsburg get moved to Belgium? And did anyone alert the (wannabe/ex-) hipsters? Seriously though, this has become my favorite American Belgian-style ale, and is easily one of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales overall. This is an excellent ale, and any fan of the style owes it to themselves to give it a try."
"D: The ale is very drinkable. The abv is moderate and the spice profile is a strong enough to make this an enjoyable beer."
