Pours moderately cloudy golden color with a 3 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Great dense foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, bread, candi sugar, light pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, light banana, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian strong pale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 10, 2014"

Strong fruity esters like apple cider, and yeasty all over the place(even pouring gently and leaving an inch), and tasted very sweet on the tip of the tongue, a solid carbonation bite with a slight bitterness to the back but nothing much and no hop presence at all. I was hoping that it would warm up well, but seemed to get thinner and the 9% alcohol really expanded and filled my mouth. It comes in a sharp bottle with a guillotine on the front, so I had hope for a bit more. Good if it's in front of you and you like Huyghe.

Smell was excellent, fruit throughout such as cherries, apples, passionfruit, pineapple. There was also a light medicinal smell in there. Taste was amazing, juicy fruit, and sweet sugary honey dominated, with some mild sour trangs coming through as it went towards the back of the palate. It was somewhat syrupy, maybe due to the honey tastes I noticed. As for drinkability, My God if only I had this beer around every night, I would be in sheer bliss.

Cloudy, peachy, yellow in some light, light brown in others. The appearance is everything a Belgian strong ale should be. The aroma is super sweet, strongly fruit-filled, and syrupy. Apricot, peach, and tart candy. Mmm. The strongly sweet aroma gets high praise from sweet-beer lovers. There is a creamy quality about the aroma as well, and the yeasty freshness is superbly appetising. The taste is very much like wine or sherry, along with some ultra-sweet fruit brandies I have tasted. The phenolic taste is not overwhelming, though very tangible: otherwise there are sweet malt, apricot and berries of various sorts, mint, and earthy yeast tastes, leaving a dry puckering mouth sensation. The finish, though, is extremely alcoholic, leaving the tongue with a warming, burning feel, which is the only reason this is not an easily drinkable beer. High carbonation, and full-bodied. No, this is enjoyable only perhaps occasionally, and certainly no more than two in the same session. High carbonation, and full-bodied. This is more akin to a fruit brandy or port. Phenomenal.","Cwrw","Jul 18, 2004"

Spicy nose, peppery, clove and banana, sweetish fruit like peach or apricot, some boozy pear, sweet malt. Flavour is peachy and peppery, boozy malt finish, but that taste of fruit comes back to linger on the aftertaste. Big boozy mouthfeel, the alcohol definitely makes its presence known.
