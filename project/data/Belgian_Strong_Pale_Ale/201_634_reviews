"O: An enormous beer with a suprising amount of balance."

"I had glasses of foam to start with. Lots of suspended sediment too.  Once the dust settled, it was way too boozy with no depth or quality."

"The body of the beer is medium, and the feel is semi-sweet with just a bit of leafy dryness on the tongue. Crispness is sharp and stays the whole way through. A sort of tartness the palate can feels lingers with a hint of sugars."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a huge 3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Overall: Another great beer from De Dolle. I've yet to have a beer from these guys that wasn't very good. As far as I'm concerned, they're one of the most underrated breweries in the world. If you're a fan of Belgian beers, this is definitely worth picking up."

"on tap at the bull and bush, who have really expanded their guest offerings in the last half year or so. this is my first from these guys (i think), a real treat. listed on the menu at 8.9% abv rather than the 10% abv listed here, but i am attributing that to batch variance rather than misinformation. a great beer, a spring strong blonde brewed with honey. it looks, smells, and tastes a lot like a classic tripel, maybe a little lighter in body, a little more aggressively hopped, and a little lighter on the leftover sugar, but the belgian yeast, pale wheat based body, and booze component are all on par with the style. some floral character to this, and a real easy drinking lightness for its enormity. i know this isnt one of the rare crazy beers from these guys, but its a heck of an introduction to a very storied brewery for me. i know i am late to the party, but this one has me keen for more. so dry in feel, and for a fuller bodied strong beer, its a nice touch. cool yeast, not overdone, and nice crispy carbonation. top tier brew, just a little less interesting than i hoped for, but real yummy."

"O: similar to, but less fruity and dynamic than Arabier... pretty straight-forward offering from De Dolle - no problem with that... would likely kill it accompanying greasy mussels or breaded calamari - feel like it's lonely on its own"

"A little hot, but great subtlety of malt and sweet/bitter balance. Belgian yeast esters are lovely."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty funky BSPA. The 4 years on this obvious has intensified the effects. Interesting heavy sweetness balancing it out. Hard to gauge this one, very interesting."
""
"Overall, I am really disappointed. I thought the age wouldn't really hurt this beer but it obviously has. A couple years might have been ok but five or six is just too much. A shame."
""
""
"Extremely drinkable for its weight, this is a very well-crafted beer. Although I know a session of these would be a foolish thing to do, the characters of the beer almost make me want to attempt it. Very nice stuff indeed."

"Pours a murky light brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and lots of various fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, grain, and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a very nice fruity presence that makes this one quite easy to drink."

"Overall, excellent. A really good (and distinctive) beer from a really good brewery."

"Bos Keun has a gorgeous cloudy auburn color, with a bleached-white, billowing tower of bubbles rising with even the most miniscule pouring effort. This head is similar to angel's food cake... somehow, it has mass but it's very light and airy. The amount of bubbling is almost too much, but I did not score this very negatively due to some of the other classic Belgians, like Duvel, having this effect. Of course with this type of head we get excellent lacing as a result. The smell is very syrupy sweet, like toffee and taffy, along with tropical fruits and the signature whiff of Belgian yeast. I found the flavor to be reminiscent of caramel apples at the fair, very tart, and slightly astringent. Delicious pear and citrus esters as well. The mouth feel is somewhat viscous, and the finish was very sharp. Overall, this is right up there with the other exquisite brews from De Dolle. This is a top Belgian Brewer that any fan of the style must try."

"[O] Age hasn't treated this one well. I'd like to try this one again soon, but I'll go for a fresh bottle next time. Three plus years was just too long."
""
""
""
"Its so effervescent but smooth. Nicely boozey and such an easy drinker. Really great brew. Highly recommend this...especially on a nice warm afternoon."
"Cheers!"
""

"O: This is probably my favorite beer from De Dolle. I have had it many times, even at the brewery after a fabulous tour by the brewer's mother. I love what he is doing there and this is a beer worth having and a different take on the style."
""
"If I had to choose one word to describe this beer, it would be ""difficult."" Trying to pour this into a mug resulted in the entire mug being filled with nothing but foam and a mouthful of beer on the bottom. Going down and finishing had a very bitter taste, however as it passed through my mouth, the taste was actually quite good. Still, not enough to save this beer for me"
""
""
"The beer is pale yellow with a huge, dense, cap of foam. Excellent retention and lacing. The aroma brings floral hops, yeast, light funk, subtle citrus. Smells great. The flavor takes it up a notch. 10% abv?!? Where? Grapefruit rind and beautiful Belgian pale ale character. Dry finish with plentiful hop bitterness. Probably my favorite of this genre."
"OVERALL: A fine dry strong pale ale from Belgium. Good flavor, feel and overall drink-ability. The bottle used for this review was bottled in February 2010 and has really developed well."
""
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a nice orange color with a massive white head and high carbonation. Aroma of sweet malt, fresh mixed light fruit Flavor is tasty light and dark fruits with Belgian spice, both sweet and slightly sour. Tastes very good. Slightly marred by over-carbonation, which gives a nice hot element to the taste, but is a bit overdone. A very complex, unusual and tasty ale."
""
""
"Overall it comes across as a strangely hoppy bitter crisp wine which is real interesting. I wonder how different this was to when I had it on tap? Gotta check those BA notes!"
""
"Nice one."
""
""
"Notes: Served from bottle at Cafe Bruges in Carlisle PA. Been on lookout for this brew since first reading about it on the beer of the day calendar about three years past. Worth the wait for Belgium pale ale lovers."
"Pairs well with a delicious pizza with marinated steak and Gorgonzola."

"D- what a great beer. Like many; 've always considered Duvel to be the archetype, but this yeasty monster rabbit surpasses what I consider to be 'standard' by taking the aroma to a whole nother level. Like an outer space level. Clean, defined flavors overlayed by muddy earthy funky yeast make for a beautiful marriage that no other BSPA I've had so far has achieved."
"Impressive - an incredible array of fruity notes accompany this beer. Strong and well-balanced, with a range of flavours that is both subtle and complex. It's difficult to compare this to anything else I've tried - it's unique. Not a brew for everyday quaffing, but well worth trying if you come across it."

"Foam bomb from the tap, this one had to settle for a few minutes. Served in a Chimay chalice, a honey brown color, slightly cloudy, with a huge rocky, tan-white head that retained well and coated the glass with decorative lacing. Aroma was booze-heavy, phenols, yeast, more yeast, and a bit herbal when all that mellowed out a bit. Taste was extremely potent, strong with grainy alcohol, a concentrated dose of meadow grass and flowers hitting soon after that, lighter notes of peppery yeast and citrus pith. Strong, but flavorful. A little too hot to be exceptionally drinkable I'm afraid, but still a fine brew overall. Maybe let this one sit in the cellar for a year or even more to mellow out before serving."
"After my disappointments with the Dolle Brouwers, this is a nice suprise!"
""
""
"D: Delicious beer! This one is just excellent"
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer"
""
""
"Drink- This was a tasty little beer from Belgium. Thanks Chris. I love De Dolle from the few I have had and this was another great offering from them."
""
"O: Going to have to find a new bottle of this beer, because I definitely feel it has exceptional qualities. Perhaps the one I picked up was stored improperly."
"Overall I am not sure where I could even get a bottle or six pack and the full pour was around 9 buck (can you say overpriced?) but if I ever was around Belgium this would be my go to pale ale no second guessing."
""
"33cl bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Brewed Feb 2010. You could tell there was going to be a lot of carbonation when I popped the cap. Poured a very hazy pale gold with a massive big bubbled white head. Bottle conditioned. Complex aroma with Belgian spice, dark sugar and a little alcohol. Heavier side of medium bodied. Lots of carbonation, fairly dry. Spicy flavor, solid malt base, but not a lot of sweetness. Dry finish. Very drinkable at 10%. Didn't get a lot of alcohol in the flavor, just a little in the aroma. Good stuff."

"O. I was impressed with this one. Really like the flavor and mouthfeel. Pretty complex taste of fruit, spice, and yeast flavors. Sweet flavors, but drinks dry. Well crafted brew."
""
""
"O: The beer has a very good balance and is easy to drink. It seems to exhibit some properties of a “strong saison”."
""
""

"Nice sweet grainy malt with a distinctively fruity yeast presence. Like an alcohol-infused watermelon with freshly steeped grains injected into it. Interesting and unique. Fairly tasty too...Hoppy Easter, Santa Claus!"
"Pours a pale straw color with a little dash of red. Just a tad of haze too. A HUGE super frothy 4 finger slightly off white head fills half the glass and is very slow to receded. Smells of Belgium yeast dominate the aroma. First sip is surprisingly quite creamy with floral yeast notes and sweet malts blending well together. The spice is low and lemony but not overpowering. Pretty nice brew. The 10% ABV is extremely well hidden"

"Pours golden amber in color.Slightly cloudy while yeast sediments go down.White rocky foam.Incredible high thick long lasting layer. Small bubbled creamy head.Yeast & spices to the nose. Honey sweet mouthfeel & mildy tartar aftertaste. Just an ok beer."
"I was completely unfamiliar with this bee when I ordered it, unsure of what I'd get. What I got, however, was a very pleasant surprise, one which I would definitely have again."
"Overall, this is a really good belgian strong golden ale. The ABV is slightly noticeable, but a good drinking ale in moderation."
"Overall this is an epic beer for the style from one of the top breweries on Earth - thanks De Dolle!"
"Poured all head, white, and very slow to recede, I almost thought it was permanent. Smells of dried fruit and malt. Taste is fairly rich like with a long malty finish. Quite nice. And though there's 10% alcohol it's pretty well hidden to me. The cheesey bunny on the label had me doubting this beer but it turned out to be really good."
"not impressed for the price and other ratings. ive had much better belgian strong pales."
" Pours a light brown w/ a two finger head. Nice carbonation and good lacing. Nose is nice, sweet fruit, sour, floral, slight malt as well. Taste brings out the nose plus some honey and plum. This is a solid tasting beer. Mouthfeel is medium and aftertaste sticks around for a while. Really glad I got to try this beer- never seen it before. Check it out!"
"Overall this is pretty good, but it got old fast, the taste and aroma just tend to get cloying and unappetizing after a while."
"Some really nice qualities here; however, the intense flavors could really use some time to mature and mellow."
"O-This beer is a great example of what makes De Dolle so unique. Stands apart from almost every other Belgian Pale ale."
"Big hot candied pale ale. Interesting choice to use Goldings; makes a difference. Burn makes me think maybe shoulda let this age, though it is a seasonal."
"This might be my favorite Belgian Strong Pale Ale; I highly recommend it!"
"Nice light body here but as with most of De Dolle beers I feel like this one is a little bit overcarbonated. I'd love to see them tone it down. Overall though, a great offering. One of the better strong pales on the market. Probably my favorite."
"overall another outstanding beer from an outstanding brewer"
"O/D - Not too shabby but not great. I drank it, didn't say 'wow' and was ready for something new."
"O - This beer strikes a lovely balance, with just enough bitterness and dryness on the finish, while leaving just a wisp behind that invites another sip, maybe too soon. This is a dangerously drinkable, while still rich, strong beer."
"O-this is definitely a good beer. it is very complex, though i feel this makes the beer rather harsh. this is definitely not for beginners. with this, the more i drink it the more i like it.the ABV is not evident anywhere in the taste. i would've guessed between 6-7%. i probably won't be getting this again. i feel the Stille Nacht is leagues beyond this still."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is high. Overall it was a pretty good beer of the style. The yeast spice really balanced well with the sweeter, crisp fruit flavors. Overall very smooth, flavorful and easy drinking for the style and abv. Very good beer overall."
"This is an excellent beer, but i think it has some flaws"
"Overall: This beer is a winner in my book. A complex and comforting Easter beer that successfully embodies the the season."
"Pours a hazy golden with the massive carbonation typical of De Dolle. The meringue-like head eventually settles leaving bits of cotton candy-like lace. Smells of marizpan, sugared-white peach and mango. Taste is complex and sweet, but balanced by more bracing bitterness than I recall. A sort of creme brulee like sweetness shows up as the beer warms up near room temperature. Very tasty."
"Quit a good beer with potent powers in it."
"The beer actually looks somewhat beautiful, with a great contrast between the cloudy orange brew and its stark white head. The aroma has a nice fruit base (lighter fruits - citrus and apple, maybe), but is still complex beyond that, slightly bready and quite yeasty. On sipping - oh my. I really enjoyed the EES mentioned above, but the extremity of its taste cost it some drinkability. BK, on the other hand, I could drink this all day. Very different from its outlandish cousin. It's consistent and creamy, and the sweet, light fruits come together wonderfully with the choice of malt. A kind of medium gravity pear/mango experience with the perfect amount of bitterness throughout. After my next long day, I'll be sure to toil through the pour for this awesome reward."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: While I enjoyed drinking this one overall, I thought there was just a touch too much sweetness in the mix for the complexity to balance out. I could see having it again as a special occasion beer but I’d not want it on a regular basis. My overall impression is that it is a well made holiday beer and best consumed as a holiday treat."
"O: This brewery is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries anywhere in the world."
"Drinkability: Tasty, though expensive and I can actually feel the carbonation fill my stomach. Would be interested in having it on tap, but otherwise it was just OK."
"D) Another great beer from the folks at De Dolle. Be careful with this one -- 10% ABV"
"O- A very nice drinker and you wouldn't think it's 10% alcohol at all. It comes of very refreshing and seems like a pale that was hopped a little more and had some candi added, but doesn't spill the beans as to it's potency."
"Violent carbonation led to a glass full of foam. Eventually a cloudy golden liquid fills the glass with a large head. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is slightly vinous with pale malt, mild spice, and some herbalness. The flavor is not as dry as many big pale Belgians. Hints of tropical fruit, pears, and just a faintest hint of tart apple. Other than being overcarbonated, the body is spot on. The bottle was just too overcarbonated and it was annoying to pour this beer. Otherwise a great BSPA."
"I can't believe how well this drinks, no negative flavors can be attributed to alcohol presence and it's actually somewhat refreshing, very hard to believe it's a 10% beer. I actually didn't expect too much out of this one for whatever reason and was very pleasantly surprised, I'm going to have to pick up more. Good work De Dolle!"
"cheers"
"D- easy to drink and something that i would gladly try again. next time ill try to find a fresher bottle so i can compare. i thought that this one might have been past its prime because of the floaters and the sour aroma, but it is not. i really like de dolle."
"My first De Dolle beer, finally. Used a Chimay chalice glass. Pours a slightly hazy, golden yellow colour with a lot of head on the pour. Tastes of sweet candied sugars with a green apple/pear fruit finish. I thought this finished very smooth and its incredibly drinkable for 10% alc. Very impressed with this beer."
"Pours a light peach color with a ridiculously long-lasting white head. Pretty bubbly with some nice streaky lacing. the nose is yeasty with a bit of spice and fruit; maybe some pear. The taste is quite yeasty with some mild spice and a bit of light fruit. There is green pear and some stone fruits. The nose is slightly buttery as it warms. Not diacetyl--it's more of a chardonnay-type butter character. The taste is pretty good but drops off from the nose. Dry spice takes over in the finish. Drinks pretty well, though isn't quite the top 50 Belgian beer I had hoped for."
"Pours very hazy with a copper color and orange hues. An extremely large head due to the over-carbonation; good lacing. Nose reminds me of fresh green apples and cider, slightly yeasty. Very pleasant nose. The taste is fantastic, fresh apples, pale malt, light white pepper from the yeast and other sharp spices all from the yeast. Very creamy mouth-feel, the beer was a slight gusher and it was confirmed to be over-carbonated once in the mouth. Overall, a very pleasant beer that has some very positive notes but it just misses pulling it all together to be one of the best."
"Review from notes. Tasted from a gusher of a bottle at Lush West Town. Pours cloudy yellow with a huge white head that leaves heavy lace. Nose is anise, something herbal, yeast, and something slightly sour. Flavor is sweet with caramel malt, chocolate, cinnamon, clove, coriander, and citrus. The body is full with light carbonation and a long warming finish."
"D: very good for a 10% beer but the sweetness would limit it for me. I'm not sure if I would be able to have more than one at a time, but that one is going down rather well. If I drank it as warm as it was at the end of the bottle, 2 probably wouldn't be hard to have."
"Poured a cloudy orange with good carbonation for a two-finger head and lace patches. A citrusy smell as well as some pale and sweet malt smells. Light and prickly thanks to some spices and sharp carbonation. Has some fruit tastes like a minor tropical fruit taste as well as citrus/orange w/ that typical Belgian yeast strain. Also some sweetness like caramel and honey w/ the sweet and fruit/hoppy flavors well balanced for a very tasty and enjoyable brew. Scarier still is not only the complexity and balance but the ABV is rather well-hidden so this could be a dangerous sipper."
"Beer is light in body and really bright on the palate but finishes completely clean. It reminds me a little of Unibroue beers. Some alcohol up front with minimal sweetness, finishes not dry but wet. It's highly drinkable and I would have this again, for sure. A really nice BSPA."
"Notes: I'm not sure it's a BSPA, but it's very tasty. Almost like a Belgian Barleywine or Belgian Wheat wine. Slick and sweet it hides the ABV very well. Makes a nice treat on a chilly October night."
"Awesome."
"D: Delicious beer! My third De Dolle. This one is just excellent as the others"
"In short: a characterful beer that abounds with fruity flavors and spicy nature."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer. It is hurt a little by slightly too prominent alcohol, but overall its fantastic. I dont want it to end."
"D: This was a very tasty beer; not quite light or dark, but quite complex and enjoyable. The alcohol was noticeable but not bad, so it was fairly easy to drink. The flavors were incorporated together exceptionally well for perfect balance. Some age might further enhance this, but it was very nice fresh."
"The epidome of this style seems to be Duvel with Leffe Blonde comming in later. Bos Keun reminds me much more of the Leffe but with bolder Belgian-y notes, higher dryness, and deeper over all complexity. If you like Leffe, you'll wecome this beer very very very well."
"D: An extremely well made, drinkable beer."
"d: well i like this beer, but at 10% and the back in sweetness make it hard to drink more than 1, which sadly is unlike a good triple, and so i hate to down rate it some."
"The cute demented bunny on the label knows what's in store when you pour this beauty into a snifter. A cloudy dull golden color works under a dense white head that holds strong throughout the enjoyment of this. I detected an aroma of sweet citrus and slight hint of what I could only describe as ""wool"". This introduced itself to me with a highly carbonated fruity and tart upfront and center mouthfeel that continues into a fizzy explosion of flavor and fizzy berry aftertaste. Delicious, refreshing, and a great compliment to Moules & Frietjes. Can't wait to drink this again..."
"Bos Keun is a bit of a revelation to me. This is my first offering from De Dolle and it is tremendous. The $6 price tag is substantial (it would probably be closer to $10 had I bought it in my homestate of PA), but worth it as an infrequent treat. As you can tell from my avatar I hold Duvel in very high regard, and this beer is easily as good. This is certainly worthy of its lofty BA rating. I'm going to have to stop putting off cracking open that De Dolle Oerbier I have waiting in my cellar!"
"Drinkability- I have had some De Dolle beers that didn't hit the mark, but this one is one I would come back to despite my initial fears. Drink it fresh or aged well, I'm sure it will hold up fine."
"OVERALL: A very spicy and alcoholic beer, but enjoyable non-the-less. A tasty, spicy treat, but a bit too raw on the palate to be overly drinkable. One worth trying if you get the chance."
"Overall, I *really* liked this after not particularly digging the Dulle Teve and the Stout. Nice one for sure!"
"D-i think this was in the early stage of an infection, it didn't really taste infected but it fizzed up like crazy. interesting stuff and i'll definitely have to try another."
"This is a quirky brew, it is pretty blunt in the flavor department and overall."
"Another solid beer from De Dolle, this brewery is great, although I still believe the Oerbier to be the crown jewel."
"Bos Keun pours out a murky gold color, with a massive amount of white heading. Tropical fruit smells lift from the beer, with some dry champagne character. The fruit takes center stage taste wise, It is definitely on the sweet side, but does end on a somewhat bitter, hoppy note. Mouthfeel is medium, not boozy, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I am not having any problems finishing this bottle, but I prefer this style when it is more dry and balanced. The alcohol is hidden well, which is a plus."
"Extremely drinkable for being 10% alcohol content. The flavors, carbonation, and lacing of the head made for a enjoyable experience."
"Overall a very nice beer, to date I've liked everything I've tried from De Dolle."
"D: I think this is a great easter beer fom the du dolle brewery, glad I had a chance in finding one of these. Will try to find another bottle."
"D- Drinks well, but too sweet and strange for more than one bottle in a sitting. Alcohol presence also cuts the drinkability."
"D - This is one of the most easily palatable of De Dolle's offerings. Very drinkable."
"For reviewing purposes I've graded greatly down for mouthfeel because of carbonation issue. However, nose, flavors and finish were super solid. I'm hoping carbonation is an issue that will be more insignificant in other bottles."
"Notes: Like I said this bottle was a gusher, but luckily I was able to grab a glass and only lose a little bit of beer. Lots of fruit, particularly citrus that has some slight tartness in the middle, but is predominantly sweet (although not cloying by any means). A very nice beer that is easy to drink, but nothing particularly special about it."
"overall a pretty good strong belgian ale, a little on the sour side with sweetness coming through."
"Tasty, and very easy to drink - and once again, hard to believe that this packs 10%."
"D: My favourite new beer of the young year. De Dolle continues to impress and push the boundaries. I have a couple De Dolles left and plan to buy the remaining available ones when I go back to the store. A must try."
"D: Very high given the abv at 10 %. This beer reminds me of Duvel in many ways only it is far more intense. More fruit and more spice.. Amazing beer"
"Review from notes taken on: 10/6/09."
"d- For a 10% abv this one drinks like a champ. De Dolle never disappoints, and nothing beats sitting around listening to Om (or whatever your doom metal of choice is) with a BosKeun and some triple cream cheese. Recommended."
"33 cl bottle poured into Unibroue tulip. A bizzare brown rabbit adorns the bottle and he appears to be high or drunk (Boskeun in hand I presume?). As expected, the bottle slowly gushed forth before the pour. Can't locate bottle date, I think it wore off the cap. Head retains for quite a while, it looks soft, I'd like to take a nap on its pillowey bubbles. Aroma is bursting out of the tulip as the head reduces. Smells like peaches, a little funk, and a slight alcohol burn. The mouthfeel stands out on this one as the flavors coat the tongue front to back. Certainly doesn't taste at all like a 10% ABV, a testament to how well the flavors are melded together. The flavors are all over the map and they seem to be changing as the temperature of the beer warms. Fruit sweetness mixes with funk to create a delicious treat. Paired well with a deep fried blue cheese ball."
"This is delicious, warming beer. High-marks all around."
"Overall this was a great beer for the style and the flavors are all huge and present in perfect amounts. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - Pretty high, especially considering this is a 10%er. This could knock you out."
"D- Moderate. Went down easy. I enjoyed many things about this beer. I was confounded by the flavor profile, though. I don't know if I'm too much of a greenhorn to grasp all the things this beer has going for it. I think I'll have some more BSPAs and come back to this one, re-reviewing if necessary."
"Unique and exceptional ale, which never fails to impress me. The best beer for Spring I've imbibed (whatever the time of year)."
"Overall, an amazing beer from De Dolle, as I've come to expect. The complexity and variety of aromas and flavors is truly exceptional."
"Amazing nose of peach with a high, frothy, long lasting head with an almost soapy mouthfeel. Flavor profile is not as sweet as the nose says it should be, and by the second sip notes of applewood become prominent. Extremely interesting but difficult to drink more than one. Best used as an aperitif."
"D - I'm starting to like this style more and more...a strong Belgian with a mouthfeel that leaves you wanting more and an ABV that says whoa"
"Full bodied. Great, great offering from De Dolle."
"The taste is unique and complex. Not what you would expect from a pale. Its got great flavor from start to finish, and has a surprising bitter finish. Light notes of citrus at the first sip."
"Pours a yellow gold with a bit over a finger of pillowy white head. Aroma is good, complex, with lots of fruity esters, some bread, honey, and light malt. Taste is good, fair amount of fruity esters that are at times a bit tart, some honey, slightly herbal, light malt. Mouthfeel is good with a light-medium body, moderate+ carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, 10% ABV is very well hidden, the beer is complex and enjoyable."
"Bos Keun is definitely a world-class beer. I could not imagine my Easter morning starting off any better then with this brew in hand."
"A nice drinking ale. The spiciness remains with a tad bit of sweetness to balance the flavors."
"Mouthfeel is signature de Dolle - an almost drying spritzy soft carbonation that expands in your mouth. Great beer from one of my favorite brewers."
"Pours a fully fogged in brown hued orange with a thick frothy crème head. Nose is perfume-y and floral tones. Dough and spices as well. Flavor is extremely smooth. Good levels of hops, sugars, and spices. Very well out together. Feel is a full and slightly nipping carbonation. Liquid is typical. This is very nice. And too easy to drink. I have to pace myself in order to savor it and let it warm to see what happens. Highly suggested."
"For those who love Belgian yeast and a strong alcohol flavor, this may be for you. It's not for me."
"D - With each sip I detected something new, and I felt myself craving more sips once the bottle was drained! :("
"I am still amazed that this did not become a gusher on me."
"7/4/6/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"Overall, very drinkable for the strength and a fine pairing for dinner."
"Another good beer from the brewery that doesn't seem to know how to make bad beer :) Recommended!"
"Drinkability: I aged this beer for about three years in the hopes to tame it down, but it still has a bit too much booziness; the flavor profile is complex, however, with an interesting blend of the sweet and the tart"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. A good kick and a nice mixture of spice."
"Nice complexities, and, despite the glaring alcohol, this has a smoothness and flavor that make this ""sipper"" dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: For around $5 a bottle, like most of De Dolle, or at least that's what I pay for them, you know you're getting your money's worth. This one's big, at actually 10% and not the 7% that it says (Can there please be a BA that does ABV fixing on the side? More and more I'm finding incorrect numbers...) currently above, and the alcohol isn't as prominent as one may figure. All of the Belgian points of interest are there in spades, and I'd love to see how these are years and years down the road, as they're probably always changing with the yeast being such a huge part, usually floating around just with a light bump. Glad I bought this and will jump at another chance to have another of their brews. Is it me, or does sipping on a good Belgian not make the air you breathe around you start to become more aromatic? Craziness galore."
"boom!!!... after the signature de dolle hello - tons of foam and head, this beer turns into a hazy burnt gold with a rocky sheet of white head and tons of lace. nose is pineapple, chewy asprin, honey/sugar and lemony herb tea on top of caramel coated apples. a lot going on. my bottle says 10% abv, and has no freshness date. taste is fruity lemon pepper tea poured over caramel apples with a very peppery and long lasting finish that carries a bit of boozy warmth. a little overboard on the carbonation, and pretty strong, so i would tone down to the ara bier for multiple rounds. another great offering from de dolle."
"T/M/D - mild carbonation, with a spicy, peppery taste and a slightly bready taste and feel. Smells sweeter than it tastes at first, but let it warm up a bit and it starts to balance out nicely. Alcohol seems more apparent than I'd expect for its ABV but not unpleasantly so. Nice beer!"
"The cleanliness of the finish is utterly amazing, clean,fresh and crisp, someday I wold like to drink this with Easter dinner. The cleanliness of this bier would complement some honey glazed ham with spring vegetables.I will purchase again and again."
"Very good, very complex brew. Obviously I'm a fan."
"Overall, incredible beer. This brewery does not disappoint."
"Good, dirty, fun beer."
"D - Far too easy to drink for the alcohol content. Another excellent offering from De Dolle."
"Pours a brownish orange color with an initially fierce head that settles to a nice lacing. Some yeast sediment floating around as well. Deep, boozy ripened tropical fruit aroma is pleasing. Taste is slightly medicinal with a peppery finish. Fruit nuances interplay with a musty yeast flavor that I could be more excited about. Finishes with a prickly carbonation tapering to aforementioned musty yeastiness. All in all I guess I was expecting more, although this is certainly not a bad brew."
"D- Probably one of my favorite Belgian seasonal brews of all time, definitely recommended to anyone who wants a crisp refreshing spring/summer ale that will satisfy their palate and kick their ass all at the same time."
"Mmmm Poured from 12oz bottle. First off the label is excellent, there is no rating catagory for this, but if there was I would give it a 5. Pours a dark Amber, with small chunks of sediment suspended, very colloid-esque. Smell is fantastic, pure Belgian. Fruit esters specifically banana and smell hints at the above average abv. Very smooth, and complex taste, bananas are very prominent. Extremely dry finish. The overall boozeyness takes away from drinkablity."
"The abv may be high but the alcohol is not detectable at all, and while that may lead to dangers down the road, if one puts back a few of these it is incredibly drinkable"
"Small bottle enjoyed (NO BARGAIN @ $12!!) at Beer Table in Brooklyn, NY, no freshness indication provided. Pours cloudy apricot, tiny bubble tightly knot white head. Great lacing on the glass. Nose of grapefruit, coriander,bananas, fruity and yummy. Lots of honey, melon, lavender, complex, fruity and delicious offering. Heady stuff @ 10%, but alcohol nowhere to be found. Belgian ale lovers rejoice and go get some."
"D: drinks bigger then advertised abv and may hinder drinkability slightly."
"This one was opened at celler temp so it was foaming and disturbing the yeast sediment thus causing it to mix within the beer. Every De Dolle I open does this so I think next one I will chill in fridge prior to opening. Nice puffy head that laces the glass after it is gone. Tart aroma with a champagne quality. Some candy and spicey taste with honey sweetness. Awesome complex yeast flavor like I get from all of their beers. A full mouthfeel with a very dry finish. Exactly how I want a belgian ale to taste. Yum."
"I can't help but be surprised by the high reviews. I'm sure it's all bias towards the brewery, which is mostly excellent (Stille Nacht & Oerbeir Reserve are true masterpieces). Plus I'd guess the fact that I compared this to 3 other BSPA-type beers at the same time made a big difference in my perspective. Fact is, I won't be bothering with this one again any time soon, sorry!"
"D - Like everything else I've had from de Dolle, I am happy with the overall beer. I like that it isn't quite normal, but it is quite drinkable."
"Copped a single 11.2 oz bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... De Dolle's Mad Bitch was great, so I had high hopes for this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, which failed to dissapoint... Very attractive foamy, cloudy, hazy appearance with an orange hue complemented the syle with an impressive frothy head that soon receded... Pure, fresh smell, bursting through with florals, esters, and candy... Taste was equally sweet, with grapefruit, caramel, vanilla, and sugar notes... Seems as if De Dolle has a penchant for brewing some seriously thick, rich, and sweet beers, because this one exactly fit the bill... Extra-creamy, ultra-thick mouthfeel led to a pretty good level of drinkability, especially due to the not-over-the-top ABV of 7%... ""Special Paasbier"" on the logo sticker with a brown rabbit kicking back under the shade of a tree enjoying a brew... Overall, this was a very good sample - authentic and true-to-the style... Definitely recommended..."
"Pours a hazy pale golden with a very healthy head with tight white bubbles. Complex aromas of pear, cream, cardomom, lemon, white pepper, and a tiny bit of funk- as well as something a bit savory. The taste is aalso complexwith clove, cream, pepper, minerally, a little bitter and quite spicy. A bit of alcohol is evident as well. The mouthfeel is very full, crisp, and spicy. Absolutely delicious, as is most of what this brewery makes."
"D - A strong flavored beer - intense and fresh, well made. A nice blend of flavors - I would definitely recommend this and hope to try it again."
"D- This beer has some nice flavors but it is very mysterious. It is hard to pull all the flavors apart and they really just blend one flavor into the next. Good spring beer with nice flavor and spice with a little heat in the finish."
"D: Wonderful beer. Light, but well rounded. A real refreshing strong ale."
"Drinkability- I'll gladly take another one of these. Almost like a dessert beer. Pleasure to drink this one."
"A beer from the Dolle Brouwers (Mad Brewers) and so it is, probably fermented at higher temperatures this beer is low in drinkability and too extreme for me."
"M&D: softly carbonated, almost silky smooth on the texture; the body is full but never has it shown any bit of high alc. content on the palate. This is a rich and deeply-flavoured strong pale ale with a soft landing, almost designed to deceive the drinker! A lovely and high-quality beer this is, but not something I would have for more than one bottle at a time."
"http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/201/634/?ba=GreenCard"
"D: Quite enjoyable. The fruity smells and flavors are pronounced and at the same time subdued. Excellent balance."
"Thanks for sending this one my way nlmartin!"
"Very drinkable, but not one to stay on all night!"
"An excellent offering from De Dolle..."
"D - I am typically not a big fan of Belgian Pales or Trippels (I pick up notes from both in this one) but I enjoyed this one very much. Complex in all aspects but very drinkable. I believe this one has a little bit of age to it."
"Notes: I'm not very well-versed with this style, but reading up on the style notes, I think this beer does a good job of meeting it. Complex flavor melding made it an interesting brew and I'm looking forward to sampling more in this style as a result."
"Overall: A very nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It's not my favorite, but it's very good and very drinkable."
"D - I dont think I could get tired of this, definitely my stranded on a desert island beer."
"Explodes out of the bottle a cloudy and yeasty golden tan. Mammoth rocky brown head that stays around forever and ever. Big fruity aromas; tart lime, lemon, green apples, and pink grapefruit on a spicy black pepper, yeast, and alcohol background. Flavor is sparse and dry compared with the aroma. Tangy rounded lime starts out sweet and becomes sour with green apples. Blends with yeasty and funky earthiness in the center before finishing with strong peppery alcohol dryness. Medium body with outrageous amounts of carbonation. This sample has clearly been around a while, but it's very good when well cared for."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- While this beer's texture in the mouth is virtually exquisite, the swallow is disproportionately harsh and detrimental to its drinkability. After swirling in the yeast sediment towards the end of this tasting, the smoothness improves, as does the overall flavor integration. Glad to have tried this, but there's no way I'd buy this again."
"D: This is a good beer. Takes a lot of quality Belgian characteristics and wraps them into one...successfully. I'm a fan."
"Some mild fruit notes (date/fig), slightly chewy mouthfeel with a touch of hot alcohol in the finish. Rather simplistic for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, not unpleasant, but not exceptional."
"33cl. bottle: A hazy cross between a dark golden and lighter amber color. There was a bit of a head on it which leaves some lacing. Yeasty/bready nose. Also notes of fruits: possible sour apples. The taste is semi sweet. Some notes of sour apples, caramel malts. Slightly lighter body than expected. Nice."
"From the bottle, this brew pours a murky yellowish brown that tends toward orange. The head is large and stable, and is fed with a constant stream of bubbles. Nice aroma of earthy, musty yeast, with a lot deep malt sweetness. Its quite estery, and theres a subtle honey quality that runs through the beer. Not much in the way of hops in the smell. The mouthfeel is influenced by the high carbonation in this beer. Its quite sweet, with a mild acidic twang and a lot of malt and honey flavor. The finish gets a bit spicy, and theres a notable alcohol warming that settles in about half way through the glass. This is a very enjoyable and well constructed brew."
"flavor is lighter than expected; slightly empty but with a gentle sweetness. burnt sugar, slight fruitiness, and mild honey flavors. fairly light carbonation with a heavy feel. could be a little bolder in the flavor, but it's drinkable and makes for a nice dessert."
"No freshness date. Lasting thick head and nice amberbrown beercollor with big floks in it but in the light it gives a unreal whirling sight. Nose is (banana)fruity and spicy with slight coreander and citrus peals. Creamy sweet and full with good malts in nose as in taste that apeals alcoholic also and with that good and strong bitterness. Malty but fitting sweetness with it makes it well balanced but heavy IMO. Great brew to enjoy and sip but also well drinkable."
"D - a little low due to the over-sweetness"
"Mouthfeel is sweet, bubbly, dry, lip numbing from the sugar."
"Overall - An excellent beer... Definitely recommended..."
"from the bottle. poured a light brown, with a big fluffy light tan head that left a trace of lacing. aroma, brown sugar, yeast, sour fruits that did not stay when it warmed a bit, a hint of alcohol. flavor, got apples covered with honey, hops, a touch of malts, a slight alcohol bite. nice bitterness at the finish. good beer"
"A good BSPA that leans towards a Triple. I like it and my only regret is not stopping to buy some cheeses after work tonight."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty wheaty all over the tongue, or should I say weizen like. Even though its hard to see the carbonation in the beer. You can feel it on your tongue."
"Overall, an excellent, fascinating beer. It's got complexity in the nose and in the palate, and the interest piqued by those elements, combined with the tasty flavors, makes me want more of this. Yum."
"Not bad, maybe not worth the price on a regular basis. The only beers I'll buy regularly in that price range are from St Bernardus."
"Overall, I'd say the Boskeun was my least favorite De Dolle beer. Not too interested in another, but clearly not a bad beer at all."
"Sweet spun sugar aroma with a touch of spiciness. Cloudy gold/yellow color with a massive Belgian head. Spicy and overtly alcoholic. Some sweetness, but that plays second fiddle to the malt and hop bitterness that stand atop the alcohol and spice. Comes across much too harsh flavorwise for my taste."
"Pours an hazy orange- tinged straw color with enourmous fluffy white head that refuses to go away. Nice spicy smell with sharp peppery smell. A little dried fruit under there somewhere. Taste is a bit sharp with (again) white pepper, spices, and hay. Some distant candied fruit in there as well. A little alcohol burn in there, too. Feels smooth and slick in the mouth. A sippable treat, but only one at a time, please..."
"Pours a half golden, half amber color with a large white head that lasts long into the drink and a dark residue that collects as it settles. The smell is very nice with hints of wine, fresh fruits, smokey alcohol hints. Very solid olafactor. Taste is a bit overbearing at first. Somewhat bitter with a strong alcohol flavor that kills it for me. Has flashes of classic Belgian ales but this one just isn't top notch. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and acidic. I couldn't drink this is excess but only as an occasional fair."
"Drinkability: This is one tasty well balanced treat. The alcohol flavor is nowhere in the beers taste. A dam fine beer any day of the week."
"Give it a try."
"I poured it into a wine glass, and the look was a deeper pale copper than expected. The smell was alcoholly and pineappley and some yeast. There was a smooth tart quality here and a spicy finish of star anise and herbs. As the brew warmed the mouthfeel changed and the alcohol became more pronounced, adding to the snap and tang of the finish. Another great beer from de dolle."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"The alcohol catches up as you reach the end of the bottle. Not sure I could drink this one all night, but it's lovely to sip on."
"Drinkability is very good -- I could quaff this like witbier. Very refreshing. Is there anything the DeDolle brothers can't do?"
"A good, but very different beer. The alcohol was too much at the end."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy beige color ale with a huge bubbly head with better then average retention. Aroma of yeast us extremely present as well as strong malt and a huge spice mix. Funky yeast with strong spice mix and some sugary feeling at the end. Body if full and alcohol, is well hidden. Another great De Dolle beer."
"overall i would have to say this is a great one to try, but is not one of my favorites. i would probably pass it up for something better, but it is definetly worth trying. And its not like i would complain if i came across this again. try it."
"Gloriously large and substantial head rises on the careful pour into my Maudite goblet. Stubborn, diva-like retention. The head falls, eventually, leaving some nice foamy patches of lace on the glass. Body is grainy gold. Smell: stark, musty sourness upfront, a good thing; followed by an aged bleu cheese yeast funk that has a nice texture to it, not at all unpleasant; the finish is a cotton-candy sweetness riding out over the top. Taste: complex sweetness upfront (cherries, brown sugar), with an underbelly of toasted pecans, sourdough bread; the middle is a strong punch of funky yeast, really nice, peppery and moldy (this is a good thing, trust me); the finish, much like the nose, goes back to a sharp sweetness that rides out over the top of the depth of complex flavors. Spicy, dry aftertaste. Lovely. Mouthfeel: creamy, very carbonated which is a good thing as it helps zip up the strong flavor in a nice, tight mouth-package. Wonderful brew. Glad I found a bottle, purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California -- looks to be about a 12 ounce bottle. Love the buck-toothed rabbit on the label. Typically quirky Belgian packaging, always gives me a pang of strange delight."
"One of the most pleasantly fragrant beers I have ever smelled. When I poured it I thought someone had opened a can of potpourri or something. Smells like sweet hops and wheat with a certain citrus that I am unable to put my finger on... Other beers from this brewery have HUGE heads, but there is a medium sized one on this. The taste is good, not as sweet as the smell, but it has the same sweet hops and wheat flavor. As you take more and more sips you get used to the taste and it gets very agreeable."
"Had this on tap over the weekend. Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a moderate head and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. What a great aroma. Lots of fruits (citrus), some spices, slight alcohol. Very nice aroma. The flavor is odd and interesting, but very good as well. Has a definate orange/corriander thing going on, but also has a peppery spice to go along with some Belgian yeast character. Slight bit of alcohol sticks around to remind you to drink slow, even though it's extra tasty. Body is light and fluffy. Drinkability is very nice."
"Drinkability and Overall: Beer #2 of my session today, and this is a good one. Loads of sweetness and complexity make this one incredibly interesting, yet somehow drinkable. It's odd nuances keep you sipping for quite a while. A wonderful beer for sure."
"Beautiful beer, drinkable by itself, or paired with spicy food or seafood."
"Such heavy fizzy leads to a grand body, and despite its high alcohol content this one is easy to drink too much of. Wonderful, wonderful beer."
"edit: i agree with previous reviews, and might try cellaring a bottle for another go-round"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a healthy 1"" eggshell head over the golden amber brew. Head lasts and lasts, and lacing is superb. Aroma is sweet cotton candy, with a touch of spicy malts. Taste is upfront smooth yet spicy malts, then the sweetness takes over and dominates, and fades with an alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but I find the sweetness just dominates the experience for me, and that's not really what I'm looking for in a brew. Worth a try nonetheless though."
"Sunrise pale ale-colored with a bone white freckle. The aromas suggest sweet, sticky herbs, marzipan, applesauce and vanilla. On the palate it is a colossal struggle between oozing, glycerin-rich fruits (apples, pears, plantain, tangerine) and bold, smoky, resinous bitterness. The finish hums on a bitternut, roasted banana peel and fruitseed vector. Broad in scope, it is a bookends of funky sweetness and twiggy hops extract. I might suggest letting this one mellow for a year or two."
"Hazy golden-orange appearance with a creamy white head. Sweet candi sugars and bubble gum in the aroma along with a bit of yeastiness and fruits. The flavor is very sweet and malty, and a bit acidic as well. A nice light fruity and doughiness finish out the flavor profile. It is very smooth for the alcohol level. It has a drying finish as well. A nice brew. I'm a big fan of the De Dolle beers, and this one is right up there with the rest of them."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this. It's a shame that it is so hard to come across in the U.S. De Dolle is a great example of Belgium's craft beers. This beer might be a little too much to go drink all night, but it's really nice and interesting to start the evening."
"Bos Keun is fairly sweet and would therefore be a good dessert beer to be sipped and savored. Drinkability is limited just a tad by my inability to handle sweet beverages in large quantities, but one bottle at a time should be no problem. Besides, it's on the expensive side. It's so good though that I'll definitely be buying it again."
"33 cl bottle, no freshness dating. De Dolle's website recommends not aging this beer for too long, I've had it for a few months so I'd imagine this bottle is this year's batch. Pours a peachy golden color with some cloudiness to it. Volumnous off-white head that doesn't want to subside so I can add the rest of the bottle to the glass. Lightly spicy in the aroma and some subdued apple-like fruitiness amongst pale malts and a slight honey-like sweetness. Rather sweet and lightly fruity, and finishing spicy and a mild alcohol burn. The beer's character becomes better IMO with the addition of the yeast; it imparts a further apple-like or passionfruit esters and a bit of nutty, wild character to it. Mouthfeel seems rather thick, but not offly so. Well carbonated, it burps kind of perfumy. Light spicings are nice and a good addition to the beer. Rather nice, but a touch sweet."
"Pretty clear light gold with a tornado of bubbles rising so that for a minute after being poured the head is actually getting bigger instead of smaller. (As with the other De Dolles, don't pour too gently because some of that carbonation is meant to come out). Smells of sawdust, lime, ginger als, metal, and lilac petals. Strongly aromatic yet composed completely of subtleties. Taste is dry hay, strongly phenolic spice, hints of cotton candy and lime, and makes a bite that leaves a dry white pepper and grass lingering flavor. Start is light-flavored medium-bodied sweetnes. It slowly leaves your tongue in a n effervescence surprisingly pleasant for such a high degree of carbonation. Very interesting and wonderful."
"Cloudy amber clears as it warms. The eager head doesnt last very long, but is nice while its there. This one has a very spicy aroma. Sweet, cake-like malt mixes with nutmeg and cinnamon and a apple-like fruitiness. In the flavor, the malt takes on a toast or bread crust-like character with more of the spice and apple fruit. This is really a tasty Belgian strong ale."
"An interesting chemistry of a tornado under the foam after you pour. An interesting and simple Belgian, was light on the spice. Alcohol well disguised. Cane sugar there, with other malts. Light yeast. Fizzy. Light. Modest mouthfeel, easy on palate. Worth a try."
"I'd like to note that I do appreciate Belgian beers...even the wacky ones...but this one isn't quite where I like them to be. The bottle cap had some mold UNDER it which was kind of weird but I'm open minded. The appearance was fine - a cloudy orange-yellow, with a nice white - off-white head. The aroma was interesting but hinted at more complexity than I found in the beer - there were traces of black walnut, a pungency reminescent of vinegar, and a little maltiness and an alcoholic hint. The flavor was sweet and tart with some alcoholic warmth, but it lacked a solid malty base and also lacked the layers of complexity you get with some of the other soured beers like lambics and Old-Bruin type beers. Overall this wasn't really very drinkable to me - it may be great paired with some foods but I think I'll pass next time."
"I enjoyed the flavor quite a abit. Distinctly De Dolle. Sweet, with various cane sugars, melons, almonds, honey and spicy hops."
"This is an excellent, strong Belgian Pale Ale, with a lot of complexities going on. I poured out about a centimeter of dark sediment that remained in the bottom of the glass, even though I swirled the bottle a few times during the sampling. Nicely crafted by the folks at De Dolle, and a Belgian ale that I look forward to having again."
"The alcohol taste was a little too strong for my liking (or maybe just my mood at the time), but this is a nice beer otherwise. The taste is rich and straightforward. It's not overly complex (there are some subtlties missing here that I expect in this style), but the sweetness and citrus were enjoyable. I'm going to have this one again, and I have a feeling my opinion of it may go up."
"11.2 ounce bottle. A very nice beer with great complexity."
"Drinkability: Well balanced and just damn solid."
"The beer decamps the 330ml brown bottle a foggy orange color with a cyclopean creamy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a velum like lace to somewhat obscure the glass. Nose is sweet like a fresh peach, with a bit of yeast and malt to back it up, start is sweet and nicely malt laden with the top light in its feel to the palate. Finish is dastardly acidic and the hops masterful in their spiciness, and the desert bleached bone dry aftertaste has a bit of alcohol bitterness, a unique beer, and one I find delightful."
"This is one hazey beer pours a mix of lemonade and tea with chunks and floaties everywhere with a creamy-like head that leaves a light amount of lace.I get some deep citrius and a touch of honey in the aroma,taste is almost like apple cider and as it warms more the bigger the honey notes become.This is a very rustic looking beer well made but not as good as I thought it might be."
"This was my first ever true Easter beer, and for my money, this is still one of the greatest that I have ever had. No wonder Jesus came back from the dead at Easter if this was available. Well worth the coin  but a word of warning, avoid the aged samples and get it fresh to get the best from this one!!"
"Cloudy golden body, bottle-conditioned with plenty of yeast particules. Superbly laced huge foamy head, rocky and leaving a trace on the glass at each sip. Aroma is mostly yeasty-sweet with light herbal hops noticeable in the shape of clover. Theres a good green apple character matching the honeyish malt and the yeast provides a mild farmhouse character. In mouth, the texture is silky and creamy. The taste is in line with the aroma, adding a balancing bitter finish, a bit like a Saison. This is overall an extremely well balanced beer with enough originality to be interesting throughout, but still eminently drinkable."
"Pours a five-finger white bubbly head leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Strong carbonation - pour slow. Medium bodied. Nose is a slight caramel and spicey fruit. Starts and finishes sweet. The high ABV is not really noticeable. Pricey - $4.70 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. Their site has the ABV at 8.9%."
"Seems fairly well done. Absolutely strange, but that's part of the allure. Just like the Huge guy that gave me this bottle."
"Feel is nearly full with a fluffy texturing within most of its carbonation, a nice spicy twinge and mild hop flesh maintains in the finish and comes across pretty darn smooth and even creamy at times, front mostly there. Overall a fine, fine ale. One I'd drink again and again with no problem. A very nice drinker eh. T'was gone in no time."
" I have found honey in beers to be overdone in almost every one I have tried, but this one is well balanced. I was very impressed at how it was there, but not dominant. This is a very interesting brew, and you have to give it a whirl."
"Drinkability is good, but not exceptional."
"It is a dark golden color with some haze and a big, white head. The aroma is sweet like caramelized malts and there is a smokey quality to it as well. The caramelized malts produce a sweet flavor that is accented with candied sugar, apple and floral notes and a smokey taste. It finishes with some alcohol and the smokiness lingers."
"Faboulous drinkability with complexity that does not interfere but does not bore. gimme more."
"Apple skin and the dull white scraps from the inside of orange peel. Light, a bit nutty, very yeasty. Begins sweet, finishes with an apple liqueor and grassy flavor. Cleans up remarkably well. Don't need to expound too much on its virtues -- they're very evident."
"Carefully poured from an undisturbed bottle the Bos Keun delivers a clear golden body beneath a tall head of creamy bright-white foam that slowly dissolves into a wide collar and leaves short, thin splashes of lace about the glass. Tiny bubbles rise in plumes from the base of the goblet indicating a very fine and somewhat effervescent bottle-conditioned carbonation. The aroma is mesmerizing in its sweet fruitiness. It's clearly candyish, but also laced with an odd combination of light and dark fruits (apples, dates). As expected, its lightly zesty on the tongue with a very fine, somewhat effervescent carbonation. A touch of caramel maltiness and some vanilla comes into play in the flavor; and it's not as candyish as the nose suggests (but still sweet). The fruitiness, however, remains with some crisp green apple that works well with the emerging note of alcohol, and some dates that emerge in the aftertaste. Still, it finishes surprisingly dry for such a sweet beer. A rich and exciting beer for spring!"
"The cap comes off with authority. But the pour leads to less head than indicated by the uncorking sound. Nonethless, a nice looking dense, yet uniformly bubbly, cream colored head forms atop the volcanic, slightly hazed gold laboratory experiment below. In other words, this beer looks like it has hot flame torching it from below. Vigorous carbonation is visible to say the least. Aroma is a sweetly spiced concoction of dough, yeast and bubblegum esters. Quite nice. Not surprisingly, the taste is a bit caustic, but not overbearing in the context of the other flavors. The heat not only comes from ethanol, but probably a few higher alcohols and esters as well. A sweet candied like blanket cloaks that harshness and damn near swallows it up at times. This beer has a little of that ""Tale of Two Cities"" thing going on. Best of times, worst of times...abrasive, yet mellow...harsh, yet mild and drinkable....fiery, yet soothing...acetic acid mixed with sucrose....corrosive, yet healing at the same time. I'll tell ya what. To summarize, I think this is good stuff."
"pours a dull amber - pale with a nice firm white head. Smells sweet & woodsy like BBQ maple chips. Some nuts and spice in the background. Tastes of overripe fruit, banana, pear, & roasted chestnuts. Then the yeast flavors fill in to balance out the malt flavors. Overall another nice offering from de dolle"
"Definitely a very drinkable brew with a lot going on for your palate. Highly recommended."
"oh yeah...i like that wacky bunny on the label, too."
"Cloudy, but glowing peach with a thick, bubbly head that leaves wonderful trails of lace down the glass and holds up very well. Nose is a blend of spicy, musty funkiness with just a subtle hint at dried fruit. I sensed somewhat of a smokiness lingering in the aromatics, which I'm guessing is from the age of this beer and the decreased presence of its hop character. Flavorwise, I got tart, herbal citrus with somewhat of a bitter lemon rind character and a bone-dry, biting finish. As the beer approached standard room temperature, some fruity apricot notes became more apparent, but I never experienced the honey flavor others note. The yeast character never strays too far, and it's definitely that of the aged variety. The highly carbonated, prickly mouthfeel was quite nice, but the dry, tanginess of this beer and the seemingly off flavors kept it from being overly drinkable. I may very well have sampled a bottle that was indeed past its prime, as this is the only beer with which I've been disappointed from De Dolle. It did, however, have some solid attributes, but I think it may need to be drunk fresh, rather than aged like this particular bottle."
"A hazy copper-orange color, pours with a tan head. Aromas of honey, slight vinegar, fresh pressed apple cider (surprisingly the cider is the predominant aroma of this beer). A lightly sweet taste with a bit of acidic sourness in the finish. This is a very refreshing fruity ale, the taste is reminiscent of a nice fresh ripe apple. A hint of mustiness in the finish adds a bit of complexity. This is really good, I wish it was easily available and cheap."
"Maybe a little unbalanced, but good..."
"Bottle with 1998 Expiration date tasted at Stillen Genieter in October 2001. Appearence: Orange color, very clear, huge head. Aroma: Spicy hop aroma. Malt strictly in background. Flavor: Honey detectable in flavor. Also big hoppiness and complex fermentation. Aging flavors fairly subdued. Finish: Sweet finish with big hop flavors. Interesting combo."
"Comments  Sorry to low-ball this one without a lot of constructive criticism, but this just left me scratching my head."
"Fantabulous. Pours a murky golden-orange with a gigantic frothy foam. Aroma is absolutely killer, with a fairly strong alcoholic smell, yeasty and estery. Incredibly complex beer. Sharp, citrusy flavor, and earthy, musty. It ends slightly sweet and dry. Very warming - supposed to be an Easter beer, but can definitely be had year round. This stuff is great, but by no means cheap. The bunny on the bottle art freaked me out a bit, but this is a really great Belgian."

"Maybe I will try it again, or let it sit longer."
"Deep gold color, slightly cloudy. Medium full head. Note: Lots of sediments (be careful pouring this one). Malts are sweet. Complex flavors; sweet, sour, banana, citrus. So what else is new for this brewer? Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a noticeable alcohol bite. Interesting beer."
"This brew poured a large head of finely sized white bubbles and a cloudy light brown body. It had a mild malt aroma and a complex fruity, citrousy flavor with banana. clove, malt and caramel notes. And I hate having to add length to my comments just to get them past the silly filter!"
"It pours an extremely eye-pleasing golden-brown with a fat head that leaves a trail of lace down the glass. The smell is spicy/peppery with some nice fruit scent in the mix. After a nice lead-up with the appearance and smell, the taste meets expectations. It has an amazing mix of ripe fruit flavors and an almost port-like flavor. Perhaps a beer with the warming qualities of Bos Keun wasn't the best choice for a warm mid-June evening, but this is a stunning beer regardless of when it's drunk. It has a full mouthfeel and is very drinkable."
"Okay, I have been hesitant to buy this due to the crazy looking bunny on it. Wasn't sure if it was okay to drink if after Easter without the bunny coming after to me. Well the head on this beer was huge, to say the least. What little beer I could see under the massive foamy white head that at least drifted down quickly(leaving spider like lace)was a hazy gold color. An good amount of carbonation was present, which would stand to reason giving the head. The aroma is very fruity, with elements of hops, banana, caramel and bread. A flavor of hops and cirtrus with some clove present with a touch of pepper. A touch astrigent in the finish. Not a bad beer, but the aroma almost leaves you expecting more."
"Finish is generous, sweet and very lovely. Body, texture, balance, all were well accounted for, and contributed to a remarkably delicious and satisfying ale. Thanks to marc77 for making this meeting possible."
" Bright, hazy golden color with some dark yeast chunks. Tall, rocky head and lotsa lace. Light, clean aroma of vanilla and citrus. Sharp carb bite on the tongue initially- slightly oxidized. Flavors of honey and sour citrus rush in - it tastes like carbonated Mead mixed with grapefruit juice. Tangy hops work thier way in and blend with the sour cherry/ toffee flavors. The middle of this beer is extended- interesting and prolonged with different fruit and hop flavors mixed with alcohol wafting in and out. Warming alcohol and lingering hop bite finish this off. Light going in, very strong going out. Definately De Dolle different."
"PS: attn: northeastern PA BAs. If you want to try this and some other De Dolle beers, the Steelgaarden in Bethlehem has this and some of their other beers in stock..."
"I had very high hopes for this beer. I love the golden Belgian beers, and I loved Oerbier. Initially, I was quite impressed. I had a ""bad pour", with the foam overflowing the glass. And, for the first time ever, I had a second bad pour! It had settled way down, I poured in the rest, and it overflowed again!! Huge, creamy head. Great smell, and, initially I really liked the taste. There is something in there I can't describe. I even read all of the other reviews to see if anyone else described what I tasted, but I don't know. It was subtle at first, but by the end I had trouble finishing it. Whatever it is, this beer definitely is a little different from others of this style. Others seem to have really enjoyed it, but something in there just hits me wrong. With so many other great beers of a similar style, I won't be revisiting this one (although I almost want to try it again to see if I got a bad one)."
"Drinkability: Very good. Well balanced and not overly sweet."
"Pale cloudy orange with lots of yeast specs and huge billowing white head. Aroma to die for, spicy (white pepper) with a tart lambic-like mustiness. The taste is slightly malty sweet, intensely spiced (almost hot) and finishes amazingly dry. There's a little tartness mixed in and a nice warming alcohol hit as well. Excellent."
"Wow, what a great little brew!!!!!!! Peppery and even hoppy nose. Nice malt pressence (adds a bit of sweetness at the start). Quite peppery, salty and bitter acid finish, quite complex, and very enjoyable."
"Beautiful golden-amber colored beer with a big, rocky head.  Aroma filled with spices and yeast.  Flavor follows the aroma, spicy, with yeast undertones.  Also some fruit lingering in the flavor.  Overall, one helluva good drink!"
"A very interesting brew, which I should have expected from De Dolle.  Nice orange color with fruity aromas.  Sweet with fruit flavors.  Shares some flavors with De Dolle's Stille Nacht.  You can feel the alcohol in the beer, but it was not overwhelming.  Didn't realize the ABV was as high as it is until I started feeling it hit my head :) Overall, not my favorite De Dolle brew, but a very good beer none the less."
"Hazy orange with a thick, creamy persistent head.  Lots of chunky yeast sediment combined with the fairly high carbonation provide for a lava lamp like experience.  This is an intense beer from start to finish.  The smell is dominated by a powerful candy like sweetness, with a touch of green apple (acetaldehyde).  It reminds me of candied granny smith apples.  The taste is almost cloyingly sweet, with complex fruitiness, slight caramel and date - like flavors..  The slight acetaldehyde, although normally a flaw in most styles, really adds to the complexity of this unique beer.  Hop bitterness is barely perceptible.  I noticed a bit of fusel alcohol in the finish.  A truly unique beer-- it's like nothing Ive tasted before.  I don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting, however due to the intense sweetness."
"The smell and flavour of this brew do it for me, big fruity esters with a sweet pale malt base. Has hints of almonds and mango with a warming alcohol. I know it is their spring beer but this is one that could be aged a year or perhaps more and still gain in complexity."
"Notes: Purchased at 't Brugs Beertje in Brugs for 140 BF, by Todd. 7% abv, and very drinkable. This beer is huge in character and complexity. Can't really say to much more about it as we are in awe of this beer."
