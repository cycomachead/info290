Wrong and feeling ignorant. I just really like the subtle honey undertone of this. Surprisingly strong for the mellowness of it.

Small jelly-like clumps of sediment are seen floating around in the glass after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and grape-like fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","May 11, 2013"

Nice medium body with pale malts, fruit, Belgian spices and distinct honey. Honey and slight hop finish. A bit sweet and has a brief acerbic flavor, but overall quite nice and interesting ale.

The taste of the beer is on the sweeter side, it doesn't really taste like a Braggot ale or anything. It is more or less just a sweet golden ale.

Pours a dull, honey-colored hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose is really interesting - citrus, coriander, grass and honey (almost reminds me of an herbal cough drop ala Ricola). Taste comes together a bit better than I would anticipate from the nose. The same elements are still there, and the overall impression is still the same, however, the edges are a bit more rounded out. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that is lively and also a bit gassy. There's also a very faint citrus astringency in the mix. Finish is crisp, with some residual carbonation burn at the back of the throat. Overall, not a beer I think I need to revisit. It's definitely interesting and has some witbier qualities to it, but this beer just falls a little short for me.","Jwale73","Oct 09, 2011"

Aromas are also mead-like up front with a sharp honey, nectar scent before the wheat malts, barley, and twangy yeast character builds in. Estery, citrusy, and flowery throughout the nose. Flavors heavily favor the sweet honey flavor, with a backup of wheat malt, barely, yeasty flavors and herbal tea notes to follow. The hop flavors give a much needed complexity, balance, and variety. Spicy with Wit-like corriander, curraco, pepper, and a lot of yeast contributions. The textures as expected are a bit syrupy, heavy, and more cloying than malty. A hoppy bittering is the only repreive. Finishes spicy, warm, and sweet -- a good substitute for a mead. Similar to the ancient brewed concoctions that are being revived by some Dogfish Head brews.

The taste is a bit sourish, some candied fermentables, spices such as coriander, definite honey notes, some typical Belgian yeastiness, a bit of orange rind.

Smells of apples, bubble gum, fruity, bananas, coriander, citrus notes. Fantastic nose!!! The flavor is also reminiscent of apples, citrus notes, spices ala coriander, banana, hops in the finish. Very juicy but comes across very thin. Mouthfeel is light, very carbonated, and crisp. Pretty drinkable. Not bad at all.","Doomcifer","Feb 04, 2008"

Flavor is strongly influenced by spices and there is a definite hint of orange there as well. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and a decent liquid feel. Very drinkable. As long as you don't mind heavily spiced beers, go for it. Cool cap on the bottle too.","RblWthACoz","Dec 31, 2007"

The nose is of some honey, and ripe fruits. Pleasant enough creation, peppery spicing, bright yeasty notes, some sweetness picked up late, balanced by dry and, again peppery notes. Nice.

3.2,-18.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Appears a honey golden semi clouded hue with effervescent bubbles streaming up to form a bright white head even fine Belgian style lacing. Aromatics mild cat pee funkiness, coriander spiciness with soft honey sweetness. Mild citrus peel with perfumey herbal hop accents, the smell works for me. Flavor brings upfront honey sweetness balanced with spicy coriander/citrus peel combo pale biscuit malt sweetness with light herbal grassy hops in the finish. I'm not crazy about honey beers but this one wasn't cloying in anyway pretty smooth and straight forward witbier, honey infused hybrid of a Belgian blonde ale. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with effervescent bubbly carbonation tickles the palate but flows nicely. Drinkability is decent not a session beer, but I'm glad I gave it a shot although in the future I know compared to some of my favorite Belgians I probaby won't return to this one in the near future.","WVbeergeek","Oct 07, 2007"

4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a 33cl bottle into my DT glass. Had a best by date of Jan 09. It was a clear golden color with slight alcohol shimmer. It had a big white head that dissipated into a collar. Good carb with some lacing. The aroma was awesome. Spicy from the coriander balanced perfectly with the orange peel and honey. The taste was also incredible. Starts off sweet from the honey then the spices kick in to be followed up with a smooth sweet again finish. I find most beers with honey to be overpoweringly sweet and therefore pretty bad but this one gets it right. The honey should be a nice accent like here and not the dominant flavor. Mouthfeel was good but had just a tad too much carb. It distracted you from the great flavor. Overall, a really great beer that I highly recommend. Glad to see this one hit the Texas market and look forward to many more. (4.5, RR, T, Y)","TexIndy","Aug 24, 2007"

The taste is sweet - honey and orange definitely come out strong. There's some malt here, but no discernible hops.
