But it goes rapidly downhill from there. Basically, the best way I can put it is pour a small glass of an ok Belgian, pour a tablespoon of sugar in it, and then pour a shot of cheap vodka in it. Pretty much sums up what is going on in this beer. Overly sweet and super boozey, sticky and hard to drink. I'm glad I got it because this beer had always made me curious, but my curiosity has been piqued.","Samuel906","Mar 15, 2014"

Another customer inquired about this beer and I remembered the product from the initial request. Amazed that we even able to get it, let alone have it in the store, the customer purchased the case and gave a pack to the store to try. I must admit that this is an interesting beer from the French. It doesn't appear to be much of anything special from the pour or nose; however, it reminds me of a delicate Pinot Noir from Burgundy, France.

The color is just fine, golden dried barley at sunset, and has good retention, lacing, etc. I tend to find BSPA's on the boring side of appearance, though. The smell just isn't right. I can sense the Belgian-ish yeast, but the bland sour notes of cheap lager make an unexpected and unappreciated appearance. I'm surprised that this fancy little French bottle of extra potent brew shares aroma notes with malt liquor. These off notes don't show up on the palate, but it's a turn-off for me. My turn-ons include long walks on the beach, verticals of anything and cheap sours. Sorry. Anywho, the flavor is definitely boozy, but there are some good undercurrents of Belgian earth and stone fruit. Surprisingly, there isn't a strong malt flavor. The color, aroma and abv made me expect a bit maltiness, but the sweetness is fairly bland and the booziness overpowers anything else.

Alcohol taste here is a little bit too much for me, even though it provides an interesting spicy/sour flavor. Some herbal hop flavor comes through, especially in the finish. Belzebuth is very warming from the throat to the stomach and could easily work as a winter brew.

It is a very thick and rich beer with loads of pale malts and a dry, warm finish. It goes down slow like liquor, but is pretty damn tastey. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good strong lager. It's a sipping beer for sure, but not at all bad. It has a good taste and decent mouthfeel.","WesWes","Feb 06, 2005"

The aroma is a little sour with a heavy dose of grain (Made me think of what a bag of malt might smell like if it were to get wet and sit for too long) with a hint of alcohol in the background. The alcohol rushes to the back of your throat and a sweet licorice flavor settles over your tongue. There is a ghost of graininess after the finish.","ybnorml","Jan 31, 2005"

Dopplebockish in it's aroma. Body is full and viscous, but there is some carbonation present to prevent this from becoming overly syrupy, which it could do I would assume. There's a good amount of heat in this brew. Not covered up as well as in Samiclaus. A lingering alcohol bitterness stays around for a while. Rum soaked melon and raisins. Deep malt tones are there, but almost get masked by the cloak of EtOH. This one's just a little too alcoholic tasting for my likes.","Bighuge","Nov 24, 2004"

Mine poured with a body that was bronze but pushing towards golden and a head that was beady but very small and quick to vanish. The nose combined a mix of a nice floral bouquet, sugar, and alcohol. I first notice the full and syrupy aspect of the mouthfeel. It has a nice caramel flavor with a buttery texture. At the transformation to the finish, the alcohol level becomes much more prevalent. Its malty and stingingly strong. This is definitely one of those beers that literally warm the belly. Its amazing how such a small package packs such a punch. Good brew.","Hhawk06","Nov 20, 2004"

Incredibly drinkable. Alcohol is there, but it sneaks in and out of notice. Nose is a delightful caramel, floral, fresh cut tobacco, tawny port. Finish is amazing, clove, spicy, continues on for minutes. This would be and excellent match to food. Perhaps a pumpkin flan, apple tart with Gruyere, roasted ham with apple chutney. It is fully 15 minutes from open and the carbonation continues. Well portioned acidity balances the heavy malt. A dry finish leaves you wanting another sip. One of the best beers I have had lately.","thadkaster","Oct 27, 2004"

The orange yellow body looked very nice in the Pilsner glass with a two inch creamy head sitting atop it, and leaving decent lace considering the strength of the liquid. The aroma was very sweet, with bananas and orange peel hiding the high ABV very nicely. The taste was warm and soft, with soothing liquor like quality to it. It was not inherently complex, but instead let the alcohol make things interesting with some spicy and sweet notes carried through. A little thin on the palette, and malt liquor like in the sugar derived alcohol strength. Although one dimensional, this is not a bad beer to try once in a while.","rajendra82","Oct 19, 2004"

Further rousing of the beer results in a strong aroma of malt laced with a hint of paint thinner. Mmmm, hmmm -- paint thinner. Now I'm wondering if things aren't quite right with this brew. I'm undettered and I take a sip, which I find to be full of grainy flavors and alcohol. This gets a little more complex as it warms up, with some mineral-like components and bit more bitterness in the finish. Very warming and the buzzing in my head is kind of nice, too. Some of the grainy flavors remind me of a scotch (whisky.) Not too bad after getting past the off-putting aroma.

I saw where someone said it smelled like bacon. I must admit, it does indeed have a very very faint smell of bacon. Interesting. The taste isn't awful, in fact, it's kinda similar to the Trappist style mentioned above, there's just something about the taste I don't really care for. It has a decent mouth feel that's a bit thick, and of course, at 13.0%abv, it's pretty heavy. Speaking of 13%abv, this stuff does well at masking its strength.","SilentSabre","Jul 09, 2004"

On the palate it is even keeled, with abundant burned sugar, pepper, tobacco and spice flavors. The texture is medium rather than full-bodied - wilting under the glare of 15% ABV probably.

Also, for a beer with such a high alcohol content, Belzebuth seems like a surprisingly bad candidate for cellaring Â— I don't really see any immature flavors that would come out with age, since the flavor is dominated by the malt.

Belzebuth packs a carbonated feel, very champagnelike in character. Flavor has a good deal of noticeable alcohol, though it isn't so strong that it is overpowering. A mild candy like sweetness underlies the alcohol. This is like a less hoppy barleywine on steroids. I'd prefer a barleywine, but this is an interesting brew and perfect for me at this very moment.

Big mouthfeel -- alcoholic, chewy, and just flat-out huge -- with a lot of flavor. The alcohol flavor is a little overwhelming at points, but some sweet sugar fruit notes are present up front, and there's a little bit of a dry snap off to the finish. This is one that you can feel in the belly from the first sip. A very good brew. Might this be an actual bottle of ""Whoop Ass?"" Just a little too strong to be really drinkable, a little too alcoholic to have a great flavor, and just a bit flat in appearance to be visually interesting. But overall, a nice treat.","marburg","Jun 13, 2003"
4,17.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Whew! Packs a wallop! Pours a deep amber with a fast fading off-white head and just wisps of sliding lace. Spicy hop, clove and potent alcohol aroma. A fairly rich and sweet malt. Highly hopped, only the powerful alcohol punch fairly well disguises the type of bitterness. Some piney notes sneak in along with some caramel sweetness. An ""Extreme"" beer? ps - This one is 13% ABV. The 15% version must a knockout!","BeerResearcher","Jun 09, 2003"

I could clearly hear the bubbles pop, like soda. Flavor is very fruity, alcohol is predominant, with just a bit of malt and hops, like champagne with with a little beer added. If the malt and hops were stronger, it would balance the alcohol and fruityness nicely. this beer is OK for what it is supposed to be, but it does not appeal to me. I enjoy champagne, and I enjoy beer - just not mixed together.","sabrills70","May 14, 2003"

Complex in number of layers and peculiar blend of things. Very interesting and lots of subtle and not-so-subtle things going on; hard to wrap your senses around it all with just one. If you're adventurous you'll enjoy it, especially if you're into the newer experimental belgian brands (the line of brews by Caracole, La Chouffe, etc.) that are trying to make distinct beers outside of the lines.

I saw it was from France, or is it Freedom now, oh well, after I bought it, but I figured, what they hey, give it a shot. Anyways, it had a very nice dark golden caramel color, with an off white head. The head lasted a while, then faded into a lace. The smell was like an imperial, but lighter, and it also had a hint of caramel in the smell. The taste was just like that of the smell. It was mapley, caramel, and citrus type tastes. The aftertaste was quite warming! It left a coating of warmth in the mouth. This is the best French beer I've ever had.","JISurfer","Mar 22, 2003"
4.29,25.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"15% version. Pours with a cream colored head that settles over heavily sedimented orange liquid. Nose is heavy, with intense maltiness and a solvent-like alcohol aroma. Taste is in your face malt and alcohol...and enough hopping to make you take notice. Burns going down, but not in an offensive way. Fruity tones pop up midtaste, finishing balls to the wall with over the top flavors of malt and strong alcohol. May be overpowering to some, but I think it rocks!

3.63,6.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"The golden beer poured a syrup consistency with a thick, short lasting head. The aroma was malt, alcohol and slight spiced fruit. The taste was initial alcohol, then the malt and ended on fruit undertones, but continually swirling in the mouth. The alcohol was huge; and the taste, complex. When quaffing, I recommend it be cold. Mine was roughly high 30s to low 40s and that seemed to take the alcohol bite out of it. As it warmed, the alcohol became more evident, but did not make it a bad beer. I gave it good marks in the flavor department, just because of the complexity. As others have said, it is an experience, and I think, a good one.","ryanocerus","Dec 14, 2002"

3.4,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This is an anomaly of a beer!  An all malt lager with a 15% ABV!?  According to the website of Brasserie Jeanne d'Arc, ""Belzebuth is the strongest lager beer in the world.""  Pours like soda; a head forms, a fizzy sound is heard, then it's gone.  However, it has a nice golden color with a reddish tint.  Or in layman's terms, ""orange""!  Kind of a Belgian aroma, spicy dried fruit, malt, and strong alcohol presence.  Very strong spicy alcohol presence in the taste as well.  Spicy dried fruit character, which reminds me of a tripel.  Fizzy mouthfeel from the soda-like carbonation.  Strong alcohol burn in the aftertaste, kind of numbing to the palate.  The alcohol kicks you in the face, which is very un-Belgian.  Well, this beer definitely gets points for originality.  Who would have thought anyone would make a lager like this?  A beer like this?  It's got intrigue, but I wasn't too big a fan of it as a beer drinker.  Still worth a try.","hyuga","Oct 29, 2002"

Drinking this --albeit slowly and cold -- was not an unpleasant experience, but it is not one I imagine myself repeating, especially given the outrageous $6.80 price tage for a 250ml bottle.

Personally it was difficult for me to judge the character of the body as the potency of the %15abv makes this one more suitable for sipping rather than drinking; definitely not a session beer. However, it appeared to be smooth. I let a second bottle chill a little longer past the recommended 42 to 45 degree-serving temperature and that seemed to curtail the alcohol sting a little. Very malty aromas blended with an omnipotent smell of alcohol. I really enjoyed it, and will go back for more, but mainly as an apÃ©ritif.","Mick","Oct 03, 2002"

4.42,29.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Wow! This beer is a real malt and alcohol knockout. What character! Great orange color, but the head immediately disappears (because of the high alcohol). The aroma has some alcohol to it, with alot of fruitiness - pears, orange, floral. The flavor gives a one-two punch of alcohol and intense maltiness with a good amount of complexity. Honey-ish. Light candy. Toffee & Munich malt. Alot of alcohol but fairly well supported by malt flavor and body. Sweetish, but that differentiates it a bit. Definitely a nightcap beer - really interesting and nice beer, but it will rough up your tastebuds. Thank you sir, may I have another!?","NeroFiddled","Jul 28, 2002"

Seems like a candied cherry is in order. Almost a bourbon-like character in the mouth. Aftertaste is pretty bitter and not very changed from the initial taste, probably from the strength rather than hops. Interesting potent brew but all in all too much of an arresting spice and alcohol overall impression to me. There are similar strength brews that are more pleasant.","ADR","May 21, 2002"
