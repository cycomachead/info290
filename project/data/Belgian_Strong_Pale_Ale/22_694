This is one of the best beers in Unibroue's (very impressive) year-round portfolio, and a definite must-try for any fan of Belgian-style beers.

Aroma is something I have never encountered before, herbal, yeasty, unfamiliar to me, wierd and not entirely pleasant. Flavor is a bit sour, yeasty, herbal, not fruity. I have to say here that I have not learned to appreciate wheat ales, and I don't really care for this one. Mouthfeel is medium thick, not overly carbonated. Overall I have to say that I don't care for this style of ale, and do not plan on trying it again soon. You will get more helpful reviews from those who understand and appreciate yeasty wheat ales.","Dsimenson","Apr 05, 2014"

Pours extremely fizzy, nearly fills a glass with white foam but settles quite quickly. Aroma is banana, other fruity notes that recall apple and citrus, strong Unibroue yeast and peanut butter. Palate is suitably complex, spicy even by Unibroue standards with some candied ginger and nutmeg, a caramel banana richness, orange marmalade, pound cake and perfumy bubble gum like Thrills (look it up). Strong alcohol character that is more assertive than in some other Belgian style offerings where the booze is stashed away. Rather sweet but some bitterness reveals itself over time, and there is a background apple sourness that adds an extra dimension. Not the most complex Unibroue beer but light years ahead of most other wheat beers in this regard.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 25, 2013"

It smelled and tasted of green apples and grapes, lemon, pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, ripe peach, and sweet bread dough or sourdough pancake batter. There was also a peppery spiciness with accents of cloves and ginger. Bravo. I think the age enhanced it. A prime cellaring candidate.","Kuaff","Aug 21, 2013"

The taste was not far off from the smell, the mouthfeel reminded me of sparkling apple cider with it's carbonated bite. The 9% alcohol level left an enjoyable light buzz and I felt warm after drinking. While this is not my favorite beer overall it has been very enjoyable and I highly encourage new beer advocates out there like myself to try it. Beer on my friends.","FrattyNattyKA","Aug 15, 2013"

Moderately heavy mouthfeel is complimented by the substantial carbonation, which in turn brings out the additional flavors of pepper and clove.

A Belgian wheat ale? It won’t replace my love for some of their other beers but this was a fun one to try.","elNopalero","May 21, 2013"

Pored a hazy orange color, produced a average white head, nice retention and it left an average amount of lace on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, toffee, pear juice and white pepper like spice. Medium in body, this ale had a pale malted base, fruity notes, apricot and pear come to mind, there are also subtle notes of white pepper, and grassy hops. Dry Finish, creamy smooth mouthfeel. One of the top Belgian style beers I have sampled- This brew has earned an entry in my personal top 10 list. Outstanding.","GossageBrewery","Jan 16, 2013"

Taste of big peach, pear, apple, lemon, grape, grass, herbal, floral, earth, pepper, and honey-like sweetness. Lingering notes of grape, pear, lemon, apple, honey, and floral on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a slickly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish.

As with texture/mouthfeel, I believe that only personal preferences detracted from the overall score of this sensational brew. I will always be true to Trois Pistoles myself, but I salute another fine brew from Chambly's own Unibroue.","oliverwren","May 16, 2012"

The taste is pretty good, the obvious belgian yeast esters the bread malts, a slight hop bite and a little bit of dryness in the end.","DavidST","Mar 06, 2012"

But the taste is nowhere near a match: it manages to deliver some bready, lemony flavor, but overall is flat, spongy and directionless. They hid the ABV somewhere, because this 9% didn't leave behind much of an effect. Not something to drink around power tools, but you ought to at least be able to write your name neatly in third-grade cursive after downing a bottle.","gfreed","Jan 10, 2012"

4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"It pours a medium bodied and dull cloudy gold in color with a one finger, quickly dissipating head. It smells like a tripel through and through. It is incredibly yeasty, and features some citrus and spice. It's almost in the La Fin du Monde mold. The nose is very soft and near perfect for a trippel yet does feature some slight alcohol. The flavor features plenty of wheat, yeast, coriander, slight spice, and citrusy esters. The flavor is really nice. It drinks medium in body and has moderately high carbonation. Overall this is a fine Belgian and again, a great beer from Unibroue. I don't like this as much as La Fin du Monde but this is a world class beer for the style.","aasher","Dec 30, 2011"

While this one is undeniably a pale ale, on a warm summer night like tonight, Don de Dieu is precisely what was called for! The color is decent, if a little light, but the smell and taste is ripely reminiscent of summer fruit. While evoking the flavor of blue moon with a slice of orange, the Don de Dieu rises above that bar classic and sits easily among the top of its style.","fastd03","Aug 07, 2011"

There is a tone of pineapple and mango...A TON! Sweet sugar aromas all around. Taste is initially slightly floral with all those tropical fruit flavors coming through. This beer is one tropical fruit bomb for sure! Very interesting. This beer is very sweet...but not too sweet. I mean, it is sweeter than most beers that I like, but it somehow works for this beer. No alcohol detected in the flavor...hints of cinnamon as it warms though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat warming. Drinkability is scary high for this beer. At 9% ABV... no one would ever know. Overall, this brewery makes amazing beers and this is one of them.","DovaliHops","Jul 30, 2011"

Although many of the fellow BAs here may not describe what they're tasting in quite the detail that I do (they probably have lives), I have complete faith in our collective palate. It's a bit strange for me to be so divergent from both the bros' and the collective grade. Especially when it comes to the world class beers.

It pours a hazy pale amber-straw topped by a finger of stiff white foam. The nose comprises light lemon zest, light orange peel, coriander, clove, light white bread, and a touch of flowers. The taste amps the orange up significantly, joining it with some lemon zest, clove, cantaloupe, light watermelon, and bready yeast. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, another solid outing from a Unibroue brew. I seem to recall this tasting slightly better, but it ain't at all bad right now.","TMoney2591","Jun 05, 2011"

The taste is nice. Pear, apple, spice... but something's missing. This beer is solid, but there's something missing, maybe a little more body to the flavor- and a slight hint of alcohol. At 9%, I don't get any alcohol at all, which is surprising. Most of my favorite Belgians in this style have a taste of alcohol to them, as well as a fuller body to the taste.

Starts off and finishes not unlike a hard apple cider of some kind, with a champagne-like prickly, punchy middle, and a dry wine/dried-apple finish. I used to absolutely love this beer -- it was one of my favorites -- but after a long fall/winter season of stouts and porters, this tastes too much like some kind of weird, spicy candy-beer. While tasty, it is too sweet and apple-juicey, coming off a little like some kind of oddball glorified wine cooler.

What we liked most about this brew was its creamy feel, and the unique blend of tastes that, while lacking any hop flavoring, nicely control the beer.

Whenever you think of a Belgian Strong Pale Duvel is what comes to mind, but I think our friends from Canada are beating them in a run for the title with this one.

Nose is heavy on the yeast with notes of watery fruit such as apple and grape, a hint of light sweet malt and even a hint of alcohol. Taste brings the strong yeast and alcohol tastes to he front, easing into the watery fruits and lightly sweet malts. Highly active, bubbly carbonation, bone dry finnish.

A billowing four finger bone colored head comes together, filling the top half of the glass. It doesn't stick around for very long though, and there's barely a suggestion of lacing left behind... very disappointing. Nose is a little better, but not great. It's largely pale, sweet malts. There's just a hint of clove and pepper from the yeast, and nothing really added from the wheat. Everything comes much more into balance in the flavor, to great effect. There's still the same, expected green apples and pears sweetness, but it's accompanied by a noticeable vanilla note from the wheat. The counterpoint to all those malt flavors is a big punch of clove and black pepper, with just a hint of coriander thrown in the mix as well. No one flavor dominates, each take a turn as the star of the show, and the blend of everything is delicious. Unibroue nailed both the body and carbonation. The byueer is surprisingly light for its heft, with just a hint of a velvety texture from the wheat. It's quite bubbly, but falls short of being over the top. There's no alcohol burn at all, always appreciated from a 9% beer. Don de Dieu and I started off on the wrong foot, but it really is a very good beer.","axeman9182","Nov 09, 2010"

It tasted like fresh apricots with candi sugar and some sour yeast and lemon zest. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and refreshing brew, with nice taste (although not super delicious). The body is good not great, but the alcohol is very well hidden, so this was quite easy to drink.

Various spice notes such as coriander, orange peel and a touch of clove swirl around with a perceivable alcohol presence. None of these flavors overpower though. All in all a very delicate tasting beer, something I can appreciate in a style that I enjoy, but is not my favorite. The mouthfeel is medium and very creamy with a nice tart finish.

Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with medium carbonation and some fruity tang, but thins out toward the end, adopting a pop-like texture. Soothing alcohol accompanies the finish. There's enough going on here to keep things interesting, and it's definitely a flavourful and aromatic offering. I could just use more body and a better appearance.

The nose is nice and strong with lots of fruitiness (apple, peach, toasted banana) along with the proper clove presence. The flavor is delicately balanced between fruit and spice and contributes just a slight hop presence to keep things in control.

Unibroue churns out some great stuff, but this one really does stand out. The 9% abv is well hidden, possibly dangerously so. I'd pair this like most white wines: with cheeses and desserts or even lighter meals. If you have the opportunity to sample this beer, I would encourage you to try it.

It didn't seem "great" at first, but once it got up to temperature it really did come to life.

It is in that vein of spicy strong golden ale but it a robustness that separates it.

Crisp carbonation and a medium body leads to a sharp sour fruit taste of orange, apple, pear and grape. Some sweetness derived from fruit notes as well as some caramel malt; beer also has a mild creamy texture as well thanks to yeast and breadiness.

Taste is basically the same as the nose, a good example of a belgian beer. Might have a bit too much banana in here from the german influence, still good though. Got belg yeast, spices, citrus, and fruits too. Mouthfeel fits the style here, pretty light with a high (good) amount of carbonation.

Smell of tangerine, clementine, citrusy nose carries over to the taste. Effervescent mouthfeel, refreshing, alcohol well hidden, muted bitter, understated malt, big time yeast is well received. This is truly delicious. With warming, the ABV is a bit more apparent , bitterness more pronounced, smack of lemon-lime in the finish, but still exceedingly drinkable.

Clove, licorice, cinnamon, ginger spice form the backbone of the nose with plenty of flesh to be found in the orange, tangerine citrus and banana, pear, apricot scents, some yeasty softness but that's about it. Medium-bodied and actually less dense and more openly constructed than the sweetness of the flavors might suggest. The same array of spices appear here, the orange citrus joined by a brush of lemon. The yeast, raw pie dough starts to take on a honeyed feel before notes of straw and wheat balance them out.

Rich smooth maltiness with a bit of that fruit coming through, so although it's a pale ale, I don't taste too much hops influence. Reminds me a bit of Leffe Blonde, but with a little more juice/flavor profile. The aftertaste is nice and smooth and I find this beer extremely drinkable.

This was a small bottle from the sampler pack, so I'll try to pick it up again later and revisit the appearance, particularly. Anyway, the aroma was the high point of the beer. There's plenty of spicy wheat notes in the aroma with alcohol, fruit and bread coming along as well. Unfortunately, these flavors don't all come through in the flavor.

Aroma is fairly soft, light fruits (apple, pear, a touch on banana) and a light spicynesss. Taste is much like the aroma. At first there is a very soft malt character but that is replaced by fruity esters, in this case apples, pears, and some oranges. The esters slowly segue into spicy/peppery phenols. The finish is relatively dry with only a light alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is good with medium-light body and high-ish carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer, fairly well balanced in terms of flavor but sometimes the flavors seem a bit too separate.

Apricots again, with maybe some hibiscus tang, rounding out into a malty aftertaste that finishes with a mild hop punch.

Don de Dieu has a slight roasted-nut quality blending in with that great fruit-malt-yeast quality that I love about farmhouse-style brews.

Mouthfeel is light/medium with above average zippy carbonation. Drinkability is good, even with the higher carbonation the beer goes down smooth and it's not hard to drink at all.

Taste is somewhat similar in that it is also quite juicy, a bit sweet and tangy, and echoes the aromas of the orange and banana. Perhaps pineapple as well. A touch of light spice, mostly clove and coriander as well. Thinner in mouthfeel than some other quality Belgian Strong Pales. The body is not quite mouthcoating like some, but it also lacks that crisp zing that soem have that cut through that. This one comes off very slightly sticky.

Tastes of bananas and pineapples up front with some bready maltiness, coriander and spice in the back and subtle alcohol heat to bring up the rear.

It is quite strong and has a hint of belgian trippel to it. The pale hops are still apparent but the malty tastes make their presence known to. Good finish and smooth aftertaste.

4.5,8.4,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Bright golden liquid with a one finger head in my wide mouth goblet. The smell seemed to contain mellow but pronounced, fruity but not citrusy, esters followed by an underlying malt aroma. The taste is defined by the fruit esters: grape, pear, plum, etc. The fruit esters are beautifully balanced by the spicy phenols of Belgian yeasts and the absence of a stronger malt sweetness (I dare not call it tart). A soft carbonation gives way to a crisp and clean, light to medium body that disguises the alcoholic content in a spectacular way. This smooth golden nectar cascades down the delicious decent to your throat unhindered by the typical grimace of high alcohol beers. What adjuncts do they use to make this beer? Honey? Candied sugar? Both? Whatever they use the ratio seemed damn near perfect to me. Awesome beer.","BeerLover729","Dec 12, 2007"

Smells very zesty. Impressions of orange peels, maybe slight lemon but with only small fraction of the bitterness. Taste reminded me a little of chardonnay, and also a lot of southampton double white, but thankfully with less sour bitterness and more akin to a strong pale belgian. i can't say ive had very many of those but this is definitely a unique interpretation of the style not lacking in complexity. It was so drinkable I found myself drinking it a bit to quickly despite the alcohol level. alcohol was a bit more prevalent as it warmed up but the taste also blossomed making it more delicious. Not really sure where hops come into play in all this because there's so many other spicy things going on but I couldn't imagine it any other way. I could easily see how people might find this beer a bit too outrageous, however I found it quite agreeable.","redmagik99","Dec 04, 2007"

Earthy flavors in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would prefer, a little mouth coating, but the carbonation could be longer lasting, instead of a short lived fizz.

The corriander and orange peel makes its way to the taste, again not very strong. Some Belgian candi sugar, but not too sweet, quite mellow. It has a light fruity taste, maybe some lemon and some tart apple to balance. The feel is moderate and a bit fizzy, finishes fairly balanced.

The beer pours an orangish, cloudy color with a white fizzy head that does hang around for awhile. The smell is Belgian -- sweet malts, candied sugars, spices, lemon, citrus. The smell is good but not brilliant in that it does impart some sourness and other unnatural aromas. The taste is quite good. The carbonation is spot on, the alcohol is warming but very well masked, and the taste is the yeasty fizz, candied sugars, sweets, spices, fruits one would expect from a Belgian pale. You also don't get that strong peppery finish that Belgian imitators seemed to get trapped in. This is an enjoyable beer but it is suprisingly lighter bodied than I would have expected and this does compromise the quality to an extent.

The spiciness is what is most noticeable about this brew, but the typical yeasty Unibroue flavours are not evident in their typical strengths. That can be OK, as some of the Unibroue beers taste somewhat similar, yet awesome, to me.

My tasting party seemed to love the brew, but it was just way too spicy and strong for me.

Nothing stand our dramatically, it is a sweet taste with a strong fruit presence. Good amount of carbonation leaves a slightly dry aftertaste.

The taste is pretty amazing sharp citrus and apricot balanced with steady peppery spice and a very light smooth hoppiness. Underlying honey, toffee and biscuits fill in the malt side of things while the yeast provides a clove/banana backing to round the whole thing out. Mouthfeel is also very good this medium to light bodied, highly carbonated beer dances around the mouth leaving a drying sensation with a lingering peppery bite that is very satisfying. The 9% abv remains expertly hidden in here making this a dangerously drinkable beer one that it will be hard to grow tired of.","fank2788","Aug 21, 2007"

Lots of bubblegum, caramel, vague orange and citrus notes. Candy sugar also present. On the palate, tiny bubbles hit the tongue with more candy sweet esters, complex malt aroma with lots of wheat like flavors coming through. Not much in the way of hops whose bitterness is either nowhere to be found or just barely enough to mask the malty sweetness. Alcohol is quite present in the flavor but great as a flavor vector.

Starts off with some bready pale malts and some cracker-like wheat flavors, but the house yeast dominates. Again, lots of clove and stone fruits: apricots, nectarines, and peaches. Hops come out a little and offer some herb to the finish. Mouthfeel is lively but I could like this a bit lighter and less sugary. Still sits well in the mouth.

Like pineapple juice. No, like the gold found in the colors of the St. Louis Rams. Ok, I digress. It's a lovely colored golden yellow. Cloudy from the abundant yeast, but pleasant to the view. This is also a beer bursting with aroma. Very easy to note citrus flavors ranging from clementines and tangerines to apricots and sweet raisons and then to lemons. Yeasty too, giving it a slightly bisquity mouthfeel and clouding the clarity. Bottom line; it works. Bubbly and noisy head, like the "snaps" fireworks from when you were a kid and then, just as quickly, it disappears in my tulip glass. No lace whatsoever. Light mouthfeel, particularly at the start and then the explosion of fruit and then just as quickly, gone.

An overly sweet bubblegum flavor and honestly it's just too overbearing for me to really pick outany other flavors. Maybe I just got a bad bottle but it seems really flat and really overall just lacking in every department.

I enjoy the "burn" in the throat with this one ... more aneffect of the carbonation than of the ABV, I'd wager. All in all, a very good offering from Unibroue ... again.

Initially, the flavor has a rich and bready malt character, with light orange and grapefruit notes and mild spice. The taste quickly starts to take on a sweet corn like flavor toward the finish, however, which detracts a bit from the enjoyment. The alcohol is very well hidden for 9%.

Complex yeast nose consisting of Unibroue's signature phenolics, heavy pilsener malt, and estery notes of apple, apricot and rose-like alcohol. Sweet high-gravity pilsener malt taste upfront followed by a barrage of belgian phenols. Dry and spicy aftertaste with fusels that pack a wallop. Tiny and abundant streaming carbonation in a med-full body- crisp yet with a thickish texture. The boozey characteristics help liven up the mouthfeel and the result is entertaining.

You can really taste the malt. Like and all-malt Tripel. Less of a powdered sugar flavors and more malt character, more toastedness and roastedness. Not the sharp spiciness either.

There is never any alcohol impression given off. Nicely crafted. I wouldn't have expected anything less from Unibroue at this juncture. They make some really fantastic stuff up there.

4.24,2.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"As always, Unibroue chooses an historical name which traces the history/mythology of early Canada. Hence, Don De Dieu(Gift Of God), Samuel De Champlain's ship, from France, commisioned to explore the St. Lawrence. Unibroue's beer nomenclature has always impressed me: always somewhat arcane, but eye catching; intriguing. This triple white ale was a pale murky yellow colour, an extremely light pineapple hue with brown, definitely unclear, and non-sparkling. The head is near-bright-white. I am not sure if it was this bottle or my glass, but the head was surprisingly small, bubbling quickly to a thin film, leaving poor lacing. The aroma is an impressive display of Belgian know-how. Oak wooden smells along with musty yeast and sourish fruit. I get a very aged, dusty aroma from far above the rim; in closer, the soapy, citrusy yeast arrives, along with cork and wood. Pineapple, some salinity, apple peel, spice, seasoning salt, some red wine notes. An extremely sharp fruit taste not unlike some of their Ephemere versions, but less direct and one-track. Instead, the fruit tastes are mixed well, leaving orange, green apple, some lemon, nectarine, and white grapes. The malt is not totally masked, as I could get some decent caramel/crystal malt in the middle and front of the tongue. The saltiness is felt in the finish, along with the dry yeast, hops barely being felt at all. Some numbing clove in the aftertaste. Wheat, soap, clove--all the basics of a witbier. The alcohol, felt in the middle, is well masked. The finish leaves more oak/cork tastes, some tiny malt ones, and defining salty ones, bacon-like. The mouthfeel is as good as some excellent Belgians I have tried, with perhaps more citrus, akin to a hefeweizen. Medium, bordering on high carbonation. The lees, greener and more creamy, brought less of a phenol hit and more apple than anything. Sufficiently bodied without compromising drinkability, as indeed this refreshing but heavy white ale easily slides down the gullet, 9% notwithstanding. Gift of God? Undoubtedly.","Cwrw","Jan 14, 2005"

Aroma is of fruity esters, malt, yeast, sour apples and citrus fruits. Flavor has a sweet start, tart middle and a tart and lightly dry finish. Palate is medium bodied and lively with lots of activity. An interesting balance of tart to sweet, and an unusual representation of the style. Worth another try.","SeanChouffe","Oct 31, 2004"

4.32,4.1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dirty opaque golden color. Head is probably the weakest part of this beer, sadly. A Belgian should just have more head, darn it. Smell is good, slightly fruity, yeasty, and strong. Taste is this beer's strength. Solid, bold, this could be a wheat beer, if it's flavor wasn't so strong. Big malt profile and very citrus-like, with the carbonation being integral to the flavor, along with some detectable alcohol flavor. Complex, and multi layered, but I feel it needs just a little more depth to claim the elusive 5. Still, this is surprisingly refreshing for a Belgian, which are usually too complex to be a summer beer, but this really reminds me of a wheat in terms of it's crisp favor. An excellent brew.","RocketWidget","Sep 24, 2004"

Aromas are yeasty and estery, with some banana, clove, honey, and light fruits.. Initial flavors start of with a slight peppery spice, followed by a sweet wheaty flavor and a big yeasty bite. A hint of lemony flavors work their way into the mix along with a slight clove, and bit of banana, some other fruity goodness and yet even more esters. The carbonation to this brew is quite crisp and just feel great on the pallate. The finish is smooth and yeasty, making a tasty Belgian Pale.","bigbeerdrinka","Sep 16, 2004"

Big, fluffy head with staying power. That sucker didn't diminish at all. Stayed two fingers and remained two fingers. Bonus points for that. Such a wonderful scent. Pale malts, cloves, bananas, apricots, pears, oranges, lemons, even a bit of grapefruit and other various exotic fruits. With an alcohol kick, of course. Oh God, what a heavenly taste. Sweet, smooth and delicious. Bananas at first show up on the tongue, entering like a close friend. Then KAPOW!!! It's a mob of fruits and malts. Their having a party. But not a rowdy party, a civilized party. More of a social gathering. Crowded, but polite. And ever so good. A nice, creamy mouthfeel that coats the throat and goes down smooth. Sorry though, needs a little more thickness for a perfect score. Drinkable? Oh yeah. I could drink this all day, every day. I dunno know. I think this and La fin du Monde are now tied. Hopefully, this will now be easier to get in Ontario.","slitherySOB","Sep 11, 2004"

Soft yeasty nose and aromas of candi sugar, malt, ginger and some fruity tones. Carbonation level is good and keeps the beer crisp. Sweet fruitiness like fuzzy-skinned fruit and honey-like in its malt with some subdued wheat ale charcteristics. Yeast play a role in the flavor adding a cloviness and cideriness to the whole profile. Somewhat of a drier, phenolic and estery finish. Ethanol is noticable, but not overtaking. Worth a shot.","crookedhalo","Sep 03, 2004"

4.8,15.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"CAUTION: THIS BEER CAUSES GOOD TIMES!!!! This is an amazing beer that everyone should try no matter if you like the style or not. This beer pours a very bubbly white head on top of a murky dark golden yellow base. The yeast smell is very very strong, it overpowers any other smell that might be present, but there was a little spice to the smell. The flavor starts as sweet malt, somewhat strong but not in a bad way. There is a little spice, and just a little hint of fruit flavor at the end. The sweet alcohol is hidden very very well, I have no idea how they hide 9%, but they do. This brew goes down so smooth that you will be in trouble before you know it, all the while bubbles will tingle on your tongue. The after taste fades somewhat fast. THIS IS ADDICTIVE. Amazing is the best word to describe this beer, every sip is the same kick of sweet flavor that doesnt seem to fade as your pallet becomes used to it. The alcohol will sneak up on you, WATCH OUT!

The taste is unusual, sumptuous, sweet (but not sickeningly so) and light on the palate. Lots of orange, tangerine, apricot, maybe some cloves or coriander in there, some wet wheat taste. I bought a six pack of these and experimented with them by pouring the whole bottle into the first beer (with a swirl and pour of the last 1/4 inch or so of the bottom yeast). The second beer I had I left the last 1/4 inch of yeast in the bottom of the bottle. The flavor was better by leaving the last bit of yeast out, in my opinion. High ABV is masked, though, so be careful with this one.","Trentonator","Jun 19, 2004"

Honestly though, Unibroue has to be the only brewery in North America where literally 4/5 of their mainstream lineup (excluding Blanche) is easily amongst the best in its class and hence, a regular rebuy for me.

Some warm light caramel notes with just barely some spice and some sort of soft fruit. Flavor is nice too, but nothing like the Fin du monde. A bit of spice, peppery, but barely. A touch of caramel flavor as well, but again, barely. I also get a little bit of that gelatin flavor I tend to get now and again in light belgians...mainly tripels. The alcohol is quite warming.

3.73,-10.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Don de Dieu was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was lovely hazed rich apple juice yellow, with mega effervescent bubbling, topped with an ample rocky white head that left excellent lacing. The enticing nose spoke of spices such as bitter orange peel, coriander, and zippy lemon. Tasting the attractive brew revealed a moderately sweet honey malt base, infused with assertive flavors of dried apple, peach, and fresh bread. Flavors of apple and dried fruit persist nicely in the finish. However, the sweetness level remained too high at the end, and excessive apparent alcohol dimished from the overall enjoyment. The body was appropriately full and smoothly satisfying for the flavors, as was the ample carbonation. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the above flaws.","HiroProtagonist","Feb 18, 2004"

Nice notes of citrus fruits and some hints of vanilla. Yummy! Going down it's so silky and smooth. 9%? It only warms your throat and tummy. Go get a few of these.

Hazy pale orange with a large frothy white head. I followed Unibroue's airline evacuation instruction card style drawings to the hilt. Smell is peppery, spicy Unibroue yeast, cloves, sweet malts, and estery alcohol. Taste starts with spciy-sweet malts, bubblegum, banana, with a naturally bitter, warming finish. Pretty syrupy on the palate, and big! This truly is a gift from Dieu. Man, I really wish Unibroue would stop using so much wussy French on their bottles.

The alcohol fuminess becomes more prominent as the glass warms. A hint of honey barely counters a very spicy, dry clove, coriander, orange zest and somewhat citrusy bitterness. A distinct banana flavor emerges, creating a nice mellowing effect. The complexities of this ale blend and meld, creating a big one-of-a-kind flavor and aroma sensation.

It has a very strong alcholic flavor to it. Fruit accompanies the alcohol, not one certain fruit but rather a bunch of fruits mixed. The fruit flavor is very sweet. Bready malts create a dry feeling in it. Finishes with more alcohol flavor. I could see how someone might not like this, but I thought it was excellent.

Light alchol notes can also be detected in the flavor underneath all of this making it refreshing yet warming at the same time. Sweet apple butter tones with honey drizzled on it, with the spices added by Unibroue combine so well on my palate this beer is magnificant. I am enjoying this so much, this could very well be my favorite Unibroue beer to date simply amazing. A must try for any beer enthusiast, the full body allows this beer to be slowly enjoyed the way it should be, and the high carbonation let's the flavors travel so well along the palate.

The head was thick and rich, white in color and well lasting to mid glass then subsiding to a respectable top covering and ring as it sat on top of the brew. The lace that it left behind was watery in texture but very present. The aromas that seemed to come from the glass were of sweet malts, caramel, fruits, alcohol, spicy hops, roasted nuts, yeast and a small hint of coconut. Generally sweet in nature that I noticed. The flavors that jumped out at me and all over my tongue were pretty consistent with the nose. Flavors of caramels, sweet malts, warming alcohols, big fruits, roasted nuts, grapefruit, spicy hops, and yeast were all blended together nicely. This beer was medium bodied. All the complex flavors that were in this bottle seemed to match very well with each other and the high alcohol content that is produced. Nothing out did each other which makes this a top notch brew. Smooth, rich and BIG are three words that I would use to describe this beer. I liked it a lot and will keep a few bottles around for a special treat on special days.","Jarod","May 09, 2003"

Nose was zingy yet full-bodied: wheat and sweet, quiet cloves, some hops (Styrian?) Scents were very clean, and in time some wine-like esters started popping up. The taste was a typical golden pale ale: light wheat and malt, lemony hops but not much, moderate in profile.

Trace clove adds a slightly herbal component. Very appetizing aromawise. Flavorwise, juicy, fruity sweetness continues where the aroma left off, albeit with an herbal, more pronounced phenolic tinge. Impression of sugary jackfruit and clove, w/ a hint of citric tartness. Light must and cidery beet sugar notes emerge mid palate. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth mouthfeel partially aided by carbonation lower than the norm. Light hop bitterness leaves the fruit drenched residual sweetness mostly unhindered. Finishes with a grainy dryness, accompanied by a brief surge of orange peel like citrus and phenol. Don de Dieu is delicious strong w/ a pronounced moist, ripe tropical fruit character.

It's funny how fast unfamiliar styles of beer can grow on someone after they get taken to school. Thanks to the fellow BA's who helped me out. Don de Dieu is a very carbonated medium bodied Belgian style pale ale that tastes like an overripe bananna. I also detected some notes of other ripe fruit like pear and apple, but overall, the yeast character plays the leading role in this one. The finish is very dry.

A fruity, slightly yeasty nose, a very fine (almost champaign-like) carbonation that balances the heavy mouthfeel, leaving a light aftertaste of dried fruit (apricots).  I drank this while eating a mixed-fruit salad, and it just made the picnic perfect.","Aesop","Aug 26, 2002"
4.67,12.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Quite hazy, even in a long-stored and carefully poured bottle. Orange-marmalade in color and topped by a rocky, bright-white head that eventually drops to an exceptionally creamy 1/4" covering and leaves excellent lace. The aroma is bold: quite yeasty, fruity (orange rind, dried apricot), citrusy, spicy. I keep looking for more but don't find it. The body is medium/light with a very fine, tiny bubbled and effervescent carbonation and gives a creamy texture in the mouth. The flavor is mouthfilling and extravagant, following the aroma's lead with orange, citrus, and clove atop a gentle malty sweetness awash in alcohol. It starts boldly sweet upfront, revealing soft spices as it warms, and finishes semi-dry with lingering notes of dried fruits. The spice eventually builds to leave a tingle on the tongue. Quite intense. Very enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Aug 09, 2002"

4.79,15.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Scores better than the La Fin Du Monde I just had.  This thing is a virtual fruit bowl of aromas and flavors.  Ripe peaches, bananas and spicy yeasties abound.  Slighty sweet start, finishes drier and slightly tart.  Wonderfully complex and flavorful.","pbrian","Jul 31, 2002"
4.08,-1.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy orange color with a snow white head of 2 fingers.  It dissipates rather quickly into lumpy leftovers.  The smell is that of strong fruit and alcohol.  Of the fruity flavored beers that Unibroue puts out, this one is put together well.  At 9% alcohol, whew!...that's what I have to say about that.  It has a slightly sticky mouthfeel, but it's drinkability doesn't suffer IMHO!  A votre sante!....again and again ;-)","BeerAngel","Jul 12, 2002"
3.98,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a monstrous pure white head, golden colored liquid with slight haze, very lively carbonation. Nose is spicy, reminiscent of Belgian witbier. Tastes great, with a nice fruity light and effervescent mouthfeel. Tropical fruit esters present, smooth going down, nice finish. Not a hint of the 9% alcohol contained within! A very decievable, yet very drinkable ale...be careful with this one.","beerluvr","Jun 22, 2002"
4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Cloudy, orangey appearance and fruity aroma. Sweet, fruity flavor hides some of the sharp phenols. A little too sweet for my tastes, but is good beer to have once in a while. I like the La Fin du Monde much better.","Longstaff","May 28, 2002"
4.14,-0.2,4,5,4,4,3.5,"Effervescent amber color, leaning toward the yellow rather than the orange.  Head settles to a skim after 30 seconds.  Slightly lemony sweetgrass smell, touch of candy.  Taste is dense but subdued, sweet malts, lemon rind, and very enforced by aroma.  Sense of alcohol warming in the back of the throat and in the stomach.  Powerful impact but only medium bodied.  Hops balance well in mid mouth.  A well-made brew, a little too heavy duty and toward the sweet lemon side to my tastes.  Prefer Maudite.","ADR","May 07, 2002"
4.6,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is one great beer. Nice creamy mouthfeel, tantalizing color and aroma. The more it warmed up, the better it tasted. One of my favorite brews from Unibroue, very complex in flavor. The alcohol is subtlely disguised, this beer can kick ass!","LarryV","Apr 10, 2002"
2,-51.8,2,2,2,2,2,"Horrible!!!!! Very sweet with too much alcohol shining through, gag, gag, gag. Horrible unbalanced and syrupy, one of Unibroues worst beers, no doubt, get Maudite or trois Pistoles instead, this is junk.","rastaman","Mar 24, 2002"

4.87,17.3,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"First off, this is an oustanding beer. It is clear that the masters at Unibroue are true artisans. Golden yellow, slightly hazy, with a beautiful white foamy head that thins but stays through the glass. Smells of spices, sweet citrus (qumquats and orange), and fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is very round, as it seems to impact just about every tastebud. Carbonation is perfect - not too much, not too little. Slightly sweet, orange and rind taste, a touch of honey, with a pleasant alcohol finish. What a treat!","mophie","Mar 09, 2002"
4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another excellent Unibroue offering.  Very noticable yeast smell and taste.  Smooth and should be drunk slowly - very high ABV.  The U.S. importer in Unibrew USA.","jdhilt","Mar 01, 2002"
4.6,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Caveat: I generally like to pour the yeast sediment directly into the glass to add to the flavor of most beers. DdD is the exception, I would recommend decanting this, as the yeast seems to "muddy-up" the spicyness of the beer. Either way, however, you are in for a treat.","cokes","Feb 20, 2002"
4.85,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Wow........I had read a lot of the reviews for this brew and it certainly lived up to the expectations.  It pours a beautiful golden yellow with a nice frothy head that slowly dissipates to about 1/2 in. thick and then even more slowly goes to a nice retaining lace.  The smell is very fruity and complex.  Due to my winter long stuffed nose I wasn't able to fully interpret it.  The taste is...wonderful.  Creaminess dominates throughout with traces of fruit (bananas?), biscuits, and subtle spices.  It finishes very crisp.  Smooth creaminess is what the mouthfeel is all about with the perfect carbonation.  Not too intrusive but just enough to let you know it is there and to enhance the taste.  A very drinkable beer for its 9.0 % ABV.  Another amazing beer from Unibroue.  Currently my favorite of theirs, although, my favorite seems to be whatever is in my glass at the time.","Murph","Feb 18, 2002"
4.5,8.4,5,5,4,4,5,"Not as complex as Unibroue's Dubbels and Tripels but an outstanding beer.","QXSTER1","Nov 24, 2001"
4.65,12,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Have one with the meal, then one for dessert, and it makes for the perfect warm, culinary experience.  Definitely a beer to be reckoned with.","mmthompson33","Nov 03, 2001"
4.17,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Cloudy golden color, medium head. Fruity sweet malty aroma. Sweet, malty, buttery, spicy citrus taste.   It's fairly effervescent with a spicy finish. Alcohol is well balanced. A pleasure to drink, down to the last drop.","ThreePistols","Nov 02, 2001"
4.5,8.4,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Notes: At 9% abv this beer is suprisingly light and refreshing. It's also one of the best beers that I've ever tasted.","Todd","Oct 16, 2001"
4.47,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"In my mind (?), this is not a strong Belgian golden ale a la Duvel, nor is it a tripel.  It's a pumped-up wit.  A very, very good pumped-up wit, mind you. This ale is to Blanche de Chambly (Unibroue's wit) as de Koninck Grand Cru is to regular de Koninck; i.e. a beer to be sipped and not guzzled.  I believe Hoegaarden has a Grand Cru version of their wit but I've never tried it.  I bet they're similar.","BKotch","Oct 12, 2001"

4.24,2.2,4,5,4,4,4,"Wow.  Curiously fruity, in that I could not put a name to the fruit notes.  Apricot?  I let it warm a bit and almost dunked my nose in the beer trying to figure it out.  9% alc. was nicely balanced.  Would have rated it higher, but it got just a tad too sweet at the finish.","Brent","Sep 26, 2001"
4.8,15.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I first got my hands on this brew back in '98 when it was available only in winter sampler packs. It's year round release proves me one thing, there is a god! A perfectly balanced 9% brew that can refresh you on the hottest of hot summer nights. Tasty!","beerboy21","Dec 06, 2000"
