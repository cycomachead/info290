"Overall: one of the better wheat beers I have had to date. A great combination of heavy flavours, and a very drinkable beer. It's a bit dangerous as it disguises its 8.5% ABV quite well. Approximately AU$120 for a case of 24 x 330mL - I'll have to have a 4-pack every now and then, as I am but a pauper."

"O: This is a solid beer. Really well made and very well balanced. I feel it is slightly underrated because of the brand name, but this is really good."

" The taste brings a nutmeg-like woody spice with pear and mild nutty malt with light tangy yeast balanced by a slight alcohol creeping in mid palate wtih subtle wheat sweetness and toasted flavor with a bit of pepper and some other indistinct spice w/ date and light sweet caramel w/ warming accent of sugar in the finish which has a flavor of alcohol drying the palate. This is a very good ale, better than I expected but a little strong alcohol-wise in the taste with heavy yeast and spice with some grain in the taste, but enjoyable in general with nice combination of yeast and spice."

"O - much better than the standard Hoegaarden, but there are touches of witbeer in here. The fruity and spice taste and variability kept me back at this for more sips, the only (very slightly) negative comment is the very low carbonation."

"O: It’s a fine beer. Feels like a perfect version of this style. Its great, no real faults and for that I will rate it higher, but nothing really interesting here. Feels like I’ve had this brew a dozen times. At that, its flawless. BBD is September 12, 2014, bottled on Dec 12, 2012."

"Overall: A well balanced, smooth and tasty Belgian Strong Pale Ale, that is enjoyable all year round"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: a richer and fuller version of the classic wit style. Using darker malt, and fuller and more satisfying taste and mouthfeel is achieved."
"O-This beer is a nice surprise. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but this beer provides a nice, high-octane summer drink. The lemon and orange flavors are intense, but this brew is not simply a high-ABV wit. There is some real flavor and balance here. Nicely done."
""
""
""

"O: This beer manages to hide its alcohol rather well considering its strength so it is rather easy to drink. It is a pretty good representation of the style."

"Very tasteful witbier or Belgian blond ale, or whatever it is, I really liked it. That is a whole different league than their regular stuff."
"Doesn't come across any better than the standard Hoegaarden."
""
"O Nice one, its nice in balance with the alcohol & fruits"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/ well balanced, nice Belgian ale, maybe not so complex as others but very refreshing . Good value."
""
"O: I generally like this beer. The price is right and it is refreshing. It isn't the best of its style, but it is drinkable and Hoegaarden pulled off a good example of the style."
""
"O: I think they went overboard on the banananess, but in fairness I'm drinking this at a slightly higher temp (maybe around 50-55F). Perhaps a cooler serving temperature would show better. The carbonation style isn't up my alley - too foamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very decent, but I can't stand coriander so I tipped most of it away."
""
"Food match: For some reason roast meats on ye olde rotating spits is the first thing that comes to mind. Don't forget ye olde vegetables to go with it."

"O: Descent beer not a great one, refreshing"
""

""

"O - Nice and sweet, multi layered and best of all, enjoyable."
"Medium thick on the body, average carbonation and some dryness."
""
"O-I remember liking this beer a lot more the first time I had it. I seem to recall thinking it tasted like a Hoegaarden on steroids. Then I found a bottle that had aged about a year in my cellar and it definitely wasn't as good as I remember, now that I'm drinking a fresher bottle it still does not taste as good as I remember. Perhaps my taste has changed or the beer has, I'd guess on the former. I won't be seeking this one out again-way too many better beers in Belgium."

"Overall: A middle of the road brew. Reminds me a bit of a high ABV wit but without the flavor amped up."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much everything about it is good, or even great, but I'm not in love. It's like being able to appreciate how good a renaissance painting is, but wouldn't want to have it on your wall."

"How do you explain perfection? How do I explain to my wife that I found something in a bottle that does for me what she can never do? I wish I had synesthesia that operated by taste somehow instead of sounds or words. This is the closest I have found to it. Bought a bottle at the Seibu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. At Seibu, Hoegaarden is ranked as the top-selling beer. However, I noticed this Grand Cru standing on the shelf above it neglected yet inviting. I took it home, ripped its clothes off, and drank it with a passion. It poured into a pilsner glass wonderfully, creating a nice thick white head. The aromas dancing off this brew were out of this world -- fruity and hoppy and like how I imagine pixies smell. The taste was how I imagine pixies taste. Fully of earthy tones that have been doing The Bump with fruits from enchanted forests. I couldn't put this brew down. I couldn't stop, and I won't stop. Try this beer out, and you will find yourself partying with Puck in a flowery meadow in no time."

"O - A solid Belgian Pale Ale that is a little boozy. The best part is the mouthfeel. It has Heffe qualities and i'm not sure I like that."
"O- I would buy this beer again. It would help if the local beer prices were more in line with reality. For having traveled half way around the world, this beer still has it. This is one of the best examples of Grand Cru Wit beer I have had. I would definitely like to see more domestic attempts at this brew style."
"O: Reality is that, this is a stronger (or ""improved"") version of the classic Hoegaarden. In USA, we would call it a ""Imperial Witbier", or perhaps a ""Double Witbier"" ;). In any case, a brilliant result..."

"O - A good beer to enjoy on a sunny day. I think this is one of the best brews the Dutch supermarket has to offer. I will definitely buy this again."
"Overall: A great beer - too bad it's not readily available in many other parts of the world. I think it's great that more people are becoming acquainted with Belgian style beer from Belgium with Hoegaarden White, but this is a much larger, angrier brother of that beer. If the Grand Cru is more what the original recipe was more like, cheers! It's wonderful."
"Twenty-six years old and magnificent. Damn. "
"Best enjoyed with others."
"come to think of it I WANT MOREEE"
"Dr: Hides its ABV (my bottle reads 8.8%) quite well. It's fairly priced, at least in Belgium, but isn't anything special."
"Massive thanks goes out to Jerriko for this bottle was an extra in a recent trade. Bottle from the Land of the Rising Sun and survived the earthquake, tsunami, and radiation while he made his way back to the United States! Best before 20/05/12. Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one and a half finger very slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger quickly. Maintained minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, mild banana, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall I was surprised by this one. It was a little harsh on the alcohol as compared to the regular version of this brew as you can imagine. The flavor profiles seem to be the same, but everything is stepped up a notch on this one to make it much more intense. I had this one on my Wants list since I joined BA (1 year ago today!) and finally got to tick it! Really glad I got the opportunity and really appreciate the effort Jerriko went through to get this to me."
"Overall is this probably the best Witbier I ever had."
"Yum, beer is medium in body and has a wet finish. Lead off is sweetness and some nice esters, moderate carbonation on the palate and a great finish. Highly drinkable, not hot at all, I really like this beer."
"It's interesting how a drink can be sweet (mostly by smell), but finishes very dry on tongue. my brain is tricked!"
"An impressive Belgian white beer, almost like having a meal rather than a drink. Probably wouldn't want more than one per session - it sticks to the mouth. Well crafted, and worth seeking out."
"It seemed too rough at first, but now I feel that Witbiers seldom get better than this."
"D - Wow, this is a witbier. It's a good thing it's not cheap but otherwise I'd drink waay to much of this. It doesn't have the most complex smells or flavors, but it is a very good all around witbier an improvement on the original"
"On tap into a Hoegaarden tulip in Brugge...Pours a dark honey gold with a bright white head, good retention, ok lacing...A totally yeasty aroma with a dash of honey and lemon...The yeast carries over and totally dominates the drink, just not enjoying the taste or sensation. The sweetness on the front is gone, a little alcohol creeps in. This is basically the regular beer on steroids. Nothing redeeming here or worth trying."
"Wonderful head from the pour. Three fingers of light yellow compact foam. Lacing is excellent with good body and cling. Color is a hazy medium amber relating to a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. First smell that I detect is banana and passion fruit. There is also some other tropical fruit smells there, pineapple and mango. Taste is a rush of banana, guava, passion fruit, and a hint of mango and pineapple. There is also some sweet bread and citrus flavors blended in there. There is a good full feeling in my mouth, much like light cream or buttermilk. I like the flavor of this brew a lot but I feel too much of a good thing might not be the best path on this one. I will look for and share, and drink this fine brew again if I have the chance."
"Outstanding!!!"
"Drinkability, honestly over priced, but totally average. May it be remembered im not a wit fan. I probably won't buy this again because there are much better beers at half the price."
"This was the most expensive beer I have ever bought! And I would do it again if not for this wretched economy! This is the ultimate Hoegaarden with double the flavor and scent, I was blown away by everything this beer offered in a wheat beer. If you enjoy Hoegaarden original then I believe you would love this."
"D- Good beer, but not impressed enough to miss it."
"Lots going on; good proof of both the depth a wit can give and the fact that big brewers can make good beers when they try."
"Drinkability: Totally sessionable despite the abv."
"A tasty witbier with good flavour. Smooth and creamy, it goes down well."
"It looks pretty average, but leaves you feel warm and happy, very drinkable, a real treat. i would recomend to people that like wheat beer of german."
"Notes: Kind of like if you were to mix a Tripel/BSPA, a Hefe, and a Witbier. Strong version of a Witbier and that is a good thing. Strong in fruit and malt but the spices and the medicinal/alcohol flavors break that up. Really enjoyable and a lot better than the original."
"A very enjoyable beer, fresh and becoming."
"this went down alot smoother carbonation wise than the big bubbles rising would suggest. This is very lively beer but is only slightly crisp. Medium bodied and very tasty with a fruity and slightly dry aftertaste. The eight percent or so only creeps in towards the end but who cares, this is good stuff. I wish this ramped up version made it's way to the states as I think the lighter version is shit by the time it gets here. Thank you LD."
"D - For a 8.5% beer this is very drinkable. The alcohol is quite well-disguised too!"
"A nose is strongly reminiscent of fishing but also wheat-specific Witbier. In taste, it also found that fishing bitter, especially the skin of fish. The mouth contains many spices including coriander and a spicy character that is in a warm finish. A tasting Witbier who'is quite strong in the mouth. Very good."
"Wheat, lemon, hops, all nicely blended, good balance of bitter and sweet. The alcohol is present, but less than you'd expect of an 8% ABV. Sneaky Belgian!"
"I wish this beer was available in all of Canada as this beer would be a hit for beer Drinkers who enjoy a Belgian style wheat beer."
"bottle from fred82. Cloudy yellow gold colour with floaties! Pours cloudy gold yellow with an almond head. Aroma is malt and citrus. Taste is great with flavours of citrus fruit and spice. Excellent belgian strong and a little surprised that this came from Hoegaarden."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability is dangerously high for lovers of big estery Belgian blondes, such as myself. Awesome beer!"
"Ahh the ol'Grand Cru. This is the stuff. Fruity, spicy honey and banana notes on the nose followed by a firm kick in the palatal pants with some lovely sweet Belgian yeastiness and a warm alcohol glow. Not much wrong with this beer. Great balance and a pleasure to drink."
"M/D - Wonderful drinker and full of flavor! Miles better than the 'normal' Hoegaarden."
"Thanks to my buddy for the beer."
"This beer, like many great Belgian wheatbeers is either perfect or close to it in all of it's facets."
"This brew is too laden with the alcohol presence, which needs to be masked better. The carbonation does okay to keep this brew drinkable."
"Notes: Hoegaarden Grand Cru deilvers! I find Hoegaarden to be quite consistent in that way (delivering on what is promised!)."
"Summary- The royal sibling of the famous Witbier: bigger, smoother, yeastier, and more refined. Seek out and finish off the final bottles I agree with Todd, this is memorable and amazing. I'll miss it."
"High carbonation works well to support the flavour profile. Soft alcoholic warmth."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied erring towards the heavy end of the scale. It warms the cockles and finishes with a light alcohol dryness. Its a must."
"Appearance is very cloudy, almost to the point of being opaque. Heavily hued from a amber yellow center. Rich aroma, sweet, dry, notes of marshmellows? Smooth flavor, dry, light alcohol presence...lots of yeasties poured from bottle. Carbonation is light. An entertaining Witbier, quaffable, but dangerously so. Itd be nice to see this commonly stateside. Itd do alot for Hoegaarden's reputation with the beer snobs. Its as good as any Double White I've had."
"A good beer all around. Orange in color with a white head and the retention is very nice. Has a lot of sediment but that is a good thing. Really reminds me of drinking Grand Mariner. Once warm the orange and coriander take over. To me an occasion beer. not an every day beer. It would get very samey after a while. Love the ABV for a white ale and higly reccomend it."
"Had a bottle with my steak at Faites Diver in Ghent - delicious. Appearance is a hazy dark amber withMan, this is a big, spicy beer. It's not that thick, but compared to Hoegaarden wit, it feels a bit sludgy. There's a mix of fruity berry and coriander for the flavor. And while the taste doesn't deviate, it's rich enough to make for a tasty big beer."
"Overall: interesting bittersweet combination. Quite refreshing despite the high alcoholic strength. Nice Hoegaarden."
"Pours a clouded brown hued orange with a nice white head. Nose is heavy on the dough. Good amount of floral perfume tones also. Minor spices. Flavor is thick. Lots of dough, good amount of spices. Lots of flavor here. Lots. Just a wee touch of alcohol on there. Feel is thicker on the liquid and the carbonation is working nicely. I like this one. It's a bit heavy on the dough and floral spices, but I can dig it."
"D this is a great beer ,a little sweet but very drinkable i like the unfiltered look ,and full flaver .."
"My thanks to ggaughan for this great brew!"
"Pours a huge head, big bubbles, fizzy, lasting and decent lacing. Body is clear/cloudy-ish golden yellow. Strong flowery aroma, sweet and almost caustic? Sweet taste, flowery, light mouthfeel, somewhat bitter aftertaste, but then sweet. That bitter and caustic flavor/aroma might be from the alcohol bite. Not too strong or thick, like usual Belgian strong ales I've had. Light and tasty. Kinda like a stronger version of the original."
"Smooth and easy to drink, yet rich and decadent enough to save for special occasions."
"I like strong beer, but who wants to eat nothing but steak? How about some refershing side dishes to go with the meat? Hoegaarden Grand Cru is like that. Lots of meat with little else to refresh and rejeuvenate your palate. But in the end, I'm glad to have tried this beer, particularly for the novelty."
"Not the most complex belgian out there. Goes down easy though..."
"Very drinkable and should've bought a few more!"
"Lovely. The entire Vitus crowd should find a way to put this on their Must Try list. Not because it reminds one of a hefe... but as a wit on steroids it does a round sweet fullness with a careful dry finish as well as anything. Wish I coulda taken home a sixer."
"Good change of pace beer though. Typical hoegaarden with with some other traditional belgian elements that make for an interesting session."
"D: Très facile à boire et à apprécier"
"I know this brewery is now owned by Inbev and should therefore be shunned by all true beer lovers, but this is a bloody good beer!"
"D: fine, & could've enjoyed another in the same session."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong ale"
"Overall, a very good beer. The most refreshing 8.5% ABV brew you'll ever find."
"Recommended..."
"This is a great beer, though perhaps too big to be supremely drinkable."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Easy to consume, good flavors, but watch the alcohol. Too many of these might surprise you."
"D: Easy to drink and very satisfying. Had I had another, I would have been very excited to drink a followup."
"a murky golden-brown, big frothy head that never completely leaves. Smells sweet. you can recognize the wheat pretty in the scent - kind of like a hefeweizen with belgian yeast. Taste is big and spicy, pepper, banana, coriander come to mind, maybe a bit of lemon? i might be making that up becuase its not bitter at all, but it hass a lip-smacking zest to it. Mouthfeel is exceedingly smooth. you can tell the alcohol is there as it comes in at the end, but its almost welcome with its sweet yeast mix. Goes down so easy for its strength. A beer to be savored yet I find it hard to do so with such a pleasant flavor in my command."
"Taste of grainy wheat and some phenols. The spices are tasted, a spicy addition to the yeast derived flavors. The vanilla from the smell are gone now. Body is a bit too thin for this kind of beer. Again no tartness as in other witbiers, yet a very good beer."
"Medium mouth feel, with higher carbonation then to expect. Really nice feeling."
"d: certainly tripel-like, and not bad, but wouldn't put this above most other grand crus i've tried. still, worth a try"
"Dark golden colour, with some haziness with a small white head. It's very aromatic, flowers, spices, honey and orange and coriander, even if it's not a white beer. Taste is powerful, acid but not as much as the classic Hoegaarden-, orange, spices, fruity. A very good one."
"Had a bottle of this at the Sands in Macau to top off quite a nice day. Appearance is pale and very cloudy, light yellow/orange in color, good head and lacing, despite higher than usual abv. Smell is true to the description, full or orange citrus and corriander. Taste is sweet, heavy on Belgian yeast on top of the citrus and spice already noted. Alcohol is noticeable. Mouthfeel is on the thick side of medium in terms of body, well-carbonated. Drinkability is decent."
"This got better as it warmed up, above the 5-6 degree recommended. Pricey, but worth it in my opinion, this is one of the better Belgians I have tried, I will be getting it again."
"Anyway, I didn't get a whole lot more out of this than I did from a regular old Hoegaarden (although I liked the original, and therefore liked this). I can definitely comment that the alcohol was well hidden, as it certainly didn't come across as 8.5%. Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker and smoother, and the colour is slightly darker, but beyond that it's just a good, high end witbier, just like its little brother."
"blonds as I have earlier mentioned."
"Between the three Hoegaarden beers i've drunk, this is for sure the most tasteful. Hazy intense yellow colour and a good withe foam reaches the top of its original Hoegaarden Gran Cru Tulip Glass. Very full aroma, hints of ripe fruits like banana and pineapple. Very good and bodied mouthfeel, more malty, estery and sweet taste than hoegaarden white ale and even more than the speciale. And because of that, this Gran Cru is not the best companion for bread butter and salmon as the speciale is, but still a terrific beer from Belgium."
"A light hop note with citrus, organic paprika, wheat, and barley rounds out the taste. A big alcohol presence here as well. Mouthfeel is bubbly and refreshing, but the alcohol bite distracts a bit from the flavor. Overall, it's not one that I'd seek out any time soon, but it's definately drinkable and complex."
"The wife even enjoys this one, she sampled some of this offering on this particular night."
"A very drinkable beer, dangerously so given the ABV. The price ($6.95AU per bottle) makes sure its a special occasion beer."
"Got from my friend Matt who got it shipped from Belgian Shop along with Westy 12 and 8 - if he wasn't my best friend before then he definitely is now. The labels were in Belgian so couldn't make out any of the info about the beer on the back label except for the best by date of Oct '08. Poured from a 33cl bottle into a pint glass. It had a cloudy orange color with a fountain of carbonation and tons of floating yeast. The head was good sized and slowly settled to a 1/4"" constant foam that was constantly replenished by the carb. The aroma was the usual fruity and spiciness of a wit with a solid coriander smell. The smell was also dry which matched the finish. The taste was pretty good but had an aftertaste that I couldn't identify but didn't like. I like my Wits a little more fruity than dry but this was one wasn't too dry. Wits are one of my favorite categories and I'd love to try this one fresh in Belgium but probably not worth shipping another overseas. Recommend if you can get easily get or in Belgium. (3.5, RB, T, Y)"
"uthfeel. Very enjoyable in small doses because of it's high alcohol content. Overall, I really like this one. I would describe this as a fortified version of the original Hoegaarden."
"Decent beer though I would generally choose a tripel over this."
""
"Pours a golden / orange color. Very cloudy and hazy, as expected from a bottle conditioned beer. 1/2 inch of white foam, with solid head retention and wispy lacing. Smell has lots of spices and citrus and corriander. Very similar aromas to Hoegaarden White. Taste has spice of the corriander and orange peel, with quite a strong alcohol hit. A bit of pepper in the finish. Medium body with a dry finish. Complex, with strong flavors with warming alcohol, not one to quench your thirst like a regular Hoe."
"Quite different from Hoegaarden Wit. More bitternes, more alcoholic sting. A bit sweeter. Definately drinkable."
"And this was a very fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy direct from the brewer."
"I'll also note that it pours much better than its cheaper brother, but due to it's sharp spice, it's probably not a beer I'd opt to drink all night long."
"Drinablility / Overall - Pretty refreshing but the dryness of the mouthfeel hampers the drinkability of this. The sharp taste of the alcohol at the end is a little to prominent. Otherwise complex and very enjoyable."
"Pours a cloudy orangish gold color with head that looks a lot like whipped cream. It actually has peaks. Smells very estery, lots of banana, some yeast, a tiny bit citrusy. Reminds me a lot of a hefeweizen. Tastes very estery too, not surprisingly. Also very sweet. With some banana. Some bitterness on the back end, but not too much. Mouthfeel is soft and a little heavy. Not really creamy, but not harsh either. All in all, it's a great beer, Hoegaadren has yet to let me down."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable."
"It poured with a hazy, full yellow color and with a finger of foam. The smell was of yeast and wheat bread. A little bitter too. It tasted of bread, sugar, citrus but not as much yeast as the smell indicated. There was a small sourness too. I found it pretty good, well crafted. It matches strong tastes in food. I tried some Wasabi nuts with it and it was excellent."
"D - a nice characterful witbier, a nice change from the norm, my favourite wit so far, i wonder if this beer could be cellared"
"Nice slightly thick mouthfeel and easy to drink, the best witbier I've tried to date."
"Quite a light body, which effervesces in the mouth like sherbet, and drains away with a light sourness, and a light medium bitterness. The bitterness reminds me more of citrus pith, than hop bitterness."
"Bottle served in the proper glass at Cafe Vlissinghe in Brugge on 9/13/06."
"I don't know how the style got to be ""witbier", because it's a tripel. On second thought it's not presented as such. It pours a nice, slightly foggy dark yellow. The head, while not thick is persistent. It smells sweetly with all kinds of flavors I can't identify. There's a hint of coriander in the taste, but not nearly as much as with the brews of Brouwerij 't IJ from my hometown Amsterdam (Natte, Zatte...). All in all a pleasant beer."
"Pours a hazy golden, big white head forms, sparce lace, but I think that was from a dirty glass at the restaurant, great retention. Smell is nice, citrus/orange, wheat, spices, yeast and wheat. Taste is sweet, orange and spice, wheat and yeast, vanilla, maybe hint of banana/clove, tastes like a real smooth Fin du Monde. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. I wasn't expecting much, but was really impressed with this."
"Pours a nice hazy straw color with a columptious head. Smells very wheaty, yeasty with some spicyness and citrus. Taste is amazing. Wheat complexes well with spices and lemony zest. As the beer goes down the warming effect of the alcohol becomes more evident. Great mouthfeel with nice carbination. Very drinkable."
"Definitely worth a try."
"D - Considering the ABV, this is very easy to drink. This is a really good beer that I will be visiting again soon."
"Purchased as part of Hoegaarden gift pack that had been sitting on my cellar for some time. The beer poured a bright golden color with a active carbonation body into a snifter and had a nice fluffy white head. The aroma had some very present hop nose with some good citrus tones. The taste was an enjoyable mix of citrus hops bite and a touch of sweetness to round things out, all lined by some spice from the present alcohol touch."
"M&D: softly carbonated and medium bodied, this beer is quite easy to drink. Somehow it's in line with the styles of Tripel or Strong Pale Ale, minus the assertive, perfumy fruity edge. A rather understated and mild pale ale, very approachable~~"
"Hoegaarden Grand Cru pours an opaque orangy gold color, with little head or lacing. Smell is of medicinal phenols and bright tropical fruits. Taste is very nice with some peppery spice showing up in the beginning, then mroe light fruit characters such as orange, banana, pear....many more im sure that Im not getting. Not too much carbonation, but the hop presence gives this beer one hell of a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Alcohol is hidden very well, I never really realized how well until now. Sip after sip, all I want is more, one is simply not enough for me, maybe a few. This is a fantastic beer. Although I haven't sampled a wide variety of Witbiers, this one comes through for me with flying colors. Also, although people have complained that this one is too similar to its counterpart, I still firmly believe that it exceeds it and is certainly worth picking up. Cheers"
"Looks just like the commercial export, perhaps a touch darker. Smells the very similar if not the same. Taste is all clementines, coriander, lemons, and wheat. Not too complex or interesting and really, seemingly too similar to regular Hoegaarden to deserve its own name. Alright for a euro or two."
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... worth a try..."
"Incredibly drinkable considering the ABV, and still a solid entry in the witibier style. This one is fantastic, highly recommended."
"tastes a litle more intense. although the higher abv works well with the flavor, this is obviously stronger than the original. flavor has a lot of character, complex and enjoyable. the mouthfeel is smooth to thick. overall this is a good one for sipping, but i don't want more than one at a time"
"It's certainly enjoyable, but there's an inbalance which holds this beer back from being something really good."
"Quite an interesting beer. It's also very pleasant and it's light enough to be sessioned easily. I like this a lot."
"Bham UK"
"This is definatley the big brother of the Wit."
"Notes: very good and tasty"
"A smooth frothy, sudsy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, wildly refreshing. This is regular Hoegaarden to the nth degree. Very drinbkable, very tasty, nicely balanced. Yes"
"Notes: excellent. Different and similar to the original at the same time. The only complaint, is the alcohol is quite strong in this. It was fairly new when I tried it, but it really detracted from the subtle and spicy flavors. I just wish I had an older bottle, just so the alcohol could mellow out."
"Drinkability: Well layered flavors make this a beautiful beer. This does not taste like a normal wheat beer that we're used to from Belgium but it is full flavored and tasty all the same. I am glad I picked this one up."
"Summary: A fantastic beer. I enjoyed it with a platter of cheese and smoked salmon, which complemented it perfectly. Highly recommended."
"Tastes of citrus and alcohol. Bitter spice and peppery. Tasty but not overly complex. Crisp and nice bitter finish. Good beer."
"This is a beer I bought in a St. Barth's grocery. I find it nice to drink but probably would not bring it back next time. A drinkable beer."
"Anyway, aint a bad beer. Just not my kind of beer."
"focused on creating a more complex version of their standard wit bier, and they did a heck of a job, at 8.5 % abv, you wouldnt know it was so high, the flavors own this beer not the alcohol. Try it on the beach in st martin if you can!"
"There is grand cru I have liked, but this is not one of them. Fresh from Belgium. It looked nice and fresh, beautiful head, and a whiff of cardemon and cloves. But it went down like medicine and i could not finish much at all. Tangerine and melon harshness, every flavour I avoid."
"Regular Hoegaarden is one of my favorites, so this was a treat to find. This pours with a very generous head, and the effervescing of the bubbles never seems to stop. The smell is very citric with a hint of wheat much like the original. The taste is not what I expected: it is much less sweet than regular Hoegaarden or Hoegaarden Speciale. It is almost as if the lemon is taken out to make way for a more serious-tasting beer. If you are a fan of a witbier without the traditional citrus, then this is for you."
"A more balanced and mature version of Hoegaarden."
"One of the best beers from Hoegaarden if you ask me. I don't really like their other stronger beers (Julius, Verboden Vrucht) but this one on the contrary is very tasty. Powerful yet refreshing. Recommended."
"Tasty all the way. I've always been a fan of Hoegaarden, and this really is the icing on the cake. Not entirely the same, but offers some similar qualities. Similar to a Belgian Strong Pale than a witbier, but it's still a winner in my book. I fear that I may never taste this beer again..."
"This is a fresh, fruity beer with a nice big taste. Clearly a good brew."
"So what is this one of hoegaarden; somehow always seems to be blind, nothing to see throug. Sometimes like a snowstorm, somtimes like a london fog.... like this time. No great smell, a litle fruit but lots of oxidation( botle refermentation????) and hardly any yeastsmell. What a dull beer and that for that content of alcohol, most taste comming from orange peals and koreander.... not my taste!"
"(33 cl bottle, bought in Denmark). Pours cloudy golden with floaties, large head. Strong yeasty and flowery sweet aroma , some spices (pepper) and herbs too. Flavour is fairly malty with a distinct peppery touch, hints of oak. Some alcoholic warmth, not unpleasant. Moderate but sufficient bitterness. Not bad at all."
"I was expecting this beer to be like Hoegaarden Witbier on steriods, and in many ways it is. The strong alcohol tastes makes it not as enjoyable though. Ill stick to Fin Du monde."
"Well carbonated, with a very smooth, fairly filling presence in the mouth. I'd never have guessed the ABV on this one. A surprisingly complicated and really lovely beer. Thanks to frank4sail for this one!"
"The head was dense and fine; it faded slowly on a hazy pale golden color body. The smell is very enjoyable, yeasty and wheaty with some straw, a hint of fresh tomato and a light hint of bacon. Fruity, very lightly citric. The taste is decent, more grapefruit than in other witbiers, nicely floral too. My only reason to complain is that the 8.5% abv become a bit too noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, creamy, smooth and round. The high alcohol content and the way it's poorly hidden reduce the drinkability of this beer."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a huge thick head with great retention. Aroma is quite spicy with what seems to be some wheat. I was quite surprise by the taste which includes a fair share of spices, some sweet malt and again something similar to wheat. I thought the taste was closer to a tripel then a regular Belgian ale. The alcohol was well hidden which make this beer even more enjoyable. God, I wish American macros would taste like this sometimes."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry, drinkability is pretty good, especially considering the strength."
"Not too interesting overall. Crisp and apply, like a drunken apple crisp."
"A big flavourful wit"
"The taste, very pleasant, is sweet and fruity between banana and citrusy feels, malt is very present and the finish, slightly hoppy in its robust body comes in properly."
"I could have definitely had a few of these, unfortunately I only had one a friend carried back from Belgium for my birthday."
"This beer had a lot of head, mainly because i'd poured it so shittely The smell was quite good but the taste was a bit of a let down. I found the taste of the alcohol very overpowering which tainted an otherwise tasty beer. Normally I find that the belgians are quite skilled at hiding the alcohol but not in this case."
"an exotic beer but probably not an everyday sort of drink, especially for the price."
"The Grand Cru is yet another very fine brew brought from a friend, while in England. Wow, what a pleasant beer. It pours a hazy thick orange with an explosive carbonated white head that maintains itself to an eighth inch all glass long, while a trail of lace is left behind. The aroma is floral, with stong citric notes of lemon zest and orange peel. The taste follows the citric path while bringing out more zest with tastes of tropical banana, a sweet malt and soft hop. A soft foamy mouthfeel swirls the taste giving no hint of the 8.7 abv that provides a slight gentle warming. An excellent, non-intrusive must try brew. Not to be rushed, but take the time to enjoy!!"
"This is an excellent beer, its just very very strong, and has trouble hiding it like strong belgian ales can. Still, recommened."
"This is a truly wonderful beer, and incredibly easy to drink. But beware for as easy as it is to drink, it packs a punch and is not as friendly the next morning."
"Thanks goes to jeffboo for the bottle!"
"Drinkability: A solid beer. Not outstanding, nothing to rave about....but it's very good."
"This beer pours a nice hazy pale burnt orange color with a 1-½ finger white head that is very busy. The mouthwatering aroma consists of fruit, yeast, and spices. The taste is repetitive of the smell and also has a crisp carb bite. It has a very light body yet bold punch and it finishes just lightly dry. It is a very nice warm weather brew! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Overall Impression: Since standard Hoegaarden has mostly lost its appeal to me (gone a bid bland), I'm happy to report that this is quite a respectable beer. The brewery retains a reasonable amount of clout with this one and Forbidden Fruit. But without Meneer Celis there to hold the reins, the beers tend to change!"
"Very nice cloudy orange colour with a big white head. Rich smell of citrus smells a little pepper too. The taste is very peppery with some hints of citrus. It is stong but you don't taste the alcohol you just feel the warmth of it. A beer for warm summer evenings."
"Dark yellow body, slightly cloudy, very effervescent. I poured and a hug head formed. I went to use the restroom and when I came back (yes, I did wash my hands, thank you) the head was bigger. Very nice appearance, very elegant and sparkling, although heads so large that you get nothing but foam for the first few sips irritate me. They do look good though. Back to the beer, the coriander is subdued, a bit more orangey here. The wheat/malt is bigger here and appropriately this is a heavier beer. I get a little oats in the flavor. The mouthfeel is slick and the tiniest bit thick. Good beer but something about it gives it lower drinkability than the looks would suggest."
"The alcohol content is noticeable on the creamy palate of this smoothly spicy beer. Full bodied and moderately long lasting. It is overwhelmingly wheaty, with the slightest hint of tropical fruit. Something about this beer just does not come together for me. It is a tasty beer, but something about it just did not gel."
"The taste is about the same as the smell, it tastes clove, and alot. I thought to myself, is this a gingercookie or something? In sweden we also use to put cloves in oranges and hang 'em up in red strings to create a nice christmassy smell. But in beer? No, I didn't like this at all. Looking at the other reviews I see most people liked it, to those who haven't tried it, judge for yourself. This is just my opinion. :)"
"Brownish-orange with a cream colored head and a nice bit lace about the glass. The weak aroma hinted of friuts. A heavy malt flavor with a touch of banana. Seemed to be a bit harsh towards the end. Overall a good beer, one that I would like to have again, however will not be excited about."
"Purchased and drunk while in the Netherlands. Cloudy amber color. Rich looking brew that doesn't dissappoint with its flavor. Complex blend of yeast, wheat, spices, that create a masterful brew that satisfies every taste sensory and some others as well! Yum. Put me on the list of those who wish we could get it in the US."
"A very nice beer, but maybe lacks a bit of complexity or something, and has certainly seemed to dropped off a bit lately, but still very nice."
"Notes: Ouch, this beer is a gift from the gods and it shall smite thee and then make the drinker feel its ever holy wrath of esters and alcohol. Once the light is seen then the mortal shall be one with beer. Serious beer, a beer to respect and enjoy to the fullest of course."
"Similar to its commercial counterpart, but twice as tasty, a bit darker and strong. Had this bought for me at Kaffee De Hopduvel in Ghent, Belgium by a gentleman named Vincent (and family). He mentioned that the Grand Cru is more like the original Hoegaarden prior to its becoming commercialized. Wonderful estery aromas with banana and spice notes. Very malty sweet with loads of esters and a slight bitter finish. Wow, what a beer!"
