"O: Melange A Trois is a really unique beer that I am glad I had a chance to try. It is very flavorful and aromatic. It's not really up my alley so to speak, but those who like an interesting barrel character will like this beer a lot. Spendy but worth it for a chance to check it out."

"Sharpness in the beer thanks to lively carbonation perk up the backend and I must say the  ABV is hidden."

"O – This really works. A complex beer that crosses many stylistic lines. An Orval/chardonnay cocktail with a squeeze of lemon. Some champagne-like and saison-like qualities. Bottle conditioned ++ 4.5"

"O: Excellent brew. This one is up there in my top 20 beers of all time. Very delicate and balanced, well thought up, well put together brew. Got this in Kansas City Aug 9th, 2014 and drank here the same day."

"Decent notes, nice complexity. A good wine-beer bridger."

"This has taken on a lot of Chardonnay characteristics. Well rounded unripened fruit character with a oaky and buttery lactic acid character. Enjoyed this one."

"Road trip!"

"this is a huge beer, certainly all of the 10 percent abv its listed at, and can feel like a whole lot more in high doses. off blonde, more peach colored beer, with a ton of visible carbonation and just a bit of yeast floating about. tall white head slowly recedes. it smells like belgian yeast all the way, mildy spicy, extremely grassy, and with the acidity of the wine from the barrels its aged in. complex for sure, with notes of peppercorns and yellow corn on the front end, tough to nail down grain bill because of these unique flavors. then the yeast adds an orchard fruit element, maybe green pear, and a lot of carbonation keeps it light for how enormous it really is. a lot of beer in this bottle, with a fair bit of body too. this reminds me of something from ommegang or unibroue, a very authentic but also very creative take on belgian beer. some residual sugar, very fruity, in the finish, and one supremely interesting beer. everything ive had from nebraska brewing has been top notch, i had no idea such cool beer was coming out of there before these ones. close to 20 bucks a bottle in cost for this reserve series stuff, but its darn close to being worth it. these are one of a kind ales here."

"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a hazy, medium golden amber with a beautiful three finger fine white head with great retention and lacing. Pleasant aroma of white wine, Belgian yeast and faint oak. Flavor is Belgian yeast, light grape, apple and pear juice; oak influence of vanilla and butter, slight tartness, Belgian and earthy spicing, absolutely delicious. Medium bodied with great creaminess. This is one of the best barrel aged Belgian ales I've had and possibly the only wine barrel aged ale that I totally loved. I'm a big fan of whiskey barrel aged ales, but wine barrel ales are often too tart and vinous for my taste. The Belgian ale base of Melange A Trois completely supported the flavors of the vinous oak, and incorporated them excellently. A totally enjoyable ale. This is the first time I've seriously contemplated moving to Nebraska. A fine production."

"Overall, this is really cracking stuff. It's very complex, but blended into a delicate smoothness that belies its 10% ABV. This is a really exceptional beer."

"M - Medium body. Dry. Light carbonation."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, earth, wine, wood, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with wine and earthy wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice wine barrel aged presence all around."

"Overall: despite its imperfections, this beer just rubs me the right way. Good stuff!"

"O/D - A very well done beer. The chardonnay comes through just enough to add complexity. Its a big beer, very full flavored and full of alcohol."

"The taste is harsh up front.. Like you're dipping your tongue into a glass of gasoline.. Yikes! As the beer warms up it develops a nice character. Definitely getting a white wine feel to this, though I don't drink enough wine to know the difference in styles. A sour/tart/bitter overall feel. A sweet malt backbone is present in the aftertaste. It's hard for me to like wine barrel aged beers since, like I already said, I don't drink/like wine. This is definitely a really good beer though. Pretty darn complex for a blonde ale, and well the abv doesn't do it any harm! A medium body, highly carbonated beer.. Very booze heavy and you definitely feel your chest warming up throughout the glass."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. There is some suspended sediment. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, wine, slight dry hop, hint of floral, and slight floral malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. The dryness level is not too strong, especially for a 'wine' beer. Tastes of sweet malt, slight floral, slight wine, hint of pale malt, alcohol, and a hint of citrus. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend."

"An impressive beer, no doubt... I just wish it wasn't so expensive (as all Nebraska brewing beers seem to be... a tulip glass of this was $12 at TJ's!). In any event, I'm glad I had a chance to try this. (though I was more than a bit annoyed when I saw bombers of this beer at my local MofC, priced at a much more reasonable $13.99 a pop.)"

"Going into this one with high hops. For a fairly new (to bottling at least) brewery to charge $25-30 a bottle...we shall see. They better be Bruery-status in oder to pull this off! Pours a hazy, golden color with a large white head that goes down rather quickly. Scent is spicy at first...spicy Belgian yeast with some pronounced green apples and pear aromas. A little bit of french oak and chardonnay. A bit of lemon as well. Nice nose to this beer. Taste is just as nice, although...I was hoping this beer would be a little sour. Taste is mildly tart green apples and white grapes. A ton of crisp, Belgian yeast flavor...spicy as well. More spicy than I was anticipating, with a good amount of pepper and lemon zest. Some definite french oak and chardonnay flavors, but I would have liked to see more Chardonnay...something along the lines of a less sour Temptation. Finishes with some mild hop flavors and dry Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry and medium bodied. There is a slight alcohol burn with the 10%ABV, but less than I was expecting. Overall, this is a very solid beer and I look forward to trying more that this brewery has to offer. Unfortunately, I may not take the risk if the price tags are this high. It took me 3 trips to Los Angeles and seeing this beer on shelves before I actually pulled the trigger."
"Overall – A very nice Belgian style ale. It has fantastic transitions in the taste, with all being very smooth and pleasing. While it is quite tasty, for the price it is a bit over-rated. If you can get it at an affordable price (under 25 dollars for a bottle) then I say go for it, but if not then your much better off going for something more time true and affordable in a Belgian."
""
"O- An interesting beer, very good use of the Chardonnay barrels, although it's still pretty drinkable at 10% ABV it's still a sipper, I picked this up at around $18, at which price I would say it's worth trying if you see it, although I've seen it on the shelf for a lot more in some places."

"This poured out as a lightly hazy golden color. It had a really nice looking fluffy white head on top. The retention was decent as well as the lacing. The smell was up oak with some citrus funk and a hint of malts. The taste of the beer was tart up front. The flavor was balanced though, it's moderately hoppy, tart and has just enough malt in there too. The mouthfeel is thin but not watered down. There is a crisp carbonation to the beer and very drinkable. Overall it's a very nice beer."
"The beer appearsa hazy golden yellow hue with a quarter inch of white head. The aroma offers citrus, wine barrels, white grapes, floral notes. The flavor brings grapes and white wine. The oak character is there, but light. Alcohol content is disguised very well. hard to believe this is 10% abv, other than just the slightest warming sensation in the finish. Overall, a really solid beer."
"Overall not bad, but not great, especially with the price tag."
"I’m past the days where barrel-aged beers impress me simply because they’re barrel-aged. Sure, it's neat but so what? Doesn't mean it's good! Melange A Trois, however, is a truly memorable, ingenious, and exemplary offering that makes the case that barrel-aging beer can be an art form. The ""melange", if you ask me, is a combination of innovation, complexity, and plain and simple carefree enjoyment. A shame to only do it once..."
"The pour is a pale straw color with a soapy white head. Heavy on the lemon zest aromas with a touch of oak, coconut, and vanilla. The wine is there, too. Some sugar and fruit notes, though there is a bit of fake lemon character to the aroma, too. The flavor is a bit sweeter than expected, but nice. Sugar and bready malt to go with a fair amount of oak and barrel character. A subtle tartness and lemon peel flavor to it."

"O: Very enjoyable and the brewer did a nice job of having the chardonnay and barrel complement and not overpower the flavors/aromas of the beer. A very nice sipping beer and one I would enjoy again."
"O: This beer is packed with aromas and flavors of chardonnay but these don’t completely overpower the underlying beer. These really make the beer interesting to drink."
""
"Extremely well done."
""
"Pretty tasty, not as good as the Hop God of the same ilk, but way better than most of the Chardonnay aged beers I've tried, goes down very easy"
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely and bright honey gold with light hazing, bubbly eggshell white head, lingering and lightly sticky. The beer quickly becomes all about the chardonnay aging as the dominant scent becomes a glass of heavy chardonnay - vinous with faint apple notes, base beer hidden behind the grape and oak, light spice and bready yeastyness. First few sips brought me back to some high end Napa chardonnay based sparkling wine, only slightly less vinous with more pronounced breadyness and light spice. Medium bodied, light oily heft despite bubbly carbonation, dry and tannic. Been waiting to sample for a while, just never comfortable with the price point, but well worth it in the end."

"Overall just a delicious, special beer I'm glad I had a chance to try."
""
"Now its more tripel than chardonnay. Opens dry oxidized grain, candied sugar, sweet apples. Quick transition to grape skins, tannin wood, and just a hint of vinous white wine."
"Poured from the 750ml bottle to an Ommegang tulip glass. Hazy yellow in color with about two fingers worth of white head. Smells of Belgian yeast, white grapes, light oak and an obvious tart presence. Taste is perfect. You get a little of everything from sip to sip.. Belgian yeast spice, Floral notes, orange peel, some vanilla and oak subtleties. Slightly acidic and tart. Well carbonated, dosent detract from the complexities at all. This is pretty much everything I want from a beer. Price tag is steep so it's not something I'll be drinking as much as I'd like."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, nice Belgian candy sugar, but over ridden by chardonnay. In the taste, a small dry fruitiness, which is muted by chardonnay flavors and a subtle alcohol presence. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry chardonnay and small alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Like drinking a chardonnay, but a but boozier and more body."
"This was a great surprise and to my knowledge, my first beer from Nebraska. I hear a lot of good things about their Reserve Series and so far I'm very impressed. I really love the wine influence on the beer, a perfect match."
"O - Overall this was quite the enjoyable beer. Going to have to try and trade for some!"
"O: A very nice beer that has taken on a lot of the characteristics of the barrels it was aged in. I recommend trying this at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The chardonnay character is pairing perfectly with the strong golden ale with just the right amount of carbonation. Hardly any showing of the supposed 10% alcohol. It's outstanding all around. I know it's early still, but can I go ahead and declare my favorite new beer of the year?"
"Well, got the chardonnay barrel right but never would've guessed this. With 10% ABV, this beer beer actually drinks much better than the heat indicates. Pretty solid beer."
""
""
"O: I'm really glad that I tried this beer because it reminds me just how versatile beer is to great creativity combined with quality craftmanship."
"Overall, fantastic!"
"This is compliments of Paulo from the Archives, gracias. Poured with a nice, off white, fine, foamy, thick, frothy, off white head that lasts and plenty of lace. Color is a slightly hazy, burnished yellow amber. Aroma is a fragrant mix of yeast, fruit, hop, malt, bread dough. Flavor is much like nose with carbonic tang; yeast and carbonic tang standing out. Body is just as it should be, ditto carbonation."

"Bottle courtesy of of Chris. Glad to tick Nebraska. Pours a murky yellow. Fairly pale. Smells tart.. Slightly funky. A nice oakiness on the nose. Tastes sweet and floral. Tart but not super sour. Lots going on with this one. Decent mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable but not something i would seek out."
"Overall: I want to dislike this because of the absurd price tag, but it's quite good."
"Verdict: This is really a fantastic beer. It has a great body and some really interesting flavors going on and the slight oak flavors really compliment it well. It’s definitely expensive but for a fun occasion it was worth it."
"D -Very easy and masks abv quite well. Tasty!"
"D - Drank about half the bottle myself, and used the rest to whip up some awesome quinoa. Not super drinkable at 10%, but quite enjoyable and something I'd definitely have again. Best offering I've had from Nebraska Brewing and worth checking out if you're into this sort of beer."
"Melange is Golden/yellow, slightly cloudy, micro bubbly. Had a good head and lacing...impressive for an aged beer. Smells of sweet, and sour. The barrel aging is evident immediately. A boozy champagne/belgian strong. This is a sipper, had a tart sourness about it backed up by a light sweet and dry champagne finish...really beautiful. Overall this is a must purchase. It's really a unique styling of beer, that i can say is the first of this genre (other than the matured sake cask beer, this is waay better). For 30 bucks, if you have the means, i suggest giving it a try. Preferably with a pretty gal you've had your eyes on for a while."
"Get this at all costs."
"Overall: Really wanted to like this beer more than I did but the combination of the tart fruit and the fusel alcohol did not work for me; impressed by the quality and inventiveness of the brewer and look forward to trying other beers from this brewery"
"O - Very good brew. Im glad to have tried this BSPA. Good mix with he wood and the wine."
"The aroma was light, airy and nice and hoppy with a great presence to it. Nice light pepper like notes that really punched through as it warmed, allowing that nice, light hoppy bite to really take hold. Some light bread like notes lying underneath o that. The flavor was very well done. Light, with most all of the alcohol very well hidden. It started with a nice lemon zest like hop bite that quickly melded into a spicy and peppery mix of yeast and spices. Some nice touches of light fruit and a really nice and mellow finish, left a clean, dry flavor in it."
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with myself and funkydelic during one of our weekly tastings! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon, banana, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, banana, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor on this one is what surprised me the most with the bready and banana aspect going on. Really put this brew in another league with the other Belgian Strong Pales I have had in the past. The citrus aspect in the flavor and aroma was also quite pleasant and inviting to the beer. Really enjoyed this one."
"After tasting this beer, the vanillin in the nose comes out quite a bit more prominently. This beer has a very nice chardonnay character, but it would definitely benefit from some funkiness; it is good as it is, but that can’t keep me for wishing for more. This is perhaps the best chardonnay character in a beer that I have had."
"O - Definately a Belgium. The wife and I enjoyed it."
"O - A bit disappointed in this one, but overall it is still a decent brew."
"Overall, amazing. My initial reaction to this beer was ""holy s---!", it's very very good. Not perfect, for a Belgian style pale ale it could have a bit more spice flavor but the chardonnay flavor really makes this beer interesting in a very good way. Pricey but something I'd love to buy again to share with friends who I know would never think to pick up this amazing beer."
"Medium bodied, creamy. well carbonated, and the alcohol is well hidden for 10.00 % abv. I am glad I had a chance to pick this up in Hudson, and will look for more Nebraska beers when I go back."
"Very interesting beer, & a good one. Not great, but a nice take on a blonde, & the wine barrels were really used to nice effect. This one really starts to open up as it warms, too."
"o - Overall an interesting Belgian style ale I really liked. The wine definitely comes through and I really enjoyed it. Would like to have again."
"A fine beer that's very well crafted. Give it try if you get the opportunity, but maybe not worth seeking out."
"Pour yields a bright golden brew with a nice white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The chardonnay aging is really apparent in the nose, with that grape varietal being the dominant characteristic. Behind that is a bit of oak and accompanying spice, plus a bit of light fruit. Taste is somewhat tannic and brings along mild spice, hints of oak, and a good chardonnay presence. Good feel; I really like what they did with the aging here. I wish there were a bit more of the base beer, but I really enjoyed this."
"Overall, I found this beer to be quite good and was very close to breaking into the realm of world class BSPA's. The booziness is the only thing that holds it back."
"On the strength of two out-of-this-world ales, I'm ready to crown Nebraska Brewing Company the single best 'unknown to most BAs' brewery in the country. Melange A Trois is at least the equal of Hop God, and might even be better. Both are superlative drinkers and make me glad to live in a neighboring state. Now, about distribution one state to the east..."
"D: A very nice BPA. The barrels give it a unique characteristic that I really enjoyed."
"As a pale Belgian, by far one of the best I have had.Lighter cloudy body, with a moderate head. Neutral aromas. Above average mouthfeel, very drinkable, and gentle masterful blend of the chardonnay barrelling taste and the Belgian blonde. A great and simple idea, well executed."
"This is a really enjoyable beer - well put together."
"Pours a three finger tight, white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is funky sour fruit, flavor is sweet and tart fruit, Not finding any white wine flavors. High ABV is hidden. Warming. Good but not worth $23.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"D- Pretty interesting beer all around. The chardonnay aging adds a little something extra that you don't typically find in a beer."
"I have like everything from Nebraska Brewing that I have had so far. I do like this, but not one of the better beers in the Reserve Series. Still very much worth a try."
"drinkability: good"
"D-I have heard a great deal about this beer and it lives up to its reputation. Despite the high alcohol, it is very complex and drinkable. Kudos to Paul and Tyson at NBC! I look forward to trying more of there reserve series in the near distant future...."
"D: Hell yeah! Exceedingly drinkable for a beer dipping its' toes in double digit abv%. I felt like the alcohol, while not intrusive in the least, became apparent as it came up to temp. Cheeks were feelin' the heat by the end of this!"
"This brew begins with an excessive amount of head, but is not gushing. Its hazy golden-yellow color shimmers perfectly in the light. Chardonnay and wood are obvious in the nose, but tropical fruit, nougat and nutty yeast are also in tow. It is silky smooth and a little creamy, with a fluffy, moderate-size body. With a little tartness, it is still very beery. Vinous character from the barrel plays strong, yet mixes well with the malt, alcohol and modest hops. Tartness and wood linger long into the aftertaste. Pretty damn amazing. This is a sipper that does not miss a beat."
"Overall - Very outstanding! The bottle I drank is their 2010 bottle from much earlier in the year. On New Year's Eve, I had the latest batch and their was a strong astringent aftertaste that is completely absent from this bottle. The bottle I drank is a masterpiece of complexity and balance. I'm curious if my additional cellaring allowed the beer to mellow and mature than the fresh sample I consumed 12/31/10."
"Bottle at the December Santa Cruz tasting. Pours dark gold with a foamy white head. Aromas of fleshy white stone fruits and white wine. Also some woody and floral notes. Peachy flavor with a touch of oaky butteriness as well as the unmistakeable chardonnay character. These guys threw a lot of stuff at the wall for this beer but somehow it all stuck. Very good."
"D: Too drinkable, this stuff goes down in the blink of an eye, but oh so smooth and well balanced! Forget about RR Temptation, this is the best pale aged in oak imo!"
"D - Sophisticated... Completely unique... A stellar offering and an epic introduction to Nebraska Brewing... Probably Nebraska's second greatest offering to this great nation after 311... This is worthy of always being on hand in the cellar... Though very well hidden, the 10% ABV keeps this from being slightly more drinkable..."
"HV"
"Flavor is also great! Medium body, yet crisp! Carbonation is on the high side. Lot's of fruits like orange and banana are coming to my attention. Chardonnay barrel aging was a wonderful idea for this Belgian blonde ale. Very nice characteristic...adding a nice booze warmth down to throat. A very tasty beer!"
"Out of a 750ml bottle. Pours a bright yet hazy golden orange color, seems to have some yeast particles floating about. Beautiful pure white head the left a sheet of foamy lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet from pale malts and candi sugar which is quickly followed by some tart lemon/vanilla oak notes from the aging. It really takes on the Chardonnay character. Some pepper in the aroma as well. The flavor is of a sweet pale malt; sweet from the candi sugar. There is some clovey phenols, touch of banana and then the dry white grape lemony notes. Solid french oak flavors, lemon and a touch of vanilla; this gives the beer a nice tart/sour edge which helps balance the sweet belgian pale ale style. The oak is more subtle in the flavor which works quite well for the style. The BSPA has a moderate body with fairly soft carbontion and has a good balance between sweet and tart. Some slight ABV awareness during the tasting but fairly tame for 10%. An interesting brew, most likely well received by the sour/tart saison lovers out there. The chardonnay barrel aging works well with the style, gives it a nice edge."
"Moutfeel is medium to full bodied, and just a touch on the sticky side. For me, the drinkability is really good."
