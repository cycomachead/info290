3.75,-6,,,,,,"	With every beer I plan to review, I open it roughly 10 minutes before pouring the first sampling of it... Many reasons for this; but my main purposes are to let it breathe, or aerate slightly, as well as giving it a moment to sit out and gain a few degrees in temperature... I wouldn't usually make note of this step, but when I opened this beer it popped louder than I've ever heard any beer pop in my existence, it was startling to say the least... Shortly after, a pointy cap of foam has since grown and fallen to the side resembling a ""santa-hat"" atop its' 750ml throne... It's a beautifully clear hazy beer, (if that makes sense) with far less carbonation present than it had me anticipating... Laughing to myself as I realize 20 minutes have passed and I've merely popped the cap - I grabbed the beer and ""gently"" poured it (via instructions on the label...) It poured light, dispensing a golden-yellow, but the head is so incredibly large I could hardly pour, what I consider to be, my rough ""standard"" amount!! It grew quickly to a rocky four inches and dissipated at a nice slow pace with a little spotty lacing left in it's wake... On the nose is a beautiful wheaty lemon aroma, with a very slight funk amongst some bread and oranges also... At first it tastes much like it smells and is extremely light on the palate... Midway through, more fruitiness arises in the form of possibly mango(?) as well as bananas(?) - regardless a mildly ""tropical"" element is presented... The finish is crisp and contains some more bread, leaving just a touch of bitterness from the hops... The mouthfeel is light at first, but the effervescence builds as it fills this beer out... Somewhat classic in style, it's an almost ""chic"" brew the way it's elements are fairly ""delicate," even in the bitterness of the hops - not to take away from the beer's complexity, flavor or craftsmanship... An easy drinker, probably best enjoyed on a sunny day, this represents a well crafted Belgian that should be enjoy by many... Another good brew - Cheers!!","NSXAG","Nov 05, 2014"

The aroma is light, slightly smelling of citrus and bread. The taste is of orange peel, a bit of tangerine sweetness and a very nice finish. There's definitely an abundance of characteristically Belgian yeast notes. The taste stays complex even after quite a few sips. I like this very much.","gabrielsyme","May 06, 2014"

This offering pours a very clear golden hue with an abundance of white foamy head and handsome lacing. The nose is overwhelmed by noble hops, belgian yeast, lemon, pepper, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a little skewed by the overly generous amount of carbonation but that's expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The flavor follows the nose but not quite as balanced the hops poke through a little too much and the malt is lacking. There are additional notes of west coast style hops that I'm not sure elevate the beer or just make it a little more interesting. This is a very good beer and one that I'll enjoy coming back to again. Great west coast take on a European style.","lochef81","Apr 21, 2014"

I tried pouring carefully and still ended up with a good three to four fingers of head. The nose on this beer has that distinct belgian yeastiness about it with a good malt presence. The brew has some nice resinous hop aromatics coming through which go nicely with the belgian characteristics. Terrific aroma! Taste is primarily sweet like a malty apple cider but with a pepper kick and some definite tartness to it as well. A little funky. Pretty typical Belgian characteristics with a hoppy west coast twist. Some bitterness from the hops coming through on the finish. Very crisp and dry mouthfeel. Over all this was a great beer that i rather enjoyed.","CA_brewster","Dec 31, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, pineapple, pear, apple, pepper, clove, floral, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, light pine, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast, hop, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, pear, apple, pineapple, wheat, bread, floral, grass, pepper, clove, light pine, and floral/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, tangerine, pineapple, pear, apple, floral, grass, light pepper, wheat, bread, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and moderately slick/crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong golden! All around great balance and complexity of malt, yeast ester, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 14, 2013"

Hefty amount of spice as well as a hefty amount of fruits with a good hand in the hops as well. The borderline acetone-like alcohol can be a bit fatiguing over time, but the brew is good in small doses. I wish some of these Bruery beers came in smaller serving sizes.","tectactoe","Jul 22, 2013"

Highly recommend to someone who whats to try a hopped up Duvel.","flayedandskinned","Beers"

I have tried SO many and still can't understand why ppl love it so much. The yeast is so overpowering, that you can't even make an assumptions of the type of malts/hops the brewer used. I've heard great things about The Bruery, and was hoping they would bring my love for belgian brews back to life. Sadly, Mischief did not do so...

Aromas of vinous vinegar, and a hint of hay. Taste begins with a a huge lemon blast up front, followed by some light grassyness, a hint of aspirin after that. Then herbal bitterness, intermingled with banana and a bit of clove. Finishes with a clean, dry bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich. Carbonation is super high, but that's not odd at all for this style. Overall a great BSPA. The extra hoppyness is nice, though its not so crazy that it overwhelms the rest of the beer.","tronester","Aug 27, 2012"

Nice Belgian spice aroma, somewhat sour. Whoa. Like a modest IPA crossed with a saison, a sour wild ale component with a hop kick without any noticeable hop flavors. Lots of bitter citrus.

Smell is of grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is of grain and yeast up front with spice flavors that lingers after each sip. There is a mild bitterness on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the spices are quite strong in the flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 17, 2012"

The Mischeif was a cloudy yellow in color, great carbonation and decent white head that reformed every time you swilled the glass. The smell included clove, banana, and hops (pine/citrus). The taste was surprisingly light and crisp....even though it was registering in the 8%+ ABV. This is a dangerous beer. The clove/spice and banana are present at the start and then the hops take over to clear the pallet. The mouthfeel is remarkedbly decent. If you see this....try it.","WoodBrew","Sep 19, 2011"

4.33,8.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a fresh growler I got at The Bruery yesterday. Pours a clear, bright golden color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is nice Belgian yeast with some profound hoppiness. A bit earthy with some citrus aromas as well. Taste is initially bright fruit flavors with a hint of floral notes. The slightest bit tart with some lovely Belgian yeast and spicy characteristics. This has a lot of the same characteristics as Snicklefritz does, just a lot less buttery. Finishes with lightly bittered hops for a crisp closing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale.

The smell of the beer was hoppy and had a good amount of Belgian yeast in there to balance it out. The taste of the beer was a little earthy, but has a big hoppy aftertaste to it. The mouthfeel was smooth at first then it switched over to a more tingly feeling that left the mouth dry. Overall I thought this beer was pretty interesting. It was much lighter in color than I thought it'd be. I'd say it's worth trying.","Knapp85","Jul 04, 2011"

I've had hoppy belgian pales that were more in balance. Most of the taste is dominated by resinous herbacious hops. Too much early addition hops, much of the belgian quality is hidden. However a rather dry mouthfeel, only slightly chewy. I'm just not that enamored with this beer. Too hoppy, or too many of the wrong hops at the wrong times of the boil.

First of all, gorgeous pour on this one - not to be missed. Unfortunately, it looks a bit better than it tastes. Drinking it, there's a bit of complexity. It begins with a bit of a citrusy fruit mixture, turns greener, sourer, and finally, toward a dry, earthy finish. I think at the start, the beer is fantastic, but something gets lost in the finish. Maybe something gets added. I had the same feeling with the Saison Rue, that there was something amiss. It was almost like both of these were just barely not fresh enough to retain the intended character. Like something in the bottle twisted just enough to raise an eyebrow. I enjoyed the beer, but not enough that I'd recommend it in a line up.

Man, you can smell that Belgian yeast good. Super smooth mouthfeel, kind of thick. Tastes of citrus and malt, almost a bit like lemon grass, which seems to dominate at times. This beer kind of confuses me. It's trying to achieve a few things all at once. It's got the Belgian aspect down, but then there's that citrus thing going on. Does this want the character of an American Pale Ale, too? Not even 1/4 of a way into it and I'm already wanting my next beer.

The high hopping adds some amazing attributes to the appearance, but there are slight imperfections with how it blends with the base beer. The 8.5% is nothing to sneeze at, but manageable if one drinks slowly (and not out of bounds for the style). I think this one could be tweaked slightly to either go full bore Belgian IPA (let's amp up the citrus and the herbal, minty notes) or the other way - either way would strike a really nice balance between the constituent parts of the base beer (which is expertly made, of course) and the hop components (which are nice, unsurprisingly).","CrellMoset","0"

Light orange to deeper yellow in hue, not especially hazy but not transparent either, dispersed if steady bubbles. The nose has a certain tightness to it, led by wet grass, pepper, unsweetened multi-grain bread and a shock of sour white grapefruit pith, blends in whole cloves and green apple to pear fruit scents, again there's not a lot of give and what is there evacuates in a straight line. Medium-bodied, the carbonation also has a tight weave to it, hints at foaming up but then pulls back. More than in the nose the orange marmalade to white grapefruit citrus is in clear control, tart, sour and bitter, omnipresent. Momentary brush of banana before meager pear, apple, pineapple fruit come on. Pine resin, coal tar and damp hay anchor it further onto the tongue. Hard to find any clear malt elements, perhaps some chocolate near the finish. A very muscular beer which makes you break a sweat with each sip.","farrago","Sep 24, 2010"

I was expecting this beer to be very Duvel-esc, but it is almost as if Duvel and an IPA had a baby. Orange, pear, coriander, a touch of clove, honey and herbal hops. There is a lot going on here. The one aspect of this beer that seems a bit one dimensional to me is the malt character. It is pretty much just pale and plain, but that is okay since it accentuates the hops and yeast. This beer has a medium mouthfeel that is fairly smooth and finishes fairly dry. It is almost as if it first coats my mouth then evaporates. It is an interesting and enjoyable texture.

The fermentation character is too light to stand up to the hops, despite the fact that the hop character is not overly aggressive here. All of this is despite the fact that I served this on the warm side. I do like the hop character here, it is perfect for a Pale Belgian beer of this strength, but it really needs some interesting yeast derived flavors to make this truly interesting. Despite all my complaining, this is actually a pretty tasty beer. There are no major flaws and it is hard to screw up bright hops, even if the background is a bit cleaner than I expected; really the fermentation character plays more of a supporting / subservient role than I was expecting, but does compliment the hops well.","Gueuzedude","May 01, 2010"

While it is very good, it could be better. More bitterness would be my first request. I like the hop flavor, but it's crying out for a little more bitterness. More carbonation would help, too.

Smells include alot of citrus with alot of lemon and some grapefruit. Come to think of it hops take up most of the smell including a floral scent. A small bready malt base and a Belgian yeast strain imparting some odd odors. Taste is a floral IPA with Belgian yeast. The hops take up room with grapefruit and floral notes. Im getting a huge amount of lemon. Some biscuit malt and a candi like vibe going. The feel is lighter than medium and the carb is quite pumped up.

This is followed by a sweet pineapple flavor along with pepper. There is some candy like sweetness but it is not cloying and is offset with some hoppy bitterness. It could use some more yeasty flavors, seems to be a bit lacking in that department. The brew has a moderate feel with rather soft carbonation, well balanced though finishes slightly bitter.

The aroma is sort of like a muted Belgian IPA, some grassy hops and light fruits (pear, peach, maybe mango), a little earthy too. Really nice, and the taste follows the same profile. Pale malts might be responsible for the mild sweetness in the taste, in any case it's balanced well against the Belgian hops flavors. Not very bitter, a lot of grass and tropical fruits, excellent.","TurdFurgison","Feb 27, 2010"
3.83,-4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer poured a cloudy amber color and formed a huge foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided acting much like a float. A heavy amount of carbonation can be slightly seen. An aroma of malt, hops, pine, citrus and candy. The flavor was of malt, hops, pepper and candy. The body was medium light and the finish slightly sweet and sprite. An alright beer, but not a strong representation of the style.","Wildman","Feb 27, 2010"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a 2 inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, pineapple, orange peel and some bready malt. Taste is fruity and hoppy. There's tropical fruit, pine and citrusy hops, peppery spice, and some bready malt flavors that I notice. There's also a light lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good, solid overall brew. I liked it.","bluejacket74","Feb 26, 2010"

3.8,-4.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a dirty gold with good head that died slowly and left lace patches. Sour smell coupled with some sharp hops and citric notes and a touch of sugary malt. Light to medium body with some tart fruit notes along with the spices and orange/citric note. Little prickly, my only complaint is that the malts are a little subdued and it lent a somewhat sour, tart backbite. Still, a good beer to enjoy sipping on.","clayrock81","Feb 20, 2010"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a cloudy orange yellow color with a certain glow. A medium sized and very sticky peach toned head sits atop of the brew. Piney, resinous fresh hops, orange/grapefruit peel, marshmallow and a fruity yeast note. More of a Belgian style IPA to me, very hop driven and mouth tingling spicy, a long aftertaste of orange rind and sweet malt finish things up. The high-er alcohol content is apparent but not completely threatening, good drinkability for its size, quaffable. A must try for fans of the style and the brewery.","ATPete","Feb 19, 2010"

3.33,-16.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Smells of some bright hop aromatics initially, but these seem to fade as it warms. Semi-sweet apples and booze come out as it comes closer to room temp with some general belgian fruity esters and bread. Taste is similar, a little more yeasty (tons of sediment in this bottle towards the bottom). A little bready maltiness with some earth leads to a drying, biting, semi-medicinal spice note in the finish. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. I drank the whole 750mL myself but it got to be a bit of a chore towards the end. Interesting enough but not one of my favorites from the Bruery so far. Might be better on tap or with a fresher bottle after they continue to perfect the recipe.","Ineedabeerhere","Feb 07, 2010"

A prominent hop nose that is floral upfront, but bouquet of herbs and citrus fruit with a Belgian yeasty spiciness. Creamy and soft, medium carbonated and bodied.Tastes of biscuit malt, oranges, and some caramel sweetness. Herbal hop flavor takes over and lends a clean and dry bitterness that is not harsh at all. Faint alcohol on the breath. Flavor profile slanted towards the hoppy side, and in a good way. An intriguing Belgian style that is hoppy enough but has just the right malt sweetness to keep the drinker coming back for more. Well crafted and highly enjoyable.","TheJollyHop","Feb 01, 2010"

Medium thick body, light carbonation, very soft smooth texture; not quite expected for this style. Body has strong malt and Belgian yeast background with a musty, citrus hop flavor that lingers throughout the finish. The flavor isn't very complex and the finish is a musty, earthy mess; not very pleasant.

4.08,2.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Hop forward medium body with a ton of dry earthy bitterness balanced by a prominent citrus sweetness. Dank oily resinous hops with a lot of lemon peel, grapefruit and mango, countered by a very subtle graham cracker/biscuit malt presence. Lots of earthy pine notes provides a nice dryness that lasts throughout, providing balance to the sweet notes. Slight alcohol presence comes through mid-palate and lingers into the finish. There's also a bit of estery Belgian yeast that provide some light fruit notes, especially apple, pear and grape. Pretty complex with a nice combination of west coast IPA and Belgian Pale Ale characteristics. The 8.5% ABV is decently masked, making this beer relatively drinkable. Very good!","corby112","Oct 09, 2009"
4.29,7.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The pour is hazy yellow with a thin, soapy head. Not terribly impressive, but that's the only part of the beer I can say that about. The nose is absolutely glorious - citrus dry hop character with orange, tangerine and a touch of yeast in the back. A mild sweetness is present, bringing to mind a fruity orange-lemon marmalade. Awesome stuff. The flavor is just as good, opening with plenty of hop flavor with citrus, honey and a touch of floral character. Honey-like with ripe orange and plenty of tropical fruit and a touch of spice (white pepper). The finish is dry and fruity with orange and a touch of jackfruit. With low bitterness, a light body that's a tad slick and very soft palate, this is one enjoyable - and drinkable - beer.","DefenCorps","Oct 05, 2009"
