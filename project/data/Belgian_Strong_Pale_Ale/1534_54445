4.4,15.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"I am drinking a canned version and upon popping the tab, faint bitter hops support large pitted fruit on the nose. It pours hazy gold under a very pillowy head that persists and leaves thick lace all the way down. The palate starts with fruit balancing a line between peach and apricot with citrus, very faint grapefruit, orange, bread and light grains in the background and traces of caramel. The bitter on the finish suggests earthy grapefruit rind. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium high. While the beer is very creamy, the canned version tastes artificially carbonated opposed the the natural carbonation in the bomber bottles and the dcanned versions carbonation feels a little harsher – not as smooth as the bottle conditioned variety.","pat61","Mar 12, 2015"

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Pours a hazy gold with thick fluffy white head, big spray of lace on the glass, sheet for the first couple of inches. Smell: banana pudding, coriander, notes of pepper, dried pineapple, and grass. Taste: candied lemon peel, dried pineapple and banana, spicy on fair amount of pale malt sweet, then saltine with notes of banana, clove, pepper. Medium bodied, fine creamy carbonation, but finish is really dry and a bit metallic and chili pepper-ish, which was odd. From corked and caged 750 bottled 10/2013. Good but the finish leaves a lot to be desired.","babaracas","Dec 20, 2014"

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/30/2012. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, clove, pepper, honey, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a nice crisp malt/yeast balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. There is a lightly astringent flavor note appearing after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian strong pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 21, 2014"

4.05,6.6,4,4,4,4,4.25,"lucifer is a wonderful example of the belgian strong golden or pale ale. it pours a hazy blonde color with an inch of patient white head that leaves heavy rings as it drinks. a nose of banana, much like a hefeweizen, but cleaner than that, without the spice. other fruit esters are present as well, and there is a light floral quality. the flavor is very similar, yeast driven. on tap i get quite a bit more hop than i do from the can, which may be slightly dated, but i almost prefer the mellow hop bitterness to a more robust experience. the carbonation is through the roof on this, which gives it refreshment value and also makes it seem much lighter than its 8% abv, which will trick you into an early and heavy buzz if you arent careful. love the cereal grain qualities, and the way the yeast becomes so summery as it finishes. under appreciated i think, this is a beer of very high quality that is widely available. a great illustration of this often butchered style. a true belgian classic.","StonedTrippin","Mar 12, 2014"

I really enjoyed the nice oxidized fruit notes and the pleasant malty finish, but there was too much of the candi/bubblegum sweetness for my tastes. With that said, you can tell it’s of a higher abv but you certainly can’t detect any notes of alcohol, due in large part to the sweetness. Overall, it’s nothing to go out of your way for but enjoyable nonetheless.","CowsandBeer","Mar 01, 2014"

"Fruity aroma"?!? It smelled like somebody was chewing an entire pack of Juicyfruit gum! Color was a slightly-hazy sunshine-yellow. I leaned in for a better sniff and caught not only mixed fruit, but also a yeasty mustiness. Oh my! Mouthfeel was soft, caressing on the tongue with a very fruity flavor in the mouth. "Delicate bitterness"? Too delicate to register on my palate, apparently, but I am not usually drinking this style for its associated IBUs. Finish was semi-dry with the yeast causing a dryness in my throat on the extreme finish.

A light body that is easy to drink and smooth yet retains a crispness thanks to lively carbonation and some spicy notes on the backend. Some sugary goodness balances out citric tartness so the beer is neither too tart or sweet. Also, picked up touches of other light fruit like pear or white grape skin that give off a sweet fruit taste and a sour note or two as well.

Overall, good blend, appearance, aroma, and body.","Tone","Aug 17, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours mid-pale gold with a tight, quick head. A little sharp up front, and the flavor profile is solidly in the Belgian Strong Pale Ale tradition. Alcohol is a bit prominent, seeming even bigger than the 8% listed here. Teetered on the edge of harsh, but managed to pull back enough to be drinkable. Still just a touch hot, though.","Brent","Jul 29, 2011"

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer poured out surprisingly clear looking. I thought for sure there would be some haze to this one. The color of the beer was a bright yellow, the head was big and fluffy white. The lacing was scattered and soapy looking. The smell of the beer had a nice floral quality to it along with some Belgian yeast in there too. The taste of the beer got better as it warmed up. The flavors of some light hops and floral spice come in strong here. The mouthfeel was light and bubbly. Overall I like this beer, found it to be pretty enjoyable.","Knapp85","Jun 18, 2011"

Taste is of citrus fuit, malt, slight hop presence, green apple, green fruit and a slight white grape tannic property. Nice lush mouthfeel, good use of carbonation and nice weight overall.

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The flavor is as the nose suggests, and to be honest, I'd swear this beer was a little bit more on the aggressive side before... alas, this is fairly smooth and easy drinking, and the alcohol never shows. It's delicately fruity (apples, pear), and sweetish without becoming candyish, honeyish, or cloying. There's some malty graininess to it, and there's just enough hop character and yeasty spice threaded through to give it some guts. It's well rounded, well balanced, and clean with just enough character to keep you coming back for more.","NeroFiddled","Feb 10, 2011"
3.78,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours clear gold with a XXL head, no cloudiness if you pull back on the pour. Smells yeasty and musty with some malt aroma. Flavor is very nice, full bitter with no piney bite and a slight sweetness that is barely noticeable. Very carbonated feel, but remarkably quick to drink. Not as impressive as it's devil brother Duvel (doo-vel), but similar in it's strength and flavor in many ways. A good beer that is worth the try.","Wegomlegging","Feb 05, 2011"

3.98,4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Seven and a half years ago, a beer under this name got a thumbs down from me, as produced by Riva. Since Het Anker has been brewing it, I can't find a flaw. Though I don't normally prefer blondes, this is one I'll reach for now and then.","feloniousmonk","Nov 06, 2010"

Enough yeast in the aroma to remind you that it's a Belgian beer. The taste was somewhat light and sugary, with a touch of fruity Kool-Aid up front and zero bitterness at the back end. It gained some density as it warmed; still, it was lacking character. Worth a glass but nothing more.","gfreed","Oct 06, 2010"

It was a golden yellow, cloudy with over an inch of foam on the top and a nice bit of effervescence. The smell was fruity, a characteristic banana yeast aroma with no obvious hint of hops. It had a big banana flavor - not surprising for this style - with a light note of hop spice in the background. Very much a malt taste. Dry finish. So enjoyable.","sonata2008","0"

Taste is more grainy than citrusy, pepper doesn't become prevalent until the beer is fully warmed, dry finish. Medium dry mouthfeel but not overly so, a bit sticky.

I happened to have a few bottles of Duvel in the cellar, so I cracked one for a side by side. Duvel smells a bit sweeter while Lucifer has a bigger grassy hop nose and is a bit more floral I think. Taste wise, Duvel is again a bit sweeter, while the grassy and spicy characters of Lucifer jump out more. I stand by my original assessment; this is better than Duvel. It even keeps more stick than Duvel. I never had the old version of Lucifer brewed by Riva, and there are very few reviews of this new one so far, but in my opinion this is an absolutely exceptional beer.
