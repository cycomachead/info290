There is a sweet fruitiness as well along with dates and dark fruit.  The flavour is much of the same along with an alcohol warmness.  Not the burn that you might expect with a 11.8% ABV.  The mouthfeel is a bit on the syrupy side but that adds to the experience because the carbonation balances it out.","Svingjo","Dec 28, 2014"

AROMA: sweet malt background with caramel and spicy notes. strong spicy alcohol presence but not solventy. APPEARANCE: coppery color and translucent. average ivory head with good retention. lacing is present due to high alcohol derived viscosity. TASTE: sweet caramely like flavour. high alcohol presence. low bitterness and a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-low body with a strong alcohol presence. OVERALL: a beer that lacks the malt complexity of the competition and with a very strong alcohol presence.","titvs","Oct 19, 2014"

3.8,-1.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,"a classic belgian strong amber beer with a lot of character. the most impressive thing about it is the feel, and how well it hides its intense alcoholic strength, its barley there, not the least bit hot, and rather smooth drinking as a result. slightly hazy orangey amber in color with a patchy white head that lasts. i smell a lot of residual sugar here, sweet dusty almost english type grain on this, with a robust belgian yeast strain that gives off some dried apricot notes and maybe even a little apple. the sweetness is there, but its short lived, the finish is still pretty quick on it, and the big carbonation makes it drink a little cleaner too. i like the elegant simplicity of this beer, despite also being dynamic and very strong, it comes across well refined and completely dialed in. they do a refermented in the bottle addition of this, which i have to imagine is even more enjoyable with the rest of its sugar gone, but i like the little brother edition here. definitely an underrated brew.","StonedTrippin","Jan 26, 2014"

I am not sure why I passed on this before..It is a festive beer that I could have shared, but I am glad I didn't. The overall drinkability for a beer this strong is exceptional. It is pretty warming but that is part of the charm since the malt flavor and obvious candy sugar usage are utilized so well.","Slatetank","May 17, 2013"

The head is an off white color and sticks around for quite a while and is accompanied by some good lacing. The floating fermentation looks very inviting! The aroma is rather light but very complex. There’s plenty of yeast, dark fruits, esters, caramel, fig, mild grape and malts in the smell. It has a much lighter body than you would expect, very drinkable, but still on the lighter side of being medium bodied oddly enough. All of these flavors blend together into one wave that just slowly rides over the tongue. No cloying sweetness, crisp finish. With a dash of medicinal herbs mixed in, this beer is just simply incredible in its subtlety and complexity.","vickersspitfire","Oct 28, 2012"

The flavor has much of the same character, but with harsher phenolic notes and an intensity imparted by the high alcohol content. The lingering malt and yeast notes create even more complexity on the palate in the aftertaste with a creamy, boozy fruit character that is pleasantly brandy-like.

This is more similar to a stronger Tripel or BSPA compared to other Quads being more like a stronger Dubble or BSDA (although it isn't exactly like either of those 2 styles). Alcohol is very present and so it is reminiscent of a fruity liqueur or a fortified wine, and is probably best thought of as something similar to those when you are deciding when/how to drink it or treat it.

A little spicy and yeasty as well; has some minor hop bitterness also (yes, I ended a sentence w/ a preposition). Must say, while the ABV could be partially responsible for the drying backbite, it is mostly hidden (I would've guessed 8 or 9, tops, not at all 12).

Seemed a bit light for a quad, but it looked nice. The nose had a bit of lemon, grass, and, oddly, a bit of powdered sugar. Light, but nice. The taste was hard to describe: bittersweet, with lots of alcohol. Not much character. The mouth was medium-light, with a bit higher carbonation - or perhaps alcohol burn?

Taste was more of the same with some malty sweetness as well. Some alcohol crept in at mid-glass, but surprisingly not too strongly, considering this is a 12% abv.

Taste begins with a candied sugar sweetness along with very ripe and juicy fruit (pineapple, mango, peach, papaya). A rather pronounced spiciness is also present with notes of coriander and white pepper with a fainter taste of white cake in the background. Citrusy warming alcohol is also apparent. Theres a lot going on in this beer. The bottle may be rather small, but at 12% ABV, its more than enough for a nightcap.","Morris729","Sep 27, 2006"

The initial sips indicate this is nothing but an after dinner liqueur. Ultimately the subtle elements come out nicely including a hoppy dark fruit finish which I did not expect.

I suspect the caramel flavors are due to large additions of sugar in the boil kettle. This gets the abv up, but also creates a dryer mouthfeel, then say a barleywine.

The aroma is pretty well blocked by the thick frothy head but I can still percieve a lot of fruity esters and a touch of sweet malt. The flavor is different than i expected from a quad as i thought it would be just like a really strong tripel but the malt flavors are more sweet than dry and the alcoholic heat is hidden a lot less well than in tripels. The flavor begins with a sweet malt and a lot of fruityness from the esters and a touch of an ironlike taste that i am very sensitive to and it is not very nice. Still the flavor overall is enjoyable and for how high in alcohol this beer is the finish is very clean and the flavors mesh very well with nothing sticking out except the alcoholic heat on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation has very little carbonic bite making this ale have a nice smoothness.

4.2,8.8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"25 cl bottle, under its alias ""Scaldis", bought at Selfridges, London. Amber colour, large and fluffy lingering head. Vinous dry sherry-like aroma, elements of oak and leather too. Flavour is again sherry-like, medium dry (or medium sweet, if you like), loads and loads of oak, hints of German ""Weinbrand", warming mouthfeel as expected from a 12% ABV beer, but the beer doesnt feel inappropriately alcoholic. A substantial hoppy bitterness in the finish balances the sweetness nicely. Plays in the Premier League of beers, this one.","Sigmund","Mar 07, 2005"

The taste shows strong alcohol notes, but overall interestingly mixed with fruity notes of peach and pear and malty notes of syrupy caramel. The finish in particular is nicely caramelized.

Light fruit taste like caramel covered fruit. After taste is a bit fruity with a bit of alcohol bite to it, more than you would want. Mouthfeel is lighter than usual for a quad but is smooth feeling.

Pretty good ride overall, definitely interesting... damn the tiny bottle which taunts me. The carbonation is almost distracting, it's so sharp in the mouth.

Apples and pears flowing into honey and light caramel malts, then to a dry alcoholic finish. Not as complex as what I would have thought originally, actually. Hopefully further warming will help that out a bit. Okay, guess not. At least it's consistent, right? Mouthfeel is not quite as thick and syrupy as the taste would have you believe, but the numbing alcohol wipes out any subtlety aside from the carbonation. Moderately drinkable, at least through the glass, but two or three of these in a night would slaughter my sense of taste, while four or more would slaughter my sense of good taste.","jlervine","Aug 02, 2004"

The palate is generally rather dry instead of the sweet and alcoholic typical big belgian I expected. It strikes me as zesty, bready, very alcoholic and hoppier than I thought with a big flowery and almost grassy hop profile that leads into a long bitter and spicy (cloves) finish.

The aroma is very nice, a heady mixture of malt, honey and alcohol. Unfortunately the flavor doesn't come close to fulfilling the promise in the aroma. The body is carbonated with a rather Lager-ish character. Peppery alcohol and sweet caramel malt see-saw back and forth throughout. The finish is dry and lightly bitter.

These are joined by notes of orange, sherry, apricot, and a liquor like sweet aroma. The taste is only lightly sweet up front (drier than the nose would suggest). It finishes with a mix of fruity orange flavors and alcohol. This is much lighter in body than I was expecting. This beer is definitely malt dominated, the alcohol hotness is the next most dominant flavor. In fact the alcohol is a bit too much, there needs to be more beer here to tone down the hot alcohol notes.

Almost like a barley cough syrup with a woody, estery finish. Mouthfeel is rather syrupy, yet the alcohol and esteriness work to counterbalance this. This was served in an authentic Scaldis/Bush tuliped glass that measured ~17 oz. full, so 13-14 oz. of one was enough for me.

Although this beer could probably offer much more, the higher alcohol content seems to limit it, as the taste does not change much throughout a glass.
