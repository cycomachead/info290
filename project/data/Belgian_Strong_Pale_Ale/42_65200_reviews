"Really solid, I recommend this to my customers often. The booze is completely hidden. A bit sweet, but not cloying. I prefer Hennepin beer to beer but it's really good."
""

"Great belgium strong pale.  As good as they get.  Better than duvel IMO."
""
""
""
"At 9.5% abv, this beer masks the alcohol extremely well.  It's the definition of a warming beer - but thanks to the moderate body, and big peachy aromas, this beer stays very relevant in the springtime.  I can enjoy this year-round."
"It warms my senses with each ensuing sip that is built upon the toasted bread, Belgian yeast strain, meaty fruits, coriander, pepper, and a bitter finale.  Luscious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cascade of pale yellow to amber. Good head upon pour reduces to excellent lacing retention. Smells of cloves, flowers, and a little funk. Banana and citrus undertones. Crisp biscuit and cloves on the nose. Transitions to lagered hops, malted cream, and some bitter cinnamon. On the back palate a bit of pepper, warm spice, some more skunky hops, and little clove. Crisp citrus aftertaste, a little skunky hops, and some cinnamon. Very complex flavor profile. Crisp and bold mouthfeel. Very good. 4.25 out of 5."
""
""
""
""
"Gold with vigorous carbonation and an awesomely thick, lumpy Belgian head.  Lacing sticks to the glass in clumps.  Hefty yeast aromas of fruity esters, clove, and peppercorns along with a pale malt sweetness, herbs, and a little bubblegum.  Yeasty flavor as well, starting off a little more rustic, before settling into dried fruit, citrus, phenolics, and spices.    There's more bite to the taste overall, but a sweetness from the malts helps round it out.  Despite the high ABV, the feel stays fairly crisp and drinkable, drying out into the finish.  Smooth and leaning towards full bodied.  Not tremendously complex or anything, but well crafted."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is a winner. Lot of flavor, easy drinking, nice feel. I am a big fan of both breweries that came together for this one, and the beer does not disappoint. One of the best I have had from Ommegang, will definitely be getting more of this."
""
"Overall- A nice showcase of Belgian yeast. There is plent of it here. A Strong ale for sure. Well done. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Also, how did they hide all that alcohol? No burn at all."
""
""
""
""
"Opaque golden body with an off-white head. Fruity, earthy, yeasty, pear and green apple tart notes. Hides its 9.5% ABV nicely with flavor."
""
"Overall - This was a total surprise. While I figured it would be a good beer, I had no idea it would be quite that impressive. I was completely taken aback by its quality. The store manager at the place I went to may not know what he has on his hands, so I will probably go buy him out of this stuff. Absolutely Condor recommended and approved."

"Had this at Brown Iron Brewery on tap and it was very good Belgian Blonde, one of better ones I've had.  Would recommend trying."
"Overall: A truly impressive Belgian style offering that for the most part is Belgian (by ownership) but brewed in America. It ranks right up there with the best. If the sweetness was dropped a slight bit it might even be confused for some of the finest Belgians, but then it wouldn't be very unique. Interesting, completely satisfying, and almost compellingly drinkable - worth seeking out!"
"Overall:  What a delicious, outstanding Belgian-style pale ale!  Malty, spicy, funky, slightly sweet, delicious!  Highly recommended!"
"Another winner from Ommegang!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with two fingers of dense but fizzy white foam, settles quickly to a thin layer, a few streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: sugar cookie, spicy and mildly herbal hopping, fruity - pear, grape and white peach. Taste: sugary pear, mildly spicy, sugar cookie, white grape juice, bubblegum note, then peach skin finish. Fairly full bodied, carbonation is dialed in to almost hit that velvety feel. In the end a little sweet, but really tasty. Hmm, stamped best by 01/2015, but seems to have plenty of time left."
""
""
"Overall, this beer lived up to my expectations.  I am a fan of the Ommegang brewery and I like le Chouffe so when I saw the le Chouffe gmomes dancing on an Omegong bottle, I had to try it.  This is a sweet blonde ale with some great spicing.  The blend of spices is so balanced that it is difficult to pick out individual flavors.  In short, this was an excellent blonde ale to sample around the holidays."
"So good that I texted my grampa while drinking it and told him I was Groot."
""
""
"A reviewer below reviewed Gnomegang on 12/7/14.  They defined the beer as a ""bit too hoppy for my liking.""  Also feeling that the hop content was not harmonious with a belgian yeast profile.  I see a contradiction in thought process here.  To say that the beers harmony is compromised by the hop profile, demonstrates some palate savvy, along with the ability to produce an articulate insight.  A very useful quality.  However, to say that it's too hoppy for their liking, leads me to believe that they are part of the Shock Top crowd, thus should not be rating a beer like this.  Consequently, they shouldn't be indoctrinating themselves into craft beer by drinking Gnomegang.  Rather, they should start with something like Yuengling, or however the heck you spell it.  Gnomegang is not hop forward, not by any stretch.   Drink seltzer."

""
"Spectacular array of belgian flavor.  Poured half of the 12oz bottle into a tulip and an astounding amount of head came out.  So good...so good. Pronounced blonde ale speciness like a leffe, floral sweet ester aroma. hazy golden color.high 9.5 abv. Sweet finish typical of the Belgians low IBUS."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A interesting and tasty brew overall.  One to try if you get a chance."
"Glad I only purchased a single of this one, a bit too hoppy for my liking which seems incongruous with the strong yeasty flavor."

"12  oz bottle.  Pours hazy orange with fluffy, white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of funky yeast, bready malt and herbal hops.  Body is full, oily and crisp.  Taste is of spicy yeast, biscuit malt, herbal hops, cotton candy, alcohol and ripe pears.  Finish is very dry. Very tasty brew."
"Ommegang/Duvel:  A little slice of heaven where we need it most."

"O: [2.75] Wheat beers are not my thing and this is on the less desirable end of that spectrum.  I just did not enjoy this beer.  Don't read my review if you like wheat beers."
"O: What a lovely holiday release from Ommegang. It has that signature Belgian taste to it, and is crafted well enough to where you are exposed to the flavors rather than the alcohol content. Incredibly drinkable, downright sessionable. It has that wonderful flowery bite of a pale, the smoothness of a blonde, and the fruity piquancy of a tripel. Wonderfully done."

"Great crisp taste. I have grown fond of the higher alcohol beers over the last few months. This is the first time I have had this one but it has been great"

""
""
""
""
"O: this is pretty damn drinkable for what it is... has a passing resemblance to Delirium Tremens, but that beer comes off a bit harsher and drier from the bottle... the Chouffe yeast is f'n royalty among the Belgians - I could drink this shtuff all day"
""

"A tad on the sweeter side for me.  Has subtle yeast and spicy qualities.  Descent drinking."

"Love ommegang brews, but not this one. It misses the mark.  Leaves a nasty after taste that requires a cheesesteak and a miller lite to wash away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O a great offering from two great breweries I lean towards the chouffe side normally and was not disappointed a great example of a Belgian strong. . Highly recommend"
"Pours a nice cloudy orange hay with yeast floating around. The two finger head quickly dissipates but shows no signs of disproportionation or other flaws. The aroma is clean and the spice is indistinguishable showing they are doing an excellent job. Has some aromas similar to weiss beers like bubblegum. Drinks very clean with light small bubbles and a well rounded yeast taste on the palate."
""

"Nice orange color, towering thick white head, good lacing on the glass.  Nose brings promise of orange rind and pith, coriander, spiciness, cut flowers and fruit.  Taste doesn't follow through all the way.  Citrus and fruitiness with some of the spiciness in the finish.  Alcohol is present, but doesn't distract.  Mouthfeel is light side of medium with tingly almost prickly levels of carbonation and a dry finish.  A very good beer but I'm not convinced its worth the price tag."

"Part of this reminded me of a Witbier since the yeast and funk wasn't too strong and the alcohol was recessed enough that this seemed like a session beer. Obviously, the latter was not the case here as I could feel the booze kicking in by the time I finished this bottle off. I have to admit that many of Ommegang's beers start to taste the same to me after a while but when they're good enough to be mistaken with something imported, who cares? I don't and this was another great example of why I love these guys so much. A hint of spice combined with Belgian fruity flavors and the perceived absence of alcohol combined for a beer that I'll reach for again, even if I don't consider it to be a categorical anomaly. Fun stuff!"

"Overall / Drinkability: Refreshing, wonderfully crafted, and a great savoring/sipping beer. Alcohol well hidden and this beer is dangerously drinkable. I suspect if I had bought a 4 pack rather than a single I'd be cracking open another bottle and regretting it later. But the wonderful flavor of this beer is making me wish I had bought that 4 pack rather than the single, which tells me overall this a great and very drinkable beer. I am indeed wowed by the flavor of this beer."

""
"On tap at Hops and Pie. Golden yellow color, minimal head. Aroma of strong Belgian yeast, fruity, spicy. Flavor was yeasty, very fruity, very Belgian. Not quite my cup of tea but a well made Belgian strong golden for sure. Would I order this again? No but I'd buy abotyle for my girlfriend, she liked it a lot."

"Overall: A very solid take on a Belgian Pale Ale. Good mix of fruit and spice esters with a smooth body."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good overall but I expected more. Specifically, I would have liked a light, spicier, more effervescent BSPA."
""
""
""
"This beer is better than I expected. It has a hazy, floatie laden beer..the head is enormous and lasting. The smell is fruity...apricot, peach, pear, and lots of Belgian, bubblegum and clove yeast. Mope prey, but very sweet smelling. The taste is slanted sweet, with a continuation of the fruit theme. Spice in the mid taste and a hoppy bitter finish. Great beer."

"An outstanding Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a quality strong ale. My staple is Ommegang's Hennepin, which sets the bar high for Saisons along with Dupont, but when i want something stronger this is where I land. If you're a fan of Victory's Golden Monkey, also a very good beer, you'll like this...smoother than GM."
"This is a great beer from Ommegang. It's on par with everything they do. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has the family characteristic of just too damn much yeasty intensity. The flavor is good, it's just totally relentless. It give you no space for savoring. A water chaser is needed. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent take on the style. The spice and yeast contributions remind me a lot of a tripel, which makes sense given that a case could probably be made that tripels are essentially just a subset of Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It's taken me far too long to finally try this and now that I have, I'll have to make a habit out of picking some up from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Interesting but not much more in my opinion. Didn't really like the flavors presented here. Still an average to above average beer so I won't kill it; I can objectively see why people would like it but I won't be rushing to grab any more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a quality Belgian ale. All flavors are in their right place and not muddled. She is very easy to drink for being a little strong. She is well crafted and very appealing to me. Maybe Ommegang should start using Chouffe yeast hybrid. Another outstanding ale from Ommegang. This is recommended."

"From my tasting notes: The Gnomegang was a Belgian Golden Ale in the same vein as Duvel. It poured a golden color with a generous fizzy head. There was plenty of sweet malts in the aroma balance by their trademark yeasts. The taste was bright and sweet with a hint of honey and plenty of that farmhouse flavor. It hides its high alcohol content well and maintains its excellence as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Lots of carbonation moves the medium bodied beer luxuriously over the tongue."

"I had this at Oblivion Tap Room here in Orlando Florida and was very unimpressed with it. It poured well in a cloudy gold tint with a nice head. It smelled slightly of cloves with hints of what I thought was bananas. As soon as I tried it, it easily was one of the worst beers that I have had recently. I could not taste what was going on with it. Not balanced at all but very complex and left a sweet bitter after taste. You could taste nothing but the cloves. I could not finished it, for me it was that bad. Possibly I got a bad batch but will not take the change of ordering it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On-tap at Oblivion in Orlando. Pours a slightly hazy golden orangish color with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is very fruity with banana and some spices. The taste is incredibly smooth for a beer of such potency with fruity notes of apples and spices in the finish with some warmth from the alcohol. Overall, glad I tried this collaboration from two great breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really good. A terrific BSPA. Great example of the style, in my view."
""
""
"O: This beer lacks the complexity of some of the good beers in the style but is still pretty good and quite drinkable considering its strength."
""
"Overall a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm particularly impressed with this beer as I have brewed a number of batches with the Chouffe yeast. I did a Belgian Blonde which came out similar to this one. I take my hat off to the brewery for doing such a wonderful job with this very enjoyable beer."

"O - I remember drinking this beer a few years ago when it was only available in 750ml and liking it a lot. Now, it's only available in a mixed 8 pack and it's the star of the show. Give me this beer in 4 packs and I'd be a happy camper. A Gnomegang / Three Philosophers 8 pack would find a frequent home in my fridge."

"Pour produces a small fluffy head which quickly dissipates. Appearance is a golden color, opaque. Nice lacing on the way down. Smells of sourdough, mango, green apples. Taste is excellent. Belgian yeast, pepper, pear, some citrus. Medium mouthful that fluffs up nicely with a little swish. Finishes dry. Overall, very enjoyable, will definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As high a mark I can give a beer without tasting all the beers in the world. I paid $15 for a 750 ml champagne corked bottle and I would do it again. I highly recommend this, Ommegang is awesome and this is a great beer by them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus, slight earthy malt, yeast, herbs, and floral hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, spice, alcohol, dark citrus, floral hops, herbs, and slight yeast. Overall, weak appearance, but good aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid and delicious BSPA. I nice twist with Chouffe and Ommegang yeast too. Might have to get more."
"Pours a cloudy golden hue with much yeast suspended. Not much head, just a ring and some rings of lace. Smells great. Fruity and spicy with a great yeasty aroma with some banana. Taste consists of ripe fruit and slightly sweet. Tart apple with sweet pear and spicy peppery yeast. Warming alcohol on the finish that is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation and finishes dry. Overall this is quite an enjoyable strong golden ale! Nice work Ommegang!"

"Overall: Very good beer, one of the best I've had from Ommegang, and I generally like most of their beers. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Overall: This was a solid choice that I'll keep collecting and pushing on others that visit. I loved it. It might need to be rated higher, but still being a rookie at this (5 months on the craft beer scene) I'm hesitant to give it much more. I still want to try others, but Ommegang has been a wonder at introducing me to BPAs. Fun fun."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: coming into this beer I was a little intrigued. The more I tasted, the more I truly enjoyed. A great addition to my spring time beer list. The sweet flavors and aroma of lemon, peach, and even banana whilst being rounded out by bitter, deep malts. I would definitely enjoy this beer again and would totally recommend this to a friend to enjoy a breezy, spring night. Cheers!"
"On a side note, I really like beers from Ommegang and Achouffe. They are two of my favorite breweries, but I wasn't a huge fan of this collaboration."
""
""
"overall: had this right after the hennepin. they are both similar, but the gnomegang was just a little more harsh in just about every way. still a delicious brew, but i prefer other offerings from ommegang. still one to try!"

"Pours a hazy orangey golden with a yellowish hue and a nice white head that sticks to the sides. Aroma is wonderfully yeasty providing some spiciness, some pepper, there is some citric fruitiness in there too. Flavor follows the aroma but on steroids with a nice dry finish. A crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, fantastic brew."
""
"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 1/23/2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt balance. Taste of big lemon, apple, pear, grape, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, and floral on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters; with a great malt/spice flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong pale ale! Huge balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with light-moderate malt sweetness; and dangerously smooth and crisp to sip on for 9.5%. An insanely delicious offering."

"very very good beer, hope they release this year round."
"This beer is really quite good! In fact, I would say it is on the cusp of being world class. I know there are better versions out there, but I have not had them yet so I can't compare. I am going to say that I feel confident in giving this beer 4's in all the categories. It's really excellent! Well balanced and pleasant."
"Smells wheaty. Mild carbonation, mild flavor. Light bodied mouthfeel. Balanced hops/malt, slightly sweet with vanilla and orange notes. Maybe just my inexperience but it tases remarkably similar to a wit. Typical beer for me, goes down easy, could drink several of these - hides the 9.5% ABV well."

"The flavor has that bandaid, pineapple and citrus peel, a bready malt along with lots of spice character like black pepper, alcohol hits on the back and dries the beer out. Slightly dry on the finish."

"Pours a hazy orangeish gold with a creamy,frothy, foamy white head that sticks very nicely. The smell is simple, clean, and fruity. It has a grain note but is primarily dominated by the yeast which is fruity with hint of clove. After it gets some time to oxidize you can smell some faint peppery, herbal hop aromas. The flavor is very malty with the taste of grains, but with an infusion of rather spicy yeast. It is rather sweet, but not overpoweringly so."
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a really, really great beer if you’re into BSPAs. At its high points, it showcases the Chouffe and Ommegang strains in a way that they complement one another. You can actually tell them apart in some ways, but they meet at certain points, too, particularly in the tart, lemony character. This is without a doubt one of my favorite American-made Belgian-style beers, and I’m going to look forward to this from Ommegang in the future, as well."

"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the spice and muskiness through the finish of the flavoring. This imparted a genuine Belgian feel and flavor, as is seen with most of Ommegang’s offerings. The high abv, overt fumy booze, and warming qualities kept things interesting. Where we lost points was in the sweetness of the flavoring, which became a bit cloying by the end, and cut the pale and inherent drinkability of the style. Otherwise things were tasty, and we’ll be happy to see what another few months does to this guy."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. 2011 vintage. Poured into a snifter. White fluffy head, high retention on a hazy, almost opalescent golden body. Aroma includes lemon, grass, lemon peel, some banana and some light candi sugar. Mouth feel is tongue coating and dry. Lemony taste, slightly sweet, some peach and star fruit. No alcohol in the taste and amazingly drinkable considering the abv. Stupendous."

"Wowzers. So, firsties, this style is more or less near the bottom of my list of favourites, and yet this offering has to go and mess with that bias, so much so that I'm now the bad guy in this sad trope. Secondly, mea culpa, a BSPA can apparently, kick major ass, as evidenced by the hefty, layered, fruity, boozy (not that you can actually taste it) goodness harnessed herein. A bit too bad about its pricey intro to these parts, but I'll say it: totally worth it. Oh, and somehow I'm just getting the beer's name: gnomes are Brasserie D'Acchouffe's thing, and that fits so well in a pun with this brewer's name, so...um, that's it. Word."
"O - Excellent belgian. A delight to sip or chug(be careful) A well made beer."
"Overall, a decent golden, but nothing to write home about. A little too artificial on the sweet but otherwise quite a nice balance."

"an outstanding brew from ommegang, as so many of their offerings are. this one was on tap at bull and bush in denver. pours a very thick raw honey color with a small white head and a lot of suspended sediment. the nose indicates that its got a very unique yeast going on. its spicy yet it contains some fruit notes of peach and green apple. theres also a biscuity malt aroma and a candy sugar sweetness that is undeniable. the flavor is a lot like the nose. the sweetness is intense and is the last thing left in the finish. in addition to the spice and light fruit from the yeast, there is also a particular pine pollen essence i am gathering as well. the feel is great, like most ommegang brews. its got spunky carbonation and a pretty thick body for a belgian pale ale. its not filling, but at 9.5% abv its not a beer you are probably going to have more than one of per sitting. exceptional stuff."

"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours a great golden straw color with a good thick head. Great begian yeast, slightly fruity; maybe grape vine like, aromas. Taste is fantastic. Very smooth belgian malts and nice hop flavor, belgian yeast and great fruity complexity. Smooth and very drinkable especially for the very high abv. Such a great beer, and I was so pumped to try it. If you can find it, get it! its such a perfect collaboration."

"Gnomegang glides into the glass golden with a small tint of faded bronze within. a nice sheet of bright white up top, leaving a cap and small splotches. OK retention. Smell is fruity with a bready Belgian yeast with trace amounts of candi. No grassy scents, some hints of alcohol. Pretty bold in scent off the tap with a bit candi like scent than alot of American versions. Taste is up front with Belgian essence and a fruit. Apple, pear, small earthy hop bite in between with some candi sugar in the end that does not cloy. First sips give off some alcohol that warms the gullet. The 9.5% is not all the way hidden. Feel is a strong medium with a nice crisp carb. After half the glass this becomes all to easy to drink. A nice stab at the style and much better than alot of American versions out there. I just wish bottles were not so damn pricey, this would be a nice one to slide into 4 packs or so. Until then, I'll grab it on tap."
"I think this rivals Duvel in terms of BSPA."

"I found this completely horrible. The clove was way overdone and the sweetness provided a weird character. Had I been drinking it by myself, it probably would've ended up down the drain, but I gutted through my ~7 oz."

"Pours a slightly murky orange-yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and some slightly soapy aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink. A solid collaboration beer for sure."

"Very good, interesting, strange, complex beer. Served at a good temperature with nice cream colored, thick, creamy, foamy head that slowly subsided and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a slightly hazy yellow amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, apricot, malt, fruit, caramel. Flavor's like nose, has some dominant sweetness, yet also has some persistant bitterness on the back of the tongue, a little carbonic tang. Body is good; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, fairly long and only a little alcohol warmth. On one hand the beer is almost too sweet, yet on the other it isn't. A little rich to have another though."

"A surprising find at the local bottle shop. A collab between A'chouffe and Ommegang can't be bad...clever name too. It pours an unmiraculous dull gold with a thin pfft of white foam on top. Despite the insipid appearance, the flavor is quite nice. Bushels of tropical fruit fill out the body - mango, banana, bitter melon, kiwi, and papaya. Mild bitterness lets a sweet, bready malt backbone come out. Little in the way of hop bitterness, flavor, or aroma - the yeast does the talking in this ale. A little more carbonation and dryness would go a along way here, but the flavors are really pleasant."

"A shame that this is only locally available in the expensive gift pack, I would love to stock up on it. So much going on at once yet it's all smooth and cohesive whether it all registers or not. Would love to Scooby-doo it more and crack the case eventually, yet for now am content with the memory of the initial experience, this is definitely something to seek out. Wow."

"Slightly slick in the mouth with a quicker than expected finish but a nice evolution of flavors. The quick clean finish adds to the drinkability as it makes you want to take in more. Alcohol was well concealed. Nicely done - a classic Belgian blonde."
""
"O: A very good beer. The alcohol content prevents me from being able to drink very much of this at one time, but I will be purchasing it again if I can get my hands on it."
"3.9/5: Giving me another reason to really like BSPAs"
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber. Nice one finger head and lacing. Nice aroma of sweet malt, yeast, light fruit and Belgian spicing; strong on clove. Taste follows with pleasant sweet malt, light fruit, a hint of honey and caramel, followed by Belgian spices and a slight hop finish. Nice separation of flavors and nice progression. Well made. It would be interesting to cellar some of these."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this Belgian beer from Ommegang - complex, refreshing and easy drinking."

"O: Overall hard to argue this is probably one of the best blondes this side of the pond (with exception of kaley cuoco). ;) Will make anyone a fan of the style. Alcohol is very well hidden, crisp drinking factor and would make an ideal summer sipper."

"750 ml corked and caged bottle, stamp says packaged on 02/24/11. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like green apples, bready malt, hay, pears, and a bit of clove and tropical fruit. It tastes like grass/hay, earth, cloves, peppery spice, pears, bready malt/grain, and some apples. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a solid brew and it's also worth trying. $10.99 a bottle."
"Overall big strong beer, lots of flavor and for sure a sipper. If you like spices, yeast and sour fruits this is a must try. Glad to drink this again, had it at first release a few xmas ago."
"D: Very enjoyable and not boozy given the abv. Definitely wish this was not a limited beer."
"Into a Ommegang specialty glass. Poured a cloudy pale orange. Had a billowing, strong, and dense off-white head. Lemon cake, apple, and herbs to the nose. Slight medicinals arose after a bit. Taste was sour apples, sugar, beer bread and a squeeze of lemon. Palpable alcohol heat up front but quickly mellowed as it warmed. Goes down dry with a medium body. A bit of chalk lines the palate after a glass or two."
""

"Poured a cloudy straw color with a nice flluffy head. Scent was green apple and yeasty bread. Taste followed the scent but was more intense than I expected from this beer. Great carbonation and very cleansing taste. This was my favorite in this three pack which included Gnomegang, Three Philosophers, and Hennepin."
"O: This beer is great. The nose, the palate, the feel – it’s all smooth, rich, and drinkable. The primary yeast, from Brasserie D’Achouffe, is a shining example of Belgian complexity. I could drink this beer any day, any time."

"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a branded tulip glass, 6/27/11 best before 6/14. This pours a nice hazy golden color with a short libed massive white head. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, banana, citrus fruit, lemon, malts spice. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is good, citrus, alcohol, spices, a nice little bit of dryness."

"This Belgian-Style Blonde Ale pours a hazy, pale gold with a tight white head and very little lacing. Tropical fruit is heavy in the nose, with hints of hay, earthiness, and yeasty funk rounding out this big bouquet. Peach and mango flavors liven up the pallet with some hop spice balancing this smooth and fruity brew. Tongue-prickling carbonation meets a medium body in this beer that finishes remarkably dry."

"Overall - Sharing many characteristics with a standard Begian-style blonde, this truly blurs the line between Tripel and Saison. It still has the qualities to that of Chouffe or Duvel, yet at the same time, somehow manages to make a confident leap into new territory. I also appreciate the craftsmanship here; using Chouffe yeast in the primary fermentation and Ommegang yeast in the secondary is a really interesting and creative way to make this a real collaborative ale. Definitely pick this up if you see it!"

"cloudy white honey colored body, two fingers of off white rise and fall into a creamy cap. nose is mainly tropical fruit with malts and funky yeast. taste realy brings out the mango and yeast. has a medium body with probably a little too much carbonation. a dry tobacco taste is left on the back of my tongue. the abv is well hidden and this is very drinkable."
""
"This is a great one! And the price is right..."
"Notes from on tap at the Dutch. Hazy golden hue capped by an abundant white head in my tulip glass. Nose is full of tropical fruit, and slight earthiness. Taste follows suit with the addition of spice from the yeast and light malt. Medium bodied, this is an enjoyable beer."
"O- A very drinkable and fruity take on a BSPA, I really enjoyed the tropical notes."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a globe glass. Beautiful beer when poured! It is a golden orange color, a bit cloudy with active carbonation and an off-white fluffy head. The smell was not as impressive as the appearance. It may still have been a bit chilled to fully let out the aromas. Evident smells are of apple and citrus and sweet alcohols. Taste is more complex than the smell. I get citrus and tropical fruits at first then some spice and a warming dry finish. A bit of a slick mouthfeel. Overall a really nice collaboration between two excellent breweries."
"drinkability/overall- this beer was really refreshing and well balanced certainly easy smooth drinking, this one struck me as one that would go well with alot foods or even just on its own, its not the most complex but makes up for it largely in sheer balance and smoothness"
"Overall a good beer. Still this won't make me give up Hennepin anytime soon."
"Clear, pale golden to orange in color with silky, off-white foam and good head retention and a nice stream of active carbonation. Aroma is malty and wheaty with notes of honey, coriander, orange. Fruity, citrus hops. The taste is a bit muted but it has sweet, bready malts with a good spicy/fruity kick from the yeast. Fruity hops come in but are subtle, adding a nicely bitter aftertaste."

"Overall:Originally picked this up expecting worse and ended up being outstanding. I was expecting a seasonal type of brew but ends up being a real fine ale that leaves you wanting more. Body is pretty well carbonated but not to the point where the head overwhelms the body. Hope you all enjoy and cheers to all."

"The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Tongue prickling with modest carbonation."
"Overall, this is a great beer. It is a nice collab from two good breweries. This is a very cool example of an interesting style and it holds it own very well."
"Overall probably a 4.45 but alas we don't have that."

"This beer does not seem to be on point for the style. It also has a collaboration pedigree that sets expectations fairly high. These factors might seem like a setup for disappointment but I couldn't help but really enjoy this beer. If this was available regularly I would definitely pick it up to take to dinner parties with my more wine inclined friends."
""
"Sniff, sniff. Spicy, sweet, cloves, honey, lemon, brown sugar, soapy. Mmm. Good job. The taste comes together as I would expect. I hear those spicy hops loud and clear, keeps it all reasonable and away from the edges of cloying that some of these breed are capable. Full blonde-like body is only part of the story as the stronger Belgian aspects work through: sweet, funk, tang, honey, clove, nutmeg, brown sugar, citrus zest, even a tad bit of banana flavor. Booze is present and accounted for. Warmth is key. Strongest characteristic is easily the spicy warmth. Not bad. Good job, boys and girls at Ommegang and L'chouffe."

"O- Good beer, but it had to be coming from these two breweries."

"Overall I wasn't greatly impressed with this beer. I feel the sweetness is just too much and I was done after one glass."

"O - Great beer. I wish I had bought more than one, even though this is not a favorite style for me. This was one of the hidden-behind-the cooler-you-had-to-ask-for-it beers for some reason, and i'm very happy with this purchase."
""
"Notes - Not worth the $12.99 but still an interesting beer."
""
""
"O: A very nice combination from two of my favorite brewers."
""
"Overall: Super clean and drinkable. Light and funky. This one wows me more with its smoothness than its overall taste. Just complex enough to make me want more, but not one of my favorites from a very solid brewery."
""
""
"O - When I saw and smelled the beer, I was slightly disappointed as I though this was a sure winner. Once I tasted it, my disappointment disappeared, it is a winner indeed. I have a feeling a bit of aging would up the carbonation slightly and make this even better."

"I'd like to age a bottle but I like the hoppy aspect and wouldn't want it to fade, and considering the price of the gift pack I had too buy to try this one I doubt I'll find out. Still worth a try I just wish i could buy it in singles"
""
""
"O - A quality brew. Very complex nose and taste, although the ABV sings through a bit too much. Good to try if you like the two brewers."
""
""
"O: If this were blind, I would easily pin it as a Belgian pale ale- it does fit the style well and is tasty/well made overall, but I've got to dock it 1/2 point because of how omnipresent the alcohol characteristics are."

"Poured 750ml bottle slowly into Duvel tulip. Typical cloudy orange for a Belgian blonde pour with a half inch of fluffy head that reduces down to white lace around the inside of the glass. Smells of yeast, orange peel and raisin and a fair amount of sweetness. Taste is very good on the tongue flavors of the aforementioned with a nice little bite from the alcohol. Had this one and was saving it for my Thanksgiving Day beer with the meal and it did not disappoint, very solid and very drinkable though the 9.5% abv eventually caught up to me in the end. However, the abv was in no way overwhelming to the beer in taste or feel, just a good creeper that's great for a cold night to keep you warm and toasty on the inside. My 1st from Ommegang, I have a Rare Vos chilling as well that I plan to crack soon. The LaChouffe gnome caught my eye and I had to try...now I'm craving La Chouffe."
"If they could have hidden the alcohol better I would have rated this much higher, but as is, I can only give it a C+ grade."

"Purchased this as part of the Holiday gift pack. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a dull golden-orange with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is one inch, fluffy and bright white and embedded with pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy slick and a tight white band around the shoulders. Thin swaths of lacing coat the walls of the glass. Nose expresses coriander, clove and a trace of candi sugar - overall impression is somewhat herbal. Taste consistent with nose; however a pleasant, light malt backbone reveals itself. There's also a suggestion of raisins and a hint of something else - perhaps mint, perhaps a residual tropical fruit quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, almost prickly carbonation, some acidity and a faintly oily texture. There's also a residual burn at the back of the throat that lingers between quaffs culminating in a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid BSPA but there are better examples of the style out there. Well worth a try if the opportunity presents."

"T: Pretty good stuff here. Sonefruit, pear, honey, some spice and Belgian yeast with a touch of heat from the alcohol. Very drinkable."

"A light golden-grey colored brew with a decent thin white head and fair lacing. The aroma delivers a thick but tasteful grainy alcohol and pleasant clove with subtle orange citrus hop. The flavor offers a commanding wheat grain goodness with clove-citrus brightness. Full of spicy cinnamon allspice and a bit of light alcohol. This is medium bodied plus with a nearly cloying feel. Carbonation is very mellow and overall this is a classically smooth Belgian beauty. Though not as hoppy as I was hoping, still a highly recommended brew."

"Complements Bob Marley and the Wailers style music. If you tend a more artsy, side then try Trio X (Joe McPhee, Dominic Duval & Jay Rosen) Try Trio X Sugar Hill."
"This bottle was included as part of a gift pack, I'd tried this one shortly after release and probably wouldn't have bought again. Better the second time around. Malty aroma nice yellow color not a great head and it faded quickly. Alcohol well hidden , not overly complex in taste but a good beer all the same didn't get a lot of the fruity overtones and just a hint of bubblegum in the back . Overall it's worth a shot the gift pack dropped the price enough that I'd probably try this again"
"Big bold blonde, perhaps not hugely complex it has its way with the palate regardless. Dare is say ""dangerously drinkable"" ... it is. Good times rolling with this bottle."
"4.0 D: Overall, a solid beer on all fronts. Exceptionally drinkable for what it is and the booze never even shows up, let alone get in the way. Good flavor profile. Definitely worth the purchase. Any of the above 4 categories could have been a notch higher."
"The beer had a medium body. The beer had good and active carbonation was creamy with dry aftertaste. Overall, this is an exceptional beer and very easy to drink even given the ABV. I would recommend to anyone."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation that at times is a bit prickly on the tongue. The abv is well hidden/integrated in this brew which increases the drink ability. Overall not a bad offering, a pleasant dry finish keeps this one approachable. Worth a try but not something I would buy on a regular basis."
"The bitter taste is a bit harsh early on, but it mellows nicely as the beer warms.Definately a siipper given the 9.5% ABV, but quite enjoyable."
"Best quasi-portmanteau name for a beer ever. It pours a lightly hazy tawny-straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises loads of banana, wheat, very light cobweb, powdered sugar, and a few sprinkles of nutmeg. It's sweet, generally pleasant, and loaded with banana. The taste holds notes of banana peel, sharp orange rind, light lemon peel, sweet flowers, and light acetone. Man, this stuff really bites the tongue with bitterness! The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a decent brew, but the bitterness comes across as far too astringent for me, and to the partial detriment of the Belgian character, no less. A bit of a miss for me, even though everything else about it works nicely..."
"O: Very drinkable, especially for the ABV. It was highly recommended to me by a friend, and I'm glad I bought one."
"Nicely balanced and easy-drinking considering its size. Not exactly groundbreaking, but some very nice flavors for sure."
"Nice beer with some interest qualities, but does completely wow me. Much like a fruitier Duvel to me. Ultimately, a good offering, but not something I'd necessarily seek out again."
"Dr: Hides its ABV extremely well. Very pleasant and easy to drink, but at the same time you wouldn't want to drink more than one bottle. It's good to try once, but I imagine the price doesn't justify repeated purchasing. I think the collaboration may actually have hurt the quality of the beer in this case; I have full confidence in both breweries independently."
"Overall this is a really great Belgian pale ale and another great Ommegang offering."
"This was a good tasting, generally pleasurable sipper, which gets it good marks. I didn't think it was particularly unique for the style, which was a bit odd given the collaboration and nature of the two brewers, so loses a few points in that respect. Still, tasty, and a solid beer."
"O: It took me a little while to get into this beer, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. If anything, it provides evidence of just how enchanting these collaborative brews can be."
"A flavorful but not well crafted beer; at least the elements didn't mesh as I would like. Disappointing given the heritage of the two breweries involved; maybe a committee decision. In any case, it is fruity and a little earthy with a tad too much spicing. The high alcohol content also was too evident."
"Juicey and syrupy palate of sweet Summer fruit. Oranges, apricots, nectarines, and apples. Lightly oasted mlat and maybe a little earthy hop profile and thats it. Oh yeah, and some warm alcohol on the finish, especially as the beer warms. Very nice sipper, great carbonation on the palate."
"$17 bomber."
"O-A splendid ale worthy of your attention and is probably food friendly given the low carbonation and silky mouthfeel."
"Lovely deep cloudy gold. White head that leaves spots here and there. A fair amount of carbonation evident as I move the glass around. Smell has a lot of pale malt with a mild banana and light fruits. Belgian yeast flows well and brings out a healthy breadiness maybe a trace of funk. Taste is so close to perfect I may have to come back and p the score. It follows the nose but adds a peppery bite. A touch of sweet alcohol that melds into grains and cinnamon. Mildly spicy hop finish that features a bit of alcohol bit and citrus skin. Crispy dryness gives you a reason to go back to the glass way too soon. Feel is superb with creamy carbonation that laves a quenching sensation and and velvety swallow. A great beer that I will be stocking up on frequently."
"Overall: Tasty, reasonably-complex, and no major flaws, but I just can't get myself to love this. For the approx. $14 it cost me, I probably wouldn't pick up another one."
"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Hazy straw color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Vague light fruit nose, flavor is sweet & tart fruit. Higher ABV is hidden. There are other blondes like Leffe that are better. Not worth $15.95 for a 750ml bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"Don't drink and review."
"Good, complex brew. Could see it matching well with an Indian curry or chilli prawns."
"Great beer, although I have a soft spot for LaChouffe anyways. Ramp up the carbonation and maybe a bit more rustic character would really put this one over the top. A bit more refined than I remember my first LaChouffe being, but a great offering from Ommegang nonetheless."
"This is a example of a Belgian strong ale."
"Overall: A good beer and a nice representation of some of the better flavors that Belgium has to offer. Definitely worth a taste."
"Very nice beer this one—it hides the alcohol well, and comes across a lot lighter and easier drinking than it is. Interestingly, I put this and the Rare Vos side-by-side and they're miles apart. Obviously this is stronger, but it shows how much the strengths assists the style. This was fuller, rounder, more integrated and better balanced."
"O- overall this is a very good beer, a delicious flavor and smooth mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable without any of the heaviness that usually accompany a beer of this abv. The only letdown here is the subpar appearance and aroma, things which ommegang gets right too often for this misstep to occur."
"Ontap into a snifter. Bright gold in color, fizzy, bone white head forms and leaves alittle lace. In the aroma, estery Belgian yeast and some floral hops. In the flavor, nice dry yeast, moderate hop presence with notes of earth, pine and faint citrus. Alcohol is also rather pronounced in the flavor profile, but does not detract from the experience. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with a dry finish. Overall, this is a good belgian pale, would have liked more hops to cut the alcohol flavors a bit. This one was similar to the Ommegang BPA only bigger."
"O- For something that poured so nice...and looked so great....a little disappointing."
"O: a great and interesting beer I would love to get my hands on again."
"Another thanks to my boss who brought this one back from Belgium comes to cooperstown"
"O: A very nice collaboration beer between two great breweries. Drinks very smooth with a little bit of an alcohol kick. Not much wrong with this beer at all."
"Drinkability – At 9.5% alcohol, you expect a touch of alcohol in the finish. The stomach warming finish is the only indicator. Expertly crafted, deceivingly drinkable, and full of complexities."
"The idea of the collaboration is interesting, and the beer itself is good, but nothing particularly unique as I had hoped. Conforms well to the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style. Bright malt with lively carbonation. Some yeasty funk lurking in the background, with hints of slightly over-ripe apple. Finish is firm with some pepper bite at the end. Overall it struck me as a bit fruitier take on Duvel."
"Good stuff, very easy to drink."
"I enjoy this beer although I think it's more of a late night and/or winter beer than a hot weather beer (it's 100 degrees today!)."
"Despite pretty strong alcohol presence, this thing drinks so easily...dangerously easy. In the middle of a country-wide heat wave, this totally hits the spot. But I'll be honest, this would hit the spot any day of the year, winter, summer, spring, fall, whatever. If you don't like this, you don't like Belgian beer."
"This is good beer and a complex brew, but in the end, I much prefer their independent contributions. Keep trying though, guys, and I’ll keep drinking them."
"Overall: Very good beer, refreshing, complex, flavorful, I’m not contemplating buying more the only thing that would prevent me from that would be price."
"Gnomegang is a solid (half) American-brewed Belgian."
"Aroma has lots of fruity, yeasty notes, slightly sweet. It poured a hazy golden/yellow, decent head with medium retention. I taste tropical fruit, lots of Belgian yeast character going on, very refreshing. Medium-full body with high carbonation. Very tasty treat from Brewery Ommegang."
"Ommegang signals quality, as does la Chouffe. The body and quality are apparent, but a bit light in the flavor department."
"D - First off, kudos for a brilliant name... It should be no surprise that a quality beer like this is the result of a collaboration between two excellent breweries..."
"Good beer."
"O: Not perfect by any means, but I've enjoyed this more than any BSDA I can remember. Yes, there are flaws, yes it's hot, yes the mouth feel isn't perfect, but overall, I really enjoy it."
"lemon was the first thing that greeted me, very bright flavors that really perked you up and let you prepare for what was coming in behind them. In their wake were the nice flavors of light yeast coated with pears and a touch of fig, with a nice light spice sprinkled in throughout. These melded seamlessly with the light grainy back and then rounded the corner to bring home a nice dry long lasting finish that had just the right hint of bitterness to really make it interesting"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a super large off-white foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of sweet Belgian malt with light bready yeast notes and light fruity ester. Taste is also a mix between some semi0sweet Belgian malt with a bready yeast with light peppery notes and some light refreshing ester also noticeable. Body is quite full with great carbonation and very light alcohol noticeable. Another winner from breweries that don’t get it wrong very often."
"overall a very nice effort by both of these breweries. i would love to see this make a yearly appearance."
"O: Enjoyable all around but a bit too thick and syrupy sweet for me to fall head over heels for it."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a really tasty and enjoyable brew overall, and one that I'd buy again. But this style has some phenomenal varieties, and this one is right about average between the top and bottom... which is still a good feat, given that it's a collaboration."
"An absolute home run for both Achouffe and Ommegang. A quicker turn away from early maltiness and toward fruity dryness could make the beer more drinkable. Also, a more champagne-like carbonation could better reinforce the vinous dryness that could improve. An absolute gem of a beer."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of Belgian yeast with some orange citrus and lemon notes mixed in. The flavor is more of the same. I get some orange and lemon notes as well as some flowers, possibly from the hops. The Belgian yeast and a little bit of alcohol are also present in the flavor, as well as some spice. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Poured into a large tulip glass a peach infused golden with a large fluffy white head that took its time coming down leaving brokin globs of lace behind.The aromas were quite citrusy with the phenols lending some spice but they didnt overpower.Light spiced phenols start the ou in the flavor profile some grainy notes,the citrusy hops really take over about halfway and linger in a nice finish.I wouldnt think the alcohol content was so high because it goes down easy without any alcohol sting,its a great food friendly beer."
"Overall I’m glad I had the chance to try this beer, very nicely done all around."
"O: Very nice Belgian Blonde. The yeast flavors are fantastic! Smooth and easy drinking. Nice lingering bouquet of spices in the finish."
"Overall: It's alright, kinda like an iced sugar cookie topped with a dollop of banana pudding and garnished with a bit of Meyer lemon peel and cracked cloves. Still, the sweetness and slight booziness made the eleven ounces more than enough for me."
"D - all I can say is a very nice collaboration between ommegang and chouffe. Great for a warm summer eve."
"The taste is carbonation and a mix of yeast upfront.. The yeast is spicy and leaves a slight candy flavor. All other flavors are subdued as the beer seems unbalanced."
"This collaboration brew hits the mark. It pours dark yellow to amber with a big white head. The aroma is a mixture of earthy herb and yeast along with some orange citrus and a little cherry. Fruit and sweet malt roil across the tongue as it mixes with pepper and spice to produce an authentic Belgian experience. Hints of toffee and apricot and alcohol. The booze is well hid, but there is a hint of it underneath. I really enjoyed this brew, Belgian through and through."
"O: this is a great beer, the flavors are pretty complex and blend nicely, the alcohol is very well hidden, I hope this isn't a one-time collaboration"
"Pours a hazy dark golden brown with a creamy white head that leaves very little lacing. The nose carries classic belgian spices with prominent clove and white pepper along others, with sweet citrus peel. The taste has citrus, rich wheaty malt, citrus and after it warms up weizen beer taste with banana and clove. The taste is classic belgian though a bit astrigent with the abv showing. A nice beer. But i prefer my hangovers from la fin du monde."
"A fine Belgian Strong Pale, it is just so bitter that it is hard to sip this one for me."
"Cheers!"
"O- This beer is delicious with a well-blended complexity and a supporting hops flavor that balances everything. The Noble hops and soft yeast funk blend well and the crisp texture make this beer disappear much to quickly."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a fair amount of haze. Good fluffy white head and a pretty good amount of lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose carries strong amounts of bread along with a moderate amount of fruity esters and a bit of spice. The flavor is chewy and bready; a bit too thick, though still quite enjoyable. Lots of bread plus some mild fruit and a bit of clove and spice. Medium body with average carbonation. A very solid brew that I'd be happy to have again."
"O: Very interesting character. Complex and balanced. A little boozy, but definitely ABV."
"Notes: Nice surprise and collaboration! I was hesitant around the notion of the style, and the potential for this one despite the reputation of both brewers, but sure enough they have crafted quite the quality strong golden ale."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O-A solid beer, used it to celebrate the Bruins winning. Ommegang continues to make great beers."
"Overall, an expertly crafted collaboration deep rooted in it’s Belgian Strong spirit."
"O - I don't care much for this beer, it's okay, but nothing I'd ever drink again."
"O: Other than the little hint of booze, this was pretty solid. A nice Belgian beer."
"O: Two very good breweries coming together to make one very good beer. Really like both Ommegang and La Chouffe and this surely did not disappoint."
"O - This is a really good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. A very good collaborative effort."
"A nice collaboration between two great breweries. Aspects of both are seen here. Carbonation is more Ommegang - flavors are a mix of both. One to get while it lasts!"
"Taste begins deeply sweet, cloves in the middle, with a fruitiness peeking in, and closes quietly with lingering of the same flavors. Alcohol warmth comes on as well. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is very easy, esp for the abv. Very nice brew."
"A good beer from two outstanding breweries but the alcohol and price could act as a deterent for some."
"Pours cloudy light copper with an inch of white foam. Residual lacing grips the sides of the glass. Belgian yeast smell. Taste is smooth, light sugar blended with an even hop. Very mild and even. Some honey taste, and dark fruit. Very good."
"O - Remarkable representation of a Belgian Pale Ale as is typical of Ommegang! Great brew that is worth trying if you are in to those yeasty and spicy Belgians."
"a blend of wonderful caramel, brisk feel and subtle husky adjunct. Corn hints to a bubble golden pour. Nose of brie and hay. Palate a tad on the sweet side. I wouldn't have this in a bottle due to fear of a dominating protein husk candy that blends well but your make for a cardboard feel if it sat around too long. Great little brew... Early autumn feel. Mild floral linger."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. It is a little yeasty for my taste, but I feel that this will mellow with age. The hops are such that they would probably be conducive to to the aging as well. I would venture to guess that this beer would be ready in about 18 months or so of cold aging. At that point, hopefully the yeast will settle and the hops and alcohol would co-exist a bit better to make this beer more drinkable. As it is, it tastes young, so it really isn't all that enjoyable."
"Didn't know what to expect here. Nice pour, honey gold color rests under a two finger white rocky head. Belgian lacing, check. Head retention, less of a check. Aroma, well its weak. A little spicy, a little banana, and a suggestion of belgian candi sugar. The taste is clean, crisp. There are flavors of clove, banana, and spicy belgian yeast. A very clean pils malt, not much in the way of hops. Very esters are present, some green apple too. To think this is almost 10%, can't be but it is. A really well crafted, but simple beer. This makes it all the more impressive. These simple ales are tough to pull off well, and this one is a winner."
"I'm so tired of listing the same handful of descriptors for each beer. (This tastes spicy, sweet, and a little bit hoppy) If you've had a strong BPA, you know the basic formula. Only, wow, it don't usually come together like this. The sweetness starts things off, then it gets so nice and spicy in the middle that burns--but it burns like peppers, not like alcohol--and then that fades slowly away and leaves a taste of tangy honey upon your tongue, and the whole time the beer's as thick as silk."
"Appears a pale golden slightly clouded Belgian ale here, this is pretty much the best American brewed Belgian ale around owned by Belgians tagged teaming with the La Chouffe folks to creat Gnomegang. Started by beer enthusiasts I basically love Ommegang. Head is fluffy white with fine, you guessed it Belgian style lacing. Aroma is spicy citric with hints of tropical fruit a very pleasant aromatic experience as a whole. Hints of pineapple and apricot very enticing with each sniff or use it as a reduction in your next sauce creation at home in the culinary kitchen. Effervescent body sent by the beer gods above, in truth well executed Belgian style ale I can't wait for the next Steel City Big Pour the only event that Ommegang attends in the Burgh currently."
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"O - This is a very enjoyable beer from two breweries that I like there's better beers out there from both of them but they came together to make a good tasting beer that's worth trying if you see it around"
"Great beer!"
"D - Very drinkable. The beer feels nice and complex and balanced from start to end. The 9.5% abv here is also pretty much hidden. The mix of fruits, spices, and yeast is really nice here."
"Price = $9.99 at the Whole Foods (NYC)"
"Taste throws off lots of yeast, bready and fruity. Alcohol is big and dry with a light hop bitterness on the finish. Hop flavor shows up a bit, herbal and leafy. Mouthfeel is soft and almost manages to be creamy - finely bubbled. Even though both breweries yeasts were used, I think the 'Chouffe is more distinctive and noticeable. Pretty smooth and drinks easier than a 9.5 BSPA should. Not a bad collab here, worthy of a test drive."
"Full medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and dry on the tongue. This reminds me of La Chouffe a bit, it drinks pretty well but I wasn't too into it."
"Narrative: PING! PING! PING! Garnab loved his craft and it showed. He surveyed the blade of the battleaxe with pride and rolled its haft in his calloused hands. The blade was competent and durable, yet light and precise. FSHHH! The iron sizzled upon being cast into the cool water. ""GARNAB GET IN HERE!"" his supervisor called from down the hall of the Morgrem guild. Garnab slid into the chair daintily, an impressive feat for a gnome of his heft and weight. ""Garnab, we have all been noticing you around here, your fine work, your precise castings, and impeccable attention to detail."" Garnab grunted lightly and carressed the chain of precious silver that he painstakingly created years earlier. ""That is why you have been promoted to assistant vice-Gnome of the Belbgaar foundry."" He nodded silently and exited, his cool stride demonstrating his poise and power within, Garnab was going places."
"Big thanks to Sean via Wakefield... black body with some dark brown fringes, no carbonation... strong syrupy nose of molasses and raisins, the oak is really smooth adds a nice spicey note to the beer, some alcohol, but in your face and strong... the taste is too sryupy, raisins, lots of char, a bit of vanilla on the finish... worth trying, better than its parts"
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color, with not to much of a head. The aroma was full of spices, and almost a wheat smell. The taste had a very strong spice taste, in a strong pear taste. The taste was strong and bold, and the alchool while not noticable did make a hit. Overall it was a good beer, but I was just expecting more."
"Overall: Lovely and rich brew from Ommegang and Chouffe. Highly recommended for a special occasion."
"D: A good Belgian. This is definitely the brew you're looking for if you like this style."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. Would I have this beer again... Sure! Very tasty and an appealing."
"Overall this beer is everything it promises in the long run. A strong Belgian Pale that produces the lasting flavor and feel that they have for years and years... cheers!"
"O: Great beer. I probably won't seek it again, but I rather enjoyed trying it."
"Not a bad beer, but the yeast flavors are very strong. I'd like to see it toned back so that the juiciness of the fruity hops can shine."
"Pours a lightly hazed and bubbly golden yellow, pillow of soft white head. Scent is pale, light watery and sweet fruits, belgian yeasts and faint hints of bread and spice. Taste slightly more aggressive then scent, watery and sweet fruits are the start (apple, citrus and tropical all present), malt is lightly sweet and bready, standard belgian yeast notes in moderation, some spice. Medium bodied, smooth. A nice, easy drinking beer that hides its ABVs very well."
"D - quite drinkable and look forward to another if I can find it."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable. Overall a tremendous collaboration brew. Highly recommended. Excellent, especially for style."
"An incredibly delicious brew and one I'd defiintely have again."
"O: Decent beer, though I have to say I prefer the individual parts as opposed to the sum in this case. Nice to try but not as good as I'd hoped it would be.If not for the accumulation, this would be an A- or A beer IMO. Possibly tastes better on draft or soon after bottling."
"A collaboration ale that actually lives up to the billing!"
"O: A really surprising beer as collaborations tend to be either spectacular successes or letdowns. This one works really well with a very interesting, complex brew that puts a heavy-hitting twist on the style."
"O: A good beer overall and among the better BSPAs out there. The main drawback of this beer (other than the price) is the obvious alcohol presence. While it's not super hot, I feel like the best versions of the style hide it better."
"Overall, this is a win for everybody involved. A great example of style and another successful collaboration. Let’s hope we see more of these guys in the future."
"Pours a clear, carbonated, yellow with a half finger of white foam that clings to the sides of the glass. It has a very typical Belgian nose, lots of clove, phenol, and maybe a hint of banana at the end. The taste matches the nose fairly closely with clove, and a nice sweetness at the end. A nice, light mouthfeel, very refreshing. Overall, a nice, tasty, Belgian."
"D: definitely not an everyday beer, but an excellent rare collab to stumble upon."
"O: Really enjoyed this beer. Can't see myself getting it again due to the fact it was a once time release. Great collaboration however."
"Very drinkable and light for 9.5% ABV, I was able to patiently finish off the bomber without too much struggle or too much of a buzz."
"Overall: Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. I didn't pick this up at first but now, I'm glad that I did."
" I do not recall being this positive on an Ommegang beer since I first had Three Philosphers. That is really saying something because 3 Phils is one of my sentimental favs!"
"The CpJ"
"O: Fantastic. This beer is dangerously drinkable for the ABV thanks to the perfectly executed carbonation. Well done."
"Medium mouthfeel with a bit of the alcohol heat being noticeable. Excellent offering that should age very well."
"O: doesn't taste a hint near 9.5%, but is a new favorite yet it is a limited edition."
"Aroma is fairly strong and rather fruity, equal parts apple/pear and lemon, not too sweet, with a malty underpinning. It pours a pretty clear golden yellow with a thick and fluffy, it not persistent, white head. Refreshing flavor is fruity and malty, having tones of apple and butterscotch, a little malt and a bit of hops, a touch of sweetness, and a fairly strong alcohol bite. Ragged, fizzy texture has a good edge and leaves a persistent tingle with some fruitiness and maltiness as well as a nip of alcohol."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a killer yeast nose that compliments a solid pale malt base. It's fruity with a touch of funk along with a bit of malty sweetness. The taste is great as well. It has a silky smooth pale malt flavor that's light and easy drinking with little alcohol warmth. The yeast provides a ton of character and adds a good deal of depth to the flavor. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. I'm a huge fan of collaborations and this one is no exception."
"On tap at a grill in Clarendon, VA poured into a snifter glass. Pours a tan/blonde color with a heavy haze and some light brown sediment floating around near the bottom of the glass. On top there is an off white cap of foam that slowly settles and makes some nice slick lacing on the glass. There is a big classic Belgian yeast character coming to the nose. With it comes fruit, funk and wet hay mixed with some sweet bready malt and solid notes of floral/spicy hops. It starts with a nice base of sweet bready malt and yeast with a light touch of funk and wet hay. Inside this are some nice fruity notes as well and I get white wine grapes, light unripe peach and mild orange blossom. This is all backed up by a firm floral and spicy hop bitterness that adds a pleasant balance and dryness to the finish. It’s well balanced on the palate and fun to drink. Overall it is an outstanding Belgian which to me seems to fits somewhere between a Blond and a Triple. Also of note here is the very well hidden 9.5% abv. Went extremely well with the grilled burger and asparagus I ordered."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a pretty nice beer. It had some nice flavors to it and felt pretty balanced overall. Enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"D: This was a very nice BSPA, with clean and balanced scent and taste. The body was fantastic, and the alcohol was very well hidden, so it was quite easy to drink. One of the better examples of this style. Definitely recommended."
"All in all I was happy with this beer, the only thing keeping it from being a really awesome beer is the alcoholic heat. Could be a touch rounder with the alcohol. But I'd still rock this beer again for sure."
"O: Wow. Fantastic beer. One of the most complex, fulfilling brews I've ever had. Even at $15 per 750, I will be seeking this beer out for aging pronto."
"o: a nice change of pace from traditional Ommegang fair. Will have to try more Le Chouffe to know what I taste in the yeast here. Nice spices in the taste despite a weaker scent. Don't need many of these, though what they did here is still very enjoyable."
"A very pleasant beer to drink. Never noticed the alcohol."
" Still this is overall a great high quality beer that deserves a try."
"M: Medium-bodied, small carbonation, nice biscuity/bready mouthfeel. Overall a very nice Belgium ale with characteristics of both breweries involved in this collaboration."
"The last few beers I have had from Ommegang have not met my expectations. I fear that have they have increased output they have decreased in quality."
"Well carbonated and easy drinking, not sure where the 9.5% ABV is, I can't taste it. Recommended as a very good collaboration beer, would have been nice to taste more of the Chouffe though."
"Overall: Excited to try this one and wasn't let down. Great aroma, taste and drinkability. The only negative was the lack of head. Dont really know what happened there, others seemed to get better results and I don't usually have issues pouring a nice head on the beer."
"jd"
"Despite the misleading gnomenclature, Gnomegang is a beer that stands quite tall. I had high hopes that Brasserie d 'Achouffe and Brewery Ommegang would come up with a winner. They did indeed. There’s really not much to criticize here. This is a damn good Belgian Strong Pale that can run with the best of them. The hops are an interesting twist and really add a lot to the mix. Great stuff. Find a bottle if you haven’t already."
"Interesting beer, but I will probably not buy it again, instead sticking with my favorites of each brewery: Hennepin from Ommegang, Houblon IPA Triple from d'Achouffe."
"The beer is good, not amazing. It's missing something, I can't quite put my finger on it; it was a little thin, perhaps. Overall, decent beer at $6 in the bar, not worth it at $10."
"D - Lots of yeast character, as expected with anything Chouffe-related. I like the spicy complexity of the yeast as it works very well with the rich, bready malt character. There is some hop character, but not quite as much as it seems like there should be, especially considering how thick the malt character is. The finish is a bit of the sweet side for my taste however and this holds the beer back a bit. A very nice example of the style, though as far a Belgian-American collaborations go it is still second to the Green Flash/St. Feuillien strong golden ale."
"I love this. Earthy, rustic, spicy, fruity. All things I love in Belgian pale ale. Sip and savor, this is a great one. Something I highly recommend."
"Poured out of the bottle as a lightly hazy, golden yellow color. No head retention with basically no lacing. Banana and clove aroma on the nose. Same flavors in the taste plus some citrus too. The mouthfeel is dry and little bitey. Overall I really liked this beers taste and smell. I found it to be rather enjoyable and would like to try it again some day."
"O - With the high caliber of the two breweries involved, I expected more from this collaboration, but this beer really needs polishing. Also, I suggest drinking this pretty cool, as it gets much too boozy as it warms."
"One of the best BPA I've tried, even better than Ommegang's other fine offering."
"Thanks Ommegang and D'Achouffe for a fantastic Belgium Blonde."
"overall - very tasty but nothing to make it stand out over the other b.pales and not worth the $14 cost"
"O - Hands down best blonde ale I have had, not my favorite style, but this one is really great."
"I was not as impressed as I had hoped. But a good beer."
"D: As I work through this magnum, the 9.5% ABV becomes more and more evident. This beer has a ""warming"" affect. As far as drinkability/repeatability, my bias enters into this, as this isn't my favorite style of beer. Also, I have to keep in mind that I'm questioning repeatability after 25.4 ounces, not 12. With that in mind, I'd score this as a 3.5"
"Enjoyed this beer, quite phenolic and hoppy, would've liked it in smaller quantities."
"Overall: I just wish it didnt finish with that bitter orange taste. Otherwise, it would be top notch. A very fruity, fairly hoppy, complex BSPA."
"Overall really a Nice interpretation That hits all the major flavor profiles but a touch heavy on the the alcohol flavor."
"O-Overall this beer is very good and I would consider getting it again. I enjoyed it with the seafood and cigars that I had with it."
"O- Overall this was a above average beer. It seems like this was a one off release that should be made into rotation. The ABV was there in the beer the entire time although it never became overwhelming. A nice drinker that I was glad to have a couple glasses of."
"overall, i definatly enjoyed this beer but it fell just a little short of my expectations from 2 highly regarded breweries. i most likely will not buy this again, mainly because of the price."
"On tap at the Dive Bar in Worcester for $7. Served in an Ommegang tulip glass. Bright yellow body, with a bit of orangey haze to it. Small white head, and spritzy carbonation. Smell was floral and citrus-like, and reminded me a lot of a saison. Taste was very refreshing. Lots of notes of coriander, lemon and Belgian sugar. Mouthfeel was tart and crisp. A great beer for the style, with an abv that is well hidden. A bit pricey, but worth a try. Ommegang does not make many duds, and this one continues their winning ways."
"Notes: Overall it is an outstanding Belgian which to me seems to fits somewhere between a Blond and a Triple. Also of note here is the very well hidden 9.5% abv."
"When I pulled the cork, I noticed that the beer was not as aggressively carbonated as Duvel, the benchmark of the style. The body was also noticed to be more cloudy, and with a slightly darker shade of yellow, than the pale golden color that other BSPA's typically display. The smell was grassy, and floral, typical of the style. The taste was very lemony, with floral and spicy hop notes. The middle was dry, and the tartness lasted into the aftertaste. As the beer warmed up, some banana and tropical fruit flavors started to show up. This was not as funky as Hennepin, but was closer to that flavor profile than BSPA's like Duvel. Mouthfeel was a touch lighter than medium, and carbonation was soft and not overly aggressive. The alcohol was well hidden, and the warming finish surprising. A hybrid that tastes more like a cohesive whole."
"O - A good collaboration and another winner from Ommegang. These guys are slowly becoming a favorite."
"drinkability/overall: strong"
"Drink- All day long I could drink this one. Its a tad expensive for the beer is worth it. It was nice and soft with a yeasty fizzy note."
"Appears a hazy lite golden pale orange. Little bit of a white thin head. Aroma is ok, a little spice and yeast. flavors of ripe bananas, bubblegum, spices, and clean citrus. Just another great beer from Ommegang. A good crisp mouthfeel, with the great Belgian yeast leading the way in every sip. Be carefull of this one, its an easy drinker and the high ABV will catch up with you as the booze is hardly noticeable it the sips."
"It's also a strong, but not too heavy or thick, spicy pale Belgian with mild berry fruit notes over dry biscuit malts and a balancing touch of hops."
"For this price there are plenty of other beers I'd rather try. However, it's worth the sacrifice of hard earned dough to try a collaboration between two serious breweries. To my unfortunate displeasure his beer tries to overpower with a more than fortified 9.5%abv. I would have liked a beer for less cash and more flavor."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and slick, with carbonation that's so low it's almost watery, a medium body and a nice little bite after it slides over the tongue. Really nice flavorful beer that was extremely easy to drink."
"I want to say the beer is very Hennepin, and the hype was greater than the beer itself, not bad however."
"A nice beer overall, but not one I would need to have again. There just isn't much in the way of wowing me. Worth a try, but don't have too high of expectations."
"Drinkability: At the moment, so-so. It's very heavy, almost cloyingly sweet, and absolutely dominated by yeast flavors. I think a year in the cellar to dry and blend the flavors would do this one wonders."
"I just thought they could have done more to cover up the everlooming ABV."
"Fuller bodied than expected with a slightly chewy mouthfeel that still somehow manages to be light and extremely quaffable. Crisp, soft carbonation up front with hints of zesty spice, estery light fruit, bread/yeast, pale malt, alcohol and pale malt. Hints of zesty spice up front, especially pepper and clove, linger throughout but are countered by hints of banana, apple, pear and citrus. A touch of alcohol heat toward the end of the palate adds some sweetness but this is countered by faint bitterness from the earthy grassy hops. This is a very well balanced, complex and tasty beer. Recommended!"
"This is an overall easy to drink brew that is quite enjoyable and I would definitely get another bottle."
"D: These two breweries nailed it with this one. Great, easy drinking beer. No sign of the booze. Could have drank this all night long"
"D: great belgian pale. duvel is still the tops, but this is a great showing from a stateside brewery that knows their shit."
"D: A good solid example of the style. Not in love with the price. How is something made less than 2 hours from me cost the same as something coming from Belgium? A nice example still. Not quite what I was expecting though."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is refreshing and leaves you wanting more. Overall, I think this is a good representation of the style, and just a good beer all together. Im glad I got the chance to try it. I would pick this one up again."
"The beer appears hazy and golden yellow hued, with 1/4"" of head and decent lacing left on the chalice. The aroma brings apples, yeast, alcohol, cider, grapes, and white wine. Flavor brings much of the same, along with a subtle alcoholic sweetness. The feel is pretty good, with a lasting quality of alcoholic apple cider. Overall, a decent brew."
"O - Yummy take on this awesome style. Great collaboration."
"Gnomegang pours a halfway cloudy tangerine, though it gets as light as lemon yellow depending on the lighting. The frothy white crown comes up to being three fingers tall. Head retention is just average for the style, and lacing is a bit short of top notch examples. The nose is a spot on blend of pears/granny smith apples, hebal and spicy hop notes, and more intense pepper and clove phenols. That balance gets lost on my palate though as a the phenolic/hop notes take over just a tad too much for the beer to be great. The hop bitterness is dialed in perfectly to mark the transition from fruity flavors to the other, and there's also just a hint of warmth from the alcohol that blends in nicely to the finish. The beer just finishes too phenolic and dry (even for a BSPA) for my taste. Given that, I'm pleasantly surprised by how superb the mouthfeel is. The body is light for such a potent beer, yet maintains enough of a backbone to stand up to all the flavors that make up the beer. At the same time the carbonation cuts through everything like a knife, without becoming obtrusive. The bubbles feel very small/fine and precise on my tongue, and as a result I don't think I'd change anything about the mouthfeel. A little bit more balance in the flavor department and Gnomegang would be world class, but as it is it's a very good beer."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy notes and a spicy cinnamon. In the taste, earthy, spicy, and a big cinnamon presence. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. Quite spicy, but nice earthiness to balance it out."
"Overall: I can't say that I loved this beer. The aftertaste bugged me, and the hops and spice from the yeast didn't seem to get along. All that said, it's not a bad beer, just not for me."
"D-i was glad to find this on tap with out having to buy a bomber to try it. this beer really reminds me of a very strong witbier. the ABV does hit quickly and makes it more difficult to finish. I think they could've made this a bit lighter and it would be a spectacular belgian for the summer."
"Reminds me a bit of Augustijn Grand Cru. Had a few kegs of grand cru to make the comparison. Spicy and dry. If you like dry Belgian ales, this one will not dissappoint. The floral mouthfeel and occasional desire for insane ABV are the only reasons I haven't gone 100% German with my beer choices."
"Beer is thinner than I thought it would be a very flavorful, nice body, nice carbonation, good breadiness to it. The yeast fill otu the midpalate nicely, the finish is a little dry, overall a good beer but I won't have more, I'll just drink la fin du monde."
"This bottle was shared with a fellow BA last night. This beer poured a slightly cloudy, vibrant gold with a light white lacing around the rim of the glass. The aromas was quite impressive and varied. It gave off pale malt sweetness, honey, yeast, some spice, cloves, and light floral hops (almost like hibiscus even). The taste was superb! It was a beautiful bouquet of perfectly blended flavors. The spices, light hops, floral aspects, yeast, cloves and honey all blended so perfectly. I was blown away. It's probably the best tasting Belgian strong pale I've had since the first time I opened a Bruery Mischief, but better. It drank light and left a nice yeasty, spicy aftertaste. This beer is a top notch representation of the style. I'm really glad we tried it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is very nice and refreshing. Its pretty easy drinking and the alcohol only really appears in the finish. Clove flavors get slightly more aggressive as the beer warms but nothing too crazy. Glad I got to try this one."
"Not much into pale ales but thought I'd give this one a try being of the Belgian persuasion, glad I did. I wouldn't seek it out again because it is still a little bitter for my taste but definitely worth the try."
"Overall, I would rate this beer as one of my new favorites. It has some amazing qualities that I love in beers. Defiantly makes me what more, I'm going to have to head back to the store tomorrow and see if there are some more. Very drinkable, the higher ABV (9.5%) is well done. Definitely a beer that I would recommend to anyone who like Belgian ales."
"Pours a bright yellow color with a two finger head which recedes to skim and leaves a little lace on the glass. The aroma is of citrus fruits along with yeast sweetness and a hint of clove. The taste has a nice sweet yeast backbone along with some citrus flavors up front, in the middle is the clove presence. The noble hops come through at the end to round out the beer, not a big hop bite but a nice mellow flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and just a hint of alcohol slickness. The overall is good, very solid nice inviting aroma and solid flavor. The abv is very well hidden with just a hint being shown in the mouthfeel."
"O- an excellent collaboration that was quite tasty"
"Excellent beer, good flavor. Drinkable in spite of its higher ABV."
"Overall, pretty good, nothing wrong, tasty, little boozy."
"Overall I will seek more, this is fantastic. One of the best belgian style blondes I have had."
"O: Great beer, definitely up in the ranks of top Belgians."
"I'm glad to have tried this beer on tap, since my love for Brasserie d 'Achouffe and occasional interest in Ommegang had me eying the bottle, but until now I've balked at buying it. Now I'm planning on buying a bottle and saving it in case I get a chance to seduce someone in a forest."
"D - Other than the unpleasant smell, this is pretty solid. Better than Tramp Stamp in any case. I'd try it on-tap to see if the smell is from bottle shock."
"I am extra skeptical of these collaborations these days but this beer goes above and beyond my expectations and created a beer that I enjoyed more than comparable products from either brewer (if my memory serves me right...I always thought La Chouffe was fantastic). Best new beer I've had in a long while highly recommended."
"O- This is a really nice beer. Kudos to Ommegang for making this one. It's not my favorite in it's class, but it's definitely worth trying if you can get ahold of this limited release."
"-Cheers"
"Long, hoppy, spicy, dry finish. Very satisfying brew. The gnomes came through."
"D: outstanding for the mouthfeel and solid all around. I will be going to buy another one or two of these soon."
"O- I am impressed. I love a good BSPA, and this is one that should not be missed. Worth seeking out, I can't wait to get some more."
"Super-smooth and very flavorfull. Get some while you can. Worth every penny. A superbly well-done collaboration!"
"Poured a clear, orange gold w/ small head and not much lace on top of an aroma that perks up w/ citric notes, spice, yeast, some sugary sweetness and a touch of sourness. A very crisp, clean blonde that is somehow light in body yet smooth, chewey, a little sticky as well in the mouthfeel. I'm getting all kinds of balanced tastes such as breadiness and crisp carbonation and some bitter hops for dryness, and yet I'm also picking up fruit flavors that range from sour citric to grape to plush fruit like apple and pear and also sweetness from caramel, sugar and sweet fruit, plus a pickup from spices and the ABV is rather well hidden, though it combined w/ the spices bring a little hotness to the finish (nothing major). Pleasantly surprised that none of this is muddled and this is a great collabo."
"Served from tap into a snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, and slight sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The banana aspect going on in this one was quite pleasant and enjoyable. When this was coupled with the slight heat from the alcohol it was quite nice. The aroma was very good too and kept me coming back for more... This one was pretty good in just about all aspects. Definitely would suggest this to other BAs and friends as it is a must try."
"O: The ale doesn't feel like a 9.5% beast. Instead, the swirling flavors are comforting and brilliant. Hands down the best brewer of Belgian-style ales in the U.S."
"Had this on tap at the Blue Monk in Buffalo. Pours a straw to golden color with a thick white head that lasted to the bottom. The aroma was mostly belgian yeast with hints of citrus and honey. The mouthfeel was that wonderful belgian creaminess. The flavor was a smooth balance of belgian yeast, bready malts, and hints of lemon and honey. It had a very tasty, bready aftertaste that lasted. If this is what the two breweries can produce when getting together, then they should do so more often."
"O: Excellent effort. This might just re-ignite my interest in Ommegang."
"Overall another winner from the Ommegang Brewery! Can't go wrong with them ever..."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a beer to seek out!"
"D- Low drinkability."
"O: I wanted to try this the moment I heard about it, and I only regret I did not buy two. This is an excellent beer with wonderful flavor, and it is pretty balanced. It has sweetness, but it also has hops. It is smooth and delightful. I plan on buying another one."
"Notes: Enjoyable BSPA, a little heavy on the spicy but a sweet malt/honey provides a bit of balance. I enjoyed this, but it wasn't my favorite for the style."
"Drinkability/Overall-Easily goes down and superbly crafted; an excellent collaboration attempt, my hats off to both Ommegang and Chouffe for this excellent team effort."
"O - Hides the 9% well. Taste is great. A little too sweet to really throw back, but pairs fantastic with sweet & spicy pulled pork... which I just so happen to be eating : )"
"D: A great beer. I'm seeing the price is going to be around $15 for the 750 which is pushing it, but you'll get quality believe me."
"Yumm!!! I'd have to think long and hard to recall an Ommegang beer I've liked more than this. Very impressive."
"o - Overall this beer reminds me of the ommegang brewery in many ways. I'm really surprised that this categorized as a BSPA since it screams Saison in every way except for the ABV. Way more earthy and grassy than I expected for the style, but with the collaboration, it makes sense. This is a good beer, but I think you'd be happier with a bottle of Hennepin at a fraction of the price."
"D- Really drinkable! I quite enjoyed this one despite the bitterness. Too bad it's pretty limited, not to mention pretty expensive at Sapsuckers at $25 a bottle."
"D: One of the most drinkable BSPAs I've had in long while."
"drinkable - oh yes."
"A very enjoyable brew by two of my favorite breweries. Spot on flavors, well balanced. It could be a bit more dry and crisp."
"Will be stocking up on a few more of these and at 13.99 a bottle you can't go wrong. Get them while you can they are a limited release and will probably go fast."
"More head retention and better lacing would have been appreciated, but the excellent flavor, smell, and mouthfeel definitely made up for that."
"Highly drinkable, complex without being cloying. This is one you can savor, or share with friends. What a great beer!"
"C'mon this one is two good to be a one off...gonna stock up on a few bottles...Belgian lovers go get some and enjoy..."
"Overall it is a solid fruity BSPA."
"I am quite impressed with this beer. The collaboration seems to have gotten it right with an absolutely great mouthfeel and flavor."
"Very well-rounded and balanced, nothing less than you would expect from the two breweries involved. A pity this is a one-time release, but maybe we'll get lucky and they'll bring it back again. Hope springs eternal..."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Raleigh during their 11th anniversary event. Served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy dark straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is floral hops, sweet malts and mild pepper. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits, earthy hops and spices such as lemon peel, pepper and coriander. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable, easy drinking Belgian strong pale, I look forward to trying more of this in the future!"
