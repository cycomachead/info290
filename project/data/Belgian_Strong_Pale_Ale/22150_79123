Something off about the beer, I am really struggling to put my finger on it.  To much bad after taste, sticks to the back of the tongue.  Everything else seems good, but the off aftertaste kills the beer for me.  I am thinking that there is something in stillwater that does not work for me.

Lovely little floating bits of ""sediment.""  As I drink this outside by the grill I notice the color of autumn leaves.  Smells fantastic.  Smells yeasty and citrusy at the same time.  It's a bold ad hoppy Belgian as described on the bottle.  I'm still getting a taste for Belgians but this one is most agreeable.  Smooth mouthfeel with just a hint of bitterness.  Despite it's relatively high ABV, it's not offensively alcohol-ee.  One wouldn't know it has a high percentage without reading the bottle... Or waiting for the inevitable pleasant buzz to start.  This is a tasty beer.  I don't review many beers but felt this was a worthy candidate.  Highly recommend Stillwater As Follows.  Cheers!","BeerSnobRobinson","Oct 03, 2014"

4.19,2.4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25," The taste is following the nose yet expands with more herbal and resinous hops mixed with the grassy flavor yet mild astringency with gentle yeast with peppery accent and moderately high carbonation adding to the yeast tanginess in the back of the throat. The flavor is lightly pine oriented with gentle zest and the yeast also brings a vinous element to mind. Overall a very complex Belgian Strong pale with tons of hoppy yeasty cohesion and dry finish making it all the more drinkable. For the 9% it packs you barely get any alcohol in the flavor-deceptive is right!","Slatetank","Jun 28, 2014"

4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/13/2013. Pours hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice/hop bitterness on the finish, with some slight fruity tartness; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 24, 2014"

Small particles of sediment are seen floating in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and citrus and pineapple-like aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, yeast, and fruity flavors on the finish. I am not sure if there is Brett in this one, but it does have a similar aspect in the taste. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has some really nice aromas and flavors that make it super easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 02, 2013"

This one lacks that stony dryness that I love so much, and instead opts for a fruit and peppery flavor that I'm sorry to say doesn't completely agree with my palate. I doubt I'll buy it again, but I really appreciate the complexity and challenge to my senses that this beer brings and it meets the style description quite well, so for that I give it high marks. It definitely has a lot going for it and has me wondering if I should explore more Belgian Strong Pale Ales to see what else is out there.","deadonhisfeet","Aug 14, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, crisp and refreshing with the taste doing a great job at holding my attention, this is the type of beer that I would have no problem drinking the whole 750ml bottle, it's a great summer time beer that keeps me coming back for more. What I liked the most about this beer was how balanced it was, no aspect was too overpowering and it looked very good from the bottle to what was inside it. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it wasn't super expensive at $9.99 for 750ml but that would prevent me from buying it often, I know STillwater just started selling some of their beer in 12oz four packs and I think that would be the perfect format for this beer. I would buy this beer again, it's a great beer to cool off with during the summer heat and I would recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales or Farmhouse Ales. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, this is the second beer I've had from Stillwater and this one is even better than the first one I had, Stillwater is on my radar now and I will for sure be on the look out for more of their beers. This is one of the better Belgian Strong Pale Ales that I have had so far, good job guys, this is one great beer.","StoutHunter","Jun 20, 2013"

The smell is fantastic, it's everything I want in a Belgian with excellent balance.

4.1,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a gold color with a couple inch white fluffy head that stays around a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and fruity, the brew smells like pears, lemon peel, bready malt/wheat, peppery spice, cloves, and a bit of tropical fruit. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but I think the spicy and bready flavors are stronger than the fruity ones. There's also the addition of some green grapes and an herbal flavor to the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with high but soft carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, even though it has a bit too much carbonation for me. With that being said, I'd like to try it again in the future. $9.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Oct 14, 2012"

A careful pour had half a glass of foam, which slowly formed large bubbles but had good retention. Aroma of apple, grape and pear juice, Belgian spicing yeast reminiscent of saison. Flavor dry, apples, pears, slight citrus, light bready malt, finishing with and interesting spicy herbal taste, similar to sage or rosemary. Bitter herbal and citrus peel aftertaste that had interesting enough flavor to be enjoyable. Light to medium bodied, but active carbonation gave this a pleasant mouth feel.

Smells of hops, and strongly of fresh mint (never had this experience with hops, but I’ve heard tell of it). Hints of resin, skunk, Belgian yeast, earthy hay and soil. Flavor is exceptional: grain, measured bitterness, hints of grass and classy Belgian yeast character. Nicely balanced and tasty. Medium bodied with hi, sparkly carb, even a bit too high. Semi dry finish. A really fine beer. I questioned this brewery with its obscure labels and sudden appearance in my area, this is worth it.","harrymel","0"

Not very dry however with bready yeast, alcohol and light fruit countering the hops. Peppery spice with possibly some coriander followed by hints of apple, pear and booze.

The smell of the beer had a slight herbal note to it along with some grains that add a bit of sweetness on the nose. The taste of the beer has a clean refreshing taste to it with some a light lemon-like flavor in there. The yeast and herbal notes are the most flavorful.

4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"wow. tried both the draft and bottled version. i thought the bottled version was showing slightly better. both were fantastic. sort of a super-saison. best analogy that i can make is as follows is to stateside as avec les bon voeux is to saison dupont. here goes: pours a hazy, glowing white gold with a huge, lively white head that shrinks to proper, holds well and leaves tons of lace. nose is full of spicy phenols and fruity esters that seem to just shoot up in to the olfactory factory. i get white pepper and other bright spices at first, which seems to be balanced by pineapple, lemon, peach and maybe some melon. a touch of sweet(ish) doughy/bready malt pokes it head through to create some backbone as well. taste is boom! blast off! fitting to be drinking Stillwater's anniversary beer on the same day as the anniversary of the first space voyage. astronaut Yuri Gagaran would enjoy this, no doubt. taste is all of the spicy, fruity, malty (yeasty, hoppy) notes that i described above translated in an almost weightless body and amplified by fairly zippy carbonation and a pleasant boozy heat. spice notes seemed to lean a bit towards herbs in the middle, and i was thinking i could taste white sage and/or a hint of eucalyptus. it had me thinking super-stateside at first, then super-cellar door, then i realized this was just super-stillwater. stillwater turned up to 11. created on earth but heard in outer space. extremely well-balanced. long spicy finish with a very clean end. i really enjoyed this one.","timtim","Apr 02, 2012"
