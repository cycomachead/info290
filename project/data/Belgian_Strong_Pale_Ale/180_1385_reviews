"First off, bottle exploded after uncorking....fun to drink, very active to say  the least. alcohol is well hid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's something in the bouquet that I can't quite place. Not all together bad, but cloyingly sweet at times and hits hard with those banana-y esters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the nicest Belgium's from Belgium to me. Sweet sorta sour taste with a nice white head and finishes with what I can only describe as a old school bubble gum taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste of crisp apple, pear, honey - dry finish. Great brew!"
""
""
"Overall : Delicious, fresh, warming and almost not feeling like a strong beer. Great craft."
""
""
""
"Has a fruity nose with hints of compost and over ripe fruit. Pours hazy straw to gold under a pure white head that looks like a washing machine gone wild. Strong funky flavors of old plums to old peaches, rich light malts, white bread, a hint of spice and a pleasant bitterness on the finish. Medium full body and medium high carbonation. Biog alcohol but it is not hot or solventy."
""
""
"Delicious pink elephants always satisfy."
""
""
"Bitter.Bitter.Bitter.Bitter.Bitter to the very end"
""
""
"Stronger than other beers. Very good."
""
"It's also a bit light and possible to feel unpleasant alcoholic tones"
"Final Grade: 4.41, an awesome A grade. I had heard a lot of hype about Delirium Tremens prior to procuring this bottle, and I'm quite happy to state that, for the most part, this beer has lived up to its impressive reputation. This is an excellent strong Belgian pale ale; one that can be expected to stand up and compare equally (or even favourably) to most of the other big names in this style. All fans of strong Belgian-style beers should consider this one to be a must-have - I'll definitely be keeping a couple of bottles in my cellar for later enjoyment."
""
""
""
"Delicious beer.  I read a review calling it the champagne of beer.....  I must agree."
""
""
""
""
"Very refreshing - tart up front with a smooth lingering citrus finish"
""
""
"Poured a huge fluffy cloud of eggshell white head. Good retention, leaving spotty lacing. Clear and golden in color. Aromas of mostly bananas with notes of cloves and Belgian yeast. Aroma matches taste very well, adding some light citrus into mix. Long lasting aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very smooth and low in carbonation. Acidity lingers toward front of tongue for a short while. The higher alcohol is disguised well, making this sessionable, yet on the pricey side. Still worth it. Overall, a wonderful classic Belgian. One of the better ones I've had. Highly recommended."
""
"Had this at the bar, it wasn't too cold and it shouldnt be. I went out and bought a bottle right away after trying it. Pours gold with a thick foamy head. Smooth and creamy."
""
"The first time I drank this beer I laughed so much I thought it might be laced. This beer is great if you want to have a good time. Very fruity, wheat taste with good carbonation and delicious after taste."
""
"I love most Belgians, but this one missed the mark for me."
""
""
""
"This aromatic golden-colored Belgian is among my all-time favorite beers. Wondrously fruity, fantastic and full of fine yeast. Goes down the drain with ridiculously ease. Well worth the above-average price you'll likely find it for."

"Enjoyed on tap at Craft Beer Market. This was, to me, the champagne of beer. Effervescent and bright, it smelled of clove and Pink Popcorn. I found the taste to be full of the fruit flavor one would expect from Belgian yeast. DT has a lively mouthfeel - this is a unique beer, indeed!"
"Great ale, only thing I can say is to warn someone new to the style that yeast ""snow"" while unattractive, isn't going to hurt you. Drink up!"
""
"Very fruity (Grapefruit, Citrus and Orange). Great mouth feel with a medium/dry finish. A taste that keeps you wanting more."
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Quite quaffable for a Belgian."

"Shame on you Brouwerij Huyghe."
""

""
""
"Overall, this complex palate makes it a beer well worth trying, and drinkability like this at 8.5% isn't easy to come across."
""
"Poured a light orange with overflowing head about 4in.  That was my fault on the head, but was poured into a Belgian Ale Glass, tastes a carbonated grapefruit and citrus upfront with an alcohol end.  Super solid and citrus-y.  Fairly light but a great complex beer!"
""
""
"overall quality from start to finish"
""
""
""
""
"Awesomeness..... flavor, smell, texture, high quality...."
""
""

"A great Belgian with what i can best describe as champagne like quality's.  A great beer for almost any palate. Biggest gripe... it's obnoxiously expensive!!"

"Given other reviews, maybe the keg wasn't the freshest.  I have had this before (but it's been a while) and thought it more fruity than what I tasted today.  Will have to revisit."

"This poured a nice slightly hazy golden colour with a thick mousse like white head.  The nose had some grass, banana, yeast and a bit of a honey edge.  Some of the same came forward in the taste with a bit of alcohol burn.  But it finished fairly crisp.  The mouthfeel is a slight carbonation.  A pretty tasty little beer."

"Great beer, I highly recommend it"

"I love to drink it slowly, starting cold and warming up. The flavors change with the temperature"
""
""
"Negative is high price."
""
"A beautifully put together fruity arrangement. I picked up light fruits and an almost bubble gum taste. Lots of carbonation. This is a fun beer."
"Pours a very light gold, slightly cloudy. Estery, slightly fruity aroma. Upon first taste, hints of starburst/jolly rancher came through. Light carbonation. A very tasty beer to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer that provides the notes of cloves and bananas that you would expect from many belgium beers. It is tasty, not terribly filling, and a great beer to start or end the night with."
""
""
"It was painful to drink in my opinion"
""
""
"Hay de belgas a belgas... Strong Pale Ale de caché para ocasiones especiales. Ideal para acompañar una sesión de Brot, Käse und Speck."
""
""
""
""
"By far my favorite beer. Before I first drank this beer I almost only drank stouts. This beer as opened my eyes to the whole world of beer. Such a smooth flavor with a peppery aftertaste. I recommend eating with pulled pork or a juicy burger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Hands down, my favorite beer. Anything from Delirium is good but the original is the best.  And I just love those pink elephants and dancing alligators."

"O - for a big brew, this is SOOO easy to drink.  I don't think the lack of carbonation hurts the score.  Would have rated it higher if it had more carb, and if it was 9.2%.  Definitely on my Beershelf HoF.  Would like to try it on tap sometime...."

"Nice ..Heavy carbonation, slight medicinal taste on first sip. Complex flavours from the battle of the yeasts. One hop flavour at the trailing edge of the sip has a very very bitter taste. Would try again as there are enough flavour high notes to get me back for another evaluation"

"Dark yellow, almost orange. Full white head that goes away quickly. Leaves a nice white foam. Smells of citrus and spice. Almost Christmasy. No hoppy flavor at all. Taste of clove and spice. Champagne like effervescence / carbonation. A fabulous beer at 8.9 ABV. A must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity. Good beer overall but a bit pricy."
""
""
""
"A great Christmas beer...reminds me of a Robert Frost poem. From the first smooth sip I got so excited I drank all 330ml within 5 minutes. It is a great base before a few shots of Jagermeister. If you are looking for meal to compliment this rich belgium ale, I would select brown rice with bacon bits and shredded cheese. The smell of pine nuts and roasted almonds blended with erotic citrus tones gets me excited. Hmmmm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth mouthfeel, lively carbonation, which leads warm spices to the palate, wrapped up by soft, slick Belgian yeast. Spices, mainly cloves, dominate the taste of this beer, with yeast shining through in an enjoyable way. Medium-bodied beer, convincing due to is unusual present spices, even for this style of beer. Yeast provides depth and balance, without becoming too present on its own. Aftertaste is still very soft on the palate, while warm, sharp spices have already left the palate. Almost a bit watery for 8,5 abv, no alcohol recognizable at all."

"Long beer, very fizzy. A good example of a Belgian Strong Golden. It has everything right but nothing extraordinary (like Karmeleit for example). I would still say that if you come across it, you MUST try it."

"Pours a pale hazy yellow with a large long lasting white head, some light lacing. Aroma and taste has some mild banana notes upfront, fruity citrus, some orange marmalade flavors with a bit of caramel malt and Belgian yeast as it warms up and some mild bitter hops on the end for balance. Palate is a medium body, smooth going down with good carbonation. Overall I feel this is a very good well made, tasty and flavorful brew. Try it."

"Everything you need to know is in the name of the beer, Belgian Pale is either too tangy on the first sip, or it sits just right, and in the case of the latter delirium tremens will be soon to follow. Delicious to anyone who enjoys Leffe, Tripel, Dubbel, or similar styles, this just happens to be one of the most drinkable of the ilk."

"Well yee-haw. This beer is great. Wonderfully well-rounded and the flavour notes were so unique--yet worked so well together--and were very pronounced: peach, banana, pink peppercorn and spearmint. This bouquet is effusive and will definitely have you seeing pink elephants, which were quite charming on the glass. :)"

"Pours a light straw color. Thick white head that dissipates rapidly and leaves no lacing behind. On the nose some lemon and green apple with a grassy undertone. On the palate a dry mix of citrus bitterness and malt. More of that green apple on the swallow. Neither sweet nor bitter, this one."

"Pours a hazy light gold with a bubbly head that stays for a whole, eventually settling to a thin layer of foam. Smells of yeast, fruit and white pepper. Taste of apple and pear with a smooth creaminess. Light and crisp mouth with a great balance of carbonation. The flavors expand as it warms. An easy drinking ale that is perfect for the summer months."

"anyway, it's a shame that 1) these bottles (Duvel included) cost as much as they do and 2) no U.S. brewery seems to be able to quite match the cleanliness and bone dryness of DT and Duvel when producing an homage to these beers / the ""style""... this beer is very different in the bottle compared to on draft, at least where and when I've had it on draft... unless the tap line is calibrated perfectly, the bottle is the way to go with DT, not that you'd want to drink it often - there's plenty more Belgian brews out there with more to offer... this, to me, is just a fancily-packaged malt liquor equivalent... still something I'd hook up with now and then"

"Only my second Belgian Ale and a fun experience. A pale clear straw color in the glass with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Drinkable and refreshing with complex spice and herb notes, notably mild clove, and a hint of grain. One of the best jobs of masking a high alcohol content I have experienced. Our table of four agreed that the beer seemed very light and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is not too thin, and overall this is very nicely balanced."
"O: a nice BSPA that would definitely be called a sipper. I think I'd need to revisit this one in a while to give it another whirl and see if it comes out the same."

"I can see why this is a classic offering of this style, but it's not as tasty as Duvel nor as complex as Stille Nacht. At this price point, I expected a bit more. There are other beers in this style I want to try, so I doubt I will be returning to this one for a while. Still, very glad I tried it and wish I hadn't waited so long."
"Appearance is a clear light straw color. This offering had a half finger of clear white head that dissipated quickly. The nose had the classic Belgian funkiness. The Belgian yeast really comes through in the flavor profile. The finish is nicely semi-dry."

"I enjoyed this but found it to be less than satisfying for such a high price."
"Though I was not impressed by this beer's fruity/yeast aroma the flavor was fantastic. This beer has a very full bodied, slightly hoppy bitter flavor followed by citrus and malty aftertaste. I was shocked to find the alcohol flavor of this beer to be more of an undertone rather than the commanding flavor I'd expect from a 8.5% beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful pour into a snifter. This head isn't going anywhere, and I absolutely love that in a beer. Some nice lacing, as well. Belgian ales are not my usual go-to beer, but this one is pretty tasty. The alcohol is nicely masked. You could tell me this puppy is 2%, and I'd believe you."

"What can I say about a beer that is named after a medical condition that happens to alcoholics after withdrawing? It's great beer compared to other beers of the world, but is marginal good compared to other Belgium Strong Ales. It is definately a hipster beer. It pours bright gold, has a petite head that sticks around a little bit, and stable body (average carbonation). It has a natural taste of grasses, malts, hops, earth, and sweetness, with the yeast taste running major interference. It has an edge to it's tast becuase of the 8.5% ABV, it has malty aftertaste, and is a filling beer."

"""The Champagne of Beer"" This beer is just like champagne in the best ways. The color is light yellow with a creamy head. The best word for this beer is effervescent. You can feel the bubbles in your nose as you take a sip. Upon giving a sniff the smell of apples and pears came through. The taste is light yet filling with a bunch of citrus from the Belgian wheat. Loved this beer and would totally recommend."

"O: Not my first time with this beer... and glad I could finally review it. It is one that I often use as a beginner for my night or with dinner. It is less a dessert beer, but pairs well with cheese, crackers and other hors d'oveurs. This beer is one of my personal top 25s. Exceptional."

"Wow. Absolutely fantastic. If you have the chance to try this, you must."
"Delirium Tremens ---4/5."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall this beer has surpassed most of my expectations and will go down as one of my favorites."
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow in color. A good 1-finger white head that settles down to a very thing white layer that is mostly around the sides of the glass. Not much lacing is seen. The aroma is of yeast, malts and sweet light fruits. The taste of malts with lemon hits your tongue first followed it a slight sweet but tangy finish. Just a slight bitter finish was noted but didn't linger too long."
""
"Taste starts with light pear, then moves to belgian yeast and spice, with a tart apple, alcohol finish. Yeasty, dry, tart, alcohol aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light in body with very high carbonation, a bit of graininess."
""
""
"Warming, smooth, with a drying aspect. Slight bit of cleaning in the finish. Medium bodied maybe a touch more. Carbonation is a bit rough, almost fizzy, but that's a minor quibble. A fine brew but the Nocturum is better."
""
""
""
"Overall: Every time I try this beer out, it gets better and better."
""
""
""
""

"O: Fantastic beer; highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a good floral/fruity beer without the artificial taste."
""

"Overall: This is a very good brew. It’s citrus bouquet, and champagne like bubbling carbonation flows throughout the beer. Due to the bubbling carbonation, the beer finishes light. The finishing bitter is reminiscent of citrus zest."
""
"Have had the Tremens before out of the bottle, but I must say that the pour from tap in Brussels was damn good. It held up to my expectations as a representation of a strong Belgian style. It is what I would recommend to someone who has never experienced a strong Belgian style ale. I sampled several of the other Delirium brews, but I must say that the Tremens was my favorite."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is okay, but the finish wasn't all that spectacular. Gets a little too astringent as time passes and the flavor becomes a little bland. Decent, but not my top choice in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A beer that has to be tried. One will come back to it here and there. For some it's a favorite beer. Tremens may be the best quality affordable non-whale Belgian Strong Pale Ale along with Goose Island's Matilda. There is better in the style though that drinkers will seek out. I wish the head was better because the body color is truly as if the sun was squeezed into your glass. Smells great. Tastes great. Feels like a sticky champagne. Drink It."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich deep golden colored with a thin head of foam that does not cover more than half of the top. Loads of carbonation bubbles. Very apparent that this is not a filtered brew as there are some pretty good sized floaties in here! I get biscuity malt and Belgian yeast. The mouth is fairly carbonated but dry. Flavor is crisp and you get a bit of sweetness reminiscent green apple and some gentle tartness in the fade from the Belgian yeast."
"Price Point - $10.99/750 ml bottle"

""

"O - I really appreciate the various elements of this beer. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Belgian ales."

"Delirium Tremens from Huyghe brewery is a Belgian Golden from the part of Belgium known as Flanders. This beer has a wonderful appearance, that is very inviting. The smell has so many citrusy and beautiful aromas that give such a strong draw to this beer. Delirium Tremens also a well-known international name that commands respect. But in comparison with other breweries of Belgium in the southern French speaking region of the same style, this beer maybe able to stand its ground, but is just simply not as tasty as its southern cousins. The taste is alright, good but not the best for Belgium Blonde lovers, and the mouth feel is nothing out of the ordinary. I would say the beer is still advanced for the Belgium Blonde drinker, and is also a must try, as despite the taste ratings, in comparison to all beer styles and Belguim Blondes from other countries, Delirium Tremens is a great beer. I just choose to compare the beer with others of the same style inside their country."

"O: Yeah, this was great. As I had expected it to be. The ceramic colored bottle it sweet too. It's a fairly expensive bottle but it's well worth it, this was incredible."
""
"O- Not a fan of the feeling of this one. the taste is pretty good but it does have that alcohol bite to it. Would be better if the mouth feel was a bit smoother. Loved the huge yeast notes in the smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A quite nice an impressive looking BSPA, certainly on par with the other fine examples, this had notes of pine floral cleaner and a balanced yeasty profile. Would have it again."

"Maybe the second best known Belgian strong pale after Duvel, fairly easy to track down and worth trying on tap as well as from the bottle. DTs pours a nice lemon drop yellow, pretty clear and sparking with a minimal amount of white head that nevetheless leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a compelling blend of dusty spicy yeast, sweet fruits, and an interesting funk or horse blanket note, almost like an old library full of musty tomes. Not brett per se but you are definitely sniffing something full of interesting esters. Palate is sweet, sour, and bitter all rolled together, a rich honey malt sweetness coupled with cardamom and coriander spice notes like a yellow curry, and some orange rind, apple and pear fruit to round out the corners a bit and provide added juicy complexity. Reasonably chewy and thicker than a tripel but still pretty crisp and refreshing with some hops cleansing the palate. The alcohol is amazingly well obfuscated. Its almost not there. I actually prefer this to Duvel, itself a classic. The additional spice is ... Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't really get what the hype is with this beer. Sure, it tastes like a typical belgian, if you can get around the massive alcohol taste. It's so uninhibited, that I'd even go so far as to say that I've had 15% ABV brews that are smoother than this. It's cloying, distracting, and out of place. The mouthfeel is too syrupy and thick, and it allows the alcohol to cling to your taste buds and distract you from further sips. If you want a pretty or fragrant beer, you could do worse, but in taste, I can't recommend."
"No reason to go out of your way to get this."
"O: Give me Duvel every day of the week but there's nothing dreadfully wrong with this beer -- it's just a bit too heavy-handed with alcohol presence for me."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"Solid interpretation of the style. Only Duvel would be a clearly superior example, while others could be. Aromatic and texturally magnificent, this beer gets better each time you try it. Like most (if not all) beers, it is better on tap, so if you get a chance to have it at a bar, go for it. Orange and apple-like flavors give way to a strong sense of cloves. I would also recommend the other varieties from this brewery."

"O - The Delirium beers are bottled in this iconic ceramic-looking bottle - a painted brown bottle - that does a fantastic job of keeping any light out, perfect for extended aging. The problem with the bottle though, is that it makes it impossible to see any sediment lying in wait, and the Delirium beers always seem to be chock-full of it, rushing into your glass with even the most gentle pour. Chunky floaties aside, Delirium Tremens embodies the Belgian Strong Golden Ale style; fragrant, tasty, and dangerously drinkable, ready to knock one on their ass if they're not careful."
""
"My friend and I both said ""wow"" after the first taste. I am not sure if it was the citrus notes or the carbonation, but it was an impressive entrance. It's not the best beer I have had but it is VERY good. The soapy looking head was a disappointment, but overall a pretty impressive beer."

"This pours a golden, amber color with a fizzy head. This is one of those beers that has those little ""floaties"" in it. The aroma is full of yeast, citrus, and banana. The flavor is pretty sweet and delivers a smooth, complex flavor that is full-bodied and delicious. Another delicious Belgian beer that is pretty readily available."

"This is my ""not much of a drinker"" wife's favorite beer. I found it once in Chicago for her then years later it became accessible locally. The price is salty enough to give one hypertension. Twenty bones for a four pack, CRIPES! I've drank one in my life and it tasted like bitter wine. I guess when my wife drinks she doesn't funk around. A beer too rich for me, in a couple ways!"

""

"O: You know you're in for a unique beer when the bottle is cream-colored with speckles. I can tell that there's quality behind this beer, and that some may even consider it a favorite, but it wasn't for me. The crisp appearance is extremely enticing, and the smell and first wave of flavors is very pleasant, but the aftertaste and high carbonation didn't suit me well. Like I said, I know that this beer is a good brew, (well suited to the style and to the palates of some) which is why I bumped up my 'overall' score higher than the individual categories would calculate out to, but overall it just isn't for me."

""
""
""

"I picked this up on close out at the super market, and it seems likely Delirium Tremens really shouldn't be aged this long. I rarely drink Delirium Tremens, and this tasting has reminded me why: it really is the Sam Adams of Belgian beer. It's available so widely, it's not a treat to find it, and if you're going to drink a beer this style, there are much better choices. Don't get me wrong, this is a great beer. But there are far better beers available nearly as widely for the genre (and perhaps at less expense)."
""
"Drinking it, the flavor works its way from the nose to the back of the throat. Taste starts out on a malty note as it works down to the throat with a very slight hint of a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Character of the Belgian yeast comes through. Strong carbonation, a beer i think i would prefer to drink cold and at a good pace to avoid it getting warm. Fairly refreshing beer that does not stick on palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow, every time that I have this beer I just love it more and more. The way this beer refreshes is just amazing. If you like Belgium beers and haven't had Delirium Tremens, you need to. On a funny side note, Delirium Tremens is actually an alcohol withdraw symptom that includes severe shaking. Interesting name for this amazing beer."
""
""
""
"O- Going from appearance to overall this beer gets progressively better. While the overall score was brought down by the smell and appearance, the taste is outstanding. If taste were the only thing, this beer is outstanding."
""
"As an added note, the opaque gray and black speckled bottle really builds suspense as you're getting ready to pop the top and pour. I've never been more excited to pour a beer."
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 4/2014. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass; with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Aromas of big grape, apple, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with a moderate malt balance. Taste of big grape, apple, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, lemon zest, banana, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters; with a good amount of malt balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale ale. Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with good malt balance; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."

"Deer lord, please drink this out of a tulip glass and pair it with a basil and beef Thai chili dish. Additionally, be sure to order it from a stored bottle and not a tap system, a lot of bars carry it and not everyone knows how to serve, store, or attach the tremens keg properly. Trust the hands of the Belgians."
""

"Overall enjoyable. Again, nothing extraordinarily special in my opinion."

""
""

"Overall - Tasty. Nice herbal taste. Nothing really distinguishing about it though."
"O: Overall, I love this beer. This was one of the first high gravity craft beers I ever had, and every time I drink it it brings back memories. I know Duvel is the standard of the style, but for me, this one blows Duvel out of the water. One of my all time favorite Belgians, and I love Belgians."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only Belgian I can say, in my opinion, is superior would be La Chouffe. If you ever see the Pink Elephant on the white ceramic bottle, give it a shot. Pretty much every person i've introduced this to instantly says this is one of the best beers they've ever had. Try one, please. A good price usually falls around $5.99 per 12oz, $10.99-13.99 per 750ml, and $21.99 per 6-pack. Expensive, but worth it."
""
""
"O - Very nice. World class pale ale. Closely resembles a tripel more than a belgian pale I think."
"Well, it's a pretty good beer, but not amazing. Basically what I think is happening here is that it's so carbonated that it numbs your taste buds and you can't really tell what the flavor is. At least that's what happened with me. No matter how long I kept it in my mouth, the sting of the carbonation never really went away. The flavors which I was able to discern weren't too flattering. This beer actually tasted a bit like raw meat. Weird, right? Tasted a bit like blood or something. Not bad, but not worth the $10 I paid for it."
""
""
""
"O-This is one of the beers that first got me into beer, and it remains delicious in my book. There are other, more complex examples of the style, but for a traditional, strong Belgian brew, Tremens is still a good pick."
""
"I took a psychopharmacology class in the spring of 2009. Since then, I have found it rather hilarious that any beer would name itself Delirium Tremens. I find it odd that while the alcohol is not particularly high, the amount of sweetness here is off the mark."
"Way more pineapple than I know what to do with. Loaded with Belgian yeast and the associated flavor profile. Better than expected."
""
""
""
""

"O: Impressive but slightly lacking the X factor that marks out great beers."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, no, not the greatest beer ever made. But it was very good nonetheless."
"Nonetheless, it's about the only thing I have to drink around here. Rochefort's all sold out. This Delirium -- the most important thing to know about it is that it has a bitter aftertaste. Not nearly as bad as those peculiar bitter beers you can buy in Belgium -- the name of the category escapes me. But there's something of the same spirit in it. A bit of bitter, a bit of sour. You can still use the bottle as a weapon, though -- lob that bottle right and you can knock out any policeman. Let 'em run, let 'em chase you in the rain."

The body of the beer is dominate by dark fruit flavors and grape in particular. This beer is somewhat sweet and quite floral in a tropical sense. The body is surprisingly think and has a nice feel to it. Hides the alcohol quite well. Overall, pretty darn good and very darn different."

"It pours golden in color. Very thick and syrupy dispite looking like a lite beer. Translucent, not cloudy. Very sweet smell, possibly floral in there as well as a slight note of alcohol as the beer is 8.5 abv. This beer is sweet to the tounge as well on the first sip. Can't drink it too fast though as it is very thick and syrupy. No noticable or dercenable bitterness nor any hop notes. Excellent taste for the Belgian Golden ale lover."

"This was a great beer. I have had this beer on several occasions but this one was the best. Maybe I had a bad batch before or maybe I can finally appreciate it. The beer was poured in a frosted mug and there was a half an inch of foam. I did taste a little bit of fruit in the beer but cannot pinpoint which one(s). Enjoyed the first sip as much as the last. I am looking forward to my next glass."

"Nevermind, this beer is full of taste and exotic flavours. Grapes, spices, citrus, bananas...you name it. All flavours glow. I'll have another pink elephant right after this one. Cheers"

"O: I don’t think of this as a particularly ‘refined’ Belgian. That may be the reason that I don’t buy/order it very often. Maybe that’s not fair...I dunno. However, it’s a fun beer to drink and quite tasty. Is that a pink elephant I see?"

"Great brew without any question, there are many details in many aspects to get as a gimmick, not even the beer quality itself but also with the unique label and bottle design. Love that."
"It’s nice, but considering the style, it doesn't fulfill its potential. I would expect more taste complexity and depth, so it could stand up to the (modest) alcohol content/booziness."

"As a person who is not a fan of Belgian beers, I find myself enjoying Delirium Tremens despite it being a Belgian strong ale. Pale gold, hazy, and with a rapidly dissipating head, it smelled sweet and fruity; tart green apples, close to no banana and clove in the nose but it was detectable near the end as it warmed. Very strong tasting; best description would be too imagine what an ""imperial"" Belgian would taste like. Tart and dry, fruity and slightly spicy with a medium-thin mouthfeel and lots of carbonation, almost over carbonated actually. Only slightly less carbonated than an American pale lager, in my opinion. Coriander and spice notes more apparent as it warms. Very hot and warming, with an alcoholic buzz started minutes after the first several sips. the name is very appropritate. I'd drink this again!"
""
"O - Very drinkable, but not what I would consider a typical belgium strong ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Def a strong Belgian beer, but what a great way to end the night with a refreshing pale ale was served in a snifter glass. I had it with fish and chips and went perfectly . I did experience some weird dreams last night. But woke up and with a slight head ache. definitely get it again!!"
""
""
"O- Excellent all around BSPA. It has an all around beautiful appearance. It has a wonderful bouquet. If you like apples your going to be in for a real treat. Over all this is a top notch brew."
""
"O: Good Belgian beer, would be great with a medium cheese or salty meat. Dryness is appropriate with just the right amount of hops."
""
""
"O: Delirium packs a punch at 8.7%, but it's duplicitous, neither the smell, nor taste give the higher alcohol content away. It's light and easy to drink. It would pair well with pastry - like croissants, it's yeast and spices would compliment butter pastry perfectly."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Color: clear yellow golden. Head: thick, white. Nose: spicy, yeasty, fruity (citrus), clear alcohol presence. Taste is very Belgian with lots of yeast, spicy and fruity. Delirium Tremens is a very fine strong ale but I prefer La Guillotine by the same brewer."

"It's not the best ever, but it borders on great. I will buy it again and again."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Absolutely one of the best BSPA's I've had. It's right up there with Duvel. A little pricey (as most Belgians are) but definitely worth it. Great beer!"

"O - This beer is enjoyable on many levels, those of a strong ale, a wit or hefe, and a pale ale. Such a complex ale with notes from all over, and a completely impressive pour. This is a beer that's worth the high price, not one I'd drink every day, even if I could, just because it's so unique and multi-layered that it deserves the status of a celebration beer."

"O: this is a well-crafted and good-tasting beer, similar to a Duvel - but that may be its limiting factor: because it is so similar to a Duvel, without being superior (and probably being slightly less-available), it isn't probably a ""return to"" beer for me. All fans of Belgian pales need to give it a try, though, because it is a good example of the style."

"Might be my new favorite BSPA."
"O - One of my favorite beers. Flavorful, balanced, and highly drinkable. The alcohol is masked well and sneaks up fast. This is a beer that is welcome on almost any occasion, year round."
""
"On tap at the brewery. Pours hazy orange with a short-lived white head. Aroma is of ripe fruit, some citrus notes and caramel. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Caramel and biscuit malt, herbal and piney hops and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Long dry finish. Tasty brew."

"A classic! This one pours a bubbly, but clear pale golden color and a fizzy white head. A little esther in the aroma as well as a fruity character. I pick up apple and something a little more tropical. The carbonation and fruitiness make for a little pucker upon each sip. For this style of beer, it's near perfect. That, along with the unique packaging make for a really cool beer."

"Bought a bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Beautiful thick white head with a light wheat-hued color. Smell a bit on the sour side like grapes and apples with ethanol and hops present as well. The flavor seemed to match the smell with a bit too much of the sourness coming through for my taste. Overall, this was a great Belgian strong pale ale, but with so much competition, I would put it lower than some others. I enjoyed it and I recommend it, but I might have to revisit it in order to give a better opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this beer is fairly clear straw-golden color with a thick, long lasting head. The aroma is medium-high spicy and peppery phenols, beneath the phenols are some fruity, cherry notes, a pleasant nose. The flavor is rather complex, initially spicy and peppery, then a moderate hop bitterness emerges, enhanced by a slightly tart and notably dry finishes. Beneath it all are noticeably fruity notes and finally a bit of hop emerges again long after the swallow. The body is moderate, boosted up by an appropriately high level of carbonation. Overall a tasty, all around well made beer, glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink but it will sneak up on you."

"Overall I'm glad I tried this beer but it won't be a regular."

"Conforms to my faint memories: this is a good, solid beer that is always welcome in the glass. If only they could bottle that smell..."
""

"Overall- I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a while. I finally found it and I am very happy I did. Very good but I wouldn't enjoy more than a few or you will be quickly inebriated."

"A very dry taste and finish, only a hint of sweetness in the front that is reminiscent of white wine. Hints of lemon and orange zest come through lightly in the front side of the palate as well. Here is where it comes right to the brink of tart, but is dried out by the peppery notes and hops. It moves into a very inviting dryness with the help of these light peppery notes and a little bit of clove. The hops then come in with a lemon grassy quality that goes well with the carbonation and peppery notes. The second half of the bottle proves to have more yeasty notes, nothing overly funky but a definite added belgiany farmhouse character. The vinous qualities are very pleasant and work well with this beer. The bone dry taste is superb and complex, letting this beer shine. I definitely recommend for the fan of Belgians as this one is worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium dark yellow hue, good head retention, suspended sediment, nose of fruits, yeast, spice, hops, smooth subtle honey upfront, yeasty, good blend of flavours works very well together, smooth mellow aftertaste. Typical good Belgian beer, top notch for any occasion, packs a sneaky punch at 8.5%"

"Wacky name and pink elephant aside, this is a really tasty beer. It may be hard to get past what seems like gimmicky packaging, but the strong Belgian pale ale inside is well worth the effort. The rich golden colour is enticing, the thick white head inviting. And then you get a whiff of the spicy, fruity nose--that Belgian yeast working its magic--and, man, it's just amazingly complex and fragrant. Great carbonation makes the high level of sweetness tolerable and it has a fairly dry finish. Again, you get the complexity of the interplay of the malt, kandi sugar and yeast and all kinds of fruity flavours pop up--pear, pineapple, citrus peel."

"D - I'll admit, I'm a sucker for pretty much of yeasty Belgian brew, and this was no exception. Being from Western Canada I don't see very much American craft, so much of my craft beer experience has been focused on Belgian beer, which we seem to get a lot of (Having Unibroue up here as well doesn't hurt!). An all around tasty and balanced Belgian, but a step below some others I've tried. It's also a touch too weighty and sticky to make for a great summer time brew. Overall, a fine Belgian offering that I will certainly be drinking more of down the road."

"better than a duvel. pours a glowing honey color with a very thick foaming white head that lasts forever. smells like belgian yeast, a touch of wildflower honey, light wheat malt, and sticky hops. flavor is close to the nose, although without the honey sweetness. more of a floral character presents itself, with mild spice and assertive hoppiness for the style. feel is nice too, more body than a duvel, not full or anything, but medium at least. nice carbonation lasts the whole glass. 10 bucks for a 10oz is too much money for this (at linger north denver), but it is a very very good beer."

"Poured from 11.2oz ceramic bottle into Piraat tulip. Pours a thick froathy head. Hazy straw golden color. Nice belgian yeast aromas, mixed with a bit of banana, clove, and fruit. Great taste. Very similar to aroma; belgian yeasts and malts with banana and clove notes. Very full of flavor and quite delicious. This truly is an excellent brew. I have had before but not reviewed...id like to revisit on tap!"

"Delirium Tremens is a hazy burnt orange beer with a stark white, fluffy head that piles high. Very light bready malt under yeast, pepper and spice. Pleasant and inviting. Sweet biscuit with a significant pepper, spice, and a hint of apple that leads to a dry finish. Spicy sweetness lingers until the next sip. Pepper and spice grows with the warmth initially with the 8.5% alcohol remaining unapparent the entire time. Taste goes a little flat when it warms too long. Oddly, it helps the taste to warm a little, but there's a window of peak flavor for this beer. I've always liked this beer a lot and can see why it's a popular at multiple tap bars. It's a quality beer that's extremely approachable."

"Really nice to look at. Light, clear pear color with a healthy head and tons of beading; great lacing. The nose is super estery. Ripe fruits: green apple, banana, also some clove. The taste mimics the nose with the addition of a soft, tangy finish that ends up clean. Extremely drinkable - dangerously so. Overall, a must-try."

"The reviews for this are so high because it seems to be the standard for lots of beers that have come after this. There's so much carbonation and booze here that it detracts a bit but anyone who downs a full bottle of this should be proud, for expanding his or her beer horizons if nothing else. The flavors work decently together and no beer will taste quite the same again once this is downed - just ask the pink elephants."

"Painted bottle. Pours clear golden with a big massive fluffy head into my Tremens glass. Bready spicy yeast aroma from the big head, some hay and honey as well. Taste is yeast and a little clove spice, light sweetness, dry finish. This drinks pretty easy, but there is something about it that I'm not a huge fan of. I know I am in the minority on that. I would prefer nocturnum but this is plenty drinkable, just not particularly exciting."

"This was a bit better than I was expecting and I'm glad my friend got a bottle of this for me. The drinkability is just right. The 8.5% is well hidden and it isn't so light that I fly through it or so heavy that I'm sitting on it for a while."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown amber. Massive carbonation, overflowed the bottle on opening. Large light brown head that slowly dissipated leaving lacing. Aroma of dark and light fruit, Belgian spice and yeast, malt. Taste is dark fruit and malt, light brown sugar. Flavor somewhat attenuated on the finish. Overall pleasant and interesting, but the intensity of the flavor is somewhat lacking. Light to medium mouth feel. A pleasant Belgian ale."
""

"O: nice intro to Belgian style ales, not the best balance for the style"
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from 750mL bottle. Immediately noted the large, promintent near-pure white hear. Very tight foam, almost a soapy quality in how it forms and laces the glass. It has a cloudy, golden color with visible sediment and abundant carbonation visible that fuels the long-lasting head. It smells very sweet, a combination of floral hops and a number of fruits that I couldn’t easily decipher. When you first take a sip, it begins by being sweet. As soon as you pull the glass away the spiciness sets in and it is honestly very unique compared to everything else I’ve had. As it settles there are slight notes of bitterness and long lingering spiciness that leaves you wanting more. I could barely tell the alcohol content was so high while drinking. Very high carbonation, but it doesn’t take away. Medium mouthfeel that lingers with the taste. Overall a great and unique beer."
""
"O: I love the high-caliber crispness of DT. My wife is a fan, too. If you like lighter tastes in beer, this one will wrap itself around your taste buds and squeeze. Yum!"
""
"O - A good ale for on a warm day."
"o: very drinkable and nice, but not as complex or exciting as some of BSPA i have tried."
"Poured from bottle notched 4/2010 to a Duvel Tulip. I've been eying this one a while, finally pulled the trigger. The beer is a yellow golden color with a good 2.5 finger white billowing head. Good retention and lacing. The nose is an impressive blend of citrus (orange and lemon) with a gentle belgian clove and malty sweetness. No hint of alcohol whatsoever. The flavor is a crisp citrus fruit with bananas and clove from the yeast. The malty sweetness works well to balance the mild bitterness. Again, not hint of alcohol. Very good. Finishes crisp with a lingering fruit sweetness on the tongue. Well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. The price tag would be the only thing keeping me away, which won't be for long. Enjoyable."

"Pours a perfectly pale yellow with a huge extremely bright white head. Aroma of green apple and pear predominately, with Belgian yeast and hints of pepper in the background.

"From notes, poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy yellowish hue with an ample head white head (about two fingers worth). The carbonation is fairly aggressive, with fine champagne like bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The smell is slightly grassy with hints of grain, citrus, lemon, hops, and a solid malt backbone. The taste is crisp, with hints of citrus, lemon, pepper, and hops. The mouthfeel is medium verging on heavy bodied. Overall, not my favorite example of the style. Not a bad beer by any means, but, one that doesn't take any real risk or bring any stand out quality to the brew."

"O - Not living up to what for me had been a lot of hype. Still a really good beer, just nothing I'll rush out and grab again in the near future. I have Noel and Nocturnum, and am expecting I'll favor those to the Tremens. Still, recommended to any fan of pale ales."

"Overall there is nothing mind-blowing about this beer but it is quite drinkable, goes down very easy, even with the considerable alcohol content. A nice beer for entry level craft beer aficionados. Quite distinct and memorable for me as this was one of the first Belgian ales I ever sampled and got me into my journey into craft beer."

"Overall: I was a bit surprised by this one. The aromas brought me to a place that reminded me almost of childhood, but the flavors didn't quite follow. This was an enjoyable beer to drink, but the initial conflict between the aroma and flavor threw me off. I would definitely say I enjoyed this beer, but I enjoyed each aspect separately. The aromas and flavors just weren't speaking the same language to me."

"Poured from a bottle into duvel glass a bit hazy, yellow-orangish with a very fluffy white head; great retention. Stays bubbly. Smells a bit yeasty, sweet and fruity; some pears. The taste mathced aroma well, sweet, fruity, but also had a bit of bite to it. Mouthfeel is smooth, lots of carbonation but not harsh, very airy. Great beer, I really enjoyed it. It has a great aroma and taste and is not heavy. Definitely a bottle you can put down alone and enjoy it."
"O: This is an excellent beer and I wish I hadn't put off so long trying it. It's one of my favorite beers now and I'll more than likely buy another for my non beer drinking friends to enjoy."

"Pours a hazed and bubbly golden yellow, big, yet controlled cap of fizzy white froth, settles into nice cap, good rings towards the top of glass. Scent is pale straw, light watery fruits such as apple and pear, moderate spice from the yeasts, bready. Taste a tad bolder than scent dictates, spicier too... solid watery fruit notes and fresh bready yeasts. Medium bodied, bubbly and briskly at first, as carbonation escapes becomes smooth, dry finish. Overall, great representation of the style and easy drinking."

"Overall: This is a solid example of the style no doubt. I am glad to have tried it. But for the coast this could be a more common beer for me. I simply like other choices (even local ones) a little more for my beer dollar. Would have no trouble recommending this, as long as I warned the consumer about the floaties."

"This beer poured out as a hazy golden color with a solid looking white head on top. The smell of the beer gives off some banana aromas with some sweet grains in there too. The taste of the beer is sweet, refreshing, spicy and a little fruity. the mouthfeel is smooth and light. Overall this brew is very good in my opinion. It's surely one to try when you get the chance too."
""
""
"O- The appearance is just so far out of my comfort zone, I can't not penalize it. That said, the taste, smell and mouthfeel were fine, but not stunning in any way. No need to ever try this again, but maybe it's for the connoisseurs."

"Very light pale yellow with ample foamy head. A very sweet and fruity aroma greets you upon pouring. The taste is equally fruity with some spices, and there's a nice crispness to beer. I'm rather new to Belgiums, but as far as I can tell, this one is a keeper."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: A nice BSPA. This is not one I would drink all the time, but certainly one to visit every now and then. Of the Delirium beers, this may be my least favorite, but it is still solid."
"Conclusion: A definite beer to revisit time and time again, a prime example of the style, don't let the fun marketing fool you."
"Great translucent pale golden color. About a finger of head and highly carbonated. Spicy and yeasty smell typical of the Belgians I've had. Slightly sweet and subtle peppery taste followed by a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and lively from the carbonation. At 8.5%, it drinks really easily. I could see myself on the lake in the summertime having one of these."
"O - This is my 200th beer review, and this was a great beer to review for it. Strong, flavorful, and you have no doubt what this beer is. I wouldn't want to have many of these in a sitting, but it is a amazing beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation."
"O: This was pretty damn good, but I was expecting a little more from the pink elephant."
"O: Huge beer on the palate, very enjoyable drinking experience."
"This is a great beer in a really cool bottle. Very complex nose with great even flavors. These guys have been around for over 350 years for a reason. Get this."
"O- May not be your beer if you are not in love with belgian yeast, but i sure am. A complex but yet incredibly drinkable beer"
"Was in J'Town, PA at Tulunes and tried the Delirium Tremens that they have on tap...and unfortunately I dont think their CO2 tank was working properly...The color was clear copper, but absolutely not carbonation or head....a dead beer. The smell included spice, clove and some banana/citrus. The taste had a boost from the ABV, but their was definite spice/clove taste. Mouthfeel sucked since it was a dead beer and the higher ABV did not make this a session. Overall though the flavor and smell was good."
"Spectacular! One of my favorite beers. Beautiful color and wonderful taste. The high carbonation compliments to complex pallet and aromas. If poured correctly, it has an impressive, yet subtle, head. Initially has a sweet and fruity taste, and it closes with a mild hop and bitter taste. Lots of spice and flavor, truly an enjoyable beer!"
"The pour was pale and had quite a head as I expected. The smell was so complex, I didn't know how to describe it. One thing I know is that it did not prepare me for the taste. The taste was very strongly yeasty and that did not sit well with me. There were also clove and fruity hops present, but the yeastiness dominated. That immediately prevented me from enjoying this beer. I do not like yeasty beers, so I can't say anything good about this one. If you don't like a dominating yeasty flavour either, then don't even try this one. If you do, I guess you can give it a try. It was a bit sour, even. Very much not my thing."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I think I prefer this one on draft, which is saying something. Definitely worth trying."
"{slight adjustment based on an on-tap tasting in May 2012}"
"Overall, the beer leaves a good impression, but I believe a bit more maturity would do well for this one."
"Overall: Good blend of refreshing flavors that come together for a sharp and refreshing beer."
"Thanks to my buddy Carl for this coveted sample this one shows a bright pale golden yellow color that is just jumping with speed demon bubbles and a big frothy white head and decent lacing. The aroma is a wheaty, earthy clove, pleasant and likable. The flavor brings apricot banana and a kiss of citrus. Of course there is a clove touch as well. It’s tart and lively in feel with medium body. It’s very drinkable and smooth. A classic."
"My favourite Belgian elephant!"
"I had a bomber of this about a year ago, and I was drunk after. I recommend this beer, but if you get a bomber; make sure you share it."
"Overall: complex beer, excellent yeast character and decently drinkable."
"Mostly clear pale golden color with a torrent of bubbles rushing up from the bottom to form the foamy white head. Orange zest and spicy phenols in the nose. Fruity esters of orange, pineapple, pear, and melon complement the pale sweet malts. Alcohol is well-disguised, and this one can really sneak up on you if you're not careful. Medium-bodied and crisp with an almost champagne-like mouthfeel. Very refreshing."
"This was my first Delirium and I didnt quite know what to expect. It poured a nice golden yellow with about half of a fingers worth of foam, which disipated pretty quickly. They smell was amazing but I had to sniff it several times as I was trying to think of what it smelled like... It came to me that this beer reminded me alot of Hoegarden. But it tasted 2x better than a Hoegarden. In my opinion this is a great beer and I can not wait to hae another."
"It was a fantastic beer that was served in a Delirium Tremens glass but a bit too cold. I had to let it warm and once it did...wow. It has a great mouthfeel and I noticed some cherry flavors and even a bit of hops . It had a long, sweet finish which I loved. I can't stress this enough, this beer needs to be served at almost room temperature in order to really ""taste"" it. I wish that I wouldn't have drank half of the beer before I decided to let it warm. Overall an awesome beer. I may review it higher once I have some more experience with it."
"O - Got better and more complex as it warmed. My bad there as I opened it straight out of the fridge. I can see how some people love this, but it's not for me really."
"Here's another great Belgian beer I should always keep in stock."
"O - Light beer. Banana, sweet nut flavors. Thin, easy to drink!"
"O: A beautiful easy drinking Belgian Strong Pale Ale. World class."
"Overall, this is my favorite version of the style. I like it better than Duvel which seems to grassy for me. This beer is a true classic as far as flavor is concerned."
"Overall, hmmm, it was good but still reflecting on the price of $4.89 a 12 oz. bottle. In that light compared to a Bomber of Chimay Blue they are similarly priced, and Chimay is better. Still it was a nice beer and I wouldn't turn it down, and will buy it again."
"Overall: A good beer but I thought it was kind of expensive for what I got. I had it at 10$ for a pint, if I can get it at 6-8 then I would be more than willing to buy again otherwise I’d rather drink something else!"
"A fantastic beer. This has been in my celar for over 3 year. This brew has been waiting for a honest person to truley make this brew what it is. A great brew a must have.This is a great tasting brew and well worth trying again.This ride is a really nice one."
"O – A great beer, soft and sessionable on the palate."
"At any rate it's a very nice beer and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Belgian ales."
"D: A very tasty and complex Belgian ale. There's a wide array of yeast byproducts that contribute to this flavor profile, which manages to be both vibrantly fruity and characteristically spicy. Another beer I'd just never gotten around to trying, but I'm glad I finally have."
"O: This was a very nice beer. I expected much, and I was not dissapointed."
"O - The funky bottle, little pink elephants, and fantastic smell and taste of this one makes for a beer that delivers on its hype. I can really see why people really like this stuff."
"O: drinkable, and relatively cheap and available. I like all of those things, and it tastes delicious. Certainly a go to if there isn't something else there."
"D - Very drinkable. Light and refreshing but standing at a bold 8.5%."
"O/D: It's a cool looking bottle, but that's the selling point, not the actual beer. Better options out there, for sure."
"The appearance is unfortunately the color of urine! Head falls flat quickly, no lacing. Flavour is a mash up of bannana/grapefruit/spice that misses the mark all around. But somebody's bound to like it!"
"A good score for a Belgian pale ale but not the best you'll ever have. I suspect that some of this beer's cache comes from the odd bottle and the pretty pink elephants on the label. Do you see the pink elephants in your sleep? Has a nice bite and some hammy flavor that bends slightly toward tripel territory; it finishes with a surprising banananess that masks the booze. Worth a bottle but not more."
"D: not sure what wreaked this pour, but not the best looking brew. otherwise, slightly above average aroma and flavor make this a good belgian strong pale, just not great."
"O: Solid Ale from start to finish...will definitely buy again...and again..."
"Overall, a classic and very enjoyable beer. Its downside is that it is very sweet, particularly in smell. I generally prefer Duvel myself, which avoids this, but this is a very nice beer."
"I'm impressed with this one. Lots of excellent flavors rolled into one. The alcohol will catch up to you though. Love the name and the brew."
"This beer pours a light yellow straw color with a decent head, that leaves some lacing around the glass. the smell is yeasty with a nice spiciness to it. the taste follows through with a small amount of sweetness to yeasty spicey flavors of the belgian yeast. the mouthfeel is medium to light, and overall this is a very drinkable beer."
"I understand why people love this beer but it is not my type of brew."
"nice sweet taste. fruity undertones and bit of hops in there. overall it was good - well balanced and drinkable."
"This beer, in my opinion, didn't live up to it's reputation, it was also a little pricey. This one might look better on the shelf."
"O: probably pretty good for the style. a lot different than the Imperial Stouts I drink and review most nights. I could see myself liking this though."
"O: This was a disappointing one for me. Would like to re-review fresh."
"Bright pale blonde, more than one finger of dense white head, lots of lace. Smell is yeasty and floral, nice hoppy presence, fairly clean and grassy, some malt, light alcohol. Taste is clean and vibrant, lots of fruity floral notes here, nice hop kick, some spicy notes, lightly sweet but dry in finish. High carbonation, full body with nice weight, dryish mouthfeel. Very drinkable stuff, one of my favorite strong pale belgians for sure, nice balance."
"O - Delirium Tremens -- although ironically named -- exemplifies the highest qualities of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Everyone should try this (at least) once in their life."
"Overall great, a staple example for the style, great fruits and malts, sweet start hides the booze and dry finish keeps you coming back for more."
"Overall: A solid BSPA - just a little too much abv. coming through in the taste."
"I'm happily suprised by this one. It isn't what I expected, but that's ok with me. That said I can't see myself really coming back for apple cider flavored beer."
"Overall I tend to enjoy this beer thoroughly and was one that got me started into my Belgium Ale craze."
"O: This is a good beer in the bottle, in the US. This is a great beer on tap in Brussels."
"88.5."
"O - This is just a very enjoyable beer that is a good fit for many occasions. Another example of qulaity belgian brewing."
"The beer is medium bodied and crisp with a lot of carbonation, almost like a champagne. At the same time it is an easy beer to drink and leaves you wanting more with each sip."
"For many people Duvel is the standard-bearer for the style, but DT seems more archetypal to my tastes. It is hard to find fault with either, though neither have the depth of flavor of the best examples of the style."
"O- A delicious beer with great flavors and balance. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Lots of carbonation make this beer nice and light easy on the tongue. The alcohol is present but well incorporated. A very solid beer, and I'm glad because it would be depressing if they had such a great label and an inferior product."
"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this at the Delirium bar in Brussels. I can understand why many people consider this the most tasty beer in the world. Unique label, awesome bar, and a delicious taste that goes down smooth. A must buy for any beer drinker."
"While I can appreciate the quality of this brew, it is simply too sweet and fruity a beer for me. In that vein, it is a lot like DFH's Midas Touch. Good to pull a sip or two, but slightly cloying as you get half-way through. If sweet, honey/fruit beers are your thing, give it a try."
"O- Very enjoyable beer. It's extremely drinkable and I would definitely purchase again. A well crafted beer."
"Solid Belgian ale."
"While I tend to stray towards saisons, this is one Belgian strong pale I will come back to year in and year out."
"O: A decent beer but less than I had hoped for, BSPA is not my favorite style...I'd prefer a BSDA or Saison."
"O - Wonderful beer that has maybe a bit more complexity than Duvel, but doesn't have that same champagne style punch and overall consistency that Duvel has."
"O- Not really sure what happened here. Smelled fine, opening taste was great and promising but a very intense alcohol/chemical presence took over and ruined the drink for me. My friend was sharing with me and he noticed the same thing I did. He has had this on tap before and claims it tasted nothing like this. Would definitely like to try another bottle or on-tap in the future."
"Overall a very good beer. Nice but deceptively alcoholic."
"O: It was just ok. Standard belgium pale ale with just more alcohol. I could take it or leave it. Honestly feel its only popular due to bottle artwork and high abv. BUT I will say its one of the best balanced belgium beers I've had."
"D: The first beer I had in Belgium. Not my favorite style, but definitely worth trying."
"T: Green apple, lemon, a bit of white pepper, cloves, and a bit of grass. Really nice and light and way easy to drink for the ABV. Definitely a keeper."
"The beer looks as if it will have a ton of carbonation, but it really doesn’t. As a matter of fact, the beer is quite smooth and has an excellent mouthfeel. Then you are hit again with that summer-citrus thing I was talking about earlier. There is, toward the back of the palate, a subtle change in flavor… but nothing that lasts, or is noticeable to really investigate. Past that, it’s a very drinkable beer that I could enjoy time and time again. (Maybe I just like lemons…)"
"Delicious with lots of bready, yeasty qualities and punctuated with a bit of spices. Some hop notes, especially in the finish. Smooth, creamy and medium bodied. Dry finish leaves you wanting more. Extremely smooth for the high ABV. Hard to believe I like the Nocturnum more, Guess I need to buy one and find out why."
"This pours a yeast cloudy yellowish color which a frofty white head which quickly dissipates and doesn't leave much lacing. The smell is nice, it has that Belgium aroma, its kind of sweet and pleasant. Very nice mouthfeel medium to light thickness with bubbly carbonation. The taste is pretty good, it has that fruity / musty belgium taste which good with a strong aftertaste. Overall a pretty tasty beer, but I've had better."
"D-A pretty hefty beer. I like it a lot, but I only want one every few months, and one at a sitting. A filling, satisfying beer."
"D: Not bad might benefit with aging."
"Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head that bubbles away quickly. Malty in the nose with a hint of coriander. Frothy flavor with lots of citrus and some of that coriander flavor coming through in the background. Smooth and somewhat sweet with just a hint of spice. I am not a big fan of lots of coriander, but I think that this one does it well, not too in your face and rounds the beer off nicely."
"D/O- Real good beer here but for my money I'd choose something else. Definitely worth trying if you have not, if only for the name."
"I doubt I will regularly purchase it, as there are beers that I like as much or better, that are much cheaper. But I'm very glad I sampled it. Easily my favorite from Belgium thus far."
"Picked up a bottle at the Hipercot in Barcelona. A welcome find for Spain Chilled briefly in ice and poured into a cognac glass. Nice one inch of head and mold lacing. Brilliant yet cloudy gold color. Very inviting pale ale hops and wheat and sweet smell. Tastes very much like one of my other favorite strong pale ales judas nut is more complex and it's fruitiness overshadows the high ABV. Mouthfeel is still light to medium bodied and overall a very fine example of Belgian pale ale."
"Medium bodied with lots of harsh tight carbonation and strong alcohol flavor which hurts the mouthfeel. Lots of zesty spice with hints of pepper and coriander dominate the front end and linger over the earthy hop notes, pale malt and sweet boozy heat into a dry finish. The alcohol is much stronger in this beer than I remember. Really hot for it's ABV with warmth in the finish. This takes away from the pleasant light fruit notes and earthy, grassy notes. Underneath the spice and alcohol there are hints of apple, pear, banana and bubblegum. I used to really like this beer but now find it astringent and one dimensional. I'll have to revisit in another few years."
"No clue why I have waited so long to try this beer but perhaps I'm not sold on bottle design. But clearly this beer is all about what's inside. Pored a straw yellow clear color with a bit less carbonation than I was expecting. Thin lace around the rim but no retention. Slightly tart grapes and peaches and a lovely yeasty aroma that is as well balanced in the nose as I can imagine of any Belgian pale. Slight straw and browned grass at the front followed by a stringent and slightly bitter aftertaste. crisp fruit and subdued slickness and mixed in well with a lovely tart finish. This oozes perfection and I can't wait to have another one."
"Overall: A highly drinkable beast!"
"O: Traditional Belgian strong pale ale. Great Beer!"
"D - This turned out to be a truly exciting beer for me. It was unlike any other Belgian Strong Pale ale, and it really drank well. The peculiar label isn't all that this beer has to offer! Highly recommended!"
"O: This is decent beer, I don't really care for some of the finishing flavors but it can be a value buy. But don't pay more than 10 bones for a bottle of it."
"The mouthfeel is full, gritty, prickly, and slick. The beer isn't heavy, but rather substantial; you know that you're not drinking a light beer. Overall, this is one of my favorite examples of the style."
"I enjoyed this however immediately upon opening the bottle the contents fizzed everywhere. Immediately I am thinking I got a skunked bottle. Date on the back is FAR from today's date yet the smell is not quite as I have read in the user reviews or the bro's reviews and is still pleasing compared to most, but not close to what I have read. Definitely does not stand out to me. Will have to rebuy and retry, but still a b+/a-"
"Fruity with nice bready notes. Not overly sweet, very palatable."
"I enjoy this beer. I'm not convinced it has benefited from the extended aging, but it is still a great beer after 2+ years in the bottle. It is certainly a readily available Belgian strong ale that newcomers to the style could begin with, but it is complex (and tasty) enough for more experienced drinkers to enjoy."
"Found this on tap at the Yardhouse and the beer poured relatively light in color, with a nice head that hung around. Could smell the banana but not any dark fruit I was expecting. It went down easy for a strong beer, but I was looking for more complex fruit flavors- that being said it is a light refreshing beer that will hit you hard if you have too many."
"D - Very drinkable for the ABV."
"I will return but not the best I've tasted."
"This beer pours a bright yellow color, with a large lacing head. The smell was a bit weak, and a bit offensive, there were some spices noticeable. The taste was complex, lots of different spices interacting. The flavor could have been a bit stronger, and I felt the carbonation was a bit fizzy. Overall a good beer, enjoyable, but I feel it could be better."
"D: Although it's really hard to detect the alcohol, this beer is very dry, so it's not something I could drink bottle after bottle."
"O - a good BSPA to have as a treat every now and then."
"Final remarks: I'm a bit surprised at the generally high ratings for this beer. I absolutely adore Duvel, but this is nowhere near the same quality with regard to aroma or taste. I will have to review this again under different circumstances and see if it can make a better impression on me. The one redeeming quality of D.T. is that the alcohol is virtually undetectable, making this a very easy drinker and an extremely dangerous brew!"
"The mouthfeel is just average and isn`t quite dry enough for my taste. It is, however, very creamy so this makes up for it a little. Overall, a great beer. I`ll be buying it again for sure."
"O- this is a beer that I crave on tap. It I really don't think that it is nearly as good in bottles."
"Great beer!"
"Pale straw color, generous white head. Aromas of biscuit and dough. Flavor is nice, big bready malt with a light fruit to the finish. Very clean and dry, excellent mouthfeel. Carbonation is very fine & mellow, smooth & crisp. Well crafted beer, I prefer the Nocturnum though."
"This brew had a great taste aroma was sweet and the alcohol there but subtle. Great beer on a hot day. Great beer on a cold day. This beer is actually a great beer as long as your alive. Sweet smell, and a little settling that coats a glass. The beer has something to it maybe that is why it has a pink elephant on it???"
"O: This is a great example of a brewer doing something that’s overdone in a way that hasn’t been done. I always used to think that the Belgian SPA style was a fairly limited sect, but Brouwerij Huyghe has really shown me that there is a lot of give in this class of brews. For some purists, this may be too different for them to like, but this is by far my favorite Belgian SPA. And for me, I feel it will be very hard to beat."
"O: The smell is a bit hard to extract, but the taste is amazing. Definitely a great one if one is looking to get into the belgian strong pale style."
"A tasty brew in a fun bottle...though I believe I first had this on tap at Monk's in Philly, PA, where it is generally a draught staple. Pours straw yellow, slightly hazy, with a small white head, and some noticeable carbonation. Yeast and some light fruits in the nose. Light fruits on the palate, with grassy hops in the background leaving a little bitter aftertaste. Pretty light mouthfeel, but not too crisp. Drinkable, but not something I prefer when other options are available."
"Awesome brew, i know there isnt a drinkability section anymore, but this one drinks like a 5%, and it's 8.5%, very clean crisp and great tasting."
"O: sort of a staple for the style. I have had this years ago and passed it over for a while. Not much has changed with it since I last remember. Tasty and a go to for the style"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall - I'm happy I had a chance to try this one on tap. The bartender really had a hard time pouring it as it would keep foaming over.. so I'm not sure if that threw the mouthfeel off at all. Anyways, it's a must try beer."
"O: Overall I'd say this is a very nice beer. I don't have anything to say other than it's good and I'd buy it again if looking for a quality Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"the only bad thing is it cost around 8 Dollars a beer in Chicago"
"Overall: Great strong taste and balance. Up there with the best Belgian ales."

"O - This stuff is incredibly tasty and far surpassed my expectations. Definitely highly recommended to any fan of Belgian Pale Ale's and I will definitely be picking up a bottle next time I'm at the local shop. The ABV is incredibly well hidden, making it extremely drinkable and dangerous."
"Not what I was expecting. I was thinking it would be darker. Small head wad around for the whole consumption. Massive amounts of floral and citrus. Spices, cloves and sweets. Taste was the same. Really acidic but seems to work well here. Mouthfeel was well balanced. One of the better Belgian beers I have had in the last couple of days."
"Overall one of the best Belgian strong pales I've had. Nothing is overdone and I really love the taste. The flavors are strong enough yet don't way down the palate."
"Overall its a good beer- its like Duvel, but not quite there."
"Pours a clear golden with a good amount of off white foam head, served in a Delirium Tremens tulip. Nose was bright Belgian yeast, musty, light fruits - typical Belgian Pale. Taste was light fruits, wine like at first chilled but more complex as it warmed. Similiar to the nose. Prickly carbonation, medium bodied. Overall an enjoyable Belgian Pale - glad to be able to try it on tap."
"Still overall there is flavor and good enjoyment to be had in this beer. It's real easy drinking for this style for sure."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a pale yellow body with fizzy white head which disappears quickly. The aroma is almost of white wine with some fruit notes. The taste is fruity and almost like white wine, it has a nice start to the taste but a little sour on the back of the tongue. It has a nice mouth feel and is very drinkable. This is my first real belgian beer so i really enjoyed it."
"O- It's ok, the huge chunks were a bit of a turnoff. I found that it wasn't nearly as complex as a lot of the great Belgians."
"Overall: This beer is not bad, but I'd select another style. It's a bit better than a home brew version a friend of mine shared with me a couple of weeks ago."
"D- given the high abv. This brew is highly drinkable and pretty good."
"Obviously a classic, but still surprises in its unique character. Haven't had anything like it and will certainly enjoy it again."
"O: A all around good brew, the character is pleasant and floral, but would like to see this this beer have a bit more dry mouthfeel."
"O- A good BSPA, but not my favorite in the style. Definitely worth a try, but just being so fruit heavy, it's just not quite as spice balanced as I'd like."
"Overall. Not bad. Probably wouldn't buy again, but not too shabby tasting."
"Over all this beer is very drinkable. Despite its complexity it is not overwhelming. I would strongly recommend this Belgian Ale."
"O: A great example of the style. Easy to drink or to savor, as it warms more complexity comes out. Its a really nice beer, but not something I want to drink everyday."
"O - simply excellent; WAY TOO EASY to drink and enjoy"
"D: It's a fast drinker for the alcohol level, but I'm not sure that this beer offers enough in the flavor department, especially when considered in its style, to make me want to pick it up again."
"Overall, very refreshing and very complex. A fine example of the style."
"D: delicious. If the mark of a good beer is how many one can drink in a sitting, this beer deserves an A+, I already crave for more."
"Dr: WAY too expensive for the quality. It's not 6.85 Euro (this is in Ireland) good, but it's worth a go for fans of the style. Hides its ABV absurdly, dangerously well."
"The CPJ"
"D - alcohol creeps up on you as you go through the bottle; very nice and easy to drink"
"Poured a light amber with a small white fizzy head that dissapated rapidly and had fair lacing. The aroma was light of bread like malts. a piney hop and a sweet yeast with mild notes of bannana's and citrus. It tasted light and slightly astringent at first and finished lightly bitter with a hint of bannana and a mild alcohol flavor that lingered on the palate for a while. Mouthfeel was very light in body and watery in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a nice begian ale that has a mild kick to it."
"BTW, I had it Bill's Bar & Burger on 51st Street. The burgers are some of the best in NYC, and the beer list is pretty strong. They could however, improve upon their draft offerings. If you are in the neighborhood, check it out; just avoid the mid week lunch time crush. You'll wait forever."
"My experience went a little south from there. I will straight away say that I am not a fan of Belgian pale ales. The first sip gives you a good taste of citrus fruit and honey. The last was surprising in the best way possible. What I didn't like is the bitterness. A little too much for me and that made me feel uncomfortable. I could not have had more than the one. I still think that this ale was a good surprise."
"This is among the worlds best and interesting beers. It's a must try and a personal favorites - tap or bottle."
"D- Dangerously drinkable with nothing less than a triple taste for a strong pale ale alcohol content to tell you differently."
"Overall: A very good beer from a brewery I'm not going to bother trying to spell. I might keep a few more of these around and I'm glad that the owner of Four Winds in Pensacola insisted that I buy a bottle of his favorite after seeing the rest of what I purchased."
"Overall solid and very drinkable..."
"Delirium Tremens was golden in color and cloudy with lots of sediment floating about. It had a large rocky white head with good retention and left a little lacing. The smell was fruity yeast with some spices. The taste was fruit, yeast, candi sugar, and plenty of spices. The finish was long, dry, and a bit alcoholic. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium-high carbonation that was a little creamy. The drinkability was very good. This is a fine Belgian Ale that I recommend."
"Overall just solid as could be. Love the style and it was super drinkable. Nothing at all to complain about here."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a three finger off white head in my Deliruim glass. The smell is very fruity- apple/pear. It's pretty muted vs. the taste however. The taste is really fantastic, and seems to change slightly w/ each sip. This is a great Beligian, and one I've had many times. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is off the charts. I could have several of these. Great beer, and I'll continue to pick this up and enjoy this one."
"Delirium Tremens is a fantastically balanced and flavorful beer. This BSPA can surely be appreciated by both newbies and craft beer veterans alike."
"D: It's alright, the sweetness is a bit much at times."
"D: This is a great beer. I had heard a lot about it and am happy to say that it lives up to the hype"
"D - Overall a very good strong golden. I particularly enjoyed the second pour with the stronger phenols and spices that the addition of the yeast provided."
"As many have said, this beer is deceivingly easy to drink."
"It's easy enough to drink but the difficulties with getting a clean pour from the opaque bottle mean that I'm less likely to pick this up again versus some of the other examples of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"D. Very drinkable. Nice beer to enjoy on a hot day. Alcohol is well hidden, and it goes down easy. Pretty sweet beer."
"D- The sweetness might be a little too much, but the beer is still pretty damn drinkable."
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the complexity. We've certainly had this brew before, but it leaves the drinker curious. The heavy malt character of the taste, coupled with the contrasting flavors therein, moving between sweet, sour, and bitterness, make for a unique brew, with a considerably open reading frame."
"On tap into pint glass or bottle into a snifter glass. Pours a yellow-brown body, cloudy, topped with a big, creamy head of white--fully lasting, sheets and rings of lace. Aroma is earthy, grassy, lemon, clove, coriander, a delicate fruitiness. The palate is medium-full with creamy carbonation. Flavor is lightly sweet with sugar and clove, lightly sour with lemon, clove and a long, lightly hopped finish. The finish is woody, laced with clove, balanced, apple cider. Crisp and refreshing brew. A classic here."
"D: High cost and high ABV lead me to say this is nice-drinking ""treat"" beer."
"D: It's so tasty with dry fruit notes that you don't taste the alcohol. Much caution needs to be given to this brew as it's strong on the alcohol side. I could drink this beer every night."
"Verdict - I enjoyed sipping this slowly and would definitely purchase it again. It is a sophisticated, crisp, light champagne tasting ale."
"5/10"
"Spices in the olfactory flavors, including dill and spices from Provence. The flavor is round, with a mouth full and warm alcoholic which leaves the aftertaste of bitterness with that presence always spicy where it collects a few grains of pepper. It also receives a key that gives a sweet finish more or less syrupy. Very good duivelbier, probably the best direct rival of Duvel from Moortgat."
"Not sure what the packaging is all about - the faux ceramic is an interesting touch, though query what it does to flavor after prolonged periods. The glass is an oddity as well, with its elephants and whatnot, though I guess it's all part of the overall experience. Once you get past all the pomp, the ale pours a nice golden color with a thick head that holds well and laces even better. The first sip provides a bursting cocktail of fruit flavors with strong honey and mild pepper. Good creamy carbonation. The alcohol is hidden nicely in the sweet maltiness so be careful, it packs a wallop. A bit too sticky sweet for my taste, but fine for those who prefer that. Overall, a solid ale for its type."
"Great tasting beer. Very nice color, but appearance was hurt by the large pieces of sediment. I don't mind sediment in my beer but these pieces where quite large."
"Its light brew but too sweet for me and being that its the same price as an Allagash I don't think ill have againm anytime soon"
"I think 12oz of this is good for a session. I don't think I would want to do a bomber of this on my own, only for sharing. A great example of the style and one of my favorites from Belgium on special occasions."
"I had somewhat the same feeling from drinking DT on draft but enjoyed it more. It's frutier than Duvel and a little sweeter but a very good Belgian pale ale. Great carbonation and aroma."
"Overall, veyr good beer that lived up to expectations."
"Drinkability- highly drinkable"
"At first I thought this was a gimmick with the high alcohol and pink elephants on the label, but it's actually quite good. Despite it's ABV, it is light tasting and highly drinkable. If you can find out, pick it up."
"This is a great, but unique, Belgian Strong Golden Ale. It has great drinkability and goes great with a burger."
"Wow, an amazing beer. My girlfriend doesn't really care for beer but she loves this one. It's not to sweet and you sometimes forget that it's a beer. Its a little more expensive but with an ABV of 8.50% you really wont need as many as you would have of regular beer."
"I have to revise my review a little. It seems to me this beer isn't quite what it used to be. I loved this beer but it has proven to be way to difficult to find a good bottle without great big floating particles and a bitter bite that shouldn't be there. When I first started drinking this beer, the color was a deep amber color. Now I'm noticing they are a much more pale yellow color, and the taste has changed also, but not for the better. It's a shame because this was one of my favorites. They gotta get back in the game with this beer, it seems like they're slacking here!"
"Extremely similar to Duvel, this BSPA has its own unique profile. It's a bit spicier and not quite as smooth. Has expected yeast and citrus notes. The aroma is fruity and a bit earthy. There is also pepper and citrus in the nose. It goes down quite easy with the only drawback being a slight thinness."
"M, D- Mouthfeel medium-light, smooth. The ABV adds to the substantial feel. CO2 a bit lively."
"Glad that I finally decided to throw some of these classic, ubiquitous Belgians in the closet for a few years. Every one that I've had with some time on it has been fantastic and a little bit better than previously. The flavors in this beer are particularly well-integrated and downright loveable."
"Brouwerij Huyghe's beers seem to add an unexpected funk to classic belgian styles. In the case of Delirium Tremen's the fruit flavors and yeast funk are dominant, where as Duvel is more balanced. Delirium may not be perfect but it's imperfections make it interesting and make drinkers think twice about imbibing classics such as Duvel and Chimay. Delirium Tremens is dangerously delicious it's hard to consume just one glass of it and two or three will put you in your own personal Delirium."
"Even if you're not a big fan of pale ale's I still suggest you give this beer a shot."
"P.S. this beer is noticeably better on tap than in a bottle. But it would change my answer to the stuck on the island question."
"Definitely one of the best beer ever."
"D- easy to drink my half of this bottle. this is a pretty solid example of a style i often overlook. ill be happy to check this one out again. i think i liked the bottle version better than the on tap one, which is rare for me."
"A light gold brew with a bit of white lace clinging to the sides of the glass. Nice fluffy head that has some good staying power. There are clumps of stuff swimming in the glass. A living beer. Smell is peppery with a honeyed malt and yeasty fruitiness. Apples and grapes are a feature. Taste is wonderful. More like a tripel than a BSPA. That being said it does fall a bit short of the tripel standard in its malt core. The honey/sugar notes are not as big. To move on to what is there I must confess a real love of the balance in the blend. Malt is sweet with honey and cupcake batter. Pepper with a coriander like spiciness. Some clove and banana but not hefe like. A subtle blend of the two. Apples and grapes from the nose are here. Finish is nicely hopped with herbal notes and a dry clean edge. Feel is medium with a creamy carbonation and supple fluidity. So drinkable so tasty so good you just go through the bottle in an instant. Beware as the high abv is just nowhere to be found."
"An outstanding beer well worth cellaring."
"Saw this beer on Three Sheets back a few years ago, and I finally got around to trying it two years ago. Flat out, may be the best beer I've ever had. I know it was voted that once, but I don't usually pay attention to things like that. It is a truly unique, especially from any macro-brew. It is clearly not for everyone, so take my review for what its worth. Words cannot describe this beer, it is one you have to try for yourself."
"Feels good in the mouth, and is very drinkable."
"D: Like I said, a beer to savor. The large portion size and the higher ABV don't lend this beer to be consumed in mass quantities (nor does it's price) but this is a fantastic, delicious beer that MUST be savored like a fine scotch."
"Drink one and be happy with it"
"Impression: Yet another excellent beer from Belgium, home to some some fine brewing magic."
"Pours a hazy, darker golden hue with a noticeable amount of carbonation flowing up to the top of the glass. Nice, fluffy white head with good retention. Smells of apples, fresh pears, yeast and some spicy aromas. It has a very balanced and fresh taste, a touch of sweetness at first, some noticeable yeast character throughout the sip, combined with some ripe, fruity notes and just a touch of alcohol with a slight spicy aftertaste. Overall, a nice light to medium bodied brew, a bit intense on the carbonation, and a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A fresh and flavorful beer that I could session if I could afford it.."
"Drinkabilty - Its pretty smooth and esay going down but its a little weak and too yeasty for me. I prefer the bitter bite of nocturnum moreso. However, this is easier to drink but still its 8.5% alcohol so 1 or 2 is enough."
"Tasted much like the smell, a little bland, I generally thought it wasn't the best mix in flavour. Did a good job of masking the actual ABV."
"On tap at this year's Christmas party! Thanks Kirk! Pours a clear golden color..this beer could easily be mistaken for a bud light or coors to the naked eye. Once you get a whiff of it though, you know this is no BMC! The aroma is slightly funky with some amazing yeasty, spicy flavors with lemon zest. The taste is VERY lemony with great additions of coriander, pepper, banana, and delicious Belgian yeast flavors. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied, yet crisp with a bitter hoppy finish. Drinkability is fairly high. Good Belgian Pale!"
"keep an eye out for those pink elephants they can hurt you if you let them"
"D: Amazing, but not for everyone. If you want something spectacular or perhaps mild-blowing, this is it. Alcohol warmth will occur and fast. The sweetness is the only thing holding this back from being a much more drinkable beer. Sip and savor this delicious monster!"
"D-Very drinkable, the sweetness masks the fact that it's whipping your ass at 8.5%, drink with caution"
"drinkability; the alcohol is certainly well hidden and this beer is supreme, definitely an easy drink when taken slow and respectfully, drink too fast and this beer can be a little nasty, well one just might be going to bed early."
"I AM A BIG FAN OF THE NOCTURNUM. NOW AFTER DRINKING THE THE TREMONS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY OTHER THAN WOW. MY FAVORITE PART IS THE SMELL, THE HEAD ON THIS BEER IS AMAZING. DEFINITELY NOT AS SMOOTH AS THE NOCTURNUM, I WOULD SAY IT DESERVES JUST AS MUCH APPRECIATION. IN THE END THIS IS ONE TASTY BEER."
"D. A nice brew lots of flavors, and great texture. This would have been an A+ but I just didn't care for the appearance."
"Drinks better than delirium noel but not by much. The appearance just takes away too much because frankly, it looks nasty. Blindfolded would be the best way to drink beers from this brewery as far as I can tell, in which case I would agree with all the high ratings. Other bottle conditioned beers don't look so terrible, even if you don't pour carefully and get some sediment in there. Why the chunks?"
"The mouthfeel was an extremely pleasant milkiness. I felt satisfied with the volume contained within one bottle but I enjoyed every last drop."
"Mouthfeel is dry and carbonation is high, it has a very champagne like quality. It suits it very well. A great beer."
"D- this is delicious and dangerously drinkable. The abv is deceptive. I will buy this again but unfortunnately it will be in a bottle next time."
"Easy to enjoy but a fairly high abv. Another solid Belgian."
"A brilliant brew. My first experience with this beer was during the Belgium Beer Festival in 2005, and it has been one of my favorites ever since. At first pour, it appears somewhat cloudy with light particulates, and a benign but pleasant smell; however, once it hits your tongue, it is a pleasure to behold. A complex mix of fruit/malt flavors hit the palate, and joyfully dance from front to back to one of the smoothest finishes I've yet discovered. The aftertaste leaves your mouth watering for another drop of this ambrosia. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - This beer has a nice spot in my world! its a solid beer with a great rating. I am told its on tap in Ottawa now, SpinRSX and I will have to hunt it down and give our review!"
"I really enjoyed this one; glad I tried it. Although next time, I think I'll head back to my trusty Duvel. But this is a close second."
"1/2 finger white head quick dissipation with minimal if any lacing, the glass could have used a quick rinse before pouring. Light gold clear body, multiple streams of carbonation. Nose is dominated by the yeast, some coriander notes, a bit of floral hops, but not much fruity esters, perhaps a bit of lemon but not much. Taste mirrors nose, surprised how how un-fruity this was. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly above average effervescence, some stickiness but a really, really dry finish. Pretty drinkable, though in retrospect I'll have a Duvel next time. Wondering how this compares to the bottled version."
"D- this beer is excellent. I drank a whole 750mL to myself and could have drank more."
"The beer is a mostly clear orange with a huge cap of foam that stretches past the apex of the glass and comes to a point, resembling a snowy mountain top. The aroma is of citrus, Belgian yeast, and alcohol. Delirium Tremens is a good beer, but not a great one. The flavor is more forward than the aroma, with ripe citrus fruits, spices, clove, and alcohol. I find the alcoholic aspect to be too prominent. I would prefer the potency of this brew to be disguised in a bouquet of hops and/or Belgian yeast. The feel is medium bodied, with a warming finish. One of the most easily attainable Belgian beers in the United States, and one that I often see on draft. I'm sure I'll be drinking this again at some point."
"First I love the packaging. The beer itself is amazing. The three yeast strains used come together to create creamy, well balance mouth feel. It has an aroma of citrus and spice which is quite pleasant. The flavors and aroma synergy really make this an A++ beer for me."
"light to medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. very drinkable."
"Having given DT two tries I will leave it to others to enjoy!"
"Pours a nice golden color with a bit of peach coloring and a nice white head that leaves behind a really nice dose of lacing. The nose is quite fruity and spicy with some light pepper plus peach, sweet malt, light stone fruits, and a bit of Belgian yeast. Taste is equally as complex and really just melds some tropical, citrus, and stone fruits together really well and adds in a touch of booze. Nice feel. Drinks quite well and is always a bit nostalgic for me."
"The light and sweet mouthfeel masks the 8.5% ABV and the gassiness gave me a bad case of the hiccups. Each hiccup left me with a taste of bananas. While it's no secret I'm not a fan of Belgian-style beers, I have found others I've enjoyed (Victory Golden Monkey). This beer is not one I would recommend if you're not a big fan of the style."
"D- Clean, crisp, complex and refreshing. Very lively and vibrant with sweet and citrus fruits driving through. Very drinkable."
"D- Smooth. Wouldn't mind drinking it again."
"Very drinkable, but watch the ABV."
"The cork on the bottle popped to the ceiling when I opened the bottle. It poured a clear medium yellowish color with a one finger white head. The smell was of various fruits and spice. This beer had a crisp and clean feel and was highly drinkable. It is one of my favorites."
"D- Significantly more drinkable than most Belgians, I can have more than just 1. This is really, really good Belgian beer."
"Pours bright clear yellow with a dense white head that leaves no lacing. The aroma is sharp and slightly vinegary. The flavor is highly fruity, with apricot, lemon, allspice, peach. The mouthfeel is thin and extremely prickly. Wish it had more substance."
"The color of this beer is a golden color. Has a fizzy head that mellows to a slightly creamy head. Smells like a belgian trippel. Malty with a hint of candi sugar. The taste is very sweet and fizzy. The alcohol shines through very slightly. It is a drinkable beer."
"D- This is a fantastic beer. This is one that you really don't want to share. Great Belgian."
"D- couldn't imagine a friday evening without it... tasty beer that has some serious strength."
"M/D - smooth, nothing to write home about. Nothing offensive or notable about it. For a SBPA, I find that there are better options at this price point, but always a solid goto and it isn't odd to see it as an option at a restaurant or a bar."
"Mouthfeel is medium-thin and smooth with a lively carbonartion. Tremens has big aroma and flavor, and is very drinkable. Easily surpasses my experience with the Nocturnum."
"Definitely a very drinkable and recommended Belgian classic here. I could drink this all day....but definitely wouldn't because it would get dangerous really fast!"
"Time to revisit one of my initial forays into international craft beer. It pours a clear golden straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, banana, clove, and ginger. The taste holds notes of banana, lemon zest, clove, rye bread (nearly a sourdough), and a light sprinkling o' black pepper. The body is a sorta hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice brew, just as good as I remember it being. Now I've gotta re-grab the other Deliriums..."
"Notes: All in all it is a good brew, the style and how the fruity profile come together might not be my thing, and in some circles it is slightly over-hyped, in particular if one thinks of other offerings out there. But all in all it is a good brew."
"This beer was a nice golden color with a bit of white foam sprinkling the surface. The smell was mainly of bananas and clove like would be assumed with the Belgian beers. In addition to that there was the strong aroma of white grapes. The taste was fruity mostly green apple, pineapple, honey, banana, and clove. The taste is familiar as a sweet white wine would be, similar to a Riesling. The mouthfeel is light and crisp as would be appropriate with the delicate flavors that abound. This is a nice very easily drinkable beer, that will sneak up on you because of it's deceptive lightness and high ABV. Overall it's a very nice beer."
"Ok so the price is semi high at 11 bones, eh not too bad, but everyone should drink at least one, or every one of Delirium."
"Overall a very nice version of the style anc certainly worth a try, especially if you can find it on tap."
"I will say that I enjoy this more than the Nocturnum. Solid ""good"" across the board for me."
"Easily one of my favorite beers due to all of the sensations that this beer appeals to. From the bottle to the body, Tremens has a great aesthetic that makes you want to drink it. That temptation is rewarded with a seducing nose and addicting taste. Drinking this is a great experience and I am glad it was my gateway into better beer."
"D - I'm torn on this. It's a good beer but I couldn't do too many based on the ABV. The beer is good but lacks depth."
"Overall, this is a good beer. The style is still one I am becoming familiar with but I enjoyed this beer. Its definitely worth a try."
"This is a very good beer and should be enjoyed by all."
"D: Strong flavors and strong carbonation. It only works well if the beer is made exquisitely and this beer unfortunately has some problems. It's still a very good and refreshing drink that I like more than my rating indicates, but the strong but dull flavor, along with the aggressive carbonation make this beer kind of a chore to drink."
"There is way more head on this beer than any beer I know of but the flavor is wounderful. I will get this one again."
"Poured an opaque golden color, some suspended particles. Huge creamy-white, pillowy head. Smell is very spicy and tart. Also some good malt overtones coming through. Taste is super citrusy with a lot of bite on the back end. The head lends to a very nice feel to the brew, because it's a little thin. Bitter finish. Overall, a good beer, but not one I'd pick up regularly."
"Because your palate always stays clean, each drink is like the first so it never gets old. It's pretty high in alcohol, but you never get the warming feeling so you never realize how strong the beer really is. Truly a world classic."
"D: An all-around solid brew and one of the more available quality beers. A nice intro to the style, but not quite top-tier."
"A great Belgian Trippel with a high alcohol content at about 8.5%. Exactly what one would expect from a traditional belgian ale, very spicy and unique yet full bodied and strong. Additionally, it comes in a very cool white ceramic bottle.. A great beer to start exploring belgian beers with!"
"D - a very nice blend of flavours, the alcohol blends very well, a case of the whole is greater than the sum of the parts as this is very very drinkable over all"
"Weak on flavor, high on carbonation, not a great example of the style."
"The smell is not unpleasant but also not very inviting. A kind of dry smell. The taste is also somewhat dry (which comes after the first sips) with yeastnotes. I have had better strong pale ales from Belgium."
"D=This is a world class perfect brew, I couldn't be more pleased,where can I get a keg?I can't find one thing bad to say about this unique presentation of brewing skill.I can't wait to taste this beer again."
"In the glass the beer's deep powerful headiness is there for all to feel. A clear golden colour with a blitzkreig of bubbles support a level modest layer of foam. To start its acidity really sparkles and fizzes. Rich and ridiculously potent, almost like a hallucinogenic though obviously lacking the fine polish of Duvel. Heavier and more cloying as well. Wasn't long before I was ridiculously famished. And wasn't long before I was off for a mushroom slice at a BP garage."
"This is an excellent Strong Belgian Pale Ale."
"This a good Belgian strong ale, though not as tasty as I expected."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink but there's no way I would have more than one of these in a sitting given its alcohol content."
"Drinkabilty was avergae, duvel is simply better, enough said, taste was too intense, compared to duvel, this stuff just isn't as good. Too many foreign flavours"
"D: Great beer and very easy to drink. Would love to get more of these."
"12oz bottle, courtesy of Amanti Vino's Beer of the Month club, poured into my Duvel tulip. The beer pours a somewhat dull goldenrod, closer to clear than cloudy, though not entirely translucent. A strong pour leads to a voluminous, creamy and frothy white cap. Head retention is above average, but lacing is subpar for a BSPA. The nose is mostly sweet, grassy and pale fruit (apples and pears) malts. There's just a hint of spice, which isn't quite enough in my book. Fortunately Delirium Tremens' flavor allows a bit more of the yeast influence to shine through, with some pepper and clove being the most appreciable. All the requisite parts are in place for a phenomenal Belgian Strong Pale Ale (at least as far as flavor goes), but for some reason the result is just a little bit short of that. One area where the brewery nailed it though is the mouthfeel, there's enough heft in the body without crossing the line into being too viscous and thick, and the carbonation is invigorating and exciting without seeming fizzy in any way. That, along with a solid (but not top notch) taste makes Tremes quite quaffable, especially with the alcohol not really shining through. Delirium Tremens is a more than passable Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but falls short of ""all time classic"" status"
"Cheers..."
"Drinkablity is great on this beer. Almost session worthy but not just quite. Rated A- ? Wasn't this the top rated beer in the world at one point? Bravo."
"In the mouth it is... wow! It's pretty light, but thick enough to keep the rigorous carbonation to a reasonable level of softness. Peach, tropicals, light florals, and a very interesting sour twang gives it great depth. Very well balanced and extremely easy drinking. Fantastic."
"Tasting notes: goes well with pesto pizza."
"D- Very refreshing beer. Alcohol is not very noticeable, but it is slightly warming. I can see how this would creep up on you after two or more though."
"D-little off tasting with the veggie flavor but otherwise okay. I might pass on this next time."
"Quarter pint at The Black Dog Pub in Bayfield, ON. Yellow gold in colour with a thin ring of bubbly white head and dots of lacing on the tulip. Smell and taste are sweet bubble gum, baking dough, yeast esters, ethanol, melon fruit, clove, orange peel, pie crust, Fuzzy Peaches, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick, peppery, strong spiciness, somewhat sour, boozy astringency to finish. A pleasant, drinkable strong ale, but not the most layered or rewarding example of the style. Still, it's worth a go if you can find it on tap."
"D-pretty tasty brew, shows the alcohol a little, lots of sweetness and fruit flavors with a good big of yeast and malt backbone. the peppery spice adds some balance amongst a moderate hop bitterness."
"Cloudy golden in color with a huge 3 finger head, which I had to sip from the top to prevent overflow due to my bad pour. It has a very sweet malt and fruit scent which leans toward plantains. It has a spicy pepper, yet sweet citrus taste with a generous amount of yeast present. It is incredibly smooth, refreshing and could be an everyday beer for me. I allow my wife to take a sip from each of my beers and this is one of the few in which she gave a nod of approval."
"This was very easy to drink, I was a little disappointed in the head and thought the taste was a bit too watery. But overall a pretty good choice."
"Overall a great BSPA. I've had this on tap before and I enjoyed it even more, but its still definitely one I would recommend to someone who is new to Belgians."
"D - for me not so much a everyday beer but the next time i go to the beach i may grab a couple of these"
"Drinkability: Refreshing and very sessionable beer."
"D: A powerful brew at 8.5% ABV but so solid drinking. A really nice blend of fruity malts, spicy hops and the classic Belgian yeast strain palate complex. Very drinkable, very tasty; just might make you see the pink elephant after a few."
"Had on tap at Bier Markt in Toronto. Poured into branded Delirium tulip. Pale orange colour with nice white head with great lacing and retention. Smell of Belgian yeast with a mild fruitiness and bread with some spices. Taste has mild bitterness, but very crisp. I seemed to get a bit tired of drinking this by the end of the glass, but I still did have a couple because friends didn't like this and I couldn't let it go to waste!"
"D- This is a very drinkable beer and the ABV can easily get away from you if you're not paying attention."
"High carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Somewhat understated flavor with prominent banana, pepper, and a hint of caramel on the dry finish. Very light, dry, and easy-drinking. The ABV is well-masked and can really sneak up on you."
"Pours a straw yellow mixed with orange hue into a tasting glass. Head retention is pretty good it never recedes to a collar, bubbles are always present. Smell is yeasty with a light pear peach character. Taste is really nice, pear with pepper and some other fruit in here as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and viscous nit as watery as I thought it would be. Overall this is a really nice beer and I like it a lot. I will definitely be able to finish the bomber by myself."
"D-the alcohol is noticeable as a warming effect and not really in the flavor, but for me it's not a style that I can drink a lot of because my mouth becomes drier as the bottle becomes empty"
"Notes: Annoyed with the packaging. Isn't the ""painted"" bottle enough? Do you really need foil too? The bottles are much more complex than the draft, but still it's not that exciting of a beer. Lots of gimmick + a decent beer = high scores and lots of demand. Not my favorite BPA."
"A very good BSPA. Not the best I've had, but good. I'd get it in a bar, but I doubt I'll spring for another bottle. Maybe it's better in its own pink elephant glass. Recommended for fans of the style."
"D: Look. This is a good beer. But there are lots and lots and lots of better ones. I've heard a lot about this beer from a lot of different people and let me tell you straight -- it doesn't live up to the hype. This is one of the most overrated beers I've ever bought. If you're really that interested, pick one up; while it will likely disappoint, it won't let you down. Delirium Nocturnum is a more interesting and, I feel, a more rewarding experience than this Belgian brew."
"An easy drinking brew. One of the best examples of the style for me."
"Notes: I didn't have it with food, but I think this would go much better with food."
"D- Really drinkable beer; a great way to finish an evening."
"The beer tasted nice, but nothing great. The sweetness with a bit of the apple hangs on. Very little of the belgian funk plays in the palate, which I find incredibly disappointing. Carbonation is OK, biting but lower than I expected for what I know of the style. Very drinkable, with none of the higher ABV coming through but just not what I was hoping for..."
"D-way too high for a brew with an 8.5abv tasty,tasty and tasty..."
"I have tasted this before, and I remember it being much more carbonated and a bit lighter/fluffier. I guess this may just be a slightly flattened bottle. Still quite tasty though, and a good complement to its cousin BSPA Duvel."
"perfect brew"
"future bottles were better received"
"In closing, this is one of the finest beers in the world. I really enjoy it each and every time I get the chance. I highly recommend this beer! Peace out beer freaks."
"Drinkability - dangerously drinkable, would definitely enjoy a few of these before falling over in my chair."
"D - Rather drinkable and I would drink more if the price per bottle wasn't so damn high here in Australia."
"Medium body, despite the volume of alcohol relatively easy to drink."
"Overall a good beer. I fear that my ratings are indicative of my mild dislike for the belgian style (much in the same way that I no longer enjoy watching the barca style that spain's national team inherited from holland). I recommend this beer to anyone who hasn't tried it because of its quality and reputation but I will probably never buy a second bottle unless tasting with those who have not yet sampled this brew."
"D- I only had the one. I couldn't bear the strong metallic flavor. This is my first time having it on tap, I do remember preferring the Nocturnum to this, but I don't remember it being this bad. I'll hafta pick up a bottle and try it again."
"D - Not quite as splendid as its cousin Duvel, but a great BSPA nonetheless."
"D: Great all the way through"
"They price is rather unappealing but it is still a fantastic beer and a nice change of pace from others"
"This would be outstanding with a perfectly prepared steak. I get hungry at the thought of it."
"This is highly recommended."
"Drinkability- This is the best damned bubblegum I've ever had. If Delirium Tremens were less expensive, it would be near the top of my list of lighter beers with which to make a delicious drinking session."
"Overall this is a fairly light, dry and flavorful beer. It has a decent complexity and is fairly easy drinking. It hides its alcohol well."
"First sip is yummy!!! Big collection of flavors. Spicy cloves, rum soaked pears, crisp apples, plus a whole lot more. A great complex ale that I need to have a lot more so I can discover even more flavors."
"Most people are very surprised when tasting this pale ale. Complex flavoring is more what one would expect from much darker ales. Very pleasant combination of sweet pear and nectarine and a cinnamon-nutmeg spiciness. Very hard to put my finger on it."
"Banana Cream Pie Float anyone? This beer is simply fantastic and consistent and can be enjoyed by itself or with a wide array of food. The packaging is one of a kind and really makes a statement about the quality you are getting. The aroma is like smelling a freshly baked banana cream pie in a bake shop with hints of vanilla, yeast, and orange. It tastes nothing like it looks, as you may be expecting a light flavor. The flavor is rich, velvety, and well balanced. I imagined frying bananas and a sprinkling of orange and lemon zest, but having a nice hop and malt balance with notes of a sourdough starter. Even though this beer is on the higher medium body scale, it is easy to drink. The finish is long, creamy, and leaves the banana flavor around for a while. My favorite paring with this was a seared foie gras, brioche, and banana/apple chutney."
"Overall: See drinkability. Definitely experience this beer."
"Taste is sweet and sharp, not much bite from the alcohol which is surprising given the strength, but it's nice. This has crazy low gravity it's amazing. Very clean finish with a light hoppiness, this is excellent on tap if you can find it."
"pours a slightly hazy yellow color with extra large white fluffy head, good lacing, and lively carbonation. lots of lacing remains as the head quickly recedes. lots of spices in the aroma, same in the taste with some citrus lemony hints. light body and thin slick texture. smooth and very easy to drink. finishes sweet and tart with a light bitterness. moderately sweet with long flavor duration. excellent brew!"
"Overall, very good beer. sweet and dry, drinkable all around. Worth a try for sure. But be careful 8.5% will sneak up on you."
"Poured a golden straw in color"
"D- I love this beer, would definetly buy again!"
"It has cream soda tastes, along with white raisins. It is a strange taste that reminds me more of a darker beer than it looks."
"Beer has a medium to light body and a late breadiness to it. No real carbonation in mouth but an overall smooth mouthfeel. There is a slight bitterness that builds in the back of the mouth. Some citrusy / spicy notes in there. Overall its pretty good. I've had it several times and I would have it again."
"This one does a good job of winning me over to the tropical fruits of wheatbeers/tripels (although this is listed as a Belgian strong ale) which to be honest have had difficult appealing to me recently. This one compares favourably to la fin du monde from memory, because I don't find it as cloyingly sweet. I think that's due to the more sulfuric notes in the nose and the bitter taste."
"Overall -- this beer is utterly fantastic. Not in my top 5 but hovering nicely around number 10. If you haven't had it, go get it."
"Drinkability is medium. Tastes great and goes down easy, but the ABV is high to have many of these. Also not sure I'd want to have more than 2 in a row due to the sweet and sugary taste."
"Altogether an amazing experience, can't wait to share with others."
"Delirium's cafe is one of the world's top beer bars, Delirium's pink elephants are among the world's most recognizable beer logos but the Delirium beer itself doesn't come anywhere close to ranking as one of the world's best beers. Although its popularity is largely warranted, there are far more (and far superior) Belgian ales out there."
"D: Doesn't hit as hard as Nocturnum did for me, which is odd because the ABV is the same. Still, the taste was great and refreshingly satisfying. One at a time is enough, but that one is highly enjoyable."
"D: Doesn't become bitter with time like some belgian ales I've tried, like Piraat. You just don't get sick of this beer."
"Bottle is about 2.5 years old and the cork reads 2008. Upon popping of the cork a steady stream of foam comes oozing out of bottle and continues for several minutes until I finally pour the glass. Pour yeilds about 2.5 inches of white creamy head which recedes into a solid lacing sitting so nicely atop this golden yellow beer. Lots of white floaties and a steady stream of bubbles which are streaming from the nucleation point of my claret glass. Carbonation is ridiculous and the intense stream of bubbles have continued for almost five minutes always swirling about the floaters, almost like the beer is dancing for me. Very imppressive looking beverage. Aromas wafting up at me are sweet honey with something sour and malty in the background. Got a ever so slight wift of sweet alcohol. Taste is very light for the abv of the beer and carbonation is almost prickly but still creamy and smooth at the same time. Tasting honey, light use of hops, small bit of breadiness, and maybe almost a slight pear fruitiness followed imediately by a sour, dry, but somehow still wet and creamy finish. Not sure how they got prickly, creamy, wet, and dry all in there at once, but the beer is very complex but still simple at the same time. Very easy to drink and will definately be having again. A+"
"D - Overall I was very disappointed with my first Delirium on draft. The Yard House seems to have gotten the carbonation seriously wrong, which totally changed the character of the beer. It went from one of my bottled favorites for its balance and complexity, to a simple beer with strong apple cider notes."
"It's somewhat odd to see deposits as plentiful as in this beer. Regardless it is another quality BSPA and due to its unusual appearance (in both bottle and liquid) it's well worth a look."
"The high ABV means you shouldn't take down too many bombers of this brew, but you'll want to."
"Surprised to see grades as low as D-...how does this beer fail? Great head and lacing. Great smells (fruits/mustiness) and taste (which changes through each sip and as you drink the beer). Overall a wonderful beer...what I envision when I think about Belgian beer. Happy to have a glass of this anytime!"
"D-an excellent beer, always a treat"
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Delirium Tremens used to be a real staple for me; a nice but not particularly exciting BSPA. Given that it's normally bottle-conditioned and generally somewhat bland, I didn't expect much from this beer on tap. As it turned out, the beer was extremely refreshing with a very solid flavor and feel."
"While I have lots of reasons for trying this beer, it will pair well with contemplation or relaxation, just as well as a medium to cut fatty foods. Actually this is a great accompaniment for dinner too."
"I was hoping this would rival the on tap version. Not to be sadly."
"Have had it on Tap and by the bottle. The tap version much better than the already great bottled tremmes. Very aromatic and frgrant, pours almost clear. Very drinkable well rounded ale, with very fruity and floral notes which linger past the hoppy bit that you get at the front end. Very freshing and still one of my favorite beers to have anytime"
"D: This isn't my first time having this beer, but it's the first review of it and I'm disappointed. I felt it was much better before, so I don't know what to blame it on. Maybe the taps are bad? The atmosphere was too cloudy?"
"Overall, this was a pretty solid beer and the first I've had of the two main Deliriums. Drinkable in that it's pretty tasty and a good-looker, but the alcohol could put you back a bit after a few. This is something I'll have again occasionally but certainly won't buy in bulk, mainly for the price. Not bad at all, though."
"The taste has a spicy flavor. Mouthfeel is light due to the carbonation. Has some corriander flavor finishing with a citus like acidity. Has a surprising malt aftertaste. Great beer. A standard in my fridge."
"Overall Impression: This is a very tasty Belgian Strong Pale Ale! Would have had more than one, but there were other Belgian Ales I had to try"
"panache."
"Overall this was dissappointing. I like Pale Ale/IPA's but this one seemed flat and plain. Very smooth and easy to drink but there are much better ale's out there especially at this high ABV there are a lot of very good ales. For a better example of this type of ale (one of my favorites) I would recommend Russian River's 'Damnation'. The folks at RR have nailed this style IMO."
"D: Extremely smooth for the high ABV. Stands up great by itself or would pair nicely with cheese and fruit."
"I am very impressed with this beer. Aroma was great along with a taste that was packed with a mix of bold flavors, and the balance was spot on. Sweet but not cloying and enough going on to want to have another just to enjoy it all over again."
"Had this on tap at Eulogy bar in Philly. Poured into a chalice, golden yellow with god retention on a white head and great lacing. Lots of carbonation. Smell was sweet and fruity from the yeasts, earthy and uniquely Belgian hops. Taste was similar, fruity then dry earthy hops. Hides the alcohol well, very drinkable, great beer."
"(D)- A good beer from what I remember when there is not tons of sediment in it! Even a little too carbonated than I remember as well. . . A bad bottle?"
"Nice limpid golden beer with uniform white head, subsided to delicious lacing. Crisp aroma of citrus and yeast. Typical belgian taste - sweet malt, fruits and honey, yeasts again in collaboration gave an excellent result. Very drinkable and smooth beer sparkling in a glass was ingested gaily in a moment. Highly recommended!"
"D: Outstanding. Had this in a pint size glass and was feeling it by the end. Trouble because I cant taste the alcohol and could drink this any day and in for any season."
"D: Nice beer that drinks above average."
"D: While it is strong, the nothing in the flavor is overpowering. I'll definitely be finishing the 750 this evening."
"Goes down incredibly smooth, unlike some other BSPA's I've had recently. Were it not for the ABV, I could see myself pounding back several of these in an evening. Just one crept up on me... Great stuff."
"D: Just about the right amount of alcohol that I can drink plenty of them. One of my favorite Belgian pale ales."
"D: one bottle is it... I there is not much here but there is not supposed to be it is supposed to be perfectly crafted I feel that it is not up to par for the style, it reminds me more of a triple than a strong ale, kinda tastes like it did not fully ferment out, there is too much residual sweetness."
"The body is medium and the carbonation is high with a very slight sting. Drinkability is very good for the high alcohol level, and this is a fine one-and-done type of beer to enjoy prior to or during a meal. A true Belgian classic, and one of the best of a style that can often be too bland for my palate."
"Drinkability: I could have it every once in a while but I'd rather have a Duvel or St. Sebastian's Grand Reserve."
"D – This is a good brew on tap; not spectacular. But it is only a notch below…"
"Notes: Lots of different fruits that mix well, and while they provide sweetness, it isn't overly cloying."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, could easily drink several"
"Overall, the taste is a little too mild for me. This almost comes off as a saison."
"D - Excellent pale ale. Would love to have more in the future."
"Drinkability - This is a good beer, and I would drink it again if someone offered it to me, but probably will not buy it on my own."
"this is definitely a sipper and a real treat. great example of a belgian strong pale ale. seems to have a little extra something that separates itself. will be drinking again soon"
"--mcs"
"D: Very rich. This one can get you in trouble because the alcohol is masked so well behind the sweetness. I've very happy that the beer was as awesome as the bottle. The pink elephants delivered!"
"I went against my better judgement and bought a big bottle of this beer. i usually have no one to share with, and i rarely will drink a big bottle in one sitting. all i can say about this beer is that i should've bought 2. an absolute must."
"I have been looking forward to this beer for some time and it did not disappoint."
"The volume to price ratio left me with a bitter taste in my wallet though so I doubt Ill be ordering this anytime soon. But never the less a decent beer."
"Mouthfeel - Dry, medium body and quite carbonated."
"It is possible to have on too many of these."
"D: Smooth and somewhat light. I could easily put away a whole pint of this in a night. Masks the alcohol pretty good."
"Once I was able to fully empty the contents of the bottle I was intrigued by the cloudiness and copious amount of bubbles erupting from the bottom of the glass. The aroma had a bit of citrus to it and an interesting sweetness. The taste was like a combination of fruit and flowers and honey, complimented by a medium-weight body that was delicious and extremely satisfying. It's a bit pricey per bottle but it is just an amazing beer with tons of character. I love it!"
"This is a great beer, drinkable and enjoyable, i was very pleased and will be getting again, also will now have to try the other Deliriums."
"Light and tingly, strong carbonation. Very drinkable, especially as it warms"
"What is most impressive is the mouthfeel and taste are comparable to Duvel, but I'd say Duvel is more carbonated and Delirium is more flavorful. Same flavors, yeast, bread, banana, clove, but I think they just come through better in the Delirium. Too bad is so much more expensive than Duvel."
"Overall a solid Belgian pale ale. I'd get more if it weren't so costly."
"8.5%? You don't taste it but certainly do feel it. Packs a nice punch. Overall a very enjoyable beer!"
"Light and refreshing to drink, with a crisp carbonation that really fits the brew, and is reminiscent of dry cider."
"I could drink a few of these, but at the price in the states, it may be worth drinking something else in the states. Still, it's one of my regulars, and I can drink it often. Great beer."
"D: Man, this is good stuff. I can put away a 750ml bottle, but after that, I would be done. On the other hand, if I were inclined, I could session this at a bar on tap. (Eulogy)"
"While I have had this brew a few times in the past this is my first ""review"". This brew was had as a part of a New Years Celebration. This brew poured to a nice golden color with a good sized frothy white head that had incredible retention that left nice lacing. The aroma was very pleasant, nice pale malt, spices, slightly fruity and yeast all stick out. I really enjoyed the aroma but the flavor was even better. Nice malt character, fruit flavors (apple & pear) that play well with everything else. Nice spiciness that seems to really highlight clove and coriander. Effervescent finish which goes well. Really a nice brew and one that I look forward to having."
"Very drinkable...one I have had many times in the past and will continue to seek out. An all-time classic!"
"Very good beer, but I have to admit this one was a ton better on tap. Maybe this bottle isn't at it's peak for freshness either. Still a really good belgian."
"Wonderful Belgian double pale ale, the best i've ever had!"
"Drinkability: Great taste, light, very drinkable. Even though it is a ""strong ale"" its easy to forget that."
"D - A great Belgian sipper, this brew is well-balanced and has a good flavor profile."
"D: A very nice beer, very drinkable, but IMHO it doesn't quite live up to the claim of ""best beer in the world"" or even it's price tag. I actually prefer the delirium noel to the tremens."
"A bit sweet, but oherwise quite drinkable. Although I am a bit critical of this beer, I must say it is a very nice beer."
"T- It has a very strong lemony taste. Extremely sweet. It's a very high quality beer, but way too sweet. It's not for me, but I can see its quality."
"Overall, great beer. Try it if you can get your hands on it, I'd submit that you wouldn't be disappointed in anyway what-so-ever. I'd really like to see how this beer holds up to aging, think I might grab a bottle and try it out for you all a couple of years down the road. Cheers."
"Drinkability - A drink to sip for sure. With such off the wall flavors and the decent ABV, this drink will be good to enjoy with dinner."
"Overall: Very good beer, I can see why some people are in love with it."
"Drinkability is good, but the carbonation slows down the consumption a bit, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: It's a heavy sort of creamy, so yes its drinkable because the taste is very good, but 1 of these beers is good enough for 1 night."
"Kudos to a very good beer."
"Drinkability: A sipper for sure. This is a tasty beer and one I'd be willing to drink again for sure- highly recommended."
"This beer has to be drunk cold, it changes all attributes as it warms, not so healthy as it heats up, so drink it swiftly!"
"Verdict: Delirium Tremens is a highly drinkable, refreshing, and character-filled brew. Brouwerij Huyghe is fast becoming one of my favorite Belgian brewers."
"At 8.5 ABV this is very mild and drinkable. One bottle would be enough because of the sweetness and ABV. Worth trying but would not be in my regular rotation."
"What a strange brew. Had it a while ago but can't forget it. Poured much clearer and with less head than I expected. Smell was fruity and floral. Taste was not as yeasty as I like as far as belgians go, but the amalgam of fruit flavors and floral/spice hints were nice. This beer just seems a bit watery to me but that being said it is verrry drinkable and the alcohol is barely noticeable. Gotta love the bottle."
"Drinkability: Light and flavorful Strong Belgian Ale that is a great sipper, but probably not quite worthy of the ""voted best beer in the world status"" they tout around."
"Matchbox (Capitol Hill)/$8/10 oz"
"Alcohol is masked extremely well in is hardly noticeable on the palate. Couple that with the lightness in body due to the carbonation and excellent attenuation and this beer is a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"D: Quite an enjoyable beer. I have generally skipped it lately because I am moving out of the BSPA style, but this is a good reminder of what I'm missing, and should seek out again."
"D: I've always loved this beer. It's a great example of the style. Maybe not quite as good as Duvel, but pretty close. Watch out for the abv!"
"Pours a clear, pale blonde color with a very thin lacy head. Gives off a subtle fruity aroma. The body is very light with high carbonation levels. The flavor is sweet and vinous and is moved around on the palate by the high amount of carbonation. Finishes with a sweet malty flavor with a final kick and fizz from the bubbles."
"Pours a light golden color with a two finger head that disappears quickly and gives way to minimal lacing. The aroma is of sweet fruits, wheat, and a slight floral smell. The smell is very inviting. The taste is good but not great, there is a taste of wheat with some light fruits. Apple comes through the most. The mouthfeel is very carbonated but not stingy. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, especially considering the alcohol content, it is close to great but not there."
"D= This beer confused the hell outta me. Floaties? Pear? Pink Elephants? Interesting brew and I may buy it again if I got the hankerin for a nice belgian."
"Overall, this is a very good brew. I had it before and didn't think quite as highly of it as I do now, but I'm glad I gave it another shot. Very tasty brew and a wonderful example of the style. You owe it to yourself to try it."
"Overall, this was a drinkable and enjoyable beer, but not outstanding to me. I'll drink it again, but for the price, I'll look to some other choices first."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, 2008 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a slightly hazy bright gold color with quite a bit of sediment, and also has about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like pears, apples, peppery spice, yeast, and some oranges. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pears, peppery spice, bananas, and a bit of grain/bread and lemon. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little slick and creamy and is well carbonated, but it has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. Drinkability is decent, but would be better if the carbonation was lower. Overall I thought this was a good enough brew."
"Overall: Drinks like adult alcoholic apple juice; much like the beer version of a hard cider. Should be available in box form; straw included. Bonus points for a unique mascot and bottle design."
"D - Very refreshing and lower ABV. Nice"
"D: While this beer is drinkable, it is rather acidic. A fairly bitter beer overall, but the fruitiness makes it tolerable. Not a bad beer for the style, but I prefer something with a little more substance and spiciness to it."
"D) Good, especially with the high ABV. Easy and pleasant to drink, tasty, refreshing. A nice Belgian ale."
"Good beer to have.The bottle looks great, the label dito."
"Drinkability: A quite good Belgian Pale Ale. Smooth and spice like a wheat, but with the body and flavor of a pale ale. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Notes - Big flavor and alot of alcohol make this one strong brew. Very well balanced and straight to the point, this beer holds its weight."
"You will definitely have the Delirium Tremens (DT) the next morning after a few of these."
"Very sippable, I really enjoyed this one as the alcohol is well hidden."
"Drinkability: BSPAs can get me into trouble; Delirium Tremens is no exception."
"D: As the 988th reviewer of this beer, I don't know if there is anything new I can add to the discussion. However, I found myself not being terribly impressed with this right out of the gate. But as it warmed, it picked up a lot of character and really grew on me. There's great complexity here that is extremely well balanced. Definitely worth a revisit down the road."
"Wow what a delicious smell in the bottle! Smells of citrus, lemons, and yeast, kind of like a lemon drop, but not in a sweet way. Pours to a cloudy bright yellow with a big head that is real foamy. Taste is also on the citrus side, sweet and yeasty, only very slight bitters in the background. Mouthfeel is fizzy, but yet very thick and chewy. I think this may be my first brew of this particular style. How delicious and refreshing. I could drink this high SG in the heat and not bog down at all. The ABV is not even evident more than it is obviously adding to the flavor in undertones. I'm delirious!"
"Not bad, but for me a one time experience"
"The only downside is the price tag, but do not let it stop you. It is well worth it."
"Notes: A certainly interesting take on the style that i will definitely order again"
"Mouthfeel: Intensely carbonated, perhaps a tad too much for my taste, with a touch of harshness from the alcohol, rich in body, a big yet satisfying beer for the style"
"Over all, this beer is a pure delight to drink. It's a blend of so many different tastes that it's got to be in a class all it's own. This beer could be viewed as the ultimate example of a Belgian ale or even of beer itself. It's a rollercoaster ride of divine tastes all rolled into one glass of yellow carbonated liquid. It's special."
"D. Super drinkable. A very soild strong belgain ale."
"- Overall the flavor and smell was great, and really spot on for what in my opinion is just an average golden Belgian Ale. I much prefer the Nocturnum better. The sheer amount of sediment turned me off greatly from this brew.. I don't mind bottle conditioning and refermentation... but not at the price of having a full ounce of multi-colored junk floating around it various forms."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle (though the label stated half that quantity) into a goblet. Poured a hazy golden colour with lots of floaties and a big foamy head that like lasted forever. The smell was very fruity with a little yeast nose too. The best part was the lengthy taste - begins with a twangy sweet and malty note that after a while changes into a chikoo (sapotila or sapot - an exotic fruit) flavour - very biscuit like. Leaves the mouth very moist - like what an appetizer will do. Optimum caronation works itself around your palate. The alcohol is hidden very well here, would highly recommend this beer to keep savouring throughout the evening into the night and later."
"D: very drinkable beer. As high as it is, the alcohol is hidden fairly well."
"A clear golden pour with a medium sized frothy white head that lasted forever , lots of yeast chunks floating around with a huge jet of tiny carbonation bubbles coming from the bottom, lots of lacing and sheeting . Aroma is spicy ,and lightly yeasty , lots of fruity notes ,pineapple,lemon,banana, maybe peaches . Flavor is of pale malt grain , some grassy hops with nice fruit notes. Quite yeasty bready , a light honey like sweetness with some flashes of peppercorns . A nice balance between the malt , hops , and yeast . Crisp light body for such a high ABV , no bad alcohol flavors or aromas.Slick lively mouthfeel,quite drinkable. Well crafted and enjoyable"
"I would drink this all night if given the opportunity. Unfortunately I can't afford to!"
"The alcohol is lightly detected, in the flavor area. It's easily felt, though. Somewhat surprising at 8.5%abv. While it is quite tasty, it would get you messed up fairly quickly."
"Drinkability: Very good. Its complex and unique yet true to style. Its not cloying yet masks the alcohol very well. Very interesting and invites for more. Would have again over most Belgian strong pale."
"VERY drinkable. This is a fantastic beer. Even the full 750ml bottle is possible once you get going."
"Try it if you can, a very good example of a Belgian Strong Golden."
"Poured a light amber with some floaties, and a moderate head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was fresh, sour apples. The taste was sweet/sour with carbonation bubbling all over tongue. The feel was light bodied with lots of carbonation. Drinkability was reasonably good for an 8.50 ABV. In general I'm not a fan, but admittedly, I'm not a big fan of any of the Belgians. Nocturnum was better as a BSDA."
"D - Very easy to drink, especially considering the ABV. Wish I liked them more, espcially since they come in that great glass with the pink elephants. Unfortunately just not a fan of the sytle."
"D- Scary good. Could drink many of these. 8.5%??? Nah, seems lighter than that. A lot like Duvel where one is just not enough. Can drink 2-3 and still enjoy this beer. I think the stong suit of this beer."
"d: this is a favorite of mine. I can drink this often and for a long time. not quite a session beer however."
"Pale gold color with a huge foamy white head which leaves a small lace, has poor retention. Smells of bananas, pears, citrus, and spices. The taste matches the aroma and is sweet and dry. Nice carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. Drinkability is good, and I would have this again."
"This is not my favorite style of beer, but it is good--I probably would not buy it for myself alone again, but I would happily buy it for a group, and I would enjoy drinking it again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. They do down so easily, and a session is easy to do with this beer. The higher ABV may catch up to you eventually, but it's so good, easy to drink and not too filling, that you may not care. I know I don't."
"This is a drinkable Strong Pale Ale. Watch out for the ABV & the slimy, chunky sediment."
"Pours a typical straw yellow with a fairly thick white head - not promising, though it is quite bubbly. Fortunately, the appearance is this beer's weakest point. The inviting aroma is malty and yeasty with a firm fruity undertone that is mainly citrus and has just a hint of banana. Flavor is a delight, malty and yeasty with strong fruity tones. Texture is wonderfully tingly, more like champagne than beer so it fairly dances on the tongue and on its way down the pipes. Strongly recommended."
"A pale golden to a slightly straw color, with a half inch white colored head. The yeasty scent plucks at the nose at the front of the aroma, this soon followed by a coriander fragrance, mixing with a bread aroma. It all ends with a citrus scent, mostly of orange. A slightly hoppy start to the taste at the beginning, that brings strong earthiness. That is trailed by yeasty esters bringing fruity flavors, mostly of pear. A hearty mouthfeel that is slightly chewy in the front. Then it gradually thins out as it reaches the back of the palate. It all finishes with a strong crispness, that would be associated with a lager. The strong Belgian characteristics that one wants from this beer, along with the extra kick of hops and the crisp finish make this a one of a kind beer."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a big frothy white head that reduces down to a regular size head. The smell has plenty of citrus, some yeast notes, some fruit smells as well. The taste is similar, starts with a citrus yeast flavor, moves to the fruity and finishes with some alcohol tones, with the tones staying throughout the aftertaste. This has a nice crisp light mouthfeel, nice carbonation, and great flavor balance. This one is a pretty good session beer, but the ABV or aftertaste might get old soon. A beer that definitely should be checked out."
"D: The only way I can describe it is Champagne of Beers.... it is like champagne but in beer form.... everything about it is great... one of the best beers I've had (and not because it was free). It is a very solid Belgian beer staple. A must have !!!"
"D - This is one of my favourite Strong Belgian Ales, very refreshing, and lively, and worryingly drinkable considering the ABV. If you haven't already, this is one that should be added to your 'to try' list."
"Overall this is a top notch BSPA that rivals Duvel without question. I am so glad I got to finally try this on tap and it did not disappoint one bit. Thanks CAH and Gary! Well done."
"Very interested in comparing this with my Duvel waiting in the fridge."
"Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel but a little too overcarbonated. Pretty good stuff all around, but somewhat sweeter than I've come to expect from this style. I had no problems finishing off the bottle but not sure this iwould be one I'd quickly reach for again given the alternatives to choose from. Alcohol not very noticeable and an overall interesting take on the style."
"D - Perfect. I can't imagine a perfect day of drinking beer and not thinking of my numerous trips to Belgium. I'd plan entire trips to Europe just to enjoy this at the source. It's a life-changing experience. I highly doubt I'll ever rate another beer in my life as highly."
"Though not my favorite style of brew, I really didn't mind this one at all and it was a good one to clean the palate off with to have some more hoppy beers afterwards."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, and this is incredibly drinkable for a Strong Belgian. Could give Duvel a run for its money as the sneakiest of beers."
"This goes down easy and the alcohol is well hidden and sneaks up quickly."
"Mouthfeel is a bit better than average but drinkability is solid. These go down very well given the higher alcohol content."
"D: Very easy to drink, which makes it perfect for summer."
"Overall:"
"Obviously, I enjoyed this beer, highly recommend it, will try again."
"This is my second time having this one and as always, its solid. Good stuff!"
"poured on-tap into a DT snifter, the beer follows most of its characteristics found when poured from the bottle. Its mild and smooth while having enough interesting qualties to the flavor to keep each sip enjoyable. Fruity belgian pale with just a touch of spice. Estery and acetaldehyde notes in the flavor, just as from the bottle. The mouth is full-bodied for a pale, not watery and with crisp carbonation. Straw-like color with foamy head. Easily drinkable, you could definitely have nothing but DT all night and (barring the quick intoxication) not wind up feeling too full or put off by sweetness/spice/anything in the flavor."
"I don't know, I'm not that impressed. The malts are sour, and any of the good sugar taste is hidden. And it's very highly carbonated. I love their brew pub in Brussels, though!"
"Conclusion: Good example of the style...always a classic"
"Overall: Belgians make mediocre beer too. There is nothing special about this. There wasn't one part of this beer I was impressed with. Though you could probably get into some trouble because you can slam it back pretty easily. I imagine this is what Belgian college kids play Beirut with. Sweet bottle though."
"It tastes good but nothing special. Its a strong ale you can drink, kinda like Duvel."
"While I don't really enjoy this, it's obviously a respectable beer, and in spite of its heavy flavour and character I detect a lot of fine, subtle touches throughout the palate. It's very meticulous, even though the end result doesn't agree with me much."
"D- Fairly high with respect to the alcohol content. A 750 is a tall order, but delicious. Split with a friend to have a good time. I can't say enough good things about this beer."
"Not my favorite but it's worthy of being a staple belgian beer."
"This brew is well balanced and complex with lots of different angles of character."
"D: This was actually the beer that brought me into the craft world. I was attending a law school function at Brasserie Beck, and this was one of the beers available. It inspired me to look into other Belgians, and from there, I moved into the American craft scene. So it definitely has nostalgic value for me. It still holds up fairly well in its own right, but there's a ton of other Belgians I'd have before it."
"MF&D - good body, nothing special though. The carbonation quickly fades from its former, abundant, self. Perhaps a bit thin in body, though debatable (was a lot more appetizing when much colder)"
"Poured with a huge, frothy white head that was mostly diminishing to about 1/2-finger size. Body was cloudy and dark yellow, with lots of particles (some quite large) floating around. High carbonation. Great aroma... heavy yeast, with some citrus in there as well. Medium body on the palate, slightly creamy, and very fizzy. Flavor is initially sweet and slightly acidic, and finishes with a long-lasting alcohol taste that causes some warmth in the back of the throat. A very solid Belgian strong pale ale... not my favorite, but still damned impressive."
"This is very drinkable."
"The flavor was much like Duvel with a few differences. The taste was hops and citrus. A rather dry finish but in a good way. The mouth feel is not as good as I expected with not quite enough carbonation, at least for what I expect. The beer is strong yet very drinkable. My kids got to go to the bar where they brew this stuff. I am now jealous."
"A far above average example of the style."
"My girlfriend swears this beer makes her delirious. I think it makes me drunk. Pours a nice gold with low carbonation and 1 1/2 finger head. Oakey scents. Very smooth, almost, watery. Typical sweet Belgian alcohol taste but not too strong. I've had the bottle, which was much better. ""How Sweet it Is"" just came on and the beer is tasting better. Feels so fine."
"M + D: A richer, medium body. Touch of dryness on the finish, but it's right on the back, I find. Slightly syrupy until that point, and a bit of alcohol warmth. I'm kinda surprised that it took so long to get into this one, but I suppose late is better than never. An enjoyable brew.... eventually, I'll be back for more."
"Really enjoyed this, not my favourite kind of style but I loved this one all the same"
"I truly do hope that this was a bad bottle, because this was seriously a joke. Ludachris, if you are reading this, I'm going to take a picture of the beer, just to show you what I mean. I've never had a beer, so highly rated on BA perform so poorly."
"D: Great drinkability, goes down very easy, even with a considerable alcohol content."
"Notes - Good level of carbonation on the mouthfeel. A tasty beer that might be in my top 10."
"D - This is a really good brew. Even better on tap than from the bottle."
"Beer pours up with a big, creamy head that lingers. The rich gold color is true to style. The aroma is lemon and orange zest, clove, maybe some warm banana notes (banana bread?). The taste is honeysuckle, clove, and a citrus finish... all balanced by the sweetness of light malt. The beer has the perfect amount of carbonation and a mouthfeel that is light and smooth without being watery. I picked this beer up on a lark, and I was surprised and delighted with what I discovered."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with a large long lasting white head. Sweet, Belgian yeasty nose, lots of bubblegum with some mild vanilla notes and a small touch of bitterness. Quality malt character with a semi sour green apple note, ive noticed that the Tremens doesnt have the sharp spice character normally associated with Tripels. Round and smooth with almost no alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation, medium bodied and very drinkable. Classic, without a doubt."
"Drinkability: This is a slow drink, though I enjoyed it quite a bit. No way in hell am I ever paying $8.50 for a 330mL bottle again (price at Spike's), but I could see myself buying another one of these elsewhere at some point."
"Future outlook: Very good stuff to be sure, but considering the hefty price, I might stick to other well regarded, lower cost alternatives. Certainly wouldn't turn one down though..."
"quite drinkable. especially given the abv. if i didn't know better (which i don't always) i'd imagine throwing back more than one. and then some hijinx or mayhem would ensue."
"Mouthfeel: Pretty sharp carbonation with a light body"
"This beer pours a deep golden straw color - slightly hazy and heavy on sediment throughout the whole beer. A two and a half finger of sudsy head on top - GREAT retention with spotty lacing. Nose is of Belgian yeast, clove, orange, lemon, and a touch of banana. Taste is of a clove and corriander spices at first, slightly bready in the middle and banana in the finish - leaving a slightly sweet banana fruity aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter to medium body, decent carbonation, slightly creamy at first with a dryer crisp finish. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"Pours a golden straw color with a silky beige head. Nose has caramel, tropical fruits, peppery alcohol and herbal yeast. Taste was a bit on the mellow side. Well balanced beer, just expected more from the nose. Crisp body is well carbonated. Good stuff from Delerium."
"D- Pretty good. The ABV and alcohol taste hold this one back a little, but definitely a good Belgian. I would reach for an equivalently priced Duvel though."
"Tthis is pretty drinkable at 8.7%. The ABV is noticeable but fits in well with the flavour. I could drink a couple of these if they were free, I'm not sure if I'll be paying for any more at the going rate here in Montreal. There are too many better, less expensive beers to be had. While this beer is pretty nice, it didn't blow me away."
"Overall a complex and very interesting beer. The alcohol is reasonably well disguised, proving a very enjoyable drinking experience. Thumbs up!"
"Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is nearly endless."
"Finished with malt, banana, stone fruit and oranges and white bread and yeast. All in all, a typical Belgian ""kicked up a big notch."" Highly recommend trying this one on tap if you find it."
"Complex flavor, long finish. The hops and bitterness were a delightful surprise. This is a solid A."
"Straw colored beer forms a 2 finger snow white head which holds for several minutes. Ample carbonation rages inside the brew. Brew smells of yeast, apples, ginger, and spices. Taste is citrus based and mild, alcohol well masked, overall the beer is very well balanced with a mild hop presence in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth, and easy to drink. A very good beer."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Gentle pour still left a huge fizzy head that settled quickly and left all sorts of lacing. Pours a light golden color with lots of bubbles. I am used to seeing a bit more sediment floating around my Delirium Tremens, but this particular bottle is a bit more clear. Nicely balanced aroma: Citrus fruit, spice and hops. Taste is much the same. Spice and fruit up front. Pear and apple, and I get a hint of grapefruit as well (maybe I am drinking it wrong). Faint hint of alcohol. A touch of bitterness comes through in the end. Dry mouthfeel. Light to medium body. Drinks down dangerously easy. I've had this before before. I'll have this beer again. A real pleasure to drink."
"T/M: The palate provides a nice bite complemented well by the body the medium with high carbonation. Apple, banana, and pear with dash of black pepper. The carbonation with the pepper is almost over the top."
"Date notched as March 2008 production. Pour into tulip from 25.4 oz bottle. Golden color with yeast elements afloat. Mostly clear with sizeable initial head mostly diminishing with moderate lacing remaining. Malty sweetness on the nose with citrus notes. I'd agree with the mild and sweet touch to this beer. Alcohol mostly hidden (more noticeable on front end than the back) with slight bitter finish. A very enjoyable brew - cheers to the Belgians!"
"Taste is not as complex as the nose mainly because its heavy on the lemon and pear flavors which are enhanced by a healthy degree of spice. The finish comes in two stages when the initial hit of hops gives way to a strong alcohol presence."
"d- fairly easy for an 8.5, i drank the entire 25 oz bottle with no food no problem"
"Authentic FRESH Belgian beer, brought straight from the source on our spring break just two weeks ago. What a treat."
"Pours cloudy pale yellow with some chunks in the glass. Not sure what it is, but we'll see. Good one finger white head. Smell - very fruity and sweet. Pears, apples, honey, pretty interesting. Taste - it is sweet and it is fruity. I like it, but this is not even close to what I expected. Lemon, pears, some spices malts. Can't find any hops in there. It's weird - i do like this beer, but it is pretty strange one. It is somewhat balanced, rich. It is kinda smooth. And it is fairly drinkable. I'll make sure I give it another try."
"The appearance had a huge head that lasted forever. The color is a hazy gold with massive amounts of chunky sediment floating around. Tons of lacing reveal themselves with each sip. Very appealing aroma with hints of citrus, banana, metallic copper, and light sweet malt. Distinctive Belgian aroma. The taste is very balanced with not too much of one thing. Perfect carbonation with a slight bitterness on the finish. Somewhat sweet with an ABV that is well-hidden. I can't believe it is 9%, because I can barely taste any alcohol. Would like to see more hop flavor. Overall a must try!"
"Note: My local 24 hour store got a few cases of these In, and didnt know the pricing on them, so I paid pretty much 1.75 per 12 oz bottle. They ussually only have marco brews, im glad GOOD beer is becoming more popular."
"Drinkability: This is quite a nice beer and I can see having another in the future but with this ABV a single beer is enough for one sitting, even with a meal."
"Overall, a great, well balanced Begian strong ale. The only downside for me was the amount of sediment that poured out. Besides that, I wish this puppy was available down where I lived. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Pretty good since it has a relatively high ABV. Good mouthfeel, great taste..recommended."
"Final Thoughts - Not the best beer in the world, but a damn fine one. Great to enjoy with friends. Give it a try."
"D=I enjoyed the Tremens though I don't know that I would drink more than one of the 750ml bottles in an evening."
"D - Extremely drinkable, once you've sat the beer down for 1-2 min. you are quickly temped to take another sip."
"D- this is very easy to drink, i want one right now and its 9:47 in the morning. IMO better than the nocturnom. Although completely diff styles."
"Drinkablitity: you might think this day is like any other but this day was unique ,although familar its well worth enjoying to the fullist.cheers."
"I enjoyed this, but will probably try it in a tulip glass tomorrow."
"Another solid BSPA that falls just short of Duvel for me."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is."
"This is an enjoyable beer and easy to drink. Perhaps a bit too sweet for my taste, but I'd go back for another."
"Taste is moderate of malts, slightly tart but pleasant all the way through. None of the lager notes present in Duvel and not as gummy sweet. This is a superior beer to Duvel, yet superior is a relative term here. Offers a nice feel that maintains well throughout the glass and improves with a bit of warming, yet doesn't diminish too much even after 30 minutes of air. Interesting enough to seek out in the bottle, but not likely to stand up to some non-Belgian versions, oddly.."
"D - Supringly great with such a high abv. I had 2 of these!!!"
"drinkability: Too extreme on the sweet/fruity side for me but excellent for the style."
"Drinkability: Goes down fairly easily considering the ABV %. Pretty solid, but, then again, so are the other Deliriums. I get the pink elephants on the label, but what's the significance of the pimp-strutting alligators and ball-balancing Chinese dragons?"
"Heavily carbonated as expected, contributing to the thick and creamy mouthfeel. Light heat on the palate."
"Cloudy pale yellow beer that has a thick billowing head that slowly fades.Aroma is fruity and spicy.Taste is once again fruit,spicy,sugar cane and alcohol on the back end.Very enjoyable and something that I would recommend and purchase again in the future!!"
"Notes: If I was inclined to blow a 10-spot every week on beer, I'd go back for Delirium Tremens until I was to find something better. I really like this beer, and I recommend it for your enjoyment."
"Drinkability was decent, the beer really sneaks around the back and hits you with a well-hidden alcohol smack, but if I hadn't been sampling several different beers at Volo I would have definitely gone back for another Delirium."
"Drinkability is very high you can have a few of these on a nice summer day."
"This brew is medium bodied and a little bit roughly carbonated it finishes crisp and somewhat dry. The taste is within range of the aroma with slight spice, yeast, and fruitiness to it. The only disparity in the taste that I noticed was some alcohol in the aftertaste. A good brew. Worth trying once, but nothing special."
"A very good Trappist Ale. It goes down smooth and has a lot of flavor for a beer that is so easy to drink. It is ripe with fermentation as well, packing a solid 8.5% that is well hidden. This is not quite as good as Foret, but still a very good drink. I taste a whole lot of yeast. It almost tastes a bit like rye bread, which is a good thing."
"D: I could take my time with a bottle of this and I don't think you'd ever need more than two. But with how the flavors pull through with warming its good to take time and enjoy.. While other down a sixer two bottles of this would outlast six of most brews..."
"D - The light and crisp character lends itself to good drinkability even considering the high alcohol content. Can be sneaky for sure."
"I've seen this beer around many times and i have not checked it out until now (thanks BIF Educator!). I am a Belgian greenhorn still training my palate and have realized that I enjoy the Strong Pales; this one being the reinforcer. I look forward to purchasing some soon."
"4.5 M&4.5 D: softly spritzy fizziness remains on the palate, against a full body, pretty quiet flavour profile, and well-hidden alc. This tripel is consistently dry, spicy, and bitter, leaving fruit esters and maltiness all behind. Although it is not as colourful, complex, and delicious as some of its opposite numbers, this beer rates well in my book for being a ""bitter"" example that I really enjoy!"
"D: Yum. A little pricey for what you get, but the bottle kicks ass."
"Pours a golden somewhat cloudy colored body, fizzy, with a white head, small, but it has good lacing & creaminess. Has a very floral, sweet, dark fruity aroma. Some spices too. Spices and floral tasting. A light taste. Some sediment in bottom."
"If you've never had a Trappist ale from Belgium and aren't able to find a decent one in your area, you should at least pick up some of this. Delirium Tremens is a pretty good example of what a Belgian beer can taste like. This isn't officially classified as a Tripel, but it's very similar, as it is a strong ale (9%) and it's a pale ale. Well rounded flavor, strong alcohol, and overall a nice beer to relax with or to enjoy on a special occasion. Just don't drink it too cold or at room temperature. Belgians like this do best at cellar temperature and in a goblet-shaped glass. Trust me - try it yourself."
"This is good, but for $11 per bottle I can't have it all the time. A great occasional treat."
"Overall a rather tasty BSPA, Porter's never ceases to impress me with the freshness and variety of their beers."
"This is a big, big beer. Not for the novice. I ordered up a pint at the C*ck and Bull in Glendale, Oh. Thinking it was $4/pint like the rest of the menu, I selected the funny-looking tap with elephants on it. The bartender hands me the brew, allows me to sip it and tells me it is the ONLY beer not on happy hour. She goes on to tell me this one will cost me $8/pint. Holy crap! Oh well, it was sorta worth it. It had a huge, glowing-white head. the smell was piny, citrusy. The taste: out of this world. My buddies and I all tasted fruit. Big, big fruit like apples an melon. The crisp finish leaves you longing for another draw from the glass. Nothing like a head full of Delirium! The ABV tips the charts. If you see this beer anywhere, buy it! It will be worth the extra cheddar you will plunk down to get it."
"D: I had no trouble finishing this bomber. Not too sweet, not too thick, not too... anything, except alcohol filled. I was a bit gone after finishing 22oz of this 8.5% brew. I want another. At $8 apiece, not a bad choice for a great evening."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very dry and kind of crisp. The 9% alcohol is nice."
"pours a hazy straw yellow with a big foamy head that is reduced to a nice head as it warms it smells of fruits .. bananas and pears and spices i detect a clove aftertaste very good... mouthfeel is strong with fruit hops and spices all balancing for a delicious flavor so smooth @ 9 abv.. drink this strong ale warmer than most ales ...as it warms it get more complex and better its 17.99 a 4pak but worth it as a treat every couple of a weeks"
"I am addicted to this stuff, certainly one of my top beers."
"My biggest complaint would be what feels like a slight acidity to the brew, making it harder to drink. But overall I'm very impressed."
"D>the beer is very drinkable, as i mentioned, alcohol is not very present and taste is also very well balanced and not extreme at all for a Belgian beer. honestly, this beer would go well with a light meal...i would know, had half the 750 bottle with steamed fish touched with lemon."
"I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into on this one. This is a keeper for sure. If only it wasn't $10 a bottle, I would most likely drink this weekly, if not daily. At any rate, this is a beer I will be returning to frequently."
"Very good and too easy to drink. Bombers please!!"
"I was at a bar with an enourmous amount of beers on tap. Nitrogen tapped even. And the tap with the pink elephant called Delerium Tremens really caught my eye. I'm pretty sure ""delerium tremens"" is the medical term for the ""shakes"" that drunks get. The bar tender said it was his favorite beer there so I had him fetch me a ten ounce goblet of the stuff. Right away I could detect a strong similarity to La Fin Du Monde, another excellent strong Belgian style ale. There was little head and a transparent golden color with many fine bubbles rushing to the top of the glass. It smells sweet like brown sugar and/or honey. And the taste was very smooth, sweet, honey-laden, and maybe a little yeasty. It was delicious. Heavy and fizzy with a little alcohol bite and warmth yet quite drinkable considering the high ABV. Great beer. I'd drink more if it weren't so expensive. I stop at two and switch to a lesser beer. I like it."
"I know this has mad rep, but there are definitely better BSPAs out there - this one is just too sharp, spiced (in a wholly overwrought manner) and boozy. The cute-ass bottle goes a long way, sure, but a bit more integration and balance are needed here before this one should be allowed to run with the bulls."
"D: This is a fine brew. I am not the biggest fan of the style but I can appreciate a good beer when I drink one. Not a session beer but nice to sip out of my tulip glass. I'd like to pair this with good food."
"Overall-- you gotta try this if you call yourself a beer fan, regardless on your opinion on Belgian beers because it's unlike anyone you've ever had."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color. This is an alarming amount of suspended material (large chunks of yeast). 3/4 inch head of a white color and good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of sweet/earthy malts and citrus with a slight amount of hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Thick and chewy mouth feel with some associated sweetness and a little bitterness in the aftertaste. There's a high carbonation level present. The alcohol is noticeable, but not so concentrated as to put you off the beer. The citrus flavors are very strong throughout the brew. Malt flavors are strongest up front and slowly decline through the drinking. A little hop bitterness is there, but again not in too strong of a way. Overall, after a few sips this beer gets amazing as far as flavor goes. This is worth a try if you can get past some pretty huge yeast chunks suspended in the brew."
"Pours a pale golden color with a huge bubbly fast fleeting head. Smell is that typical funky smell, oh so inviting. First sip is a creamy yeasty party in your mouth. Bubbly and creamy all at the same time. There is a depth of flavor and complexity here that I can't rightly describe, but I can appreciate it. A bit of apple, or pear taste, I don't quite know, but its fruity. Its like champagne with carbonation, light and flighty. Very drinkable, dangerously so."
"D: Brewed to be sipped."
"Taste: Kind of like a Duvel without the fruitiness or a fresh German lager with more yeastiness. Really refreshing and great."
"A good beer here, a fairly high drinkability, but one has to watch themselves not to drink too much @ 8.5 ABV"
"D- Very good! This one is refreshing, but watch out for the 9%."
"Overall - Very smooth and easy drinking for a brew that's 8.5% ABV. An excellent Belgian Pale ale!"
"I cannot believe I hadn't reviewed this beer. What an outstanding brew this is, one of a kind and none like it. Pours a huge pillowy head, with nice carbonation, but not overly carbonated. Taste is hard to discribe, lemony, zesty, full of life and flavor. Some peppery flavors, as well. Can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Quite pricey and easy to drink do not make a good combo, as one could sift through several in a session. High alcohol content, not detectable. Leaves great lacing down the glass. A beer lover's dream, oh..but hence the name, drink it slowly."
"This beer is very, very drinkable. A very tasty treat. Just keep the ABV in mind when enjoying more than one!"
"I am not a fan of belgian yeasts, but this one is very soft and I loved it."
"I love this beer. Looks beautiful, smells good, tastes great. Very high drinkability. 9% alcohol is hidden extremely well. One of the best ales i've ever had. If you've yet to try it, do yourself a favor and get some immediately."
"I really enjoyed this, but I think a bit more sweetness could have really taken things to a whole new level."
"I have been drinking these for years and will continue to do so. Excellent offering."
"d- phenomenal job of masking the alcohol with delicious flavors. The best job I've seen in a high alcohol beer. This is crisp and biting, like some kind of gourmet spiced tropical fruit dessert. I'm drinking one of these on a cold Iowa winter's evening and it's near perfect. On a hot summer's day after being outside this might be even better. It is almost dangerous how good this stuff is. If you haven't tried it, do so as soon as possible."
"This beer poured a golden color with a big fluffy two-finger head that leaves some aggressive lacing with bits of yeast sediment floating around in it. The scent is a mixture of yeast, slight citrus, and some spices including clove. The taste is starts off with some yeasty citrus gives way to some spices and subtle hops. There is also some warming from the high alcohol content, without any harsh alcohol flavor. As the beer warms the citrus and yeast comes more to the forefront and changes the dynamic. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and crisp, with a slight thickness and light carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the alcohol content, a great beer to get as a treat. This is one of the ones that most people interested in beer will try eventually, and will almost certainly enjoy."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is good, it went down smooth. Carbonation is lacking a teeny bit but it's not something that would depreciate the brew. A nice alcohol warmth compliments the finish. Interesting beer, I've had better Belgian strongs however. Again, there was just something about the smell that put me off - I can't place it. Worth a try though."
"Nice complex flavor, good atmosphere, really strong feel. Strong alcohol taste, but a light feel in the mouth. Good sipping brew. Great quaff. If you like this style, get it."
"The carbonation in my bottle was medium-high, which I also liked. All-in-all, a very fine find!"
"Will buy again."
"An excellent beer - highly recommended!"
"A beautiful golden straw color is capped by a long-lasting soapy head. A slightly sour smell and taste that is hard to describe but once you smell it again you know what it is. This beer will leave you feeling completely stoned."
"a flamboyant beer that isn't as balanced and refined as duvel, but is still tasty and dangerously alluring, esp. with its seductive fruity esters."
"Delirium Tremens is a hazy, quite sparkling, golden ale with small particles floating in it. It has a foamy white head that shows good retention and leaves good lacing. The aroma has notes of sugar, barnyard, leather, nutmeg and candy, like Mike & Ikes. It is medium-full bodied; soft and smooth with a dry finish. It has a very full flavor that's slightly sweet. There are notes of leather, black pepper, apple and phenol. It has a warm, boozy aftertaste. Quite classic!"
"D- Drink extremely well for the large 8.5%ABV"
"Overall: I've seen this brew advertised as ""the best beer in the world"" but I have to respectfully disagree. Delirium tremens is really quite nice for the style and has it's complexities but I've had superior Belgian ales and even better American made Belgian style ales. The being said this is still a damn good beer and I recommend it, especially if you're into Belgians."
"D=a bit too pricey but otherwise good if not slightly heavy."
"One of my least favorite popular Belgian beers. This is very good beer, but I can't see ever buying it again. I've had it probably six or so times, and I always have a similar opinion. First, the beer is over-carbonated. It's not a bad looking beer, but the head generally doesn't always stick around when it's actually in the glass, as opposed to when it's crawling its way out of the top of the bottle. To a certain extent, the beer looks and tastes like orange soda. I do enjoy the flavor, but it's very one note, in my opinion. On top of that, comparisons to the Duvel are hard to avoid, and DT loses in that matchup. DT seems to lose a matchup against any of the top widely distributed Belgians. Ok, any of the strong Belgians, oh Leffe. Anyway, I love the bottle and the glass. I don't know how it ages, but I would be happy to try a vintage bottle to see if the complexity goes up as the age does. This is a beer that is simply good while most of its competition is great."
"D - I drank a 750ml bottle of this, and that was plenty. I finished it gladly, however I wouldn't drink more than two 12 ouncers of this unless I was really in the mood and willing to spend some money."
"Quaffable with a light nose, but ultimately unsatisfying for the price"
"Drinkability - very good, a beer this smooth, this fresh, this light, and this tasty would be easy to drink several of; although with the steep ABV and price, it might be a decision you would regret in the morning."
"Incredibly crisp from start to finish, with an overwhelming sense of refreshment, but a little bit too bubbly"
"D: Higher on tap than in the bottle. This is one to sip and savor, but I could definitely put down a few glasses at the beginning or end of a session."
"Pours a cloudy pale. Yellowish. Super creamy head that flows out of the bottle during the pop, without even shaking it. Smells and looks like a hefeweizen. Tastes banana, tropical. Citric. Extremely refreshing, great summer beer."
"D: Alcohol is high, but nicely hidden. I wouldn't have trouble drink some of them but the high ABV will slow me down some day."
"Drinkability - Even highly carbonated, it goes down fairly easy. With such a crisp, clean taste, it's hard not to drink this faster. At the same time, though, there is a lot of carbonation, and the higher ABV keeps it away from being sessionable."
"Drinkability: Nice beer but I'm not as impressed as others are. I wish it didn't have the floaties as it really turned me off to drinking it."
"D - One of my favorite, worth a try, well-balanced, really in the style"
"Been looking forward to this one for a while, and with a name like Delirium Tremens it's got to be good right? Don't know, but we'll soon find out. A deep, dense off-white head rises quickly above this golden brew. From the middle of the bottom of the tulip a column of swift bubbles rises which keeps the head intact for a while. Circling the bubbles is an army of sediment soldiers. After the head decides to fade a deep sheet of pocked lacing is left behind. Smells bready, sweet, spicy and phenolic. Tastes of sweet malts, dried fruits, florals, yeasts and bananas. There's a good, welcomed hit of alcohol heat in the throat. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied, and there's big carbonation as the aforementioned stream is still going fairly strong, although a bit abated. Excellent."
"Delirium is lightly hopped and surprisingly malty for such an airy, sunshine beer. Goes down exceptionally smooth considering the high abv. Litterly could drink it all night (might be in rough shape though) The first smell is fruity almost hefe-like. Also has a first taste of bananna like a hefe as well. I've had it on tap and in the bottle ( perferred on tap) Nice and creamy. I can't wait to try the Noctrum"
"This is joining the regular rotation."
"Drinkability: At 9% ABV, this is a sipper, but one which I could sip perhaps all night...."
"Overall: next"
"A very solid Belgian, though next time I'll perhaps opt for a smaller nightcap!"
"This is good shit. That much is for sure. That said, you can't put back much of this tasty beer in one sitting. The abv will quickly catch up to you and throttle the hell out of you. For what it is, it's fantastic, though."
"In conclusion, this may be a popular beer because of the elephant logo, but I truly enjoy this beer and the flavors it presents."
"Clear straw yellow, pretty carbonated, and heady. Light lacing. Looks pretty. The silly glass is a little over the top."
"Overall: Not what I expected at all, in a good way! Very high alcohol content that you can barely tell. Really explosive light beer. Recommended!"
"Not to beat a dead horse.... but please respect beer! This fine, fine brew was totally disrespected in my eyes today. And at $8 for an 8oz (which was not specified on the menu, by the way) I feel totally taken. In fact, I even had to order another, simpler beer to wash away my liquid sorrows. Such is the life of the beer guy."
"A bit pricey, but is a most pleasurable experience. Quite unique. I think I will get the 750mL next time instead of the miniscule 11.2oz."
" The presentation is great too, a unique bottle with a great lable, the pink elephant's, dragon's and strutting crocodile's are classic."
"so, do you like sparkling cider? I do! it rules! in fact, that is exactly what this beer reminds me of! looks like it, pours like it, smells like it. except, this will get you drunk!!"
"D: Would definitely not expect this to be the 9? abv that it is; hides it well."
"I felt that this beer was a little overrated and built up into something spectacular, but still enjoyable."
"Poured a clear golden with little to no head. Fruity and full of other flavors and aromas that I can't put my finger on. A little nip of alcohol, but nothing to turn me away from this beer. The smoothness and high alcohol mixture can make a couple of these sneak up on you, but that isn't that bad of a thing in this case. Interesting packaging as well. One of my favorite Belgian Strong Ales."
"Kraig"
"D: for 9% this is very drinkable but there was something about it that made it just good and not excellent for me"
"D: A good Belgian beer. Good to sip on, more flavor than a dubbel would have but Im sure that one at a time is good enough for me."
"Poured a cloudy, light orange with a good head and lace down the glass. A citric hop smell hit me first, slong with some other fruit, dark and tropical and some minor malt sweetness. Smooth and balanced on the whole with a medium body and alright carbonation. While there are a lot of fruits in the taste, apple, orange, pear, berries, there are also some figs and a caramel/honey syrupy sweetness and texture on the outside of the beer. Also had some spiciness to it, and a little sour crispness with some of the fruit taste. Finishes warming and with a spicy fruit taste. A pretty good pale ale, although a tad sour for my liking."
"Overall this is a solid Belgian with a cool logo. I can see myself ordering this again, and it's definitely worth a shot."
"Nice drinkability for a 9% abv- it is not noticable."
"Nice golden color but the head is the key to appearance on this one. Creamy white head with sticky lace. Bubbles are so fine that it looks like a layer of whipped cream on the top, not foamy or bubbly at all. Smell of mild fruityness, bananna, apple, apricot. Not very bold on the nose but mild and subdued. Some yeastyness and a little spice show up also. Taste has a little more umph than the smell. Same mild fruityness and spice just more noticable. 9% is well hidden. Full body with a smooth finish. There is no doubt that this is a quality brew with no flaws. The flavor profile is not as in your face as many of the extreame beers but is very full in a somehow subdued way. A great sipper to take your time with and enjoy what shows itself with each sip. This is one I will go for every now and then."
"decent brew and glad I tried but I can't see me buying another."
"Decent beer, not what I was expecting though"
"D: Avoided this beer for a while because I thought the ""Delirium Tremens"" was simply an advertising ploy, however, this beer is very good and deserves a sampling by all advocates."
"I poured it in a tulip glass and was delighted by the brillant yellow color. The yeast sediment was easy to get over. The sutle smell is is decieving when you actually taste it. The taste was a really punch in the taste buds. I could taste bits of honey, citrus, and slight clove. There are alomst too many tastes to be experienced here. I finished the bottle in one sitting. A delightful strong ale (8.5 ABV) that is well worth trying at least once, regaurdless of the high price."
"The beer pours a yellowish golden hazy color with a thin cap of foam. The aroma is malty and spicy with fruit, clove and yeast. Medium bodied on the palate with some prickly carbonation. The flavors are sweet and phenolic and fruit. Spice provides some balance toward the end. A Belgian ale for sure, and a good one at that. Would have again."
"A very light and pleasant mouthfeel. Drink up! this one is a keeper!"
"An all around very good beer, If you can get past the yeast sediment this is well worth the try."
"Easy mouthfeel, considering its ABV & overall puunch in aroma & flavour this has some serious drinkability - I could have gone through quite a few without looking elsewhere."
"Very drinkable, doesn't feel very heavy, refreshing."
"A refreshing beer that is an easy one to sit for a session with."
"Notes: It reminded me of (but is not the same as, of course) Duvel. I can see why some source named it ""the best beer in the world"" even though I have others that I prefer above it. I highly recommend this beer. In fact, everyone should at least try this beer once."
"Definitely a beer I'd recommend and will definitely continue to drink both on tap and in the bottle."
"Pours a beautiful and brilliantly clear yellow gold in color with a little over a finger of dense white head that retreated rather quickly. Pleasant aroma, lots of esters with some phenols and just a hint of malt character. The esters are mostly pears, some green apples, and maybe just a touch of banana. The phenols are restrained and slightly spicy/peppery. There is also a light floral character, possibly from some later hopping or from the esters, I can't really say. It is quickly becoming evident that the yeast is the star of the show. The yeast character is, however, not overwhelming as all of the esters, phenols, and alcohols it produced coexist quite well and exhibit an excellent balance of flavors. The taste is much like the aroma with the emphasis on the fruity esters. Pears and green apples are present and dominant but not overwhelming throughout. Towards the finish the spicy/peppery phenols return and take over but soon yield to a pleasant floral/fruity character that lingers long into the finish. A solid but not domineering bitterness builds and crescendos at the finish but still plays in the background. A soft malt character that compliments the other flavor components quite well, comes and goes. Carbonation is a bit more than moderate but not quite as high as i would have expected for the style. Body is relatively light. Smooth alcohol an a somewhat dry finish. The alcohol is failrly hard to detect and sneaks up on you a bit. Drinkability is good, very quaffable and relatively complex. This brew is somewhat more restrained than others of the style but is thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Yep."
"D - There isn't much that takes away from it's drinkability besides the high abv. Overall a very good Belgian Ale."
"Poured from the tap into a small tulip glass. Pours a golden color and has a nice 1 inch white head and great lacing. The smell is sweet banana, a variety of spices and a touch of well hidden alcohol. The mouthfeel is of medium body and is nicely carbinated. I can taste fruit, yeast, some sour flavors and alcohol as it warmed up. Highly recommended, this beer was the best beer on tap that night by far."
"I poured the 750 ml bottle into 2 over sized wine glasses. It pours a pale yellow with a pretty, fluffy white head. The head leaves lots of lacing as the beer is consumed. The beer smells of ripe fruit(apricots?) with a hint of alchohol. The taste follows the nose, very well balanced. The beer is medium bodied, and suprisingly drinkable for its 9%ABV. Overall, a great beer!"
"I would enjoy this brew much more if their hadn't been so much yeast. I carefully tried to decant this bottle, but the chunks came out long before i even reached the halfway point. I prefer my BSPAs decanted, as the yeast brings too much of a chalky flavor, and drying effect in the mouth. Otherwise, it's a damn tasty brew. I would have it again, but maybe let it age upright for a few months/years."
"D- another dangerous D. i thought the pink elephant thing was a joke, but they're everywhere. on the walls, the ceiling... coming from the woodwork, the vents... ""gettin the shakes now. last call for drinks, bars closin down. suns out. where we goin for breakfast? don't wanna go far...rough night. tired baby, tired."""
"Overall - I love the name of this brew. Delirium Tremens... ""the jitters"". A beer this good should have a warning: drinking too much of this for a prolonged time will give you extreme withdrawal symptoms. I would sip this all the time. Such a great beer. My only complain is that the taste department could use a tiny boost. Can't wait to try Delirium Nocturnum..."
"Overall, a very nice beer, so far, it is my favorite offering from Brouwerij Huyghe."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Flavors are great, and alcohol isn't noticeable. Just easy drinking, a great time for sure."
"Overall a very tasty brew, a couple others I would pick before this one for this category. High ABV makes for a couple in a setting probably the limit."
"D - A beguiling, complicated beer that is difficult to pinpoint. Could be dangerous, as it would be all too easy to have a couple."
"Pours a unique orangy color with a fluffy head that is off-white. The nose is very fruity and delicious! Mainly peaches, apples, and spices are accompanied by a touch of alcohol. The flavor is huge. Light fruits dominate the nose, along with some spices and yeast. This is a fantastic beer! I cannot wait to try Nocturnum"
"D - Dangerously drinkable at any time of year, but with its 9% ABV one needs to exercise caution. Wonderful stuff."
"pours up an unfiltered, dark hay color with a big soapy white head. the nose is bubblegum!, yeast, lemon. The taste is of bubblegum!, and the taste of pineapple!? this beer is amazing!! subtle lemons, full bodied, medium carbo. delicious. I love this beer. its good all year around"
"Great!"
"With that being said, this is an exciting, head-turning, fun, different beer. I predict it has mass appeal. Let's put it this way--my fiance, who does not like beer, sort of likes this one. Good or bad thing? I say good."
"Poured into a tulip glass from a 750 ml corked bottle. The beer poured a hazy yellowish color with a light white head. Cleary a large amount of carbonation present. Large particles of yeast were clearly present in the beer. Good aroma to the beer with fruity hints, but the flavor was kind of a mix between a hefe and a belgian. The beer felt good, good carbonation, with a medium body. Overall, a good beer that is very drinkable."
"It pours out with a thick, white bubbly head that's about three and a half fingers thick and is very fluffy and sticks around for quit a while. The head covers a light golden colored body that fairly hazy and has some very active carbonation. It has a strong fruity aroma, some lemon spices and a nice alcohol aroma all mixed in. It has a clean smooth feel to it, its got a medium body and the alcohol isn't detectable until its aftertaste, which is also a bit tart. It has a sharp carbonation feel when it first hits your tongue, the spices a very noticeable as was the hop bitterness; very little citrus fruits flavors on the tip of your tongue."
"Drink ability= A good beer, but not one I could have very night. This doesn't seem to be a session beer, a bit to complex for that."
"This is an overall good beer that is great on a hot spring/summer day. I recommend this beer to any beer lover."
"D: Pour me another."
"On the lighter side for a Belgian, as far as I'm concerned. But, still a very pleasant beer. White wine-like in some ways. I'm glad I bought into the bizarre marketing on the bottle and went for it."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Nice summer brew sitting out enjoying the day. At 8.5% it packs a punch that creeps up on you. Not much alcohol taste to it. I prefer the nocturnum however."
"Crisply carbonated and not too full bodied, the drinkability is very high for this one."
"Drinkability: Seems quite drinkable for the style with the exception of the sourness. I think that's intentional though and it does add a layer of complexity to what would otherwise be a bland example of this style. I recommend picking this up anyway because if you enjoy the style, you won't be disappointed with this choice."
"Somewhat drinkable, although the sourness gets you after a while."
"Pours clear bright gold with a medium white head. Nice lacing on the sides and surface. Aroma is somewhat phenolic with some yeastiness and tang. Apples and maraschino cherries. Taste has a muted sweetness. Earthy and herbal. Some tangy citrus as well. Bananas. A little lingering bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation. Very drinkable. Overall this is very good. Really well balanced. Tasty and complex."
"Delicious and balanced but strong."
"What more can I say. Read more reviews for a more refined palate or nose but I know this is one great beer. Checked out the website for this brewery and their little bar in Belgium looks cool. Very unique decor with pink elephants hanging around an almost art deco 50's style."
"D: very drinkable. tasty, refreshing. slight alcohol warmth actually feels nice and lends well to the other characteristics."
"d: one of the better Belgians that is widely available in the US. a great beer that is very deceptive, watch out for the booze. Great label too."
"Haven't had this in a while, but it's much better than I remember it being and is now definitely back in the rotation."
"Not my favorite, I do enoy Belgian's, but this is more like a wheat beer on roids. Not feeling it. I can appreciate it for its high quality craftsmanship, but I'll skip this again."
"Drinkability: A sipper for me, I'll go slowly with one."
"Very nice beer. I love to pull this one out every now and then."
"I cracked the top open and poured this into my Duvel tulip. A thick, pillowey, 2 inch layer of foam quickly rises up. Great retention, decent lacing. The scent is very intriguing; spicy and metallic all at the same time. I'm not sure what to make of that, but I like it! As far as the taste goes, the spice shines through but the metallic notes not so much (which I am thankful for). Highly carbonated, very zesty, and extremely effervescent! This would be ideal on a hot day, but might want to watch out for the 9% though."
"Drinkability is jsut average. I don't know why, but I can never drink a great amount of this beer."
"Recommended."
"Great on a hot summer day or on a fall evening with a holiday meal."
"D- A great beverage that if cheaper I think I could almost drink all the time, surprisingly refreshing, enjoyable flavor. Overall a great brew that everyone should try at least once."
"I enjoy the Tremens most on a hot day. Sessionable for me. Even with the 9%."
"Superbly smooth and drinkable, this medium-bodied beauty is very refreshing and hides the ABV very well."
"This beer is a very very good belgian strong ale. It has a golden color with a pillowy loaf of bread for head...that my girl friend commented was maybe too thick. Smells estery with some sort of spice I can't quite place my finger on. Tastes a lot like Allagash's Triple Reserve only a little lower key for the flavors. Very estery/fruity almost sugary flavor with good bready qualities and a corriander like spice. Drinks very well and is refreshing despite the 8.5%."
"D: A solid example that wont disappoint. Crisp, light and refreshing. very worthy of a recommend."
"Subtle and tasty and more alcohol than it seems."
"The pink elephants told me to try this one and why not since I already enjoyed Nocturnum and Noel? Thank goodness I don't suffer from delirium tremens I think there are some pink elephants floating in my glass though. Had this one at a wine, food, and beer tasting at the local ABC liquors. Poured a grand golden honey color with fizzy lifting bubbles in it. Smelled yeasty and fruity but no pink elephant musk. Taste was genuine Belgian strong ale: banana, drak cherry, cloves, and mild spice. I love a good complex Belgian even if I have to fight off the pink elephants to get to one!"
"D: Very drinkable. It is not overpowering in any one area and it blends very well together. It also does not feel as big of a beer it is. Very nice."
"D: Drinkability is actually quite good, particularly for the style and the strength. Really nice flavor-mild but does enough to not be boring. Could probably drink a few pints of this without being too bad off. A good Belgian for a nice summer night here in SoCal..."
"I enjoy the delicate spice and light malt, but maybe a tad mellow compared to some other BSPAs."
"A phenomenally delicious beer with a soft Belgian funk on a delicately beautiful malty sweetness; this is what life is about."
"Certainly not a bad beer by any stretch, but any of this style are going to be compared, whether fairly or not, against the Duvel. Well, the Tremens certainly is pleasant enough, but lacks the depth, dense carbonation and complex flavors of that beer titan. Still, grab one and enjoy. Hell, grab a couple."
"Pours golden with a light head that sticks around as a cap. Smells yeasty and with notes of clove and banana as well as a sweet breadiness. Taste is similar with lots of banana. Very smooth and a bit light and a bit sweet. Just a very pleasant beer without being all that complicated."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden, big thick white head forms, drops some nice lacing, great retention, keeps a solid layer. Smell is nice, sweet, sugary, floral, some spice, yeast, bit of banana, very fresh aroma, honey, nice. Taste is similar, quite sweet, lots of light fruit and banana, wheat, yeast, spices, alcohol comes through, nice fresh floral/herbal hoppiness, bit of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, very smooth and refreshing."
"D: Highly drinkable, I think letting it breath for few minutes let some the of aromatics out. At the local Central Market this beer usually sells out the same day a new shipment arrives and I can see why."
"drinkability is good. fairly nice balance with light spice and well hidden alcohol."
"Drinkability: Light, crisp and balanced. This one always leaves you wanting another. I see where the delirum can set in..."
"Solid beer, and easy to drink, so watch out for that alcohol content."
"Quite an easy drinker, and far from what I remember it as. The body is medium, and not too heavy even if the alcohol is above average. A nice drinker to mix in with other Belgians."
"Tried this on tap at The Otheroom in NYC. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip glass. Pretty large white fluffy head. Golden yellow color with a bit of haze. A touch of spice and sugar in the nose. Taste was awesome. It's been a long time since I've had one, and I forgot how good this beer tastes. Borders on the sweet taste of a nice Belgian tripel. The abv is a bit noticeable, but that's not always a bad thing. I could easily polish off a few of these. A classic Belgian offering."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation. Goes down easily, but high ABV means this is not a beer to quaff, or face the repercussions."
"D--Not a chugger. Pleasant but not overly easy going down."
"I give this one top scores for originality. Not a huge fan of beers this heavily carbonated. Drinkability is affected somewhat due to this, but I must say that as I reached the bottom of the glass, I wished there was more. I am glad I tried this one and would highly recommend this, but for the price, I am not sure how much more I will be buying unless I find myself in Belgium. I look forward to trying their Nocturnum."
"Still very drinkable. If not for the borderline ridiculous price I had to pay for a single bottle of this at my local store, I would have gone back and bought a few more"
"D- This beer is a lil thick. Not too much so though that it is hard to put down. It does put up a good fight though. This isnt something you drink all night. One or two of these on a nice occassion."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, it's a good beer but it's not the first one that I would choose."
"Pours a silky white head atop a golden body with what looks like fruit pulp flowing freely with copious carbonation. Has a good apple and lemon aroma. The taste is much the same and you certainly cannot tell that it's 9%. The mouthfeel is... weird... it is both strongly carbonated yet smooth from the yeast and what not that floats freely. To be honest, I can't really decide where I stand on the beer. I do know that it is way overpriced and I certainly hold that against it."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. Served in a small glass but very nice on the palate and worth revisiting."
"t is a golden almost straw colored beer with a thick two finger brilliant white head that hangs around for the long haul. I poured it before I ate and 10 minutes later it was still there. There are visible flecks of yeast floating around the commotion caused by the constant bubbling. The smell mostly belgian funk. There is also a cidery aroma that comes through. If someone didn't know what they were smelling, you might almost be able to convince them it was cider. The taste is much better than the smell. It is a very light and sweet beer with some good yeasty fruity flavors. I would certainly drink this again"
"Not a bad beer, but it doesn't really do much for me. Though it is worth a try."
"This is my favorite belgian ale I have tried. I tend to like to the Noel a bit over the Tremens from this brewery, however they are both great in my opinion. I will definitely return to this many times in the future."
"I would go out on a hunch and say try it with spicy Thai or Vietnamese. Or maybe game bird in a dark sauce. Me, I had it on its own. It paired extremely well with the billiard cue I had in the other hand."
"Thanks to Patra for this wonderful birthday gift. This one bubbled up right out of the bottle as I opened it. It poured a nice golden blond color with an aggressive foamy white head. Little bits of yeast sediment were floating in the beer that was otherwise clear. The aroma has lovely notes of yeast, sweet fruits and spice. The flavor doesn't disappoint. Doughy yeast and malts mix with sweet fruits, pineapple and candy. The body is medium and the carbonation is lively. Overall it's very refreshing yet complex. Very good I must have more!"
"Thin on the palate, and a little fizzy, but quite drinkable."
"The taste is lightly sweet with a pronounced, but pleasant, smooth, alcoholquality and warmth, especially in the finish. It has the same qualities roughly as the aroma. In the end, it's wonderfully njoyable and interesting, yet light and smooth to drink."
"D: A decent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Decent beer overall, but alcohol may get to you later. Definitely worth a session with it."
"Notes:A great brew and one that I can say is worth the bang for the buck. Man is it spicy."
"The entry here says the abv is 9.00%, however, my bottle says 8.50%, I do not know if I got a different type, my bottle looks exactly the same as the one here."
"The fresh citrus aroma and flavour are knocking me out. Dynamite stuff. It's missing the sweetness of a tripel, but has the fruitiness I find is missing from some of the drier examples (Duvel). Just a wonderful beer to drink."
"Poured into a golden colored ale. The aroma has some very strong citrousy notes. The beer is very sweet with notes of fruit produced by active yeast. Some bitterness is noted, however, more would be welcomed. Certainly a very good beer. Recommended to all."
"D - You can absolutely down these. Which is scary due to its content, which can certainly sneak up on you. This beer won't fill you up and the taste never gets old."
"D = Very nice beer. While the alcohol level is fairly high, it's still a nice and refreshing beer. I just wouldn't have more than one, maybe two, in one sitting."
"This pours a glowing golden tangerine with several fingers worth of white fluffieness that has good hang time and leaves some nice lacing.The nose is full of juicy fresh fruits,spice,and yeast.Peaches and pears are upfront on the tounge closly surrounded by cloves,alcohol,and other spices too.The mouth is medium bodied and peppery,with a pallet coating quality that is in a league all its own,a single sip can be a five minute expierience.This is a very nice BSPA,I would not recommend drinking this when operating heavy machinery,it's a creeper!!"
"Looks alot like a German Hefe, golden orange. Floating yeast everywhere, very exciting. It has a strong aroma of exotic fruits and some spices. Taste is sweet and is like a extreme hefe taste, until there is a dry spell which is accompanied by some belgian funk. Very nice as a nightcap/relaxing beer."
"Overall very drinkable, not too sweet not too hoppy, nicely balanced. if not for the high alcohol content, I'd be happy to drink more than one at a sitting. A classic Belgian Pale Ale."
"Drinks well, despite fairly high alcohol content."
"D = A good easy drinking Belgian. Definitely worth it."
"M/D - Very crisp and clean brew. Warming alcohol presence in it as well."
"This as sat at the back of my stash since 1991 and i thought by now it would be undrinkable but boy was i surprised...unique and boy that aroma!"
"I had been looking forward to trying this beer for a while, having heard good things about it. It poured a light clear yellow with thin head, almost like a pilsner. It smelled like wild yeast and strong lemon tang (very similar to Merry Monks). It tasted like sweet sugary yeast and hops with very little bitterness, and the sweet aftertaste lingered. The texture was very smooth with practically no carbonation. The light Belgian ales aren't really my thing (I want to try Delirium Nocturnum), so I can't say that I particularly enjoyed it. This was well done for its style, though."
"M&D: The body of this brew is relatively light and quite carbonated. The carbonation is abundant and persistent, with large bubbles reminiscent of soda pop. Despite the bubbles, it goes down quite smoothly. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Highly recommended!!"
"D- High ABV, but a nice end of night drink, a good replacement for champagne. Very tasty, highly recommended."
"I haven't been totally impressed with many of the belgian beers I've tried, but this one is quite nice."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color into a Tremens glass with at least a three finger white foamy head that took a while to go down. The smell was of lemons, oranges, and honey. It tasted the same. The citrus flavor was key some grapefruit even coming through with this beer. A very delicious beer indeed. I could definitely use this as a session beer."
""
"M/D: Carbonation is pretty high in a light to medium body, mostly dry. Drinkability is nice on this one, very solid beer."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. For a relatively high alcohol beer this one flies under the radar, much like its counterpart, Duvel. I would like the pear/apple flavor to be more subtle but all in all a winner."
"A little too yeasty for my taste."
"I recommend this beer to anyone who likes big Belgian ales."
"I have been looking foward to a Delerium brew for quite a while. Had a taste of the Nocturnium and procured this earlier. Pours out a superbly foamy head, rises out of the top of my chalice for a full 30 seconds at least. Active carbon ation bubbling away under the huge pillow the beer has produced. Wow what a snapshot BSPA. Somewhat hazy beautiful golden-straw color. Smells of yeast,tart lemony aromas. Biting on the tongue, flavors of lemony-apricots, cherries, slight burn in the throat. Very long sweetish aftertaste that is cut pleasently by the tartness and carbonation. Wow, one of the bes example of this style I have sampled thusfar I must say. I believe I will take the Noel out of cellaring and refrigerate for soon consumption. $16.99 for a four pack of this-Hell yes!"
"Poured into a Delirium snifter. Pours a straw yellow, with a haze to it. Beautiful solid white head on top that retains about a half of an inch, which eventually leads to great lacing. Sharp and sweet aromas, sweet breakfast malts, almost has a sour aroma reminding me of Calabaza Blanca from Jolly Pumpkin. It could just be an off bottle. Sweet flavors of raisins, honey, and winter spices. Some sour flavors in the finish. Very high carbontion, smooth mouthfeel, the sweets hit the palate perfectly. Very drinkable, and very enjoyable. I actually enjoyed the slight sourness."
"Bottle in a Delirium Tremens glass. Clove, orange aroma with yeasty bready and alcohol components noticable as well. Slightly cloudy gold/orange color with thick, frothy, mostly lasting off-white head and some lacing. Lots of fine bubbles coming up from bottom of glass. Lots of alcohol in flavor along with bitterness, clove, and orange with slight sweetness and acidity. ""Belgian"" character was subdued but definitely present. Medium carbonation, Short, dry finish with aftertaste of alcohol, bitterness and slight sweetness/sourness."
"Served in my Maudite snifter (11.2 oz. bottle). Poured a murky golden orange with a voluminous white head and bits of yeast floating in the solution. Head was extremely fluffy with excellent retention that finally subsided into a thin layer of foam and begian ringlets. Some lacing, but somewhat spotty. Spicy nose with the presence of clove, citrus fruit and belgian yeast. Taste similar to nose with the additional presence of lemon zest. Extremely lively mouthfeel. Very effervescent across the entire tongue and mouth, but a little too much burn. Alcohol was very well-hidden, with a clean, crisp astringency at the end. Very drinkable brew, but be careful because experience has taught me that a couple of these sneaks up on you pretty fast."
"This beer tastes great but the expense and ABV will make it a very infrequent purchase for me."
"This is definitely a drinkable beer. Very vibrant, refreshing and easy to drink."
"This is a very interesting beer for me as it is my first Belgian strong Pale Ale. I really like it. Others around me at the bar thought it was wierd, but I'll definitely drink again."
"Very good beer, great example of Belgian pales."
"d: very strong predominant alcohol flavor but at the same time the flavors are pretty enjoyable; definitely a good strong beer"
"I really enjoyed this and plan to follow up with a few more next time I make a run for Belgians."
"Giant, fluffy head which dissipates suprisingly fast. Pale golden color w/lots of ""chunks"" (just how I like it!). Aroma is fruity w/notes of apple and citrus, also a bit spicy. Mouthfeel is light-medium, which I like in a Belgian as it tends to hold up better as the beer warms. Taste closely matches the aroma, citrusy and spicy, very refreshing, somewhat tart beer. Like most Belgian beers, drinkability is good given its complexity (and 8.5% ABV). If you like Duvel and other Belgians, chances are you'll like DT."
"Pours a clear yellow/light orange and bubbly as hell. Good fluffy head that retains quite well and leaves some lace. A few sediment chunks in here despite a careful pour. Nose is spicy with some fruitiness. Taste is fruity with good spice. fruits through the middle. A very dry finish with the slightest bit of vinous flavor. The mouthfeel is thicker than one would expect, which I prefer. Drinkability is good but a little bit abrasive b/c of the excessive carbonation. This is a great beer. I am a bigger fan of the nocturnum and the noel, but this one is also a classic decision when you just dont feel like shopping for a while in the beer store."
"Pours a pale gold with a short white head, a fair bit of lacing as well. Nose is not as complex as I would expect, mostly floral hops, slight sweetness, alcohols. Taste follows with the same, mainly hoppy and heady. A good option for when you still want some good ABV but not all the weight of a normal Belgian."
"The bottom line: If you like Belgian Pales then Tremens is a standard. It's not one of my absolute top tier favourites, but if you're in the mood for a Belgian pale, then you can do a lot worse than this."
"Great beer, one I'd be remiss not to both recommend and look to cellar."
"Definitely wont be my last delirium."
"Before I started to drink great beer, one of my friends told me that this was one of the better beer's the world of beer had to offer. This was a girl who is four/five years older than I am and has a palate in beer I respect more-than-significantly; while I was still unable to get into PG-13 movies she was bringing six packs of microbrew to college parties; in short, she, without knowing it, served as a guide to the beer advocate I am today. I can't write about this beer without straying into a mini-autobiography, mentioning my closest friends in the same breathes as my favorite beers. Whether it serves as the reason to start drinking good beer, the first beer I was legally served at one of the better beer bars in all of the country or a constant I can always go to when I want to be reminded of why I drink beer, this is a beer that never fails to deliver. Can I drink it all night? Abso-frekin-lutely. Will I regret it in the morning? (see the first rhetorical question). Do I care? Not so much. In the end, as a chick flick once said, you just want to be with the ones you love. You get a 5.0 Delirium Tremens."
" ~ This is the second Delirium I've had and I have to say, it will not be the last. It is a fine beer and I urge others to enjoy it as well. WJVII and drizzam, that means you guys!"
"Overall experience: I would love to be able to afford this beer all the time...but I can't"
"330 ml from local BJs. I just love the fact they serve belgians there and the menu is secret from most patrons. Poured nice golden color with slightly foamy, white head. Nose had hint of bananas with cooked cane sugar. Taste was excellent! Cane sugar, granny apple finish with, that slight bit of belgian sourness. The mouthfeel was warm, but not of alcohol. Definitely would drink another if I didn't want to sample other Belgians."
"has the consistency of a beer half it's strength without the kick of alcohol i tend to expect. this beer is dangerously drinkable, really. incredibly light on it's feet with great subtlety and deft balance. oh, and a slight whiff of belgian funk."
"D - This is a good after dinner beer to sip and relax with worth a try"
"drinkability - This is a great beer on tap. I should buy some of this in the bottle too. Great beer."
"After hearing much about this beer, was really interested in sampling it... saw it in various ""great beers of the world books"" and its attractive presentation in a marble-like white bottle (supposed to prevent exposure to sunlight), with elegant blue foil and cork piqued my curiosity... the brewery's website claims that this might be ""the world's best beer""... paid $8.99 for this from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Beautiful appearance... golden blonde with rising carbonation and huge frothy head... has a distinctly sweet bubblegum aroma that peeps out immediately after popping the cork... great fruity, honey-like aroma... taste was a ""perfect five""... awesome... has a champagne-like characteristic to it... a very smooth, crisp, Belgian Pale Ale, and although ""strong"" might apply to its 8.5% ABV, you would never detect the alcohol behind a flavor so sweet and satisfying... one of my all time faves... a great beer... Definitely recommended..."
"Served far too cold and waited for this beer to warm. The neat thing about waiting for this beer to warm is that you can actually smell the floral bouquet coming to life on this. This pours a bright yellow approaching a golden color with a small white head that left good lacing on the glass until the end. The scent is really complex on this with dominate scents of citrus fruit, fruity esters, and some slight pear scents, and Belgian sugars work nicely together. Immediate flavors are fruity and spicy. Apples and orange peels are the first fruits that I pick out along with strong spiciness and pepper. The mouthfeel is quite effervescent, crisp, light, and bubbly. The warmth of the alcohol is well hidden, but you can taste it in the finish. Drink ability is good and actually dangerously easy."
"I don't know what to say more about this brew... just not a whole lot going on that I was expecting. I've had it numerous times over the years, but maybe my mind is remembering a better brew... nothing wrong with it.. just could be better.... and yes, I reviewed this one at just cooler than cellar temperature."
"This was a drinkable beer and would be very accessible to people who aren't familiar with Belgian beers. I tried it because I'd read it was voted 'Best Beer in the World.' I don't think I'd go that far."
"The head lasts forever."
"Light bodied, but definitely a high alcohol beer based on its warming power. Wow...this is nice. I could easily drink the whole 750, but I poured it to share."
"Pours cloudy gold with a white head. Very yeasty nose with a slight sweet and citric edge to it. Eck. Flavor is bordering on extremely tart, though on the second sip, you are used to it. Smooth and even, though it exhibits a very strong alcohol presence. Feel is just where you want it. Though the drinkability suffers due to the more noticeable amount of the alcohol involved (that is not masked as well as it could be). Been waiting to try this one for some time, and it is good."
"There's more spices on the palate. Notes of spiced fruits (if there is such a thing), pale malt, crisp bitterness and floral hops."
"Clean finish on it considering the yeast presence. A nice beer, I'd like to try it on tap sometime."
"Drinkability - Good. The 9% ABV is well hidden. Has a nice refreshing quality to it. Recommended."
"A pretty damn good BSPA."
"This is probably a good example of the style but again I don't care much for Belgians. I want to try as much as I can though and I'm glad I got to try this one. Just not for me."
"in enjoy this beer enough to keep it around the house."
"Apparently at the time of serving they were out of proper glassware so it came in a pint glass, which actually work fairly well. There was a nice fluffy white head and some lacing. The aroma, was an interesting mix of white grape, bubble gum, and lemon juice. Those carried over into the flavor with the addition of subtle, creamy spice. Definitely an interesting beer here, and you really can't ask for much more than that sometimes."
"Bright yellow with a big white head. Smells of apples and other fruit. Tastes mainly of apples. Too sweet for me, like I'm drinking apple cider. Lots of carbonation and fizzing on the palate. I got through one bottle, but I don't know when I'd feel like another. The bottle looks cool, though."
"Ideally, I'd have just one smaller 330ml bottle (do they make this?), but I'll probably finish the whole bottle."
"I poured this expensive overpriced wash into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a great pile of a head and was very nice. Smell was bready and I thought this might be great blond ale. Taste was terrible though, it was a bit spicey but had a sour taste that just was not good to me. Now if you like a belgian ale you should try it I guess, but for me I will not buy again."
"Don't drink and review."
"pours a very very very cloudy pale light golden color. it has tons of sediment in it, more than i think any other beer i've had except for some wierd australian beer i had once. smell is good, fruit and yeast and alcohol. taste is absolutely exquisite, dances on the tongue, almost has a champagne feel to the mouth, a reallly awesome beer, i rarely give out 5's but this beer deserves one for taste."
"D: One of my favourite beers, and close to the top of my list for Belgians. Delicious flavours, a fun beer to drink - go buy this one now."
"Overall: An excellent Belgian ale. If you like Duvel, be sure to give this one a try."
"Only problem is that the yeast is easily disturbed and can become loose in the bottle and doesn't resettle. I've had several bottles from Huyghe that ended up like this in the past, so it's not uncommon with me. Maybe distance/travel is the culprit or poor handling by my source. However, it does not appear to affect the flavour so it is just for appearances sake."
"Fruity start, bitter finish, and silky mouthfeel lend this beer an exceptional drinkability. Almost goes down too easily for its ABV. Makes an excellent evening sipping beer."
"good tasting beer. could do a session with this beer but i would not last long. follows style. would drink again."
"The appearance of this beer is a little deceiving. Looks like a golden ale with lots of foamy head but the aroma is all fruit and sweetness. The 9% alcohol did not overpower the flavor of the beer. Instead it was very drinkable. Good mouthfeel balanced by plenty of fine carbonation."
"Poured this from a faux ceramic bottle into a chalice. Poured beautifully, with golden haze and a thick, sticky head that left lacing everywhere. Smelled delicious, almost like a fruit salad, with notes of white grapes, cherries, pineapple, and much more. Nice complex flavor. Very sweet. Both fruity and wheaty. Medium body. A very warming beer. Delicious, but the alcohol is well-masked."
"Overall, I would love to try this brew again. Thanks to mmtmatrix for this delightful extra."
"Very enjoyable."
"Had it bottled at Moan and Dove. The drink had an orange-gold color with a very heavy head. Its smell was awesome: an aroma of grassy smells made this very unique in my books. The bitter taste of the drink was very strong, making you savor each sip. Tremens was well balanced with its carbonation as well. Overall, this was one of the best for me."
"D - Good beer, but not a session for me. I don't think I care for the sour attribute in beer."
"Pleasant, quite good indeed, not great."
"Review added 11-11-2997, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"Good drinkability for the rather high ABV. Overall it's a fine brew deserving of it's reputation. Always a good choice if you have a Belgian itch to scratch."
"d: Excellent beer on this cold blustery day."
"Delerium Tremens pours a slightly copper bright gold, with a foamy head. The head sticks around and leaves beautiful lacing on my new Allagash glass. The aroma is sweet pilsner malts with fruity esters. There are hints of earthy yeast and herbal hops in the background. The flavor is mostly dry with plenty of esters and lots of chalky, earthy yeast. The malt is secondary, and is much less sweet, but still there. There is a hint of herbal hop flavor and just a bit of bitterness. The beer is almost more sour than bitter. I was happy to see this at a local grocery store."
"This is a nice sipping Ale not overly assertive with any one flavour but it's darn tasty. I'd get this again."
"More of the same on the tongue. Rather dry and crisp. There's pale malt, cloves, spiciness, fruit rind and alcohol. More medicinal character. This is a medium-bodied ale but it packs a punch. And the alcohol sneaks up on you. Quite warming. Perfect for a chilly Autumn night such as this."
"D: This one is by no means a sipper. The alcohol seems almost non-existent. The after taste is pretty dry causing you to want to drink more. Too bad the other qualities don't do the same."
"D- Very drinkable beer. This one is easy to go down. Alcohol is not easy to taste, so it could easily get the best of you if not careful!"
"The 12 oz bottle poured cloudy golden yellow with bits of yeast particules being carried around by the carbonation. Large white billowing head helped fill my duvel tulp The smell of friuty belgian yeast , bublegum and some citrus are great . meduim body easy drinking . Flavors of sweet malts light herbal with more of a citrus after bite than hoppy bitter in the end .Ill say it again ""realy easy to drink"" would not take to much for me to drink another one"
"To be honest, I expected quite a different experience than the one I got. I guess it's because I had always expected something incredibly intense from such a strange bottle/name combination. I really enjoy a good belgian ale, and this definitely fits the bill. I imagine this is what Duvel would want to grow up into some day. I can certainly taste the STRONG."
"D: Pretty good, especially for a beer of this strength."
"Normal bud light/ miller lite color. head vanishes with the quickness. Smell was sweet/rubbing alcohol type smells. Taste was alright. Oily, butttery. More like wine flavors. Mouthfeel was creamy frothy smooth going down. Keeps my mouth wet. drinkability was alright, i liked it but nothing special. I would drink it again maybe."
"M&D - what a quality belgian, lively on the palate, full in character, with well-balanced sweetness and full breadiness with the hoppy supports, a nice brew"
"I was expecting much more from this beer than I found, probably on account of the hype and the packaging. It's just another decent Belgian. Whatever."
"O: I can't get sick of Delirium Tremens -- this is an absolute classic beer."
"Alcohol catches up with you, but still very drinkable otherwise"
"this brew is drinkable, but the high alcohol content will shy some drinkers away. however, the alcohol is very well-masked, and the brew overall is somewhat mild, while remaining very rich in profile and complex in taste. cheers!"
"This beer pours a hazy pale orange color with a lot of visible white floaties. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of cirtus, cloves, and faint touch of anise, and yeast. The taste is like the aroma, but with the addition of a nice earthiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and dry with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I would rather have a La Fin Du Monde or a Duvel."
"What a nice Belgian ale this is. Warm and friendly with a nice personality."
"-Oelergud"
"D:rinkability"
"Not for me."
"Pours a cloudy, golden amber with a huge rocky white head. Tons of lacing left all over the glass, lasting until the finish. Aroma is crisp and light. Full of fruity esters and a nice grassy hop presence. Taste is malty and spicy and full of the typical Belgian flavors: banana, clove, spice, but it isn't too strong and isn't a fully complex as some of the other Belgian strong ales. Definite hop bitterness is noted, and is well balanced by the sweetness of the Belgian flavors. Mouthfeel is great. Crisp, refreshing, and exceptionally smooth, despite the high abv. An excellent beer for drinking any time (just be careful - a magnum bottle is enough to make me very happy for the evening)."
"drinkable, but i was disappointed enough not to order another.."
"Comment: I fist enjoyed this beer at Staminee de Garre. I was a Belgium novice and I was swept away by the mystique of the boast of the best beer in the world. My tastes have matured but Delirium Tremens will always have a special place in my heart."
"Very enjoyable, but by design you couldn't handle too many. A great beer on a great day."
"Drinkability - Unique beer, no doubt, but one that for some reason I only seek out every few months because ""I haven't had a Delerium in while."" Great during colder weather when higher ABV spiced beers are nice... Try ore or three on tap at Delerium Cafe in Brussels - amazing bar and decent flagship beer."
"My first sample from Brouwerij Huyghe and not my last. This beer really didn't impress me at first but as it warmed it became much more complex. And this was after letting it sit for 20 minutes out of the fridge before opening."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, pale golden color with a huge bubbling head and bits of particulate being bounced around by the aggressive carbonation. The smell is very enjoyable and complex. Hints of fruit and Belgian candy sugar mix with an almost weizen-like cloveyness to form quite the smell. The taste is also quite good; a light grape-like fruity maltyness that does a perfect job of covering the alcohol - almost to the point of making the alcohol indiscernible. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a full, creamy carbonation to boot. Given the abv rating along with the smoothness and drinkability of this beer makes this one dangerous brew. Excellent all around and a must try. I've been seeing these pink elephants for a few years now and this was the first one I've managed to get my hands on. Go get your own!"
"Goes down rather nicely, although obviously not a session beer given the high ABV..which BTW you may not even notice."
"This beer actually comes across as pretty thirst quenching, and in my mind is the perfect marriage of sweet and sour. A very nice beer."
"served in a goblet, this was a clear deep straw in color with a nice white head and lacing. the aroma was phenomenal. i was surprised and amazed with the powerful and unique bouqet on this one-bananas, bubblegum, tropical fruit, flowery honey, and peppery spice. this smelled like candy, i think i spent more time inhaling this one than drinking it. this had a nice bit of sweetness to start with a bit of a sour finish, which i'm not a fan of. i just prefer a bitter finish in my beer. this did have some bitterness on the back end but the sourness was a bit more noticeable. medium-bodied and quite drinkable but the abv makes it suffer a bit in this area. a must try beer due to it's uniqueness and complex nose."
"I poured this one and noticed it left a little head as I continued drinking. The color was a weak gold IMO and the smell had a fruity smell to it.The taste was pretty good not too bitter considering the alcohol content, and I would recommend this one to anyone who comes across it"
"Purchased this 12oz bottle from the State Liquor Store. Pours a opaque yellow color similar to a witbier. Light wight head settles very quickly. Smells of fresh fruit, perhaps apples or pears. Tastes faintly sour, maybe like apricots or other dried fruit.i'm also not detecting much hop bitterness, other than what you might expect from a european pale ale. Light and fizzy mouthfeel. Very light and easy to drink, flavor may be a bit different for some tastes, but it's nice. Certainly wouldn't mind trying again."
"750ml bottle enjoyed on my 35th birthday. An excellent way to get the party started. I am amazed that the ABV is 9%. Extremely drinkable and fresh. It poured a golden color and was very effervescent. Crisp apple cider was on the nose and palate. Plenty of sediment that was hopefuley yeast."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, I enjoyed it a lot. Not one of my favorite belgians though"
"Notes: I'm not sure I'll buy again in the future... This seems like it wants to be Duvel, but comes short, especially in the appearance. I enjoyed it, but not enough to choose it over Duvel again."
"D. Highly drinkable although the abv catches up quickly. A great example of a belgian pale ale."
"Overall, It's a great Beer! Very complex, there's a lot going on here."
"The flavor is superb, and that's what counts. Its alcohol is well-hidden--or make that well-incorporated. A quintessential Belgian pale ale, and it goes down wonderfully. A thing of joy and celebration...and delirium tremens, apparently."
"say that this is a good beer with a certain uniqueness of its kind."
"Unfortunately, not 1/2 as good in a bottle as on tap. If you are trying this beer for the first time, please try to find somewhere that serves it as it should be served. Cheers."
"D- This is a drinkable and great brew. I finished mine rather quickly. Great by itself or paired with spicy foods."
"I had this at the Beer Bistro in Toronto on June 21, 2007. The aroma was malty and the beer was a golden colour. The first mouthfeel provided a soapy taste to it. Future tastes provided less soap and a clove/nutmeg taste. Overall I was pleasantly surprised as the higher alcohol content wasn't as evident as I thought it would be."
"Maybe I missed something with this one, as it is rated so highly by other BA's. I poured this into a glass so I could see what I was getting into. It poured beautifully enough and had a good head which seemed to linger, and linger, and linger. The smell was OK but I didn't find it all that pleasing, which should have been a warning sign. I guess the taste really threw me off. I didn't like it at all. Maybe I have a terrible palate, but all I got from it was metal, maybe some slight spiciness, grains and did I mention METAL. This is not one I plan on buying again. Maybe I'm missing the appeal, but the Belgians should stick to Lambics"
"A great tasting brew, one of the best I've had just on flavor alone. A sipping brew, but definitely one I'll enjoy quite a few more times."
"The texture is rather starchy and a bit warm. Overall interesting but not exceptional in my humble opinion."
"D - This is a sipping beer that you'll want to savor to get a feel for the depth of flavor that it offers."
"It has a hazy blonde color with a good amount of carbonation. The head started out as about an inch of white foam. It has strong citrus and yeast nose. The yeast is distinctive and you can taste it as well as smell it. It tastes a bit foamier than it looks with some spices. Maybe nutmeg? This is one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability- I like it but it is a beer that I could only drink once and a while. It is definitely a warmer."
"Drinkability - I've had several Delirium products and this is the first time I've actually sat down and provided a review. Overall this is a good ""sipper"" with a wide-mouth chalice adding to the creation of a nice representation of Belgian Strong Pale Ale. This is a staple of what I keep in stock."
"D- So light, it's highly drinkable. The dry finish makes you want more... and it's dangerously good for 9%."
"D: Drinkability is good, it's a tasty beer. A very nice example of the Belgian strong pale ale style, but not the best out there."
"It pours a nice lighter color, smells of strong alcohol and a trace of fruits, apple or a light grape. Taste, well there sure is some alcohol in there, that is for sure, and a nice end. A beer to take your time with and sip, by the end you might see the elephants dancing!"
"Delerium Tremens is a lovely beer- a great example of the style."
"This is a very nice beer but the price & ABV obviously limits the drinkability. Great to bust out for special occasions."
"One difference of the Delirium I had to Toronto and the one I had at home was the alcohol content. It was 8.7% ABV labled on the bottle in Toronto, but 8.5% ABV labled on the bottle here in SoCal. But anyway, after finishing the whole bottle, things started to feel a little different. They don't call this Delirium Tremens for nothing!"
"It's 4:40 and my 100th review is coming to an end, and so is the subject. This has been a sublime experience. Next stop, Initiate status!"
"D: I would order this, its a nice easy beer that would be a great beer to introduce to your ""Bud Lite"" friend."
"Drinkability: I really wouldn't sit through more than one glass of this again... and would only do that if going through a bottle at a bar with some friends. I think there are much better for the style, but also much worse."
"D: No real drinkability at all, due to the high abv, however, each sip is to be savoured, a belgian classic!."
"Gotta love this bottle, the pink elephants , blue foil, and painted bottle...such a display. Ok, enough of that...onto the beer. Pours a murky straw yellow with a bright fluffy white head with large bubbles. Lacing is sticky-icky-icky...oooweee! Almost paints the glass white. Fruity yeast seems to dominate this smell. Herb and spices seem to tingle the nose as well. Alcohol makes a quick appearance as well. Taste is just what expected from the smell. Fruity, spicey, yeasty, alcohol-y. Honey sneaks up on the tounge as well. Mouthfeel has a hop bite, with a good amount of carbonation. I find the drinkability to be lacking a bit because the alcohol is so present, but the beer overall is a good one."
"Into a chalice, pours a lovely gold, but once again displaying my ineptitude at pouring without getting yeast mixed in there, there is all kinds of stuff floating about. The head is massive, pillowing, a mass of white foam sits atop everything and just chills out. The aroma is a bit disappointing, the spices and citrus were there, just not that appealing for whatever reason. The taste was better, but not the slice of beer nirvana that I remember it as, fruits, citrus and spices in the mix, just a bit off... and this was the beer that got me hooked on Belgians... wtf. Anywho, the mouth is solid, and really it sounds like I'm bashing this boy, but I'm not, its a good one, just not the favorite anymore I suppose."
"T: one of the best tasting belgian strong pale ales ive had. far removed from my birthday dinner where i didnt know more than 3 beer styles, this is a great beer. there is just enough tartness, to cut the sweet fruit flavor. the finish is nice on the mouth. The alcohol is present, but does not detract from the taste. i wanted to lower the drinkablility due to the high alcohol, but this is a beer i keep grabbing the galss for. I know one is enough, meaning i would not sit in session with this beer, but its a great beer to try, and come back to."
"This poured from the faux stone bottle with the pink elephants with a TON of head. It almost looks like detergent on top of the golden ale. The retention was good, very frothy and lacy on the sides of the glass. The smell is fruity, with a zesty lemony tone. Slightly cloudy in appearance, not chill haze because I poured at room temp. The taste is also fruity with a heavy dose of alcohol. It has the slight burn of a wine going down. Very full tasting and heavy mouthfeel. It's a bit misleading, the color leads me to think pilsner and then it wallops with a heavy fullness. I really like this beer but I wouldn't want to drink a few without planning for a place to stay."
"Poured a pale bubbly yellow with a very fine white head. Smelled creamy and almost wine like. tasted sweet almost citrousy, like a mild orange flavor, a touch of sourness. Finished with a bit of licorice taste and a very crisp,clean smooth feel. This was a beer i'd enjoy sipping any day."
"of peculiar rich taste"
"I haven't had this in about 4 years, just another great beer that I had forgotten was this good. If I was going to criticize, I could say that it could have done well with slightly less sweetness, but since it is perfect as is, and the balance hides flavors making a more interesting drink, I won't criticize."
"Served in a Piraat tulip, beer appeared clear gold in color, with a white head that stayed in form for a minute or two, not much lacing. The smell was of typical Belgian yeast. Taste was sweet, some alcohol way in the background, and more of that Belgian yeasty goodness. Carbonation was fairly lively but not too much so. Wasn't too bubbly, had a nice smoothness to it."
"D: The full flavour & alcohol that makes it so great also reduces the drinkability."
"Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but this Belgian ale I really do not enjoy! Too much alcohol flavor (I've had plenty of beers with 9%+ alcohol that have that flavor well-masked), unappetizing appearance, and generally mediocre flavor. I'll pass in the future!"
"D- Enjoyable. For some reason I expected this to be a little different because of the crazy bottle and label. If this wasn't as dry, this might have been a real winner."
"Nothing too exotic here. It seems there are better Strong Belgian Pales out there, but this is pretty prototypical. A fine offering. Worth another round."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy yellowish color, nice carbonation, very nice two finger creamy white head which lasts forever into some nice sticky lacing. The nose is of malts, yeast, slight citrus, spices, and pears. The taste is sweet/tangy, slightly grassy, yeasty, with a nice touch of spices. This brew goes down pretty smoothly, with a slight warming factor. Medium body, a very tasty/complex well rounded brew. Very drinkable, highly recommended. I'm really enjoying this one today."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Complex yet accessible. This is one nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"overall- I hope i got a bad bottle because this carbonation level is just ridiculous. I dont really feel as though i am giving justice to the beer from this review, but until i fork out another $10, this will stand."
"Overall: Very drinkable - would be xcellent for chillin' on the patio this summer' eve. Also, with the exception of the last two drinks, the 8.5 ABV was quite well hidden."
"On tap and Zeno's in State College, PA. Clear, light golden-yellow with a small, white, creamy, slowly diminishing head. The aroma is a very pleasant lightly sweet blend of straw, flowers, citrus, white grape and spice. The taste follows suit, with the fruit and citrus not being to dominant flavor yet being the most noteworthy, and they carry through the finish and win out over the alcohol and a light aftertaste there. Not bad enough to really knock any points off for, but it's there. It has a medium body, almost juicy texture and low carbonation. This was quite the refreshing little treat, and quite the little devil. I had no idea it was 9% until I checked here. I'd definitely get this again."
"Overall, I'll have to try this one again from a different store. I poured it like I was pouring a Duvel, and there were abnormal amounts of residue coming out of the bottle, even 1/3 into my pour chunks were coming out. I realize there is a little sediment sometimes, but I've never seen this much. Down the drain with you."
"This poured a perfect, light-bodied, pale gold. Very active carbonation with slight haziness. Even the most careful of pours yields an absolutely massive head. Very bubbly and soapy with great thickness cover the glass. The smell is at first of lemony cirtus with a strong sense of oily components. By going deeper through this, light floral complexities are noted with a nectar-like smell. The taste repeats these flavorings with a very slight hint of spice and a sour aftertaste. The foamy body creates an incredible mouthfee that goes down very smooth, beginning as frothy and ending as light and watery. Very drinkable, only the sour aftertaste prevent the scoring of a 5 in this category."
"Very pleasant to drink, and a good example of a Belgian Golden Strong Ale."
"The beer was served a very crisp blond with a thin head that was somewhat lasting and left very spotty lacing. The aroma was a good balance of citrus fruits with some pale malt. There was a crisp sweet taste that was somewhat fruity, accompanied by pale malts and yeast. The body was medium on the tongue, almost creamy with a crisp light alcohol bite. The finish was just slightly bitter. This is a very drinkable beer albeit rather pricey. It would be perfect for any special occasion."
"I like this beer and would love to drink a bunch but the cost and availability are an issue."
"Overall: A very good strong golden, a more hoppy interpretation. Although hop levels are generally moderate for this style, this one has a distinct hop presence throughout. The only problem is trying to pick out all the flavors - they tend to meld together so well that there are only a few general descriptors that fit."
"This is an odd one - sweet, phenolic, and esteric (Is that a word? estery?) for the style. I'll have to try this again, maybe this bottle was from a flawed batch."
"Brouwerij Huyghe has a lot of hits and misses in their lineup of beers, but this is definitely one of the hits, maybe the best beer they make."
"This bottle was dated 2006 and poured into a New Belgium glass. It is a golden almost straw colored beer with a thick two finger brilliant white head that hangs around for the long haul. I poured it before I ate and 10 minutes later it was still there. There are visible flecks of yeast floating around the commotion caused by the constant bubbling. The smell mostly belgian funk. There is also a cidery aroma that comes through. If someone didn't know what they were smelling, you might almost be able to convince them it was cider. The taste is much better than the smell. It is a very light and sweet beer with some good yeasty fruity flavors. I would certaintly drink this again, but it won't be a regular for me."
"All in all, a fairly boring strong pale ale. Not bad at all, and well made, but fairly uneventful. Worth the money, but there is better out there."
"For a Belgian I think it's decent, but I can't say it's anything particularly special for what it is. By itself it's pretty darn good. In line with other Belgians, it's decent - had better."
"750ml brown bottle made to look like it's ceramic. Yellow translucent body with bits of yeast floating in it (as I've come to expect from Delirium beers...) and a couple inches of white head. Smells citrusy and yeasty with hints of spice and vanilla. Tastes citrusy, spicey, and yeasty with a hint of vanilla... Alcohol really isn't noticeable. Light to medium bodied. Fairly drinkable for the style and abv. A pretty good Belgian."
"Maybe this is good beer but the cloves are a taste I just freaking hate."
"Took this 25.4 oz bottle out of the fridge, popped the cork (yes, it actually had a cork in it!), and poured it into a clean dry glass. Poured cloudy yellow with a huge white head. The pillowy soft head stuck around for a LONG time with nice lacing on the sides of the glass. First thing I smelled was citrus, more lemon than orange. Tough to smell anything through my stuffy cold though. Malty and citrusy taste with a little bitterness on the finish. A little taste of alcohol on the finish as well. Medium/high carbonation with a little alcohol warmth going down, which doesn't surprise me with the 9% ABV. All in all, this was a good beer and I'm sure 25.4 ounces won't be enough for tonight!"
"Apearance is quite nice with he contrast of the golden cloudiness and the white foamy head. The flavor will vary from batch to batch but generally a hint of candy,spice and fruit. The depth of the beer falls a bit short with an ending that finishes too fast for a sweet Belgium for me. All in all it is still worth trying and comming back to now and again."
"For the abv it drinks allright, I'm sure this better back in Europe. At least it was the time I had it , maybe this bottle is too young?? At $14 a 4-pack here, might be a long before I revisit"
"Despite the high ABV, it's extremely easy to drink and could be made a session beer without problem - although how long you could stand for is another question entirely."
"I hate to admit this one was a drain pour. I'd choose the Nocturnam or Noel over this one for the Delirium beers,"
"Mouthfeel was full. Mouthfilling texture and high carbonation--champange-like. Very nice, better than expected. Despite the name this is not just a novelty beer."
"This beer is one of my favorites it has an excellent body. It is light but has a definate kick to it. Plus, who can deny the little pink elephant. Definatly a better beer on tap then out of the bottle, but either way you drink it, Tremens is still delicious"
"Overall this was a good beer and would definatly consume another or two..."
"The delirium is the belgian wolf in sheeps clothing. Pours light and airy with a thick head- tropical phenols and a slight rounded hop profile. Yeasty and clean at the same time which hides the high ABV. Fruity carb sizzle on the tongue, a slight burn on the throat and a dry finish. Nice ale malts are not too sticky and play well with the other flavors. Very easy going down, watch out or it will kick your ass."
"This beer I had been wating to try for a while and I actually just bought the Noel but haven't had it yet. This was a good overall beer but not one of my favorites."
"pours a cloudy straw yellow. the smell of cloves is billowing from the light head. limited in the way of bubles, but definitly nice and cloudy so who knows. tastes awesome. clove and bannana flavors upfront. finishes slightly sweet. not a bad brew. i think i prefer a unibroue, with their distinctive yeast taste. but maybe i'd order another of these. definitly not close to the worst beer i've tried. another great beer at the sunset grill."
"I have been putting this off partly because of the $7.69 price tag, and the feeling this brew was just too trendy to be real. Bottle is indeed quite unique with its yellow opaque color and pink elephants on the label. Poured from the 750 ml corked and caged bottle it was a beautiful gold bronze color. Slightly cloudy it produced a big soap suds looking head that left a clean set of lacing rings as it settled. Really powerful nose of yeasts and malts, with lots of spices with coriander most prominent, with citrus, fruit, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is crisp, and feels good going down with a slight creamyness. Finish slightly bitter. But overall while this is good, there are Belgium Strong Ales domestic versions right here in my own back yard such as North Coast PranQster Belgian that tasted just as good, and costs a fraction of what I paid for this one."
"A nice beer. Carbonation cuts into the drinkability for me, but very controlled properties for a big beer. sufficiently dry and smooth that could drink a few of these, but that 8.5% ABV would get me eventually!"
"D - It is easy drinking, and very enjoyable. For the style though, its a little sharp."
"Pours a hazy yellow with incredible carbonation rising from the bottom of my chalice to join the large and bright white head that lasts very well and leaves lots of lacing. Smell is very fruity, citrus and peaches, very sweet in an entirely natural way. Honey makes a welcome appearance. Strawberry and melon as well, along with spicy cloves and pepper. Wonderful. Taste isn't quite as complex, but banana and light yeastiness come to the fore with spices in the mix and slightly noticeable alcohol. Mouthfeel is warming, but crisp. Plenty of body. Drinkability is quite good. A remarkable BSPA, extremely unique and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability  Out of the bottle into an oversized wine glass very refreshing great eye appeal. As it warmed a little the aroma intensified and the melding of flavors increased."
"On tap served in a DT snifter. Presents a slightly hazy, golden-orange hue beneath a paper thin bone-white head. Pleasant, but reserved aromas are noted of ripe apricots, apples, bananas, clover honey and fresh cut lemon. A pleasing tongue-tickling spritz is noted on the palate, but finishes slightly thin and watery. Clean, crisp, balanced flavors of citrus hard candies (orange, lemon and pineapple), bananas, yeast, spices, fresh-baked bread and caramel malts are enjoyed. Alcohol is deceivingly warming; hard to detect. Overall nothing to do back-flips over, but a solid, classy Belgian for sure."
"D- It is alright. Some of the flavors seemed kind of out of place but other than that it is a decent beer but no way worth the money."
"One of my first Belgian beers, and it has been a long time to get back around to reviewing it. Almost champagne like in character. Sweeter/less hoppy than I recall, or, more likely, my taste has moved on a bit. Still damn tasty and I bet it would go well with sushi."
"As is evident from the graphic, this beer starts with a really nice presentation. Uncapping it, even to a nose as dead as mine, Belgian fruitiness is in the air. It pours a wheaty, champagne tint, with a healthy, frothy, and dimpled head, which just keeps coming. The lacing pulls down like a Rorschach test, like those clouds that kick imagination into gear. The mouth feel is yeasty and carbonated, but not too much of either. A reminder of its goodness hangs about on the back of the tongue. It's 8.5 ABV is not apparent, absorbed by its blend. This is a good brew! Somewhere, God said, ""Let there be Belgians, and let them make good beer..."""
"had."
"Poured a straw color with a large white head, left very little lacing, some fine yeast particles floating about. The smell is of lemons, spice, touch of bananas. The taste is sweet, a bit sugary, lemony, however not blown away with flavor. The mouthfeel is creamy, fizzy. A very good BSPA, very drinkable. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try a Belgian ale."
"Drinkability: Always a big fan of Belgians, and this one is no exception."
"High carbonation. Nice bite. Goes down easy."
"Ah, DT my friend. This Belgian pours a nice slightly pale gold with nice white head that thins to fair lacing. A bit milky too. The smell is very fruity with a notice of the alcohol content. The flavor is excellent, sweet, fruity and potent. It's very smooth and tingly and drinks surprising well considering it's 9% ABV wallop!"
"Beer was straw-colored, almost golden in appearance. The smell was very fruity, with just an underlying hint of yeastyness. The taste was amazing, I didn't notice the alchohol at all. Flavor was smooth, slightly fruity, with a hint of something like banana or apple. Mouthfeel was extremely light, almost reminiscent of a 7up or other clear soda. Drinkability was amazing. Had I not been warned of the high alchohol content, I probably would have finished it in a matter of minutes. Luckily, taking my time helped me to fully appreciate the experience. Can't wait to have this beer again."
"Although listed here as 9 percent alcohol my bottle says 8.2%. Appearance is nice, hazy with some little floaters. Very good head that lasts throughout. Smells very strongly of fruit, maybe lemon, and alcohol. Taste is good. I don't like this BSPA as much as La Fin du Monde or Duvel, but still a good choice."
"The flavor isn't bad, but I would have to say that it has its weakpoints. It seemed a little too grainy for me, which may appeal to some people. Still, I would recommend someone to at least try it once."
"Pours a light golden straw color with fluffy & chunky head that takes a while to fade and laces the glass all the way down to the bottom. Smells very flowery and yeasty with a hint of citrus. Taste is very sweet and estery with a hint of banana. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is heavy, with carbonation building up on the back of the tongue as you swallow, something I've only really felt with belgian ales. All in all, it's a very drinkable beer, I will definitely be buying this again."
"It is a lovely pale golden color with a nice white head. You don't notice the alcohol untill about 3/4 of the way through the bottle. Very deceptive."
"Pours a hazy gold with a sizeable head that lingers well. Aroma is sweet with yeasty notes. Pleasant hoppy taste, well balanced with some wine characteristics. Nicely carbonated feels so comforting to the palate. Alcohol is well concealed, making it quite drinkable should you choose to dangerously."
"Overall, this is a very wine-like brew. Champagne-like carbonation level, and loads of grapey flavor with a high ABV. When I get married...I'll toast with this instead of the usual bubbly stuff."
"Poured a wonderful white lacy head while chunks of sediment fizzed a trail through a backdrop of a gold orange hue. A lively aroma with phenolic qualities mixed with a light corrander scent. The mouth is silk with a perfect balance of malt and hoppiness. Not overly bitter because of the extra barley, but has an alcoholic warmth at the finish."
"Poured the 11.2 fl. oz bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a light golden yellow color with a lot of small bubbles rising to the top to produce a large frothy head. Aroma is sweet and fruity with a touch of yeast and also some alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is crisp and sweet with an array of fruits that quickly make for the alcohol to come and warm things up with quite a bite. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, this is a solid brew but is lacking in the drinkability category."
"Light bodied and well carbonated, this is a highly drinkable ale."
"Delirium has long been a big favorite of mine, but it only just arrived here in N.C. I poured an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass after letting it sit a little while out of the 'fridge. Not a lot of head, very fine white foam. Beautiful deep golden color, with a great aroma of banana and possibly some apple in there. First hit on the tongue wakes up the taste buds in a big way. I always thought Tremens was a Tripel, but that big initial blast of hop proves it is really the Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It isn't overwhelming, but surprising at the very least. After your buds get over the initial blast, you begin to taste the incredible floral boquet. There's a little coriander, maybe a little citrus. It definitely stays there for quite a while, too. Great lingering aftertaste. Overall, this is just one of my top beer favorites worldwide. Can't beat the bottle and packaging, either. Pink elephants? Have a couple of these, and you'll definitely see a couple of them."
"Great drinkability, major cool label appeal. I actually drink this one from the bottle sometimes, it is a different experience. The brew froths up so much in your mouth you experience different qualities in the taste if not only the texture."
"Glad I found this as a single at a local BP of all places. Only $3 or so for the 12 ounce vs. God knows what somewhere else. It's a good Belgian Strong Pale Ale but this style is something I am not seeking out as much. Absolutely gorgeous head, color and lacing. Lots of fruity esters. A bit acidic tasting with notes of citrus. Like it but do not love it."
"D: A very drinkable Belgian. It's up there with Duvel, although not as refined or complex. This one's got rougher edges, but it's still pretty damn good. Sweet and light without any real hop character and a well rounded citrus malt. Goes down real easy. As far as Delirium is concerned, I actually prefer Nocturnum. I wouldn't turn this one down if offered, though. Too bad it's kind of pricey. I'de be willing to drink it from a normal bottle to get a better price."
"The flavour started spicy and the tart apple and pear tastes came next. It finished with a malty smoothness and a gentle alcholic warming. It was medium-bodied and nicely effervescent without being abrasive. An easy-drinker despite the high ABV."
"Light gold in colour with some haze and yeast chunks. Strong carbonation. Clear banana aroma, along with some fine cardamom pods and black pepper notes and apple skins. Flavor wise, the light malts give way to a fairly strong metallic note before the typical Belgian spicy yeasty thing kicks in. Theres a bit of a sour twang on the back end. Finishes very dry and light. Aside from the metallic note, this seems to be a fairly good beer. It seems very much like a tripel."
"Drinkability: Good."
"Served in a tulip glass, this was a clear yellow, medium head, some lacing. Aroma was all light, sweet fruit. A nice fruit taste, balanced by the hops. It, however, had more substance to it than I thought, and it tasted better as it warmed. Very nice beer, one I would drink again, but on this night there were others waiting."
"Picked this up at Dawg's Bottle Shop in Greensburg. Poured an 11.2oz bottle into a goblet to try for the first time. Love belgians and making my way through all the big names. Poured a nice golden color with bright white rocky and uneven head. First smell brought lighter, sweet smelling fruits(bananas and pears). First taste bitter and then sweet came in to balance things out. Alcohol taste hidden well until it warms up. Only a slight drying and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very carbonated but on lighter side, not quite as bubbly as a Duvel. Will definitely try this one again."
"Taste is very chewy, tons of malt, all the usual suspects are here. Orange, banana, coriander, an apple juice like mild sourness and lots of yeast. Though malty I find this to be not nearly as sweet as many of the beers I've had in this style. Very mild alcohol in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a slight bite on the tongue. This beer really slides down easily, and although I intended on just sipping it as I do most Belgians, it's so extremely drinkable I find I'm trying not to down it in bigger gulps. A very summery Belgian that I'll come back to again."
"Drinkability- Boobalishously quaffable. However, La Fin Du Mond tastes better and is alot cheaper. Still, if a hobo gave me the chance, Id thumbs up that son gun with two hands."
"I have heard so much talk about this beer but it made me a bit disappointed; its just another strong Belgian ale"
"Overall, not the most complex belgian strong pale/tripel i've had, but just damned tasty."
"I had high expectations for this beer, having heard good things about it. I was underimpressed. I gave it high marks for clarity. Too much head. No matter how I poured it (at 40 degrees into a room temp glass) I ended up with 80% foam. The head was beautiful though, white and lacey. I detected zero hop aroma and very very little hop bitterness. No alcohol flavor either. The sweet, slightly burnt malt and sugar profile came through strongly. Lots of candi sugar I guess."
"I can think of few brews as delicious on a summer day."
"Mouth feels some tartness, rich malty feel, with a light bitterness at the back."
"D - A fifth of this is a bit much, but it is Friday night. So whatever. It is pretty good. Nothing I would go looking for, but I wouldn't pass it up if it was offered. Reminds me a lot of Unibroue's Don de Dieu, but with less flavor and less cloyiness. Yeah, I know that isn't a word."
"And a nice and original bottle and label."
"D- a great beer, tastes great, goes down nice and clean, would buy/drink/recommend anytime"
"Highly recommended"
"Drinkability: dry and refreshing, I will certainly drink more but rather than cracking another, I'd more likely savor the first and try to figure out its different subtleties better."
"Drinkability: Although it has an 8.5% ABV, I feel as if I could drink this beer all night. That may be a very dangerous thing."
"Mouth feel is medium in body with high levels of carbonation."
"Remember to be careful when opening this thing. The cork in mine literally shot out of the bottle with great force. If it was to hit me in the face or something who knows what it could have done. Just a warning. :> )"
"D- I could drink it all night. The flavor is great and it doesn't get old on your tongue. Surprisingly refreshing, because it's quite strong."
"We're hooked on the Delirium that we've had, rating high on our cellar scale. This offering should be kept for special occasions, hiding it from your free-loading, beer beggar friends."
"New find from the Belfast Co-op. Pours bright yellow with a long lasting head. Smells a bit yeasty and bread like. Taste is really nice yeasty flavor, some fruitiness and alcohol show up in the background. Overall a really nice golden ale. Reminds me a bit like Duvel, actually almost quite like Duvel, just slightly different. Warning: Careful with that cork as mine flew off after barely touching the cork."
"Overall, a decent beer within its style, and a good beer all around. I think that it could have been much better if the hop, spice, and fruity notes could have played a larger part. Definitely worth a try, regardless."
"DT is extremely drinkable.. It's a strong pale ale that isn' t that strong, but highly enjoyable. I could drink Delirum Tremens until I started seeing pink elephants in places other that the label or glass (Disclaimer: BA does not endorse drinking until intoxicated)."
"Very nice, pleasant Belgian ale. Refreshing and obviously dangerous. Probably the best beer ever named after a symptom of alcohol withdrawl."
"A delightful beer which I can't stop sniffing or drinking."
"D: recommend to everyone who loves a great strong pale ale"
"Overall: The first time I reviewed this beer my palate wasn't quite up to par. More than a year later I went back to this brew and glad I did. A near classic!"
"Overall, quite a tasty beverage. Hard to detect the 9%ABV. Lots of carbonation, though, like a champagne. The only bad part of my experience with this beer was that my girlfriend traded me her Blue Moon for the last half of my DT (what can I say, I'm a nice guy!) - but I definately got screwed in that deal! Goes to show, nice guys finish last..."
"This beer poured a golden cloudy color with a nice thick persistent head. The smell is a bit fruity and maybe a little sour. The taste is fruity, sweet and a bit alcoholic. The mouthfeel isnt thick but is slightly chewy. It is highly carbonated, but smooth in the aftertaste. Id consider this a very delightful and drinkable beer."
"This beer poured a nice golden color, a bit cloudy and smells of fruit or slightly soured fruit. The head was nice and lasted for a few minutes. Mouthfeel is chewey, but smooth. Taste is fruity, with a slight bitter taste, but still very drinkable in my opinion."
"D- This beer has a fairly good balance of sugary sweet malt and green hop flavor in the finish. It has a very smooth alcohol heat that makes it go down very fast. It would be nice if it had a bit more complexity in the malt or hops to give it some depth."
"It may have been a skunky bottle? Not stored correctly? Maybe I poured it wrong? Not sure, but it reminded me of the Miller Lite they sell at ball games in a way (except a premium version maybe)."
" This is very easy to drink despite the higher ABV. I will drink this again."
"Drinkability is extremely high from start to finish. Excellent beer, fine taste, wonderful example of a strong pale. Alternative to Duvel and nearly as tasty."
"D- 8.5% ABV? It's hard to tell really.. it's a great tasting beer and I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Overall: While this beer is not rated as high as La Fin Du Monde, I think its damn close. An outstanding Belgian strong pale. Highly recommended. Plus, the wife likes it."
"For a 9% ABV, this one goes down way too easy!!! Alcohol is expertly masked by an upfront malt sweetness with flavors of fresh tropical fruit and loads of honey. Alcohol catches up to you by the end of the glass, so watch out!"
"Slowly becoming one of my favorite Belgiums, this was delicious."
"This would be a nice entry into the world of Belgians. It does not overwhelm. The flavor is excellent and something of a cross with less hearty offerings. Very drinkable, almost deceptively so."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a lively head. Smells great with a spicy, yeasty smell coupled with some great malt. Tastes great, a very malty spicy with a hint of yeast. Mouthfeel is great coating the tongue with flavor and carbination. Very drinkable."
"Hey, thanks to Solomon420 for this treat!"
"Translucent honey color with little suspended particles throughout. I expected lots of head from this beer, but somehow got more than that. The foamy, yeasty, paper-white head rose out of the glass like a souffle. It's quite a beauty to behold in a nice tulip glass. The first thing to hit my nose was strong flowery esters, namely sweet rose and tulip. There are also lots of apples and pears, giving an overall sweet nose. The taste, again, was huge on flower petals and pears, though not overwhelmingly sweet. There was a sour bitterness which was a bit pithy or zesty maybe. On the back of the palate, the alcohol really comes through (especially in vapors), and released a bouquet of sweet and savory spices. The mouthfeel was too watery for my taste, though it did thicken up on the backside. Not the most drinkable beer, due to alcohol and overwhelming flavors and aromas, but it certainly is an adventure."
"sweetness with a funky middle and a spicy bitter tail--all well-balanced. watch out for the abv!"
"D: I would definately get this again but I would have to be in the mood for something quiet sweet. Which this mood doesn't come to me often but when it does I know what I'm going for."
"Medium-bodied and it goes down smooth enough, and though this wasn't exactly a bad beer, at $9 a 750 ml bottle and with the high alcohol content and taste, this is just not going to be something I will buy again anytime soon."
"Poured a semi-clear, soft golden color with a soapy white head and heavy with carbonation. Some lacing was left behind in my glass. Aromas of dried fruit, hard candy, grass, and alcohol seemed to dominate. The taste was fruity and mildly refreshing with a blast of bitterness making a sudden entrace at the tail end of each sip. Being a crisp, dry, and sweet beer, this is easy to sip. I did not like the slightly chalky, earthy texture it had, especially in the finish. A bottle of this was all I really wanted. A good beer filled with flavor and interesting aromas, but not quite up to the level of greats in this style like Unibroue."
"This is an interesting beer. Very strong fruity aroma...possibly bananas, from the onset throughout the entire bottle. Pours into the tulip glass with a yellow-golden color, with thick white head and excellent lacing. Overall, this was a much fruitier beer than I care for, so I rated the flavor at only a 6. However, I can see how women or fans of lambics and similar beers would really enjoy this."
"Served from what is probably my favorite bottle design out there in a Duvel tulip. Golden amber, with a big foaming head. Great fruity aroma. The taste is incredible; crisp, a little bitter and yet incredibly sweet. Nicely carbonated; it definitely warrants the champagne comparisons some other BA's have made. The 9.0% is nicely masked; this is a very easy 750 to polish off before you even realize it is done!"
"Nice mouthfeel, slight creaminess. Medium body. Highly drinkable, refreshing, easy session beer. It seems like the draft is a bit more tasteful and complex than the bottles I've had in the past."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking and delicious. I could drink my weight with beer, of course that is if i didnt pass out after my first 10."
"The bottle version makes it heavier and sweeter than your ordinary Belgian Pale Ale, It's a great beer for conversing with fellow BA'ers. Aromas are solidly sweet of malts and sugars form other sources, spices, Belgian yeast, fruity, and alcohol. Colors are strong yellow-straw and vigorously carbonated and retained its head well. Tastes sweet with malt and honey (maybe some wheat thrown in). Spicy and hot from fermentation and spice addition makes the beer peppery and prickly to the mouth. Fruitiness reminds me of lemonheads candy with tartness of grapefruit, pears, and under-ripe cherries. The body is medium-full (would be full, but thinned by the alcohol). The carbonation numbs the mouth, except for the fusal alcohol flavors (which are a bit much.) Finishes with a cotton candy sweetness and alcoholic warmth. The beer makes a serious punch is drank in the summertime, but warms nicely in the winter."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, high abv limits it to one per session."
"Semi-clear gold in the glass, with a fluffy, big-bubbled head that fades to a thin film over the beer. Balanced, comforting aroma, with apples, grasses, and pepper. Starts sweet, then gives way to faintly sour fruits on the mid-palate, and honey at the end. Finish is dry and warm with alcohol. Mouthfilling carbonation provides the illusion that this is a heavy bodied beer. These flavors are well integrated throughout -- this is a smooth, deceptively strong beer that deserves the fame it has... although not just based on its name and image."
"the spice character and hop flavor are nicegood example of the style"
"A very fruity smell with a very low hop presence. Somewhat of a light yellow in appearance. Off white head with laceing down the sides of the glass. A fruity type of taste, somewhat of a semi-sweet taste. Medium in bitterness, no harsh aftertaste. Goes down smoothly, leaving a very light dryness in your mouth. High carbonation, very bubbly. This is my first strong belgian ale. Will drink this again, but will look into other similiar styles."
"Excellent beer here...would pair nicely with a turkey on the grill"
"Smooth fluffy mouthfeel that finishes dry and warming."
"Drank this beer on the terrace overlooking a canal in Vlaardingen Holland on a recent business trip. Hmm, I have to say for a Tripel style beer, especially one of this reputation, I was let me down. Perhaps it was due to my own expectations. The colour was nice and presentable, not too rich in the orange hues like other tripels, nor was it hazy like I had expected. I dont know if it was due to the temperature I drank it at, as it was slighlty chilled, but the carbonation seemed to dominate the taste, almost like carbonated water. I dont know, perhaps a bad bottle? Although I did end up buying a nice box set with 4 of these bottles and 2 nice serving glasses, so I am willing to give it a second chance...purely because I have heard/read a great deal of good things about it. Although my first impression yielded me giving this beer an almost average score."
"A standard for the style. Pink elephants go!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet glass for this particular beer. Hasy straw yellow in appearance, with about 1/2"" white head that dissipates slowly over 3-4mins. Noted earthy tones noted with hints of cloves. This carries over to taste wiht earthy flavors noted, along with estery flavors that dominate, no real hop flavor noted. this beer provides a nice feel in the mouth with a noticable level of carbonation. this is a rather smooth tasting belgian pale ale, with a high level of carbonation that increases the enjoyablity. A highly recommends belgian."
"Overall: Kind of a shame that the taste is so bold it bullies the nose a bit after the first sip. Seems like the aroma doesn't have much of a chance. The more carbonation I work out of it the more that element appeals to me. Really don't notice the level of alcohol at all even though I suspect its involvement in some of the spicy finish."
"Appearance was a golden/straw color with yeast floating around. Big, fluffy, off-white head - surprised by the amount of head given the high alcohol content. Smell was clove-like, with hints of bananas, and some mild citrus. Also detected some sourness/sweat-like funk to it in the background, kind of like what you would expect with Brettanomyces, but not as upfront. Nice spicy taste with banana flavors - a very German wheat beer-like profile to it but with some other flavors going on. Frothy on the mouth with moderate body. Given the high ABV, this is a very drinkable beer - you do not notice the alcohol at all. Kudos on the bottle design!"
"Very drinkable to the point of making this one a dangerous brew as the high A.B.V. and the pleasent flavor keep one wanting more."
"Pours a cloudy, weizen-y golden yellow with a short skim of foam. Nose is bright and fruity, with notes of belgian yeast, banana, and clove. Taste starts off with a light hop bitteness followed by sweet tropical fruit, banana, clove, musty yeast and spice. Mouthfeel is light and smooth, carbonation low. Overall an easy-drinking 9%-er here, light and fruity, quite refreshing. Another delicious Delirium."
"Yum, please run this past me again"
"in my notes i gave this beer a overall or 5, i really like this beer is very good, can not go wrong."
"on a final note, the dregs of this beer, though unlike most i've seen, do contain quite a bit of yeasty goodness. probably better off swirling this sucker and enjoying them throughout the beer rather than leaving them for the finish. eh, live and learn. must be the lesson of the pink elephant..."
"Had this beer on draft at a local restaurant. It was served in stemmed Trappist glass. Flavor (which is the undeniable highlight of this beer) was fruity, spicy and distinctive. Aroma was good, appearance adequate (yet undistictive), and palate feel was velvety and smooth. Would have again on draft...not sure about in bottle after reading some of the other reviews here."
"Drinkability suffers due to the strong yeast and alcohol flavors, as well as the high price. This is the second time I have had this beer and the first time was so much better. Less yeast and alcohol, and more fruit with a delicious malty backbone. I don't think I got a bad bottle, but I do think there are some inconsistencies between batches."
"The taste has a light malt sweetness to it that is mostly drowned out by all of the other flavors found in this beer, which is a long way of saying that this beer tastes fairly dry. There is a nice level of yeast/ fermentation derived spiciness here as well; I get light notes of clove, a certain ginger note, and a pepper-like note that combines with the carbonation. Layers of fruit character are also found here with apple and pear being prominent along with a sort of fruit-reminiscent tartness that is also found in these fruits. As the beer warms up a tad, I begin to get some notes of hot alcohol in the finish. It almost adds to the perceived spiciness of this beer, and actually is not all that detracting. This is definitely enjoyable, but something seems a bit out of whack, which keeps this beer from being stellar."
"Very tasty."
"A bit more yeasty and watery than most of my favorite Begians, but I'm not sure that's the point of this one. It's exceedingly drinkable, and it's 9% ABV. Hence the name, right? Drink up, start trembling."
"definitely worth revisiting in the future."
"Drinkability: Oh, definitely. This is not at all what I expected. I thought I'd be looking at another ho-hum syrupy, sugary BSPA; what I got was a unique and thoroughly refreshing, crisp, tart saison wannabe. I'd never been too intrigued by this one, but very much enjoyed it. I'll be back."
"Light pale amber color poured with a generous fluffy head. Lots of yeasties floating around producing a rather opaque shade. Aromas are intensely fruity with lots of sweet oranges, esters, and some dried figs in the background. Bubbling in my mouth is a nice light body of a brew. Flavors of bready malt, a little of the fruits, yeast and a nice alcohol twang at end. Finishes rather dry. This is quite enjoyable truer to style I imagine than the other Americanized Belgian style beers. I want a bit more complexity to this beer, perhaps some more sweetness, body, something, but I can't quite describe it. Would make a perfect ending to any meal."
"The flavor delivers the same complexity to the point of masking detection of some of the components. Spiced apples and citrus fruits stand out at times, as does the slight hop profile. It holds a slightly Earthy tone. Very good flavor."
"Highly recommended."
"Notes: An extremely interesting beer. It was hard for me to pin down the experience and put it into words, but it was a good one. A must try if you ask me."
"D: Definetly an interesting Belgian that I would put on par with the only other BSPA I've had, La Fin du Monde. Something that I would buy again. I would like to try some of this companies seasonals."
"It's beautiful, it really is. It looks just like dark champagne in my glass (the color of a big, aged chardonnay)--a champagne that retains a big, white head that could be egg whites whipped to a froth. Lots of excited bubbles in this one, and the beautiful, light color of the nectar I'm beholding showcases them perfectly. Even as I was pouring I unintentially caught the aroma of this baby--I smelled that familiar, sweet, belgian smell. Has that citrusy, fresh smell that screams, ""stop smelling me and get me on your tongue!"" I obeyed. I'm not the biggest fan in the world of the wheaty taste of wits and belgian strongs, but I'm loving this and know something good when I meet it, and this is good. The head is receding now I'm about halfway through the glass, but has maintained a good, solid sheet of foamy love about 2 mm thick across the surface and a few thin tendrils lacing the glass on the side I've been drinking from. Still lots of bubbles. Still delicious. It's not as sweet as some belgians and seems to have found a great balance. The just-enough hops backs it up and the alcohol hardly seems present. It's very light yet coats my whole mouth like a most comfortable favorite blanket and surprisingly, it's not over-carbonated at all, in-spite of the frizzante thing it has going on in my glass. I can't believe how easy it's going down. This could be dangerous; it'd be easy to forget they hid 8.5% in there somewhere..."
"I recommend trying the Delirium beers, not only because they taste great, but because they're clever too. The label clearly states that it's been brewed since the 1600's, but if they had those cool painted bottles back then, I would have been one happy serf."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"On tap ... in a Delirium ""pink elephant"" goblet. Slightly opaque tangerine orange color with a thick, white head that has staying power. Nose is fruity and yeasty, with plenty of spices. Palate is on the sweeter side; fruity and lots of cloves, citrus, and peppery flavors. Slight bitterness that is pleasant. Very highly carbonated and almost ""fizzy."" I prefer the Nocturnum, for sure, but this is a very good Belgian golden. I'd definitely recommend you give it a swirl and a whirl."
"Pours a medium golden color with a thick white cap. This cap was gone quickly and left almost no lacings. Smell was great filled with bananas, cloves, and diacetyl. A little grainy. The flavor was cloves, banana, and peppery with pungeant hops. Crisp carbonation right off with a medium-light body. Nice dry finish. Good beer that I will have again."
"I've never been that big a belgian drinker, but I'm going to have to revisit this one in the future. You should too."
"A wonderfully sweet taste. Hints of fruit and bubble gum color this beer strongly. It has a medium body and is very smooth."
"Clean, tingly, with enough carbonation to give it body and keep far away from the cloyingly sugary tag that could happen. Very drinkable, just not when paying bar prices. Why don't I drink this more often?"
"Had this one at a European beer bar in downtown Melbourne. Bottle had four cool looking elephants dancing around the label. Anyway the beer poured a very enticing cool golden color with a nice thick head into a sniffer. Smell was wonderful...there were many different fruit aromas going on, each one not overpowering but just right. If you can imagine fruit salad in a beer then you get the idea. There was also a slight spicyness that strangely enough complimented the fruit smells very well. Taste was also very good...pretty big hop presence with fruit flavors going wild. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled with was the carbonation, which was a bit too much for my liking. Drinkability was pretty damn good, but I think the alcohol could be a factor considering that after one I felt a bit buzzed. Final Verdict: A very nice beer, definetly worth a try. Apparently the title means the shakes you get after a long night of drinking. Veddy Veddy clever. Cheers"
"D - Very drinkable, alcohol is pleasantly disguised."
"If I'm having a Belgian beer, Delirium Tremens is pretty much the one for me. I prefer it to all the other big name Belgians and the American made Belgians as well."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... recommended..."
"Too sweet for a session beer however well balanced and a good example of a belgian beer."
"So, gotta be constructive, now... I'll surely drink another. And if I get lucky and it's not overly carbonated it might just be a great beer."
"750ml bottle: This one pours with a decent white head on it. The color is a fairly clear, darker golden color. The nose is a bit spicy, with notes of breadiness and bananas. The taste is a bit tarter than I expected. A bit of spice to it, with a touch of a dry aftertaste. A hint of clove and a touch of sweetness also. A decent brew. Not quite up to Duvel."
"Drinkability- Top 5 Belgian Pale IMO. Doesn't hit you in the face like some do, which is not bad or good. Although, this has been aged a good year plus, so who knows how it tastes fresh. Will have to find out sometime in the future. Very recommended!"
"I got this beer purely because of the name. I'm drinking it in celebration of begining my second attempt at a decent home brew. This stuff poors a pale straw yellow and sports a energetic but shortlived head. Smells of spice and yeast, which is a winning combinitation in this case. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp and refreshing. Taste is sweeter than average with flavors of apple and spice. Nice balanced hop profile that really compliments the sweetness. I'm glad to see that the elaborate bottle is not all there is to it. Definitely worth the $8. Note: On the back of the bottle the ABV is stated as ""8,5% VOL."" Not the 9%ABV cited at the top of the page. This is a fine beer. Fine like wine. Though compared to beer, wine is not fine, but you get the point."
"Goes down really easy so drinkability is high. Sweet stuff."
"Beautiful hazy gold in color-a huge head on top that just begs to be compared to whipped cream. Really a pretty glass of beer. Good aroma-yeasty and sulfur like. Slight peppery spice bite to it. Spicey flavor-complex malt and spice mix. Somewhat sweet in spots but nice drying finish. Metallic at times. great body-very bright and lively on the palate. Really a great beer. I first had this in 1995 or so as I remember and was so blown away then. Still a classic in my book."
"This ominous beer was a pale golden colour. Quite fizzy and with a decent head. The nose had some interesting characters such as bubble gum and light banana and pepper scents. Certainly yeast influenced and interesting. The taste was pleasantly sweet with a candi sugar base. The other flavours were much the same as the nose with the aforementioned bubble gum and banana impressions. Some pepper and clove hints. Fairly complex. This beer was wet and round without much bitterness. Mouthfeel medium. Somewhat fluffed by fiz and malt variety. It approached creaminess at times. Drinkability was good. Characteristic Belgian traits made this quite interesting and a pleasure to drink."
"I am unsure how good of a session beer this would make. The flavor is wonderful, but the ABV is a little high. Too amny of there, and you might down for the count. This beer is great. Thanks Tommy for hooking me up with it."
"This beer is not worth the money in my opinion. I paid $4 for an 11.2oz bottle. It is good, just not great. The fruitiness is great and it almost tastes like champagne, but that just doesnt do it for me. Good, but not great."
"750 ml bottle, corked, caged, and wrapped in foil. Delirium Tremens has a clear, bright orange color with a big head. Lots of carbonation. Just a bit of floaties. Sweet aroma of juicy fruits with orange peels and spices. Fruity and spicy flavor. Orange, coriander, and pepper. Not as malty as I expected. The spices are a bit much, and there is some medicinal flavor. ABV is noticably high, but it hides behind a strong, spritzy carbonation. A tasty, but flawed beer."
"I don't feel compelled to have another...maybe I let it sit to long...sigh. Next up: La Fin Du Monde"
"Served from a 750ml bottle with champagne cork. Pours a beautiful hazy golden color topped by a huge, thick, creamy white head. Ample carbonation just keeps on coming. Aroma primarily of Belgian ale yeast, with notes of clove, banana, and confectioner's sugar. Palate is a tad delicate - tasty, yes, but individual flavors are difficult to discern. Light sweet malt melds with the assertive yeast, yielding sweet, bready notes with light spice. Clove, banana, a touch of pepper. Body is nice, creamy, and a touch buttery. The substantial alcohol is hidden well in the palate, but gradually builds on the finish. This is one of my favorite special occasion beers, and since I'm celebrating the completion of paperwork for my new job tonight, I thought I'd break it out. A real treat indeed."
"I also drank a 750mL of this on New Year's Eve -- a friend of mine who does not drink alcohol at all drank and enjoyed a glass of this while I finished off the bottle. A nice celebration beer, for me."
"The carbonation that I really like in this kind of ale brings this one down a bit, and as it warms there's an unpleasant estery alcohol bite. What I want to say but should restrain myself from saying is that this reminds me of Duvel but is a little less refined in appearance, flavor, and presentation. Worth trying, if just for the fact that you can joke about the name and bottle with friends."
"Dark gold color with an enormous head of oily foam. Abundant spices both in the aroma & taste..cloves and coriander have their way with it. The Belgian yeast runs rampant in this puppy as well. Somehow the wide array of yeasts, spices, and thick malts come together to make a pretty damn good strong Belgian ale. Fresh on-tap, this is a very solid Belgian... though, I must say, I didn't see any pink elephants.."
"¡Salud!"
"This one had a nice, large head of foam. A partially cloudy yellow with an orange tinge, it looked like the rhine of of a grapefruit in color. The smell is fruity, with some citrus flavors, and maybe banana too. The taste is more of the same, fruity and tarty, not very bitter at the finish. It has a light to medium mouthfeel with loads of bubbly carbonation. The 9% alcohol is well concealed. Not the best of its class, but it is nonetheless a great Belgian Ale that I enjoyed very much..."
"The mouthfeel here is great. I really do like it. It compliments the sparkling grape juice flavor. It feels just like sparkling grape juice in the mouth. However I think that if the carbonation were a bit, and just a bit stronger so that it would last longer in the mouth and tickle the tongue a bit more, it would add to the beer. This beer also finishes dry now that I sit here after a few minutes without a sip and think about it. It is easy to drink and when I see this again I think I'll grab another one. Just wouldn't want to drink this when not in the mood, also don't think that I could drink to much of it in one sitting."
"Drinkability/Overall: Great beer. Quite strong and bitey. More of an advanced tasting beer."
"Cheers!"
"The bottle is really great looking. I like the pink elephants and lizards. The amber bottle is painted to look like stone or ceramics. DT pours a cloudy orange color with a huge white head. The head shrinks down to 1/2 inch and hangs in there. Some minimal lacing. The aroma begins as soon as the cap starts to bend under the opener. By the time you pour it into the glass, the aroma (something like a Hefe Weizen) is very pronounced. This is my first Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I thought DT tasted very much like a Hefe. There is a citrus and astringent taste but the astringent part is much more balanced and acceptable than any Hefe I have had. I did not notice the high alcohol from the taste. The mouthfeel was good, not too heavy or light. If I didn't know and respect the ABV, I would consider this very drinkable, especially for someone who likes Hefe's better than I do."
"I must say, I had this on tap this time, but EVERY time in the past when Ive tried a bottle, there were huge clumpy yeast balls floating around in it."
"Taste is slightly bitter with a citrus overtone, spices assert themselves quite well. Creamy mouthfeel with a lingering bitterness on the palate. Overall, a pretty decent beer but not the best that Delirium has to offer."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol (and price) is a tad prohibitive, but this is very drinkable. Would be great to serve at a dinner with friends. Strong enough to stand up against flavorful foods, subtle enough to not be intrusive, but interesting enough to raise some eyebrows. Good stuff!"
"I am looking forward to trying this on tap sometime soon. Good beer that had a nice lasting impression on my palate, definitely not the first thing to have in a drinking session. As for my first BSPA, I will definitely search out some others because I am quite impressed by the style."
"Aftertaste was bitter, but this faded away pretty fast."
"Opinion: When you get a beer like this, it is hard to classify it. It is in the same category as Duvel, but it is in no way a Duvel clone. This beer is flavorful, while it has a reserved aroma. It is really clean, but I am afraid that this beer may be oxidizing a bit to make the dry chalky flavor more noticeable. This is a tasty beer, but I would like to look for a fresher example."
"Drinkability: This beer fits nicely into the style. It is strong but very drinkable provided that you have a designated driver. I encourage the drinker to allow the beer to warm up a bit to room temperature, as it brings a whole new level of taste to the beer."
"Taste; cloves and spices, a little lemony citrus, followed by that barnyard hay, and finishing with a bit of an alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but gets a bit of a hit due to a little to much carbonation for my liking. Wouldn't mind having more of these if they were available in my area."
"-UF"
"It's a slow sipper, due to the dryness and carbonation, but rewarding enough to keep working on. I wonder how it'd stack up after being aged?"
"Ah, what a special beer. Beautiful yellow to orange/amber color with an enormous, thick, rocky head that lasts. The smell is heady alcohol with yeast, sweet malt, and more alcohol. It is heady and wonderful. Drinkability is hurt a little by the booze, especially if it warms too much; but don't drink it too cold either. Wonderful stuff really. Perhaps not the most graceful alcohol in the world but very enjoyable."
"Pours a light yellowish-orange with a thick (and I mean THICK, watch how you pour this!) head that settles down to a 1/2 finger covering. WOW, higher than expected carbonation, tons of bubbles endlessly rising to the top of the glass. Aroma is almost candy-sweet & fruity. Taste is malty, with some hints of banana & clove thrown in. Very lively and crisp on the tongue with some alcohol bitterness on the swallow. Very smooth and almost TOO drinkable for an 8.5% abv belgian. I may be seeing those pink elephants sooner than I thought!! Damned good stuff!!!"
"Dance with the pink elephants as you enjoy this brew. Pours a light reddish-brown color, with not much head. The flavor is sweet, and seems to change from moment to moment. I can smell candy, spice, and fruit, but all at different sips. And sip you should, because the 9% ABV will trample you like a herd of elephants!"
"--Joey"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. This is something I'd make a regular in my rotation if I could afford to do so."
"A belgian beer, strong like a fruity, powerful beer like most of the belgian strong beers; beer with generous cuantity of alcohol; good like an appetizer; for cheese and german cuisine; in general a superior belgian beer; full bodied; try serve in a goblet glass; 90% recommended."
"The taste is a slightly sweeter extension of the nose. The candi sugar is on the forefront with some funky malty and yeasty flavors followed by a herbal, grassy hop. Very little bitterness despite the hoppiness, but has a dry alcohol burn in the finish. Has a very creamy body and coats the mouth for an even drier alcohol burn. This is a good one to enjoy as the weather begins to cool down."
"Overall, I've had better Belgian Strong Pale Ales, but I'd choose this over lots of other beers in a heart beat. Wish I had some fine cuisine to go with this tasty brew. Instead, I am dining on Kraft Mac & Cheese. Alas, such is the life of a BA in college."
"Drinkability; it improved as I got through it, but I'm afraid that this one is not really for me."
"The special bonus was no tangy aftertaste, like it was sitting for too long, or was stored in a tin can. Nice, clear, crisp, perfect!"
"Overall the taste is very smooth with medium to light carbonation. The beer is very easy to drink with a hidden high ABV to it. Great taste and such a smoothness that not all Belgians can do."
"Great beer. It kept evoking thoughts of grapefruit. A hint of tartness. Bitterness smooths out and does not linger. Of course classic Belgian yeast flavors. This is pretty much the definitive example of the style for me. I pick one of these up nearly every time i travel (since we don't have these in AL because of arcane beer laws yadda yadda)."
"Dangerously drinkable for the strength of this brew. Embarrassing that I had not reviewed this beer yet since I drink it quiet often. Flavor is very different when it is served on tap."
"This is a very nice beer, well balanced for its size. A good representation of the style, and a good blend of sweet and tart flavors. I think it could be a little more complex; there's no real spiciness to speak of, but it's still recommended."
"As for the taste... very very not bad. It goes down very easy, and you can barely taste the 8.7% alcohol content. Like the smell, the taste is slightly sweet and very complex, with numerous fruity textures involved. It's moderately carbonated, with a clean and refreshing aftertaste. This is one I'd definitely recommend, and one that I'd definitely pick up again."
"Much paler and lighter than I was expecting. As for the 9% ABV, but do not believe it. Could not find a hint of it in the beer. Served in a 10.5oz goblet it poured very pale gold. Very similar to apple juice. No head and no visible carbonation. However, there was just the slightest of carbonation that made this beer extremely light on the tongue with a slightly dry and crisp finish. Flavor was sweet malts at first without any recognizeable hops. Picked up just whiffs of a lot of other flavors, such as honey, cloves, pepper, lemon, yeast and fruit (apples). Threw the glass down far quicker than I intended."
"33cl bottle, pours a cloudy apricot color and makes a fluffy white head. Lacing cascades down my glass with very compact, dense bubbles drifting down as I imbibe this. Strong yeast in the nose with a hint of vinegar. Light peppery spice flavor with coriander, lemon, yeast and alcohol. Medium to full palate with peppery carbonation, finishes quite dry. Excellent strong pale, I really enjoyed it."
"The fact that it was ""elected the greatest beer ever"" is up for debate, but it was quite good."
"Drinkability is good nice have had before but haven't reviewed not the best but drinkable plus good and dangerous at 9%."
"Drinkability suffers a little due to high alcohol, and again, this bottle wasn't as drinkagle as I'd remembered. I'll write another review the next time I have the beer."
"Overall: Not a bad one by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't think this one hangs up there with the Duvels of the world. An enjoyable change of pace, but it's not going to become my go-to."
"I will, however, add into the equation that other Exotic beers I've had from this liquor store have not consistently been fresh, so I am definitely willing to give it a second chance, though I am not willing to shell out another $8 for 2 beers. For $8 I wish I had purchased Unibroue's Fin Du Monde, or Maredsous."
"Drinkability: Though this isn't the best example of the style, I think it's surely one of the best available. It's in line price-wise with other Belgians of the style, and it's certainly worth a shot, either for a caged and corked bottle or a 4-pack."
"overall: another slightly disappointing delirium. although a good beer, there are others in this style that, in my opinion, shine a little bit brighter. i'll let a bottle of this sit a year and see what i think then. but anyways, a good try, but overall, not my favorite."
"Plus, kick-ass bottle!"
"D: This beer is a workout for the senses. Very complex in taste and smell and one of my favorite Belgians to date. Highly recommended."
"A brilliant pale ale"
"11.2 oz bottle, capped and foiled. Pours a clear gold, with a big, billowy, fizzy head. Good lacing as well. Aroma is spicy and alcoholic with a bit of citrusy sweetness. Taste is sweet up front and quite spicy, with pepper, clove and coriander duking it out. Some fruity (orange rind, white grape) character as well. Finish is quick, slightly bitter and boozy. Very fizzy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable, but the alcohol will really sneak up on you. This definitely lives up to its balls out reputation. Maybe a little too effervescent, I wonder what would happen to this one with some time in the cellar."
"The drinkability of this monster beer is limited, because the moderation required in enjoying it. But this is a fine beer nonetheless."
"The mouthfeel is full enough for the style, but the abv and awkwardness of flavors almost kill the drinkability."
"Pours a pale hazy gold with a steady stream of carbonation and 2 fingers of white dense head and excellent retention. Smell is fruity--apple skins, pears, citrus, spicy coriander, and a slight bandaid scent. Taste is light and fruity, tasting like green apples, melon, and pears with a slight tartness in the middle giving way to a nice spicy clove finish. A slight alcohol warming is present. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, with a fine carbonation for a refreshing feel. This is a pretty good beer, but it's awfully pricey and there's several other Belgian pale ale's I think are a better value."
"Thanks for sharing Gabe!"
"Very clear golden colour topped by a fluffy, bright white head that receded quickly to a ring. Spicy aroma with cloves, some pepper, honey, and a little alcohol. Light texture with ample carbonation. Fruity flavour (berries and oranges) with more honey and slightly acidic. Plenty of spiciness, cloves and coriander, with a peppery finish. Alcohol warming is quite strong, but not overpowering or harsh. Finishes with some dryness and hop character. This is a very fine beer, and one that enjoyed quite a lot."
" oh my, how times have changed."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very... smooth. Silky. A good amount of bubbles makes this dance on my tongue. Feels great, and slowly warms you up. Can't taste the alcohol at all really- very sneaky tastyness. Quite drinkable, I'd say. Not a gulper, but not really a sipper, either. Somewhere in the middle. A very refreshing, tasty brew. God bless delirium beers."
"Bottle. Mmmm...interesting. Had to have two to get the measure of this one. Looks amazing, luminous light gold with big frothy white head, screaming ""drink me"" from my Duvel tulip. Strange on the aroma, belgian funk plus strong ketones (e.g. acetone), not unpleasant though. Taste has a very dry finish, but the ABV while apparent is hidden well. Palate is just right for me, plenty of fine carbonation results in a light touch and accentuates the flavours. Competent BSPA and very yummy."
"Cheers."
"Mouthfeel: Dry and sticky on the palate. Very nice and comfortable."
"Drinkability: Good. I usually can't drink more than one belgian at a time, but I think I could with this one."
"This beer is the reason I began seriously investigating craft brew and found BA in the first place. I could drink Delerium Tremens all day, but my day would be awfully short if I tried!"
"I love the stoneware-look bottle and the cartoony, colorful label complete with pink elephants and green, sunglasses-bedecked alligators. Craft beer should be fun and it's great to see such a fun-loving, silly ass label. Delirium Tremens impressed me more than I thought it would. It's a wonderful BSPA and is one that I'll be sure to buy again whenever I have the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel is robust thanks to the oh-so-generous grain bill, and the finish is classic Belgian with a yeast profile fading into nothing more than an invitation to enjoy another sip."
"Good mouthfeel, it's a medium bodied beer. Very Quaffable. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. Thanks Nsmit17 for sending this to me. Very good."
"Poured in a 10 oz. serving ath The Independant in Uptown, Minneapolis. Clightly hazed gold color, with a small white head, quite unnassuming visuals. Smell has a lot of banana in it, as well as some delicious belgian yeast, peppery hops and miscellaneous fruit. Taste is very clean and subtle. Tastes fruity up front, with a good alcohol presence. Banana and hops. This is a very good beer, if not too subtle, but good flavors and extremely drinkable. Almost anythin I would look for in a BSPA."
"Not a bad strong golden ale, but not particularly distinguished either. A bit plain and overly sweet without balancing dryness or depth."
"Very nice, fizzy champagne body and it goes down pretty smooth."
"Overall: I liked this beer, but I love Duvel and I love Dupont's Avec les Bons Veoux more. Still a solid representative of the strong golden ale style."
"Pours out golden colored with a big white head. Huge aroma. Spicy and fruity all at the same time. Truly a great smelling beer. The taste doesn't let you down either. Plenty of citrus taste with some pepper mixed in as well. The alcohol does not go unoticed. It does leave the inside of your mouth a little hot. Still, a beautifully crafted beer. I loved the bottle so much that I asked the waitress if I could bring it home with me. Actually, it was more me telling her that I was bringing it home with me and she complied, haha."
"In my book, Belgian beers come second to German beer only. And this is a bias on my part since I am from a German family. Regradles of this bias, Belgian beers are definetly worth a try by any beer aficianado. The packaging is definetly a plus in comparison to most American beers. The head is almost nonexistent and the Brussels lace is maintained for only a few short minutes. The taste is fruity than most, but compared to other beers I have sampled. Delirium meets my par standards for a Belgian brewed beer. Regardless of my biased sentiments, this beer is worth a try by any wannabe beer advocate. Something I would by for a second try."
"Smooth and easy to drink with a nice alcohol warmth that really doesn't warn you of the true strength of this brew. Comes in a funky fake stoneware bottle with pink elephants and green alligators on the label. A decent example of a really great beer style. ."
"A very nice ale, with a crisp smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is apparent but doesn't overpower. Delish."
"Poured out to the color of apple juice with a short lived bubbly head. Carbonation continued to rise through the brew well after being poured. A little lace was noted around the glass. Scent was almost like champagne, with a slightly vinegar-like quality. Flavors of hops were strong, as were notes of sugar and barley.Dry, smooth aftertaste. Heavy alcohol quality was noted, as this brew will get you feelin' it. Worth a try, but a bit pricey."
"Poured an apricot colored citrus punch looking color. When pouring, I had to slow it down to avoid too much head. The head is thick with nice retention and ample lace. It is white in color and tops off a cloudy and very bubbly brew. The aroma is like bananas and pineapple, very pungeant. The taste is very fruity and mildly sweet. The aftertaste lingers on the palate with some hints of hops. With 8.5%abv, I expected more of an alcohol taste, but only detected a very small trace. I could only drink one of these per night."
"Musky orange nose, faint spices. Smooth honey glides over the tongue, then a biting bitter citrus at the end. Alcohol also hits at the end lingering on the palate for a while. I can't say I like the balance here (or lack thereof). The flavors come at you a bit randomly and awkwardly. That said, this is a fairly nice, drinkable ale.. But I would prefer a better integration of the flavors."
"Decent beer, but I'd say it's only for fans of the style, I don't see it gaining converts."
"Overall, Delirium Tremens is a good beer; it is the most ""adventurous"" Belgian I've had thus far. I have had my horizons expanded slightly...it will be interesting to see how much I'll enjoy beers like this in the future."
"A great brew."
"($7.19 / 750 ml / 25.4 oz corked and caged white ""ceramic"" champagne style bottle with bright royal blue foil)"
"Pours a wonderful light hazy orange color with an enormous head that doesn't seem to ever die out. Smells wonderful, like bananas and summer-time fruits with a wheaty-hop undertone. Taste is equally pleasant, with a very smooth start and finish. Stimulates all your taste buds. Some citrus to it, but mostly bananas and hops, slightly like a witbier. Great well-rounded beer."
"Mouthfeel is peppery and oily, with a very small tinge of the alcohol noticeable, not enough to make it unpleasant. Goes down smooth and continues to make you wonder about the flavor, so I would say it is pretty drinkable, even with the medium-high ABV."
"good one to try"
"Tasted of fruit.. apricots? and honey which danced in your mouth. However, it isnt the cheapest of beers. Which is a drawback."
"Drinkability: Exceptionnal. This is the best strong beer I ever reviewed. A little expensive, but it really worthes a try! P.S. Foamer said LCBO removed this beer from its inventory. In Quebec, SAQ continues to sell it (even if they left most of the beer market to private stores.) Thanks God! Note to myself: I would like a green limon with this beer. It can be a valuable addition..."
"Sampled at the Southside Beer Expo, Frankfort, IL. Cloudy yellow with a fluffy head. Taste is tart and citrusy, more so than one expects from a Belgian. This is pretty popular among the Belgian beer aficianados in my area. I'm a little surprised that I haven't had a bigger sample by now."
"Let it be known that I bought this beer for the novelty, specifically because the Liquor Control Board of Ontario thought the joke was offensive and stopped selling it. Take that LCBO! It turns out to be a very tasty one, and one I will probably come back to. Cheers for being subversive!"
"Poured into a wine glass, it pours a pale honey color with 1/4 inch of head with some edge lacing and cling. The ale is rather hazy also. Aroma is interesting; I get the sense of pineapples along with some citrus tones and a bit of yeast. Not overly complex but lovely! Flavors is bitey yet clean with a fruity citrus flavor with a bitter finish of maybe some hops and yeast. At the cold temp it is served, the carbonation kills some of the flavor I was hoping for, but it is still pretty decent. Overall, it is a yummy brew, but would be better at a warmer temp."
"One of the most beautiful bottles on the shelf. Pours cloudy gold until the yeast calms at the bottom. Fruity and spicy. The head disappears much faster than Maudite's and (of course) Duvel's. Sweet, Bazooka Bubblegum. Sparkles in my mouth, doesn't sit still enough for me to fully grasp it."
"This is a very mellow Belgian Strong ale."
"Mouthfeel: Very light body, clean sweet malt finish with a bitterness that gets stronger after the sip."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very powerful beer that's kinda hard to handle. The alcohol spicyness is over the top. If that's your thing, this is our beer... but if not you may not enjoy it. The drinkability is average because of the high alcohol presence in the taste. Would aging help? I don't know. Anyways, above average for sure."
"Comments - This is a pretty good beer, and I bet it would be better fresh. I prefer Unibroue's Don de Dieu (which is also cheaper), but this stuff is definitely worth a try."
"This is a very good beer."
"It's truly a shame that I can't get this anymore."
"The notorious DT bottle, faux-ceramic, with the pink elephants, and the blue foil on the neck. This bottle is hard to miss. When I popped the cap, the bottle started to push the foam to the top rather quickly, threatening a spillover, so I had to pour quickly. A nice off-white head, leaving thick lace on the distinctive DT glass. The head receded rather quickly, but kept itself at a moderate level for the entire drink. In this bottle, I have thick, murky yeast sediment, which I do not remember when I had this last. Colossal chunks of yeast floating. Hmm. The beer is dull light amber, hints of orange. Massive grapefruit aroma is the initial smell. I actually quite enjoy the aroma: sugary peach and nectarine, with some spicy clove and yeast, with enough light caramel malt for balance. I also smell tomato juice and brown sugar. At the same time, there is some smell which is off-putting to me, which I cannot quite describe. The flavour does the aroma no justice. I was expecting more fruitiness, and more body. Soapy yeast at first, with some dryness starting in the middle and following through to the finish, leaving very little aftertaste. Citrusy grapefruit, light malt, some hop bittering, and a definite alcohol presence. The taste is definitely not as complex as the aroma. Medium-bodied: in fact, it tastes quite watery; for a strong pale ale this should have much more weight in the mouth. Medium carbonation. DT is not terribly drinkable, with the yeast mustiness and the alcohol. Not quite the defining example for the Belgian Strong Pale Ale class, despite what some might say."
"I raise my glass and toast to all the Ontarioans who cannot enjoy this fine ale because of the insensitivity of the LCBO."
"Drinkability: This is a brew to contemplate rather than to drink; one is enough for a quiet evening"
"The aroma that came out of the bottle when I opened it was disarming like no other beer i've smelled. It was a sweet, fruity candy smell with some notes of cider. the head was bright white and bubbly which showed off the high level of carbonation. The first taste is tart and cidery followed by malt flavors more complex than the light color would indicate. Late earthy notes of the yeast lend to an entertaining finish in this very refreshing brew."
" DT is a favorite. The only bad thing I can say about it is that I have to drive a hundred miles to get it."
"The bottle looks fantastic. The ceramic look is a nice touch and the characters on the blue and pink label are so creative and strange, awesome"
"If you ever get the chance to get this, do not second guess the choice."
"Bottled In the 330ml painted bottle with the signature pink pachyderm. A clear blond straw color...fine bubbled carbonation from bottle conditioning. Frothy white head. Aromas of floral hopping some fruit and musty yeast...very Champagne-like in smell and apperance. Weakly oily palate, hops are subdued in the body, sweetish some spritzyness and detectable alcohol that leaves a yeasty-cider impression when it mingles with the saaz hops and finishes rather abruptly with not much after taste but the alcohol warming. Not the experience I expected after all the hype."
"Taste is lightly fruity (apples, plums) and spicy (pepper, coriander). Hints of lemon. Dry and crisp. Also sour toward the end and lightly bitter in the finish. A medium bodied ale and dry. Pretty good stuff although I am not overwhelmed. I'll buy it again."
"""What is the deal with the Pink Elephants on the label?"" is a common question I get. I tell folks that this beer is from Amsterdam and is spiked with LSD. While this is not true as far as I can tell, it makes a great story for beer luddites."
"Stylish opaque bottle, what's inside? Pours a hazy golden yellow with a whitish head that laces very well. Very pleasing aroma of cloves, cirtus, and apples. Taste was quite complex apples, cherries, spicy on the exhale, sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel was light and bubbly, but not aggressive. This is a very good beer, I'd like another. :)"
"Light and deceptive in terms of its 8.5%abv. A treat and an ale that is worth a try if you like the style. Complex in flavor and very pleasant all around."
"I didn't really care for this beer after the first sip, but it grew on me as I drank it. By the time half the chalice was gone, I was really enjoying it."
"As many reviewers of this brew have stated, I expected more after reading many recommendations to it's excellence. It is tasty, but I don't care for the phenolic aftertaste that lingers after a sip. Perhaps it's the alcohol that overshadows the typical Belgium complex flavors, but it leaves me puzzled. The mouthfeel is grainy and not smooth like I'd anticipated. Too bubbly and champaign like for my taste."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light and refreshing pale malt scent with a dry, fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a spicey pale malt flavor with a dry, yet fruity finish that warms a little on the way down. It tastes like there is some corriander in here that adds a slight peppery feel. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good Belgian pale ale. It has excellent aroma and flavor; a good drinker."
"Tasty and very drinkable at 8.5% ABV. Overall, an enjoyable brew."
"On tap at RedBones. This came out of the tap a bright clear gold. Good light white head with Champagne like bubbles. Nice lace almost as if on nitro. Light floral vanilla aroma. Great vanilla flavor in the front, with fruity esters in the middle. Great light mouth feel very drinkable."
"All and all a highly recommended beer, in my opinion. I would love to try this one with a thick piece of steak."
"Very much enjoyed this beer, fine example of a Belgian ale."
"Picked up a bottle of this for a bbq at my sister's house. Had to pour it into a normal pint glass as that was the only glass available. The glass struggled to contain a massive fluffy white head. This head rested upon an appetizing golden color. Smell is very fruity and yeasty. With some spiciness rounding out the nose. Taste was a little unbalanced in my opinion. Some spicy yeastiness and a little hoppiness were overwhelming for me, not much of a malt base or fruity esters to balance out the flavor profile. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this beer a lot, I would just like for it to become more well rounded. Mouthfeel is nice as is drinkability. Definately glad I tried it, but this is not my favorite Belgian Pale."
"A damn fine Belgian pale, crisp, fruity with some nice subtleties. I will visit this one again, it definitely satisfies a certain craving. Dont mistake lack of hype with lack of substance."
"As this sits sits on the tongue it becomes more and more mellow. Very pleasing mouthfeel and high octane aroma."
"A beer so good the elephant on the label is drunk. When I meet people who have never tried a Belgian style beer before, this is the first thing I point them towards. It has a pronounced sweetness and fruit character to it (pear and apple) and a solid body that doesn't really feel heavy at all because of the high carbonation. Great out of the bottle and fantastic out of the tap, in moments of indecision, with the car running outside the liquor store and only moments to choose, grabbing this has never led to regret."
"All in all, a good, easy to drink, easy to find beer. I like it a lot and it's a staple around the nogood household."
"The taste is suprisingly smooth especially considering its alcohol content. I can tell that it is strong, but not in a burning sence more like a pleasant warming. I was pleased to find little clove in this beer and ditto on the phenols. There is a subtle almost fruity flavor reminiscant of the apples from the cork, but it is rather subtle and I think it blends with the beer nicely."
"This one pours a large white fizzy head on top of a cloudy yellow body. The smell is musty, with light fruit and clove. The mustiness carries over into the flavor where is detectible along with some hops on the finish. The rest of the flavors are spicy clove at first, and some alcohol coupled with light bitter hops in the middle. The mouth feel is lively and fizzy."
"Overall: This is one powerful beer - not only in alcohol, but flavor. I normally like my Belgians to be a little more mellowed out, but this did me just fine. It's raw, unrestrained, and full of complexities that many beers (even some Belgians) are not. Highly recommended!"
"The taste was dry and not as sweet as I expected. Thick and grassy, lacking some subtlety. Some citrus, but I wanted more fruits. Still, the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. It's not a bad beer, but not a great one either."
"Notes: Makes a great after dinner drink. Great beer, should've bought more of these."
"on tap, pours a very light straw/amber color, a bit cloudy, white delicate head, leaving classic Belgian lacing. Sugary, yeasty, spicey nose. Notes of apricots, raisins, candi sugar, smoke. Complex and interesting stuff. Alcohol present, but fairly well in the background. Medium bodied. highly carbonated. I love this stuff, give it a try! my wife still refers to this stuff as ""Rocket fuel"" even after trying it many times."
"Hides the alcohol well and is delicious on a cool winters night."
"Strange thing here, I have always really liked Tremens, but the first thing I noticed in the warmed glass of ale was a taste similar to adult cough syrup... not the yummy flavored ones that you would sometimes take an extra swig of... more like nyquil or the ones you feel the need to do a chaser after. Dont know if it was just this batch, or this nights... but it left me very disappointed."
"Served in a goblet, poured from a bottle. At first you notice this beer has a nice color that one could compare with champagne. The head quickly dissapates after pouring. The smell is fruity with a light accent of hops. The smells really come out if served a little warmer. The taste was something very special as it hides the alcohol content well. Flavors are very complex and not too bitter. I have to say this is one of the best tasting brew I have ever had. This is just as good as Piraat. If you can afford to pay $80 for the case I would suggest this as a beer that is worth the investment. Finish a bottle and you are on your way to pure relaxation. Strong ales never let me down."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers- not one I want every day, but I look forward to have it on special occasions."
"Shows very pale and almost lager looking. The nose is horseblankets and hops and the lager look is destroyed. The intial taste is actually subtle and smooth. This much like Duvel though with less complexity. I fopund it to be very drinkable and well crafted. It's reputation seems to be big and rough but the truth is this is a very nice Belgian Ale with little roughness. Cool bottle too which means that this should be picked up if available."
"It served well as a way start forgetting a lame work week, and finished well as an appetizer and early desert. It shouldn't be paired with spicy tuna rolls."
"Notes: Head and lacing was disapointing. Label sells the bottle, there were no stand-out characteristics."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a huge bubbly head with minimum retention. Aroma is a mix of malt and spice in the traditional Belgian style. Taste is again a mix of malt with some spices (quite hard to figure out which one is actually included), which drags a bit too long at the end. Alcohol is well hidden, which is always appreciated. Carbonation is standard with a body that I was expecting a bit more strong. Overall, this is a good Belgian ale but not the best that Ive tasted."
"This is a fine brew and one that I would come back to if I had the chance."
"Very drinkable and I wish I had more to enjoy. The alcohol is completely absent, and at 8,5% can sneak upoh damn!"
"Beautifuly decorated 11.2 oz bottle poured a hazy yellow with a white head. I give this 4.5 for appearance due to the fact the head stayed fluffy through the whole time. Bubbly carbonation was very active. Very aromatic, you can almost tell what its going to taste like without taking a sip. The taste is nicely complex with a piney, citrusy flavor and dry peppery, and herbal finish with a warmth of alcohol. From the few of this style I have tasted, this one represents them well. Very drinkable, though at this ABV (and price) I would take it easy, as this one is satisfying with just one."
"pours typical belgian golden straw and tall, fluffy whit ehead. Smells of dusky dank barnyard, hay and overripe fruit. Taste is yeasty, breadlike with leather, wood and tobacco flavors. The finish is dry, mildly citrus hops. A decent brew, and one I will have again, butnot one I will seek out"
"I sampled this brew at RFD in DC. The beer came in a tulip glass which was nice. Bright gold in color but only a minimal white head surface layer is present. Aroma is very fruity with raspberry and cherry coming through, some candied sugar and bready yeast scents. The first sip reveals small yet prickly carbonation and thicker than average body. The flavor is spicy, I am hit with nutmeg and cloves right away and also hits of tart fruit like granny smith apples. The finish is a little peppery and slightly drying as well. This was a real treat on tap and I am glad to finally see it coming into CT in bottles now too."
"Overall Impression: One of those ""classic"" eye-catching Belgian ales. Everyone recognizes the painted bottles and the pink elephants. This is one of the first few Belgian beers I ever tried (way, way back...). The unique presentation and mythical elephant is definitely more impressive than the beer. Other than that, it's not particularly outstanding."
"Had 2 years later on tap at Beer Bistro and it would get the same rating. Overcarbonated, good level of yeast and some fruitiness including aftertaste."
"I see that this beer is somewhat highly acclaimedby other BAs. Did I get a bad bottle, or what? I don't know. But i'm in no hurry to buy another to find out."
"On draught at the Lowlander in London. Pours a pleasing gold color with a medium thin eggshell white head. Light lacing throughout. The aroma is fruity and wheaty. Light-bodied and effervescent, with a nice blend of flavors such as coriander, citrus, banana and yeast. The alcohol is detectable here and there as well. The finish is sparkling like champagne. I haven't had the bottled version of this yet but I can't imagine it being better than this."
"This beer poured a somewhat hazy yellow color with a big frothy head. The head dissapates rather slowly and leaves a nice lacing along the glass. The aroma was very heavy on the yeast with some fruity undertones lingering underneath. This is a medium-bodied beer whose taste is well balanced between the pale malts and some spiciness and bitterness on the tail end. The alcohol is also present in the taste as well, although it is not overwhelming. The drinkability is above average as the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Overall, this is a good beer but I do not see myself including it in my regular rotation."
"Golden color with slight orange tint, no haze. White fluffy head that lasted about half way through. Carbonation was high, but appeared visually even higher than it was. Constant vents of tiny bubbles from the bottom center of the glass. Taste is sweet with fruity citrus notes. Finishes a bit dryer but still some sweetness left in your mouth. A nice, crisp ale that even at 9% could be enjoyed anytime."
"The finish is strong, but it still leads one to the next sip. This is definitely one of those things that everyone needs to try at least once."
"Overall the drinkability suffered because there were just too many flavors, and it was a bit tart. Maybe after a few years I will give it a try, but a beer brewed just to be contrary, it seems."
"Thx"
"Belgian pales are one of my favorites style. This ranks high for me."
"This was just an excellent Belgian ale all the way around. This is a well-crafted beer and an excellent introduction to the style for someone who might be new to Belgian strong pale ales."
"on tap at monk's: cloudy orange-tinted brown with an awesomely dense creamy head. lively carbonation zipping through the glass. substantial lacing. pale fruity aroma with that signature belgian spiciness. light to medium body. spicy fruit flavors stand out most, with a pronounced yeast flavor in the middle. sweetness is balanced decently by a sublte saaz like hopiness. goes down easy for a relatively big ABV brew. seems like a nice strong belgian ale to start someone out with. pleasing flavors that are put together well and not too over the top. better on draught that in the bottle."
"overall,it looked and acted like a classic Belgian, but I would prefer to drink a Chimay or a Unibroue belgian style."
"Served a slightly cloudy golden color with a thin white foamy head. Fruity and yeasty aroma-- hints of citrus, sweet malt, and a touch of spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet carbonated. Initial taste is laden with spices and yeast. Fruit flavors of pear and apricot emerge midway. 8.5% alcohol warms the back of the throat and continues on the way down. Dangerously drinkable yet high abv limits my desired consumption for another. It's a beer I can handle one of and than move on. The taste overall doesn't particularly appeal to me. It's a little too yeasty and musty for me."
"Very drinakble. A sipper."
"After taliking to the Feloniusmonk, I decided to give a Belgian ale another try. I really want to like them advocates, but you know, I give up. I know this to be a well thought of beer, but still I don't get it. Orangey golden color was topped by a solid white head, lacing was attractive in the forms of wispy rings. Aroma was that typical spicy clove like character that I have detected in all the belgian beers I have tried. Taste was spicy and fruity and a bit smoother than others. Still I don't find it appealing. Very sprtitzy mouthfeel, almost champagne like. Very alcoholic and powerful at 10%. I tried."
"Appearance: Golden amber hue, huge white head classic Belgian style lacing. Aroma: RIch spices and honey tones accentuate the malt profile very soft with a bite of finishing hops and alcohol thrown in there. Taste: Clove influenced tone awesome full flavor of syrupy rich sugary malt profile with unrelenting spices there as well. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied great stuff syrupy texture. Drinkability: Great watch that abv but it's damn good staple if your getting into the Belgian ales, and pink elephants what more could you want, not alot of repetitive drinkability here get's boring ready to move on to my next rare Belgian bier."
"This is tart, acidic, and very dry -- surprisingly so and, I'm sorry to say, disappointingly so."
"Delerium Tremens poured a cloudy gold/yellow color with a nice head. The aroma was strong and yeasty (mostly cloves). The taste was bitter and very sour. It was really hoppy and citrusy (mostly grapefruit) with malt way in the background. As it warmed the malt became a bit more pronounced and some sweetness started coming into play, but not enough for me. The finish was dry and citrusy. I'm sure there was a lot going on here but it was not to my tastes."
"Light gold color with big, frothy (almost soapy) head. Aroma is characteristic of a Belgian Golden. Strong green apple presence in the taste. Effervescent body that warms up to a smooth silkiness in the mouth. Not quite what I expected, but not disappointing in any way."
"This came to me with good sized (2"") white head that stayed around for several minutes and dissipated down to a small frothy head and eventually just some lacing by the time I finished. It was a nice yellowy gold color. This had a nice light smell...nothing outstanding. The taste was slightly malty with some bitter flavors that I can't describe. There was a little fruit flavor as well. This was a very nice beer on-tap and I would certainly have it again."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Good overall."
"I marked its drinkability lower than the other judging points primarily because the flavor was good, but not too exciting. And again, the olfactories were taken for a spin by the alcohol. Also, I would have preferred the bubblegum flavor to play second fiddle to at least some other type of natural sweetness -- perhaps a nice honey to match the beer's color. I'm beginning to think the Belgian Strong Dark Ales are more suited to my tastes, but I'll give the pales more chances in the future."
"Overall, not bad, but there are plenty other Belgian strong pale ales I'd rather have--though I do love the pink elephants."
"There's nothing to rave about, but neither is there anything to actively dislike, and it's certainly better than just average. The sparkling personality and sweet/sour interplay center some nice peripheral flavors, but it's not so much balanced as distinctly segmented. It seems to resist a real integration of flavors, preventing the whole from outstripping the sum of the parts. The ABV ever stepped forward, but it's there, and that along with the noted limitations keep the overall drinkablity a touch above average. It's not that I'm disappointed; I'm just not especially impressed."
"The taste is of floral overtones with a rich sweetness. The hops cut off at the back end and leave a pleasant dry after bite. Real nice beer. I had this with some olives and venison bologna and it was a bit of a clash. I recommend drinking this beer alone and enjoyng it all by it's little self"
"A big hearty thanks to the Choralis Board of Directors for this particular bottle."
"This is very drinkable. The 8.5%abv could really wreak some havoc on the unwary beer drinker. A few of these, and the pink elephants they see might not all be on the label."
"Another Belgian in the tradition of Chimay Blau. If you like that one, try this one. A LOT of clove in the mix. Unfortunately, not my favorite spice. PHENOLIC. That about says it. A spicy beer (citrus and banana present), little head, no lacing. I think I'd pass on a repeat."
"Served in an official DT snifter, complete with pink elephants, compliments of the clerk at Half Time, who threw it in with my last purchase. (Thanks, Half Time!!!) The cork had a date of 2003. It poured with a clear golden body, and a huge fluffy white head. The aroma was citrus, clove, banana. Tastes were lemon, clove, banana, leather, coriander, ginger. The mouthfeel was smooth and light, and finished with grapefruit and leather. Not as complex as other Belgians I've had, but a nice variety of flavors well-executed. A good choice, to send me over the top into the Mug Club, almost one year since I joined BA!"
"Outrageously overpriced and overrated. No big deal..."
"Bought a big botle for $6.99. I had wanted to try it for a while and finally got around to buying it. Poured a clear gold with a big foamy head. Sweet fruity aroma. Nice malt presence. A good body with a nice crisp flavor and bite. The alcohol is subdued under a layer of malts. Very good. I would recommend highly."
"Started out New Year's Eve with a nice bottle of this at Harry's Bar and Grill in Milwaukee. I have had this beer before but did not want to review it without a recent experience. I loved the deep golden color and sweet aroma that came out of this brew. The taste is very balanced in your mouth and the alcohol is hidden but still warms the body as it goes down. This is a little better than Delirium Nocturnum. Happy New Year!"
"Crystal yellow look with an apple cider smell. Also there is some ABV warmth in the nose as well. Very dry and fruity taste as well as a dry tongue as well. The brew reminds me of dry apple cider. Very good taste I like the crisp clean nature of the brew. Medium mouth with nice coating malt and a good kick of ABV in the finish. Not much head or retention on the goblet. Solid very pale dry beer. Had it at The Abbaye in Philly."
"This beer is infinitely better on draught."
"11.2 oz bottle, capped not corked, with the most annoying foil wrapping in the industry. Pours into a goblet a clear honey gold with an enormous white pillowy head. Excellent retention and sheets of lacing. Nose is of overripe bananas. Mouthfeel has plenty of carbonation and seems a bit thin. Initial taste of lemony citrus, evolving into sweet malts. Hops come forth about midway, and a dry hop bitterness rules until the goblet empties. Slight alcohol burn is present to remind you of the high abv. There's a mustiness here, as well, as with so many Belgians. Clean aftertaste. Not my favorite Delirium, and its taste doesn't live up to its promising appearance. Still, a nice Belgian Pale Ale I wouldn't mind keeping around."
"ng"
"Notes: Liquor store two blocks from my house has a very, very, good selection of Belgian ales - and this is just one of many. I really like this one, but nothing jumps out an says 'I am better than the rest!'. Good to try out, but nothing to make an evening of or buy regularly."
"It is very good, but I just couldn't see myself drinking this very often."
"Good for celebrations; I'm not sure how down-in-the-cups one could stay with a glass of this."
"Great bottle--reminds me of the Simpson's where Barney calls upon his pink elephant by drinking beer to counteract the demons he sees after drinking the peyote infused juice drink Homer makes. Pours a nice hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. Smells of sweet marshmallows, esters, citrusy hops, and yeast. Taste is sweet and malty, kinda wheaty, candy, with a good hop presence. Bitter finish with a little metallic taste. Warming and alcoholic. Big and syrupy, but manageable."
"Another good one from Huyghe. The golden body is joined with a beautiful head and decent lace effect. A creamy smooth body lifts the drinkability of this big beer, but it does not feel weak in fullness. The nose is heavily fruited and has an incredible malt sense when warmed. Flavorful and full of complexity, this is a very good tasting brew."
"A fine translucent golden color, highly effervescent and a full frothy head. The aroma is fruity, with bubblegum and some hops in the background. It has a sweet smooth start and a fine crisp finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and effervescent. DT's is a well-balanced clean combination of opposing attributes -- delicate without being free of character."
"s.d."
"Pale yellow with a white lace that staws there to the end of the glass. Sweet and medicinal nose. Effervescent leads off the taste followed by a lovely honey toffeelike sweetness that clears to a warm alcohol burn. Quite potent, in fact i'm not typing well now. Highly recommended."
"Beer poured a yellowish color with a decent head. The nose detected some yeastiness in the aroma. The sweet malt started mellow on the tongue during initial swigs, but seemed to grow stronger through the drink. A nice balance of bitterness offset the growing sweetness. There was some lacing of the glass. The alcohol was very prevelent in this, so one is more than enough in one sitting."
" After working my way through the powerful carbonation, I get a lot of maltiness. Alcohol is not hidden well, but does not hurt the beer too much. A little bit of bready, yeasty flavors come in, but that is about it. The complexity of the aroma was really lost in the flavor. The body is medium to full. It is pretty drinkable, but a bit boring to me. It is a pretty good brew, but it does not stand up to others in its class."
"Drinkability  This one just didnt do it for me. The absence of a strong malt base made this one go down more like a witbier than a BSPA."
"This brew came bubbling out of the bottle as soon as the bottle cap was pried off. It pours with a large bubbly head that receds to about a half inch rocky head. Color is a hazy light bronze and has lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Doesnt seem to be much aroma from this one, although some malt and alcohol are noticeable. Lots of carbonation immediately hits the tongue giving the feeling of a large mouthfeel. Theres a warming sensation all the way down. Creamy, sweet malt start that tastes of fruits and bubblegum with some light citrus tastes towards the end. Some yeast is noticeable both on the tongue as well as some particles floating around the glass. The finish is slightly spicy and bitter and lingers for a time. This is a fairly complex brew that seems to improve as it warms a bit."
"On tap poured into a Delirium tulip-style glass. It pours a clear light golden color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly fruity, with banana and white grape. There is also some clove spice present. The taste is fairly malty with cloves and fruity esters. The taste is fairly sweet. The body is just a little bit light. The drinkability is fairly nice for 8.5%. A nice sweet treat."
"A pretty bold ale overall, strong alcohol presence, and it goes down with a bit of a struggle. Watch out for those 9% pink elephants, they outnumber you and will very easily knock you on your ass if you're not careful, leaving you for the remaining reptiles to feast on."
"Poured from the white 12 oz bottle, Delirium Temens is the fizziest out of the bottle beer I have seen in a while. A typical slow angled pour into a glass yielded about 75% white foam, 25% golden belgian beer. Aroma is highly yeasty, surrounded by fruit of the loom grapes, apples and bananas. The white foamy head dissipates slowly as I drink the tremens. Surprising spice in the flavor that I didn't notice in the aroma - clove maybe, leaves a lingering tang of alcohol on the tongue. Also taste the yeast prominently, balances well with the other esters and general sweet flavor. Body is medium at most. A decent beer but not something I'd search for; I'd be interested to try it on draft though, I think it could lend a lot more to the beer."
"Drinkability: just a bit better than average. Overall, not too bad but a bit off due to the ill-concealed alcohol content. I can find others of this style I'd rather have."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color with a moderate head and some lacing on the glass. The aroma was similar to the Delirium Noel but with not as much spice. Bartender tapped it into a really cool Delirium tremens goblet that had the pink elephants on it. The flavor was a little strong at first, but I got used to it after a few drinks (maybe the alcohol numbed my tastebuds). I really didn't care much for the flavor because the spicyness was too strong and the wheat/yeast flavor was too prominent."
"It has a nice crisp feel to it but because of the wheatiness of the brew it builds in the mouth. An unpleasant overwhelming mouthfeel."
"Overall I have to say this is a medium good beer, it's not bad but I'd definately choose a number of other brews ahead of this one. That's why I'll go against the stream and will not give it a superrating. My 0.02$."
"Pours out a murky golden brown. Smell is yeasty, with some malt overtones and spiciness. Taste is smooth, a little spice (maybe allspice) in there with the fruity malt characterand the alcohol backbone. Nice solid tasty offering. Will drink this again without hesitation.."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a huge blooming head,the aroma is a little spicey and fruity.The taste was definently yeasty and spicey with some juicy fruit notes as well.This beer has some very yeasty flavors to it the alcohol creeps up on ya after it sits awhile.Pretty good Belgian pale but thought it might be a little better."
"Darkish color 1""head, beautiful aroma, almost champagne like, sweet, carmelly, a little thick, yet nicely bubbly, full round exquisite taste. A real classic. My next mission, now that a neighbor several reviews ago mentioned that it was on tap on the east side, is to try what I assume will be the river of Eden. A classic!!"
"Light gold color, large white foamy head. Yeast and Vanilla in the aroma. Sweet and fruity. Flavor of apples, vanilla, coriander, clove and orange. Not much of a hop taste. Alcohol is prevalent. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and a little dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Interesting, but kind if average.."
"Mouthfeel is solid and coating, fairly heavy, and believe me, I know heavy. Above average carbonation makes my mouth tingly and happy, Usually, a 9%er such as this limits itself for drinkability, but the multi-layered flavors make it hard to say no, especially out here in the savannah after eating roots and shrubs all day. So I will give it a few bonus points for that as I struggle mightily to lift my heavy frame to all fours and once again seek out my pack to rejoin, ultimately social creature that I am."
"This beer was served a pale yellow color that had a slight haze to it. Decent head that was white in color with good density, and while it lasted, it created a nice lace approx ½ the way down the glass, then as the foam subsided to nothing, but a small ring, the lace became non-existent. The aromas were of dried fruits (pears, strawberry, tropical), spices, light hops, some sweet malt and a hint of yeast and alcohol. The flavors were dominated by the fruits (pineapple), some spices (clove, pepper), hops, sweet honey, malt (light), yeast, and nice warming alcohol. Finished with a slight dryness mixed with alcohol on the tongue. Medium bodied. Sweet, spicy and dry came to mind while drinking this beer. All the flavors seemed to be very nicely balanced; each aroma and flavor seemed to compliment one another well. A must try."
"Overall: A formidable belgian brew well worthy of its marketable name. This beer is at its pinnacle when at cellar temparature, as with many belgians."
"750 ml bottle. Poured a clear golden color, with a massive head that stuck around for quite awhile. Leaving lots of nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruity, almost like a Weizen with it's banana like aroma. Taste is again like that of a weizen with a spiciness, that leaves behind an rather odd taste. Heavy on the carbonation, and a dry finish. But I find that I really don't care for this. It was ok but i'd pass on this again."
"Light colored body with a phenolic aroma that brings out some spicyness to it. First taste is of a malt sweetness that I can only accumulate to as honey. More nondescript sweetness comes into play later. Lots of spices are here. Mainly noticeable is pepper from the phenols. Alcohol is definitely noticeable and gives this beer an added dimension. The finish is a fruity one. Tasty."
"Either I accomodated or the flavor got a little less intense as I continued to pour. Very slight phenol quality. Really quite smooth, especially considering the strength of the alcohol. Nice clean finish, with only a slight dryness that remains. For an ale it actually does beer cooler that warmer. I certainly don't appreciate this like others, but this is a nice beer. If all the subtlties of the aroma were evident in the flavor I'd give it a highter rating. Maybe it's a freshness issue. Nonetheless an enjoyable beer and one worthwhile for a celebration."
"Strong delicious ale with very nice Belgian Lace. The alcohol is present throuhgout this very serious, very strong ale. Refreshing and delicious with hints of vanilla, and coriander. This is one of the finest beers in the world and always worth seeking out, though not as complex as the bottle version."
"Mild aroma similar to a Hefe Weizen I recently had. It has a light yellow orange color with a short head that disappears quickly. It tasted a little sweet/sour to me. Not a bad taste, but I also think my taste buds were a little off from a recent dinner. It gave me a bit of an initial tingly feeling on the roof of my mouth that lasted a fair length of time."
"I rate it highly but lowered the drinkability as to suggest its high alcohol content may fool you when drinking one-after-another of this excelent brew."
"Pour is a hazy golden peach, with a large, solid white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is yeasty, fruity (apples and pears), slight peppery spice in the back. Flavor is sweet, lot's of apple, some mild spiciness comes in the middle to the end. Medium-full bodied, dry ending."
"My favorite part of this beer would have to be the bubbles. They don't stop. It keeps the beer refreshing, and very deceptive regarding it's alcohol content - until you stand up. I will certainly be purchasing this beer again on my next trip."
"Perhaps I'm getting hard to please as I start to develop experience with different beers, but I was underwhelmed. Nothing exactly -wrong- here, just not a lot of overly right."
"Hey, didn't white bottles go out in the 70s, along with white shoes on runningbacks? Anyhow, it pours a good-looking gold with a fat white head. The smell is a nice combination of fruit with a slightly medicinal scent and noticeable hops. The taste is nice, but the alcohol isn't well-hidden. It worked better when paired with some Stilton than it did on its own. It's not bad, but it doesn't stack up all that well in the universe of Belgian Strong Ales."
"Overall, an excellent brew that was a delight to drink. A must for all to try"
"Drinkability: This brew goes down quite easily for being 8.5%abv. I could drink a few of these before they snuck up on me and had me seeing pink elephants..."
"Nice, crystal clear golden color. Aroma was sweet and alcoholic, very strong. Nice thin layer of head throughout. Lace clung to the glass all the way. Taste was sweet, then became citrusy with a hint of orange and maybe cloves. Mouthfeel was thick, rich and smooth. Alcohol taste was very noticeable. A delightful Belgian."
"Delirium Tremens with the Pink Elephant of the label should serve as a valid warning as to this brew's strength. The color is sort of a cloudy butterscotch with orange highlights. A strong alcohol fume rises upon opening followed by hop, clove and sweet malty aromas. Fully malted and highly hopped, this ale is full of raw and wild flavors. Somewhat herbal with a touch of sweetness. Lemon peel and yeasty flavors round this unfiltered, strongly alcoholic ale."
"Mouthfeel is remarkably light although a bit oily on the tongue. One of the finest and most complex beers I have ever come across. A perennial favorite of mine, my traditional birthday beer to share with friends, although I missed out this year."
"This is becoming one of my favorite Belgian ales. Great eggshell painted bottle with little pink elephants on the label. Nice pour of orange tinted cloudy golden body and white froth. Aroma of fruit and a little yeasty. First few sips seemed very effervescent bot smoothed out as it rested. Flavor is great with fruit and and spices with a definate yeast and alcohol presence. Overall sweet and dry. Reminds me of one of the Chimay beers I've had before"
"Great head on this one, light, very light, and bright white, reminicent of Duvel. The taste was not what I exspected, sweeter than many artisanal pales that I have had though this was not a bad thing. Sour finish like the taste of a grannysmiths apple. The alcohol is very subtle fot the stregnth of this beer, which is 8.5% not 9 as listed above. A very solid beer though I think its winning the world beer champoinships is a little bit much. Not as good as some N. American beers ever, say Fin Du Monde or Hennepin. Still, a great one."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with an abundant head that remained very well. The abundant carbonation helped to ensure that I had a dose of head with each taste. The smell was dominantly sweet and fruity, I noticed a hint of a raison, but there were also hints of spice and yeast. The taste was both sweet and sour, almost like a green apple, but very pleasant and fairly complex. The carbonation and medium to light body made this a very pleasant beer on the palate. This beer also finished surprisingly crisp. Overall this was a very enjoyable brew, but I think if I had the choice I would rather have a Hennepin or a Fin Du Monde. Nevertheless this beer is in elite company, its just not at the top of the pile in my book."
"Granny Smith apples are the first thing that comes to mind after tasting this beer. I've never really had a beer that tasted like this before. Surprisingly sour with a citric twang to it. Also deceptively strong considering how easy it is to drink. Not sure I'd buy it again at $9/bottle, but definitely a very interesting beer."
"Brilliant golden color, with a thick off-white head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is sweet and fruity, and medicinal. The flavor has a mild sweetness, with fruity flavors. It is a bit astringent, with a drying finish. It is medium bodied, but has an alcohol content that will sneak up on you. A very delicious, easy drinking brew."
"Pours honey-colored yellow, looks thicker than it is. Sweet and somewhat fruity in flavor. It's missing something though. I'd say it's fair to say this is reasonably similar to Duvel in some respects, and Duvel just has this liveliness and spice that adds something. This one is a bit more straightforward with that fruit candy sweetness characteristic to some of the stronger Belgians. Tasty for sure but could be a wee bit better."
"Orange in color witha thick white head. The explosiveness of the cabronation is evident both from the loud pop upon releasing the cork, and the way the bubbles simply rocket up to the top of the glass. Aroma is yeasty, with plenty of spiciness, some orange zestiness, and berry-like fruitiness. Flavor is maltier than I'd expected, and lightly hopped. Alcohol flavor is mild, and aftertaste is cherry-like. I actually found it to be a bit too sweet until I added the yeast -- this gave the flavor a bit more zing and helped to balance. Full bodied and velvety smooth in texture. A very decent beer."
"One of the Belgian-ist Belgians I've tried. The malt was almost a little overpowering for my taste, but was balanced out with nice lemon and coriander flavors, with a hint of spice. The head was huge (and a beautiful color and consistency), and even though I though I poured it properly it still ran over! The color was a cloudy pale gold, with only a faint aroma of lemon and malt. Alcohol was fairly noticeable, which leads me to believe the content may be a bit higher than 9.0%. I also noticed that the flavors became more subtle and pleasant as the beer warmed slightly and was exposed to the air. All in all, a nice offering, but guess I'm still a Chimay devotee."
"I dont think I could have picked any other better beer for my 100th review than this one. This is an all-around great beer. It pours a clear golden/orange color with tons of carbonation. Its topped off by a thick and fluffy white foam that fades down into a 1/4-inch head, which retains itself for the entire duration, leaving a sticky lace splattered on the side of the glass. This beer is bursting with a huge arsenal of aromas. Bananas, coriander, malt, alcohol and grapefruit are very prominent, intermixed with subtle hints of vanilla and hops that are blended together splendidly to give this beer an extremely complex nose. I detected a different scent every time I took a whiff. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma. The spiciness of coriander and the tanginess of citrus fruit hit the taste buds first, followed by a mild sweetness, possibly the banana, and then finished off with a mellow bitterness of hops. The vast array of flavors masks the alcohol taste quite well. The high carbonation level gives this brew almost champagne-like qualities, which tickles my tongue. This is an extremely balanced and complex beer, theres so much going on. If it werent for the high cost ($8.99 per bottle) I would always have this beer on hand. I just cant say enough about this beer."
"Smells of fresh lemon and orange with a bit of floral hop notes, very strong on the nose, quite citrusy. Taste is a smooth lemony delight with a little sweet, bitter malt at the start and jumps right into the lemon and orange peels and mixed with a fresh, floral hop and spice. Very good feel, some dryness to it, but its very citrusy wet and smooth. Drinkable, yes sir indeed."
"A beer that will bring a smile to your face."
""
"The nose is Belgian spiciness, strong citrus and very sweet. The front is sweet, spicy, schpritzy. The middle is sweet apples with some alcohol. The finish is dry and fresh, with spice and alcohol. It's just a little too ""trendy alcoholic beverage"" for my tastes. I found the sweetness more obvious than in the Nocturnum and the alcohol not as well hidden. The effect seems even worse as the beer warms. But I'm nitpicking. It's a good beer."
"This ale was a clear, golden color with thin, wispy white foam. The smell was malty, with some hops, and a hint of fruit and sweetness. The taste was on the sweet side (malt) with a bit of floral hops and some fruit (apples and musty grapes). The mouthfeel was very good: smooth and creamy. The carbonation was medium. There was a good finish. The drinkability was good. This ale went down easy."
"Many say this is not an outstanding brew, and I believe that's because it's not a knock-out experience on all levels. Important to remember that this beer is supposed to be quiet and not with big flavors: it isnt a sweet and spicy dubbel or a high and complex trippel. DT should be judged as such for subtlety or appropriateness, as these are the standards for a strong golden ale. These beers are meant to be drunk like we do pilseners in the states."
"I love the presentation of the big white ceramic looking 750ml bottles, the blue foil tops, and the pink elephants and dancing alligators. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden color with a tremendous rocky and foamy white head that billows out of the glass and lasts almost forever and coats the sides of the glass as it slowly dissipates. Nose is fruity and spicy with notes of fresh citrus, sweet malts, and pepper. Very nice! Very smooth and creamy mouth feel with a fine carbonation. Taste is lightly fruity with notes of citrus, sweet honey, and spicy hops. Finish is crisp and lightly sweet. This is one of my all-time favorites. Simply delicious."
"A cloudy golden brew. A little darker than pure golden, but still within range of it. I hope I didn't get too much yeast in the pour, it was hard to judge since the bottle is opaque. On to the aroma, spicy pepper, a bit tart, and a bit sweet. Very yeasty as well, which I find quite pleasant actually. The flavor comes in as a wave of pepper spiciness with a big backbone of yeast-coated hops. Malt shows up as part of this as well in a slight bready character. As it swirls in your mouth, the pepper character (and slight alcohol presence) really make your tongue tingle, but the aforementioned backbone is still huge. Turns sweeter in the back and in the finish. Other spiciness is present here and there. A very tasty tripel, highly recommended! Mine actually stated an 8.5% abv on the bottle, not 9.0%. You may not come down with DT after a few of these, but you will be seeing the pink elephants!"
"F"
"Pours hazy light golden-orange color, yeasty, malty, spicy and alcohol aromas. Sweet fruity malty flavors, the hops stand out in the finish, medium-full body thick and syrupy on the tongue, another one that smells better than it taste, overall average."
"This was somthing I came across at BJ's Brewery and with all the good reviews I read and heard I just had to go for the trip. This one has a light golden color and foamy head (smiliar to Duvel). I had to let it rest for a couple of seconds fo it to settle a bit. The taste is to my buds a really good refreshing beer, resembled some fruitful notes and and a hint of sweet spice that combined for me quite well. At one point I did let it settle too long and it got warm, one of my friends tried it out of curiousity and told me ""Thats a good wine cooler"" Hmm.. Well all the flavor combination did a good job for masking the ABV, as TheLongBeachBum would say ""Good Stuff""."
"Despite the 9% ABV rushing to the fore, it's incredibly consumable, and urges another swallow, after the last. An ale, though very pilsner-like, but every bit Belgian, candy sugar is involved, and copious hops, and plenty of flavor."
"It took me a year to get this after I first saw it chosen as the ""greatest beer in the world"" by one author. I have since had many Belgian and Belgian styled beers, and this is my favorite style. Of all of the beers i've tried, this one would probably be the most ""dangerous", because it is very light, quite carbonated, and the flavor is fairly restrained (considering the high alcohol content). Spicy, fruity, and quite easy to drink. Not quite as flavorful or distinctive as my personal favorite, Duvel, but similar to a few other beers of the style (particularly Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde and Don De Dieu? - maybe this is the beer they modeled those after?)) I will certainly buy this again."
"Great bottle. Color was great- hazy straw yellow with a thick creamy head. You could tell this beer has been fermented with a good dose of yeast and is conditioned well. A very fruity and flowery aroma at first which then mellows into more a wine like smell. A very flavorful brew- peppery and spicey, this beer stands up strong and is far more potent than it looks. I tasted and felt the alcohol immediately. A warming beer even though it is pale. A nice rich texture, but a little thin toward the end of the glass. Overall a good Belgium strong ale that is to be enjoyed with others"
"Tremens pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a large frothy white head. The head leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is citrus and pears with notes of alcohol. The taste starts with a sharp bite of malt and moves quickly to flavors of apples, pears and coriander with hints of grains of paradice. The finish is full of alcohol with notes of hop spiciness and candi sugar. The aftertaste is of alcohol and grain. Overall a very rich and complex taste profile. The mouthfeel is pleasant but does have a slight syrupiness to it. A nice ale with many complex flavors for the Belgian ale lover. A little more balance between the syrupy mouthfeel and the alcohol along with a less cloudy pour would make this a perfect ale."
"Pours dirty blonde in color with a pillowy head that stands one finger high but remains. Darker viscous cloud falls gently to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell of grain and sweetness reminds me of a trippel. Taste reveals sweet candi sugar and grains with a warming alcohol presence and citrus. Packs a stealthy alcohol punch. I'm not clever enough to come up with any pink elephant jokes."
"434"
"This beer poured a hazy gold color and formed a bubbly white head. Some carbonation was present. It had an aroma of spice and citrus. A flavor of spice and grain with a touch of citrus. The finish was a touch tart and fizzy due no doubt to the carbonation level. This one reminds me a bit of Duvel and I found it to be quite enjoyable if not quite as good as Duvel."
"Hazy dark golden color, upcharging bubbles all around the glass. Glossy 1/2 inch head of crystal-like bubbles. Laces in bigger patterns. Sharp aroma, medicinal, slightly cheesy, slightly vinegary. Malty flavors are muted, some rum-raisin and with senses of cherry-like fruit. Jazzy mouthfeel. Distinct hop bittering, rinds of citrus in the close along with some butane-like alcoholic power. Ultimately, this beer is a little too carbonated and ""Duvel-like"" for me, lacking musty and deep malts. Certainly a respectable and fine brew -- and it does improve as it warms up a bit."
"A deceiving treat, as it will catch up on you if you don’t watch out, deceiving alcohols come through the back."
"  Would tell a freind!"
"Had this one on tap at Chalkies.  Very light gold in color... clear with a thin white head that leaves some lace.  Aroma is musty and yeasty, with sour apples, coriander, ginger, and alcohol.  Honey, apples, and ginger are noticeable in the flavor.  It starts slightly sweet, and becomes dry in the finish.  This is a quite complex beer and it's very strong.  The alcohol isn't very noticeable in the flavor, so it can really sneak up on you."
"pours out a hazy golden colour with proper fluffy head.  My nose is well stuffed at present, so my senses were dulled.  Smelled fine, tasted fine (I can't pick out exact flavours, but its a light, and a little fruity).  It's definitely good, but not quite Fin du Monde good."
"This Belian pours a very clear and very pale yellow with a massive white head.  The fruity esters with hints of banana gets the mouth watering.  The taste is consistant with the aromas repeating the fruitiness with a yeasty background and warming alcohol on the tail all wrapped up in a light bodied, crisp bubbly brew.  Did I mention it is very warming ;-).  Nice brew! Op uw gezonheid!"
"I let half of the bottle sit open in the fridge overnight and the next day it tasted better. Some of the overt sweetness and alcohol was subdued and many, complex, spicy, fruity pleasures emerged. Damn decent. Not a huge mental challange, but good. A PSA you can take home to your mother."
"Pours a nice hazy yellow with a good head at first and trails to a slim collar. Aroma of yeast and spices. My first taste was sweet, almost bubble gum like. Very nice, crisp, dry finish. Alcohol in the beginning, middle and end. I can see where the pink elephant's come from, surely you can't drink this all night. Still I liked it."
"The pour is a cloudy golden orange, the head is magnific, the lace resplendent upon the glass. Nose is malt, plummish, light hints of fusel alcohol. Front is sweet, the top is middling, the finish is bearably dry, modestly hopped, and benignly acidic. I see why many don't like it, as it is a bit scabrous, even ferine, but then I like the beers that ""Bite Back"" Ranks #492 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"It is definitely yeasty, and slightly bitter. I found it a touch heavy on the carbonated side, but generally a nice effort."
"This is a really tough review for me. I posted a Forum recently to check what Style these ""Belgium Blonds"" should be listed under. That sorted (Belgium-Style Pale Strong Ale), it was onto the tasting of one of my all time favourites. Now I have had this in Belgium many times, but this review is for a Bottle that I have here on my desk in US. Man - Weird !!!, its almost as though its not the same beer I remember, but that it is, in a strange Twilight-Zone sort of way. Bad beer, or bad memory??. I'm not sure. Onto the review, a highly carbonated pour, with a frothy head that soon dissappeared into thin lacy lines on the Glass and a scum almost. The spiciness was there - but not the hoppy character I (think I ?!) remember. A strange non-descript mouthfeel, but clean tasting. Orangey-Amber color and very clear - too clear. Again, I recall many DT's with a very slight haze in Belgium. Well I'm confused !!!?. But I have to be honest, I hate to admit this as a die-hard fan, and mark this one as a huge disappointment. At the risk of potential libel action no doubt - I really do wonder to myself if it is the same beer as sold in it's homeland. If it is - it does not travel well. Other than that a ""good"" beer nevetheless. But Man, for me, what a let down. I will try this again and hope its just a ""bad 'un"" as we say in England."
"I was in the mood for a nice Belgian strong ale, so I went to the cellar to pull out my bottle of DT. Now that I've finished the glass, I wonder if I left it in the cellar too long? Or not long enough? I don't know, but something about the beer seemed a bit off, unrefined... Anyway, it looks great, clear golden yellow with copious carbonation that ensures a fluffy white head and lacing that follows the brew down the glass. Sweet pear aromas, honey, apples; at this point I'm intrigued. The taste, however, is almost too sweet, slightly out of whack. Some nice spiciness cuts through somewhat, but I'm wanting a bit more tang. And there's something very strange in the way the beer feels in my mouth -- a thick, almost toothpaste-like aspect. Odd and a bit harsh. Oh well. Cool bottle though."
"Light copper color with a fluffy, sticky, persistent white head. Served in an authentic DT glass with the DT logo and psychedelic pink elephants.  Sweet aromas, with the hint of the high level of alcohol. Taste is primarily malty, but not overwhelmingly, with a raisin-y sweetness; alcohol is very evident. Pleasantly warming. A fine Belgian ale (although my feeling is that one is enough in a sitting)."
"It started out looking and smelling very good. Then it was all down hill after that. The taste was not that good. In fact it was to bitter on the after taste and what happen to the complex flavors? Never picked anything up. So far I've not be impressed with most of the Belgium Ale's I've tried."
"Pours a deep golden color, appears cloudy a bit, with good white belgian lace. On the nose it is super perfumy (don't like), tangy, fruity, zesty, and spicy. The same is on the palate spiciness, fruitiness, sweet maltiness. Overall a decent Belgian, sort of feels like your drinking perfume though..."
"A very tasty beer that packs a wallop.  Clear golden yellow in color, pours with a large white head.  Smells quite sweet, spicy, candyish.  Starts sweet, almost cloying.  Lots of sugar and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg) throughout.  Alcohol is fairly noticeable.  Medium light body.  One makes an excellent nightcap.  Two would make a good sleeping potion."
"An excellent beer.  It is very fragrant and floral.  Hints of fruit and spice abound in this one.  And these aromas are robust.  This is the equivalent of real Columbian coffee - very aromatic and flavorful.  The first sip is a bit harsh if you are not ready for it, it will jump up at you.  At the end, you may be tempted to have another, but be wary, the ABV will seek and destroy after more than two if these Belgian beauties.  Bottoms Up!"
"Well, I didnt like it. The alcohol hits very hard in the taste and smell, but there was also a sweetness which I didnt think fit. If you can stand this stuff, more power to ya. I wont be buying any of this in the near future."
"Unique ceramic off white bottle, with shiny blue foil. Characters on the label include pink elephants, green alligators, and purple dragons. My sweetie liked the bottle so she bought it. Hmmmm...Well it tastes great ! Pours golden orange/yellow, nice initial fluffy white head, settles quickly but leaves an interesting circle of foam. Lots of sweet floral and citrus smell, very smooooth. Nice sweet taste, not overly carbonated like others in the class (see orval) Very sweet finishes with lots of maltness, almost no hops or bitterness until seconds later. Very very easy to drink (guzzle) 8.5 %abv will sneak right by. Leaves you warm, and fuzzy wondering about those pink elephants on the label. Go ahead and buy it when you see it, you won't be dissapointed. I think it's better than the Golden Monkey in it's class."
"Impressively thick and very dense white head.  Hazy dark yellow hue.  The highly appetizing aroma is comprised of fruity pear and kiwi notes along w/ green apple acetaldehyde.  A fragrant floral rose petal note can be discerned as well, and mild phenol and heaty fusels round out the nose.  Fairly full bodied when compared to Duvel, w/ a lower carbonation and smoother feel. The rich, sweet, honey - like malt flavors are accompanied by black pepper notes, w/ just a hint of clove.  Finishes quite sweet, pleasantly musty and with mellow alcohol warmth.  This is a highly enjoyable brew.  Delirium Tremens has characteristics of strong golden ales and trippels and falls in between the two styles flavorwise."
"A nice beer, but tends to have that alcohol sweetness that you find in malt liquors, still nice and strong in its body and flavour, worth atry."
"Further update: Yes, overzealous indeed, but as a Belgian Strong Pale, the availability is a plus. There is some variability, but I like it quite a bit, still."
"A superb Belgian strong golden ale. Great nightcap."
"You know you've got a strong ale when it comes in a signature snifter style glass featuring pink elephants.  The alcohol kick was deceptively well blended in this golden elixer.  Definitely a sipper."
