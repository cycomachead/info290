"Apple juice color with beautiful white foam that subsides relatively fast. Some lacing. Carmel aroma at first. Very spicy taste, medium body with decent mouth feel. Cloves, banana. In my mind not up to par with other RR offerings but I would drink it for sure but unlikely to buy it."
"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 3.5, Flavor 3.5, Palate 4, Overall 3.5.  Slightly above average but not much.  Better Belgian ales exist with better price points."

""
""
""
"Very smooth. A nice balance of malt, yeast and hop flavors."

"I picked this up at my local grocery store (~600 miles from the Brewery)! I couldn't believe they had it. I almost passed out. Grabbed a bottle, rushed home to taste it and it is amazing. Great Belgian strong!"

"Pretty much seems like Duvel mini- almost as good, but not quite.  As much as I want to say Damnation is in the shadow, it is a good beer in its own right."
""
""
""
"Really really enjoyed this beer.. Another great beer from Russian river, bought it at alpine liqour.  Too bad I only bought one, will definitely get it again."

"Split bottle w/my sis in law, who's a big Belgian Pale fan.  One of the best American made I've had.  just the right amount of sweetness, Belgian yeast, lemon, biscuit.  great mouthfeel, carbonation"

"M: Absolutely fantastic, on this front, and it progresses wonderfully, with each stage feeling a little different.  Crisp, the flavors pop, then its creamy and smooth, then it ends a little dry, but not too much.  Good carbonation.  Fairly light bodied."

"The flavor follows with orange peel, a refreshing quality, despite its sweetness. Then onto clove, sweet apricot and peach. A clean drying quality in the back."

""

"O - This is extremely refreshing. I wish this came in a 6 or even a 12 pack. Sadly RR doesn't offer their beers this way. This one is really unique, the banana and citrus peel notes give it that classic Belgian taste. The dry finish from the pale ale style really gave this a refreshing finish that left me wanting more. Moreover, the star of this beer was the yeast; it flawlessly combined both of these great styles into one wonderful and unique beer. A must try for anyone that is a fan of the style."

"This one poured a nice dark golden with a minimal head, even though it seems plenty carbonated.  The smell is faint, but pleasant, with a light cirtus, peppery smell.  The taste is dry and spicy with a funky aftertaste and a dry effervescent mouthfeel.  It has a champagne feel to it.  What started as a merely satisfying drink turned into a very enjoyable one by the finish.  This is my first taste of something from Russian River and I must say that they live up to the hype on this one."
"O: Disappointing. But would be pretty good if the sourness didn't ruin it."

"Opened cold into a chilled Pilsner glass. Appearance is a cloudy golden haze... Great looking beer. Little to no head/lacing. Nose consists of chocolate, tobacco, lemon zest, with a healthy dose of ""wet dog"" funk up front. Mouthfeel is exceptionally dry, ropy and sticky with mild carbonation crispness. Taste is astringency balanced with malty sweetness and hints of vanilla, citrus fruit, tobacco and oak. A very nice emulation of a true Belgian, with RR's trademark funk in the mix."

"o: nice beer. I don't drink a lot in this style, but it's one of the better versions I've had in recent memory. This inexplicably sat in my cellar for a year (bottled 4/22/2013), and I am pleasantly surprised at how it has held up. Will get again next time I am within their distributors' range."

"Had this beer twice at Monks Cafe in Phila. Maybe it was the setting because Monks is one of the best bars you can ever find, but this beer is absolutely fantastic. Great banana esters, some spice, and rounded out with pleasant yeast character. Watch out it has a kick. If your a fan of Duvel, you'll love this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It poured a hazy, orangey yellow color with an uneven head. Smelled floral with a bit of pepper and banana. The taste was the best part. Banana, apple, clove, pear and a hint of alcohol. Very well rounded and medium bodied. Great example of a strong golden ale done well in America."

"O - Ages better than I expected for such a low alcohol beer. However, I think I liked it a little better fresh. This Russian River take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale is right there with Duvel and Ommegang. I have one more in the cellar to see if a longer wait brings anything different. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall I wasn't overly impressed with this beer but it fit the category quite well. I would take the peppery funkiness of a Saison over the peppery hoppiness of Damnation."

"So in-depth and yet so drinkable. Its amazing how RR can craft beers like this. Simply an awesome beer and would recommend to anyone, even non craft drinkers.The fruitiness is insane and enjoyable for anyone. RR has mastered the sour game and is kicking ass in the belgian ales as well. Would love to try this years release a few years from now and see how it develops"
"O: Beautifully spicy, fruity Belgian Ale really showcases the yeast. The bottle I got seemed a little bit overcarbonated. The body and taste improved the longer I left it in the glass. I'll definitely let the next one come up in temp a little more next time before I pop the cork."

"O- This is billed as Russian River's version of a Duvel on their website but it reminds me more of a higher gravity hefe-weizen, similar to Bell's Wheat Love that I had a few months ago. A nice milder Belgian yeast character in this beer that makes it a pretty easy drinker."

"12.68 oz for around $9. pours a hazy golden yellow. spicy grain on the aroma, lime earthy. really nice feel, coats the mouth, wet, grainy. big spice notes, citrus, cracker, lemon peel, big bitter finish, white grape as it warms. very nicely done beer but pricey and not available in NJ"

"Draught @ Monks: Mistake pour: ordered a Pliney the Elder and they mistakenly brought this. It was a good mistake. This one pours a fairly clear, golden color. There was some white head and some lacing. Good hop nose. Mainly pine and grapefruit. Some other lighter fruits and spices also. The taste is also good. It has a slightly lighter body than expected. A little bitter, somewhat dry finish. Malts, spices. Nice."

"Pours slightly cloudy, , rich gold in color with a thin bubbly head. Smells like fresh fruit, pears, citrus, golden raisins, with some mild grassy hoppiness. The typical Belgian yeast flavor is there but does not overpower the beer. The taste is slightly more spicy and earthy in flavor, slightly floral and a bit boozy. The mouthfeel is heavier than expected, full-bodied with a slightly dry finish. Overall, this is a tasty beer that is slightly less Belgian than expected. Drinkable and warming; glad I got the chance to have it."

"O: Awesome. Full flavor but smooth and mellow at the same time. The main thing I wanted out of this beer was just a little more sour on the finish. Just enough to finish off the full rich flavor a little cleaner. Despite that, still an amazingly well developed flavor profile."
""
""
"Overall not as enjoyable as many of Russian Rivers other beers, but solid none the less. Great buy for $4"

"O: Complex, unique, and a damn good beer. I'm looking forward to reviewing more beers in the same style to see how it compares to others. It's been a while since I've had Duvel, Delirium Tremens (lulz), etc. but as far as I can tell this one puts up some good competition and has its own unique characteristics that make it stand out. It's also nice that it's one of the cheaper RR offerings, and I really appreciate it when brewers use these awesome 375 ml corked bottles, so bonus points for that."
""
"O- very solid, a lot of the cedar flavor, pretty complex mixture of fruit, hops, grain, and spices. Not what I expected from a belgian golden ale, but better."

"The craftsmanship is what really sells this beer and takes it to the next level. Great stuff."

"Overall, it's very deserving of its reputation. 4.5"
""
"Bottled poured into snifter glass. Pours a hazy lemony color with nice white head, quickly dissipated. Smells of Belgian yeast, fruit, pepper, spicy hops. Taste is wonderful. Lots of fruit, pear, apple, classic Belgian yeast taste, spice notes, and pepper. Mouthfeel was medium, nice creamy texture and the carbonation was decent. Overall, this is a great representation of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style by an American brewery, very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer. I like it more than Duvel and a little less than Delerium Tremens. Its definitely better as it warms. The flavors really begin to move and mix together wonderfully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden straw color with a small white head. Smell is citrusy, pear and pineapple. Taste has a touch of sweetness and tartness with some the citrus flavors, a little dry. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry finish similar to champagne but has a nice mouth feel, not thin like some dry beers."
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours slightly cloudy yellow with a fluffy white one finger head. Straw and yeast funk aroma. Flavor of straw, yeast, but of spice, and some hints of sweet pear or honey. Strange dry finish. Light bodied and easy drinking with prickly carbonation. I really wasn't a huge fan of this. There was something that seemed off in the flavor, and perhaps I'll have to try again some other time as maybe I got a bad bottle."
""
"O- This is a good beer. It's got great characteristics, but as far as Russian River goes for me so far, nothing has stuck out much. The big rare brews they have aren't common in my area, so maybe that's why I'm missing the hype of RR."

"You would think that with a name like damnation it would be roiling. Shouting from the depths or something with all kinds of strong flavors clamoring. It is the exact opposite of that. It's depth is in the grain and how that sweetens fully and naturally and without any sugary quality showing that the earth is deep and golden in it's nature. Drinks easily and it's only flaw is that there isn't more fruit sweetness in the finish. But, even that fits the concept of damnation as it leaves a bit of longing. Easy and refreshing. Nothing heavy about this one it has a silky texture and excellent balance. It sparkles with depth and complexity rather than with carbonation and has a softness on the palate that is tangible. All of the qualities are only lightly forward making this one a very demure drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Phenomenal experience. I would possibly put this American take on the Belgian style at the top spot for American offerings. I definitely have to respect the care and attention that this delicate recipe has received. Looking forward to a few more months of bottle-aging the others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My second time having Damnation, and I liked it much more the first time, when I had it on-tap at the brewery. Maybe I should have aged this a little bit longer, or let it sit out a bit to let it warm and let some of the carbon dioxide off to taste some of the more subtle flavors. Nonetheless, it is another good Belgian-style from RRBC. Worth obtaining a bottle and cellaring it for a bit."
"Pours a murky gold with thick, fluffy, lasting white head and lacing that protrudes from the side of the glass. Nose of sweet hay, honey, wheat and some light floral hops. Medium mouthfeel with some lemon notes, with wheat, honey, yeast. Really smooth drinking golden ale."
""
"Overall: The best American version of a Belgian pale ale I have tasted, on par with Duvel, hell maybe a slight bit better. If this were readily available locally I would always have some on hand."

"O: A gift on a trade and this was a winner! The phenolics are kept in check by the hop bitterness and flavor and its got a nice dry finish making it very drinkable and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright golden color into a tulip glass. Has a citrus aroma with floral undertones, you can smell a little lemon zest and yeast. Taste is very lite and crisp, like a saison, summer beer, or a cider rather than a strong pale ale. You can barely notice any of the alcohol in it, and the rich flavor completely mask what ever alcoholic taste there is. It makes for a very enjoyable, drinkable beer."

"Overall, the best Belgian Pale I've had to date. Granted there aren't many in my arsenal, but it's a style I normally avoid. Drinking something like this on a daily basis could change my mind. Personally, it's another win from my favorite brewery."
"O - Incredibly tasty, complex brew. Amazing light color, beautiful appearance, lots and lots of complex flavors make peace together and sing cumbaya on my palate."
""
""
""
"Pored this beer into a glass. It has a very pale golden color with good steady streams of carbonation. Nice white head. The aroma is very spicy, and has an alcoholic fruity smell, like a cider, and a very slight but pleasant hop aroma that comes through right at the end. Really amazing aroma on this beer. I would say it's the high point of this brew but honestly it's great all around. Moving on to taste. The spice comes across on the palate quite strong at first but gives way to earthy malty notes almost reminiscent of straw. A very pleasant, fruity aftertaste ends the experience. This beer has a really nice, crisp, and dry mouthfeel. Overall this is a really tasty double pale ale. Lots of interesting stuff going on in this beer. By all means worth giving a try if you stumble upon it and this seems to be the easiest Russian River brew to track down."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The first of the ""non-sour"" ales that I've tried from Russian River's line of Belgian style beers, and I'm mildly impressed. There are certainly some better, authentic Belgian pales out there... Then again, I'd also choose Damnation over many other authentic Belgian pales, too. One of the best things about the brew is the somewhat low price point... 4-5$ a bottle isn't bad for this tasty brew."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent BSPA, one that approaches the majesty of Duvel, but the smell/taste aren't quite as intoxicating to my senses. Given Duvel's relative ease of access, and Damnation's relative difficulty (for me), I can't say I will likely try this one again soon, unfortunately."

"O - Good, not great. Feel like its a little uninspired. Was very excited and a tad let down. RR is great, however - they really have set their own bar high."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - I think this bottle if from 2011 and perhaps it is a bit past its prime. Still a nice tasting beer, but I will have to track down a fresh one. It doesn't taste as refreshing/vibrant as I was expecting."

"My issue with Belgian Strong Pale Ales is that I'm always comparing them to the generally infallible Duvel. This is a solid offering from Russian River. However, given how epic the ""average"" Russian River beer is, Damnation doesn't really stand out."

"O - Very enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale. True to style and is complex. This one gets looked over because it is so easy to find and made in abundance. Still a great beer to drink on a hot day or relax with and contemplate."
"Another great from Russian river- these bottle conditioned beers never cease to impress. Super complex and flavorful."
"O: Yet another very solid offering from Russian River. Very smooth and creamy, with a pleasant but subtlety flavored brew. Extremely easy to drink for 7.7%. Certainly worth giving a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale from Russian River and one of the benchmarks for American brewers who are trying to replicate this style. The balance is on point and while the complexity isn't stunning, this beer hits the mark, a classic American take on a traditional Belgian style."

"O: I really enjoyed this as a session beer. Patience with each sip was helpful for me and rounded out the experience. The more I reflect as I'm drinking it, patience is perfect for this beer, keeping the carbonation from making you feel full."

"For the price (under $4) and ready availability, this is a very tasty and authentic yet slightly experimental take on BSPAs around here. Honestly, I haven't found a better deal, and when I need a quick fix on the style I go for this one. The alcohol burning sensation removes a bit of the mellowness that I enjoy in these beers, but luckily the flavor is very tasty and juicy as they should be. Recommended a try to fans of RR."

"Poured a pale gold with good looking head on top an of aroma that has typical light Belgian charateristics such as touches of funk, some spices and yeast as well as touches of tropical fruit or at least apples and pears and there is a candi-sugar type sweetness underneath it all. Light-bodied, easy to drink, goes down realy easy and enjoyable and finishes with crisp hop bite that isn't cutting or bitter but a good balance of hops and sweetness so you keep wanting more. Overall, the beer is well-balanced and while drinking it I was not only getting some hoppiness but fruit notes from orangey, citric (banana), to spicy clove as well as some sweet fruits and a little bit of sweet malt. Great beer and did not realize how high in alcohol because it does not bleed into the beer at all and this is a must for any beer ""snob""."
"Overall: Anyway, I enjoyed this offering quite a bit more than the Redemption, which I had later that night. It's a pretty sessionable Belgian pale ale that doesn't come across as too rich or strong, but remains incredibly tasty and thirst-quenching without filling you up too quickly. (4)"
"Russian River puts out so many great beers, this seems to me like a session beer there trying to make and it just lacks a lot."

"Poured from the bottle, the ale was a golden color with a generous white head. It left lacing around the sides of the glass in a manner appropriate for the style. In the aroma, one detects an almost grape-like wine aroma. In the mold of wine, it projected notes of a dry wine. In the initial taste, one detects notes of grape, grape skin, wheat, dry biscuit, yeast, and banana. The ale was smooth, yet pleasantly bubbly. When the fruits of the initial tastes evaporate, a dry aftertaste becomes apparent. In my overall impression, this is a complex beer with several tastes occurring at once. Though this is not the most respected Russian River, it holds up nicely against other beers."

"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a huge creamy white head. Lacing abound as the beer travels down the glass. Aromas of tart apple and some grass. Taste begins with some tart apple, then some light grain, finishing with an acidic, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a very good beer."

"Pours the color of lemonade with a dash of bourbon. Head disappears quickly with moderate lacing. Smell is yeasty, grassy. The flavor is malty and earthy. The sweetness is there too but only enough to mask the alcohol which is difficult to detect. Very high carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Overall a very nice beer. Not my favorite style though."

"I just returned from a day, April 2013, at the Russian River Pub where I was delighted to experience a fresh Damnation draft. Forger everything I said before, the fresh draft is nothing short of wonderful and a real flavor experience. So I bought a case of mixed bottles including Damnation (of course a few Pliny Elder to share with friends), but the fresh bottled Damnation is splendid. My regret, why didn't I buy 2 cases?"
""
""
"O: I tend to like big bold and complex flavors so at first I wasn't sure I was going to like this, but I really enjoyed it. Vinnie makes amazing beers, and ones that I enjoy quite a bit more than this one, but I think this beer was executed flawlessly. If anything at all it could have had a larger head."

"Met expectations, a very well crafted Belgian, refreshing and balanced with crisp light spices and earthy yeast."
"O- Very nice belgian style ale with a wonderful champagne like mouthfeel, very balanced flavor profile with some nice brett character. This most reminded me of Green Flash's Rayon Vert, other than that I really haven't had another beer with this flavor profile."

"Russian River ales are always fun and special because they are bottled and presented well initially. The ale itself poured with a thin fizzy head that dissappated in mere moments. The color was of an apple cider like tint, cloudy and yellow but almost reddish in a way. The aroma is of apple and cloves but the taste follows on the apple. The taste is more complex than just apple as three distinct stages were present. It felt as the first taste disappeared quickly, a new taste emerged at the swallow and the aftertaste linger softly for some time. I simply could not describe each taste and it seemed I wanted more. My only complaint would be the feel was quite carbonated and bubbly, almost thin. Overall this was an experience and a good one at that."

"O: This is pretty good - not up there with beers like La Chouffe, but good."

"Pours a hazy golden apricot with a solid quilt of fine light cream foam. Smells of belgian yeast, grain, bread, hints of tangerine, some clay and a bit of sweetness. Flavor has a clean belgian golden flavor with plenty grain, fruity grapy esters, some banana, a bit of funk and some peach. Body is heavier than I'd prefer with a decent sharp and yet soft carb with an overall creamy feel. Nice beer."
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid beer, I would definitely recommend it. Its very drinkable and the the ABV is well hidden which could be dangerous on a summer day. Enjoy this beer if you can find it. Cheers."

"Overall, very good. Very similar to Duvel, which is a good thing in my books. Very tasty!"

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch 076. Pours hazy pale golden color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to an nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pear, grape, apple, lemon, herbal, grass, honey, pepper, wheat, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, pepper, herbal, grass, honey, wheat, bread, light earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, herbal, pepper, wheat, grass, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Excellent flavor balance of spiciness/fruitiness, with nice complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong pale ale. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff."

"O-It is a pretty beer with a pleasing smell, but I felt a little let down by the taste. It came off a little too tepid for me."
""
""
"I mean, its not a true Belgian beer, obviously, but it hangs with the North American elites of Belgian styles such as Ommegang and Unibroue. From Russian River, I expect no less, though frankly it still surprises me how good all of their beers are."
""
"O: This is a very interesting beer that has a complex taste. It’s a lot easier to drink compared to some of the other beers in the style, especially since there are no traces of alcohol in the taste."
"Thanks to my awesome wife for toting this one home from California on a business trip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good effort but all things being equal, I'd rather have a Duvel."
""
"overall, it leaves a nice twang on the outsides of the tongue, is exactly what it tries to be, and is an excellent offering if strong, light belgian ales are what you crave. it just doesnt have that belgian signature and tastes so much like the unibroue ales... but very decent in its own right. and from california...."
"O: Just kind of ""meh"" for me, to be honest. I expect more from Russian River. Just a fair BSPA for me. Lots of better options from RR. Underwhelming nose and flavor profile."
"This is just...awesome. Perfectly balanced and excellent. It's been a while since I added a beer to my top five, but this one did it."
"O - I think its just the freshness of this beer. I was getting more vegetal and hard spice notes than anything. Hopefully I can try an aged one at some point."
""
""
"O- I'd definitely have to say this is the best Belgian Pale Ale I think I've had. Everything in it was very well done from the appearance down to the mouthfeel. There were very nice well balanced flavors that provided for a very easy to drink and enjoyable beer. Not only that but beer felt very good on the palate and looked very good in the glass. I definitely enjoyed this beer, another great offering that I would highly recommend."

"Pours a crisp golden with a small bit of head. Great belgian meets german hefe aroma of banana and clove. Taste is superb belgian pale, slight hop and spice with a smooooth and refreshing finish. Such a great brew and shouldn't be passed up."
""
"Clear golden colored brew with some foam and a wonderfully big aroma. Light, floral, and estery notes on the nose. Floral and estery flavor, with some sweetness as it warms. Deceptively strong, although it masks the alcohol well. Dry finish wins out. This is a classic."

"O: This beer didn't impress me that much. It isn't bad...it isn't great. An good Belgian Strong Pale."

"Overall: The smell is really about a 4.25 so I rounded up. I love just how ""Belgian"" this one is. I always have high expectations from Russian River and they are always met. This is usually a bad thing to have but I am not disappointed with this one."

"This beer pours out a hazy golden color with a fairly modest head (I did a slow pour due to the bottle fermentation, and could have easily been aggressive). The aroma is spicy with pepper, along with a large amount of fruity flavors. The taste is very good, it's a well composed Belgian ale. It's got the whole bananas, pepper, and yeast thing you'll expect, paired with crisp apple and pear, along with some raisins. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is fine. Overall, it's a good Belgian Strong ale. The style still doesn't thrill me, but this is about as fine an example as I'm liable to taste."

"O- I've been Damned! This one is good. A must try American version of a very tasty Belgian beer style. Wish I had more than one bottle. It's sad that Russian River beers are so limited in their distribution. They make wonderful beer."
"My first Russian River Belgian and consider me impressed. Can't wait to open the RR sours I have stashed in the cellar from this same trade. If drinking this is what eternal damnation to hell holds, I'd be more than willing to go for the ride. Cheers!"
"Pours a foggy yellow color speckled with sentiment that stays floating in place in the glass. Two finger head topping he brew that got smaller only after sipping. Smells of apple juice with slight banana and raisin with slight yeast. Taste has more yeast than he smell and the taste of the fruit isnt as pronounced as the smell. I expected lots from the aroma of the beer. It is a good beer and I'd like to try aging this for a second chance"

"O. Classic us Belgian strong ale. A nice fall time brew."

"Medium to slightly light bodied; good carbonation that's quite crisp and makes this a clean drinker when combined with the overall dryness. Booze is well hidden until you feel it upon finishing the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft wheat malt and grainy notes up front. Becomes sweeter, with honey and tropical fruit fighting it out mid-palate. Herbal, peppery, light hop bitterness into the yeasty, dry finish. Medium-full body with a nice, bottle-conditioned feel. Very nice."
""
"Overall - Well, damn! If they served beer like this in hell, it'd be a piece of heaven. Great balance, especially for a Belgian. One of these days, I have to make it out to the Russian River brewery."

"Average, at best. Drinking a bottle of RR Damnation batch 74 as I write this review. This beer is ok, having a nice yellow, straw/hay appearance--thin one finger head quickly fades. Flavors of grass and hops are muted behind a smooth almost watery taste. A very, very average beer for something that comes from Russian River. Not a complete let-down, but nowhere near outstanding. Mouthfeel is ok, sudzy, not bad. Overall, a little bit disappointed..."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace forms down the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, spices, yeast, and citrus aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, citrus zest, and some spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite tasty and super easy to drink."
""
"(originally reviewed: 05-27-2011)"
"Great match to style...if you don't know what to expect from a strong Belgian and just order this because of the cool name and t-shirt, it may be too much (like my favorite at the brewery--Pliny the Elder). Not the type of beer I could have several glasses of in a sitting, but a treat nonetheless."

"O - This is my first introduction to the Russian River beers, and I was very impressed. Looks, smells, tastes, and feels great. Alcohol is hidden extremely well and only shows up in a pleasant warming sensation - the best way for alcohol to show up. A terrific example of a Belgian strong golden ale. If Russian River’s other brews are anything like this, I need to get more of these beers."
"Had a friend traveling near the brewery and she picked me up a few bottles. The beer was relatively new- even though the bottle is corked and made to age. I was a little suprised by the level of carbination. I thought the beer had a nice aroma with floral and lighter fruit undertones. I could even pick out the banana flavors. It was an easy beer to drink and despite the 7.75ABV I could have drank the beer all day-a strong offering from Russian River."
""
""
""
""
"Good balance in this beer, showing off really nice fruity and spicy Belgian flavors in a style that isn't overly hoppy. Definitely a nice earthiness to it that I don't find in a lot of Belgian style beers. Very enjoyable, definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is also super yeasty. It has a sharp phenolic character and some vegetal flavors at first sip. But then it mellows out. It is spicy with a decent malt baking that adds some basic honey/sugar flavors. It is fruity like the smell, mostly banana and citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A real good Belgian strong pale ale, often not my favorite style but this one is pleasant and tasty if not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: The website says that Damnation was inspired by Duvel. I have to say, it beats the crap out of Duvel and is much more rich, complex and full bodied. That said, it just isn’t my style, so I am sure I am not appreciating it as much as some others will. A well done example of the style, but I’ll take Pliny or Blind Pig any day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with fairly high, prickly carbonation. Perhaps the only point where this beer actually stumbles a bit, but the resulting mouthfeel is still alright, particularly after a bit of time elapses an the carbonation decreases."
""
""
""
""
"I liked Damnation a lot. Nice and crisp, the sweet aftertaste really had me coming back for more pretty fast. Thanks stupac2."
""
"O – Complex brew all around with many tastes rolling through the palate. Nice easy drinker that warms you up but does not overpower. Very nice indeed."
"had this at the brewpub. Pours a slightly dark, golden colour. You can taste the Belgian characteristics in this one. Grainy and slightly hoppy. Drinks down very smooth and the alcohol is well masked. I'd like a chance to have this before I had their sours and ipas first. Safe to say my palate was effected."
""
""
"Overall: Easily the best Golden Ale I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Does Russian River ever fall short of great?? Cheers to this one!"

"O: Of the three beers I had tonight on tap at the brewpub this was my least favorite, but was still well made and enjoyable to drink"
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours a honey color into my Chimay glass. It's perfectly clear- seems 100% free of any particles. Initially there is a small soapy looking head which disappears. There is virtually no carbonation in my glass. Aroma: Citrusy, astringent, grainy, spicy, with hints of banana as well. The taste is very nice - I'm picking up a fruity pear taste that's dominant, yet something I did not detect in the aroma. It's got yeasty/spicy elements to the taste as well with a clean, semi-dry finish. Medium bodied and decent coating of the palate going on. Although it warms on the way down the alcohol presence goes very much unnoticed. Overall, I am a bit disappointed, as this is Russian River we're talking about. Maybe I will try this again on the chance that the cork loosened and let some air in before purchase. This was very expensive though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good example of the style, but it's just not one I get that excited about."
"Overall this is a well balanced brew. I am not a big fan of Belgian beers but I would have this one again. I believe the strong fruit and low hop presence makes this a good beer for a hot day. I would drink it again."

"I have to compare this beer to Duvel (as any reasonable person would). Rather than attempt to emulate the famous Belgian beer, RR seems to have gone their own way with this style (successfully). It lacks the crisp, stony dryness of Duvel, but makes up for it with a delightful hint of fruity sweetness. It's an excellent beer and fans of Duvel should give it a try. Just don't expect a clone."

"Overall, one of the better examples of the style. Pretty nice."

""
"Overall this might not quite be a Duvel but it's a pretty solid BSPA."
"this is a perfect relaxing beer and i can honestly see drinking this regularly if it were available here. a nice abv for a very light tasting and feeling beer."
"Hazy deep gold with some yeasties in it. Minimal head retention and low carbonation from the looks of it. Aroma is slightly sour, earthy, sweet, estery, a bit of cloves and vanilla. Taste is full and sweet, but cut by a slightly tart edge with lots of yeast esters. Fairly full body with a creamy finish. I almost wonder whether this batch didn't carbonate fully/properly. It's a tasty beer but seems like higher carbonation would do good things for it. Overall, still very good and worth trying."

"Review from 4/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber. Small white head with light lacing. Sweet malt and light fruit aroma. Mild malt, light fruit, light citrus and moderate Belgian spicing. Not that complex. Nice medium body and obviously well made, but I prefer a bit more malt and other flavors. Finish was dry and a bit astringent; this increased as the ale warmed. Pleasant, but not really in the league of other Belgian strong ale and the finish is lacking."

"The medium body really allows the flavors to strike the palate but never becomes coating or sticky. The carbonation fizzes only slightly and makes a nice, crisp swallow."

"O - Solid offering and easily drinkable. I don't think it stands head and shoulders above other brews, but I gladly pick it up on a semi-regular basis."
"Batch #072.Poured into a tulip glass a hazy lemon yellow with a large blooming white head that settled slowly into a frothy mass,aromas of pithy lemon hops,alcohol,and light yeasty spice.Flavors are citric and somewhat medicinal hop flavors up front on the palate,light yeasty phenols actuall mix well with the hop profile wich makes for a well rounded palate.A great beer for the style wich I expected from RR,somewhat refreshing even with a higher ABV."

"O- The appearance is so nice, but everything else is lacking from true greatness."
"This beer was so light and tasty that I could drink it all day."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad brew at all. Picked this up during a recent trip to CA and I'm glad I did."
""
""
"O - Damnation is one of the best ""Strong Pale Ales"" I've had. It's extremely well done and complex without being overwhelming. It may not blow you away at first, but as you drink it, you realize that this is beer made at the pinnacle of one's craft. Highly, highly recommended."
""
"This is a helluva good beer. About as close to a real Belgian as I've head. Wish I had more than one."
""
"Overall - if you enjoy the Begian Golden Ale style, you should enjoy this offering from Russian River. I don't think I have ever tasted anything below average from this brewery!"

"I have a few more around and look forward to drinking them."

"O: solid, drinkable, though not up to par with some of RR's other beers. This isn't quite my style, but I like it."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a nice thumbs width head. A mild but smooth aroma of some yeast, pepper, maybe a little floral and fruity. Flavor is pretty subdued as well. A little bready, some pepper, some fruit and a hint of hops. You kind of have to look for the flavor, it definitely doesn't jump out at you. It works, though, because its nice and balanced. Light to medium body, some carbonation, a nice feel to this. Overall, pretty good beer that I would like to give another round or two as I think there is more to discover with this one."
""

""
"O: A delicious beer but not overly complex but a damn good brew. Not sure how the aging had on it but was still quite tastey. Recomend for beginning belgian drinkers. "
""
""
""

""
""
"O - Wow, I love this beer, It is wonderfully made and thoroughly enjoyable. I would recommend this beer to anyone who has the chance."
""
"O - A solid beer, but not my favorite style. I like the funky fruity belgian yeast. Could use a little more heft in the malt department for my taste. But would be glad to have this one again."
"O - I have always liked Damnation, although I enjoy it more on-tap than in the bottle. The flavors are good and it is pretty easy to drink. Not my favorite RR beer but still a solid offering."

"To make a possibly stupid analogy, this isn't the artist whose work steals the show and towers above everyone, but rather the kind of thing you'd expect from any artist in a well-established, healthy, active culture of artists. It's a genre work that makes me think about what it would be like if all the people creating generic work were brilliantly talented. Hopefully this makes at least a little sense."

"EDIT (21 June 2012): Batch 068 poured from a 375mL bottle into a Koningshoeven chalice. Even less remarkable than previous incarnations. If you want something like this, go with the superlative Redemption."
"O: I was expecting more from this beer but not at all a bad beer. Probably will not have again but definitly worth a try."
"O: A very solid strong pale ale. The ABV was non existent and the combination of flavors was solid. Special? No. Good? Yes."
""
"Definitely enjoyed this one. Poured a hazy burnt orange color. Not transparent. Murky looking. Lots of Belgian yeast on the nose, some slight biscuit and floral scents mixed in. Taste starts sweet and malty, ends with a bit of a mild hoppy bite. The alcohol is present, but not in an overwhelming way. The carbonation is really good, and the mouthfeel is full but goes down fairly smooth. Has a very slight smoky feel to it. Overall I feel like the taste and mouthfeel are pretty complex on this beer. Quite enjoyable, wouldn't hesitate to drink another one. The price is a bit steep, but no other complaints. Have had this on tap and found it enjoyable, but I may have preferred it conditioned in the bottle a little bit more."
"Again Russian River doesn’t wow me but this is a solid offering by them. I’d rather just pay a little more and pick up a stubby bottle of Duvel. Worthy of a try if digging into strong Belgian pales though. A textbook example of the style."

"O: Overall, I consider this one a miss. Maybe I just had a bad batch, but my assumption is this beer is so highly rated because it’s a Russian River product. Now don’t get me wrong, RR makes some fantastic brews. However, this is not one of them. It’s not in the same league as Duvel, hell its not even playing the same game (and Delerium Tremens remains my favorite in the style). Cannot recommend, and won’t buy again."

"O- This beer is my go to beer of it's style. I like Belgium beers but some are too intense for my pallet and are often only sold in larger bottles. This beer is always available at my work and I enjoy it's drinkability."

"O- This is a good beer from a great brewery, but i paid way too much"
"Thin, quickly vanishing head. Doesn't have the most appealing appearance to me; like another review said - looks like piss. Fruity (apricot) aroma, with dirty funk. Smells belgian, tastes belgian. Not my favorite style, but an easy drink and has a nice fruity, spicy taste. Is that clove in there? I'm not the best at picking out spices... I'll have this again (I bought two bottles), but won't seek it out again. Had Redemption after this and actually preferred it more."
""
"I brought this to a beer tasting and poured it around. Golden in Color as some website have it listed ads a Stong GOlden Ale. BA has it listed as a Belgian Stong Pale ale. Yep, it was stong rolling in at above 7%. Not bitter at all. Not really like any beer I've tasted. Very flavorful with floral undertones and sweet. I love Belgians so I loved this one, but it was uncharacteristic of anything else I've tasted."

"O-a very great example of a belgian style brewed in america, however it is still clearly brewed in america and not belgium. its missing a certain raw aspect that the belgian ales have. it also doesn't seem to hold up to well. the carbonation really bothered me with this one also."

"Pours a cloudy straw golden color with a dense white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is heavy on Belgian yeast, spice, pepper, and mild fruit sweetness. Sweet and malty up front with spicy Belgian yeast throughout the palate. Mildly hoppy in the finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation and a dry finish. A nice, if mildly boring, golden Belgian."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, smooth and moderately carbonated. This is my favorite Russian River brew. Great for any session!"
""
""
""
"Despite being less known than other Russian River beers, this is one of the few that is constantly easy to find in Denver. I drank this out of my New Belgium tulip glass, and while not exactly an ideal beer, still proves that Russian River can brew just about anything damn well. I would love to find this on tap in Denver, but bottle will do for now!"

"Russian River Damnation is a very clear, golden beer with a creamy, white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It smells like banana bread and clove. It has a smooth, medium body and a dry finish. It tastes like cloves and must, almost like gewerztraminer. It's sweet and fruity toward the end with a note of pear. The aftertaste is musty and phenolic. This is a solid and well done beer. It's very spicy."

"Enjoyable beer, highly drinkable. With a few exceptions, there are not many BSPAs that I have the urge to drink often. If this were readily available to me, I would certainly purchase it a few times a year."
""
""
""

"O: Perfect score from me. This beer is not letting me down even in the slightest. If this is what Californians are treated with daily I'm jealous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is an excellent example of a domestic Belgian-styled SPA, and to my palate within spitting distance of the genuine article. Given it blind, I might have even mistaken it as having come directly from Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very much a Belgian-style ale. Very strong alcohol taste and wheat. Well carbonated. This beer encroaches on being too over the top with wheat and strength, but doesn't go over the line. Very well done. I can see how it could go wrong if the bottle is not kept in optimal conditions, but when at its best this is a fine offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this without reading bottle and thought it was same style, BPA (Abbey style ""single""), as Redemption, but this ain't a BPA, comes on like a tripel for sure. As a BPA it's way out of style in many ways, as a Tripel it isn't nearly as good as many others easily available. As a BSPA it is really good, but not great."
""
""
"Nice light copper color with a fairly minor head and distinctive Belgian aroma. Very nice carbonation with a decent (but never enough) hop profile. Big beers are not the best choice when you have to return to work though!"

"Yum! I let this bottle warm a bit first out of the fridge. Poured with a medium sized, foamy, frothy, off-white head that slowly settled and some lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber with loads of medium size bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, caramel, malt, hop. Flavor is much like nose, but amplified, vineous; great interplay between bitter, sweet, and carbonic tang. Body and carbonaton are just perfect. Very well balanced in all regrards. Finish tends towards more bitter than sweet and leaves me wishing for another sip. Masterful beer."

"A decent enough ode to the Belgian style. It's just with all the hype, I'd rather have a 6 dollar bomber of Unibroue, vs. a 6 dollar bottle of this (which entails a long trip across the border at that). Situational, ya know?"
"first russian river brew, batch number 65 poured a uniformly hazy golden wheat color with a large but delicate white head into a wine glass. classy packaging and mercurial carbonation makes this beer look exquisite. the nose is telling me its a nice belgian, but not much more than that. the taste is sharp and white wine like, with a gentle display of hops. a slightly floral and patient finish tops it off and a little sweetness, probably from the bottling sugars left over. the mouthfeel here is divine, bubbly and yeasty and fuller bodied than the style usually delivers. this is a damn fine glass of ale, and i look forward to my next russian river brew!"
"O -- I think this is up with Duvel as my favorite Belgian pale ales. I think Damnation has more juicy citrus than Duvel, but both are excellent."
"O - Wonderful - lively and light, tastes great."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light mouthfeel. Again, the carbonation seems low. Not bad though. Overall, wasn't a huge fan of this. May have been an off bottle."
"O- A good Belgian strong. The yeast character is good but a bit one dimensional. A little more complexity would have been nice. On a positive note, the 7.75% ABV is very well hidden."
"O: Excellent brew. Very tasty and great depth."
"O - Just a real nice, refreshing and well-balanced beer with a good mouthfeel. Nothing that knocks you over-the-head but everything is so nicely proportioned. I liked it better here on-tap than when I had it in the bottle."
"The is very well balanced, mellow and smooth with a nice spiciness as you'd expect from the nose. Overall its way better than the bottles ice had."
"This is very easy drinking, and enjoyable. Not my favorite in the style, but not bad."
"O: Great BSPA. I don't like many of them but this one is quickly among my favorites."
"O: For style I don't love, this is a very nice beer. Very subtle flavors and extremely easy drinking."
"Batch 66, poured into a Maudite goblet. This beer is a bright golden color with white head that oh so slowly settles. The aroma is not overly strong but getting some peach, pear and a light banana along with just a touch of hops as it warms. The taste is somewhat simple but in a good way. You get the belgian yeast gum like flavor then some sweet fruits and some hop bitterness at the end. It has a light, dry finish that pretty much begs you to take another sip. The alc. is very hidden. This was very enjoyable but not something I would go out of my way for."
"Pours a yellow/golden color. I'd hate to say this, but it reminds me of Budweiser or PBR. No points knocked for this though. Has a half-inch of white head, no retention, and no lacing. This smells of belgian yeast, spices, and the ocean. For some reason, Belgian ales always remind me of the ocean. The taste is spicy up front and out back, leaves a tingling sensation in the throat. Mouthfeel is really good on this one, pretty effervescent. Overall I would say this is a pretty decent representation of this style, nothing overly special. I would drink it again, for sure."
"Overall - I have yet to be disappointed by RR. This is no exception, but it's below their usual standards. I can't find any reason to say any category is less than ""good," but I can't find a reason to say it's any better than ""good."""
"Really enjoyed this, simple and delicate, but solid all around."
"Wow. Knocked me off my feet. Very sweet with a carbonates mouthfeel. Sweet spices little clovey aftertaste. Not astringent in the least. Cannot belive this is damn near 8%. This slightly edges pranqster as the best american made bspa. Good job russian river"
"O: Belgian all the way – the best American attempt at this style I’ve ever had. Leave it to the farthest possible brewer to make the best Belgians…such is the beer world, though. I’m just glad I got to try this truly great beer."
"This is a sweet, yeasty treat. It's complex, but not annoyingly so. I'm a big fan of this Belgian yeast, unlike Unibroque's, so I'm inclined to think I'll like all RR's Belgians when I taste them. I'm not normally a big BSPA fan, but this is done very well and I would drink it when given the chance. Probably the best Belgian I've had so far that's made strictly in the states."
"O - Glad I tried it, Belgian style isn't really my cup of tea, that said, this was pretty tasty."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, dry and tingly on the tongue. Pretty drinkable, alcohol is masked well, nice balance with the fruit. No surprise, another fantastic beer from RR."
"O: A thick and drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ale that gives representatives from the old country a run for their money."
"A really great beer, it's hard to rate this as just ""any other beer", there's a sour funk that's expected from Russian River that just doesn't come through on this. Almost like Sanctification's little brother, maybe with time more funk would come through. Tastes really good when you burp for sure..."
"O: Good for the style, yet it doesn't stand out enough. Still very satisfactory. Defiantly worth a try."
"O: this is a nice, well balanced BSPA. Lots of flavor and nice representation of the style."
"Poured from bottle into a tulip as directed by the bottle. Pours golden straw color with white foam that sticks around. Smells floral with light citrus. Very good mouthfeel with good carbonation but not fizzy. Taste is an elegant belgian ale. I am not a huge fan of Belgians but wanted to try a RRBC beer. This was the only one I could find I this area and it didn't disappoint."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking orange color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of wheat and some citrus flood the nose on the beer. The taste of the brew has some interesting floral and fruity flavors going on in it. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth, silky and easy to drink. Overall I feel this brew it quite impressive, much like everything from Russian River. I like that this one isn't a sour because everyone just raves about their sours so much. This one is really good and it's something a little different from them."
"Pours a bright gold color with a think fluffy head that refuses to go away, great lacing throughout the drink. Aroma of sweet malts and bitter hops that are both present but working together. Taste follows the nose makes for a refreshing, easy drinking brew. Tastes a lot like redemption but more full bodied and complex."
"O: Overall very nice. A somewhat lighter flavor, but still quite interesting. Another beer that seems to come off as the easiest thing in the world. Like it just happened."
"O - Overall a great brew, Not to heavy, not to light. I'm not really a big fan of Belgian beers however this might have been what I needed to go over the top. Can't wait to try RRBC's other Belgians. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"I really like the carbonation in this one. Just thick enough with I wasn't expecting to like this beer but I'm really enjoying it. I won't go out looking for it, but if I found it in the fridge, I would be pleasantly surprised."
"O - Solid version of the classic Belgian pale where the pale malts really dominate, but the yeast adds just the right blend of authenticity and breadiness."
"Notes: A little too strong on the bready, malty flavor compared to the fruity and yeasty flavors. It's a good and tasty beer but not a go to beer for either the style or the brewery."
"Overall Experience- with so many other golden ales to grab I am not sure this would be my go to golden ale. I did however enjoy the bitter dryness that it possessed. a west coast hop character that fits well, and a mouth feel that would throw anyone for a loop. These characteristics however make it very enjoyable. and a great dinner with friends bottle of beer."
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. The color is a faint yellow with a slight orange tinge, with just a faint head with faint lacing. Very effervescent and bubbly. Faint taste of tobacco, with a nice tartness, taste of green apple. Crisp and clean taste. Not my favorite ""tion"" but glad to try it. Lacks a little bit of ""oomph"" for my taste. Solid beer, will not seek out."
"A crisp Belgian Golden Ale but for me the bitterness cuts through just a bit too much for the style."
"A very pleasant beer. This is my introduction to tasting Russian River and I hope it is not the last. They have a flair for Belgians."
"I was pretty disappointed with this beer from what I’ve heard of it. I tried it as my second beer of the night and I just thought it was good, but nothing special. Ehh."
"I definitely prefer this to the Belgian originals."
"O- Not sure if it lives up to the hype, but it is really good, and more then anything EXTREMELY unique. I just don't think my palate was ready for all that flavor. Will definitely revisit this in a few months"
"Overall: really enjyed this beer from russian river. Its delicate and complex."
"Yet another great belgian style ale by Russian River."
"Over all a very nice middle of the road Belgian Ale."
"O-a well-balanced beer, a good accompaniement to food"
"The Rest: Great balance and an awesome mouthfeel make this a really enjoyable beer. Other than a slight medicinal note in the nose, it's not hot at all for being almost 8%. Another winner from Russian River!"
"SkÅL!"
"O- good beer, would definitely have again, Not as intense as some of it's other (ation) brethren form Russian river"
"Overall, a decent beer, but I've had better from this style."
"I suppose it's only natural that I compare this to Duvel, as it's an archetype of the style (and, well, I drank this from a Duvel tulip). On the basis of that comparison, this falls short, but overall this is a fine if unspectacular Russian River offering."
"NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O- Overall this is a very tasty brew that can hold its own against any other BSPA."
"The taste was great fresh on this one. Again, all I can really say is how crisp and clean this is. Never a favorite style of mine, Damnation is certainly a favorite within the style. So cool to have tried this fresh... I really want one of those growlers now!"
"O - Quality brew from RR, but far from my favorite offering."
"Beer pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white two finger head. Retention is good, and it leaves a touch of lacing on the glass as it dissipates. Floral aroma with some estery notes from the yeast. Earthy hops and a bit of spice as well. Light to medium bodied with a very nice balance between acidity and sweetness. In fact that balance to me is what makes this beer a success. Some beers of this style can get a bit sweet. Also there might be a bit more hops than you would find in a traditional Belgian beer, but that's just fine by me. Overall this beer is very refreshing and one that I would drink on a regular basis if I had more access to it."
"O: A good, 'typical' Belgian pale that is quite refreshing and does what (I believe) it was intended to do. Great drinkability, and overall a great summer beer in my opinion."
"Pours a clear golden color, off white fizzy head retains very well and lacing is evident on the glass. Aroma of sweet Belgian yeast, citrus, candy sugar, mild floral notes. In the flavor, a nice balance of yeast fruityness, bubblegum, citrus hops and pale malts. Alittle Belgian yeast spiciness lingers on the palate. Hint of apple skin. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spritzy carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A ""damn"" fine Belgian Pale Ale, almost bordering into tripel territory. In either case, a nice belgian golden ale."
"Batch #054. Another unnecessary, though greatly appreciated, extra bottle at the tasting. Right on. It pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light lemon zest, light coriander, and a tough of Belgian yeast. The taste holds notes of wheat, lemon zest, orange rind, lime zest, and a very light touch of caramel. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a fairly solid BSPA, but a bit on the boring side. It's good, but it doesn't bring anything special to the table. Bit of a disappointment, if you ask me (and clearly you did)."
"I paired this beer with some lightly barbequed jerk chicken and it went extremely well, enhancing a lot of the spices in both the beer and food. The calming bready and yeasty qualities were great and even on it's own this is a very solid demonstration of the style."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. It was refreshing and interesting, but with all I had hear about RRBC I had hoped for more."
"O-not my favorite by Russian river but definitely a quality brew, pretty easy drinking for a close to 8% abv beer"
"Pours a light amber, 1/4"" white head. Nose is fruit and spice. Taste is much the same, fruit and spice. However, there seems to be a battle between bitter and sweet which throws me off a little bit; oversweet up front, mildly bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel light to medium bodied, heavily carbonated."
"O - Not as impressive as Redemption, which was the other beer from their Belgian line that I had, but nonetheless a good solid beer."
"o-great beer and the price is right too. I'll drop one in the cellar and see what it does in a few years!"
"M - Medium body. Medium carbonation."
"O- Excellent American brewed Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Very enjoyable and easy drinking brew that pairs well with food."
"Light to medium bodied for the style, and a nice dose of carbonation make for an inviting mouthfeel. It is a bit dry on the finish. Certainly something I'd drink again, another nice offering from Russian River!"
"O: A very tasty beer, in a beautiful bottle, and for half the price of either Consecration or Supplication. This beer is the best taste for the best value that I have seen from Russian River. A real winner."
"O: Very drinkable and a good beer, however not at all special. Corking this was wasteful."
"Another solid showing by RR. Nose and taste is a little on the lighter side but everything is balanced and works well together. A great beer to drink on a hot day like today. For the style, I'd definitely recommend this one."
"O- Pretty good BSPA. The peppery presence kinda threw me off. It was a nice surprise. Another good beer by RR."
"Overall: I enjoyed this brew. I would have liked the flavor to linger more between each sip yet this is still a fine ale."
"Overall: This is a really nice Belgian and quite mild given the abv. Quite well balanced and I'll have another when given the chance."
"Overall a nice brew-- not extreme or off the wall, and would go great with pasta."
"Final thought - at $4 a bottle and a nice 7%+ ABV. You have to try this one and maybe age another"
"D-Overall this brew was good. very drinkable and the flavors came together nicely. RR has alot of other brews in this style i would pick before this one but can't complain its a good brew."
"IMHO I like this better than Duvel. It goes down smoother and seems more complex. Well done, can't wait to try their other beers!"
"I popped the cork on Damnation and poured it into my glass and felt happy though being damned. I really liked the fuzzy golden color with two fingers of head, nice and pearly white. I first put it to my nose and inhaled, pleasantly surprised. Light and citrusy with a definite hint of banana, and just a speck of spice. Very pleasing. Upon tasting again was quite pleased. Has a very light feel in the mouth: mild carbonation, nice linger that gets all the taste to the senses. Doesn't coat the mouth heavily. The taste comes across like the smell, citrus notes, a hint of spice in the back. The taste is not overpowering but very good. Overall I really like Damnation and would definitely buy this beer again."
"been in the bottle for nearly a year, according to the RR website, really a nice treat, hope to find again"
"Was bored last night so I went to Apex in Portland with 7 dollars in my pocket. Was more than surprised to see 12 oz pours for $3.50. Got two. I love this beer. If I was someone looking to start drinking Belgians, this is the best tasting around. I normally like bottle conditioned beers better but this was outstanding. It looked good from the start. It smelled great. Not too much funkiness and slight spice notes present. Really makes me want to drink instead of regret like some Belgians. The taste is amazing. Nice sweet tones with a touch of spice that is expected but not too strong. The good mouthfeel really helped this quench my thirst on a warm summer night. Amazing beer with the high abv. It is not present at all. It almost made me wonder if Russian River is accurate with their calculations. Nevertheless, this is a beer to have bottled or on draft and normally I designate one or the other but never both. Exceptional experience and most likely will go back for more this week."
"Only my second beer from Russian River, liked them both so far."
"this is RR's belgian offering. it's got that belgian flavor immediately. it's tripel-y, but not as cloyingly sweet as many tripels seem to be. the citrus probably helped knock that down a bit. it's certainly the best american belgian style i've had, beating Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde, which was not an easy feat! it was amazingly drinkable for its high ABV."
"Murky straw colored pour with a pillowy white head that left spotty lacing. Aroma is yeasty, with banana, clove, and a light citrus nose. The flavor has quite a bit of lemon and citrus notes to it. The hops come through in the end of the taste and make it very refreshing. The beer is medium-to-high carbonation, which is what I expect with this style of beer. Very drinkable for a beer of this alcohol content. 7.75%....wow."
"Poured a hazy but bright golden yellow with a fluffy white head. Light fruits in the aroma, bready, pale malts and subtle spice. Biscuity taste with a medley of fruit flavors: banana, peach, pear, citrus. Some light sugar and spice in the background. Dry finish with some hop bitterness coming in at the end. Light-medium mouthfeel, complex, and quite the pleasant quaff."
"An incredibly delicious and easy drinking Belgian strong pale. Wonderful!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is pretty moderate for the style. Overall it was an excellent beer. Very nice flavors and also well balanced. Probably the best version of the style I've had from an American brewery. Very nice overall."
"Overall, a really nice and pleasant Belgian style golden ale. I would be interested to see how the funk develops over time, but it drinks well as a refreshing golden ale now. Balanced and suitably complex."
"O - very tasty, hides the 7.75% alcholol well, it went down smooth and quickly"
"O- Very refreshing drinking experience, solid golden ale, very smooth, easy drinkability, just a solid example of a Belgium style beer. Nice and complex."
"o - overall, a solid BSPA. a little sweeter would've made it perfect, but overall a very nice beer."
"The further I got into this beer, the more I enjoyed it. Very tasty and smooth with lots of complexity and balance. This was the first RR beer other than PtE that I've tried and it didn't let me down."
"For its style its pretty damn tops. I highly recommend this one."
"Another legit US made Belgian beer. The look is golden with a soda pop head that slowly disappates to a quarter inch layer of head that retains through the whole drink. Lacing is very good. The smell is pleasantly yeasty. The taste is where this beer really shines with honey, mild lemon, vanilla, and bread - really drinkable. Damn, I wish they had this in Chicago..."
"D - An interesting take on the style. I was initially worried that this bottle might be undercarbonated, based on the strange lack of head, but as it turned out it was very well carbonated. I can't explain the lack of foam as this sort of beer is usually capped by a tenacious head of sticky suds, especially in bottle conditioned versions. Aside from the foam issues, everything else shapes up nicely. There is some of the obligatory fruity yeast character present, but the emphasis is really on the soft, bready malt and the intense, spicy hop profile. This is a bit of a departure from the most successful Belgain Strong Golden ales that I have had, which tend to emphasize bright fruit notes and yeasty spice along side the hops and malt. It works fairly well here, but I feel like it would be more enjoyable with a stronger yeast profile to fill things out. Pretty nice (and reasonably priced for something from RR), but I still prefer classics like La Chouffe to this one."
"overall this is a really great american rendition of a belgian style, one of the better ones i've come across. not quite world class, but flavorful and exceedingly drinkable."
"This is easily one of my favorite Russian River beers. It is reasonably priced and is so solid in all aspects."
" Overall this is a well crafted brew,I really enjoyed.If you enjoy Belgian style ales then this is a nice brew to seek out."
"O - Light and refreshing, yet complex and delicious. A perfect take on this style."
"Finish: Long and and some what dry. It really finishes complex and layered with plenty of flavor."
"O-A great beer, light and refreshing but with enough hop backbone and great clove flavors."
"This particular bottle didn't have much head or any lasting lacing, which is why I dropped the appearance score slightly."
"Very dry, with a prominent white pepper component that leads to a tart and crisp delivery of flavor. Finishes with some acid, but the tart notes and high carbonation scrub the palate fairly well. Body is fairly in the medium range, surprisingly full for the acidity. This is a strong entry into a style loaded with heavyweights."
"Overall: This is a good beer when it is 90 degrees outside. It was highly effervescent and very refreshing. I prefer Duvel over this variation of a strong golden ale, but how can one bead perfection in that category."
"Overall it was a fantastic bottle that I will seek out again."
"Good spices in this beer. Surprising beer from this very good brewer."
"An enjoyable take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale. A little sweet for my taste, but that is not reflected in my ratings. My ratings reflect the solid craftsmanship this brew presents."
" Giant frothy head that takes several mminutes to subside. Smells pretty good, nice and light. Taste is very good for the category. Nice and light and bubbly, amost champagne like. Everything is on point with thsi beer. Not my favorite style but I appreciate it for what it is, less shitty than a lot of blondes I have had. Clean and crisp so if you like the style give it a go. This will most likely be my first and last of these (until my roving freaking palate changes again). A fine drink for the style."
"Overall: Nice beer, very drinkable, but not very memorable. I see this beer as either a nice ABV session beer, or an entry level micro that packs a punch for beginners*, keep in mind I am a hop head, and love flavors and bourbon barrels."
"This is a nice beer that captures the essence of a Belgian beer yet still has enough complexity in the finish to make it stand out."
"A very nice beer from a great brewery. So used to having this on tap, and it doesn't disappoint from the bottle"
"O=I really like it and would get it all the time if I lived in California, but here on the east coast there are some substitutes that are worthy enough for me."
"Pristine golden, now with very litle head. Aroma similar to above, with a slightly pinier aroma. Much less carbonated than Batch 22, which makes the mouthfeel less lively, sweeter, and in general not as good. Ratings based on Batch 22."
"I may give this another shot, but I wasn't impressed. The flavor is dominated by a very quick, dry, sharp finish. As I said before, it's a bit like chardonnay in that sense. An experience I haven't had before with any beer, and not really one I want to repeat."
"O- Overall I felt this was above average but it didn't really rock me. It's mimicked a belgian flavor very well but whatever spice is in here was a little offsetting for me. Would try one of the oak aged versions though to see if it improves any."
"O: Wow. This one is something special. Wish Russian River was available back home as this would be a brewery I spent a lot of money on. Haven't had one yet I didn't love."
"M & D - alcohol not as hidden as I'd like it to be. Creamy due to the lace. Smooth, the slight sweetness balances the alcohol - almost."
"D: This is an overall pretty solid Belgian. There are nice spicy notes that are well balanced with the citrus and malts. This is definitely not a beer for everyone but a solid beer nonetheless."
"overall - this beer goes into my ""once is enough"" category. not my favorite style, and the price was steep. not worth it."
"drinkability: best belgian pale Ive vere had. love it, not a big fan of thwe style"
"O: Very nice beer. If it were cheaper, I'd drink this quite often. Much enjoyed."
"Overall: Worth it for me to try out but I like the Sours and IPAs much better."
"O: This beer is a solid representative for the style, but its hard to rate it against the best. As much as I enjoy Russian River, I can't give it full marks (but it's close...)."
"O-not my favorite by Russian river but definitely a quality brew, pretty easy drinking for a close to 8% abv beer"
"O: Absolutely delicious! Extremely balanced, easy drinking and a medium complexity that has just the right amount of each flavor represented."
"D: Fantastic Belgian Golden style ale made for the perfect summer day or the coldest of winter nights. This is the most perfect representation of a Golden from the U.S."
"Excellent drinkability. The ABV is well masked and the beer is very refreshing. The aromas and flavors are complex enough to make you want to keep drinking this but you'd have to move on after a couple due to the ABV."
"-Cheers"
"The drink on this brew is great. It is not overbearing by any means, bit has a great blend of flavors that make it a great brew for any time of the year. It has a great dry finish, and its beautifully clean. An amazng brew by Russian River, and probably one of the best represenations of the style by an American Brewery."
"O: Good beer, if not my favorite. Definitely a strongly Belgian flavored Ale."
"Overall, this is damn fine in its own right, but it wouldn't be worth a trip to California to get it with so many other great examples of the style available."
"CHEERS"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - This is the most drinkable Belgian I've ever had. Usually with most others, I enjoy it up until the aftertaste. That's where the skunked, weak, rotten yeast taste comes in. But not with Damnation. The finish remains strong in the bread department. Sweet biscuits and fruity spices are a nice change from that uncomfortable Belgian finish I am used too. But maybe I've just been drinking the wrong Belgians. I have not enjoyed a Belgian Beer this much since St. Bernardus Tripel; which Damnation completely destroys. Medium bodied and extraordinarily enjoyable. I may have to ask MadVermin to send me another of these in the near future."
"Mouthfeel is very diverse and well-done. Starts creamy and rich as mentioned earlier, almost like a milk-shake, then moves to a gritty, chalky middle and finally to a dry, bitter end. It's a nice cycle of feels that is the best part of the beer. Initial feel is good, but a bit too much combined with the sweetness at that juncture for me though. Drinkability is solid due to the variation in textures and flavors, although hindered by the start. Affordable, good beer from Russian River, and a great American brewed Belgian strong pale ale."
"Had a great experience with this after long-mounting anticipation. A nice wheaty beer that's labeled as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale but tastes similar to a dubbel. Hoppy, mildly sweet with a little bit of tanginess. I enjoyed this beer, but priced at $15/bottle, I don't know if I'll have another soon. Especially since I liked the Redemption a good bit more. All the same, look forward to having this again down the road."
"it's really all about the yeast though. that is the overriding flavor profile for me -- it has that unique Belgian yeast taste and feel. this would be a great racetrack beer. or at a game. i would liken it to hennepin, and direct your attention to cooperstown."
"Though this was certainly not perfect (Could have used better clarity, a stronger aroma, and higher carbonation), it was quite good and the flavor is complex and delicious. It's also relatively light on the palate and dry, which only makes you want to drink more. I could drain several of these, which is probably not a good thing give its nearly 8% alcohol content. Bravo Russian River."
"D- Very high due to such high taste marks. Alcohol is a perfect amount."
"Pours a pretty wimpy head, not much there, not even a fingers worth. The color on it is very nice though, it's orange and cloudy, looks like it's one step away from being a belgian wheat beer. It is a very unique appearance, in some ways the color has hints of white, very interesting. If it weren't for the head this would get a great rating, to it's credit though, the frothy-ness and bubbles have stayed at the top of the glass where they were poured, it's leaving a nice foam rim around the top of the glass, almost like huge lacing or something. I'll go ahead and give this a 4, just because I know it deserves it. The smell is very nice, it smells very crisp. You get that sour smell on the nose, but it is not offensive at all, in fact it smells like it compliments the beer very well. You don't get much other smells other than that on the nose, maybe in the distance you can pick up a little but of that beer smell. Wow, this beer is bursting with flavor. You get that Sour taste, but like I said it is not overpowering or offensive, then you get a nice sweetness at the end, not too much though. I'm definitely picking up hints of fruit in here as well, maybe mango, tangerine, or peach, it's hard to tell. There is also a nice spice or herb flavor, it's very hidden, but it balances out the fruity flavor well. Not too much hop or malt here, you maybe get a little bit of hop bite in the front end, but not much at all. Overall the taste is pretty good! Mouthfeel is good, not amazing but good. Drinkability is very high for it being 7.75% ABV, they hide the alcohol very well in this beer. Overall A very well done beer all around, nothing is wrong with it and there is a lot that is right with it. Are my socks blown off? No, but it's a solid beer."
"CHEERS!"
"Based on my prior readings about this beer, I expected more from the flavor. It's hard to give a beer such a good overall review with a summary that hints to dissapointment, but after all that I read the flavor just did not pack the depth I saught. With all of that said, still a great beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable even @ 7.75%. It didn't leave me feeling full as some other overly carbonated examples do. I would have liked to have seen this in a 750ml bottle instead of the 375ml bottle. A very good example of the style."
"Drinkability is good for this style but to me, this is more of a sipper. Overall, a solid beer that should be respected."
"d: Very drinkable, at a price... (7.25% according to their board)"
"D- Incredibly smooth an quaffable. The alcohol is so well hidden, and the beer is just overall pleasant to consume. Wish we had more here on the East Coast!"
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a subtle orange tint and a couple fingers of light fluffy head. Smells of citrus and belgian yeast, both of which are prominent in the first (and every subsequent) taste. A medium bodied brew; fruity with little hop character but the powerful yeast is balanced nicely by a little note of alcohol at the end. Great lacing all the way down which would have been a nice sight at the end if it weren't for the empty glass. Highly drinkable, this would be an ideal session beer if it weren't for the price."
"Drinabilty - Much better then redemption but honesty still to mild. Very very drinkable and tasty still. Doesnt seem like its even close to 8% alcohol. Wish it had a malt presence to it to give it some kick. Not bad at all but cant touch duvel."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. The flavors are addicting and mesh great, but I would've liked to see a bit more carbonation to help compensate for the bone dry finish."
"D - Like it's sister beer Redemption, this is one that could be drank all night. Another great brew from RR!"
"The beer smelled of clove, yeast, pepper, a little zest and a malty sweetness. The taste was clean and pleasantly spicy, citric and sweet, with a lightly hoppy bitter and resinous finish. It was edium mcarbonated, oily light and refreshingly easy to drink."
"Poured from bottle (batch 23) into snifter glass. Slightly hazy pale golden pour with a lasting, rocky white head. Aroma is a little funky, and musty, with lemon, banana, thyme, vinegar and spice. Flavor has the same funky, musty quality but the fruit notes aren't as prominent with the herbal, spicy notes standing out more and with hints of wood and sourness. Light, dry mouthfeel with plenty of soft carbonation and a lingering bitter, slightly sour finish. This is a particularly good Belgian style ale, very faithful to the style. Very easy to drink with restrained sweetness and no sign of the alcohol. Delicious."
"D: This beer is so drinkable it's almost unsafe. The alcohol is completely non-existant, and the dry finish makes sure you keep coming back for more."
"Dr: I'd definitely have it again, especially at its price and ABV. I find myself hitting the bottom of the bottle while it's upside down to make sure I get every drop. You'd never know it was 7.75%. It's pricey but worht it for celebration."
"The CPJ"
"D - This is a very tasty ale. No surprise that Russian River made another great beer."
"D: I have really enjoyed this stateside take on a classic Belgian style. Cheers to Russian River."
"Mouth is medium and somewhat slick. This beer is so drinkable it's crazy. A very clean, refreshing take on the BSPA style."
"Drinkability: The best Belgian I have had at the brewhouse tonight. I'd buy it again."
"T: Nice and crisp with the yeast again making up the body of the flavor. The only thing off for me in this beer was the carbonation. It felt like this beer was a little too flat for me. Still, a good beer and another achievement for Russian River."
"D: Reasonably good. I'm not an avid fan of this style, but this is a pretty good example. Well done by Russian River."
"Crisp and bright up front but then quickly fading to matted, numbing tartness and chalky yeast on the palate. The fine bubbles then fizzle up a bit at the end and brighten up the lingering sourness. Characteristic of many RR brews, the mouthfeel really steals the show and makes all the difference in accentuating the best attributes of this brew. A balances, mellow yet complex beer makes for high drinkability in my book."
"I saw this beer as a solid homage to the likes of Duvel, pours a pale slightly clouded golden hue into a chalice...the bright white head layered up nicely forming fine Belgian style lacing that formed even layers as it dwindled. Aromatics provided a nice malt driven honey drizzled biscuit pale malt with hints of spice and dry yeast notes, tropical fruit with a spicy alcoholic tone as well. Finishes with herbal spiciness from both the hops and the yeast a bit of citrus as well. Flavor was actually not as complex as the smell, which I was surprised by. Expected a tropical fruit flavor also accompanied by pale malt breadiness with citric/herbal hops shining through, nice dry yeast finish with a touch of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel was perfect this is where must brewers screw up a Belgian style ale, this one hits it with a nice effervescent level of carbonation perfect for the style. Drinkability was effort lesst this is definitely textbook solid Belgian style ale everybody else take notes, because this is the training wheel level Belgian ale from Russian River once they start with wild yeasts and barrel aging things get even better. Thanks god this is a really great place to start, I want more."
"Very enjoyable."
"D= Very drinkable goes down very smooth wish I had a couple more."
"D: As good as can be for a beer with 7.75% ABV."
"Drinkability: This is probably the second best BSPA I have had. If only Duvel was not such a great beer, this could have a chance. Still, a great change of pace and a clearly well-crafted brew."
"Overall impression: excellent body and aroma for the style, but too metallic."
"Carbonation is fairly high but right on for the style. Flavor coats your palate for quite a while without being too sweet. Very easy to drink considering the ABV. Glad I got a chance to enjoy this one. Big thanks to a non-BA friend in Philly for sending this gift along."
"D - Light, delicious and well balanced, what more needs to be said?"
"This was a late Christmas present from my sister in Seattle, my first RR bottle re-fermentation experience. Poured slowly into my DFH snifter, pours a yellow-gold cloudy color. Smell- apple, butter, chardonnay, a hint of clove. Taste- apple cider flavors, belgian yeast is very present, nice refreshing carbonation. Some spices and there is that clove again. Mouthfeel- I love the big carbonation, this is a very smooth beer. Drinkability- I had to force myself to slow down on this and let it warm up. This is amazingly drinkable. Overall, I'm impressed. I also got Supplication and Temptation in this package, I can't wait to try those. How is it that the brewery that makes the best IPA on the planet is also capable of doing something this different and still have it be world-class? Its unfair that we cant get RR in Texas."
"Another tick on my RR -tion quest! Massive thanks goes out to Jerriko for sending me multiple bottles of this in a past trade! Batch 047 (so close!) Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter (thanks for this glass Lunch!). Poured a slightly hazy straw yellow with a three finger pure white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, earthy, dark fruit, and very slight alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was a VERY nice brew. The flavors of this one were very close to the ones I picked up on when I tried a '23' while in Cali, but without the wood and everything in this one seemed muted in comparison. However, for a beer of this style it was quite excellent in both flavor and aroma. Very glad I got to enjoy this one!"
"D: Good."
"Definitely the lesser of the Russian River beers that I've had but not a bad one by any means. These guys really know what they're doing."
"Has good flavors that er on the spicy side for sure, bitting up front, the pepper has been doubled and covers alot of the fainter fruits that were on the nose. Surprisingly dry, with a noble hop earthyness. An awesome tasting beer."
"Poured into a snifter. Hazy golden yellow with a frothy head good retention and lacing. Smell very floral, fruity, banana and yeast. Taste light and dry floral body, mellow and sweet fruity notes, very earthy beer, medium carbonation, very smooth and drinkable, excellent beer."
"D: Not a hint of booziness, very smooth and light on the tongue. While it's a good beer, it's not great. That being said, it's probably one of the better American-made versions I've had."
"D-A good beer, but not Russian River's best production or interpretation of a beer style. I'll be damned; I have finally had a Russian River beer I won't care to have again."
"Not my favorite BSA, but it is definitely a beer that I can taste and appreciate."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Overall it's tasty and not too agressive on the palate. As stated, alcohol is hardly noticeable."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a tulip glass, per suggestions on the bottle. The beer poured a bright orange-yellow coloring, cloudy and vibrant. There was a thin, sparsely foamed head that dissipated quickly. There is a sour-cider/apple type smell, blended with malty notes. Bits of spice in the nose, also. The beer has a low-grade, light malt forward flavor, with some spice and citrus sweet offshoots. Very mild flavors, and not overspiced like some Belgians. Tasty. The spice sticks through to the aftertaste, and there is a smooth, slightly sour finish to the brew. Pretty tasty throughout, but a creepingly strong flavor that makes this a tough one to follow-up immediately with."
"Because of the hard availability of this though I wouldn't be knocking down grandma to get it. It's good but I am not blown away by it at all."
"D- Made me wish I had just bought another bottle of this instead of Angry Boy Brown Ale. Very Drinkable, amazing.. damn good damnation, one of the better Belgian Strong Pales I've had yet, not to be my last."
"Drinkable, but not as enjoyable to my palate as the more balanced, crisper Redemption, and maybe my least favorite Russian River to date. (Note: Least favorite RR is still winning.) Then again, BSPAs are not my favorite style, and I have a hard time immediately thinking of one I prefer."
"375mL bottle poured into a tulip. This bottle is from batch 62 but there is no info for this batch on Russian River's website yet. Pours a cloudy, bright yellow with an inch of lumpy foam an lots of carbonation. But the foam quickly dissipates and there is no lacing. Spicy and sweet nose with classic Belgian notes of banana. Medium bodied with spot on carbonation. Rich and full on the palate. There is an earthy quality to it that is unique. It's not a roasted malt taste. I enjoy it. Honey and banana on the palate. The finish is long and sweet but not syrupy or resiny. Very pleasant. Even though it doesn't exit the palate cleanly, it is quite drinkable. I could drink a whole 750mL bottle to myself easily."
"Aroma is floral and vibrant like the first day of Spring. Rosewater, corn (I get that from sugar adjuncts) and fruit fresh from the vine, stalk, bush, wherever. Taste follows up the fruity cornucopia beautifully - I pick up green apple, cantaloupe and fresh pear. Champagne-ish carbonation and delicate body. Fits the sinisterly sessionable character perfectly."
"drinkable - dangerously so."
"Batch 60. Appearance is clear golden with an almost vortex of turbidity in the center. Sweet standard belgian smell, very nice. A great taste, nicely sweet lingering bitterness then dry. A solid belgian style but for some reason more appealing (freshness?). I'd get it again but would be nice to find something more easily attainable with this taste. Will have to keep looking!"
"Drinks off the charts. There's not much, including the 2012 end of the world event, that could ever make me not want another one of these wonderful brews. I know what I'm drinking come the end of the world. :)"
"D- I could drink this all day and night. I was worried about it but it ended up pulling through in the end. What a great beer. Russian River my hats off to you"
"Drinkability: Going through this way too fast. Wish this was a 750."
"D: Very good. I could enjoy quite a few of these as they are among the better of the Belgian strong pales. A tasty citrus malty backbone makes it a refreshing drink for a warm day."
"D- A great easy to drink Belgian style ale. Good complexity. I really wish I had more..."
"Verdict: Good beer, worth trying for its complexity, but not elite."
"D= This is a very easy drinking beer for sure and a wonderful beverage but I expected a tad more from RR. Amazing to say the least but this is just a little let down."
"I was very excited to finally try something from Russian River. A friend of mine shipped some home for the holidays. It poured a watery pale straw yellow with a light, light white head. It had some slight cloudiness and bubbled the entire time. It smelled of yeast and alcohol. I would've expected and preferred something more. It taste fine but wasn't spectacular. It was good but not life altering. It drank smoothly and pretty thin. This beer was very drinkable. You wouldn't know that this was near 8% at all. It was good but not anything too special."
"Pungent ripe oranges with some belgium yeast and spices. The refermented yeasts give a dense punget ripe taste but the balance of the spice and fruit balances it out perfectly. Best Golden Ale Ive ever had. Wish I could get some more."
"drinkability; very pleasant with well hidden alcohol. Goes down easy and leaves just enough of an aftertaste to entice another."
"Appearance has a light amber color with a thick healthy head and good lace. Smell has a light yeasty farmhouse belgian aroma with citrus notes. Taste is spicey, floral and pretty much a straight forward Belgian style with minimal alchohol present. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. A nice easy drinking, but not to complex belgian style ale."
"overall, I loved this beer, it's semi-readily available so I will turn to this often. for me, it jostles with bruery premiere for my favorite beer."
"Had this on tap a couple times on my trip. I reviewed it twice in my phone without realizing. Luckily I basically wrote the same thing, so this is combining of the two notes. Pours a pale yellow with thin white head. Smells fruity, I think I get sweet pear, to go with Belgian yeast. Very dry flavour overall. I get some spices more in the aftertaste, almost like a saison."
"D: This is an all around great brew to drink, I wish I had access to them and a pub to get draft pulls. A nice all around brew."
"Overall: A very nice beer in the style. Personal preference is for more floral spice (think PranQster), but this was very good."
"This beer is a winner, great representation of the style, abv well hidden."
"Drinkability: A fine drinking brew from Russian River, the first one I've had and still one of my favorites. I usually have at least one of these in my cellar (this is my last one, guess I gotta go buy more), and I would recommend this brew to anybody. Cheers!"
"I would drink this  much faster if I know I could get them more readily or if it wasn't so pricey in my area. Really hides the alcohol well, and I have another one of these in the fridge that I might drink tonight. "
"D. A nice subtle take on the style. Quite refreshing."
"Drink- If this was cheaper I could drink 4 in a row. Overall a very nice beer."
"I like this offering much better from the bottle than the tap."
"This is a wonderful Belgian style American ale. Lots of bright citrus with a slight funky note from the Belgian yeast. Banana, clove, spice, and citrus all combine to form a rich yet refined brew. Medium weight, not too heavy, perfect alcohol content for the body. Finishes very smooth. Immensely drinkable and satisfying."
"Poured in a glass, it is golden yellow in color. The aroma is like fresh bread and some fruit like characteristics like apple/pear, lemon zest, possibly from the Belgian hops. The taste is pretty similar, sweet but hints of lemon and citrus. In terms of body it's very light and had about a 2 finger head and medium carbonation. There's a lot of complexity and flavors for (what I would consider) a pretty light ale. Light and refreshing for the summer."
"I enjoyed this beer and would recommend it although it was not my favorite of the beers I tried that day at Russian River Brewing Company."
"4.0 D: Definitely a good beer. A bit pricey, but a good treat every now and then. Solid throughout."
"Overall, a decent Belgian, but the taste alters a bit too much from the nose in an unwilling favor. Nice mouthfeel, but ends too dry for me. Decent drinkability."
"Wasn't particularly sure if this would be sour or not (it wasn't), but it was a really good brew, in my opinion. Light, zesty, refreshing, it reminds me of a spring beer--actually in the same vein as Fantome Printemps, though not as good. Light bodied, well carbonated, great drinkability. Lemons, some grassiness, and light malt/yeast notes are the big players here."
"The taste is lemon, alcohol, and slight biscuit. The alcohol is definitely but almost in a good way and is covered pretty well for the most part."
"Light to medium bodied, finishes dry and somewhat bitter. Well carbonated. Another great beer from Russian River."
"Bottle. Batch 43, thanks to mothman. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed orange amber color with a big pillowy bone white head of 2 fingers. Nice lace left on the glass as it settles. Really citric nose with pineapple, orange, and pear. Nice light mouthfeel with good carbonation. The sip yields a nice flavor of fruit cocktail with the aformentioned fruit but without too much sweetness. Some alcohol notes. Some bitterness kicks in in the middle and stays arond until the end. Drinks fairly dry. Ends nicely with a subtle warming effect. I went into this beer without expectations and I find this is quite a nice drinking beer without being overly cloying or boozy."
"This brew pours a golden straw hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy whipped three finger head and heaps of lacing everywhere,the smell is mainly banannas and belgian yeast mixed with tropical punch,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel with yeasty bread the first flavour i get followed with a bananna/coconut/paw paw hit very tropical flavours and is rounded out with a barley sugar sweetness right at the end,overall not bad but to be honest i was expecting a little more but glad ive tried it."
"D: Very drinkable. Could easily drink another if it had a little more flavor"
"D: highly drinkable. This one does not exhaust your palate after a sip."
"D: I tend to think of this brew as the baseline brew for RR's sour beer offerings (eg. Supplication, Temptation, Consecration, etc.). Don't expect a jaw-locking sour experience here, and if one were to do a RR sour beer tasting, I would recommend to start with this one. I honestly couldn't image a more refreshing craft drinker."
"D: This beer is a faithful but characteristically American interpretation of the style that's delicious and continually invigorating on the palate. The alcohol is felt before it is tasted, in line with other Belgian-style strong pale ales of quality. Capable of taking the place of a dry white wine in pairings, the presence of too many heavy savory flavors would bury the delicate nuances found here."
"O: A definite sipper, this one definitely drinks like a Strong Pale Ale."
"D-Delightful. Just a great beer. Highly drinkable and I would have this again."
"Overall this is a pretty inoffensive example of a belgian golden ale, but there are too many outstanding alternatives out there to convince me to revisit this one."
"D- Awesome. I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was expecting, but still a solid showing. Clean, sweet, and only a few flaws. Above average by far. I'd love a few more of these just to enjoy while playing some LoL."
"Very drinkable, and dangerously sessionable."
"Drinkability: A wonderful and delicate beer that gets the flavor out. One of the most pleasant citrus beers I have had. This might be my favorite in the style. I do want this again."
"An enjoyable Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I could go for one or two more in a sitting."
"D - Just the right amount of drinkability for me. Enjoyable and easy to keep drinking, but rich enough to make you savor the flavor."
"I have never been an outspoken fan of this beer, but rating it's components, I keep coming back to them all being very good. Strange. I suppose that as a whole it just doesn't make that much of an impression on me while still being a superbly well crafted brew. Mind you, I do enjoy this with some regularity."
"D - A delightful beer. Something I'd buy again if it wasn't such a rare find here."
"Drink- I'm sure it's not an everyday beer. However, it was a good beer and for what it is a great example of what RR can do with a beer. I don't think I could handle more than 1 or else a second would sneak up on you and make you forget a section of time."
"Despite the mouthfeel you continue to drink to try to discern and enjoy the underlying flavors."
"Pours a heady golden color. Lots of lingering frothy goodness. Aroma is sweet, earthy, flowery and spicy. Flavor is very much the same with notes of banana clove and some spice followed by bready malts. A real nice balance to this beer. Not my favorite style, but a damn good example."
"Being my first Russian River beer, i will have to say I'm impressed by the overall presentation of their products. These people really care about beer and it is seen in their craftsmanship. Excellent job."
"Overall, a very drinkable, complex ale. The flavor is very good, and makes for a nice, palate-friendly beer. It has some good funk to it, and tastes like a really good white ale."
"D- When you pour a beer called Damnation you expect something dark and strong. Strangely it wasn't, however the taste really made up for it. No flavors really jumped out but the blend was very good. Would have drank a couple more of these if I could!"
"A light wheat, but very tasty. It is similar to Duval."
"d- eady to drink, great offering from russian river - i see how it's a classic beer. i would drink this again for sure."
"D- easily drinkable. Just another solid Russian River beer"
"D: This beer was nicely drinkable - very light, crisp, and refreshing. This is a perfect example of a straight up 4 beer. Good, but nothing about about it really stood out as remarkable."
"Drinkability -- This is certainly a good beer, but not world-class. This beer may - in a small way - suffer from comparison to the Pliny's and its '-tion' brethren. Subtle, quite drinkable, but it really doesn't compare to much of the pales from the old country. For the price, one would be better off with it's obvious inspiration: Duvel."
"This is very drinkable and an overall solid brew. However, it is not the finest RR has to offer."
"Poured this into my snifter and noticed a thick foamy head that soon dissipated to leave a thick cap. Smell is of banana, cloves, honey and of course yeast. Taste is of honey, spice, and slight hoppiness that is hidden by heavy yeast. Mouthfeel is immediately crisp and tart with high carbonation smacking you in palate. Drinkability is high. Goes down easy, a pleasure to drink. I have been impressed with neary everything I have had from Russian River."
"Ample carbonation and a light, full mouthfeel. Initial banana sweetness balanced by lemon bitterness and some creaminess with a touch of wheat character. Finish doesn't linger too long, but is very nice with some sour apple tartness (and just a bit of metallic character). Very nice overall with a solid balance of flavors."
"Would be a perfect beer for a wine drinker making the transition."
"Overall: A big thanks goes out to Wisrarebeer for bringing this one back from SanFran! Russian River Damnation is amongst the finest beers I've tasted. It has an elegant appearance with a persistent head and a strong hops nose. The taste is a perfect blend of hops and barley with a distinct Belgian bite and smooth feel. Give this beer a shot, and you'll be glad you did!"
"Lightly hazy straw color with a medium thick off-white head that dissipates quickly. Small particles floating freely, and thin sheets of lacing. The aroma is potent fruit (banana and melon) and yeast. Medium-bodied and tart with fruit and peppery spices, along with some hops and malt. The finish is spicy and short with a lingering sweet aftertaste of banana and clove."
"The palate opens sweeter than the nose would suggest with a rather prominent blend of spices and fruit. Pear and citrus come to mind, and the spice is rather prominent with white pepper and an almost astringent, drying spice character that I can't quite place. Mildly sweet, there's a blend of sugar and honey. The mid-palate also has a floral character with some rose water. Medium light in body with high carbonation, this is really zippy on the palate, more than I like, and more than I remember it being. I wonder if the elevation here in Breckenridge is causing more carbonation to be liberated than would be expected at sea level. The finish is drying and spicy, which, while intense, is not too much. Solid stuff, I really like this beer but when I can get a Duvel for $14/4pack, I wouldn't drink this too often. Not as hoppy as Duvel either"
"Clear golden color with two fingers of white head that had very good retentionn before settling to a thick cap. Lacing was a little weak. Spicy aroma of cloves. Some fruit and honey elements but the spice is the big player. A little more complex in flavor. Still plenty of spice but I also get some white wine, mead, lemon zest, and some earthy hops. The more of this bottle I drink the drier it seems to get. Medium body with a lovely carbonation. Love the texture of this beer. If anyone could challenge Duvel or Delirium Tremors it would be Russian River. An excellant example and finely crafted beer that comes close to those Belgian greats."
"This is a good beer, but I was left wanting. I have another bottle from this batch in the cellar, hopefully it will stand up to the expectation I have of a Russian River golden after a few years down there."
"drinks well. fruity, spicy, and pretty tasty. alcohol is integrated and barely detectable. would drink again as a refreshing alternative to bigger beers. Though thats impossible due to my location relative to its distribution."
"When I'm finished with this bottle, I'd love to have another!"
"First exposure to the Belgian side of Russian Rivers portfolio and damn are we off to a good start."
"D: well it's certainly strong. It's got a lot to like, mainly the fact that it's about as dry and warming as a single malt Scotch. Not sure that it's all that sessionable, but then what pioneering American beer is these days? I'm not a fan of that smell though, it belies a funkiness the taste doesn't actually deliver on (thankfully)"
"Damn."
"Drinkability: very drinkable enjoyed very much. Russian River does it again with another great beer."
"Notes: Really really tasty. A little too expensive I think, but beer costs what beer costs - i can understand that. Drinkability suffers a little due to such high carbonation level. Glad to have drank this one and would gladly drink another!"
"MF/D: highly carbonated that quickly dissipates, could drink as a session beer... too bad its not available in the midwest. hard to believe its 7.75%."
"Poured from a bomber (batch 54) into a snifter/tulip glass. It's a golden/yellow color with a moderate thumbsized white fluffy head. Excellent lacing. Faint smell of belgian spices and citrus. The taste is very mild and somewhat tangy. Belgian spices and yeast. Almost tastes like muted Fruit Loops cereal. It has that mash of flavors that are complex but don't allow you to pick out what is going on since they are so subdued. It's an interesting taste, difficult to describe. It's slightly light-bodied but mouthfeel is still adequate. It's certainly drinkable. Nothing tremendously outstanding here, but it's well crafted."
"D: Had this once a while back and must have gotten a bad bottle because it wasn't anywhere as good as this. Very solid brew that is easy any enjoyable to drink, but it's not quite as good as some of the Belgian ones, especially in the mouthfeel department. Still, yet another amazing RR beer."
"Drinkablility is excellent, I expected less than the 7.75% Russian River does an excellent job at replicating an already excellent style. Love the price compared to other RR's: will seek out again."
"D: A solid beer, and a good example of the style, especially from an American brewery. Russian River doesn't make a bad beer."
"Carbonation is not overdone and the beer is not extra heavy. Drinkability is superior with little alcohol burn."
"D - This is a pretty solid BSPA. If I didn't see the bottle I would have guessed it wasn't brewed in the US. The bottle was gone before I knew it..."
"Edit: As the beer warms there is a more prominent grape and vinous flavor. Especially white wine it is slightly tart and delicious."
"An enjoyable domestic take on a classic style though not quite on par with the better Belgian examples."
"T- The taste follows the aroma very well. Lots of spicy white pepper. Very juicy with light fruits like green apple and pear. A chalkiness from the earthy, spicy yeast comes around at the end just before a refreshing blast of pear juice."
"Taste has assertive carbonation, the yeast has a good presence but isn't overwhelming, the citrus is refreshing, a decent amount of spice kick."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is weak and light but not surprising for the style. This is a very easy to drink beer but it didn't have a lot that stuck out to me."
"Pours well golden, with a little one finger white head, dense bubbles and fades to a thin white ring around my glass. Aroma is of fruity yeasty esters specifically apple, pear and apricot, and a little wet dog. Tastes crisp, clean, fruity, again green apple, pear and apricot. A little buttery. Kinda nice prickly carb, slides over the tongue. Nice drinker."
"The kind of beer you can appreciate more you have of it. At only $4.25 a bottle, was more than a worthy excursion into this style, very drinkable."
"750ml bottle, batch 47. Pours a hazy golden color with a frothy, off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, caramel, fruit, yeast, bread, and earthy hops. Flavor is caramel, pear, grapes, yeast, spices, and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is medium, sweet, bitter, and dry. Great beer."
"m/d-very fulling in the mouth with the variety of fruit flavors. possible one of the smoothest drinkers that i have ever had, leaving me wishing that i could have another at some point. this was one of the best drinkers that i have ever had and I was very disappointed that i couldn't bring any home to my fellow beer lovers."
"Batch 054 750ml corked. Pours a perfectly clear golden color (looks like champagne) with a beautiful white, frothy head. Scent is somewhat spicy with some highly detectable Belgian yeasts. A bit peppery with some sweet fruit aromas. A bit of a floral aroma as well. Wow, the taste is very divine. I've had this beer fresh, but this one's got a bit of time on it. The flavors are very complex with such subtleties that make it an awesome Belgian style ale. Initially, you get the crisp floral notes followed by a peppery/spice bite. There's a fruity sweetness that is in every moment of the sip as well. The mouthfeel as crisp and clean (like a triple). I'm really liking what a little age has done with this beer. Drinkability is EXTREMELY high with alcohol hidden perfectly."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and am impressed with my first offering from Russian River. I will definitely be trying more from them!"
" A stellar brew, and another star from this incredible brewery."
"Quite tasty although a bit funky for me. Funk heads would not be disappointed."
"DB- A nice balanced Belgian flavor. Not too spicy with a good fruit aspect and some hops. Hard to describe because it is really just another variation on the often unbalanced Belgian flavor set."
"I dunno, nothing really struck me as great for this one, a rarity for Russian River. Then again BSPA has never been my favorite style."
"Ddrinkablility - As with just about any other RR beer I've had this is top notch easy to drink maybe too easy with a good take on the style this is worth finding to try sometime"
"Pretty easy to have several of these and not notice that it's a fairly strong beer."
"This was my first Russian River, and now I'm more jazzed up to eventually try the Plinys than ever. I'm lucky enough to live in PA, where I get to at least try some of this brewery's offerings on the east coast, but I've still yet to find either the Elder or Younger. Maybe someday. This will certainly do in the meantime."
"Poured a golden orange with yellow highlights with a half finger of head that left good blotchy lacing sticking to the glass. The aromas were wonderful which consisted of pears, apples, banana, slight spice, belgian yeast, and a good malt presence. The flavors on the palate were very similar to the nose but the fruit characters were a bit more potent which was a great thing for me. It was nicely balanced and had nice pear, apple, banana, and spice notes that really complimented each other. The malt was not as but did help out to stabilize the sweetness. The brew was medium body with a good amount of tingly carbonation that had a sweet fruity and slight crisp finish. It drank very well and was super tasty. I've had this on tap and in bottle and have to say I like it better out of the bottle. I'm glad I have access to this beer on a daily."
"D - Okay, but I think I would rather switch over to some of the drier and cleaner-finishing examples of the style (Duvel, Afflgem Blond) before having many of these in one night. Still a great beer, and a good example of a Belgian style beer that is made by one of the only breweries in America that can actually get these beer close-to-correct."
"Consumed: 8/8/2010"
"Updated score to reflect my more ""mature"" palate."
"In the meantime, I want to find a way to bring this beer to Houston so I can offer it to Joel Osteen and put him on YouTube saying OMFG!"
"D- Almost want to compare this to a heffe, not my favorite style, yet it's highly drinkable. Especially on a hot day."
"D: Great beer! Really loved this one. I would drink it all night if I could afford it! : ) can't wait to try this one again!"
"Drinkability: Flat out solid -- great scents, flavors and a weight that won't bog you down; ABV may start to feel like a bit much though at nearly 8%, but I feel that if time is taken, this could be drank all night."
"Taste is mildly sweet, pretty highly carbed but brewed to style. Tasty brew for sure."
"Poured from a 330ml corked and caged bottle. Has a ridiculous head and a really nice honey yellow orange color going on. Smell is very fruity and has a touch of floral hop going on. Tastes very very nice. Has a fruity taste with sour peaches and nectarines. Slight hop profile to balance out the body of the beer. Really spectacular. Mouthfeel is nice also with that Belgian style floral hops going on. Drinkability is also high as this is really just delicious and balanced. My second Russian river beer and love it."
"D- Different for the style, but I really like what Russian River has done with this. It is very earthy, smells strongly of cedar when cold, and as it warms, the fruit flavor and smell come out. I will be having this again when I can get my hands on it."
"D: Yes very drinkable!"
"Thanks colonelforbin for an amazing extra"
"F: Dries well with some lingering wheat and Belgian malts, some citrus and orange as well. Touch of a malty finish with slightest hint of bready flavors."
"This is a good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Something I enjoyed. Though it has just a bit to much soapy hops for me. If you can get past that, a very good beer that is worth a try."
"Drinks: with ease. Russian River's choice to distribute some of the bigger beers in 375 ml bottles is welcome, as it makes these epic brews that much more affordable, attainable and easy to drink in one sitting. A 375 of Damnation sits atop the list -- it's a damn good example of a Belgian strong pale, and while not Vinnie's best, it may just be his most drinkable."
"Overall - Good beer, Russian River has yet to disappoint. However, this beer was not quite what I was expecting. For a golden ale I think that it's just different enough to be more innovative than disappointing if that makes sense."
"D-highly drinkable and delicious, but its so hard to obtain in Maryland; I can get it in the Philly area suburbs, but thats still a good hour drive; its a great version of this style and definitely worth seeking out"
"D - As with just about any other RR beer I've had this is top notch easy to drink maybe too easy with a good take on the style this is worth finding to try sometime"
"This is a very well balanced brew and a very good example of the style."
"The RR Damnation pours a hazy golden straw color with lots of carbonation in the pour and a very pillowy sticky head. Aromas are doughs and lemons with some banana and yeast. Taste is pretty light but refreshing. Palate is lemon peels, yeast, subtle alcohol notes, and pines. Mouthfeel is light bodied with lots of carbonation. This is a very drinkable summer brew that is very refreshing."
"Damnation is a fine beer to say the least. Drinkability is great, though toward the end of the bottle, I'm definitely feeling it. On one hand, I kind of wish I split this with someone else. Then again, my drinking buddy that would most appreciate it moved to Seattle & told me a few days ago about a bar that had this on tap. On second thought - no regrets about enjoying this by myself."
"D: A great example of the style."
"Feels like a quencher and the abv doesn't show up. Pretty good drinking, but I can see slapping some ice cubes in it on a hot summer day. It just isn't that complex to me."
"It drinks like a like a lower ABV beer and has all the qualities of a fine Belgian ale. It doesn't have any features that make the beer stand out in the style but it's a solid beer that can't quite stand up to the classic Belgian beers like La Chouffe and Duvel."
"I love this beer!"
"Damnation's incredibly well-balanced profile makes it dangerously drinkable and endlessly repeatable."
"M/D: Thin body and nicely balanced carbonation. This is a pleasant ale, but I certainly won't be buying it all the time. Especially if it's between this and a Duvel..."
"D - I may not be one to buy this again and again, but if it's offered to me, I'll never turn it down."
"I'm glad that one of Russian River's Belgians got into my pre-OCS beer experience. This seems almost too easy to drink for a BSPA, the alcohol has no presence at all; no spice, no heat. As my first of the style it has left a favorable impression."
"The body is medium and carbonation levels are very high, probably too high. Overall, this beer is a fantastic example of the style. Easy to drink, no off flavors."
"D- Easy drinking and totally can't detect the 7.75% ABV. Just a little lacking in the flavor profile. The first RR beer that hasn't wowed me. It was bound to happen sooner or later."
"D - Very good drinkability given the ABV. The carbonation and light body make this a very easy beer to drink."
"And I'll also add that while people seem to be going nuts over sofie and matilda from goose island, damnation has been around and is just as good of an example of the style."
"Is Damnation as good as Duvel? Not to me. But that's a hard standard to live up to. Damnation is one of the finest Belgian Strong Pale Ales I've ever had. I like that it is available in smaller bottle size. I'd buy it for meal pairings if it were available in my area."
"Not my style, but good"
"D - This is a good beer, but it is certainly no Duvel."
"Cheers to psiweaver for the 750 ml bottle. Damnation pours a nice looking, nearly opaque, tangerine. A voluminous, frothy white head forms and lingers, but the lacing (or lack thereof) is a bit of a letdown. The aroma is good, clove and some sweet fruits, but I'm hoping the taste has a little bit more to it. My prayers are answered, as in addition to the flavors present in the nose there's a distinct lemon-grass flavor that works well for the beer. It's still not quite a 5 in terms of flavor, but warrants a bump from the smell score. Vinnie and co. absolutely nailed the mouthfeel, flawless. I can't speak an ill word towards either the body or the carbonation. Damnation tastes good enough that I'd like to sip and savor it, but the otherworldly mouthfeel makes it hard to restrain myself and do so. Just more evidence that Russian River is one of the top breweries in the country."
"Overall this is a fine beer just not really up to the standards I have come to expect from RR. I could easily finish a whole bottle myself though."
"pours a slightly hazy yellow color with good frothy head, good lacing, and lively carbonation. belgian yeast and spices in the smell. taste was much the same with some citrusy lemon hints. light bodied, with a thin slick texture. moderately sweet finish with short flavor duration. good but not great."
"D: This was a very delicate but flavorful beer that was fairly easy to drink, but better to sip. I honestly wasn't a big fan of the flavor, with the waxy character, but it was still very well brewed and mostly enjoyable."
"(D)- A solid beer that is great and refreshing for the warm summer months. Crisp, yet has a good dryness and fruit to keep it interesting."
"Update: After the carbonation drops out, you can actually taste a lot more in the beer. But I'm still not adjusting my scores."
"I'd say this is one of my favorite beers of the style. Great balance, refreshing, and a good complexity."
"D - A very good Belgian strong ale. Good complexity with light alcohol warmth. Not too heavy, but definitely not one you can down easily. Enough strength of alcohol and flavors to keep it a nice, somewhat slow drinker...one to be savored."
"I often fear with American craft brews, especially ""specialty"" ones that I'll get something that's way over the top. This beer's not that way at all, subtle, complex, balanced, big thumbs up for Russian River here."
"D - I wish I would have sprung for the 750 or a few more 375 ml bottles of this. It's a fantastic beer with even better drinkability. Trade anyone?"
"My god does this beer drink smooth! Based on mouthfeel and drinkability alone, second maybe only to Duvel, this might be the best of this style I've ever had. RR good."
"D- It was great to sip on, but I couldn't wait to enjoy every last drop. It's only drawback is that it makes you just want it too quickly."
"Feels a bit foamy, a little bit of sizzle and quite dry on the back. Decent for the style but doesn't amaze me. Overall it feels a bit harsh at times, drinks almost like a lemon slice has been dropped in, but not overall offensive. A decent beer."
"Overall this beer is fairly bland and the finish is unpleasant. After drinking Pliny The Elder I was very excited to try this beer and I am quite disappointed with it."
"I've had this beer on tap in the bay area dozens of times, and I found it to be so much better. Perhaps the carbonation was dialed in by their taps for our benefit. The carbonation is not unreasonable for the style."
"D- Interesting but a bit light on flavors and a bit over carbonated. The alcohol is well hidden though."
"1/2 finger light golden clear body, minimal visible carbonation, with decent lacing. The nose is big banana and clove hit, with the taste more clove than bananas. Tart dry finish with good effervescence, good attenuation. Be careful re drinkability high ABV creeper. Worth seeking out for fans of the style."
"jd"
"A very drinkable beer; ABV is hidden well. It's not the most complex or adventurous RR beer I've tried, but this is a great example of just how solid Russian River's brewing expertise is. This could easily be confused for a genuine Belgian."
"D: Sort of the flagship of Russian River's Belgians, and with good reason. A well balanced and really flavorful beer."
"D: This is spot on as far as a Belgian golden ale is concerned, an excellent example of the style. Highly drinkable, crisp, no hint of alcohol makes this a damn good beer. Highly recommended."
"D: This may be better than most of the Belgian brews of the same style. It's vibrant, flavorful, and extremely easy to drink. If I were to have tasted this blind, I would have sworn it was from Belgium."
"Poured from a 12oz. corked bottle into a Duvel tulip. Amazing head on the pour, three and a half fingers of it. Rich golden color with moderate carbonation, slightly hazy. Smells like bread and earth with some citrus notes in the background. The taste mirrors the smell, the yeast is sedated but adds a nice sour bread note to the whole deal. Nice medium body, very easy to drink. I'll have to go find it on tap and give it another go."
"Very drinkable beer, very Belgian in style, very nicely done. I'll be damned!"
"Taste is nice and delicate, moreso than I thought it would. Yeast spiciness and esters come through first and are finished off nicely with a hoppy bite. There is some sweet grains in the middle and a touch of alcohol but overall it is very well balanced. Very soft beer, and oh so drinkable. Not as highly carbonated as perhaps a Duvel, but the carbonation is so fine that it is very silky going down the hatch. I split the 750 with a friend and my half disappeared with astonishing rapidity. I'd probably say that I like Duvel better, but not by a whole lot. This is a very nice beer and a good example of the style. Makes a perfect first beer of the day."
"Another example of incredible beer from one of the finest breweries in California - keep up the good work !!!"
"This beer seems far easier to find in the stores than Blind Pig or PtE both of which are fantastic."
"D: At 7.75% ABV I can see why the restaurant was pouring 8 oz. drafts but this one is deceivingly drinkable. A great springtime/summer brew."
"Especially with the soft, dry finish - this is one extremely drinkable beer."
"Low carbonation, fairly light in body, and thus pleasant enough to drink. I could definitely have more than one of these, although this time around it was only one."
"Flavors work well as none are competing with each other (good harmony). The tropical fruit flavor burst is delicious and the mouthfeel accentuates the taste. Highly drinkable and very well crafted."
"Drinkability: I usually can not drink this type of beer for more than one 750 mL bottle, however for this brew I could drink about two bombers."
"D - Easy enough drinker, nice tasting, wouldn't mind this one again."
"Here's a ""lighter"" strong Belgian pale for you aficionados of Belgian-styled beer. Just be aware that the 375 ml bottle may not be enough for some."
"Overall this a a nice beer. It's a notch or 2 under Duvel for the style but very drinkable."
"D: An easy drinker, but not something I want a bunch of in a night. Reminds me a lot of Duvel only with slightly less body."
"d- goes down easy, above average belgian style beer from a good brewery. recommended for sure."
"Overall- great. will buy again. nice, balanced well done Belgian golden strong. not unique, but really well done."
"Pale yellow body, with a thick white head. Light floral notes on the nose, along with Belgian yeast and maybe a hint of clove. On the palate: bready, malty, yeasty flavors cut with a hint of spice citrus. Easy to drink Belgian style golden ale. Nothing more, nothing less."
"d - excellent."
"Overall a very tasty beer. Would love to have it again."
"D - very drinkable. A beer I'd definitely go back to."
"D- excellent."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, begging another sip - or to be paired with just about any food. Need to try this next to a Saison, because this reminded me very much of Dupont, but perhaps lacking the, rustic barnyard-edge. An awesome Belgian-style beer that can stand with the best of them, imported or not."
"This is a dangerously drinkable beer. It's smooth and elegant, and complex enough to invite serious imbibing. The ~8% ABV doesn't make a real presence except for a very slight warmth once the beer reaches temperature. I find it hard to believe this beer only has an A- on beeradvocate.com. I give it a solid A. I would take this over La Fin Du Monde, and possibly even Duvel, depending on my mood. Well, I wouldn't take it over these, but it would work in rotation with these excellent beers."
"Over all very reminiscent of the style, good job by russian river."
"This is a refreshing beer. Its lightness is deceptive, though. The 7.75% ABV will catch up to you quickly."
"- Overall this is a fantastic, and unique golden Belgian ale that has a nice array of flavors, and hits the spot. A touch meaty, and earthy indeed."
"This tastes fantastic. I definitely get the standard bready taste, but also lots of hops and banana. There are layers to this ale. You get the sweet flavors at first and finish with the bitter flavors. Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't an extremely hoppy ale, but you do get it towards the end and makes it exciting to drink."
"d - Overall I thought this was a very good Pale Ale. Looked great, and had a very nice light belgian taste. Didn't get much bitterness or alcohol taste to it like some people. Would definitely have again."
"D: Very drinkable. Not much else to say."
"D-easy drinking, doesn't show any alcohol, pretty big flavors, ripe golden fruits and a notes of spice. Well done...again..."
"The alcohol is minimally detectable. This has good flavor and is one you can easily have a few of."
"D: Well balanced but thought it would have a little more flavor. Still, this one gets an overall ""noms"" from me."
"Overall Impression: It smelled amazing, but the flavor did not meet expectations. I expected more from this Devilish brew. Still, it's a Hell of a good beer, and it's definitely worth trying."
"D- At nearly 8% ABV its a good one. I have no issues putting a couple of these down. Light on the stomach and a great beer to drink with food or just to have after a long day."
"D - Great overall."
"Medium bodied, surprisingly low carbonation on the tongue. Beer is fuller than I thought it would be. There is some yeasty esters in there and a bitterness with a citrus / lemon like character to it. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is fine."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a hazy golden color with one finger of white head. The retention was as a collar and the lacing decent. The aroma was bright and appealing with Belgian yeast notes, bananas, lemon and spices. The flavors were equally enjoyable, a well-balanced blend of citrus hops, tangy yeast, toasted malt, pale malt, spices and a touch of grain. The alcohol was well folded into the brew and it had a nice arc of starting sweet and then heading towards bitter finishing on the yeast note. The mouthfeel was creamy and slightly slick, the body medium and the carbonation light. An excellent example of the style for this side of the pond but still not quite as complex as the real, Belgian article."
"D: awesome Belgian American beer"
"Very good example of the style. If it were available around me I'd definitely buy it. Definitely worth trying."
"M - Good body, a little more carbonation that I would have liked but I'm certainly not going to let that ruin what is otherwise an excellent beer."
"D - COuld drink a bottle on my own"
"Not my favorite offering from RR and arguably quite overated IMHO, especially given it's premium price-point."
"D - Very well balanced. This 750 ml bottle and I will be just fine."
"Overall, pretty decent and highly drinkabile tripel."
"This is a decent beer for an American Belgian-inspired. However it is not a superior example of the style lacking some complexity."
"I would enjoy the chance to pair it with a mild curry and see what pops. (Or I will drink it again on the merit of the brewery itself, and be rather unimpressed for a second time, bummer)"
"overall, a fantastic beer!"
"A great beer from Russian River--one with refreshing and pleasant fruity-yeast characteristics that don't get overwhelming as some do."
"Drinkability- First off, this beer was NOTHING like I expected. I thought it was a dark Belgium. Turns out it is not so. BUT, still a freaking tasty ass brew. My favorite Russian River brew is Redemption but this is still a super nice brew. Thanks much Jeff!"
"Great golden color when poured. The bitter flavor hits you at the back of the jaw and lasts throughout the drink. Pours well and looks great in the glass. Excellent smooth flavor and body that is really enjoyable. It's a classic golden ale that shouldn't be missed."
"Very enjoyable beer- a credit to RR."
"Quite tasty, the only thing reminding me to slow down is the slight taste and warmth from the alcohol. Highly recommended, and something i would love to try again. Thanks to raider for bringing this back and taking it out of his cellar."
"D - Highly drinkable, what I like about this beer is the great balance and subtle flavors that tend to be lost in a Belgian strong, especially stateside. Fantastic."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp, and the carbonation has a tight effervescense. My only complaint is the yeast gives me a bit of heartburn."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle (batch 51) into a snifter. It pours a turbid golden, yellow with a long lasting fizzy white head. The nose is fruity/sweet with lemons being the dominant smell. The flavor is slightly sweet with lemons and tart apples, also a bit spicy. It has a somewhat dry finish. The beer has a wine like mouthfeel. It is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Damnation is a damn fine beer that I will seek out again."
"D: Well balanced, goes down easily, slightly prickly carbonation but works for the style. Belgians aren't my go-to style beer, but I could certainly have a few pints of this in a night."
"Pours a nice light golden color, good carb white head. Some cloudyness but very welcome with decent lacing. Aromas of lemon citrus, some spice and floral notes, very lively. Mouthfeel is fantastic not too light, but is a little earthy with a zesty edge. A very satisfying brew and although it isn't as good as batch 23, I wish it were around me all the time."
"Pours a golden color typical of Belgian ales. Sea foam disappears quickly and not much lacing. Smell is very flowery with a hint of lemon. Taste is again flowery with a bitter bite up front. Some spiciness. A tiny bit of alcohol burn. Very light and drinkable. Extremely enjoyable."
"Overall - Very delicious and easy to drink. This was the first RR beer I've ever had and I loved it."
"Overall, with all the hype I had been hearing about Russian River beers, it didn't really attain those high marks. I'd be curious to see if the long travel for the keg (had this beer in Philly) had anything to do with my overall impressions. Would like to try this straight from the brewery."
"D- I lke this beer! It is tasty, refreshing, and very quaffable. It reminds me of Stone's Cali-Belgie, without the bitter hop bite in the finish. I will definitely be enjoing more of these in the future."
"The beer is medium-to-high carbonation, which is what I expect with this style of beer. Very drinkable for a beer of this alcohol content."
"Pretty good. One of the better versions I've had of the style."
"Damnation is openly an ode to Duvel, the reported original of Belgium's characteristic strong golden ales. It compares very favorably, perhaps more so than any other commercial example I've tried, whether from inside or outside of Belgium. Increasingly, American brewers are catching up to their Belgian counterparts but there still aren't many who can beat them at their own game - Vinny Cilurzo, however, is definitely one of them."
"Thanks to petecz for the opportunity to try this one. 750ml corked and caged bottle (Batch #49) served at 53 degrees in my New Belgium Globe glass. Poured a translucent golden orange with a dense, two inch bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap, leaving behinds thick, clumpy strands of lacing as it recedes. Nose is fairly clean - citrus, a hint of candi sugar, a touch of anise and perhaps a slight earthy/herbal quality. Taste consistent with nose, but some light fruity esters come out in the mix as well - perhaps passion fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a palate cleansing background carbonation that culminates in a dry, fairly clean finish. Excellent brew - might be my favorite Belgian Strong Pale. Well-hidden abv, refreshing and all around easy drinking. I just wish RR was available on the East Coast."
"75cl bottle, batch 38, thanks to larryLSB for getting this one from the brewpub yesterday. Rich, deep golden color with a fluffy white head that starts pretty big, but settles into a thinner layer after a couple minutes. The aroma has some pear and green apple, some light lemon, cinnamon and spicy alcohol, and some leafy hops. Pretty sweet, honey-like malt flavors, with fruity accents and light citrus. Finishes a little peppery and bitter, but there is a lingering sweetness too. Medium bodied with fizzy bubbles, and a little stickiness in the end. Nice flavors, but I would prefer it just a little bit dryer."
"D: I crave this beer and order it whenever it pops up in my area. I would not recommend it as a session beer, but 1 or 2 in a sitting is perfect."
"Picked up a bottle @ RR on a recent road trip. Poured into tulip. Slightly hazy and golden, creamy, white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is amazing. A very sweet malt, candi syrup, some sweet fruit too, a little grain as well. Taste is good. Very sweet malt with some bread and yeast. Then a refreshing blast of fruit (pear and apple). Mouthfeel is full but not too think. Very smooth and velvety. Overall a great beer and great US interpretation of the style. My only dislike was it was a little too sweet, but not too much. Would drink again in a heartbeat."
"D: Very tasty and very easy to drink. Not really sessionable, but 2-3 in a sitting is definitely doable!"
"Very mellow calm flavor. Definately picked up some grapefruit on the back of the tongue. Very light and drinkable with a low to mild booze taste. Had on-tap and served in a tulip glass at a local bar."
"D: Highly recommended. Were this ever to be made available in Texas I would frequent this more often."
"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. Pours a pale gold with about a finger of head which has good lacing and retention throughout the drink. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a little bit of spiky carbonation. Aroma is sweet fruits, orange, lemon, apple, some peppery spiciness. Taste is a fantastic balance of sweet fruit, pepper and light bitterness from the hops. Yeast was a little more up-front than I would like in a belgian pale, but overall the brew was quite good. I would take this over a Duvel any day of the week. Drinkability is extremely high. I would definitely order this again."
"This is an awesome Belgian interpretation and, although it's not that hard to drink, I could see it taking a toll after a few."
"Poured a clear yellow with a generous head that faded to a skin. The aroma was musty. The taste was sweet pears, the flavor not over powered by excessive carbonation. The feel was light bodied with reasonable carbonation. Drinkability was good. Warming was a definite benefit for this beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer, in general. A strong representation of the style. Nothing I'm seeking actively, but would drink again, if given the opportunity."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but a little off for being a go-to beer. Not one of my favorites from Russian River, but a good beer nonetheless."
"This beer was excellent. It's probably one of the best examples of the style that I've had."
"Damnation isn't a flavor or alcohol bomb, and it's complex, drinkable, and so delicious. Alongside Orval as the best Belgian (well, Belgian-inspired in this case) beer I've had."
"D - The drinkability of this beer I would rate rather well, this is a damn good beer from an outstanding brewery, the only fault I could give it is that it doesn't add up to other things I have had from them, but since that's only Pliny, than its understandable"
"A hazy golden body with a pretty tall white head. Aroma was bread-y, with some light yeast-y and pear-like esters. Flavor was more bread-y than anything else, but again had light and pleasing fruit and yeast esters. Mouthfeel was light and effervescent. Really good."
"Drinkability: incredibly dangerous. Two bottles of this would have me ready to invade Northern California single-handedly."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer, and overall is something I would try again."
"D: Easy to drink, dangerously easy, has everything it needs, but just seems to come up a little short of outstanding for me. Nice beer, and I may consider aging one a bit. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. I quaffed this while eating and while I probably shouldn't have, it was easy to do so. Did not taste the alcohol at all. Overall a nice beer from RR though I do not think I would seek it out specifically again (granted I have a bottle in storage right now)."
"NB: I like it a bit more than duvel."
"Drinkability is solid, this strong pale ale goes down too easily if you forget its` ABV, so sip this great beer."
"Drinkability - Certainly drinkable, but a little too much sweetness."
"This beer lives up to the hype. More importantly, it lives up to my memories. Clear,light yellow when poured, with head that quickly decreass but does not disappear. Leaves lace to let you know what was there and what remains. Smells slightly sweet, but not overpowering. My words, and skills, cannot adequately desecribe this beer. It is deceptively poundable, and wish I had a case of this properly stored downstairs. Well, wish I had at least another bomber of this delight. Easily among my favorite beers of all time."
"Recommended music pairing: Neil Young - After the Goldrush"
"D - Tasty and quenching enough to allow for prolonged drinking, but the ABV does sneak up a bit. Feeling a little silly after my 750 ml."
"D - Very great drinkability, perhaps one of the best Belgian Golden strong's made in America, a quality brew. I enjoyed this much more on draft than the bottle, but that speaks to the style generally."
"Easily drinkable. Good flavors and easy on the palate. You could have this high abv beverage with a slew of dining options and it wouldn't wreck your palate. Unless you decanted the beer with the yeast in it."
"drinkability is good. for a belgian pale this brings the flavor, albeit a bit sharp on the finish. well done, but not great. pleasant on the palate until the finish. cheers!"
"Very much like Duvel and excellent overall like Duvel as well."
"Belgium beers have been sought after for centuries. In the great beer producing country of Belgium the brewers have made some what of a tradition to give their brews an unusual name. Sometimes the names are curious, other times diabolical and then again they can just be silly. The Russian River Brewery out of California has prided themselves on their Belgium style ales and have out done themselves with the Damnation. This Belgium strong golden ale is 7.0% ABV, has extraordinary aromas of banana and pear with mouth filling flavors of sweet malt and earthy hops. The lingering finish is dry and slightly bitter, but very very smooth."
"Very solid strong golden ale offering without being cloying. Almost seems as to have some wheat and banana and clove taste but doesnt offer the peculiarity of a true belgian. Perhaps this is due to a colder fermentation. Almost more similar to a german hefe or old english ale in the tastes imparted by the yeast. Very basic malt profile. Just enough low alpha hops to keep it balanced. Beautiful beer."
"Drinkability is rather high due to the light body and not overpowering flavors."
"D: A good BSPA. Russian River has very good Belgians in general, and this, as their regular offering, showcases why. And I like that this is cheaper, yet better, than 'true' Belgians or even Unibroue."
"D- Complex but not overwhelming flavor."
"Drinkability: 6 ounces in I would've gone higher, but as this went along I realized it's a little too sweet to drink the whole bottle of by yourself probably. Reminded me a bit of a port wine as it's almost like a dessert in my book. It's a synergy beer for sure, where the sum of the parts doesn't add up to it's own entirety, but I'd love to have another bottle on the shelf for a given special occasion as I'd imagine it'd age well too."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, very nice, will be drinking it again and again"
"Opens with a spirited pop that sent my cork to an as of yet unknown location. Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a huge fluffy white head that pillows around and sticks itself to the entire glass on the way down. Aromas of sweet bready grain, fruity spicy estery yeast aromas slight pepper. Tastes of lemon with a slight acidity, mix in esters some funk and spice. Finishes dry leaves a spicy funky taste on the palette. Huge lively carbonation, slick almost resinous in the mouth, medium body. Certainly a Belgian strong pale. This one is a bit much for my taste, but to style its probably spot on."
"A Good beer that I will not seek out but will enjoy if presented."
"D: Much more impressive on tap than in the bottle which is weird for a Belgian beer. The more amazing thing is all the ladies and no experienced beer people who ordered this and were impressed. It really is a beer with mass appeal."
"I'm not a often a fancier of Belgian-style beers, so I might not have developed the palette yet to completely dissect a beer like this. That said, I enjoyed it, but would not order again"
"Honestly, I am not sure how much more I can expect from this style or what is it exactly that I am looking for to be able to give it a few 5's. Maybe after a couple more tries, I will have to re-visit."
"O. Very Good beer. Perfect for lays afternoons."
"This is a benchmark BPA. As good as if not better then the ones from Belgian I have tried. Such wonderful, sweet complexity that constantly evolves with time. I wish this was accessible in Ontario."
"Silky smooth, crisp and dry, so easy to enjoy. Drink this all day, every day."
"Drinkability - I found this beer to be a little bit too one sided for my tastes, but it still is a fantastic piece of work. I had a pleasure sipping this one, and thankfully have another bottle I will enjoy."
"Pours out a cloudy bright orange color with pillowy white head. Leaves some sticky patchy lacing on the edges. The nose is fruity and floral. The taste is very fruity and flora just like the nose. There is bitter hop taste and som spiciness as well. A slight yeast flavor as well. The mouthfeel is very zesty. It kind of bounces around the mouth. Overall this was pretty good. I nice Belgian Pale. Worth a shot in my book."
"Overall Damnation is a dry, lemony, moderately strong Belgian Pale Ale. Good flavor, but it's soft and reserved without a tight balance to tie it down."
"Pours a murky gold with some orange hues throughout. The off-white head lingers for a few seconds then dissipates, leaving a nice stripe of lace all around the snifter with a few skinny fingers jutting toward the rim. Belgian Strong Ales always have an appeasing aesthetic to me, and this one is no different. Aroma is yeasty and malty with a fruity, floral undercurrent. Some sweet candy exists as well. Tastes fruity and malty with a good hop kick toward the end. Some subtle sweet bread, spice and underneath it all some sour apples find their way out. An almost indiscernible phenolic essence is noted. Some notes of alcohol present themselves as the beer warms up. Mouth-feel lies on the heavy side of medium, and it's fairly highly carbonated, making for a smooth, easily drinkable beer. Nice one for sure, and although there are a few others I prefer over this one, I can't find any big faults with this Damnation."
"As much as I love the trappist ales, Duvel is still my favorite Belgian Ale and possibly my favorite beer altogether. Damnation is the only beer that I think is as good as the beer it is styled after. Everything about it is similar. Great carbonation, outstanding flavor and aroma, perfect belgian mouthfeel. The only difference is that Damnation may be a little bit fruitier. I had this instead of bloody mary's this morning and it was a great choice."
"Big thanks to WasTrinkenSie for this one!"
"Thick bone white froth on the pour, looks like you swirled it with an egg beater, lots of lacing streaks across the glass. Light bronze orange in color, not much hue change towards the rims, clear enough to se the pinpricks of bubbles rise upwards. Sort of a ""beery"" nose, yeasts and raw pie dough predominate, then there's orange blossom, clove stick, apricot pits and pear skins, comes across as remarkably openly knit and airy, very restrained sweetness. Medium-bodied, the foaminess in the mouth is gentle, however, takes up a considerable amount of space before finally settling down. The clove, cinnamon spices offset by notes of sharper white pepper. In turn, sweeter orange citrus met by more sour white grapefruit. Not a lot of esters, the apricot, pear, peach fruit succinct and dry. The yeasts too are dry and not overly leesy and creamy. Not ""bitter"" on the finish but has a certain astringency which might throw off some imbibers. Almost shy about its complexity."
"Overall a great Belgian style beer from a famed west coast brewer, and it is delicious. I could drink this on a regular basis. I actually went looking for bottles of this and they are to be had, only a case price was $ 120. That's high, even for a BSPA. If it were cheaper, I would have a case in my cellar. Great beer."
"Notes: A really fine beer. Amazing with the balance and masking the ABV. A pleasure to have and something I will get whenever I can."
"Overall, a pretty solid beer by Russian River. Belgian style beers aren't typically my style, but this was more than comforting to my palate."
"Make sure it's served in a sifter to get the full frontal exposure of this strong belgian style ale!!!"
"Medium dark honey color with a thick white head. Lovely citrus and peach nose. Flavors are well integrated fruits and hop. This is a very well balanced beer with fully layered but integrated flavors. A very pleasant drink with a medium hop and medium long finish. This is one of those ""all around good beers."" It becomes a bit soft and almost elegant as you drink it. This beer goes with almost all food and is pretty universally good."
"Pours luminous gold with slight haze, with generous off-white head that leaves a silky thin lace on the glass. Nose is reminiscent of a good tripel with light fruits, especially apple. On the palate the tripel resemblance emerges again, with soft malt, light fruits again, and a semi-tart and dry finish."
"Drinkability: This is one very drinkable. The flavor and aroma are complex, well balanced, and invite further sipping and tasting. I could easily have a couple of these and still be ready for more."
"Pale golden in color with a little haze. Pours with a lot of head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is sweet, spicy, and fruity with notes of pear. The taste brings on the same flavors as the smell. very smooth. Good balance. Nice smooth hop finish. It is light and very carbonated on the tongue. Overall Damnation has a great balance and I would definitely have another."
"Been drinking this one for years and this may have been the best bottle I have ever had. The year and a half being aged probably doesn't hurt. Will pick up a few more of these and continue to see how they age."
"D - I couldn't detect the 7.0 abv so this is dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: I had to go easy on the drinkability score because ""Damnation"" was an easy drinking medium bodied Belgian style Ale that had some good flavors to it. If I ever saw this beer again, would I buy it? You know what, I probably would because I would like to see what a later batch would taste like."
"D - It does taste great and goes down like a champ but after drinking one bottle i had enough."
"D: Very flavorful and well balanced. Complex enough to be interesting without losing drinkability. ABV is well hidden. Finish is remarkable."
"M/D - nice carbonation that helped make this one seem very light and refreshing, very drinkable with alot going on in flavor. I recommend it."
"D - A very enjoyable beer with a nice level of flavor and a very clean presentation. A solid American effort at the Belgian style."
"Clear golden color. Thin head that dissipates into nothing. Fruity yeast smell-can make out some lemon and some banana? Tastes great, very smooth. Not what I was expecting (funky). Mouth feel-again smooth, nothing lingers. Drinkability is too high. I think I'm changing my mind on these Belgians."
"Review of Batch 044."
"pour looks somewhat light in color. lighter than a saison almost. wit like. but not murky really. pilsner flavor hop... could be more musky... but a nice mellow sweet. palate is minty rosemary. light dusty walnut bread with a light sun tea sweet at the bottle of the bottle... lemon grass, not as sweet as la fin de mod but not as complex a hop character as i would like. quite crisp. light. great interpretation."
"D - This is damn good beer! This doesn't taste like a BSPA as I know them, but that doesn't matter. This is a dirty, nasty, funky, biatch. And I'm diggin' it!"
"Poured a yellow-gold with the amount of carbonation that makes this beer look refreshing. The head got retained in that stubbly sort of way leaving lace as it slowly dissapaited. The smell was very complex with a lot of different spices (pepper, cloves) mixing with some fruity notes. The taste was spicy with a dry bitter aftertaste. Appearance of refreshing held true as I really enjoyed this brew. It wasn't the most dense or complex beer but it was a perfect accent to a lazy Sunday afternoon where something more complex in taste might have offended. A really nice pale ale."
"D- Move over blondes...I have a new summer ale. I can't imagine a more perfect beer on a hot day. The flavors aren't too overwhelming, it's great cold, it doesn't leave your mouth dry nor fill you up and the finish is remarkably clean."
"Overall, this was a very nice ale and I would recommend it."
"D= Very drinkable if you're looking for a complex yet light beer. It is not completely in the ""refreshing"" category, but who needs that unless you're sitting around watching the game and munching on chips and guac."
"The color when poured was light golden yellow with very little foam, but, a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell was sort of a sweet fruity aroma. The taste had a sweet/bitter carbonation on the palate with a good malt flavor with a hint of citrus. Not a lot of favor on the aftertaste, just the taste of bitterness at the finish!"
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Each sip demands another so I can see what comes next."
"D=Very drinkable, this may be come a favorite of mine, i really enjoyed it and the alcohol is not so prevalent to mask the other characteristics."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, but with a bit of crispness, medium bodied. Really nice beer - one of those that gets better the farther into the bottle you get. Well rounded if not spectacular."
"Note: while this beer is listed at 7% on the website it says 7.75% right on the label..."
"I think this beer is good, not great (except for its appearance). It's much more dry than I would have thought for a Belgian Strong Ale (maybe that's where the Pale part comes in). It's very smooth and easy to drink, but it doesn't have that pop I was hoping for."
"I found it to be quite high on the drinkability meter. Sign me up for another! ... even if it is a $14 bottle around here."
"Drink is pretty high. If given the chance i might pick up another bottle"
"T/M/D - yum! Tastes like it smells - light and slightly fruity, and candy sugar sweet but not overly so. A bit of a malty taste up front, and delicate hoppy bitterness in the back. Fantastic. I'd write more but this one is calling for my attention!"
"Drinkability: Nicely balanced and a spicy, hoppy example of the style; very nice"
"Overall this is certainly a very good staple of RR. Worth a shot."
"Great stuff!"
"A solid example of the style."
"Drinkability: Very nice. you could drink quite a few of the 750s alone. Russian River almost never disappoints. Not even close to a clunker in the bunch. Very good."
"After years of hearing about RRs beers, we've recently started seeing them in stores up here in the Fourth Corner. Let's see if they live up to their reputation, shall we? Poured into chalice. Poured a clear, bright golden-yellow. Poured with about an inch of bright white head that quickly settled into a thin solid layer that stuck around for the duration. A moderate amount of lacing. A fairly high level of carbonation (which is apparently an issue with some RR brews). A nicely subtle spice and fruit aroma. The typical spicyness of this style is quick on the tongue, with a slight clove note on the finish. The body is light and refreshing as usual for the style. Nicely drinkable. While not on on the level of Chimay White or Duvel, this is an acceptable version of this style which I will probably try again. Overall an average example of this style."
"Never had this before, but I knew this beer was supposed to be good when I bought it. it didn't disappoint. I'm a big Belgian fan, but pretty much every American beer I've ever had which attempted to be a Belgian style was just a pale imitation. Not this one. I'll certainly revisit it again. An excellent brew from our friends out West."
"D: I liked it but R.R. has better that you can get, but good!"
"Noticeable Belgian aroma coming off the Devotion. Distinct Belgian spiciness, excellent and excellent mouthfeel."
"Highly drinkable & something your non Beer Advocates friends may like."
"I shared the bottle with two friends and that seemed about the right amount of this hoppy California interpretation of the style."
"d - would only have one."
"A nice beer, but it doesn't strike me with anything particular or fantastic. I'm glad that alcohol isn't present in the taste (like many American attempts at Belgian ales), but the balance between the fruity smell and yeasty taste doesn't really merge anywhere."
"D- Easy to drink, very tasty and amazing on tap."
"D: Was really nice to drink. Easy going down. Delicious!"
"D: Overall, this was a very nice beer. For some reason, I didn't enjoy it as much as my notes made it sound like I did. Perhaps I was just in a negative frame of mind. A solid offering nonetheless."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one. It is easy to have a few glasses of this in a session but alcohol will quietly sneak up on you."
"I mail-ordered this one out of San Diego, and so maybe my hopes were disproportionally high. It pours a pale clear yellow with a nice fluffy head. Smells mildly of apples. The taste was a bit disappointing--a mild flavor of apples and pears, but on the weak side. Carbonation was a bit on the weak side--the mouthfeel was a bit watery. Drinkable and decent, but nothing special. I've still not had anything from RR that really impressed me."
"Overall - This is my first offering from Russian River and I was indeed pleased. I ordered this only knowing that it was from RR and nothing else. This reminds me a little bit of Duvel but toned down a notch. Could use a touch more in flavor but it paired nicely with a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese and portobello mushrooms."
"After a quick round-about amongst some fellow brewers standing around the weekend's wort, it was decided the we liked this ber so much that we want to make it."
"Notes: This is very good beer. It's complex, crisp, well-built, and very satisfying. A very good example of a BSPA. Tally up another winner for Russian River. Definitely recommended"
"Clear deep golden color with a scant off-white head. Aroma is fruity sweet - somewhere between apricots and peaches, and slightly floral - like orange blossoms. Flavor is nicely balanced - good hop presence but not overpowering in the least. Sweet flavors of orange and honey, almost kind of herby - like savory. Finish is nice and lingering but not dry or sweet."
"Now i need to trade for redemption to see what that has in store for me."
"A great great domestic interpretation of a belgian strong pale"
"A nice beer to drink if you are curious about the Belgie experience but I feel there are many better one's out there."
"After reading up about this beer, and its sister beer redemption, and trying them in the same night, I can't see wanting to reach for redemption.(although redemption is by no means a bad beer) To me, this is just a superior version of it. ( slightly more robust with more pronounced flavors and a slightly higher ABV.)"
"Overall, a great offering from Russian River and a fine Belgian ale. I look forward to trying the other beers in their lineup."
"An easy drinker, with some excellent flavors. Another solid beer from Russian River. Definitely give this one a try."
"I'd drink this one again, but I do prefer other Russian River beers over this one. For the price, I'd also pick something up over it too, but overall not bad."
"D: Somewhat"
"Soft carbonation and lack of any bold, unbalanced flavors makes for an exceptionally drinkable beer."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D - Sweet but not cloying. Subtle but complex. Very tasty."
"Feel is good initially but the carbonation releases prematurely yielding a somewhat slick finish that shows the alcohol. Rather drinkable nonetheless and probably not the best example of this beer as I think the keg may have been on its last legs."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Excellent beer. I probably couldnt drink it all night, as it hits pretty hard, but I'd like to try sometime."
"Bright golden pour, with cloudy yeast and good carbonation. Yeast carries over in aroma, with some nutmeg and fruit. Taste is light for this kind of brew. Malt and banana, kind of like bread pudding, but with a crisp, a slightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was the star, very smooth and light."
"Drinkability=Very drinkable, good tasting beer. Where's the hops??! J/K...haha"
"I tried this while in the Pac NW(namely the Bier Stein in Eugene) and I am really pissed that I can't get this beer out here in NC. I loved this brew and being a disciple of Duvel I had a hard time deciding which was better. The only thing I figured was that I need more real world data. After Duvel this is the best Belgian Strong Pale Ale that I have had and I need to get omre of this in NC."
"D: Great drinkability and spicing, a great example, tasty sweet and spicy and a joy to consume."
"Overall very good American example of a Belgian style."
"the beer was poured into a Chimay glass. Yellow in color, it only produced a coating of a head, with some lacing down the sides of the glass. The aromo was overwhelmingly sweet and malty. The flavor was very floral, with sweet malt flavors. A hint of alcohol does come through. In fact, I can still feel the slight alcohol burn long after the sip. The mouthfeel is full-bodied coating the entire palate. the carbonation leaves a bite on the tip of tongue. This is a grwat sipping beer."
"In the taste you'll get sweet grain, spicy lemon, honeysuckle, and a slight vienous whitewine flavor. Mouthfeel is light to moderate, and is damn-near one of the most drinkable belgians i've had. The complexity makes this one enjoyable in large quanities...or atleast over a long time period. I stretched this 750ml out through a couple hours, and had left the bottle out after my second tulip glass. As it warmed it got tastier!"
"D - A solid Belgian Pale Ale... I marvel at the way Russian River makes such complex beers simple and accessible, but still utterly enjoyable and able to stand up with the best in any style..."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Dry and grainy, floral hops, green apple, hints of lemon rind, pear and banana. High carbonation, very crisp on the tongue. Pleasantly bitter in the finish, and quite dry. I can understand why this is Russian River's flagship Belgian style beer, it's complex but very accessible and well balanced."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a nice fluffy white head that quickly disappears and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of yeast and fruit with alcohol at the end. Tastes of pears and other fruit flavors. This one finishes very dry. The mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is good, I had no problem finishing the bottle. Overall nothing spectacular but an enjoyable brew."
"Probably not an everyday drinker for me but pretty tasty overall."
"A very solid brew overall. Good first experience with RR."
"Pours a hazy golden color with huge foamy white head. Aroma is of crisp fruits like apple, banana and pear as well as hops and alcohol. Very crisp quaffable beer. Lots of citrusy lemon and orange as wll as apple, pear and banana. Finish is slightly hoppy and dry. An amazingly smooth wonderful tasting beer!"
"Pale yellow colored beer with a quickly fading head that laces the glass.Aroma is spice.Taste is pretty gross mix of fruit,coriander and some other garbage spices.I would have been angry if I had spent two dollars on this but the fact that I spent 15.00 makes me feel like I was robbed.Total rubbish!!"
"overall a above average brew."
"the taste goes right along with the smell. citrus and malty flavor, a little clove and a little banana flavor as well. nothing to totally rock my world, but a great overall good tatse. had a super soft mouthfeel with a bit of a crisp finish and a little carbonation at the end."
"D: Not the most drinkable beer anyway, and, while this is my first shot at this beer, on-tap service probably hurts its drinkability some more due to the coldness and lack of head which detracts from the aroma and thus the unique flavor of a Belgian ale. Not bad by any means, but I think I would like the bottle version much better."
"M/D: Lightly textured and medium to high carbonation works really well with the flavor here."
"Not my favorite belgian, but would be interested in trying again to see if my taste buds were distracted"
"Very well crafted Belgian Pale Ale. High drinkability. Another great beer from Vinnie and the folks at Russian River."
"Glowing golden in color with a frothy white head and superb retention. Steady carbonation and sheets of lacing down the glass. Lightly honey glazed biscuits and crackers with a peppery essence. Earthy hop presence and light yeast. Taste is of fruits and has a delicate bitterness. Some woody flavors intermingle as well, adding complexity to the brew. Apricot and peach, light apple. Medium body with tingling carbonation and a moderate dryness in the finish. So smooth and a treat to drink. I have yet to find a Russian River brew that I didn't enjoy. This was provided as an extra by brandoman63 in a trade a while back. Thanks!"
"Beer is a very watery yellow color, which hides a hellaciously sweet, candied nose. Taste is a mite disappointing after that; like the color, the taste is a touch weak, watered down, for a Belgian Strong. The sweetness is still there, but the beer doesn't have the depth & impressiveness of most Russian River brews I've sampled."
"Nice drinkability. Really glad I tried it and would definitely have this again."
"The abv is perfect for this beer. Very easy to drink. This is not an over the top BSPA at all, very well-balanced, soft, subtle and overall very pleasing."
"Overall - Please try it if you can find it and aren't strapped for cash (mine was around $10). Just a fabulous beer, approachable and very drinkable. There's no forcing this one down, in fact I found myself forcing to drink more slowly. Excellent in nearly every regard."
"D: Good; have had it a couple times and will continue to do so--pretty sessionable for a Belgian."
"Pours a bright, clean gold with a super thick and wonderful head. The appearance is outstanding, but my only knock on it is that the head is not rocky like the Belgians, nevertheless, if I could review on personal preference and not on style, it would most definitely be a 4.5-5 on appearance. The aroma is uplifting! Spicy, fruity, and a hint towards a bit of tartness. The flavor closely mimics the scent, but adds much more complexity and character to the beer. A lot of citrus, hops, and pepper comes through. Fresh green grass also. What an incredible beer. I could drink this stuff all day. It is fluffy and light yet very complex at the same time. Awesome. Russian River keeps amazing me. How do they do it?!"
"D: On the light side which makes it drinkable. Not my favorite RR brew but very tasty. Nothing quite lives up to the Salvation on draft at Falling Rock. My mouth is still watering just thinking about it."
"Poured a light golden color with a decent sized head with some good carbonation. Nose is fruity with yeast. Taste is fruity,crisp with the yeast making a big surprise. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation with a fairly dry finish with the alcohol only barely noticeable. Drinkability is good but I dont understand why this beer is such a big deal???"
"The alcohol is well-hidden and it is delicious! A Belgian Strong Pale Ale (that is tasty, but not too strong) with an ""American"" touch. It has a bitter touch that keeps the sweetness balanced enough. A delightful brew!"
"Good, easy drinking Strong Pale Ale. Could easily knock a few back."
"Russian River hit the nail on the head with yet another Belgian style ale. In all honesty this beer is better then my score would indicate but the nose brought it down slightly, that could be me being picky again though. Thanks for the beer unanimous trader."
"I honestly believe Vinny at Russian River would have to work his ass off to make a bad beer. I've had nothing less than fantastic beers from them. For whatever reason, they have an uncanny ability to brew Belgian styles that are rivaled by probably one other brewer in the U.S. (maybe two). Once again, this is another fine example. Highly recommended."
"Overall, it's not very balanced or complex. It's far too much towards the sweet side, but I find myself liking it regardless. This is definitely a beer that is greater than the sum of its parts."
"I don't think it'll stand out in my mind as something I have to have again, but at the same time it's something I'd be happy to revisit when I'm craving the style."
"D= From a guy who worships Belgian tripels and Duvel style strong pale ales, I am happy to say that this was a damn good example. In my opinion, this is among the best 2 or 3 American versions of this style."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very nice Belgian beer with good complexity to make it intriguing and well-worth drinking for a long time."
"Damnation pours big and golden with a fine head. The beer smells yeasty with a lot of sweet fruit. The flavor is ripe banana with some light citrus and more yeast. There are also some good earthy and bitter notes to balance things and impart that Belgian flavor. The flavor is more complex than I'm able to effectively describe, but I deeply enjoyed the experience. The feel is spot on. The carbonation brings out some bright tones and the alcohol is well-toned but pleasantly warm. It's a very drinkable Belgian with a good light aftertaste and a great flavor."
"Clear golden with a red tint, one finger fluffy white head that looks like a marsh mellow. Light hop aroma, some alcohol. Solid smooth Belgian SPA. Super smooth with a light bite on the finish. I dig it.."
"On draft at the Russian River Brewpub. Poured a pale golden amber color with better than a full finger stiff white head that resisted fading. Huge sheets of lacing with every mouthful. The smell is unique and aggressive; an earthy Belgian yeastiness, malty with a sweet flowery overtone. Visibly effervescent, the mouth is light and refreshing. The mouth and flavors compliment each other. Full flavored, the earthy sweet apple-pear harvest fruit taste is again unique a little spicy and phenomenal. A big fan at the pub who are less inclined to lean towards the more cali-hopped products. At 7.0% ABV, hugely drinkable and a favorite at the pub."
"This is probably one of the best American attempts at a strong belgian pale ale that I've sampled thus far. Kudos to Russian River."
"Pours cloudy light apricot, long lasting and puffy eggshell white head, lots of nice looking lace on the glass. Nose of tropical fruits, wheaty malts and grainy hops. Yasty, complex, thoroughly enjoyable offering. Notes of more fresh fruits, Belgian yeasties, gobs of drying hops all over the place. Love the RR creations. Only problem is you cant get em in the NY/Ct/NJ/MA/Vt/NH area, but....Philly sometimes gets em...."
"Drinkability - Solid, but it won't knock your socks off like Pliny. Still a great brew - I can't wait to see more Russian River come out this way, if and when it does happen."
"D. I could drink this all day. Too bad Russian River doesn't distribute here; I would have a new 'go to' beer for chicken dinners and lighter pork meals."
"RR seems to live up to the hype. I haven't had a mediocre, let alone bad, brew from them yet."
"Recommended as one of the best American depictions of this particular Belgian style..."
"You should try it, but don't expect a revolutionary beer. Just a rewarding and delicious one."
"D- This is another great BSPA. I really enjoyed this one a lot and am sad that I can't get this in my area (though there are examples I like better). Both RR brews I have had are in the top 5 for the style...for me and I am looking forward to trading for more!"
"Overall this is a really good beer. This is one of my favorite styles, and this offering is just a step below the real standouts. I feel like it's a little too bready, and I could have gone for a little more booze. That said, I can't wait to try another RR bev."
"Another stellar RRBC product. This one is an everyday drinker. Thankfully, the Bay Area has plenty of bars that stock it."
"Pretty good, but seems like it's lacking in carbonation for a Belgian style ale. Worth a try."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark yellow/orange color with a decent sized head that dissipated quite quickly and left spotty lacing on my glass. I get a good dose of fruit in the nose including apples, pears, oranges, and some Belgian style yeast in the nose. The fruit is the most dominant flavor in the flavor profile with pears and apple being the main players, and there are also flavors of lemon, pepper, and a slight hint of banana as well. The mouthfeel has medium carbonation with a fairly dry finish with the alcohol only barely noticeable. The drinkability is quite nice even at 7.75%, and I would have never guessed it was that high if I didn't read it on the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is meaty, with a strong bite of carbonation that highlights the citrus-like bitterness."
"D - I'll easily enjoy this bomber myself. Don't think I could open another one in the same nite, but I would think to buy more"
"also, very ironic that salvation is dark and damnation is light. irony anyone?"
"Overall: pretty good"
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D - Pretty solid and enjoyable, not an all the time drinker but excellent for mixing things up and introducing people to craft belgian beer"
"D: This is very drinkable and while I had the intention of just giving it a try I know now I will have to remember to pick this up in the future. I figured Damnation would be appropriate on the eve of the Large Hadron Collider's debut and these crazy scientists trying to find the God Particle. If we do get sucked into a black hole all I know is there are a ton of beers these guys screwed me out off tasting. In the immortal words of the band Weedeater, God Luck and Good Speed."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy duvelish yellow gold/ maybe a touch darker orange. Big fluffy white head of foam. Nose is mostly spice, esters, yeast. Taste follows with estery belgian yeast action, some slight pear, a bit of spice, black pepper. Slightly weaker, mustier Duvelish beer. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side, quite good all the same. Drikability is strong, but not quite top notch. Overall a very solid belgian golden from RR. This is not a mindblowing beer, but a solid tasty staple of the style, impressive for an american made belgian style. Good beer."
" Body is nice and carbonated, but not fizzy. Not exactly the most authentic American take on a Belgian ale, this is a thoroughly enjoyable ale."
"D: Definitely an easy drinker. A really excellent beer for this occasion (porch beer on a nice fall day). Refreshing."
"D- Little too fruity for me. Glad to I got to try this one and I'll probably give it another shot or two."
"""Dangerously drinkable for the ABV"" that is well worth repeating, it will catch up on you. Damm LOL"
"D: Tasty and drinkable. The bottle says 7.75%(not 7%) yet it drinks like 5%."
"Pour a beautifull clear golden color and has a silky tan head. The nose has a rich malt structure followed by candy, light hops and Blegian yeasts. The taste is very similar. Big sweet malts balanced by herbal yeasts and spicy hops. Perfect Belgianesque body and carbonation. Could enjoy this one anytime."
"M/D - Full bodied and rather chewy. First few drinks were very carbonated as well but that seemed to fade rather fast. A damn fine Belgian Pale."
"Batch 40 750ml bottle $4.99 (pretty sure I got a good deal). Nice golden yellow color with a white head. It smells like faint hints of banana, bubblegum, esters, belgian, very nice. Nice flavors that diverge from the nose but are hard to describe. A dryness that works well, easy to drink but I will still sip it because I want to savor the whole bottle. BSPA is not my favorite style but this is one of the better ones I've had. I'd still prefer a Salvation or Perdition but this was well worth the $5 per bottle. It will be interesting to taste this again in a year or two."
"You know to be honest considering the hype, I was expecting a tad more"
"Drinkablity is damn good! As much as I love Belgian Blondes, I'm frankly not a huge fan of these simpler, spicy, Duvel style BSPAs, but this one is probably my favorite, and has really won me over...only my 2nd Belgian style Russian River, and 4th of theirs over all, and I have to say, I'm a real believer!"
"This one goes down easy and clean. Excellent offering."
"Overall, this is the first RR beer that I have tried, and I am impressed. Damnation is a great BSPA that stands up to some of the better originals from Belgium. Recommended."
"Taste is pretty light. Some belgian yeast, some butter and a bit of citrus, but it is pretty muted. I don't get a heck of alot from this beer. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, though I dont think I would search it out to do it again. I did have this beer right after I had a Saison AtheneI(which was incredible and very full-flavored) so it may be a bit unfair."
"The folks at Russian River definitely tried to put an American twist on a Belgian style ale and they did it very poorly. This beer lacked severely in almost all categories. Definitely one of the most disappointing brews I have tried in a while."
"HV"
"a nice sour flavor with much complexity, its like liquid bred, poured into a wine glass (only thing avalable at my cousens house) a two fingered head formed and slowley disapated the beer was a rich popcorn kernal yellow with much sedement floating around in this one. this one hides the aolchol well. i like golden monkey better but this one is good. i have to thank WasTrinkenSie for hooking me up with this one."
"Drinkability: Got through the whole bottle there, and it was very good. The effect this had on my palate was similar to the effect that Stone's Ruination had... that is to say, made everything taste a little more bland right after drinking it, making me mutter to myself ""Damn..."" in a good way."
"D: A good BSPA, but the amount yeast character can get in the way at times, it's kind of the Allagash White of this style. Still it's a good version, and quite cheap compared to Belgian versions at the store."
"Kudos to Vinnie Cilurzo and the RR gang for brewing some of the greatest tasting beers around. Aside from sheer alcoholic strength, this is very easy to drink thanks to fantastic balance and a superbly dry finish. Sweet malts, spicy phenols, and fruity esters marry together perfectly. Perhaps a tad more bitterness would push this to an A+?"
"This to me is a beer in two parts. The initial first smell was West Coast hops and the taste reflected a hoppy presence. As the beer warmed up and opened up the Belgian notes came to the front and the hops seemed to drop off. The beer is very smooth and full of lots of complex flavours including citrus, dried fruit and yeast. Very well made and unlike any other example of the style."
"Perhaps not as good as I was expecting, given the fantastic things I've heard about Russian River, but that's an expectations problem, not a beer problem. This is a very drinkable Belgian PA, which is always a style I enjoy seeing domestic breweries pull off, and this one is pulled off well. If you see it, pick it up. If you see any Russian River, pick it up."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer and goes well with fowl and game. Again since it is high ABV it will put you on your bottom after one bottle."
"From a caged/corked 750, Batch 36. Just an absolutely beautiful beer. Deep golden and somewhat cloudy. A tremendous head that takes awhile to dissapate and as it does it leaves beautiful chunky lacing all over the inside of my glass. Smell is of Belgian spices and some pears and light hops too. Taste is follows up the smells with more yeasty Belgian spice up front followed by some ripe green apples and pears. On the finish a nice bittering hop flavor pokes through. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied, more so than other BSPA's, perhaps, with a very creamy feel to it. Maybe a little less carbonation than Duvel or Delirium Tremens. Very drinkable - cleans off the palate well. Nothing out of balance to slow you down. Right up there with Duvel and better than Delirium Tremens."
"I'm not a big fan of the Belgian PA style but I enjoyed this beer a lot. Very drinkable because of the excellent balance of the beer."
"The taste is hoppier than I expected, and more than the style normally indicates. The other aspects are all there, but not as pronounced as I had hoped. It finishes very very clean and doesn't linger at all. The alcohol isn't completely masked, but it doesn't detract from it. The body is a little fuller than most belgian strong pales, but the carbonation helps to lighten it up a bit and still gives it a pleasant mouthfeel. Overall, it's a good beer, but nothing fantastic."
"Light bodied, but not thin, with ample carbonation. An easy drinker, but didn't live up to my expectations as my first exposure to Russian River."
"The taste is nice fruity orange, tangerine, bitter earthy spices, bread, grass, tangy citrus bite that finishes soft, crisp, dry, and very spicy on the palate. This is a solid offering from Russian River I hope to have more access to some more of their stuff."
"D: A very nice Belgian pale. Found it more enjoyable as I drank it."
"The taste is lightly sweet at first, and then finishes bitter. It seems sweeter in the aroma than it is on the tongue. Great, complex flavor profile here. This is an excellent beer."
"A nice belgian pale ale. Not overly clovey or spiced. Spicing is nicely done and this beer would make for an ok session."
"Thanks to dbatch and our CA friend for hooking up a shipment of limited release Russian River to the east coast. 750ml bottle marked Batch 36. Pours a creamy gold color with a big soapy head, even with a slow pour, recedes steadily to leave a nice surface film and lacing. The aroma up front is an almost wine-like sweet fruit bouquet, behind that there was citrus and hops. The taste was quite complex, I was curious why the site listed this as a Belgian pale ale but the RR label showed Belgian golden ale, there are definitely characteristics of each. The fruits and spices from a golden ale are there, and the more than expected hops pushed it more towards the pale ale spectrum (although I would agree with the brewers this is a ""unique"" golden ale). It is bottle fermented for a little extra carb, but I found the mouthfeel to be fairly smooth with just a little bite, nice warm alcohol/hops aftertaste. I could definitely throw back a few of these if they weren't so hard to get where I am...very solid offering from the guys at RR."
"Overall a very good beer. Relatively mild nose and flavor. Smooth and dry, it's very pleasant and drinkable. I was hoping for a little more out of this one, but it's definitely worth a try."
"D - I don't quite know where to categorize this; to me it skews close to the ""Belgian IPA"" category. Either way, I consider it very drinkable. My first Russian River beer is not disappointing."
"Nice mouthfeel, nothing great, very drinkable, a bit sour...I like this but want to try others from this maker, not my favorite of this type, but good."
"D: very drinkable, but not completely dead-on for the style. this was my first RR experience, and I definitely enjoyed the brew. solid belgian style, but a still a little too much body for a golden ale."
"D - a good beer to try but it's not one i get excited about anymore."
"M + D: Quite smooth, and easy to take liberal sips of, not being a particularly high ABV. Carbonation is a little lacking, though not really 'flat.' A nice drink, leaving just a bit of warmth, especially towards the end of the glass."
"Poured a clear amber color with a fluffy off-white head with thick heavy lacing. The smell was typical of a strong pale. There were light fruits, apples and grapes with some sweet malt and honey. The taste was much of the same with a grassy hops presence that was a little overpowering. The balance between hops and fruity malts was not put together well. The mouthfeel was decent with good carbonation and definitely drinkable."
"I've had it in the bottle and on tap, but usually on tap."
"Rerate at tasting courtesy of Humulone_Red. Thanks! Perfectly gold colored pour with a white head. Smell is honey, and some malted wheat like sweetness for some reason. Taste is rich tart and sweet with some balancing hops and a belgian yeasty character. Hint of dusty funk in the finish. Overall, not stellar but good."
"A shiny holden orange body shows a lot of carbonation as it hosts a massive three finger off white rocky head. It leaves some scattered lace as it slowly fades. Nose is very soft and subtle with hints of yeast, raw wheat, deep citrus and sweet hops. As you tade first sip this brew has a wonderful spicey richness that is both creamy and bold. i am amazed at the fullness and balance of this beer for a golden ale. It really blows my expectations out of the water. nice even spicey sweetness has notes of cinnamon, pepper, and sweet dough. Mwllow phelonic tones are also carried throughout. A bit of hop presence is noticeable in the backround of this beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and ultimately refreshing. This is wonderfully drinkable."
"Overall: A tasty, well done beer, and one I enjoy quite a bit. Not exceptional in any particular way, but very good in most all ways."
"Cork-n-cage 750 ml bottle - batch 12. Brewed 6/1/06 with abbey ale yeast, and bottled on 6/27. Instead of conditioning with wine yeast like most batches of Damnation, they finished this one with the same abbey yeast. It pours a nice, solid gold hue and appears unfiltered, but it could just be some yeast particulates. The beer has adequate carbonation and is capped with three fingers of slowly-receding head that deposits lots of lacing. Sweet and toasted malts in the nose, sprinkled with flashes of orange, banana, and perhaps some pineapple. On the palate, it's the same toasted maltiness, along with grassy/spicy hops that impart a mild bitterness (25 IBUs). The beer has a slightly musty character, along with some yeast, a touch of clovey phenolics, apples and a late citric quality that imparts oranges and light lemon. Medium to full body, with tingly carbonation and a dry, lingering finish. This is a beer that is way too easy to drink and quite tasty, which is great for the palate, but at 9 bucks a bottle is a pain on the wallet. Although I haven't tried this beer fresh, I feel the aging has had a positive effect on this brew. Definitely a brew worth visiting and revisiting."
"Very worthwhile."
"The body is sweet up front but does dry out as you finish although probably could have finished a little bit more. The carbonation is a high even for style and accentuates some of the hop bitterness. The wine characteristics are nice and add a new characteristics. I do have a bottle and plan to age, but on tap this is a great beer."
"Bottle said this was actually 7.75% ABV, first time I have tried Russian River's staple beer, pretty much what I expected, recommended even though I think a lot of their other beers are better, would drink again, nice American twist on a Belgian ale"
"Damnation. The name basically sums it all up. This beer has all of the Duvel and Leffe components, but in a much more aggresively malted, hopped, and fermented way. It's basically amped up Pale Belgian. The difference here is that the balance remains firm and unwaivering. A very tart Belgian berry-like vineous (chardonay) flavor is balanced with big perfumy hop additions and a soft nectar-like quality-- kinda like you'd expect to find in a Mead. Then throw in some peppery spices, basic pilsner maltiness, and fresh tropical fruits (pineapples, apricots, mangos) and folks, we have a super complex beer. Quite dry and warm in the finish with a lingering numbing effect. Not that it's better than those beers metioned before, but it's a good choice if you want more strength with a similar profile, but don't want to sacrifice unnecessay fusals or phenols."
"Overall: Medium bodied beer that is way too complex to be this drinkable. This beer is dry but the hops really amplify that dryness. But I didn't notice anything bad about these hops, this was super clean all the way around. It has a great fresh hop character as well. I could have said much more about this beer if I wasn't enjoying it so much. They must have used a Saison yeast for this, but it covers a range far broader than Duvel to Dupont to Symposium, I loved 2004 Symposium, but this is far better in my book. Enjoy!"
"D: Not the most drinkable, as I really enjoyed the overall taste, I was really full after just a few sips."
"D: For me, this was a moderate-to-very drinkable ale. The alcohol was noticeable but not overpowering. The initial fruit notes were nicely offset by the hops. Almost too much for me, but I was able to finish her off without too much effort."
"I hope to try more Russian River beers in the future"
"Drinks easy, a nice American hop slant on the style that doesn't go too far. Complexity & the style slowed me down a bit. My highest rated beer this style"
"Very soft and mellow mouthfeel, with fluffy carbonation and a medium body. Extremely drinkable."
"This is an awesome brew! From the moment I poured it into my glass and saw the beautiful color and bountiful head I knew I was in for a treat. I would absolutely love to have another bottle of this stuff. Top notch."
"Taste is similar to the aroma. Spicy, peppery and herbal hops balanced well by a nice bready malt presence. The fruity yeast character shines through. Super well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy bodied with a fairly spicy dry finish. Carbonation is spot on. It's a hell of a beer, this one. I'm privileged to have tried it."
"Bottle from Coit Liquors in San Francisco. A glowing golden pout with a whiter-than-white rocky head. Banana and cloves in the aroma...am I describing a hefeweizen here? Sweet bubblegum flavour with honey and cinnamon. Good level of carbonation and a great body round off a solid brew."
"D- I don't think this is anything to rave about. A bit to strong on the bananas with no other fruit to balance it out."
"D: Insanely drinkable. The 750ml was no problem, need to get some of this out in NJ. This matched what I had hoped for and as a person not locked into the Belgian style, this is such a pleasure I may soon be more hooked on this- what a great representation."
"d: This was my first from Russian River and I very much look forward to more."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" bright white head above the effervescent, cloudy golden brew. Head escalades up and over the rim before settling over time. Lace is thick and coating. Aroma is pale malts and spices, which is replicated in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is oh-so smooth, and drinkability is tantalizing, always glad to revisit. This one hasn't lost much if anything in its later iterations. Try if you can."
"D: Great."
"Drinkability: dangerously drinkable. I ended up having two more immediately after tasting this one."
"Pours a slightly hazed gold with a white head. Yeasty nose - like a beautiful Belgian Pale is supposed to smell. Flavor is mild and smooth. Starts off mellow and sweet with a different than usual alcohol flavor to it. On the end I get an earthy flavor - no doubt from the yeast. Feel is slightly bubbly. Extremely drinkable."
"D  Would very easily become a staple in the cellar if easier to obtain."
"O: I think this may be the best Belgian style beer I've had. Certainly right up there with the Chimay Grand Reserve. The flavor is complex but easy to drink. The dryness leaves you wanted more. And for such strong flavor, the alcohol is really very reasonable. Lives up to expectations, a really good beer."
"On tap at the Toronado, in San Francisco. Golden straw colored, compact tight head with weepy lacing. Smells of pears, bananas, soft alcohol odor, wet straw. Flavor of dry pear juice, white grapes, dry animal hair, mild ethanol. Banana flavor grows as it warms. Sour cucumbery bite. Medium bodied. An excellent, exciting and ever-changing beer experience. RR can do nothing wrong in their wild ale lineup. So much delicacy in this beer. Room for error, but no error evident."
"Served from a 750ml bottle, split for two people. Poured with a very nice fluffy white head. Smelled some good fruity esters when I brought the glass to my nose. The ale tasted much drier than I had expected, but the malts left a creamy feel on my palate with subtle hop notes the entire time. The drinkability of this beer is very high as my friend and I ordered two more during the night. Overall: very smooth and rich, an excellent brew."
"Overall I thought this was really fantastic. My first real goodie from Russian River in a long time I can see why people pine over these the way they do, (well Pliny showed me that anyway) this was a fine example of both the brewery and the style. I would not hesitate to turn this one down if it were offered."
"Awesome yeast-driven esters. Nice alcohol bite. Subtle background british/czech hop flavors. Extra-fermentable turbinado sugar kick helps give this a very dry finish. Best commercial example of a Belgian-Style Strong Golden Ale brewed in the US. An excellent beer."
"This Belgian finishes clean. This is almost sessionable, very light but flavorful body. At 7%, the alcohol is not overly present in any way. Cheers to Vinnie for this wonderful brew!"
"750 ml cork and caged bottle, Batch 016. Pours a hazy, lemony-orange color with a fluffy white head. Darkens somewhat with addition of the yeast. Good stickage and retention. Pear-like in aroma with notes of hops and pale candi sugar. Light fruitiness and moderate sweetness followed up with a clean, dry finish. Excellent carbonation keeps it light and spritzy. The addition of the yeast provides a smoothing agent to the overall character of the beer. A stellar interpretation of the Belgian style."
"D - Not my favorite, but it is much better after it warms up some. I had to edit my original review as I like it much better on the second half."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a big yeasty white head. Aromas of a dry fruitiness, pears, apples, and hints of pinneapple, and a Belgian candy sugar. In the taste, yeasty and a sour fruity, and hints of a dry alcohol. A smooth, dry mouthfeel and a dry citrus and yeasty aftertaste. Fantastic representation of style, if not better than a Belgian."
"D- Fairly drinkable brew that tastes quite a bit better when it warms up. I made the mistake of starting off with it fairly cold and was disappointed but as it warmed I liked it more and more."
"This is my first Russian River brew, and needless to say I'm impressed and desiring more. My only complaint is that I wish there were just a touch of sweetness to it like the nose suggests. Nevertheless, very good brew that I'd be glad to have again."
"Russian River seems to have trouble putting out a bad beer. While this is about as common as Russian River beers get, it is still a world class beer. Recommended."
"D- not a harsh brew, tasty, interesting and delicious describe this beer best, definitely recommended"
"poured from a 750ml bottle batch number 012. golden, slightly hazy (just slightly) with a big fluffy white head that leaves a decent lace. smells wonderful with scents of candi sugar, pears, melon, a little banana some spice and some sweet biscuity malt that comes out a bit as it warms up. taste is beautiful too. the pear/melon taste in this one is like nothing else i've ever tried. almost like the taste of fruit in a really great sweet reisling. i'm really enjoying it. not quite as carbonated as other i've had in the style, which seems to give it a little fuller body than expected. still a real treat for me. too drinkable. i could sip on this beer day in and day out. thanks russian river. you are the cream of the crop."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and creamy, very nice sip over sip. The carbonation stays quite well. A very drinkable beer for the style."
"A great beer!"
"D: It's a sipper."
"Cork came out with a nice, solid 'pop'. Poured a slightly cloudy orange gold with a pretty big, white, foamy head. Looks nice in my goblet. Smell is sweet and mildly peppery with notes of sliced peaches, pears, and a touch of black pepper. Taste isn't as sweet, and actually, has some bitterness to it and is rather dry on the finish. This is a very good American attempt at this style. Were it available here, I'd certainly buy it."
"Smell is nothing to write home about either. Some wisps of grapefruit/lemon/citrus. Taste is delicious, mostly lemon, with some more sweet citrus balancing it out, a nice honey/lime aftertaste, and excellent mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Very nice beer from RR."
"Beer poured a golden color with a very strong fluffy white head that has sustained fairly well in my Duvel glass. Nose is very pleasant, of pears and apples. Taste is of sweet malts, hints of apple and pear, with a slightly peppery dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and extremely creamy. Overall drinkability is near perfect. The abv is well masked. This beer is right up there with Duvel!"
"Got from my buddy who shipped it back from the brewery. Batch 21. Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into my NBB snifter. It opened with a very loud pop. It was a clear golden color with a small carb fountain in the center. It had a good sized white head that settled into a constant thin film. The aroma was heavy on spices with fruit and malt in the back. Really liked the smell on this one. The spices reminded me of a saison. The taste was pretty good and had a good spicy bite but the alcohol was just a little too prevalent. Figured the spices would mask it more but was there in the aftertaste. Didn't kill it but kept the score down a .5 pt for me. Mouthfeel was good with right amount of carb. Overall, a rather enjoyable beer that I was glad I got to try. The BSPA style for me for now is one that I really have to be in the mood for to enjoy as opposed to a drink it anytime style. With that said, I wouldn't mind trying this one every so often. (3.5, RB-OAY, Y, O)"
"D: Very drinkable. It's smooth and crisp. The alcohol is not present in the taste nor in the aroma. A good attempt at the style but falls short of the best, although it's obviously going up against some very stiff competition."
"I did a side by side tasting with this and Damnation. They both had the same amber straw colored body with a bit of white head. The aroma on the Damnation has a bit more hop profile than the Redemption. There is also a good malt profile and a slight yeast funk. It has a good malty slightly sweet taste with good hop bitterness and some flavor as well. Perhaps slighly sweeter than the Redemption. Both are good beers though and I can't choose a favorite."
"Drinkability is high for the style. The alcohol factor is there but it doesn't make it hard to envision the further exploration of the lively flavors."
"D: Yes, an 'exceptional' version of a very likable style. A spot-on version of the best of the Belgians of thhis style, perfectly balancing malt, spice and dry hoppiness. I could drink this regularly. An excellent way to end a visit to the famed Toronado."
"Overall- I think it lives up to the hype! Definitely find this and spend an evening drinking it."
"D - Very drinkable. Very tasty."
"Last swigs: Reminds me a little of Orval with less leathery funk. Excellent drinker that is supreme with virtually any food. Less peppery than a Duvel."
"Thanks to drseamus for the trade!"
"It may not quite be up to snuff with Bos Keun or Duvel, but this here's a fine beer that deserves plenty of kudos. Probably the best American attempt at the style that I've ever had."
"Batch 012. It poured a hazy gold with orange highlights. The head was white, with a nice size until my hotel glass killed it. Yeasty bready smell with hints of orange peel and a little pepper spiciness. The taste starts out doughy with hints of pepper, lemon, and orange. The carbonation is perfect it really lets the flavors linger and mix on my tougue and then gives a dry refreshing finish. It is very drinkable, the driness makes me want more."
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a deep yellow/whitish color ale with a big foamy head with some great retention and some lacing. Aroma of pear is quite intense with some light spices and light candy  definitely not what I was expecting but very interesting and particular. Taste is dominated by the pear and even peach like taste with some subtle spice in the background and nice creamy texture. Body is above average with some low filtration and some adequate carbonation. A bit too much sweetness overall for my own taste but quite enjoyable nonetheless."
"Exceptional American brewed Belgian ale, definately one of the best. Complexity and drinkability make this a pure pleasure to drink."
"Cheers."
"Nicely carbonated, runs from creamy to a tad prickly. Very good drinker. I should of bought more of these when I saw them. Went down very easy on a warm afternoon."
"The pour seemed lightly darker this time... a slightly more rich gold color. Rocky frothy head is still fantastic. Fruity and very earthy belgian yeast nose. This batch should be very close to the 017."
"D - extremely drinkable, the 7.75 might catch up to you but not very quickly, or at least in my case. I love it."
"Poured into my Damnation tulip glass that I ordered avec beer. Lovely straw colored golden hue. Head was nice and full. Aroma - sweet belgian candi sugar. Taste and mouthfeel- creamy mouthfeel, with the belgian candi rolling off the tongue. Light and fruity- some white grape and subdued wood. Finishes dry with a hint of hops. Upon futher reflection, the finish is very dry with some booze present. There is a touch of sourness, but quite minimal. A very solid beer from a great American brewer."
"D: It seems that the name of the game with this beer is nuance, subtlety, and balance. This is so good it commands you to keep sipping it from the glass. What a fantastic beer!"
"Courtesy of Chris at Ebenezer's Pub. This was a 750ml bottle, Batch 020, poured into a tulip glass. Gold color with a medium sized head and a little lacing. A fruity aroma, mainly banana. Much more interesting taste. Banana, pear, and a citrus tang with some warming spice coming in later. Fairly substantial for a 7% ABV. This is a very good beer."
"D-pretty good I wish I had another bottle to share with my Easter dinner guests"
"From a 750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased from the Brewpub in Santa Rosa and consumed just two days later. So much for aging. Bottle conditioned so you have to decant it fairly carefully it poured a slightly hazy golden to orange color with a big foamy head that settled fairly fast and left moderate lacing. Nose is first banana, and then a swirl of the glass brings forth citrus, spices, and flowers. Mouthfeel is very smooth and the flavors mirror the nose, only a little more muted than you might expect. Finish shows a hint of the hops and brings a nice bitterness, and again the fruits come into play. A very good Belgian Ale and remarkably easy to drink."
"Overall, a good slant on a Belgian golden ale."
"D - quite tasty and one I'd have again!"
"All in all, great beer from Russian River."
"Drinkability is great, it's a very nice example of the style. And is fairly easy drinking for a 7% ABV beer. Yet another winner from Russian River."
"Drinkability - This is a very nice and drinkable beer. Nicely balanced sweet, but dry with a low enough ABV to make it session-able. If only I could find more."
"My best advice, if sharing with a friend, throw a little of the yeast into each other's glass. It really helps balance the flavor, IMO."
"D- This is my first Russian River beer and this brewery lives up to its impressive reputation. This is a very drinkable and smooth Belgium Strong Ale with a nice blend of citrus fruit, spices, and hops. Very pleasing aftertaste that is refreshing, but short. High carbonation is the only knock on this fine ale."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied, but with a light carbonation it almost comes off a bit lighter. Very smooth and easy to drink, but for me it's almost a little too fruity, otherwise this is a really good beer."
"D: This is my first beer from Russian River, and I'm definitely looking forward to my second. In a blind taste test, I don't think I'd guess it was a Belgian pale ale, as it leans a bit more toward the bitter/earthy/grassy saison camp. Not fully, mind you--it's not a saison, but it definitely has some saison-like characteristics. Nice beer."
"Of the Russian River beers I've tried, this is perhaps the least intriguing, but the most approachable. Good, solid stuff, but their reputation has preceded them in the way that I expect oddball, avant garde beers every time. Still, it's capital! Good to know that these folks can make a super solid drinkin' beer for the beer geek. I'd happily drink this again."
"Drinkability is quite good with a more modest ABV and smooth refreshment it offers."
"D: A pleasure to drink this. Excellent example of the style. Quite crisp and surprisingly easy drinking. Nice and complex with a decent body."
" As I suspected this is a great food beer I can just image a midday snack with some peppered crackers and aged cheese huh so good. Im so depressed; I cant get this stuff in Chicago looks like I might have to trade for a case. Needless to say this is an excellent Belgian style strong pale, if you can get it you will not be disappointed."
"Verdict: lived up to and exceeded my expecations. I really loved the as I put it in my notes ""tropical but not quite"" flavors of many different fruits, that were kept in check by the yeasty flavors. Outstanding."
"Cheers!"
"EDIT: I originally labelled the batch as 002 when it really is 011. It has been updated accordingly."
"Pours a clear golden, huge white head, nice lacing and excellent retention, what I like to see from a Belgian style. Smell is sweet, honey, yeast, citrus, very nice, lots of complexity. Taste is honey, toffee, bready yeast, spices, some vanilla, bit of funky goodness, nice clean finish. mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice shot at the style, enjoyed more than most Belgian Pales. Thanks for hooking us up Jay!"
"A very good Belgian golden here. I love the banana and peach flavors in it. Also, the carbonation isn't overkill, which was a pleasant surprise. Too often beers of this style have far too much carbonation which intereferes with tasting it properly. A recommended Belgian-style golden ale for sure!"
"Overall I'm reminded again of Duvel, this time because the taste seems to recall a wilder, freaky, inbred third cousin of that beer. It does seem to lack that certain something to push it over the top into the realms of the Belgian ales it aspires to (like a wilder yeast strain?), but it's still good stuff, and being my first Russian River beer, I'd easily buy more from these folks."
"Drinkability: Very sippable, despite the alcohol detection. Overall, a good go for my first-ever bottled RR brew. I've heard so much about Vince's ales, and considering this is the most readily available and, arguably, one of less favored of his offerings, I must say it's pretty darn impressive."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. I would certainly put it in the category with Orval. The flavor is mild and clean with a wealth of complexity deep within the beer, that certainly becomes more noticeable as it warms. I am enjoying this beer, and I would certainly try it again if I get the opportunity."
"Pours yellow golden color and I swear as it was coming out of the bottle there was a pink color to it like a blush wine. Small white head but it maintains nicely. It's bolstered by the steady flow of carbonation off the bottom of my Chimay glass. Smell and taste are full of apple. Very faint pepper taste that becomes more prominent as it warms. Very dry finish. From what I recall, not as bold and fruity as the other Russian River's I've had but certainly very enjoyable. A RR is always worth trying and I've never been disappointed. Have a Happy New Year!"
"bottle split with dirtylou on my 3rd stay in Mad Town"
"drinkability: high"
"Poured out a golden yellow, about 90% head at first, with a white chunky bubbly white head. mmm. Lacing like crazy, all over this house. The nose is malt and Belgian spice. A bit of citrus, even some hearty yeast. The taste had hops, alcohol, pine, yeast, spice, light fruit, malt, and honey. Has a slick mouthfeel with a very tiny prickly bubbly sensation."
"Nearly clear straw yellow colour with a dense white cap of foam. The fine bubbles clung to the glass, producing thick lace, and the head retention was quite good. The aroma was mostly sweet malts with notes of citrus, bread, and spice. Mild flavour with a low bitterness, spicy sweet malts and lemony citrus. Low carbonation, medium bodied, with a creamy texture. Very tasty, mellow, and very easy to drink."
"D - Delicious. Amazing. Could have this every day."
"drinkability is great. well balanced. this is a very interesting and tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, semi-sweet for the most part with a light, mild bitter bite at the end."
"Mouthfeel was full and rich, but the drinkability was hindered by the strangeness of the brew. I applaud the brewers' tenacity, but for me, the hoppiness and the Belgian sweetness did not mesh."
"Good beer, and interesting. Aggressively stylized, this is no Duvel copy."
"If you haven't tried this one, It's worth getting your hands on one."
"Music: Bette Middler. I'm not joking. I had ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" stuck in my head after hearing it on a TV show."
"Thanks to dogfooddog for sending this. I am very thrilled to have been able to try it, among other quality California brews."
"April"
"The smell is great, with a rich spiciness and some cedar and a trace of hops. The taste is also nicet, with a banana flavor stepping forward as it warms. Unfortunately, the taste score was affected by the fact the hops are too prevalent, especially for the style. A little more time in the bottle wouldn't hurt, but it's a fine tasting beer with a pleasant but unremarkable mouthfeel. Drinkable, certainly, but won't find it's way onto my desert island list."
"Drinkability - Went down really nice. If somebody else was buying, I would have another bottle, but at $13 (bar price), I'll go home content that I got to sample another excellent beer from Vinnie at RR."
"Drinkability: I doubt I'd reach for this again anytime soon, as I had a hard time getting fired up about this beer."
"Mouthfeel was active. A zesty, foamy champagne-like texture. However, it was not too much, it was just right."
"Polished brass. Pillowy, tall eggshell colored foam that splotches the glass with big bubbled lace and curtains of fine veils. Rushing lane of fine bubbled carbonation. Fruity aromas of pear, washed cloves, lemon pith, and a splash of alcohol as well as a touch of fresh honey. Sweet honey glazed banana slices as well as some pear flesh leads into a light clove, candied orange peel, and pepper finish. Possessing that fine bubbled RR carbonation, this is a touch sweet up front before drying out a bit in the finish. The spiciness accumulates on the tongue before rushing down the throat all at once, but still remains smooth. Medium bodied with a nice lightness to it, the honey sweetness is not at all cloying. I was surprised that this had not dried out more over the last 18 months."
"I am wondering if prehaps the tap was a bit off and i didnt get a good sample of the beer. A very mediocre offering from a great brewery, i was dissapointed in this."
"($6.50 / Pint)"
"Very complex but hard for me to describe...a perfect belgium."
"this is my frist experience with russian river. definitly won't be the last."
"D- This beer has the complexity flavors of a Strong Pale Ale with a lot of dry notes. The hops are really kicked up but they are well blended with the other flavors in the beer. It would be nice to taste a bit more sweetness to balance the hops and give it more depth in the malts. Perhaps that is why they call this Damnation and not Salvation."
"-Oelergud"
"Very solid beer all around. Great American example of a Belgian style beer. I was hoping to score some Pliny while out here in NorCal, but it looks like Damnation is all the RRBC I'm going to get. This brew certainly did not disappoint."
"I noted a little demerit for mouthfeel, something about astringency? Drinkability is quite good, I could go for a few pints of this."
"Pours a deep golden color with a foamy white head that doesnt seem to want to die. Lots of fruit in the nose along with a good amount of spicy yeast. Taste begins lightly sweet with fruity notes of banana and apple followed by yeasty bread dough and spice and a bit of citrusy hops in a dry finish. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Overall, very tasty. I liked this quite a bit."
"Flavor was overly sweet while it was still cold from the refrigerator. Other flavors such a a citrus and something akin to bananas came out ever more pronounced as the beer warmed. The carbonation made this a lsightly heady beer. Rathe full-ish body for the style that was very palate broadening. Very nice and glad I chose to try this beer."
"Batch 007. Not shaken or stirred. This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a large head if not poured correctly. The smell is sweet, much like a tripel with the same spices and a good bit of carbonation. The taste is a bit awkward... much like a tripel with the same spices and carbonation, but there seems to be a lack of body which makes it hard to really get a grasp on. Another of my beer drinking buddies called it ""simple," but I think that there is a lack of body. The mouthfeel is great, simply because there is nothing to really get a grasp on."
"Highly carbonated, light mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"Fairly drinkable, although towards the end of the bottle i was starting to get a bit sick of it."
"Drinkability: Well, I finished off 750ml by my self... and I can see myself doing it again. Very drinkable, very desirable."
"Extremly drinkable as long as you haven't killed your pallate with a pliny the elder."
"Mouthfeel is fairly heavy and full bodied, a good Belgium style beer, not my favorite style, a little too heavy and sweet for me to drink a lot, but a quality beer."
"Heckuva beer. Golden body with a soft white head. Based on other beers of the style (Duvel really comes to mind with this beer) the head could be rockier or at least have a little better retention. Smells slightly sweet with corriander spice and a touch of fruit. A nice complex flavor for a 7% beer. Pear and apple fruit flavors, with a somewhat earthy and spicey mellow hop bitterness and a nice side of belgian spice. Great mouthfeel with all those tiny bubbles. I could drink this all night and maybe the next morning. Just don't let it warm up too much, this is really in its prime around 50 degrees."
"Overall, perhaps the Belgian style ale that showed me that I could enjoy Belgian styles. I will definitely be experimenting further with this style and well as with Russian River."
"Gold hazy color  white medium head -nose yeast, green apple, bright - yeast, sour apple  champagne body  aftertaste slightly bitter, yeast Gold hazy color  white medium head -nose yeast, green apple, bright - yeast, sour apple  champagne body  aftertaste slightly bitter, yeast"
"A word of warning: there was some serious, chunky sediment in the bottom of the bottle that I ineptly dumped into my glass and then somewhat unsuccessfully attempted to fish out."
"The drinkability should be higher, but the muddled astringency on the finish makes it less pleasant then it could be."
"D: Not bad. Never really been into the ""earthy hops"" (dirty bitterness). I think it detracts from the beer and pulls you out of the moment."
"It is a very drinkable beer, and although I was going to buy more online, I was given more bottles for my birthday from a good friend who had learned of the beer through me."
"Batch 011. Bright and pale hazy orange with a solid three-qurter inch fluffy head. Very beautiful, the retention is nice. The aroma is mildly strong, with an orange and lemon citrus nose. There is a hint of light spice and a touch of smoke also. The flavor is quite citrusy and a bit dry. The malt carries an light breadiness paired with a nice sour bite and the finish has a subtle peppery tang. The alcohol is well-hidden here. Mouthfeel is foamy and silky, medium thick, good carbonation. The first few sips were decent but the beer kept getting better and I was wishing I had another bottle afterwards. Highly recommended..."
"D - Good stuff. I drink another if I had a bottle."
"This beer also has serious dregs- the bottom was yeast city- a plus for dregheads!"
"Wow, this was an impressive beer! I'm certainly glad I picked this up. I'm not sure if its awesomeness was due to the aging it underwent or not, but I would definitely like to try a fresh sample to compare. Highly recommended!"
"D: I liked this one much better when I had it on-tap at the brewery, but this is still a very good beer any way that you serve it."
"Bottom line: This is my 2nd review of a RR Damnation(first was from batch 007) and this one is even *more* impressive. It's an amazing beer from an amazing brewery!!"
"This is the second RR brew I've had, after Pliny the Elder. This is one of the best beers in its style. I can't wait to try more of their brews. Too bad they're thousands of miles away from our home in Florida."
"Drinkability is decent. Finish is crisp, clean, and dry lending to higher drinkability."
"Cloudy yellow with a little head. Lace. Yeasty aroma, not substantive. Aggressive carbonation. Taste is delicate zesty yeasty, tad of grain, crisp, and satisfying.Moderate bitter aftertaste. No sign of alcohol. 6 ounces at Mondial 2006. Had a bottle brought by Dr.Jay six months later."
"D - Very drinkable. I love this brew, very very tasty. Russian River is pretty hard to come buy in UT though, LOL By the way this is my first RR."
"Very nice, deep golden color with a huge, fluffy white head on top. Talk about a Duvel clone! Sulfury and grainy aroma-peppery and somewhat spicey. Big, crisp, yeasty flavor. Full of malt with a nice mellow bitterness. Somewhat phenolic. Again with the grain and sulfury notes-this time flavorwise. Nice, full, bright mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. I really like the sulfury and grainy character of this one."
"As much as I liked the nose and palate I am thrilled at how easy this beer is to drink! Damn enjoyable. Sometimes Duvel-type beers bore me. I foolishly waited to drink this beer. I assumed it would be dull. Why didnt I have more faith in RR? What a mistake. I loved this beer. I would love to drink it on-tap and lots of it. On the surface it is simple and pleasant but once analyzed it is complex and delicious! This is a great beer. I am happy I purchased a bottle online from RR, it was worth every cent. I highly recommended. Why did I wait so long to drink this gem!"
"The beer poured a dark, hazy gold with a fluffy white head that leaves a clunky lace on the side of the glass. The nose brings biscuit malt, bread dough, lemon citrus, and a bit of green apple. The flavor is more intense. Sweetness from the malt lends hard candy, the green apple, and a touch of the biscuit. The hops come across mid-quaff with more citrus, but its in the form of orange. The green apple comes back in the finish and is accompanied by a tartness/mild bitterness that lasts. The mouth feel is slick and light. The beer is very drinkable. I was wowed by my first Duval, and became somewhat ambivalent to the beer after that. This beer re-ignited my passion for this style."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Not something I could drink all night since the 7% alcohol would have me on the floor. Actually, this beer seems to be even stronger than its alcohol content suggest. Not a bad thing, just interesting."
"A nice balance overall, a tad sweet and spicy at times, the alcohol un-leashes as the ale warms. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel with a fizzy tang to it, easy to consume yet filling. This ale seems a bit stronger than it's listed ABV of 7%, so drink with care...cheers !"
"This is a good tasting and very drinkable beer, but I don't know that it is worth the price."
"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived with a bit of head and cloudy golden color. Aroma is pretty good, cloves and toasty malts and a twinge of lemon. Taste... holy mother of... lots of it. Malts and cloves and floral hops and banana and spices make this pretty intense, almost out of control, but pretty good. Can sense the alcohol in there, good body, good beer, though not my favorite from here for whatever reason"
"Awe inspiring drinkability is in my glass here, makes Dom Perignon taste like rotted grape juice. I could see drinking this all the time if it was more available, but even in California you can only get this when you see it. Well Hennepin and Duvel are almost as good; a lie I can believe after a few weeks of convincing myself."
"thought it was decent in the bottle, but the sweetness and over-the-top coriander just blow it here"
"Warmth and zest brings up the finish, with clove and pepper on the exhale."
"Pours a beautiful deep straw color and wears a very thick and fluffy marshmallow colored crown. Aromatics are a combination of strong bread yeast, crisp malts, lemony twang & coriander spice. Flavors of tart citrus fruit, spicy coriander, clean hoppy bittering, lightly sweetened bready malted finish. Smooth and creamy texture on the palate, silky carbonation, and has a dry ending. This is one fine ale that I will not tire of any time soon, very drinkable. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
"It started damned pretty, and I enjoyed it, a lot, to the final drop. It's an interesting twist on a longstanding style, and the personality it exuded kept my attention the entire pint. While the ABV is just enough to demand respect, it was never an issue, and the drinkability is refreshingly high. This is one beer I would gladly pass over others in order to get to for a return engagement. This is the reason I keep a clean, empty growler in my car."
"Draught @ Hollingshead in Orange, California. Light dark straw, bordering on orange with a large, frothy and lasting head of foam. An aroma of papaya mostly, with other hints of banana and pear, along with some funky yeast notes and hints of salty pizza dough. Big, doughy, fruity malt flavor with hints of tart passion fruits and grassy and earthy hops. A pretty tasty beer."
"Can't wait to try it from the bottle!"
"This is unquestionably good beer from what is clearly a world-class brewer. I can't wait to try whatever other Russian River offerings I can lay my hands on. Damnation's only 'fault' is that it doesn't fit my preferred profile for a BSPA. Make no mistake, though, it's a very nice domestic version of a sometimes hard to duplicate style. Authentic and enjoyable."
"begins to mellow as i make my way through the 750 (hey, it takes a while), but still a pleasure."
"Poured a cloudy, yellow-orange color with rust highlights and a moderate level of carbonation with big bubbles. A nice thick, white-colored head devleoped and left behind loads of lacing. Aromas of honey, yeast, grains, and dried fruit came out nicely. A bitter taste with fruity tones; dried apricot, pears, mellon, and white grapes. Rich and fruity with a sweet finish that is long and mellow. Highly addictive with a creamy texture that just rolls into your mouth and leaves behind intense flavors. This is a wonderful beer; one of the best examples of its style and well worth the $10 I paid for the bottle."
"Nice drinking brew, as I expected it would be."
"Batch 003, served from a 750 ml bottle. When I took the cage off the bottles, the cork flew out of the bottle neck without any agitation. Nice presentation. The beer poured a golden yellow color with a thick white head, good lacing. The beer had an aroma of of citrus and bananas, a bit acidic. The taste is a good balance of spice, citrus and carbonation. As with most RR beers, there is a good balance in the beer so that the higher ABV is not overally noticable."
" Tastes very good, some yeasty notes, along with the flavors noted in the aroma. Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated and smooth. Drinkability is high, if only I could buy this in IN."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable. Unique, interesting, and enjoyable. A nice American take on a Belgian style."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing this bottle. Batch 003: Lightly hazy straw color with a medium thick off-white head that dissipates quickly. Small particles floating freely, and thin sheets of lacing. The aroma is potent fruit (banana and melon) and yeast. Medium-bodied and tart with fruit and peppery spices, along with some hops and malt. The finish is spicy and short with a lingering sweet aftertaste of banana and clove. Very drinkable, and the cacophany of flavors seem to be on the verge of chaos. However, the complexity is restrained enough to be rather enjoyable."
"Music: Motörhead  Iron Fist."
"I'm really not sure that I like this beer as much as I had been anticipating, but give it a shot and see if RR lives up to the hype for you."
"This is a kick ass brew. With every drink this beer got better, that is a testament to a fine offering."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to BigLove for finding this brew for the Secret Pumpkin '05. This is the last brew of 2005, and I had to end it with fireworks, so what better than one of the highest regarded beers on BA? Cheers to the Russian River crowd for making a beer that sticks to style and yet goes far beyond and puts its own stamp on it. Very nice, and hopefully I can get my hands on much more Russian River, including this one, in the future!!!!"
"Great Mouthfeel and drinkability. My first RR product and most certainly not my last!"
"Batch 004. Special thanks to Brewbacca for the trade."
"750 ml corked and caged. Batch 006. Pours a pale golden color, slightly cloudy. High amount of carbonation. Thick, fluffy egg-white like head. Good head retention. Aroma of apples, pears, and some spices. A very nice fruity aroma. Pale malt flavor, followed by fruit flavor and ending with a good amount of earthy, Belgian-like hop flavor. Bitterness is not overwhelming, but certainly present. Higher carbonation makes this pretty refreshing. Alcohol is not very noticable. Thank you to EyeChartBrew for bringing this one to me."
"Nice 2cm cover of pure white lace, regular bubbles covering a cloudy pale gold pour. Spicy and slightly phenolic nose has a mild hay-like propensy, its dry yeastiness offering plenty of tea-like tannins and candied fruits (pineapple, sprucey orange skins etc.), like a less nutty chardonnay. Even for a belgian ale, it is pretty spicy, though balanced and youd have a hard time picking dominant tastes. Certainly herbal, honey geared malts, tannic and yeasty. Medium carbonation, medium bodied, slight astringency. Quality, friendly and accurate artisanal farmy belgian ale, if not managing the extra steps to scar our imaginary world."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head. The head fades very slowly leaving a lot of thick laces. Lots of tiny bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Looks quite carbonated. It smells citrusy. I can detect slight spicy aroma, and a slight hop aroma. The alcohol is not too noticable in the aroma. This beer also has a yeasty aroma. This beer has a spicy, peppery taste. It tastes slightly fruity. Maybe plumbs or pears. I can taste a small hop presence. I can not detect the alcohol in the flavoe. I really like how this beer hides the alcohol. This beer is quite carbonated. The carbonation does not detract from the beer at all. This beer leaves a spicy, citrusy aftertaste. It goes down smooth. I think that this beer might make a good session beer, but you would do well to be carefull because it is a little high in alcohol. I highly recomend this beer."
"Taste: Citrus and a whole slew of yeast flavors that ranged from cloves to banana and from nutmeg to all-spice. And plenty of booze."
"Props go out to the Blind Tiger for getting some on this here coast."
" anyways i still love Russian River, my favorite localish brewery. i'm just telling you, that i'm saving my money for their other brews...or a karmeliet"
"Overall: My first taste of the ""-tion"" Russian River beers, and definitely a keeper. I'm not sure I'd say it's worth the high sticker price when there are tons of good beers in this style for much less money, but it's worth trying."
"This is a very engaging Belgian Golden Ale that is masterfully constructed. No hint of the 7% abv to be found. Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a earthy, yet fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes earthy with a slight lemony zest. This is quite dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine Belgian style brew. It has a smooth and tastey flavor; a good drinker."
"Drinkability is good a nice brew, not my favorite style but enjoyed this one. Probably wouldn't have again due to the cost but it is good."
"Appearance is spot on. Large fluffy head (not quite Duvelesque, but what is?) on a hazy yellow beer. Smell is very fruity and sweet. Some spiciness in there as well as a subtle metallic aroma. Taste is more spicy than it seems. Very reminiscent of wheat beer clovey spiciness, and the banana does show up as well. Also some cantaloupe sweetness which is very tasty - a little bubble gummy as well. Very complex without being overbearing or particularly ""strong"" tasting, which I like. The metal doesn't show up in the taste thankfully. Mouthfeel is very light and very spritzy. I had to make myself slow down drinking this one. Went very well with Mexican food. Now if only I could get another bottle..."
"It just couldn't fully win me over. Solid, be glad to have another and probably will."
"Notes: Not bad, but too bitter for me."
"Overall: Belgian Strong Pale Ale's are one of my favorites. Damnation doesn't disappoint. An extremely drinkable and thirst quenching. 7% abv will creep up very fast. A fine representation. Go out and seek and enjoy. One I will buy again with pleasure."
"Taste: sweet malt dryed by spicy hops with a earthy yeasty bite .Smooth mouthfeel with plenty of alcohol and a soft carbonation makes this a great belgian strong"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Drinkability: As good -- if not better -- than the benchmark Duvel. About as good as a BSPA gets, wonderful. This is the first of RR's bottled products I've tried and, if this is any indication, I think their future looks very bright indeed."
"Wicked."
"sure, its not bleeding with smokiness or plum rinds, but it is pretty much flawless in its presentation of a fabled, old style. i personally prefer the wild ales and experimental stuff from russian river, but there is no way to avoid giving this cool daddy his due."
"This was my first Russian River, and if I can help it, it wont be the last."
"D - This is a pleasant and easy drinking beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a well placed carbonation that does not overdo it. A truly satisfying, fruity Belgian golden ale. I'm glad this came in a 750ml bottle as I am struggling not to gulp it down. Another yummy creation from Russian River. Thanks to wezil for the opportunity...now I must go buy more!"
"A very approachable beer. A lot like their Redemption except with some more bitterness in it."
"Pours a hazy, pale straw colour, with a fluffy white head, great retention. Thick, syrupy and sweet. Some pineapple, lemon and zest in the aroma. Taste was very sweet, fruity and floral. Somewhat tangy and spicy. Medium bodied and great drinkability. Finishes a tad bitter and dry. Wonderful beer. Russian River can do no wrong."
"Damnation has a creamy mouthfeel. Good carbonation, very lively. Nice malty finish. HIh drinkability, refreshing and complex. This is my first Russian River brew and I am looking forward to acquiring more."
"Overall: Very solid brew here and well executed within the style."
"High carbonation lends to this beer's drinkability. Nothing too bold or amazing, just a typically fine-crafted brew from one of the world's best."
"This is a very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Bright flavors, tart, tingly, yeasty, spicy, this has alot going on."
"Pours a delicate-looking bright golden-caramel in color. Tight layer of white head perched atop. Nice lacing of the glass. Aromas are yeasty/doughy, along with bannanas, clove, and peppery spice. Flavor is lighter than expected, but still good. More of the bready yeast flavors soaked in estery fruit juice. Balanced nicely by a snappy hop-bitterness at the end. Very clean finish on the palate, with no lingering aftertaste. Well-hidden ABV only adds to the enjoyment. A very nice first try of the much-hyped (and well deserved) RRBC. More of this will be purchased."
"Decent flavors but filling and highly carbonated."
"SECOND EDIT: Two days later, I had left about 1/3 of the 750 sitting in my fridge- not sure why, I didn't really want to finish it, but I didn't want to be unnecessarily harsh in my review either. So I poured the rest in a glass, yeast and all, and tried again. Now that it has ""aged"" a bit, and it includes the yeast, I get a solid banana-pineapple-clove nose, and the peppery-dry sharpness has mellowed a bit, but it still dominates. Still not something I am real excited about, but I did up the ratings somewhat."
"Pours a nice bright and hazy straw color with a 2 finger head that falls back to a finger leaving sticky tendrils of lace on the glass. Nose is really nice. Lots of lemony zest upfront, but also with an almost black peppery spice as well. With a very big inhale, I find the last 0.75 of the inhale to change character and give me light alcohol-innoculated banana. Very nice. The flavor is not as complex as the aroma. It starts with a crisp lemon, slightly spicey follows finishing with a light sweetness, but very dry. It really hits me on the back of the tongue with the dryness. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. No real hint of the alcohol except when I take the deep breath. Good beer. A treat for my senses."
"Thanks to Jason Alstrom for this bottle. Shared with fellow BAs Sheepnutz and kmpitz2. Pours a cloudy yellow/golden color with a tall head that falls at a medium rate and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of lemony-citrus stuff going on with some spicing, some corriander and maybe a hint of funk. That funk is present in the flavor, almost has a musty funk going on - but in a very good way. Citrus and spice and some earthy hops. I really like the flavor, but it's different than most Belgian Pales. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and the drinkability is very good."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium gold color with three fingers of head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell is fruity and sweet, with lots of pepper and citrus aromas. A very pleasant aroma. The taste is tart at first, with some sweet and sour flavors. It's slightly bready and spicy as well. The finish has some hop bitterness, brilliant. The mouthfeel is decently thick and smooth. The drinkability is great, since it's fairly low in alcohol for a Belgian Strong Pale. Hats off to Chris for sharing this beer, what a good lad!"
"Overall, a good offering in every sense of the word. It's not amazing, but I could see myself downing a chalice or two were I ever in CA. That said, I can't wait until I get to the other two RR beers I have hidden."
"750 ml. This is the most authentic Belgian golden that you can possibly find in the USA made by a USA brewery. Sparkling yellow, with a nice white head. Aroma of banana and clove, along with the pale malts. Flaors are malty, with the dominance of pale malts and a pleasant fruity palate. Fruity finish. Light and enjoyable, perhaps the best Belgian golden that I have had..."
"Drinkable  This was a very drinkable BSPA that delivered on all the usual requirements."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. $9.29 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA (thanks Mike W). The most appropriate beer for today since the H392 got set aside today in NC and will not be looked at for awhile longer. Damnation!"
"Drinkability is extremely high. Really a thirst quenching lighter Belgian and amazingly crafted for sure."
"Drinkability: uh, yeah, it's damnably drinkable! I gotta say, I could drink this all night, given the opportunity. Russian River scores again with Damnation. Well worth whatever it takes to get a bottle."
"Thanks go out to THE longbeachbum for the sample."
"817"
"This is enjoyable, highly drinkable stuff."
"Drinkability is excellent for the style, there are not many American Golden Ales that even come close to this."
"Damn. I want more of this beer. A lot more. I'm very pleased that an American brewery has produced a BSPA of this caliber *and* originality. Kudos to Vinnie. I shall continue to give him my money..."
"Dark golden with a nice duvel-style head of white foam. The aromas are all Belgian golden with nice spicy yeast and alcohol notes as well as some french bread malts and some spicy hops. Taste is like the aroma implies. Spicy and hoppy with a nice background malting and many subtle flavor complexities. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is very good. As far as Belgian goldens go, this one really does it for me. I'd like to try this again from the bottle. Good stuff. $2.50 for a big chalice at the Toronado ;-)"
"Drinkability- Quenched my thirst while cleaning and washing our car. Very good effort at creating a Belgian style brew. I'd definitely snag a few more if they come down to my neck of the woods."
"Overall impression: Definitely reminescent of Duvel - this is a tasty example from a great American brewer. Clean, crisp and highly drinkable - if you can get your hands on a sample give it a try."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer that I will look for again. I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of it."
"I am sampling a corked and caged 750 ml bottle. Pouring into a snifter at room temp. The beer pours a clear bright gold color similar to champagne. A fizzy fluffy bleached white head of 2cm foams up easily. Streams of bubbles rise effortlessly to the surface. Aroma is a mix of piney hops, lemon and biscuit, intertwined with green apple and white grape. First sip reveals a lite body and texture with small fizzy carbonation. Flavor is green apple and pears with lemon and some nutmeg and bready yeast. Very smooth and easy to drink. No hint of the 7% abv anywhere."
"Seek one out today..."
"Never trust a book by its cover should be the mantra of BA and this is a classic example. Beautiful big brown bottle with champagne caged cork and batch 001. As I opened the bottle the cork was ready to fly off - nice pop and a beautiful looking pale golden cloudy brew. This is where the story takes a downturn. It doesn't exactly suck but not fit the style or presentation. Crisp, yeasty but imbalanced. I hope the brewers read this and retool for batch 002."
"Had this at a wet hop tasting at RFDs in Washington DC. This came out with a yellow body with good clarity and a slight topping of white foam. The aroma is a mix of fruits like apples and various spices. A doughy malt can be slightly detected in the background. Taste is similar with a spicy doughy malt before a bit of sweetness and more spice leads to the mildly bitter finish. Also there are plenty of fruit notes in the flavor as well. Body is about medium with a good carbonated feel to it. Pretty good drinkability as well. Pretty good offering from Russian River I am glad they brought this to the tasting."
"Sampled on tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. In the glass, this brew is a cloudy, but bright amber with a full & creamy white head. Nose is an enticing blend of apricot, herbal spices, sour apple, & coriander (although sampled in the same session as Horny Devil, the coriander in this brew seems almost non-existent). Enjoyable blend of sweet fruits and mild spicy hops. More subtle hints of sour apple throughout along with some drying woodiness. Medium-bodied brew with perfect carbonation & a gentle warming as it closes. Damn, I'd like to have this on tap nearby."
"Pours a hazy deep straw color and is topped by a creamy off-white head. This has a spicy aroma that has notes of apple. The nose is both fruity and dry at the same time. Paradoxally the taste is dry but sweet in the finish (usually this is found in the reverse order in most beers). This has a very nice herbal character in the finish. The front and middle of this beer evokes notes of apple. This goes down quite well, with a bit of astringency in the finish that balances the fruitier components of this beer quite well."
"This ale poured a cloudy, golden color with thin white foam that settled. The smell was modest: a slightly sweet, mellow, vinous aroma. The taste was lightly sweet with notes of sugar. There was a vinous quality to the malty taste. It was lightly fruity with mild hop presence in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, fruity and lightly sweet, with medium body and low carbonation. This was a pleasant ale."
"A special treat as I had the current batch and the one year old batch, rare to get a two release sampling. The beer pours a clear gold to amber color with the head white and modest in size, the texture creamy with the resultant lace a slender skirt to seal of the glass. Nose is sweet and crisp with a bit of yeast, hints of coriander and peaches; nice blend of aromas, start is lightly sweet, nice grain profile with the top fair to middling in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops perfect, the ABV gives a snappy end to the beer, dry and lingering aftertaste."
"Had this one on tap at O'Briens and what an amazing beer this was. It poured a nice medium gold color with a little lace that stuck to my glass all the way down. The smell was quite spicy with a clove scent as well. The taste was wonderful. Bananna, yeast and a slight peppery flavor were quite dominant. This beer reminded me of a very strong hefeweizen. Very drinkable indeed, try it if you see it."
"The banana flavors come out strong in both the smell and taste. The smell is very nice and powerful. The taste is pretty good too. If there's any weakness, it's a fairly sharp and almost acidic mouthfeel. It still remains easy to drink, however."
"I'm trying real hard guys, I really am. This belgian style ale was had at the fun Russian River pub. This beer poured a cloudy pale gold, head was pure white and retained well, lacing was good. Banana notes dominated the aroma and taste profiles, the usual yeasty characteristics were also present. This Belgian strong golden checks in at 7% I'm glad I tried it, upset I didn't like it. I would like nothing more to report one day that I had found one I do like. Suzanne liked it though! I almost fell off my stool. I'll bet most if not all lovers of Belgians will like it, seems well made."
"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly yeasty. A medium bodied Belgian ale. Flavors are fruity, orange and citrus. Very clean. Hides the 8% alcohol very well. Yeasty, malty and citrusy. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
