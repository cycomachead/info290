"I find this beer very enjoyable, but I'm also aware that it's not heavily hop-forward, bitter or anything else some like in their pale ales, even stronger ones."

"Aroma is yeast malt,  hop and a little spice. Appearance has a small but long-lasting off-white head, some lacing and a slightly hazy orange amber color. Flavor is like aroma plus has some malt and fruit sweetness with plenty of hop bitterness but there are some medicinal qualities to the aftertaste. Body is good with just a touch softness. Overall it's pretty good beer except for that medicinal thing"

"Nice yeasty floral aroma, rich golden color with small soapy head. Taste come sin with malt, yeast, and a touch of vinegar acidity. Some wine like aroma and taste to this."

"O: A very flavorful, balanced, and authentic Belgian-style strong pale ale. I have no clue why I waited so long to try this one."
""
"Overall, a very solid belgian-style golden that is a bit too spicy and boozy for its own good. Some age could probably mellow this one out, and hopefully bring out some of the more subtle fruit notes lurking below the surface of the more assertive characters in this beer."

"Overall: I’ve enjoyed this beer more times than I can count, on tap or bottled. It’s always a favorite, never disappointed. Accurate as a Belgian golden, but never boring for the palate!"

"O - No where near Belgian enough. I have had had homebrew better than this. Avoid"
""
""
""
""

"This pours a semi-cloudy golden yellow color with a slight off-white head containing floaties. The aroma is inviting with a mixture of banana and yeast. The taste is smooth with citrus and bready tones. The characteristics are very true to the Belgian style. This is interesting, well made, and easy to drink."

"Overall: A good take on the style, but seemed to be a tad sweeter than most. I still enjoyed the beer and would grab another anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the biggest fan of gold ales, but this is very good for the style. Highly suggested."
""
""

"A good beer, I just wish it tasted as good as it smelled."

"This is a pretty nice beer, but the alcohol is a bit intense. There are nice fruity notes from the yeast which I really like, the malt is semisweet with hints of caramel and sugar which I also like, but unfortunately the alcohol is heavy enough to mask some of the finer nuances. An overall solid beer, but one that may need cellared before it reaches its prime."
""
""
""

"Overall - I finished it, but it didn't seem worth finishing. Too alcoholic, even at 9%."

"MF – Light body, sharp mouth feel from good carbonation, with a slight smoothness/creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty solid, and for $8, this is a decent buy. I'll get it again for buddies who are entering the Belgian realm."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste has more depth than the aroma with many of the same characters and a kind of licorice flavor in the background to boot. Low to moderate bitterness at the end. I enjoyed this."
""
"Salvation to my knowledge is only seen rarely here in sepa so a chance to bag it was a big goal and to my satasfaction was worthy."
""
""
"Overall – A pretty decent Belgian golden strong with a good deal of breadiness, not too much sweetness and a fairly nice creamy feel. One that is certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Looks nice, has a vibrant smell, and tastes like it should."
"O: Very authentic Belgian taste, with a heavy alcohol bite, and a bottle that looks like something from a Medieval art history class. Really enoying this one."
""
""
"a little tart, a little thin, but overall a great brew and it hides the alcohol well. not that hiding it is the goal, but that it is behind some of the other flavors and not prevalent."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid version of a Belgian Pale Ale. Has a good mix of fruit esters."
""
""
""
"I'd say a must for any *Belgian Golden Ale* lover."
"Overall. Middle of the road. Not smooth enough to rate as top off class Belgian Strong Ale. A good warmer though. Smell was unique in a good way. Too thick and biscuity for my taste."
""
""
"Pours dirty golden with a white head. Both the aroma and flavor are dominated by the Belgian yeast, floral, banana, and spices. Also present is some lemon. The yeast is way too strong in this one for me, I did not like it. An active, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, not a balanced brew for me. Less yeast, please,."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed the complex taste of this beer. Although this is a beer that you need to slowly sip, the alcohol isn't too noticeable in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a sick beer, I'm glad I scored it."
""
""
"It's not very complex, but it is delicious. It's just yeasty and alcoholic enough to make the citrus flavour delicious. Despite the strength, it would be a good summer beer. If it's nighttime. It's not much fun in the winter, though."
""
"If you are a fan of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style Avery Salvation Golden Ale is sure worth a try! – I am glad I did."
""
"O-This beer is not bad by any means, (the slight off flavor I mentioned is very slight), but I just couldn't ""get into it."" Perhaps in a beer style such as this one, in which there are hundreds of great beers, Salvation just did not stack up."
""
""
"Very nice, sipper of a beer."
"Definitely a sipper. I was nervous when I read on the side that it had nutmeg and cinnamon but was glad when I didn’t detect it (not a huge fan). However, I wish they would have masked the alcohol better and I wish the smell wasn’t so overpowered from the apricot. Eh. There has to be a better representation of this style."
"OVERALL: While this is not as complex as some other Belgian-Style Pale Ales it is nicely balanced and would make the perfect gateway for a Coors Light drinkin' buddy. While it will not offend anyone, it is full of flavor and very easy drinking."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 7/28/2011. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pear, peach, biscuit, nuttiness, pepper, herbal, earth, floral, honey, clove, light banana, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of pear, peach, biscuit, nuttiness, pepper, herbal, floral, earth, honey, light clove, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, earth, honey, clove, and light yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Very well balanced flavors with nice complexity; no cloying sweetness at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong golden ale. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; extremely smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one. Avery does a really nice job on many of their Belgian styles."

"O- Very confused by this beer. It's certainly not bad, but it doesn't really follow what I consider the guidelines for the style. Perhaps it's an old bottle, it wouldn't surprise me here in upstate NY. It was kinda dusty. I'll definately try this one again sometime in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fine here: able-bodied & effervescent. It's a bit hot with alcohol is its only detriment. But overall, this is an off-the-mark, below-average attempt at a style that not many American brewers get right."
""
"Overall I think this is a decent beer for the style. It was pleasant, but nothing really stood out. But I liked it."
"O - Overall, I'm disappointed with this Avery offering. Very unfortunate."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and some very peach and apricot like fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a distinct peach flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and I especially like the peach flavor I am getting out of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Not a bad beer. It's missing the complexity and complementarity of flavors that the best Belgians have, but it's entirely drinkable."
""
""
""
"Pours out a light golden color with a trace of copper around the edges, and with a somewhat better than average head retention and lacing... The nose is indeed very apricot-like, but also contains light cinnamon, clove, coriander, and a bit of banana aroma as well. The flavor is very peachy up front with a bit of caramel malt thrown in as well for good measure. Gets a bit alcoholic and solvent-y in the finish but only by a tiny amount which is acceptable in my book. Body is somewhat too thick for my tastes, however, and also somewhat too lightly carbonated. But other than these minor issues it is a worthwhile brew."
""
""
"O: well done, a little high on residual sugars but plenty of complexity and flavor."
""
""
""
"Definitely would have over and over again. Thanks to all at Avery for a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall A very nice American take on the style that's dangerously drinkable. Saddens me the only place I found this was Boardman Ohio (Vintage Estates). Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a slightly sweet flowery taste. Bitterness lingers after."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting to compare this with Unibroue Don de Dieu, which is in the same style. Much less heavily flavored, even though it's brewed with spices and the Avery is allegedly not. 22 oz bottle was $6.99 at Ibis Food Mart in San Diego."

""

"This Belgium Strong Pale Ale is a wonderful offering from the Avery Brewery. Just like The New Belgium Brewing Co. AKA Flat Tire to most, Avery has delivered an authentic tasting Belgium Ale that is impressive and well most important... tasty!!"

"O- Very pleasing considering the ABV."

"Avery Salvation, 22 oz. bomber: I love Belgian style beers for an after dinner treat. The Avery Salvation fits the bill perfectly. Using my best tulip glass, the Salvation radiates deep amber with a hint of ruby color. Resting comfortably on top is an ample head that lasts to the finish. You expect that wonderful aroma of yeast and bready notes from a Belgian style, and this Avery brew delivers in abundance. But the best is yet to come. Very smooth going down, the Salvation has a wide array of flavorful notes, from apricot and pear to hints of cinnamon and alspice. I greatly enjoyed experiencing Salvation! Bomber size ""signature"" brews are expensive, but at times are good but not outstanding. The Avery product clears the bar."
"It could be better, but I wouldn’t doubt this is because the bottle’s been on the shelf a little too long. Through the oxidation, however, is a pretty good Belgian. I’ll revisit this one when Avery decides to distribute in Arizona again."

"D: Nice. Some fascinating, well behaved complexity."
""
""
"Overall - Not an undrinkable beer, but also not what I was expecting. It doesn't have enough carbonation and feels way too heavy to be within the belgian style. The taste is fine, but it's not complex at all and seems to have some adjunct qualities. I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"O - Overly sweet, phenolic and messy flavors overall."
""
"Would pair very well with food."
"Overall: Will definitely be a steady in the fridge Avery Brewing Co might be one of the biggest sleepers in the micro-brewery business but not a sleeper to me. Well crafted beer and that pretty damn good. I hope you all enjoy...Cheers!"

"I would like to revisit this one on tap to see if my suspicions were unfounded and to see how it performs in a bar atmosphere against others like it."
""
""
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a clear orange amber color with a large creamy ivory head. The aroma and flavor have a large candy sweetness with some citrus and peach fruitiness. The spices come through and add some pop to the fruity flavors. There is also a decent level of bitterness that is works well with everything else going on. Medium bodied with good carbonation"
""
""
""
""
"O- a solid stab at a classic belgium style from the avery team. not bad at all but not great."
"O - A solid entry from the always diverse Avery canon, and worth a try if you're feeling up for a Belgian with an American twist."
""

"A really great thirst-quencher, too =)"

"O-Another great brew from the Holy Trinity from Avery."
""
""
""
"Notes: After the old disappointments in the Holy Trinity of Ales, Reverend (mild disappointment), Hogs Fly (badly remembered) this is a much welcome and delayed surprise. I probably need to revisit those two just in case… This was a much recommended brew from those lost Floridian folks I met in Atlanta, thanks, and indeed well worth the try. Not only it stirs away a bit from some astringency/dryness I am not particular fond of in most Golden Ales (my bad) but the fruitiness and rounded sweetness while not extraordinary actually works very well for me."
""
""
"Overall, not a bad take on the style, but not my favorite either."
""
""
""
""
""
"wow, buttery colored and fluffy headed salvation looks tempting! smells of butterscotch and over ripe peaches. also that classic belgian yeast. tastes a bit fruity, again the peaches, and there is a unique sweetness that works well here. it could be more carbonated, which would give it a lighter/brighter feeling in the mouth, but the lack of super carbonation makes the flavors stand out distinctly. this is a fantastic series of beers from avery, and along with the reverend are in my opion the two best brews they make. really different for a belgian pale"

"Overall: I like this one as far as tastes but the smell kind of had a funky bitter orange that I didn't like to much. I love this ale otherwise and wish it was available in 12oz bottles."
""
""
"Overall: As always, an enjoyable beer from Avery."
"90."
"Good all around. I'd like to have this after it cellared for a while."
"Simply, a solid Belgian."
"Overall: Nice bold flavors. The 22 oz bottle went pretty quickly (considering that I'm not feeling quite 100% on a morning following GABF '11)."
"Overall I wasn't that impressed by this one."
"I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately for the Avery Brewing Co. I personally found this beer to be very fruity with tastes of dried apricots with nutmeg and, or cinnamon. Which brings me to the question wheres the hops? The pour was a disappointment do to the inability to produce or even maintain a head. I'm not wanting to bash this beer because you can tell from the bottling, color, artwork on the label (which is amazing by the way) speaking of the color I think I had made up my mind that I was going to love this beer due to the color, maybe why I was disappointed. All that being said if you like a fruity tasting beer, this ones for you. get out and try it."
"Pours a deep yellow/golden color with a fizzing quick fading 1 finger head that leaves nothing behind. Pretty good pour. Smells of bananas, fig, orange, and plenty of euro yeast. Not overpowering but smells nice. Taste is really smooth and enjoyable. Lots of fruits hit the palate with a somewhat hoppy finish that lingers. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall this is a pretty solid beer."
"T: Candi sugar, slightly bready malts, brown sugar and a touch of alcohol. While the alcohol flavor is present, it's nicely subdued. Overall, a pretty nice take on the style."
"Solid, easy to find, year round brew with a good price point."
"Hmm, not awful, but kind of a miss for me."
"A hybrid of styles Saison/BSPA/triple in that order, and it seems unfocused. I could not wait to get through my glass."
"The Salvation started out so well for me but then got worse as the beer went down. I’d still probably give it another try."
"O: Nice and balanced, but a little more bitterness compared to the Belgians I've had earlier in this style."
"Overall: Very nice aroma. The taste at first was more sour than I like but after a few sips it became more drinkable."
"D - Very complex with intense yeast character. Kind if thick for the style and perhaps a bit less drinkable because of that, but still a nice beer."
"Well, I would say Belgian IPA here, the hops are dominant over the yeast and malt."
"Overall, there are so many other, comparably priced Belgian style ales that I prefer (Unibroue, I'm looking at you), so I probably won't buy this again. I guess part of it is that from the color, description, and ABV, I keep wanting it to be a tripel, which it isn't nor does it claim to be. Ultimately hoppier than I'd have liked."
"D: Not bad for pulling it off the bottom shelf at the liquor store."
"Poured out as a golden yellow color with some haze to it. The head on the beer was big white and thick looking. The smell was yeasty and had a touch of spices on the nose. The taste of the beer reflects those same aspects. The spicy notes come through in the aftertaste and leave a light warming sensation I the mouth. The mouthfeel is a little on the thicker side, not too bad. Overall it's not the best Belgian Strong ale but it's probably worth a try."
"Peace Out, Avery."
"The beer is an opaque golden/ orange with pillowy white head that left a lot of lacing. Smells of banana, candisugar, lemon and yeast. the taste is kind of funky, I could taste banana yeast clove and grassy hops. The mouthfeel is thick with soft carbonation. I thought this was a good beer, nothing too special though."
"This beer pours a clear golden orange color with a finger of foamy white head that dissipates rapidly and leaves little lacing or retention. The aroma is strong with floral notes and sweet malty notes. The taste starts with some floral and earthy hops and then becomes sweet with bready notes. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes smooth. Overall a good Belgian ale."
"Drinkability/overall- its drinkable and the balance is very nice in making this beer not becoming to sweet or to dry, its alot lighter then I expected both by smell style, its a good beer falls just short of being great but for 5.49 def good value and a buy,"
"Overall pretty good, typical but nice Belgian golden malts, fruits, candi sugar, just a hint of hops, a bit boozy, and the sweetness and little syrupy feel are a bit much."
"not as nice as the reverend, im not as into the belgian pales so maybe thats the reason, but worth a try."
"O: Nice one. Still not as good as my favorite belgian strong pales, but still one to add to the roster. Would buy again easily."
"O: Wasn't a fan. If it had tasted like the aroma, that would have been fine, even though it seemed to be lacking in hops slightly, but drank a little of it and then poured it, something I rarely do."
"Overall, this is a great beer for the style and really love it."
"This beer is an interesting, non-traditional belgian-style ale. It's, of course, a clear, golden color. Modest head for the style. The smell is unique...earthy, musty, hoppy, alcoholic, and very fruity. Apple, pear, peach, and spice. The spice note comes out more through the beer...along with the earthiness. The taste is very sweet, more sweet than expected. Hoppy...warm, and peppery. The finish is quite sweet. Good, solid body. Nice beer."
"O: I have enjoyed most of the things Avery has brewed, and I was very tempted to try this as well. It is maltier than I thought it would be, and it is heavier than I thought it would be as well. I understand that Belgian-Style Golden Ales tend to be on the heavier side, but I was expecting a bit more balance from hops. The beer is fruity (mostly pear with honey) and on the sweeter side. The alcohol is fairly strong on the finish and evident in the warmth that sits in the throat. Salvation is not a bad beer, but it could have been better balanced."
"(22oz bottle). Pours clear dark golden-almost orange color with white head. Nice carbonation. Aroma has lots of ripe pit fruit and maybe a little citrusy guava. The fruit really dominates the nose, but its very pleasant. Taste is sweet malt backbone that is nicely balanced by some hop bitterness. The ripe fruits peek out from the bitterness to balance this out. Thin to medium bodied with a somewhat sticky texture, but not as much as many other Avery beers. Finish is slightly bitter, but pleasant. This might be my favorite Avery beer in their regular line-up. Figures, they are leaving AZ now. Oh well, I can wait a year or so til they come back."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good Belgian Pale. It has a nice blend of hops and malt, and ultimately goes down pretty smoothly for being as strong as it is. To be honest, I don't really know what it is about the finish that doesn't really ""do it for me"". If it were more hoppy, or more sweet, I probably wouldn't care for either...so I guess that makes it just right. I guess if it were a bit drier on the palate in the finish it may come across more convincingly. Perhaps he isn't using adjuncts (which is admirable), but maybe a little would help dry this beer out a bit and make it a little cleaner in the finish."
"I'm not sure how old this bottle was, but I think some aging might be best for it. Definitely an above average beer, just not one of Avery's best."
"Overall it's decent, but not fantastic."
"jd"
"o - Overall a nice Belgian style ale from Avery that seems a bit heavy on the spices. I enjoyed it quite a bit, though I would have liked more fruit. Would have again."
"overall i enjoyed this beer quite a bit - very drinkable even with the high abv - glad i bought 2 i can see how this ages"
" Grade Purchased at Stoney's-$ 7.99 ea."
"There are some really great examples of this and this is really good although I don't know if it measures up to say a Duvel"
"Bright orange-yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a brief, short, white, head that didn't hold up. However, ample wet lazy lacings on the glass throughout. Tropical fruit and apricot aromas, along with belgian yeast, peppery spice and a hint of biscuit. On the thinner side of medium bodied with pleasant, tangy carbonation. Tangy apricot and citrus flavors in the front followed by a floral hoppy and spicy middle. Finished with a hoppy citrus and light pine character. A long lingering yeasty, biscuity, belgian aftertaste. The alcoholic heat peaks through every once in a while, but isn't prominent. Definitey a sipper and very enjoyabe."
"O- A good quality beer that fits to the style. Very balanced and a great sipper."
"I approve of this beer, as a lover of Belgians. The fruitiness is a little different, and it drinks extremely easily. The ABV is somewhat high, so the alcohol peeking through is understandable. A winner from Avery."
"My curiosity for both Salvation beers arose after I tried Collaboration not Litigation. I have to say I enjoyed both Salvation's much more then Col. not Lit. I look forward to having another one of these."
"Overall, seems like a bastardized weissbier that is a little too sweet. Interesting enough but doesn't seem at home in the BSPA category."
"O- A decent BSPA worth having, but I wouldn't call it an elite example of the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong but well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice stronger Belgian beer to drink for a long time."
"D: This is a bastardized version of its style. The malty sweetness is overdone while, again, the yeastiness is hardly noticeable. Is it terrible? No. Will I be drinking it again? No."
"Overall, sometimes things are better the second time around. first time I had this one was at a bar after a few other beers. I didn't think Salvation was anything special, probably since the flavors are so delicate that any beers before mask them. Definitely a heavenly experience"
"Vegetal overall, with a lemon pledge nose and edamame taste. Cheap alcohol burn."
"I would highly recommend this, perhaps as my third favorite Avery beer, and thats hard to say"
"Decent medium body, high carbonation, but a bit creamy and dry. Drinks nice, although it was a little hot, and not particularly memorable compared to other Belgian styled ales."
"I was worried about this beer being a sinful bastard, but it was most assuredly a fine beer that hides it's abv well, and is delivers a tasty and heavenly drinking experience. I just don't know if I'll ever buy this over Duvel."
"D - Not bad, but not very good considering the price."
"D: Not bad, but I would still take Duvel for the money for its crispness. This one is a sipper with a thick, slick feel and a nice spicy, fruity flavor. Good, but I like Collaboration not Litigation Ale a lot more."
"Cheers!"
"The citrus tartness cuts out the sweetness. Good creamy characters. Alcohol is hidden well. A solid drinker."
"Nice pleasant beer from Avery. Good yeast contribution to the flavor and aroma. It is a little too sweet for my taste."
"This beer has aged with grace and went down way too fast. Still, not as complex as i would have liked."
"D - I could literally do this all day - and in fact, I've done it before with belgian counterparts of the same ilk. Smooth, strong, complex and refreshing - other than some moules frites to line the stomach, what more could anyone need?"
"Pours a moderate brown color with a thin tan head and almost no lacing. Nose brings candied sugar, caramel, dark fruits, hints of spice, and some booze. Taste is a bit of a mess with flavors in all directions and the malt and the yeast never really coming together, and then being overwhelmed by a big booziness. The feel brings a slight creaminess that is somewhat appetizing and is a boost over the nose. Drinkability is fairly poor. Definitely prefer the other end of the collaboration."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Dedham. Served in a 10 oz stemmed tulip glass. Hazy pumpkin orange color with not much head. Smell had a really nice spicy aroma to it, like coriander and cardamon. Taste was very pleasant. Strong Belgian flavors, such as candied sugar and and tart fruit like apples and pears. Mouthfeel was not bad, but the high abv seemed a bit hot on the palate. Drinkability was fine for a high alcohol beer, but the 10 oz glass seemed appropriate for a beer of this strength. A nice beer to savor for a while as it warms up."
"A fairly clean pour. It has a little hazy cloudiness but not much. The color is a very rich yellow gold. The head is thin but laces well. A huge malty, banana nose jumps out of the glass. The banana carries over to the tongue but not getting any other spices. Without more fruits or spice it doesn't seem like a belgian style but still a good beer. Some alcohol heat is present but thin it smoothes out to a creamy malt. Great mouthfeel. It covers every crevice of your mouth causing a long lingering finish. It's not so rich you can't drink this one easily but with the alcohol feeling it makes me wonder how much you would want to."
"D: A bit too sweet for me with a sort of half hearted spice character. A bit boozy, too."
"Overall I give this a 6 out of 10. I won't pursue this much since it's cousin ""Collaboration not Litigation"" is far more interesting to me and more substantial. This feels like it's weaker, dumber brother. Still good but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability is not great either...not overly inviting. The lack of carbonation makes the sweetness overpowering."
"I have had Avery Salvation before but it was in ""Collaboration"" with Russian Rivers version so I have not had it by itself yet. Salvation is a orange hued, golden pale ale with a tuft of foam that releases orange and lemon oil aromas, a hint of pepper and clove and a yeasty earthiness. The beer had a lingering sweetness that was perhaps due to the low carbonation for the style and the mouthfeel suffered for it. Overall, not the best, but drinkable"
"Pours a hazy gold with a nice white head. Fruity aroma. Flavor is apricot, yeast, citrus, slight clove, pears. Alcohol is hidden pretty well until you finish the 22oz bomber than you feel it. A decent Belgian golden ale but nothing special, I have had better."
"D: at 9% it doesn't really show it. probably great if you love the style, but i didn't dig it at all. Not bland, but flat and boring in my opinion. sorry if i'm missing something."
"D: Good overall average beer. Nice to drink on a hot night."
"This is probably my favorite local Duvel sort of beer. It's a nice gold color with a sturdy white head held up by plenty of carbonation. The flavor and scent have a big Belgian fruitiness with a touch of vanilla. The body is nice and light. Delicious."
"While Avery does some excellent beers, I fail to be impressed by their Belgian-style ales. With this one, I feel an eventual drain-pour coming on. Something just rubs me the wrong way here."
"I noticed the the style says Belgian Strong Pale Ale but my bottle says Golden Ale (and this is not what I expect for a strong pale ale) but the label shown matches my bottle. I hope I put this review in the proper spot here."
"The ornate, busy, and artful label design is fitting for this opaque golden ale with a brisk 9% ABV content. The taste is rich, malty, and sweet with floral, fruity overtones and a hop-edged finish. A complex flavor that's pleasing and surprisingly palatable. Superb!"
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a pleasant rocky white head on top. Aromas of orange blossom honey, light citrus and Belgian spice. This one is a pleasure to drink, and goes down way to easily for its abv. I get flavors of pears, dark candi sugar and maybe white pepper. Very good and always welcomed."
"Great overall beer. I'm glad I finally decided to pick this one up."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable BSPA that I would be happy to have again. Very complex for the style. A very good offering from Avery."
"I'll be buying this again for sure. The $6+ price tag isn't too bad for 9% and great taste."
"MD- Drinkable at a slow pace. The big bottle a t 9% has a kick."
"Drinks nicely."
"D: really good. I could easily enjoy multiple rounds of these. Exceptionally enjoyable!"
"D - Not a style that I am especially knowledgeable about, but I found the Salvation to be yet another very solid offering from Avery. Well rounded flavors with a nice integration of the ABV - not to mention a great yeast strain. Good stuff."
"D - dangerously drinkable for the amount of alcohol in it. Great beer."
" D- The great dry fruity beer is stomped on by hop bitterness with some notes of old spices in their. There wasn't even much hop flavor or aroma just the bitter bite."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright yellow with a decent white head. The aroma had an initial blast of sulfur, but that blew off quickly leaving a grainy - rather wheaty, in fact - character with some gentle fruit, like apricot, and a hefty dose of allspice. The flavor follows along, with a strong wheat-like character, giving it a bready note, with light spiced fruit - apricot, pear, white nectarine. The mouthfeel is thin, but there is a found overripe sourness on the finish. The alcohol strength, at least is relatively well balanced."
"Very watery mouthfeel, not a lot of physical substance to the brew and the alcohol burn is not very well disguised."
"By all means not an extreme american deal, perhaps a bit stronger than the usual for the style, but definetly a return to good old hearty, delicate blends. good beer."
"Quite good especially for the price. Very Belgian and holds true to style, although far from my favorite Avery bomber, but definately a worthy brew."
"D: I found this to be a real pleasant beer that despite it being slightly different than the traditional style it is given is a real fun drink. As I try more of what Avery has to offer it has yet to let me down. I would recommend giving this one a try."
"This beer is definitely too pungent and not dry enough to fit into my category of Belgian Strong Pale Ale. That said it is still a very good beer. I guess I had only tired the Collaboration version as well as Russian River's version. This is very good. I would consider it a strong blond rather than a strong pale but it had great flavor whose alcohol is well hidden, good carbonation and something I'll drink many times again."
"This is a very pleasant beer that's remarkably quaffable for 9% ABV. It is a little sweet, with a mild graininess that gives way to vaguely tropical yeast and hop flavors. It has a nice, long, lightly bitter finish. This beer should appeal to a wide variety of drinkers."
"Go Avery!"
"Pours a hazy gold with a airy off-white head which fades quickly, but leaves a ton of spots and streaks of sticky lace behind. Smells malty, fruity and yeasty, with a little spice in the end. Tastes a bit grainy with a big fruit hit in the middle, some big hops toward the end, and a few slight phenolic notes lingering in the background. Further exploration reveals some cotton candy sweetness which works into the mix quite well. Alcohol is well-hidden at first, but becomes more apparent the beer warms, but never to the point that it is overwhelming. Medium bodied and quite drinkable."
"Pours a clear, goldenc color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, hops, slight alcohol, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, hops, slight yeast, slight sweet malt, and slight earthy malt. Overall, good blent, aroma, body, and complexity."
"The body may have been just a little fuller than I find is usual for this style. Even at the 9% ABV mark, this beer is very drinkable. Overall, a decent example of the style, worth your time."
"Above average example of the style. Aroma is dominated by Belgian yeast, citrus peels and coriander. This beer has too much coriander for me, too much spice. The hops give Salvation an earthy, herbal profile and it meshes well with the big yeast backing. Tastes notes are honey, apricot, overripe banana, coriander, Belgian yeast and light candi sugar. Probably too much candi sugar. Overall a good beer but still far from the best examples."
"This poured a clear light gold with a little bit of white head. It smelled like orange and lemon zest and sweet honey and sour yeast, with some floral hops and hazel nut. It tasted like apricot and lemon and orange hops with sweet honey malt and sour yeast, with some spicy wheat and alcohol accents. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter and sour aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice smell and taste with lots of hops, almost like a Belgian IPA, but still very well balanced. It had good body too, but the noticeable alcohol makes this more of a sipping beer. Quite an enjoyable drink, and recommended."
"D - High ABV but very delicious."
"Golden clear, smooth-looking. Notes of orange, fruit dense sweetness, flavorful. Brown sugar, maple, cinnamon, caramel, perfect mild-low carbonation. Pops and zings on the pallet with each sip. Faint bitterness. Drinkability bumps this from a 8.25 to 8.75. Highly recommend. Alcohol is mildly evident"
"Pours a light honey in the glass with a creamy white froth with above average retention, & good lacing. Aromas of honey, orange peel, ripe pears, green apples, lemon, mango, ripe grapefruit, passion fruit, biscuit, & belgian yeast funkiness that follows through on the palate.(I couldn't find a whole lot here when cold, so I let it warm and characteristics in the beer really became easier to identify. I definitely started to drinking this beer when it was too cold.) There is a bit of hop bitterness that adds to this beer with a definite dryness that I was looking for in this style. The mouthfeel is full and slightly syrupy and the alcohol is present, but, at 9% abv, well hidden. Overall a solid beer. Recommended."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 1 inch white head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is golden amber and slightly cloudy. The aroma is of sweet malts and cloves. The taste is slightly bitter with malt sweetness, fruitiness, and cloves coming in toward the end. The feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a clean finish. This is a very enjoyable ale that I'll be returning to, but I can't see myself knocking these back all evening."
"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and thought it was a very good though not great beer for the style. Well worth a shot."
"Peachy yellow, thin fizzy head. not much lacing, but still some clinging to the sides of the glass. nose is yeasty with a clove spiciness, light fruits mostly peach and pear. taste is yeasty up front, peppery spiced in the finish. some pear and white grape taste follows the nose. the spicy bite is nice to balance everything out. it is a bit hot, but not overwhelmingly so. the mouthfeel is a bit chewy where i was hoping for a dryer finish in this one. overall this beer is a must try. probably not the best example of bspa, but def a standard fare."
"Notes: Avery has been hit or miss for me. This was a hit. I recommend this for any Belgian style fans."
"O: Nothing special. I've had much better from Avery."
"Mouthfeel is a decent medium, but I think BSPAs should be big and full. Not creamy enough."
"Crisp spicy medium body with a lot of estery light fruit notes, floral hops, slightly creamy body, subtle hops and alcohol warmth. Smooth, quaffable and pretty drinkable. Hints of peppery spice, crisp citrus and light fruit notes. I'm picking up estery apple and pear with some orange peel, subtle hop bitterness and alcohol."
"M&D- Better than most belgian goldens i've had but too sweet in the long run."
"Drinkability is excellent for this style of beer. I split a bomber, could have easily drank the whole thing and more."
"Pours a deep amber with dense one finger white head, leaves a nice clump and lots of lace. Smell: sweet, grainy pale malt, vinous, graham cracker. Taste: sweet, musty and grainy, spicy, dried peach, maybe a little lemon peel, pepper at end of the sip, white nectarine. Dry, active carbonation, slightly creamy, alcohol hidden in the sip but warming. Better than expected, maybe even underrated."
"Notes of dried fruit and malt are noticeable, along with some barley. There is a definite sweetness in the aroma. Tastes of caramel and alcohol are sensed first, which is followed by some light bitterness that fades quickly. Mouthfeel is bready and creamy, and overall it is a refreshing, drinkable beer."
"Beer pours a golden amber with a robust, frothy head. Subtle aromas of malt and grain fill the nostrils, and anticipation builds. The beer beckons to be savored, and when this belgian elixir hits the tongue, there are tastes of orange and bready malt. Then the subsequent alcohol warming effect gives itself up to a gradually building bitterness that lingers well past the swallow. The carbonated nature of the beer lends itself to a nice mouth coating. Beer is very pleasant and drinkable but not something I would want to drink more than one of at a sitting."
"An extra note: As others have stated, try sipping this as it warms. The flavors seem to balance out. It is very spicy and in your face when ice cold. Cheers!"
"Overall: still learning to appreciate the style"
"Avery Salvation: This Belgian Style Golden Ale was golden in color with a luscious apricot and peach aroma that is interwoven with suggestions of nutmeg and perhaps cinnamon. The apricot and cinnamon in i raelly loved. Medium body with a soft palate and sweet finish. One of my American Brewing companies."
"D - A very well-crafted brew. It has just the right amount of fruity, spicy, herbal complexity. I'd pair this with a creamy, slightly bitter cow's milk cheese with a lightly washed-rind or with a fried egg for breakfast. Seriously."
"Overall, this is a great BSPA, which is quite inexpensive. Its tasty, and warming."
"D. Excellent drinkability. It went down smooth in both the sweet and bitter stages and I would drink again if I was given the opportunity"
"M/D - A mouth engolfing mouthfeel, but it goes down exceptionally easy especially with the nice and high abv!"
"Satisfying, but not blow your socks off great. For the price, I'll probably revisit this one, as its a relatively good example of the style, Americanized at least."
"Drinkability- Pretty good for the style."
"There was a sweet alcohol note with concord grape esters and ripe bananas. It was very well balanced between alcohol and fruit sweetness with rich malt flavor. Great price value at $5.99 for the 22 oz. big bottle. My beer was bottled less than three months ago and it showed based on the livelyness not the beer wehn I first poured it. I am can only imagine that this beer will imporve with age."
"Was expecting a bit more bitterness. True to the style, but not really what I was hoping for."
"Decent.Not too boozy or sweet. Worth a shot."
"The taste and feel, though, lack. It tastes like what it is, but a thin, very bland, subdued form. It is spicey and raisiny, but in a rather bland way, with faint hints of orange and juniper plus some grain, mostly just in the finish, and a light, vague fruitiness. Everything is very subdued and thin except for alcoholic bit and spice. It has a somewhat full, slightly oily feel, but this is a bit thin, too, and it carries no real character with it."
"D- This one is definitely a sipper, but a solid beer that is definitely worth a shopt."
"Not the most remarkable version I've tried from this style, nor one of the more remarkable brews I've sampled from Avery, this one is fairly forgettable. An okay room temp. tripel, yet still rough around the edges."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: A medium body with high carbonation and a dry finish."
"Drinkability is really high. This is a well-priced, super-tasty BSPA. The only real issue is the abv. Avery has got a real winner here."
"D- its a tasty brew but not the greatest."
"Overall very enjoyable and a good American example of the style."
"Pours a hazy orange with fluffy white head that dies down to a thin line of bubbles. Belgian yeast aromas. Smells sweet, spicy, funky, and tangy. Good malt, peppery spice, buttery richness, and a bunch of funky yeast flavor. The only thing that I didn't like was that I thought the hop flavor and bitterness was a little too strong. Nothing wrong with it, it is a unique take, just not my taste in this style."
"This is a slightly above average brew for it's type. Enjoyable but not one I'd go out of my way to find."
"Sweet and spicy cinnamon-malts; interesting and I'm going back for more ... quite a beer."
"The aging of this bottle is key, I think."
"D=Not really."
"Overall, a simple Belgian pale ale, but well-executed."
"D - Find some friends who like Golden ales, it's a lot to put down by yourself. Still, very drinkable."
"D- easy to finish but not sure id want another one right now. something i shouldnt have passed by so many times without trying. the price is right. it seems to be a very americanized version of a belgian style. not bad."
"D: ABV alone makes it a nice sipper. Flavors and complexity change with warming, so take your time."
"Nice looking in my snifter, has a somewhat smaller head than I'd like to see in this type of Belgian beer. The smells and tastes are very average. There is some sweetness and sugar notes compounded with earthy bitterness. None of the smells or tastes are pronounced however. If you search, you can pick out some of the complexities which are the norm for the style, but I think you shouldn't have to search if the beer is truly great. It stays nice and carbonated and is even quite refreshing for a beer with this much alcohol. Its a fine beer and maybe one I'd have again if offered, but its not my favorite. Avery does many other things very well, but I'm not sure this is one of them. Just an average Belgian Style Pale Ale."
"D - Not one I would purchase again."
"D: Will not have this again. A very unenjoyable flavor."
"I'll have to try this again in a few weeks to make sure I get a different batch."
"On a final note, I must say I'm torn over this one. I liked the beer, but didn't think it fit the style all that well. The heavy dose of grapefruit in the middle really threw me for a loop. Get the grapefruit out of there, and you have a nice Belgian. With it there, it's a bit too American."
"Tastes very sweet and again plenty of fruit. Comes off as too sweet leaving a sticky near cloying feel on my tongue. The alcohol warmth on the end attempts to balance out the residual sweetness, but fails. The mouthfeel is surprisingly limp and somewhat lifeless lacking the strong push of tiny bubbles found in the best of Belgium. Too sweet to enjoy more than one glass."
"The color is a honey tone with a small head that quickly laces away. The smell is metallic , a tad sugary. The taste is sweet, not too overpowering though. Mouthfeel is fairly light and easy, very pleasant overall. This is a solid strong pale ale, and proper quality for the price."
"M/D: Light bodied with some low carbonation. Alcohol is a bit too evident in throughout the consumption."
"D- Unbelievable for a Belgian with 9&ABV. No strange flavors"
"A beautiful pale wheat color, like a late summer field. Big fluffy cloud like head, that leaves a little lacing. Smells like a belgian, a little barn a little malt and lots of yeastyness. Taste follows smell. The carbonation is just right, its very light on the tongue and smooth all the way down. Drinkability is the shining cross of this beer. 22oz went down fast and I could drink another or two, but at 9% that's a bad idea."
"The taste is slightly sweet (think pinot grigio), herbal, slightly medicinal, hoppy (but not overpoweringly so)...complex doesn't even begin to describe this beer. Each sip brings a new flavor nuance to the forefront. I'm very pleased."
"D- the savior has a drinkable complexity, but that's about as far as it goes due to its mighty strength. good beer for a pimp cup."
"Pours a slightly fogged orange gold with a thin white head. Nose is perfume, floral tones, and boozy. Flavor carries a fair amount of alcohol tones as well. Minor dough. Floral tones are here too. Typical Belgian ale sweet tones. Feel smooth on liquid and carbonation. East to drink. A bit too hot, but nice enough."
"Final Thought: A nice strong ale that tastes like a kicked up German hefeweizen. Very good stuff, but not worth the price tag."
"Nice. Pours brown with a big tan head. Aroma is spicy and grainy. Heavy flavor. Lots of malt, yeast, and spice, with some candied fruit. You can definitely taste the cinnamon, especially as the beer warms. Borders on a winter ale with the spice. Avery always seems to come through."
"The aroma is complex with coriander, nutmeg, light fruit, yeast, malt, and alcohol. The appearance is hazy copper gold with a two finger head. The flavor is complex just like the aroma with a spicy peppery finish. The palate is smooth. This beer could be from several of the best breweries of Belgium and no one would even know it's an American. Maybe I should say any of the best brewers of Belgium are close to the quality of Avery."
"Average for the style and with the ABV way up there I would not drink much of this. So many better examples of the sytle readily available leaves this one on the store shelf from now on."
"It has a bright gold colored body with about three fingers of frothy head. This beer pored like it should have been in an advertisement. It has a spicy sweet and mildly sweet aroma. It has true Belgian style taste. It is very sweet to start but gets gradually bitter as you go. It almost has a pumpkin spice melon like aftertaste. The mouthfeel has both minor alcohol and carbonation bites."
"Notes from 9/3/04"
"o:fairly drinkable. alcohol is always there but non-inhibiting. the yeast ester profle is a marvel and just keeps going. less dry than a duvel and head is a letdown but otherwise i'd choose this over duvel."
"Overall, nothing wrong with this beer at all. I underestimated it a lot, because I am not the biggest fan of Belgium beers, but this beer has just changed my mind. A beer I would highly recommend!"
"Pours a golden brown color body, very clear, and fizzy. Nearly no head, but it's white. Strong dry aroma, grapes, dark fruit, complex, alcohol. Smooth taste, flowery, leafy, slightly fizzy, dark fruit, taste of alcohol. Grapes, spices. Warming up helps, aging might make it better."
"D. Very strong but a good grouping of flavors and aromas."
"D: On the whole this is a well made beer. While I wouldn't rank it up with some of its Belgian cousins, it's still a solid beer."
"Not my favorite from Avery, nor is it my favorite example of this Belgian style. Glad I tried it, not really one I'd repeat."
"Excellently drinkable."
"This is golden, light amber sunshine with a pretty quick head but rtentive lacing. Ok lacing and a filmy foam. Very little to no bubbling. Th aroma is a dried flower hops and kingly breads with some yeasty fruits. Pretty convincign scent of a genuine Belgian strong ale. The sweetness of this beer is a lovely bread grain that hints at tartness. Dried chrysanthamums and roses with fruity ester, candi sugar, and almost gourmet white bread grains. The palate is a soft syrupy flower nectar with lots of honey notes. The alcohol is well integrated with this Belgain inspired ale. Good conversation beer."
"Drinkability: A nice, pleasant Belgian Strong Golden, though a bit overtly sweet."
"Drinkability is ok. This isn't the best I've had of this style, and I had to really force myself to drink the last few sips because the alcohol comes out way to much once it warms a bit."
"Some strong, pleasant flavors that don't quite balance each other out. The 9.0% abv goes almost undetected. This one may benefit from a little aging for the flavors to round out and mellow."
"D: This beer ok, I guess. The mouthfeel is amazing. The taste, look and aroma are a bit too basic or below the standards this beer should be at. The ABV isn't too bad with just a nice warming quality. The verdict is that this beer is alright, but it could be a hell of a lot better. This was a bit of a let down. Moving on."
"d: Surprise, surprise: it's better aged. It was good, but probably my least favorite of the vintage beers I tried that day."
"Drinkability - Altogether not bad at all, though I'd rather have a smaller serving of La Chouffe, for a foamier and much more fragrant Golden Ale. Little weaker on fruit flavors than I like as well."
"Great full mouthfeel, but the alcohol and the sharpness make it not quite as easy to drink as some golden belgians."
"overall a well balanced beer."
"It is about time I tried the other component of Collaboration Not Litigation, pretty much what I expected and definitely know where the Avery and Russian River beer gets its fruity Belgian accents, will drink again, recommended"
"D: Very nice drinkability, spicy and really enjoyed this. Would definitely buy this again and comes with a definite recommend."
"Less carbonation than the style warrants, but the mouthfeel is quite lush and full, so it's a bit of a wash. Solid BSPA."
"Nevertheless, the alcohol is far less noticeable on the tongue than in the brain. It's not hard to drink, so heed the warning signs...like the 9% abv sign on the bottle."
"This is a great beer for aging, while the 2008 bottle is good, the 2005 and 2002 vintages are much more complex and dynamic. As expected the malt increases with age, but the phenolics and esters also dramatically change. I would place the 2002 as the best of the three with 2005 coming in second."
"pours a beautiful orangeish huge with a big white frothy head on it. it looks beautiful in my snifter. the smell is 100% mandarin oranges, it took me a second to point it out, but i think it smells like mandarin oranges. taste at first is of oranges, then a more complex fruity and alcohol flavor takes over, mouthfeel is kinda dry but not bad by any stretch of the imagination. good beer, avery is in my opinion one of the best american breweries out there."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium, and it is definitely drinkable. Not the best strong golden I've had, but still pretty good."
"Definitely a decent offering, just didn't match up to my tastes/expectations."
"I find this an excellent Belgian with lots of American Rocky Mountain attitude. Highly recommended and I will drink many more of these if I can get my hands on them."
"Drinkability is moderate. Average flavor and high alcohol limit this brew."
"Nothing outstanding, but a very solid example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. If you are a fan of the style this is a most try."
""
"Poured into a snifter and got a thick two finger off white head that was very fluffy with plenty of lacing that covered a hazy medium brown/gold body with a little bit of carbonation. The head thins out a bit but continues to completely cover the body of the beer. It has a good floral aroma with some spices and malts coming through; it smells sweet, mildly citrusy and fresh. It has a smooth medium-to-heavy body and is balanced over all, nothing is too bitter or too sweet, I can pick up what tastes like butterscotch in its aftertaste, this is a pleasant beer to drink and is very smooth as well, there are almost no hints of alcohol and only a mild dry mouth feel in its aftertaste."
"The rich toffee sweetness against the malt makes for some good sips, but after drinking all 22oz the sweetness and yeast flavors don't sit so right with me. There is a lot of nice balanced flavor in the actual drinking, but once I'm finished I'm not sure this is necessarily a great beer."
"D: Pretty strong, I think one bottle is all I need. But, that one bottle very very drinkable!"
"D - Wish I had a full glass."
"I could ask for a little more carbonation. I always want a Duvel-esque foam whenever I have a BSPA, and maybe this is a little unfair. The complexity of flavor is presentation enough and makes up for the slightly thickish mouthfeel. Lots of residual sugars are left on the tounque and lips, quite enjoyable! This was yet another stellar offer for me from Avery, I continue to be impressed by these guys, Look foward to Fifteen, the next in my fridge."
"Avery, Avery, AVERY! Poured out of the bottle in a nice amber color with a great apricot nose. A fantastic balance of malt, hop and yeast in the mouth feel and finish. Still with the apricot notes and hints of banana...what a hidden 9%ABV. Love the yeasty mouth feel that doesn't hang around and feel like an old person's closet. Very great drinkability- would even be a nice beer on a hot day. Keep on rockin' Avery."
"A solid Belgian Strong pale Ale, but it lacks the smoothness some of the better ones have and the taste just sorta blend in with some of the other ones I have had, nothing really unique."
"This was a recommendation by my local beer buyer, and he was very enthusiastic about it. It certainly lived up to his raves: very fruity aroma with a good amount of yeast, smelling just short of a nice slice of homemade bread. Decent carbonation that is not overbearing; plenty of apples and citrus with some spice to keep it from being too sweet. Nice and soft overall with a good edge that adds complexity. The somewhat high alcohol level adds warmth-- don't drink it too fast. Nice label!"
"As I said, this thing tastes strong and it really shows it's 9% ABV. But the taste is marvelous. It's really everything an American BSPA can be. It's one of the best I've had this side of the pond."
"Clear gold, very, very little head and not much lace. My comparison on this is Duvel and this looks nothing like it, really. Smell is sugar, peppermint, phenols, and oranges. The taste is pepper up front, a lovely caramel malt, and a dry, crisp finish. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. The mouthfeel is silky if a bit flat. Drinkability is good, although a strong alcohol warmth in the finish reminds you not to find it TOO drinkable. Overall, definitely one I'd buy again. And maybe one I'll share if you're really nice to me. Or hot."
"Smooth and slick in the mouth with a hint of aromatic alcohol and warming. High abv and the taste of alcohol probably limits drinkability, but if this were served colder, probably not."
"D- Not my favorite Avery offering. Pretty standard Belgian Pale Ale. I'd like to give it another shot."
"A rich golden hue with a sily off white head. Nose is of candy malts, spicy yeasts and some light fruity hops. A bit mellow for the style. Like the nose, I would like to see more kick in the flavor profile. It has some Belgian pepper to it, but is mostly mild sweet malts. Not much fruit tartness either. The body is medium with good amount of carbonation. A drinkable beer, but fairl ylight for teh style."
"A nice interpretation of the style overall. Though it might not reach the greatness of some others of the style, it is certainly a very good brew!"
"Poured into a snifter. Very bright, slightly hazy yellow, bright white head that settles very quickly. Aroma is a bit yeasty, with a certain belgian candy sweetness to it. Can taste a bit of hop presence and an assortment of spices, not quite to the extent of a witbier, but in that kind of direction. Mouthfeel is very moist, not too thin, not to thick. just right. Maybe a bit too fizzy feeling, but that's about it. A Very light belgian style brew, would be good to use this one to indroduce some to belgian ales, without some of the quirky flavors you get in stronger, darker brews. I will have no problem finishing off this bomber, and would love to try this on tap someday."
"It's crazy to think this is 9% ABV. Watch out. There's only a hint of the high alcohol content. Could drink this all evening. Very good."
"Overall, this is great example of American breweries' ability to produce excellent Belgians of any stripe. A good beer, a damn good beer."
"drinkability. this is a one glass and y'er out brew... its the mouthfeel that limits this."
"Very good golden ale. Significantly above average."
"This brew has attractive golden amber tones with little head, just some lacing that clings to the glass. It has a dried fruit smell that competes with a strong aura of booziness. A slight bitterness lingers on the tongue after every sip, but my strongest impression from the taste was the flavor of raisins. The consistency is between light and medium, but the booziness makes it more suitable for sipping."
"The beer pours a deep gold color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is quite spicey in this beer, consisting of white pepper, honey and cherries. The beer smells great. On the palate this beer is fairly sweet, again with more honey and cherry. However, there is a good dose of hops noticeable on the finish, giving it a considerable dry, bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied and bitterness on the finish helps to balance the sweetness and alcohol. Still, the alcohol is pretty noticeable in this beer, which detracts slightly from its drinkability. That being said, this is a very impressive effort from Avery. Nice beer."
"D - Great offering and is definately a beer you will find in my house often, but the alcohol content makes it a little hard to have too many in one night."
"Drinkability is good, decent complexity keeps it interesting and the booze smooth, but to sugary to really want to drink more then a glass or two - it would fail the authentic Belgian digestibility test for sure..."
"A golden amber in color with a slight white head. Sweet and flowery in smell with a wonderful hints of Belgian sugars and yeast. A bite in the first taste. The alcohol hits right away. The second is just as strong with it smoothing out over time. Not as drinkable as the Reverend as odd as that sounds. A good tasting beer. I bet it's the 9% that throws me off."
"With this level of alcohol and the 22 oz bottle, I would suggest having a friend join you for this one. I think it would stand up well against the ""true"" Belgians!"
"Smell is a muted coriander, spice and apples and apricots. Taste really brings out the coriander. Dry biscuity malt body. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Nice example of the style."
"D - As much as I really like this beer for it's unique peppery spicy hop flavors and it's affable odd-ball nature, I don't really like it as much as other BSPAs. It's worth trying for the experience, but I'd pass this by in favor of many other BSPAs as the unique flavors that make it different can also be distracting and overbearing."
"There's a hop bite in the finish. Otherwise a somewhat mild but nice brew. Very easy drinking golden Belgian. Yet another strong effort from Avery."
"Drinkability, to me, is limited. While a good beer in its own right, there's a lot of heavy-hitting competition in this style category. It's more of a slow sipper than something dangerously drinkable like a Duvel or La Chouffe. Really hoppy and boozy stuff for this style. Don't be dissuaded by the relatively low score I'm giving; this is one of the more interesting beers I've had lately. I agree with JohnTravolta below, this is the most fruity (and alcoholic) Belgian strong blond I've had. I'll buy again when I want a boozy slow sipper."
"The nose had sweet honey with some slight perfume notes. The taste was sweet golden apples,apricot,and orange rhine. The drinkabilty would score higher if the alcohol level wasn't so high. Besides that this brew was smooth almost a Irish whiskey quality,some mineral content and wet stone dry finish. WOW!"
"Drinkability: It's not a bad American Belgian if you can find it at a reasonable price it's worth the try and yes I'd drink it again"
"Well worth purchasing, Salvation is a fascinating alternative to The Reverend, still one of my very favorites from Avery. There is less spice but more smoothness than The Rev, making this very refreshing for its heft."
"D- This BSPA has a much more complex fruit character than any other I have tried (and its my favorite style). I have also never tasted on with such a strong emphasis on tropical fruit. Its certainly not a fruit beer, however. The alcohol is definitely there in this one and it does not hide. I have to give Avery credit on this very different example of the style. They are a great brewery. I will probably revisit it-but I'm not really into tropical fruit (espicially pineapple). I'll probably stick with the Reverend or Maharajah as my Avery big beers."
"Another big beer from the Avery Brewing Company, this Belgian-style Golden Ale pours a crystal-clear light-bronze, apple-juice color with minimal or no head... not much lacing going around here but some carbonation present... Smell is sharp and stings with a fresh-floral, grapefruit-like aroma that clings to the nose... taste if full of fresh-fruits, pears, grapefruit, esters, alcohol, citrus and bananas... very clear and clean flavor with a good, clean mouthfeel... the 9% ABV is present but is not overbearing... drinkability was slightly compromised due to the noticeable alcohol... otherwise, the rich and sweet flavor with a candied-aftertaste hits home and is certainly pleasing... good stuff from Avery... Recommended..."
"D - At 9%, I don't know how many glasses I could handle but the first one went down pretty well."
"It pours a lovely golden amber with some fine bubbles and a white, fairly persistent head. Aroma is more hoppy than malty and has an odd but not repulsive rubbery hint. Flavor is fairly rich, malty and hoppy with a good alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is edgy and a little harsh, but this is still a good call."
"D: This is a very good BSPA, finally having it for the first time today, on par with the greats out of Belgium, well done."
"I poured this one into a Belgian goblet and was rewarded with a nice head that gave off citrus and peppery aromas. I was surprised by the strong malt backbone this one has. Lots of Belgians rely on their esters for flavor. Salvation had strong malt, hop, and yeast accents, so it was one satisfying brew!"
"D: Strong, but goes down easy."
"D- I like this 'un."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of cloves, tangerines, leather, and earth. The taste is more earthy than the aroma, and has only a hint of clove and tangerine. The mouthfeel is full bodied with very high carbonation. The carbonation seems to take away from the beer's flavor. Overall, this is a nice beer. I would certainly drink it again."
"Poured a hazy, opaque amber color with little to no head. Fruity aroma, apricots comes to mind. Taste is fruity, but the hops linger on the palate. Nicely balanced, avoids being overly sweet unlike a lot of true Belgians. Modest mouthfeel provides a bit of creaminess. A pretty good stab at the style, not earth shattering but tasty."
"I can't really say much about this brew. It's fairly inexpensive, and I think it could hold a place as a semi-authentic reproduction of middle-of-the-road pale belgians. Taste and aroma are accurate but wildly understated. Feels nice on the mouth at first, but stick with a first glass. If you find it for really, really, cheap, grill up some spicy kebabs, it'd make the dinner party into a drunken debauche!"
"Even though the score isn't all that high I did enjoy this quite a bit. Its just not overly complex or as bold of a flavor as I am used to from Avery. Its just a very solid beer with nothing that makes it truly amazing. As much as I like Collaboration not Litigation with its bold flavor, I did expect a little more from this one. I guess I need to get my hands on the Russian River version now."
"D - Okay. It is nothing great. I had Collaboration, not Litigation, I think I liked that better than this - which suggests I should try RR's Salvation. I really need to get over there soon. I won't have this one again. It's kind of funny - like Avery, even though I give most of their beers mediocre reviews. I guess I just like that their brewing is original and interesting - if not always delcious. Keep it up guys - I need to find the 14 soon."
"I liked this a lot. A well worthwhile beer."
"Pours a light gold color with a decent white head that dies down rather quickly. Smell is a little sweet and spicy, peppery. Taste is very similar with some dried fruits on the palate. Some earthy hop presence too. Mouthfeeling is light, and a little watery."
"Pretty good beer. I think it'd be better if it was a little dryer, but that's splitting hairs."
"Overall a good drinkable offering that deals with the abv quite well."
"Avery is top-notch."
"Quaffable. I cant wait to try ""Collaboration not Litigation"". This excellent BSPA tastes like it would great with a sour offering."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into New Belgium Snifter. Poured a golden color with small amount of orangish hue. With a white head that foamed up to fade rather quickly to leave a small trace of foam. Smell of spice and corriander with yeasty malt aroma. Taste is nice and malty with phenolic flavors slight bitterness of floral hops. Mouthfeel is a little to carbonate which helps shows the alcohol of 9%. A good beer from Avery overall."
"D: The 9% is heady, so beware. The flavors are strong but they are indistinguishable from most other BSPAs."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle. Decent enough fluffy head from the initial pour. the second glass was better than the first as the beer had a chance to warm up and the flavors cme thrugh much better. had a lot of grapefruit with nice spice and just a bit of hoppiness as well. Good american alternative to the belgian golden ales and will try this one again."
"D: This brew's sweetness is so cloying that it was hard to get through the first 12 ounces alone, let alone the last 10. The beer filled me up and left me craving something drier."
" Overall a quality brew, as most from Avery seem to be. This was my first shot at one of their Belgian styles and it was just classic, a good all around brew. I would definatly like to come back to this one again at some point. Very impressed and I would recommend a try to anyone."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. It went down smoothly and the taste was consistent even getting richer as it warmed and opened up. You can definitely feel the high alcohol content so I savored the beer for a while."
"Serving Type: 650ml bottle poured into St. Bernardus goblet."
"Overall not my favorite strong pale ale, the weak head did it for me the most. In the end it didnt really fit the style all that well. Still it is a good brew and worth a try."
"D: Would be drinkable except that I don't enjoy the taste."
"This beer looks fantastic. A clear dark gold almost orange color. It also has a great big whit head and it leaves tons of lace. I don't know how a beer could look any better than this. Smells malty and fruity with very very slight hops. Taste is full of sweetness. lots of orange tones with an alcohol twinge. After the tornado of flavors it is not really that bad but the high alcohol will limit my drinkability rating."
"Pours a cloudy orange color, with a small white head that went away fast. In the nose, sweet alcohol, somewhat light fruitiness. In the taste, a dry pear charicteristic and alcohol backing that up. It leaves a dryness in the mouth, with the alcohol still there. I feel this is a great interpretation of the style."
"The yeast really shouts the loudest in this one: the malt is an understatement  I keep forgetting its there, and the hops add only the tart, leafy bit of tripartisan voice necessary to be in balance. What fun; I do like Avery."
"With 221 reviews as of this writing I will add this to the collective: A great looking beer that is a bit hot and unapproachable taste wise until it comes up from cellar temp to room temp. once the brew was in the upper 60's it really smoothed out and became quite tasty. It may be the sequence I tried these in that is influencing my perspective as I write this. I would recommend trying this beer on it's own merits to see for yourself."
"09/08/08 I'm updating this review to add that this is a really mediocre beer. In fact it sucks."
"Pours a nice hazy yellow with a decent frothy white head. The aroma was a nice blend of sweet malts, spice and floral hops with just a hint of alcohol. The taste was a very good balance that I've come to expect from Belgians with the hops kicked up a bit as I've come to expect from most Avery beers.The yeast bite and sweet fruit flavored malts complement the hops nicely. The beer is somewhat crisp and refreshing and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. This is a yet another enjoyable beer from Avery."
"For a beer that started out so promising, this let me down. Its alcohol flavors are just a little too powerful for me."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle purchased in mid May. Poured a chill hazed deep golden, but then turns clear rich gold as it warms. The smell is fruit, and candy sweet. There is also the slightest belgain funky yeast smell. Taste is of sweet malt, sugar, and a bit of mild hops are detectable in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is medium-full, a bit slick because there is no carbonated burn... very fine carbonation, and slightly dry. The alcohol is very well hidden and the overall experience of drinking this beer are so good it can be very drinkable.. but beware, at 9%. Overall just a bit more full bodied and sweeter than Damnation."
"This beer starts out like it is going to kick ass but winds up being a sugary mess."
"Pours a golden, orangish amber color with a light white head (thin) that leaves a lot of Brussels lace. The aroma is minty with hops and also has some sweet, biscuity notes and solvent alcohol. There's a phenolic quality in the background. In spite of the different notes, it's a slight, not-too-evocative nose. On the palate, things get more interesting, with bitter hops first off, followed by some sweeter, slightly acidic fruit notes (strawberry, lemon) with a biscuity, buttery malt underpinning. The finish is dry, which is unusual for American versions of Belgian styles, and helps immensely in both authenticity and taste. The mouthfeel is extremely well carbonated and a touch acidic, which gives a citric impression. Overall, this is very good. One of the better Belgian style beers from an American brewer that I've had."
"The head retention on this beer is about as good as it gets. It starts with an amazing white, frothy head that doesn't quit. The lacing is prodigious and the pour is a nice golden orange. The smell is sweet malts, alcohol, spices, coriander, sweet fruits, and very enticing. The taste is a bit too strong and unbalanced towards the alcohol notes for my tastes. You will find a medium bodied, sweet, alcoholy, malty, spicy, beer that is surprisingly more watery than your typical Belgian strong ale. The back of the palate and after taste is where the burnt yeastiness comes out, and the strong alcohol notes really pronounce themselves. When I start to feel some heartburn coming on, I know we have a problem. Not bad but it just ""aint"" as good as your Belgian strong ales from across the pond."
"Medium bodied and quite smooth. A little prickly carbonation. A decent Belgian Pale in my book, but its just like most others of the style out there for me. Easy enough to drink though, no major issues with this one."
"palates."
"The taste has a lot of pluses...the brew has candi-sugar sweetness that is nicely balanced by some hoppy bitterness. But the complexity hoped for from the Belgian yeast aroma profile fails to come through as sugary sweetness ultimately wins out..not so much in the flavor as in the stickiness on the lips and in the mouth through the finish. A nice attempt at a Belgian style that just misses the mark, but is not without redeeming qualities."
"D - Overall, this is a really solid beer. Delicious. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too spicy. The pouridge is just right. After-dinner treat."
"Pours a golden straw color, quite cloudy with a nice frothy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are dominated yeasty esters of banana, a little clove and a bit of bubblegum. Quite a bit of hops are detected in the nose, uncharacteristic of Belgians, but they seem to be of the Styrian Golding variety or other European types. On the palate, the hops dominate creating a very bitter front to the continuing fruitiness, quite dry with a long finish. On second thought, there may actually be a bit of American hops in here given the strong citrus notes and high bitterness. This is a bit syrupy in the mouth, not as vibrant in carbonation as most Belgians, still a good attempt by an American brewery."
"D: Im not sure Im a huge fan of this beer. Really straight forward, not overly complex and the end bitterness sucks."
"D-High abv is dangerously hidden but this is not a mind-blowing, ""must have"" in my eyes. Definatly a good beer but I wanted a bit more balance in this."
"Drinkability - nice to try, probably would not buy again, but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"Avery typically brews solid beer that falls short of what I would consider great (New World Porter, IPA and The Czar are delicious exceptions to that rule). Salvation is an enjoyable big beer that comes close enough to the Belgian masters to be well worth the $5.99 that I spent on the bomber. The next time I buy it, though, I'm going to lay it down for at least three years."
"Drinkability: Good! I liked this one a lot."
"Drinkability - An easy drinker for sure, with enough complexity to inspire a long slow drinking session. And as it gets better with warmth, the high alchohol matters less. I could sip on this one beer for hours."
"D,notes: A good American take on a Belgian classic. Would have liked some more fruitiness in the flaovr department. Very drinkable despite relatively high alcohol content."
"The body is medium. Carbonation is gentle on the palate. The alcohol is quite apparent, however. Would be more drinkable if it were given some time to mellow out the burn. Overall, I really enjoyed it though."
"Poured a hazy golden amber hue into tulip glass, capped by a thin white head that stuck around quite a while for its initial petite size. Aroma quite strong of Belgian yeast, pepper and fruit esters, and a slight farmy buzz from the hops. Taste more of the same, but a steely hop finish, a bit too metallic in the bitterness. Sweet up front with honey and raisins. Mouthfeel is good strong carbonation but does nothing to improve the experience. As the brew warms the metallic aspects come out further and the bottom of the glass is less than desirable."
"Salvation pours a golden color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is fruity, and I think I can smell the candy sugar. Taste is kind of bitter, a bit peppery from the alcohol too. There's a little bit of fruit too. The taste improves dramatically as it warms up, but in any case it's still not very exciting in my book."
"Pours a medium to amber gold with a relatively thin head that quickly fades and leaves some spotty lacing. The aroma is fairly sweet with candy sugar, cloves, banana, and cinammon. The taste is much less sweet, with a healthy hit of hops adding a topnote to the sweeter under flavors. The sweet flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is first crisp and then with a fairly creamy finish. A little mouthcoating. Pretty delicious and drinkable, even with the high abv. Overall, a nice beer that is a little heavier and more bitter than is usual for the style, with sweeter notes than some as well- but these balance the bitterness nicely"
"Overall, this brew will be appreciated more by those who enjoy the sweeter style of Belgian ales, as the candy sugar is quite predominate. Not bad at all, and nice to share with a friend."
"This is a solid Belgian Golden. Not as complex and unique as some but definately enjoyable and easy drinking. The price is good too at $4.99 a bomber. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
"22oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a heavy gold almost amber with a 2 finger head, decent longevity and excellent lace. Nice rich heavy malt aromas mixed with citrus and honey smells. Hop floalness just teases the nose. Big malt flavors quickly followed by hop flavor and bitterness. Alcohol is noticeable but not too bad. To me this one is just 2 dimentional. It goes from straight malt to straight hop with not much in between. Its not a bad beer it just doesn't excite me all that much."
"22 oz bottle in a pint glass with local Boston band The Slip on the Hi-Fi . Color is a brass / copper with small head which fades a little bit . Smells of banana , caramel , and bread . Tastes abit spicy and lemony . This was boring though .The flavor is everywhere . I wish it was a bit smoother and the ABV is somewhat hidden but the flavor is not my style ."
"D: Good times, nice belgian style from a great brewery. This is a smooth drinking belgian style ale with 9% abv, but you don't really notice that till the end. Go out and try this one it's worth a shot."
"Purchased at Sam right next to the collaboration not litigation ale. Chilled and poured into watou goblet, nice creamy pure white head one finger thick with wonderful snow like lumpy lacing. Body is a warm peach-ish amber color with blond highlights, clear warm and reflective. The aroma is fresh and clean I get juicy pear esters right up front with that sort of spicy/ peppery character, which is slightly less apparent in this than some Belgian Strong Pales. Taste is again fresh and crisp with more light esters, some pear and maybe even apple coming toward the midsection with a slight tart bitterness, and a dry finish. The alcohol might be just a little too much if I was drinking with food, but for just drinking its fine with me. Totally worth a try nice take on a B.S.P. ale."
"Cheers!"
"Bottom line: This is a pretty good offering of the style from Avery and is at least worth trying."
"Despite the alcohol, or maybe because of it, I want another immediately. Very drinkable, lovely beer."
"This hides its strength well, but is just too dominated by tangy Belgian yeast flavors to be something I'd want a lot of."
"Thanks Vancer and NO BS BIF Beta!"
"the hop character is large, but the mouthfeel is not. in fact, it seems to die off rather quickly"
"D - Another great ""big bottle"" beer from Avery. And a good representation of the style."
"I can always count on the Avery bombers to be a little different. This belgian had a strong pinapple-hops aroma and taste to go along with the standard pale belgian sweetness and spice. Not amazing or too complex, but nice and different. Worth a try for the price and could make a nice stocking stuffer for the approaching holidays."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a frothy white head. The smell is fruity with some yeasty characteristics. Mostly peach with some pineapple citrus smell going on. The taste is similar, yeasty, hoppy, and fruity. The aftertaste has a kick of the ABV but stays consistant with the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium light, adding to this beer. This is easy to drink but can knock you on your but if you take down a few. Not a spectacular beer, but it is a belgian worth trying. Enjoy!"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with abit of a reddish hint and a foamy white head. The smell has a full ""bisquity"" aroma with sweet malt that disappears pretty fast. The taste is creamy with a malt sweetness,bread yeast, coriander, pepper,clove, and some banana. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well while hiding the high alcohol very well. A decent beer from one of the better breweries in the U.S."
"Due to the high ABV, it's not even close session-able, and it's not so good that you'd kill for it. In fact, I don't know how far I'd go out of my way for it, but it's not one to regret either. Just a little off-balance."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"The mouth is complex, bright on the front, gets a dry for awhile as some spices kick in, then finishes sticky on the lips. Another good one from Avery."
"Drinkability: A nice and refreshing beer that is still quite interesting and complex. I think these go well with food or as an a night cap. Pretty high alcohol limits the number of these you could have in a row."
"Overall: I think this is a pretty average Belgian Strong Pale. It did improve as it warmed though."
"Overall it's not a bad Belgian-style ale, but a bit too jacked up, like other ""extreme"" American craft brews."
"The aroma had me expecting a lot, and I wanted more from the flavor than I ended up getting. It just doesn't have anything notable going on when the palate gets its chance. That, and the healthy ABV, makes more than a glass an unlikely happenstance. I guess I expect a bit more from my Salvation than this is willing to grant."
"Pours a clouded golden-copper color with a thin white half finger of head that fell back to a light white ring of lace. Aroma is rich of fragrant floral hops, sweet herbal notes, grain and light undertones of alcohol. Slightly spiced smell about it, blends nicely with the hops of the brew. Taste is sweet and hoppy, yeasty, dark ripened fruit, more honey-like sweetness, herbal spiciness, cloves, and then the alcohol shows itself before trailing off the tongue. Leaves a light drying bitter aftertaste of hops and slightly of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, aptly paired with moderate levels of carbonation, bubbles tingle the tongue. Drinkability is good, enjoyable level of complexity, interesting blend of flavors and smells, an overall tasty beer. Would purchase again."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a slight head. Smelled of herbs and sweet malt. A good balance between the alcohol and malty hops; went down surprisingly crisp. A nice bubbly sensation carries the whole way down for that great warming feeling and a slight alcohol/hoppy aftertaste."
"D - Good and tasty. I'm not familiar enough with the Belgain Strong Ale style to say if this is an authentic rendition, but regardless it's damn good!"
"Taste; the flavor carries through more so than the aroma did. This is definitely fruity, with bananas, lemons and apricots. This has a very sweet honey like quality that's balanced a bit by some peppery spiciness, with a prominant alcohol presence. Unfortunately this became pretty harsh after it warmed up, and became quite a bit harder to drink. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a drinkability that takes a hit due to a high alcohol content and a sweetness that becomes a little cloying after a while."
"This is a good brew, but a bit too much alcohol and odd seltzer flavor for my tastes.."
"Pours a light golden ale with no head. This beer has all kinds of smell those including apple, citrus and a bit of alcoholic overtone. My first sip packs a punch but I'm ready for another! Wow there it is again ripe apples and a fruity aftertaste linger. Carbonation is mild and just right for this style of beer. Nice to see something of this caliber to come out of Colorodo and representing a Belgian favorite. The only downfall of this beer is the 9% abv which makes it difficult to have more than one. Once again Avery has nailed it!"
"D: Upon my first sip I got the feeling of high alcohol content but then every other ingredient quickly washes over and instantly mellows its presence.This is a very drinkable Belgian, not heavy at all, quite refreshing but you know the alcohol will get you. Excellent. I am looking forward to having more from Avery. So far my favorite Belgian."
"The mouthfeel was bright and fresh with little oxygen character. Got this one fresh methinks. Keep up the good work Avery!"
"Bottle courtesy of Daalamar: Poured a clean dark golden color ale with a small foamy head with little retention. Aroma of candi sugar is a bit overpowering and doesnt allow for much else. Taste is very sweet with very little yeast or spices characteristics. Alcohol is pretty subdued but a bit too one-dimensional and boring in my own opinion."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head that disipates quickly leaving little lacing. Picked up a spicey hops aroma in the smell but then followed by a yeast that wasn't like any Belgian strand I've had before. The taste was very yeasty giving it an almost sour taste. However, not sour enough for my to say this beer was spoiled. It was an almost medium body beer that didn't fint to the alcohol at all. The Beer's finish was semi-dry. It's a slow beer to drink. While I cannot say it's the worse beer I've had. It defenitely doesn't rank very high on the list for me."
"This is a high alcohol sipper. Nice label, not a ""go to"" beer for me."
"Overall: This beer is good, but not anything exceptional. Just ordinary. I would drink it again."
"Poured a cloudy orange with a snow white head that went away in about 40 seconds. Smell is sweet malt, a little bit of candied fruit, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is the smell, amplified. Especially the sweetness. For what this is, and considering I don't really care much for this style, this is a fantastic representation of the style, and just a good beer all the way around. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, while a little thick and heavy. Drinkability is down a bit due to the strength and the weight of the beer. Overall, I was impressed. I'd buy this again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, creamy, buttery, coating, and mouth-filling are the words that come to mind. All similar in description, and all apply with their subtle differences. Wine-like in its grace and deep, complex character. Big and warming in the belly. Glad to have tried it."
"Yes indeed - yet another winner from Avery, who are seriously working their way into contention of becoming my favourite brewery. For me, this is definitely one of those Desert Island beers, oft discussed and nominated in the forum."
"A decent enough Belgian golden."
"This is still a wonderful brew for the smell and balance alone, but as a Belgian pale ale is pretty much my favorite style in the summer months I'm probably more critical than most with this style. I'll probably pick this one up again, if only to break up my usual Rare Vos or La Fin du Monde."
" Drinkability? I know what the ABV is, but I could still drink this like a fratboy. So drinkable? Hell yes."
"Better as it warms but overall a decent american version of a Belgian golden."
"Pretty bottle and label, too."
"Very smooth/creamy on the palate... some luscious pear and peach flavors... bit of alcohol, malt... quite sweet with a nice hop background."
"Drinkability - goes down well and is good, high abv limits it to one in any given session."
"Salvation is a bright golden orange with a creamy, medium-sized head. Carbonation is mild. The aroma is very strong. Citrus and spice smells burst out alongside an underlying candi sugar sweetness. Taste is very spicy with plenty of citrus flavors. The spice flavors are very peppery and are aided by an edge of hop flavor. An underlying sugary sweetness keeps the other flavors from a total domination of the palate. A touch of alcohol is noted in the finish. I found this to be excellent, the strong spice and citrus flavors really won me over, and the layering of flavors was pretty awesome as well. Highly recommended."
"Overall...quite a tasty brew...I would buy this one again...Avery did well with this.."
"Overall, i like it, but dont love it. It's quite drinkable though being at 9%. A good beer to enjoy, but i wouldnt exactly bring this one over to Belgium to show off what we have been doing."
"This beer didn't knock my socks off, but it's a very solid brew and a nice example of the style. Glad I tried it."
"Spicy mouthfeel all around. I liked the spiciness to it. Full bodied."
"D: Not bad at all for a style that I'm not always a huge fan of. Straight 4's for me."
"Nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel about it, decent warming in the alcohol dept...I wouldn't put Salvation away like I do the SN Bigfoot, however, I would definitely drink one again in the future...Enjoy !"
"Bottle provided by the brewery and consumed three days after bottling. Pouors a half-finger white head that settles to a thin layer. The liquid is crystal clear and brilliant orange (somewhat peach colored). Smells of oranges, coriander, belgian candy sweet, and blegian yeast funky phenolic. A bit grassy, like from hops, too. Tastes citrusy hoppy mixed with belgian funky. Whoa, a combination I've never had before. The combination of the two is quite interesting. Other flavors I get are caramel (mild) apricot and peach. This beer is smooth creamy malt. Dry stingy finish. The aftertaste is cherry and iron. Md-thick body and modestly carbonated. Judged to style (supose to have a huge billowy head)."
"Pours a dark golden color with some amber red hints. Head is very dissapointing and almost non-existent. No lacing to redeem the thin head. Nice carbonation stream from the base of the Chimay chalace. Smell is very mild, some yeast notes and some appricot fruit notes but nothing special. Taste is somewhat bland. A little bit of spicyness but just not much to talk about. The beer is just very average at best. Noticable alcohol finish completes the underwhelming experience. Overall a big disspointment and not something I will seek out again."
"D - high, a good beer, great job, good balance of bitter and spiciness"
"This relatively nice ale pours a nice pale amber color. The white head is a good size but does not last long at all. The head does return with a gentle swirl (and swirling can be addictive fun). The smell is slightly fruity, with apples coming to mind. This fruity smell seems to be a bit distinct from the hint of alcohol also coming through. The taste affects the taste bud located on both the palate and the tongue a bit differently. The taste on soft-palate is very nice: a light at fruity flavor being carried with the carbonation. The tongue is another matter: a rather stickyand unpleasant feel and strongly alcohol taste. Average out this is a nice beverage but not one that I can recommend searching out. There are significantly better offerings out there for this variety."
"Good to see American breweries creating great Belgian Style beers. Avery doesn't quite get it right this time round. A strong straw, almost golden color with a light haze and good head retention. Smells very fruit (peaches and pears) and lightly peppery with a promise of heated alcohol. Flavors of peaches, pears, mangos, pineapples,.... along with spicy Belgian sugars attribute to high alcohols (too much for the style) and a bite-ey, almost husk-ey bitterness in the throat. Finishes sweet, dry, and a bit too hot and fusal. Still too good of flavors to allow the flaws to ruin the beer. I will drink again."
"Orange. Very nice aroma of ripe, dripping apricots, citrus fruits, sweet malt and sugars. Sugary as hell in the flavor yet not cloying. Big, bursting fruity flavor with notes of tangerine, apricot, grapefruit and orange. Medium bodied but silky and smooth. A delightful beer."
"Great full feel that's crisp and refreshing. I would love to have this beer more often."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Medium bodied, crisp, and sweetly spicey."
"An americanized version of a belgian, but the flavors can't be argued with. Some of my favorite belgians have more of a wild charachter, but this beer earns it's stripes with complexity, abundant flavor, and firm backbone. Bravo."
"Beer is good. Hapy beering."
"The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful. This is 9% alcohol and tastes it, but it is also smooth and silky. A nice ale, whose drinkability is marred only by it's high alcohol content."
"Pored a nice translucent, copper color wiht a white, fluffy head that dissipated quickly and left a touch of lacing in my goblet. Moderate-high carbonation with large bubbles on the surface of the beer. Aromas of honey, melon, grass, and caramel. The taste was quite sweet with fruit flavors to offset subtle bitterness. Juicy, ripe fruit flavors were quite pronounced in this beer. Dry finish with lingering sweetness that develops turns sour over time. The biggest knock on this beer is that the aftertaste contained a chalky texture and flavor. It felt like I had taken a bite out of a piece of chalk. The aftertaste didn't bother me at first, but it continued for several hours after I finished the beer and was not enjoyable. As a result, the drinkability takes a drastic hit."
"Drinkable enough, kind of reminds me of Duvel. But not really my style"
"Overall, I'm glad I got a 22 oz. bottle! I'm sure the 9% will also make this appealing to finish. However, probably the nicest Avery product I've had the opportunity to taste."
"Drinkability- Easy drinker that seems a bit less of the 9% than is states. Nothing out of the ordinary though. Tastes decent enough and went down well. Worth a try if you get a chance."
"22oz. Bomber Pours a golden yellow color with some carbonation, small head, some lacing afterwards. Scents of fruit, malt, and some spices. The taste is sweet, but tangy as well leaves a little bit of warmth in the throat. Medium body. Drinkable at the ABV. A nice offering from Avery."
"A good brew with a few areas that made it less distinguished and impressionable then most of the Belgian Goldens out there. A good old fashion American try that works in most ways, but perhaps a bit understated and less complex then it could be."
"A nice solid Avery offering. Pours a deep golden color into my tulip glass, with a 1-finger head that doesn't stick around too long. Aroma is enticing, with some peachy fruit and some spices and yeastyness. Taste is fruity. Melony .. some honeydew, cantelope. Perhaps a bit of peach. Some lightly nutty yeast is present, and the spicyness is more evident as it warms. Mouthfeel is a bit phenolic, and slightly undercarbonated. Very drinkable, though. All in all a good ale."
"~Pretty decent beer, not that outstanding but worth the price and another try sometime."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange, medium white head forms, some stringy lace. Smell is honey, caramel, citrus, yeast, floral hops. Taste is malty, with caramel and citrus, some floral hops and a little alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with high carbonation. This one was sitting around for a while so it smoothed out a bit, nice beer and better than expected."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Medium bodied ale with a creamy mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer. There is not a trace of the alcohol in the smell or taste of the ale. There is a nice balance between hops and malty sweetness in this ale."
"This beer is only available in 22oz. bombers, so grab a friend and split a bottle. I'd recommend serving it up in a goblet or wide-mouthed tulip glass to enjoy the great aroma."
"Beer pours a slightly dark gold with a thin head. Citrus scent with some tea aroma too. Tastes about the same but with more hops than the beer needs. Do not get me wrong, I love my hopped up beers but this one just seems off. The flavors don't seem to mix well even though you would expect them too. After my initial taste I really was having a hard time distinguishing this beer from the Maharaja that I had a few days before. After a few more drinks I found that ""Belgian"" flavor that I was wanting. Not really a bad beer, just not what I was expecting. I enjoyed it as I do all beers, but I wouldn't purchase it again. The 9% alcohol content will make you feel quite nice too."
"Yeasty aroma, cloudy orange, a nice head with lace. Hoppy yet creamy, grapefruit bitterness on palate. Another purposely over-the-top hopped-up Avery. Full mouthfeel, some spicyness and drying finish. Would have been fine with hope restraint. Maybe some cellaring. Thanks Tupalev."
"Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, a tiiiich watery. As far as drinkability goes... well, the 9% is certainly extremely sneaky and hidden, but I'm not sure I could drink a bunch of these. I can see myself in the mood for this from time to time, but ultimately, there are many other Belgian Strong Pale Ales I'd rather be enjoying. Give it a shot."
"The beer shows a slightly hazed shade of golden. Carbonation surfaces at a moderate pace. Thin white head disappears quickly and the rimming that is left behind leaves sparse lace. Aroma is warm, toasty and bready. Sweet and fruity too. The flavor improves on the nose. Becomes more pronounced. With bready malt tones forming a nice base. And fruity esters and phenolics mixing it up on top. Nicely spicy as well. Peppery. Mouthfeel is lively and the body is about light-medium. Alcohol is almost ghostly, but accentuates everything nicely. Good enough Belgian Golden here."
"Hands down one of the best American Made Belgian Pale Ales. Pours out to a dense golden color with some haziness to it. Minor notes of lace around the glass (tulip). Medium high level of carbonation is lower than many Beligans, but works very well in this brew. Smell is wonderfully inviting; aromas of malt, candy, sugar and yeast beg to be tasted. The flavor backs up the hype created by the aroma. Sweet floral hops, mild malt, sour dough, yeast, grain and sweet fruit swirl around the palate. Exceptional. Mouthfeel is medium to medium light bodied, making this brew very easy to drink, and letting the 9% ABV remain hardly noticable. Very good drinkability. This brew is worth the effort. World Class. Highly Recommended."
" -Cheers2Beers"
"I haven't had much luck with this brewery and this is not an exception."
"Poured into my bowl glass deep golden with a slight chill haze with a nice blooming white head that left a nice sheet of lace behind.Alcohol dipped fruit mainly citru orange and pineapple with a touch of phenolic spicey/yeastiness.Flavors are quite yeasty and spicey with the alcohol really coming in as it warms more,not as fruity maybe as I would have liked.A solid Avery offering not completely in ur face like some of their ""big"" offerings but quite good,I would drink again."
"A fairly dry and somewhat harsh brew, it does start to sweeten by mid-bomber  also that may be the 9% kicking in. Not bad, but still semi-disappointed in this Avery brew. $6 for the bomber makes it a little $$ for the taste  but very drinkable."
"Body is medium, slick on the palate, and somewhat grainey textured. Drinkability is average, certainly wished I had someone to share this 22 oz with! A noble effort, but yee will find no salvation here!."
"Overall I think this is a good beer. I would say that this isnt a good example of a Belgium Golden Ale style, but rather as an American style belgium golden ale. Very smooth and taste, a bit more hoppier and a high alcohol that is not noticeable. Salvation at last."
"Poured a nice golden color with a good head which is retaining nicely. Nose is of sweet candy, fruits, and spices. Taste starts sweet and lemony, somewhat peppery, and ends with a surprising strong for the style hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and lively, full for the style. Overall drinkability is good. They did a nice job masking the alcohol!"
"Crystal clear gold color, looks almost like your standard ""macro"" lager. Head is white, fast fading. Belgian yeast funk and banana in the nose, and that's about it. Taste is very intense, way more than the nose would allude to. Big yeast and grapefruit flavors, very hoppy, with the alcohol adding intensity to the flavor. More banana flavors, also slightly floral. These all make for a very interesting beer. Not great, but good."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a clear deep honey color with essentially no head or lace, but dependable carbonation. Smells very fruity and wine-like, with bright citrus notes,restrained alcohol spice and wood tones. Tastes much like it smells. Quite fruity at first, but with a strong drying woody white-wine like finish. Perhaps a touch too astringent at the end. Nice and light in the mouth considering the strength, with refreshingly active carbonation. A pretty nice drink overall, if a bit uncomplicated."
"The taste starts off with a malty sweetness that is paired with a little lemon and dry hops. The sugars come out midway before some pepper from the alcohol towards the finish. Yeast notes come out in the end. Full mouthfeel that doesn't get syrupy from the sugars. Very drinkable in spite of the abv."
"Chill-hazed bright orangey amber color, head is white but doesn't build much in a Trois Pistoles chalice. Just a few scant dots for lace. Aroma of pear, some spicey syrup elements. Thickish mouthfeel, low carbonation (ah, if only some of these could be as lively as Duvel). Flavor is scarcely dusted with dry cocoa, features flesh fruits prominantly, slight banana, and powdered confectioner's sugar. Thickens in impression closer to the finish, shows off a bit of grassy hops and more of a fruit cocktail impression. A little cloying, slight pizza dough and oiliness, well-hidden alcohol on this one."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a tulip. Pours a bright clear gold with tons of carbonation and a finger of lasting white head. Aroma is a nice pale malt with a strong candy sugar and a slightly yeasty and spicey background. Taste has a good deal of grassy hops overlaying a lemon peel, ripe banana, apricot fruitiness. There is a spicy, peppery ending with a hint of the 9% alcohol. Medium bodied with a light crisp mouthfeel. This pales in comparison to some of the great complex Belgian strong ales, but it's solid and drinkable in it's own right."
"Thick and sticky mouthfeel accentuated the feeling of consuming a big special beer. The alcohol was well hidden, and there was almost no burn. The aftertaste was peppery, citric, and sweet. A big beer that does not feel harsh and aggressive, but instead is like a gentle giant carrying you along on his back."
"A lovely cider-colored ale with a frothy, yellowish head which leaves nice lacing. Smells surprisingly thick: notes of chocolate on apricot and hops. The first taste raised the hairs on my arms. Quite hoppy. Quite. Too much so for me, but I can see where one who is a fan of Dogfish's 90-minute IPA would really enjoy this. I do *very* much appreciate the complex pang of sweetness at the finish. I couldn't drink this regularly, but it's worth a try if you're a hop head."
"I found it a little dull for the style - just not as crisp and delicately balanced as it could be. Instead, it seems a bit flabby and uninteresting. There are no flaws, but at the same time it doesn't really go anywhere. It's just a basic, well done, dextrinous, Belgian-style golden ale."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet fruity pale malt and Belgian candy sugar scent along with a Belgian yeast aroma. It is rich and malty with fruity esters. The taste is good. It has a smooth and slightly warm flavor that boasts of pale malts and candy sugar. It goes down easy with quite a bit of hops in the finish; nice touch. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good Belgian ale. It has excellent flavor and aroma. It is a bit hoppier than most, but that's what I like about it."
"poured a hazy golden amber, with a little white head. aroma fruity, peach, pears, and apricot, yeast, and a nice touch of hops. flavor, cinnamon, and a nice blend of fruits orange, peaches, and a hint of cherries, and sweet malts, and some hops and yeast, the alcohol comes out just a little."
"A nice blond colored ale with a large head, served in a snifter. Nice lacing on the glass as I drink. Smell and taste are more hoppy than I'd expect from a Belgian style pale ale, but a nice change from the norm. Lemon citrus and spicey corriander balance out the hops a little, and there's some sweet maltyness to the beer as well. There's an odd soapy character to the beer that I find to be a little bit of a turn off, but otherwise it's a pretty solid brew. I think it might be even better if it was simplified a little."
"Hops are the first thing to hit the taste buds. Mossy, green tea notes, then fresh apricot and sweet pepper relish. Smooth, heavily carbonated beneath a medium-heavy body, but again dry like green tea."
"Pours with a one-finger cream head, fades quickly and leaves no lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is peach/spices. Starts with a sweet, spicey flavor but the alcohol is there, hops are there at the finish. Different from Belgian strong pales but not bad. $6.20 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"No such luck here."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style but this one stands out as a very refined example with the iconoclastic character you would expect from Avery"
"Pours a golden color with a moderate head that falls slowly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of alcohol and sweetness with some graininess and spices as well. Very strong aroma. The flavor has a bit of dark fruit and has a very warming characteristic. The hop/spice blend is interesting, but it's not completely up my alley. It's tasty and very well-crafted, but I like my Belgian slightly different from this. Lots of citrus going along with the spices. The alcohol definately makes this one a sipper. Body is pretty thick and the drinkability is ok."
"($5.49 / 22 oz. bottle capped with gold foil wrap)"
"Overall: given Avery's prediliction for beers with a big, boozy taste (think: Beast), this one is right at home. Still, Salvation comes on too strong in the alcohol department, outstripping the other tastes. to be cosidered a real good example of the style. Not one I'd come back to soon."
"Overall = I can't recommend this beer. Perhaps I just sampled a bad bottle but if not, this one hit me the wrong way on all notes of taste."
"Shared with me by clvand0. It pours a nice golden color with a 2 finger head that falls to one finger. The nose is big, with whiffs of alcohol, slight raisiney sweetness, and a big spiceyness. The flavor is more subdued than the nose/ The raisiney sweetness is backed with a slightly bready ness and a bit of citrusy lemoney moving into the spiceyness. The feel is bigh and thick and full wtih only a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, the flavor is just okay on this one. The alcohol is very well hidden. A nice brew."
"""Brewed with pure Rocky Mounatin water, imported Belgian malted barley, Belgium candy sugar, Styrian Goldings hops, and authentic Belgian yeast."
"22 oz. foil and capped bottle. Pours a clear golden to amber colored with a fluffy beige colored head that turns to sparse clinging foam. Very malty nose; mixed with a hint of pear, and a nutty, estery, and yeasty characteristicts. Mild citrus/hoppy aroma paired up with a faint alcohol whiffs in the finish of the aroma as well. A bit slick on the tongue. The flavor imparts a buttery, slick/sweet malt kick with some more vinous, spicy, fruity, and grassy astringency nearer the finish. A bit peppery in its alcohol presence. Reminds me a bit of a U.S. brewed interpretation of Delirium Tremens. Pretty decent, but a tad bit too sticky."
"Comments - While the beer has complex flavors and is generally pretty appealing, it is not as well balanced as I would like. Maybe this one would do well if it was cellared for a while."
"Crème de rock candy white of 1/8-inch head fluff that gargles down to a fungal coating with light lacing. Liquid gold with a slight edge towards coppering, crystal clear and almost mute. Light lemon, buttermilk, clover scents on nose, but all of it is nicely blended. Clover/mint/cloves mix at start, with some cooling candy chunk; finishes quickly. The iconographic label is cool, and I would grab this before I would The Reverend."
"22 ounce bottle. This was an IPA, perhaps a double IPA. The bottle says Belgian Golden, but there was very little about it that was Belgian. It was a tasty brew nonetheless."
"I wouldn't say this is extremely drinkable, but it is very tasty. I have had Avery's Czar and felt that the alcohol overpowered everything else. I was expected that to happen with this brew, but was pleasantly surprised."
"Taste: Like a few other Avery beers that I have had in the past, the alcohol in this one overpowered the other flavors at times. Luckily, this happened only occasionaly. The majority of the time, things balanced out fairly nicely. When I was able to detect the other flavors, there were sweet apples, tart cherries, and plums. Green grass was present along the sides of the tongue in the middle. The finish was a combonation of strong roasted malt, hops bitterness, and a continuation of the green grass. As I said, sometimes the alcohol overpowered everything. But most of the time, it just lended a pleasant spicy component to the brew. A light pepper flavor lingered into the aftertaste."
"Pours pretty honey colored, rather translucent. 1.5 fingers head, nice and foamy, decent retention. Smells of malts, alcohol, and fruits. Taste is a little crass, not as elegant as it should be. The malts and fruits give way too quickly to a bitter acrid alcohol taste which lingers after you swallow. Could be better, but still pretty good. And, 9% alcohol packs a heavy wallop and I'd drink it again."
"22oz. Bomber: This one pours a darker golden color. There was a limited amount of head on it, and it died off quickly. There is a very apealing aroma to this beer. No one scent is on top, but I get definite notes of apricots, nutmeg, and some yeastiness. The taste is quite slick. There aare the peaches and apricots in there, as well as some spiciness. I like this alot!"
"Truly excelleny mouthfeel and a highly drinkable Belgian Strong."
"Gorgeous bottle, though..."
"Syrupy-looking golden orange in color. Zero head. Big, fruity, malty aromas laced with candi sugar and a moderate dash of spicy hops -- apricot, sugar, and spice. Quite sweet and sugary, this begins with a load of sweet fruit and dried apricot and develops into a slightly more zesty mid palate before closing with sweet, biting alcohol and mild hops. Decent Belgian imitator."
"That said, I find it very drinkable, maybe even dangerously so. I paired this with a simple ham sandwhich. Not bad at all."
"this beer isn't bad, but compared to others in a similar style it leaves much to be desired. good american tripels are few and far between (golden monkey!) and this is no exception. avery is usually quality but i cannot go on the books recommending this."
"Overall Impression: Popped this for a Christmas day treat (the name seemed appropriate), and Im tempted to drain pour the second glass. Belgian style, but not Belgian. Alcohol isnt hidden at all, and doesnt meld well with the beer. I get a raw alcohol aftertaste that is turning my stomach. Its almost vodka like in its intensity. I refuse to endure a beer on Christmas, this one is going bye-bye. Nose is good, initial taste is good, then ick. Not much to look at and the mouthfeel just doesnt do much. A harsh review for Avery Im afraid. Ive enjoyed others, but this one is just wrong, and it is really just the aftertaste."
"Awfully pale in color, but it pours with just enough of a head to be able to keep a stringy lace flowing around the glass. I'm a lace fan. The hops are very sweet, with bits of honey and very ripe tangerines. Hints of candy-like spices and dried fruit sneak through the rest of the beer. Overall, it was very a sweet beer that is light on the taste buds but full of flavors."
"This belgium style goden ale is very good. It pjored a medium deep golden yellow, with no foam or lace. The smell and taste were both of spices, hop's and a mild fruitiness. Not over powering but pleasant to the palate. The only place I could find this Avery brew, was in Colorado."
"Nose is slighty sweet and spicy. Light maltyness up front,snappy,spicy hops also show up on the tongue. Notes of vanilla,anise, ,juniper, alcohol. Belgian yeast phenolics. tasty and dangerously drinkable stuff. Fine, complex brew. Nice bold, Americanized take on the style"
"771"
"Beautiful clear true amber body that catches the light wonderfully and seems to actively glow. The head is smaller and fades more quickly than Id like considering the style, but I cant take off too much for that. Very ripe stone fruit and clove in the aroma. The flavor is dry one sip and sweet the next with a bit of caramel and a bit of dry hay in the malt. The heat of the alcohol is felt, but it doesnt overpower the rest of the beer. Every once in a while I get a wish of sour dishrag, but its not strong and not always there."
"Poured a rich golden/caramel color with about a finger of head from a 22oz bottle. Had some carbonation. It had an average smell with spice overtones. The mouthfeel was excellent - very creamy and went down very smooth. The drinkability was also excellent. You've want to drink several but the 9% ABV will slow you down some. Another great beer from Avery."
"A thick and chewy beer that has an almost barley-wine like quality. A Belgian barley-wine. As Eric Cartman would say, ""Sweeeet."""
"Bright dark yellow in color. A very thin, yet capped off white head. Decent carbonation. Belgium spices, some malts and yeast grace the nose. Very sweet, thick and crisp malt up front. Spicy, great hop bite, some floral and citrus notes as well. The body is very sweet, cotton candy and sugary offerings, very smooth, well rounded and crisp. Yeast-like characteristics are formed in the middle of this beverage, but the hops seem a bit more up front. Hints of alcohol are followed by a decent belly-warming effect. This beer was pretty good, may rank low in it's class of Belgian SPA's, yet that class is already stacked pretty well. The Salvation should be enjoyed by most!"
"This is not my favorite brew from Avery, but it will help to pass the night in a storm. The beer pours a clear, golden color with a small head and little lacing. It has a pleasant aroma of maltiness with hints of clove, anise, and pineapple. The taste is sweeter than most Belgian's of this variety. It is remindful of sugar and cinnamon with a hint of vanilla. The sweetness is evocative of the malt but there isn't a big malt flavor. Little hops bitterness, perhaps a little more would have balanced this and made it more drinkable. After a bomber of it, I was looking for a big IPA to pucker the mouth a little. I like salvation but The Reverend and The Beast."
"Drinkability - Nah, I'll pass. Some interesting and appealing moments, but unless I have another one of these in storage, I wouldn't pursue it again."
"This was medium bodied and was quite flat (very little carbonation at all). The mouthfeel was very smooth with a slightly dry grainy finish. The citrus lingered on the tongue after swallowing. This was a little to strong on the citrus tones which cuts back the drinkability."
"Clear tawny gold in hue, there was no animation; it looked dull aside from a few random floating/suspended yeasties. The head almost reached a finger in height before subsiding to a foamy, loose cap. The retention of the cap was fantastic as it lasted throughout the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was patchy but prevalent. The nose has decent potency; it is strong enough to get its point across. I really like the fruitiness; it is peachy and a little lemony, juicy like a Starburst. The malt shines, it bready and definitely Belgian but I swear it had an English suggestion. Without question the loudest feature of the nose is the candied sugar sweetness, which intermingles ideally with a hint of alcohol. The nose is subdued and quite pleasant. Inviting. At room temperature the complexities are fully bloomed, fantastic! The alcohol, on the palate, stands stark naked thumbing its nose at any sense of mellow, well-crafted flavors. The candied sugar also runs buck wild, which fueled the alcohol Im sure. The sweetness is stiff and raw; it is reminiscent of alcoholic sugar water. The peachy and banana fruitiness cant find a home, I can taste it but I cant place it. It works in harmony with the sweetness and it tries to stand up to the alcohol. Tries is the key word. The malt does find a home towards the finish; it is lovely, very bready with a kiss of biscuit, like an EPA. But dont get me wrong with is a powerful Belgian Golden Ale. Id like a more noticeable hoppiness and less sweetness. This beer is damn good as is but examples like Unibroue 11 or even Duvel blow Salvation out of the water. They are just better crafted. Averys example is complex but forceful, in other words it has been Americanized. The more I quaffed the more the hops were seen, still I need more, also the yeast characteristics grew too, green apples and distant hints of vanilla as well. No matter how soft the flavors got this was still a little too brutish. But it grew on me. Sometimes I like it rough! Full bodied. Low but natural carbonation helps create a pleasant mouthfeel. Even at 9% abv and even thought it is poorly hidden I found this to be very drinkable, sip, savor, repeat until there is no more liquid. I purchased a 22-ounce bottle in Loveland, CO. I should have bought more."
"A good if not great tripel. Some nice sweetness and coriander spicing, but a bit too much alcohol present in the beer. I'd have it again if I saw it around, but wouldn't really actively seek it out."
"It is a drinkable brew, but it is just a bit too dominating a brew to really be drinkable, more like sipable for dessert."
"This beer poured a crystal clear bronzish orange color. The head was white in color but quite weak. Moderate lacing along the glass. The smell was very nice, fruity sweet and bready. The taste was very sweet upfront. I noticed a strong honey flavor initially then a peach fruit sweetness. Yeasty base was light and airy. Hops are quite prevalent towards the end which is odd for a Belgian but the hop bitterness was quite good. The sweetness was a bit cloying but the hop bite threw that off. Finish is dry and smooth. This beer is lighter in body and easy drinking but I probably couldn't have too many because of the sweetness. Definitely a beer worth trying."
"Zum wohl!"
"It pours a glowing clear orange-gold with a white head that dissipates fast. The head is lacking, but the lovely color makes up for it. There is candy sugar, malty grains, a spiciness, and citrus in the aroma. Fruity esters jump out at first in the taste. The body is coating, though not quite syruppy, but almost oily slick. There is also some yeastiness and a light spritzy carbonation. The finish is lightly spicy (styrian goldings are evident) and the alcohol rears its head. A dangerously delicious beer."
"Had this on tap at my neighborhood pub. Overall a good american representation of a belgian trippel. color a light honey amber with a creamy whiteish-beige foam head. Nice clarity and lacing in the glass. Aroma notes of almond, amaretto ,and cloves. Taste of spicy anise and bannas with a subtle hint of alchohol lingering at the finish. body felt a bit thin, and this seemed to affect the clarity of the flavor throughout. I did enjoy this beer and felt that it offered good qualtiy drinkablity for the style."
"Purchased a 22oz. bottle, cellared for about 2 months. Very nice appearance, dark goldish orange color, small amount of puffy, lacey head. Smell is excellent, malty, with hints of nutmeg spice and a touch of hops. Taste is a good balance of malt and the spices, with a little fruitiness, and that noticable high ABV kick. Mouthfeel is distinctly better than average, and drinkability is acceptable. On the whole this is a fairly unique beer, definitely worth trying, and one I'd like to keep around for when I'm in the mood for it."
"Drinkability  This was an exciting ale and definitely closed the night for me. Its a wallop and a half, full of BSPA flavors and spices and very satisfying."
"22 oz brown bottle with beautiful label. Pours a hazy gold colour with a small but tightly knit head of very small bubbles. Head quickly melts into moderate ring lacing. Complex aroma consists of fruity sweetness up front. Bananas and peaches to my nose, along with plenty of bready yeastiness, a hint of spice, and bubblegum from the candy sugar. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Fuzzy carbonation, breadiness, and a whallop of alcohol. Taste is complex, and changes as the goblet warms from cellar to room temperature. Initial taste is of pale and crystal malts, peach, baked bread, bubblegum, earthiness, orangepeel, and alcohol. The Styrian Goldings hops lend a bittering balance to the assault of candy sweetness. At room temperature, this ale becomes very nicely balanced, both in taste and aroma. Overall, an excellent Belgian style ale from the folks at Avery."
"A dark golden ale that pours quite clear with just a bit of foam that settles nicely into cloud-like arrangements of bubbles. Fruity nose mixed with a bit a cooked corn (DMS?) aroma. (The latter is not a good thing.) Smooth mouthfeel. Starts with a bit of bland maltiness, but then gets more interesting as it goes on, with fruiter flavors and then a burst of hops mixed with a sugary sweetness towards the finish. Perceptibly strong. I like the bitter finish. Could be a little more complex up front, but the finish is very long, bitter and laced with alcohol. Finish is almost a bit harsh. Not mind blowing, but pretty tasty, and I would certainly drink it again."
"This is a beautiful golden slightly hazy ale with a white creamy head. Head dies down quickly but leaves a nice layer of foam with subtle retention. Aroma is really hoppy that was unexpected by me. Very fruity with hints of cinnamon and peaches in sugar. Very smooth on the palate and slightly syrupy. Flavor is really nice but a tad sweet. I like the sweet though, and the fruitiness seems to be hanging on to a nice malty bottom. This was one of those surprises that you find in beers sometimes. Not what I expected but quite a pleasure none the less."
"A hazy golden brew, that is quite carbonated. Crowned by a cream colored head. Smells of alcohols and esters. A sharp aroma mixed with a musty fruity character. Soft tasting, fairly mellow compared to what I was expecting from the aroma. A bit of alcohol in the finish is detectable, along with a slight mustiness as well. The beer is fruity with notes of apple, maybe a hint of apricot. There is a bit of a sharp edge here too, a combination of the carbonation and fermentation byproducts. This is pretty good stuff, though it is a bit on the thick-bodied side of things."
"Deep amber golden with an off white honey tinted head creamy texture slightly rocky, leaves behind nice webbed pattern of lacing. Aroma: Rich honey like malt character with a bready yeasty notes, not as complex and fruity as most Belgian style ales. Taste: Flavor rich compex honey, bready, very sweet alcohol with some phenolic tones. Mouthfeel: Fuller bodied chewy mouthfeel syrupy as all hell, a bit cloying not to keen on the sensation it inflicts on my palate. Drinkability: Is somewhere in the middle this is not a Piraat, La Fin du Monde, or Duvel but it's decently tasty anyway you slice it just lacking some crucial elements present iin most belgian style strong ales."
"Murky orange color with a smallish light khaki head. Fruity, sweet, and slightly spicey smell. Tangerine, apricot and peach come through in the aroma with a very subtle hop presence. This beer shows more fruit than more traditional Belgian goldens (interpret very loosely). Pale malts, peach, apricot, and a hint of orange are the governing flavors of this ale. There is definitely a sweetness imparted by candi sugar. Also, there is a very pleasant spiciness imparted by the hops. The beer is rather thick and lacks an effervescence and crispness that I expected. The mouthfeel is closer to a strong dark ale than a golden ale."
"There are many complexities in this amazing, highly underrated brew. Avery consistently puts out some high quality brews, but I am highly impressed with this offering. This is everything I am looking for in a Belgian Golden (I find most to be highly carbonated with a thin body) I could see this one aging very nicely, as the hop rate is a tad high for the style and would benefit from mellowing a year or two."
"Another underrated beer. Maybe I am not experienced enough with the style to appreciate it. But if Unibroue put out the same beer it would get rated better. Pours a golden hue with a nice white head yeasty, and spicy, and very smooth, sweet but no sweeter than alot of others. ABV is impossible to detect. Another solid offering from Avery. I hope people start giving Avery a little more respect."
"Medium body and it drinks well. Not the smoothest ale I have had but well made."

"Flavor: The taste is sweet. This is an enjoyable beer to drink"
"Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity, touches of apricot and peach. A fuller bodied Belgian Ale. Sweet and fruity; peaches, apricots, pineapple, sweet malts and vanilla. Very fizzy carbonation. Touch of candy sugars? Hops are very prominent, floral and citrusy. Very hoppy for a Belgian Ale, but it seems to work somehow. Very smooth taste, hides the 9% alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"Easily drinkable despite the high alcohol content. Not the equal of true ales from Belgium but one of the better attempts I've found from this side of the pond."
"p.s. - A very (no pun intended) superbly crafted, intricate label...reminiscent of 16th century illuminated manuscripts."
"I think this is a nice enough blonde strong ale. The alcohol is a little too obvious and detracting."
"Orange in color with a thinninsh hea, and a quite attractively designed bottle. Aroma is malt-dominated, sweet, and very fruity, with hints of orange, honey, and corriander. Fruit shows up in the taste as well, which is led by the flavor of Belgian candi sugar, develops a slightly bready character, and ends with a mild citric hop flavor and an alcohol spiciness. Well-carbonated body keeps things tingly throughout to counteract the overall sweetness of the beer, especially at the finish which is slightly dry. Good beer -- but where's the yeast? Why make a Belgian-style Golden without bottle conditioning?"
"A pellucid amber color on the pour, the head immoderate in size, spumescent in texture, and the color a light tan and as it vanishes a thick glutinous sheet survives to conceal the glass. Big malt nose, citrus crisp and fresh, quite pleasing to the senses and the start thickly sweet malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a spicy hop bite that pleases the palate, the acidity moderate to mild, the aftertaste droughty, and in my humble opinion another winner from Avery."
"Pours a beautiful coppery gold color that is exceptionally clear. The head is Blonde thick and long living. The nose is very fresh and fruity, inviting. I am imressed that this comes from Colorado. The flavor is very belgian in deed. It is sweet malt that has complex and interesting spicy undertones. The hops are somewhat noticeable but aren't the most intriguing part of this beer. The flavors are just bursting from all directions. The re is malt and spice and everything nice. This is damn near excellent - but not quite. These people are on the right track."
"Pours a gorgeous golden orange color with a chunky, sticky, slightly orange-yellow head. Very few bubbles can be seen ascending through the beer. Very inviting nose with aromas of fruity Belgian malt and spicy hops. As it warmed the fruit came more into focus. Candy sweet up front followed by spicy alcohol and pumpkin and finishes a tiny bit drier with the emphasis on peppery hops and dehydrated mango. This was a pretty bull bodied beer with a slick mouth feel and petite carbonation. The alcohol certainly played a huge part in the flavor profile of the beer, yet there were no discouraging retro nasal fumes or off flavors. If this beer were distributed in my area I would certainly get it again. Thanks to TXHops."
"A Very Good Offering."
"Moderately hard pour into a goblet produced a thin and short-lived head. Murky apricot color. Surpisingly agressive hop aroma, more than expected for the style. Flavor tended to favor pitted fruits - apricots, peaches and plums. Cold, the beer again displayed a rather heavy handed hoppyness. As the beer warmed, the hops faded into the background, but continued to lend a sharp bitterness to the finish throughout. Alcohol became more prominent with warming, adding a raw, solvent note. Overall, this struck me as an American interpretation of the style rather than an attempt at re-creation. It seemed the beer was trying to do many things with the flavor, but none of them particularly well."
"I'd like to see this as an unfiltered beer but the filtering does provide for a nice clean color of the beer."
"Pours a hazy orange golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a nice lace. Nose is fruity with notes of apricot, peach, and a bit of spice. Its quite crisp with a fine carbonation. Taste is sweet fruits and a bit of candied sugar with some spicy notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Finish is clean and crisp. Not the best of the style, but still a pretty good brew."
"Dark golden color with a medium thick milky-white head. Nice effervescence. Alternating fruity and hoppy aroma. Nice tart flavor of herbs and spices and hops. Surprisingly easy to drink as well. $6 a bottle around here but this was actually worth it."
"It's gold with a fairly thick and sticky white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass.  The smell is slightly sweet with a hint of must.  It also has a slight medicinal smell with noticeable alcohol.  The taste is pleasant but it's a bit off for the style.  Up front, the flavor is sweet but the hops do kick in for a nice little surprise.  They didn't seem to skimp on the use of candi sugar and the taste of it is quite pronounced; however, despite the lack of subtlety, it's an enjoyable drink."
"Cool-ass bottle, though."
"Hazy gold with a smallish white head.  There's sweetness up front in the nose and palate that lead to a little more pronounced hoppiness than I expect in this style (and not the right hop flavor at that).  As with this brewer's attempt at a quad, where's that musty, yeasty complexity that's so identifiable with Belgian beers?  A moderate amount of carbonation, but not enough for the style, either.  A bit disappointing, this Avery product seemed more like a pumped-up (alcohol-wise) American pale ale."
"The initially thick, creamy, white settles into a thin but persistant lace laving layer. The aroma is comprised of honey - like sweetness upfront and in ensued by phenol and solvent - like fusels and an odd hint of acetone. Sweet, and slightly cidery in flavor, w/ peppery alcohol flavors and clove. Thinly bodied and almost dry from the high apparent attenuation. Copious use of light candi sugar or dextrose is quite evident in the very warming alcoholic finish. Although a decent brew, Salvation seemed a bit rough, lacking the deceiving smoothness and complexity of other Strong Goldens. That acetone (nail - polish) note in the aroma is a bit offputting. Although I'm a bit dissapointed, I will gladly finish the bottle."
"This beer poured a copperish golden color.  Formed a very light white head which left some nice lace.  Slight citrus and malt aroma to it with a slight hint of alcohol.  Alot of carbonation which is common for this style.  Taste was of light citrus and malt with some alcohol present.  Not the best representation of this style."
"Ok this ""Belgian Stong Golden"" would never be mistaken for a true Belgian but it has great flavor none the less. Slightly fruity, good malt flavor, appripriate alcohol intensity, but just a little too much Goldings. The hop flavor is nice and works well with the beer over all but if they were going for a true Belgian style I think they went just a tad too far. I found myself going back for more (more than once) and it is definately a worthy beer."
