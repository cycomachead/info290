"Lightly hazy deep straw with hints of wine yellow if that makes any sense. Fruity earthy spicy aromas and flavor. Interesting brew a bit outside of the box. I enjoyed this more than its counterpart."
""
""
"Pours a stunning dark golden color with just a faint haze.  The aroma is muted but smells vaguely of yeast and lees.  The flavor has a lot of grape to it, subtle floral elements and a Belgian yeast funk.  Alcohol is kept at bay for the most part, and this is a refreshing option.  Full bodied, well carbonated feel with a slight dryness.  Overall, this is a good ale but seems to lack direction in the smell and taste."

"Overall- A phenomenal beer. The presence of the grapes is immediately noticeable, but yet not overwhelming, in every aspect of the beer. A great use of subtle yeast and hop profiles to compliment the grape flavors in the forefront."

"Very smooth creamy medium body with medium high very finely bubbled carbonation."

"Damn fine beer - looks great in the glass, billowing head and thick creamy lacing. There's just the perfect amount of funk to the nose and taste, wonderful sweet vinegar presence as well as dark ripe fruit - plums come to mind. Creamy mouthfeel. This is an amazing beer that would appeal to most anyone, great entry to sours for the novice and enough complexity for the purist. Wonderful brew."

"Very pale like a witbier with billowing head. Has a little funky/barnyard smell but overall the scents are subtle. It has a very well balanced taste profile. You get a touch of sour, some funk, a little sweetness, a little booziness and finishes with a slight hop bitterness. Overall its an easy drinking 9% brew and has alot going on. It didn't quite give me the WOW factor but its definitely at that level just on the cusp of a world class brew but not quite there. Allagash makes another very solid / outstanding beer."
""
""
"Overall, I felt the grape was far too prominent and the beer was far too sweet. This combination just didn't work well for my tastes. It is well-made, but not one I have to have."

"A pretty decent and unique that I will probably pick up again if I can find it on sale."

"Overall: Very good Belgian pale ale. The grapes add some nice additional complexity without overwhelming the base beer. Worth picking up a bottle."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid and flavorful Belgian-style beer to drink for a long time."
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is well hidden and the fruit sweetness really makes this one easy to drink. Very enjoyable and one I will happily drink again."

"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a slightly hazed, bright orange-gold coloring with a thin, whispy, filmy coating on the surface. Some slow carbonation throughout the body present while you drink. Aromas of toasted grains, sweet and tart grape, and some berry sweet and bubblegum from the Belgian yeast. Flavors are light and effervescent from the crisp body and carbonation. Toasty grain backbone with white wine characteristics, both in dry sweetness and booze kick. Like a dry Pinot Gris. Some of the funky character from the yeast shines through, but not much. Pretty well balanced palate, maybe slightly leaning to the dry side. The aftertaste also has the wine-like feel, with a dry, fruity grist flavoring. Dry and smooth finish, with a slight sweet and tart linger. Interesting and unique beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2009 vintage. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big white grape, grape skin, pear, apple, honey, floral, apricot, grass, herbal earthiness, white wine, light black pepper, light funk, and light yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt notes and yeast esters. Taste of big white grape, pear, apple, apricot, honey, floral, grass, herbal earthiness, light pepper, white wine, light black pepper, light funk, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal earthiness, light funk, and white wine on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of malt/yeast esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Strong pale ale. Great flavor balance and complexity of malt and yeast esters; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"This brew poured with a barely there white head on a clear, yellow body. Mild carbonation was visible in the body. The nose had a hint of tartness, and this is where the chardonnay grapes became apparent. On the taste, it definitely had a lot of Belgian yeast to it, which was quite tasty. The grapes were also very apparent in the taste, but not cloying or overly sweet. The sweetness was just enough to be pleasant. The mild carbonation really complemented the lighter than expected body. I also got hints of pear and apricot as I sipped more on the brew. The finish was quick and sweet. What also surprised me was how high the booze was on this bad boy. It was completely and totally hidden. I would definitely have this beer again!"

"To me, this came off almost as an attempt of cloning or at least imitating a Temptation or Damnation, and while decent in its own right, it wasn't nearly as good as those two."
""
"O: Delicious. Interesting and complex, with a simple dominating chardonnay grape presence. Pairs amazingly with cheese. I took home 5 bottles from the brewery, so you can say I like it!"
"Reviewed from notes. The beer pours an orange color with a large white head. The aroma is heavy on the white wine notes, with some nice orange and other tropical fruit notes coming through. The flavor is more of the same. I get some biscuit and wheat notes, as well as some orange and chardonnay grape notes. There is a lot of fruit in the beer, and a decent amount of sweetness and Belgian yeast. The alcohol is well hidden. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"This definitely leans more towards the wine side but is a solid offering nonetheless. If you're a white wine fan this is for you."
""
"Pours a hazed yello straw, light bubbly head, little spots of retention. Scent leads with a sweet and tart fruit component, biscuity malt, some herbal and earthy qualities. Taste tones down the fruit a bit and focuses it more on the grape notes, decent grain profile, some leafy and herbal notes. Medium bodied, lightly bubbly. Slightly better than the Victor as it tones some bold flavors down and blends them well."

"Pours a hazy yellow with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and some light jelly/jam fruity aromas. Taste is the same with some herbal flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."

"O - Overall, this is a good beer from Allagash just not worth anywhere near the $19.99 price tag for it in MA."

"I am a big fan of Belgian-style pale ales, and I think this is a superb one. At 9%, it is not so strong as some other BPAs. This beer would be a good low alcohol substitute for a 14-15% chardonnay, and you could definitely use this to wean a white wine drinker into beer. Aging has not hurt it; I think I'll buy a few more and lay them down for a couple years. It is a bit pricey at around $18, but it is as worthy in MHO as Cantillon lambics made with white grapes, which I also adore; this is taking a belgian golden ale in the same direction, but with a bigger malt body and nice creamy carbonation that is a great meld of a golden ale and grapes."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. As a fairly avid wine drinker as an active beer advocate (though my love for beer far transcends that of wine), I think this is an excellent hybrid between the two alcohols. It starts with an aggressive grape note, but from the middle to finish, the beer has time to develop its own complexities and flavors, so overall I don't feel one side dominates over the other. I could see someone who doesn't enjoy wine (especially white wines) not particularly enjoying this beer, as the start of the beer and the dry finish is ripped directly from white wine, but those who enjoy white wine could definitely jump into this beer."
"Overall good...but yeah...not for $17."
"D - Overall, this beer drank well; I think it could have used a bit less of the leathery smell and taste; could have used more lemony or spicy flavor to it; glad to have tried it, but would pass on the next one"
"At the price point? There are better things to buy for the money. Still, quite good."
"jd"
"O - Not really my thing, reminded me too much of the DFH Ancient Ales that use grape juice and honey. Once you've had one of those, they all kinda taste the same."
"O:Would not order this again unless I was assured this was a suboptimal batch."
"Sampled on June 3, 2011 at the American Craft Beer Festival. It had a kind of pale yellow-olive pour with a moderate head. The aroma had a hint of grape but more of a yeast and spice note. The taste also had a vague green grape flavor with a nice spicy and malty character. Overall, a beer that is worth having again."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I actually like how the flavor and aroma change as the beer warms us, especially since nothing about it ever gets one-dimensional. I actually think that I like this beer a little better than the Victor, which is a little surprising for me as I typically favor the darker side of things, but this is a really nice beer overall. If you like Dupont Moinette Blond, I don't think that you would be disappointed in this beer as they share some characteristics in hops especially."
"D: I was expecting more complexity from this beer, especially at $18 per bottle. It is a bit more subdued than the Victor Ale from the same brewery, but the basic taste is dissapointingly similar. I would not buy another one of these bottles, especially at this price. Try it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you..."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. drink well - goes down easily - although the grapes tend to wear on you after a while."
"D - Very easy to drink and yummy."
"The nose had a ton of green grapes in it. The flavor was very spicy and dry like a chardonnay. I never thought I use that word in a review. It has a light feel to it with all kinds of carbonation. It was drinkable but not my favorite Allagash."
"Doesn't really stand out much from other Allagash offerings but it's not bad. I'd go with Curieux or just the White before getting this again though."
"D: Not what I'd call my favorite Allagash beer, but it's undeniably drinkable."
"very nice flavor, the grapes are used well. the carbonation grasps at the tongue, thrusting grape and malt, and some well hidden alcohol into its cavities. Medium dry, surprised this actually isn't sweeter. The finish is outstanding. This is impressive."
"D: Drinks like a chardonnay, but there's a lower abv than the actual wine counterpart, so i suppose this is good for drinkability. No alcohol is present at all, even as it warms to room temperature."
"Highly drinkable for the style; great light body which is dangerous for the ABV. For what it's worth, not exactly cheap though."
"Pours a shade of gold with a white head. Nose brings some wood, spice, grape, and some stone fruits. The taste is quite taken over by the grapes, taking away some of the nose's nuances. Feel is somewhat dry. Drinks okay, but like with the Victor, I think the grapes ended up being too large a component in the beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it. I liked the complexity the grapes added and they also didn't overpower the beer. A very cool and well made beer."
"Much like a good bottle of wine, the 9.00%abv is very nicely hidden. The taste is a touch too sweet to get a perfect score here, but it is still definitely drinkable. Grab one if you have the chance. It's a different kind of beer, for sure."
"D- I really enjoyed this brew. Super cool cross over between beer and wine. I like."
"Not going to write too much here - StephenRich just wrote the most insanely impressive review ever, and his is right below mine - so check that out. In any case, this was a nice, solid Allagash ""big beer," that didn't quite reach the heights of the Interlude, Odyssey, or Fluxus. Just a kind of standard (but still very tasty) Belgian flavor, with lots of sugar, candy, citrus, and a touch of yeast. Overall, good, but maybe not worth the price tag (not when you could go with a La Chouffe or Gouden Carolus for cheaper)."
"That was really the power of the beer; lots of amazing flavors and aromas, but all very light and soft perfectly balanced in an orchestra of musical flavor. Allagash won the game for me with this one, and I will seek out more of their beers now for my cellar. The Victoria I expect would pair nicely with a wide range of soft or funky cheeses, croissants, smoked salmon or light fish, or lightly herbed rack of lamb."
"D: This was a nice pale Belgian with good complexity and clean taste. It had a more enjoyable balance of flavors than most of the style, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. The body could have been a bit better, but this was otherwise a solid beer."
"D - interesting concept...the fruits unfortunately dont meld as well as they could. i can pick out some grapes more as it warms, but by that time i was about ready to move on to something else."
"Advertised as a beer brewed with grapes, the first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was a grape aroma. Smells similar to champagne. It is a brown beer with a weak head, perhaps from the aging process. It has a great taste, complex flavor with a good mix of wine-like undertones and a nice beefy malt. Light on hops, it is like they replaced the hops with grapes. Sadly, there is not much in the way of head which is what the low marks on appearance are for. Kind of a little flat for my taste, but overall it is interesting and fairly well done."
"At the Allagash promo at the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington NJ: poured into a chalice, a clear yellow, with two fingers of bright white lace, and good lacing. Very berry fruity, candy sweet, and an essence that reminded of Willy Wonka candy (e.g. Gobstoppers, Nerds). The taste was very berry sweet, tempered by a touch of sour, dissolving to a dry finish. Very thin and spritzy. Despite the high (and well-hidden) alcohol content, a nice refreshing summer option."
"D: I don't know, for some reason I found this the pinnacle of drinkability. Good flavours, quite refreshing. I liked it a lot, but not in the upper echelon of Belgian & Belgian-style beers."
"D- A very easy-drinking strong pale; not overly complex, but still very enjoyable."
"Very drinkable beer, glad i got to try it!"
"Overall. this beer is decent for a BSPA. I think the category has a slight disadvantage because it has a lot of flavor and is Belgian, but it is not sour. Allagash seems to have done a great job with the style. The grapes added a nice touch to this beer."
"City Beer Store, Allagash night. Very nice looking beer, like champagne with a foam head that refused to quit. I'm continually impressed with Allagash's clean grain flavors that seem to act as a base for complex Belgians. It makes their beers seem more true to the native Belgian ales. Anyway, the grapes are definitely noticeable but quite pleasant and not cloying. They give the beer a vinous malt quality, much more subtle than expected. Good Belgian yeast notes, earthy and dry. Champagne-ish carbonation with lots of small vigorous bubbles. A happy surprise for me."
"M / D - There's a good carbonated mouthfeel, I would have liked it to be a bit drier on the palate. It's a bit too sweet to want to drink another glass."
"D: This bottle was killed pretty quickly by myself and my girlfriend. She really enjoyed it. Makes a fantastic wine substitute if you want to shake things up at a dinner party. Great flavors that just work so well with the aromas. My only complaint is the carbonation and the alcohol being a bit too much in the aroma, flavor and feel. All in all though, just a great beer. Tastes are so on point and enjoyable. I will buy this again, even at that price."
"Thanks Jeremy & Karen."
"Pours a clear bright golden colored body, with a big foamy white head, lasting. Fruity fresh aroma, light grapes, and dark grapes. Some grain smell, mustiness too, like horseblanket or something. Not too strong, though. Grapey taste, fruity, with a strong grape aftertaste. Light and crisp tasting. Some warmness, and a lot of carbonation. Light taste, not heavy, not alcoholy. Alright, light flavor, grapey."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a hazy, darker golden yellow. It has a fairly decent sized off white head on it. There is quite a bit of effervescence going on in the glass. The aroma is quite nice. Yeasty, bready, grains, and fruitiness that almost smells like it could be coming from a chardonnay. The taste is excellent. It is somewhat sweet. The fruits are there, but they have merged into a unique flavor. Spices and a hint of caramel also. There is a bit of fiziness on the tongue. Medium bodied. An excellent brew."
"This is a solid Belgian ale that goes down super fast and easy. It's not the most complex or tasty version of the style, but it is one of the most drinkable. Excellent."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. I had this on draft. Pours a hazy gold with a thick white head. Aroma of candi sugar, light yeast, and wheat. Flavor of light wheat malts followed by candi sugar and sweet fruits. Overall, I found this to be very nice and refreshing."
"The barrel aging is very subtle, but seems to add a bit of complexity. More wood and dryness would be better."
"This is a really interesting beer, and definitely reminds me of a wine. I would recommend this to anyone, and something that would appeal to wine drinkers as well."
"This was a really, really interesting beer. I thought it was very well done and refreshing. I'd be very interested in trying something similar in the future."
"D: More of a novelty than anything else. A nice beer, but one that maxes out toward the end of the glass."
"D- Very drinkable. I hardly even noticed that this was a 9% beer, drinks more like a 5-6%er. A great beer for pairing with many types of food. My glass was gone before I knew it. Im interested in seeing how a bottle of this stands up but im sure it pales in comparison with this tap version."
"taste is light yet crisp, fruity, tad bit of sweetness comes through, some caramel, pear, and some spice."
"Drinkability: Fairly enjoyable and drinkable but the 9% ABV and overall sweetness keep this from getting a higher mark."
"Drinkability: This disappeared much faster than it should have, delicious brew."
"I had to try this beer, since it bears my name... Taste is Fruity spice with a slight hint of wine. Aroma of bananas, black pepper and mint are infused in this light tasting offering. Big ABV here, I don't think I can drink a lot of this, resembles more of a wine that a beer, can't even call this a barleywine...But worth the try."
"It's a solid example of the style. The grape adds a dry finish to this ale. Otherwise, it's pretty solid for the style. You could cellar it as well as it is no longer being brewed."
"This is a very interesting beer, one that I would be glad to have more if it had not been discontinued."
"Another one I sampled at the Beverage Warehouse, beside the Victor. Out of a bottle this brew was a slightly hazy amber/peach color with a slightly yellow-tinted head. The retention as a cap was good and the lacing very nice. The aroma was similar to the Victor, dry and bready malt, Belgian yeast, fruit esters, orange and grapes with some alcohol heat. The flavors were very similar but I liked it better than the Victor. Lots of orange and more fruity sweetness was the primary difference aiding in how drinkable I found it. I also thought the alcohol was better hidden. It reminded me of a rose champagne, fruity, highly carbonated and fizzy in the mouth only with a malty complexity. The body was medium and it was dry and rather acidic. Still expensive for what it was and not Allagash's best offering."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange colour, like juice, with a thin egg shell head forming, drops a bit of lace and drops to a thin ring rather quickly. Smell is neat, grapes, some wine, bready, wood, lightly sour fruits, apricots, a little musty, sweet and sugary. Taste is similar, some caramel and bready malts up front, grapes and a wine sharpness, vanilla and oak, some orange peel, malty finish, and a bit yeasty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, pretty neat. The wine doesn't come through as good as I expected, but this was a pretty solid beer."
"Date consumed: 2 October 2008"
"Hazy and an orange/peach colour, this beer poured with a yellow/beige cap that formed some clumpy lacing that really stuck to the glass. Aromas were bready and yeasty, quite fruity with grapes and ripe oranges, delicate spices and a bit of alcohol. Mild bitterness, fruity peaches, malt and honey, biscuit and bread, with sweet apricots and light spice in the finish. Just a bit of alcohol flavour and warmth. Plenty of carbonation, medium bodied, a tad coarse in texture until the carbonation settled down. Pretty good. I'd gladly have this again."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a small head that settled into nothingness, flat. The aroma is sweet, apricot, coriander, honey and green apple. The taste is of tropical fruit and coriander. Big spice profile, perhaps some white pepper. Some honey notes as well. I don't really pick up the white grapes as I did on the Victor. The brew has a moderate body, prickly carbonation, sweet and a bit sticky. A spicy BSPA for sure. Not really my bag but others might like it. I preferred the Victor over the Victoria."
"drinkability is good. neat, with a nice balance. interesting stuff."
"Notes from 5/4/06"
"The aroma is kind of weak for a strong ale but there is definitely a fruity grapeness with yeast and malt and very little or no hops. The appearance is cloudy with gold color and a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall this is really good."
"a cloudly, very light amber color... almost saison like. a sufficent head. not a lot but consistent. no lace. smell of apricot, astrigent, hop and grape esters... like that of a grape juice... not minerally but tangy with a light malt. the malt is with the grape tangy where as the hop is with the herbal quality... heavy thyme. quite crisp and dry. the crispness isn't a dry mineral sensation as the grape seems to lack the quality of the skin. it more subdued and exposed in the herbal effect. this beer lack the earth to be fantastic. its great but by way of two very separate things the hop dryness and the malt tangy all very crisp but this is lost in the high alcohol content. great with food... not back only. i would highly recommend game birds."
"HV"
"I could kill a few of these before they hammer the nails into my coffin! Nah, I'll stick around and drink them during poker (so what if I lose all my money)."
"Pours a golden amber with a finely beaded head that is quite healthy. Fades to a ring. Sweet, very ripe grapes followed by some Belgian yeast tang and some light citrusy bitterness in the aroma. The taste has more of that extreme grape flavor going on, especially up front. Sweet, ripe grapes followed by a spicy, fizzy, aftertaste with hints of clove and fennel as well as some late earthy bitterness. Up front this almost tastes like Most- the Austrian drink of wine that is not fully fermented, but the finish tastes more like a more herbal version of a tripel. Mixed reaction to this one at my house. I think it is somewhat unusual, and fairly pleasant, but by no means would this make my regular to drink list. I've actually had this a few times now but neglected to review it. I'm probably done with this at this point."
" I think the addition of grapes adds some nice complexity and despite a 9% abv it's very refreshing in the summertime."
"D - absolutely great! This is a superb beer. I almost wish I weren't sharing the bottle with my gf, but I'm sure I can get more at Green's and I'm glad we're enjoying it together. Highly recommended. Allagash hits this one out of the park."
"Slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a hint of orange. Nice white head, moderate lacing, which could have been better. mellow head retention. Mild grape tones with some sweet pale malts. honey. some chardonnay flavors, spicy, tart, yet subtle. Low to medium body. active carbonation within the beer. a little dry, but crisp. very drinkable. downside of the strong alcohol burn."
"Another very nice beer from Allagash."
"Drinkability is ok and I could probably drink the whole bottle by myself but I would rather share it and drink a better beer next instead. Its a good beer but not worth the $17 I paid for the 750ml bottle."
"This is a good beer, but the yeast character overpowers a lot of budding nuance. Worth a try, now I've got to get some Victor!"
"Taste has a rather tart sweetness yet finishes sharply (most likely a result of the grapes), lots of spiciness going on such as clove, good carbonation amount for the style, the strength is well hidden behind the fruit and spice of the beer."
"Atlanta ale meeting. All but drunk, I swished some samples around after seeing and smelling. Creamy mouthful and grapiness mixed in the yeast.Sweetish from the much chardonnay grapes.And with that it is more wine than beer, but there are not wines around that brew with beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish, yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, it was all white grapes. In the taste, Belgiany sugar and a dry white grape. A sweet fruity and bitter moouthfeel and a semi-dry fruity aftertaste. Great flavor, fantastic grape presence. Hide alcohol very well."
"D- This beer has a nice smooth wheat sweetness to it with a good balance from the hops. The flavors are not as concise as typically malt and hops flavors but have more of a mystery to them."
"Super easy to drink, and very tasty."
"Drinkability- Seems more like an imperial wit if there is such a thing. Overall really tasty, but the price was a bit steep...$13.99 at a store where prices are very good...I've seen it for as much as $17.99. Maybe a good $9.99 bottle of so."
"Was this good? Yes. Altogether a solid offering. Was this worth $16? No, you can find better for quite a bit less."
"This beer works from a refreshing standpoint when cold and, if warmer, really shows the white grapes used to brew it. A good beer from Allagash. I prefer a few of there other offerings but I would drink this again."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a big foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet white grape juice with some Belgian malt and some yeast. Taste is sweet with a nice mix between Belgian style malt and a yeasty finish. I couldnt really pick-up the taste of grapes in there. Body was above average with some good carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. Overall, this is an interesting beer but definitely not the best from this fine brewer."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost cloudy amber color. Grape?? nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is grape/hops, not sweet, slight tin finish. Grapes and malt don't mix. High ABV is hidden. Not worth $15.59 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Reminiscent of Midas Touch to me. This one straddles the fence between beer and the beyond. Fruit characters lead the way here, though not the Chardonnay I was expecting."
"Allagash is not only the best brewery in the state of Maine, it's one of the best breweries in America and in the world at large. In fact, in my humble opinion, there are only a handful of Belgian brewers who are as accomplished and as consistent. Victoria Ale may not be the best BSPA that I've ever had, but it's within sight of the leaders. Thanks hopsaplenty."
"$13 a bottle, wow!! Pours cloudy golden color. Smells quite sweet like dried fruit. Tastes less like that, more just sweet malt, quite yeasty too, quite a bit of yeasty aftertaste too, but not overwhelming. Overall, it's good not great. Not worth the $13 that it's priced at. I can get La Fin du Monde or even Allagash Four for half the price of this, which I will continue to do."
"This beer poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that settled. The smell was mild grape skins with a slight sweetness that became more pronounced as it warmed. There was also a Belgian maltiness. The taste was lightly tart grape skins with Belgian malt and light hoppiness. There was a faint flavor of tannins. Overall the flavors were somewhat subtle. The mouthfeel was very dry with medium body and very pronounced carbonation (frothy). The sweet maltiness and grape skin flavors lingered. This was a good and enjoyable beer, but with subtle flavors."
"Despite my comments regarding the heft of this beer, this has disappeared remarkably fast from my glass. Something about it is definitely drinkable, though I still would not say it is quaffable. I think it might be the acidity here, there is just enough to not allow the sweetness to become overbearing and actually it keeps it quite manageable. I definitely think this would be much better at a slightly lower alcohol content; at 6% or even 7% this would be quite a bit easier to drink and would actually be more in line with what one typically expects from a Chardonnay grape. This is definitely a hard one to judge, on its individual components I would score this quite highly, and even overall I am enjoying it, but I don't think it is as good as it objectively seems."
"I loved this beer from the noisy pour to the fantastic sweet honey and rich complex fruit scents. The taste was not as good as the smell but this may be due to its youth. It was a bit too sweet but a year or two should round it out. Still it is a well done rich flavorful tasty belgian style ale that many would be envious of. This one is going back on the want list. Thanks to Brewfan for this."
"Somewhat murky orange body with a couple of fingers of offwhite head that dissipates a bit more quickly than expected. Smells yeasty, citrusy, and somewhat spicey. Tastes citrusy, malty, and spicey. Medium bodied. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV... Very enjoyable! Kudos once again, Allagash!"
"D: The 9% abv is well hidden here, allowing the fruit and spices to shine. A well made beer indeed."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Head gets reinforcements in small constant bubbles rising form the bottom of the glass, and lasts accordingly, with delicate lacing. Aroma is slightly spicy sweetness, with effervescent notes. Taste is moderate maltiness upfront, with spicing coming on, and a dry lightly fruity close. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy over the tongue, and drinkability is very nice for the abv. A nice addition to the Allagash family of products."
"The taste is fantastic, starts syrupy on the palate with honey, sweet prune and figs, followed by a hint of hop bittterness that helps put this malty masterpiece in check. The finish is warming alcohal, grass, some wheat earthiness abound. This is a fantastic Belgian Strong worth every penny."
"Another good offering from Allagash and a good ""big"" summer beer. Alcohol is apparent, buts its carbonation and body keep this beer drinkable."
"Another interesting brew from Allagash. I still use their outstanding Triple as the benchmark, but this one is another example of what you can do with a traditional style. Worth a try for sure."
"Golden orange body with a nice tall eggshell white head. Aroma was a bit strange with sweet grapes and biscuit malt coming on strong. Very light spiciness and yeast. Biscuits, yeast and spiciness over a pretty big sweetness in the flavor. Light alcohol peaked though. Fruity notes and a big sweet finish. Not bad but it was a bit overly sweet. Well carbonated and has some trailing warmth on the way down. Easy enough drinking and comes off pretty mild. Unique brew that would be interesting to see what a bit of age does for it."
"Drinkability & Notes  For a big beer on a hot night this is still an easy beer to drink, the 85% attenuation really helps the drinkability. Another tasty experimental batch from the good people at Allagash."
"The relatively high alcohol content was certainly not very noticable beyond the warming effect."
"Smooth, creamy, delectable mouthfeel. No signs of alcohol in the nose or mouth so I think it would be rather easy to drink a few to many of these before it knocked you down."
"Split with dirtylou during his stay in Raleigh...review entered from notes taken."
"Not the absolute triumph that Interlude was, but a very intriguing beer nonetheless. I would buy more if I could get it in VT or NH."
"drinkability: above average"
"It seems Allagash just doesn't know how to disappoint. It's something different, and done well, no surprise considering the track record in place. With a muscular ABV it warms and even numbs, but enjoyed wisely the grain and grape combo drinks pleasingly. I'm all for pushing the envelope, but it's always refreshing to see a brewery that dares to experiment without having to go over the top."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The vinous qualities create an interesting kicked up witbier. This is a very interesting and tasty beer. The alcohol is well covered up in both the smell and the taste."
"This is one incredibly complex brew. Lots of things going on here.... take time to appreciate and savor it."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"This pours a honey orange color with a large foamy head. The smell has a grape aroma along with a yeast ""bisquity"" scent. The taste has a fruity quality to it, as expected, along with some bakery flavors. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well with the high alcohol hidden very nicely. This is a good beer, but nothing really too exciting. Still, I would have this again."
"Mouthfeel is yeasty, doughy, with vanilla, and citrus clinging to the palate."
"I plan to let the other one cellar for 6 months and see if it changes in any way. An interesting beer - love it or leave it I think."
"Is this beer interesting? Yes. But the flavors do not meld together well; there's a reason that beer is made from grains, wine from grapes, and the that two remain separate. The influence of the grapes on the beer adds some interesting notes in the aroma department, but the overall effect is a bit gross... way too sweet, with a bit of a chemical tinge, this beer is unsatisfying, and not worth the price you'll probably pay. In the interest of seeking out unique beer experiences, I recommend giving this brew a try, but it's not something I'd go back to, that's for sure. I'm sad to say it, but it's the truth."
"but its not something I would go out of my way to find."
"I am biased when it comes to Allagash. I think they brew interesting, tasty beers, and this is no exception. I had a 750ml bottle all for myself. After pouring the first glass, I let the bottle come to more of a room temperature. The beer was a cloudy orange with a medium head. The smell was mostly sweet fruit. The taste was fruity, somewhat tart, with a little hoppiness. I'm not certain I could detect a vinous character to it. As the beer warmed, it became dryer and more malty/yeasty. Very interesting. Somewhat carbonated. Another great offering from Allagash."
"I could, however, drink this all the day long. It was another interesting brew from Allagash."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure I'd buy this again, but it's certainly a solid brew and worth a shot. I just wish, as I said, that the presence of grapes was more present and complex and in the mix."
"The fact that $1 from the sale of the bottle goes to save an interesting and distinct historic building is an added bonus that makes it easy to feel good about the purchase. Another nice offering from the great folks at Allagash."
