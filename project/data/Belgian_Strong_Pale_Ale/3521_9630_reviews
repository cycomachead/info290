"Pours a murky golden with a tint of orange. Massive foamy head lingers for a long time. Sticky, thick and foamy lacing retains excellently, up to the top of the glass. The aroma is of sugars and fruity esters; there is an intense blend of tropical fruit. The taste starts out as predominantly fruity; the finish has tones of orange and sugar (like orange soda). Later, this finish becomes more dry and bitter with a hint of grapefruit and hops. The taste also becomes more complex; a yeasty flavor takes over as well as hops that balance the sweet tone. As for feel, this is a sipper. I consider it a medium to slightly full bodied beer, a modest carbonation but just right for a brew of this complexity. I enjoyed."

"Earthy, apple juice, bitter, hay, light alcohol, honey, sweet red grape, light funk"

"Not very sour. Can definitely taste the hay."

"Sweet peach or apricot, mild funk, biscuit malts, dry spicy finish."

"Good color, head and lacing. Only slightly sour. Tropical fruit flavor and ginger, medicinal spice. Odd funk. Unbalanced. Leaves a rough aftertaste in its wake. Tastes almost as if it's been infected. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a good sour."
""
""
"Lots of apple forward. Fantastic balance no alcohol residual flavors whatsoever. Very crisp clean and refreshing."

"letting this beer sit for some time behind the bar in my basement."

"Very vinegar, acetic aroma. Touch of musty horse blanket, with a floral note. Flavor reveals a sweet, slightly toffee backbone, which is surprising, and a lightly lactic sourness. That sweet character is really unexpected. The finish is fairly bitter and dry."
"When I saw that this was a Flemish wild ale, I expected some sour. However, the fact that there wasn't much was well offset by the other very strong characters present.  On my own, I don't identify profiles like ""barnyard"" or ""straw," but those are admittedly exactly how this beer starts. The yeast combo gives both the banana and stone fruit. There is a touch of hop in the finish. Overall a solid brew, with the emphasis on the wild, not the ""flemish."""

"Some of the fruit notes are bananas, very slight mango character. The smell was the best part of this sour.."

"D - This beer is pretty good for the stye, but it's not my favorite style. A little too funky for session for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm falling in love recently with this farmhouse, wild yeast fermented style of beers and this absolutely does not disappoint. One of my favorites."
""
"Another excellent Belgian today."
""

"Overall- A lightly funky Belgian pale. Thats it, nothing more."

"Deep murky gold with all sorts of big, ugly floaties, yet a beautifully thick, rocky head of lumpy foam. Smell is tart and dry, focusing on a funky floral aroma, backed up by a nice pale malt sweetness, straw, lime, and champagne-like notes. More pale malt upfront than expected, the tart, funky qualities fall back alongside a more typical Belgian yeast profile before kicking into gear with spicy fruit, lemon, and flowers. Smooth and textured - almost chewy, in fact, before drying out in the finish. Not quite as good as I remember the Primitive Wild series being, though the fantastic aroma is still the best part."
""
""
"Starts like a pale ale but it becomes sour very quickly. There's enough sweetness to bring some balance. Lowly carbonated but still a thin body."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love the funky barnyard addition to the hearty spice bill. This is a sure sipper that packs a punch. The ABV snuck up on me quick due to not being present in the taste. All in all a great brew."
""
"Light orange, lots of yeasties floating around. Thick head leaves some lacing. Aroma is funky: very sour-fruity (raspberries, grapes, lemon) with some straw/hay. Strong carbonation in the mouth. Sour but not overly so; lots of grapefruit, oranges, raspberries, fruity flavors in general. Extremely dry finish with a pleasant bitterness to finish things off. Really incredible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer as I had no idea when I was drinking it that it was a 9% ABV beer - though I am not sure I would describe it as easy drinking since it has a fair amount of funkiness and sourness. Also, this is one of the beers with the highest amount of dryness that I have experienced."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Giant head, tons of lacing. Yeasty accentuated with fermented raspberry. Yeasty, bitter, and steely... sadly not much in terms of the sour character that is evident in the nose. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
"Not a straight up sour. Very mild, almost too mild, for the liking. I would characterize it like an apple crystal lite. No sour pucker or Wow factor, very pedestrian."
""
"O: Pretty good wild ale. Decent amount of brett character, but not overwhelmingly funky. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent sour. If it were just clean, without the faint off smell and the less offensive off flavor, it'd be really really good. As is, it's passable."
"I have mixed feelings with this one... There is a lot to like, but is underwhelming."
"Overall: This one is very tasty. Not as funky as some other wild ales, but the taste is complex and well balanced. Would definitely buy again, and would love to see how it ages as well."

""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. It goes down smooth with just a little film near the back of the tongue."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; best before 11/1/2012(code L1101). Pours lightly hazy and cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apple, peach, pear, apricot, pineapple, grape, floral, clove, black pepper, wood, grass, honey, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of tart apple, pear, apricot, lemon, peach, grape, clove, black pepper, floral, honey, bread, grass, wood, and earthy yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, clove, black pepper, honey, bread, floral, grass, wood, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and earthy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice wild Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt sweetness; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable slow sipper."

"This bites it's hard to drink but ti's really tasty. Definitely one of the more wild and unique beers I've had....without being weird sugary crap that Dogfish turns out."
"Final Thoughts: Reinaert Flemish Wild Ale is not what I expected it to be and as a result a let-down. It seems stuck between styles with no specific flavors. Would I drink it again? No."
""
""
"Overall a good beer w/ potential, might need to let the Brett do its thing for a while. Reminds me a bit of Fremont's The Lamb, which also had that coarse, grainy crushed-aspirin taste when fresh but improved considerably over time. I'd drink it again."
"Mid-light in body, the ale is dry, crisp, and clean overall. But its the pleasant astringency of vegetal bite that gives the ale a grassy, bitter close that lingers deeply on the tongue. Impressive is the ales strength, very little of that warmth or power is ever felt- preferring softer undertones in its story..."
""
""
"The smell was so fascinating that I had high hopes for this one, but I think there is a bit of dead yeast flavor issue."
"UPDATE - tried a couple of fresher bottles not long ago... nowhere near as funky as my first Reinaert experience. Still a very good beer - mostly dominated by the bready malt and tropical/pineapple flavors. I must say I much preferred the aged version. Sticking my next bottle(s) of Reinaert in the crawl space and doing my very best to forget where I put them."
""
""
"Give it a go if you're curious."
"Overall these guys make one kick ass Saison with Brett characters and going into this with the same expectations I was not disappointed. A nice high octane Belgium pale ale with some Brett funk worth trying in my opinion."
""
""
"O: Very interesting beer, and complex. Aroma is excellent, but for me the flavour profile didn’t quite match my expectations from the smell. Reminiscent of Goose Island Sofie, or Orval."
""
""
"O- My only gripe is that the flavor isnt quite that bold."
""
""
""
"O: A solidly made beer, and certainly easy to like. Drinkable."
""
""
""
"Paired nicely with Cabot clothbound cheddar."
""
"I like wild Ales and funky flavors, but not this one. Never again."
""
""
""
"My biggest criticism of this one is the ABV. If they could get this flavor into 6 percent, I think the bitterness that I find a bit objectionable might disappear. That slightly sweet pineapple at 6%, with a bit of leather, might be awesome, IMO"
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, (there is a date on the cap 120612, so perhaps its best by that date or it was bottled 6/12/12, I bought it before December). This pours a slightly hazy yellow straw color with a large white head which has good retention. The smells are of a little funk, a hint of brett, but mostly apples, spices, cinnamon. The feel is medium, more high carbonination. The taste is pretty good, a little wild, you get the barnyard funk, and brett, a little fruit and some other malts and a nice dry finish."
"the yeast takes away a little from the fruit and gives the beer a bit more of a spice but its nose bad. This could also have to do with the beers temperature change though as well."
""
""
""
""
"O: Earthy and spicy with only a hint of funk in the back end; this is one of the more unique tasting wild ales I have tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Started out great, but the bitter flavours with the belgian spicy yeast didn't make it the easiest drinker. Not a boring beer, I'll say that much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly good beer. I would not seek it out again, but would not be disappointed if we cross paths again down the line."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very satisfying beer. I would like a little more tartness, in a perfect world, but this is quite good indeed."
""
"O - Hard to give it such a high overall score but everything was so good. Flavor makes it almost a drain pour. I knew an $11 Belgian Wild was too good to be true."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent anticipation buildup from the lovely 750ml corked bottle to the frothy pour - couldn't wait to dive in. Aroma is citric in nature, but not overly so. First taste is complex - hints of roasted malt, orange peel, over a foundation I'd almost characterize as chewy and mead-like. The beer finishes strong, with the variety of tastes lingering well after the swallow and only a slight hang. This beer is incredibly refreshing, light enough for a warm summer afternoon, yet complex enough that each sip can be relished."
""
"O- I really wanna grab a couple of 750's of this and sit on them for a while. The alcohol gets more noticable as it warms up. Nice blend of grape must, sweetened lemons, black peppercorns, under-ripe apples and wet grassy funk. I highly recommend this as a Brett friendly Wild Ale for BA's looking to get into sours."
""
""
"Really not a fan. This was too thick and sweet, and the complexity derives from overbearing spices. I almost dislike the spices in this as much as cinnamon in a beer. Almost. This one is heavy handed, which is not something you want in a Belgian. Give me an IPA to get this cough syrupy feel out of my mouth please."
""
"Pours a clouded golden honey orange body with a deep billowing marshmallow textured white head, forms fine even lacing with tiny bubbles floating around in this effervescent wild ale. Aroma is filled with tart lemony notes, spicy floral hops and brett funkiness...a good blend of different things going on from the first sniff. Strong herbal/spicy yeast with leathery tannin notes coming off giving the beer an assertive bitterness. Some sweet biscuit malt breadiness with light honey and citric rind fruit notes blending together, amongst a spicy yeast and light herbal hop blend. The complexity builds as it warms, including more of an alcohol presence...I didn't initially notice that this beer weighed in at 9% abv. Texture is nice on the palate, a bit of bear when it comes to dryness but I think it compliments the wild yeast nutty/funky/leather characteristics. Effervescent carbonation tickles the nares with a couple of those sips, nothing too abrasive for me. Definitely a medium bodied complex beer all around, that I wouldn't go rushing out for I'm glad I tried a 11.5 ounce portion, satisfying but anymore of it I would have had enough after my single serving."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, it was a pretty decent beer but it felt a little overly sweet and candy like at times. The tart, sourness helped though and was the highlight for me."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer. It has a nice funk and bitterness which are characteristics i am just now starting to enjoy in beer. Will be trying again."
"Crisp a light body with a fair amount of carbonation. Very smooth."
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a big white head. In the aroma, sour maltiness and a note of fruit. In the taste, a dry sourness, green apple and a bit boozy. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry mix of green apple and a alcohol in the aftertaste. Sour but boozy, a bit too dry and yeasty but nice follow up with green apple."
""
""
"Overall: pretty solid beer and I am happy to have stumbled across this one. Haven't seen it before, but will be enjoying more in the future."
"Pours a murky light orange with a 2 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small patches of foamy lace form around the glass on the drink down. There is also a good amount of sediment that settles to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is very sweet and fruity with some slight yeast and funk aromas. Taste is also quite fruity and yeasty up front with some funky and earthy flavors on the finish. There is a musty and funky bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice funky aromas and flavors."
""
"Again, really reminds me of a bigger Orval or an imperial saison, not what I expected by very positively surprised. Wonder what it would be like to age."
""
"(Note: Per @show I’m posting this review here, vs. one of the many other entries for the same beer.)"
"Very impressed by this one. Will be back to grab another bottle or two. I'm sure they're not going through it quickly."
""
""
"An excellent example of a focused wild ale. It can be as complex as you care for it to be or a simple post-run refresher. I'm a big fan."
"O -- Reminds me a bit of Russian River Sanctification but not nearly as complex. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Wild Ale vs. the Belgian Strong Pale Ale...I get the wild ale, but not really the strong pale ale (though it is deceivingly high in alcohol)."
""
"Mouthfeel is again wonderful- very refreshing. Light to medium bodied with full carbonation, but not too prickly. I might go back and get this beer again sometime in the next week."
"not my favorite wild ale here. 750ml cork and cage rig, pours a very light, slightly hazy blonde color with a jovial bone white head. smells like applewine and a spring meadow. also belgian yeast and honey. flavor is identical, but very very light. green apples in the finish. the mouthfeel is so so light, almost to a fault. there isnt as much sour from the brett as i might have expected here. bitter at the end, maybe from the dry hop additions. plenty of bubbles though, and a delicate palate. overall not as exciting as some, but a good beer overall. for the price there are much better local wild ales here in colorado."
"Overall: Funky, but nicely balanced. Sweet first, followed by the bitterness. Light, goes down easy. It takes an effort to slow down and really savor this one."
"Drinkability: The balance and the mouthfeel of this one makes the drinkability quite high despite the high ABV."
""
"O/D-The appearance and the nose really impressed me. However, the flavor did not live up to its preceding reviewing components. At under $4 for a 11.2oz. beer, it isn't a waste of money. I was a bit let down with this beer, but I guess it could be worth a try."
""
""
"O: Very nice"
"M-light and smooth. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad, nothing mind blowing, I could easily drink a few of these, I did enjoy the beer, but its nothing I would have any interest in finding again."
""
""
""
"Pours a chilled, clouded pale golden with a flat white head that fades to a thin ring. To be polite, the aroma is off putting. Slight butter, with grain and light yeast. Sweet and grainy flavor, not particularly desirable with some apple and oak. Highly carbonated and medium light body. Ok, I'm done."
"The beer is clear and golden hued with a half inch of bubbly, white head. The aroma consists of yeast, apples, malt, alcohol. The flavor is a bit weak, with apple juice, booze, and some oak. Eh...Thin body, watery even. Just not that good. Not a good example of either a wild ale or Belgian strong pale ale."
"Pours a slightly hazed light yellow color with a very set head and n real lacing. A bit of a collar. The nose carries some wry faint grain and straw with just a touch of spice. Flavor has lots of lit grain. Not terribly appetizing. Light with plenty of carbonation. Dry finish. Nothing exiting."
"O - FANTASTIC."
""
""
""
"The more I sip at this the more I like it; lots of good things going on with little to room to find fault. I'd be inclined to buy a bottle every so often, but the price of entry is a bit steep for my dollar. However, I don't care to factor price into my review, so I'll just dub it recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer I could definitely drink plenty of and often. (I was turned onto this beer by a photo taken after the guys at Jester King celebrated their first brew in the farmhouse, a table was covered with beer bottles and this was one of them)."
""
"The taste is similiar to the smell. The grainy character of the malts is enormous. I get some grassy hops as well as some funk. It finishes dry and bitter. The alcohol is not quite concealed. The mouthfeel is spritzy and fizzy as well as slightly grain coarse. A good palate cleanser. It goes well with me dinner. I would try this ale again. The appearance was great and the smell was good. I'm not wild about it, but I'd try it again."
""
"M. Lighter bodied, crisp and refreshing, this one is really nice for fans of the weird and unusual like myself."
""
"Drink and overall: Very drinkable. This is an enjoyable beer. I'm a big De Proef fan...Zuetzuur is a great product, and I'm very impressed by this one. I will look for this in the future."
""
""
""
"25oz bottle. Pours a mostly clear golden color, with a good amount of bone white crackling head. Some floating yeast is noted. In the nose, mildly sour, with hay, lemon and floral hops apparent. Tastes of biscuity malt, small hop bitterness, faint bretty/sour notes and mild vinous qualities. Champagne like in flavor and dryness, and the mouthfeel is lighter bodied. Overall, this is a very nice wild ale, and more on the sophisticated side. Any lover of champagne would certainly enjoy this beer, as would fans of brett/wild yeast. Recommended."
"Pours a slightly golden hazy color with an one finger frothy soapy stark white head. The head sticks around for a while and then recedes to some nice lace up and down the glass. The aroma is of a wheat backbone. There is a big smell of pear and apple juice. The taste follows the nose, a wheat back bone with a touch of sweet belgian yeast. The real superstar of the taste is the pear and green apple, apple juice taste. The taste is sour and very inviting. It makes you want more. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and slightly prickly. Almost like a champagne. Overall this is a very good beer, the aroma and taste are well balanced and make you want another."
"O- This is interesting. Kind of reminds me of a tripel in a way, with bits of funk thrown in. The funkiness wasn't as present in the taste, but the lack of the 9% abv adds to some drinkability. Worth having again for sure."
"OVERALL GRADE: B"
"Taste pairs along with the nose, only it's really not sour at all. More of a cross between a Saison and a Belgian Pale Ale. This beer is super dry and estery. Quite a sipper. Give this one a try if you want something that's Belgian and unique, but not necessarily really Wild or crazy."
"This one pours a dull copper in color, light to medium in body, with a one finger head and moderate turbidity. The aromas consist of pale malts, belgian yeast, saccharomyces, and brett. It's slightly sweet and slightly buttery. It's light and dry. The flavors are slightly tart and slightly sweet. You definitely get the pale malt and yeasts. It probably isn't as sharp or bold as it could be. The alcohol is well hidden. It's ok but isn't necessarily anything unique. It's a pretty standard Belgian pale with two yeasts. Solid beer, nothing crazy."
"Overall: My first real venture into wilds. And the name is apt. A serious assault on the palate, but I like it a lot."
"Overall it's a very good beer. It's enjoyable, unique, and quite drinkable."
"O: Considering the strength, the beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. You just need to get through the intense amount of dryness."
"Smooth beer, although abv is pretty high, taste is not over powering! Pleasant aromas. Mildly sour, I prefer a stronger sour bite. Enjoyable, very subtle after taste. Like i said i do prefer a sour beer, yet this beer is mildly sour i still enjoyed it just the same. Would i buy this beer again? Yes i would the price was over all the same as any good 22oz it was suggested to me from a representative from bev-mo it ran about $9.99 which is pretty decent. I would suggest this beer to all to everyone, who wants something very very mild in sourness and a smooth finish."
"O- I REALLY enjoyed this beer. It's under $5 as well. Dollar for Dollar, I'd be hard pressed to find a better way to get my sour fix. You must at least try this, you cannot go wrong, especially for $5."
"The beer pours a golden yellow color with a white head. The beer is fairly cloudy and you cannot see through it. The aroma has a little bit of floral notes to it as well as some nice barnyard funk and leather notes from the brett. The flavor is very dry. I get a lot of yeast and funk as well as some lemon and orange citrus notes. There is also some grass in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, slightly funky wild ale."
"Really enjoyed the price point on this, at only $4, its a welcome addition and probably a universal pickup anytime I see it. Hides the alcohol well. Good for hot days by the river/pool."
"Overall: Interesting. Complex. Refreshing. Funky - but not too funky. Certainly worth trying!"
"Overall - The only gripe I have on this beer is it's shifting profile makes it very difficult to pair it with a entree. I can see it's uses after dinner, or as an aperitif. However, this also gives me an excuse to try it again with multiple foods. And really, it's hard to fault a beer that gives me a reason to come back to it."
"O- I would have preferred a more assertive funkiness, like Dirk did with the Flemish Primitive series. But this is a different beer with a different agenda, and it is successfully executed."
"o - Overall a pretty nice Belgian pale ale with brett. The brett stands out, though it isn't overly funky or sour. Glad to try it and would have it again."
"O: I'll preface my overall opinion with this: My experience with wild ales is limited to sour bombs, so I've never really tasted anything quite like this before. That said, I thought this was solid - I don't know that I'll go out of my way to stock up on it, but I will be a returning customer."
"Overall: This is the most ""brett forward"" beer I've had to date. The aromas and flavors are strong and funky-- excellent. I think the beer is over-hopped though (I think-- too bitter for my liking in this beer anyway), and the bitterness along with the dry finish detracts from an otherwise excellent beer."
"Note, this beer is not for newcomers to the world of brett. The funk is allowed to shine, but never completely overpowers things. The alcohol is almost non existent. This is one dangerously drinkable brew. This is a wonderful brew for lovers of the funk."
"(11.2oz bottle). Pours cloudy golden with lots of floaties and small white head. Aroma has sour cherries, caramel, and spices. Taste has a sweet malt backbone with both fruits and pit fruit to go along with a modest sourness. The sour, though, is not very noticeable. Medium to full bodied an thick texture. Kind of disappointing...."
"O: new style for me, and like IPAs its going to grow on me. I like the funk, and the dry tartness."
"Mouthfeel is good, fairly light, not sticky or thick or anything. Overall, it's not bad. I think it could have used a more noticeable sour flavor."
"D: An OK Belgian, but not nearly as wild as I was hoping. I was expecting at the very least something along the lines of Orval, and this wasn't even close."
"At 9%, this is surprisingly easy to drink. What a great beer."
"Definitely recommend this beer, and maybe having it after a Silly Super 64 should be avoided."
"drinks like: It drinks real easy, grainy maltiness is balanced by a little wild sourness. There was a real subtle hand that brewed this one."
"Drink: Easy going down. I'm glad I cellared one. I'll hit it up in a out six months and redo the review. Seems like it would age pretty well."
"D: Good."
"If you are looking for a beginners wild ale this is it."
"D: Slightly tart, very tasty. Easy drinking, and a wonderful beer to use as an intro to Belgian Styles."
"Medium bodied with very tight bubbly carbonation up front with a very prominent funky tart oak presence. Vinegary tartness with lots of funk which is nicely balanced by oaky vanilla notes and light fruit notes. Citrusy notes, especially lemon peel and crisp light fruits like apple and pear. Puckering without being acidic. Extremely well balanced with a lingering dry finish. Delicious and dangerously drinkable."
"I excepted something different from this beer, but I wasn't disappointed."
"Flavor is unique... I wouldn't say I love it, but I don't hate it either. The ""wild ale"" flavors fade out big time in the taste. Based off of the aroma, I expected more sharp tartness, or even a vinegar tone based off the beer still being labeled as ""flemish"". It's actually very mild...and more ""Belgian pale ale"" like. Some light fruits...very faint, yeast, and wood notes are the biggest. Theres a very small hint of tart/sour in the very end of the flavor, and it lasts for a few seconds. Overall...this is again, unique. Interesting, but bland at the same time. Was hoping for more...but at the same time...a very easy drinker! Booze is very well hidden for 9%!"
"CHEERS!!"
"Not my favorite, but certainly not bad either. I would drink again, but won't seek it out."
"Overall: Too sweet could have been aged longer then released I also wish there was more brett funk but still it was good I did not hate it but there is flaws to this one in my opinion."
"This is very drinkable for being 9%, and goes down quite nicely on this muggy night. The only thing that really hinders the drinkability is the amount of sticky dryness on the finish. All in all this is a pretty tasty sour beer."
"Pours a VERY cloudy yellow/golden-straw color with a big, white, fluffy head. Scent is sweet with lots of green apples. Has the fruity scent of a delicious Belgian tripel with quite a bit of funk as well. Taste is very similar to scent, but much more hops than expected. Also less sourness. Although I was hoping this beer was really sour, I am definitely not disappointed in the taste. Initially I get the apple fruitiness, followed by some hay and brett flavor (I happen to be a fan of brett). Then the hops dominate to leave you with a crisp, dry, lightly bitter finish. I'd say this beer is pretty well balanced (still kinda sad it wasn't more sour). I am curious as to what the yeast does to this beer with some age on it. The mouthfeel is crisp and delightful. The drinkability is VERY high, especially at 9%ABV."
"Doing a group review right now with 2 friends. Drinking from a 750 ml. Cloudy pale golden color. Slight head. Nice carbonation. Little bit of funk, but well ballanced. Pumkin, hay, and tree fruit have been mentioned. Clean, slightly bitter finish. Consensus: Very good, drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel has a nice sizzle from carbonation and a fair bite of acidic bitterness. The finish is dry like an aged scotch but with a malt mustiness instead of earthy peat. A very tasty and easy to drink beer that is quite refreshing. This brew is a solid B+ and well worth trying out."
"D - I just didn't really enjoy this beer at all in the taste department and it seems over carbonated to me and I do like BSPAs and Flemish ales so this isn't a beer I'd recommend anytime soon"
"Drink- Easy drinking beer, the dryness of the beer in combination with the light flavors makes this easy to enjoy drink after drink"
"This beer is full of oldness while at the same time being new and refreshing. That is what I like about sour ales: a complexity and depth of flavor. This wild ale hides its potent 9% ABV well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good example of brew with Brett yeast."
"All 4's"
"Though we said you'll be in for a treat if you never tried a Brett beer, it's more of a love-it-or-hate-it characteristic. For us, we love it as it pushes the envelope of where beer can go. So any beer geeks out there who like Brett, you'll love this one."
"Drinkability, for 9% was excellent. No signs of ABV and a mellow blend of flavors. Very ""light for 9%."
"Good beer, really good beer - unique and tasty. Definitely worth my $4.00 but I probably wouldn't have more than one or two in a single sitting."
"Overall, I liked this one better than I was expecting when I saw it come out of the bottle and took a whiff. Very interesting nose and flavor profile, not what I was expecting to say the least. Still reminds me of a bock fermented with wild yeast."
"D -- Not really impressive but okay, might be a nice intro for the style. I won't buy it again."
"Decent."
"D: This is an elegant easy drinking beer for its size. Complex, but not a beer I'm going nuts for just yet, but I really liked it."
"overall a nice wild ale."
"D - Tasty brew. Wild, I guess, but not so much. Not overdone. Like a Belgian pale with a little more to offer."
"Serving style: 750ml bottle, 50 degrees, breathed for 20 minutes, tulip glass."
"Conclusion: Really really tasty, mild-mannered Brett beer. I've been craving something just like this for a long time, a beer with a substantial Brett presence, combined with some spicy yeast and a touch of sweetness. Really nice beer."
"Nice effort"
"Revisited this one and wasn't quite as good. There seems to be a trend I am noticing with The Prof's brews...it's best to drink them fresh. They don't age very well and lose a lot of their complexity."
"A great, surprising beer - one of the most balanced sours i've had!"
"750ml. corked and caged bottle. Bottle conditioned. Served in a Tank 7 tulip. Poured a pale gold with a couple of fingers of white head. Lots of brett in the nose also some caramelized sugar and citrus. Light to medium bodied. Not as sour as the aroma would suggest. Citrus and some candied sugar. Funk in the finish that builds as it warms. Interesting beer."
"Very smooth and indubitably delicious. This went down easy."
"I've been storing this bottle for about five months at slightly warmer than cellar temperature to accelerate the production of funk, as much cooler temps are known to hinder the development of Bret. With intended agitation of the bottle, the release of dregs and sediment was astounding, like one of those plastic shake up things with the snowman and ""snow"" inside it that you got as a kid when you visited Florida for the first time in winter. Massive dregs and particulate (I love that word) seasoning the brew as it circulates through the bomber bottle. To me this gives the brew character and I pour this through a ultra-fine strainer to weed out the largest fluid-borne mass. The nose of this brew is great; soft barnyard funk, horsehair and yeasty. A generous white head leads into a never ending meringue like slick with beautiful unctuous lacing. The taste is moderately bitter and tart with essence of lemon balm and slightly detectable candy sugars. This vibrancy from the zesty citric components lends to this brews drinkability that has a surprisingly plush mouthfeel. Clearly as this brew warms it becomes much more opulent; so drinking it at the proper temperature will provide for the most enjoyable experience."
"D - This is a nice beer. Tasty and easily drinkable."
"Overall, it was a decent brett beer, but nothing amazing. It is fairly drinkable. When I red the label I was really excited to try it, because I thought it would taste like some of my favorite styles, but I was wrong on that."
"D - wish i had either a bigger bottle, or more of this. i loved it. haven't been so pleasantly surprised by a beer in quite awhile."
"D= Pretty good. This is my second attempt from this brewery and I wasn't as disappointed this time. This beer wasn't as funky as I hoped it would have been or as sour really. A very light wild ale. Not bad by any means but not the greatest thing I've had and the price tag won't lead me back to it but it was worth a shot."
"This beer has good flavor and is easy to drink. It's not outstanding but it's good."
"D - This is a really good wild ale. It reminded me of a good farmhouse saison."
"The colour was cloudy, murky and straw like with a thin off white head. The aromas were lightly citrusy with plenty of yeast character and funk. On the palate there was light citrus, biting hops and the quintessential funky horse blanket and barnyard that seems to go with such ales. Good stuff; don't get me wrong!"
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable but in small amounts like most heavy bret beers. One for me is good."
"Drinkability: This just wasn't as complex of a beer as I was hoping. It seemed rather straightforward. Some pale malt, with a dash of brett to give it some barnyard characteristics. I just wasn't feelin' it."
"Poured a 11.2 oz stubby into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep copper amber with a decent 2 inch head that recedes into nothingness and leaves no lacing. The aroma is surprisingly not as bretty as I had expected by reading some other reviews. While the brett funk is there, invoking damp earth and musty closets the caramel malts come through also lending toffee, biscuits and yeast to intermingle with the brett. The flavor is very reminiscent of the nose with caramel malts, giving a toffee/biscuit flavors along with the brett funk. To me, the brett lends itself to an earthy dampness that compliments the toffee rather nicely. Also a slight bit of alcohol show up as it warms. Its really nice to see a beer where the brett is domineering the show but at the same time I wish there was more of a brett presence in the beer. I know, I cant be pleased. I would like to take a bottle and age it for a couple years just to see where it goes."
"notes- bitter, sour finish, makes you pucker, gets the drinker's attention. beer is brewed with the same wild strain of yeast that is used in lambic"
"Drinkability takes a little hit, because although it was interesting, the 11.2 oz. bottle was enough for me. I enjoyed trying this beer, but I had enough and didn't want any more."
"Pours a hazy, honey-gold with a tight, sticky white head that sticks to the side of the glass. A deep whiff produces a nice potpourri of tart lemon notes and mustiness. Definitely has that brett funk to it. On the tongue, there's a sweet/sour citrus backbone with a peppery presence in the foreground. Lingering bitterness. Not as much of the mustiness as there is in the nose. Actually reminds me of a more tart Duvel. But I was hoping for something a little more tart and, shall we say, barnyardish. Still, very Belgian in the yeast. Crisp and spritely on the mouth. Complex enough and dry enough to be pretty high in the drinkability department, though I imagine a couple would be more than enough at its strength. Still very enjoyable and quenching."
"These guys need to take care of the chunks. Maybe this was a bit old? No date on bottle"
"D - having a hard time downing this one. Too yeasty, funky and unbalanced to be really that good. The 9% abv. is hidden, but the aftertaste is just too much to be good."
"D: A strong beer but one that goes nicely with taking it slow. It gains character as it warms and you could make a wee bottle of this last some time. Truly a wild experience. Try one on for size. You'll see it fits nicely."
"this ain't bad. but their special releases are even better."
"330 ml bottle purchased from the Pizza Port Bottle Shop for about five bucks, reviewed from notes, poured into my Chimay goblet, light yellow color with a hint of orange tint, two inch soapy white head, pretty weak lacing but some decent retention, aroma has light hops, floral accents, light malts, citrus, oranges, lemons, and mildly wild yeast, flavor starts off crisp and dry with a very minor tartiness for the first few sips that went away later on, dry yeast and hops in the middle, finish has a lot of sweetness and hot alcohol, Belgian sugars and yeast add to the sweetness once it warms, thick and not typical of a wild ale, too strong and overpowering, slightly dry, sweet, and boozy mouthfeel, medium bodied, lighter side of carbonation, taste lingers pretty long, could not drink much more of this, heavy stuff and is filling even on an empty stomach, too sweet and boozy for my palate, not very wild and barely any tart at the beginning only, booze overpower this beer quite a bit, probably would not drink again, worth trying"
"A very complex brew that is quite enjoyable."
"Well balanced, not overpowering at all. Highly drinkable. A good introduction for people not familiar with this style of beer. Would go nice with cheese."
"D- with the high abv one of these would be good for the day. However, this would be a good beer to start off during parade day and have throughout."
"Reinaert had a saison look with a cloudy straw yellow color with some small golden spots and some sediment. Smells consist of barnyard scents, hay and yeast with grain. In taste this does come off as a BSPA with some wild yeast giving off a barnyard musty taste. Some grass from the hops used. Some bread with faint fruits such as banana, light spices. The feel is light crisp and refreshing with just a light touch of funk, very faint. Good carb and ok drinkability, not my favorite brew."
"Just happened to see this at a BevMo that I'd never been to before and thought it looked interesting. This just reminds me that I need to do proper research before trying a beer I've never heard of. I'm sorry, but this beer angered me deeply."
"A clear golden brew is topped with a fluffy off-white head that clears out quickly and leaves some small streaks of lace. Sour fruits and mild grass aromas are noticed at the nose initially. Tastes spicy up front, with some mild sour fruits mixing in after a bit. A very slight alcohol heat lingers. Taste is mild, which works well for me, because I haven't completely developed a taste for wilds and sours, so I don't want them too crazy. Mouth-feel is medium, and it goes down fairly easy, but demands sipping obviously. Not bad, but not completely my cup of tea."
"A nice drinkable wild ale -- it's balanced and interesting without being too crazy -- refreshing and hides the high ABV all too well."
"Nice, but not great. Wouldn't drink again. I didn't like the way the tartness dominated most of the beer. I guess that rules out Beatification for me. I'm gonna lay off the sours until Sanctification rolls around, back to bourbon barrel aged with fruit infused ""normal"" imperial beers."
"D - Not bad, but I would have toned down the hops a bit, and let the brett do its thing. This beer grows on you, though. Definitely worth a try for fans of wild ales, but it won't blow you away."
" Highly recommended, my firat time trying this beer and I will go back and get it again. De Proef doesn't disappoint."
"Initially smell is clove/banana with slight malts. Yeast and sour notes give it a taste of slightly undercooked sourdough, but bits of spice awaken the palate and prove to be a nice albeit mild brew. Finish is nice, but alcohol leaves a little heat in back of throat, but not completely undesirable. Mouth feel is full and beer is quite drinkable as I plan on sitting on the sofa and reflecting on the evening before turning in for the day."
"But the smell can put one off."
"Hazy yellow/peach with a thick coating of white bubbles topping the beer and lining the glass. Very good head retention with a constant stream of bubbles supporting the cap for several minutes. Smells good, tropical fruit and pineapple, musty, grassy, juicy fruit, earthy, a bit chalky. The flavour was fruity up front, more citrus/lemon than tropical though. Lingering bitterness. Moderate tartness through the middle, along with the earthy funk and wet grass. Fairly dry with ample carbonation and a lighter body. A bit coarse in texture. Alcohol wasn't evident. Solid overall. It had a great aroma and nice flavour, but I wasn't sold on the bit of harshness in the texture. Not a fatal flaw, but keeps it from being superb rather than just good."
"D: Because of the lightness and how crisp it is, this goes down extremely easily for a beer weighing in at 9%. Not a whole lot of flavor, just an interesting beer. I don't know If I'll seek this out again, but I am glad to have tried it."
"The appearance upon being poured into a tulip glass is a tone similar to apple juice with a one finger head that will quickly lace a way into a thin white ring around the beer. The smell also involves apples, tart, a bit sweet. The taste has a faint cinnamon spice to it, with some citrus. Mouthfeel is bubbly, similar to a sparkling wine, very interesting. Drinkability is here, nice beer, unique and fun, not your typical ""belgian strong pale ale."""
"De Proef. So strange, so intriguing. This one pours a hazy orange with a dwindling head. What I love most about all De Proef beers is the nose. So full of flowers and a ripeness from the unique yeast strains. Flavor is more malty than I would expect. Really nice. Melting caramel, a nice ripe fruityness, and a dry earthyness. Smooth and creamy. Lots of great flavors here, a bit on the sweeter side and a little bit heavy, but with good reason considering the 9% ABV. Good beer."
"D- this is a solid beer throughout and a great lightly wild ale. this is great"
"All and all this is a great balanced great tasting unique funky beer. Go try one already."
"Poured this into my duvel glass. Appears a very nice golden yellow color with a dense head. Lots of funk in the aroma with hints of peach and some light citrus fruits. More funk in the taste with some light citrus notes. This beer has a wonderfully long, slightly bitter dry finish. A wonderful sipper and very refreshing. I haven't had too many other wild ales yet but I really enjoyed this one. The only problem is I can't have more than a couple glasses at a sitting. Will try again for sure."
"Overall I think this is a great beer for a great value. It is perfect for a hot summer Sunday afternoon (like today). Very refreshing, and I absolutely love the brett/sach wildness in this ale. Not overpowering at all like some other reviewers mentioned, but still plenty there to give it a good flavor. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes wild ales."
"Alcohol noticeable on the finish of this 9% beer."
"D: Not a terrible brew but definitely a let down compared to the abundance of stellar wild ales from the US. Drinks decent enough and is interesting but probably not something that will have me buy another."
"Oveall, a good beer but wasn't what I was hoping for in the end. Do recommend if you can easily get and aren't expecting the big funk/sour that you find in American Wild Ales. For me, one is enough but I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"when poured this beer looks great. it also has very good consistency. its flavor is an acquired taste and i could easily see someone not liking its flavor but i do like its flavor which tastes very natural.cool bottle, usually not too expensive. ive only had a few flemish ales but i really like this one and i recommend trying it if you have not already."
"D = This is a very nice wild beer, good Saison qualities but also some other wild notes. Good to go with food like roast chicken with a lemon butter sauce."
"An addendum. When it warms, it smells...um....like....well....let's not beat around the bush. urine."
"D- one of the ""funkier"" beers i have tried. easy to finish, and one was enough. im still getting used to the idea of wild beers, this one might have been a bit much for me right now. definitely an acquired taste."
"Overall this was a tasty beer, though I would've preferred a bit more tartness considering the name, though I agree that it is more of a BSPA. Worth a shot."
"M: mild bodied. solid carbonation level. a lot of zip to this one."
"Poured hazy amber from a 750ml bottle. Aroma is about as funky as any I've had from de proef... I never in my life would have thought that a barnyard smell would ever be a positive thing in a beverage. I don't get as much horseyness with this one as much as wet hay and dustiness. Flavor is on par with the aroma. Yeasty funk, with the superdry finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall this is a good drinking beer, that is a good example of what a couple of yeasts can do to a beverage."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter. It pours a golden yellow with a medium white head. The nose is funky, mostly sour. The flavor is also a bit sour with a dry finish. The beer is medium bodied and it is a sipper. I will not get this one again, IMO a bit too much brett."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for the opportunity to try this one. 750ml bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured the color of straw with a skim of white foam around the edges; clarity was murky. Nose was sour apple, oak and ethanol at the back. Taste consistent with nose, but much more muted. Mouthfeel was light and effervescent with a dry finish. Easy drinking, but not much of a wild element per se. That being said, I really enjoyed this brew and am looking forward to try other offerings from this brewer."
"Big thanks to Rian (Thirsty Bird) for sharing this beer. 750 ml bottle. Pours dark hazy orange with a medium white head. Aroma is all sour apples at first. After a minute, some grass and funk come through. Well balanced flavor, with a nice mix of sweet and sour. Has a medium body and medium high carbonation. Overall, this was a very nice beer."
"One of the best De Proef beers I have had. I like this better than the Jason Perkins or the Tomme Aurthur signature beers, and that is saying something."
"Nice beer. The emphasis on hops really makes this stand out. I might add this to my regular drinking lineup. It's kind of saisony, with a funky edge."
"Bottom line: My review will probably be higher than most(I've read some of the reviews) but dammit, my eyes, nose, and palate never lie to me so..so be it."
"Yes, it is much tamer than I thought it would be as I was expecting more funk and sourness. This beer drinks more like a sweeter, tart Belgian golden ale. Very bready and tastes a bit like masa. Dont get me wrong, this beer is tasty and fun to drink, but some other DeProef brews are better. It does hide the 9% very well and the brett is evident and very much appreciated. The more it warms up and releases carbonation the better it tastes. Definitely a sipper here. I will probably buy another one of these for the cellar one of these days."
"Interesting beer with good complexity. A good example of the wild/brett beer style and worth a try if you know what you're getting into and you like the inherent wild yeast funk."
"D - Damn it, this was way too expensive to be a drain pour. There was no reason to believe this was a bad bottle, so this pretty much pisses me off. This won't make me boycott a killer brewery like DeProef, though...I'll get over it by drinking a Les Deux Brasseurs."
"Almost like drinking diluted and carbonated brandy with some funk. According to the bottle it has Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces in it. Interesting and enjoyable. Might be a good wild beer for the faint of heart."
"D - For what this is, it is extremely drinkable. Though this is quite a deviation from most beers, the sweetness and funk are balanced in such a way that the flavors never become overwhelming. Alcohol is extremely well hidden to the point of being undetectable. Deceptive to be sure. Obviously a different animal than the majority of BSPA's, it seems this is a fine show case of ""funk"" without the overly acidic character of some lambics and gueuze."
"D: Drinkability is good but the strength of the alcohol can catch you like a bear trap. This is a beer worthy of some nursing and attention."
"D: The interesting smell alone makes me want to buy it again. But the taste isn't impressive enough to do so."
"D - While I respect the complex wild yeast character of this beer, it is a stretch to call it drinkable. The aroma is very pleasant, but the flavor is almost bit over the top for me. The cheese like character of the wild yeast in this beer seems to be a trademark of De Proef wild beers; and while it lends a unique and interesting quality to the beer, it hardly inspires me to seek this out as a regular for my beer fridge."
"First time seeing this beer in the local shop, pours a nice golden color with a billowy white head. Smells of brett, but not overpowering. Taste is a bit dissapointing, as I was hoping for something with a bit more tang, but otherwise a rather balanced belgian ale. Overall a very drinkable beer and the alcohol is hidden quite well."
"Pours slightly cloudy with the consistency and color of ginger ale. Smells only of brett funk. First sip is sour that is mostly funk. It bites with strength and conviction. It is fairly sour but the brett funk dominates and is not for the wimpy. This beer will not be many people's gateway to sours. The body is extremely light and the high 9% ABV is well hidden. As it warms some of the funk fades along with almost all of the carbonation - strange. Over time the beer becomes less and less tolerable."
"This one was kind of interesting, it's not sour but definitely funky. Honestly I think it would be a lot better with some Lacto sourness, but with only Brett it isn't that great."
"Appearance: Straw, golden, cloudy."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I am not really sure what style this beer fits into, but for what ever it is...it is pretty good. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more of a truly wild character to the beer, but ""I like 'em dirty"". It is a tripel that is more off than your ordinary St Bernardus or some such. I would drink this beer again, gladly. I will try some of the others in this line to see if they are more assertive, but overall this is a pretty decent beer."
"Poured from a 75cL bottle marked ""Special Reserve", this brew is a hazy straw gold with a medium white head. The foam dissipates quickly, leaving a thin sheet and a bit of lacing. Smells predominantly of sour fruit esters (namely lemon and cherry) and barnyard/horseblanket. The funky brett character really masks the bit sweet malt that's in the background. On the palate, the malt comes forward first, though it's again soon overshadowed by the sour yeast. Surprising bitterness that actually works very well. Nicely balanced and quite complex. An impressive beer overall."
"Pours a hazy straw gold with big foamy white head into a tulip glass. Good retention leaves some nice lacing behind. Smells of sour cherries, lemons, and apples, then grain, yeast, and Brett funk. Tastes a little bit of alcohol up front then some sourness of cherries and lemon zest. Honey and grain blend with yeast, straw, and funk with some peppery spices and clove thrown in for good measure. Finishes with a nice dry grass bitterness. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Not as sour as the nose suggested, a little bit medicinal at first but overall a nice mix of fruit, spices, and yeasty malt with a good bitter grassy finish. I wouldn't take this beer with me on a desert island, but I wouldn't mind having it again sometime."
"Though a nice yeast-driven beer, it was never completely lost to the yeast; a fairly good balance persisted throughout. It's good to know I can buy this locally now. When I need a medicinal yeast fix I don't have to rely on Orval (although I do prefer Orval to Reinaert). Variety is the spice of my life."
"Suffiently funky, with dominating yeasty breadiness, sour, though with a sweet and then bitter balance. It doesn't quite win ""funky brew of the year"" award from me, but it's still a very good example of a Flemish wild ale (funky, yeasty, sour) with classic Belgian Pale Ale character (sweetness and grassy hoppiness). An interesting brew."
"crazy sour smell to it. cherry and fruit - can really smell the yeastiness. great taste - sour as expected, nice flavor. flavor and taste spread very well throughout the mouth."
"$10 750ml. I've been pleased with previous De Proef offerings so why not? Clear golden yellow color with an initial smell of acidic tomatos. That is quickly replaced some grassy alcohol and possibly urine. Not bad! Tastes like a wild tripel just a slight bit of bretty funk very easy to drink. Not sour at all sadly but it probably is not supposed to be."
"Conclusion: This is an okay showing. I think the look and smell of this brew is more rewarding than the actual flavor. Sure you get a good shot of ""Brett"" yeast, but there are more complex and interesting offerings out there. I'd suggest Brewery Ommegang's ""Ommegeddon"" as a more interesting alternative to this."
"11.2 ounce thin bottle, w/o freshness info available, $3.60 @ New beer in NYC (support New beer, family owned, great selection and prices) With the yeast swirled and activated from the bottom, this one pours cloudy medium apricot, with an off white head, long lasting, respectable fingers of lacing. Interesting nose of light funk, barnyard, fruit and flowers, yes complexity! Delicate and delightful. A lot going on here, flowery, moderate funky horse blanket and more barnyard on the palate. oats, honey, mustard seeds, quite drying grassy hops late. Yum, I love everything I've tried from De Proef and this one did not disappoint. Bring on the funky blue cheese and peppery salads and meats."
"I have had, literally, about ten of these in a night. It's one of the most drinkable wild ales out there. Highly recommended. Prost!"
"This beer is not horrible but its not amazing or delightful. i thought it was too sweet / too much carmel flavor and had a rough after taste. not likely that i would search for this beer ever again. its not a horrible beer (ie didnt leave me with a headache) but i wasnt that into the taste."
"Drinkability: I''m getting through it. Perhaps after I get acquainted to the style I'll find this to be a more drinkable example."
"Light in body, light in carbonation, light on funky flavor... I guess that makes Reinaert Flemish Wild Ale something of a lightweight, but the beer is highly drinkable."
"OK drinkability."
"This is a very daunting beer, and show be avoided at all costs by those new to beer. Sour, tart, with a little bit of sweetness sneaking in. And oddly, a bit of creaminess. Recommended for those who want it."
"This review is of the 750ml bottle."
"The beer pours a lovely orange brown color with lots of visible, pulpy sediment locked in suspension. Carbonation bubbles stick to the bottom of the glass before jetting to support the hug frothy and lacing white head. The beer glows in the light, very nice. Alcohol shows up right away in the nose, slightly astringent, moderate funk, some citrus and bready notes. First though while tasting is that the beer was very tangy and bright, alive with carbonation. Fresh hop and citrus fruit notes and a layer of light, but musky and earthy funk that lingers on to the aftertaste. Medium bodied and slightly coating, very high carbonation. I wish it was more wild, but still worth a shot if spotted."
"This one was good after about 4 months of cellaring and with a nice piece of grilled cajun fish and beans."
"D - Pretty good. It is very musty."
"An excellent beer for anyone to try, a must for those who like belgians."
"Overall: This tastes like a raw and unpolished la fin du monde with an interesting head. However the flavor doesnt pull through for me and while this was interesting I do not think I would seek it out again. The alcohol presence is a little bit high and makes this slightly difficult to drink."
"A highly-anticipated beer in this household, and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Fabulous stuff. Fans of Fantome, Orval, Jolly Pumpkin, De Proef's Flemish Primitive and of course lambic/gueze fans...you know what to do. Hell, you've probably done it already."
"M/D - Improves as it warms, always a good thing. I took my sweet time and was rewarded almost two hours in with some new flavors and textures. Not a huge bitter Bretty hit, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for in the style. I give a little more benefit to mouthfeel than drinkability. Bitey late."
"Good unique drinker. Definitly worth trying in my book."
"I'll have to put some age on a bottle and see what happens, as this could seemingly go a number of ways."
"Was looking for more funk from the wild yeast, otherwise a well balanced and drinkable beer."
"Last night, a new tripel. Different but enjoyable. Tonight, a new masseuse for when my wild-ale knot needs rubbing."
"High alcohol but no trace of it in the flavor. Quite drinkable."
"D: Overall, not bad. Not my favorite Flemish, but still tasty. I would order another one, as long as I had a break in the middle."
"Drinkability is very high, this is crisp and refreshing, tasty yet mild. Goes down very easisly, with no indication of the ABV - very dangerous if you have to many of these on hand!"
"5) It took two separate tries to get this to go down. It had to breathe a little, if you can believe that. A nap might be the best thing for this cranky bottle. Maybe one for me too."
"If I had access to De Proefbrouwerij beer, I would be much more likely to buy a handful of these stubbies rather than the 750 ml bottles. Hopefully, the brewery will pick the best of the Flemish Primitive Wild Ales (Surly Bird and Pig Nun) and will release them in 11.2 ounce bottles. If not, Reinaert Flemish Wild Ale is more than capable of providing a high-octane Brett fix."
"Drinkability: Interesting blend of the straight and wild; almost an introduction to the world of Brett for the uninitiated"
"A mixed bag. Open up nice, finishes poorly. Quality, but probably not something I would seek out again."
"Spicy, malty and earthy on the nose. The taste is spicy and complex: cinnamon, pepper, with Belgian yeast, hops, and an element of sweetness that makes itself known but is quickly drowned out by a dry, malty finish. The body is on the thin side. Alcohol is easily overtaken by the spicy flavor."
"D- Definitely ""wild."" Impressive and unique."
"Pours cloudy light apricot color that slightly glows. Half inch foamy, white head with large bubbles quickly thins. Smells musky yeast with hint of barnyard or zoo. Complex with just a little sweet to floral smell. The flavor is complex and hard to put my finger on. Very earthy, picking up a little of the floral to fruity flavor that I noted in the smell. Long-lived earthy aftertaste gives way to mild hop bitterness and keeps the fragrant flavor all the way through. Medium to full bodied with active carbonation that gives your tongue a little bite. This is a very tasty, complex beer that is perfect for sipping on the porch on a rainy day. Great paired with an aged raw milk cheese and a loaf of crusty bread."
"D - Unique. Barnyard funk of the brett along with a sweet Belgian Strong Pale make for an interesting combo."
"Comment: I enjoy the Flemish Primitivesa good variant of the Belgium Strong Pale Ale."
"A medium body with some chalkiness from the residue, and a lingering sweetness. Easy enough to drink, but nothing real special here."
"D - I really enjoyed trying this beer, but I only need one a year or so. Very enjoyable for that annual tradition however."
"Complex and enigmatic. Seems undecided whether it wants to be a wild ale or a Belgian pale ale. Bitter hops seem to get in the way a bit. A pleasant experience but overly challenging."
"Overall a unique and pleasant offering from a brewery I haven't had before. I really enjoyed the spicy/dry/sour aspects of this well-balanced ale. The dry spiciness lingers for a long time, which I truly like...let's me know I'm into something good. I'll definitely seek the others from this brewery. Happy Easter!"
"D: As my mouth adjusted and the beer warmed, it definitely grew on me. This beer is still generally boring."
"This made me appreciate the milder sourness of Flanders Reds and JP's that much more. I finished my bomber, but I'll not be buying this again."
"Mouth: Not as sweet as the aroma would have you believe, and actually the attendance of hops does not go unnoticed. Very highly carbonated, which is great for this style. Some fruity flavors, but alcohol is all over the place here, along the sides of the tongue all the way back, through the swallow, and felt in the exhale as well. The Brett is not nearly as sour as I would have expected, but that's just the way the beer is. Some metallic qualities that I could do without."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy light amber color, ton of yeast in bottom of bottle. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sour nose. Flavor is tart with some sweetness, mellow fruity finish. High ABV not noticeable. $3.99 for a 330ml bottle from John's Market Place Tigard, Or."
"Drinkability: This was an adventurous tasting beer, I liked it. It was a very flavorful pale ale, and easy to drink. It also cut the fattiness of the pizza really well."
"Overall, a decent brew, but I hoped for more from the geniuses at De Proef."
"D - For everything that's going on here, it's actually quite drinkable. Not sure why, but I'm having a tough time putting down the glass. High alcohol content is never overpowering and doesn't slow down the enjoyment of this belgian treat. Not one that I'll go back to very soon, but I'm glad that I had the opportunity to sample this unique beer."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a light orange/gold color with a good sized white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells yeasty and earthy, and a weird fruity/spicy smell too that I can't describe. The taste is yeasty, fruity sweet/sour at the same time. It's mainly apricots and a bit of apple I taste, but there's some other fruit in there. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and very crisp and dry. The drinkability is good, but the alcohol kicks in after a few drinks of the beer. Not a bad beer, I don't know if it's something I could drink all the time but I would definitely drink it again."
"i really am loving these wild ales, quickly becoming my new favourite style"
" The malt makes quite a showing against the funk. A fruity, wildly yeasty character combines with with the malt to create something I cannot interpret well enough to describe. I like it though. Mouthfeel is full and foamy. Drinkable to the extreme."
"Beer is good. Happy downbeat funky beering."
"This legendery cunning fox of a brew fell into my glass with a dirty golden colour and sprouted a spitty off white coloured head. It is mildly carbonated. The nose is fruity and sour. The fruitiness is one that I am unable to specify although white grape comes to mind. It has a definite malty sugar presence that reminds the reviewer of candy. The taste is quite satisfying. It sort of reminds the reviewer of a white wine in the finish. I guess it must be the white grape impression leading me that way. It is sweet and sour. A bit of spiciness is noted. The beer is juicy and dare I say refreshing in a spritzer type fashion. It has a modicum of dryness which may be due in large part to alcohol which remains otherwise undetectable upon my palate. The mouthfeel is light, but the sugary aspects make it feel substantial. It seems to coat my teeth as though I were eating hard candies or something. The drinkability is good. This beer has a much welcomed flavour and it livens up my night simply by the alien nature of it. I am enjoying this and I have no regrets in its purchase. It is a worthy milestone as a 250th review by myself. Pleasurable indeed."
"A generous capping white head. A hazy orange with light tones. A piercing aroma, yeasty with fermented fruit notes, overcoated by cloying tartness. Not quite so tart in the mouthfeel, surprisingly full of malt. Slight alcohol just before the finish. The high gravity makes this slightly too thin for the style. Flavours fails to develop through the tasting, even letting this one warm its hard to grasp much character. Boder-line tart - but really no sournness. Largely this fails to develop."
"Hazy, bright golden color. Decent carbonation level. Fluffy white head that is gone pretty quick. Great, funky, dirty feet smell to it. Musty and earthy. Big phenolic taste to it. Peppery and spicy flavors dominate. Very dry finish. Good mouthfeel-no hint of alcohol burn or other ""hot"" flavors. Very drinkable beer overall. Wasnt sure what I was getting into as a ""wild ale"". I had major gueze visions or the like. While not my favorite style this beer is very unique and satisfying. Well worth a try even if a bit pricey."
"The mouth is very dry and spritzy with some puckering towards the finish. I would like to try this with some mixed fruits and cheeses, but it drinks very well on its own. The abv does not hurt the drinkability."
"Drinkability: Not for everyone; possibly for no one. More than wild, just about out of control. Seriously, this is Slayer to Orval's Motley Crue. If you think you're up to it, quite a challenge."
"I think this would be a good session beer, but one that you should be weary of due to the high alcohol content. It is a great beer, and I am glad to have tried it."
"I don't quite know what to make of this one. It's slightly tart, but not what I expected from a ""wild ale."" Scent is off a bit, kinda funky, but not in a pleasant way at first. Once the yeast settles a bit, the scent is easier on the nose, but it is not indicative of the taste at all. Taste is good, not great, and not very ""wild."" Tart at first, this quickly fades to sweet, then finishes a bit tart again. I barely taste the brettanomyces, perhaps it's the saccharomyces that is the predominant yeast here. All in all, not a bad brew, but not something I would regularly pick up. If you are looking for a wild ale in particular, look elsewhere."
"For a wild-fermented Belgian, this is pretty good; it's my first one, so I'm being somewhat conservative with my ratings because I don't have anything to compare it to."
"Poured into a tulip yeast and all. Head came in very well for me despite what others have said, tall white and fluffy leaving lots of lacing and it reformed after each drink. Color was ciderish burnt orange with active carbonation and some floaties wandering through the glass. Nose was strong and complex with fruity aromas galore from bananas to strawberries , followed by a strong sour note. Taste hits the buds very sour but in a good way and prepares your palate for a wave of complex fruity flavors, yeasty and full this is easy to drink at 9 percent. Changes dramatically as it increases in temperature making each sip slightly different. Overall I really like this beer and will be on my way tomorrow to pick up a few more to see how this one ages."
"Taste: Alcohol quite predominant, the sweet, fruity aftertaste mingled well with yeasty, breadcrumb character. Quite full bodied. It was nice, but nothing over the top for me, a trend I seem to notice often from this brewery (I didn't even knew DeProef made the Beer before typing this)."
"A solid offering."
"Pours a light orange color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is funky and fruity with some sourness. Lots of light flavors and funkiness with some fruits and sourness. The body is light and the drinkability is good."
"From notes. Poured a hazy orange color with a finger of head that fell to nothing. Nose was very nice. Sour and musty with a light lemon/orange citrus. Very good balance in the nose. Flavor was mellow and subdued. Light musty with lemon. No real sour character. The feel was moderate with a moderate carbonation. Good and refreshing. Overall a good beer. Flavor was not quite as intense in flavor as I would like."
"I cant recall now whether or not the bottle had yeasted lees, but I sensed my serving was not particularly fresh. Still, it warms well and gives the palate something to think about."
"The only thing I wanted more from this beer is head. Despite lively effervescence, there wasnt a lot of fluff on top  though the thin coating that WAS there was well-retained. Granted, it could have been a pouring error. Ill try again later."
"(11.2 oz. short fat brown bottle)"
"Fundamentally sound appearance although this is one of the beers weaker areas for the style. Head falls to islands with little lacing but it indeed holds its own and with each drink reproduces itself. I found the smell to be alot of work to figure out what the hell was going on!! lots of sour at first, but after a few drinks this settled down and there was a flowery/fruity backbone. Same thing with the taste, first drink seemed shockingly abrubdt but settles on the palate from 2nd drink on into this magnificent spicey clove and Ohhh so smooth. No alcohol taste w/ perfect warming...how that is accomplished I'll leave to De Proefbrouwerij...finishes dry. this is excellent night capper material and to me it improves slightly when it warmed a bit when the fruity flavors were revealed."
"Drinkability- Should have gotten more than one bottle while I had the chance. This beer is excellent. ABV is extremely well hidden as well."
"inebrius, you may have under rated this one. Thanks for the bottle. Now, to try and obtain it. I'm in for a 7-case layer."
"When liquid hits glass immediate aromas begin to fill a room like funky incense cones or grade ten biology class. A stew of elderly tree fruit, cobblestone paths alongside Autumn tannic rivers, mushroom sorbet, wet hockey bags and a hint of lime leaf penetrates your skull. The smell will have you expecting this powerful wallop of sour to tear into your buds like tiny chainsaws but surprise! try some fig jelly on a washed rind double cream and wheat toast chased with olives Provençal. Yup, a retronasal blast of stinky aged cheese escorts the tripel-like flavors all the way through the pipes. Charged and lively and hinting alcohol only by way of spice I'm beginning to depress as my glass and bottle are drained. Seekers of experience need more beer like this."
"Wow I did not know what to expect from this but i found this fabulous and very drinkable..will buy again."
"Strange, unassertive brett character. A funky brew, almost Fantomesque in its yeast taste. Nice, tart, coating flavor, quite fruity, with notes of pineapple, apples, orange and lemon. Fizzy carbonation. A flavorful brew."
"Wow, this is not a good beer. It has the color of a cloudy urine sample. The smell is horribly sour. The taste might be better, but when you catch the whiff of the smell it almost turned my stomach. The mouthfeel is alright, but nothing to write home about. There is no way I would ever buy this beer again."
"Interesting golden brew with some of the notes of the bacterias that make Rodenbach and the like so complex, but this example is lacking something that takes it beyond the curiously sour beer that it exists as now."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: I saw the word Flemish on the label and assumed Flemish Sour, but after trying the beer it doesnt really seem to fit in that category very well (although I am not well-versed in the style). Pours a bright yellow color with a thin white head the dissipated quickly. Very thin lacing. The aroma is almost exactly like a dry, peppery champagne. Light-bodied and crisp with yeast, pepper and yes a little sourness. There are also some fruit and coriander undertones. The finish is very dry and a little vinous. This is a rather unique beer all in all and I liked it."
"Maybe this beer is ""wild"" and the other one I tried was ""amber"". The other one said it was wild. So, this is good beer. It's really like Orval and I will buy another bottle and probably several more. It is an aperitif beer or an ultimate first beer. you can choose which way you want to go but, this is the real thing and I suggest you buy some. It's tasty."
"Pours a lightly hazy straw gold color. Topped by a white head that is held up by a solid spritzy carbonation. The aroma is dusty, musty, grassy, with hints of tropical fruit, lemony, peach, and banana. The smell is definitely quite complex. The taste is quite dry at first, and then the Brett hits; it is like sucking on an old shoe. The unmistakably leathery, horse blanket dominates the finish. Similar in some respects to an aged Orval, but with out the hop presence. There is a bit of lemon up front before the Brett. Ignoring the Brett funk, this is a nice light straight forward zippy Belgian golden ale. With the Brett it gains immensely in complexity and funk, I happen to like this, but then again I am a Lambic junky."
"Pours a light straw color with a creamy white head and copious fine carbonation. Good head retention. Aroma is light and fresh with citrus notes. Flavor has a light fruit start with a delicate dry middle and a tart finish. A lingering tart/hoppy finish remains. Mouthfeel is light and dry. A well-balanced brew except for the lingering prevalence of the finish."
"Tried the amber ale and liked it all right so gave a chance to the wild ale. It comes from a tall corked and caged 750 ml. It pours a hazy gold with a white head that leaves an archipelago of bubbly formations across the top of the beer. Tart smells dominate with just a hint of citrus and funky barnyard smells. It's certainly reminiscent of a lambic. The taste is something that takes time to become a friend. It's tartness and apparent lack of balance is a bit off-putting at first, but the flavor starts to make sense after half a glass or so. The name may come from the wild yeast, but wild describes the flavor well. It's not refined or elegant but enjoyable nonetheless. The alcohol is not over the top in the smell or taste, but this is resolutely not a session beer."
"750ml bottle. This is a good looking beautiful yellow golden glowing beer with a thick bright white head. It let off a powerful tart and honey scent once poured. The taste is crisp clean tart creamy and refreshing. Warming the beer did not really improve the flavors since it was already a tasty beer. A good introduction to the sourness of Belgian beers since it is not overpowering and so crisp and clean that the flavors rapidly grow on you. Not outstanding but a solid product."
"Overall, not a bad beer, especially if you like lambics. This is styled as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale but the mix of Brett and spices in this beer didn't make it one of my favorites."
"This cloudy, pale golden beer is quite funky smelling. I like that. I imagine that if you do not like traditional lambics, this beer will not appeal to you because they use two yeats strains that are commonly found in lambics (Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces). The aroma is quite complex smelling musty, flowery, and of horse blanket. It is smooth drinking, with a fruitiness reminiscent of apples and honey. It finishes dry with some spiciness, probably from the high alcohol. There is a slight hint of sourness, that could just be an effect from the dry finish."
"Light murky blonde with a garden smell, hay, funk, apple-tart. Taste confirms the bottle's Brett promises. Dry like hell with salt hints. Medium bodied, fresh, eminently refreshing. Delicious brew. A poet that no one understands. Piece of art, cheers John."
"The smell was odd to say the least, ""wild"" is a misnomer. In 1991 as a 20 year old college student, I went to the Kentucky Derby, spent 10 long hours in the infield of Churchill Downs, met several future ex-wives, never saw a horse and woke up in the parking lot the next morning, shoeless, with a smell of stale beer, fresh cut grass, horse urine, and wet dog overcoming me. This beer smelled exactly like that May morning 12 years ago. Ugghhh. Wild, vulgar, and nasty all at once. Unbelievable. Odd tasting tart, spritzy, bubbly sweet champagne like taste. I thought this would be like a spicy belgian dubbel. Instead it's the bastard son of a sun skunked Duvel and Andre Brut Champagne. Sweetness fades, dryness in the body, then a chalky, metallic lingering finish. Sour puckering aftertaste. I drank it all, and seriously regret it. Highly charged, bubbly carbonation, but very hard to drink. Sorry Bum, I couldn't get into this one."
"Medium gold color, cloudy. Large foamy head. Aroma is tart and sour with a hint of orange peel. A medium bodied Ale. It not very sour for a Flemish sour ale. Yeasts are fairly bright, yet the malts arent very sweet and fruity as I was expecting. OK, so it neither sweet enough nor sour enough. Yet, it an interesting beer. It does balance what sweet and sour characteristics are available. And the wild yeast flavors are interesting. It also a very refreshing beer. Hides the 9.0% alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Overall: Quite strange, a mix between a Blonde and a Tripel with some lambic Duvel-ian character, the triple-fermentation with two yeasts makes for a tasty unique style beer. The feint of heart may not take to it. Well worth a try."
"Comments  This is a very interesting brew. I was disheartened to see only four other reviews. Id like to see what other experienced BAs have to say about this one."
"Very hazy yellow-orange with dense off-white head that held. Heavy yeast and citrus on the nose, some mustiness. Spicy on the tip of the tongue, the carbonation stings the tongue, distinctive yeasty citrus across the tongue, and it somehow becomes slightly sweet at the back of the throat. Feels thick and very drinkable for a 9%. Trying to think of a food that will go well with this and somehow a lemmon-dill cream sauce over salmon comes up but I'm not normal."
"Pours a hazed pale yellow with a massive fluffy white long lasting head. The smell consists of a musty yeast smell with a light fruity background that isnt bad, but quite different in an odd way. This is one beer that is out there in its execution of a beer! I taste again the musty yeast with cinnamon spicing, hops, and alcohol. The taste is all over the place but is extremely interesting. This is a light to medium bodied brew and it finishes uhsweetuhdry. There is not anything smooth about this beer and I dont believe it is what the brewers intended either. It is bold in its own unique way. Not with hops, not with an overwhelming alcohol taste, but with a bouncing transition of flavors. Whoah! Im labeling this a must try. Not that its great, but that its oh so interesting! Thanks BelgianBum! Op uw gezonheid!"
"The beer pours a blurry lemon yellow color, the head is substantial in size, creamy in consistency, bright white in color and as it dissolves, and a thick and glutinous sheet of lace is left behind to seal off the glass. The nose is a bit medicinal, sweet malt, citrus like, with the start sweet and loaded with malt, top is middling in feel. Finish is tart as in lemon like, the acidity cautious, the hops spicy in their bite and the herbal like tones are quite evident, quite dry aftertaste that lingers on after the beer is long gone"
"This one is a fun strong golden that fermented with some wild brettanomyces. The brett is not over done. It does provide a low level earthiness to it, which adds some complexity. Malty up front with some wild yeastiness to it. Rather low fruity ester for a Belgian but the finish dry and hoppy."
"Pungent aromas of rubbing alcohol slightly masked by decreasingly subtle phenolic aromas. The beer is nice and sweet up front -- very lively -- with a brief flash of oak wood, rotten vegetables, and gently creeping bitterness. It's a tasty beer for sure and fairly unique, though it ressembles Duvel and similar beers a fair amount. The slightly off flavor at the end gives this beer its character."
