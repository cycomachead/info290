"This one was just out there for me. Maybe an adventurous person would like it, but it just didn’t work for me."

"O: A really unusual and addictive brew that I'll probably put in my rotation of staples."

"Hazy bronze colour with a thick creamy head of foam. A grassy hop smell. Taste is of grain and a nondescript bitterness that does remind me of grass but more of an earthiness going on. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Good."

"Crispy and sharp all the way through. Little sweet hint of the same type of rice you'd taste in a better Sake. Carbonation was present but not at all overwhelming. Really enjoyed the dry earthy after taste. I could easily put this down with a sushi roll and enjoy the complimenting flavorings. In a nutshell it like was a bastard child of a wheat or Sake and an ale, I had no problem giving it a home with me."
""

"Overall: Not sure what to think of this beer. Good and interesting. I'll revisit this one again."
"Hmmm - not brilliant. That said, the age of the bottle probably doesn't help. Looks OK if rather cloudy; the aroma and flavour are pretty lacklustre. Husky malt and stewed leaves are the main course. Body is alright and relatively thick. Drinkable but unexciting - it just doesn't have that much going for it. No need to seek it out."

"O: this is it! - excellent accompaniment for sushi... this was an outlier - this is usually a bit more sparkling and crisp, but still nectary - more vibrant fruitiness... always a treat though - definitely worth checking out if you've never had it"
""
"Pours a nice orange red amber with a nice white head. Has a great aroma. Lots of dark sediment (which I assume is the red rice). This is a living beer! What is so great is that the bubbles continuously move the rice particles around. Cool! Nice slightly sweet smell. Good taste with the slightest of sweetness at the backend due to the rice. Very easy beer to drink and lots of substance."

"O: I was anticipating a sake tasting beer but this is nothing of the sort. It is, however, quite interesting and I think it's quirky beers like this that are going to put Japan on the craft beer map instead of their middle of the road faux American stuff."

"Very mundane version of Belgium pale ale. Meets the basic description but nothing special, unless you consider that it’s made with red rice."
""
""
""
"O - Very unique; a curious beer for the curiously minded."

"Neat find on tap at Beer Revolution, one of the most unique brews I've had to date and could almost be its own style ... If oatmeal stout is sufficiently different to qualify as distinct, a beer made with red rice and sake yeast damn straight qualifies as well. Don't get me wrong, it does have some Belgian character. This brew is an unusual color that I can best describe as red apple juice, not quite as sparkly as the darker pale ales and IPAs, with a decent quantity of noticeably large white bubbles. Smells like nutty malt, rich sweet yeast, and fermented honey, along with some banana and spice esters. The taste diverges from Belgian though, butterscotch and strawberry vanilla custard (again with a hint of banana) with a pungent nuttiness like wild rice. The unique grist is really adding something distinct to the flavor. Although not aggressively boozy, the latter does reveal itself over time. I can also detect some floral, grassy hops in the middle. Fairly aggressive carbonation. The finish is crisp and there is a sake-like graininess that scrubs the palate clean after each sip. Wow. Fruity and yet still quite dry, with the wild rice nuttiness persisting right up until the finish. This one is a keeper and ignore the price point: Try it at least once."

"The head is just fabulous. Copious amounts and decent lacing. Hazy light golden fluid with a few specks here and there. Aroma is light bodied and grainy with a touch of yeast. Sweet honey notes flow in bring out the light malt. Taste is flat out great. Red rice malt gives the flavors of light pilsner malt and it's sweet grain character. Subtle amounts of light fruits from apples to a hint of strawberry and bubblegum . Trace honey and mild pepper lead into a dry finish with a mild Saaz hop signature. Super mellow Belgian yeast presence that ties it all together. The Belgo-fruit notes are here but in mild form as with the funk. I mentioned the dry finish. It is hard to do it justice as it is perfect and delicately done. A super quenching and refreshing beer that begs you to quaff as much as you like while packing a respectable alcohol wallop. Feel is light and creamy in the carbonation with a just right weight to the liquid, light and supple. Incredibly drinkable this beer is one of the best session ale I've had period. Flat Out Great Beer! I may not fir they typical BSPA profile but wow is to good."

"overall, it's okay. nothing I think i'd buy again, but nothing I regretted trying. 7% is an admirable level of alcohol."

"The taste continues the theme of bizarre and intriguing. It is absolutely on the sour side with a fungusy yeast tone, but an oddly familiar flavour right behind it. It tastes like you're chewing on a flower....I want to say honeysuckle. It has an obvious sweetness to it, while not seeming all that sugary. It has a very smooth, thin mouthfeel, which unfortunately means no fun, but the thin, smoothness goes well with the sweet, flowery flavour. Despite this, the alcohol is oddly not present. It's 7% and has just a bit of citrusy hops to hide behind along with a very present funky yeast flavour. I'm not sure why it doesn't taste hotter. As a fan of alcohol flavour, I'm a little disappointed, but it's hard to be when this beer is such an all-around treat. It is very out there, very different from what I've had before, and very out-of-the-box experience."
""

"M&O: refreshing on the mouthfeel, medium-bodied, the flavour profile is quite simple yet fragrant and nice, while the alc. content is definitely there to assert its presence without any pretentiousness. All in all, a very fragrant and distinctive beer worth tasting once in a life time, really."

"Overall - Again, this is unlike any beer i've had. I actually was not a huge fan of the White Ale from Hitachino nest despite it being the highest rated Japanese beer period...(too spicy for my liking) but this little gem is a keeper. It's perhaps the most difficult beer to describe and break down in terms of smell and flavor, but it is quite amazing. Even at it's price point, it's worth having when you can. one of my favs"

"Overall: A very easy drinking beer. Light, crisp, and very refreshing. I've been pleasantly surprised by these beers from Hitachino's Nest beers. Keep an eye out and give them a try."

"O: For a beer that uses adjuncts, this beer has an interesting taste and seems a bit like sake in some aspects."

"24 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in July 2012. Pours fairly cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, peach, clove, pepper, citrus zest, honey, bready grain, floral, grass, herbal, and earthy yeast esters. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, peach, clove, pepper, lemon, cracker, bready grain, honey, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of peppery spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, cracker, bready grain, honey, floral, grass, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; nice malt and yeast spiciness balance; and zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian style golden ale! Very nice complexity and balance of fruity and spicy esters with malt balance; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. This was a very enjoyable offering."

"Food match: Japanese food + Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale = Brain Sensory Awesomeness Overload (or BSAO for short). Specifically a Yakiniku rice burger would be ace with this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am thoroughly impressed by this beer and will be trying other Hitachino brews very soon!"
""
""
"O: Pretty easy to drink and the alcohol in this beer is well hidden - not the best example of the style but it is interesting that it is made with red rice."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. It pours an off-white head over a hazy, dark golden body. The label says it should have a pink tint. The aroma is mostly fruity, but there’s also a little touch of cooked rice, in a pleasant way that is. the flavor is fruity with some berries, and some sweet pale malts as a base. Medium to full body, feeling a bit papery. The finish has a balancing bitterness. A nice one, unusual but nice, amazing with sushi."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Taste okay I guess, won't return to it though."
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed the flavor and drinkability of this beer, but it fell short in all other categories. Honestly not worth the $5 for an 11.2 oz bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall, quite enjoyable. I'd have it again, but I won't spend time seeking it out."
""
"O: This doesn't try to hit you with ... well ... any of itself. It's very balanced and satisfying. It seems like a lighter kind of brew, but leaves a warmth that's very satisfying. Definitely drink again when a more subtle beer's called for."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy dark pink color with about a half inch off-white head that that didn't stay around for too long. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is bready malt, rice, raspberries, strawberries, and some nuts. It tastes like bready malt, rice, artificial strawberries/candy, and a bit of a red wine/grape flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a solid overall brew, but nothing about this really impressed me at all. But with that being said, I'd certainly drink it again and it is worth trying."
""
""
""
"A unique brew to be sure, glad I tried it when I had the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Quite different and glad I tried it. Check it out."
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours cloudy golden with a quickly dissipating white head. There are aromas of rice and yeast. There is a mild alcohol smell as well as some sweet malts. There are flavors from the rice and the yeast. Like a previous reviewer said, this does remind me of cooked rice. There is some hop bitterness on the back end. I can also taste some of the malt and some alcohol kick. There is some citrus tartness to this as well. It's definitely interesting in the flavor department. This beer is medium bodied with abundant carbonation. It is smooth and drinks fairly well. Overall, this is a good beer, but it is a bit overpriced for what it is. I probably wouldn't purchase this one again, but you might like it more than I did."

"O: Finally--a Kiuchi beer that I enjoy! I don't know whether I've gotten unlucky with bad/old bottles up until now, but I did not enjoy their White Ale, Espresso Stout, or Sweet Stout. I'm really glad I gave this one a shot, though. Very tasty, and well-balanced! A great beer to try if you're wanting something a bit different."
""
""
""

"Cloudy, golden-amber body with a big yeast load and a soapy white head. Unusual and distinct aroma reminds me of cocoa, nuts, guava, and cherry plus an underlying adjunct signature. Lightly sweet, waxy flavor with rye notes and hop characters suggesting dry tea leaves. Also has some acidity as if from tart berries. Finish is drying and moderately bitter. Interesting beer."
""
""
"The palate is so light crisp and fresh, this must be the rice. Zinging across teh palate with hints of sourness, balanced really well with that crisp malt and just enough bitterness in teh finish. Unusual and very refreshing and delicious. This is a great and much more flavorful alternative quaffer to go with your yakitori or grilled hamachi collar...I wish more Japanese places would serve it."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, smooth and yet crisp, with a light body, light crisp carbonation and a light feel. The aftertaste is roasted, and this went down smooth and easy, hiding the ABV very well. A very nice beer that was quite enjoyable and very different."
""
""
"O: This is an interesting beer. I really wouldn’t consider it a Belgian strong pale ale though. But is was tasty – and this brewery continues to impress me with it’s unusual brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out with a really cool looking red color. It almost looks artifical. The head is fizzy and with a pinkish color to it. The smell of the beer was decent, I wasn't really able to get much out of the aroma on this beer besides some light spicy notes. The taste of the beer was a bit on the spicy side with some sweet malts in the back end. The mouthfeel was light and drinkable. Overall I thought the beer looked really cool but the rest of the beer was kind of a let down. I would still drink it again though."
"This is the first rice based beer that I've actually enjoyed. Good flavors and the body actually holds up well. It's a little pricey, but worth it."
""
""
""
"Not bad, certainly worth a try. Interesting to say the least. Though probably not a repeat purchase."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Neat to try out. At first when I had this I thought that putting into the category of a Belgian strong pale ale was incorrect, but as I drink more of it, I think that's a reasonable place for this beer which is distinctly Japanese and very unique in flavor and style. Glad to try, but not sure I would call this highly drinkable. It's an acquired taste - interesting, challenging to define, delicate and complex, and to that end good overall. But I can't see myself going out of my way to get it again. Still, as I look at the other ratings, I think this is a good beer and so despite my counter-arguments on only trying it once, I'll rate this as good overall."

"Had this at an Asian restaurant in Boston. Pours a reddish brown tint with little to no head. In the nose I was picking up some malt sweetness and dried fruit aromas. The taste was very 'floral' with a little tartness as well. Pleasantly light. Can't tell this is a 7% ABV beer. The rice really comes through in the finish - as an avid sake drinker - I really enjoyed this."

"Very nice! Poured into a nondescript tulip glass, a slightly hazy orange-peach color with a golden-hued, fluffy head that retained well throughout the session. Aroma was pretty much what I'd expect sweet rice to smell like, notes of citrus zest, a bit grassy. Nice crisp taste, somewhat reminiscent of sake up front, with tones of lemon zest, apple skin, peach, and white grapes; just a touch of sourness. Bready and grassy, very light and enjoyable. Light-bodied and very drinkable."
"Pours an appetizing hazy reddish copper with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Aroma is somewhat malty and a teeny bit fruity, if not strong. Flavor is - hmmm, this is interesting. Not malty, really, rather fruity, quite different from other beers I have tried, not sweet and not bitter, just tasty. Some yeasty hints. Texture is smooth and fizzy, above-average body. An interesting beer."
"O: This is a decent beer, but nothing to write home about. I was challenged by my guy at the beer store to enjoy it, and I did. It's not great, but I'm glad I finally had my first Kiuchi."
"Overall I liked this beer a good bit. The taste is really great, very subtle but complex and well balanced. I think I'm in the wrong season for it though. First time I had seen single 12 oz. available so I picked it up, would enjoy this in the summer months a little more I think."
"This has everything I love in a belgian beer. I am not good with adjectives but this beer has what I like."
"Overall this beer was interesting as an experiment. Wouldn't buy it again at this price point. As a side note; it didn't exactly scream ""sake"" to me, but I'm not a connoisseur."
"Overall this is a fantastic little gem of an ale. The rice really adds a lot without masking or detracting from the inherent quality of the base beer. It tastes authentically Japanese (since it is) and not artificial like many of the American attempts at this (or similar Japanese) style(s). A must try, if nothing else so you can say you had a red rice ale!"
"O: I'm not sure if my taste buds changed over time, or if the freshly imported batch tastes different than what I'd had previously, but I was stricken how different it was from what I remembered. However, I still love this ale. I relish any opportunity to taste this fine complex ale as often as I am able. It is just superb."
"Orangish light amber in color.Foggy.Yellowish white head.Foam layer is dense but quite brief with medium size bubbles.Fresh fruit -apricot & peaches- aroma.Yeasty & bready notes.Spicy,bready & gentle fruity flavors.Smooth sour mouthfeel, light carbonation,light body too.Coriander & apricot aftertaste.What a nice refreshing experience!Very well balanced flavors & aromas.Very good drinkability."
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a moderately hazy brown-amber beer with a very small head. The nose is somewhat vinous, very fruity, with some sweet malt. Flavor is not terrible, but not very interesting either: strong, sweet malt, with moderately high bitterness (not even a hint of hop flavor, though). Alcohol is lightly hot, but it doesn't detract from the taste. Highly fruity yeast character, as the aroma indicated. I've had sekihan, but this doesn't resemble the flavor, far as I remember. Do they mean purple rice? It doesn't taste like that either. I don't think the rice contributes much to the flavor, but I'm not sure. Absent the label, I would have guessed this is just a strong, undistinguished ale."
"overall: unique with some complex attributes, decent abv, very pleasant to drink."
"O: An interesting beer, pretty tasty. Didn't know it was a BSPA until I logged onto BA when I got home, kind of surprised me, but wasn't sure what style I thought it would be anyway. A nice change of pace beer."
"Oh, and it features a cartoon owl on the label so that immediately boosts the score right there."
"O- A very good beer. Unlike anything I have every had. Very drinkable, almost sessionable, which is remarkable given the abv."
"Finish: short but full of burst. sweetness and some light hops at he end. truly an achievement."
"The reddish/pinkish hue right off the back is pretty unique to this beer. Nice lite sweet smell and very pleasent taste make this a good session beer. Def must try if this is available in your area"
"O - I'm not sure this beer really knows what it is or wants to be. So many things going on here without any one thing taking the lead in the flavors. I feel like I could come up with new descriptors for the flavors in here all night long. I give this high scores for uniqueness and and a fun and different drinking experience. Belgian Strong Pale Ale...I suppose it is a bit of a catch-all sort of category, and I don't really have a better idea what to call it, but it isn't like any other one I've ever had. Tasty and a bit confounding...worth a try."
"Nothing great to say about this beer. Nothing bad either, it just did not make an impact either way for me. Pretty light flavor with an odd undertone. Would drink just fine very cold, so maybe a good one to have after doing some yard work. My wife thought the bottle was cute."
"O- Very interesting and will stick out in my mind and I'm likely to return to the novelty."
"Overall: The body of the beer si meduim light, and the finish is a little long. This is a good beer wonderful flavors and well balanced. I really enjoyed the crispness of the beer at the end."
"d- i could bath in this stuff."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, salty, sake, and rice. In the taste, sweet rice, malty, almost like a really sweet red ale. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a hint of dry rice malt in the aftertaste. OK, sweet taste, hides the 7%."
"I sincerely hope this was a bad bottle, as it seems most others have really liked it...but this was just not good. Looking for something else!"
"Overall: I have to admit this is my Kiuchi beer and I'm very impressed. Most of the European and American beers that I've had have a similar taste or feel with their own unique spin. Not Hitachino Red Rice Ale. The unique taste and even more unique smell is worth the price alone."
"Yes indeed. What is to say? This is a fantastically unique beer, that really has some interesting points. I can't say it's something I'd enjoy regularly, but Kiuchi have come up with something yet again (as they did with their cedar-aged Japanese Classic Ale) that is unique and memorable."
"Not my thing, but starts to grow on you. Probably won't be revisiting though."
"I would have to say this is by far the mellowest Belgian Strong Pale Ale I have ever had. I like the beer because it doesn't taste bad but it really doesn't have much flavor going on. Maybe I have been drinking too many beers with a big kick in your mouth flavor. Maybe this is one of those good normal beers that the latest Beer Advocate magazine is talking about; where you don't need to have these extreme flavors. So overall I like the beer and I really have not faults at all with it. I would like to buy this again after a while and see if I have the same results."
"D - Stuff is pretty solid. The ABV is not noticeable at all here. There is a very unique flavor profile going on here with the rice and some fun, crazy semidark fruit flavours. Great mouthfeel on this stuff. I'd try it again."
"The high carbonation not only lifted the ale off the palate nicely, but aided drinkability and kept the mouthfeel very light. This did not taste like 7% ABV! The drinkability reminded me a lot of Duvel although the hop character is very different between the two beers. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, and I am really glad I got to try this unique beer."
"T: The rice is definitely there. Comes through with an almost sake-like flavor. Slight earthiness and a bit of a sour aftertaste. For some reason, I got the idea in my head that it tasted like Budweiser and that kind of killed the experience for me. It's still a good beer and undoubtedly better than Bud."
"D: An unusual, yet totally drinkable take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"Final Thoughts - I found this to be a very intriguing brew. I mean rice?? It seems like such an obvious ingredient for beer, but you almost never encounter it. This was unique for sure, but didn't ""wow"" me. The flavors were nice though. I would definitely recommend it. I look forward to trying more from Kiuchi."
"NOTE: Their website states that it uses a sake yeast."
"Drinkable Easy to down this. I don't know if it has Sorachi hops but the tangy is refreshing. Not sure it fills my Beer lust but it's a plus for unusual while not being nasty."
"D -- So unusual and approachable that it makes you want more. Very nice offering, I'll be on the look out for other products from this brewery."
"D- Very easy to drink"
"D- i could easily sit on this beer all night if funds were not a problem. very easy and satisfying to drink."
"D: Clearly a unique brew. Whatever the red rice is, I think it is giving it that. Expensive, but a solid effort and well worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Not sure what to make of this one. It's interesting but I doubt I'd go it again."
"Bottle solicited from Medi-ya Japanese Supermarket, Liang Court at Clarke Quay, Singapore."
"Drinkability: Just a weird beer, although I did warm up to it after a little while. Plus, it did go well with the sushi I was having."
"The light flavours could really use higher carbonation."
"Drinkability: well, this beer is far from perfect, but it has enough interesting characteristics to keep it refreshing (though I won't be pounding it all night). Pretty decent."
"This beer pours a burnt amber color with very little head. At first glance you might mistake this brew for a barleywine. The aroma is very floral with a hint of fruit. The front of the palate is met with a slight hop note followed by a touch of caramel. The finish has notes of hibiscus flowers. This beverage goes down so smooth, especially for having a slightly higher ABV. One of the more unique beers I've tried."
"Medium bodied with low but effective carbonation. This was unique and decent, but nothing I'd flock back to."
"Overall this was an interesting beer that didn't really seem to fit in a specific category. Both the fruit and the malts were subtle and it would have been entirely forgettable if not for the fine carbonation. Not worth seeking out but it's not worth turning down either."
"Anyone with an introduction to good sake and a taste for good beer should appreciate this beer. I can see where some of the lower marks for this beer come from, it has an overall character that puts it a notch away from the beers most people have tried. It has a tartness, organic character, and floral quality that is unique - and to me, very enjoyable."
"Pours a one finger head that quickly disapates to nothing but some clingy bubbles. In the glass I smell fruit strawberry and sne other tart fruit, bubble gum, lager yeast character, sweet oak, apple. Tastes like tart strawberry, lager grainy notes. Drys out on the finish. Medium carbing, light body quite drinkable for this abv, not for this $.."
"A really nice and rather uncommon beer, the fruity tones mixed very well with sushi at RAW in Stockholm."
"This slightly reminds me of a regular Budweiser, but with real flavor. I never agreed with them using rice in their beer, but this example is better. I think Budweiser lovers may enjoy this beer as a transition to better beers . The flavor is up front and fades quickly to almost no aftertaste."
"Taste: Rice and starch dominate. Crisp, fruity, and moderate bitterness. Kind of a chalky and herbal taste, very unusual."
"The beer pours a red/orange/brown color with a white head. The aroma is smoke, toffee, tobacco, leather and toasted malt. The flavor is similar. I still get a lot of tobacco and smoke, but I also get some meaty notes. There is also some rice, grass and fruit notes in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I wish this wasn't 5 dollars a bottle where I live, I would gladly switch hit between this and Noble pils all the time. This beer had a great color. Clear and Red. The rice flavor was present and reminded me of saki. The Carbonation was foamy and good and I could easily sit back all summer and drink this by the fireside."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light reddish color ale with a medium white foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma of fruity ester and light sugar with dry malt base if somewhat unique. Taste is also a strange mix between ester with a balance sweet malt base. The grain bill is definitely unique as I had never tasted red rice before. Body is bit light with good carbonation and alcohol is really not apparent. Interesting experiment and definably something I would drink more then once."
"D: Very drinkable. I will definitely try again."
"A unique beer to say the least. Pale rose-lovely colour with a light head and delicate lacing. Aromas are sweet, yeasty and sligtly candied, in a soft raspberry gummy lolly kind of way. The rice adds an almost sake dimension. Not much in the way of bitterness and alcohol is virtually undetectable. Still for it's light-medium body there is plenty of sweet malt and sake phenolic flavour alongside light fruit flavours while managing to finish dry. An adventurous beer that succeeds."
"Drinkable but seems more like a light English Pale Ale."
"recommended"
"this is a interesting beer to say the least there's no reason not to try it and quite a few reasons why you should. very unique beer and it's a little confusing at times but enjoyable nonetheless"
"This is most certainly a unique and inventive ale. It's also not too hard to put back, even if that dryness goes a long way."
"D: Pretty drinkable, this is certainly an outside the box sort of beer that I really enjoyed."
"Not bad carbonation, but I don't think I'd have this too often. Its just a bit weird."
"Comes in a bottle with a whimsical label featuring an owl or maybe some kind of native Japanese snow fowl. The most striking thing about this beer is its color: other reviewers call it amber, but I swear this stuff has a deep magenta tinge to it. There is a lot of sediment floating around in it like a snowglobe (I assume this is the reason for the snowy owl on the label?) and this beer, if nothing else, looks really great. Didn't like the smell, which I can only say struck me as a sour pilsner smell. Taste was not bad, different somehow (which I guess is the rice?), but just pretty so-so. Pricey and not something I'll necessarily seek out in the future, but definitely worth a try."
"D - This has been one of the more interesting beers I've drank its really in a style all of its own kinda weird but still enjoyable its still worth a try sometime"
"Pours a nice dark amber color and has about an inch an a half of head. I just love this color. It has a ""dirty"" quality to it. An excellent mixture of flavors. First you get that orangey zest, which is just perfect, and then you taste the wheat. Although a little pricey ($5-6 I believe), it is well worth it. Once you snap off the cap the smell alone will intrigue you. There is so much going on in that smell. The red rice, the orangey smell, the wheat--it's damn enticing. I will definitely purchase more of these in the near future."
"First up is the Red Rice, and holy this beer has the most unusual smelling beer I've come across. My best attempt to sum up the aroma is that it smells like an alcoholic, starchy, fruit, gummy bear. Yeah, it's weird, but very alluring. Add an orange-tangerine-peachy colour to this you have a one-of-a-kind beer. It doesn't disappoint. It tastes less like a gummy bear than you'd think from the smell and that general 'fruit' flavour turns in to a strawberry-like flavour. Toss in some yeastiness and some graininess, then some toasted rice and an almost earthilike quality and you get Kiuchi's Hitachino Nest Red Rice. Only the Japanese could produce something so weird, yet so good."
"D: Goes down easy with a great mouth feel and decent amount of flavor. Definitely a unique beer that is worth a try."
"It is very drinkable and I am really suprised it doesn't really taste 7%."
"Drinkability is good. Alcohol well concealed. Interestingly tasty beer. This brewery continues to impress me."
"D - Drinkable sure...but meh. Nothing too pushing either way."
"Very impressed with this as my first try from the brewery. A bold move from the brewer!!"
"Im still trying to work out how this is classed is as a BSPA as to be honest ive never tried a BSPA that has been brewed with rice anyways onto the brew itself it pours a deep guava hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a three finger head and lacing everywhere,the aroma is fruity,fruity rice,it has a nice full mouthfeel with grapefruit,cococnut,creamy rice and vanilla all coming thru on taste,suprisingly enough i really dig this brew it is definately out there but yet still a beer and to be honest i couldnt compare it to any other brew that i have tried,if you havnt seen or tried i definately recommend."
"Was expecting more from the Hitachino family of beers, especially after having just discovered their white ale - which I now adore. It poured an interesting reddish brown color, with minimal head. Smell was thin, a little sour, and not very sweet. Taste was a cross between a Belgian and a.. Saporro? Not sure, but it wasn't the best. And it was a little ""dirty"" tasting too. Maybe I just wasn't expecting the straw/hay components to come through in this style/brand of beer. I'd have it again, but it wasn't a favorite."
"Unique to my beer tasting history. It is a good beer, but I can't see myself having it too often."
"*Style correction: This beer is not a Belgian Strong Pale it is a Rice beer (25%of grain bill) fermented with an Ale and Sake Yeast."
"I'm definitely loving the Hitachino Nest beers -- each one is so unique!"
"I don't believe I will be buying any more of this brew. It's not terrible, but both this as well as a couple others have now left me pretty ""blah"" about Hitachino Nest in general."
"D: This is one of my go-to beers that I often bring to BYOB Asian places. Pairs great with food, but not something I usually drink by itself."
"It might be worth noting that this beer might be better than my score reflects, too. For me it was great at first, but I got bored of it. Plus, I'm not sure that it would be worthwhile as a stand-alone brew outside of a food pairing."
"A very satisfying, well balanced, and interesting in its mirror world character strong yeasty ale. Another Hitachino offering that defies current BA classification - I suppose this would require the existence of a 'Japanese Rice Ale' category or the like, one better befitting this beer than any particular Belgian shoehorning that seems to be going on here."
"Drinkability: Hitachino brews are always so damn expensive, and unfortunately this doesn't cut it for me. It's interesting and easy drinking, but I feel like the complexity is lacking. Again, maybe this isn't meant to be cellared, though it was by accident in some ways. I'd like to try a fresh bottle, but am I going to pay $5 to see what the deal is? I'm not sure."
" As I poured I noticed a pink tone in the beer. The head is impressive but fades quickly and there is very minimal lacing on the glass. The pink in the pour turned to a pink copper color in the glass. There is a creamyness on the tongue that is very pleasant. The alcohol does not show through as I thought it might in a light beer. The red rice really comes through well. The rice adds a distinct body when used as the primary ingredient. All around a very nice beer."
"Interesting beer that certainly doesn't feel like a belgian ale. Definitely worth a shot if you want a different take on a rice beer."
"Wow, really mixed feelings on this beer. Pours a hazy light gold, almost yellow, with massive white head...I mean massive. Good retention and lacing. Smell was very tart and sour I thought. Some tangy fruit and some yeast as well. Taste was somewhat bland. It was sweet, a little tart, and slightly fruity but I thought nothing really took over. And I scored it low because for a Belgian Pale this was far too sour I thought. Wasn't sweet enough. Mouthfeel was good, light and crisp. Overall it wasn't terrible just don't know how well it fit the style. I'm all for taking liberties but there seemed to be a bit too many here."
"Overall - I wouldn't be disappointed if I couldn't acquire any more of this one, but I enjoyed it nontheless. A unique taste and feel for us Americans."
"This was a visual beer. Poets speak of drinking in her loveliness with their eyes. I was drinking this beer with mine eyes, that way it was less physically intoxicating. The finger of head with good retention had a pinkish cast to it. Very different in my experience. The beer's color was a hazy reddish-pink, which suddenly put me in mind of the disaster area that is Chelada. The nose was cotton candy-like in its sweetness, like strawberries and sugar. Perhaps a bit too sweet for this guy. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a definite strawberry presence on the tongue. MUCH more drinkable than the nose had led me to expect. Finish had the same cotton candy quality that I had noted on the nose. Not bad, but a little too sweet overall for my taste."
"This was an interesting beverage, but simply too sweet. Something new that I won't be trying again."
"Word of warning - there's a lot of sludge at the bottom of the bottle. Be careful when pouring! The beer was reddish with an amber tint. The off-white cap produced some fine lacing and showed good head retention. The aroma was interesting, a bit nutty with cereal notes, a bit of dried rice character and sweet malt. More of the same in the flavour, but with a bit of caramel. It was quite sweet and reminded me of Japanese candy. Light to medium bodied with lower than average carbonation. Very dry. Quite an interesting brew. It seriously reminded me of Japanese candy."
"Its fairly drinkable."
"Drinkablity: Interesting brew that is full of contradictions. Hearty and refreshing with some qualities of a sour ale. One of a kind."
"Taste is not too pleasant, kind of harsh and leaves a deli meat after taste. I'm not really sure what's going on here but It's not a great taste. It's a bit over carbonated. Interesting to drink but I'd go with their white one over this."
"D - Kind of weak. The flavors are muddy and there is nothing that jumps out to make the beer interesting. Not an awful beer, just kind of bland and certainly not up to Kiuchi Brewery's normal standards."
"D: A very unique beer. Give it a try with sushi."
"Wow! This is a great beer of course I haven't tried that many rice beers but it definitely makes me want to find more. This reddish orange beer poured out with a decent amount a finger and half of foam and reduced to wisps of lacing. The floweral, hoppy, and malt beer is a good balance of characteristics. The taste is an amazing sensation of floweral, bit of colander peaking through and taste of rice."
"Drinkability: Different beer, good to try something new"
"D - Refreshing and drinkable but definitely a different tasting beer in my book. Personally I wouldnt have more than 2, just because I enjoy more traditional tasting beers."
"d: this was a very different beer with some interesting appearance and flavor, but the metallic flavor was too much; still worth a try"
"The alcohol is pretty well hidden, & there are a lot of ""light"" tastes in here. That sharpness on the tongue, plus the novely of flavors & high sugar presence makes me think I couldn't down too many of these. This is an interesting & complex brew, with something new to offer."
"This is an interesting beer. The color is off for a belgian strong pale, but it's unique composition explains that. Very drinkable, but watch the ABV."
"It has a strawberry and peach flavor to it that I've never really had before. Quite unique and well worth a try."
"Pours a transparent and slightly hazed pale golden orange yellow color with a small white head that leaves some soapy sticking. Slightly sour in the nose, a little bit of grapefruit, musty melon, peaches and possibly some funk. Fruity with a pretty unique malt structure due in fact, im sure, to the rice used in the brewing process. Interesting beer nonetheless, just enough bitterness, a little bit of sour/acidity, lemon and grapefruit skin and tart hard candy. Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. This ones complex enough to keep me very interested."
"MF&D the feel is great, carbonated, yet heavy enough to convey enough flavour to satisfy even the most discerning belgian connoisseurs (hopefully, since I really like this beer). the drink is great, something I could have for breakfast lunch dinner and more. the only thing holding the feel back imo is it is a bit too piercing and crisp, the carbonation should be bigger."
"Ive gotta admit, the interesting label is what caught my eye about this one and made me purchase it. Pours a pinkish/tan color.. one of the oddest colored beers I might have ever poured. Heavily carbonated, maybe a bit too much.. some fruity flavors are definitely tastes as well, raspberry/strawberry like to be specific. Has a tart taste as well and finishes very dry. Definitely unlike any beer I've had before. Hides the ABV pretty well too and is pretty drinkable. Glad I tried it, but I would never get this again especially for the price tag.. gotta love the different beers across the globe."
"Mouth: Flavor is citrusy with some mild berry notes, some peppery spicing, and an earthy finish with a light bitterness. Carbonation is a bit coarse and there's a bit too much of it. Body is just about right; not too delicate and not too heavy. Finish is dry from astringency. Interesting beer but not something I'm going to revisit."
"From a 11.2 oz bottle purchased locally. Aroma is a little green appley and a little yeast. Pale yellow gold that is a little cloudy with some yeast from the bottle. Big foamy white head that has staying power. Flavor is fruity with more apples and yeast. Bread dough malt flavors. Rice character comes through in the finish and keep the beer very dry. High carbonation. This would be a refreshing summer beer."
"D: An ok mouthfeel and taste combination, but the mouthfeel could have used a little bit more work. For a beer of such high ABV, I was expecting a bit smoother mouthfeel."
"The taste is rather similar but worse, yeasty sourt, bitter with shrap, sulphury dried apricots, rancid pears, and old bananas, a little straight cooked grain in the finish and unpleasant bitter after taste with sour metallic hint. It's very dry and sharp."
"Drinkability is great. You would never guess this is 8.5%"
"Overall- This is a great combination of traditional traits, as well as, an innovative take on ingredients. I was a little weary going into this beer. Was it worth $4.50ish for a single? It definitely exceeded my expectations. This will be a nice splurge beer in the future."
"D - Yeah, it's made with rice, but this ain't Budweiser. Give it a try."
"D: Gets points for uniqueness and style. Overall a solid good beer decent drinkability."
"On tap this tasted like carbonated vanilla syrup. I left about half the glass."
"I would be definitely down with getting this at a Japanese restaurant. It seems like it would pair nicely with Eastern cuisine. Always nice to stretch my palate on some new and different flavors."
"this pours a beatuful red color with four fingers of head that disapers fast, now that we have talked about what i liked, we will discuss what i dislike. the taste is dry and tastes of soap and a sour mash. thieir also is a bitter ans spicy taste left in my mouth that tingels my toung and not in a good way. all i can think is that i am chuging dish soap liquid, i hate this one and will never drink this one agan. i let this warm and it started tasting like dirt. this is almost as bad as it gets"
"World class, have to try the other Hitachino they have in thier cooler box!"
"I had this beer recently for the first time at Umami in San Francisco. One of my absolute favorite Japanese restaurants in the city. Always looking to try new beers - our server sold me on this ""trendy"" Red Rice Ale. Uh...red rice? Sounded interesting. I smelled hints of vanilla, and orange - and absolutely loved this beer. So - I thought I'd give it a proper review. Upon a second, more concentrated and semi-unbiased review. I still enjoyed it, though maybe not as much. A friend of mine nailed the smell of a jar of green olives. Which doesn't sound appetizing - but if you can get past this, you may still enjoy this beer. I'd compare it to a Japanese version of a Hefeweisen. Definitely worth drinking. Was a nice accompaniment to sushi. Enjoy..."
"This beer has a hazy light plum color with a very thin head. My bottle was fairly settled but there seems to be a larger-than-normal amount of yeast in suspension. Some nice sour aroma with a little funkiness in it, apparently from the rice. The body is a little thin and has a little underlying cherry."
"Interesting beer, not something I wold drink on a regular basis, but an awesome birthday present beer."
"A little bit thicker than I was expecting, but uniquely crisp and refreshing for a beer this syrupy. The carbonation aids in that crisp finish. This quality added to the (overall) soft flavors makes for quite a decent beer. Very drinkable and a fresh take on the style."
"D - Not harsh, just not tempting."
"Pretty good beer. Interesting flavor profile. This actually would go quite well with sushi or tempura. Good coversational beer, but I don't know if I would make this a regular purchase."
"quite interesting. not entirely sure if it's a ""belgian strong pale ale"" or blonde, but whatever..."
"Oh yeah, I think it's worth mentioning that this beer is listed here at 8,5%abv and the label on this thing says 7,0%."
"I really like beers that twist my expectations. This was quite enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Drinkability is moderate with moderate levels of alcohol and decent flavors."
"Overall I thought this was pretty good, a little different but still pretty good. I could see myself having it again one day, it has its time and place I am sure."
"As a novelty, it's drinkable. As a beer, it's not great. As for Belgian Strong Pale Ale....I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Taste is fun but peculiar of belgian yeast and it seems maybe souring yeast strains with a funky grain and adjunct bill of something like light malts, caramunich and beet sugar bill... no idea really but its quite peculiar but none the less very interesting. Mouthfeel is nice, but drinkabilty, hmm... I'll revisit, when there is a desire for the eclectic."
"with an equally good level of drinkability and the hefty 8.5% ABV well-masked behind a sweet, flavorful combination of unique flavors... Good stuff... Recommended..."
"The taste is a flavorful mix of seaweed wraps, sticky rice, gummi-bears, citrus hops, and saki. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, crisp, and leaves behind a fresh, bitter finish. Truly a Japanese take on a belgian style. Again, it's not something I can truly say I've enjoyed, but I'm definitely glad I tried this beer."
"D= If you luck out and get a small bottle like me, I'd say have a second, perhaps a third if you're dining with friends or something. Stick with one if you get the big Whole Foods bottle."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style while keeping the rice element prevalent. While this is one of the better rice ales that I’ve had, I’m really starting to get turned off by these beers as they typically just don’t seem to taste right even though I keeping trying to give them a fair chance."
"Pours a cloudy pinkish with an off white head with pink tones. Nose is mild with a slight alcohol presence. Very slight touch of yeast as well. Flavor is fruity with an odd ricey edge. Pretty odd really. Very earthy and plant like palate on it. Very unusual. Feel is good with a nice bubble to it. Borders on syrupy, but isn't quite there yet. Drinkable, sure. It's definitely a unique brew. But yet again, not sure if this one is worth going back to for the coin."
"Poured from a 720ml bottle into a conical pub glass. Nice light copper orange pour with small to medium white head. Very little lace. Cloudy with sediment floating about. Smell of cooked rice with a hint of citrus. Taste of orange and spice with a hint of sake. Alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was smooth with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable and a brew I'll probably rotate to every few months."
"This is a very unique beer. It wasn't at all what I was expecting and is certainly worth trying. I enjoyed the one I had, but I doubt I'll get it again. I still recommend trying it at least once."
"Pours out a slightly hazed pink-orange with a frothed white head that leaves some near solid sheets of lace. Nose is fairly clean with notes of cotton candy, apples, herbs, and eucalyptis. Flavor starts off with a sugariness akin to, as already mentioned, cotton candy or even doughnut glaze. Towards the middle, I get some apple, a big hit of strawberry, and some underlying mint. Finish is interestingly grainy (almost reminds me of steamed buckwheat groats) and drying. Extremely interesting, but there is the slightest cough medicine background note that bugs me just a bit. This kind of tastes like Strawberry & Cream Mad Dog (in the best way possible). Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a carbonation that is arousing but never becomes bothersome. Drinkability is really great, but there is a sweetness that lasts about the middle that wears on me. Very impressive. I've had the chance to drink this on and off for a few years now and it's always interesting."
"Drinkability- This was an interesting beer. I can't see myself drinking this beer all the time but it wasn't bad."
"This is interesting stuff, certainly unique, but unfortunately not all that drinkable on any kind of regular basis. There's something lacking here, which is only partially made up for with it's more unorthodox characteristics. It stands alone, as I've never had another beer like it, but probably won't need to revisit anytime soon."
"This is a very Japanese beer. Unless you are familiar with Japanese culture and foods, I don't think you would like it."
"Recommended for a try. Don't know if I'll go back to this, but I enjoyed trying it. Unique."
"surprisingly, quite appetizing on balance. Try some with sushi."
"T"
"Pours a dark orange gold with a short foamy off-white head. Nothing bad, nothing too remarkable. Odd smells. Herbal and medecinal, giving way to green olives and pimentos. Taste has little of the herbal smells, but still has some hints of the olive juice. There is a nice balancing hop bitterness, but nothing too strong. Mouthfeel has a nice, almost prickly carbonation. Alcohol is not noticeable. Drinkability is pretty good. I would imagine this would be terrific with a nice bruscetta and thick cut mozzerella. I'll buy this one again."
"D - This is a very good beer. Count this one among your favorite session beers."
"Drinkability: This is a fairly unique brew, but I don't think I'll be buying more anytime soon."
"This beer pours a very hazy red with a moderate amount of carbonation that settles to ring of bubbles. Smells like the inside of a Japanese restaurant. Tastes fruity with an odd aftertaste that reminds of the flavor of some Japanese red rice that I had that actually was flavored with red beans. This is a very unique beer that definitely could complement certain Asian cuisine. I think this could be good with a barbecued pork bun, for example. The red bean flavor takes a bit of getting used to as a flavor in beer and I'm not sure I like it, so the drinkability score suffers somewhat."
"D - Very good beer. Much better than their white ale."
"Appearance was a fairly deep red, with a medium amount of head which dissipated quickly. Aroma was lightly fruity with some malt backbone to it. Taste was somewhat cedar-ish, with a lot rye flavors. Mouthfeel was grainy or chalky in its character, which I didn't particular care for. All-in-all, I enjoyed this beer, but didn't have an extraordinarily high opinion of it."
"I've seen these around the are and finally decided to plunk down a few bucks for this. Pours a deep red/orange color quite different from your average ale. Has an odd grainy sweet smell, not too overwhelming. Tastes a bit like raw slightly musty grains(rice?) some sweetness in the background which finishes sweet. Overall, it's different but really exciting or overly appealing. Worth a shot for people who like to try something different, but I can't see myself going back to this one."
"Drinkability- After warming to near room temperature, I could almost manage to suck the remainder of this down. This beer reminds me of a liquid sushi... too bad I don't like sushi. I'm sure that some people will like it, but it's just not for me. This would probably pair really well with lots of Japanese foods including sasimi... that is, if you like sasimi. All-in-all, an extremely interesting beer, but one that I obviously won't be buying again."
"Cheers!"
"D: Great beer, I enjoyed mine with sushi and it fit nicely."
"330ml brown bottle from Joka's in Waterville. Murky red-amber body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells like cooked rice. Tastes sweet and grainy, similar to wild rice. Flavor has hints of almost a roasty quality to it. Not detecting any alcohol, which surprises me. Rather full-bodied. I'm surprised how much I like this one. Not something I'd have everyday, but I'm very glad to have tried this one. May get again sometime - perhaps to pair with some sushi."
"I like this beer, but not nearly as much as the brewery's wit. I'm feeling the alcohol after a half glass, which went down quickly enough. All in all a worth-a-try brew."
"the good parts of this beer is the appearance, which is a beautiful color and nice presentation, and it's drinkability."
"I'm glad I engaged in a little experiment in trying two of Kiuchi's beers; I won't be experimenting this way again on my own nickel. I was ready to drainpour it, but Ms. Warmstorage likes it enough to drink it. Just goes to show how subjective taste is..."
"Drinkability/note: A most excellent and enigmatic example, as befits a Belgian ale style brewed in Japan. Well worth the effort to obtain. Many thanks to BA HardTarget for generously sharing this rare example."
"It smells like beer but has a menthol coughdrop-like kind of taste about it. This isn't really a problem though since much of it is a peppering of honey and ginger type lightness(probably the rice). Then again it isn't overly flavorful and flavor accounts for most of the reasons a non-drunk imbibes in spirits. Yet it's very drinkable, smooth and includes an owl on the bottle and afterall we are all servants of Moloch in this life and next aren't we?"
"A very strange and distinct brew, which I frequent at four dollars for a 12oz bottle when I am feeling sassy. Only qualm is a little rough medicine quality. WeirdGood"
"Overall, OK. My second beer from Hitachino, and I haven't been that impressed. Might go well with sushi, though, given it's champagne like qualities."
"Drinkability: A unique, if slightly unsettling beer experience. It's medicinal, lactic qualities aren't too endearing to me, either. I'll stick to their Celebration Ale instead."
"This is a very unusual brew and I am enjoying it's uniqueness without really being able to tell if I like it. I definately can't rate this to style as the style is supposedly a Belgium Strong Ale and I see, smell, nor taste anything even close to Belgium in this glass."
"Drinkability: definitely unique but enjoyable. Worth trying this one."
"I got this at hyvee not knowing what to expect seeing as how real beer is a luxury in japan. It has a delicious fruity smell full of spices like nutmeg and ginger. It also has a buttery feel in the nose. A very complex appealing smell. The taste is kind of like brown rice, sadly I've never actually eaten brown rice so I wouldn't know if it's similar. It tastes sweet and well rounded. I can't detect any hops whatsoever. What are they using for a bittering agent? Could it be that the rice can provide both silky sweetness and enough bitterness that hops are rendered unnecessary? I must investigate. The appearance is like rust. That's the best I can do on that front. I don't really care about that anyway. As for drinkability and mouthfeel... It slides easily down the throat and I could drink it for a long time. It's just a little expensive. Maybe when I go to Japan."
"Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twenty one ounce bottle. Aroma is a little sweet, alcohol is noticeable too. Taste is fairly complex, with some odd notes. The malt is quite noticeable, and there is some sweetness, but not a lot. A bit of tartness is present too. This beer is fairly hard to describe. It has a light body, and there is some alcohol warming. The aftertaste becomes medicinaI as the beer warms. I don't think I would buy it again, but it was worth trying."
"Mouthfeel was quite thin and over carbonated and did not settle. The beer seemed to turn to instant foam when it hit my tongue."
"This beer would really be an interesting pair with food. Maybe seafood or even a dessert that has fruit in it."
"[Arigato gozaimasu to Yoshiyuko Sato for this gift]"
"Very drinkable. For me, that waxy rich taste keeps leading me down this road. Very balanced and even though fairly high abv, no discernable alcohol."
"Hazy pinkish colored, respectable white head. Smells a bit spicy and definitely of sake. Distinictly tastes of fermented rice (ie sake) with a supporting malt sweetness and noble hops. Really interesting and quite complex. Yeast dominates the flavor profile. A bit spicy, and creamy through the finish. Subdued fruit esters. On the dry side, with bitterness just to balance. Light bodied and satisfying, I love it."
"D: Interesting brew. Not one of my favorites but I'm glad I had an opportunity to try it."
"The mouth is rather dry and somewhat tart to prickly due to the abundance of carbonation. It really works for this beer. Solid drinkability if only for its unique yet pleasing character."
"Cheers!"
"I think this bottle is bad. I can't believe that anyone would purposely make a beer that has an aftertaste like this and smells like this. The actual taste is fine but getting to it and afterwards makes it hard to like this. Will try again, in a small bottle, but it'll be awhile."
"Drinkabiliy: A decent brew, very unique. A strange sweet quality that I have not tasted. Perhaps good at breakfast with cereals. Hard to judge as a pale ale."
"Drinkability: Why the description of this persists as a BSPA after so many comments to the contrary is a mystery; this beer defies categorization but is definitely worthy of consideration; I like it!"
"Don't know if I could drink more than one of these and I don't know if it's something i'd reach for more than once in a blue moon, but a must try experience for any beer drinker."
"Overall Impression: Infected. I Dumped it. This beer obviously came a long way as it's a product of Japan. But this has no effect on this type of infection. The brewery should really watch their sanitation process. I'm really curious what the beer would taste like if it wasn't infected. I will give this beer another try."
"Pours a hazy orange-reddish hues with a one finger cap this dissipated two a 1/4 inch cap. Aroma is slightly sour cherry soda (not like a lambic, just faint), spice of cloves, red table wine, wheaty, little citrus and belgian funk. Flavor is a sour wheat with cherry mixed in. Spiciness from clove and coriander. has an old farmhouse ale feel to it...Almost like a old aged ale. Lemony citrus with a odd aftertaste. Medium-high carbonation, with medium body, and finishes dry. Not quit sure about all the flavors yet... maybe another will help out...!"
"Hand carried back from KC, MO."
"I do have to say the alcohol isnt as present as I thought it would be, but this still doesn't make it very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is just fantastic! The beer has a funky yeasty sort of kick. The beer has a light body. This beer is very thrist quenching. This is a very nicely balanced beer."
"This is a special brew...not at all what I expected from a Japaneese brewery. Would describe better as a Flander's Red, this beer starts off with a very tart, sour, berry-like aroma and flavor. Decorated with tart cherry, raspberry, and cider-ey notes, the beer delivers a full flavor throughout. Beginning with a dense eggshell head that remained creamy, the full flavor shows strong wine-like qualities, and low lying sweet malts. The color is a hazy cherry or berry red color. The body falls a bit weak from the souring. Musky and earthy with yeasty and almost moldy, the beer stays crisp and clean. Approaching astringent levels, it is very good and thirst quinching. Perhaps a bit grainy in the finish and lightly hoppy. it could have a better sweet malt flavor and a heftier body, but nevertheless, this is a really good beer."
"Da: Low. Not really sure if this is how this ale is supposed to be(?). I'm also having a hard time placing it with Belgian Strong Pale Ales.. Let me know if you have the scoop on this one."
"Overall is is one of the more interesting beers i've tried. i like the adventuresome, but this one is not for me"
"Drinkability: No wonder I'm a Japanophile."
"Overall: This beer reminded me a lot of a toned down Flanders Red Ale. It was interesting, and fairly enjoyable. This was a really hard beer to pin down. I wavered a bit on the scores, but in the end I think the overall score comes out about right."
"A great and unique beer to keep around!"
"~R"
"I thought it was a solid offering."
"Working through it, all I wanted was a Flanders Red. I'm glad I gave it a try - it's definitely interesting. I think I'll stick to the Nests for repeat visits."
"This is one of those beers that isn't very tasty but gets some points for being weird and interesting. This beer is a very interesting color -- kind of a red-gold that's been tinged pink. The head is a pink-tinged white. It reminds me a bit of a cherry lambic in appearance. The nose is pretty unappetizing -- it smells of sour rice and some Asian fruit that is obscure to my American palate, but that I've smelled before (at the World of Coke exhibit in Atlanta, believe it or not). The taste brings some complexity, but also lots of sourish red rice that's a bit overpowering. The mouthfeel is pretty good, actually -- the carbonation is nicely balanced and the finish is good. But overall, this brew reminds me of some of those challenging lambics and sour red Belgian ales -- I can appreciate them, but I wouldn't necessarily choose to drink them unless they were very carefully paired with a particular food."
"Clear with a woody amber gold color. There is no lace but it still has that nice floral Belgian smell. The taste is smoother than before but it doesnt stand out like it did. A nice beer nonetheless. I am glad I tried it again as the last sample(which I did not review) left me not too enamored with this beer. It is a good 'un. Beware of some inconsistency though."
"I'll not be getting this again."
"I'd easily get this again."
"A heavy pour and got a two-fingered head that faded quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Hazy golden color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Nose is barely there maybe vanilla?? Starts with a typical malt/hop mix but then the finish there is an incredible kick of sweet vanilla nothing like I have had before and quite different from other Japanese beers. $3.89 for a 11.2oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Went nicely with the vegetarian (tempeh) reuben and asian slaw."
"Drinkability: You're kidding, right? Seriously, is this even beer? I was hoping this was skunked, but I see others have felt my pain. God, this can't possibily be the flavor they were shooting for, can it? If you'd like to pay $4 to drink 11.2 ounces of Orval with a mouthful of cocktail olives, you've arrived. Oh, the horror, the horror..."
"This was wonderfully drinkable beer and a style that people do not generally associate with Japanese brewers. Makes me want to have another."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a reddish hue along with a 1"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, malty scent that is dry and slightly musty. I guess this brew is made with red rice. I'm really not sure how to detect rice aroma. It smells of alcohol and yeast. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry flavor that resembles cough syrup. It's smooth with a slightly sweet finish that's warm on the way down. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an interesting beer. It has a unique flavor; a good flavor."
"Could go well with Japanese cuisine and possibly mediteranean. Could take a little getting used to."
"I would love to attend a talk on the cultural importance of this brew."
"Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale doesn't impress me. I love Kiuchi's White Ale. Sweet Stout (Lacto) and this one leave a lot to be desired. According to my three minutes of Google research, red rice lowers cholesterol, so at least I can take something positive away from this experience. At $3.49 per 12 oz. bottle, however, Lipitor is considerably more cost effective."
"Can't really say how this stacks up against anything else since this is the only one I have had of this kind. Seems a bit of a novelty beer but could be a good match with sushi or for someone who really enjoys sake. It does kind of grow on you and by the end of the bottle I was thoroughly enjoying this. Very drinkable with a unique flavor. Still a bit too expensive to be included in my normal stable of beers."
"D- This beer is very soft and mild. I didn't pick up the fruity notes as strong as I would expect in this style. For 8 1/2 % ABV this is a very smooth and drinkable beer. It would be nice to see a bit more complexity."
"For some reason, this beer just reminds me of oriental food. Appropriate, considering it's from Japan. Poured out to a slighly cloudy amber golden color with a nice head and some lace around the glass. Smell reminded me of sweet rice, almost rice pudding. Flavor was bland, slightly sour and dry. Some maltiness noted, but it was kind of like spoiled milk. Finished watery, and slightly grainy. A unique experience, but not one I would want to have again anytime soon."
"A very drinkable brew, and I will definitely order one sometime with my sushi."
"This beer was very different from anything that I have had before and, therefore, tough to rate. It went down quickly, but I'm not sure if that was because it was highly drinkable, or that it had my curiousity so highly piqued. It's not bad at all, though I think it would take a few before it would really start to grow on me. I'm confused."
"This was an unpleasant and somewhat pricey experience. Pours a dark cloudy orange with lots of sediment floating around. Average white-ish head that held all the way down. The smell was horrid and I have nothing I can compare it too. Perhaps a waxy wet leaf or something but something really weird. It was about as bland as you can be without being offensively bland and it was thin. The acidity was noticed and it was a dry-ish clean finish. I guess it's drinkable but it's not really likable. That smell was horrid though and I'm wondering what those floaters were I swallowed."
"Color is a pink tinted amber with a moderate amount of haze. Head is ultra white and a little below average in size, but fortunately has a nice retention for the short layer of foam. Aroma is sweet, almost sugary sweet, with just a touch of spice. Taste is interesting and for some reason reminds me a little bit of New Belgium's Biere De Mars. A moderate tartness begins a sip and is joined by a light sweetness. The sweetness has a fruity quality. but of exactly what fruit I do not know. The interplay between the tart and sweet elements is interesting. Tartness seems to diminate at first, however after the brew warms up more sweet character is apparent. Just a bit of spice is noted towards the middle of the sip. Finish is milder and has an interesting grainy, yet wine-like quality which I guess is the rice. Red Rice is definently an interesting concoction, but not something I think I'd want very often. Though this is usually expensive, it is well worth a try."
"I don't know what to make of the smell. Not bad, but I didn't know what iwas expecting. there was very little flavor at first, sweet but not annoyingly so. A cherry type flavor dominates. Good carbonation, decent aftertaste, this isn't bud rice beer. But it is still rice beer. While the flavor grew on me by the end, I don't think I could have had too many more."
"Drinkability- I guess if you like beer that tastes like martini's this is your style. I read lots of reviews that said it tasted like saki at first taste. I have never had saki, so I can't judge on that point. But, I did read at least one person who had the same exact smell and taste experience that I did. This is 100% not my style and I apologize if this brings down the average. The only positive things I have to say about this beer is that it doesn't look that bad in a glass and at the very least it's way better than Crazy Ed's Chili Beer. Which truthfully means you can eat human excrement and it would still be better than Crazy Ed's. So, I guess that's not saying much at all. I'll remember this beer for a long time, but I'll try my best not to hold it against Hitachino because I have had a few of their beers that have been just fine if not actually dare I say....good!"
"This offering pours a hazy pale auburnish color with a nice fluffy, creamy egg white head. The head holds up well. Lots of carbonation going on. Aroma is really fruity and has a 7-grain bread note going on. There's also some acidity in there and a little alcohol punch. Might be some floral bitterness as well. The body on this beer is really smooth and creamy. Almost too creamy as the flavors takes a backseat, like it came from a nitrocan or something. Starts out sweet with rice notes and some grainy malts. Then it really dries out with yeasty flavors. A vinegar like flavor is there. Finish is really dry, honestly reminiscent of sake. I could see how some people love this beer but its just not my thang. Props for originality though."
"In the end, Im non-committal. If I want a sour beer, Ill look to Belgium. One small item of note though: the bottle is considerably heavier than most American 12 oz. bottles."
"Notes: I don't know exactly what type of beer this is, but its definitely not a belgian strong pale ale. It was an odd beer, definitely drinkable."
"This is a beer a local micro carrying bar just got in. I've seen the bottles of it in a local beer retailer before but never thought much of it. Poured into a tulip glass it has a very clouded honey color to it. It poured with almost no head and slightly swirled left no lacing. The thought on my first taste was ""interesting, this beer has a very unique flavor to it"". Then after a while the flavors started coming through. It has a unique underlying strawberry tone to it. The taste is almost bitter but it leaves a fruity pleasant finish. I would say it's an okay and interesting to try brew, but I don't know if I would rush out to get more. Though I would gladly accept one if offered one for free somewhere!!!"
"The body was light and dry. I dont think i'll be drinking more of this... not because it's bad but rather I dont think this is my style... (I do love their anniversary ale)."
"The first question that comes to my mind is where is this beer when I go out to Japanese restaurants for sushi? I would love to order this over the typical macro Japanese adjunct beer options. This is an interesting beer. I like it."
"Well, this was another unique offering from Hitachino. This one is going to be an acquired taste, but at the high price I probably won't bother. I like their Classic Ale, aged in cedar, much better. Try this one if you want some sake and rice in your beer."
"A different brew for sure, and a bit score-defiant of that reason, but it's one that I'd get again on occasion."
"24.3 ounce silk screened bottle. Opened this one because I thought it would be light. Had no idea it contained such a high alcohol level and that it would be sour and then it would transform into something completely different. My first taste said to pour it out, later I found myself strangely drawn to the bottle..."
"The beer disembarks the brown 330ml bottle a murky reddish-brown with a minimal frothy off white head that depletes quickly leaving a blotchy coating of lace. Nose is sweet, plum like, fresh and clean with the start sweet and the grain profile moderate as is the feel at the top. Finish is pleasantly acidic and the hops forthright in their spicy presence, quite dry aftertaste that covers the palate, also appears to be some alcohol bitterness at the back, a drinkable beer and a change of pace from the normal malt laden beers, a new beer and brewery to me."
"It's very rare to find this on draft in Southern Indiana (thank you Roger), but if it comes around again, I will order it again"
"Pours a hazy, pale, funky color that there is no name for: yellow + pink=?? Airy, white head dissapears quickly, minimal lace. Funky aromas of belgian yeasts, lemony citrus, wheat-malt, and slightly sour apple. Tastes...odd to say the least. It's like a wheat beer trying to go Belgian. Fruity, soft and effervescant with crisp flavors of apple, pear and apricot. Light mouthfeel, dry finish. Does not taste like an 8.5% beer at all. I really don't know what to think, there's not another beer on the planet that this reminds me of. Worth trying for the sheer weirdness of it."
"A cloudy darkish yellow beer. Has an off white head that dissapears quickly. There is a very nice fruity sweet character along with an inviting spiceyness in the aroma. The flavor is sour, dry and reminds me of fruit going bad. None of the Belgian spiceyness promised in the aroma. More like a gueze than a strong ale."
"Came in a 25oz bottle. Pours a dark orange color with a white head. Aroma has a grainy character backed by some floral hops. The flavor is slightly sweet and leaves a bit of citrus bitterness on the palate. Medium drinkability and medium body. This was an ok beer. Nothing too wonderful, but good."
"Surprisingly this pours with a pink tinged head that is frothy for a bit but then settles down with time. The beer has a hazy light amber color. The aroma is quite grainy, with some qualities that I can't quite pick out. It is also a little bit fruity in the nose, with perhaps a hint of cherry. Hmm, very interesting taste, the finish is quite unique, and I don't know how to describe it, almost has a menthol character to it, maybe a bit like wet grain. The beer is light, with a solid grain character to it. According to the label all of the color has come from the rice, which makes sense as I don't taste any crystal malt notes that would usually accompany a beer of this color. I definitely like this beer, it is quite interesting. I definitely recommend trying it as it has some unique character to it."
"Managed to sample this while I was in Vegas. Came in a big-assed 24.3 oz. dark green bottle. Poured out a clear amber colour, small tight foamy white head. It had a very musty odor to my nose, that was predominantly what I could pick up. A sweet acidic flavour, almost sake-like due to the grains used to brew it, I couldn't pick up any real nuances beyond that. The flavour tends to turn a little astringent after a while. Somewhat soapy mouthfeel. An interesting experiment, but just not my bag, baby. The boys working the counter at Lee's Discount the night I picked this up were right, I should have grabbed more Stone instead."
"Nice white head sticks to the glass but doesnt produce much lacing. Body is orange to golden with a lot of sediments. Original fruity aroma: Yeasty pears, apples, cherries, grapes... rather sweet, but well made. Yeasty bread, filling. Dry and grainy. Slight sour spades. Very unique and tasty of course, but not quite as demarcative as I hoped. Nice foamy mouthfeel, highly carbonated. Musty finish where I was thinking ""Hmm, they could have hidden that 5% ABV a tad better"". Then I noticed its 8.5%. Good job!"
"All in all, I would happily buy this beer again, It’s as good inside as it is outside the bottle."
"Comments  The style classification has to be wrong. This isnt anything close to a BSPA."
"24.3 ounce bottle pours cloudy bright reddish-orange color with a huge frothy head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Tropical fruity aroma, sweet fruity flavors. Medium to full bodied with a soft mildly carbonated mouthfeel. Finishes a bit sour and dry, alcohol very well hidden, its hard to believe this is 8.5%."
"This ale pours a weird orange brown color. The aroma is sweet with light malt accents. The flavor is absoultly mind boggling. In Nevada there is a native plant called Indian Tea or Mormon Tea which is an Ephedra relative. I have drank this tea many times and Red Rice has a flavor very much like the Indian Tea in that it has a creamy medicinal quality. Reminds me of Sake this ale has a flavor that is strange and enticing at the same time. The finish has a medicinal graininess to it that i can only equate to Red Rice. An excellent ale to experience as it showcases the prowress of Japanese brewers."
"Hitachino Nest's Red Rice Ale is certainly one of the most unique beers available. It pours a hazy deep gold body that streams with effervescent carbonation beneath a 3/4"" cap of fluffy, bright-white foam. The head retention is very good and it leaves some nice spots and thins splashes of transient lace throughout the glass. The nose is quite unusual with an aroma that expresses wheat, but is also similar to that of a dry white wine combined with a touch of play-doh. It's light-medium bodied with a very delicate, effervescent carbonation that lends a mild zest to the tongue before it warms in the mouth becoming airy and slightly creamy. There's an odd, almost medicinal, lightly tart, and slightly candyish note in the flavor that's quite unique. It's kind of like delicate spice wrapped in soft, creamy candy - all tied together with a twine of dried flowers. It finishes with its sweetness rapidly fading as its tartness and bitterness rise; and a mild bitterness, spicy hop, light phenolic, and some astringency linger in the mouth. As odd as it is, it's also quite delicate; and in that way it becomes quite enticing. There are some harsh notes to it; but there are also harsh notes in the best Belgian gueuze. They're what gives it it's character, and this beer is nowhere near as intense as a gueuze. You may not love it, but it's certainly worth trying. I find it intriguing, and perhaps, one of the most interesting beers in the world. My highest praise to Mr. Toshiyuki Kiuchi!"
"Overall: I am not one for style infractions, having stoned the style police van when it drives anywhere near me, but I have to say that the Belgium Strong Pale Ale description may be a tad misleading to those who have not tried this before. Think more of light Pale Ale with hints of citric acidity and zesty red berry fruits mixed with some Saki soaked Malts. Whatever you want to refer to is as, its my third brew now from Kiuchi, and this is just as damn tasty and impressive as the other two. Expensive but Recommended."
"This one takes some getting used to. It is kind of an odd looking and tasting beer. It pours a light, amber with some evident reddish hues. It had a short-lasting head and only minor lacing. The aroma is primarily ricey with some spices underneath. The taste is very complex. It is sweetish throughout with some vanilla and coriander tastes near the end. It is sweet than a sweet malt. The beer is effervescent, cleansing, and light. The beer is a on the sweet side to drink more than one, but it was a very interesting tasting."
"I am glad I tried it, but once was enough for me."
"worth trying. a nice beer to pair with a sweet and sour dish."
"Still not great, but quite an interesting approach, smooth, yet still spicy and lively, but very drinkable. Quite a quencher, with a kick."
"Taste was oddly sweet, and slick to start, syrupy almost. Hints of fruits, strawberries, raspberries, and lots of alcohol taste. Has a certain crispness toward the finish, that attribute to the rice. No it doesn't taste like a budweiser, but not what I expected either. Seems to me more sweet than anything. Almost one the way to being a tripel ? Medium to light bodied, noticable alcohol kick and flavors. Not a guzzler to be sure, but an interesting beer, probably won't go searching it out again for a while."
"Truly unlike any other beer I've ever had. I applaud the brewers for their inventiveness..."
"Pours a light orange color with a light head that leaves some light lacing,aroma is of grain alcohol and some green apple.I have had saki only a few times but I pick up a big saki flavor to this brew in the finish along with a light smokiness and like a few others a light olive juice flavor as well.A real odd and perplexing beer but it kinda grown on ya after a few drinks,glad I gave it a try."

"Good drinkability, very clean. Not hugely complicated, but nothing I could pick out as being wrong, nice to see rice used for once in a good way. It's here to improve the beer and make it unique."
"This was an interesting brew. The beer pours a cloudy deep orange with a pinkish hue in the foam. The combination of prune juice and seltzer water came to mind. The foam quickly dissipates. The aroma definitely has a rice or bean aroma. The mouthfeel was a bit thin with effervescent carbonation. Rice flavor with just a bit of fruity sweetness plus some sour notes that finished with a slight alcohol aftertaste. I have enjoyed some other offerings from this brewery but I dont believe I will be trying this one again anytime soon."
"Drinkability is hard to decide it is different. It is a must drink just because of how different this stuff is."
"Big tamarind character on this one maybe with some saffron. Unique and very evident of wild rice, but off-putting and offensive on its own. As one who loves sake, I can see where Hitachino is coming from with this and I think they've made something remarkably complex. Paired with sushi or any peanuty thai dish, this could be very special."
"Not a good beer. I have no problem with a tart beer, even a sour beer, when that is appropriate, but here my impression was a wheat beer with a good measure of green olive juice tossed in. The beer had an odd, acidic backdrop to the flavor that reminded me of something cured in brine. I like a ""dirty"" martini with a bit of olive juice, but the flavor turning up in beer was not pleasant. I thought perhaps it would grow on me, and I gave the beer every chance, but in the end it was a sink dump. Perhaps this is one of those love-it-or-hate-it beers. I fall in the latter category."
"This is one odd and very unique drink-in a deliciously good way. As the finish from my last sip lingers on and on an on, I have to ruminate rather deeply about what to say here. The color is much that of a framboise-hazy blonde ale color, yet with a raspberry tinge. The head is sushi rice color and sticks to the glass rather well. The aromatics are lovely, clean and fresh with the delicate fruitines one finds in fine sake. The rice gives off an almost tapioca like odor with some vanilla, melon, faint strawberry and definate sake flavors. The alcohol is at once warming, yet the beer is wonderfully refreshing at the same time. Again, like the white ale this beer screams out for food, and I'm talking Japanese food. The beer actually reminds me of the flavors redolent of sushi. I can taste clean rice flavors and even a meaty/fishy flavor, almost tuna like. This is really fun to drink and I'm now planning my meal to accompany this fine beverage. Bravo!!"
"Medium gold color, medium head. Aroma is malty and yeasty, kind of champagne like. It's a cross between a pilsner and sake. Somewhat sweet, somewhat sour. There is a subtle hoppyness that builds on the palate. Light a refreshing. Carbonation is also champagne like, lots of small quickly disappearing bubbles. Interesting beer. Has a definite rice-like taste to it, but in a good way, not at all like Bud etc. Interesting beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Hides the 7 % alcohol well. I like it when brewers take chances with their beers. Very different and worth trying."
"Another unusual offering from Kiuchi. Honey/Amber colored with a fast dissipating off-white head. The aroma is mildly reminiscent of cooked rice and white bread. The body is light and clean tasting. A mild hop taste mingles with a slight astringent fuminess. A seltzery effervescence remains throughout the glass. How do they do it? The 8.5% ABV is not noticeable in the flavor or aroma."
"This beer poured a cloudy gold color and formed a bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of citrus and some floral aspects. A flavor of citrus, rice and some grain elements. The finish was sprite and somewhat sudsy. I really can place this beer style wise, so it is difficult to form a good feel/opinion for this beer."
"This ale poured a hazy, light straw color, with tall, fluffy, persistent foam that clung to the sides of the glass. The smell was initially reminscent of sake with hints of lactic acid and malt sweetness and a bit of hops and some grapes. The initial flavor was very tart, almost sour, but after a few drinks I became accustomed to it, and it reminded me of a sour lambic, in that regard. Over flavors detected: a vinous taste, slightly musty, floral hops, malt. The mouthfeel was initially tart with a good bit of hops in the finish. The body was medium-light with modest carbonation feel. Surprisingly, I would have never guessed that this ale was 8.5% abv. This ale was quite drinkable and really grew on me as I sipped it. An interesting and unusual ale from Japan."
"Overall a nice change of pace ale. Intriguing little beer that packs lots of flavors and just a wee bit of alcohol (8.5%). Not an everyday brew for me but one I would buy again just for its difference."
"Transparent peach color with extremely active head, surprised at the lacing despite the soda like carbonation. There is very little aroma. The flavor is neither hoppy, malty, nor ricey. I do not get the hype. I do not think this is more than a gimmicky Budweiser (Bud use a lot of rice). Has an odd body odor flavor. Highly carbonated. Lame. I would not bother trying this again."
"F"
"The second time around it had a bitter/sour finish on the tongue and palate. It poured a deep orange yellow with no difference in the foam as the first time. I have down graded this beer by one point, all around."
"What a funky little brew! Hazy golden/beige with a fluffy white head. As others have noted, the carbonation ensures that a nice, sticky lace stays around for the duration. What an odd aroma -- wild rice, a touch of tart fruitiness (strawberry, kiwi), more rice enveloping the aroma. Also something else in there -- green olives? -- which is strange and yet intriguing. Everything about the taste is subtle, yet also intriguing. First, there's a mild malt undertone that holds up the brew, with starchy, wild-rice flavors, creamy. Some medicinal flavors, intoxicating. Alcohol seems hardly there (which is Ninja-dangerous), except for the slight peppery finish, where I also noticed the closest resemblance to sake. This would have been perfect with my dinner tonight -- take-out from the local Japanese steakhouse. And oh yeah, the owl is very cool."
"Retasted 10-23. No change in scores. It's like a cross between a hefeweizen and a sparkling Vouvray or Prosecco."
"This is one of those off the wall yet extremely interesting brews. Not something I’d buy all the time but for more of a treat or a conversational brew. Paired well with my tuna sushi roll."
"Note: be respectful of this beer. It'll kick your ass with its unique type of alcohol and its content."
