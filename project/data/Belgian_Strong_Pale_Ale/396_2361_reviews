"lot of light lemony and peppery notes, little alcohol thru the nose, really clean"

"Delicious golden Belgian tripel. Mildly lemony on the finish but not citrusy either."

"This is really so much better than many beers in this style from Belgium. Really authentic-feeling, really tasty. Really cool."

"Another brilliant beer from AleSmith, the quality really shows through with this one and it is remarkably easy to drink despite the fact it comes in at 11% abv. and is packed with flavour. It's more fruity than I was expecting but the balance is great and the carbonation is perfect, helping the beer down far too easily for the strength of the beer. Simply put, this one is a must try for any beer fan and one that was well worth the very expensive price tag - definitely a beer that has aged well since I picked it up a couple of years ago."

"The bottle suggests this be served between 50 and 55F and it is spot on. Too cold and it was just too clovey but as it warmed the sweetness came out. The banana was nice and it has a bit of bubblegum but the yeasty fungus earth tones are not my favorite."

"Overall:  I like this beer a lot.   Got better with time and warming up to room temperature too.  I will revisit this one again sometime in the future."

"This is a big flavorful beer. It's a Belgian all the way through. Banana is the biggest taste I get. It's lovely all the way, along with small orange notes. This Belgian Strong Pale Ale has a nice refreshing , and sweet fruit quality."

"AleSmith has nailed the Belgian Strong Pale Ale texture achieving a very rich, creamy texture, a medium light to medium body that belies the level of alcohol, depth of yeast flavors and complex malt action in the beer. The carbonation is fine and soft and above average. It has an underlying sweetness balanced by the alcohol and light hop touch. In no way is it cloying."
"(4.05) O: Overall a great belgian pale, spicy, dry hop and alcohol glow with a very delicate and balanced sense of hops and spiciness."
". Poured a hazy golden with almost no head. Was way to sweet for my taste in this style. My girlfriend who loves moscato and other sweet wines loved this."

"It pours a clear golden color. Thereâ€™s a light aroma with a bit of an estery aroma to it. I found it sweetly flavored with an orange blossom characteristic shining through. I had enjoyed it thoroughly, felt it afterwards!"

"O - A decent try at a Belgian Pale but does not beat the real thing"
""
""
""
""
"Brew pours a murky orange with a thin bubbly head that bubbles away quick. Nose is fairly fruity with big coriander notes and Belgian candied yeast. Not a classic BSPA, but not a huge departure...just a bit heavy on the sweet for the nose. As for the flavor, the sweetness comes through, but e fruitiness is more present and balances things out...although this definitively falls on the sweeter side of the spectrum for the style. Some bubble gum notes and phenolic booze on the finish. Drinks fairly nice and even without a lot of carbonation. Overall, not bad at all. A bit sweet with heavy handed coriander."

"Rich deep golden color with fantastic clarity. A quarter inch thick white head rests on top with a bit of Brussels lacing. Fantastic aroma of coriander, pears, pale malt, and Belgian Strong Ale yeast greets my nose. The mouth is moderately carbonated and fairly dry. I get pale malt and Belgian Strong Ale yeast on the front of the palate and then an appropriate burst of coriander in the follow through. It's so easy to do overkill on the aroma and flavor of coriander, but they nailed it on this one."

"O - A very solid beer, would love to compare this one to a more recent bottling date."
""
""
""
"Overall, very very good. Nice balance, and while there are hints that this is as boozy as it is, they are well hidden; dangerously drinkable."

"this stuff is super solid, it drinks ultra slick and watch out for that ABV. a damn well rounded beer."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Fast gusher upon opening. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, grape, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, spice, and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, grape, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of yeast, spice, and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. All around great balance and complexity of yeast, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - the best American Belgian style I have had in a long time - I will try to find another bottle"
""

"my bottle says 10% abv, but nevermind that. this has a shockingly pale look for what I am told is really a barleywine. its hazy blonde, with a short frothy white head and a nose of heavy coriander, both fresh and seed, as well as bright Belgian yeast above a wheat malt base accentuated by candy sugar. it tastes almost like a tripel, sweet and bright, floral and yeasty, just right. the booze is absurdly well hidden, the carbonation is awesome, and the overall experience of this beer is great. my take away is, ""how the hell can this be so strong!"" it taste so minimalist, but packs a big punch. a subtly complex beer, and a very enjoyable one. more summer than fall, but it ages well, and is drinking lovely at the moment. alesmith really has it all happening right now!"
"Medium to full bodied with plenty of carbonation. The alcohol is very well hidden for an 11 % abv beer. Another outstanding AleSmith beer. UI will need to pick some more of this up when I am in Hudson."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is the best beer I've had from AleSmith. It's a little on the pricey side, but it's well worth the money. If you're into Belgian-style ales, this is something you have to try."
""
""
"Overall, sweet with a lot of spice (coriander, floral, chamomile) and a bit of alcohol."
""
""
"I would do the obvious and make some sort of horny joke, but I just don't feel like it tonight, guys. Sorry. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild white bread, plenty of Belgian yeast, clove, a pinch of black pepper,. and a tiny bit of cracked wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a healthy dose of oaked chardonnay grapes. This bit o'ertakes much of the remainder, killing some of the Belgian-y exuberance, especially due to its clashing with the yeast and the bread. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an airily drying finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. The strong yeast just didn't jive with the strange chardonnay flavor, and there was just too much bread thropughout as well."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Again, the ale is chocked full of understated complexity and finesse. Its balance and layering is easily overlooked, but are the details that give Horny Devil an authentic and genuine character."
"O - While many American brewers struggle to replicate Belgian style beers without coming off as an American counterpart, AleSmith's Horny Devil passes as the real deal, nailing not only the style but the use of a classic, hard-to-master yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid Belgian ale but it lacks a little fruitiness and dryness that would pep it up."
"Overall: A very good take on a Strong Belgian Pale Ale. Very good spice and fruit flavors. Pretty smooth for its size and ABV."
""
"Poured from a 750 into a shaker pint, the beer is a pale, hazy, yellow-gold coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation and a thin, sparse coat of white head. Nose of tart and sweet tropical fruit, including pineapple, mango, and a citrus blend. Spices of coriander, nutmeg, and cinnamon blend nicely with all the fruity characteristics, with hints of Belgian funk and booze highlights. Flavors of booze forward, with a heavy dose of banana sweet and subtle spice blend to follow. Clove and coriander give the beer a touch of balance, and there is an overall warmth that builds as you drink from the ABV. This one's a heavy hitter. The aftertaste is tangy sweet from all the fruit character, with that warmth still kicking around your mouth. Smooth bodied, and kept light by the carbonation. The finish is smooth and clean, with a hint of spice linger. Very good, very heavy beer."
""
""
" Overall:  So much flavor packed in to this beer that all mix into a sublime Belgian golden. Yet it is light and bubbly package holding together a beautiful beer. Amazed it is 10%. No hint at all. Artfully crafted and beautifully done."
""
""
"The flavor is sweet, tangy, and bitter, but spice dominates. It's very drinkable, especially considering the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Big, big sweet BSPA. Heavy on the sweet fruits. Belgian yeast character leaves a little to be desired, this is definitely a very ""american"" style BSPA. Which honestly, I typically prefer. If you're looking for something a little more authentic a Duvel is probably more your speed."
""
""
""
"Overall: About as good as any mediocre Belgian beer that has been aged for far too long. This cannot have been possibly older than 2 years and probably that is already an overestimation. Below run-of-the-mill for a premium price makes this beer seem almost like a bad joke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really nice beer, lots of flavor and really smooth. This bottle might have a little age on it cause the alcohol is really mild and the hops are very light. Has great balance, easy to drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Coriander is interesting without the usual accompanying orange peel. ABV is pretty evident and the malt is so light. Yeast, fruit and alcohol driven. It is pretty smooth despite all that though and the grassy hops lend a deft touch of bitterness. Pretty good, gets better as it warms. Id drink this again fo sho."
""
""

"Overall this is very easy to drink, I can't believe it's 11%! A really great tasting beer."

""

"Taste: Can taste spices on front, buttery malt thoughout, very smooth and balances, hides 10% alcohol very well, very good beer."

""

""
""
"O - somewhat of a disappointment for a big fan of Belgians. Too buttery, doesn't showcase the yeast in the flavor as much as I want. Very boozy and smooth, so it isn't all bad, but I'm not impressed with this beer in the most important category: flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice take on a Belgian style. This is one of the most Belgian tasting beers I have had from a US brewer. It does tend towards the sweet side, but that is a minor complaint. A really nice beer, makes me want to try more from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not my favorite type of brew but I can tell this is very well crafted. 3-4 distinct flavors can be identified at 11% and not tasting boozy? I'm bumping up my overall out of respect. If Belgian strongs are your thing than give this a whirl."
""
""
"First I've had from AleSmith - thanks hon. A great brew. Love the style and this is more than worthy. I would highly recommend this BSPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer, no doubt, but it's hard to imagine ever drinking more than one snifter or tulip glass of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very nice beer, more sweet than most Belgian pales but still has some crisp bitterness to it."
""
""
""
"O-outstanding representation of the style. Well crafted and delicious, can't have too much in one sitting though"
""
"Props to AleSmith!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am impressed the smell was kind of boozy and off-putting but they pulled it off well with the taste. I will keep an eye out for any releases that are affordable like this."
""
"M - Medium body, somewhat creamy. Light carbonation."
"O: This beer seems to be overly carbonated however the bubbly nature makes this beer especially easy to drink considering its strength."
"Beer tasted graet I had cellered it for 4 months after I got it. The criander gives the beer and interesting spice quality that had me coming back for more drinks. The yeast tasted great in this beer. That fruit yeast character mixed with the intense spice was superb."
""
"Pours beautiful clear light golden with small quickly receding head. Bubbles like champagne and they keep coming up from the bottom. Smell of coriander, honey, apples and pears. A little funk. Fruity flavor Very effervescent. Flavors follow the smell exactly, with some extra sweetness. Less dry than I expected from the aroma. Clean finish and light mouthfeel. Very nice. I liked this a lot."
""
"Pours a golden color with a nice 1 finger head that leaves lacing. Haziness to the pour with visible sediment. Smells sweet with cherries and citrus fruits. Some alcohol is left on the nose as well. Taste is very malty with lots of grains. A sweet finish with the coriander. Very smooth and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation. Overall this is great. Very delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color with a thin rim of white bubbles. Aroma of coriander and Belgianness. The first sip takes me back to the first time I had a big Belgian beer and my eyes were forever opened. Coriander, candi sugar, lots of fruity esters and phenols backed up by a creamy, slick mouthfeel and ever so slight touch of hops at the end. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Tasty, well executed example of the style. Goes down remarkably easily for the ABV: I would've guessed like 7%."
""
"Overall, a good BSPA. Not a standout but quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"A good, but demanding one. Hard strong cheese recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: aside from the texture, this beer is a miss in my book; my least favorite by a brewery whose beers I normally love."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good, strong Belgian style pale ale. Overspiced, but pretty solid."
""
"O: not a bad BSPA, but too sweet, thick, and simplistic."
""
"O: gotta love AleSmith's stuff - this one warms nicely - reminded me of a fuzzy, lemony tripel; while it is a good BSPA, it also presents a palette of flavors that set it apart from standards like Duvel or Don de Dieu - definitely worth buying and trying."
"Split a large bottle with a friend over lunch. It poured a slightly hazy straw yellow in the restaurant's (Little Ortino's) Kasteel glasses. The slight alcohol heat was understandable, but the beer was unusually acidic. I was hoping for a super Duvel, was more wine-like with a yeasty, spiced edge. My friend was not a fan. But while the flavor was a bit off the mark, little things like the mouthfeel and carbonation were on, and I wonder a little if the beer was mishandled and poorly stored. Either way, this came off like a Belgian strong pale that's veered off course."

"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a pale, clear orange amber. Nice snow white head leaving lacing. Looks very nice. Fruit, especially citrus and Belgian spicing aroma. Moderate heavy bodied, which is nice considering how pale this is. Complex fruit flavors and coriander with something happening through the taste. Ends with a spicy, peppery finish. Nice carbonation bite. Overall a pleasure to drink. Very nice."

"Overall: They claim 11% abv, and the bros gave it stellar reviews. I can't taste the alcohol, which might be dangerous. I would be lead to believe that not all the wonderful Belgian sugar they used in the recipe got converted over to alcohol... but who knows, perhaps it did. If you're in the mood for a smooth, sweet, strong beer (or want to get your girl tipsy), this is a good beer to try."
""
""
""
"A nice, drinkable Belgian pale, and the huge ABV is hidden remarkably well."
"Update: As I continue through the bottle, I notice more of a white grape flavor. Interesting."
""
""
"O - Overall this is a terrific beer. A nice balance of sweet and spicy flavors and it is very easy to drink."
""
""
"Happy to find this on tap at Ciro's in San Diego."
"O: I've had friends tell me to steer clear of this one, but in my opinion, this was absolutely fantastic and well worth the $20 I spent!"
"D - I have never ever been let down by Alesmith... They continually deliver with each subsequent beer I try and this is no exception... A sipper with lots of character... An assertive and complex Belgian Strong Pale Ale... The nose is world class and all other facets are beyond very good... Highly recommend... Nicely done..."
""
""
""
"Appearance is nice golden color with two fingers of head. This belgian strong pale ale has a nose of coriander, belgian yeast, pear and sugar. Upon sipping, it has a taste of banana, apple, candy, some bitterness. It is a sweet taste, but not too much so, quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is med-full, quite a bit of carbonation to it. Alcohol is hidden to an extent, so keep in mind it is a bit high, even for the style. But, it is a mighty tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, spices, and some slight citrus peel aromas. Taste is the same with the spices lingering on the finish. There is also a slight alcohol kick with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slight crispness and a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer and a good American example of the style."
""
"Almost a champagne like look/aroma/taste to this one, definitely one of the more unique Belgian strong pale ale's I've had. Kinda fruity smell, and surprisingly easy to drink for the high ABV. Doesn't really knock your socks off with taste though, but has a smooth finish and dry aftertaste making it mostly drinkable. Good beer, but wouldn't call it that great or 'amazing' in my opinion, glad I got to try it though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing that gave me a come-back moment. I wanted to try it but didn't have high expectations going into it. I would tell my past self to go for a different beer instead of this one."
""
""
"A-"
""
"The aroma has a fresh and slightly fruity smell that hints at the actual taste. A very easy to drink beer with a smooth finish and a very dry aftertaste. I would be interested in aging this at some point."
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one me at a tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a pale straw yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, clove, spice, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, alcohol, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. This one was all over the place with the aroma and flavor. The alcohol definitely makes itself known throughout the entire brew. Despite this fact it was really well balanced, but the alcohol hurts the drinkability. Worth trying if you see it around."
""
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours clear golden with a massive, rocky white head that slowly recedes to an even layer of lace, leaving a bit of lace residue along the inside of the glass. The nose is super fruity with pear, white grape, candi sugar, and spices, along with some fairly light hay malt, and just a hint of alcoholic heat. The flavor is lightly sweet up front with the candi sugar and, pear and grape juice showing nicely, along with the spices and hay malt just lightly peaking through. The body is medium with lively, mouth-filling carbonation. A pretty good offering from AleSmith for the style."
""
""
"Nose is super complex- by far one of my favorites. There is just so much nuance, unlike anything I've ever had."
" ~ This is a fantastic beer. I don't for a minute regret holding on to it in my cellar for a year. When I purchased the brew I paid $11.99 at a super place in Orange, California called Hollingshead's Delicatessen. I look forward to going back, and when I do, I will pick up another bottle of this fine Belgian from Southern California."
""
""
""
"O - A good beer, but not at all what I was expecting (which was basically a Duvel clone). Very fruity, and pretty unique."
"[87/100]"
""
""
""
""
"O- overall I'm sure it is an excellent beer if this is the kind of thing your into, just not my cup of tea!"
"O - Best Beer I Have Ever Had In My Life! I took one sip at the Alesmith brewery, and I told my fiance, ""this is the best beer I have ever had"". Unbelievable!"

"Medium bodied with sharp, tight carbonation and a prominent coriander spiciness that dominates the flavor, lingering over the grassy, yeast and light fruit notes into a slightly dry, boozy finish. The carbonation and strong spice presence makes this beer a bit harsh and difficult to drink. As it warms and the palate adjusts, the grassy hops, bready yeast and fruit notes become more evident. Hints of apple, pear and candy sugar add sweetness but the spice is too strong for my liking. Finishes with a lot of boozy sweetness and warmth in the chest. ABV not very well masked and a bit one dimensional. A rare miss from AleSmith."

"Overall: A good beer. Lots of good Belgian qualities but nothing I was overly excited about"
"Overall, A great stab at the style, but perhaps a bit too sweet with the onslaught of Candi Suga and the mountain of alcohol in the end. Would probably go great with some pasta dish shared with friends."
"Overall: A complex and enjoyable Belgian Strong Pale."
"Good Belgian style-- I can't help but be heavily reminded of Unibroue."
"Really impressed with this Alesmith offering. A very good American BSPA."
"Pours a hazy straw gold, lots of carbonation with a perpetual 1 finger head. Aroma of orange peel, coriander and juicy pears. Taste follows the nose but is a bit too sweet. Mouthfeel is too carbonated. Not a bad brew just too sweet and too carbonated for my liking. I'm glad I tried it but I won't be seeking this out again"
"Overall I think this did not travel well from California, I am thinking bottle shock but could be wrong. It is really too bad but judging from other appearance reviews of this it looks like something went wrong. Too bad there is a tremendous beer behind this just wanting to escape. I will have to have this sometime again. Luckily even in this state there is very much to enjoy. It looks like this all had to do with the pour somewhat but you never know. A fantastic beer is hiding here."
"O: I don't know why, but this wasn't what I expected in this beer. It was really tasty and extremely easy to drink, but different then any other Belgian Strong Pale Ale I've ever had. Definitely worth trying if you see it and I'll probably pick up more bottles in the future. Very complex drink indeed."
"Finish is so-so, with lots of warming alcohol. Flavors are ok, but not the most complex beer and it definitely shows it's ABV all the way through."
"O: good beer overall but knocked down a bit due to EtOH"
"O - One of my favorite beers. Very refreshing on a warm day, and the varied, yet balanced, flavoring works well."
"This brew poured out as a slightly hazy looking golden yellow color. The head was big and fluffy leaving a nice lacing. The smell of the beer had an interesting soft fruity aroma to it, the smell of Belgian yeast and some wild flowers are in there too. The taste of the beer was floral with a little hop bite to it. The mouthfeel was bubbly and tickled the taste buds. Overall I found this beer to be pretty good overall and it's worth trying if you get a chance."
"O- the strength of this one really crept up on me. its probably too much beer for one person to enjoy due to the strength, but i did it. id buy this again if it were on the shelf around here. one of the better american examples of a classic belgian style that ive had in a long time."
"O- Outstanding. Even though 11%, I could drink this beer all night long. Love it."
"Overall - A very good and well made Belgain pale ale... Probably not worth what i paid for it though.."
"overall i think this is a fantastic beer. flawed, we're not talking world class material here, but really good."
"O: Pretty good, a nice change of pace, but something I probably won't revisit."
"Tastes are wheat, fields, sweat, booze, coriander, grass, lemons, lemonade, yeast, wood, bananas, cloves, mint, ginger and biscuits. Smells like a lot good going on all at once. I've been drinking this since 2009 and so on and so fourth. I'm glad I tried this so early on."
"Drink- A nice gift from the wife for my birthday for something different. I probably wont revisit this one, but was nice to break away from gigantic stouts, IPA's and DIPA's"
"D - Very good. Unique in comparison to most strong ales and complex."
"A slightly hazy yellow goodness drops into the glass. A fine white head sits atop. A pretty little thing. Perfumy with some coriander hints, strong fusel alcohols gettin diesel on it. Needs some time to settle in the bottle. It tastes of its strength, the alcohol kick is huge, a little citrusy, definite esters kicking up a storm, bit of coriander. Yes, this would definitely benefit from a little age, as the flavors are duking it out currently. Lots of flavors going on, but the alcohol burn that accompanies each sip is a bit distracting. Still, it is tasty and I'm excited to try one with a little bit of age on it."
"( 37/50, 11% alc/vol, Home, after a good jam) Small yeast sediment in suspension throughout the glass of golden pale ale. The yellowish head dissipates extremely quickly. But even with this defect, the ale shines through. Some pineapple esters accentuate another slightly alcoholic ale with very evident belgian yeasts. Quite nice fruity aromas mixed in a sort of way that the alcohol is blended very well. Savor the yeast as it starts, then quickly get the grassy hops that escape the otherwise daunting body of alcoholic fruit esters. Pineapple, prunes, lemon marang pie. Tinge of alcoholic burn and an acrid yeast quickly gets the warmth effect and takes on a life of it's own. Weird because it starts off not that good, but as it warms, it begins to harmonize and eventually gets round and playful. It takes a talented brewmaster to deliver 11% alcohol in an attractive way. This one takes the cake in the originality of the delivery. Warmth brings it all together. Great nite sipper. Try it with lemon pie and filet of porc."
"Dark golden ale leaves nice lacing, large foamy white head. Strong coriander aroma. Tutti frutti and sweet candi sugar Belgian scents. Very lively carbonation on the palate. Very heavy coraiander taste. Some cherry fruit, not sweet, however. Interesting, the coriander makes the flavor a tad off-balance."
"(750ml bottle shared with the wife). Pours hazy yellow with white head. Aroma has spice, belgian yeast, and orange. Taste is sweet malt that is perfumey. Light bitterness. Full bodied with thick texture. Average for Alesmith and no match for the best Belgians."
"I believe they may need to tweak the name on this one as I did not find it to be much of an afrodisiac. Huhzubendah did retreat to the rest facility with some questionable reading material while muttering something about going number 3, but this was doing nothing for me. Thorpe and Thorpette (stolen from drabmuh) you may want to power wash your bathroom just to be safe."
"Beer is thin and sweet up front with a dry bitter finish, in-between there is a mild breadiness and a few yeasty esters. I am unimpressed."
"Enjoy."
"Cloudy amber, beautiful full white head and good amount of lace. Tons of carbonation. Subtly honeyed front. Pears and bananas. Coriander shows up in the middle and end but is lighter balanced with a back of the mouth apricot-like acidity. Very mild bitterness to the finish. Light body with lots of carbonation. A fair amount of foaming on each sip. Alcohol is well disguised"
"d - I thought this was a pretty good Belgian style beer, with lots of Belgian sytle yeast and spices, mixing with apples. Would like to have again."
"nice drinkability wish i had bought two 750's tonight"
"The pour yields a bright golden brew with a really nice white head with good retention and a nice bit of lacing. The nose is mildly fruity with some grain and bread. The fruit character is quite prominent in the nose. Some light tropical fruits with a bit of cherry and melon. Light pear and spice as well. The taste follows up on this. Everything is a bit light and not all of the fruity components combine all that well. Feel is crisp with a bit of an alcohol bite. Pretty good, but not something I would seek out again with better Belgian varieties much more widely-available."
"Drinkability: This was a solid offering from Alesmith and a fruitier take on the style."
"Strong Beligian smell...you know that yeast! Robust color-darker yellow. Thin bone-white lacing, small head. Tastes like a Belgian-sweet, strong-but not as strong as some I have tried. This is probably due to the fact that it is a Pale also. Not my favorite, but overall if you like this style of beer, you will probably like it!"
"As another reviewer wrote, you get a fruit loop aroma,yet its not overly sweet. First sip is pineapple lifesavers and then that Belgian yeast. Each sip after brings out more bright fruits. Its as if someone made a fruity sparkling version of Duvel. Its delicious. The bubbles keep on coming making it jump in your mouth. The alchohol is VERY well hidden, watch out. An exceptional take on this style!"
"Overall a great complex Belgian strong ale. This one of the best examples of the style that I have had."
"Drinkability: Really quite a well-crafted beer, as is everything AleSmith seems to do. However, due to the heavier ABV and it's continued presence as I plow my way through the bottle, it becomes tougher to finish. Crack this one with friends on a special occasion, or simply make a special occasion by cracking this one with friends -- either way, the operative notion is to share it with friends."
"Pours a pretty nice healthy amber with a prominent foamy head and thick lacing. This is a very thick beer, the color is rich and unwavering. Smells like a warm piece of buttered toast that has been chilled and liquefied. Taste is very bready, almost like a good San Francisco sourdough but without the crunchy crust and moist buttery inside. Feels decent in the mouth. Not to excited about finishing this giant bottle."
"Price = $13.99 at Whole Foods"
"D - Good looks, good aroma, good taste, great mouthfeel...what is not to like!?"
"poured a golden orange in color with yellow highlights that had a thin head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma definitely had the belgian yeast character alongisde orange citrus, slight coriander, with faint brown suagr and booze notes. The citrus orange was more apparent on the taste but still had the belgian yeast character with coriander, earthy, and brown sugar accents ending with a touch of booze. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, yeasty, slight spice, and fruity finish. It drank real good and has been a soild interpretation of a BSPA everytime I've had it. Another good offering from the peeps at alesmith"
"D - This is really a nice beer. Good looking and great taste/aroma."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Drinkability is good, it had a lot of great flavors to it and some nice complexity. It really integrated the candi sugar and the coriander well. I definitely thought it tasted a lot like some of the sweeter white wines I've had and can easily see any wine drinker liking this beer. Very good beer overall."
"Pours a crisp golden yellow color with a big rocky/fluffy white head. Aromas of coriander, Belgian yeast, pink peppercorns and tart green apples. On the palate, this one is very refreshing, crisp and light bodied. Flavors of honey, Belgian candi sugar, alcohol and apples. A good example of the style, and one I would buy again."
"M/D - Very stick feel with high carbonation. Sweetness is a touch overwhelming but it certainly doesnt ruin the beer."
"Flavor is fantastic! I dont why I expected a bit hoppier of a beer...but this is mellow and delicious. Lots of sweet smelling citrus fruit, orange peel, coriander, wheat, mildly funky. Big carbonation, light crisp mouthfeel. Biggest compliment I can say though is this is a great drinker! Everything about the consistency and flavor makes this beer extremely palitable. Great beer from AleSmith!"
"The beer pours a yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is great. I get a lot of coriander, oranges, white pepper and yeast. The flavor is more of the same with some alcohol (it is quite boozy), Belgian yeast, coriander, wheat and orange juice. This tastes like a Belgian White on steroids, but it is not a coriander bomb like a lot of the Double Whites I have tried in the past. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"M/D: Medium body, but heavy in the carbonation, you could see this once poured into the glass. I liked the forfront of this beer. It was a little to boozy/spicy for me. I would like to try it again though, and really drink it slow. It took me half an hour to sip my half, maybe an hours worth is in order..."
" I would drink it again -"
"Drinkability is high, as every sip makes me want another, but when I do, I am reminded about the heavy duty spice in there."
">750 bottle. My first AleSmith. Pours a hazy golden. Large 3 finger head. Medium to high carbonation, yeasty, coriander is dominant. Some fruit, Alcohol is present, some candided sugar. not a bad beer, I like this one, however I believe I've had better for this style."
"D - Very nice and delicious a well spiced BSPA with a great ABV content (hehe) and crisp and clean carbonation."
"D- The booze is a little strong in this one after a few sips; other than this slightly overwhelming factor, the flavors are solid. Would be very interesting to see how this ages."
"D - This is about as drinkable as you can get for a beer with this abv the alcohol goes completely unnoticed and has a very good taste making this one easy to drink way to quick worth getting to try"
"Nice ""american"" BSPA, also I love the bottle"
"M: A really heavy strike of bitterness and alcohol after a few seconds on the mouth."
"MF and drinkability were excellent, I could have drank this all night...well maybe not all night since it's 11% but this brew hid the 11% well!"
"Pours a clear golden color with a big white head that diminishes quite quickly. Scent is VERY floral and lots of coriander. Belgian yeast scents as well. The taste is very much like it smells, except with a little more hops. Tons of coriander and spices with a lot of flower tastes. There is a bit of alcohol too as the beer warms, but it is hidden EXTREMELY well when cold. I love the mouthfeel, as it seems perfect for this style. I expected it to be way more syrupy. The drinkability is pretty damn high for this being 11%!"
"d-This beer hides its 11%abv very well. Great belgiany flavor and malt sweetness with enough carbonation to keep you coming back for more."
"4.0 D: Good beer that could be a great beer if the bitterness was upped a bit."
"Flavorful and tasty, making for good drinkability, but since I got more from the aroma than the flavor, it feels like the carbonation may be holding back the potentially wonderful flavors here."
"DB- Price not bad depending on where you get it for a big bottle. Definitely something to share with a friend. Better than some of the authentic Belgian ales I have had, worth a shot from a consistently good brewery."
"Glad I split this one. Flavors are good but really intense and strong. $15 is a bit crazy as well."
"jd"
"I paid 13 dollars (well, wife did, for a birthday gift) for a 750 ml bottle. I would say that if you have never tried it before, it's worth the money for a new experience. But as a repeat purchase, I don't think I would spend the money; afterall, 13 bucks for a bottle of beer is very ambitious."
"D - goes down well enough, but i've kill my palate on these beers in the past few years because... they all taste the same!"
"Real good price and pour!"
"Perfumey taste, full bodied for style, coriander and sweet. Great beer, this was the last of the alesmith beers sold commercially I hadn't had, recommended."
"caramel malts and bready, toasted grain flavors in the finish. I enjoyed this one. Don't think I'd want to drink it too often, though. Getting through a bottle by myself was an undertaking."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and luxurious, great carbonation and a mid-body."
"o - fun to try, its a good beer, but not my cup of tea. very easy to drink."
"Frankly this is too sweet to be truly drinkable. I am a bit disappointed to be honest. I was really looking forward to this. Oh well, live and learn."
"Another fantastic AleSmith brew, Horny Devil substantially exceeded my expectations. This is a fascinatingly deep beer, but its so easy to drink that I had to consciously slow down to enjoy it. I'll be seeking this out and looking forward to the next time I'm able to taste it."
"Quite reminiscent of a champagne cocktail."
"D: A good brew to split a few ways. While it was good, it was not among my favorite BSPA."
"Poured into a tulip glass, the beer was a golden color with a thick white head. Aroma of fruit, yeast, and peppery spice. However, the aroma didn't do justice to the taste. Fruit, cotton candy, funky yeast, spice, pepper. Although it's 11% ABV, you wouldn't notice it. Very smooth and lively. Need to have more of these."
"Creamy and luscious body and wonderful layered complex flavors. Pale malts, lead into corainder and tropical fruits with a yeasty belgian spice induced finish that lasts into a tingly carbonation with some hop bitterness. Pineapple, starfruit, mango, and papaya flavors. Some alcohol in the mouth and finish but not bothersome. Very nice."
"Pours a five-finger+ pillowy white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Hazy pale amber color. Some yeast left in bottom of bottle. Nose is light peach. Flavor is almost sour fruit and spicy, complex. High ABV is hidden. Expensive at $14.95 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Drinkability: Decent for the style but not spectacular. It feels like an enhanced version of the style. This one is complex, but not one I am likely to get again."
"D: pretty good, but overall, not my style of beer"
"Notes: This is the 5th consecutive AleSmith beer that I have rated. This one is a very enjoyable Belgian Strong Pale Ale from AleSmith, clearly a great brewery."
"Damn! Appearance is a bit lacking, appears fizzy with smallish head, though a nice straw gold color. Smell is a bit tame, but definitely good, some bready malts, maybe a bit of funk, some citric sweetness, apples. Taste is definitely a punch of citrus, apples, pears, and some clove/yeastiness. Delicious. MF is clean, though a bit thin, the carbonation is fizzy, not fluffy. Superb drink, one that I was lucky to try. Had no idea that this was 11%, maybe would have pinned it as 7%."
"The feel of this beer is light and really drinkable. A small glass will take a while to savor and during that time the true amazing flavors come out."
"This was very drinkable and enjoyable. Great beer!"
"750ml foiled and capped bottle served at 50 degrees in my Bruery tulip. Poured with a voluminous 3.5 inch white head that sizzled and popped as it slowly collapsed in on itself before settling into a solid quarter inch foamy/bubbly cap. Some light, cloud-like strands of lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Liquid was a beautiful translucent honey-gold. Delicate nose - candi sugar, lemonzest and a hint of corriander or orange peel. Taste consisent with nose, but a definite lemony citrus smack hits you upfront and weaves itself into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium and lively with a kiss of alchol heat at the back of the throat. A really great representation of the style with an exquisite balance. One of my favorites for the style to date and probably my favorite domestic example of a Belgian Strong Pale."
"A world class effort from Alesmith!"
"Alesmith is a brewery that has a fantastic roster of beers. I'm yet to encounter a bad one. Horny Devil is an impressive BSPA. Alesmith did a wonderful job featuring Belgian yeast. It's the highlight here and steals the show. A little more strength on the nose would help, in addition to a prominent spicy flavor. It's good, but could be grand. More bubbles would be a good thing, as well. Nonetheless, I'm still impressed with Horny Devil. While I don't believe it has any effect on my prurient nature, it certainly appeases my beer-loving character."
"Drinkability: Nothing jumped out at me about this one. It was good, but I don't think I'll buy it again."
"This is one to keep on hand if you have a cellar. This is delicious, smooth, strong, and surprisingly drinkable."
"Overall/notes: This was a Christmas gift, and a real good one at that! I love Belgian-style beers, and this is one keeps me in line. The second glass was better than the first, probably because it was warmer. Tasty stuff. I hope to meet this beer, once more, in the near future."
"Draught at the Red. Hazy gold with a creamy white head. Sweet aroma. Plenty of fruity notes with banana domination, some spicing, and light tartness. The flavor has that same fruity sweetness, with some orange/banana, and a spicy and alcoholic wrap-up. A lemony, tangy citrus flavor come in a bit later. The sugar lightens the body to a medium clip; much easier to drink than the grand cru, and with very creamy, tight carbonation. For 11%, this is insanely easy to put down. The banana/spice flavors and creamy texture make me think of a belgian pale-strong crossed with a German hef. Definitely the preferred of their big Belgian styled offerings a this point."
"Overall, a strong BSPA that I highly recommend. I really enjoy it as-is but would like to try this with some age on it to see how it develops. Yet another great Alesmith offering. Rotation - not avail in TX so shipped to myself. If here, couple a year which is alot since mostly trying new beers this year. Will get a couple for cellaring."
"D - Pretty good. This is a seasonal so its only around in Oct - Nov. I like it myself as its a good Belgian with solid hop profile as well..."
"This certainly one of the better American interpretations of a Belgian style ale. If you like Belgian beers, this one is worth a try."
"Drinkability good for what this beer is - an 11% ABV spiced Belgian strong ale. Overall another great one from AleSmith. Peter Zien just kills it every time, it's almost ridiculous."
"Poured into a tulip this beer produced a nice orange haze with a 3 finger white head. It smells of citrus and lemon. The taste is pretty complex. At first you get the lemon presence and then it melds into the malt and sugar to form a nice crisp finish. The carbonation is perfect for this type of beer. I could not detect any alcohol while drinking this so be weary when you open one by yourself. I could see this one aging wonderfully if kept in the right conditions. Wonderful beer and highly recommended!"
"D - Very good. Unique in comparison to most strong ales and complex."
"Great beer, but at 11% it's a slow sipper"
"A capped, red foil wrapped 750ml bottle. I picked this up in Ohio just about a year ago, so it's at least that old. Uncapped and poured into my oerbier tulip glass. Appears a cloudy bright golden apricot color with about a finger of fizzy, quickly fading white head. Nose and flavors consist of coriander, candi sugar, spicy yeast, black pepper, orange peel, bread. Syrupy medium body with lively carbonation. Still a bit of alcohol heat, but less than I was expecting. This is one to sip on."
"Nice balance and taste. Alcohol very well-covered for 11% abv."
"D - Alcohol remains well-concealed in this strong ale, which bolsters its drinkability. Sure it's a sipper, but it's quite easy to drink."
"This is definitely not one of my favorites from Alesmith, but it's a tribute to their beer that it's still head and shoulders better than most beers out there. The mouthfeel is lacking for me and needs a bit more carbonation and the fruity sweetness gets a little much after a while. Still, very good."
"Excellent Belgian with a complex, well-melded flavor. The beer pours a cloudy golden color with thick, rich head. There's plenty of lacing. The aroma is excellent. I was surprised to find authentic, excellent Belgian ale aromas and flavor. The aroma is mostly spice, cloves and coriander seed. The flavor is a strong kick of candied apricot and sweet caramel. It's earthy and more complex than the majority of American made Belgian-style ales. It's accessible and very easy to like. Drinkability is great. The alcohol is barely felt, except as a pleasant warming sensation. The sweetness is delicious and never overbearing. It's an excellent beer."
"Poured a clear, yellow with a reasonable head that faded to a thin skin. The aroma is mildly citrusy. The taste was sweet and fruity, but not with tons of carbonation in most BSP/DA's, which I think improves the taste. There was a bit of sour in the taste, too. Feel was crisp, clean and light bodied. Drinkability was good, the 11.0 ABV was well hidden. IMO, the best Belgian strong pale ale that I've had."
"D: This stuff is Really good But its very strong so I have to take away a little on drinkability. One large bottle is more than enough for me."
"A light breakfast-syrupy feel, though a bit thin, and with medium high carbonation. Doubtless, as the bottle says, this beer would age quite well and improve with it. I suppose it's time to run away from here, I needn't be eating fruit loops in the devil's den with his wife any longer. Though I will put it back on my wants..."
"Overall this is another very good beer from AleSmith, certainly worth a shot."
"Aged as recommended, for about a year. Peachy colour, looks elegant. Smells yeasty and malty. Above average mouthfeel that is cuvee-ish dry, rich, and the alcohol hits you later. Corriander and fruit. White pepper. A very good Belgium for a lighter colour."
"2008 vintage- pours honey golden with nice clarity and initially a thick white head, which dissipates quickly. Lacing is soapy. Nose- black and white pepper, oranges, candi sugar and slightly musty. Taste- the pale malt adds a certain breadiness followed by citrus and spice. Sweetness from the candi sugar comes through on the back end, and helps the brew finish quite dry and a little hot. ABV is relatively hidden as drinkability is dangerous. Carbonation is moderate, body fairly light."
"What an outstanding beer. As I'm a newbie to the West Coast, I am truly impressed by Alesmith's effort here. I heard the hype walking into this tasting, so the bar was high - well played, Skip (& probably Tod)."
"First thing to hit ya is the wonderful aroma, yeast and a slight honey sweetness .. . pours a light murky creek river tan,..the ole miss, the ole man.. . has a wonderful all around feel; from the uplifting yeasty aroma, to the absolute clean cut mouthfeel.. roll em up .. very easy to drink, a sipper with loads of complex fun flavours; peach, mango, yeast, honey, plum, tits, pineapple are just some of the flavours ... . thank goodness KotH is getting canceled .. . The alcohol level is absolutely perfect, works well .. . A fantastic well made, enjoyable, empowering, manly yet could be enjoyed by any one kinda person, flavourful kinda brew ... another winner by Alesmith.. . but be careful, packs a huge secret punch..."
"This poured a hazy gold with fluffy white head. It smelled like lemon and wild yeast and salt, with sweet caramel and powdered sugar. It tasted like lots of wild yeast and creamy lemon and caramel, with a bit of sugary cake and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with moderate carbonation, and had a smooth sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean beer with nice flavor and great body. The coriander really helped the lemon hops mesh with the wild yeast. That, along with excellent Belgian candi sugar, resulted in an exceptionally balanced flavor. Better for sipping since alcohol was noticeable (but not overwhelming). Age would probably help mellow this beer some, and further enhance the malty goodness. But this is still a very good beer fresh."
"Poured from a 750ml into Tulip, had a cloudy yellowish, tiny head that disappears very fast. Scent of coriander, apple tarts. Yeasty and notes of floral. Taste was amazing that had caramel and alcohol in your face and bright apples and peaches in the back. Massive carbonation and the yeast are very alive!"
"Overall, It's easy to come by (in So. Cal at least), and reasonably priced. It can be enjoyed anytime anywhere in m opinion."
"The body, as usual, is spot on: nice and full, a little syrupy, but even at room temperature not really. When Alesmith says serve at 55 degress - goddamn it I'm serving at 55 degrees. The gentlemen know what they're doing and I've enjoyed every ride I've been on so far."
"Pours a pretty clear golden colored body, with a creamy white color head good lacing but diminishing. Smells very fruity, lots of fruit, fruit loops comes to mind. Alcohol and belgian flowery aroma. Some spiciness, and I think the coriander too. Some mustiness. Sweet taste, some honey like. Some spiciness, not as good tasting as it smells. Maybe it's the coriander or something, a little too strong. A little mediciny."
"D- I just didn't enjoy this one, won't be having it again."
"Out of a 750ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden brown color, with plenty of yeast floaters, smallish off-white head that left a small ring. The aroma is sweet and spicy. Honey suckle mixed with a strong coriander aroma. The coriander is a bit overpowering. The taste is of pale malt, honey, floral, some orange peel and lemon, and lots and lots of coriander. If you like coriander you will love this brew. The feel is fairly light with prickly carbonation, finishes sweet but not sticky. A well made BSPA for sure but I am not a big fan of excess coriander flavor."
"I just cracked a 750 ml bottle of this stuff for my dad a few minutes ago and poured myself a little, realized I had not reviewed yet although it is probably my fifth encounter with this brew, have had a 2000 and 2002 vintage in the past as well, this particular one would be either a late 2007 or early 2008 bottle, poured into my small Three Philosophers glass, color is a medium orange with some amber red mixed in there as well, 3/4 inch slightly creamy white head, decent retention, some lacing at first, aroma is pears, coriander, booze, sweet yeast, mild hoppiness, plums, esters, berries, sugar, and toffee, flavor starts off subtle then gets aggressive pretty fast, reminds me a lot of a Trappist brew of this style, and I think that is what Alesmith was going for with this one in the first place, each sip has something different it seems like, more fruit as it warms, also hotness from the alchol, like the spice and peaches in the finish by the end, missed both of those in the smell pretty much but they add a nice change later on, mouthfeel is sweet, spicy, hot, and fruity, thin to medium bodied, lighter carbonation and on the verge of being a bit syrupy, not a bad thing here though, makes the beer more full and enjoyable, like how the taste lingers, could probably drink a whole big bottle of this, alcohol is not hidden great but it more enhances the brew than makes it strong and overbearing, smooth and warms up nicely, another quality brew from Alesmith, glad I can walk into a local store and buy whenever I am in the mood for one, a barrel aged version of this would make for an interesting brew, hint hint Peter, will be drinking again, this baby ages well and tastes good fresh, recommended"
"D- Easy to drink, but there needs to be more carbination."
"Drinkability: As always, an outstanding job by the good people over at AleSmith. In fact, I don't recall ever having a brew from them that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed."
"A great #666, many thanks to BrewerB again."
"Pours a lightly hazed yellow golden, light amber, thin white head forms, quickly drops down to a thin ring around the glass and layer, no real lacing on the glass, but solid retention. Smell is neat, sweet and sugary, some honey, those peach candies, apricots, light orange peel and lemon, touch of spice, apples/pears, pretty nice. Taste is interesting, lots of apple juice character, caramel, cinnamon, peaches, apricot, pears, very fruity, some alcohol comes through but is well hidden, nice lemony spice finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, pretty smooth and drinkable considering the ABV, although a little bit too much like juice for me. Thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is pretty good. there's a decent amount of alcohol in there and tons of fruity character lending a gentle sweetness, yet it all seems to come together. i'd be curious to see how time would change this one. might have to find another and stash it in the cellar..."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a hazy, golden color. Mine actually had almost no head on it at all. There was no ""pop"" when I opened it either. Very nice aroma. Banana, cloves, wheat, spices, sweetness, and a few others. Very nice taste. Slight notes of the bananas, coriander, yeast breadiness, other spices and fruits. This is a very nice brew."
"Flavor is initially very fruity, again reminds me of stone fruit, only more like canned peaches this time, with a hint of pears. Very mild corriander spice and good but not over the top carbonation. Finishes clean but fruity. Drinkability is very high, as all the flavors are mild enough to keep an otherwise big beer light and happy. Any hop presense in the flavor or aroma is minimal enough not to be terribly noticable, but the bitterness levels are nicely balanced."
"Pours darker gold with a short-lived bubbly head. Aroma full of yeast, bread, apples, and coriander. Very smooth motuhfeel and taste. Nice balance between the Candi sugar and fruity tartness. Trippel-like yeastiness with more of an alcoholic back. Very enjoyable."
"From a 750 ml bottle this poured a golden orange with a fat long-lasting white head and good lacing Nose is spicy with the coriander showing but also some yeast on top of citrus and floral hops that are light but apparent. Mouthfeel is smooth but lively on the palate Flavor is slightly sweet as is the finish .I found this to be exceptionally easy to drink and overall a very nice brew."
"Very good beer."
"The body is moderate, surprising considering the ABV. Some astringency from the spice. Carbonation is low for style. Overall I think if this beer was a bit more crisp and backs off on some of the spices, it could really be a winner. But eh."
"Notes from 6/3/08"
"Poured into a chalice, this beer looks like a solid bar of gold in the glass. Big bubbly head on top crashes down to a thin layer of froth. The aroma is big on coriandar. Belgian sugar and candied apricots noted as well. Ok, here it goes.... thick and quite syrupy on the palate with a little alcohol, the latter most noted as it goes down the throat. wow, this is very potent stuff. The coriandar is big in this beer, and the sweetness of this beer plays second fiddle. Very spiced, almost overbearing. it's fine on its own, but a pairing with food would make this brew more drinkable."
"Very well done, and certainly well deserving. A few extra touches and could challenge the best belgian versions."
"I have never handed a beer back to a waitress before, but there is always a first for everything. I had been very excited to try this beer, but the coriander was simply too much for me."
"D-A bit to spicy and sweet for me to enjoy fully. I can appreciate what is being with this one though. Certainly one to be shared and enjoyed over a long session. A firesdie sipper!"
"This beer is spicy as hell and I think the spicing detracts just a bit from the drinkability. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic beer for sitting back and relaxing over dinner and a long evening."
"D- I found this brew to be very easy to drink. I enjoyed the bold taste."
"drinkability: fairly high"
"I have drank this beer before in years past, but I don't remember it tasting as well as it does right now. This has great taste and balances 11% (yes, 11%) alcohol with great, light, spicy flavor."
"750ml bottle with a red foil wrapping. Pourd into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a golden orangish color with a large creamy off-white head that sticks around forever. This has to be one of my favorite bottle designs, it looks extremely sinister for a beer. The aroma is sweet malt with some fruit (apples and pears), coriander and other spices and yeast. The taste features some fruit like in the nose and some spices with some warming in the finish from the high ABV. This one tastes like a spiced Tripel. Overall, Horny Devil is another solid beer from Alesmith that is recommended."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, so this is a bit hard to drink; top notch if I were rating it as a beer judge but I won't often return to it"
"Drinkability on this strong brew is really high when sampled out of Keg at the Brewery. Had never tried one of these brews from some reason. I've been making a mistake. A wonderful beer, great nose of some citrus, oil hops and pine zest. A+ balance and a long finish. Looking forward to trying this out of a 750ml bottle now. On Tap this was maybe the best belgium stong beer I've had."
"Overall I thought this was very good. Not sure what was up with the look of it, but it did not detract from the overall experience at all. I thought this was a classic ale for Alesmith and something that I would love to try again. Will have to try this one on tap one day as it seems to be outstanding!"
"Taken from my notes on 06.01.08. Poured into a Duvel glass. Pretty darn carbonated as a white tidal wave reached the rim. Hazy golden in appearance. I picked up some nice fruity esters with a touch of honey on the aroma. Very crisp & spicy on the taste with not too much sweetness that I typically find on American Belgian-style beers. Zesty, yeasty mouthfeel. Perhaps a touch thin for a 11% beer? Dry-champagne like finish."
"D- I do enjoy this beer. I do not think that the end of the keg is the best representative. I will probably re-rate this down the road, but until then..."
"M/D - Very nice, particularly given the potent..."
"Bomber, foiled, capped and w/o freshness/vintage info....Pours clear w/o nearly the expected carbonation for the style, quite minor head, just a thin film, but leaving plenty of fine, intricate lacing upon a gentle swirl. Tons of very tiny bubbles continuing to rise to the top. Nose is lightly of fresh fruits, with alcohol, and coriander. Tasty, clearly high quality offering, light coriander, mintyness, some warming alcohol, juniper, anise, complexity is impressive. Another stunner from AleSmith, what is in that San Diego water? Go and get some if you can find it in your local area."
"D : This was easily drinkable and one that I would love to pick up again. An excellent brew."
"Overall, this is a good beer that is worth purchasing again. Unique."
"D: lighter than I was expecting, but very satisfying"
"Drinks great for the ABV & style. Rivals anything I had in Belgium. AleSmith is quickly becoming favorite Cali Brewery!"
"Pours a slightly (chill?) hazey yellow/orange color with good fluffy head. The nose is very fruity with belgian yeast and some slight funk (good funk). The taste is very good with fruity, yeasty, wheaty flavor and some great spice flavorings. Through the middle a nice crisp almost appley citrus (not hoppy, but citrus flavor) bite occurs. Probably the coriander shining through. Some alcohol in the taste, but i would have guessed 7 0r 8% not 11! Mouthfeel is good, but slightly abrasive on the carbonation. Drinkability is very high for a brew of this weight. Another good one from the brewmelders at alesmith. Thanks again for the trade, Dana!"
"Oh, yes."
"Drinkability is good, as is this beer overall. Not great, with some technical faults, but overall tasty and enjoyable. I still think I'd peg it as American in a blind tasting, which is a turn-off for me in the style."
"I thought this was really good, and would recommend. Thanks to SurlySober for sharing."
"Big ass bottle. Pours a very clear mandarin orange color. I'm not familiar with the labeled ""coriander"" aroma nor flavor, but I smell and taste honey...and I like it! It is a nicely balanced sweet beer with a long dry finish. I can't believe the bottle says 11% alcohol, it's very hidden. Although I might be trashed after drinking this whole thing!"
"Horny Devil pours a hazy, deep gold color with a big, fluffy white head. The head remains thick after disappating just a little. Lots of lacing is left down the inside of the glass. The Smell is sweet and sour with a moderate hop aroma that is a little earthy. There is also a butterscotch and pear smell present. The coriander and spices used create a pleasant peppery scent. For an 11% beer, the alcohol is so well balanced that it is barely noticeable. The sweetness combines with the hoppiness and creates a wonderful flavor with a spicy aftertaste. Coriander, orange, and white pepper are noticeable in the taste along with bananas in the aftertaste. Horny Devil leaves the tongue tingling and yearning for more. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth with a nice effervescence. This is definitely one of the best beers I've had. I highly recommend it."
"D: A very good BSPA, you'd never know it was 11.00% alc./vol, there's virtually no alcohol taste at all, a very good production."
"Got this in a recent shipment from Vin De Pays (Long Beach, CA). It pours a cloudy color into my glass. I can definitely pick up on the coriander, yeast, and some clove. The taste is great, as you can pick up on the coriander and get some of the hops. I think that this is a great take on a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. The alcohol is well masked in this beer, making it very drinkable. The price is high for this beer, but it's definitely one that I will buy again (when I get my allowance)."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is an interesting twist on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style. A little to much spice and not enough beer flavors to really be a favorite of mine for this style. But it's still an interesting beer that's worth a try."
"2006 bottle: Pours a hazy copper color with a thick and foamy off-white head that diminishes slowly. Patchy lacing. Coriander, orange peel and yeast in the nose. Medium-bodied with a sweet character. Flavors of Belgian candi sugar, yeast and sweet spices are all present. Touches of alcohol and malt are present as well. The finish is sweet sugar and spice and lingers a bit. Overall this is an enjoyable Belgian, although it does not quite live up to the standard set by AlesmithÂ’s other beers. It swings a little too far on the sweet side so the complexity suffers a bit as a result. I would get this again but the price would make me think twice."
"D-This is a very nice BSPA. I will buy this again the next time I am out-of state (as well as the Alesmith and Yulesmith IPAs). Alesmith is quickly becoming one of my favorites-but I can't get it unless I take an 80 min trip. The alcohol is quite noticable in the mouthfeel and this is a great example of my favorite style-but is not my favorite example. The mouthfeel could use some improvement. I do wish that more of these American-Belgians were brewed with the same craftmanship as this one."
"Syrupy mouthfeel followed by an amazing dry finish. I'm almost getting a dry white wine feel with this one. Other mentioned the sweetness but I just don't see it. Looked for a date on the bottle and couldn't find one. I'm thinking this has mellowed considerably with time. This one is a nice sipper, maybe a little one dimensional. Dosn't knock my socks off but certainly better than many seam to think. I would certainly give this one a repeat visit."
"This is a potent brew with some very good flavor. It may be too powerful for the flavor profile. I will be curious to see what my friends who frequent Belgium might say."
"Overall an OK brew but too sweet to drink too much. Seemed one dimensional and lacking character. Not a beer that I will have again. I like Belgians, but this wasn't one."
"Worst AleSmith beer yet. I have to wonder if this one had a bad cap seal because I would expect more carbonation in this ale style. I will leave this as a placeholder and try again. Still caps don't normally leak."
"The taste is rather forgettable. I'm a big lover of Alesmith beers, but this is easily the least of their offerings. Not a bad beer, mind you, just not overpowering. There's some slight malt, some weird spices (again...what are those?), maybe a hint of a fruit background. Just ... not as much here. I'm used to Alesmith offerings being explosive taste grenades, and this isn't it. Tastes like a toned down douple ipa mixed with a toned down scotch ale, if such a thing could be imagined."
"pours a clear gold, with out much of a head, almost looks like a macro. The smell is a bit sweet, with a large hint of apples, with Belgian yeast and spices. The taste is mostly of tart apples, much like the smell with Belgian spices, and a decent malty character. The warming alcohol is quite nice on a fall evening. Mouthfeel is good for the 11% ABV, and quite drinkable. Im still disappointed with the un-noteworthy appearance, but overall an interesting brew."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a powerful pale malt scent that is balanced nicely with a spicey coriander aroma. It's got a wonderful fruity yeast aroma. It blends well with the malt aroma. The taste is great. It has a damn good malt flavor.It's warm yet, mellowed out with the coriander. It goes down easy and finishes with a kick ass fruity yeast taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine Belgian style brew. It's got great malt character as well as excellent spice and yeast content."
"D: Very good. The alcohol presence is made known but it's not too intrusive."
"4 / 4.5 / 4.5 / 4 / 4.5"
"What a disappointment and what potential this beer has. The downer is the pour. There's no head ... a Belgian with no head ... not good for starters. The smell is candied sugars, coriander, fruits, alcohol. The taste is so compromised by the lack of carbonation, head, and mid section that this beer just falls down in all the wrong places. It wasn't until I read some reviews that I discovered that the beer I poured wasn't flat after all. The complexity is nice, and there is plenty of balance to talk about. The alcohol is a little too warming in the aftertaste but its the lack of any carbonation which just kills it for me. My next one this evening will be a Karmeliat and I'm looking forward to the pour."
"D - Fantastic beer, just phenomenal drinkability - wonderful to taste again after about 730 days -exactly."
"D - This really reminds me of Dogfish 120. Very thick, quite hoppy, and hard as hell to drink. Some decent carbonation would help this beer tremendously. The best feature is the hop character, but it isn't good enought to redeem this one. I am not going to dump it, but I am pretty pissed off that I paid $12.99 for this."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy amber color with no head or lacing. Amazing aroma of coriander, apricot, and maybe a little citrus to it. Excellent full mouthfeel. Complex flavor. Definite coriander start, with a strong alcohol taste to it as well. Finish is almost peach-like. A great offering from Alesmith."
"D- This beer is simple but has a great flavor. Even though it has lots of sweet flavors it is not syrupy sweet and the flavors are very subtle. The alcohol does play in the flavor but it is really smooth for such high alcohol content."
"Drinkability - The 11% ABV is well integrated. A good drinker."
"In its prime, I'm sure this is a fine beer, but not under these circumstances. I'm still glad I had the opportunity to try something else from this brewer."
"Aftertaste leaves you with sugar and orange peel plus something a little stale...I think the alcohol and yeast reminents."
"Poured from a 750ml green bottle with a red foil cover and a simple cap. I've had this beer for about a year and a half in my cellar. Not sure how long it was in the store. I want to say first that I love the Alesmith products, and I love all Belgian styles. That being saaid, this one, at least at this age, can only be described as a fruit bomb and was a little bit of a shocker. Poured a slightly hazy golden with a decent head that faded pretty quickly and left minimal laccing. My sample didn't seem quite as flat as some others have reported, but it was a little low in carbonation. The smell and taste were both very fruity, but changed significantly toward the tropical as the bottle warmed and breathed. Some banana and apricot as well as coriander on the nose at first, and then as it warmed huge mango aromas. The taste was similar, with more restrained coriander, banana and apricot at first and then huge apricot, mango and persimmon flavors. The mouthfeel was a little slick, but there was some creaminess there as well, and as noted the carbonation was slightly low. I liked this beer at first, but as the intense tropical flavors grew it just became a little overwhelming and hard to finish- it was that fruity. I even like fruit beers, but this was super intense and also too sweet in the end."
"Drinkability suffers slightly from the high ABV & lack of carbonation. Overall a nice sipper I'd like to try fresher."
"This is one beer I could easily drink and drink - up until that point where the 11% starts kicking in! Highly recommended."
"A good beer, but perhaps the alcohol kills the taste a bit."
"Sampled from a goblet. Hazy, golden color with a steady-rising bead. Thick and bright white head that settles to a cap of foam. Mostly fruity banana-type smells from yeast most likely. Also sweet, bready smells. Taste is about the same with some light clovey spiciness. The fairly high alcohol is well-hidden and has a raisiny taste in aftertaste. Excellent mouthfeel that is mostly on the creamy side. Laces glass fairly well as it empties. Moderate dryness in mouthfeel as it warms. Good drinkability especially with the booziness not ever really showing up for me."
"D: Nice and tasty. Hides its ABV well. Good domestic take on a Belgian strong pale ale with a subtle twist."
"However, this beer was really drikable despite it's 11% abv. I think the only thing they could do is bring the abv down to 9-10 range and it would provide a perfect balance."
"Cheers!"
"D: The strong spices and big abv make pounding this ale impossible but the flavors are nice and almost reminiscent of a Chimay blue."
"Drinkability/Overall: An interesting ""Belgianesque beer."" Didn't get a whole lot of coriander, which is what this beer claims as its ""feature"" ingredient, but still a light, and V-Day appropriate fruity ale. At 11%, the booze lets itself be known, but with only a half glass left from the 750, I'm feeling no worse for wear. Mission Accomplished."
"Drinkability is a little below average because the beer can be a little overwhelming if you're not ready for it. The coriander is quite strong but after a little while the taste buds adapt. It's not going to please everyone right away."
"A very vigorous pour only gets about an inch of light tan head on top of this glowing orange amber body. Nose is very sweet with hints of orange, cherry candy, anise, and soft malt. Long malt candied sweetness rushes the tast buds as you take first sip. it is very silky smooth with great backbone to the palate. For all the sweetness this beer is ver well balanced and wonderful for the style. Leaves a thick mouthfeel. Makes you want another sip. Very drinkable and enjoyable well made brew."
"D - Not your typical Belgian Strong Pale in my mind. Sweet and fruity with a bog alcohol punch. A heavy dose of coriander when I pour the yeast into my last sip."
"Pours golden amber in color with a bit of a chill-haze and a short creamy white head. Nose is coriander and spicy yeast along with fruity alcohol esters and a bit of vanilla bean. Taste begins with sweet bready malts and candied sugar along with coriander and fruity yeast followed by a bit of vanilla extract. Perhaps a bit more coriander and noticeable alcohol than I would have liked, but still quite enjoyable."
"The taste is very complex. Sweet and candied with a very dry spicy finish. Nice hops bitterness with a grassy herbal flavor. Seems like a little too much at once. Tastes quite strong, but definitely not in the 11% range, so it is ""smooth"" in that regard. Still not feeling it, especially compared to other AleSmith offerings I've had the pleasure of trying thanks to the generosity of BA dogfooddog."
"750 ml crown capped bottle."
"Were it not for the alcohol weight, I'd think this was a refreshing sports drink. Were it not for yeasty afteraste, I'd think it was fine champagne. It's neither, thank god; instead, it's just a really tasty beer."
"This beer pours a golden orange with a white head thats alittle on the small side. The lacing is lacking and the head disappears abit quickly making this Ok looking. The smell is pungent with coriander, candy sugar, and lemon,not bad,but nothing fantastic. The taste is almost thick and creamy with coriander, lemon,wheat,candy sugar, and mixed citrus zest. The m/f is very good with a medium creamy feel and a great mixture of flavors. A good beer that hides the alcohol well,but is lacking in some qualities that make Belgians great."
"A pretty good little Belgian pale ale. I do like the extra kick of corriander, but I think that this brew has something missing as far as flavor. It is still a tasty brew, though...make no mistake. Recommended."
"I would recommend it if the carbonation problem is limited to this beer, otherwise it is a major fault in my opinion."
"Recieved, I think, from Zorro in a trade, probably last fall or winter and cellared since."
"When poured into a glass, the color was of a thick, hazy golden yellow, with an orange hue. And there was absolutley no foam what so ever. At first, I could smell spicies and a hint of a yeasty nature. The taste was of spices, but couldn't pick up any yeast taste. This belgium ale is thick, but kind of flat tasting. I like the flavor, but, the flatness is what makes this ale just average instead of upbove average. All in all, it still an enjoyable belgium ale."
"Bottom line: My initial impression was so-so but the more I sipped on this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, the more it pleased my palate. My hat's off to Alesmith once again!"
"M&D - apart from being nearly thick and tasty, nearly chewy, this beer is warming, it warms the mouth, tongue, throat on the way down, the only drawback is the fizziness, but its so slight it doesnt take anything away from the beer, it upholds Alesmiths reputation handily"
"Bottle courtesy of Black95tt: Poured a light orangey color ale with a good foamy head with little retention. Aroma of spices is clearly dominating with some traces of the Belgian yeast. The spices that probably include coriander also dominate taste as well as slightly funky yeast, some sweet malt and a light dry finish. Alcohol is well masked which I appreciated but body was a bit too watery for the style."
"D: This beer is definately better on tap than it is in the bottle. Very much enjoyable on draft."
"Disapointing, this wasn't the complexion or finess I expected with Alesmith, its good, but rather bold without boasting much substance."
"A definte split personality. It pours a cloudy yellow with little head...very unimpressive. Smell likewise is a touch of lemon and some subtle yeast...ho hum. Then, the taste kicks in..Jekyll and Hyde for sure! ...a full malty, citrus. smooth experience that must be sampled to be appreciated. The mouthfeel is almost beyond smooth...from front to back palate. For 11 abv this is unbelievably smooth on the drinkability scale. Get past the appearance and smell and experience a truly great brew."
"It may seem strange for me to thank Clickpush for this beer since I seemed unhappy with it but this was an extra he threw in out of the kindness of his BA heart. For that, I thank you my friend. I am definitely glad I got to try it."
"Pours a dirty blonde leaving a very thin white lace. The aroma is honey, cloves, super sweet ""natural honey candy"" is what comes to mind. The taste mirrors the nose, very sweet, the alcohal is faint well hidden masking the 11% but warming. As this beer warms a bit candied orange, peach, and caramel all come to mind. The finish is smooth and lite, one that you need to sip and enjoy slowly."
"This beer is yet another example of the brewing excellence emanating from Southern California in general and AleSmith in particular. Style after style hits the bull right smack dab on the nose and Horny Devil is no exception. After drinking AleSmith beer, I always wish that I had picked up at least a case when I had the chance. That, more than anything else, is the mark of a world-class brewery."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Mouthfeel is silky, smooth, and clean. The finish leaves a slightly herbal tingle in your throat, but overall has little long term effect on the mouth. This makes it frighteningly drinkable for something pushing 11%. Light, smooth, airy and creamy, and non-filling, means you can really get yourself into trouble with this stuff."
"a good sipper. strives to be well rounded, but seems to be on the cusp of age-inspired destruction. don't think this will improve too much further than the 18 months have pushed it. good beer for a u.s., overall iffy for something wrapped up so pretty."
"Opened with the teensiest pfft, and microscopic bubbles can be seen in the brew. Not particularly hopeful... Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a lazy, big-bubbled yet uneven head above the orangey copper (still apple juice colored) brew. Big bubbles lasting around the edges, but no longer much of a head, with some delicate lacing. Aroma is some spices, with a sweet fruity tinge to it as well. Taste is pervasive spices, with granular sugary malt component coupled to a light fruitiness, and alcoholic close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are still lacking due to low carbonation, but at least this brew was better than my last experience. Guess I won't bother to revisit this again."
"Good medium body to this lightish looking ale, don't let the looks fool you, or you'll get hurt...11%ABV, I think so. This one surely fits it's style, even though it looks like a Belgian blond, it just tastes like a Strong Belgian brew...period ! Enjoy !"
"On tap at the brewery, very thin white head with small amount of lace. Tons of spicy phenols and herbs in the Belian aroma. I could smell this all day long. Very tight small bubbles that explode this effervecent aroma. Taste is good a little too much phenols for me but still a good taste. Excellent on the palate wanting more after the crisp finish. Very drinkable brew for this high alcohol brew."
"The smell is nice and strong but coriander and spice are so powerful that nothing else can come through. It doesn't dominate the taste, however. Pale malt, esters, and a bit of alcohol are all present. Spice and coriander come strong in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly sharp while drinkability is great for the alcoholic content."
"Virtually no head developed when I poured this alcoholic monster. Only a tiny ring appeared after some time. Its a bright gold/copper color with tiny floating specks of matter floating about. Nice color, but without much head it seems dull. The smell is citrusy (orange)and hoppy, but not that potent. The alcohol doesn't come through that strong in the aroma suprisingly. The flavor takes time to develop. Sweet and fruity at the start, slowly becoming sour and alcoholic at the finish, almost way too alcoholic. Not very bitter, but the alcohol rides too high and ruins the flavor in my opinion. The mouthfeel is a bit flat and it feels thin also. I liked where they tried to go with this but it became hard to drink after while, and I usually like strong brews..."
"Clear gold topped by a rich white head. Spotty lace throughout. Toasted malt aroma with rich fruitiness and a hint of spice and coriander. There's also a bit of alcohol that peaks through as it warms. Bready sweetness hits you first, but is quickly balanced by a restrained bitterness. Spice fills out the mid and leads into the finish, where it combines with mild alcohol warmth and dryness. Full bodied and palate coating, rich texture, low carbonation. The alcohol is masterfully blended into the character of the beer, making it a dangerously easy drink!"
"Thanks DrJay!"
"Body is nearly large, texture is soft and refined with a slick, dry mouthfeel and well concealed abv%, making it dangerously drinkable."
"Hits a powerful punch . . . I really would like to try one of these on my own, not just as a taster. Great balance of hops, the alcohol is barely noticeable. Taste out of this world, one of the best tasting Belgian Strong Pale Ales I've had the experience of tasting. This is my first AleSmith but definitely not my last. I think I can pick up a Speedway Stout and enjoy it just as much in the next few weeks."
"Drinkability- Goes down super easy and really hits you when you get to the end of the bottle. Will be buying this again for sure."
"This beer pours a golden orange color with very little lacing to note. Nose is sweet, of spices and belgian candy. Taste is sweet and slightly of pepper spices and belgian yeast, somewhat smooth, and an alcohol warming finish in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. The ABV is very high and it is well masked in the taste. It is worthy of a try but rather expensive and one of those special occasion brews."
"750ml bottle Pours a cloudy straw yellow, no carbonation, no head, but some lacing. Scents or orange, coriander, a little alcohol. Nice taste tangy, sweet, with a hint of alcohol. Medium body. Very drinkable at 11% ABV which the bottle sez. I like this offering from AleSmith, very nice would buy again and recommend to people."
"I particularly enjoyed the smell of Horny Devil, which captures a pleasing barnyard essence offset by a slight whiff of ginger ale. Very classy. The body is clear autumn yellow with a few flocs, casual carbonation, and minimal head. The taste is golden rustic and traditional with very little evidence of the 11% ABV. A late surge of coriander compliments the finish though something in the end does manage to fall flat, perhaps as a result of poor cellaring. I would definitely seek this again."
"Dark gold color, very clear, with virtually no head at all (What the heck?). The aroma is very rich. Orange, coriander, yeast in the form of fresh bread (and I live above a bakery). This is one beer where the aroma pretty much exactly matches the flavor. Distinct coriander and orange zest that is backed by fresh baked bread (Sourdough). Sweetness that reminds me of Jolly Ranchers (Orange flavor). The mouth feel is slightly tacky, yet is still a bit light. There is a ton of alcohol here. Possibly a bit too much. This could hurt the drinkability."
"750 ml bottle provided by Eyedrinkale as part of BIF20, thanks much! Shared with three other BAs at a quiet gathering in late November, 2005. Pours a small amount of bubbles on the surface. Not carbonation foam, bubbles like you could get from water. Crisp orange gold liquid with some fine particulates suspended. Smells carry brandy and bourbon (my wife says it smells metallic). Caramel and alcohol sting. The taste is Halloween candy caramel...that is cheap and waxy. Funky phenolics are minimal, but there is a sour character. Green apples and mango. Creamy mouthfeel, but the flavors just don't come together on it."
"Beer is good. Happy Belgian strong beering."
"This beer pours a golden brown with a white head that fades very slowly leaving a lot of laces. It smells slightly spicy. It also smells slightly honey like. Not much in the way of hops. I hate to say it since I like most AleSmith beers, but I am not too fond of the aroma of this beer. This beer tastes quite syrupy. It is very sweet. Very sweet. I taste alcohol. It is very strong. It has a malty taste. Almost Barley Wine like. I detect some spicy like flavors to it. This beer is carbonated well. It leaves an alcohol like aftertaste. This beer is quite aggressive. I dont think this beer would make a good session beer. It is quite alcoholic and the aggressive flavor might be a bit much. This beer is good to try, but dont go out of your way."
"Recommended, even though it is a bit expensive. 750mL set me back $12.50."
"Note: Towards the end of the bottle I decided to pour a glass of apple cider and compare. Not too much of a difference."
"after smelling this brew i was not prepared for what i tasted. i'm not going to cry ""false advertising," but mom was right when she told me not to judge a beer's taste by its aroma. while the nose was subdued, my tongue is attacked by coriander and white pepper, galvanized by a backbone of alcohol heat. at first it seems very spritzy, even though it's not highly carbonated. the attack subsides and i'm left with the residual effects of some spice, but mostly a funky, porty sourness that makes me crave brats and kraut. i get some cinnamon in there, too"
"Overall this is a good beer. Quite sweet, so be aware of that. And with the high strength, I suggest you split the 750 mL bottle unless you have a while to enjoy this brew."
"Pours a deep orange/amber.. fruity aroma with hints of apple and peach.. The taste is less complex than I had expected. Initially sweet and yeasty, with a spicy malt finishÂ… a noticeable alcohol flavor detracts from the overall taste. Medium bodied yet thin at the same timeÂ… Overall a rather boring beer with very little redeeming qualities...Would not have this again."
"Finished malty and spicy. LIttle hop flavor in this one. Real warming in the finish. Fantastic holiday beer."
"In my opinion, 3 years seems to be the max on this one before it starts to shrivel up. It doesn't develop any more character through aging, and all that happens is that it becomes more crisp and dry. There's a wide medium ground, but I find it best fairly fresh - within a year or two."
"Drinkability - liquid candy for adults. The roasty flavors take this beer up a level. Props to drewbage for this beauty. Another top notch winner from AleSmith."
"Notes: this is the closest american version of a belgian strong pale ale I have ever had. (note I have had alot, just havent reviewed them as i'm new to the site and won't review off of memory, only while tasting)"
"Drinkablility is ok, but honestly I'd rather sit and enjoy the smell on this one than drink it. Just doesn't float my particular boat, I guess."
"Had this a while back. Wanted to re-visit it. The beer pours a hazy orangey-peachy color with a finger of head that falls to an uneven coat over the brew. Nice and pretty. The nose is nice, with a bit of spicey orange citrus and slight wheaty grain. I dig it a lot. The flavor is not as nice as the aroma. Its a little like a creamy orange, but almost with a soapyness in there. Doesn't really do it for me as much as I recall it doing the first time. The feel is thick, almost syrupy, wtih a light carbonation. I find the flavor keeps this from being a highly drinkable beer. That soapy character just doesn't do it for me. The 10% does not come through at all with this brew, so drinkability is big. A pretty good beer all things considered."
"Overall, though, this just wasn't what I was hoping for. I have had any number of well built Belgian Strong Pale Ales that I've really enjoyed, but this one isn't one of them."
"Impression: Very well constructed, and more Belgian in character than I expected. I've been very impressed with the handful of Alesmith brews I've been fortunate to sample, and this one is certainly a winner. Wish I could find these in Kentucky, Tennessee, or southwestern Virginia."
"A hazy orange color with a thin but consistent white head on top. Aroma of orange, pears and spice come across the nose. There is a hint of a musty yeast aroma and alcohol that comes into play. Malt up front with the taste and the spices and yeasty tones come in. A sweet honey like tone also is present. Alcohol is noticeable but not to overwhelming. A busy beer, a lot of different flavors going on. A bit thin on the mouthfeel but overall a nice brew."
"Finger licking good!"
"I'm not sure that I would keep it much over six months. But perhaps it would lose some of the sweetness."
"Full-bodied, long, fruity, spicy finish. A nice brew for sharing with friends, celebrations, nice dinners....wish I had a bottle for every happy occasion that comes my way."
"Carbonation is scant, unfortunately. Big honey melon flavors mingle with alcohol and powdered coriander. Just loaded with flavor ranging from the absurdly phenolic to the intensely sweet. A bit more carbonation would really have helped cut the intensity to a more manageable level. As it is, the sweet, syrupy flavors intensify and plasticize slightly before a peppery and tongue-dulling hop bite. Just an inch short of spectacular."
"Mouthfeel is okay, slightly undercarbonated, but at least it's not overly carbonated so that you taste only bubbles. This is probably the only fault with the beer. Of course, I'm still drinkin' it, so there!"
"Overall: this was a major disappointment considering how much I like Alesmith's Yulesmith and IPA. Horny Devil was as close to a drain pour as a beer can get with me and still manage to not get dumped. At $10.99 a bottle I expected much more. I'll probably try it again as I can't imagine it's really supposed to be this way. But I won't be trying it again soon."
"Pours a copper color with a small head that sticks around for some time. The aroma is comprised of an orange/corriander feel and sweetness. Smells great. The flavor is very malty and sweet with some spices (corriander/orange) and a bit of grainyness. Extremely well crafted beer. Loved this one and I'm looking forward to the other AleSmith beers."
"750mL bottle poured into a pint glass (no tulip-style glass present, boo!). It pours a medium amber-red color with two fingers of head. There is no lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, very inviting. A little spicy and a little citrusy. The taste is sweet and malty, with some fruity characters. So complex I can hardly describe it. The body is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is deadly. Great stuff! A shout out to clvand0 for making my brew day a little bit better."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a small bubbly off white head that left trace lace as it subsided quickly. A small amount of carbonation is present. A nice aroma of malt, hops, coriander and plums. The flavor consisted of both malt and hops with background of corinader with some sweet fruity undertones. The body was slightly creamy and the finish a touch astrigent, yet bittersweet. Not a bad beer, but a bit pricey."
"Sampled on tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Lighting wasn't great, but this looked to be a faded orange with a long lasting bubbly white head that laced gently down the tulip glass. First and foremost in the aroma is coriander...lots of coriander. Swirling it around a little & trying to get past the coriander (which I like) allowed me to pick up some some additional scents of sweet orange liquor and rock candy. In the mouth, this ale really burst with flavor. More coriander across the top of the flavor profile, but not as dominant as in the nose & complimented gorgeously by more subtle spices, candied sweetness, & deep ripe fruit (banana, lemon, & orange). Some mild earthy hops are present in the background & contribute to this brew's complexity. Subtle, but warming alcohol evident throughout. Medium bodied with a very dry finish. Delicious."
"Drinkability is excellent. Very true to Belgian style. Another Alesmith classic."
"Mouthfeel is moderately heavy, but the carbonation keeps it from getting too thick feeling. Overall, If I had to guess, I'd say it is more like a Tripel than a Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"This one came in a very cool looking 750ml capped bottle. In the goblet this looked a cloudy golden orange color with a small white head that dropped to a light bubbly cap. Very nice lacing was left around the goblet as it was consumed. The nose was filled with spice, coriander I am guessing along with a slight sweetness. The taste was very similar as a fruit sweetness was backed by spiciness and a bit of alcohol. There was also a slightly bitter aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is full and rich, as most Alesmith offerings are. Overall this is a very interesting beer that is tasty but the drinkability is hindered by the over use of spice as is wears on you by the end of the bottle."
"Glorious looking bottle Mondial saturday gathering at tiggmtlÂ’s. Thanks a ton to Captaincougar for his legendary generosity Amber yellow, clear, light off-white head. Fruity aroma, yeasty coriander, orange, pears, alcohol and ginger. Pleasant enough, but IÂ’d like some funkiness in the yeast, or something farmy. Palate is also moderately yeasty with more fruity notes (lime, pear). The cookie malt feels a little stale though, like a fruit juice and the balancing bitterness seems a bit restrained. Alcohol burn is considerable. Top notch alesmith mouthfeel though, full bodied with nice medium carbonation, creamy. I like the fruitiness, but donÂ’t find much else to contemplate.. Slightly disappointing in that regard."
"Thank's for the horny beer Mr. Bum."
"Note: 11% per bottle unlike the 10% listed above. Definately going to pick a bottle (or ten) and age it. Yums..."
"Delicious flavor. Mango, pineapple, peanut butter, green grapes, black peppers, banana and coriander throughout. This was one awesome tasting beer. Fluffy in the mouth and quite lovely. I want more."
"A bit too dominated by the coriander to be easily enjoyable, but still an interesting experiment. Not great and not something I'd really seek out again."
"Overall, a great beer for sitting and sipping during those terrible movies that your significant other insists you watch on Valentine's Day. A special thanks to Gusler for this brew!"

"Though a strong Belgian, there were not overtly strong flavors or sensations. It came across as a much lighter beer, and I was surprised to learn it was so highly alcoholic. I can't wait for next thanksgiving to share this at the table."
"Appearance: Golden honey tone with a suprisingly thin white head leaves specks of lacing quite disappointing appearance. Aroma: Rich complex honey tinged fruit tones tropical fruit like some pineapple and mango type flow. Taste: Very sweet with the alcohol leaving it's mark on the palate very heavy in the plethora of flavor going on here with rich syrupy notes of pear, mango, and pineapple comes a dry finish. The sweetness is this beers primary flavor attribute but also one that cuts back on the drinkability. Mouthfeel: I would say medium bodied ale with a lot of texture from the syrupy fruit a bit cloying due to the sweetness. Drinkability: Very tasty and flavorful however the lack of carbonation takes away from the crispness turning into a strong alcoholic syrup, it's better than that but I am quite disappointed from this offering from Alesmith. The IPA, ESB, and X were fantastic so far just a lot of rich flavors take away from the drinkability here."
"No real head on this beer. It is a very clear golden color. There is a bit of weird aroma emanating from my glass, I am not quite sure what it is though. It tastes a bit cidery. It is thin bodied, lightly alcoholic in the finish, and there is a light sweetness running throughout. I detect an astringent mustiness as well. This really needs to be highly carbonated, this is just lightly carbonated. Does this get better? It must, right? Not too interesting at all. So disappointing coming from this brewery, it is in fact a drain pour for me, I have much better things in the fridge waiting for me."
"Drinkability: Oddly enouhg, a very enjoyable brew, especially on Halloween night. Not what I expected at all. I like it, but I don't know why."
"Interesting pour, couldn't get as much of a head out of this one as I usually expect from Belgian pale ales. The head that did form settled quickly. Nevertheless, it's a nice looking beer, golden with a red hue, accented by lots of ascending bubbles. Huge peppery spiciness in the aroma, followed by a little lemon and coriander. A bit estery, small amount of tart apple and some dried fruit. A bit yeasty. Sharp and zesty on the palate. Smooth and malty sweet at the start with spicy pepper on the edges of the tongue. Candi sugar is detectable here. Spiciness increases as it hits the middle, and a bit of dried fruit shows up here as well. I'm getting some banana too. Lemony and sharp near the back, with hoppiness showing up right before the finish. Pepper and coriander all the way through. Spicy and dry finish. Excellent take on the style. I love peppery spiciness in beers. There aren't too many of these brewed in America outside of Unibroue's, and this one is right up there with the best. Another impressive offering from Alesmith, a brewery that definitely lives up to the reputation given to it by the many beer lovers who speak so highly of it."
"I just had this for the second time, and I enjoyed it both times. Certainly a unique, tart taste. Cloudy, almost orange hue. Decent sized head, but not huge. Some retention, little lacing. Orange taste makes you pucker. Smooth and drinkable, alcohol hidden well. I never knew what coriander was, but I assume it adds to the flavor here. Nice beer, well worth trying."
"2000 Version.Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is coriander, orange and malt. VERY Smooth. Coriander and orange flavor. Nicely balanced. Creamy smooth sweetness. Very tasty and fruity. Amazingly smooth. Hides the alcohol very well. Nice beer. Ages very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. YUMMY beer."
"Originally sampled on 23 July 2002. The cork was harder to get out than it should have been. That problem aside, this reminded me of a grand cru. Poured w/ a frothy white head, and had a beautiful, complex flavor. It's a hazy golden color, but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is a simple beer. It has some very complex flavors: banana, spices & others. Any serious beer drinker needs to try this one."
"Alesmith is my second most favorite California Brewery, just a tad behind Stone, two find Breweries that are a must visit when in Southern California, which is on my schedule for the fall."
"Fairly thin golden amber. Thin fizzy head needs a rough pour just to exist ephemerally. Aroma is good - coriander, peaches, a bit of pipe smoke - but a bit harsh. Flavor continues with spice, bit of alcoholic heat but edges on cloying with excessive sweetness. It also has an excessive butteriness that adds to the cloyingness. To me, this is just another Alesmith beer that I can't see what the fuss is about."
"Another great beer from Alesmith...not as good as the other ones I've had, but still a winner..."
"Green bottle with foil hiding standard bottle cap is interesting but not very practical. Perhaps green bottle skunked this one but after an extremely impressive outing with Alesmith's IPA and ESB, I found this one a dissapointment. Appears nothing like a true Belgian. Almost clear gold with zero head even after a vigorous pour, and nothing like the mountainness foamy contemporaries coming from Belgium. Gives a wine like fruity fragrance and a creamy smooth mouthfeel which is probably the only outstanding characteristic I found. Sweet and fruity with an almost foul sugar aftertaste. Highly acidic and a noticable presence of alchohol. I was extremely impressed by Alesmiths IPA and ESB but I didn't have a great experience with this little devil."
"Update: I've since had many better BSPA's than this one. While it is still a damn fine brew, it is not deserving of all 5's!"
"Clear orange in color, with scarcely any head at all. The aroma is surprisingly mild, with honey-sweet malt and herbal hops being the stand-out scents. As usual with Alesmith, the flavors are terrifically well-blended with a nice candi-sugar sweetness up front, honey, corriander, and a long-lasting herbal hop finish. Medium-full bodied, though various fruity and spicy flavors make it feel lighter. And wow. Is there really 10% ABV in this? Can't taste it at all. A nice beer, though my sample was a bit under-carbonated."
"Thin off white head. Hazy amber hue. Honey like sweetness, musty yeast w/ notes of licorice and ripe pear fruitiness. Subtle spiby hop nose. Surge of sweetness hits the palate initially, then yields to lightly citric fruitiness, black pepper - like alcohol and mild clove phenol. Light hop bitterness leaves the overall profile sweet. Moderate to full bodied, w/ a sugary thick mouthfeel. Finishes sweet and lightly phenolic. Horny Devil is a unique brew and epitomizes the hazy distinction between strong goldens and tripels. Although a touch too sweet for good dinkability, it made an excellent nightcap. Big thanks to Murph for sharing the bottle."
"I have another Bottle of this, the reverse of the bottle recommends that it improves with age for another 6 to 24 months. I donÂ’t know if I can wait that long though."
"Like many of Alesmith's high abv selections, it comes in a champagne style bottle wrapped with foil.  It's golden-orange with a minimal white head and little carbonation.  The smell and taste are subtle fruit with some spice and a generous dose of alcohol.  I dedect a bit of apricot.  Perhaps because of the low carbonation level, it seems to lack a bit of body.  Alesmith does it right again."
"Notes: What effort put into this ale, richly complex with such a lush and complex character. Big on sweetness but the other attributes of this brew hold up strong to keep it in check. Other than the head lacking, perhaps from the carbonation being a tad low, this beer is near perfection."
