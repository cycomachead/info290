"Very smooth with a full flavor and texture."

"I'm just not a fan of Belgiums"

"Very well crafted. Delicate and smooth. This beer isn't hiding anything, it's all up front on the nose/palate. Might be my new ""go to"" for the spring season."

"Pours a hazy amber color with a 1-2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild but decent, as is lacing.  Aroma of Brett, Brett and more Brett.  There is a mild coriander aroma with some hints of citrus.  Nice spicy, hoppy burst that smooths out to a strong Belgian yeast taste.  Mild astringent coriander aftertaste.  Very good beer.  Very impressed."

"I only have a small amount of Belgian beer experience and my last one was maybe a year ago. But Matilda is excellent for a newbie. No way that person would always avoid Belgian beer, so his/her opinion would improve. A great starter for this variety."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dry with mostly belgian malt grain on the tongue, with some orange and spice following up.  Finishes like a brut champagne.  Funky tart smell."

""

""
""
"On tap at frontera ORD. Poured into goblet. Carmel color with half a finger of almond head that quickly dissipated but left solid lacing. Bananna, malt, yeast aromas. Up front spices, yeast, and funkier than I expected. Finishes with a little apricot sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer."

"Taste is very good, rivaling some of the better Belgian versions. Strong yeast and spicy profile, some light fruit.  Tart, a little funky and mildly sweet  at the same time.Mouthfeel is rich, tart and very nicly carbonated.  This beer is a winner and one that I will enjoy again."
"2012 bottle. It says on the label the beer develops for 5 years. Mine was pretty funky smelling and tasting. Inrteresting but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A really good beer!!  If I come across this again I will definitely drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not what i was expecting. The beer had a weird after taste"
""
"I wasn't ready for the floral spice taste at first.  But as a got to the end of my pint I started to enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect for when I want a strong Belgian Pale Ale and am in bit of a funky mood. Just enough floral spice to make it interesting."
""

""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
"Awesome flavors. Nice evening beer"
""
"Ok if you like cloves...not my favorite belgian"
""
"Overall: What a fine beer, I don't get a chance to try this one too often, but I'll take every opportunity to enjoy it I can."
"This was a great beer !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ever changing beer it seems. I will keep buying it because of that. I like it when it has more fruitiness and a slight more tartness. This version wasn't quite there this time. I pair it with almost anything ... A nice butter poached lobster tail with a saffron rissoto would be excellent. I give it a 90/100."
""
""

"Very Bitter - taste is almost watered down."

"Comes out of the tap a beautiful clear golden with a thick, fine-bubbled, pale cream head. Fruity aroma has notes of banana, pear and tangerine plus a subtle malty tone. Rich & fruity flavor delights the taste buds with banana and pear notes plus hints of tangerine and butterscotch. Texture has firm body and plenty of fizz. Waltz with this Matilda!"

"Another amazing beer from Goose Island. This is my sip for the evening while watching World Junior hockey and it is fitting. Chicago is a great sports city and this beer brings a lovely international character. The orange-gold color, steady carbonation and lively mouthfeel are are wonderful combination. Matilda has an alluring scent - yeasty citrus - that pulls you in. The breadth of the flavors are difficult to describe and the final product is truly wonderful. From packaging to pour to finish, this is a special occasion beer."
""
""
""
"amazing smell taste and body"
""
""
""
""
"I had this beer on tap and I got lots of bubblegum and strawberry on both the flavor and aroma. It was kind of over powering. I am surprised that this beer clocks in at 7% its pretty light in body. The initial sip was the only sip where i got more of the Belgium yeast flavors and candy sugar sweetness."
"Overall- An outstanding BSPA. Very smooth and showcases the Belgian yeast character quite nicely. The complexity of the citrus/yeast/malt/hop qualities make this a fine beer. If I am able to save one, it would be a great beer to cellar a few years."
""
""
""

"Great lighter beer. A little on the sweet side for my fast but very balanced none the less."

"Floral nose. You can smell the yeasts. Taste is dominated by alcohol and I'm searching the brettanomyces. Not bad but I need to try one with a couple of months of aging"
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.07, an A-. Goose Island's Matilda is an interesting strong Belgian pale ale, but in my opinion it doesn't compare with the real titans of this style - and having had two bottles of this from different vintages, I feel pretty comfortable stating that. The Brettanomyces provides a unique  background tartness, and overall I must say that I do really enjoy this beer - but it's still no Duvel or Don de Dieu. Pretty good stuff; there's no doubt in my mind that I'll be drinking this again at some point."
""
""

"Fruity with a touch of tartness. Semi-dry finish."

"Overall, the Brett really showed up on the aroma here and continued to add a nice complex tropical/ floral character along with some background yeasty barnyard funk. I thought it worked really well. Deliciously drinkable, has acquired some heftier brett flavours and a thick mouthfeel, will look to see what more age does to this. Lovely beer."

"I just recently found out about the Goose Island Sisters and after having this one I'm elated to try the rest. The taste was crisp, fruitful, and the dry finish was what made this so memorable."

"I must have enjoyed this more before.  This glass was fine, the carbonation not as absent as it looked initially.  However, there was nothing in this to excite me.  A well-made, decent beer, though."

"Interesting how much this beer attenuated. Funky since the beginning with its complexity getting revealed in little by little. Liked the fact that just not focus on tartness, hops are decently present. It has a balance that is hard to see in the style, at least looking with modern eyes."

"Just had my 1e and 2e Matilda at the Hyatt in Chicago. Great taste, nice after taste. Needed to convince the barman to serve it somewhat warmer. 5 degrees celsius is too cold for this beer. But pour is in a cognac glas and wait some time and magic happens."
""
""
""
"O 4 - better than I remember. It drinks so smoothly and easily. I might have to buy this more than once every 5 years. Best brett beer I've had, as I'm usually not a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an autumn orange color with a short off white head that lasts for a few minutes before evaporating. Smells of wheat, yeast, barley, sandalwood, citrus peels. Has a very mild, dry, woody taste, very mellow with a hint on the sweet side. It's medium bodied with ample amounts of carbonation.  Overall, this is an excellent belgian pale ale, probably one of the best I've ever had. Better still, I got this for peanuts at Costco, further raising my adoration of this beer."

"Overflowed like a beast when I cracked the top on this 2013 vintage. Poured a golden amber (dazzling in the light), with a finger of head that was slow to dissipate. Great visible carbonation. This had a big, bright nose with lots of yeasty funk, some alcohol, clove/spice, and a hint of breadiness. Nice and complex, changed with time. This was such a nice, balanced sipper. Funk was a lot more mellow on the palate than the nose, hearty/bready notes, and some clean bitterness. Medium bodied, clean and clear presentation, and the notes that did linger were pleasant ones. I know that this is a Belgian 'Strong' Pale Ale, but for all of those breweries advertising 'Belgian IPA', this is what you should be chasing in my opinion. Pretty damn impressed with this $7 750ml..."

"A totally unremarkable brew I won't pick up again. Sofie is a better option."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: tastes of citrus peels, flowery perfume, yeasty spice... a meatier, more Rubenesque, more Saison-influenced interpretation of Orval... an elegant brew - to be enjoyed countryside"
""

"765 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. An orange amber color with four fingers of light beige creamy foam. Aroma is decidedly vinous, citric, and fruity: White grapes, pears, lemon and orange rinds, wine gums, with a little dough and an initially unassuming but slow burning brettanomyces funk. On the palate this one is dry, far less sweet than the nose might suggest, with a well-developed burlap sack/horse blanket flavor front and center, more pears and other under-ripe semi-sour orchard fruits (apples, apricots), watermelon rind, quinine bark (think tonic water), faint bubble gum, green banana ... A pleasant moderate phenol spice coupled with sour fruits and rather minimal sweetness, although the latter does develop over time. Fairly smooth, drinkable, low to moderate body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish. Provides an interesting comparison to its stablemate Sofie ... More dry and tannic, less sweet and fruity. Stronger and perhaps more rustic. Excellent work, although I may swing toward the slightly sweeter."
""

""

"Hazy amber with some suspended sediment and a small, off-white head that reduces to a sticky covering.  Yeasty, slightly tart aroma featuring some spice, dried fruit, apple, and floral notes over a light pale malt base.  Smooth flavor of phenolic clove, apple, light bubblegum, and honey.  Medium bodied and lightly dry giving it some crispness.  A convincingly authentic Belgian-style beer with lots of yeast and only a touch of musty funkiness for fun."
"Overall - Another lovely offering from Goose Island. This Belgian Style pale ale features a cohesive blend of flavours. Look forward to seeing more of their offerings in Alberta in the near future."

"Best of all goose island beers IMO ,dried apricot ,spice, fantastic carbonation .3 thumbs up !"

"This was a good one. Oddly, I took the first sip and thought to myself ""this is too sweet and chalky."" Then the second and third sips rolled around and somehow the hops started going to work and calmed down the intense malty yeast profile this beer carries. Definitely good, very rich beer. While there was a lot of sediment visible, it was very smooth. Had no trouble finishing the 765ml bottle."

"Overall - very nice Belgian strong pale; I really dig the unfiltered appearance of this ale!"

"Had on tap at O'Hare airport out of a wine glass. It poured a pretty auburn-orange, really nice appearance. The nose had notes of nuts, spices, and yeast. The flavor was similar, but stronger than the nose let on. Not usually a huge Goose Island guy, but this is a good one."
""
""
""
""
"O: a bit disappointed with this one. With the reputation goose island's rare and mainstream beers has. I was hoping the less popular would still be really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good but very overrated beer by a brewery that is steadily on the decline. If not for their admittedly magnificent Bourbon County series, Goose Island would be a second or even third tier brewery. I question whether the current batches of this beer are faithful to the ones in the past, which I remember being much fuller in flavor and more fully realized overall than what I have tried, on several occasions, of late."

"After hearing nothing but great things about this beer online, where I work, and on BeerAdvocate, I'm thoroughly disappointing Goose Island's Matilda, a beer that clearly looks to cater to those not so invested with Goose Island's more mainstream line. While the beer presents itself nicely in look and smell, the taste and mouthfeel leave something to be desired. The immediate taste isn't bad, effectively presenting an extremely yeasty but potent beer until it descends into a sharp, biting aftertaste that is along the lines of a cheap, high gravity malt liquor (I can equate it to the same kind of pungent taste of high-alcohol I got when swallowing Camo Silver Ice). After a few small to medium sips of this, the taste becomes overcompensating, to the point where the beer's introductory taste isn't even the slightest bit appetizing anymore, and I just sought to finish it as soon as possible. I can't see how this beer merits such exceptional ratings; it's one of the worst beers I've had all year."

"one of the best Belgian Style ales i've had, appearance is a hazy brownish orange, with lots of large bubbles evident in the beer, smell is dark fruit, clove, allspice, and belgian yeast. Taste is plum, banana, yeast, clove, biscuits, and caramel. mouthfeel is a full body, but not overly heavy, carbonation is quite light."

"O - reminds me of a summer beer for sure, refreshing, light, easy drinker, little pricey for a session beer, dont know if I would seek this beer out but if available may purchase again, would like to taste if after some aging to see what changes."
""

"The big bottle with wax. Who doesn't love an event when opening a beer? It pours hazy copper gold with a dense creamy off white head. The smell has a lot going on, wheat, oranges, slight floral hops, biscuity. The taste has slight fruitiness but that biscuit smell is in the flavor as well, the hops show up near the end along with some candi sugar but it is a very balanced flavor. It's like a huge party where no one is wearing bright colors but no one looks the same. Very subtle, very diverse, very nice. The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly tingly. That's the technical terms if you were wondering. Didn't want to frighten anyone off. Overall, this is a great beer. It is many things, none of them overdone, and all of them done right."

"I expected a year to do something to this, but instead there's not too much else to report other than this is like many other farmhouse styled ales I've had domestically, with this containing the notable exception of appearing cleaner and crisper in body than others I've had in the past. It's solid and extremely food friendly (paired excellent with hand patted grilled burgers), and isn't a bad price ($10), but there's honestly other beers of its kind that I'd more often run to get, and especially that goes for those I'd lay down - Orval itself, for instance. Not bad, but I definitely heard better things about this with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite styles, but I'm pretty underwhelmed by this one. Still very drinkable and certainly not a bad flavor, just a little light. Perhaps a bad bottle, I trust the merchant highly on the storage."
""
""
""
""
""
"Second Review: I feel the same about this. Get the big apple flavors, but low sour quality. World class beer though."
""
""
"A 2010, properly cellared bottle poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a thin off-white head that left light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, light stone fruit and mild oxidation. Flavor begins subdued dried light stone fruit, and light caramel, but the caramel intensifies towards the finish revealing bready malt and more intense stone fruit flavors, mildy buttery. Medium bodied. I took brief notes on this when I bought it fresh and they reveal that I was not too impressed with it, finding the flavors pleasant but underwhelming. I have been skeptical about the claim on the bottle that it would age for up to five years. I'm not in doubt now, this has turned out quite nicely. Still somewhat restrained, but the light fruit fruit flavor of the young beer have not so much intensified as become deeper, like dried fruit. Quite enjoyable and I will certainly age this one again if I see it."

"Had at lunch at Harry Caray's; poured into glass from bottle. One of the best beers I've ever had. Hazy orange/copper color, spicy yeast fragrance. 2nd beer as good if not better, I don't get to enjoy this enough it was as expensive as a dram of single malt scotch whisky. A must try."

"Goose Island Matilda, in my opinion, is a world class beer of the highest quality. It pours copper colored, finger sized head, and medium carbonation. It has tastes of hops, malts, and fruits, this is do to the Styrian and Saaz Hops that is used. It has a spicy fragrance, goes down smooth for a Belgian ale, and has pleasant after taste."

"This almost didn't feel like beer since there really any hops noticeable and the same could have been said for the alcohol. I had to pace myself while drinking this and only a slight warming sensation that came over me as I polished this off led me to realize that there was booze in this. While not outstanding ,this was the best and most accessible example of this style that I ever had and worth a go for anyone who has never tried a Belgian-style Pale Ale or Strong Ale before. Not too sweet, funky, or overpowering, Matilda was a beer that I'd grab again as I await the transition to warmer days ahead. Subtly enjoyable and up to par with its European counterparts."

"Drank another one today (02-20-2014) that is dated 08-19-2010. It has a nice dirty flavor and a crazy fruity aroma. Carbonation is off the charts. I'm glad I saved it but it could have been at prime a while ago."

"o - delicious and one i would definitely go to again."

"O - Awesome beer that holds up quite well. I have no doubts that this will age as the bottle says. Willing to put this up against other higher end Belgians. This would be nice on a hot day with a cigar!"

"O- Dangerously drinkable for the style and abv. I'd have this again anytime."
"Lightly effervescent in the mouth. Delicious."
""

"Overall: definitely an interesting beer, the wide variety of flavours throughout are great, but are all kept in tight moderation - it feels restrained, and could be better if there was some part that really burst out."
""
"All in all, a good American Belgian."
""
" O- im not that impressed. would rather have a trappiste rocheforte 6 over this anyday. but a faily decent attempt at the style. which i might add. is not my favorite."

"O: As I said twice, it's interesting. It's good, definitely worth a try, definitely recommended, as are most of their beers."

"Poured a bottle before dinner. First the beer is rich orange. It poured with a little haze that cleared up as it came down in temp. It's a white head with good lacing and active carbonation through the whole beer. The smell is over ripe bananas and some funkiness that's I can't really compare to another smell. Likely the Belgian yeast is driving that smell. The taste is wonderful with a dry apple flavor with sour notes. It's a great Belgian malt and yeast flavor. It's dry in the mouth and the sour lingers in a good way. Overall another good beer from goose island, they never seem to disappoint me!"
"Overall: A very good drinkable beer.  This beer is heavy on the spices, with sweet tropical fruit flavored.  With an ABV of only 7%, the alcohol does tend to protrude through the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: very smooth and drinkable with character you would expect in awa"

"Matilda pours a dark copper color with a large frothy white head. The aromas are very strong lots of spices and candy notes. The taste has strong spice notes, a lot of candy flavorings; sweet and has some yeast flavors. Strong flavors, great carbonation, nice feel. Overall a very bold and tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Pours orange with long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of Belgian yeast, pale malt, banana, apples and herbal hops. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of yeast, biscuit malt, candy sugar, bananas and herbal hops. Finish is long and dry. Nice, complex brew."
""
""
""
"notes: stunningly authentic Belgian Pale. I admire this beer more than I like it. I have 3 more bottles to form a better opinion."
""
""
""
""
"O - I keep dipping my toes into the Belgian yeast pool, and each time the water is just not quite my style. I appreciate all of the qualities of this beer, but the sour funkiness of it is still not to my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As I do not possess actual fancy beer glasses, this was poured into a wine glass per the helpful suggestion on the label (""SERVE IN""). Given that the label design mimics a fancy wine bottle label, this seemed appropriate, even though I know I've already probably broken some important beer rule. It has a very appealing honey amber color and slight foam: it reminds me of unfiltered apple cider, and, at first whiff, offers similar intense fruit. I'd characterize it as concord grape, with a background of mustiness, grass and hella yeast. The concord grapes follow through into the taste of the beer, IMO, though tempered by a refreshing dryness. And if it weren't for that inherent dryness, I'd have to say the lingering sweetness/fruitiness would really lose me, but evidently the brave men and women on Goose Island were one step ahead of my unsophisticated palate. There's also an appealing fizziness at work as a further counterbalance to that potentially cloying fruit. Overall? It's drinkable but hearty, sweet and sweet-tempered but slightly edgy (7% alcohol, oh my!), and definitely earnest, but in a good way."

"Light brown in color with a light head of foam. A bit of nice lacing on the glass. Good clarity. Smell that Belgian yeast strain and a light biscuity malt. You can definitely sense the alcohol,but it is very smooth. The alcohol does not overwhelm. Instead it complements the yeast and malt backbone."

""

"Bottle 2013 vintage. Pours an amber color with a decent head that fades slowly to nice lacing. Aroma of malt, fruits, some pine and spice with bit of caramel. Taste of malt, some caramel sweetness, citrus, with some fruit and spice in the background. Subtle bitterness and the finish is quite dry. Medium body, smooth with a nice bit of malty character. Nicely balanced as the there is no hint of the 7% ABV. Nice beer for the style."
""
"A solid effort yet, there is nothing present here to propel this beer into the realm of 'outstanding'."
""
"Very good beer. The aroma hits you in the face and its followed by an explosion of flavors. It's has a nice spice to it with some hints of clove and banana. It's a very drinkable beer for 7% ABV. The goose island vintage line is excellent. Also recommend trying Sofie and Lolita. My favorite by Goose Island was Fleur but unfortunately they retired it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep orange in color with a 1-finger foamy white head. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of of ...hum...actually different. Maybe some bananas, grains and spice. As for the taste, there is a lot going on here. Very complex actually. After several sips, still trying to figure it out actually. Slight dry finish but not bad at all!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one is pretty close to Duvel in terms of quality, but perhaps not quite there. Who cares?! It's still freaking excellent. I'd really be intrigued in aging this one even further, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A gourmet beer. For only 10 dollars plus on average. Recommend 6 months plus on aging. Will thicken and become more pronounced in taste. Goose Island not only makes standard quality styles, (ESB/IPA/Seasonal) they can craft a huge bottle of Belgian beer worth your cash."

"Overall: I might down the entire 4 pack I bought tonight. This is disappearing from my glass at a surprising pace. Keeper! It'll be hard to cellar if I buy it because I'll just want to keep drinking it."

"O: This brewery has left me disappointed - there staples are mediocre - but this one is a keeper... A wild, funky, unleashed version of Sophie. Not quite as good as the Ommegang products but for an American style Belgian wild ale with Brett - Pretty much best of breed...she's a doll... I heart Matilda!"
""
""
"O -Very good, I like how the level of brett was just right, I've had other beers where the brett had taken over, very enjoyable and better than some other BPAs I've had."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/20/2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, apricot, orange peel, pear, apple, hay, floral, grass, candi sugar, caramel, pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of yeast ester, hop, and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of pineapple, peach, apricot, pear, apple, candi sugar, caramel, grass, floral, light funk, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, apricot, pear, apple, candi sugar, caramel, grass, floral, light funk, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of yeast ester, hop, and malt flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! All around great complexity and balance of yeast ester, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Poured a pale, dark gold, slightly cloudy, with good one finer head with lace patches. Aroma is a little flowery to me for some reason, also picking up some yeast, breadiness, a touch of sweet malts, and some tropical fruits like mango and tangerine. Mouthfeel is fuller thanks to some yeast, not too sharply carbonated but finish is dry and crisp, beer seems to be well-balanced as I get some bitter citric hops, some malty sweetness (caramel, candi sugar) and more of that pleasant tropical fruit rush like tangerine and pineapple (and dragonfruit according to my stepson). Overall just a really enjoyable beer that is representative of the style."
""
""
"Excellent, quenching yet extremely complex Belgian Pale Ale. The style is nailed here. Deservedly a classic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light woody orange-gold colored beer with a modest white head atop. Smells Belgian indeed. Banana bread, spice, citrus, apple, pizza doughy, biscuity, stinky yeast, bubble gum, and in general, juicy. Taste is nicely sweet with banana, lemon, orange, bread dough/pastry dough, candy, more bubble gum, and light caramel. Interesting and pretty good!"

"Pours a slightly hazed amber with offwhite colored, dense head. A few thick rings of lace down the glass. Smell: sugar cookie dough, very mild funk, sticky sweet orange citrus. Taste: sweet, juicy...toffee, orange and ginger, baking spices, under the sweet it's vinous and drying with a mildly spicy hopping. Honestly, this is not a great BSPA, whether Brett'd or not. Let's be clear, for the style it is unrefined and under- everything. But ignoring style, it's really nice. Mini-complex and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was an enjoyable beer. It seems a more flavorful than other offerings, but it is not my favorite version of the style. I would like to drink it again but not out of a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is focused on the malt and citrus element. There is a moderate hopped bitterness bringing up the rear but it does not linger long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a Brett beer, no doubt about it. I wish the BSPA flavors were more prominent. It's good but like most GI beers (that arent in the BCS series) is over rated and not something I would buy again."
"O: refreshing, sophisticated. More like a fine wine experience. A nice dessert beer."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example of the style but I will have to track down a fresh bottle to compare it to because at this point I feel like the brett had really taken over and I think more of those fruity and Belgian Pale ale aspects that I got in the aroma would come through when it's fresh. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention but I think that the Brett would really start to wear on me and I think one 12oz bottle is the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how unbalanced the flavor was, it seems like the brett really took over. I would for sure buy a fresh bottle of this again, but I don't think I would get and aged one and I can't really see this getting any better with more age. I would recommend this to anyone who really likes brett forward beer, but it might be a little too funky for your average craft beer drinker. All in all I was happy i gave this beer a try, I could see this beer being pretty promising fresh, so I will for sure be looking for a fresh bottle and I will update this review accordingly. It's a nice beer but at this point it's a brett bomb. Nice work guys, this Belgian Series is my favorite thing you guys put out, keep on expanding the series."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The color was a deep golden yellow with a orange hue. Not much foam and very little lace on the side of the glass. The smell was of spices, with a hint of sourness. The taste had a sour, spices flavor. Not what I expected from a belgium pale ale. It's an OK pale ale, but, not what I would buy again!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a good and accessible belgian strong ale. Shares some characteristics with Saisons. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A beer as elegant as the label. Everything about it begs for more; an irresistible appearance, nuanced and very well balanced refreshing flavors, great texture. My only complaint is that its taste degrades noticeably as it gets warmer, meaning that if you're looking for a refreshing beer on a hot summer day you better go through it quickly (which you will be all to happy to do)."
""
""
""
""
""
" O – This is an amazingly approachable, clean and drinkable beer, especially since I am not normally a sour beer fan. From the Belgian Pale Ale name I was not expecting the emphasis on Lambic-type characteristics, but this was obviously formulated to emphasize them. I find it to have all the customary components a Belgian sour would, but is lacking in some complexity compared to the originals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A nice Belgian recreation by an American brewery. Combining classic Belgian yeast and biscuity malt character, it also adds in a nicely bitter finish to round out a well balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thus beer is incredibly complex! Aging has done wonders to this beer to meld all of the flavors. The Brett adds another level to the beer with the greatness it adds"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"There’s a light spice note on the aroma with some peppery characters. The flavor is pleasingly zesty, with a touch of that pepper. Light and delicate with more nuance and subtle flavor than I could have asked for. Yum!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well... certainly an interesting beer. I wouldn't drink this regularly, but this is excellent. I can see why people would go nuts for this, and I would definitely like to try it with some age on it to see how the Brett character changes. Highly recommended."
"O - a belgian pale with big sour ale leanings, this thing is a beauty that may not cater to all tastes but definitely got my attention"

"Very nice brew. I haven't had one fresh, so I don't know what four years has done to this brew, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Quite a nice mixture of funkiness and tartness, never leaning too heavily towards one side, though the funk may have the lead by just a nose. If you've had this fresh and didn't like it, I recommend sitting on it for a while."

"First keg I bought on my dual kegerator. Great beer!!! Loved the hints of spice and very refreshing. Lighter than I would have expected with a great after taste. It can pack a punch so dont go slamming them down as quickly as you pour them. I will have to revisit this beer again at some point. I highly recommend it to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quality - GI have done a superb job with this Belgian ale. Could easily pass for the genuine article. It looks sublime, while the aroma and flavour exude tart, fruity notes that possess a classic Belgian character. Light barnyard funk adds depth. Body is pitch-perfect. Well-rounded; to which the age of the bottle probably contributed. Very nice and highly drinkable - definitely worth trying if you come across it."

"This poured hazy and amber with not so much carbonation and just a finger of foam. Good lace. Really fruity and floral nose on this beer. I can smell the pilsner malt and I love that. It’s got a little booze in the nose but I’m not offended. There’s some caramel as it warms, a little spice and a bit of cinnamon. This beer is very rich on the palate. Orangey, Belgian yeast, musty, then pepper and coriander and hop bitter. Really well played like good hand in cards. Malt is pretty sweet and the body is a touch syrupy. This one is pretty wild with complexity but never disintegrates. Nice balance, crisp dry finish and puts bitter and honey together with a brett character and is inviting and intoxicating"

"Matilda is a magical beer. Serendipity is the word I always use to describe my first time trying it. I had no opinions or expectations prior to a friend offering me a sample but I instantly fell in love. True, it doesn't hurt that the recipe is modeled after one of my all-time favourite ales (Orval), but the fact remains that this is a phenomenal and enchanting offering."

"Belgian pale ale refermented with Brett, and a very good rendition at that. Worthy of comparison with the likes of Orval."
""
""
"What a treat! Poured a three finger head into a pint glass, good retention, thick patchy lacing on the glass, orange honey hued colour, beautiful - nose is floral, honey, passion fruit - taste follows with a nice hop backbone - honey, tangerine, passion fruit, bitter orange peel, Belgian yeast - mouth takes the cake, oily and slick, velvet smooth, sweet and dry, slightly prickly, with a lingering aftertaste that is oh so good - hate going over the top but my 4.75 does it no justice - simply a world class brew that holds its own against anything"
""

"(4.25) D: This is a very good belgian style pale ale. The variety of fruits that can be picked out are certainly one of the highlights."

"Overall (4.25), a wonderful beer and while it's not as good as the beer to which it is an homage (Orval) or some of the other Orval-inspired beers being made in the States, it's easy to find and consistently worth buying a bottle from time to time. And if you have the patience to sit on it for a bit, I recommend it, especially if you've had it fresh before."

"Overall: This is a very refreshing Belgian pale ale that makes me think I'm drinking a Hefeweizen at times, and a faintly fruity ale at other times. I didn't have high expectations for this one, but since my old boss ordered and paid for a round of this one, I got it and was very pleased with it. Definitely a great spring/summer beer to have, and not terribly overpriced either. (4)"

"P.S. Also had a 2011 version and it's still nothing compared to the 2010. I highly recommend drinking this with at least 3 years on it. Amazing."
"The Matilda is a mix of amber and cooper, with a bubbling, almost white neck, and hazy body. The aroma exposes very well cloves and honey, and a little spice in the taste. Hop bitterness is present, well harmonized with the malt (of which I expected more expression). The end leaves us with hops, very briefly though. It's a good beer, although too much alcoholic in comparison with its other elements, that are more discrete and delicate. Thumbs up overall."

"Lots of fruity, estery goodness and good yeast complexity. Malt and hops support well, but the yeast is the star. Phenols were a bit offputting."

"(note on lacing: Is it possible that a glass is so clean and waxxy smooth that it doesn't allow for much clinging of the foam, i.e., the foam slides back down into the water and nothing will stick to the glass? I'd swear that was what was happening at the Hay Merchant)"

"20 oz. bottle (date 04/01/11-2149) served in a tulip glass. Pours a fairly clear amber color with a very thin off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel, sweet citrus, slightly spicy, a hint of alcohol, and vinous. Flavor is sweet malts, caramel, peppery, a bit of cinnamon, dark fruits, and yeasty. Mouthfeel is medium, fair amount of carbonation, a little cloying. Decent beer, a bit too sweet for my liking, I suppose the hops have all faded away."

"D: This had a great scent, but only mediocre taste and body. The finish wasn't entirely clean, so it was not the easiest to drink. I'm curious how age would affect it, but it was only average fresh."

"One of the nicer Belgian styles to come from an American brewery. Actually tastes like something from Belgium, had I not known where it was made, I would have guessed Belgium. Has a nice blend of the flavors I expected, all balanced well. I will definitely be drinking more of this."

"O: Really good Belgian strong ale. Solid all around."
"Pours a deep reddish golden color with a decent sized fluffy beige head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Smells of sugary malt with pomme and light pitted fruit and a hint of spice and pepper to round out the nose nicely. The flavor is sugary sweet with hints of honey and light sugar. Heavy fruit flavors remind me of pear, tangerine and sweet orange. Hints of spice provide the only balance to the sweet malt and fruit flavors. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is a nice Belgian strong, simple straightforward and quite enjoyable."

""
""

"A little more than light bodied, with soft carbonation. Almost feels watery. This is a 2012 bottle, not sure why there should be any issue with lacking flavor. It seemed to have plenty of carbonation when I opened it. I may try this again later, and update the review and scores if needed. Seems to be just average for now."
""

"O: Wow very complex flavors mixed in here with a wonder balance of sweet and tart.... A fantastic beer. At 7% ABV this is a one or two and done.. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, let this one warm up and little and it just gets better and better... Very much worth looking for."

"Poured a cloudy amber. Bottle gushed a bit on opening - it's alive! Tall Belgian style head left some nice lace. Marvelous complex aroma of spices and fruits. Mouth feel was creamy, tangy. Spice notes came through strongly in the flavor. I have a weakness for Belgian style blonde ales, and an automatic suspicion when American brewers claim to make them. For me, Goose Island knocks this one out of the park, and at only 7% ABV, I can have another!"

"After tasting Goose Island's underperforming Sophia, I was not expecting much from their Matilda. But I like to try Belgians of all kinds and so gave this one a try. I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice light smell of hops. It was nicely carbonated but did not have a foaming head that one would expect. The color was of rust. The high point was a distinct sour flavor and sharp aftertaste, both of which make a good beer to pair with food. This could turn into a regular beer."

"O - a real treat."

"O - Overall a nice example from Goose. Would love to compare a properly stored and developed bottle. I imagine the hops would blend a little more and lose some of their sharpness. Usually I love hops as fresh as possible but in this instance I imagine it would improve."
""
""
"Really nice well balanced ale, good body and flavor with a moderate potency. Falls somewhere between a saison and a Belgian pale in character. Very enjoyable, wouldn't pass this up."

"O. Its pretty tasty and true to the style. The bottle was bottled on 3/12/12 and states it can be cellared for up to five years so i'm interested to see how this matures."

"Picked this up in a growler. What a funky, fetid beer. Like moldy lemon peel, pine trees, and wet cork. The smell of wet socks asserted itself right away and wouldn't let go. The foamy head was generous but dissipated quickly. A orangey golden color, and mild malty aftertaste. Would not choose this one again."
""
"Overall - Simply a fantastic belgian. Let us hope AB-InBev does nothing to change the way this beer is made, lest they do the world of craft brewing a great disservice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I had a hard time figuring this brew out. The funk nearly overwhelmed me on the nose (in a bad way) and I also thought the feel was a little weird. Nevertheless, the taste was decently complex and despite its shortcomings, I liked this beer. I am especially curious to see how it holds up with some time in the cellar since it says you can age for up to five years."

"Pours a beautiful copper with very small head. Smells of sour peach, orange and serious spice. Definitely a heavy sour forefront. Nice spice on the tongue with some pear and orange peel. Bit of a hop bite. Flavor not as strong as I was hoping. Could use a little more fruit flavor to go along with the other nice spicy notes, which was disappointing as everything else about it is superb. Refreshing beer."

"Overall: A good beer but not the best you will see out there. You take in mind when reading what i wrote, the brew I am drinking is a little over a year old and not sure if its is one of those BPAs that is meant to be ""aged"".

"Really wasn't impressed by this highly rated beer. Expected more considering the price of the four pack. Drank it in a champagne glass like the bottle states, but that didn't really help its cause. Dark red to light brown color, and very clear. Next to no head at all. The after taste was distinct, but very unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bursting with fruits, yeast. Taste is good, fruity, malts, yeast, very rich. Feels full bodied in the moth and overall is a top quality beer worth seeking out."
"O: First beer from Goose Island and extremely satisfied. Perfect beer for the cooler months to help warm up while sipping."

"Super nice. This is the smoothest Belgian I have ever tasted. Nice orange color. not as strong as many belgians, but that may be agood thing for this beer. Granted, Belgian isn't my favorite style, but I do appreciate 90% of them. THis beer had a very nice floral smell and taste with a great sweetness balance. Not sure what the matilda name is about. Matilda reminds me of a bruiser; theis beer is a delicate flower."

"pour is somewhat transparent copper with a light tan head and some larger bubbles. Nose has a strong malt base, lightly toasted nut and crystal malt, with golden fruits, pear and peaches, behind. Taste is the same with a bit of candied fruit, not sugary, some peppery spice in the finish on a lighter body and crisp finish with moderate carbonation."
""
"Quality spice balanced with fruity (apple/pineapple) malt. Definite ""funk"" from yeast but very smooth and flavorful as it finishes. Very drinkable, especially considering its 7% punch. I would get it again. Tasted from bottle. Remarkably smooth as I worked through the bottle and the temperature was not what it was fresh out of the refrigerator."

"The fruit sweetness and the relatively unwieldy mouth feel threw me off at first and it seemed cloying. But I will admit that this beer is a fine one having delineated its various components. The strong pear notes up front are to be appreciated and the esthery gummy sweetness is a purposeful counterpoint to its inherent astringency. Ultimately, this beer finished smooth after a thoughtful, diverse rollercoaster of Belgian flavors and textures. Bet it's better on tap, though. Maybe even spectacular."
""
"Hyper fizzy head on about a finger, off-white with an orange tint, all tiny bubbles which boil off at a sprint, retains a decent surface covering, the lacing at first leaves wide splotches but they don’t really stick much. Gauzy orange rust color, closer to yellow than to brown or red,strong whirlwind of loose bubbles zip about within, holds the light well within it, stays bright. This is a yeast dominated nose with banana, bubblegum, clove and sweet unbaked pie dough, also has a large black pepper component, truly not that funky, the peach, pear, fig scents clean and fresh, touch of coal tar or black tea leaf, ends with spiced orange peel notes. Full-bodied, at once bottom heavy and soaking into the palate while the churning carbonation lifts it into a decent perfume. Has a salty, saline quality to go with the pepper and clove, here more like a mix of fennel and Darjeeling tea. The orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus plays a major role, more sweet than sour. Supplements the apricot, pear, fit, banana fruit and sweetens further. The dough has a mildly more baked quality, not raw dough. Creamy texture extends finish and keeps it clinging to the mouth pores. Does a very admirable job of providing subtle complexity which would not turn off the neophyte while impressing the experienced."

"Pours a pretty clean, deep orange. Decent head, bubbly. Smell is a little yeasty and sort of fruity. Taste is remarkably clean - a little apple and a little citrus, but it works. Vague hop bitterness to keep the balance. Smooth, oily feel makes it all the more easy to drink. It's not a beer that will blow your mind, but it's remarkably drinkable."
"O- Scratches the belgian itch, and brewed here in the good ol' USA. AB-Inbev owned or not, good stuff."
""
""
"Pours very nice with a desert orange color, the smell reminds me of apples and fruit that are almost over ripe. The taste is smooth and has a apple and spice taste that is a little funky but enjoyable. As the beer warms slightly in the glass the aroma changes to more of a earthy note. It is a drinkable beer not too overpowering either way."
""
""
"Pours a medium copper color with a slight foamy head. Smell is sweet & slightly hoppy. Taste is sweet as well with a smooth creaminess. I tasted a hint of honey as well. Very easy to drink considering the 7.00% ABV. Perfect medium-bodied brew. Paired well with a monte cristo sandwich."

"Pours an orange color that is somewhat hazy. Nice 2 finger head that leaves some retention. Smells of yeast, funk, lemon, and banana bread. Pretty sweet smelling. Taste still has some hops to it. Fruits and yeast also compliment the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is pretty complex and very enjoyable."

"O - A nice light enjoyable Belgian pale ale. Not as flavorful and complex as some other examples, but very solid. Would pair beautifully with salmon or a good steak."

""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is similar to the scent beginning with sweet Belgian candy sugar and finishes with the funky mustiness balanced with a spicy finish. Altogether everything is very well balanced with everything kept in check. No one character overtakes another. Medium bodied, but lacks a bit of the voluminous carbonation you would expect from a Belgian styled ale."
"O: Amazing what a little brett does. I can't say I love it, but this is intriguing, clearly well made and goes down easy."

"Overall: Wow. I will single handedly name this beer a testament to how my palate has changed over the past 6 months - I could not stand this beer. It was ok at best. Now, I really enjoy it. Really cool stuff, and this was a satisfying to drink if for nothing else than to appreciate my growth as a beer advocate. I'll definitely get again, albeit probably on tap."
""
""
"Goose Island is fairly new here to PA, but each time I drink one of their beers I get more impressed, and this one was no different. My first go around with this beer was not nearly as fantastic as this time. Just a wonderful beer that is available all the time...nice!"
""
""
"The beer pours an orange yellow like dehydrated piss with an ever so slight touch of blood. The head is big and soapy with a nice slightly-cream white head and nice sticky fat lacing on the sides creating cloud rings on the glass. The beer is mildly hazy, but is still quite opaque and there are a lot of nice little bubbles dancing up to the top of the glass. The beer smells thick with bananay yeast that makes me think of the jungle. There are some nice slight spices on the sides of the smell, perhaps a hint of cloves and something even more zesty. The malt is also not hiding in this smell, with a nice pale-sweet malt waftings. The beer tastes very similarly to its smell, with a great forward banana-taste from the yeast with slight clove and zest on the sides of and a solid sweet pale malt backing to the beer. There is almost a hot spice tingle on the tongue’s tip to start off this beer which is very intriguing. The mouth feel is smooth and lightly marbled. A perfect consistency for a pale ale. There is some weirdly harsh carbonation right at the front of the sip, but this dies away almost immediately and just leaves a slightly burnt feel on the tongue. After taste is very subtle and fresh with a faint weird medicinal funk, though this does not standout strongly. The mouth is left very clean after the sip with minimal saliva or dryness outside of the affects of the carbonation. There is very little sign of hops in this beer, which is fine in a Belgian Pale Ale, and this beer definitely delivers for its style. It is deliciously banana-like and its lacing is fantastically thick. Worth a drink for the Belgian lovers and the beer lovers alike, and definitely an upper level example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour yeasty bite up front followed by a creamy mouth-feel with a rich malt character. Nice play between sour yeast and sweet malt backed by fruity undertones. A very rich and complex brew."
""
"This BSPA is awesome. It's a style that fails me more often than wows me. This one's right up my alley. Really, I love the drinkability that you don't get in a Duvel or a Pranqster. The funkiness is a plus, and the yeast isn't pushing all sorts of usual suspects at me. Different and excellent. Now, to just get my hands on more..."
"Overall. Not really my style, but I did like this one. Seems well made."
""
""
"O-not as easy of a drinking beer that I was hoping. It definitely doesn't taste anything like a true Belgian and its much too syrupy and boozy for the low abv"

"D - Nice overall, but not great. I enjoy it enough, but I bought a whole four pack, and they aren't being consumed quickly. Something about the beer just doesn't do it for me."
"O: Easily my favorite Belgian from GI. Combines big yeast and malt character to produce a masterful ale."
"Overall, one of the better beers I've had from a bottle recently, great mixture of the desired flavors and not an ounce of the abv presence. great beer."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and hides the alcohol well. I enjoy a beer with brett and some sour/funk, this beer satisfies that for me but might not appeal to everyone. I would be happy to have this one another time."

"The mouthfeel is pretty dry, as you might expect a Brettanomyces-infected beer would be. There's still a bit of body left. Overall, this is a pretty nice little American Wild Ale. It's not super complex, because it wasn't crafted to be. This just happens to be a tasty accident (that I wouldn't mind seeing intentionally recreated). And the recall of these infected batches led to the creation of the pretty awesome Dominique (and if you didn't get a chance to try Dominique, I'm sorry). If you have been sitting on any bottles of Brett'd Matilda, know that they are drinking pretty nicely right now, two years later."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice. The carbonation level makes this an easy drinking beer. Overall, it's outstanding, and I wish I had more in the cellar."
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with hints of ruby. Head was neglible even with a moderately vigorous pour, though plenty of carbonation bubbles meander throughout the glass. Aroma is of sour cherry, bret yeast, and coriander. This bottle is dated over a year ago, and the flavor profile is different than what I normally think of for Matilda. The elements that were so evident in the aroma are present, but greatly tamed. Sourness is nearly non-existant, leaving the yeast and spice to take over the front end, though neither is especially dominant. A healthy dose of wheat comes in on the back end, along with some trace bitterness and some grassiness. A hint of alcohol makes its presence felt as well, but nothing glaring for a 7% ABV. Maybe it's the aging, or maybe I need to let it warm up some, but this is much more subdued than I remember. It's very drinkable, but it doesn't quite have the pep that I look for from a Belgian style ale."
"It does seem to be well crafted however so if pale ales are your thing or your looking to try one for the first time then this is probably one to check out."
""
"O: A very pleasant, well balanced and thoroughly quaffable brew. Fits the style well and worth a buy."
""
""
"Notes: Really well done BSPA. Reminds me a lot of a country orchard (fruit, must, hay/grass). Sweetness is a strong suit, but the tart/funk is well integrated with the maltiness. Yeast and spices are there but not that strong, especially for the style."

"O: This beer was excellent after a year and five months of age on it. Would love to try fresh to compare, definitely would buy again "
""
"O: the complexity in this one is definitely on the higher side IMO. i find that the kick of hops actually offsets the balance. I feel that this beer is in battle between the hoppy bitterness and sweetness created from the honey character at the end. Overall, a pretty nice beer and definitely worth trying."

"Tasting at World Wine & Liquor in mentor, Ohio. Poured into a 4oz. plastic cup. Hazy orange body, white head. Aroma of apples & pears, subtle fruity notes. Alcohol, sweet malts. Flavor has lots of raisins and wine like taste. Some grapes with fruity spicey yeast. Light to Medium mouthfeel. Long sweet aftertaste. These Belgian styles are not the best versions, but are still pretty tasty."

""
"Overall, a really nice brett pale with some light, well integrated funk. I would really like to see how this evolves over a couple years and the funk becomes more integral to the beer. Still, a pleasant and refreshing beer while fresh."

"Overall, a very enjoyable and well crafted beer. A great one if you're looking to get a BMC drinker into craft to show the possibilities of spices in beer."
"A very pleasent, light sipper. I absolutely love the complexity of the taste, and especially the restrained sourness/funk/tartness. The bretanomyces was used very admirably here. The bottle is about a year old, so I'm wondering how much that this effects the flavor, or if its just released with some age on it..."

"At the O’Hare pub at terminal ""C" this Belgian ale shows a beautiful copperish-amber color with a delicate white cap and decent lacing. The aroma is classic Belgian clove blended nicely with floral hops and a touch of nutty biscuit. Very nice. The flavor brings banana-clove and more nutty biscuit and flowery-citrus. Just a wisp of alcohol and wheat. Medium body with a somewhat viscous, but spritzy feel with tiny carbonation. This is a very enjoyable brew with plenty of hutzpah!"
"a fantastic american made belgian ale. pours hazy copper colored with a lively 2 inch head. smells a lot like a sour, with a funky sort of belgian yeast. flavor features the yeast and all kinds of balanced other flavors. its fruity, malty, and refreshing all at once. the feel is perfectly approproate as well. highly carbonated and just medium on the body makes this beer very easy drinking despite its complexity and depth. the finish is quick and only the gentle but distinct yeast notes remain on the tongue. i was really surprised by how much i liked this beer, and im eagerly looking forward to my next. superb"

"Poured from a bottle and served in a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazy, amber-brown coloring with a thin, white ring of film on the surface of the brew. Aromas of roasted grains, tangy sweet caramel, honey, and subtle spicing of clove and ginger. Flavors are sharp, with a roasted malt backbone and clove spicing that give rise to subtle ginger and cinnamon spicing as the beer goes over the palate. Some fruit sweet characters come through as well, with pineapple, plum, and melon in the forefront. The aftertaste is more tangy sweet than anything else, with a light, crisp finish. The body is slick and sharp, with an increased astringency that keeps the palate clean. Interesting."

"Overall...this beer has an appropriate glass on the bottle. This is fun to sip, and smell, and look at. A real nice blend of flavors that remind me of so many other styles. I can't begin to describe it and do it justice, but I can say its a fine brew."
"On tap. Pours a semi hazy dark amber with 2 inches of frothy head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of apple, grapes, yeast and orange peel. Crisp and smooth. Taste mirrors the aromas. Grapes, apple, and yeast. The aroma was alot stronger than the taste. I thought it would be more harsh than it was. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, very drinkable and worth having again."

"M/O - Medium body that is carbonated very well. Possibly a little light for the style. The flavors are light and balanced incredibly well. The brett does a great job mellowing out this beer and giving it extra depth. One of my favorite goose island beers for sure."

"Pours a nice cloudy tangerine with a short-lived finger of head. Good lacing. Plenty of esters in the nose. Some soft fruits too - apples, white grapes, I don’t detect much coming off the malts. It tastes rather refreshing. Similar to other BPA’s that I’ve had without a very aggressive yeast presence. Nice and floral. I’m struggling to dissect this one. It’s quite good, though."

"Great beer, and glad to have them out here (finally!)"

"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head with decent retention. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow brown color. It smells mildly of malt and dried fruit. Taste mirrors the smell and is genuinely true to Belgian style with Belgian sugar, caramel, tropical and citrus fruit. Medium length finish. Pretty darn nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Follows the smell pretty well. Subtle notes of citrus and earthiness with a slight creaminess lended to it from the yeast. Overall pretty nice."
""
""
"Too bad there seem to be some consistency issues with this one. At least my bottle was probably the best Belgian pale ale I have ever had."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): At about four and a half months old, this beer is relatively young but still manages to showcase a mild brett character that’s extremely well-crafted, in my opinion. Having had this at various stages, I can say that it will really come into its own around a year to a year and a half, and beyond that the brett will completely take over after a while. Which, if that’s your thing, then cool. If you’re interested in brett but a little scared of it, try this beer fresh-ish, like within six months after bottling. And if you’re somewhere in between, a year to a year and a half is perfect—at that point, it becomes a truly exceptional brett BPA."
"D - A good beer but not a session."

"Had this on tap at Three Monkeys on 54th street. Nice tap selection and after choosing something else initially, I spotted this and changed my mind. I wasn't familiar with Matilda (and didn't look it up), so when it was served, I took one sniff and said ""nice, an American Wild Ale, my favorite"". I passed it around and explained to the folks I was with what a wild ale is. Then I came to review it. Belgian Strong? Bottles infected? Maybe a keg or two as well...For a Wild Ale, it's actually spectacular. Had a great funky smell, but not overpowering. Some nice citrus and pineapple notes. A unique creaminess that combined nicely with the tartness. I ended up drinking three of these I was enjoying it so much. For a Belgian Strong, I'm not sure it even fits the profile, but again, the infected issue is what I'm suspecting."
""
"O - It’s not even a year old and its already showing a some funky brett notes. I think I’d prefer this beer fresher, but its still tasty and refreshi"
"haas on tap at the goose island pub in ohare. arrived in goose island wine glass stemware. nice murky brownish orange with some visible carbonation. decent strimgy lacing on the glass as I sipped it down, but the pour yeilded minimum head. smells of belgian yeast and candy. taste is much of the same this is a VERY drinkable BSPA and clocking in at 7% I question if this isnt just a BPA. real nice brew that I often forget about, but delicious as I remember it. as I swirled the stemware I could rebuild the head and it had the classic belgian creaminess you'd expect feom something over the pond. nice job and great to see that GI is presereving the beers that put them on the map."

"O - Very nicely balanced flavors and great mouthfeel make this a very enjoyable Belgian pale."
"O - This vintage is drinking really nice right now, and the alcohol is very subtle while the rest of the beer remains complex. The sweetness is excellent, and overall, I really enjoyed this one. Good stuff, Goose!"
""
""
""
"This was an excellent beer. It was refreshing, tasty, and complex. I don't think it stands up to Duvel, but the fruitiness in the flavor makes it quite different and special in its own way. Plus, it's a bit easier on the wallet."

"Another good offering from Goose Island."

"DOA"
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 4/8/2011. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like citrus (orange peel, lemons), yeast, apricots, pears, cloves, and some other sweet spices. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and apple flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has high, but soft carbonation which helps make this brew very easy to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, and it's definitely worth trying."

"On-tap at the Gramercy Tavern, the Matilda was a nice, clean pour, and was free of any funk or infection. But I do find it that is has identity confusion, and does not really present itself as the self-categorized Belgian style. But that's ok."
"Nonetheless, this is quite a fine brew that I'd gladly seek out again at this price point."

"I really liked this gem from Goose Island. This one could easily sneak up on the unsuspecting as it is so easily drinkable at 7% ABV. Outstanding overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The light amount of funk in the taste gives this beer a nice touch. It's not mind blowing by any means, but it's interesting enough to warrant trying. It's well crafted and was worth the 8$ price tag."
""
"I was surprised at how sweet this beer was. It wasn't over the top, but more than what I'm used to and it took a while to adjust. Although I like the sweet for a bit, it ultimately proved too much, as the buttery phenol flavor didn't contrast it enough. Maybe an oak aged version would do better. I enjoyed it, but I think there are better, more drinkable Belgian Strong Pales out there."

"Overall: This is hands down one of my favorite American style belgian beers. Great flavor depth and quite complex"

""
"O: I really enjoyed this. Blurred the line between BSPA and saison, would have scored high in either category. Very good overall."
""
""
""
""
"Plenty of carbonation in this beer, but it's not overly carbonated - it's right down the middle. It has a nice rich medium-full body. It also drinks quite easily, and would pair really well with some funky cheese."
""
""
"Pours a medium gold color, with a slight off white head. Very easy to see through, and good lacing. Smell is Brett, hay, grass, lemon, and some citrus. A little light on the nose for me. Taste is Brett, grass, hay, and some citrus favors. Musty flavor as well. Nice, but more funk is needed. Feel is medium, with a musty aftertaste. Overall, a good beer that falls short on several levels. Cheers."

""
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, but seems a little too strong. The abv seems to overpower the taste, which in itself is pretty decent."

"This poured out as a golden color with a white fluffy head on top. The aromas of Belgian yeast and some grainy malts were on the nose. The taste of the beer to me was like most of the other Belgian Ales I've tried, it was soft and slightly fruity with a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and well carbonated. Overall this brew wasn't too bad but I wouldn't have to go seek it out again I don't think."

"I don't think the barrel being served was unintentionally infected, as the description of this beer mentioned its ""wild"" character. I enjoy lambics and gueuzes immensely, and am not unknown to US ""wild"" ales, but whatever yeast or bacteria they used with this batch really didn't work for me. I'll try a bottle at some point, but otherwise a definite avoid in the future."
""
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint, hazy orange pour, big white head, nice lacing. The aroma is spicy, almost peppery, lemony. Lemony flavor, slight funk, herbal notes, dry finish. The body is light, effervescent. A very easy drinking beer, IMO the beer taste like a saison."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: A beer that has stood the test of time and has a lot of character. I would consider this an entry level sour for those uninitiated, or a complex Belgian ale with subtle wild notes for the connoisseur to contemplate."

"O: Refreshing and delicious, I think this would pair well with a lot of different entrees."

"Dr: A very drinkable beer for the relatively high ABV, but not one I'd come back to at its price point. I'd certainly try it on draught if I found it, but overall it's unremarkable. It might please fans of the style, but should be passed over by those who aren't."
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O: All in all it's a good beer. I've had better BSPAs but this is definitely solid. I'd like a little more pow, with brighter phenolic or hop characteristics. Would personally reach for Duvel or Damnation 99/100."
""
""
""
""
"O: A beer that just doesn't come off as bright, that left me thinking it was mediocre and I was left unimpressed. I was really looking forward to this one, as Goose Island is a brewery I love as they were my ""Aha!"" moment with craft beer... The Belgian flight has ended and it just kept getting worse :-/"

"Pours a clear dark copper with a fluffy off-white head that settles to a thick cap and leaves sheets of lacing. Aromas of spicy coriander, ripe pear, pineapple, caramel, and Belgian yeast dominate. Flavor is similar to the nose, lots of fruit and honey with a heavy yeast profile. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, with a medium body and sharp carbonation. Another excellent Belgian-style ale from Goose Island, I was secretly hoping for an infected bottle but it's quite good as is!"

"(Reviewed 10/31)"
"this is THE best BSPA ive ever had."
"Overall - Wow is this nice. Alcohol is masked, very fruity, flavor heavy, and smooth. Really like all the fruits in this, this has a summer ale feel to it. Very nice, worth a drink for sure."
"O: B+ for me on this one.  Maybe try one fresher and see what the taste difference is like."
"While more than a few purveyors of this particular style choose to do so in exactly this heady sort of manner, it's a bit of an eye opener all the same. Being a beer produced in Amur'ca, I'm coming to appreciate our southern cousins' predilection for emulating the weird, unusual, and just plain wonderful Old World off-road leanings. That is to say, this is good, damned good."
"O - I thought this beer was pretty complex, the yeast has done wonders for another outstanding beer offering from Goose Island Beer Co."
"The body is on the lighter side of medium with a bit of depth to it. While I expect it to be crisp, it's bitingly so, making it as much a sipper as any other of its aspects."
"Overall: Another interesting and tasty take on a Belgian ale from Goose Island. The heavy fruit presence ads a nice touch."
"Poured from the bottle, this beer had a nice one finger thick head that disappeared quickly. The color is orange/amber, and is not completely clear. there are particulates floating, which are just roused yeast. I get lemon on the smell. it taste really good. i get citrus, matly, and just a hint of hops. Overall i would drink this beer on a regular basis. I would like to have a few and cellar them, the bottle does suggest to cellar up to 5 years."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O - For this style, this beer speaks 'Drinkability' to me. Provides that sweet peppery, bready taste up front and then leaves with a smooth creamy fruity taste. Very nice!"
"At one year old this is a stunning beer. I had a glass in the O'Hare airport in July and my memory of it is not quite so positive. It was rougher. This style and brewery are becoming favorites, no matter the ownership."
"Drank half of it and dumped the rest. Will pay closer attention to the selection next time! :0)"
"Pours reddish amber with fizzy bubbly white foam. Settles out slowly. Sweet candy and Belgian yeasts. Light malty taste with dark fruit blend - plums, raisins. Clean finish, virtually no trace of hops or bittering. Fruity taste, nice belgian style ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a huge amount of carbonation. Overall, nothing too impressive. Was hoping for more, and definitely excited when I heard this was available on tap. Interesting to have once, but not worth seeking out again."
"The finish is surprisingly creamy, and more of the banana and juniper rounds out the flavors in the finale."
"Overall, the beer is very drinkable, which is surprising considering its unique taste. It is a very interesting mix of sweet and sour."
"O - Very complex, deep, rich, spicy beer with lots of dark fruits, some Brett character, sweet finish, really enjoyed it... but it is not a Belgian Golden Strong. It is way too dark in color, aroma and flavor is of dark fruits and caramel and not of pears or apples, carbonation is too light, and the finish is too sweet for the style, Belgian Golden Strong finishes dry and has a lighter body. Great beer, just not to style. Had it been categorized as a Belgian Dark Strong, would have had an A."
"O: Not sure whats up with this bottle. Not really what I expected at all. Will give it another try at some point and change the review should I need to."
"D - interesting palate could be too much but is not; smooth, easy, flavorful drink"
"overall, another tasty Belgian style from Goose Island. Lets hope that this keeps up with there corporate takeover."
"O: A nice example of the style, solid and worth revisiting. Will definitely buy it again."
"O: I was pretty shocked by this. Read about the infected batches. As soon as I smelled it I thought mine might be infected, as I've never had an infected beer before. This is another pretty good beer from Goose Island. Hope InBev don't screw them up."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style and carbonation is below average. Overall it was a pretty good beer. The malty flavors were especially nice in it at this point."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer with some nice complexity that makes it worth drinking for a while."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with good carbonation and a food solid head. The smell is lightly spicy with Belgian yeast notes as well as a solid malt presence. The flavor follows suit with a smooth rich Belgian yeast flavor and a nice sweet malt presence. The mouthfeel is full for the style but not over done. Definitely worth a visit."
"This offering from goose island pours a cloudy and hazy orange. The head was really not in play here. Small and only lasted a short while. Scent was of ripened fruit, plums and apricot. Sweet taste, fruity, has a bit of spice and funk. Drinkable. Had this at a beer fest and finally found it again. One of my favorites this summer."
"An intriguing, very fruity Belgian ale. Could use some more carbonation, and a little more complexity to the flavor. But I like it."
"O: Definitely not a strong ale, more like a light Belgian brew. Decent, but nothing worth revisiting."
" Overall I would very much like to have more of this. Very tastey on a hot day."
"it is a nice Belgian ale with all of the expected characteristics but it's nothing special. Draft poured in a snifter style glass. Not much aroma but a good feel on the palate. It had the fruity and spicy flavor as expected but did not get anything 'rare' out of the taste. Good finish."
"O - What a great beer Goose Island has here. A great combination flavors and aromas. Will definitly buy this one again."
"O: I've heard how good this was but have never experienced it for myself. This is the non-sour lover's sour beer..."
"Overall a Refreshing beer."
"Overall-- I shan't be aging my Matilda anymore. Fresh for me from now on."
"O - overall, I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap and very much enjoyed this beer. Also very pleased to be served in proper glassware - kudos to Zen's. The flavor, mouthfeel and aroma were all very good. This is a solid brew. Very wall balanced across the board."
"O - Plenty of flavor despite a nose that is a tad light. I enjoyed this beer more as I got further thruthe bottle, some acclimation perhaps, but likely some warming too. It has more complexity than my first impression indicated but, unfortunately, the overload of clove as well. I'd like to try an aged bottle down the road."
"The beer is hazy and orange, with a light tan head. a decent amount of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma is inviting, offering citrus, Belgian yeast, malt, candied fruit. The flavor has a healthy hop presence, with a nice combo of sweet, candied fruits and Belgian yeast. The feel is medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, a tasty beverage. A bomber is perfect for sharing a couple / few ways. I would have this again."
"The CPJ"
"The taste is very good. Again well put together. Starts malty, then gets a little floral and peppery and finishes smoothly, a little residual sweetness. It rolls over in my mouth elegantly, the slightly elevated carbonation giving of itself to my mouth. A lovely beer."
"Price = $3.25 at The New Beer Distributors (NYC)3"
"Overall I think this is one of the best American Belgian-style beers. Great flavor, balance and depth that almost all Trappist beers have that many others in the style lack. Ive had this on tap and in bottle. I highly recommend this one."
"Overall - Good overall beer, expected a higher ABV from the taste.."
"One of the best American versions of a BSPA that I have had. Should get a bit funkier with age but perfect for now with cheese, fruit and bread."
"While I understand why this had to be recalled I'm glad that some of it made it into the hands of beer nerds and that some of it was re-purposed into another pretty enjoyable beer. Still, I think Goose Island should seriously consider having ""Wild Matilda"" on-tap occasionally as it's quite good."
"Friend of mine is cleaning out his beer fridge and is taking random beers to random get togethers....I was lucky to score a six that contained a 2010 Matilda. Poured the beer into a tulip glass and so far like what I am drinking. The appearance is orangish/copper with white head that is lacing nicely. The smell is typical of Belgium beers...clove and spice. The taste follows suite....not much banana as i would have expected, but nice clove and spice that wasn't tooo overpowering. The mouthfeel is down graded slightly cuz I do taste alcohol. Overall this is a good beer."
"O: solid effort, great mild choice when trying to get familiar with the style"
"I employed a very gentle pour so as not to disturb any lees in the bottle and as such, I got no head nor even any wisps. None. Zero. I did get a deep-amber beer with NE-quality clarity, though. BUPGOO! If they were shooting for Orval, they came pretty close. It had a musty, yeast-driven nose with a lemon/citrusy character. Mouthfeel was thin and it had a slightly tart flavor on the tongue. Finish was dry and musty. I am glad that I did not wait much longer to open it, but it was still a serviceable beer. That said, I'll just have an Orval the next time."
"Pours a russet gold with some nice fluffy white lacing. Strong honry aroma, flowery, orange blossum. Sweet palate, more honey, belgian strong yeast character, no bitterness, a touch of funk. This seems a bit faded in the hop department, mostly sweet and estery. I usually like this beer, but not a fan of it with age on it."
"I've never gotten too far behind the paler Belgians - stuck mostly to the dubbels and quads. That being said, other than La Fin Du Monde this is my favorite Belgian inspired, light colored beer, if that makes sense. Hazy orange with a lot of yeasty gunk at the bottom, with an off-white head. Interesting fruity taste with a hint of belgian funk. Crisp and smooth, the reason I didn't rate it higher is because I have had some variance with quality amongst the different bottles I've had. All told, I'd buy it again. And again..."
"O: Very palatable and masculine profile. Great style for pairing with wild game."
"Pours solid golden with a nice rosy tint to it. Active yeasty carbonation as well. Not much lacing or head to speak of unfortunately. Light spice aroma – orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper. Rounds out with a fair amount of banana. Tastes slightly the same with sweet carmel and apple skin very thin body. The thin body was the downfall in this beer for us"
"I'm not a huge fan of this style (actually, most beers that have lots of overt yeast flavor doesn't usually do it for me), but Matilda is a very nice brew that really comes together well on the palate, though I'm still not sure about where that tomato soup was coming from. It has a lot of flavor, is well-balanced, and certainly very drinkable. This is one that has the potential to grow on me a great deal."
"Matilda pours a hazy orange with a thick head and solid lacing that lingers. Off the smell there’s a mix of hop oil, the sweetness of honey, lemon-y citrus notes, and cloves. The taste offers a plethora of flavors. Up front you get some bittering hops that give way to faint herb notes with hints of apples and fruit. The beer is slightly dry on the finish and hop oils linger but don’t overpower. This beer is very flavorful and has a rich mouth feel. Overall, this beer is crisp and smooth."
"Pours a clean, bright and clear golden amber color with poof of soapy white bubbles, gone quickly except for some spotting. Scent is a wonderful blend of tangerine, funk, dried grain, floral notes, some grapefruit noted along with spice. Taste follows scent but never comes together completely, notes of bubblegum and a lingering sweetness distract from the citrus, floral and funk notes. Bits of grass and spice present itself along with alcohol as it warms. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation at first, dry with some lingering alcohol. A very nice beer a few adustments away from being great."
"Overall: One of the best American interpretations of the style. This is strong-profiled and a great introduction to funkier Belgian styles."
"O: Too odd to recommend, but pretty nice. I MIGHT have another. Slow sipping."
"D: A nice interpretation. A great ambassador of the Midwest, showing strength and restraint simultaneously. Easy drinking, complex but not complicated, a relaxing and thinking man’s beer. Grab the paper, grab the pencil, find the crossword. Oh, and bring this along."
"O- Another nice Belgian style ale from Goose Island. A flavorful beer that packs a lot of sweetness, but has some balance with some bitterness and a little sour quality. Really nice warming feeling with this beer too."
"Overall, the best qualities of this brew are the striking look, creamy mouthfeel, and gently mild flavoring profile. Before the yeasty sediment is swirled into the glass the beer has great translucency, and a soft, full head. This all played into the mouthfeel, which kept things frothy, but light. This theme continued into the taste, where the flavors were present, but relatively muted, especially the brettanomyces. We actually found this quality to be inviting, as the beer doesn’t attempt to overload the senses, but rather gives suggestions of a more calm and relaxing evening."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! An infected batch! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wood, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Based on the aroma on this one I was honestly expecting it to be infected. Upon investigation of the flavor there was no sign of infection to be found. Rather I found a really nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale waiting for me. This one was not complex at all, but this made it very easy to drink and a nice palate change-up for the night. Still want to try an actual infected bottle to see how it compares though."
"No problems finishing the whole bottle in a short amount of time."
"This beer is readily available. You can get it at pretty much any liquor store (sold in 4-packs if I do recall correctly) or by the bottle at places like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes… who likes a good tasting beer. It doesn’t taste like beer, and truly does get better with age. You can cellar this beer for up to two years and still get all those same notes that you pick up right off the shelf. Big fan of Goose Island and a HUGE fan of this beer."
"Final thought - decent price $3 a bottle, nice ABV at 7% and tastes great"
"There's some good things happening here, and while I'm not exactly excited about it, I'll be able to finish the bottle (a few of the categories have been gradually getting revised to lower scores as I get deeper, if that says anything). I want a lot more from a BSPA. This beer is a miss."
"D- A bit one dimensional for me. Its certainly tasty and thirst quenching and i would say an excellent accompaniement to food which make bring out more flavours. I felt the brett qualities over-powered not letting any fruity/spicy esters to get through."
"O - I tried a Sophie and loved it so my next choice was Matilda. She is the less attractive sister to Sophie."
"I had this on tap tonight at my local establishment. I was rather disappointed and could not even finish the glass. It was served in a nice glass, and the bartender stated that it usually goes for $9 a glass. Tonight was half off all tap beers and I was getting a deal. I found this to have a slight undertone of peach... but after that, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It tasted like the smell of a dirty diaper to me. As I leave near Chicago, I have an affinity towards Goose Island. This one, is for the birds. Never again. Terrible mouth taste. Like I said, dirty diaper."
"O: If this were presented to me in a 750 ml bottle with a Jolly Pumpkin label on it, I wouldn't think to question it. Infected Matilda has that same quiet complexity. "
"O: A decent Belgian style ale, but nothing special. The flavors are strong-ish, but don't blend well together. Very similar flavor profile to some of Ommegang's offerings. A solid B rated brew."
"Overall: Actually I enjoyed this one much more than I thought I would going into it. Usually, Belgian pales are generally a tad too weak when it comes to stimulating my taste buds, but this one put up quite the fight. My compliments to Goose Island. Worth a try, but I probably wouldn't recommend going out of your way to seek it out. A few more tweaks and I'd put it in the same category as the Duvel and Delirium Tremens."
"O: Decent BPA but honestly nothing special. The strong raisin flavor detracted for me since I'm not a fan of that particular smell/taste."
"Medium to high carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Very easy to drink."
"Bottle date is 02/18/10, so this has lasted well. Better than I remember from last year."
"Medium bodied that's slightly creamy with a good balance f light fruit, pale malt, alcohol, spice, yeast and citrus fruit. Hints of pepper and clove up front countered by subtle earthy hops as well as some orange and lemon peel. Clean and crisp with a slight dry finish. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"This is a pretty beer, pours a very hazy deep burnt orange wrestling between brown and red. Beautiful head with excellent retention, big bubbles all over. Lots of citrus on the nose, smells like a freshly peeled tangerine, with a moderate sweet malt that balances out the citrus and makes for a nice blend. Bittering hops are found floating all around the scent, this is a real treat on the nose. Nice citrus on the tongue, mixed an array of spices, clove, orange peel, pear juice, and pineapple all seem to fly past my tongue idividually and the malts seem to just melt in your mouth. Light to medium bodied, bittering hops and spice leave the mouth craving the next sip. This beer was very hard to put down, it was super delicious. My only regret is that I only bought one bottle, buying a 4pack tomorrow for sure."
"O. I've had better BPAs for sure, both imported and home grown. If this bottle is typical I won't be buying it again but I'd be willing to give it a second chance."
"O - I am fully aware that this beer isn't supposed to be sour, but why not? I actually enjoyed this one for what it is. The pucker is strong, and the finish is bone dry, but it still hit the spot."
"OA - A very good offering.  I have only had out of bottle before and did enjoy that.  At $10 a 12 oz pour I am not having as many as I would like."
"overall: an extremely excellent offering by goose island. this proves to be an excellent summer time beer. a lot more body and flavor than typically would be expected from something that feels so light."
"pours dark orange with a beige head. Head retention is great and held on till the end. The smell was nice and fruity with some orange smell taking over. The taste had a nice spiciness at the beginning which gave way to a sweet orange taste with maybe some honey or sugars that finally faded to a hop bitterness in the finish. Very little carbonation with a dry finish. This brew was amazing, It blew my tits off. I was a little reluctant to try it because the packaging looked a little frou frou, much like a wine bottle. But it truly amazed me, definitively a warm weather brew with its light and fruity body it wont make you feel like you drank a brick on a hot day."
"O/D - Very nice brew here. The Brett is nicely balanced with the fruity sweetness and hop bitterness. I would like a bit more carbonation but it still worked with the light flavors. Great refreshing warm weather brew. I would definitely drink this again."
"O: really like this beer! Very nice"
"The more I drink of this, the smoother it gets, which is possibly dangerous given the 7% ABV on the bottle. Definitely something to watch out for."
"Overall, this beer was okay to me, but I wish the funk and sourness were much more prominent than they were. I'm guessing that some time in a cellar would help that, but I'll have to check back and find out for sure."
"Appears a brilliant orange with a 3/4 inch yellowish white head. Leaves a little bit of lacing. Smell yeasty with spice, banana, cloves, and some funk. A honey aroma presents itself as it warms. Yeasty taste up front, along with cloves and crisp fruit. The same honey character shows up to balance things out after the beer warmed up a bit more. Relatively low carbonation. Extremely smooth, easy going beer that is stronger than it seems. Not quite an amazing BSPA, but a great interpretation of the style."
"Im wondering whatthis beer is like fresh. It is very much like orval, funky, not sour, but without the hops. I liked this beer very much as is, but it needed something more to push it to greatness. A sour version or a bitter version could be really cool. Basically, it was a brett showcase."
"Not bad, but I think I'll let the other other three bottles sit awhile to let the Brett dry it out a bit. There's a syrupy sweetness here I don't like. I had read this was their take on Orval, but I'd take Orval over this every time."
"okay but i doubt ill be buying this again for around 3 bucks a bottle."
"O- I think a year and a half has been pretty kind to this brew. Much more funk present compared to a fresh bottle. I'm intrigued to revisit this batch in another six months."
"Overall I thought Matilda was an excellent American brewed beer that is made in the Belgian style. It does not quite reach the level of the finest Belgian brews, but it is certainly well crafted and has a lot of great flavors."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not an easy beer for me to find, so I'm glad that I came across it. I'm not a huge Belgian fan, but this beer is quite obviously well crafted. Alcohol is well hidden. A nice sipper."
"O: Definitely a sipper. I like belgians but this one has a bit too much funk for my liking"
"O- A really great beer from Goose island, definitely a beer for people who love yeast. The Brett really works perfectly here, one of the best ""wild"" belgians I've had."
"I can commend this drink for having balance, and being very tastefully brewed, but I would love to see what this could be like if pushed a little further."
"Have not been super impressed with some other Goose Island beers, but this is surely my favorite."
"O - Could use this as a gateway to the belgian style. A enjoyable brew from GI."
"O- Solid beer, however, not sure it warrants the price tag."
"It's listed as a strong pale, but drinks more like a saison to me due to the peppery taste. A really nice beer to be sure, but it fell a bit short of my expectations."
"I accidentally bought this beer thinking it was a bottle of domonique...completely different beer unfortunately. I've never been a huge fan of BPAs because I think pale ales and belgian ales are best enjoyed separately (depending on the mood I happen to be in). Also, the beer was pricey, almost $4 for a 12oz bottle. I can get an Ommegang BPA for cheaper and I'd know it was supporting local upstate business...instead of fueling A-B's tyranny."
"Narrative: You said this would be the last time, you curse yourself, breath swilling cold in circlets from your lips, ""you ARE A BLGIUM ALE"" you told yourself that when you looked in the bezzled mirror, you told yourself when you fill up your handbag, dont sell yourself short, you can do this. A john approaches in a Mitsubishi Mirage, not exactly your market but hey, ""Belgium strong, what's your pleasure"" he looks displased...is it...my color? No...I look almost how I should.."" YOU? You're a belgium strong? I had you pegged more for a French farmhouse girl...whats youre into?"" He's judgmental, and I am nervous, he knows, he knows I am mediocre and he's smelling it as well ""I am into whatever can foot the bill sweetie"" He gestures knowingly that this baleful ale will be costly but ultimately fulfilling. The mighty 4 cylinder revvs towards consumption."
"Though this beer doesn't look too impressive, we must always remember not to judge a book by its cover. The composition and balance of flavors is very good, and the mouthfeel is excellent. I personally find that the yeast ties everything together quite nicely. There is only so much that can be done with citrus and honey, but this beer manages to combine quality flavor with great body. It's a shame that Goose Island was just bought by Anheuser-Busch, because this is a great offering."
"First beer from Goose Island, makes me want to drink others."
"O: I have a soft spot in my heart for Matilda, as it was one of the brews responsible for cultivating my love of craft beer when I lived in Chicago. Hard to believe I still hadn't reviewed it until now. Sentiment aside, this is a fabulous brew that I really should drink more often."
"O: This is a very nice beer. 4"
"Taste-Tart fruit, crisp apple, spicy and wine-like. Overall, a bit tart for my taste. I'll have to try a fresh bottle for comparison. Still, not too bad."
"O: A nice departure from the session beers that Goose Island is most famous for. While this beer won’t exactly make me a GI fanatic, it certainly was a good drink. A great attempt – I’m glad I tried it."
"Could taste the alcohol. Coats the mouth nicely, not overly sweet. Overall a good beer. Would like to buy this one again."
"Flavour - subtle mixed fruit tempered by a bracing bitterness, herbal, strong bitterness on the finish, lingering hops bitterness fading to banana"
"O - The least of the three sisters, lesser than brother Jacques, too."
"Light mouthfeel and a crisp finish. Pretty enjoyable overall, but I would have a bit of hard time pairing with food. Probably my own fault in being a hop head and preferring hops with everything. Solid offering."
"D - Great drink; I've always enjoyed thoroughly; exceptional blend of fruit and yeasty aromas and a nice refreshing taste; I will always have a glass of Matilda if available"
"A note to Anheuser Busch: Please don't screw this up now that you own 100% of Goose Island... Please..."
"An interesting take on the BSPA and definitely one of the better ones I've had. The funk character was much appreciated and added a layer of complexity, I feel this style needs."
"O: A good belgian."
"O: Great balance and complexity, with an easily drinkable flavor profile. I’d gladly drink this all night."
"D - A very solid beer. I would get this again. It is far from a Belgian Pale, though. That's a very strange characterization."
"Drink- Very good beer. This was crisp and clean and very well balanced. Beautiful characteristics and nuances. Will have this one again no doubt."
"Had this at a little wine/beer bar in California, the server gave it a decent pour into a tulip glass. The beer was generally a light amber sort or color, it may have just been the lighting, but it seemed to have a slightly pinkish hue. The head seems less than impressive as it quickly retreats. The smell is very nice, I get some floral notes as well as citrus. Taste features the spices and the fruitiness well. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected, but smooth and just lightly carbonated. Overall, this was a fun beer to try, but not something i'll get on a regular basis."
"O - I could have another but the level of carbonation is distraction to me, I like the flavors and directions this beer is going but not the carbonation/champagne form 3.5"
"Wow. High marks across the board, had on tap at Sweetwater in Chicago, IL. Sucks they're getting bought out but I hope and pray that quality is not sacrificed in the process. Pours a ruby red with a very sweet smell. Tastes similar, sweet with a smooth finish. I loved it, mouthfeel isn't too intense as well. I will definitely try this again, I really enjoyed it with my burger."
"O: A very good Belgian Style Ale."
"Overall - Definitely worth trying, and I will be having this beer again."
"Overall an excellent, dangerously drinkable beer that stands up to many of the best Belgians. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is oily slick and creamy, with a medium body, very light carbonation and slight bitter finish that's dry and refreshing. Excellent drinkability, this beer was much better than I expected and I had to force myself to drink it slower as I neared the end. A really great beer that I highly recommend trying."
"It didn't look like I'd hoped, but it does everything else well, and provides good alcohol on top of it all."
"A hazy brownish orange with a 1/2 inch of head which quickly dissipates. Nice nose of clove, baking spices and tropical fruits. Taste is full of belgian spice, banana and some ripe peaces and apricots. Just a touch of hops to clean up all the sweetness. A beer i would revisit had AB not just purchased it."
"This beer is a go to Belgian, for those who are familiar with the type of beer as well as those who need to be introduced. Its taste what you would expect from a Belgian but also has its own unique tones. Delicious taste but leaves you feeling a little heavy. I would recommend having a bottle at the beginning of the night or on its own for a special occasion. Try if you get the chance!"
"Overall, this brew is very well made and each sip leaves my mouth happy and refreshed all over."
"Not bad at all. Pretty good take on a Belgian style. It doesn't hold up to the top ones, but nobody would expect it to."
"A delicious, well-rounded, balanced, highly drinkable BSPA."
"Drank in a NB Globe glass... This is my first experience with Matilda and second with Goose Island. I would recommend Matilda to a friend. Very enjoyable brew, thank you Dave for the trade!"
"Light and dangerous like a good Belgian strong should be. The big pear flavors were unexpected and delightful."
"Matilda is highly enjoyable.. everything is hitting on all cylinders.. recommended!"
"This bottle definitely has more funk than I remember the last time I had this beer (3+ years). Though the label says the beer will continue to develop over 5 years, I don't think the time improved things. Overall, it was just too sweet and unbalanced, not to mention somewhat flat. May need to try a fresh bottle again."
"Poured amber in my Chimay chalice. Nice head retention. Some lace. Nice sweet, yet bold flavors that compliment the style very well. Very pleasant. More of a drinker than a sipper. Smooth and easy to drink. Bought one bottle to try it out but will definitely grab more. Compares favorably with Damnation in my opinion."
"Overall a good beer that was enjoyable. Not usually a Belgian drinker but this was a good change up. Alcohol was there a bit which detracted from the overall Belgian spiciness and fruit forward appeal. I would drink it again, maybe cellar some"
"pours an orange color with smallish white head. slightly cloudy from several small ""floaties"" in it. The beer wasn't really shaken so this seem strange. Beer smells of belgian spice, with strong ""Brett"" aroma. taste is pleasant, with a fruitiness along with the brett. the fruit is of the citrus variety. a bit tart. Nice mouthfeel. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this one. I was not expecting the Brett in this but am pleasantly surprised. I'm assuming this was intended and not of the ""infected"" batches noted above since this is dated 10/08/10."
"Bottled 10/2010."
"D - A decent beer here. I like this one. A great job IMHO of duplicating a Belgian. Orval is supposed to be the motivation behind this beer. I like this one better. Not as dry.I'll have to stock this as cellar a few."
"I could drink this all day. They serve it in heaven."
"This beer is awesome. I tried aging this beer out about a year and a half, and I think I like it better fresh, but it's still quite good. At this point, its showing a lot of yeast character, with tons of phenolic spicy notes, though I expected more brett to evolve with time. Very very good."
"Pours a delightful orange/amber colour, good white head, some lacing left on the glass. Smell has a nice Brett funk, good hop presence, big yeasty presence shows up as well. Taste has a funky brett presence, light sourness, fruity, green fruit, mildly hoppy, a nice malt brings everything together well. Good mouthfeel, creamy, nice weight, carbonation is just how I like it for a strong belgian style. Drinks very well, would welcome this anytime, solid stuff from Goose Island again."
"D: This is a good BSPA that is a couple of flavor notches away from being great. Overall, a solid choice for review 1,000."
"Overall probably my favorite American version of this style."
"Drinkability: One could drink a sixer of these without getting sick of it, easily. I definitely like this beer, especially with a little bit of age on it. A good one to pick up regularly at the bar."
"The body was medium, soft, and light. I've had other Belgian Pale Ales that I've enjoyed a little more than this. It was tasty and pleasant, but I think I like stronger flavors."
"Pours a golden orange with a thin frothy head that thins out quickly. Smells sweet and sour with spicy undernotes. Tastes sweet up front and sour in the middle, nice and dry. Very balanced tastes, even and smooth. Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation, not to much bubbles. Kind of bready. Its good, i like this beer. I will defiflnitely buy another bottle and will try and hang on to it a little longer before i drink it. Yummy full and delicious."
"D - Quite drinkable and enjoyable. Paired this with a steak salad with spinach."
"Also, 10 bucks Portman wins for Black Swan. DUR!!!"
"Drinkability: As the beer warms, the funk develops a bit more and detracts from the pickled flavor, but honestly I don't really find this brew that appealing. I really don't think I'll be coming back to this one."
"Excellent example of a strong pale ale, I would definitely drink this again."
"Matilda is beautiful Belgian-style Strong done with a fruity yeast that is easy to approach, but complex to ponder. Probably the most notable of the Goose Belgian-y series and for good reasons... It's a great introduction to the other-than-Honker's Goose line-up."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a hint of red. There's a medium white head that disappears quickly... If I remember correctly, Goose Island brewed this beer in somewhat of a clone of Orval. Like the head on Orval a lot more. Scent doesn't quite live up to Orval either...although has a definite pleasant smell. Not funky like I was expecting. Has some light hoppy notes and an interesting English malt aroma.Yeasty aromas as well with lovely floral notes. Taste is definitely yeasty with coriander and banana. Somewhat earthy and grassy with flowers and spiciness. It has some alcohol flavor to it as well. Mouthfeel is very nice...dry and somewhat fluffy. Very drinkable beer! Overall, I was hoping there would be more funkiness and some Brett character, but I got little to none. Maybe I should sit on a bottle for a while and see if I see it later on. No Orval, but good beer."
"OVERALL GRADE: A-/A"
"D -- Solid brew and very flavorful, nothing ridiculous but a great representation of the style."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St Bernardus glass. No real head to speak of. The color of this beer is really nice. Sort or a hazy reddish orange. Aroma is Fruit, citrus and maybe pear or apple. I also get some yeastiness and a note of grain. Finally I get a faint spiciness but subtle like coriander or something similar. The taste is a little sweet up front with a nice fruitiness, I also get a little bit of spice and a distinct lemon note on the end. I don't mind the mouth feel of the beer itself as it has a bit of weight but I marked it down a bit because the carbonation was a bit grainy. Overall I really liked this beer and will probably pick it up again."
"D-%7 masked well. I love the juicy aspect of the beer. I have one only one 12 oz. but I could see myself have more of this without complaint."
"D-I can only think of a few better Belgian Pales, certainly none from this side of the pond. Very easy and interesting to drink and it develops nicely in the bottle (this was a 2010). I would say its still a little on the sweet side, and the alcohol should blend in a little better, but both of those things get better with a little age. Based on the price and availability I consistently cite this as one of my best buys."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Highly carbonated and a light body. Feels a bit creamy as well. This is one of the best American attempts at a Belgian beer I have ahd yet."
"Overall, I found Matilda to be a nice adaptation of a traditional Belgian style. It's unique in its own right, and I would certainly consider buying it again- especially to see how it fares over time."
"VERY GOOD, SEEK THIS OUT!"
"D: Enjoyable glass and goes down quite easily. Even if the taste wasn't outstanding, the nice balance and easy drinking could lead to me having another."
"Nice drink with nicely balance flavors. More would be fine."
"Pours a hazy copper with a thin off white head. The head dissipates rapidly. Fine rings of lacing. Aroma is of sweet fruits. A touch of hops but mostly sweetness. Has a good carbonation. The flavor is good. Nice mix of malts and hops. Blended real well. This taste like the fine Belgians. Has a great mouthfeel. The texture is oily and a touch dry. Has a medium body. The finish is awesome. I love the aftertaste. This is a good beer."
"Mouthfeel seems a bit light but with a nice dry and crisp feel that boosts the drinkability. Overall, Matilda is a very enjoyable Belgian style beer that seems sure to please anyone."
"D: Goes down pretty easily and smooth, but without that light crispness, it's not as drinkable as many of the better representatives of the style."
"Nice beer from GI. I'd definitely have it again."
"D- This is certainly one to drink all night at a Holiday party and perfect for matching with many styles of food! Better than Reisling with spicy Chinese food! i wish they made a gum that tastes like this!"
"MD- A soft creamy feel. This is a beer I would go for again. Unfortunately Goose Island does not distribute to PA. Thanks to Don H for bring this back from a trip to Mass."
"The feel is not as big as expected but robust none the less. Age has given some subtle nuance to the flavors and the feel of this beer."
"Of the Belgian style ales that I've had from Goose Island, this is my favorite."
"D - I think this has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and it is pretty refreshing. I just wish that the body was a little bit more full. Overall, I think this is a good beer, and I'd try it again."
"Pretty solid good beer and a unique one for this style. Great beer."
"D- drinkable as most GI brews are this one was very easy to down and really liked the taste"
"Easy to drink, but to be honest, I'm glad I only have one bottle. Not the best belgian pale I've ever had. Good for one, but not for a bunch."
"D: The drinkability on this beer is good. I enjoyed the beer the only downside is it is way to overpriced for what you get in return."
"A great beer all around and one I could enjoy any time of year."
"D- Real tasty and not an abv that'll hurt you."
"Pretty tasty stuff. I could drink this one again."
"Feel on palate is average, and drinkability is pretty good, with not really any overpowering alcohol or tastes."
"D - the mix of flavors can be a bit overpowering, but it's a fairly drinkable beer."
"Overall: Definitely an excellent Belgian-style ale."
"This is very drinkable Belgian ale that has a good balance of yeast and spice. It pours a light copper and good carbonation. The smell is full of slightly sweet yeast. The taste is well balanced mix of yeast and spices. The taste is drawn out more than most Belgian's I've tasted due to the lower alcohol level."
"Appearance is a copper/orange color. not much in the nose, a little sourness there, but not a lot going on here. the taste is tart and makes you want to pucker. tastes sour and tart. taste is simple and nice. a nice Belgian pale with some solid sourness. not to much complexity but i'm enjoying drinking it. for $9 i think i'm gonna go dig up as many of these infected bottles as possible. will be interesting to see what they do with a couple years on them."
"Edit: Brewed On date reads 10/23/09"
"This is no Duvel, but it's a fine beer just the same."
"D - This is a style I am not very fond of, but for me, this is a tasty, highly drinkable and satisfying beer even if I only want one at a time. Generally, the banana is what kills me (not a fan) but I managed to drink this pretty quick. If you want a slightly more tart and funky version of this, check out GI Fleur."
"O: Not bad. Drinkable, but not overly complex. Also, doesn't finish as dry as I would have liked. Pleasant to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer."
"Had this on tap at Bar Crudo in San Francisco. Thought this would pair well with seafood. Pours a pale orange colour with small white head. Lacing around some of the glass. Nice light smell of Belgian yeast and citrus. Very dry flavour, some sweetness. This was my 2nd time having this beer and I certainly will have it again."
"The taste was lightly sweet, light citrus, and honey flavors. It had medium carbonation, and was medium bodied. Very little hops detected. Lingering bready taste. Easy drinking."
"D: Not what I expected from the style, but still quite tasty if you like a fruitier beer."
"Great flavor, spices and malts and you can drink several in a session"
"This pours deep amber, darker for a belgian pale. Hint of sienna shimmer. No head. Minimal ribbons. Smell is light, grainy, slight scent of orange and caraway; no funk or brettanomyces as I thought was adverted for this ale. Maybe I just didn't allow for enough time to develop. Tastes very true to it's scent: caraway, spicy, over top of sweet grain. Actively carbonated with medium body. Summing it up: I need to buy another bottle and give it a year on the shelf to determine if it's up my alley; for now, it's a decent beer, but nothing to shake a stick at."
"An interesting take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale concept. Didn't get much of the brettanomyces advertised, but I'm assuming that's because they need some age to develop. Nevertheless, a quality and enjoyable brew from Goose Island."
"Mouthfeel held true to the style by being fairly effervescent with thin-coating capabilities. Drinkability wasn't slow, but wasn't fast either. I personally identify this beer more so for food pairing and cooking, and not so much for leisurely drinking. I guess it's partly due to an absence of the Brettanomyces strain and having no presence in the aroma or taste. I'd give it another chance if I came across an older bottle."
"Very drinkable, nicely done belgian pale, but not quite ""big"" enough to be a belgian strong."
"Poured from the bottle a nice yeloow hazy amber with a bit of yest sediment, and had a nice rocky thick white head that slowly faded and left the trademark belgian lacing on the glass. The smell is nice and complex, you get tropical fruit notes to clove and an herbal note, very bright in the nose and fruity. Taste is floral citrus tropical fruit hop bite with a nice balance of spice and herbal notes with a well balance of honey malt body, a bit of herbal comes through in the finish. The moutfeel is soft and smooth with a slight bite up front but excellent body. Drinkability this one had me wanting more and that is what a good beer is supposed to do, very well crafted american style belgian strong ale."
"I will not be buying this ale again. It just isn't the flavor I like. Maybe if it didn't seem so watered-down or look like rust-water I would barely tolerate it."
"D: Full flavored. Goes down smoothly Really nice representation of the style."
"Another excellent offering from Goose Island. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an Einbecker flute glass. Pours a nice Orange, gold. Slightly hazy. Smells of fruit and spice, tastes fruit and spice. What a nice drinkable beer this is. Love it, I'll be buying more matilda in the future."
"I'm looking through old notes this one was bottled back in 1/10/09 and it pours an orange copper tone with a bright off white head forms thick evenly spread lacing has the head dwindles down. Semi clouded body really looks tasty as you layer the last part of the bottles head like layers of custer rising above the rim of my chalice. Aroma has a spicy alcohol infused yeast notes with mild black pepper, a bit of funk barnyard character with floral honey biscuit malts. Flavor is awesome caramelized malt sweetness brings a honey drizzled biscuit with ample spicy peppery yeast, assertively citric/floral hops combine as well. Medium bodied slightly stick with a bit of residual sugar, never cloying ample fine bubbled carbonation. Drinkability was excellent I need more of this beer, I don't have much access to Goose Island it hits Ohio from the west and moves eastward rarely making it out my way. Solid uniquely made Belgian style experience that does it's job of paying homage to the likes of Orval yet doing it's own thing entirely."
"Now it smells very sweet and fruity with interesting peach, pineapple, and mango notes. Brett is obvious and imparts a tangy aroma and flavor. Its fantastic and at this point I'd bump the smell and taste scores a half point each."
"Drinkability: There are not too many improvements I'd make on the drinkability of the beer. What would make this beer perfect is a tad more spiciness to make every sip interesting. But still not a bad brew at all. This is one of the best I've had from Goose Island."
"Light tan head; 1/4"" at pour settles to nice ring around edge of glass and some spotting on face of beer. Hazy light brownish orange color; orangy yellow highlights. Slight trace of clove, but not overbearing in aroma which I like. Bright citris smells, orange and some lemon peel, along with coriander. Some faint breadiness in aroma. Moderate to high carbonation. Slight dark sweetness to start, orange and breadiness in middle. Citris end followed by light breadiness. Clean finish, lasting citris peel. Very drinkable and relatively refreshing."
"EDIT: Tried 2009 vintage (bottled December 12) today for Thanksgiving and I would rewrite the taste and aroma entries almost entirely: earthy, barnyard funk now pervades in nose and on palate; tangy, funky sour/bitter complexity in the mouth. Getting an older bottle and sitting on it seemed to do the trick. Maybe 2009's batch was different than the 2010, but the bottle I had today tasted more like a saison and was very complex and full. Scores altered accordingly!"
"D: this is fast becoming one of my favorite American style Belgian beers."
"Good complex beer with well established fruity flavors, it really is a good beer to pair with things that would normally be paired with a big italian cab."
" Island ""specialty"" collection."
"D- good overall, im going to have to try it in the bottle for the full effect. only problem is the bottle is about as pricey as the tap was."
"D - Not quite as epic as the ""infected"" version, but still a darn tasty brew... One of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales going... I wish I had this available to me on a regular basis... (4.5)"
"Drinkability- Not a quaffing beer!!!! I sat in my chair sipping on this for over an hour. It was nice to just relax with a nice warming beer after a super stressful monday at the office. Will age a couple of these to see what they do."
"The beer pours a copper color, with a white head that ended fast. Could be because of a dirty glass, but who knows for sure. Smells like a Belgian ale. Very fruity smell, with a hin tof caramel or a biscuit malt. The taste is very sweet. Tastes like a candi sugar and biscuits. It says they only use caramel malt as a specialty malt. The extra flavor could come from the yeast. The mouthfeel is light to medium. The drinkablility is ok. I could see sipping something like this but not having a few. For a Belgian Strong Pale Ale the malt character stands out a lot."
"D - it started out easy drinking but got a little tough towards the end of the glass."
"Drinkability: I think this is easy for me to drink."
"smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. not rating this as drinkable as you might think considering i'm giving it a 4.5 taste. the sweetness and spices wear on you a bit as the bottle dwindles. that said, i would definitely have this again in the future."
"For the price it's decent-- you can certainly do much worse."
"Spicy sweet beginnings with a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel on the medium body; a slight bittering medium dry finish with a phenolic and fruity aftertaste, and very low residual sweetness."
"I had one excellent Orval once and this is right up there with it I'd have to say. I've had the infected Matilda too and was put off by the sourness. This is wholly different."
"This beer is served a deep amber color with only a fine lace on the surface no head to speak of at all. The overall aroma is mostly comprised of bananas and orange zest with cinnamon all mixed into a bread if you will. The problem with the overall aroma is it is on the weak side for me there isn't really anything to smell. It's not bad, the smells aren't acrid, but it's just unimpressive. The taste is good. There is a very strong banana and orange flavor mixed with the brown sugar and caramel bread. The flavor would be delicious if it weren't bittering to the tongue. It's intentionally syrupy with bittering effects, without the real hoppiness to warrant the reaction. The boozy bitterness takes this from a good drinking beer to a fairly good drinking beer. Overall it's a very good beer, it's just maybe not my cup of tea."
"Served on tap Matilda pours a cloudy yellow-orange with little head. I think the bartender must have capped this beer because I'm surprised to see so little head from a Belgian, and don't remember no head when I've had this beer bottled. The beer is served a little too cold and the initial aroma is citric orange. Brett character starts to come forward as the beer warms. The flavor is grainy sweet with citrus and slight barnyard funk dominant as well as spicy hop notes. The flavor is really remarkable and I'm surprised to see Maltilda has such a low rating. I know this is supposed to be an Orval clone, and while it is great, I still prefer Orval's drier, hoppier character."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a classic BSPA, but maybe not the most exciting one out there."
"This is a tasty beer. It appears to have held up well given the travel it's gone through and it still tastes really nice."
"Decent pricing, 4 for 12 dollars, and it is surely a decent beer for that price. Keep in mind when people are ranking really fantastic beers or breweries they might down rank or sandbag the rating because expectations are sky high."
"D - Not bad to have a few but it doesn't make me really want more"
"D - Not too sweet and doesn't taste boozy - pretty high."
"D: For as strong and as bold as it is, the beer is just so unique as to make it a great pleasure. Not relaxing in the least, it's still best to take it slow."
"Drinkability - A fantastic rustic Belgian pale ale. Definitely a beer I wish I could have on hand more often. The flavors are all completely in check and well rounded."
"D-This is just one of those styles that I'm not particularly a fan of. I definitely will come back to this one after cellaring to see if it develops more with age as this one is pretty fresh."
"The body was light, but alive. Carbonation had a fizzy presence at the tip of the tongue, then faded to nothing more than an afterthought. The finish was reminiscent of just having finished a juicy slice of green apple."
"By the packaging and price I was expecting something close to a fine Belgian ale, but this is a weak interpretation in my opinion."
"D: I was hoping for a bit more from this beer. It was good, certainly, but for a beer that is talked about so much, I found it to be a bit uninteresting."
"Pours a hazy, translucent amber-orange. Nice fine-bubbled off-white head, fair amount of carbonation. Smell is very dark-fruit-like. Strong hints of plum and slight earthy malts. First taste is very fruity, with a circular feeling that ends as a recognition of hops. A bit of metallic taste. Very flat feeling, and by that I mean smooth, almost like the head bubbles.. The mouth is coated by a syrupy fruitness. Complex, but nothing too grandiose about it. Decent enough, very plum-y, a bit too much like a weisenbock for my taste. I'll try another in the series..."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a nice and big fluffy white head. The aroma is a mixed between floral notes and some perfume. Can definitely pick out the brett notes in the nose. The taste is very similiar to the nose with the floral type tastes hitting me first that is balanced with some sweetness. Some spice as well. Ends rather crisply. A solid beer for me. Medium/light mouthfeel."
"D-while definitely not a session beer, one that I will always keep a few around, excellent to finish off a night with, sort of like a brandy/cognac"
" It has wild musty characteristics It finishes nice and dry. Strong work. I wish I could get this in my neck of the woods."
"I believe I actually had this brew in its hometown of Chicago a few years back, and remember enjoying it then. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I might give it another shot."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I would drink this more if it was available by me."
"D- Pretty good and easy to drink."
"Matilda was orange in color and cloudy. It had a beige head that soon became a thin cap, but remained to the end. The aroma was fruity with some spice. The taste was fruit, yeast, and sweet malt. The finish was dry. The mouthfeel was nice; a medium body with medium-high carbonation, sort of creamy. Drinkabity was very good. This is a nice beer and worth a try."
"D- Considering the price and quality, very high."
"Mouthfeel is a bit fluffy, medium bodied, with a lingering barnyardy mustiness that just sits on the palate afterward, which is just a bit of a hit on drinkability."
"Notes: This is an absolutely wonderful and complex Belgian Style Ale."
"D: I wish they sold these near us. Absolutely wonderful and easy to drink. One of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales I've ever had."
"This one pours a rich, burnt auburn in color with a light white head. It's somewhat translucent and medium bodied. The smell is full of yeast with some ethanol. The taste is perfect in my opinion. It's got the perfect combination of yeast, subtle sweetness, and alcohol. It drinks very smoothly and I see no reason to stop at one, or two, or three. It's delicious and excellent on tap or from the bottle. It gets even better with time."
"Off tap and served to me in a red wine glass at the Chicago O'hare airport this beer was a hazy, tangerine and amber color. The head was one finger of khaki colored head, the retention was good and it left lacing in sliding bands. The aroma was of boozy esters, citrus zest, candi sugar and tropical fruit. The flavors were an interesting, spicy blend of boozy esters, citrusy hops, candi sugar, some fruity esters and then a strong, hoppy finish. It reminded me at first taste more of a Belgian Dark Ale until that bitter finish came through. Still, it was tasty and on-point. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body full/medium and the carbonation perfect. Tap beer was made for beers like this."
"A well balanced example of the style, which lacks the complexity of its model (Orval)...though probably worth aging some to see how the Brett. takes hold."
"Overall impression: a bit dry in my mind, but enjoyable once in awhile. not my favorite."
"I could enjoy a few glasses of this...blindfolded Id say this were a Belgian beer."
"M&D - like her sister Sofie, Matilda needs to mature a bit and the other bottles will get that, its a little raw at this time and this review will be edited at that time"
"D: Very good overall. Liked this brew alot"
"D: Still a very good beer and very enjoyable, but it just doesn't seem to hold water to the freshness on draft."
"I must admit, this beer becomes more enjoyable with each sip. At first, the profile attacks the palate. I'd really like to pair this up with some interesting cheeses."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer- it has some of the most unique flavors I have seen in any beer, almost like a gingerbread cookie. Definitely a one-of-a-kind brew, and not necessarily the best beer I've had, but certainly a very good one I would be more than happy to have again."
"D: I find this to be a easy drinking beer, a nice balance of flavors and the palate is calling back for more attempts to denote all flavors. Get GI brew."
"This is an excellent beer to both introduce you into the world of funky beers, as well as for the existing beer connoisseur. It is elegantly complex with freshly rustic flavors of the old world. I would enjoy this with anything spicy, seafood, or wash rind cheeses."
"Picked this up at Ledgers/ Berkeley, won of the better beer stores in the Bay Area. Always stayed away from Goose Island, based on the partnership with Bud, stupid me. This is a very drinkable, nice bready malto-meal beer that goes down way to easy at 7%. Unique yeast adds to the flavor?? Good beer, will drink again."
"this one may have been to young to drink now, gonna cellar the rest and go from there."
"Notes: Now, this is far more remarkable than some of the other Belgium precedents from Goose Island I´ve tried. This is certainly more on par with the quality experienced in some of their brews. Maybe nothing extraordinary but it is quite recommendable."
"O: Cant wait for next year for another vertical tasting of this beauty."
"D- Not my favorite for the style, but I am definitely going to try it again. I wish I had bought more than one. Really interesting taste that differs from the smell, but should definitely be tried."
"The mouthfeel is good if not a little more carbonated than I would like. Despite this, Matilda is a very enjoyable beer that I could have a few of. Its subtle flavor and light feel promote further drinks. Goose Island has a winner here."
"Overall this beer is good, drinkable, but not great. Some of the flavors just don't work together for me and the finish is thin."
"D - Extremely drinkable; the taste never gets old and at 7% it is not too much to have a few more"
"Pour a hazy orangish/amber color with a lot of carbonation, very thick (1in) creamy head. There are little brown specks that I assume is yeast that was dislodged as I poured. There is a slight ""belgian"" nose but it is not very strong. The taste is obviously related to belgian style ale but, there is a slight bitter malt (almost metallic) flavor at the back of my tongue, not what I associate with Belgian ales. The spicy flavors seem to be muted, I am wondering if there has been some oxidation, maybe that would explain the brown specks. This is a nice beer and there is enough going on that I would like to try another but, this specific bottle seems to be lacking. I hate twist-off tops for a beer like this."
"I don't find this one very refreshing. There's sort of a common theme going on with Goose Island's belgian styles that I'm not a fan of overall. It's sort of like the yeast they use doesn't attenuate very well. If it was drier it would be easier to drink. There's also a surprising amount of alcohol in the profile even though it's only 7% Not a bad attempt, and I dig the flavors, but overall it's not what I had hoped for."
"D- Nice to sip over the course of the meal, keeps you wanting more."
"Bought another bottle today...upon further reflection, I have revised a couple scores upward. The brett seems a little more pronounced in this one, and the beer is a little more interesting."
"The bret backbone has a lacto sensation, absolutely unique other than the original (Orval) that this imitates. It is full and balanced and quite refreshing. Worth keeping a few in the cooler."
"jd"
"Overall - a very solid brew that just lacks a little something that would have pushed it higher for me, I will definitely pick up another bottle to give it another chance but this time it just feel short. Decent, not great."
"Lovely beer and something I drink quite regularly."
"Beer is medium in body and kind of bitter, surprisingly so. Mildly dry as well. The level of sour is pretty good but the funk is really nice. The leathery character of the beer really rounds out the flavors well."
"Really has a nice amber, red sunset orange color to it. Near perfect clarity. Big big foamy head with great lacing. Smells very fruity estery and has a sweet peach thing going on. Has that classic belgium floral aroma. Taste is really nioe and balanced. Doesn't finish dry, but has laser like focus for its stone fruit flavors. Big peach and banana taste. Has solid carbonation with a noce smooth lingering taste. I wouls really rate this a near perfect beer. Easy as hell to drink. If you can find it, get it"
"EDIT: Saved a bottle and after 10 months of aging the sweetness had mellowed quite a bit. There was a gentle brett funk on the much drier finish. Much improved overall balance and complexity of flavors with some great floral notes. Think I'll pick up some more of these (the price is right!) and try to sit on them even longer."
"d- I don't think that this adds up to the finest belgian styled ale I have had"
"I'd love to know the origin of this beer's name. It pours a clear amber topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises sour grapes, caramel, citrus hops, and some sour peach. The taste holds notes of wheat, Belgian yeasty earthiness, clove, spice (you know, that lovely Belgian olio), and citrus zest. The body is a hefty light, with a high-moderate carbonation and a sticky, champagne-like feel. Overall, a solid offering, but probably a bit overrated. Still definitely worth a seek, though."
"Matilda comes looking Belgian from the head retention alone, great retention. Bright white foam that leaves some stick here and there. Liquid is a nice pale golden color that looks tasty. Smells include a big amount of fruit and yeast. Apples and some bread from the yeast with some small spices. Tastes are a group of fruits, banana and pear comes through the most with a cloveiness, slight though. This is much less funky than the bottle version (which was aged), the tap is more fruity and yeasty, I guess this is mad fresh, it tastes it. Feel is just full of fruit up front yeasty in the middle, delicious throughout leaving a nice pleasant aftertaste of everything, slightly drying. I would drink a ton of this, A treat."
"This brew turned out to be sourer than I expected. I have had a few Belgian strong pale ales, and none have had this sour fruitiness."
"This beer goes down very easy, but mainly because its like drinking beer flavored soda. I'm sure its well done for the style, but this simply isnt my style of brew."
"M:"
"The aromas and tastes fit really well together, and made this beer very refreshing and enjoyable."
"D - could improve with age, we'll see. decent overall though"
"2010 version bottled on 1/15/10. I had this first at the ACBF about a month ago and really liked it. So, when I saw it in my local brew shop I snatched it up. Poured a red-orangish color with a head that dissipated quickly. I wanted to say it had a clear look but it did develop a slight haziness. The appearance kind of turned into a flat look midway through however. Aromas were highlighted with sweet, tart fruits, raisins, a carmamelness, and the slightest hint of alcohol. I wasn't really getting the whiff of any pronounced hops. The hints of alcohol transferred over to the taste and mouthfeel. But not at all unpleasant. A sweet and slightly chewy mouthfeel that I actually enjoyed. My last thought about this beer is that maybe the version I loved from the ACBF was a bit more aged. This newest installment tasted slightly ""green"" as they say and the thing that really got me wondering was that on the side of the bottle it says that it can develop for up to 5 years. I'd love to age a bottle for a few years to see what would happen but unfortunatly I'm not that patient. If there's beer in the house I find it! I'd recommend finding an older version or aging one yourself."
"Deep amber in color, smell slightly of hops but not overpowering. Taste is exquisite, hoppy up front with a smooth finish containing multiple distinct flavors that I can't put my finger on. The incredible smoothness of this beer makes it one of my personal favorites, would drink again for sure."
"The flavor is exactly as expected: Strong alcohol and lighter malt. Lots of Belgian yeast flavors as well. The body is as expected: above average mouthfeel with a corresponding carbonation."
"Overall, pretty nice beer"
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Beer poured a reddish orange with an off white head. Yeast sediment is floating at the bottom. Nose is light fruits and sour funk. Taste is tart apples and pears with a slight hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth but does not quite pull off a classic belgian feel. Drinkability is good; flavors are good, the tartness is not overwhelming. Nicely crafted beer!"
"D: An interesting beer, and one that I was curious about for a while. As an American-made, Belgian-inspired beer, this is pretty nice. Up front, it's a bit sweet, and the Juicy Fruit comparisons certainly have merit, but it also boasts a solid hop presence that helps balance things out."
"Drinkability - I feel as though I would be tempted to drink a few (assuming I were not paying). The aftertaste leaves more drink to be desired. It drank best fresh out of the bottle, at a very chilled temp, and the shot of sediment was a bit more potent than the rest, but just as tasty."
"I will cellar a few and revisit my review after I find an older bottle. I do have to say that it fits well with the style and I can't wait to have another."
"Not extremely drinkable with the carbonation but it has a great flavor and a good sipping beer."
"D: very flavorful, yet refreshing. Goose Island has done an admirable job in recreating a very difficult style."
"This is very refreshing. The live yeast hasn't really taken over this beer as of yet, but you can slightly take notice of it's presence. Resembles a solid Belgian style beer. Toasted malts, Belgian yeasts, wood, earthy, slight fruit. Light and crisp mouthfeel...while pulling off a slightly medium body with compilation of flavors. Carbonation is on the middle end, and overall...a great drinker!"
"D: More complex and impressive than the younger tap version."
"delicious and very drinkable, but i wouldn't have more than 1 or 2 of these in a night. at just over a year old, this is a damn fine beer. much more enjoyable than some other well known examples of the style."
"Nicely carbonated with a medium body. The drinkability is pretty damn good on a hot day right after work."
"Excellent in my opinion. I think I will have to get several four packs to have around and to age a bit!"
"D - A very good beer. Lots of interesting flavors. Not particularly easy drinking though. Feels a bit heavy going down and the balance towards the malt makes it difficult to swig this one freely. I do think I will be getting more of this now that GI is in Massachusetts."
"Bought at the Bier Stein in Eugene, OR. Drinking while watching the Blackhawks in the SCF. Pours a light brownish color, almost looks like Iced tea. Smells very malty, and the flavor remains the same throughout. I don't think I'd want to drink more than one or 2 being that it's 7% abv. This is the first Goose Island beer I've had since I left the Chicago area, so i'm pretty satisfied. I would prefer an oatmeal stout, but you can't get that out here."
"Pours a nice dark golden color with an egg shell white head. Head fades dues the 7% ABV. Smell has a nice yeasty/malty smell with a bit of alcohol present. The beer is nicely carbonated with a mild malty flavor with a hint of spice. A well balanced beer that doesn't get too sour or too sweet. Refreshing enough for a hot day but could do equally well on a colder day."
"purchased this bottle at bevmo in santa clarita as it comes in a four pack. gave away 2 bottles to great friends and poped open this one for myself. Pours a cludy orange with a short lived head. the lacing from the head is sucked back down gracefully. aromas start off with bannana and clove. small hint of alcohol but the yeasty bread nose are lingering. Starts off quite alcoholic but follows with a classic lingering of clove. this beer i could say is way to young to enjoy now. i would like to see this one 3 years from now. must save the other bottle."
"Not smooth, not bad, not great."
"d - A pretty good Belgian style ale. I liked that the fruit came out more in the taste than the smell. Very easy to drink as well. I would have this again."
"Drinkability: Damn good IMO. Very similar to a tripple. Will defiantly try again."
"Taste: Much like the smell it is really well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. There is a slight banana bread taste at first that has a nice bitterness to keep the sweetness at a good level...really good."
"A really nice American Belgian. I don't want to sound harsh 'cause I do like it a lot, I just don't love it."
"I'd have a hard time picking my favorite age for this beer, which is very unusual - usually one age sticks out as The Peak for me."
"D: My first Goose Island beer, and I find it very elegant. Nothing is overstated - it all just works."
"very nice take on the style and modeled after one of the greatest beers of all time, so tough competition here. orangey amberish with a white head that leaves some lace as it should. nose is grain, caramel, horse barn, peppery spice and a faint, but very pleasant, pineapple/citrus effect from hopping that is boosted very well by the sweetness of the malt. in the taste, pepper and barn hit me first, followed by the sweet and fruity (and old school bubble gummy?) and wrapped up with the wild, peppery barn again but with a mellow warming sensation as it goes down. i also get some preserved lemon in the back end. medium body with a slick creaminess to it. i'll take a properly handled orval over this one any day, but overall, i think this is a great tribute beer that is very well executed. good job goose!"
"Cheers to Goose Island! Do these guys ever mess up? I'm thinking - NO!"
"And I don't believe aging this one (as told by GI) will help it any either. Pass."
"D: Goes down easy and is very refreshing, wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"Good in small doses. Seems more potent than 7%. I'll probably sit on the rest of these a while and see what develops."
"DB- Good price for a Brettanomyces influenced beer, which made a nice addition to a fairly standard Belgian Strong Pale flavor. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"D: Yes sir ... may I have another. Again and again. There's nothing about this ale that you are likely to get tired of. Bring em on! A near perfect Belgian ale ... from Chicago."
"No problems with the mouthfeel or drinkability. Carbonation was good, no alcohol taste, easy to drink. I'm usually not a big fan of this style but the brett went long ways here. I'd get it again."
"J"
"D-Good beer as is but needs time to do it's thing. Says it develops over 5 years. I'll check on it again in another year."
"A treat, but expensive at $9 for a 10 ounce pour. This beer is another reason I'm glad to see some of Goose Island's portfolio in California."
"D: drank good all the down the bottle, had good flavor but was dissapointed on the carbonation. Decent belgian from goose island."
"D - a very good beer, but not one to chug at a mid-summer beach party."
"D: Terrific drinkability! Complex enough, plenty flavorful, and of 'modest' strength (at least when compared with others of the style). A pleasure to drink and damn near impossible to have only one of..."
"The sour taste, and I'm not sure if ""sour"" is the right word, is both pleasant and a little off-putting, at least to me. But in a good way, like Cantillon."
"the Belgian style grouping well w/ more of a biere de garde smoothness in malt and nice blend of yeast and hops w/ a overall balanced drinkability"
"taste is thick, sweet fruit, some spice, and a little pepper, ends a little bit on the sweet side, and somewhat bitter."
"This is a great beer to have with food or alone. Balanced and refreshing, this one is becoming a favorite of mine. Thanks GI for coming to Denver!"
"Drinkability -- I personally found this beer to be a bit cloying and the brett character too subdued. That said, it's a complicated and interesting beer with a lot going for it. It's worth a shot, especially if you're curious about beers with brettanomyces and want to start small."
"D - Very tasty and easy to drink. I drank this beer quite quickly the first time I had one. I've tried to slow my self down in subsequent sessions, but I really like this beer so that is difficult. A little bit higher on the abv so watch out on that. Overall I really like this beer."
"Drinkability: The beer is rather drinkable with a great deal of flavor that seemed to come together nicely."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Rochefort goblet. Pours a nice shimmering tangerine color with a creamy khaki head that leaves some filmy lacing and retains well. Aroma isn't really anything special. I'm just getting some typical light fruit salad ester notes atop a grainy, yeasty background. Malty yeasty flavor up front that quickly morphs into a banana pith note. Finish is noticeably hoppy and dry, with a solid pepper note. There's a mild astringency and the finish is rather short, but otherwise the palate is decent. Maybe a little thin for 7%."
"Drink> only one I think"
"Pours a hazy copper color with a one-finger, off-white head. Aromas of cinnamon, clove, banana, coriander, gingerbread and sandalwood. Wow! Light to medium-bodied with a lively and prickly mouthfeel. Opens sweet with a snap of allspice and flows into suggestions of carrot cake, clove and banana. Belgian yeast plows through the middle and contributes to an earthy bitterness on the back of the palate. Notes of sour cherries emerge. Finishes powder-dry and just shy of being astringent. Powerfully spiced, yet delicately complex with many artfully balanced flavors. I haven't had many beers of this style, but Matilda stands very good on its own."
"D - Very good beer. I will pick this one up again."
"Pretty drinkable, but a stretch for my palate in this style. Something to warm up to sours."
"Pours a dark caramelly color without much head retention even with a vigorous pour. It smells like sour sugar with strong scents of grains and barley. If anything this reminds me of a nice strong belgian ale. Taste is fairly strong on the soury/sweet belgian essence and a little too strong on the cloying alcohol. Mouthfeel is fine, full and satisfying. Drinkability is ok."
"This is what I would call a Strong Belgian Pale ale with lots of Malts. Complex yes, but not sure of the harmony."
"Love the label design. Intricate and precise, very elegant typography, minimal and refined. Very classy. Wish more beer labels looked like this."
"D: Slight dryness in the finish and thickness keep this from being an overly drinkable beer."
"D-Overall this is a nice Belgian amber ale (I prefer my pales blonde as opposed to amber-but that's not the beers fault). I'd like to try it fresh so I can pick up the ""profuse amount of hops"" stated on the label. It has a nice soft character and good balance to it as is."
"Taste is similar, dryish, slightly on the sweet side with hint of tartness and a light spiciness. It is very smooth with a great feel that is full but lively and zesty, not oily or watery. The flavour is very full with great depth, lots of grain with a honeyish quality, a firm, zesty fruitiness plus rich clove and hints of sweet fresh lettuce or grass in the finish. It has a pleasant, long, fruity-grain aftertaste. It is highly drinkable, nicely balanced, and holds up well with food."
"The color is somewhere between pale and dark. Carbonation is a little bit low, could have used more. Aroma is great and it is quite a drinkable beer."
"Overall - Meh, good, but not great. A bit of a letdown."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable taste and very easy to drink the first one. After that, I am satiated and liable to switch it up. A positive addition to any session, or with a dessert."
"Overall yet another example of a non Belgian brewer coming up well short in their quest to make a Belgian style beer. I hate to sound like a broken record but this was the second such beer like this I had this evening and both were letdowns. I have no desire to revisit this one again. Not one of GI's better offerings."
"This beer has a copper orange color to it, with a small but consistent head. Smells like caramel popcorn, with a little allspice in the mix. Very creamy mouthfeel that lingers. Lots of fruit on the palate such as baked apples and pears. A little raw dough sourness going on in the background. Overall a very good beer, that I would want to drink again."
"Sweet on the nose, and then sweeter yet on the finish. Coarse and grainy in flavor as the beer opens on the nose yet gets rather stiicky in flavor. Turns red in flavor and style with some caramel notes and a rather subdued Belgian nose, though not for lack of yeast but for an overabundance of malt. Overwhelmingly sweet and simple overall, particularly for a beer dubbed by the brewer as 'dry and quenching' and 'an intriguing choice for beer and wine lovers alike'. Really now..."
"This is a pretty drinkable brew. It seemed to go well with the food, which happened to be a thin crust pizza of brie, ham, granny smith apples and honey mustard glaze. I would buy this again and try to plan the food pairing accordingly."
"While just fine on its own, I enjoyed the second round with beef stew, and will look forward to finding this again, but it does lack the star power I had expected from the hype."
"beer actually taste better to me while on the cool side. usually like belgians after they begin to warm but the metallic flavor began to dominate and it lost the bitterness which threw it off balance. probably won't buy again."
"Another yummy brew from GI. Pours a cloudy muted orange. Immediately get a nice whiff of the Brett and the funk. Also aroma of dried fruit and cloves. Taste is great too. Candied fruit and nice spicy pepper. This is a great thirst quencher for a Belgian. But beware, at 7% ABV it very easy to drink a lot of this. But its a good problem to have. A great American take on a Belgian."
"I really like this beer. I am new to the world of craft beers and this is only my 4th Belgian-style Ale- so keep that in mind, but if you're new too, you might be on par with me. I love the color of this beer, just pouring it was fun. I just love the mouthfeel. Before this I only drank the most common of lagers so mouthfeel is an amazing new experience I hadn't even considered before. This beer is definetly a harder ale than I'm used to, I can definetly taste the alcohol but the taste is worth it its a little bitter but sweet and I like this much more than Hoegaarden!"
"Drinkability: Nice and dry with a decent fruit taste. Not bad for the style, but I am unlikely to purchase this again."
"Well, I'll have to make sure that's what it is supposed to taste like, cause if it is I'm excited for it. This is a really tasty beer, not sure if I would call it a Belgian Strong Pale, but that could also be an older version, or this is a well done infection that I hope more are like. It's dated 2009 vintage in 12oz bottle."
"D-an excellent American take on a Belgian ale, highly recommended"
"Medium carbonated, mouth enveloping and tongue coating. Just an all around pleasant mouth feel. This is definitely a very drinkable and tasty brew."
"Not as good as a topnotch Belgian, but works as an everyday choice for kicking back with some sports on the telly."
"Drinkability: for me, this beer is more than the sum of its parts. It is working very well as a dessert beer for me today, and its combination of flavor and mouthfeel really do synergize to make a super enjoyable beer."
"D-Nice beer. Light crackery malt and a low but nice hop flavor. Could use a bit more aroma, though maybe the low carbonation killed that. Was surprised to find this was a twist off bottle. maybe that had something to do with the lowish carbonation?"
"D - What makes this beer so good is the unconventional drinkability for the style, the is a very well crafted Belgian."
"1/2 finger white head relatively fast dissipation, no lacing to speak of. Orange amber clear body, no visible carbonation. Nose is orange peel, coriander, a bit of spice and dry Belgian yeast. Taste is good for the style, orange peel, coriander, a bit of pepper and clove. Mouthfeel is medium, dry finish, noticeable carbonation. Drinkability, while the alcohol is noticeable, is pretty good. The tap version was a bit more carbonated, but this is a fine tasting beer. May be better in the 750 ml bottle, but this is certainly worth a try. One of the exemplar American versions of the style. Recommended."
"Taste is very warm and smooth, with lots of toasty and bready notes. It's very warming and smoth. Super creamy and rich almost like cake."
"4/4/3.5/4/4"
"Overall, this is a quality brew. I would not be able to drink many of these in a row, but it is delicious and quite complex. The flavors balance nicely, and I as get closer to end of the beer, and this review, it keeps getting smoother and even MORE balanced! I will say that this beer ends better than it begins and I look forward to enjoying this another time..."
"Overall a tasty easy drinking beer for 7% and I will drink it again for sure but I just feel it could be better for the style they are claiming and the catagories above"
"Cheers!"
"D- High, I'll buy more of these. Not too in-love with the price, but this is a very tasty beer that I will buy regardless. One of the better GI beers I've had."
"A surprise favorite at the tasting, Matilda's a fine example of a Belgian pale. She's a real lady: sweet, delicate, and a perfect way to end the night."
"medium body, could be a little light with a little more carb, but very drinkable overall. Pretty accesable easy beer."
"Not overly sweet, it has some balance in the finish. Not a bad interpretation of the style."
"Bottle, home. 2010. Fantastic beer. I'm a huge fan of Goose Island's Belgian style ales. The fruity yeast flavors are wonderful. It gets a bit phenolic and the hops are a tad sharp and grassy right now, but it all sorta works, though I can imagine enjoying an aged bottle. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy, particularly for the style. My pour had very little head and a liquid the color of honey. The flavors are a mix of fruits, apricots, pears and tart pineapple, clean grain, and light funk. Very easy beer to drink but also complex. One of the better American-made Belgian style ales that I've had."
"Really has a nice balance of sweet malt and brett-induced leathery barnyard flavors right now. This is the fist pale I have successfully aged more than a year or two. There is even still a nice bit of floral hops in the finish. Not really all that sour, so I am assuming there is no lacto in here. Reminds me of Avery Fifteen, but less brett and a bit more complex and ageable. The ever-so-slight sweetness really contributes alot to the brew. Extremely enjoyable wild ale and I will be looking for some more next time I am in Goose Island territory."
"Thanks to this beer I'm now getting a sense of brettanomyces and the flavor they produce. It's nice, but it's not for me. I'm going with Sofie next."
"Pours a nice orange-gold color with a decent sized head, bit of lace, carbonation looks high. Aroma has strong esters and flora, Belgian yeast phenols and grassy hops. Flavor is has esters, cloves, ham and a fair amount of hoppiness pops up toward the end. Medium bodied with light-medium carbonation. This is a decent brew, not really too interested though. Way too expensive also."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Pours a luminous golden color that reminds me of Macallan Single Malt. Nose has a whiff of brett, but overall I'm drawn to the candied qualities, almost something like a rich liquer-drenched dried fruit at the holidays. On the palate the dried fruit comes through again, with candy sugar sweetness, and some pleasant black tea flavors. Finish is warm, sweet, and again with more tea."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Thin and flavorful. It's got just the amount of carbonation I'd prefer for the style and the abv (7%) makes me want to keep drinking them all night. I really enjoyed this one."
"Makes for a pretty drinkable ale."
"Overall, I could drink more but am not going to."
"D: Highly drinkable, nothing cloying, just a good refreshing Belgian, great for a warm day."
"D - Very good, I'd do a pint of this. 3.5"
" Hopefully this bottle was a dud, it is a very fresh version of this and seemed VERY green and young, but it still wasn't right. The lack of yeast and sediment and dark malt seemed odd right off; dissapointment is the only word that fits here."
"I jsut tried the 2010 release and found it to be fantastic! this beer pours a golden amber color with a white foamy head. Aromas of dried apricots, banana and malts leap out of the glass. The palate was firm but not over powering with flavors of malts, dried fruits and a touch of baking spice. I pick up a couple of these I look forward to seeing how this beer develops over the next 5 years."
"D- Easy going down, let has a lingering banana aftertaste that I wasn't overly fond of, but I'd be willing to try it again :)"
"Good drinkability. The alcohol is well-concealed. Quite tasty."
"Not the best drinkability. Its too sweet for me. A dent beer but not as great as I was expecting."
"D: Goes down pretty easy. It would be pretty easy to have a few of them. Relatively simple, but just above average for the style for me."
"I tend to stay on the black beer side of things but decided to give this beer a try seeing as I am from Chicago and frequent Goose Island Brewery. All I can say about this beer is I wished my tongue was long enough to lick the inside of the bottle. Thier will definatly be a case of Matilda in the fridge at all times."
"Tasty and crisp Belgian ale with interesting aspects. Good but not great right now. Maybe 2 years?"
"(D)- A basic & simple but good beer made in the belgain style. A great sessionable one actually if I have ever seen one. Great for a summer's day when you are in the mood. Nothing fantastic, just a good no nonsense beer."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but not the greatest as outlined in the taste. I wish I had another bottle so I could try it again with a couple years on it."
"This is a fine beer. I feel that a little refinement would make it better, though. It is a little too sweet, at least for me. As the beer warms it overtakes the bitterness. When the beer was colder I felt the bitterness was out of whack. A little more depth and complexity would solve these issues."
"D - very good drinkability for a fairly flavor-loaded beer. It's pretty aggressive in both ABV and complexity for a pale ale but works nicely."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. Definitely a beer you could sit down and have a couple of while enjoying a good meal. Time to call up my brother-in-law and give him a big thanks!"
"Notes: Matilda is one of my first few Belgian abbey style ales. My main frame of reference for this style is Chimay Red. I know Chimay is high-quality stuff, and Matilda is pretty similar, so that must be a good sign. I'm impressed by how authentically Belgian this beer seems. Goose Island must have gotten ahold of a nice yeast strain. While Matilda doesn't quite have the oomph of the likes of Chimay, it comes darn close."
"Matilda was a great Belgian Ale, similar to Chimay I thought. Yeast is pretty noticeable in this beer, so that may determine if you like this beer or not. The beer pours a dark orange color, nice head too. There's some good flavor with this beer, very typical of other high quality Belgian styles I've had. This is a great beer. I'll drink it again for sure."
"I think I liked this one better on tap than in a bottle (it seemed slightly smoother), but by the narrowest of margins. Would that I could, I would pick this one up a lot. Just a really enjoyable beer all told."
"D: Extremely high. This is a great well-rounded beer."
"Drinkability: I am a little conflicted here. The beer is definitely gulpable but the off Brett smells would prevent me from drinking too much of it."
"D- This is a wonderful example of the style. I would suggest everyone have a bottle or two of this. I am not the biggest Goose Island fan but this beer is simply devine. Will be buying more for the cellar for sure!"
"D- Another great beer in the Goose Island reserves. Very drinkable. Glad that this one seems to be on sale every weekend at Binny's."
"D- Soo tasty. Dangerously drinkable. A very unique, and tartly delicious take on a belgian. I could have more and more, cellar and will-power permitting, without ever getting tired. Although, more than 4 or 5 would likely get me into trouble."
"Overall, a fine beer, just not my style. It really seemed to have the Belgian yeast characteristic down, so if you're a big fan of it, definitely seek this brew out!"
"Pours a very clear amber with lots of lively bubbles racing to the surface. Head on a gentle pour is quite white, but fairly unimpressive and it collapses quickly to a cappuccino-like cap. Moderate lacing follows the beer down the glass. The nose is of green apple, banana, bubble gum and yeast. The palate shows the same, with banana quite evident, ending in a spicy and reasonably dry finish. There is a definite crispness to the beer that makes it refreshing and extremely pleasant to drink. Carbonation is a real factor in this beer; the beer is spritzy and the bubbles dance on the tongue. This is a very easy beer to drink, with a light feel in the mouth. Really, this is an excellent beer, better than many of the true Belgians, and well worth seeking out."
"Maybe that's why I had to leave her and come back when the time is right. She's a little young and immature. Her package is subtle but she's outspoken and untamed, nothing like her older sister Sophie. That doesn't mean she's no good because as time goes on you grow fond of those faults more and more."
"D- Great session beer, could drink it all day. May walk to the brewery to get some right now."
"Drinks very well, not exactly smooth but the fizzy nature helps it go down easy."
"Appearance was a hazy orange/golden color with a decent fluff and collar. Aromas of pale wheat with evident but tastefully subtle yeast fruit/spice/funk. Taste as it smells with a tasteful hop support. Seemed like a slightly more hoppy but mellowed out yeast triple like brew..."
"On tap, $7.50 for a pint (they gave me the wrong glass which was goood for me). Color is copper orange like a blue moon with a small white head. It does not have a stong smell but what i can smells of hops and barnyard funk. Taste is less hops and more spicy funk which i am not a fan of. Alchol is hidden well which is nice. Moth and drink is good for the style. For the price i feel like i would not get another."
"D: This was my first Goose Island offering and I am not disappointed at all. Glad to finally have found this brewery in a store. Would like to have this beer again. The label says ""develops in bottle for up to 5 years"" and I'd be interested in seeing what some age does to this"
"Tasty need have seen it around and tried it on tap on the past try the tap version its better."
"Taste is similar with the malt coming out a bit more and the yeast moving to the background. Nice earthy background tones. Light-medium body and nice carbonation. Quite good."
"Overall it is a good beer from Goose Island, where the regular lineup is a bit unspectacular but their limited release brews are really good."
"Overall this is a tasty beer which I would definitely drink again. Yet, I don't see myself having more than one or two of these at a time."
"This is a real surprise. I expected this beer to be more of a triple but it turned out to be more like a really strong and fruity lambic. I love the fruity notes. I absolutely love the bottle design. The simplicity of it with the off white lable and cursive name is excellent."
"D: Nicely balanced albeit tastes are muted. It's very tasty, goes down extremely easily. This is one that I will be sure to pick up again."
"A touch sweet, but not out of the style. More hop would be nice."
"As the beer warms, the astringency becomes slightly less pronounced, with a tad more sweetness coming through, but overall, this is a seriously dry, crispy, herbal brew. The taste is much closer to a chardonnay, or pinot grigio, or possibly a wild fermented lambic. The flavors here are ones I usually wouldn't associate with a Belgian strong pale ale. Overall, a solid, and intriguing brew, I will be trying it again."
"All in all, I think this one will be a drain pour. Unless you like sour beers, do not try this one. Not very good unless you enjoy this type of brew."
"Update 2 Sep 12 - again on tap and really likey this beer, very well rounded Belgian ale."
"Overall impression: Would love to see more lively carbonation and a nice fluffy head, but this is a solid brew from Goose Island."
"Overall a very complex, yet balanced, beer that is very enjoable. Go and seek this one out."
"Very good Belgian clone. Geuss I could just drink a true Belgian but well done GI."
"D:Really quite drinkable. I like the Goose Island whatever series and this was a solid beer. To get it at happy hour made it worth while. For the price look to Duvel."
"Mouthfeel seemed to be pretty dry and slightly syrupy. A good combination - as it went down easy and I was wanting more but unable to partake in it at the time. Definitely something I would have again if it were available."
"Matilda is very flavorful beer, but right now it's a little too sweet, I think. The bottle is young, however. I want to see the Brett dry it out some."
"This is a good BSPA. An interesting interpretation of Orval. One of the better American version. Something I would recommend."
"D - This is a very good belgian style ale by Goose Island. There is a low abv and a nice flavor to it, making it easy to drink. It seems like this brewery takes on a lot of different styles and does them justice."
"Overall: I'm quite impressed by this Belgian Pale ale and will be looking for it again. Highly quaffable."
"OVERALL A solid, interesting beer that doesn't knock my socks off. I like the hop profile. Not as impressive as Pere Jacques."
"Lovely beer. Tasty too. Poured with a grand foamy, frothy off white head and great lace. Color is a medium amber. Aroma is very yeasty, malty, a little hop, and a bit vineous. Flav's the same but more full. Very good body and carbonation. Satisfying. Don't pick up much on the alcohol. Nicely balanced. Finish is good. Kind of on the border between a drinkable beer and a special. I'd imagine that would be ideal from the brewer's perspective. Whatever."
"So, I fell in love with this beer when I had it at Goose Island's pub in the spring of 2006. I remember it being a bit less brett driven and more banana esters in the nose, but that's not a bad thing. Overall, I enjoy this beer and I'm looking forward to trying some vintages I have in my cellar."
"D - i liked it at first, but the sweetness kind of wore on me. i was looking for a bit more of either the tart or funk that some people were reviewing."
"Cheers!"
"Another fine brew from the gang at Goose Island."
"Not bad, though I would like to try an older bottle to see if the brett comes out more and the flavors synch up a little better."
"Chewy body, with fruity notes of sweet apple cider and pear syrup giving way to a crisp, snappy twang from European hop varieties. Malts are downplayed a bit, but that's okay by me--there's definitely enough going on to keep my interest. Carbonation is lively and tight, spritzing up the back and sides of the palate, and allowing the hops to take hold for a bitter, tasty finish. Overall, another winner from Goose Island. Very drinkable at 7%, and surprisingly (well, maybe not) Matilda has held up well after almost a year and a half."
"I'd like a fresh bottle of this but you get what you get in MA."
"The single complaint I would put forth is that the yeast component isn't quite mature enough to fit the bill as a BSPA. However, the malt component of this beer holds a 7% ABV that tastes more like 10 and the brett really cuts through the yeast on its own. This is a wonderful beer, but it does lack the funky yeast component for its style, which is not really a bad thing here at all."
"Drinkability: It's not bad; the smell grew on me as it warmed, even though it was a bit mild; I typically prefer a much more robust set of flavors and smells from Belgian styles; overall I thought the mouthfeel was dull..."
"D: A good attempt from Goose Island to play with the Belgians with this Belgian-style beer. A great looking beer with an interesting profile, but as said before I would have liked a little more fruitiness and a little bit of acidity to make this beer more enjoyable."
"Delicious! What an unecpected surprise from Goose Island. I mean, they are great at producing Pale Ales and such, but I didn't expect such a fine Belgian knock-off from an American brewer. Taste was sweet and fresh and well balanced, with hints of orange, clove, and honey syrup. I had a few of these, and they tasted better as the beer warmed. I'm not sure I'd pay 13.99 for a 4-pack (what the corner liquor store is charging), but I'd definitely have this beer again."
"Who'll come a waltzing Matilda? Not me. I did not care much for Matilda, the swagman can have it."
"pretty sure I grabbed this single from Riley's in MSN during the last Great Taste visit"
"D: The ale feels heavier than 7%. I don't like how its held up over the past two years."
"This was a decent effort, but it didn't really connect for me. I'd have another, but I won't seek it out again."
"This is quite a drinkable beer, at 7% ABV it isn't overwhelming. I am definitely satisfied with one bomber though."
"T- Sweet, citrusy, slightly hoppy, funky."
"Drinkability, can I glom something from my kids texting? OMFG this is a smooth drinkable trippel that you could drink far into excess before you knew what hit you. I will buy mor, I will drink, Iwill obey..."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I will seek this one out the next time I'm at the store and stock up. Has a flavor profile and style that may benefit from storing and aging for a couple of years."
"freakin deliious. this is the best brew i've tasted in awhile...super classy"
"My bottle originated on 7/20/09. I'd like to try letting one age a year or two and see how this beer develops."
"Wonderful! ~"
"Sparkling clear, light amber with 2.5 inch off-white head with medium size bubbles and moderate lacing. The initial nose suggests a restrained Belgian ale with hints of clove and orange peel. The yeast sediment clings to the bottom of the bottle. I will swirl the next pour to capture some of the yeast if possible. The body is medium light with a very pleasant lingering. Vigorous swirling produced a very modest haze but increased the head and added some yeast notes. How much yeast are in these bottles? The Belgian ale characteristics are still restrained. The labels suggest that the ale will develop in the bottle for up to five years. Perhaps I am sipping this too soon? It was bottled in March of this year."
"This is a ""Blue Moon"" style beer, but far superior. Nice head (especially on a second pour) and an inviting, mild, fruit and citrus scent. Not much hops in the taste, but even a hop-savorer can appreciate the malt-sustained clove-cardamon-apricot flavor. The sweet, pleasant aftertaste fades nicely and keeps you thirsting for more. Good job Goose Island."
"I actually had a BMC drinking friend try this on tap and he loved it. It's opened his eyes to the world of craft beer."
"Very well balanced and drinkable. Mellow, but tasty beer."
"12oz bottle in my Bell's tulip. Pours honey-golden, opaque, glowing, with plenty of carbonation and head/lacing. Smells, banana, cinnamon, maybe some citrus. Taste is less fruity, more rich, malty sweetness. Surprisingly full-bodied. Highly drinkable even at 7%."
"Poured from the bottle into a Chimay chalice, Matilda (2009) is a perfectly clear amber-orange color with a thin, slightly active head. The nose is fruity with pears and white grapes; there is also a strong clovey spice presence. The taste is a nice malty complexity of the aforementioned flavors, bittered to balance but no real hop presence. The alcohol is pretty well covered by the spiciness and Muscat grapiness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a thin yet chewy carbonation, the finish is slightly dry. Overall a very drinkable beer, the alcohol is well covered and although there is a slight sweetness to the beer, it is well balanced enough that it does not interfere with the drinkability. Definitely worth trying."
"T- Would be a good orange peel. This is just to citrusy for my likes. Malt mixed in which just give me a more confused taste."
"Drinkability: This to me is unfortunately a sub-par imitation of a strong Belgian ale. It has the right tastes and aromas but they are far too weak and never seem to quite break through enough."
"As for taste it is very yeasty and biscuit like almost sort of chewy medium-heavy mouthfeel in this . but the taste also has some other spices to it and just a mild tart taste to it , very very complex beer , probably one of the most complex beers I've had very drinkable although it does leave a bit of a wet finish in your mouth with a yeasty sweet after taste , eat some dry food with this, but it's a must try."
"This beer pours a cloudy red-orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within seconds into minimal lacing. The aroma is of some malt and some yeast, but is very subdued especially for the style. The taste is much the same, but with a strong nasty vomit like thing that I guess is most likely the yeast. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is hard to drink. I will not be drinking this again."
"D - Definitely a beer I could drink all night. It left me wanting another one. It was excellent with the fish, one of those moments that will make me remember the pairing and try to repeat it."
"It's possible that this 2009 variety is still too young and needs a little more time to condition. I will revisit."
"One of my favorite Goose Island beers, along with Bourbon County Stout and Harvest Ale."
"D: Refreshing fruity and tasty. Great beer for a hot day, or for getting warm by a campfire. Easily approachable, and good for belgian beginners."
"drinkability is ok but there are much better choices in this style"
"Matilda Belgian Style Ale is an aberration from the other Goose Island beers I have tried."
"[MBY-AGE/1x;NT-aged]"
"Notes: At first this beer wasn't tasting too good to me, but it grew on me. Tastes almost like a lambic. I'm not sure if my bottle was a little undercarbonated, but compared to some other reviews it seemed to not be as light and had little head. However, it was a very interesting beer."
"D - Easy to drink, could do a lot of these, especially considering the 7% it's holding."
"Matilda may very well become one of my staple purchases. A great appearance, an alluring smell, easy drinkability and an excellent taste, all of this makes this beer a must try."
"This not a belgian strong pale ale, I'll go with an American Pale Ale. Its a complete sessional, I could crush many of these. It tastes light hoppy and citrus, very ok, nothing special."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. Pretty spot on for the style. A good one to sip on when the weather is warm."
"Overall this is a nice BSPA but it could use a bit more complexity. Still, it's solid and worth a shot."
"I don't know why, but I'm too big of a fan of this. It reminds me of Flat Earth Belgian Pale Ale too much, which I wasn't a huge fan of. There are plenty better Goose Island brews."
"2008 poured into a chalice,this beer is amber with a nice head. honestly,i'm not too impressed with this beer.i think because it's a year old.tastes like a watered down dubbel.smell is slightly nutty,reminds me of bbq sauce quite honestly. mouthfeel and carbonation are kinda meh,drinkablity is below average.im going to have to get a fresher bottle i think."
"D - A wholly enjoyable brew. I love the fruit character here. I agree with the label in that this brew would be great with mussels, and it would make a great complement to a rustic pork pate or a fresh goat's milk cheese."
"A pretty good american belgian style."
"D - Goes down great, almost too quick - though you wouldn't want more than a couple of these in one session."
"Very good beer, though I have to say Wild Devil is the best brett-brewed beer I've had in recent years. This is plenty good, though. I'd like to age it and see if the brett character comes out more over time."
"Aroma of banana is very strong with vanilla and hints of nutmeg and allspice. Taste of rum n' raisin, banana, clove and a tart, sour fruit finish that lingers and conjures up images of rotting peach. Underlying tartness is matched by a smooth, creamy, dense and even texture, the rich and full bodied mouthfeel is quite exceptional. Alcohol well in sych. This strikes me as an ideal and luxurious after dinner drink to savour ... and then savour some more."
"3 d not as interesting or flavorful as hoped. and overpriced."
"Taste is funky, with an acidic tartness. Slightly sour fruit is present. A green apple like flavor. Light spice in the background. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little lighter than I would prefer. The finish is dry. Nice for a summer day with the tartness. Not bad, but not really my thing with the sourness."
"Clear translucent golden orange color with a frothy white head that leaves a nice crown and some spots of lacing. Spicy and sweet, belgian yeast, some fruitiness, clove, candy sugar. Taste is very nice balance between the spice, yeast and fruit. Medium body with very high carbonation makes this very light in the mouth. Starts slightly fruity and sweet with belgian yeast before a slightly bitter finish with peppery spice. Very nice, well done beer, but seems a little overpriced around here to prevent me from picking up anymore regularly."
"D: Pretty good, ABV is low enough to have a couple, but I moved on after one."
"D- easy to finish my glass but then it was onto something else. something i like to check out every so often. much different on tap than i remember the bottle."
"D- Would love to drink this all night long."
"Bacon beer! Umami! Smokey, meaty, almost soy-like - miso paste with bacon... This is an intense beer. It was a beautiful dark brown. It was also night-time in a dimly lit bar so don't quote me on the color. I'm going to say deep caramel verging toward blackness. The smell was salty and pungent. It had also just been tapped about three hours before I started to drink it - fresh as fresh can be! The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and silky. This was a beer to sit with and to ponder. It could have used a cheese plate. This is not a beer for simple quaffing. This is a thought-provoking ale that requires the right setting. I was unprepared for the fullness and slight weirdness of this beer. I would like to try this again under other conditions."
"But, as is right now...this is a quality beer."
"M: A lot of CO2 (trippel) pretty creamy"
"An interesting and enjoyable beer. The carbonation and alcohol are balanced well, the flavor is superb."
"Drinkable beer, but I don't know if I'd try to kill a growler of it without help."
"Drinkability: thin enough to go down quickly."
"D: Complex, yeasty, balanced, 7.0% seems well hidden. Overall very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Goose Island's take on a Belgian strong pale is pretty good, but not quite there yet. The flavor is great, with no weak points, but I've got to fault it big time for the minimal carbonation--that's just not very Belgian!"
"Drinkability- Unanimously we rated this beer to be highly drinkable. Definitely will have another."
"Mouthfeel: Feels oily and slick in the mouth, but that is countered by a moderate amount of carbonation. Feels pretty thick."
"08- Way more of a mild nose, more fruit however, wheaty, less Belgian in overall character, i would score the 08 (currently) with a B-"
"Had this on tap while visiting Goose Island in Wrigleyville. Had a copperish color and not much head. It smelled of citrus and spice. The taste matched that and there was an underlying sweetness as well. While the hops were certainly present the sweetness put it just outside of my ideal taste. Still nicely balanced and I am sure most people will rate it higher than I did."
"Served in a Chimay chalice, Matilda poured a reddish-amber with the thickest, fluffiest head I've seen in a long time. Sweet aroma. Taste is Belgian sweetness balanced well with a dry hoppiness. Very easy drinking; I wish this was a beer we could get in Connecticut on a regular basis."
"Goose Island Matilda poured a very nice full amber, with good lacing, but lost some points because it had almost no head. Smell was full of yeast, some hints of sweetness, and citrus. The taste was full of spice, citrus, but also some sweet hints. Many waves of flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel was ok a bit thick, and drinkability was good for the style. Overall this is a very nice beer with excellent flavor and balance."
"M&D: a very well-made Belgian Ale all in all - the balance is solid, the body remains intact, the yeastiness is moderate (never overpowering), the texture is soothing and soft, and all in all it drinks absolutely light without noticeable hints of alc., almost quaffable even. ""Slightly quiet yet integrated"" is my overall impression of this Goose Island's take on Belgian amber ale, but the drinkability is very good all the same."
"After the very first sip, I couldnt help but be surprised by the b+ that Ms. Matilda was carrying. I can't think of a beer that has been this pleasing to me in a long time. I am not calling it the best beer I have ever had by any means, but of the genre, it is top notch. The taste is calm but complex, the smell is not over powering, its 7% is very well disguised and to top things off, I could drink this beer all summer long. Paired with some fresh fruit and soft cheese, this would be all i need until september"
"Excellent sipper, leaving one wanting a bigger snifter to be served. I could drink this all day long on a warm afternoon."
"Really nice atmosphere. Solid appearance, and truly pleasing nose. Not complex, but nice flavor balance. The sweetness and the bite works. Light feel, but full bodied. Great quaff."
"Mouthfeel is quite enjoyable. Medium body that is pleasantly drinkable. Good carbonation makes this one more than a just a sipper."
"Overall a pretty solid Belgian-style pale. It's no Duvel, but it's no slouch either. Glad I got the chance to try this one."
"On-tap at Stub and Herb's in Minneapolis, served in a tallish Matilda goblet. The beer appeared a bit hayt and red-amber with a light tan head. With a great appearance like that, I was let down by a fairly plain, Fat Tire-esqe flavor of sweet caramel malts and only a hint of Belgian spice. The CO2 also didn't do this beer any favors, the large bubble made this drink more like a smooth American amber than Belgian pale ale."
"Thanks to Timmi for throwing in a couple of these to his package. Matilda pours a dark orange, with a half finger of white heading. Aroma is one of the more interesting ones that I have run in to in a while. I get some chalky esters, alcohol, some pear and a medicinal smell. Low and behold, smell is pretty much the exact same as the taste. The feel is light, maybe bordering on medium, and much hotter than was expected. It definitely leaves you feeling a bit buzzed. Matilda has some very interesting qualities that I have not found in many other beers. That being said, I don't think I would go for more than one in a sitting. Worth a try at the very least for fans of Belgian beers. Cheers"
"Overall, a spectacular contribution to the style... more than I hoped for and expected when I found a few dusty four-packs on the grocery store shelf back in Iowa."
"D - Very refreshing and not too overwhelming. Medium bodied."
"D- Even though i'm not a huge fan of the style, i enjoyed this one quite a bit. Very balanced and easy to sip on."
"Overall - A top notch Belgian pale ale.... as good as a lot the Belgian ones i've tried... recommended..."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Even though I thought it would have a little more ""funk", based on the reviews that I read, I liked it just the way it is. A beer that demands your attention, and yet will reward you for it. Cheers."
"D= smooth and nice but I sont know how much I can do of it. The fruitiness is quite intense with pears which is odd to me but not bad for a beer I guess. Just different."
"D-Pretty decent drinkability. Flavors are very smooth, pretty complex, and fun and easy to drink. A pretty nicely-balanced brew, which seems to be what G.I. was going for here."
"through North Central Ohio, this is most likely the best beer out there, 50+ a case, ball hard--its worth it, i am a believer"
"just a grand beer. understated how good this is. why haven't I tried this before? holy god, it has the best aspects of an IPA, Tripel, Belgian. just so drinkable."
"The taste is quite good. There are slight sherry like flavors, some nice orange rind, some peppery spices, some sweet citrus flavors too. There is a bit of a bite to the beer, although it is very smooth and sweet. The beer is not creamy but more liqueur like in its consistency. The beer is not overly complex, and for that I'm going to detract a point or two. There isn't enough of an overlay between the spices, the sweet malts, the candied sugars, and the Belgian yeastiness to get this one going into a higher level. It is very drinkable, very enjoyable, but complex to the point of challenging the palate, this beer is not. A good find, worth seeking out."
"Belgian spice aroma with a hint of funk that turns must as the beer warms. Flavor has a quick hit of the brett funk but finishes clean. A very well made beer that is very easy to enjoy."
"Poured 2009 12oz Matilda into a shaped pint glass. Pours a super-rich beautiful amber-orange color with a frothy little head. Very clear, smells of rich Belgian yeast, banana and apples. Kind of fruity tasting not as yeasty as it smells. Little bit of alcohol warmth and a leathery finish. Nice full mouthfeel, but it just lacks something in the flavor. It's kind of boring, very drinkable but not very memorable. Dang...."
"This is an easy drinker but tends to go better with a meal vs on it's own. I have it on occassion but every time it sounds great when I start, but by the time I'm done I'm ready for something different."
"Overall--I'm not overwhelmed by the complexity of the taste, and the 7% abv peeks through a bit too much, in my opinion, but the mouthfeel and aroma make it well worth a try. Definitely fairly enjoyable."
"d: Thanks to imperialking for this treat."
"D: I tell you with a mouthfeel like that, this brew is absolutely drinkable. So crisp and clean it goes down super easy. It sits pretty light in the belly with just a touch of that alcohol heat. This beer is disappearing quickly. The flavors and aromas are well done and further add to the enjoyability of this brew. I hyped this one up in my mind and the experience was not a let down in the least. Really enjoyed this brew and I am glad I seeked it out."
"This a damn good beer. So true to the original style, could have been brewed in Belgium. Yummy!!"
"D - Even at 7%, very drinkable. I was excited about this offering and enjoyed it even more than expected."
"Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is fine. A pretty good beer, but not worthy of the price. I would not necessarily recommend, though I would happily drink another if offered."
"D) A strong American Ale, not the Belgian it would like to be."
"Overall.The mouth feel is carbonated and lightly spicy. The body of the beer is medium and finish is dry and slightly bitter. The 2006 beer is lighter in body and less of a head. The 2008 has more of a head that is creamy and rocky. The 2008 has more spice but is not as refined as the 2006. Both of the years has it pros and cons."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The color is light orange, very light copper color. The beer produces a nice size head that doesn't seem to go away very fast at all and which leaves a great lace down the glass. The smell is fruity and yeasty, has a pretty good smell to it. The taste is great. Fruity, sweet and just a little bitterness. I haven't had to many Belgians but from the ones I've tried I think this one compares pretty good. I think Goose Island definitely did a great job on this one."
"Personally I wasn't too impressed with this one. It just seemed to be missing something."
"D - Even at 7%, very drinkable. I was excited about this offering and enjoyed it even more than expected."
"D: Slightly high ABV not detected at all. Sweetness kinda limits this to just one for me. Very nice beer, going to the beer store today, and picking some up."
"D - This was a very easy beer to drink with its good taste wish I could of had more of this beer than just one bottle worth the effort to get"
"D: Very good, I wish I had more. Definitely something that is worthy of being aged. I'll have to try a fresh Matilda for comparison now...but this was excellent."
"D: I am not the biggest fan of Belgian ales but this is a really nice brew. I'd be happy to have it again and I'd love to try it at Goose. I would also be interested to see how this flavor manifests itself over time."
"Notes: By far my favorite Goose Island offering and superior to the similarly marketed, labeled, Pere Jacques (at least the labels emulate one another). Great job!"
"Overall, this beer is over-advertised/hyped."
"Upon pouring this into a pint glass, the body is dark burnt yellow with a two/three finger head. It smells a tad bit sweet, with a light barley aroma. The taste is refreshing and not too much alcohol that comes through despite the 7.00% abv. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and gives off pleasurable tones to your palate. Overall, it is a very good beer, but for some reason I expected it to be even better. Perhaps it is because Goose Island produces such high quality ""common styles"" such as their IPA among the rest. Still a very good beer."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for a strong ale. Intersting comlex flavor and very good CO2 and hop balance make this an easy choice."
"Courtesy of brewczar. 12oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Bottled on 01/10/2008. Poured a hazy burnt orange with a golden hue. Two inch tight, white head sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a solid skim with a dense target of foam in the middle. Curtains of lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Detected some citrus (lemon zest) and yeast in the nose, as well as a spicey quality. Taste revealed many of the same characteristics of the nose, as well as malt, grass, candi sugar, maybe allspice, as well as light fruit (green apple and perhaps pear). Mouthfeel is slightly short of medium-bodied with a lively character and some acidity that burned the edges of my chapped lips. Excellent and well-balanced example of the style. Nice and flavorful without the booziness sometimes present."
"This beer has been aged since 2007."
"All in all a good beer, still impressed with most of the Goose Island premium beers I have tried."
"For 7% it doesn't show. Highly drinkable for the abv. I would certainly drink it again. I'd love to try it on tap."
"This is really a very good beer and I would recommend it. I had it on tap at Roman's in Milwaukee."
"Light-medium bodied. Carbonation is pretty good but the mouthfeel is somewhat thin."
"I really enjoyed this beer, something to drink on a hot summer day."
"I like this one quite a bit but can't help thinking that the ones I had last year were even better. Maybe my tastes have changed. In either case, this is a very nice Belgian style pale."
"D- Although it is pretty high in alcohol, I can put a few of these away in a night. It's pretty thin, but has excellent flavor and the carbonation lets it flow right down the hatch. A great beer."
"2007 bottle. Giant head with some rockiness, pours golden brown with sediment. Aroma is the standard belgian yeast with some slight fruity sweetness that I can't put my finger on. Citrus maybe? Also some slight spice character deep in the aroma. Flavor is more fruit than in the aroma, definite citrus and tropical fruits. Yeast and is in there typical of a belgian. Some spice I can't put my finger on. Finish is a little dry and pretty refreshing making it very drinkable (I'm almost halfway done with this bottle) All in all another quality brew from GI."
"pretty drinkable. i would drink this again. not sure that i would go out of my way to get some but if the opportunity did happen to arise i would take it up."
"Slightly cloudy, coppery in color. Nice off-white lasting head. Smells of bananas, wheat bread, and general Belgian-ness. Taste hits what they were going for, as an American version of a BSPA. mild Euro hops, sugar, Belgian qualities. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both slightly above average."
"Conclusion: Complex, drinkable, perfectly balanced...this is a spot-on American representation of a classic Belgian style...G.I. has done it again!"
"There's actually a good bit of sweetness that took me a while to pick up, perhaps it just didn't go well with dinner. But that (tropical?) fruitiness is quickly overtaken by a strong bitter hop flavor, which then yields to crisp finish."
"D- I have passed this by so many times, and it is just too bad. A very enjoyable Belgian. Way to go Goose Island."
"Ok beer."
"Copper colored with a slight haziness. One finger head that fades rather quickly to a light skim. Some spotty lacing present. Smells of esters - banana, clove and a muted sweetness characteristic of Belgians - blind I might say this smells more like a Hefeweizen. Taste is not too appealing - very lacking in flavor. Some faint carryover from the nose with cloves and a hint of sweetness. Thin palate, decent carbonation and okay drinkability. I was expecting a lot more from this beer - maybe it needs some aging - I won't waste the space on it to find out. Good thing it came in a 4-pack and not a 6-pack."
"Sampled Matilda at the Oregon Brewers Fest in Portland. It pours a nice head but with little lacing and offers the palate a subtle taste of brown sugar. As a Belgian, it finds a pleasant equilibrium of malt and sugar without the expected cloyingness. And yet, I could not grasp the complexity - unlike many other Belgians I have tried. The Matilda is good for about two quaffs - not a sessional beer."
"This drinks decently for ABV - a nice sipping beer for style. Good complexity and craftmanship from da Gooze."
"2011 bottling, (bottled 12/22/11; tasted on 3/17/12)....better head retention and lacing (bumped the appearance up .5); not only is the Juicy Fruit back, but there is a basket of strawberries in the aroma, as well; very fruity, with a more refined tartness (bumped up the taste by .5); better carbonation (also bumped up the mouthfeel .5)...this is a really nice beer"
"This is a good beer, yet showcases a true example of a Belgian BSPA vs an American BSPA.Try this one next to a La Chouffe, Duvel, Delerium Tremens, and see what I mean. This is an excellent beer, and my point is to compare/contrast a traditional vs newer twist style of beer. Really a good experience and I will drink this whenever avaliable"
"Pours a hazy golden amber color,with one finger of white foamy head.Smells of ginger,cloves,grass,yeast,and dried fruits.Flavor of peaches,orange peel,allspice,nutmeg,coriander,sweet caramel malt,and some hop notes. A sticky mouthfeel,soft carbonation,and a dry fruity finish. Very Good,nice balance of flavors and nicely drinkable."
"The balance and great taste of this beer would obviously make it drinkable, but I was still surprised by how fast I managed to down one. Very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is full and smooth."
"M/D - Medium bodied, verging on full. Very chewy feel throughout. Well carbonated but not too much. Excellent feel to the beer."
"taste is wonderful. light on the palate but full of flavor. It is nice and sweet, unexpectedly sweet for a belgian strong pale ale. it has a great balance of malty sweetness and hoppy flavor mixed together, i think that is what makes this beer stand out nicely."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a orangish amber with a big, fluffy white head that left just slight traces of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fruity. Tart green apples, plums, dates, and what reminds me of an odd saltiness, like that found in the nose of a gose (just less so). The flavor is also filled with fruity esters, with apples leading the forefront. There is a slight kiss of hops in the flavor but they add just more of a vague bitterness to it. Also brown sugar, and what is a slight sweet cream are also present. The mouthfeel is light, with just a bit of fine carbonation. This is another very good beer by Goose Island. I will definitely be buying another 4 pack next year."
"Drinkability: An interesting and unique brew, a solid offering from Goose Island, and a drinkable one at that - 7.0% abv, low for the style. I'd put this right at the middle of the pack as far as the GI limited/seasonal releases go - about on par with the Imperial IPA, better than the Demolition, and slightly below the BCS and the Pere Jacques. This would pair well with a spicy dish, Thai food perhaps, or a strong cheese that could hold its own against the phenols in this one. Recommended."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. I am sad that this is my last one. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Overall- An incredible beer that I wish we could get ahold of down here in Louisiana. My former boss at Southern Eagle who gave me this beer can help with that! (Hint, hint Trey!) Goose Island did a great job recreating a Belgian beer."
"This is a good beer, but the yeast strain just doesn't jive with my palate I don't think. I don't mind funk by any means but this has a bit of a funkiness to it that I'm not wild about. Pretty good beer, but not one of my personal favorites."
"D: I enjoy Belgians and this one is quite mild. It is easy to drink."
"Overall I'm glad I got to try it...alcohol is there but not overpowering....nice and sweet but not too sweet. I'm glad I got the chance to try this."
"Pours a cloudy light-honey color, dense but quickly fading foamy tan head, fades into a nice swirly layer atop the beer, stray spots of lacing inside the glass. Soft sugary aroma, pepper and spice. I get some vanilla flavor, pear, and oddly enough, there's something here that reminds me of the one and only time I ever ate breadfruit. Some light pepper flavor comes through on the back end. This is beautiful. Refreshing, lively carbonation....just a really nice beer, and if it were available in my neck of the woods, this would make its way to the dinner table often."
"Overall, an easy beer to drink. Though it starts out strongly sweet, Matilda dries out quickly and gracefully. The sweet, fruity, and spicy components fit together quite well to create a beer which is vividly flavored but not overpowering. Citric acidity and moderate carbonation cut through a body which would tend towards heavy without them. A fine example of a Belgian-style pale ale."
"Nicely done! If your a fan of belgian styles in general check it out. The only down side, compared to it's Belgian conterparts, is it doesn't stand to warming up as well."
"D- Good drinkability. It's a nice sipper, but the great flavor had me drinking it more quickly than it deserves. While I may not seek this one out, I'd definitely drink it again."
"D: An interesting and tasty beer from Goose Island. I wish I had easy access to another bottle, check it out if you see it."
"Well done for the style and very tasty but the carbonation makes if difficult to drink more than one."
"Pours a crystal clear, burnt orange color with a nice, semi-thick, somewhat-fluffy, white head., which doesn't leave great lace or stick around too long. Immediately smells of nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar. The taste is similar with a strong syrup texture to it. It is definitely a Belgian beer with an American twist. Pretty good beer, but I fell it is still missing something, nothing particular, but something is keeping it from becoming a truly outstanding drink. Nevertheless, it is still wonderful."
"Very nice-somewhat orangey color. Solid malty aroma with a good level of yeastiness and phenols. Great, great malty taste. Maybe just a tad sweet. Great hop bite and a very pleasant yeasty flavor. Finish is great-none to sweet or dry. Good solid mouthfeel-the fullness lasts thru the entire taste of the beer. Very, very drinkable beer. A great session beer if it wasnt as high abv wise. I could do this on a very regular basis."
"Drinkability: Good but I think it is not that great for the price."
"The price is a bit high on this one, but worth it, a fantastic example of the style for an American microbrewery."
"Drinkability- Not the easiest drinker in the world. Not that smooth, sweet, but not a Belgian that I want to come back to."
"Drinkability: A beautiful and flavorful beer. Right at that cusp of ABV where it may age well. I might set one in the cellar an try it in a few years."
"This beer poured a clear reddish gold color and formed a small foamy white heat that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, slight funkiness of grass, coriander and other spices. The flavor was of malt, candy like bubblegum and other sweetness. The body is medium light and the finish is tart."
"Been waiting to try Matilda for a while, now. Thanks to swnicholson!! Poured into an affligem goblet. Pours a slightly hazed golden color witha huge champagne like head. Smells of some light bready yeasts but mostly belgain sweet yeast and some spices. Taste threw me a bit. Expecting a light flavor i get a ton of spice, a very sharp mouthfeel and some funk. I get more of the sour flavor as the beer warms as well. What a great treat! I want some more!"
"Drinkability, a real treat."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass"
"Final Thought: What a treat on tap this one is! Goose Island should be proud to call this an American micro brew, this is clearly their best to date!"
"Pours a dark amber in color. There's a ginormous three inch head on the pour. Looks great in my Duvel glass. Smell is spicy and yeasty. A little bit of spice in the taste. Very creamy and full in the mouthfeel. A bit of hops in the flavor as well. Not overly complex."
"Authentic like."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, fruity, candy sugar, and a small hop presence. In the taste, nice fruitiness, with a nice mellow hop presence. A small hoppy and medium mouthfeel, and a dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice hop presence, easy to drink and quite nice."
"pours a crisp copper tone, similar to ice tea. nice head some lace as it decented. great nose. sweet ester of fruit, mainly pear. like earthy wood. every light, with cirtus. may be from american hops or actual cirtus fruit. taste is good, more subdued. more assertive hop, more cirtus, less earth than indicated in nose but some bay leaves possibly yet not as herbal as expected. surprisingly crisp. i don't know if thats a good thing. seems like it would be for seafood. probably opens up in flavor in the cellar."
"Pours a deep hazy golden orange with a huge fluffy white head that lingers for ages leaving big sheets of lacing. Aroma is fairly subtle and consists of biscuity malts and citrus, including some tart lemon notes. There's also the underlying Belgian yeasts and spices in the end. The taste is a slightly sweeter version of the nose with the aforementioned Belgian yeasts coming to the forefront and a much stronger fruity sweetness than the nose, with a hint of bananas in there. There is also some spices in the finish with a slight hop presence as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation and leaves the tongue tingling after ever sip. This is a great Belgian from Goose Island and one that I look forward to trying again. Highly recommended!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle marked with a bottled on date of 102407 into a pint glass. Appearance is a rusty-hued coppery color, slightly hazy with a thin finger of white head that gradually fell back to a heavy ring of glass-clinging lace. Aroma is huge sweet biscuity punch right up front, graininess and dark fruit notes also present. Taste begins tart, juicy green apples, bread and yeast flavors, has an odd quality about it, almost musty. Leaves a slightly drying lightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lower levels of carbonation, goes down smooth. Drinkability is nothing special, beer has a nice balance and complexity about it, would likely smooth to an easier drinking beer within the next five years without issue."
"Copper tone, soft, gentle head, crisp bite. I dig. Honey hangs for a bit, contrasted by its foe, clove, handed over to its similiar buddies herb and spice. Banana and wheat make an appearance with a faint note of vanilla. Alcohol aint home and sweet tart spoons cracker dry upstairs. I dig."
"Drinkability: Good. If you like Belgians.... you'll like this. Right on style. At 7% abv.... this one ain't gonna put you under too fast... have a few."
"Drinks pretty good, this one grew on me, I'm not a huge brett fan, but I could do a few of these before moving on, Brett fans will enjoy even more IMO. Agree with some other reviewers, seems more saisin than Belgian PA"
"Draft at Goose Island Clybourn brewpub. A clear light gold, little head or carbonation. Light yeast aroma. Flavour is rich, sweet, but not overly sweet. Lightly spiced. Medium bodied. Some light hops as it goes down the throat. Not as complex as I like my Belgians."
"An authentic take on a Belgian pale. If you like the style or want to introduce someone to it - this is as good as an import, and it's cheaper/fresher to boot."
"Always happy to find another keeper. Pours a light tawny, with somehat soapy white head. Good lacing. Bits of fruity rind and clove in the odor, more subtle in the taste dept. Some hop presence, but predominantly sweet. Not cloying - never goes into that territory. Somewhat reminisicent of Orval. Smooth sipper that keep the ABV at a respectable 7%. I'd prefer this beer in a bomber, but that said, do not find the 4.00 price tag to be extravagant in the least. Definate repeat purchase."
"OVerall a really nice belgian pa with brett. Creamy smooth mouthfeel and the drinkability is nice. A slow sipper, but great to have in-hand."
"D--Smooth and very drinkable at 7%. Thought ABV was lower!"
"Overall it is hard to get excited about this beer. Nothing wrong with it but others do it so much better."
"M/D: Rich, the carbonation is almost... fuzzy, rather than fizzy. Over the tongue like a furry peach. Medium body, a nice tangerine flavour left behind, finishes rather clean and pleasant. A very easy ""semi-sipper"" I found myself going through this quite quickly. An excellent beer, and something I hope to find again (or have another glass of when coming back this way!)"
"I thought it was a fine beer for a Belgian clone and would drink it again"
"D: Unfortunately my other bottle is in a cellar!"
"(This product has aged very, very well.)"
"Poured a great cloudy yellow/orange color with great head and excellent lacing. It had a wonderful scent, very sweet with straw scents, along with a great banana scent. Excellent taste, a great sweet start with some nice hoppy balance, a delicate clove and banana flavor with lemon zest undertones. Went down fantastically smooth. Probably one of the best American made belgian strong ales I've had."
"Good beer, great for when a high ABV is desired w/o all of the heaviness it usually comes with."
"A solid Belgian Pale Ale."
"D - this is a nice brew to consume during the the warm summer months, but the alc% might cut you off sooner than your ready if your not careful."
"The beer pours a copper colour that appears to be golden near the bottom of the glass. The head was a decent centimeter that left fairly quickly. The nose of the beer has fruits, sweetness, and some spices. The beer has lots of flavour, from the dark fruits like plums to a few spices. The complexity to this beer is quite more than I expected. You can taste a bit of the alcohol, but I really don't taste any hops, but there is a bitterness to it. Lots of flavours I can't really pin down either. The mouthfeel is creamy with a nice bite from the carbonation. The beer is okay in the drinkablility department."
"D- pretty damn solid"
"Recommended..."
"I'm happy that this beer has finally made it to the bars in the Twin Cities. Served on tap, this pours a hazy amber color, with a small white head and ample white lacing on the glass. The smell is of tart apples, with a small hint of sourness. The taste is fruity, with raisins, plums, and a tart apple flavor predominating. There is a (not unpleasant)dryness to the flavor as well. The mouthfeel is appropriately rich and flavorful. Drinkability is only marred by the relatively high alcohol content(7,2%abv) and the slightly sour smell. All in all, this is a good Belgian Strong Ale."
"Notes: Well, it doesn't hold a candle to Orval, but comparisons aside this is good."
"Pours a hazy apricot amber color with light white lacing. Light aroma of yeast. Lots of yeast in the taste, plus light fruits and cloves. Yeasty aftertaste. Smooth and medium-bodied with light tingly carbonation. A simple, but enjoyable, implementation of this style."
"Goose Island Matilda pours a deep amberish copper with a fluffy rather large bubble head. The smell is strong of yeast with a touch of citrus in the back. Taste is very yeasty and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and the yeast bubbles just explode with a swish. It's really quite unique to feel the brew go straight from a liquid state to a mouthfull of bubbles. If you like highly carbonated, yeasty beers this might be worth a try, unfortuantely this really isn't my style of drinking."
"Tasted on 4/24/08."
"The flavor up front was of Belgian spices and mild fruit. A slight bread-like quality also present. A citrus hop bite is subtle but effective in creating a cohesive and flavorful experience. Overall this is an interesting and great tasting beer. Mouthfeel is full and carbonated. Very nice farmhouse ale from Goose Island."
"I love the farmhouse Belgians, and you could pour me a pint of one of these and I'd be absolutely delighted and fooled into thinking it was an import. Goose Island just keeps doing me right. Wish they were easier to track down out in this neck of the woods."
"Definitely drinkable. Not my favorite belgain style ale but my favorite offering from Goose Island so far. nice brew."
"Way overcarbonated, a bit of a gusher. Poured a hazy gold with a massive head. When it settled down, I got some citrus and a slight sourness (brett?) in the aroma. Medium bodied with some fruit and spice. Slightly sour finish. I had this on tap over Spring break at Clybourn and this was totally different. I preferred the tap version."
"Drinkability is very good for a strong Belgian pale. The smoothness on this ale makes it very easy on the tongue."
"D - An easy drinking beer when you have it, but the alcohol sneaks up on me too hard to be a session beer. It doesn't really fit the idea of a ""change of pace"" beer for me since its flavor isn't all that strong."
"A good stab at the style, but when you've got monks doing this for centuries to compete with, a good attemp is the best you can hope for."
"Very drinkable. The belgian stalwarts are here but are not as robust as other examples. No bonus points here for complexity but a solid brew nonetheless."
"D- Wow. I love this brew. Drinkable and nice but not for sessioning. I think this is my favorite from GI."
"12 ounce bottle. Orangish color with a small head. What a strange beer! The aroma is fruity, but somehow unlike any fruit I've eaten. It's sort of like fruit mixed with candy and ginger. Some wine-like grape flavors are present. Slightly tart, but still candy-like in it's tartness. Finishes with spices, including cinnamon and ginger. This beer left me confused and thirsty. Still not sure if I like it or not. It's certainly an interesting beer."
"D: only one, maybe not even that, not very impressed by this ""pale ale"""
"D-overall not impressed not something i would reach for on a regular basis"
"D-Thumbs up! A world class beer."
"Poured into an oversized tulip glass with a rich golden color and decent amount of white head remaining along the side of the glass. Smell was very full of spices and bubble gum. Taste is floral and strong on the belgian spices with some coriander shining through. Mouth feel was sparkling and crisp. Very nice strong pale ale."
"D- sincerely impressed by one of my favorite breweries, i never expected these hop connoisseurs to go belgian, but they did, and i gotta thank em for it. not an everyday beer of course, or even one to drink in session-- that would diminish its majesty, but i want another one right now and i can't cuz i have to go to work :("
"Interesting aroma, with a hint of funkiness and tartness along with some citric hops and malty sweetness, that unfortunately does not translate well into the beer. Nice carbonation, but it lacks depth, and there is very little complexity between the noticeable hops and malts. Pleasant, but I was disappointed."
"D: Extremely drinkable, nicely complex, one of my favorites. (4.75)"
"Crisp and bright but then immediately fades to starchy and rather fluffy. Short lived carbonation with a fine bubble structure. Some faint warmth and a starchy, buttery feel that lingers on the tongue. Tasty and refreshing. Very enjoyable"
"drinkabliity is good. this brew comes in at 7% APV, so the alcoholic tinge makes sense, making this one a great sipping brew. another great offering from Goose Island. cheers!"
"Rich honey colored pour with no lasting head. Pours somewhat hazy. Smell is malty and belgian yeast aromas and some metal. Average unremarkable flavor mostly from the yeast and some simple light maltiness. Really found this one especially tame and bland, even being congested as I was."
"I had this on tap at the Barelhead,it poured a nice looking hazy light orange with a thick head that left lots of lacing.The nose was packed full of bubble gum,fruits and spice.Complexity is an understatement,this has lots of fruit (peaches come to mind)followed by malts and a hoppy citrus blend that balance nicely,with lots of cloves and yeast very apparent in every sip.Matilda,what an ugly name,but this lady is a brick house!"
"Very enjoyable, but I thought one was enough for this sitting. I would love to have it another time though, and I will certainly buy the bottles. This would be a good Belgian-style beer for people who think don't like them too big and too boozy. The abv is reasonable, and the flavors are not too extreme in any area."
"A very nice drinking Belgian, very smooth on-tap."
"The taste has a certain fullness to it that is mouthcoating and slightly creamy in consistency. The beer is lightly sweet as well, which up-plays the fruity citrus character that is here. The hop character is not near as pronounced as I would have hoped for, but it is present with a bit of lingering bitterness in the finish and of course some spicy-citrusy hop notes up front. The beer is quite smooth, and the Brett character is still quite light in the finish. There is a hint of mustiness and a bit of dry cobweb-type thing that lingers in the finish, and a light dusting of funk in the rest of the beer. This is quite drinkable, but does not quite hit the complexity level of the original. We will have to see how this changes with time."
"Very drinkable. Shit, if it didn't cost $2.25 apiece, I'd probably share it with other people. For now though, screw 'em; this is all mine."
"D- This is a very nice drinking Belgian. Not crazy over-powering like some Belgians. Definitely could drink a few glasses."
"D - Not bad. Was hoping for more of a hop bite, but would dring anytime as an alternative to a belgian golden."
"Drinkability: I purchased a four pack which is ok, because that is about all I want. A nice treat and worthy of trying out at least once."
"A nice beer from Goose Island."
"Pours with white head atop a copper/light amber body. Aromas of spicy, yeastiness with a classic example of the belgian funkiness. The taste continues the experience resulting in a smoother, well rounded belgian ale. The Brettomyces definitely lends that belgian characteristics that those familiar to the style appreciate. Only 7% alc. by vol. this beer finishes with apricot, spicy notes. Very drinkable offering by Goose."
"Definitely recommended."
"Very nice beer from Goose Island."
"Overall, this was not bad, and sure, I have had better but not to distract from this at all. There was a little something special about this one, especially given the very nice overall contribution from the funky little yeasties who were making their presence felt. Overall, a really solid call, and I would not turn this one down."
"I'd be happy to have this at my table anytime."
"With the things I don't like about this beer, there are a few likes. After warming, it seems rather crisp....there is range and complexity. But in the end, fizzy killed..."
"definitley worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. It's easy to imagine drinking this all night. Or as much of the night as one remained upright."
"Notes: Bought the 4-pack at Halftime in November; I don't remember the exact price, but it wasn't cheap -- somewhere around $13 for the 4-pack, so I won't be getting this all that often (I also can't find it in Albany). But a worthwhile beer, no doubt."
"D- Good, great. I drink this a lot lately."
"Matilda, I could really grow to love you. I wish she traveled my way more often. She's playing hard to get but is worth the chase, for sure."
"D: Very nice seems it would be very refreshing on a hot summer day with its lemon twang and all. Best Goose Island I ever had."
"Like Orval but Fruitier."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable, although a little strong for a true session beer. Goose has done well."
"d: I'm sipping this one, but that's because I want to enjoy its complex and subtle flavors. The alcohol is masked well and it really is easy to drink. A good American made Belgian beer, my only complaint is the price. Not that it's not worth the money, but for the price of a 12 oz bottle of Matilda I can get a 750ml bottle of Ommegang, so I doubt I'll be buying many more of these. Still, it is a very tasty brew."
"Pours a clouded brown with gold. Big head forms off a not very firm pour. Nose is yeasty a bit, but overall is very subdued. Doesnt seem to deliver a whole lot. Extremely mild citrus is there. But it is just a weee little bit. Flavor is a punch in the mouth. Firm and full. Sweet from sugars, yes. But the yeast plays a good part in it all and the full experience is well rounded and mature. Feel is a bit dough like on the liquid with a thick carbonation. Overall I have to say that this is a very good production of the style. We all know how it can be with American producers trying to work the Belgian styles. Not the case here. Quite good. Worth trying. And worth holding onto for a while to see what may happen."
"I picked this up on a whim at Trader Joe's, feeling a yearning for Belgian ale coming on. I was interested to discover how Goose Island dealt with the style. Pours with quite a quiet head, a fairly pale amber and a hint of haze. Aroma slightly muted but has some varietal characteristic. Taste just a bit disappointing - this isn't Orval Trappiste - but is a fair imitation of the style."
"This is a 2006 vintage bottled on 03/02/06 so it is a little over a year and a half old. I foolishly stuck my nose over the bottle and took a whiff, the bottle was a gusher and I began breathing foam, shit! The color is a nice cludy, dark orange. It smells slightly medicinal and tastes medicinal and dry. I'm not so impressed by this beer, its ok."
"Overall I was very disappointed in this beer. Just seemed sloppy to me, given 2 tries and still the same. A lot may be due to it not being a style I enjoy perhaps but just found it confusing. Not sure if affected by age but other reviews had me expecting more. Least favorite GI offering thus far."
"Served in a GI Reserve tulip glass at the Bavarian Lodge. Hazy yellow-orange with a persistent white head. Citrus and pepper aroma with grainy malt in the background. The flavor adds more fruit flavors to the citrus, with some apricot or peach. Prominent (Brett?) funkiness that tames the fruitiness. You can taste the hops bitterness if you concentrate on finding it, but it's only in a supporting role. A well-crafted and true to style Belgian, and quite drinkable."
"Slightly cloudy orange with copper highlights and a rocky, two finger, off white head that hold its own. Big lemony citrus and rock candy aroma followed by a booziness and some buttery toffee in the back. Nutty, grain bread, slight caramel malt bill. Citric acidity throughout and a stiff peppery bitterness follows. Tea like florals from the start and notes fruity, orange rind and clove here and there. Hot for a 7.0, but can be easily ignored. A smooth mouthfeel fights with high carbonation that bites the tongue. As it warms earthier and somewhat charred grain characters become more apparent."
"D-Oh my god, this beer is so good, it should be banned. I love that it is only 7% because it holds enough body and flavor but doesn't wreck you after the first bottle. I could easily drink this all night (every night)"
"This Goose Island offering pours a clear clean amber. Moderate carbonation drifts up to thick craggy white head. Some lacing noted. Smell is floral hops, lemons, and an earthy element. Taste is fairly sweet with some sour notes as well. At first I was a but put off, but the beer was too warm. The sourness mellowed and turned out to be enjoyable. The sweetness resembles nut bread. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy but nothing over bearing. And gets cleaned up nicely by the noted sour hints and hops. I'd like to try this brew again for sure, though it is definitely nothing to be sessioned."
"This beer is really hitting the spot right now. The only other GI beer I've tried is the 312 Urban Wheat, so this is a pleasant surpise (even more surprising was finding 4-packs of these in Minot, ND). This certainly isn't for fans of drier Belgians, but if you don't mind a bit of sweetness, this is a very drinkable version."
"ohh how looks can be deceiving, went to my fave local bar and i was the first to get this beer, they tapped it just for me :) appearance is average a copper color with very little carbonation or head. smell is of fruit and yeast but thats about it, but holy crap it tastes great. i had pen in hand at the bar to review this beer and i dropped the pen, its really really damn good. moutfeel is thick and full and wonderful. drinkability is also very high, just wish they weren't 6 bucks a pop, but if you get a chance to try it, especially on draft, i suggest you do it"
"Drinkability: A bit of a disappointment, to be honest, but still good. A valiant effort to pay homage to the big boys (Duvel, Chimay White, DT), but not quite complex or interesting enough. And the amount of hops use does not quite seem ""profuse," as the bottle describes it."
"Poured into a chalice a golden orange color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy off-white head, tons of sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice spicyness, and floral, slight caramel. The taste is awesome, malty/yeasty, nice touch of spice/floral, and caramel. There is a very slight tangyness as well. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable. Highly recommended indeed. Another awesome brew from GI. Really there is not much difference between the 05/06 vintages, well at least that I can tell. Still an awesome brew."
"Overall- Tasty with an odd funk to it."
"This is a complex beer. Poured from the bottle into a small ""water"" glass. Poured with minimal head, the amber colored brew had a small amount of sediment in it. At first smell it was very hoppy, citrus, brown sugar. The taste was of a wheat beer with lots of hops, citrus, and the brown sugar comes in too. Medium mouth feel, with decent drinkablity"
"Very dry, the type of beer you need to drink with a glass of water near by, I can't see myself having more than one of these in a session, though I would definitely have it again. I'd be interested to see how this beer ages."
"I'm surprised and glad at how this one has aged, would definitely age some more of this. I think this one is better aged. (4)"
"Overall: second time I've had this beer, and it's never really grown on me. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer but doesn't make great for me. Balance seems a bit off, too spicy for the malt, not sure. Good but I won't buy it again when I've got other choices."
"Pretty damn tasty none the less!"
"My favorite belgium to date for this belgium amateur."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm pale and light crystal malt scent as well as a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a dry pale and light crystal malt scent. It goes down easy and finishes a bit warm with some fruity yeast esters. It's not an exceptional Belgian beer, but it's quite tastey. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I like the yeast presence."
"Tried at bottle of this at an Irish bar in Chicago called the Emerald Loop. Bartender gave me the bottle and a glass, and upon my first attempt to pour, it foam up big time in the glass. The beer was way too over-carbonated. After letting it settle for maybe 5 minutes, it took me two more attempts to get it all out into the glass. Pours a nice hazy yellow, like a Belgian. The taste was pretty good for the style, but it reminded me of a weakened tripel in essence. Not a horrible beer, but I think I just got one from a bad batch perhaps."
"D - This is another good GI beer. A descent attempt at a Belgian ale."
"D - Ok. This is one goofy brew. This beer is what you might taste if you went to a planet or another dimension very similar to Earth and asked for a beer. Good, but just really, really weird. Maybe made with extraterrestrial ingredients."
"Drinkability is not bad, especially after sludging through GIs other almost undrinkable Belgian beers. Clearly worth having a few to lay down. Id be interested to see this beer in a few years but I dont think it really has the legs."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with a fantastic off-white head that left a sheet of lacing on the glass. The smell is quite faint for a Belgian, light bubble gum, honey, and candi sugar. The taste is of honey, a touch of granny smith apple, corriander, light candi sugar, light orange peel, decent malt presence and a nice subtle hop finish. Great flavor range. The feel is moderate and crisp, well carbonated, almost champagne like, a very well balanced brew. This is a very fine brew. A refreshing American take on a Beligan style. Good Beligan flavors with a nice American hop balance."
"Mouthfeel is dry with a good amount of carbonation. Definitely has a boozy warmth to is. Very nice."
"Very carbonated like champagne and finishes dry. A froth on the palate releases some of the alcohol, rather warming for 7%. I am still developing my Belgian palate but this a very good beer. Goose Island has never disappointed either."
"Beer is good. Happy funky clone beering."
"Medium bodied, the mouth feel has a creamy texture from all of the tiny bubbles from within. The flavor is full and quite like the aroma. I get a banana flavor from the yeast. The feel complements the flavor well. Quite drinkable. The 7% ABV is hidden well. I prefer the flavor of Pere Jacques-Dubbel but this one is very nice as well."
"Pours a beautiful orange gold color with a bubbly off-white head with good retention and a nice lacing inside the chalice. The nose is very spicy and fruity, and has just a slightly musty character that is extremely pleasant. I can't stop sniffing this beer. The palate is lush - tropical fruits, Christmas spice, candy, and do I detect a bit of tart, gueuze-like zing here? I think I do. Very, very complex. The mouthfeel is silky, and finishes dry with some lingering bitterness that leaves the mouth watering for more. This beer floored me, quite frankly. I like Goose Island beers, but this may just be the best Goose Island beer I've ever tried. In fact, this may well be one of the best American-made Belgian style beers I've ever tried. Truly world class if you ask me. I need more of this beer."
"D-I am moving on to something else but I could come back someday."
"A somewhat hazy orangish amber pour with some carbonation and a respectable topping of relatively fine, off-white head that falls back into whisps of cling and a smattering of lace on top. Richly malty in the nose with pleasant spice and dark, ripe fruit. Taste is sweet with sugar as well as fuller malts balanced by a touch of hop bitterness and spicy alcohol warmth. An eminently smooth mouthfeel that cradles the complex taste while letting it linger. Another pleasant offering from Goose Island, following up on my love affair with Pere Jacques."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a good beer to try. I've never had a Belgian IPA before, but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Recommended if you're in the mood for something different."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head over the cloudy orangey amber brew. Thick head falls lasts long, with heavy frothy lacing. Even with a careful pour, there's some large chunkies zooming about the glass, which I could probably do without. Aroma is sweet pale malt with ample spiciness tickling the nose. Taste follows the nose's lead nicely. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is excellent as well. Nice one here."
"Drinkability: a solid belgian style ale here that is easy to quaff and I found to be very enjoyable from start to finish."
"Paid 2.79 for a 12 oz. bottle. Nice script on the label, but a boring story. Pours foamy but head quickly dissipates. No lacing. Very pretty amber red color. Smell is all belgian - spice, fruit, alcohol. Taste is powerful fruitiness with good hop character. Alcohol is dominant and at times distracting. Mouthfeel is winey, but good carbonation. Not thick enough for a brew of this magnitude."
"Granted, the vessel was a wine glass, wannabe chalice. What can you expect, this is Nebraska. Head 1/3 inch. Caramel flavor, thick mouthfeel, sweet malts, yeastiness gone begging. Strange, phantom plastic aftertaste but not sure if I imagined this through the alcohol levels. In the style bracket, a good and worthy go."
"The drinkability is good. Quite easy infact. It goes down easy and is enjoyable. Many thanks to Vancer for this quality beer. Prosit MK"
"A little light in the body, alcohol gets to be a little much but it has good crispness and is quite smooth. One of the better BSPAs not brewed in Belgium, as it doesn't go overboard on alcoholic flavors. I like the hop presence as well."
"overall a nice beer. seems like a solid foundation for a few tweaks and the eventual production of a really nice beer. i wonder how much the age in the bottle has effected it but as i find it, this beer is lacking a complexity, and artistry readily available in other belgian examples."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spicy, herbal lasting, honey blasting up front and leading to a semi-dry finish."
"The weird medicinal taste plus the alcohol content detracts from the overall drinkability, or so I thought, until I had a second, and a third...."
"On tasting it, given the bad odor, poor head, and almost non-existent carbonation, I'm beginning to think I have a skunked beer. Just bought it this week too. A shame. I'll re-review this one when I get the chance, given the excellence of the other Goose Island reserves I have trouble believing this beer is really this bad."
"This is a very drinkable beer and well done by G.I."
"Bottle good,,, Growler Highly Recommended."
"Mouthfeel was medium/full with a good deal of carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable. The smell and the finish were definitely the best parts of this beer. The aroma is not too complex, but it is enough to keep you interested and the dry, funky finish kept me coming back for more. I understand that this is basically an homage to Orval and I have to say that GI succeeded marvelously with Matilda"
"977"
"Drinkability - this is good ale, may be sessionable."
"D- It is good. I don't think it is anything to go crazy over but it is something that is worth giving a try."
"Poured into an Affligem chalice. Cloudy tangerine colour with a good off white head. The smell was belgian candi. Looks like this will be a tasty brew. Taste- wow! Not what I was expecting- has a real sourness that caught me by surprise. Really dry finish to boot. Label says profound hops but I'm not picking up a ton- maybe on the finish. The sourness was a treat- defintely funky- Jolly Pumpkin like. Mouthfeel is good- fairly high carbonation. This is a unique brew and it was great to try a bottle. Very drinkable - the sourness becomes very addicting!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This one is a bit thick and syrupy. I'm sipping it. Overall, I'm not a fan. I think it's the spiciness that's a turn off for me. I wouldn't recommend it."
"Took from the fridge and poured directly into a clean glass. Nice golden amber color with a little cloudiness from the sediment. Average sized soft white head. Bright fruity smell of cherries and oranges. Meduim/full body with medium carbonation. The taste was nothing special. Very little alcohol taste present, though it did leave a warming feeling going down. Taste was a little dry and malty with only a light hop taste on the finish. I really didn't care for this one very much."
"Drinkability- Seems better with no yeast, but this is fairly drinkable."
"Pricey compared to real Belgian offerings, but definitely worth a try."
"Murkey deep orange amber body hosts a two finger thick light tan head that fades to just a skim in about two minutes. Nose comes of like a Belgium style with strong spicey notes. It is very invigorating to the nose. A very floral citrus feel highlights the first sip. A combination of tangy sour and slight honey sweetness. Almost like drinking a liquid flower. Maybe even a hint of christmas cookie. Relatively thick mouthfeel. Not to bad on that level. Develops a sweet thickness on the buds. Unique and worth a try but not my thing overall."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into an oversized wine glass. Appears deep copper, with a red hue and a scant half an inch of white head. Aroma is sweet caramel, fruity, spicy cinnamon apple and banana. Tastes of spicy yeast, crisp, sweet tart apples, toffee and mild cocoa. Dry, crisp and medium bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. This is an interesting ale that I would drink again, possibly with some aged, sharp cheeses. Cheers."
"Doesn't quite have the magic blend of flavors that the real Orval achieves, but this beer is a very respectable clone. After buying one bottle I went back for a 4-pack. I recommend it."
"Well, who knows what this might be like with more bottle age...maybe the flavors would integrate a bit better. 7% isn't very high but all those hops have got to preserve this beer."
"Wasn't a fan... Pours with a white thick head that died off after a bit. . Hazy and cloudy amber in color. Very fruity, maybe banana?? A hint of spices. I might also taste a little honey. Very light and bubbly. Left a light laced glass, not completely clean. I don't think I would have another."
"Dnot crazy about this one, would pass on it in the future."
"A bit of a foam rush from the effervescence which affects the mouthfeel a bit but this is still a wonderful beer from Goose Island. Their Reserve Series is consistantly excellent."
"D: Drinkability is very good. A fine, fine representation of the style. Flavors and aromas of alcohol are virtually nonexistant. This beer has the hops that are sorely lacking from Orval. I read in Hopleaf's Bottle Menu that Matilda is Goose Island's homage to Orval. I have to say that I definately prefer Matilda to Orval. If that was their goal, than they certainly suceeded."
"Drinkability: My original notes call this a ""sessionable belgian", which is amusing because 7.00% is not sessionable for me at all... I'd call it nicely drinkable."
"Nice pour  hazy amber, youll get some white head and lacing if poured aggressively. Notes of orange and cinnamon were pleasing  but the quaff, wow, orangey cough syrup! Slightly phonetic and woody. Not one of GIs better brews, and I usually dig their offerings. Oh well, ya cant please everybody all the time."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice frothy head and spotty lacing. Smell is sour up front and spicy throughout. The taste is sour and hoppy with some coriander and nutmeg. The mouthfeel is a little light, but the carbonation is right and its smooth.Pretty drinkable- slides down fairly quickly and pleasantly, but not overly complex."
"Matilda has a lot to offer. A blend of smells and flavors combine to give a very nice drinking experience. I wish I had another bottle."
"Overall interpretation is a nicely drinkable brew. Enjoy anytime"
"Extremely fine carbonation keeps this light and lively, though it does have a slight drying effect on the palate. Perilously drinkable, wonderful with food, and a wholly captivating beverage. Bravo! 2006 Release."
"Poured out a hazy orange-gold, and a thick off-white head. The nose was full of grassy hops, candi sugar, as well as fruity notes. The taste was sweet up front, but a dry finish from the hop bitterness, with candy-like notes as in the aroma, but very little malt . Mouthfeel was light, moderate carbonation, tight finish."
"Pours a five finger, white head that fades to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Starts sweet almost raisiny, hops balance well, brewer says its loaded with hops but they are really subdued. Best so far from GI. Bottled on Mar 27, 2006, pricey but worth $2.99 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"This is a very drinkable beer but wish it could be purchased for a better price."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer, but does not compare favorably at its price point. I'll cellar the remainder of the four pack and try it again in a year."
"As I usually say when I encounter a great beer like this: can we find this on tap nearby?"
"From the label: ""Once upon a time in a valley, a beautiful countess lost something precious to her in a small pond. Racked with grief, she prayed for its return. Very quickly it resurfaced in the most wondrous of ways. After her prayers had been answered she blessed the pond and valley. Later, she had an abbey built there. Today they brew beer and while we were traveling in Belgium we stopped in, heard the story and tried the beer. Really GOOD BEER and a GREAT STORY. Of course, we wanted to share what we'd heard and tasted. Uusually we'd do that over beers. This time we did it with beer. Recreating that experience wasn't easy. It's made with rare yeast that's very difficult to come by. No other beer we make is like this, slightly fruity with a profuse amount of hops, it's great with a plate of mussels."" - Greg Hall, Brewmaster"
"This is really a fantastic brew that is one of the examples that could quite the critics of the American Belgian style ales. I wish I had this at my disposal a little more regularly"
"Enjoyable beer and quite a ride. But not too many at once for me. Further proof that I have a lot to learn."
"Opaque dark orange with a reddish cast. Small yellow head of very tiny bubbles. Good rings of lace on the glass. Slightly chalky aroma, some cherry smell, off and expired baker's yeast. Mouthfeel is a little flat, slightly heavy in overall body. Flavor is an unpleasant mix of uncharacterful bitter and too much sourness. Secondary tastes of slight chocolate and more apparent raisin linger underneath and are a little more noticeable close to the finish. Aftertaste is harsh and inappropriately hoppy for the type of beer this is aiming to be. Not a favorite for me."
"Big bodied, and sweet, the alcohol isn't too prevalent, but the sweetness tends towards reducing drinkability."
"The appearance is amber-colored, with ok head. Aroma is sweet and a bit fruity with some citrus hops smell. Taste is also sweet, a little ale-fruitiness with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish. Pretty smooth. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with somewhat light carbonation. This is a very good beer that I would like to try again, maybe from a bottle."
"EDIT 4/2007 bottling: Lots of estery yeast, not much Brett presence at all. Slicker mouthfeel. Will cellar for 6 months to see if any Brett character shows up."
"I had this originally on tap at a tasting and then later at the brewery, but never thought too hard about it, or gave it a review. So being a Chicagoan here it goes: This beer pours an orangey must color, with decent head. There is moderate retention and some lacing. At first smells are reminiscent of a Belgian tripel even though there was no mention of it. I assume that would have something to do specifically with the yeast strain and the basic recipe. Any how smells of Belgian yeast, some sugars, mild banana, cloves, pepper and some other spices. The taste is much the same, maybe at first a smidgen thin, but honestly it opens up and has a very pleasant after taste. To me this is a nice American version of a modified Belgian tripel. This is a tasty beer I must give props to the home town brewery and will definitely buy this again."
"had this on tap at the great lakes brewfest in Racine, WI. orangey with tan head. smells great. buttery and hoppy...the hops are flowery and sweet smelling, with vague spices in there too. Taste is initally watery and not impressive but the flavor lingers and expands and becomes truely great. cloves and hops...TONS of cloves actually. and some black pepper. great. a real blast to drink..im glad i had the opportunity to try it."
"I have another bottle to cellar for a while and see what happens."
"As far as GI's reserve line-up, Pere Jacques is world-class, then Demolition, followed by Matilda. All of these beers are very delicious and Goose Island is to be commended for brewing products as authentic as they come, giving the Belgians a run for their money. Highly recommended."
"Opinion: I am really pleased with this beer. This is without a doubt the best beer that I have tried from Goose Island, and their beers are known to be pretty good. I had considered donating the other three beers from this 4-pack to my brew clubbut on second thoughtI will probably keep them in my own cellar. These beers are complex, and if they truly are like Orvalthey will age well. It says on the bottle that they will age for 5 years, and I believe that. Nice beer!"
"Great hazy, dark pancake hue that is quite fruity, chewy, with just the right about of hoppiness. Smooth and just a slight taste of alcohol, which probably wouldn't have been so apparent if I read the label."
"Matilda is yet another good beer in GI's 'Reserve' line. As far as those offerings that fancy themselves Belgianesque, it's superior to Demolition 1800, but falls short of the superb Pere Jacques. Goose Island should be proud of the fact that they're among the handful of U.S. breweries who are able to give the Belgian masters a run for their money."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a medium brown color beer with a nice big foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet cookie dough with some yeast characteristic. Taste is somewhat dominated by the sweet cookie dough, some yeast and some dry fruits. Body is a bit thin and carbonation is just perfect. Overall, I wasnt expecting this to be such good Belgian ale."
"Nice reddish golden color with a foamy off white head. Nice sticky lacing leaves trails down the glass. A wonderful looking beer. Nice fruity smell. Nice malty taste with a nice mix of fruity esters. Apricot and just the faintest spicyness to the finish. Silky smooth mouthfeel. High carbonation level gives it a nice punch. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Bronzed dark orange. Slight, mysterious haze. Small, ringy, off-khaki head. Raw sugar aromas mix with manuka honey and ambrosia. Fruity and yeasty with a fleck of alcohol. Nice. Belgiany. Lightly toasted malt with floral bitterness up front. Sweet, sugary fruit syrup and rum mid-palate. Wall of noble bitterness with flashes of syrup in the finish. Nice balance. Full-bodied, coating mouthfeel. The liberal hop load saves this brew. Drinks a little stronger than you'd think too!"
"Ordered this on-tap at the Goose Island Clybourn restaurant. Served in a goblet. Poured a clear golden color with a thick, bright white head. Sweet aromas of honey and malt. Tastes, too, of the honey, with a touch of floral. Hints of the hops in there, too. Adds a nice bitter touch. Clean and smooth mouthfeel, very light carbonation. Overall, a very sweet and refreshing beer. Would gladly go back to this one."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a hazy amber, with some orange to it. Head was off-white and small (hotel glassware issue). Smell was classic Belgian yeast, oranges, cotton candy, and spices (clove for sure and maybe cinnamon). Taste was sweet, almost melon like at first, followed by a fairly strong hop bite at the end, citrus-orange in flavor. I am not doing the flavor of this beer justice, but it was excellent. Body was light and effervescent, highly carbonated and slightly drying. An excellent beer, another ""Hoppy Belgian"". Somewhere between Orval and La Chouffe Triple Double IPA. Very drinkable."
"Hazy copper hue with a large egg shell airy head. Good lacing. Really funky, earthy, hay aroma. Slightly sour. Delicate flavor on the palate. Firm body with more of a fizzy mouthfeel. Pale malt base with a slight pear, strawberry fruit flavor. Touch of a sour yeasty candylike flavor in the middle. Hops come out but more towards the end. Alcohol is not noticeable at all except for the feeling down my tummy and my breathing afterwards. Interestingly drinkable yet not my favorite. Lots of complexities and subtleties that binded well together but I think it's just solid in the end."
"Obtained in a BIF from orbitalr0x, this handsome golden ale was well carbonated, and a four finger head crowning above the rim prevented me from emptying the entire 12 oz. bottle into the appointed oversized wine glass. The aroma was spicy and floral with a dusting of yeast. The taste was dry and tart, with earthy yeast funk and spices also appearing in liberal doses. The mouthfeel was a hair less snappy than the mighty Orval. A good Belgian style pale ale on its own merits."
"I reviewed this quite some time ago and was frankly shocked by some of the low reviews (of course the 06 could be worse). how this is made with the same yeast as orval is amazing to me as I can't stand orval. this one is just under one year old... and I remember loving it when I first tried it, not much has changed. to be fair I will have to do a side by side with a new batch and see what's up."
"D: Drinkable offering from Goose Island. Definately worth a look."
"Notes of anise, fresh cut grass, black pepper, green pepper, with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. Alcohol is nicely masked. A well balanced interpretation of the Belgian Pale Ale."
"D - Good drinkability. One at a time would be my limit. Damn fine interpretation of a Belgian Pale Ale from Goose Island."
"I'd place the drinkability pretty high... I couldn't detect the alcohol in the flavor but it hits you before long. Awesome."
"This beer poured into the glass a mildly hazy copper color. It was topped with a decent sized off-white head that settled quickly into the glass. Big spicy nose. It has a ton of yeasty bread, a little cardamom, citrus orange all backed by a date character form the malt. The flavor reflects the aroma quite well. All of the components are there. They yeasty flavor is milder than the nose led me to believe, but all of the spices are there along with a bit of white pepper. The malt has a bit more complexity. The dates are accompanied by caramel, and touch of green apple. The mouth feel is rich, and slightly slick. Theres just a touch of alcohol on the finish, but it s a surprisingly drinkable beer. This is a fine example of this style, maybe the best Ive ad produced in the US."
"Slàinte!"
"Spicier than expected, with a funky sourness that is very similar to a Belgian saison. Apricots, lemon, apple, and the cinnamon bite of Big Red gum. The Belgian yeast plays a major role in trying to recreate the original style. I gotta say, I'm loving these ""big brews"" from Goose Island. Their Imperial IPA & Bourbon County Stout are ridiculously good, and the Matilda & Demolition do not lag far behind. All are well-worth a try."
"Drinkability: I am not the biggest fan of this beer, the flavor seems thin and incomplete."
"I enjoyed this beer. I wasn't sure about it at first, but it really grows on you after awhile. I find myself returning to get this beer again and again..."
"Overall a nice tasty BPA from the Goose."
"Pours a vibrant golden orange under several fingers of fluffy white foam in my twisted Ayinger Hefe glass. Nose is a lively mix of sopping wet grapefruit and citric hops. Taste is juicy grapefruit, slightly bitter tangerine, white grape, pear, and piney/citrus hops with a bit of yeasty spice. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Now this is a summer beer. Deceptive at 7%, its fruity hoppiness is a real thirst quencher on a humid Wisconsin evening. Another strong offering from Goose Islands Reserve selection. I've yet to be disappointed."
"drinkability: quite good"
"A very good, highly drinkable beer."
"i don't see the orval-ness in this. definitely more on the side of a belgian pale with a lot of residual sweetness. you get a hint of brett character, but it's pretty well buried. it adds to complexity tho ultimately this beer maybe has a bit too much going on to really pin it down. still a very good beer but it just doesn't seem to meld quite right. perhaps a bit too sweet/flowery for me. i wonder what age could do to it."
"Yup. The nutty creaminess saves the day by taking the edge off the dry."
"Carbonation is high, body is medium making this a pretty nicely refreshing beer. Easy to drink but gets some points off for the numbing phenols and obvious alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is okay but not great. The amount of hops on the finish leaves a very grainy residue on the palate. Definitely a food beer. I couldn't drink more than one of these."
"The sweet is nice, but not enough to really carry the beer. Maybe this is better when it's fresher, before the hops have been dulled to nothingness. Still, not bad."
"Nice orange color, with a filmy off-white head, yet lacking that beautiful, mountainous foam of its counterpart. It does nearly equal Orval in the aroma, its dry, spicy and hoppy, with a mild brett character and hints of leather, caramel , perfume and cake icing. Im trying not to look at this beer as an Orval clone, because in the flavor, it's far from it. Whereas Orval is very dry with a horseblanket flavor, I find this to be very sweet. But I can imagine how difficult it would be to brew an Orval clone. I cant even brew a drinkable IPA. Still though, in itself, this beer is still very enjoyable. The yeast suggests hints of white peppercorn and perfume, with a rich herbal and floral hop flavor."
"Overall I really liked this beer. It is a bit subdued compared to most of the other Belgians I've had which frankly I liked."
"I really like this beer because it is not overbearing at all. The aroma and the flavor are mild, but wonderful. I think this would make an excelent session beer. I wish I could get my hands on more of this stuff. Many thanks to my friend karst for once again supplying me with a winner."
"Pours a light amber, cloudy as hell. Fizzy head maintains some good tracing. Aromas, wow... Apples, pears, candy sugar, it all pops out. Somewhat cloying already, I'm afraid for the flavor. This beer has quite some complexity. You're first hit with sweetness, followed by some sourness and astringency akin to Orval. However, I do enjoy this one much more. Carbonation is somewhat high, gives you quite a zing, and is refreshing. Alcohol biting a little at the swallow. This is an extremely drinkable brew. Would go wonderfully with some brie or camembert (I wish I had some ugh). Glad it went on sale locally, made it worth my purchase."
"Dangerously drinkable; even at 7% I could quaff a lot of this nectar. I cant believe I dont have any more bottles. I need to get more; I bet this would kill with a slew of cheeses mix in some fresh fruit and dear God! Goose Island sure can brew some killer beers! I got my four-pack in Lawrence, KS for $9. It is a top notch beer at a great price. Seek it out."
"D - This is a very nice addition to Goose Island's ""Special Beer"" series as I'll call it. Super drinkable and very enjoyable -- just look at the numbers! I think I'll quit gushing about the beer now and get to enjoying the rest of it. [Edit 07-21-2006: This beer has become a favorite of mine in the style and a pleasure to savor. Bumped to a 5.0 from a 4.5.]"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- So rolling, so easy and foamy. Overall, a more fruity twist on the Belgian Pale Ale which is totally enjoyable. I don't know who this ""Matilda"" is, but I hope to meet her one day."
"Jen: I would have to say that I am not overly impressed with this ""expensive"" beer. It has sweet malty characteristics with a backing of citrusy apple fruits and hops. It is light in body and quite bubbly. It is easy to drink, but I don't think that it is worth $8.99. If you are trying to decide between this and another, go with the other."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a strong blast of carbonation that dashes across the palate. Goes down fairly easy at 7% and each sip keeps me coming back for more. I wouldn't mind enjoying a few of these in a sitting. Worth seeking out and trying I'd say."
"Drinks well - no overpowering flavors and sits well."
"12 ounce bottle. Orangish color with a small head. What a strange beer! The aroma is fruity, but somehow unlike any fruit I've eaten. It's sort of like fruit mixed with candy and ginger. Some wine-like grape flavors are present. Slightly tart, but still candy-like in it's tartness. Finishes with spices, including cinnamon and ginger. This beer left me confused and thirsty. Still not sure if I like it or not. It's certainly an interesting beer."
"This ale pours a candied orange color that leaves a bubbly white lace that sticks to the glass. The aroma is black licorice, root beer, horse blanket, wet grass, citrus, and candied fruit very complex. The taste is sweet on the palate, starts bitter with a black licorice/anis flavor in the background. It then hits with a dull alcohol presence on the palate that has some bitter bark bit on the tongue. Then it finishes semi-hoppy with a light carbonation, great brew glad I picked it up. I would pair this beer with a baked haddock stuffed with bread crumbs, oregano, and thyme. The savory stuffing and delicate fish will really compliment some of the licorice, canided aspects in the beer. Also the beer will act as the ""squeeze of lemon"" some people put on fish cause of the citrus aspect in this brew."
"Drinkability - a quality beer IMO, but not to my taste."
"This one is an orange color, mostly, but not completely transparent, with a modest, unassuming head. The aroma is intriguing: spicy, estery, vinous, bits of yeast and bread, and a slight acid-like smell. Great! The taste is equally interesting: a malt base, around which there is yeast, apple flavors, a fleeting sourness, and pepper. The flavors work very well, and this one is a lot of fun to drink. The intensity of flavor is sort of low, but the whole package is noteworthy and enjoyable. Sprtizy and somewhat light mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. I wasnt disappointed with this one at all."
"I must say, Goose Island did a pretty good job. I heard a BUNCH of hype about this beer, does it live up to all of it, probably not. Conversely, this is a good American Belgian in my opinon. I did enjoy this and would seek it out again."
"I had this again 5.3 years later and it was much beter in the aroma department(yeasty and normal) so upgraded it,"
"A different feel to this one....not horrible but I can live without ever having another one..."
"American's benchmark belgian pale ale."
"Taste; spiced oranges, slight floral hops, and there's an interesting funky/earthiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but there's a little to much bite in the carbonation. Overall this is a pretty solid beer."
"Straw orange color with a head that goes to lumps but gives some lacing. Smells of sweet-malt with a citric and yeast funk but very mild. Taste kind of like a wit-beer there is a sourness but it is more citrus than sour and the hops are very subdued and the yeast ain't that funky. Nice carbonation and body though. It is drinkable but not the clone that it could be."
"a rollercoaster ride for sure, and probably one of the better (and more available) orval clones out there. still, as many people here said, there is something here prohibitive of greatness. i don't know if it's a lack of richness, an excess of sweetness, or a heavy hand with the hops. still, i'd drink a few more of these without question, especially considering the hefty price tag to its trappist cousin."
"Drinkability and Notes  The more I drink this the less I taste the sour and the more I taste the hop bitterness. Definitely a tasty beer, but one was enough for me. Defiantly feels like an interpretation of Orval, but it doesnt have the same complexity of flavor."
"Pale, dim orange. Big frothy, meringue like white head. The lace is all coating. Lots of froth left on my glass. Carbonation streams upward rapidly. Vibrant nose. Really fruity and estery. Apple and pear. Spicy as well with cinamon and pepper checking in. And yeasty doughiness as well. Nice nose. I notice some fusels first off on the buds. Then some spicy, peppery tones. Breadiness is diminished on the palate. Flavor not as full as the nose predicted. Carbonation is not as lively as I'd like. Just a little underwhelming. Body is light-medium or so. Not bad. Not good."
"Tasting it: Mmmm! Smooth, tasty...lush fruit, smacks of sour, flush flavor, very particular, this...but altogether delicious! Almost like a saison, just about...but so very tasty, and satisfying...lofty and lovely, ...a keeper! Enjoy when you can!"
"Dated 07/27/05, consumed without aging."
"I would most definitely buy more of this beer. Infact, I prefer it to other Belgian Pale Ales that I have had. Perhaps this is because this style may have been Americanized by Goose Island. Perhaps they have decided to forego the sweet taste of Belgian Pale Ales brewed in Europe and instead give it a good mix of a hoppy and spicy character. Whatever the case is I can only say that I prefer this brew to other Belgian Pale Ales I've had (How many times have I said that now? It feels that 4-5 might be an accurate count.)."
"Orange colored body with a good-sized white head that dropped out of site fairly quickly leaving a bit of spotty lace. Fruity sweet aroma with a nice yeasty character to it. Mainly apples and pears notes, with some light floral scents in the mix. Taste starts off a bit fruity sweet with some funky yeast notes to complement the fruit. Floral and earthy hop notes are light but present. Ends with a spicy sweet finish that is a bit dry. Pretty smooth on the palette with enough body to carry the flavor. Easily drinkable as well."
"on draft, pours light almond amber, slight haze with bubbles rising slowly to the top. Frothy tan head, turning slowly to a tiny bubble film. This tasty substance leaves fine, intricate lacing. Nose is mildly of some floral and spicy hops. This is a delicate ale, moderatly hopped, nicely balanced and with a well meshed and subtle Belgian yeast edge mixed in. Light notes of honey, caramel, toffee and piney hops. Nicely crafted B.P.A."
"D- This is a good solid beer. It is an easy session beer that has lots of great qualities of a Belgian Pale Ale but it has more. The hops offer a nice balance and the faint barnyard quality of them really makes this refreshing but not an ""extreme"" beer. I will be buying this again soon."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/amber, small head forms, some nice lacing on the glass. Smell is orange peel, spices, yeast, some citrus and floral hops, honey. Taste is orange, a metric asston of spice, some rich fruit and floral hops, pear and apple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth and tasty. The flavour was a little one dimensional but I really enjoyed this beer, very excellent."
"This is like a more refined version of De Ranke XXX or Hommelbier. Hands down the best American brewed Belgian Style Pale Ales I have had this year."
"Faint haze in this orange/amber beer. Topped by a cream coloured, thin head that reduces quickly to a ring around the glass, but it does show some nice lacing. The aroma is quite spicy, mostly with cloves, but some floral hops and cinnamon peek through as well. The flavour is very spicy, with cloves all the way through. Mild bitterness is accompanied by mild hop flavours. As it warms some fruitiness appears and the hop flavour becomes stronger. Some bitter orange peel adds character and there's a lingering citrus/spice combination in the finish. Slightly drying, it's generous carbonation is smooth and the attenuation is fairly high. Overall, a nice beer. A little strong on the spiciness perhaps, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. Thanks Viggo!"
"This was quaffed rather easily and the carbonation and mouthfeel soften as the beer warms to room temperature. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability: at $7.00 per bottle - this got expensive quick (only $2.50 down the street)! So delecious your likely to ignore its cost. One of the two must haves from Goose Island ( December released - Bourbon County Stout is the other)"
"Apricot colored with a thick head of off-white meringue that leaves lumpy residue atop the liquid and sends fuzzy finfgrs rising up the insides of the glass. Aroma of honey and ripe fruit, some fine hops, bready malt and a bit of yeast. Smooth and full mouthfeel leads to a flavor of cinnamon and clove, a dash of nutmeg, delicate malt, and a finish of yeast. A smooth and well-balanced beer, enjoyable sipper, but just on the low side of drinkability due to the yeasty linger. Thanks ro Brent for sending this one along."
"I only wish this was a more readily attainable beer, as I've really got a taste for it now. It would make a great session beer otherwise, but I am still savouring my only bottle as I wrap this review up."
"A nice Orval homage here."
"Matilda pours a hazy golden-orange body beneath a creamy head of ivory froth that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. In the mouth it gently bristles before warming to become lightly creamy. The nose is fruity with a suggestion of tartness (think Brettanomcyes); malty and a bit candyish; a touch musty; and subtly spicy.... all of which carry over in the flavor with the addition of some welcome hops! It finishes drying with some residual sticky malt, but it's solid, underlying bitterness wins out in the end and leaves you ready for another sip. Well done!"
"The finish was the Orval nose and astringent taste. This was pleasant. I will try more. I find this beer to have the flavor experience of bigger beers. This is the most interesting surprise to me. At 7% it borders on a session beer. It offers a good food pairing and with its citric carbonation will refresh through a meal. The reserve series has another success."
"Poured a hazy, peachy gold. Some Juicy Fruit gum in the aroma. Very Belgian-esque in character - yeasty phenols and not-overripe orchard fruit, suggesting pear and apple, with the barest touch of spice. I've not had an Orval in quite a while, but this beer immediately brought it to mind."
"The only ""flaw"" was in the drinkability, but it still went down pretty easily. Perhaps a bit more body and silkiness, but overall, a very impressive beer."
"Notes: This is a good beer. It probably will not appear at the top of my list, but it is pleasantly drinkable. I plan to do a side by side sampling of this one and the beer that inspired it soon."
"A good, albeit a little different, beer. I need to cellar some and see what happens."
"Pours a very clear copper color with a finger of head that falls to a moderate coating over top. Nose is very nice. I get lemoney and orange citrus, slight musty and spiceyness. There is almost a perfumey quality to it. The flavor is okay. Rather spicey and almost floral-perfumey tasting as well. The citrusyness is more subdued in the flavor. It seems to want to be doing a lot of things at the same time, but they don't blend as seamlessly as I wouldl ike them to. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Overall, the nose is really nice, but the flavor is a bit detracting to me. I'd like to see it meld better."
"Pours a light amber color with a medium head that has good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus and some yeasty character. The flavor is nice. Some citrus and a tasty caramel malt backing. The flavor sticks to the tongue. Some yeast flavors - slightly spicy. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and the drinkability is good."
"Another great beer in the line of Goose Island's Big Beers. Good aromas of Belgian candy and barley malts. Transfers to flavors along with over ripe fruits: oranges, plumbs, and berries. Has some slight hop bitterness and flavor. Spicy coriander, cloves, pepper, and allspice. Some organic, sour, or earthy flavors ride underneath other flavors, these resemble Trappist Orval. Its a good beer, but the flavors need a while to come together."
"Draught: This one pours a dark golden, somewhat hazy color. There ws also a hint of orange in there. A good off-white head. The nose is quite full, being bready, yeasty, spicy, and a hint of caramel and hops. The taste has wheat, corriander, breadyness, and some sweetness. Very Nice!"
"Drinkability is pretty high, slightly metallic aftertaste limits somewhat but pretty good beer."
"I sampled this beer at Goose Island. This beer poured a rich, mahogany color, letting all light through, with a thin head that dissipated quickly. It had a malty smell with an almost barnyard-like earthiness. I'm guessing that was the barley they were boasting of in the written description. The taste was pretty complex, without being overpowering. The first sip almost tasted like a chardonnay, crisp and fruity. This taste was followed by the sweetness of the malt and finished with a bitter hoppy bite."
