"So good. Second of the night after a Not so Stoic during Ravens playoff run. Hope to enjoy more from BMB real soon."
"Worth trying."
""
"Describes as ""A Belgian inspired, barrel aged, American hopped experimental sort of ale""....?....Pours a light brown-amber color, cloudy with a decent head and pretty decent lacing. Aroma is of some oak and twangy malt sweetness. Taste has some oak in it, not much bourbon. Carbonation is average and taste is rather mild, with the oak being the predominant flavor. Not much going on with this beer, light, decent, balanced but not quite the mouthful of flavor I was expecting !!"

"O - The description on the bottle made this beer sound interesting which it was. However, I detected nothing from the bourbon barrel. I would have never guessed this beer was barrel aged. Nonetheless, it is a good beer. It comes across as a saison/BSPA hybrid. It is absolutely worth a try."

"Local Species definitely has some strong qualities but it needs some fine tuning. Not sure what Blue Mountain is getting at with this one."

"Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, bright, amber-tinted copper coloring, with a filmy, clingy, surface coating of off-white head. Aromas of subtle caramel, charred wood characteristics, all spice, bubble gum, subtle hops bitterness, cloves, subtle toffee sweet, and Belgian spice and funk. Flavors are hops bitter forward, with hints of citrus and resin, followed by a subtle spice blend of clove, cardamom, all spice, and nutmeg, all on a caramel sweet backbone. The spice blend builds towards the end and into the aftertaste, along with a berry fruit and bubble gum Belgian funk blend. Light, crisp bodied, with a slick, crisp, spiced finish. Drinkable, tasty beer."

"O- nice citrusy notes made it very drinkable, but any bourbon barrel notes are hard to find"
"Prost!"
"Pours a cloudy amber with a small white head. Aroma and taste is of biscuit malt, Belgian yeast, fruity with some mild citrus hops. A medium body with nice smooth texture and mild carbonation. Finish is a combination of biscuit malt and Belgian yeast, a bit of caramel and toffee notes, fruity with some mild citrus hops for balance. Overall a well balanced tasty and enjoyable brew."

"Smells like a sour.   The taste follow to some extent. Odd, barrel-aged wild ale.  Neither especially challenging nor appealing."

"Poured from a 12.7 oz corked bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours reddish orange with a small white head. Smells of piney hops and some Belgian yeast. Tastes of Belgian yeast with some piney hops with a bit of barrel age aftertaste. Beer is slightly heavily carbonated but finishes nice for a medium body. Overall a very good beer."

"On tap at Sticks and Stones.Poured into a stemmed glass a slight hazed deep auburn color with a fluffy white head that lasted for quite awhile.Carmael and dark fruit stood out most in the nose with mild phenols and vanilla detected as well.Somewaht sweet upfront with caramel and vanilla flavors with lighter than expected spiced phenols coming into play with a decent drying toasted oak flavors lingering in the finish.The barrel doesn't play a huge role in this either does the phenols,maybe a slightly tame version of the style,still not bad."

"o - Very enjoyable beer. There's a lot of different stuff going on. Honestly, I could have done without the whole bourbon barrel thing here. Overall, I did really like it. I would definitely have this again."

"Overall 4.25: Excellent brew and a fabulous IPA. This beer makes use of many west coast US hops and a very assertive malt that forms the backbone of the IPA. The added flavors from the oak barrels push everything over the top into the ""above outstanding"" category. Well worth the purchase if you are lucky enough to find it."

"Overall – A rather tasty and sweeter Belgian Pale ale. Quite nice overall and one I would certainly do again."

"O- what a weird ass beer. I like how unique it is but it's not something I'd buy regularly. There are a lot of unique and complex balances between a saison funk and barrel aged malty ale. The only beer I could ever relate to this would be fantôme noir but this is a lot better (less sweet, less fruity). This brew is labeled correctly --- experimental sort of ale--- yeah weird but entertaining for your taste buds and definitely worth trying at least once."
"O: Honestly, the flavor seems a little... confused. It's not solidly Belgian-style, or a pale ale, or a bourbon barrel aged beer, which can be a good thing, when the flavors come together, but they really don't in this case. Still a good beer, but sometimes simpler is better."

"Overall: Overall I’m happy with the beer, but I would have liked to have seen just a little more beer and a little less bourbon. This same beer, with the booze dialed back about 25%, would be absolutely amazing. As it stands, the branches can’t support all the decorations (3.75/5)."

"O: nice beer"
"Overall: A lot of meh. It shows some promise of being a truly interesting brew but seems to fall off more then it should."
"O: Nothing amazing, just a really drinkable BPA with a mild bourbon/oak presence. I wouldn't buy it again due to the price, but I would drink it again with no problems."
"O- Once it warmed up, actually tasted like a pretty nice IPA, and completely drinkable, but absolutely no belgian or oak flavors, as advertised. Since this differs from most other reviewers, I guess I got a bad bottle? If your bottle has a best-by date, take it seriously."
"Light body with decent soft carbonation. Easy to drink, but a bit one dimensional with how the Belgian yeast flavors dominate."
""

"O - I drank this glass at about 55 degrees initially and liked it even more as it warmed. The taste grew on me. I like it."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it doesn't really fit the style of a Belgian Strong Ale, but as far as funky Belgians go I think it's pretty on par and the yeast really does remind me of Brewery Vivants house yeast. The yeast did seem just a little overpowering and the barrel and hop aspects didn't show up as much as I thought they would, but I still really like liked the flavors and I thought it was enjoyable. This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, not filling, crisp and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, drinking the whole bottle is no problem and if I was really in the mood for a beer like this I could see myself drinking a couple bottles. What I liked the most about this beer how all the aspects were equally good and didn't really have a weak point. The only thing that I liked the least about this beer was how little the barrel and hops showed up, if they showed up a little more I think this would be a very good beer. I would buy this beer again, I have a bottle in the cellar and I might grab a couple more next time I'm at Boyne Country Provisions, it's a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who like the funkier Belgian ales. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it wasn't really what I expected, but I ended up enjoying it and I think the funkier yeast profile worked well with this beer. This made for a good first impression of Blue Mountain Brewery, I didn't see any of their other beer on the shelf and I don't know much about this brewery, but if I saw some of their other beers I'm pretty sure I would give them a try. Good job guys, I'm glad I took a chance on this beer and I think it really paid off. I'll be interested to see how this changes over time."
"O: Overall sweetly toasted, light and freshly fruity makes this drink easier then it looks. Has a harmonous blend of belgian yeast, fresh wet fruitiness, and american spicy hops balanced nicely with subtle hints of charred oak woodiness. Everything is delicately balanced and fine tuned here, a dark looking heavy beer that really does drink much lighter then it looks. crisp and refreshing. very good try."

"Pours a humongous three finger head of eggshell white to tan foam, dense with an undulating surface, excellent retention given how whipped up it is, the lacing is on the wispy side but sticks tenaciously. Translucently clear, like vellum, coppery base that turns equally brown and orange, very few bubbles to be seen. The nose has a fresh if not quite clean profile, stone, poor dirt, pepper and dried grapefruit pulps and grains, the hoppiness sneaks up on you then, wham!, the apple, pear, peach fruit is direct and underripe like you wish you left them on the counter for just another day or two, no meaningful trace of bourbon barrel aging. Medium-bodied, smooth with a pleasingly creamy texture, even the underlying sourness can’t interfere. That said, the cherry, apricot, red apple, pear, peach fruit sunny and tart in just the right way. There’s an earthy, leafy element but not thick enough to be like “sous bois” or deep forest in character. Mostly orange citrus with a hint of lemon. Clean yeastiness, some banana, spicy without any one spice leaping to the fore. Harmonized and very drinkable, probably one of those beers best not categorized, just enjoyed."

"Nice introduction to Virginian beer. Lots of character, but with a good, steady hand on the whacky factor. I feel like if this were even a couple of % ABV bigger it would be an absolute knock-out, as the main issue here is the oak is slightly too dominant. But if all Virginian brews are like this, I look forward to more."
"Overall, this is a very pleasant, drinkable brew with a lot going for it. If I was a tad disappointed with the palate, it's just because the nose was so wonderful and promised so much. But it's still very good stuff: rounded, integrated, and complete."
"Overall - Not sure what to make of this. Strange flavors that don't seem to work together."
"Overall - Interesting beer, Like a hybrid really, mix of Belgium pale, farmhouse and barrel aged pale ale. It gets better as it warms and more fruity notes come out. Good beer, wish the barrel oaked flavors were more present but overall was tasty."

"O: Really good brew and impressive what has been done with the flavors yet remains a relatively low ABV."
""
"It's a toasted golden with a solid sheet of yellowed cream. Smells of light belgian yeast, apple meat, some bretty character, caramel malts and some dried cut grass. Flavor is malty, biscuits, some oak, smoke, golden raisin, seltzer, a little bitterness and some metal on the finish. Body is medium with a fine, silky carb and a near bone dry finish. I was skeptical of this beer, but was surprised to find the belgian yeast wasn't too overpowering, while the oak was a nice second fiddle with this beer. Well done."

"Quite interesting, and pretty enjoyable & drinkable beer. IMHO, they should try putting this in 12oz bottles, and sell 6-ers. You could easily make your way thru a six-pack over a nice Spring/Summer evening."

"To the Point: plain old uninspiring, it was drinkable, I finished the whole bottle and the flavor nor the mouthfeel ever changed. I won’t buy again."

"Pours deep amber with thick head that dissipates to a nice cap. Aromas of banana, spice, and yeast. Yeasty flavor with sweet malt and spicy notes. Barrel-aging hardly noticable. Medium body with refreshing carbonation. An overall refreshing Belgian pale."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; best before June 2014 on the cork. Pours fairly hazy deep reddish orange color with a nice 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, apple, pear, floral, grass, pepper, light clove, light oak, wheat, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and hop notes with slight barrel presence. Taste of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, apple, pear, pepper, clove, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, pepper, clove, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of yeast and hop flavors; with a great balance of malt, hop, and spicy ester notes with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity if hop, yeast, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Even though the stated barrel aging presence was minimal, it wasn’t really a determining factor for me with this style. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Even though I still think $10.99 is still a bit higher than I think this beer ought to be, especially considering it's a local one, this was quite tasty and even better than I expected."
""
"O: An interesting beer, for sure; a variety of tastes not normally encountered with beer! I'd like to find the story behind this one..."
"You can taste a bit of the bourbon but damn this is an interesting beer.Strong barley malt presence up front with an faint oaky and vanilla flavor from the wood. Belgian yeast flavors quickly take over with a dried chalkyness and horse blanket like flavors. This then quickly rolls into an herbal hop bitterness. Very complex and layered beer. Very faint bourbon notes are present throughout as the beer warms but in no way are the forefront flavor of this beer allowing a lot of these other funky and complex flavors come forward. Extremely complex and layered with flavors that somehow roll into eachother extremely well despite how different they are. Super unique and unlike anything i've ever had. I love it."

"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, a bit dry and sticky on the tongue. An interesting take on the style, although the barrel character was a bit more muted than I was expecting."
"O: Based on other BA's reviews I think my bottle has developed into something different from what was originally there. Regardless, I thought it was a definite winner, perfect for a warm spring day. I found that each sip invited the next, and I enjoyed it more as it developed on my palate. Will look for a fresh one in the future to see how different it tastes."
"Great looking beer. Nose is nice. I have high expectations based on as much. The flavor delivery is...odd. At first I thought the goal was a Flemish tone on things, but I question if this was intentional. Seems to be off, with an aftertaste that is...off putting. Although, it seems to get better as time goes on. But it took a lot of time. A lot. A for effort, C (at best) for execution."
"3.86/5.00"
""
""
"OV: On the whole, disappointed with this brew. That off metallic flavour is stronger than the rest and I thought there weren't enough other flavours that could have been here that were missing. I wouldn't buy this one again, sorry to say."
""
""
"O: Interesting beer. It seems like an unplanned beer. That is a beer that came out differently than expected but you still like it. It pretty good but seems unrefined."
"Pours darker than expected, a deep auburn color with a nice, tall, airy head that deposits some fine lace on the glass. Subtle aroma...perfumy floral, apple, yeast, faint wood. Tastes of zesty citrus and Belgian yeast with some oak, leather, and a mineral note in the finish. Light malty sweetness and a raw, grassy hoppiness. Not much bourbon to be found, other than a hint of vanilla. Medium bodied and creamy. Interesting..."
"Overall: A lot of interesting things going on but I am not overly satisfied with the end result; the finish is a bit too sweet, given all the other things going on"

"the cork had a drink by march date on it, so i guess i just made the cut off - it had a slightly oxidized flavor, but i believe it helped the profile a bit. i'd have to get a fresher bottle to honestly tell. nonetheless, this is a pretty solid bpa in a beautiful bottle. i'd love to try more from this place."
""
""
"D: This was a really impressive brew, and a successful attempt at bourbon barrel aging a light Belgian ale. The coconut and woody aspects perfectly complemented the grassy and spicy character. The body was excellent also, with a smooth finish. Probably best fresh, but could maybe hold up for a few years. Recommended."

"O- I will give this beer credit for being different. The flavors sounded different, but after tasting this beer, it was even more different than I would have guessed."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the aroma. There was a hugely surprising Bretty sourness, adding the bite and tartness on par with some wilds. The flavor, however, continued this excitement only mildly. That sourness does work its way to the buds, but by the end it gets washed through a bit by pervasive malty background. This is a tasty beer and definitely worth a try…or two."
""
"Label says aged in White Oak bourbon barrels...beautiful as their native Brookie...who's Brookie? Where's the photos?!! I've got one more bottle...aging a year or two might negate some of the strangeness, but as the label says, it's an ""experimental sort of ale."""
"This beer is much better as it warms. I tested it at 57.7 degrees, near the bottom of my last glass, and it still had some of the musty bitterness I described before. If I tried this again I would try it at room temperature, as the last few swallows definitely tasted the best. Overall though, Blue Mountain Barrel House has the best Virginia beers I've tasted yet."
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, wood, and a slight bourbon aroma. Taste is much the same with a woody finish and a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought this had a nice blend of flavors, but the finial product was a bit strange as well. I'd have more."
""
"Lighter on the palate than expected with a healthy dose of bubbles. Flavors are interesting. Honey is predominant with light burnt caramel and subtle summer fruits. It finishes dry, and leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-really not a terrible beer. its fairly complex, yet somehow its quite boring. if any style comes to mind, its dark belgian ale. it basically just tastes like an american red ale with a certain but slight belgian kick. its okay but not necessarily worth a try. not something i'll be getting again, especially for the price tag."
""
""
"This is one of those beers that is fun to try, but not one I'd want to buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"In between light and mid somewhere. A nice level of carbonation, more than the appearance would lead. Pretty nice take on the style, with some uniqueness added."
"O: I was really expecting more bourbon and barrel presence in the beer and it disappointed in that respect. Also, the beer has some interesting components but it just does not feel well integrated or successful when put together."
"O- A very interesting beer, complex and fun to drink. The yeast, subtle hops, and barrel flavors work nicely together. Definitely give this a try if you come across it."
"O: The bourbon barrel aging definitely makes this the finish of this beer a little more interesting but it seems that this could have been better integrated into the overall taste. You really need to warm this beer up in order to taste the bourbon."
""
"O: Great example of an American Belgian Pale Ale: wtf is that, you say? More full-bodied, and a bit more complex, with added hop punch. Well-balanced and fun to drink. Should pair great with funky blue cheeses, spicy foods. Do a blind taste test with Flying Dog's Raging Bitch just for kicks."
"O: overall a weird amalgamation of flavors that is interesting, but nit necessarily delicious..."
""
""
""
"THis is a winner."
"Overall: A nicely comple and unique brew. This is a must try for the beer snob. The aroma differs greatly from the taste but compliants each other well."
"D - Very nicely done with a subdued but spicy yeast character and a really well played additional flavor from the barrel. not nearly as intense or crazy as the description on the bottle would imply, but very good nonetheless."
""
"O: I love Blue Mountain's beers, but I was somewhat disappointed with Local Species. It seems like a malt-forward beer should carry some distinctive malt flavor -- instead the barrel characteristics are the most interesting, and the maltiness is dulled. I would not go back to this one. I am going to hang onto the other bottle I bought to see if there is some other flavor development."
"O: a solid beer overall, thougb the chemical-like flavor is a bit off-putting."
"It has noticeable spice and sweetness up front, but quickly gives way to more bitter hops on the finish. The bourbon barrel aging is more apparent in the aroma than in the flavor profile, but the faintest hints of vanilla and smoke add character. Carbonation was slightly aggressive, but that's a minor complaint for a thoroughly enjoyable beer. If you happen to live in VA, local Trader Joe's outlets have picked up a decent chunk of Blue Mountain's product line. I strongly suggest picking some up if you happen to be a local species yourself."
"I wanted to like this beer as it is from a local brewery, but it has a strange aftertaste that I don't really like. I like Belgian beers and I like IPA's, but not this particular species. It says it is barrel aged and I usually like barrell-aged beer, but it almost has a chalky aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent beer. It definitely drinks as a belgian pale, but the hopping adds a distinct american influence. The bourbon barrel aging adds an entirely new, intriguing dimension."
