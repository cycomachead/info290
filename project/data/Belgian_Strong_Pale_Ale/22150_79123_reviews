"The flavor hits of heavy yeast quality with some banana, clove and more spice. A clean quality with some sweetness hiding the alcohol. A medium plus phenolic quality hits at the end as the beer dries out."
""
""
""
""
""
"WOW! It's must be made from leprechaun gold and unicorn tears."
"Overall:  This is an excellent Belgian-style golden ale.  Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  a very nice BSPA, almost bordering on a hoppy tripel.  I am down with this beer."
""

""

"Mild floral hoppy aroma. Medium carbonation. Taste is a nice light hop with a yeasty backbone. Very light for a 9% abv beer. Definitely pick one up if you can"
"On tap at the brewpub, light yellow pour, nice fruity Belgian spice, dry light bitter finish."
"Taste is very complex and interesting. Hints of dryness but with a silky smooth sweetness and a surprisingly medium full body perception. Alcohol is well hidden. ""Funk"" is subtle and adds more complexity than actual assertive flavors. A joy to sip on, my only wish is that is was a little lighter in mouthfeel and more digestible."
""

""
"So this is my second Stillwater beer.  This one was not as disappointing as the first but I am confused about the ratings.  Something off about the beer, I am really struggling to put my finger on it.  To much bad after taste, sticks to the back of the tongue.  Everything else seems good, but the off aftertaste kills the beer for me.  I am thinking that there is something in stillwater that does not work for me.  Hope you enjoy as much as the rAvg."

"Pale golden pour, no foam, a few stray bubbles. Translucent; not totally clear. Earthy scent, with a hint of alcohol. Strong ""Belgian"" tangy taste, but fairly dry, not very fruity or sweet. Hoppy, slightly bitter finish with a zing from carbonation. Fairly ""dry"" mouthfeel, light, bubbly, pleasant. Finish turns a little sour after a while. Overall, pretty pleasant with a few of the flavors a little off."

"Great stuff, really nice flavors without going out of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"The texture is silky with right amount of fizz. Excellent."
""
""
""
"Pours a one finger white head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Hazy straw color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light citrus nose and flavor is tart citrus with some sweet malt. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, it produces a nice off-white, finger and a half head.  Doesn't last long but leaves a nice little cap for the duration.  Minimal lacing.  Lovely little floating bits of ""sediment.""  As I drink this outside by the grill I notice the color of autumn leaves.  Smells fantastic.  Smells yeasty and citrusy at the same time.  It's a bold ad hoppy Belgian as described on the bottle.  I'm still getting a taste for Belgians but this one is most agreeable.  Smooth mouthfeel with just a hint of bitterness.  Despite it's relatively high ABV, it's not offensively alcohol-ee.  One wouldn't know it has a high percentage without reading the bottle... Or waiting for the inevitable pleasant buzz to start.  This is a tasty beer.  I don't review many beers but felt this was a worthy candidate.  Highly recommend Stillwater As Follows.  Cheers!"

"This is a wonderfully decadent ale. It would be nice to do a serious session of these drinking a whole bottle of four or so varieties. Alcohol daydream. Great brew - highly recommended."
"O - 4.5 - A great example of the style.  Clean and subtle, yet with strong alcohol and a bit of barnyard funk in the background.  Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really like this beer; verges on Belgian IPA territory but not overly hoppy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: a very good version of the style with high but very well-hidden ABV."
""
""
"3.91/5.00"
""
"Overall - Seriously good stuff. Lots of vibrant flavour and a complex taste that keep this beer very interesting throughout. It's also incredibly refreshing. A winner."
""
""
""
"Had no expectations at all when ordering this but it is a true diamond in the rough."
""
""
""
"Pour is hazed golden yellow with a tight white head. Nose is nice, moderate farmhouse yeast, lighter spice and lemon with faint notes of fresh grain. Taste is sweeter, farmhouse is present and still balanced. More lemon and pepper than the nose, well carbonated light body and fairly dry. Finish is sweet with grapefruit bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is following the nose yet expands with more herbal and resinous hops mixed with the grassy flavor yet mild astringency with gentle yeast with peppery accent and moderately high carbonation adding to the yeast tanginess in the back of the throat. The flavor is lightly pine oriented with gentle zest and the yeast also brings a vinous element to mind. Overall a very complex Belgian Strong pale with tons of hoppy yeasty cohesion and dry finish making it all the more drinkable. For the 9% it packs you barely get any alcohol in the flavor-deceptive is right!"
"Overall: A very good take on a Belgian style Strong Ale. Good mix of yeast and spice notes with a nice citrus presence."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/13/2013. Pours hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice/hop bitterness on the finish, with some slight fruity tartness; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, black pepper, clove, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: decent. Not excellent. A bit under-carbonated for the style in my opinion. The bitterness is a bit too much for the style. I like it, don't love it."
""
""
""
"O: Certainly not blown away by this one. A good beer, and certainly worth a try, but lacks many (most) of the characters I look for in a Belgian Strong Pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good stuff! Easy drinking for 9 percent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very good Belgian style brew has hint of a tripel and a saison hoppy and fruity ABV is hidden for a 9%"
"Wow, serious brew, yet can just about drink the hell out of it. Very true to style. Great body, excellent finish, though a tad rich. Nice appearance with good head retention. Exotic aroma. Odd in that on one hand it seems balanced, yet it's also got some extremes. A little boozy too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great drinkability and price for value. True to style and rivalling of any top tier Belgian BPAs I've had to date."

"Overall a very solid Belgian pale from Maryland. Glad to have these guys in Colorado."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Love Stillwater's beers and think they do awesome belgian, saison beers and this is no exception. Highly drinkable and the 9.0% is not apparent. Pick it up and enjoy."
""
""
"O- Overall I really like this beer. I wish everything lined up more like the nose and that the mouthfeel were a little better. If it did then this would be one of the best available beers in my book. A very enjoyable version of my favorite style."
"Bottom Line: I paid $2 for a 12oz bottle and am more than happy. It's a great beer. You should try it if you see it, although I'd suggest buying a single or draft before going in on the 4pk if you aren't aware of Stillwater's other beers."
""
"Easily one of the best BSPA's I've tried."
""
""
"Oh, and absolutely love the bottle label."
"3.5/3.75/4/3.75/3.75"
"I think this is a nice representation of a belgian golden ale. Love the dry finish and the light mouthfeel. You'd never know this beer was 9%, until you had 2 or 3..."
""
""
""
"O: Crisp, refreshing, a little hoppy...this Belgian has it all."
"good stuff yet again from Stillwater. this one is a hazy bright yellow brew with a heck of a nice looking two inches of pure white head, but it fades out after a minute or so. the nose is fruity, green apples and grapes, its wine or cider-like in character, with some good strong Belgian yeast. the label says hoppy, and so did the guy at the bottle shop, but I didn't find this to be a particularly hoppy brew, not by my standards anyhow. some decent citrus hops in the flavor, but this is far from a hop forward brew. its driven by Belgian yeast for sure. long apple tasting finish, not sure if I love that part. carbonation is good at first pour, but like the head it doesn't hold, and the last few sips are nearly flat. very well hidden booze strength though, this is a lot more drinkable than 9% abv probably should be. good beer all in all, not stillwaters most challenging brew, but I liked it for what it is."
"This was a terrific Belgian Pale for Stillwater."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A little surprised. I find a lot of Belgian golden ales are technically good but still not enjoyable. This is both. It may not be Damnation but it is definitely worth a try. I will be buying this again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow I have never had anything from Still Water before today and I can say as someone who has tried their share of farmhouse beers in the midwest this beer really knows how to represent that huge saison taste. This is a great beer and something that is definitely 4-pack worthy at the very least."
"Fabulous and understated."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and citrus and pineapple-like aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, yeast, and fruity flavors on the finish. I am not sure if there is Brett in this one, but it does have a similar aspect in the taste. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has some really nice aromas and flavors that make it super easy to drink."

"A great Belgian inspired ale from Stillwater."
"Another interesting brew from Stillwater. I like the interplay between the spicy yeast and the stone-citrus fruit hops. Drinks very easy for 9% and lots of interesting nuances of flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer, but less captivating than I was hoping. I would not have again."
"O: Intense, yet delicate, As Follows is sun in a glass. The alcohol is noticeable and could be blended better, but the alcohol does not take away from the refined power of this beer. Enjoy it in sips."
""
"Overall: One recommendation, mix the yeast at the bottom of this beer as soon as you get a chance. Mixing it in exponentially improves this beer. I like what the brewery is doing, they for sure have a style, but if its not broke don't fix it."
"Overall very drinkable, good flavors, and a very good take on the style"

"This is far from my favorite style of beer and I seldom drink these. If I want a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, I'll grab a Duvel and revel in its lovely, irresistible champagne-like character. This one lacks that stony dryness that I love so much, and instead opts for a fruit and peppery flavor that I'm sorry to say doesn't completely agree with my palate. I doubt I'll buy it again, but I really appreciate the complexity and challenge to my senses that this beer brings and it meets the style description quite well, so for that I give it high marks. It definitely has a lot going for it and has me wondering if I should explore more Belgian Strong Pale Ales to see what else is out there."
""
""
""
"The feel is fluffy and well-carbonated without being too filling or hard. Crispness runs through, and there's a certain depth to the light body Stillwater seems to have mastered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good. The discrepancy between the nose and the flavour is remarkable, but both are very good in different ways. The hops really play a bigger role in this beer than is typical for the style, but it works."
""
""
" Overall: Really enjoyable, and unlikely light body for a high ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Cantaloupe rind and woody/herbal hop bitterness up front. Sweetish malt and fruit quickly take over. Pear and fruit cocktail mix with banana and under-ripe peach. Some sweetness, but alongside some welcome tangy, almost tart, -ness. Herbal hop bitterness increases into the finish. Belgian yeast all over this thing, and it's a good thing. A little peppery spice in the finish. Lingering woody hop bitterness and pear malt sweetness. Medium full body with a slightly syrupy feel. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with billowing white head, settles very slowly to half an inch, with thick rings down the glass. Smell: doughy, spicy, slightly herbal, nectarine, pineapple note. Taste: peach, pear, white grape, spicy, citrus peel and alcohol notes. Carbonation pushes it to full bodied. Tasty."
""
"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought that it was a very good example of the style that blurred the line between a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a Farmhouse Ale, it had the complexity and drinkability that I really look for in this style, it was pretty much exactly what I want in this style. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, crisp and refreshing with the taste doing a great job at holding my attention, this is the type of beer that I would have no problem drinking the whole 750ml bottle, it's a great summer time beer that keeps me coming back for more. What I liked the most about this beer was how balanced it was, no aspect was too overpowering and it looked very good from the bottle to what was inside it. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it wasn't super expensive at $9.99 for 750ml but that would prevent me from buying it often, I know STillwater just started selling some of their beer in 12oz four packs and I think that would be the perfect format for this beer. I would buy this beer again, it's a great beer to cool off with during the summer heat and I would recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales or Farmhouse Ales. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, this is the second beer I've had from Stillwater and this one is even better than the first one I had, Stillwater is on my radar now and I will for sure be on the look out for more of their beers. This is one of the better Belgian Strong Pale Ales that I have had so far, good job guys, this is one great beer."
""
"A pretty enjoyable BSPA, the fruit and spice well rendered, the yeast on its best behaviour, not to mention the mostly AWOL alcohol (say that ten times fast!). I'm glad to finally come across a Stillwater offering where I can associate it directly to a given style. Not that they have to brew that way at all, but when I start to notice patterns like that, it sort of hinders overall recognizance, ya know?"

"O: Really good stuff."
""
"D/O: Fairly light and refreshing for a strong ale, this beer is strange perhaps because of the way that is retains levity in the face of what ought to be burdensome flavor and texture. The combination of stale and creamy is not one often encountered."
"Very nice, has a great farmhouse quality to it."

"Very saison, yet it is not. Golden ale smell. Very good for the style. A tasty spicy fruity apricot peach creation, with white pepper. Big head. Smooth above average mouthfeel. Nicely hopped. Yeasty but it is well integrated. Very drinkable.Bottle from Premiere."
""
"Sour flavor start with a bitter finish. Good lemon rind and peppery hop finish. Short aftertaste that is a blend of the hop and the soured malt. Less Belgian in the flavor than in the smell. Thinnish body with ample carbonation. Overall, a classic Belgian pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"D= The alcohol stays well hidden, making this a dangerous beast. I would gladly drink this again, and again."
""
""
""
"D - Nice balanced BSPA. Good mix of spices, yeast character, and malt flavors."
""
""
""
"Beer is a little spicy with a nice floral character and an almost champagne like yeastiness to it. A very effervescent beer with a nice finish. Decent saison."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty tasty, complex and well done take on the style. Solid brew."
""
""
"O-Well balanced and tons of flavor. Never head of the brewery before and was drawn in by the artwork. Look forward to trying more of their beers."
""
"O: Truly a work of art, I am hard pressed to name a Belgian ale I've enjoyed more, even my beloved sours. The smell is fantastic, it's everything I want in a Belgian with excellent balance. There was so much going on in the first couple sips it took me a minute to get my brain around all that was going on with the flavor."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a gold color with a couple inch white fluffy head that stays around a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and fruity, the brew smells like pears, lemon peel, bready malt/wheat, peppery spice, cloves, and a bit of tropical fruit. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but I think the spicy and bready flavors are stronger than the fruity ones. There's also the addition of some green grapes and an herbal flavor to the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with high but soft carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, even though it has a bit too much carbonation for me. With that being said, I'd like to try it again in the future. $9.99 a bottle."
""
"Flavors are well integrated and the overall feel is very smooth. Moderate spice, dry herbal and bitter, light clover honey on the back end. Somewhat grassy, leaning toward hops but it could be a bittering spice instead, hard to pin down. Possibly some chamomile in there. Medium bodied with very charged carbonation. Nice with washed rind cheese or charcuterie."
""
""
"Poured from tap into snifter at barley oak in mandeville, LA. Pours a golden straw with good head and lacing. Smells of great belgian wheaty yeast and slight funk. Taste is citrusy hoppy belgian wit. Mellowed out by nice malty flavors and a slight alcohol burn. A bit dry but bursting of belgian pale flavors. Great brew and reminds me of a slightly hoppy and ""wit"" saison."
""
"[O] One of Brian's best yet."
"O- A pretty solid BSPA, good work from Stillwater."
"Where we're quick to applaude Delirium Tremens, Piraat, and Lucifer ales for exhibiting similar and authentic Belgian character, let's not forget to throw this one into the conversation as well."
"O - This was a really tasty Belgian-style ale. Another great Stillwater brew."
""
"jd"
"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a light, clear golden amber with a massive slightly off-white head and pillowy lacing. A careful pour had half a glass of foam, which slowly formed large bubbles but had good retention. Aroma of apple, grape and pear juice, Belgian spicing yeast reminiscent of saison. Flavor dry, apples, pears, slight citrus, light bready malt, finishing with and interesting spicy herbal taste, similar to sage or rosemary. Bitter herbal and citrus peel aftertaste that had interesting enough flavor to be enjoyable. Light to medium bodied, but active carbonation gave this a pleasant mouth feel. Another interesting and off-the-main-road ale from Stillwater. These guys are great."
""
"O- As Follows (like everything else I've found from Stillwater) is a well done and interesting beer. The alcohol isn't noticeable at all and I gladly went for a second pint. Very different and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden, diaphanous ale with a thick, three fingers of light cream. This falls slowly. Smells of hops, and strongly of fresh mint (never had this experience with hops, but I’ve heard tell of it). Hints of resin, skunk, Belgian yeast, earthy hay and soil. Flavor is exceptional: grain, measured bitterness, hints of grass and classy Belgian yeast character. Nicely balanced and tasty. Medium bodied with hi, sparkly carb, even a bit too high. Semi dry finish. A really fine beer. I questioned this brewery with its obscure labels and sudden appearance in my area, this is worth it."
""
"O - A really nice Saision that's semi-floral and on the sweeter side of the style."
""
""
""
"o - overall a nice belgian strong pale ale. a bit on the spicy peppery side of things and earthy like a saison, but solid none-the-less. i tend to prefer a bit less spicing and more sweetness."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of earthy hops, sweet fruit, zesty spice and Belgian yeast notes. Less hop forward than the nose suggests but there's still a decent amount of earthy pine and sweet citrus/tropical fruit. Hints of mango, pineapple and lemon peel a lot with spicy, grassy bitterness. Not very dry however with bready yeast, alcohol and light fruit countering the hops. Peppery spice with possibly some coriander followed by hints of apple, pear and booze. Subtle heat but the high ABV is well masked makin it easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O. A very nice Beglian Pale. The yeast, spice, hops, and sugars are balanced near perfectly. A very hoppy and phenolic finish without being overwhelming. Well-crafted, highly recommended."
"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a cloudy golden body. Aroma is full with corriander citrus and Belgian yeast. Standard Stillwater aroma. Very herbal taste with Belgian yeast and clove up front finishing with a citrus and herbal hop character. Lighter side of medium body and moderate carbonation. Another very nice brew from Stillwater. The Belgian character is excellent ad the semi dry finish is right on for the style."
""
"So drinkable, another winner from Stillwater. So happy to get this in Mizzou, they seem at least 3 bucks a bottle cheaper than what I saw in North Carolina"
""
"Very drinkable and more complex than most Belgo Strong Pales I've had, mostly due to this one not being all esters."
""
"Something just makes me buy every single Stillwater release that I come across. Anyway, This beer poured out as a lightly hazy yellow color. The head was massive even with a slow pour it was out of control. The head was fluffy and white. The smell of the beer had a slight herbal note to it along with some grains that add a bit of sweetness on the nose. The taste of the beer has a clean refreshing taste to it with some a light lemon-like flavor in there. The yeast and herbal notes are the most flavorful. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied, very drinkable and gently carbonated. Overall it's not my favorite from Stillwater, but I do enjoy trying everything that comes from this brewery."
"This beer is a real winner, very impressed by it, Stillwater really nailed this one. I would love to have this again."
""
"O: One of the most likeable BSPAs I've had in awhile. Drinkable."
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I quite enjoyed this beer and would be happy to have it again in the future. My overall impression is of a well-made beer worth sampling and having more than once. I certainly would be willing to have this one again."
""
""
""
"Served in a tulip glass, a cloudy bronzed yellow color with a small cap of white head that sinks to a ringlet. Aroma of bready yeast, pale malts, spice, light fruits, leafy hops. The taste reflects the aroma, bready yeast and malts, herbal hops, moderately bitter, peppery spice, and a touch of grass. Strange metallic twinge in the aftertaste, but within tolerance. Medium body, crisp, drying, and nice overall."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Very nice. Overall, a very nice BPA that I would definitely have again."

"D - 9% is almost non-existent. Lemon zest refreshes the palate decreasing fatigue. An easy drinker for such a big beer."
""
""
"O: Barnyard, earth and rye dominate the flavor profile. Lemon zest and hints of coriander lye beneath. Very refreshing and easy drinking albeit very funky. The 9% abv is masked extremely well."
""
"O- Really good, and 9% ABV is very well hidden. I had this on draft and it is not as good, less complex, I am guessing that warmth is helping the flavor too. Very tasty, definitely will be buying more."
"O: The alcohol in this beer is very well hidden—it drinks like a regular saison but with the flavors kicked up a notch."
"O: Very enjoyable and very easy to drink. The alcohol is quite well hidden but with the higher ABV this beer is just a little too strong to be sessionable. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and would definitely have it again."
"wow. tried both the draft and bottled version. i thought the bottled version was showing slightly better. both were fantastic. sort of a super-saison. best analogy that i can make is as follows is to stateside as avec les bon voeux is to saison dupont. here goes: pours a hazy, glowing white gold with a huge, lively white head that shrinks to proper, holds well and leaves tons of lace. nose is full of spicy phenols and fruity esters that seem to just shoot up in to the olfactory factory. i get white pepper and other bright spices at first, which seems to be balanced by pineapple, lemon, peach and maybe some melon. a touch of sweet(ish) doughy/bready malt pokes it head through to create some backbone as well. taste is boom! blast off! fitting to be drinking Stillwater's anniversary beer on the same day as the anniversary of the first space voyage. astronaut Yuri Gagaran would enjoy this, no doubt. taste is all of the spicy, fruity, malty (yeasty, hoppy) notes that i described above translated in an almost weightless body and amplified by fairly zippy carbonation and a pleasant boozy heat. spice notes seemed to lean a bit towards herbs in the middle, and i was thinking i could taste white sage and/or a hint of eucalyptus. it had me thinking super-stateside at first, then super-cellar door, then i realized this was just super-stillwater. stillwater turned up to 11. created on earth but heard in outer space. extremely well-balanced. long spicy finish with a very clean end. i really enjoyed this one."
""
"Hazy yellow with a dense, white head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing, this is a great-looking tripel. The nose is wonderful. Yeasty, spicy and with a nice herbaceous lemony character, fresh cut grass and dry pale malt with a touch of honey, this is very enjoyable. The palate has a nice lemon-like hop character, a very nice herbal character, moderate yeast (pepper and other spices) and a crisp, clean malt profile. Drying and spicy on the finish, this beer is light in body, crisply carbonated and thoroughly refreshing. The ABV is very well hidden too. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall: I enjoyed the herbal notes in this beer. I thought it was light and easy to drink given the abv. I would have it again."
"Body is light and somewhat effervescent with a dry, semi-bitter finish. Often times it feels like the mouthfeel is one of the better portions of Brian's beers, and this one is no exception. Very tasty overall."
""
"Nothing extraordinary, but another solid beer from Stillwater nonetheless."
