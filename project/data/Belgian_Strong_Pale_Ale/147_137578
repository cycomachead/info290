3.66,-0.3,4.25,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was nice beer, but I wouldn't say it's a great example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, since I didn't pick up much Belgian yeast and to me it tastes me like a Pale Ale base, as an herb/spiced beer I would say it's a little above average for the style.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, slightly refreshing, crisp, a little prickly, not too filling and the taste just did an ok job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, anymore than that and I might start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but it just got to be a little bland and I didn't find it to be too memorable.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try and I wouldn't turn down a glass of it, but it's not something I feel the need to buy more of.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Hibiscus in their beer, I thought that aspect was showcased better than just about every other Hibiscus beer I've had.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it had some good aspects to it, but it also had some that needed a little work and in the end I just wanted a little more out of this beer.  It isn't a favorite Stone beer or a favorite from this series, but it is one of the best Hibiscus beers I've had.  Nice job guys, this was a solid beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Dec 26, 2014"

Aromas of heavy floral notes, tangy sweet old world fruit, bubble gum, cotton candy, toasted grains, subtle citrus highlights, and hints of bitter hops characteristics. Interesting. Flavors are mild, with berry sweetness and fairly heavy floral notes forward. There is a tangy sweet fruit note, with the aforementioned berry highlighted by orange, and a building bitterness in the undertones of the palate. Fairly muted feel, remaining light overall. The aftertaste is more of the citrus acidity, as well as floral and hops bitterness. The finish is fairly short-lived, with only the slightest fruit and floral linger.

3.9,6.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy deep red-orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/spice/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced Belgian pale ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 29, 2014"

Aroma of strawberries, stone fruit with an overripe fruit or tropical flower component. Flavor is orange citrus and overripe tropical fruit, berries, slightly buttery wheat; finishes with floral fruit and a slight clove astringency. Medium bodied with good carbonation. An appropriately floral influenced Belgian with interesting but odd fruit flavors. Slightly unbalanced; the malt body does not seem to support the floral and fruit flavors throughout the taste.
