"Goes down easy. Appears to be session able, but packs a wallop"
""
"Overall: 8% is totally hidden.  I can see why they named this after the devil.  Despite my appreciation for how representative it appears to be of the style, this is not my style.  I like phenols in whisky, not so much in beer. (I took note to leave the sediment in the bottle - had a bad experience with that once before, learned by lesson)."
"O: A classic. Good restaurants should have this beer and if they do, order it."
""
"Deceptively higher in alcohol is the trademark of the Belgian brews and this is no different. If you follow the instructions of the brewery its recommended to leave a cm of liquid in the settled bottle unless you like the taste of yeast. A meal in a glass! Classic."
"So much fun to drink. One of my favorites."

"Hazy golden yellow, with a nice two-finger head of white fluffy bubbles, great retention and lacing.  Aroma is overripe apples, lemon, and that great belgian yeasty funky smell. Taste is tart and lemony, with some nice funk up front, and I get some apple and pear on the back end. Mouthfeel is very crisp with a nice dry finish. Overall, this is just an outstanding beer."
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a very well-made beer.  Complex and enjoyable.  I'm glad that it's one of the more widely available Belgian beers in the US.  Forget Miller High Life, this is the champagne of beers!"
"This is the closest thing I've ever had to a perfect beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Also, the carbonation of this beer is unreal. Pour very, very slowly!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer at all and one I would see out again. Cool that you get a glass for such a good deal and easily found in most stores that sell decent beer."

"Great taste, but not the best.  Great if there is no other option."

"Poured a 330 into a tulip, not a Duvel chalice. I'm OK with that. This was a bright gold with a giant white head that just lasted and lasted. Upon settling, there were nice lacings floating about.  The aroma gave spice and a hint of the tart fruit that would come in the sip.  The flavor was a neat and spicy up front (allowing the nose to influence). Across the palate there was a nuanced maltiness, so slight it wasn't biscuit but more sourdough bread - but this was a background note. There was an underlying tone of ""European"" less ""Belgian.""  It finished with a lovely tartness that at first seemed like a mild citrus but upon reflection was more like a apple or pear. The lager people would say ""crisp."" Some reviews mentioned some alcohol in the finish, but I did not sense that s being of note (even though it is an 8.5). Pretty big bubbles in the carbonation, which gave a nice complement to the crispness. Awfully refreshing for an 8.5 brew."
""
""
""
""
"3/2 Bottle - Nice pour, dark orange in colour with minimal white head. Fruity malt smell was pleasant. Tasted somewhat strong, decent texture, felt good drinking it. Didn't feel as strong as the ABV. Overall good beer offering."
""
"Smooth and delicious. I would like to go to Belgium now."
""
"Good yeast flavors. Chewy body. Light color."
"The taste is sweet and fruity, with balanced alcohol content. Light beer with good carbonation and end with low bitterness and dry."
""
""
""
""
"330ml bottle poured into tulip. Appearance is cloudy and light golden in color with a towering white head that slowly collapses. Lots of lacing all over the glass. Aroma is of ripe apples, pears, spices, cereal malt sweetness, and alcohol. Taste is lightly sweet with notes of fruit and cereal, balanced by a little grassy hop bitterness and spicy/peppery bite. Light bodied, creamy, champagne-like carbonation and drying finish."
""
"One of the classics. Love it!"
"My first Duvel and what a treat!  I can absolutely understand how people could call this the best in the world, although I'm not quite there - tend to think I'm still looking.  It's beautiful yellow-orange with a fluffy head and clouds up just a tad at the end when the sediment/yeast makes it out on the last drop.  Nice citrus and floral on the nose, but the yeast really steals the show.  It's a sweet organic scent that I normally wouldn't call appealing, but this just seems different, like the mastermind behind a great symphony.  And the music that follows is special.  Bright, bubbly, and complex, but balanced in an uncanny way.  Didn't realize this was 8.5% until after I drank it, you'd never know.  Could very well be the best there is, but Belgium definitely is."

"I love this beer. Pours so well, nice foamy head, carbination is out of this worls, just love watching the bubbles eminate within the light body. One of the best beers I have tasted."

"Dive bar, Amsterdam, drunk football hooligan won't go away and getting menacing. Suddenly it's sweetness, butterscotch and then a touch of citrus. It's good, it's really good. It's my first Duvel and I'm an instant fan. Can you be a beer hooligan, stupid question."

"Pours a brilliant clear golden color with a big two finger fluffy white head that lasts.  Aroma is very citric and yeasty.  Taste is boozy(not a bad thing in this beer), hay like and yeasty,  with a small amount of hops.  Mouthfeel feel light-medium and very carbonated.  Overall a very interesting beer that drinks easy but is easy to savour.  I can see why it is held in such high esteem."

"O: Very good beer, not what I usually look for but itÂ´s great."
""
"Good beer,bad game...would rather spend the whole night out in the cold, pulling sludge at a waste water plant than see a game like that one again...the beer i will be revisiting sometime soon....the game,i would like erased from my memory banks forever."

""
""
""
""
"Top notch.  This is an example of why our friends in Belgium have their deserved reputation."
""
""
"Woah, this is a very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  I never gave it the chance because I thought it would be significantly less refreshing and never was too keen on the bottle shape.  I could not be more incorrect.  Refreshing, carbonated and perfectly balanced into a magnificent ale that bursts with flavors.  The drinkability is phenomenal, and the alcohol is masked perfectly.  Pretty good price too, I will absolutely be picking up more of this when I run out."
"I can easily see why the Duvel is enjoyed by so many for its remarkable balance and craft. One of the best pale ale ever tasted."

"Pours with a very large white head. Has a beautiful golden color. Aroma is very sweet and slightly hoppy. Taste is a perfect balance of hops and sweetness.  Goes down incredibly smooth. A perfect golden ale."
"V - Quite expensive at 15 dollars a four pack."
""
""
"Heavy on the alcohol, yet light, yet satisfying. An unlikely contradiction that is so true you have to taste it. Simple ingredients with deep complexity. Epic head. If poured correctly, the last sip of beer will be all foam. And it'll get you buzzed in a hurry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Incredibly well crafted beer. The fact that it is 8.5%, but drinks like a session ale is awesome in and of itself. Delicious and beautiful. I would recommend this 100%."
""
""
""
""
"Hard to rate as I have encountered problems recently. Two cases recently have each contained several bottles which were bad. You can tell them as soon as opened - they start to overflow the bottle, and are so over-carbonated you can barely get them into a glass. Taste is nasty too. Rest of bottles in case are fine. I would rate 5 if not for the bad ones."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with billowing white head, settles slowly to a thick cap, thick lace down half of the glass. Smell: pear, orange peel, floral and lightly spicy with some background white grape sweetness. Nice but subdued. Taste: quite spicy, grassy and lightly herbal, soft sweet apple, pear, lemon rind. Velvety feel, finishing peppery and dry. Delicious. Best by 11/2016."
""
""
"Crisp and frothy, spicy and bitter, and yet lightly sweet and fruity. The aroma isn't especially appealing, but overall it makes for a pleasurable drinking experience."
""
""
"Pretty good, liked it till last drop"
""
""
"Poured in a Duvel glass from the famous brown wide 330ml bottle. 7 euros (8,40 dollars) for 6 of these bottles in most Dutch supermarkets makes it quite a cheap option for such a special beer as well. Having too work your way through the entire glass in less than 45 minutes is actually quite an exercise as it turns out, as the beer is pretty heavy I must say, at 8,5% ABV."

"Top notch, world class beer; as close to perfection as you can get. Light, fresh, with ample carbonation and a pleasant taste. The 8.5% ABV is undetectable."
""

"Wonderful beer!!!  Definitely recommend and will be stocking up on this one."
""
""
"Easy go to belgium that will please novice and geek!"
""
"Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Good hop/malt balance.  Banana, lemon, and spicy taste and smell.  Carbonation tickles the tongue.  Hides the high ABV very well!  I could drink these all night : )"

"The best beer in the world."
"I aged this beer for just over a year to see how it turned out. While very similar to the original, it has more yeastiness to the flavor and aroma. Almost a slight funk to it (not in a bad way). However, it doesnât change enough to warrant the year of aging, but it was still fun to try!"

"Decadent and fancy looking but not necessarily the top for me.  Taste wise, it's a great belgian.  Nice light color, enough carbonation but not too much, but taste was nothing to shout about for me.  Great though for celebrations."

"750 ml Bottle.Very sweet and very fruity.Pears apples a touch of banana.It`s not a bad beer but it`s not something I would get again.I read a lot of reviews on this so I had to try it."
""
"Overall - Normally, I'm focused on the malt/hop ratio. This beer, however, is a different animal. The interplay between the fruit, sour, and spice flavors make for a unique experience. Eminently drinkable (despite the rather high alcohol content)."

"A yeasty sweetness is paired with spices and pepper, creating a crisp, vivid mouthfeel with a refreshing and still peppery aftertaste. Complex and challenging, at first impression, the various flavors seem to collide, but they all end up in a very well composed beer with gentle sweetness and complex body. Reminds me of summer, sun, fresh cut grass and flowers. Very easy to drink despite its 8,5% volume in it. Classic."

"BBD 7/16.  Clear very light amber pour (pale gold).  Superb head, lacing and retention.  Wonderful nose of spicy Belgian yeast, banana, sweet fruit (pear with hints of orange) and subtle biscuit.  Light medium body, yet nice and slick.  Heavily carbonated with rich effervescent rushes throughout the profile. The flavor profile is of normal intensity, complex and balanced.  The 8.5% alcohol is perfectly hidden.  It begins with the fruit flavors, then flows into a light biscuit sweetness.  In the middle, an effervescent light hop bitterness emerges coupled with a light note of pepper.  The finish is rather clean, somewhat dry and a light bitterness lingers a bit over a blend of the previous flavors while notes of clove come to the forefront.  World Class and one of the highest scores I've ever given."

"Pours a cloudy brown with a thin head that trails the glass. Smells of banana and wheat while having a good amount of hops on the back end. The taste is sweet in the beginning and then transfers to more earthy tones, before a crisp finish that leaves you wanting more. A must try for me."

"This is quite possibly as close to perfection as a beer can get. It's beauty and quality is subtle and not easy to discern for the non experts. The first sip feels heavily carbonated and one might be tempted to wonder what all the fuss is about. However, this beer is meant to be sipped slowly. After a while, as the carbonation settles and the beer warms up the taste becomes more pronounced. As you get to the bottom of the snifter glass you feel a poignant sadness that it is all about to end. The taste is so unique; it feels like you are drinking a white wine at times. The alcoholic content is high, yet the flavor is so clean and the taste so pure, I didn't even feel a buzz. (I mean this in a good way) it is a taste I will dream about and think about for a while."

"The flavor is a crisp, fruity blend with an undercurrent of black pepper and a surprisingly sweet finish. Feels light and sharp on the tongue. This is a unique and complex tasting brew that every craft beer fan should try."

"Completely hazy with decent white head, receding slowly to some laces on a surface. Smell is delicate - spices, pale malts. Taste is a bit citrusy and spicy, pilsner malts, excellent ample hop bitterness, dry aftertaste. Owing to czech ingredients (malts & hops), the beer bears some czech characters, generously enriched with belgian yeasts fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good beer.  The taste is very pleasant.  Malty wheatiness, without much bitterness.  The look is nothing special, and the same with the smell."

"330ml bottle ($3.82) from Premier in Halifax. Aroma has pleasant hints of citrus hops. Pours an almost clear pale golden colour, with white head. Has a light sweet taste. Body is medium, oily texture, with lively carbonation. I remember drinking a darker Duvel a few years ago, so it was a bit disappointing to see that this one is so pale. Still a great brew."

"Taking advantage of the promotion and Free Shipping discount to know this classic Belgian beer; I think it will be up to a parameter as paid, at most, to know a beer, i.e., up to R$ 0.04/ml. Appearance: a 750 ml bottle brings sophistication in simple; the tulip was unable to effect the imp in the bottle, but it should be because the glass is not the brand, with laser engraved (my mother said a pebble in the background would make the effect); abundant, fleeting foam to keep enough; citrus color, translucent. Aroma: It is not unpleasant, but simple, refers to a citrus. Taste: balanced, it seemed like a champagne beer, at first I did not feel the alcohol, but it rises quickly to noggin (inset). Anyway, I was happy to try this beer, but I can not pay more for it, value more when the hops are more pronounced (personal taste)."
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18D). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L42401 0224. AROMA: esters aromas reminiscente of oranges and some pears. low sweet malt background. very low no non-existent hop character. some spicy alcohol aromas. APPEARANCE: light gold color with a bit of haze. large white head that persists for very long time. characteristic viscosity leading to belgian lacing. TASTE: faint fruity flavours mixed with a low sweet background. medium bitterness that lingers beyond a dry finish. some spicy alcohol notes. PALATE: medium-low body with high carbonation. some astringency is present as some alcohol warmth. OVERALL: a classic but now it seems with less overall quality."

"O â Duvelâs reputation precedes it, so itâs hard to separate that out when evaluating. Luckily it lives up to the hype. An incredibly refreshing ber, with complex flavor and aroma profiles, that can also knock you on your ass if you arenât paying attention. Fantastic."

"Poured light golden hazy summer-straw colour, with a fluffy dreamy-white cotton wool head. If the different flavours were acting out a play on your tongue it would be truly Shakespearean: villainous spice, beautiful malt, godly yeast, funky, tangy, fruity and musty all in near-perfect balance. One of the timeless classics of the beer world..."
""

"Was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised to see that its very good. Very simple flavor, I would say pear like with a bitter hop taste.  No complex or multiple flavors, just pear like.  No detection of alcohol either."

"O: Great beer. I think I ruined it to start with because it was too cold right out of the fridge. The musty flavor overpowered the beer at low temperature while the other flavors receded. Once it warmed up it rounded out beautifully."

"I cannot get enough of this beer. The color is golden and clear. The head is white and thick. What brings me back to this beer is the taste. It is just perfect. Smooth, goes down easy and just begs to have two or three per sitting. I wish I could stock this beer in my kegertor."
"As previously mentioned, the head on this beer is just beautiful, although for me it did not last as long as it seems to have for others. Pure white, fluffy, initially three fingers high but fading to one finger and then just a ring after a few minutes, although the carbonation was superb and lasted the entire time. The color of the beer is a rich golden orange in the glass. The nose on this beer is very nice and spicy, and hoppier than the flavor seems to be (until you get to the pleasant lingering tartness at the finish). This beer was challenging, in a good way, as it has so much going on. I found it much more enjoyable as it warmed a bit, since I think I served it a bit too cold initially. The flavor is yeasty and spicy, with some fruit but not too much sweetness, and a tangy bite in the finish. Would cheerfully have again...one of the best beers I have ever tried. Would highly recommend to anyone...am looking forward to my dark-beer-obsessed husband to try this golden ale and see how complex and rich a golden ale can be."

"Overall: We all know that 'Duvel' is one of those classics that work whenever and wherever; cool summer nights or by the fireplace in the dead of winter - a true classic. However, I felt that it was missing an extra...something. To be fair, I will stand behind 'Duvel' as one of the ""can't-go-wrong"" beers, but if only it had an extra bit of 'oomph'..."

"Had this poured out of the bottle into a snifter. I've heard nothing but good things about Duvel, and was happy to hear that it lived up to its hype. Beautiful deep golden color. Fruity aromas. Crisp finish with notes of apple and orange. Also love the classic label. Awesome stuff."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 26, 2014... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... OCCASION: NBA Draft Day 2014--Cavs take Wiggins and intend to keep him...APPEARANCE: two-tiered head--rocky, mountainous atop bubbly,, crystal white that occupies half the glass; slightly opaque golden body with a wellspring of bubbles centering the glass; lacing is appealing... AROMA: brilliant pilsner introduction; fragrant floral, perfumed hops; some suggestions of pepper...desirable... PALATE: quick, aggressively smooth with a solid, lingering finish--a bit dry and mouth-watering... TASTE: honey and hops are warming--nectar of the gods! a bit sweet, like a Riesling--but oh so rewarding... OVERALLL: only three sips are needed to bring the tingle, not unlike your team drafting first overall for the third time in four years; as its name suggests, sadistically drinkable, tempting with crisp, clean flavor, then punishing with cruel, powerful alcoholic hammers...the steep price--literally and figuratively--is unfortunately warranted."

"It seems there is little to say about an ale that is in many ways the faultless, platonic ideal of the style - although my personal tastes leave me wanting more complexity (and I prefer the tripel-hop by a substantial margin; or even some of the domestic takes on an ""Imperial Pilsner"" a style clearly influenced by Duvel)."

"O - One of the best Strong Pale Ales on the market. It's clean and refreshing, with the perfect balance of sweet malts and hop bitterness. It also delivers a punch at 8.5% in that sneaky Belgian way. This is one of my go-to beers, especially in the summer."

"At $4.49 a bottle at my bottle shop, this is not something I'd revisit very often at all -- I was tip-toeing around it at the store, but finally took the plunge. Is it a good beer? Oh, without a doubt. Is it worth that price? Nope. It's a tasty, clean, refreshing, surprisingly high ABV beer that I'd probably recommend anyone to try at least a bottle of though."

"this beer is so drinkable, authentic Belgian. really earthy and spicy, perfectly balanced and drinkable. its character is pretty ordinary, doesn't have any extra added bonus flavors like lime or hints of citrus, like I got from damnation its just perfectly balanced and earthy, natural"

"I first had a Duvel a few years ago because I heard it was considered one of the ""must try"" beers. I tried it and found it mediocre on all levels. I figured I must be missing something if many beer experts including Michael Jackson consider this one of their favorite beers. I like many Belgian Ales and thought maybe my palette just wasn't developed enough to appreciate the subtle nuisances of this beer. Three years and over a thousand beers later I now appreciate a wide spectrum of styles and my palette has definitely advanced. Duvel however hasn't changed for me. I find that the high carbonation deters from my enjoyment, the high alcohol content which I usually find as a plus takes away from the taste. The appearance and mouthfeel are nothing special. Sometimes I feel that some beers get rated high because of the ""buzz"" over it. For example, I was at Russian River six weeks ago and had a Pliny the Elder. Good IPA not great. I've had many IPAs that are better! Again, all about the hype!"

"Tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios, feels like heaven. Very sweet with undertones of cinnamon, a crispy and crackling body, incredibly easy to quaff. It only gets better with warming so there's no need to hurry but it's so hard to drink slowly when it's this good. The quintessential craft beer conundrum."

"330ml bottle. Duvel Oversized Tulip glass. Bright gold color, clear appearance. White, foamy & close crown, thick layer head & lasting lacing rings. Belgian yeast, pale malt, deep herbal, slight spiced & sugary aromas. Malty, crisp & hoppy upfront. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Dense texture. Hints of ripe fruit, honey & citric zest in the middle. Well integrated high ABV. Well balanced malts & hops slightly tend to a bitter finish. Fruity aftertaste."

"O - This is an excellent beer and easy to see why it is the standard for the style. While not something I usually go for, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I was worried from the first sniff that I wouldn't like this, I thought it would be too sweet and boozy for me, but it definitely is not. Very well balanced and smooth. This is a beer that is good because there is not that big punch of flavor, just a very well crafted and balanced beer. Well worth the try and the hype."

"O: As I've been delving deeper into the world of beer, Belgian Strong Pales have been dropping farther and farther down on my list of preferred styles so, admittedly, I've been slacking on Duvel. As I sit here typing this conclusion, sipping the last few ounces, I'm metaphorically slapping myself in the face for putting this brew off for so long. You know you have something special on your hands when you're utterly dumbfounded by how good a brew is, regardless of the fact that it's a style you're not fond of. Duvel is the top of the line. It is the be-all-end-all Belgian strong pale ale. It is the gold standard in which every BSPA aspires to be. If you're looking for the definitive, look no further. Duvel is here to satisfy."

Mouthfeel - medium-dry. Overall an outstanding beer that I would never turn down."

"Duvel is pretty close to my palate's perfect beer. Duvel is real juggernaut of Belgian pale ale....candi sugar and pilsner blend together boost up the alcohol % but thanks to two stage yeast additions, there comes across a clean very dry finish with glorious head retention. It's a devil of beer and a world class one too...."

"Pours a cloudy, golden color into a Duvel glass leaving a thick, bubbly, white long lasting head. Notes of pear, apple, yeast, biscuit. Lots of carbonation, bubbles throughout. Flavors of sour apple, pear, yeast, biscuit. Not too boozy in the mouth given the 8.5%ABV but notice it in the throat after a few minutes."

"Overall 4.0: Great beer, but I found it a bit off in several vital categories. Smell was far too subdued for the style and the taste was too bland and generic. I was hoping for something more ""Belgian""...i.e. a big hit of malt or hops or spicy yeast. Instead, I am left thinking that Duvel is the lager-drinker's Belgian ale. Not that this is bad. It's just that -to me-- Duvel is a bit ""dialed down"" for the international market. Again, just my opinion and this is not to say that I would not buy Duvel again, I would. Certainly recommended if you have not had it before."
"Had 2 bottles. A very thick, foamy head with sticky lacing. Very pale yellow in color. Aroma & taste are the same. Comes across as sweet yet malty wheat & alcohol. I find that the sweetness seems to dominate over the slight, light bitterness. Very crisp & light mouthfeel. Easy to drink."
"Been a while since I last drank this one, finally returned to it last night and very glad I did. Pours a light yellowish golden with a big off white head. Aroma offers some nice super balanced spiciness from the yeast, nice bright lemon rind, and some grassiness. Flavor follows suit. Mouthfeel was active and on the thinner side. Overall, a great beer. Not really a fan of too many golden ales, but am definitely a fan of this one. Such a well constructed beer."

"Pale golden colored with an inch of tightly woven Brussels lace at the top. Serious carbonation bubble action going on here. Smell is mineral like along with Saaz & Styrian Golding hops. Light Belgian candy sugar is also detectable within. The mouth is crisp,dry,and refreshing. This is like Belgian ale (candy sugar and Brussels lace) meets Czech Pilsner (hops and crispness)"

"Assuming I didn't get a bad batch or a bottle from a case left outside for a week in summer, I expected more. To the nose and tongue this beer lacked the Belgian flavors of other golden ales and tasted very much like a high gravity, slightly more flavorful corona. I seriously considered finding a lime. I might try again in the future, but for now I can't say I like it at all."

"Overall: a fantastic example of a Belgian Strong Ale - there is a reason that Duvel is regarded as one of the best. The well-rounded profile makes the higher price of AU$130 a case of 24 x 330mL bottles (2013) worth it once every now and then (or perhaps a 4-pack for us peasants)."

"Had a bottle decanted into a genuine Duvel goblet at 1410 Bier Haus in Calgary. This classic world-renowned brew pours a lemon-drop bright yellow with the oft-cited bright white head that forms a nigh-impenetrable cap that bottlenecks right at the rim of the glass and protrudes a bit over said rim without spilling. A majestic sight. Exudes an aroma of fruity yeast and very clean pale malt, some green apple and Saaz hop perfume. Palate is quite crisp and dry but with some residual sugars and a lot of fruit: Apples, pears, and a little banana perhaps, white sugar, candied ginger, citrus pith and white pepper spice against a backdrop of floral perfumed lemon cake. A large bloom of alcohol along with noticeable Saaz hops. Finish is bitter with a little cork. Clean, without noticeably funky flavors. Hard to argue that this isn't the perfect example of the style ... It is the original after all and the intent to to yield something clean and crisp: Perhaps less complex in terms of yeast-derived spicy ester profile than some similar beers."

"Pours bright golden with a thick white head. Carbonation is heavy with a lasting frothy head and champaign like bubbles tracing up the center. A nice sour tart crisp ale. Top notch beer. Lacing is rediculis down the glass. Pilsner malt is very up front and well placed. Dry finish. I would describe this beer as a slightly sour super pilsner. I am impressed. It's worth the 16 bucks a four pack price."

"One of, if the not the, standard bearer for this style. When you pour it, a truly beautiful bloom emerges. I always take a spoon (or a finger) and try some of the froth before drinking. The texture is buttery, slightly acidic and with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. While high in alcoholic content, the floral aromas and delicate flavors cloud the ABV.....so much that trouble can ensue if one is not careful. Slight notes of apple and stronger notes of orange emerge, especially if this classic is not served too cold. Where I live, Costco often has it in stock for only $10."
"Overall this is a great golden ale, it can be expensive and is usually cheaper to buy as a 4 pack ($14)of 11.2 floz each (1.3l Total) instead of in the 750ml - 3l bottles, which range from $12-$115. It is a beer you want to take your time to enjoy as it boasts a 8.5 abv. As well it has a very fine fruity flavor to it, the amout of foam that comes with this drink is something I didn't care for, but the taste made up for it. I would recommend that you drink this Belgian ale in the proper glassware, in other words use a chalice glass it will brining out the fruit like smell that Duvel has and add to the experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: About what one would expect of a good ""Belgian golden ale."" Quite drinkable with enough yeasty fruity zing to keep it interesting. I get the feeling I'm drinking it in the wrong season though, it would probably be a very fine summer refresher. But the amazing part of this beer is that 8.5% alcohol tastes more like 4. Someone who didn't know better might take it for a sessionable brew."

"This rating is for a good batch of Duvel. Note: for anyone saying it has a lemon taste to it, that is a BAD BATCH. It is NOT supposed to taste sour, AT ALL. If it hasn't gone bad, Duvel is the best beer in the world. PERIOD. But is not supposed to taste sour to the slightest degree. And this is a big problem with a lot of premium European beers sold in the US, at least in the flyover states."

I really like the malt in this brew, and the dark fruit isn't as noticeable in this one, which is good. I think the dark fruit in some Belgians can make the beer wine-like, which I do not care for. Overall, an excellent Belgian Strong that I look forward to sampling again."

"I was really excited to open this and try it... until I opened it to try it. First thing was the abundance of skunk smell. Luckily the appearance was nice and the flavor was nowhere near the smell. Not sure if it was suppose to smell like that but I am willing to try it again."

"Overall: Although somewhat light on the nose and a bit ""iffy"" in terms of appearance, the taste serves as a paradigm for beers. With yeast, malt, and hops together in perfect harmony, this beverage is what you use to silence a friend who demands to know what ""good beer"" is supposed to taste like."

"Overall: I have had Duvel god knows how many times and never gave this beer a proper review up until today. Borderline perfect, and usually a steady for me preferably in the summer because of it's citrus background. One of the best go to's you will ever have....grab a glass and enjoy. Salud!"

"The oft overlooked Duvel - really a fine beer. Glowing crystal-clear golden body, huge white foam and a lingering cloud. Another classic - sharp carbonation but a nice body for something that appears so light. Light bitterness, lemon rind, hoppy, peppery european hops. A nice one."

"Bottle pours to my Tremens tulip light clear gold with a big fluffy white head. Aroma of yeast funk, hay, hops, and light sugar. Flavor is sweet dry and effervescent hay and honey. Light mouthfeel and very easy drinking. While I like others like Piraat a bit better than this one, it is an excellent choice and could be enjoyed in any occasion or weather."

"Excellent beer in every way. Likely worthy of a straight five rating across the board (I like to think there is a white whale out there somewhere, though). This is what beer should be. Encompasses everything that makes us love beer (whatever its style)."
""
""
""
"Bought this in a box of 3 750ml bottles. Been eying it for a while and wanted to give it a try. Bottle conditioned and as this is the 3rd of the 3, all have been slightly different -this the most funky of the bunch. Pours dark gold, thick head fades fairly quickly. Aroma has a slightly stale moldy essence. There is a twang to it, like budweiser with corriander dryhopped. And that is exactly it -an upscale, and expensive bud that has gone bad. I dont mind a little skunk in a green bottle lager, but this was intentional and went horribly wrong. They tried to ""high end"" this and screwed up when it could have been a decent (and drinkable) mile golden ale. Like a homebrew experiment that failed. Never again."

"Fruits engage the palate and the sour makes the mouth water. The light grain malt sways and bends across the tongue for a feeling that is light and refreshing. The champagne bubbles tickle you and the dry finish is complimentary. There is a touch more alcohol than you might at first realize and that is ticklish too and makes you smile as it warms you. The pear comes out more and the grainy malt starts fluffy but then deepens slightly to remind you of a still life painting with fruit and bread and cheese. This is a work of art. Radiant and pleasing to the senses. Captivating."

"That stylistic moniker was appropriate for this, as this was quite strong and took a while to fully enjoy and savor. Because the carbonation was so persistent and easily discerned, this felt like a champagne squared by the time I finished it off. Although this isn't a type of beer that I prefer, there's no doubt that this is the standard by with all other beers of this style are measured up against. Dancing with the Devil may not be for everyone but all beer lovers out to give this a try to see if they're up for handling it , since this is one brew that deserves a try by all."

"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a very good example of the style, I've had more than of a few of this style and this beer seems to do the best job at showing what this style is really about and all the aspects of it seems to be balanced nicely. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, not filling, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, it would be nice to drink a few of these during the summer, but the price prevents me from doing so. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was and the appearance was also very good. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it's a very high quality beer, but I still don't think it's worth the price, that's the only downfall with this beer. I would buy this beer again, but it wouldn't be often because of it's price, this would have to be a once in a while beer. I recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales, it's a very good and true example of the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I had some higher expectations for this beer since it's highly regarded and it met my expectations nicely and I think this beer gets all the respect it deserves. It made for a good fist impression and I will be on the look out for some different Duvel beers, great job guys. So far there is no doubt that is my favorite Belgian Strong Pale Ale."

"O: I usually don't like beers with funky yeast but this beer kept it low. Decently tasty, coming from a person who usually doesn't like these kinds of beers."
""
""
""
"Aroma & Taste: Sharp smell and taste to it, acidic. Beer has an average length of finish and contains slight grapefruit and herbal notes. Also has a slight spice to it along with some bitter hops."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - dry, crisp and leaves the palate wishing for more"
""
""
"Duvel is a great Belgian Strong Pale Ale. The appearance is a yellow or goldenrod color. The smells contain both wheat and fruit notes. The body was very full bodied and bold. The taste is very refreshing and bold with strong wheat notes. This was my first Belgian Strong Pale Ale and I was very impressed with the style."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is light to medium. High carbonation. Easy to drink. Hides the strength very well."
""
"Overall, this is a ""dangerous"" 8.5% beer as the alcohol is hidden underneath a wonderfully crisp flavor that leaves you wanting just one more sip. One of my (many) go-to beers for warm summer months."

"Poured from a bottle to a large tulip glass at The Pantry on 4/16/13. The beer pours a glossy yellow-gold like very fine jewelry with an eruption of rocky white head. The head retains for most of the life of the glass of beer and leaves streaks of fine lacing all over the glass. The light penetration is pretty good, though there is a little haze from the pour. The nose on this beer is phenomenal and by far the highlight of the beer. There is hoards of bright fruit notes and esters that seem to jump out of the glass. At first you are hit with lots of ripe banana peel and candied sugar drops. There is a good spicy hop aroma that lingers along as well. As the beer warms a little and you give it a nice swirm, bright and fresh lemons come out as well. The malt is present too with a little soft bready smell as well. The 8.5% alcohol is nowhere on the nose. The taste is also quite good with fresh fruit, especially golden raisins, dates, and a touch of maybe some cherries as well. I tend to think of the cherry flavor in sour beers, but this is more of the sweet side of the cherry flavor. The hops are present, earthy and spicy, very much like a noble hopped beer. The mouthfeel was a little overly-dry, almost like something produced from a champagne yeast (though I have no clue if it is used in this brew), but otherwise has great body to it. The alcohol, at 8.5% is impressively well hidden. I never even got any sort of burn from it. Overall, this beer is fantastically well done. The only detriment I found was the dryness which I thought was a little over the top. Nonetheless, it was overall an exceptional beer."
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't what I expected after seeing the alcohol content on the bottle. I was expecting something more along the lines of Leffe. Has a citrus smell and is a refreshing pale yellow to amber colour. Taste reminds me of an English ale as there's a slight hoppy bitterness as well as banana notes. There's also a smoky deeper notes reminiscent of whiskey. Effervescent refreshing mouth feel, that makes for a surprisingly easy drink, goes down like a regular beer so be warned!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of the better beers I have tried. More complex than my limited palate can truly appreciate. The overall aroma, taste, and mouthfeel complement each other perfectly. Every sip seems to reveal something new."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer. The flavors are really good, the mouthfeel is very good, and I don't get even the slightest bit of alcohol in this beer. It's unbelievably well done. Might be one of the best Belgian Pale Ales that I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very large white foam head with long retention on a clear bright golden body. Aroma of Belgian yeast, coriander, herbal hops, lemon custard, musty malts. Flavors provide an excellent Belgian experience with nice yeast presence, very herbal hop flavors, tart citrus, some pine resin and a little more alcohol presence than I feel us typical of the style. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation with a dry finish. As stated above, the Belgian character is excellent with this one being very complex and yet still nicely drinkable. I am surprised I have gone this long without having tried this one."
""
""
"O - Tried and true classic. Can't get much better."
""
""
""
"Good yeast ester character with enough malt to support and not overwhelm. Finish is dry enough to keep me wanting more, but a little to bitter for my liking. Alcohol is a touch hot."
""
""
""
"O: A highly drinkable, well crafted beer. Superb example of the style. I think the balanced flavors and slight residual sweetness lets this pair exceptionally well with food."
""
""
""
"330ml bottle. 10 2016. Very pale straw colour, effervescent, towering white head which refused to go away and sensational lacing. Gentle fruity aroma of apples and pears, floral, yeast, and some alcohol. Light fruity sweetness and light to medium bitterness. Smooth, medium bodied and spritzy with a bitter, dryness in the finish. Slight alcohol warmth. Perilously drinkable at 8.5%abv. A classic. 10."
""
""
""
""
"O: First time I tried this beer was about 5-6 months ago and I wasn't really to impressed with it. I'm happy I went back and tried it again. I feel as though my palate has progressed because now I rather enjoy this beer. Personally it wasn't astounding for me but it was enjoyable and I would probably pick it up on occasion."

"O: I've had a lot of Duvels before this one and I do think they were better than this one. I'm afraid this Duvel didn't get very well with the cellar."
""
"I taste tested this with La Chouffe and I would say I prefer that one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied with medium-high levels of carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, but quickly becoming smooth and foamy. Closes quite dry, somewhat astringent, with little residual stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
"I can't say how many decades I've been tasting this brew, but it's many. The brew has changed over the years, and a corked bottle can be quite different from draft or small bottles (or the huge bottles). Generally respectable and gotta love the new marketing effort with designer glasses."
""
""
""
""
"The substantial head and odour immediately draw you in and the first taste, you will realize how much you have missed. I could not recommend a better brew than this impressive ale from this Belgium brewery."
""
"There's not much for me to say that hasn't been said. Duvel is a great beer and is worth checking out, even moreso since it's widely available. Best enjoyed with contemplating the deeper things of life, such as R.W. Emerson's essay, ""The American Scholar"" (my personal choice). Absolutely a great beer."
"Dynamite tasting beer. I am not good with words, so I would just recommend you buy some and try it yourself. Small bottle gives it a neat look but cuts by of 12 ounces by .8 but gets away with it in my book by it's great taste and nice alchol content. If more affordable I would drink it more frequently. Hope you enjoy some."

"O - On tap, the beer lives up to the hype. I find that in the bottle, the first impact is a bit too heavy; give the beer a bit of time to breathe before partaking. When possible, find on tap, the effect is much better. By far one of my top choices among the Belgian beers. I prefer on tap a bit on the chilled side. Once warmed, the sweet flavored really stand out to the point where it's almost overpowering - a bit strong for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance and aroma similar to what a lot of guys on here have already said, but I wasn't crazy about the taste. Had a more experienced beer drinking buddy over and he said it might have been exposed to too much light. I will definitely try this again in the future, but as of now, I'm not crazy about it."
""
"Overall - Really beautifully crafted beer. Wonderful flavor, combined with a fantastically drinkable smoothness makes this a joy to drink. My only drawback? The price. At $3.50 for an 11.2 oz bottle, it's nothing I'll be buying with much frequency."
""
""
""
""
"The review before this one said it tasted like a Heineken ... No!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm sorry, but this beer is so unbelievably overrated that it is ridiculous. IN MY OPINION, It tastes like a glorified Euro Pale Lager. I love how I'm seeing people review this beer noting it's flavors which compare quite well to adjuncts, Yet they are rating it so highly simply because they feel obligated and they are completely biased. i deliberated this beer with two friends, Both craft drinkers. One of them has been drinking craft only for over twenty years and they both completely agree that this beer does not live up to any of the hype. One of them actually called it "" Rancid Bud Light ""."
""
"Yes, dangerously light and drinkable, and exceptionally refined. This is a very well made strong Belgian ale, and a worthy canonical example."
""

"This is about as perfect a Belgian golden ale as you're going to (easily) get. Tons of flavor with a lot of complex notes. Crisp and refreshing. Love it."

"O- nice Belgian pale. Has huge lemon and spice characteristics."
""
""
"I had never tried this beer before and although it's not my usual hop-bomb type of brew, I decided to delve in with a 4 pack anyway. The first bottle I thought was just OK...By the last of the 4 pack I begrudgingly came to this realization...this is one of th finest easy drinking, alcohol hiding, delicious beers I have ever had. It will now be a staple in my fridge, and would most likely choose this beer over the many IPA's I drink on a regular basis. Advice...drink this bad boy nice and cold."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'll admit the Belgian pale ales are not near the top of my list of favorite styles, but this is a damn-near perfect example of the style. Extremely flavorful, quite complex, yet very clean. Similar to champagne in many ways (although I'd take Duvel over most any champagne in a heartbeat)."

"O - Overall this beer is on the dry side, but there's a little bit of sweetness to round it out. The belgian yeast combined with huge carbonation makes this an amazing beer."

"O- It's good. It's historical. It's my first one of it's kind. It will be one of those beers I have to go back to after trying more examples of the style. I wonder if the temperature was held correctly during conditioning or if the priming sugar was off because I did not expect it to be this spritzy. I have a hard time imagining I got a bad bottle of Duvel though."

"Pours a crystal clear golden straw with a huge bubbly white head that turns to meringue at the top. A constant flow of carbonation bubbles feed a head that persists forever and making pouring 12 oz into a pint glass impossible in one attempt. The aroma on this is quite unique. Apple cider and pears along with a bready yeasty aroma are quite inviting. Bits of pepper and spice round out the nose quite well. The flavor is crisp and just a hint of sugary sweet with a heavy does of apple and light fruits. Light hints of pepper and other yeast derived flavors balance this quite nicely. Light to medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet almost tart and bubbly mouthfeel. This is a unique and wonderful beer, how come I am just trying this now?"

"Overall - This is a terrific brew, met all of my expectations and shattered them. Disclaimer, I am a huge fan of golden-style ales in general so this taste may not line up with yours, but for me this is one of the best of this style I have ever had."

"Taste is simultaneously refreshing and complex. Straight up on the tongue is a crisp citrusy lemon note; incredibly balanced with some yeast notes. Plunge a little deeper and there's a delicious green apple note that is more than welcomed. Other citrusy notes combine perfectly with the yeast and create a miasma of flavor. Mouthfeel is slick, wet, and infinitely refreshing all the way through the finish. This reputation is well-deserved."

"Pours a gorgeous golden blonde with a huge white head that slowly recedes to a rocky cap. Good amount of fruity aroma. Very lively looking beer. Tastes are fruity for most part with a bitterness toward the end and a fairly hoppy finish from the saaz. Excellent mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation with a dry finish. Will definately try again. Very high quality stuff."

"Duvel is a great example of the style, and it's certainly the beer you want to start off with when introducing someone new to BSPAs. All around, it contains the flavors you expect from a Belgian ale, but handles them in a nearly perfect way. Don't pass this one up, you'll be sorry you did."
""
""
""
"One of the best beers in the world. Very drinkable, yet complex."
"Quite an impressive belgian. Crisp, balanced, and easily drinkable. This will always be a classic in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I have not always been a huge Duvel fan, but my last few experiences have won me over. I could drink this with food or by itself. The flavors are full-bodied and completely without gimmickry or trickery. This is a great example of a beer that doesn't need any barrel-aging or in-your-face hops to get the job done."
""
""
""
"O- THE example of this style. Looks, smells, tastes, feels great. On top of that, there is no sign of that 8.5% abv what so ever. If your curious about this style, this is a MUST."
""
""
"O: No way does this beer even seem like 8.5% ABV. This drinks and tastes like a 4% summer beer. Wow.... menacingly good!! I've now been tempted by the devil and I want some more!!! I've had a lot of American made Golden Strong Ales and this one easily sets the standard."
"Slightly carbanated and tingles as I sip"
"Absolutely one of the best beers in the world without question."

"O - Like I said, my go to blonde. Having visited Belgium 5 times I just cannot seem to find a better replacement."
""
""

"This is pretty much the landmark example of the style. Smooth and crisp with a punch of flavor. Nothing overly complex. Simple and restrained."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Oh so drinkable. One of my favorite Belgians. I've been drinking it for years and still get that 'Yup, this beer is still that good' feeling whenever I have it. The warmer the better too as with most Belgians."
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer worthy of a try... Fantasic mix over everything you would ever want in a beer... A must try."

"O-a classic Belgian golden ale with great flavor, a beer you can always enjoy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Duvel is a pure Belgian classic. It's worth seeking out many times over. It's an incredibly well crafted ale from one of the most technological breweries on the planet. Read up on the methods and complexity it takes to brew this ale and you'll want to show your appreciation with buying a bottle. I promise you wont regret busting the top off one of these only to pour into some sort of crazy Belgian style brew glass of your choice."

"Shalom, J"
"I really enjoyed this beer. This is only the second Belgian Strong Pale Ale ive tried and I can't imagine anything better."
""
""
""
"Really nice stuff, highly refreshing. Drinks insanely well for the ABV, and carries a nice complexity and flavour profile. Highly crisp and big on flavour, mostly dry malt and tart fruit. Recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O â This is one of my favorite beers of all time. Itâs just so so drinkable, I donât even want to put it down. It only gets better as it warms. Itâs a mistake to drink this too cold too. I love this BSPA, itâs the best Iâve ever had."
""
""
""
""
"overall: not super impressed, usually a fan of belgians, this is a bit less complex than i wanted, strong alcohol/metal taste without much hop or malt character"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"it poured a beautiful gold color the aromas are incredible the taste is even better even though they recommend the duvel glass i've found that a chalice works better at least for me the taste of the beer matches the aroma very hoppy and a big spicy yeast flavor a very well balanced beer it's worth the hype"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straw yellow pour, clear and pale, a finger or two of foamy white head that recedes to a thin layer of bubbles; decent lacing. Pale malts in the nose, fruit esters, yeast, leafy hops. Similar taste, brready malts, Belgian yeast, apples, pears, light citrus twinge, grassy, leafy, bitter and can lean towards metallic. Medium body, medium carbonation, somewhat drying, and a boozy kick. Pretty standard fare here, often seen served in awkwardly large signature glasses with terrible artwork."
"However, as far as presentation, absolutely crystal clear and beautiful head that would make anyone cry. It had a crisp and clean initial taste and is truly beautiful, which is why it still rated a 4.5 in my book."
""
""
""
""
"O: The best beer I've ever had hands down, an amazing mixture of complexity and sweetness contrasted against super carbonation leaves with a super crisp and fulfilling feel. If there's a beer you should try, it would be this one, It's extraordinary, it's the best beer I've ever had."

"Overall - for the cost I have had many Ales that would blow the doors off Duvel. For 15.00/4 pack I'm expecting much more."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with thick, rocky, everlasting white foam and lots of gorgeous Belgian lace. Aromas of husky whole grains, noble hops, black pepper, banana, very faint clove, bubble-gum, compost. Crisp and refreshing pils bill with notes of crackers, french bread, mildly tart and citrusy hops balance, lots more Belgian yeast notes here again including black licorice. Light body, high carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, well-concealed alcohol, lasting bittersweet aftertaste. One of the worldâs most balanced beers. Eminently delicious. Near perfect."
"AH the infamous Duvel. Sad to say, I think this beer doesn't live up to its hype. It has wonderful pale straw color and an amazing belgian yeast aroma. However in the taste department I found this to be rather lacking. For me its was almost entirely yeast with very little malt. I would have enjoyed a more complex flavor. The feel was very smooth and 8.5% alcohol wasn't noticeable at all."

""
""
""
""
"Yes, Duvel lives up to its fine reputation â a top shelf Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"O- This beer is just awesome, and extremely drinkable."
"Some of the darker belgians were a little less my style but still enjoyable"
""
"Overall golden pale ale that is trying to be somewhat complex but still maintains the style in a straight forward manner."
""
"Overall while this is a classic example of the style, it is also a forgettable one. A bit too yeasty and one-dimentional that really doesn't invite you to consume more. The hop and alcohol add a slightly biting finish. Maybe just not my cup of tea."
""
""
"Overall - A very delicious and drier but quite flavorful Belgian.  Renowned for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Admittedly, Duvel was good but it did not sit as well with my palate than clearly it has with the majority of other drinkers. It was fine, but perhaps a good number of the complexities were lost on my palate leaving me disappointed overall."
""
""
""
"O: It beer. It good. Probably my oldest love and the first beer I actually remember liking. I don't always drink fancy barrel-aged stuff, and when I don't, just give me a few of these and I'm a very happy camper. Burp."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Amazing belgian beer, highly recommended."
""
"Overall - Really really satisfying - this is what beer is meant to taste like. Blows most out of the water. Tastes like how I imagine beer tasting in the medieval era."
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite beers; I've been known to down entire 750 mL bottles of the stuff before I even realize it's gone. Clean enough to be accessible to even those who don't necessarily prefer the Belgian style of brewing, but also so quintessentially ""Belgian"". You can taste the flavors from the unique yeast strain that make Duvel it's own beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: After letting my third bottle decant before serving, I can now say it is as good as I initially expected, and as such, will bump up scores accordingly. It features this amazing citrusy note (both in the aroma and flavor) that's damn near orgasmic, and it feels even lighter and more refreshing on the palate."

"What can I say? This is Duvel, the epitome of Belgian pale beers. It's complex, it's thirst quenching, it's spicy and exotic. I could drink this all day, whether it's summer or winter. It's a great beer I will be going back to for years to come."

"Pours a straw colored pale yellow with a pillowy two and a half finger bright white head. Adundant lacing as the head recedes. The aroma of Belgian yeast, alcohol, and a touch of ripe fruit. Opens with yeast, grassy hops, and a pleasant accent of alcohol, a touch of juicy ripe fruit midpalate, and a crisp, clean finish. Adundant effervescent carbonation, however still smooth with just the right touch of creaminess. This brew is the standard for Belgian strong pale ales. A triumph."

"i had rated this lower previously, but for some reason (maybe because i just drank a KWAK?)this just tastes so superior. from the color to the lacing to the taste, this product just seems so satisfying. great color of straw yellow, nice balanced taste, great taste with a strong ABV (pure happiness). definitely an easy one to drink through the night."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Exceptional beer. Astounding complexity and a big drink in itself. Most people would say something like ""I don't get back to this one often enough."" I would agree with that."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a gorgeous cloudy yellow with a three finger fluffy white head that kept expanding for minutes after the pour. Truly a gorgeous beer. Scents of barnyard funk, sour notes, lemon zest, cirtus, and very slight bit of banana. A complex nose, predicting the flavor to come, and being quite appealing on it's own. Taste is complex, with flavors of pilnser malt, citrus, fruitiness, graininess, moderate hop bitterness, spiciness and a bit of malt sweetness. The finish is dry as is the aftertaste. There is also a flavor in the after taste that reminds me of burnt marshmallows. There is a lot going on in the flavor, it's quite complex and combines in an excellent way. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A good, easy to drink and refreshing mouthfeel, hiding the ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent beer. It has a complex nose and flavor, it looks fantastic, it has a wonderful, fluffy head and an excellent mouthfeel. I enjoy it now far more than I did a year ago when I first tried it. Duvel is truly a world class beer and well worth drinking."

""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a pale cloudy golden amber. One finger white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast and spice, wheat and light citrus fruits. Light fruit and Belgian spicing up front, transitioning to light malt and citrus and finishing with a mild spice bitterness. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice Belgian."
""
""
"Overall: A good beer and a nice rite of passage I feel like I needed. I think Victory and some other American brewers have emulated it just as well though."
""
""
"For a beer with a high ABV, this is very mellow and easy to drink. The price is the only thing holding me back from giving a higher overall score. I really enjoyed this beers taste. Much better flavor than most BSPA's."

""
""
"O-A nice beer, can't say I get why people are in love with it though."
""
""
""
""
"O: Man, this just didn't do it for me. The malt aroma just reminds me of cheap beer and I just couldn't get over it. It did get a little better as it warmed up some (or as I got used to it) but didn't meet my expectations. But I'll try it again and see if I have a different experience."

"Goes down nice and smooth. Although a bit pricey, it is a great brew for just about any occasion."
"Overall - exceptional. This was my first Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I was skeptical at first b/c I have high regard for Belgian Strong Darks. In fact, this one outperforms most darks in both complexity and taste."

"Classy beer to drink one off or have a night on, works well with either situation. Packs a punch at a sneaky 8.5%!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Duvel is considered a classic for a reason. It has a wonderfully balanced sweet-bitter flavor profile that is boosted by the excellent mouthfeel and never reveals the high alcohol content. Here is a Belgian beer that is more accessible than most, but its accessibility does not make it any less of a class act. Excellent."
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color with a mountainous, craggy white head. The aroma smells mildly of apple, pear, and trace amounts of hops. The massive head tempers only slightly as you drink, maintaining itself like a champ. The first thing I notice upon tasting is the intense carbonation, whose prickliness near singes the tongue (though not in a bad way). The flavor is sweet and juicy up front, similar to the aroma, while some bitterness presents on the back end. There is an almost honey-like sweetness that melds with the apple and pear notes. A strong sense of apple peel becomes increasingly evident as it warms, and a slight spiciness begins to manifest in the finish. Hops are tastefully integrated, just enough to lend some balance and complexity. As the session continues, alcohol becomes more present in the aroma, though not so much on the palate, which is impressive for the ABV. Swaths of lacing cling to the glass as the beer recedes. This is a crisp and refreshing brew indeed, and not short on flavor. Hard to find fault here in any regard, and pretty much the grandest head you'll find in a beer. A real winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow with some haze and a huge frothy white head. Big inviting smell, the yeast is dominating, but smells great. Some peppery clove smells come through with some subtle fruit notes.. The taste is dominated by the yeast no one unique flavor come out of the yeast, but some spice and malt in there as well. This is a medium bodied beer, which adds to the beer, nice blend of all elements. This is the best aspect, every flavor seems to be in just the right proportion to every other flavor. Overall a good beer, nothing overpowering, can't really tell its a higher ABV. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability â This is a highly drinkable beer. It goes down very easy for 8.5% abv, although the spice could be better."

"What a damn fine beer."

"Note to self: Similar to but drier than Piraat, and so the hop bitterness more pronounced. The balance you like so much in Piraat is skewed towards the hops, which you don't like so much. (Can you tell I'm just trying to fill more space here? Just need five more words. There.))"

"O: Great beer. I see why this is a classic that has been around so long. One of the torch bearers that got us through the Dark Ages before the craft brewing boom."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The ratings for this beer do not lie. This is simply a world-class offering that everyone needs to try. Despite its long shelf life, I would recommend acquiring it as fresh as possible (according to the website, it has a 36 month shelf life). Furthermore, follow the instructions on pouring a Duvel and that will guarantee you an even more enjoyable experience."
"Best by 05 2015. $4.50 a small bottle."
"O- Very decent, like I expected. While it IS good, there isn't really much I would say that is memorable about this beer. It is a very delicious straight forward Belgian ale. Because of the price I probably wont buy this again, but other than that this is an overall good beer. Very classic."
""

"Overall, a true classic. Not sure why it took me so long to review this one, but I am a big fan."
""
""

"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy yellow with an abundant white head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head retains fairly well, leaving less than a finger of head atop the beer and plenty of lacing on the glass. There's a strong aroma of fruity yeast, spices, and light malts. The flavor is very bold, but it does follow the smell. The yeast and malt flavors come together very well with the spiciness and the hops. There is some apple flavor as well. It's a very pleasing flavor and the sweet and bitter flavors balance extremely well. The alcohol is covered very well by all the flavors. The body is light and the carbonation is abundant. The finish is crisp and dry. This is very easy to drink for a beer that is 8.5% ABV. Overall, this is an excellent beer that every one exploring beer should consume at least once."
""
""
""
"o. I would recommend this beer if you don't like strong beer. Very crisp taste. Just careful dont drink too many."
""
""
"The taste is far different than the smell. You first get some of the yeast, perhaps a nice slight bitterness from the hops and alcohol, and a nice tart sparkling wine-like tartness on the way down. I'm tasting some really nice bready notes coming back after the finish."
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable and easy to drink beer. A little strong to be sessionable but definitely a beer that you want to have many times. The presence of the alcohol is well hidden but this is a strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Yum!! This is one of the best tasting beers that I have had. Each swallow made me look forward to the next. I definitely what some more of this."
""

"Pour and enjoy this elixir of the gods."
""
""
"O: Excellent Belgian strong ale. Had it a couple of times and it never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
"In my opinion this is one of the best beers on earth. One of the first beers I discovered as I began to appreciate beer and over 2 years and many, many glasses of Duvel later it is still one of the greatest beers I've ever had. Sex in a bottle for sure."

"""All '5's' should be rare."" It is my opinion that this beer deserves all 5's. Taste is ABSOLUTELY subjective. Mine tells me that this one is 5's all the way around. I buy one for people who haven't had tried it any chance that I get. I love it to no end; haven't had one in months, yet think about it almost every day. I am glad to have been introduced to this beer. I drink a lot of alcohol. But this is magic in a bottle."
""
""
""
"I'm afraid this beer may have been hyped up a bit. Granted I'm a little biased - being American and all, but this one has certainly been influenced by some European marketing tactics. Let's face it - most American pale ales would blow this one away. For example - Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale, or even anything from SN... and this one is even considered a 'strong'."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Extremely drinkable and subtly complex. It's a style onto itself and a great style at that."
""
"Poured from 330ml bottle to snifter: The beer pours a perfect gold with a swelling, soft white head that fills the snifter, and then recedes gradually to a healthy dollop. Constant, needlepoint beading that doesnât let up. The beer smells just wonderfully bright and clean, fresh. All kinds of inviting esters and clove. Some light pepper and fruit, crisp sweet grain. The taste is equally impressive. Just the right touch of spice to complement everything found in the nose. The Belgian yeast really comes to the forefront - the pinnacle of the beer I think. Itâs perfectly carbonated with a nice dry, slightly spicy finish. This beer is, overall, nearly without flaw."

"This beer is excellent. It's interesting, flavorful, and refreshing"
"Overall: Simply a world class brew. This beer gets a lot of praise, but it is certainly deserving of such accolades. This is for sure in my top 5 beers. Almost the perfect brew IMO."
"O - A classic Belgian Pale Ale, very easy to drink and full of complexity. A must in the Belgian landscape and on the shelves of any beer enthusiast!"
"Appeared a bright, transparent gold with about 3 fingers of fluffy white head. Smelled of light citrus, apple and malt with a sweet undertone. Taste was spot-on for a Belgian Pale Ale. Very crisp, clean flavors with hints of apple, pear and light citrus. Great mouthfeel as it left you with a refreshing taste. Overall, a great beer that I will certainly have again. This one sets the standard for this style. Plus, it paired very well with all of the meat I was being served at the Brazilian Steak House."
""
"Poured into the signature Duvel glass. Apparently I did not get the perfect pour but I was pretty close to the ""recommended"" pour. Anyhow, poured the trademark big head which was soapy and fizzly. Honey colored body with some yeast present as I did decide to pour the settlement in. I feel as the beer is not complete without it! Smells of strong character malts followed by a wave of corn, banana, biscuit and sweet cane sugar. Tastes of banana, yeast, a biscuit with a slight hop finish. The mouthfeel was almost like drinking a soda. Fizzling sensation throughout the whole drink but somehow it works out. Very well balanced belgian ale.. i want more!!"

"O - My Second Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Very nice yeast characteristics. Not hop forward like APA, really its own beast. Well enjoyed"
""

"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a tulip. Light, hazy straw color with a 2 finger foamy head with nice lacing. Head stayed around for most of the session. Citrus aroma. Nice strong ale mouthfeel. Fruity taste with bread & yeast characteristics. Also peppery notes in the aftertaste. Overall excellent beer. Lives up to its reputation."

"D - Overall, an excellent beer. It's easy to see why this one is an absolute classic and a must-try for any beer-lover. While the flavor profile is fairly big and complex, it's also balanced and extremely easy to drink, and the drinkability on this one is through the roof. A great Belgian and a fantastic beer overall."
""
"My preference to this is Hennepin,which is outstanding!"
"O: Such a delicious beer. Itâs most devilish quality is that even though the alcoholic warmth lets you know youâre dealing with something powerful, the taste makes you dive headfirst into the deal anyway. A classic."
"Overall = unique to say the least. I liked it, definitely refreshing. Something to drink on a ""Wine"" occasion."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip, best by 12/24/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, pear, bready grain, grass, pepper, coriander, and yeast spices. Nice and clean aromas with good strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, biscuit, light tart grains, pepper, grass, coriander, herb, clove, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; with some lingering notes of light fruit, pepper, bready grains, and yeast spices for a bit. Great flavor balance, with a good amount of complexity. Medium body with high carbonation; and extremely smooth drinking for the level of alcohol with the prickly carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden, which is surprising for 8.5%. Overall this is just a fantastic Belgian strong pale. Great balance, complexity, and smooth drinking; and also has the best glass in the beer world."
"Overall - It's a classic for a reason. This is a great Belgian pale that sets the standards for the others."

"O - This is the type of beer to grab when you need something crisp, refreshing, and uplifting. It's very easy to drink and though a slight taste of alcohol is present, the appearance and mouthfeel help disguise the 8.5% ABV. I'm sure I'll have this beer again, but I am really looking forward to trying it on a scorching hot Summer day."
"EDIT: The 750ml corked version is fresher and more alive. The foam is chewier and the lemons and apples seem to have been replaced with pungent fresh cut grass and earth. If this beer was hard to find I bet it would be more sort after than Westy Xll."

"Duvel is my go-to beer whenever I can find it in a store. A reasonable price for an amazing brew. As I cruise up and down the aisles, i'm always telling myself, ""I can always get Duvel..."" I'm a sucker for Belgian strong pale ales, and this is the one that turned me onto them. The head on this beer is thick enough to support a dime. Sometimes, I get a bit of a sour scent that comes off of it, but other than that, this beer is damn near flawless. Amazing floral mix in the taste that incorporates lots of hops with a mix of fruit such as citrusy gold. Pour this into a tulip glass if you have one, but even a pilsner will do... anything that will lead the head expand and release all of its magic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Duvel is a beautiful beer. It never gets old, is about the most approachable thing out there but is still so well done that anybody can appreciate it. I might prefer the style to be funky with more fruity esters and a wheat edge in there, but Duvel really is a benchmark in BSPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
"I bought this beer liking the way it looked on the shelf. It pours into a glass very nicely with a good bit of head. The aroma is a fruity taste with a kind of bitter finish. Overall it was a good beer but way over my price range for the taste even tho it has a fancy looking bottle."

"It hides the 8.5 AVB well and to me is actually a beer I would enjoy on a Summer day. This is one to keep stocked."
"This is one of those memorable beers. Once you have had a Duvel you will remember it."

""

"I typically don't dig much on many Belgians and yeasty beers piss me off. This happened to avoid pissing me off, though the headache that often results from these beers is creeping in."

""
""
"O-Not an everyday ale for me, but a great brew."
"Picked up a 4-pack with a glass gift set. I cleaned the glass and poured from one of the bottles (the freshness date was indiscernible to due lack of ink and rubbing) to the Duvel tulip. The beer pours a huge 3 finger white head with excellent retention and lacing. The head slowly fades. Beer is a perfectly clear and bright straw color. Excellent appearance. The aroma is that of a crisp fruity character: pear, mild banana, apple. Hints of spicy hops. Very nice. The flavor is even more impressive with such complex character and ultimate balance. Again light fruity character as found in the nose with pairs perfectly with a tart bready flavor. Mild bitterness works very well with the citrus tart. Full bodied and crisp and clean. Overall, a supreme beer, instantly one of my favorites. Highly recommended."

"I tried this in a class about fungi and i rather enjoyed it. There was a large white head that stuck to the edge of the cup as I drank. It was a murky, golden beer which had smells that were fruity and even a bit spicy. It was dry and had a light mouth feel as well."
""
""
"An awesome beer for 1,89 â¬ here, quite worth it."
""
""

"It's heavier than it looks, yet so easy to drink. The carbonation is sharp enough that you've gotta sip it though. Solid beer, as it's sterling reputation suggests."

"O: This beer is juicy. Like biting into a malt, hop stuffed granny smith apple, flavor abounds. The legend of Duvel has existed before me and will continue when I'm gone."

"O: Certainly one of the best and easiest to procure BSPAs. Personally I like the Ommegang offerings (Gnomegang, BPA) and Russian River's Damnation just a little better. This is a solid top 3ish though."

"(first beer review) first things first, i see all the love settled on the bottom of the bottle. so i had to re introduce all that lava lamp goodness back to this one.. good color resembles a cloudy golden color. thick cloud like head, as it cleared it left some real cool lacing, took some time to settle. tons of champaine bubbles. good malty fruit aroma, slighty yeasty kick with some tartness at first sip. good carbonation, smooth slick an tasty finish. a great belgian gold. i can see this stocked in my fridge on a regualr basis, not overly complex or intimidating. reviewed on my mobile too. great beer overall, great beer for the craft beer curious"

"O: Not every bottle is consistent in my experience. This is such a familiar and special beer, but occasionally I'll open a bottle that seems a bit off. The hops are skunked, or maybe its gone stale or corked."

"We had our neighborhood world beer tasting soiree last night and we tried the Duvel Belgian Golden Ale. The beer poured a straw yellow with a large foamy white head that laces. The smell includes alcohol, cracker, light grass. The taste carries belgium malt and lemon grass zing power the taste. The mouthfeel is big bodied with massive carbonation. The alcohol content make this a tough beer."

"Although a bit pricey, it's relatively easy to find (which is a big plus). On this particular occasion, I had a glass of Duvel, followed by Damnation by Russian River Brewery and I thought Duvel was better! (although Damnation was pretty damn good too)."
""
""
"I've been meaning to buy this one for a while, but the only thing that discouraged me was the price. I snagged a 4 pack on sale (and with a really cool Duvel oversized tulip) for $12.99. I am going to thoroughly enjoy drinking the other three!"

"O: I enjoy this a lot, it has a very clean inoffensive flavor that will appeal to even the biggest beer hater. Picking this up for $15, which includes 4 330 ml Duvel's and a Duvel tulip glass, makes this a 5 overall, hard to beat that bargain."

"This appears a light clear golden-yellow with a tremendous amount of billowy foam. Estery aroma, very floral with some clove, some coriander, a sprinkle of banana (I realize this is starting to sound like a hefe description!) with an underlying sweetness to it. Tastes full of yeasty, estery flavor. Springtime fruits and flowers in bloom, a light clove dusting, some crushed coriander Lightly bodied and effervescent. The 8.5% is apparent especially on the finish. Iâd love to see how this develops over a few years."
""

"O- I always order this beer if I see it on the menu. It never disappoints. I also would like to try to brew a clone of it one day."
""
""
"O-Wonderfully refreshing beer."
"famous for a reason, this classic golden belgian brew is exceptional. pours clear golden with a massive white foam head, delicate and beautiful. awesome aromatics happening here, smells of yeast and spice, with slight citrus notes. flavor is big and bold for a yellow beer, and to me the quintessential belgian golden ale. mouthfeel is great, very carbonated and almost sharp for that reason, but rounded off my a lighter body and a complex finish. could drink this all day and night. fantastic"

"Overall: Been wanting to try one of these for a while now. What a perfect time for Thanksgiving. Now I see why Duvel is the benchmark for Belgian Strong Pale Ales. Simply excellent. Who needs champagne when you've got this?"
""
""
"The benchmark of the style for all Belgian Golden Strong, this beer doesn't miss a beat. It's exemplary in all categories, and just generally kicks ass. Always a treat, and one I don't enjoy often enough."
""
"O - I can see why this beer is so popular, but it's hard to justify $17 for a 4-pack for anything other than special occasions. That being said, I know I will buy this beer again because it is just plain great, and if High Life hadn't bastardized the concept, I would declare it's the beer equivalent to champagne."
"O: Not what i was expecting from a Belgian (expecting a quad). Overall, pretty good, i was pleasantly surprised the more i drank. Although the thing i found odd was the more I let it sit, the better it tasted. Not sure if they're all like this or just the batch i got. Either way, worth trying if you haven't. I'd buy again when the mood strikes."
""
""
"Has a crisp apple smell almost like a cider. Nicely carbonated and pours a big frothy head. Golden yellow colour with lots of bubbles. It tastes a bit like champagne. Tangy. Actually a lot like white wine.. without so much of the sweetness. The 8.5% ABV has no where to hide, it's right up front. I would use this beer as a wine substitute in seafood recipes."

""

""
"Overall I really like this. I've never actually had it before this tasting, but I know it's the gold standard for Belgian Strong Pales. Not cheap and I cant say I will be getting this regularly. I am intrigued to see what a year or two in the cellar would do for this brew. Recommended to any BA looking to dip their toes in the Belgian style of brewing. Cheers!"

"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Dries out nicely with some age."
"O - I was expecting one of the best beers I've ever had, Duvel delivered. Just short of outstanding... Highly recommended even at $4/330ml."
"Poured into huge Duvel tulip glass. Pours a straw yellow, with 4 inches of fluffy, white head that lingers the entire beer. Lacing every where. Smell is clove, banana, q breadyness, and a hint of spicy hops. Taste is all that, more powerful then the smell, clove dominates, but in a pleasant way. Body is nice, not thin or thick, easy drinking for abv. I think it is a good amount of carbonation for the style. I am not a huge fan of Belgians, but this is very pleasant. I am coming around to the style, still a work in progress."
"Rather sharp and austere like a Belgian Pilsener. On tap at Cueva on Adams Avenue in San Diego."
"Wow. At El Corte Ingles for 1.70 euros; given that they hawk Spanish lager for .50 a can, why would you ever choose differently?"
"330ml into a Duvel tulip...it's hard to call this anything other than the perfect beer. You don't even realize it has alcohol in it. The head is massive on top of a clean golden body. I take care to pour it to the point where Duvel recommends, so that there is an even divide between head and body at the Duvel logo. Lacing is excellent. Deep clean funk in the nose. Balanced like a tightrope walker. Tastes soo clean. It's not the beer with the most depth ever, but I have to give it a 5 for sheer excellence. Mouthfeel is unreal. So much energy. Perfect. It only gets a 4.5 overall because it's quite expensive in these parts--a 4 pack for $16. However, if you haven't had Duvel, you should immediately try it. Regardless of the quantity this beer is produced in, you can see that the brewers keep quality at the top of their priorities."
"this is just amazing. if your barely starting your journey into the great beers of belgium this is a great start."
"Final Grade: 4.57, an A+."
"Simply constructed, yet so complex in execution. Drinkable with a capital D. The gold standard of Belgian Strong Pales."
"Overall: Excellent. Loved this Belgian. Will definitely return for more."
"O: classic, a bit two dimensional, but one of the best in this category."
"This beer tastes great. I could describe it, but you should have already had a bottle. This beer is affordable and high quality. You can get it almost anywhere. So, what's your excuse for not having tried it?"
"O - A very nice beer easy drinking beer that can be enjoyed any place at any time."
"Overall a really really good beer. I'm definitely going to explore some more beers from this style and will pick this one up again for sure."
"O: Another Belgian worthy of it's reputation."
"O- I like it, but I can think of others in the style I like more. This one is a devil though... The alcohol sneaks up on you even when you know you should be looking out for it."
"Overall: Excellent. A great job at putting complexity into something that looks like a BMC product. A classic."
"Aroma is the quintessential Belgian yeast, with malted grains and spices. Flavour is well balanced from start to finish. For me the Belgian yeast dominates, but there's a lot going on between the initial malt & bready sweetness to the pleasantly dry & crisp finish. Alcohol warmth is present, but 8.5% ABV is surprisingly subtle."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle (with ""best by"" dating) into a pint glass. I thought I was being careful but the pour must have been too fast as it foamed into a head at least half the glass. The head was very light and fluffy as was the lacing. The color was very pale blonde. The nose lent notes of malt and bready goodness with a hint of pepper and clove. The taste was complex with clove, grass, pepper, and resin. There was a trace of alcohol, but nothing way out front that grabs. Mouthfeel was light-bodied with greater than average carbonation. A brew that lives up to its reputation...well worth the time to find it and price to buy it."
"This seems to be the epitome of the style, but all in all - nothing spectacular for me (personal taste). Easily downed the 25oz bottle & hides the alcohol really well. Picked up at Total Wine & More for $8.99, might do again someday."
"O- There are a handful of beers that I consider true benchmarks of their style, and Duvel is one of them. It manages to toe the fine line between pleasing discerning beer geeks, and being so easily approachable for those without a big beer background."
"This beer is beautiful, through and through. Bright golden with a rich head - an impressive example of head retention. Natural, spritzy carbonation forms at the nucleation point in the base of the glass. The aroma offers subtle earth tones, light fruit, and a hint of spice. A medium, but surprisingly quaffable mouthfeel for the ABV is both inviting and alluring. A dry finish leaves you thirsty for more."
"Slightly hazy pale golden colour, 2 fingers sticky white head, fluffy lots of lacing left on the glass. Smell is yeasty with notes of grass, lemon citrus, green apple, sweet candy like notes, moderately hoppy, good malty backbone with faint alcohol notes. Taste is yeasty with notes of lemon rind, green apple, lightly sweet, grassy hop, mild to moderate bitterness, minimal alcohol in finish, malt is there as well. Aggressive prickly carbonation, med to full body, solid weight. Without a doubt one of my favourites, easy drinking and full of flavour, complex without going over the top, well balanced and enjoyable."
"Overall: I get this one only a couple of times a year, otherwise I'd feel like I'm spoiling myself. Tried with Wisconsin Blue Cheese, pair is excellent."
"O - An outstanding beer. If it weren't so expensive, this would be all that I drink. Very nice look, flavor, and refreshing qualities give this one an A."
"Notes: a special beer, uniquely Belgian. Beautiful to look at, complex, medicinal, simultaneously dry and sweet. Amazing."
"O: this is a classic drink - limitless in its pairings, BTW - I honestly consider this beer to be the a top 5 Belgian strong pale ale. Duvel is my standard by which other Belgian strong pale ales are measured. Any BA is best served by having a Duvel at some point."
"A model (progenitor?) of the style, and a delicious beer at that. I'll never grow tired of Duvel."
"Overall, this is a beer that is a pleasure to just drink, and also a pleasure to analyze. Its perfectly balanced and unique. Worth the buy if you see it, especially as its almost always available unless I'm mistaken. Great beer."
"Overall (4): A fantastic looking beer, lacing on the tulip looks top-notch the whole way through. The clean, dry, crisp taste coupled with the carbonated mouthfeel and the warming of the alcohol combines for a beautifully crated Belgian Pale. The bottle fermentation is reflected in the smell which carries into the taste undertones. Well rounded."
"Overall: I have had this exceptional beer plenty of times beer and will defintiely have more in the future. You can't go wrong with drinking one of these. Truly, a nice world class beer."
"M - Thin body. Dry, with prominent carbonation. Very clean finish with almost no residual stickiness. Leaves a subtle warmth in the chest as well."
"D - A very good Belgian beer, very easy to drink considering the higher ABV."
"M: Refreshing, crisp, slightly tart, lots of fine bubbles"
"Not my first Duvel, but my first review. This is a magnificent beer. A fine way to pass some time at Amsterdam Schiphol."
"D - A very good Belgian beer made on an impressively large scale. While there are other takes on the style that I prefer I would happily have this without complaint. Very easy to drink considering the higher ABV - guess the name is appropriate."
"O: I don't see why this gets rave reviews. I've had much more flavorful strong pales and pilsners. Oh well, it's not bad, but it's not good either."
"The mouthfeel was great, a clean, crisp, refreshing beer that was easy to drink and enjoy."
"Overall: Pretty good. Not exceptional. A function of mass-production?"
"A lot of carbonation, a little to much maybe. A bitter character, some buttery yeast flavor, the 8,5 abv is hidden very well, but still warms your belly."
"Overall: An outstanding beer that truly takes a full bottle to meet, as new flavors and aromas emerge throughout the drink."
"The lively carbonation and balanced flavor profile make this beer extremely drinkable in spite of its 8.5% ABV--perhaps dangerously so! An excellent beer for those times when you're in the mood for something light in body and mouthfeel with good carbonation, but also full in flavor. This seems like a great beer for pairing with a meal."
"Overall: Very unique belgian beer, can't really say I've had something quite like this before. The Duvel brewery did a good job brewing a beer which has so many different flavors which compliments each other, somewhat like a flavor bouncing effect."
"M - Fairly carbonated"
"Great yeast strain! The sour and acidic qualities really make this beer stand out. It's complex but focused."
"I'm not 100%, but I think this tasted different when I had it in Ireland. Not sure if shipment has to do with a slight difference (it shouldn't with 8.5% ABV). I didn't taste the banana with this glass. Maybe my palate has grown. Still really good, but not up to the standards my palate had previously regarded it."
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is deceivingly drinkable. The body is light, crisp, refreshing, and easily swallowed. The carbonation is extremely fizzy but does not seem to adversely effect the taste at all."
"D: This is another Belgian mainstay I'd never had before. It's also an excellent beer, but it's a bit more pilsnery than I was expecting for the style, at least in terms of its apparent body and hoppiness. Definitely a unique and memorable brew. This is stunningly drinkable, balanced, and refined for such a hefty offering."
"O - If I was stocking up at a specialist beer store, this is not something that I would choose - I've had quite a few beers that I've enoyed far more. That said, it is definitely above average and still a very enjoyable beer. The fact that I can buy it at my local supermarket (which is not the fact with Rochefort 10, for example) means that I will undoubtedly be purchasing it on a semi-regular basis."
"O- a classic. A great intro to Belgian beers, and a beer you can't go wrong with."
"O - Not a massive fan of this classic but I will say that it's got the typical belgian yeast grunt with a touch of booziness. Good, not great."
"O: Absolutely wonderful. This beer became even better after it warmed up a touch. I don't believe it has taken me this long to try Duvel, but I am really glad I did. So complex, yet extremely drinkable. Great tingle in the mouth, with a wonderful taste. Truly a great beer."
"Medium bodied. Bubbles bite the tongue enough to tell you they are there. Easy sipper, a tad drying. Only a little bitter."
"D - This might be my favorite beer ever. Provides an all around great drinking experience. The drinkability is high and the taste is stunning."
"No disguise of the 8.5% strength, many flavours well integrated and difficult to pick out. Refreshing!"
"O: A real standard. Very easy to drink. Pour myself one 4 out of 5 nights while doing my closing work."
"O- Overall, this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended. I will continue to enjoy this one. Cheers."
"O: Excellent beer that I regret neglecting for so long. Please forgive me beer gods! If you were like me and saw this beer on the shelves numerous times and instead decided on something else than next time I beg you to give this beer a shot, I would doubt you would be disappointed. Cheers!"
"Overall one of my all time favorite beers."
"Well since then I drink Duvel every couple of weeks. I would drink it more often but its super expensive and really strong! Beside that, the gripe I have is the beer is SUPER bubbly. Bubbly to the point where sometimes I have to sit up to burp myself haha. If you see it available you have to try it."
"O-Didn't really care for this one, very light, dry and smooth but lacks and any wow factor, tasted like bubbles and a light champagne...it's not a horrible beer i just didn't have the buds for this one i guess..."
"O- All the pop of champagne... but with so much more going on than sour grapes! LOL!!! There's a reason this is one of the top beers of it's style... It deserves it! I found this bottle for $2 on the singles rack, but at $15/4-pack... it's still totally worth the price!"
"Food match: The finest of foods; caviar, lobster and truffles poached in a light saffron roux with Parma prosciutto wrapped asparagus."
"overall - Looks great and delivers. This is definitely one to remember and have again later. One of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ale's I've had."
"O: A solid choice. Simple, yet at the same time very complex."
"Overall, this beer rocks. It was one of the beers that introduced me to the wonderful things being done with beer in Belgium and going back to it, it is still a well crafted and delicious beer for any time of year."
"O: Very drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but I actually prefer Piraat 9."
"O - This beer exemplifies what a world-class BSA should taste like. The consistency, flavor, and aroma merge together almost flawlessly."
"o - pretty good but not great. definitely not a session beer at 8.5%. certainly not deserving of it's reputation."
"Drinkability: Excellent, truly excellent. Lots of flavour and feel. The alcohol is barely noticeable, everything goes down so smoothly. I can't wait to crack open the next bottle I have in my fridge. It really doesn't get much better than this."
"overall, a classic great belgian beer, the prime example of the strong pale style. ill definatly be drinking this again sometime, but still, theres many belgians i would pick up before this one."
"Taste was reminiscent of the aroma, completing the flavor profile. Spices were well balanced with tart apples finished by a beautiful hop bitterness. I was taken back by how strong in flavor this beer is with its high drinkability - light body, great carbonation and and a lasting mouthfeel. Purely fantastic!"
"There are so many good things about this beer. Claiming that it is a benchmark for the style may be an understatement. It deserves all of its accolades... Although you may not agree if you don't like Belgian yeast."
"O: Hard to get better than this. Every part of this is top notch, tasty, and enjoyable to drink."
"Overall--Spices and citrus zest cover the alcohol almost completely, which is impressive, given the relative strength. This beer is highly satisfying and approachable, and would make an excellent gateway into the wonderful world of Belgian beer. My only criticism would be that, considering that this is a golden ale, the finish could be a bit dryer, but overall this beer is very, very hard to pass up."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great tasting Ale."
"A great present from my dad, this is a brew I haven't had in easily three years. I used to remember it for its potency, but having worked my palate a bit more, I feel like I can now really appreciate its smoothness and fantastic composition. Certainly a great representation of the style, and a classic that continues to live up to its name."
"O: Rather tasty and refreshing. Not amazing, but enjoyable."
"Overall I haven't had a Duvel in a long time but genuinely appreciate it in the genre of a Golden. Really enjoy the spice to this beer."
"Duvel lives up to its image and is worth exploring for any skeptics wondering about the hype."
"D: So easy to have more than one after another after another due to how crisp this beer is. Sneaky and lives up to the name. Very enjoyable and one that I would recommend for those looking to find a way to get into Belgian beers."
"Duvel is a unique beer all to itself. I thi the closest thing I've had before is an Orval, but those are still worlds apart. Funky, hoppy, complex, fruity. A beer to aspire to."
"Overall this is just a delicious and thirst quenching Ale. The 8.5% ABV is not at all noticeable. A very refined and balanced Ale that reminds me of a fine Champagne. It seems at its best at about 45 to 50 degrees. This is not a âbigâ Belgium Ale and if you are looking for a very intense experience you should look elsewhere. I have overheard some negative comments about this Ale but I feel that it is exactly what it should be, not every Belgium can or should be a Triple. If you have not tried this please do so with an open mind and you will be rewarded with a very pleasant experience. I have enjoyed this Ale many times over the years and if fresh it is very consistent."
"This beer poured a nice light golden color with a little haze since i got the last pour and some yeast. the smell was slightly hoppy and a little spicey. the flavor was slightly hoppy, not flavor wise just a little bitterness, and a small amount of sweetness and an almost heiniken like skunkiness. the mouthfeel was ok but over all i was unimpressed by this beer"
"a great gift. This is a beer I always keep around."
"Overall: This is a legendary beer recipe that has been romanticized and written about to death - with good reason! How anyone could casually drink it on a weekly basis is beyond me, yet its tempting flavorful experience is a well justified excuse. Thanks to Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat, you can drink with the devil without running the risk of him stealing your soul in the process â even though drinking this beer at times seems to emulate such an experience!"
"The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with good amounts of carbonation, there's a nice bite on the tongue from the carbonation. Even with the bite from the carbonation, there is still a nice smoothness in each sip. This is extremely drinkable, and each sip makes you want to go back for more. Overall, this is an amazing brew. Annoyed with myself that I waited this long to try it. Everything just fits together so perfectly and the flavors are so appealing that you can't step away."
"This is one of those ""world-class"" beers that i just don't get. It's not awful...there are just several others in this style that I find much more palatable."
"Aggressive pour yields a massive white head with beautiful lace. Opaque luminous gold color. Smell is slightly vinous, malty, yeasty. Taste is sour white grape, booze, a little hop bitterness. Refreshing medium mouthfeel. A little bubbly. Sticky bitter finish."
"O: Kind of disappointed. Reminds me of a Hefe/Weizenbock minus the banana fruitiness to balance it out. This style just might not be for me as I don't think 2300+ BA's could be wrong. I'll give more in this style a shot and maybe come back to this one and rereview."
"D ~ A classic. Purchased often."
"The taste was strong, clean and intense but well balanced and smooth. I tasted initially a strong but sweet yeasty tartness that ends harmonious pleasing. Smooth but slightly crisp. This beer is a class act. It pours and tastes like a well heeled Belgian blonde. A strong, robust pleasing experience. I'd like to try it on tap and would go out of my way to do so."
"D - Good drink; its a Duvel; they make plenty of great stuff and I'm never let down by this drink: I still don't know why it took me so long to review this though, I never get over that..."
"About as good a beer as you'll find."
"This is one of those beers you can drink on any occasion. Â Light enough for a warm summer night; Â spicy and complex enough for a holiday meal. Â  Â Probably the best beer of it's style, it's hard to imagine someone not liking this.Â "
"Poured into a snifter. Thick soapy, iceburg head...light straw colored body with a lot of carbonation and ample lacing. The smell is sweet..sugar, belgian yeast, some alcohol and solvent, and a touch of apple. The taste is of belgian yeast, alcohol, and hops (much more than in the smell). The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall a good beer but too much alcohol in the taste will lower the overall score."
"Here is proof that a light colored, fizzy beer can have tons of flavor. This is one to seek out"
"Such a great beer. Very complex and hits all the right notes. Duvel is one that turned me on to craft and I always take way too long to revisit."
"I poured this into a Duvel wide glass best before 02-14 date (I'll save a couple of these). I poured a little too much and have a few lines of cloudy yeast near the top (I don't mind the yeast though), the color is pale yellow almost straw and it has a large foamy white head (following the pouring instructions) and it leaves a nice lacing. The smell is quite nice, Belgium yeast, pepper, spice, and sweet malts very strong. Medium mouth feel very carbonated, which tingles on my tongue and a little bit of peppery / bitterness is present. The taste is very good and very complex, the peppery taste is there, some spices, a little tartness and finishes bitter/dry. Very good, this is way better than I remembered the last (and only) time I had it a few years ago, but I was just starting on Belgiums then. Excellent beer, I'm glad I made this purchase."
"Obviously itâs good, itâs a well balanced Belgian style beer with a satisfying flavor, but itâs a little lighter than I expected. Itâs everyone elseâs fault, really, since everybody said it was one of the best beers out there and set my expectations way too high. I still like it a lot, but it fell below my expectations just a tiny, tiny bit."
"Overall - I'm absolutely in AWE...you MUST try this incredible ale! I am now questioning all of my previous high ratings, by comparison this would get 6's or 7's. I've never seen lacing like this, the color is very close to a Witbier and is the ""weekest"" attribute of this beer, the flavor and complex harmony is unlike anything I've ever tasted before, and the mouthfeel is so wonderful, smooth, drinkable and inviting. This beer is downright dangerous in a fantrastic way - I could drink this every night - I will buy this quite often from now on. It is fairly expensive, but absolutely worth every penny - I LOVE this beer, pure Pefection, Period."
"Definitely a very enjoyable beer. Every aspect of it was subtle and complex, but not so much so that it felt muted. Will definitely be drinking this one again."
"It's taken me too long to try this beer and find that itâs wonderfully complex yet light and refreshing. Itâs the style standard for a reason."
"Honestly, this brew for me started out much nicer then it finished and that is why I could not be that kind in my rating of this one"
"O - Overall, quite a nice one, though with the slightly high ABV, definitely more suited to enjoying by itself rather than as a session beer."
"Overall I can see why this beer is considered the paragon of its style. It is one of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen, it has a very complex nose and taste with a good mouthfeel. This is a great beer and deserving of the hype it gets."
"O - Great drink-ability, superb taste and mouthfeel, my local supermarket has these on sale, I'll be picking up a few more rest assured!"
"O/D - I was missing out passing this by on the shelf for so long. A great beer that typically very easy to find and equally easy to drink. I bought the 4pk gift box because it had the glass that everyone seems to rave about. I was very happy with the purchase; the beer was delicious."
"Picked up a gift set with 4 330 ml bottles and a beautiful Duvel snifter for only $13.99 at my local Friar Tucks. I poured 22 ounces of water to the rim of the glass, but it was a perfect fit for the 11.2 ounces of golden sunshine and the pillowy, white clouds of foam. The lacing was artful and distinct. The smell was bready and spicy ... I was expecting a bitter taste resembling a lager, but was surprised by a crisp, complex taste. I was pretty much all about thick Russian Imperial Stouts a few, cold months ago, but I'm trying new styles and finding them to be more refreshing as the weather warms up. A very memorable brew that I will surely be revisiting soon."
"O: Great beer. It is an all-round classic with no flaws. It has a spicy crisp light taste and the smell and appearance to go with it"
"O- An exceptional beer, has a few quality flavors that work very well together. Great smell and fantastic mouth feel. I will certainly be seeking this out again in the near future"
"The flavour of this beer are so well-integrated that it was tough to pinpoint specifics. An excellent example of the style."
"Overall- If you like Belgian beers you will like this one. Perfect example of the Belgian strong pale ale style. Highly recommended. I must say though i would leave the yeast out of this one. I had some with out the yeast and with the yeast and the yeast diluted some of the flavors of the beer."
"O: Overall a very good beer. However, and this may be heresy to some, I would have to say I prefer Delirium Tremens and it remains my favorite Belgium Strong Pale Ale. I will have to give this a couple more tries and see if I change my mind."
"Overall-The only problem with this beer is it's gone before a blink of an eye. So drinkable and smooth. Complex but easy drinking flavors. I don't drink this beer enough, and I'm glad I bought a single at HEB today while grocery shopping. Dammit, I want another."
"O: Wonderful belgian strong pale. Great strong flavors with a perfect crisp mouthfeel. You will want to drink glass after glass, a must try."
"O: I like it, its honestly a good drinker and a great summer time beer. Belgians aren't my favorite but I recommend this one."
"O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down smooth, and it tastes great. overall, I thought this was a great beer, and a great representation of the style. It is very refreshing, and I could drink it all day. I recommend this one."
"Overall: A good solid Belgian with an easy drinkability especially noting the %."
"O - A hell of a beer. I haven't bought this beer in awhile since the price increase. I can't believe I forgot how damn delicious this beer is. One of the best right here. So damn drinkable even at 8.5% abv."
"O: A superb beer - easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I've had Duvel many times now and it's always a treat."
"NOTE: I finally got a hold of a Duvel signature glass at my local beer store and considered myself lucky until I actually drank from it. The constant bubbling from the laser-etched ""D" at the bottom of the glass virtually guarantees that your beer will be totally flat within 20 minutes, so you better be a fast drinker. I prefer to enjoy my beer over the course of 30-45 minutes, so I intend to avoid the Duvel glass from now on. What a shame. I MUCH prefer the Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip) glass, it's well worth the price."
"O - It's alright. I don't feel its worth the price."
"D: Easily drinkable, and a little dangerous considering the ABV is well hidden. A great belgian strong that is quite refreshing with more of a subdued sweetness."
"Overall, I'm sorry I put this one off so long, fantastic brew"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Wouldnt go back, especially for the size and the harshness."
"this is an excellent beer.looks beautiful when pouring. has a two finger white head, looks like beaten egg whites. smell and taste are big. i get lemon and bananna at first followed by clove and pepper. barely a hop taste on the end. mouthfeel is rich and bubbly with a hint of dryness on the end. which is weird since it leaves my mouth salivating for more."
"O - one of my personal fav's don't care what anyone says, this beer will always have a special place in my tiny black heart. also if/when i get married this will be one brew that will accompany my beer nerds and i along with champagne for the ""outsiders"" hah....drink it"
"O - The yeast character really takes over, which isn't really my bag, but the citrus character and solid mouthfeel are keeping me interested."
"D: Exceptionally flavourful and refreshing; it'll be excellent for summer days, if difficult to drink very many in one sitting due to the carbonation and ABV. Absolutely deserves its reputation as the archetypal Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"This beer would go well on a hot summer day, or in the pub with your friends after a long day at work. I really like this beer, and would totally order it again. I did learn that Duvel means devil in Flemishâ¦ Iâm guessing itâs the ABV that made them decide to call it that! Delicious beverage; highly recommended."
"O - Superb for style."
"Overall: Truly the class of its style, in my opinion. As good on a summer day as it is hunkered in on a cool, rainy evening (which is often in Seattle)."
"O - Wow...even better than I hoped. This is an absolutely delicious, absolutely drinkable beer. I will definitely be going back for more than one of these babies."
"O: Devil beer. Spicy and noticable alcohol. 3.5"
"This is a good beer, and there are a lot of flavors going on. Not among my favorite styles, but this is a good example."
"Overall: This is one of the most well balanced beers I've ever had. I almost never fail to have at least one bottle in stock and feel proud to have finally reviewed it. This is the standard to which all other Belgian Ales should be compared."
"This brew has a slight fruit smell with a bitter then ever changing to crisp taste. The alcohol is plentiful and between the aroma and just sheer bliss of having a great tasting powerful belgian style pale ale I think everyone needs this 4-pack in the fridge at all times."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle marked: DU101123MN-23/09/13. Sampled on May 2, 2011. It pours a highly agitated, cloudy pale yellow with a significant amount of fizzy, puffy white head. The aroma has plenty of yeast, malts, and citrus zest. The body is smooth and of medium texture. The taste is a nice malty, yeasty character with a peppery and tangy bite at the end. Improves as it warms. One of the best in its class."
"A wonderful drinking experience. A little pricy in this neck of the woods to enjoy regularly, but certainly a nice occasional treat."
"Mouthfeel is again, crisp and tart with a very lively feel from the robust carbonation. Refreshing and dry. Overall a very nuanced, delicate ale with some very distinct, interesting flavors. The 8.5% abv was noticeably absent from the taste. A classic and worth a try by all means."
"O - I expected a great deal from this beer and was not disappointed - this is clearly a world class beer which I will keep stocked when it is available."
"O: The KING of Belgian Strong Pale Ales for good reason. It's a great beer for so many occasions. It's so hard to find anything bad about this drinking experience. I love it!"
"O- This is a great beer, and that is an understatement. It may be the best beer of its class out there, and is a personal favorite."
"I really like this beer. Everything about it is solid, and there are no obvious negatives. And all the pieces fit together really well. I really can't think of how I'd improve it."
"T: This is pretty delicious and ridiculously drinkable. There's a bit of a sour lemon taste upfront and some nice grassy hops towards the end. In the middle are some notes of green apple and grain. Very tasty."
"I love this beer. It goes down smooth . It does have a fruity taste to it snd it somewhat dry. Always pours with a 2-3 finger head.Also is a cloudy amber color which I love.It is a great beer to come home to at the end of a hard day. It is a costly one but if it is in your budget, definetly worth buying."
"Overall very good."
"A very enjoyable first experience with this one."
"O- probably the best Belgian beer that I've ever had. the spice notes are more subdued than most versions I've had. overall it's a well balanced quality brew."
"Overall: A great tasting classic import from Belgium."
"Pours into the appropriate Duvel tulip a bright golden color with a huge white fluffy head that almost fills the entire glass. There is a mini-spire of bubbles that roars from the ""D" carved into the bottom of the glass. The smell is dry and almost lager-ish. Faint smell of Belgian spice. Nothing special here. The taste is also dry, crisp and refreshing. A hint of the belgian spice along with sour apple. mouthfeel is a lively. overall, a solid refreshing brew. I think some of the coppycats might actually be a little better, but it's nice to have a classic."
"O - Hard to beat this brew for a BSPA."
"O- Serious perfection here, this brew is the work of craftsmanship, so sweet and tasty with a perfect touch of hops it just never gets boring and the pairings are endless."
"D - There is a reason why this is a staple for this style. Enough said."
"Overall - The only part of this brew that didn't overwhelm was the aroma, but even that was still better than most. 4.5 of 5"
"M: It's pretty carbonated, which works very well with this beer. Tastes phenomenal. Very enjoyable on a warm day."
"O: Flavor-packed, highly drinkable, and flat out delicious. Also, rumor has it that this brew is fairly low in calories, especially considering the ABV. Awesome stuff!"
"o- great easy drinking beer, awesome overall flavor profile and drinkability"
"330 mL bottle poured into a rudimentary chalice. This beer is just gorgeous. Pours a bright gold color with loads of carbonation and a huge frothy head. Big Belgiany aroma that at first reminds me of pineapple. Smells semi-sweet, almost like a bread dough. Carbonation translates to a very fizzy mouthfeel that isn't unpleasant. Taste is of lemon grass with some spicy hop character in the background. Malt profile is deftly handled with the beer sliding more to the bready side of the spectrum. Taste finishes with a light sourness and is very dry. There's a little bit of alcohol warmth the more you drink it, but that's certainly welcome for the style. All of the components of this beer are harmonious, singing together to create a symphonic experience. A classic."
"Overall - quite a good one for the style, really an enjoyable beer to drink"
"1oz of Absinthe"
"Overall - a damn fine brew. I can see this going extremely well on a hot summer day or a warm spring afternoon."
"I will definitely drink it again."
"Classic beer with good reason. I loved it the first time, and after having a lot more beers, my opinion is not diminished at all. It calls for sip after sip, and is a good thirst quencher to boot. Capable of complementing meals in addition to being worthy of serious study on its own."
"D: Medium. Fairly strong."
"Overall: If you haven't tried this you need to. Probably the pinnacle of this style."
"Overall, an excellent brew. I am almost always amazed at the stuff that comes out of Belgium and this is no exception. A classic!"
"A classic, and worthy of being ranked among the world's best beers. The flavours are both intense and subtle, but never overwhelming. It is also highly affordable, and should be on every beer lover's drinking list."
"This beer is one of my all time favorites. A true classic!"
"I have had this beer many times here in the US and in Europe and it is always consistant and one of the best beers in the world. I have tried a lot of other beers that try to compare but this is truly a one in a million brews, very hard to find a better beer."
"O- Very drinkable and enjoyable beer, even with the high alcohol. Looking forward to enjoying more where this came from."
"Tart and refreshing taste. An apple and pear flavor with herbal hops. The yeast is more subtle in the taste. Drinks softly and dryly. Very sweet. Similar to a pilsner attacked with yeast and brewed with pears."
"The carbonation really comes into play in the mouthfeel to bring the smells and flavours together in this well-rounded beer. Its quite smooth and is about halfway up the scale for dryness. Overall, I think this beer is worth much more than I paid for it, so I'll be coming back for sure. Great stuff."
"Overall a good beer, definitely happy with the purchase... wish they gave you a full 12 oz instead of 11.2, but its not the end of the world. Will buy again."
"Overall. Always a pleasure."
"I intend to revisit this as well as other belgian brews but overall I didn't really like this."
"Mouthfeel is like good champagne, without the mineral taste. Highly bubbly (your eyes don't lie) and a warming full body."
"D: Great beer. Whenever asked about Belgian Goldens, this automatically comes to mind."
"Overall an exceptional beer. A World Class beer."
"Overall: Duvel is a refreshing, light bodied beer. It is very sessionable, to the point where it could get you in trouble."
"Impossibly drinkable beer, sessionable to the point of getting into trouble!"
"The beer pours a pale, golden, yellow colot with an extremely lofty, bubbly, white head. It smells of apple and apricot with a hint of spice in it. The taste is a bit tart with hints of green apple, some banana and a leafy, bitter aftertaste. The beer is light but full bodied with lots of sharp carbonation. It's warming and has a dry finish. I thought the Duvel was great, I'd drink it any day, it's refreshing and light enough for warm weather, and it's nice and warming if it's cool outside."
"O - What a really good beer. Very flavorful, very drinkable. Really enjoyed it."
"D: given the abv, this one is not hard to drink, easy even, hard to believe for me actually how hyped this is in the States"
"There was some real pressure in this 750ml corked bottle. Opened like a bottle of champagne. Big four finger head of soap suds looking bubbles, pure white. Very good looking lace with lots of clinging power. The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart, but don't let the color fool you, this is some fine beer, not a light beer. Smell is a bouquet of savory fragrances: apple, spices, pepper, and sweet malt. Flavor is what a beer should taste like; clean tastes of apple, spices, sweet malt, and just the right amount of citrus. Very creamy and full feeling in my mouth as I savor every taste. Warning: Drinking the complete 750ml bottle at one setting will put a real hurt on you. I had no idea by the flavor that this beer was hiding a mule kick. Drink this wonderful beer when you have nothing to do for a good three hours, because you won't want to do anything for that time...maybe want another...but that is a whole new story."
"D: Easy to get down even with the intense carbonation; the mild flavor contributes considerably to drinkability. Not one of my favorites, but I did like it more than the first time I tried it; here's hoping that trend continues next time."
"Drinkability: Too much carbonation in combonation with bitterness for me. Don't think I would have more than 1 of these during a session."
"Medium-thick bodied, but the just insane amount of carbonation on the tongue makes this beer feel very different. Unlike some beers that become creamy form that carbonation this one becomes drier as a result."
"D - Awesome on this. Maybe better with some age than fresh. Smooth, flavourful and not a hint of alcohol noticable."
"Pours a pale murky yellow. Lots of pure white foamy head. Smells mildly hoppy with lots of floral and citrus on the nose. Tastes sweet and hoppy. Lots of citrus and some light bitterness from the hops. Vry nice mouthfeel. Well carbonated and very drinkable"
"Poured a light clear sparkling yellow with a large white frothy head and had poor lacing. The aroma was of a soapy yeast, herbal hops and a straw malt with notes of a blend of spices. It tasted light and mildy acidic in the beginning and finished with a nice light bitter hop flavor. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery/dry in texture. Overall a nice light, tasty, refreshing belgian Golden ale."
"D - Drinks way to easily for a beer at 8.5%. Very nice."
"D-world class, one of my favorites"
"Pour into a glass and which made a lot of head. Not a lot of smell when swirled, but the little bit there smells sweet. Initial taste is light and smooth. The after taste is easy without much flavor. There seems to be a bit of citrus and a hint of vanilla in the beer. Cheers."
"Very drinkable, this was the first Belgian beer I ever liked, and is still easily one of my favorite readily available imports."
"Ending notes: One of the best (if not the best) that I've tried of the style. Would get again in a heartbeat. Overall, a very refreshing and enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability - Best taste for any pale ale I've had. If it wasn't for the aftertaste, this might have made it on my regular rotation. But, grading it in style, it's absolutely great."
"A headache recipe- Turn the Duvel tulip glass upside down and place on top of the bottle, then invert. Slowly, slowly, slowly lift the bottle up for the perfect head ratio. Repeat about 2-3 times over the course of an evening. Good luck tomorrow!"
"I always try to have a few bottles of this on hand, one of my all time favorites."
"Poured into, what else, a duvel tulip, with a bright golden color and a beautiful white billowy head with sticky lacing all the way down the side of the glass. The aroma is light and pleasant with Belgian fruitiness. The flavor is light and crisp, with esters, fruityness, a bit of spice and the faintest hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is great and light, with lots of refreshing carbonation. I really enjoy drinking this beer. It is one that I should always keep on hand. So light, refreshing, complex and well priced."
"Drinkability- This is my favorite beer. I love the crisp, enticing flavors. It's got the fresh, invigorating appeal of just cut fruit. The alcohol flavor is balanced and enjoyable. You know right away you're drinking a formidable beer but it doesn't knock you over the head... right away. When I imagine Lords and Knights gathered around a thick oak table enjoying a well deserved feast after battle, I imagine them drink Duvel. Duvel is a masterpiece."
"D-Very clean,fresh taste...but it also had alittle too much yeast flavor and was alittle off for me. Might have just been a bad bottle.Still was a good beer but felt it to be too hyped for what it tasted like."
"Since this is maybe signature Belgian at it's finest, I'll spare the commentary. One of my favorites and always in my fridge."
"D: refreshing and enjoyable. i would like to put some of these away to see if there are any discernible differences, but this one fresh is delicious as well."
"This is an excellent and flawless beer. As complex as a good belgian strong ale is but yet refreshing with a very nice crispy character. I just can't see why so many people put this in the same league with the world's best"
"This beer is very light almost goldend in color but not cloudly. Its almost a champane color with very ample head. Pour very slow and careful. Its a very drinkable beer that is very smooth and mellow in taste exact notes are hard for me to discribe. I love popping the cork on the brew."
"D - Who would ever pass up a chance to drink one of the best ale in the world. Well except when it is aligned with other great beer then it is hard to choose."
"I know this is a standard for the style, but I can recall being underwhelmed by this one previously. But not this time. Extremely attractive, nuanced, subtle, balanced and complex. A very impressive brew, even if the style is not my favorite."
"crystal clear golden beer with a tight white foam head. the beer almost appears champagne like with the bubble streams coming from the bottom of the glass. fruity undertones and over decent belgian golden ale. worth the price...meh. overall decent golden ale offering."
"Drinkability: Good, not my favorite belgian, but good."
"Drinkability: The head and retention is at its best, from what I have seen, but it would look far more impressive if it wasn't so murky. This is only a small price to pay for a beer with such a complex taste that isn't overpowering in any individual aspect, accompanied by a mouthfeel that is beyond satisfying. This is, without a doubt, a great beer, so the 8.5% Alc./Vol. will likely catch up to you if you overindulge."
"Poured from a 750 ML into Duvel glass. Big foamy white head that leaves a lot of lacing. The color is light golden and little chill haze. The aroma is grainy with fresh grassy hops. There is a perceived sweetness on the nose from the malt. The taste is crisp, peppery spiced hops followed by a nice malt backbone. The body is medium with good carbonation. A go to brew when you want to drink a great blonde belgian ale."
"Incredible beer I will be having more of this I would suggest to any fan of beer."
"D: I didn't find the taste here all that interesting or unique. To me it was almost like a slightly more flavorful, over carbonated run of the mill pilsner. The drinkability is hindered by the high carbonation. To this beers credit it masks the ABV well. Still, I prefer delerium tremens to this any day."
"D: This is wonderful all around. It is a glorious experience to drink this out of its own glass as well."
"D-Is this really 8.5%? The alcohol is almost a non-factor in this beer, this is incredible, simply stated one of the best, period."
"D: A 750ml bottle is more than enough for 1 person, the first glass went down extremely easily but I did start to feel the effects on the 2nd glass and final pour. This is probably one of the better beers available in NH, I can see the smaller bottles becoming a staple in my fridge for somewhat 'special' occasions."
"D - Yeah, stuff is dangerous. Could put back 4 four pack of this stuff in probably minutes. The 8.5% is there, sure, but the other aspects of the beer hide it oh so nicely. Buy this beer, enjoy it in the propper glass, and enjoy!"
"Overall: What to say that hasn't already been said. If you love beer, you must drink this one. Buy the glass, buy a bottle (or 20). This is a great ""Champagne beer"". Drink it with someone special."
"The CPJ"
"drink ability is very good even though the abv is high....just a great all round beer"
"Very tasty beer, lots of interesting flavors here, the alcohol can be strong at times but it is well balanced with the other flavors. Also very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is definitely light bodied with a good deal of carbonation. It seems to fit in perfectly with the other qualities this beer has. It's incredibly drinkable. Great brew, no surprise it's a classic."
"World class and a triumph of modern brewing technology. I would classify this beer as one of the top 3 in the entire world."
"D - Very drinkable for such a flavor complex beer."
"One cannot say enough great things about this beer. All other Belgian blondes/goldens cannot touch this one. Thank you, Duvel Moortgat for this gem."
"Poured young and correctly, crystal clear and fresh with a white afro of head scraped straight across. Nice hop smell without the tired piney stank. Flavor is exactly what you would look for in a Belian ""devil beer"" (Lucifer, Judas, etc.). Dry, quenching, lightly spicy and yeasty. If there's a comparison, chamagne would be close in texture. I'd argue this is the benchmark model, as there's incredible balance here. Having had aged versions, I prefer the fresh version much more for drinkability. After being fortunate enough to get a tour of this brewery, the beer pouring class at the end was very fun. Free beer wasn't bad either. Shhh...the Duvel is sleeping."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. It's amazing how readily available and how relatively inexpensive it is."
"An outstanding beer that I would never drink in my home without that tulip glass - it really brings the tasting experience to a whole other level."
"I can't rate this very high and probably not going to have it again for drinkability cause I know there are others in this style that I prefer by far."
"D-Very easy drinking and satisfying."
"Overall- What a great beer. Easily one of my top 20 to 25 beers I've ever had. I enjoy so many aspects of this beer and highly recommend it to anyone. It's complex yet approachable. It's easy to like as a beginner but has enough going on to be equally appreciated by a any drinking veteran."
"Im definatley a fan of this....the lasting tastes of malty hops and honey just fuels the desire for more. I even questioned if this even had alcohol in it....you can hardly taste it or feel it....a perfect beer with dinner and Im absolutely going to be drinking this in the future"
"Only complaint is the bubbles can be sometimes too tough."
"Drinkability: it became easier to drink the more I had. A good all around beer."
"D: A great BSPA that isn't too strong, this one could be an every day beer for me if I ever had a staple. Drinks amazingly well for 8.5%"
"D - all day, all night."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its complexity. At first, when judging the aroma, it was difficult to get a handle on the flavoring within. Once it sat for a while, and we sipped, it really opened up. The flavoring, which was an interesting mix of bitterness and sweetness gave the drinker a good deal of contrast."
"D: I'm about to finish the bottle, so I guess it's OK. Nice beer for summer evenings."
"Drinkability: This beer goes down way too easily. You'll be wondering where that 8.5% alcohol is. Duvel translates as ""devil", and this devil sneaks up on you if you drink more than one."
"D: This beer is extremely well balanced. Despite being almost 8.5% ABV it's very easy to drink."
"M, D- Light bodied, bitter finish."
"Food pairing: chili, porterhouse steak, seafood, good cheese. Rule of thumb: if it goes well with sourdough, or if you like the dish with a twist of lemon, this beer will compliment it nicely."
"I knew of Duvel, read about it, never had it. Poured a pale golden and hazy gold, incredible billowy white head, never really receded. Smelled yeasty and of sourdough bread. Tasted yeasty, had some sweetness to it, and was well-rounded. Carbonation is perfect, mouthfeel is right on to make this pale ale way too drinkable at 8.5%."
"D-very high"
"Drinkability- careful not to drink more than one of these, this small bottle packs a big punch."
"Drinkability - I'm quaffing this sucker. Very good."
"D: An incredibly drinkable beer that is a prime example of the beauty of simplicity."
"It is obvious why this is so high on the top beers list. Nothing needs improvement. Almost a perfect beer for me."
"D: Definitely different from what I remember. Not really worse or better, just different. Still not my favorite beer."
"Amazing beer and I love the super-carbonation! Very drinkable as long as you enjoy the dry champagne feel and taste."
"Medium bodied but a very light impression for the strength. Also, very effervescent with a smooth and dry finish."
"Drink- One of the first Belgians I ever had. Nice to revisit an old standby."
"D - As I was drinking, I couldn't help but think of the similarities to champagne. That said, it's definitely an enjoyable beer that I'll come back to."
"Very sweet and fruity nose, didn't notice a strong hop scent. First sip you notice the fruit flavors up front, pear maybe a bit of apricot. Mouth feel can only be described as effervesent. Nice dry finish with no bitterness or aftertaste. This is the most balanced beer i've tasted. Dangerously drinkable. After the 750ml I was feeling good and looking for more."
"Spicy yeast hits the tongue first and a rich full flavor beer develops on the palate eventually wiping clean. More of that light floral hopping, sweet residual sugars, pear, citrus and white pepper. Moderate mouthfeel, barely an aftertaste, and little trace of alcohol. Just a great balanced beer. Benchmark for the style. But at the same time I wish something would stand out. It's funny that everyone looks for a certain balance in a beer but this is almost seems too balanced."
"D: I'm going to answer that easily in two words, ""Hell yeah"". You don't notice the higher ABV that is typically found in your Belgian style beers. This one seems lighter lighter and fresher to me, making it real easy to have a couple in a sitting. I would take my time savoring this one with each and every sip though. Great job Duvel, I think I'm going to pour myself another!!"
"not bad i would say, though."
"Had it numerous times - on tap as well as bottle poured in various glassware. To keep this popular world-class beer review brief - Pours a nice golden appearance with a relatively big white head, a strong but fruity aroma and taste, however, a little dry and a little spicy. A very drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ale indeed."
"Poured from a 11oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. The beer pours a crisp golden, yellowish pale color, with a head that measures almost 2 inches and tries its hardest to run over the sides of the tulip glass. The stream of bubbles rising to the head is mesmerizing, like watching fish in a tank. The smell reminds me of candy, sweet delicious candy made of fine yeast and malts, its a very savory scent that grabs your nose and doesn't let go. The taste is incredible. Comes in sparkling and rough and leaves soft and sweet. This beer has amazing drinkability, there really isn't enough i can say about this except that tasting this makes me so happy that i got out of drinking cheap domestic beers, and broadened my beer horizons."
"Dangerously drinlable with 8.5%"
"Overall, a very well crafted beer most deserving of the acclaim which follows the name. It certainly is the standard bearer of its style."
"Pours out a pale, straw looking yellow with a slight haziness. Good looking white bubbly and frothy head that remains and provides excellent lacing. Strong smell of pears, apples and a touch of alcohol. Definitely some sweetness going on in the nose as well, along with some fresh smelling Belgian yeast. Very smooth and creamy taste that combines well with notes of ripened fruit, yeast, and a touch of citrus. A fitting sweetness rounds out the brew, while a slight bitterness manages to massage the tastebuds, followed by a slightly dry finish. The moderate body, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, and matching carbonation blend nicely with the overall makeup of the beer, making this an exceptional beer with exceptional drinkability. Amazing..."
"D - This marries the qualities of the best German pilsners and the unique spicy and yeasty aspects of Belgian ales. Crisp, clean bitterness and strong hop character combined with the fruity, estery Belgian yeast is a match made in heaven. Deserving of its reputation and scarily drinkable. This bottle is disappearing too quickly...maybe I should have taken the advice on the bottle and found a good looking stranger to share this with..."
"D-the taste stays, its fun to drink. the ABV hits expectedly. honestly, this beer will grow on you. the first time i had...i didn't care for it, the second time...i thought it was okay. but then i noticed that i would start to crave it, and now when i drink it, i really enjoy it."
"Poured from bottle into a generic tulip. Appears a deep gold with a huge, frothy head. This head just doesn't quit! Leaves a decent amount of lacing as it slowly dissipates. Smells of citrus, pepper, and a bit of dough. Taste is a amped up version of the smell, with the peppery citrus filling the bill, and the bready taste following on the finish. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Not too thick, just luxurious. Way too drinkable. Glad I don't have more, or work would be difficult tomorrow!"
"D - Given the high ABV this stuff is delicious and incredibly drinkable. I can understand why this offering is so well rated, and is highly recommended to any fan of Belgians."
"A classic, but in a blind tasting, I doubt I'd give this good of a score. The subtleties in the hop profile just get lost under all the super fresh American beers available drowning my senses."
"With the high ABV, one might have to watch themselves with this. It does come in a cool little bottle though."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale straw yellow with a three finger white foamy head. It looks like a pale cider. The aromas are kind of bland. It's kind of spicy and it kind of smells like freshly cut apples. It's mellower than I thought it would be. I'm not really impressed with the taste either. It's ok but just ok. It slowly gets better the more sips you take. It's a standard Belgian pale. There's definitely worse beers out there but this doesn't impress me. It drinks light and smooth and you'd never know that it's 8.5%. It's just not that great in my opinion."
"Cheers!!"
"Drinkability: More please, this is a great beer."
"D: solid. this is always a sipper and at 8.5% should be respected"
"Taste-Orchard fruit,peppery pear, spicy, creamy, earthy, coarse hops. Super-drinkable, a different nuance of flavor in every sip. Seemingly simple, yet full of character nad complexity. Superbly balanced and unique. Finely crafted and exceptional. Sip slowly and enjoy every nuance of one of the world's great beers!"

"Conclusion: I love Duvel, I have been drinking it since I started going out. And every bar in Belgium carries this, so I've had a lot of Duvels already. It is THE example of the style."
"D/M: very strong carbonation tingle, smooth drinking, easy drinking due to the nice lemon notes"
"Sublime."
"So dang drinkable for 9.5%. Creamy texture is very, very quaffable. Yet, this is one to enjoy and savor."
"A classic, one that I don't drink as much as when I started to get into craft beer. Pours a huge, billowing lacey, white-as-the -driven-snow head that must be properly poured into it's own glass, or the closest equivalent.Spicey, fragrant, floral, angelic. Pours clear and golden like a lager or a pils, but is far from. Letting the yeast in with the pour gives an extra amber/ orange. Taste: the yeast is very prominent on the tongue, along with a pepper spiciness, citrus, decent malt levels, and crisp bitterness. Alcohol is slightly noticable. Mouthfeel: super crisp at the start and finish, and the finish is slightly dry. Medium bodied brew.Drinkability: superb drinkability as this is one of the more refreshing Belgian beers on the market."
"An overrated and pretty expensive beer. Won't be giving this one another chance unless someone pours me one."
"D: Very approachable, easy-drinking beer. Glad to have one any time, but a better warm-weather beer."
"D: there's really no good reason to not buy this beer; (unless your not a fan of this style... But who isn't!) especially when its pretty readily available in a four pack that comes with a glass for a good price. A wonderful ale that has a lot going for it at a good price is a quick buy again."
"Mouthfeel is very good, making it a VERY drinkable beer. This is not the best belgian ale for no reason, this is IT, this is the best of the best. A must have for every belgian ale lover (outside of belgium, of course). Highly recommended."
"D: Very nice beer. Reminds me of a lager and an ale. Website says you can cellar this stuff for a few years. I'm going to throw one in the pantry and and see what happens in a year."
"Duvel has a great reputation, and with good reason. This is a great Belgian pale ale, a stunning example of the style, and truly a world class beer."
"d. super drinkable, flavorful and deep, but an easy partner to hang with."
"Poured into a Duvel glass from a 4pk gift set. Pours a hazy translucent golden-yellow pale body with an enormous airy head. One of the most beautiful beers out there... Smells delightful with hints of banana, clove, slightly metallic and whiffs of EtOH. Tastes spectacular-it is best to dive into the beer and get a froth moustache to enjoy the full flavor. Has a distinctive banana bready sweet flavor with a nice aromatic feel on the tongue. Just enough bite from the hops to balance the sweetness. Overall an absolutely excellent beer!"
"help it"
"Drink, one is enough, I have 3 more to go and I will finish them somehow, maybe I will become enlightened as to why this beer is supposed to be so great..."
"Pours a very hazy straw yellow with a BIG, white, frothy head. Aroma is strong funk with a bit of hay. I get a lot of lemon zest followed by light bubblegum aromas. A bit of earthiness and banana as well. Taste is absolutely delicious! I get that funky barnyard taste I get from most good saisons... with a lot of lemon and peppery spices. The clove and banana are not overwhelming, which happens a lot with Belgian pales and triples. The lemon gives a bit of tartness, and the earthy, Belgian yeast flavors make this one delicious treat. Mouthfeel is very complex and full bodied with a highly carbonated crisp finish. Drinkability is quite high, considering the ABV."
"D - As high as it gets. The alcohol flavor is masked for an 8.5 ABV. I am shocked at how smooth it is for a high ABV beer. I could drink many of these and probably get in trouble for it."
"Some of Warren's friends brought this, and I guess I never reviewed it! Pours a cloudy straw gold, small pour but big head. Greater-than-average lacing. Aroma of such a rich Belgian yeast. Beautiful. Perfect wheat and citrus balance. Taste of wonderful wheat, rustic orange peel (no idea what the hell rustic has to do with oranges, it just pops into my mind), unmistakable and not-overpowering Belgian flavor. Enough said. Instant classic."
"one of the 10 brews to be delivered on my lonely island ..."
"If real Czech pilsner and good champaigne could mate ( possibly after a romantic evening of consuming large quantities of cloves and very dry mead), this would be their offspring. This beer has all of the flavor and nuance that American lagers claim to have. Imagine if a BMC beer was actually as good as their advertisements claim and you will get a pretty good idea what Duvel tastes like."
"Duvel was a hazy golden color. It had a large white head with impressive retention and lacing. The smell was fruit, yeast, hops, and a little pepper. The taste was excellent with a good mix of light malt, a little fruit, yeast and peppery spices. The finish was dry and lingering. It was medium-light in body and highly carbonated (in a good way). The drinkability was outstanding. This is a very good beer that is well worth seeking out."
"On the palate Duvel is light bodied and very highly carbonated. Flavor is delicate despite the high ABV. There is a light pale malt flavor, with a strong hop presence on the finish. Clean flavor overall, with only a slight, candy-like yeast presence adding depth. This beer is incredibly drinkable, and not just ""for the ABV."" This is a fast-sipper."
"Secondly, when pouring always always ensure all of that fine sediment from the bottle goes into your glass. Always. Unlike almost all other bottle conditioned beers Duvel's sediment is there to be consumed and is paramount in appreciating this classic."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a tall white fluffy head. As the head slowly recedes it leaves some very cool lacing on my glass. The beer is no as transparent as I expected. The smell is wonderful, it smells of sweet grain. The taste is of lemon-citrus, yeast with bits of hops and wheat. The 8.5% is hidden quite well. Mouthfeel is perfect, light, crisp and refreshing without being watery. Drinkability is great, but at 8.5% ABV, I don't think I'll let myself have more than one glass at a time."
"Drinkability: It's gone already?!? Honestly, one of the best, easiest drinking beers I have tried to date. The price is the only thing that would keep me from drinking this several times a week."
"Drinkabilty - Its too complex and strong to drink anymore then 2 really. Its a sipper to savior and enjoy. I wouldnt drink this weekly since you would become spoiled and possibly broke. World class, thank god i bought a 4-pack!"
"This is another beer that you will not tire of with frequent consumption. This is one of my all time favorite beers!"
"Enjoy!"
"this is the good stuff."
"For all of the A+ and A ratings this one seemed a little overhyped to me after my tasting. The head and continuous carbonation truly was amazing. Almost too amazing as I poured slowly into a tilted pint glass, but had to wait after 6 oz poured as the head was already 3 to 4 fingers thick and near the top of the glass. The appearance was slightly murky somewhere between a pilsner and a wheat. The flavor was good, not great, and the high alcohol content was well disguised. For the high price tag, I was expecting a little more spectacular beer, but its still a decent beer worth a sampling. It is very drinkable and if I weren't such a lightweight, I could probably have a 2nd or 3rd..however 1 is enough for me to feel it."
"Duvel is just a wow beer. I've had it once or twice, but hardly ever seek it out or try it when out because it's nearly ubiquitous at any good beer bar or shop. There is really no reason not to drink Duvel more often if one does not. The pour on this beer is perfect! The beer is a bright sunshine yellow with goldenrod highlights and is capped by billowy, finely held-together pearly white head that sticks and stays forever. Duvel has a nice fruity aroma with notes of spicy yeast and toasted malt. The beer has good flavors of apples skin, juicy asian pear, a little pepper spice and a nicely dry finish. The beer is highly carbonated and does a light spritzy dance on your tongue. Very easy to drink and the 8.5% percent alcohol is well hidden and with just a little warming in the throat but no burning taste."
"O - Definitely worth coming back for a second sample glass."
"Overall impression: smooth, effervescent Belgian pale ale."
"A truly great beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A pale golden color is poured in the glass. A strong white colored head, that is two fngers thick and hangs on to the sides of the glass. A yeasty fragrance strikes the nose, followed by a mild funky scent, but not off putting. It finishes with a light to medium grassy scent. A bread and cracked grain flavor comes through at the front of each taste. Then it blends to a yeasty twang, then moving to a grassy and earthy bitterness. A watery feel, with cleansing sensation of carbonation, it then finishes with a strong dryness that seems last forever on the palate. Another beer that is the standard for its style and does not disappoint. A classic with its golden color, the yeasty flavor, and dry feel, makes one crave some mussels and frites."
"A classic that never goes out of style, it pairs nicely with some Gorgonzola spread on freshly toasted baguettes. Some smoked salmon on the side is gracefully engaged and complements the combination, for a petite feast of grandeur."
"D/O- A true celebratory beer (review #100!), Duvel needs to be respected. Don't think you'd want to make a night of this as that's probably not what the brewer wanted. This one 11.2 ouncer won't be difficult to finish at all...craving the next sip already. Great world-renown beer."
"Bottle. Pours golden color with a nice, long lasting, white head. Aromas is of Belgium yeast, apple and some brown sugar. Medium to full body. Flavor is sweet fruit and yeast in the beginning followed by lengthy, earthy hoppy finish. This beer is classic."
"What a great beer...certainly something worth trying if you haven't already, and revisiting throughout the year if you've sampled before."
"D- This beer is good. I always forget about this with the insane amount of craft beer out there. The ABV is pretty well hidden until the ending. Good beer and well worth the praise a lot of people have for it."
"D - This is a delicious brew and I'm a bit upset with myself that it took me this long to try it. If it weren't so expensive, it would be a daily stock item in my frig. I think I could drink this all night."
"330ml Bottle, poured into Palm tulip. Fairly light colour, slight haze, large foamy head, good retention, lots of lacing. Aroma was dominated by Phenol. Tasted yeast, sugar and phenol. Later I picked up some bready maltyness. Hid the booze very well. Creamy texture, very light body, moderate carbonation. Overall a beer without weakness, other SBPAs have more depth but this is what they modeled themselves on."
"Drinability: The after taste for sure makes you have another and not filling at all."
"D-Very nice and drinkable beer. I held out on drinking this for a long time because you can find it in so many places but I see why people like it. I would drink this again."
"D: Goes down easily, a kick you don't see coming, not too filling, great representation of style. Why I waited so long to tr this beer I will never know!"
"96 Points."
"M/D - Pretty easy drinker. A bit sweet for my tastes, but very nice. Leaves my mouth a bit dry and a bit bitter. Not as thin as it looks, but certainly not a milk shake. Pretty even bodied."
"D: For the ABV, the drinkability is very good."
"D- Eloquent, vibrant, lively, champagne like. Wish there was more spice. Would have been perfect if it had that clove, allspice, or cinnamon sense. Seems to be amiss in this. Clean and refreshing beer though. Almost like a sparkling wine, yet creamy."
"D: When I haven't had Duvel in a while I forget how good it is. Then I drink it and I remember."
"This is a must have. Hard to find any flaws in this delicious brew."
"drinkability; this is really drinkable but I drank a 750ml. bottle and I'm feeling it! A beer to be respected for sure, have a couple and call it a night. I can tell this beer will cause a headache in quantity."
"D: I'm not completely sold on this one as one of the best beers in the world... maybe its the style I don't particularly like... it is too boozy, I prefer a regular BPA."
"Overall, don't let the lite pale color (looks harmless) fool you! This is a very good and complex brew. It would be a very sessionable if not for the abv%."
"Recipe for disaster!"
"After pouring the beer into the glass, the color of the beer is what you would expect from a lager. The head is very fizzy, and lasted through most of the beer. The carbonation is fizzy, but doesnt overly burn the mouth. It is a sweet beer, but is balanced very well, with a nice noble? hop spiciness. The mouthfeel is light. At 8.5% this beer is very drinkable!"
"Every genre of music and film have their all-time classics, the mainstay and must-haves for any collector, the benchmarks upon which so many others have been either inspired or emulated. For Belgian beer, Duvel is certainly just that. It is at once light and refreshing yet bold and complex, simple but elaborate, a beer so suited to quick, mindless quaffing precisely because it is so mindful of balance and proportion. A true magnum opus."
"cheers"
"Pours a pale straw yellow producing a fizzy thick foam head which retains strongly. The nose is grain, pale malts & yeast. The head is taking forever to fade, first sip yeilds some foamy head while the beer itself is quite smooth. Light on the palatte, tastes almost sweet. This certainly tastes alot better than it smells (basically your typical pale ale). No lingering aftertaste, finishes quick and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty high, this is easy to tip back. Outstanding in it's class, im not usually a fan of pale ales, but this is great tasting. Bottle is original and has a cool design."
"Its not easy to make a review for a beer that has almost no faults, its simply a world classic. By far one of the best beers I have ever tried (not that many at this point) The foam is exceptional. Fruity and complex in a clean, delicate way. I will have a few more in the future..."
"I have an interesting relationship with this beer; sometimes it's as good as they rave, others not so much."
"D - I don't see a need for drinking more than one, but it could be done. This is so complex and tasty, it's worth savoring (and saving unopened bottles for another time)."
"I want to write this review with the utmost respect and certainty, as this beer deserves nothing less."
"Two thumbs up!"
"Poure from the bottle a nice golden yellow with traces of the yeast sediment, it kept a nice pillowy white head that retained through the beer and left nice lacings. Taste is very nicely balanced between the buscuity malts and floral hops and the earthy fruity yeast. The mouthfeel is very pleasant light in body but very smooth almost creamy from the carbonation. A very drinkable beer despite a higher abv."
"D- Quite unique beer. Too much carbonation for my liking, but I can see how it adds to the drink. A rarity at the lcbo here so will definitely get some while it's here."
"Beer is light bodied, but the small bubbled but active carbonation makes it decently creamy in the mouth. Aftertaste is pleasant and not overpowering. A nice standby to drink that widely available now."
"Medium body, with a small bite to the tongue. Finished pleasantly dry."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer and easy to drink. I would like to try it again but it didn't blow me away."
"Make sure you pronounce it right. Has a bitter, hoppy aroma with a slight flower bouquet. Pours a hazy golden color with a thick pillowy head. Has a sweet dry taste, with a bitter after taste. A creamy beer with a medium body. Has a high carbonation level. A very tasty beer."
"D: Very high. Extremely refreshing."
"Approved."
"D - The big bottle was a bit much in one sitting (ABV), but a 16 ounce bottle would be proper for a one beer evening."
"D - Crisp enough to distract from the ABV. Could have a few."
"Mouth feel was light and dry. Carbonation was above average. Drinkability was high despite the high ABV. An excellent beer, but again, nothing really stood out as being head and shoulders above other beers of the same style."
"Had it many times before, reviewing for the 1st time. Pours clear golden color with a puffy white head. Less lacing than other bottles I've had. Good retention. Aroma is very clean of grassy noble hops, estery yeast, a bit of lemon. Taste is also dominated by yeast esters and grassy flavors with some noble hops. Crisp pilsen malt body that is clean. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly and fairly carbonated. Nice clean dry finish, not cloying and alcohol is totally un-noticed."
"Both the smell and taste kinda reminded me of a pilsner, but a really good pilsner (and apparently much more boozy). Very easy to drink, especially at the ABV value. Not quite for drinking when you are cutting the grass, but definitely something for the patio or casual drinking."
"Drinkability: You could get yourself in trouble with a few of these. It's so refreshing and hides the ABV so well, you could pound a few before the alcohol caught up to you!"
"Overall, I can see why this is the benchmark for the style. Definitely a must have."
"Very easy to drink and very tasty. Recommended to everyone. I really enjoyed it."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable and hides its alcohol in a dangerous way, yet if you take the time you'll be amazed by the complexity. It is truly one of the greatest beers in the world."
"I don't understand why this beer isn't more readily available in the United States. It's more money than some, but not as much as others, and it's the best beer made. Bar none."
"Overall, it was good beer, i would buy again to mix things up but it didnt blow it me away, but nonetheless a good beer, cheers"
"The kinds of words needed to describe this brew require a wine connoisseur. I love wine as well, and maybe the best way to describe Duvel is something akin to a carbonated wine made with grains and hops instead of grapes. You'd have to be a masochist to get totally drunk on this stuff. Drink slow. Enjoy."
"Drinkability - I've had this beer in the past but not on a review scale. I enjoyed this beer very much, this is my highest rated beer to date and i know why. It brings so much of what a beer is met to be to the table!"
"The power of this brew can really sneak up on you considering it's drinkability. One of the greatest beers in existence."
"Great drinkability. Tasty classic beer."
"D - Very drinkable, would enjoy on a hot summer day or with a light meal."
"D: I see this as a very drinkable beer, the flavors are very good and the ABV is hard to detect. I find this beer to be, as always enjoyable for the style.Â Â Â "
"Taste has apple and pear notes, with a nice level of spice from the hops (saaz noteably) and a slight bitterness that rounds into lemony citrus. Clean, crisp mouthfeel, with some prickly carbonation. Tasty brew."
"D- This is one of the best. Hard to top this one."
"Pretty clear, pale yellow color with lots of fluffy white head out of an 11.2 oz. bottle. The first scent I notice is skunk. It kind of fades into some spiciness and a combination of floral and citrus hops. There's an overall grassy flavor with pear overtones. I really expected this to be better. The skunkiness sticks around a little too long for my liking. Lots of biting carbonation with a crisp and tangy finish that is fairly dry. Pretty drinkable and the alcohol is really unnoticeable."
"by far my favorite pale ale having said that im not a big pale ale beer liker but this one is really good and will definitly have it again"
"HV"
"Light, clear, yellow pour with a massive, rocky, white head. The aroma is floral, funky, and yeasty with some light citrus, apple, fresh bread dough, and faint candi sugar. The classic Belgian esters and very subtle in the nose also. The flavor is very herbal, floral and citrusy upfront with some light fresh bread and soft banana/clove esters rounding out the middle. The finish is lightly yeasty with just a touch of sweet candi sugar to balance it all. The body is very light, and refreshing with lots of tingly carbonation."
"M/D - Medium body, with a semi-sweet finish, great carbonation. Wonderful flavor and a simply complex flavor profile, haha. Non-abrasive and super easy to drink."
"Aromas of pale malts, fruity esters of apple tartness and pear,some candied sugar, quite noticeable alcohol. Flavors of green apple tartness and pear rolled into soft pale malts, slightly peppery with warming alcohol notes. Tons of carbonation and bitterness derived from Styrian Golding hops lend dry finish with bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body seems lighter due to effervescent texture and crispiness. One might say that Duvel is a style of its own, but in terms of Belgian golden strong ale it does a poor job. Fruity esters are somehow indecisive and lacking any citrus notes, spicy and peppery phenolic to subdued (at least in the aroma section). Duvel was created as a response to the growing popularity of Czech pilsners and their German counterparts that ravished across Europe at the time. And this is what it is - although basicaly an ale, Duvel is merely a pilsner clone on steroids."
"If your searching for a Great Belgium Ale this one fits the bill."
"Got to love the cloudy mouthfeel of this beer, so much that an entire bomber is hardly excess. Pretty amazing to say the least."
"On the taste the pale malt upfront with an herbal/grassy and soft fruit middle (touch of lemon citrus acidity) leading to a dry bready finish; very tongue prickling in a good way. The finish is the standout for me as the crisp, peppery like bitterness matches the malt perfectly. Additionally the high carbonation refreshes the palate and made my mouth water for another sip. Alcohol is masked so well that the only reason you know its relatively high in alcohol is by how fast you can catch a buzz; it truly is a devilishly top notch brew."
"mere ""good"" beer"
"D - a great example of strong beer, the alcohol is unnoticed but the taste and feel is full and refreshing"
"Heh, if it wasn't for the glass i probably would not have tried it.."
"Repuation is a funny thing. It seems to be derived from heightened expectation leveraging against the actual product in question. I believe this beer is just that, one that relies on you thinking it is one of the finest beers in the world, and if you believe it just enough, you will elevate the status of this beer from merely good to great."
"The appearance and mouthfeel are certainly the highlights here. The beer is soft and crisp at the same time. Light and airy, it's got just a touch too much booze in the finish to be considered perfect. But very, very good feel, perhaps the Moortgat family did make a deal with the devil to have a beer this refreshing not feel too watery. Overall, this is certainly a benchmark setting beer, certainly deserving of top ratings and acclaim. I do feel like I've had some beers that have been a bit more targeted towards my palate and personal preferences. But this is the legend, the Rolling Stones or even Robert Johnston of the Belgian beer scene. One thing is for sure. If this beer leaves you singing the blues, maybe it's time to be a wine drinker. Classic stuff."
"Tasty, easy to drink and very much a classic."
"This is one of my favorite summer beers. It pours a gorgeous, light, hazy golden color with a head that hangs to the side of the glass. The aroma is generally a 'yeasty' kind of sour smell. The flavor delivers what you expect from the smell: a lovely sourness with hints of apple and pear. With an ABV of 8.5% this beer is easy to drink for longer periods of time than many Belgians of equal quality."
"Looking for a clean drinking Belgian Pale with some octane? Go for it. Just keep your expectations reasonable."
"This isn't the sort of thing I'd even consider drinking multiples of at one sitting but for what it is it's very drinkable. The alcohol didn't make itself known until I stood up."
"Drinkability is not bad, 3 of these would be good for being drunk. Price however is abit high, however for getting drunk its only a premium price. Will enjoy this again."
"D - Basic for the style but a great example. Always liked this one."
"medium, medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. creamy. pretty drinkable considering its 8.5% ABV. definitely a classic in its style."
"Pours a very slightly hazed but bright gold color with a a cap of frothy and prickly white bubbles, great retention and sticky lacing. Scent is light and dances around watery fruit, fresh grain and belgian yeast. Taste brings a touch more umph but still pale... light fresh grains, watery fruit like apple, belgian yeasts that dont overpower. Lighter side of medium bodied, prickly carbonation that doesnt diminish taste, slightly dry. Very very good stuff, could be drank all day with no regrets."
"Got another bottle from a different store (and pulled it from the back of the shelf where it was out of the light). Best by 14/02/13. Appearance and feel are the same. A little skunk in the nose and taste but not as much as I remember from last time and it fades almost completely. This is totally different from last time. The sourness is gone, it's a much nicer rounded Belgian Pale Ale... light honey, warm cinnamon and clove, a little citrus hop. Similar to before in substance, but overall much nicer this time around. Changed as follows. Smell: 3.0 to 4.0, Taste: 3.0 to 4.5, Drink: 3.5 to 4.0."
"Definitely drinkable year round and may become a new bar favorite. Pace yourself because this is almost too easy to drink. I would have another for sure, I'm super satisfied with the purchase."
"D= Invites you for more, but be careful with an 8.5% alcohol. It is wonderful."
"D - The flavour and mouthfeel combine to give this beer very good drinkability. Quite enjoyable and satisfying."
"This is the definitive beer of the style...very drinkable, straight forward and delicious. It's really impressive how drinkable this beer is for how heavy and high in alcohol it is."
"Part of me wanted to deny it this, if only to say that I still hadn't rated anything a perfect 5. But honestly, with this bottle and at this moment, it was flawless perfection. At one point in my developmental craft-beer stages, Belgian Strong Pales were some of my least favorite beers, or at least so I proclaimed. Now, however, one sits perched atop my overall rankings ladder in a seat no other can lay claim to. What changes a couple of years can bring."
"All in all an assertive BSPA with tons of flavor. Sadly it was a bit too sweet and spicy for my tastes, but for that reason I can understand why most other people would enjoy it."
"Drinkability is very good. The alcohol, while present, is never overpowering and serves to complement the rest of the flavor profile. A sipper to be sure, but it's quite tasty and you'll definitely enjoy drinking it. Crisp and refreshing, a fine example of craft brew."
"Overall: One of the most outstanding beers on the market."
"Drink - A top notch brew. This will be become a staple in my beer fridge. It may be the perfect all around beer."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Clean and dry and full flavored and it goes down so good. It hides the rather high alcohol very well."
"Each sip hits the tongue more velvety than the next with the perfect amount or carbonation, and despite the strength of this beer it's deceivingly quaffable. A great brew!"
"Cheers!"
" This is where the ""Devil"" comes into play with ya.So tasty but dry so you what more to quench that spot, Alcohol seems non-existant so you just keep pounding 'em down, Great Brew!!!!"
"D: This beer is so damn good, but its so alcoholic that its damn near impossible to stay sober after having more than 2 or 3."
"D: Very easy to sip. Much lighter than the bold full taste suggests."
"D: Drinkably smooth but still interesting. The alcohol is detectable. Not the *very* best BSPA I've ever reviewed (that honour goes to Unibroue's Don de Dieu) but Duvel is a better example of the style (indeed, probably the epitome of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale). Highly recommended; I will buy it again."
"D: Must drink again. Must drink again. Must drink again."
"D: out of this world. I could easily sip one of these over the course of a couple hours or chug it in minutes-it's that good"
"D: One of the classics. Everyone should try this beer. Even my non-craft drinking friends admit this beer is good. I could drink this again and again."
"I do love the Duvel with earthy soft cheeses, lamb, salads of almost any variety, and even grilled foods like hamburgers and shish-kabob. But mostly, I enjoy the Duvel, outside, when its hot, and I need to be confidently impressed."
"After the rare beers I've had from all over the place, it's refreshing to taste such a stunning beer that almost everyone can get. Rarity be damned, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. An absolute classic."
"Drinkability - I could drink just this all night. Doesn't sit heavy or get boring."
"Hmmm....the champagne of beers."
"This beer is very drinkable. In a single glass, each sip goes down well. It also works over a longer session--I'll finish off this 750ml bottle myself without issue. Duvel is worthy of the praise it receives and worth seeking out."
"This is one of my new favorites. Extremely good flavor, well balanced between the Belgian yeast/floral, slightly fruity hops/cracker-like malt that shows a little sweetness. This is a Devilish brew indeed. Partake with caution. It'll get you in trouble if you aren't careful."
"Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated and dry. Drinkability is very good and could be sessionsble but for the ABV."
"Easy-ish to drink for the abv but pretty dry"
"The definition of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Surprised I hadn't reviewed it already."
"D-Fairly high alcohol content and extreme taste makes me only want one. Very tasty but wouldn't want to drink several in one sitting."
"Notes: An outstanding beer. Should be revered by all as the archetypal Belgain Strong Pale Ale."
"D: in my mind this is a prototype for the style, and while not my favorite, it is very good."
"The 8.5% ABV is quite well hidden. The refreshing aspect of this beer makes it a highly attractive option in the summer months, especially as an apperitif in place of a sparkling wine at a dinner. The only hit against this beer is that its glowing reputation may have inflated my expectations, but I learned to appeciated its slightly muted merits."
"If money is no object, then drink up!"
"After seeing the video on the Morgaat website, I realized that I had never tried this remarkable brew. Amazing clear golden color with a big white bubbly head. Lots and lots of carbonation. Amazingly clear. Pleasant aroma. Flavor is sweet, malty and very well balanced. Super crisp finish. The alcohol is incfredibly well masked. Superbe!"
"D- Ummm, yeah, this is a dangerous beer. Very drinkable. found myself gulping it, and at 8.5%, i could see myself getting into trouble. The ABV is hidden very well. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"D: Awesome beer from top to bottom. Had this one about a year ago and didn't think much. After a year of developing my taste, this one is a true great. Carbonation limits the drinkability a bit."
"You cant go wrong with this one."
"A very light golden colored and smooth Belgian ale. Pours a big puffy white head with lacing that remains on the glass. There is steady carbonation without being overbearing. Has a sweet, dry taste with an even finish. Very pleasant and refreshing beer that pairs well with a meal."
"Drinkability- a very drinkable beer that goes down easy and smooth."
"I was disappointed by this beer after looking at the strong reviews. so those reviews may have had an impact on my rating"
"D - This is a benchmark beer for a reason, it's absolutely delicious and drinkable. Also, it truly is one of the prettiest beers to look at, especially in the correct glass. World-class!"
"M/D: Light bodied and extremely drinkable. A really good beer, something that would be a great with food. The 8.5% is slightly evident as it goes down, but it does not bother me one bit. I look forward to drinking another."
"Drinkability: It would make a good session beer if it weren't so damned special!!"
"Overall-An interesting beer that I see myself drinking again. Highly recommended, if for no other reason than to try something different."
"Love this brew. I was surprised by the taste compared to the nose."
"~notes!~ I'm new to this. I stumbled across BA while surfing. I new nothing about beer other than American macros until I went into the Marines. Back then I thought Kirin and San Miguel were fantastic. The Corona Blitz hit but I didn't like it that much but found I did like Dos XX Amber. Ive been trying the higher rated beers I've found on this site and have been pretty much in agreement; Except for Porters...I just don't like them."
"This was my first Duvel, and I can't believe I ignored it for so long. I think the reason might have been because it was a touch expensive @ 11.2 oz bottle for $4.45. But worth the experience of a good beer. I could sip this all night, (or all day.)"
"I have had Duvel before, but in a pint glass, and it was good. Now having it in a proper snifter, I can say this may be one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Smooth, refreshing, and absolutely delicious. I may be at the beginning of my quest for beer nirvana, but this was a giant step forward."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden."
"The ABV of this is hidden very well making this a very drinkable beer. If you are a fan of the style, this is one of the best beers being produced today."
"notes: This would be good with food because of its high drinkability and abv. Always welcome in my fridge."
"This is a very enjoyable beer, and I can definitely see why this is considered one of the staples of Belgian beers. This is easily something I will look forward to enjoying a few of in the future."
"Great drinking beer; I could make a night of this one, with a nice barbequed chicken sandwich."
"Overall, I'll admit i'm slightly bias. The first time i tried this beer i was living in india at the time, and had nothing but terrible terrible beer for months, until a friend of mine offered me an unassuming glass of pale, yellow beer which i assumed to be either carlsberg or tuborg . . . until it hit my tongue. he said that i had the biggest, most over-the-top, cartoonish double-take after my first sip as my mouth filled with the golden nectar. i wasn't expecting it and was absolutely floored by the depth and complexity. I thought i was looking through rose-colored glasses without having anything decent to compare it to for months, so i was cautious when i went to taste it again back in the states, and was pleasantly surprised when i found it just as heavenly as the first sip. I cannot rave enough about this beer."
"D- This beer is very drinkable and I would reccomend it as a good session beer."
"O: Not what I rememberd, but it is easy to drink. Almost to easy."
"jd"
"The aroma is fruity, and the feel is very smooth, but the finish lacks something, as if the beer goes away without saying goodbye."
"330mL bottle poured into a tulip glass. Gorgeous looking beer, pale golden color with a massive white head, and lots of bubbles. Aroma of yeast, citrus, spices, and a little honey. Taste is sweet, yeasty, and fruity with some mild bitterness. Crisp, dry mouthfeel, a little bit like champagne. Decently drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one of these at once."
"D- Very drinkable, but a little too bland (and expensive) for me."
"I almost cried when I poured this beer out and saw the head. watching the belgian lace alone was worth the price of the bottle. I tipped the glass a few times just so I could see the lace. The smell was wonderful, dry and herbal. It was one of the most delicous beers I have ever tasted. Dry, and even a little bit spicy, but with enough malt to keep the phenolic taste from overpowering. The mouthfeel was exceptional as well, very balanced and satisfying. though at 8.5%, it is not exactly a sesion beer. a thoroughly satisfying beer."
"Overall: Complex and nuanced yet easily approchable. I could drink this on a regular basis. A very well executed classic that I appreciate more with time."
"What can I say about this beer that has not already been said. This is a staple in my refrigerator. It pours a golden color with a head so foamy it looks like clouds dancing on a field of golden sand. Bubbles rise from the bottom to the top until the end. The smell and taste are nearly identical and are both very enjoyable. I pretty much enjoy everything there is about this beer and would recommend anyone and everyone to give it a shot!"
"D: duvel drank very good and has been a go to beer when there is not a big variety of beer at certain liquor stores but has always been a tasty beer for me."
"D: An outstanding beer. The gift packs with the glass are quite a good deal, too."
"D- Great beer, and a sipper to drink over a period. Don't know if I would want to put another one down though."
"D: I like this offering, but it does have a bit of a kick. Don't see me drinking these all night, mind you, but very enjoyable after dinner, or by the pool."
"D - Devilish. I was never a big fan of Belgian brews until I started trying the ones that weren't Trappist ales, and Duvel is a whole 'nother ballgame. If someone claims that Belgians are too sweet and candy-like, tell them to try Duvel."
" L1921 0643"
"Pours a beautiful light gold with a one of a kind, thick and frothy white head, most of which will be at the end of your glass upon completion. A decent aroma, light wheat, apple and alcohol notes. The taste is exceptional. Very crisp and refreshing. Lemon, wheat, grain and apple combine perfectly. Semi sweet up front followed up by a bit of bitter hops and dryness to end. Highly carbonated, but this adds to the crisp nature of the beer."
"O: A buy again; a recommend. Pricey, but it is high in alcohol. {11.2 oz was ~$3.50} Not as heavy and more carbonated than other golden ales."
"Drinkability: A classic light and funky Belgian beer that hides the alcohol well. I could have several of these. Very pleasant to drink and complex. One of the best in the style and worth the money, I could have several."
"D - This is one of the best beers I have ever had. I have tried other beers in this same style but this is by far the best of the bunch. A remarkable beer that I will come back to for life."
"D- fantastic, I could drink these all the time"
"The beer pours a radiant straw yellow, with a massive, frothy white cap. The head leaves tons of lacing, and ten minutes after the fact it's still 2+ fingers high. Damn impressive. The nose is of pale malt sweetness and spicy flavors from the yeast, and it's very good but it's not quite worthy of a perfect score. Each sip leads off with some juicy sweetness, apples and pears. A flash of white pepper-led spicy flavors follows, before closing with an aggressive hop bite. Served cold Duvel is quite crisp, but as it warms up the mouthfeel becomes a bit more chewy and lets the various flavors linger around a little bit longer. Either way, it's delicious, and the high yet creamy carbonation ties everything together nicely. Every part of this beer fits together and integrated itself so nicely that Duvel is a pleasure to drink, my biggest challenge was keeping some in the glass long enough to type up this review."
"Drinkability- It's delicious, and I feel honored to have tried one of the best beers in the world; however, it's not something I'd make a session out of. One or two are quite satisfying enough."
"Poured into a branded chalice. It looks pretty much exactly like the picture on the bottle. Head goes all the way up to the top of the glass. Once it dissipates some, it leaves tons of lacing and has a nice layer of head left on top of the beer. It smells of Belgian yeast and a nice fruity smell almost of apple juice. Some hop bitterness in the flavour to go along with the yeast flavour. Fairly smooth."
"I've had this one so many times I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it. Poured from a 330ml bottle into, what else, a Duvel tulip, the glass adds a wonderful effect to the beer allowing it to showcase its four finger head and the tornado bubble gimmick doesn't hurt either. Smell is yeasty and spicy. Taste has tropical fruit up front followed by alcohol presence and a peppery spice character following. Mouthfeel is smooth but slightly watery with a semi-dry finish. Highly drinkable, not hard to finish. Always a staple for me."
"This beer is most definitely one that I'll be coming back to and I can see why it is held in such high regard."
"It pours a dark golden color with so damn much foam and carbonation it takes several tries to fully empty the bottle into my Perfect Pour glass. The aroma is fruity and floral and has citrus as well. When I took a gulp it had those characteristics but seemed to have a slightly stale feel to it, kinda hard to put into words. It was fantastically smooth and clean finishing. If it didn't have that odd twinge to the taste it would have received a five. The label says it is good for another two years, I don't know. I'm not sure if this is a repeat buy for almost five dollars a pop. Maybe I'll retry down the road."
"Poured a bottle into my Duvel glass, a very strong golden color with a large white frothy head. The head lasted quite some time and all around the glass. Smells a little fruity, some spice. A good scent, not too strong. Tastes good, better as it gets warmer for sure. A nice fruity taste with the light bite a wine may have, a little malt and spice. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall, I really enjoy this and would recommend to anyone. It was recommended to me and I love it. Out of a glass, let it sit a bit after being chilled."
"D- High drinkability. Smooth and refreshing, but it lacks something that makes me want to drink it often. I've had a lot of other beers lately that seem to wish they were this one."
"D: Duvel is good, don't get me wrong, but the price to satisfaction ratio isn't that high. The glass, however, is incredible, and worth the purchase alone."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a two finger pure white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of only subtle fruit. The flavor is of malt, fruit, and subtle alcohol. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew. This was actually my first time trying it believe it or not... I am totally happy it is readily available in my area and that the one I bought came with 3 friends. I will be consuming his friends in the near future."
"Overall: Very good beer that gets better as it warms up. I'm not quite as high on it as some other reviews I've read, but I would definitely recommend trying it."
"If I can say this about any beer, it's this one: brewed masterfully. Practically perfect in every way."
"Had a Mikasa Tulip glass just waiting for an opportunity to shake hands with a Duvel. Started with approx 3.5 inched of fluffy foam in the glass but no problem getting a sip through.It was a hazy pale yellow in the glass. I purchased this at the EMart in Seoul and it showed an expiration date of Nov 2012. Nice taste and mouthfeel. I did not get overtaken by the purported 8.5% ABV but maybe it will catch me later. A lttle fruity maybe pears and citrus. I am not great at identifying the flavours: I can just tell you if they don't taste right. I look forward to trying this again. For me, however, I could use more hoppiness. Cheers."
"D- Goes down easy, inoffensive"
"Too expensive and rough to get through to rate any better on the drinkability scale."
"Overall: This is a wonderful beer to try. If you haven't, do it."
"It's Duvel, we pretty much all know what to expect, good beer, but not something I am ever salivating over..."
"Cheers!"
"D - A solid beer. I am happy that I bought this but would not seek it out in the future."
"Overall: I've experienced a fair amount of inconsistency in this beer over the last couple years and this particular one adds to the puzzle. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it but it's not the same or as good as some other bottles I've had. As mentioned above, reminds me very much of Maredsous in it's yeast character and it also seems a bit sweeter than I remember. Still quite enjoyable and a style all it's own."
"Overall - This is THE benchmark for the style, and it shows. This is the beer that others (of the style) strive to reproduce. The absolute best thing I can say about it is that even with the incredible options that I have here in California, I still buy a bottle of this almost every week. Outstanding."
"WS"
"What can you say? Sometimes the hype is justified. First tried this as a poor college kid wandering Europe, not sure how I got my hands on it then but it was a revelation. This beer is the equivalent of a Bordeaux first-growth, a Chateau Margaux of the beer world. In other words, one of the world's great beers. And you can try it for the price of a sandwich."
"Drinkability: Absolutely. I could easily polish off a couple of these (not that I'd want to or should with that 8.5% ABV). I've never come across a beer with this high volume that drinks so well."
"Edit: I recently had it while out and was less blown away by it. Oh well, next time I get the chance to review it I will do so and see if I want to change any scores."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper. It's too complex to just gulp down. It demands the drinker to take his time and try to pick everything apart. I enjoy doing that, so this is a definite winner."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is pilsner malt with some lemon citrus and grassy and spicy hops. The flavor is lemon and oranges with low to medium bitterness, spicy hops and pilsner malt. The beer is very dry. Medium to high carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"Duvel poured a yellow color, with a very good sized head. It smelt like typical beer, but strong. It had a very strong hops, and overall beer tast. It was easy to drink, and you would want another afterwards. Overall a very good beer, one that you will never get sick of."
"Yeah, this is good. Maybe not earth-shattering, but it's expertly balanced and a steal at $3.99!"
"Pours a crisp, light golden color, with a huge, fluffy white head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, apples, pears. On the palate, this one is very complex, light and refreshing, yet strong and flavorful at the same time. Some peppery spiciness, more apples/pears and some sweet malt. It's easy to see why this one spawned a style of its own."
"d- one of those dangerously drinkable beers. smooth ass hell with an 8.5abv that is no where to be found. not to mention it's very tasty."
"Notes: For my liking it is nothing spectacular, but I think it has to do more so with my feel towards Belgian Strong Pale Ales for which I am not particularly passionate. Having said that this remains top quality and reliable, and I have never seen a complaint trying to reach my lips when having this one."
"Medium body, tending towards thinness. Easy drinker."
"D: Complex with no downsides. But be careful, a couple bottles and you'll be sailing."
"This is a fairly potent brew that looks innocent enough, but is really a wolf in sheep's clothing."
"Drinkability: 4.5"
"overall: extremely well made world class beer they invented the style and they do a damn fine job brewing this, I have never had a bad bottle of this nectar of the gods."
"This was one of my first ventures into the world of real beer, and it is still one of my very favorites. It is absolutely lovely in a glass, with a virtually perfect head. The color is so appealing that you want to take some time appreciating it. The aroma is a bit sweet and citrus-like, as is the flavor. The mouthfeel is among the best out there; rich and inviting. The aftertaste is sweet and pleasant - never detracting from the overall effect."
"While the taste doesn't bowl me over as much as the ""heavier"" Belgians, the drinkability is off the charts. Light, crisp, and packs a punch while keeping you coming back for more."
"Drinkability: I'd drink these all day if it had a lower alcohol content. Delicious, but not perfect - by the end of a 750 you will get used to the amazing flavor this beer has."
"A beer that is a ""must have on hand"" all year round."
" The taste is very dry and the carbonation scrubs the pallet. The ale has a nice balance of hop bite with peach and pear bready yeast flavor. The alcohol burn is chased away quickly leaving very little aftertaste. This delicate Belgian is how champagne should taste. A thin body appears even thinner through all of the carbonation making it an easy drinker. You will not find many beers that come in this strong that are this easy to drink."
"D - Everything about this beer seemed just so delicate, I thought it was very simple in both taste & smell, which was nice. The drinkability has gotta be pretty damn high on this one, as It tasted like 7% around room temp! I'm not big on the style but I'd have this one again sometime. Definitely recommended. Cheers!"
"It's dry. leaves me wanting more to quench my thirst yet no amount satisfies. This is a style of beer that i can respect but don't favor all that much."
"will try again."
"Finally had this. I think I prefer Russian Rivers 'golden ale' which is called 'Damnation' and it compares nicely to this one. The duvel is VERY SMOOTH espeically considering the high ABV. Its not really complicated. Very easy to drink which is impressive considering its over 8%. Not one of my top 10 beers because its a little to boring especially for a potent brew."
"This is the measuring bar with which all other Belgian strong pale ales and golden ales try to compete. And it is highly regarded with good reason. It is quite delicious, and a feat of excellence to balance a beer so nicely with that high an ABV."
"Pours a light, pure golden color. Produces a foamy white head that never completely dissipates and leaves lots of lacing. Smell is the quintessential Belgian yeast tones. Taste is again yeasty and finishes with some fruity notes. As it warms flavors become more pronounced and even more appealing. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Drinkability is superb with this one. I was actually surprised to find the abv clocked in at 8.5%. Ive been growing a distaste for Belgian styles; however, this experience has me completely rethinking the style entirely, that's how good it is."
"Drinkability is very high even with the 8.5 ABV. Must be careful. Good summertime beer."
"I first drank this beer a few months ago and wasn't really impressed. However I thought I'd give it another go for the sake of the positive reviews it's had here (and the fantastic glass!) Once again I don't think it lives up to the hype. Personal preference in this style of beer would be Kwak over this anyday."
"A good Belgian beer."
"Silky carbonation, light to medium body. Overall a nice example of Belgian beer; A great showcase of the various flavors and aromas a good Belgian yeast offers."
"With so much going on at 8.5% abv, this has a surprisingly lighter feel than one would expect. Quite a strong carbonation seems to be a bit too much. Overall Duvel sets a high standard for the style and certainly one that shouldn't be missed."
"one of my all-time favorites, a true world classic. It's quite clear, golden, and full of foamy white head that's leaves the tell-tale Belgian lace. Aroma of spice from the yeast, tiny hint of hops and light fruit, maybe apples. The taste - it's almost impossible to describe the relative complexity (for such a light beer), but of course, I'll try. Peppery sweetness initially, it mellows in the middle to a yeasty fruity balance, and finishes a little dryer than one would expect with the perfect amount of hop bitterness and flavor. You would never know that this packs a whopping 8.5%. Truly, a masterful and artful blending of all things that mark great brewing."
"This beer's drinkability is probably too high actually, because at 8.5% ABV, one could end up on the wrong side of intoxicated in a hurry. Highly recommend this one for any serious beer lover."
"Wow... finally getting around to trying this. Pours a brilliant pale gold, with lively carbonation - and crystal clear (managed to keep the yeast sediment in the bottle). The cloud-white head is pretty massive and leaves a few patches of lace on the glass. Carbonation keeps a steady stream of small bubbles rising up from the bottom. There's a nice ring of foam that manages to stick around after most of the head dissipates. Aroma is of fruit (apple/pear), spice and yeast. Taste is so clean... again, there's a touch of pear, followed by pepper and a light touch of grain and some sweetness. Alcohol and/or medicinal notes peek through. Mouthfeel is crisp, lively and pretty light on the palate. Drinkability is exceptional - it's almost impossible to put the glass down. Hard to believe we're talking 8.5% here - completely unnoticeable. Delicious..."
"Overall an outstanding beer that will knock you on your ass if you don't respect it. A true classic."
"D - A wonderful beer that tricks you into thinking it's straight forward and dull but in reality, it's complex and wonderful. The alcohol is hidden so well that there's no way I'd guess it's 8.5%. Recommend."
"D: not sure if i could drink more than say...two of these, but that could just be because I don't particularly care for this style."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus glass. A slow pour resulted in a two fingers worth of pristine pillowy white head. The head lingered for a while and left some impression lacing. The aroma is predominately a sweet sugary smell. There are some malts notes in the nose, but not much in terms of hops. The taste has a crisp balance. I was afraid of an overpowering sweetness, but it wasn't to be found. The light malt character, subtle hops on the finish, and perfect carbonation makes this a great Belgium beer. I am not the biggest Belgium fan, but this is one I plan on revisiting."
"This may be one of the times I'm not noticing just how good this is because it's so available."
"48/50 -- Deserves every bit of praise it gets as a world-class beer. Cheers!"
"I never regret having one of these. World class."
"In terms of Belgian Ales, this ranks right up with the best of them. And while I may not put the type in my favorites list, I can definitely appreciate it for what it's worth."
"While not an extremely drinkable beer due to the carbonation the taste keeps me coming back for more."
"I've heard the hype. I have friends studying abroad in Belgium who drink this like its water, and now I know why. Belgians aren't my favorite type of beers, but this is the best of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale category and the best Belgian I've had period. Truly complex and packed with tons of flavor and good-looks, this beer remains so drinkable that I'm almost done with the bomber after pouring it only ~ten minutes ago. The only downside is the alcohol, which I'm starting to feel. Still, this is the highest rating I've given out to a beer to date, and it blows my mind that it goes to a Belgian. But Duvel certainly deserves it."
"8.5 alcohol, but you wouldn't know it -- the mouthfeel is a bit thin and too bubbly for me, but it makes the brew easier to drink. Awesome drinkability and overall an outstanding, world-class beer."
"it's a great beer on all points."
"This is a beer that can fool the masses. Easy to drink, tasty, and inoffensive, this is the quintessential everybody beer. Only one other big beer (Aventinus) has the same type of mass appeal to those who are typically scared of beer that you can taste. This was one of the first 'amazing' beers I ever had, and it was a life changing experience. And now, after having drunk this numerous times, I finally get around to reviewing."
"edit: I am re-reviewing after tasting a second, far more impressive bottle."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, thanks to the generous carbonation. An absolute joy to drink."
"Incredible taste, some hops, some malt, plenty of bready yeast flavor. This is my first Duvel and was not at all disappointed. This is just an incredibly balanced beer leaving you wanting nothing more."
"A good Belgian beer. Reminds me of Golden Monkey without the hints of mandarin oranges. I should have gave Golden Monkey a higher score."
"D Very smooth, carbonation is excellent, great beer anytime of year, but I love it in the spring/summer sitting outdoors at cafe or in the garden"
"D - While the carbonation makes this great to look at and fun to drink, it also makes it pretty filling. Given that, one is enough; I'd prefer less carbonation if I wanted a second. At the same time, the alcohol is incredibly well hidden in flavor, and the light mouthfeel just reinforces it."
"D : Although it is a high ABV (8%) it can lose points... But this beer is so enjoyable that I could easily drink many of those (not on the same night though). I will always some back to this one, as it is one of my favorites!"
"d - A decent belgian that is readily available in grocery stores. I would agree with others that this could be a good gateway beer for people looking to get into Belgians, but I don't think it is as good as some others I've had. Thought the high carbonation hurt it a little bit, but still a nice beer that I'd have again."
"Clear gold, ridiculously huge white head. Took almost ten minutes to get the head to settle enough. Aroma of yeast, bread and touch of banana and spice. Little sweet followed by funky Belgian yeast finish. Little lingering bitterness. A very solid Belgian golden, but just not really my thing."
"Mouth - smoothe and biting, a great summer beer. I may have found a new favorite. As the danes say ""Skol!"""
"before. Great beer and worth every penny especially if you can find the gift pack with a free glass."
"D: Only downside to the beer, you could get drunk rather quickly off of these."
" A classic."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Bold with big time ale roundness juxtaposed with crisp quinine-like freshness. Alcohol is well integrated. Flavors of orange and spices like coriander are generous and there is also a subtle note of lemon verbena. Finishes dry and somewhat grainy."
"Drinkability - you would be silly to have more than a few of these and the price is a little prohibitive as well. Still an enjoyable offering and worth a try."
"Overall Impression: It's a CLASSIC Belgian Pale Ale. Need I say more?"
"Overall: Mouth feel is bright, light, and crisp. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish medium full.This is a really good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed drinking. The flavors were just wonderful and put together."
"The taste is fruity, reminding me of bananas and fresh red apple in addition to a spicy blend of flavors that adds a bit of heat to this. That flavor may also be the yeast, which also adds a kind of bread like funk to the whole thing...something like sourdough. Also I'm reminded of raspberries for some reason. Overall the mouth feel is crisp and not too watery with a consistency something like a wheat beer. Very good, but not as mind blowing the second or third time, but still very well done."
"D: Exceptionally easy to drink, my glass empties quickly. This is a beer that lives up to its reputation. Try it if you haven't!"
"Poured into the signature Duvel tulip a golden yellow with a massive creamy/frothy/awesome head. It seems to stall in time and retain better than any other beer head. It is of white color and leaves blankets of thick lacing. I have never seen one centimeter lacing before this beer. Smell is mostly Belgian yeast and breadiness to me. A good amount of citrus, probably from hops comes through in the nose also. The standard dark fruits gets into the mix too. Taste is a great balance of flavors. I get a lot of yeast/breadiness. The dark fruit and belgian typical spices are nice. There is a citrus peel hoppy bitterness aspect that I really like. These are greatly balanced to almost perfection. A really nice laid-back belgian strong pale. Moderate body and carbonation suit the flavor balance well. The beer coats the tongue with the citrus peel bitterness. A tiny bit of warmth feels good also. I could session this and the 8.5% ABV is hidden amazingly. This is definitely one of the better Belgian beers I have had. The price is a bit much for me right now but I understand why it is that way. The citrus bitterness might get to me after a few of these, good beer worth trying."
"Simply a fantastic beer. Well crafted doesn't do this one justice. Everything from the sturdy bottle, to the well made duvel tulip, to the carbonation & clarity of the beer, and to the amazing taste has been well thought out and executed. One of my favorite aspects of this is the appearance of the beer, which isn't at all indicative of the flavors contained therein. Tasting provides flavors of Belgian pilsner malt, the Saaz hops, and the unique tart/pear-like flavor that comes from the yeast strain used. Just a hint of alcohol lets you know that this is a serious beer, but is so well blended that it is hardly noticeable. Completely refreshing, could be had at any time of the year. Definitely a must try if you haven't ever picked this one up."
"D: An awesome beer that I'll always look forward to having."
"Excellent brew!"
"D - Soooo well balanced."
"D - incredibly drinkable"
"D/O- I really enjoy a good pilsener, whether it be German or Czech, so this is probably my ideal beer. Add into that the traits of the Belgian yeast and I'm a happy imbiber. Bottom-line: This is just a great beer, easy to find, and reasonably priced. There's a reason this brew gets so many great reviews; it delivers on all aspects of what a world renowned beer should have. I've been drinking this gem for years and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Get it in ya. Cheers."
"This is a beautiful beer to look at. Great color, wonderful head and lacing. However, I found it a bit lacking in other categories. The bouquet is extremely subtle. The taste was full and alcoholic, both good things in my book, but doesn't last. The mouthfeel was okay. I would have liked a little more carbonation. Nevertheless, it is a very easy, drinkable beer. But, for me, not one I would go out of my way for."
"Its is a bit spendy for my budget, but when i get the craving for Duvel, nothing can satisfy me but Duvel."
"A heavy blonde beer you can find everywhere in Belgium or in France. Classical smell fot that kind of beer. In fact I must admit that subtlety is not his first quality. In my opinion it is has a conventional aspect. Okay to drink but overestimated in my opinion."
"D: this stuff is so good i would drink it anytime,"
"[T, M, D]: As said earlier, this beer is very carbonated, as well as dry and tasty. Definately a beer worth the $7. It is now a member of my beer hall of fame."
"Duvel is a staple, a classic, a treasure."
"(D)- A superb example of the style as well as a great beer overall. Defines the style. Crisp & refreshing. I could have one after another if this wasnt 8.5%abv. A superb beer that I always enjoy as long as I dont get a bad one (which happens often)."
"Drinkability: I find I can't drink more than 2 Duvels. Though that being said, both go down very very well."
"D: This is a very nice and complex beer, BUT it's much stronger than you think. It goes down almost to easy - be aware!"
"D: As a starter, I'm not that impressed, but once I've had one, I could probably easily kick back a few more. Goes down real smooth."
"I saw the glass and four pack for sale at the Jasper Liquor Store and I had to have it. The glass is large and beautiful, much like the beer. It's bright golden, with the stylized etched 'D' on the bottom of the glass providing a constant stream of bubbles to feed to the bright white, monsterous, chunky, clinging head. The nose is floral hops mingled with bready malt and yeast with light spices poking through. On the tongue you get an extremely well balanced beer. Bready malt, banana, yeasty, sweet, light spices poking at the tongue, all while the hops whisper sweet nothings to your uvula. This effervescent beer is deceptively drinkable for 8.5%. The whole four pack would have been gone if I wasn't so careful."
"A very rewarding beer, especially with cheese."
"When I think of all the beers I know that are behind this on BA ratings list, it pains me."
"Way too easy to go back for more."
"Very strong beer so be careful!!"
"Pleasantly surprised to find this offered at the Poolesville Country Store restaurant in Poolesville, NY near Colgate University. Poured nice and cold from the bottle into the big tulip glass this one shows a clear gold color with a one finger unshakeable white head and very good lace. The aroma is fruity clove and bright citrus bread. The first mouthful gives a mid-plus bodied and smooth feel with lots of lively carbonation. The tastebuds detect banana and sweet melon, clove and anisette. Full, sweet, and pretty drinkable. A more than pleasant experience that I want to repeat!"
"Very easy drinker - could pop down a sixer of this if it wasn't so damn alcoholic - no point on wasting this by drinking while not sober enough to enjoy it. All in all, probably one of the best beers in the world and most likely its style. Despite it being widely available, it does not disappoint. Top notch beer."
"Bottle pours golden color with white head. Aroma is fruity, yeasty, and spicy. Tingly mouthfeel. Flavor follows the nose and is real fruity, has lots of yeast in it, and has a nice white pepper spice to it. Finishes semi dry. Nice solid brew. This is exactly what I thought it would be."
"To me it's a ridiculously deceptive chillout brew: pop open the stubby size bottles and next thing you know you've lost count. While it definitely does the job, I expected more of an edge."
"Absolutely beautiful beer. Hazy, golden yellow with a classic dense thick white head. A full inch and a quarter over the rim of the glass without any spill. Duvel has a very pronounced, fruity aroma, lemons and pears. The first bottle I had, I did not realize that there was some yeast in the bottle (although I love the yeast). The beer is very refreshing, and very fruity. Somewhat dry finish, very pleasant."
"I really didn't think I liked Belgian style beers... this beer is certainly causing me to rethink that position!"
"Duvel pours a very slightly hazy light golden yellow with a thick, fluffy head that sticks around. The aroma is sweet pale malt with tons of fruity esters, maybe some pear. The flavor is crisp, the fruitiness alludes to sweetness, but the beer finishes dry. Tons of flavors from the yeast. There is some bitterness in the finish, but it is just enough to balance the light, fruity malt. A bit of herbal hop flavor lingers in the smooth finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very good tasting and easy drinking beer. Overall an excellent example of it's style and a delicious beer at that."
"Overall impression: Incredible beer, and one of my absolute favorites. Every beer drinker needs to give Duvel a try."
"I have had this beer twice before and was honestly never impressed,never got the hype. but this time i was majorly wowed, big time. Glad i gave the Devil another chance!"
"I love how this beer looks. It pours golden with thick head. The head continues to linger throughout and sticks to the glass. This is one of the greatest Belgian style ales that I've had. It has some great flavor but is very easy to drink. I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall one of the best beers you will drink and so easily attainable. Good job Duvel."
"Beautiful lacing on the glass. Like figures in a tapestry."
"Pours a golden yellow with big fluffy white head that lingers long in the glass. I initially get some pear or apple in the nose, but also a yeasty alcohol lingers. Slightest hint of hoppy bitterness, but overall this is a smooth and light bodied beaut. Hints of malt and alcohol, but finishes with a bit of citrus fruit. Everything balances quite well, not overly bitter, or fruity, etc - just a nice enjoyable drink."
"Notes: This is a very clean beer. Cheers."
"Notes: Really nice beer. It has a number of flavors, at times it reminds me of a really good pilsner, at other times a good KÃ¶lsch, and at others a light tripel. Just a very refreshing, easy to drink, and tasty beer."
"Very balanced. There's a slight warm alcohol splash somewhere in the middle of each sip, but its kicked off the palate quickly with some hop bitterness and more of that yeasty spiciness. Almost too drinkable for a beer of this ABV."
"A very easy drinker for the high alcohol content. This is a very exciting and intriguing drink."
"D: One of the best. Delicious, looks great, smells awesome, can drink a ton of it."
"Drinkability - very drinkable"
"Straw Yellow with a huge fluffy white head. Aroma of fruity Belgium ale yeast, bready malt and grassy hops. Smooth natural carbonation and hybrid flavour of clean pilsner malts and ale yeast fruitiness. Complex malt, sugar and gentle hops profile with well disguised alcoholic strength. A definite winner in my book."
" I'll be drinking this one again and again."
"I have to say that considering all the rave reviews for this beer, I was expecting a better experience. The first time I tried this beer, I thought it was good, but not mind blowing. I continued to read reviews of this beer and they were all sterling. So I figured maybe I got an old batch of beer or something. Tried it again last night and I think the beer is a good beer, but it is not the holy grail of beer that many make it out to be. This is a good tasting beer, highly carbonated and virtually no aftertaste, but there are beers I've tried where I had a much better experience with."
"Duvel is a classic beer. I've loved it for years, having tried it early on in my foray into craft beer. No matter how much my palate develops, Duvel keeps delivering new and delicious flavors with every sip. World class."
"D - High. Great cross over for the Bud drinker who doesn't think beer can be anything else. This is a winner for sure. Maybe not as venerable as its usually portrayed - but still world class and unlike anything else."
"Delicious...this brew is always a great idea. In spite of the abv, I could easily session this like a mo-fo..."
"D - Very sessionable, could go through a few pints quite happily."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. But of course, you knew that already."
"D-this is super tasty, like drinking a dry champaign only better. a little sweeter without the huge carbonation (although there is a lot) that a champaign would bring. really happy with this and this is another beer that makes me want to enjoy belgians!"
"By far one of the most ""dangerous"" beers I've had. High gravity and superbly drinkable. A lovely golden color invites you in. The bouquet draws you nearer still. And then in a flash, the Devil's got you. You resist pounding this extremely drinkiable beer, knowing the potential consequences. But the pull is just too much to bear. Before you know it you're on number 4, and by then...it's too late."
"Fuck Highlife, this is the champagne of beers."
"D: Fairly sessionable, but it will catch up with you quickly."
"It's really hard for me not to pour all my beer knto the glass, but someday, I'll sample this again, and try to leave the yeast in the bottle."
"D- Well I am a novice when it comes to golden ales of this caliber and I would say I enjoyed drinking this brew but I think it could of done better masking the 8.5% ABV. I couldn't seem myself having more then one or two of these before I got sick of it or from it."
"D: Excellent, based on the overall lightness of the mouthfeel, the full flavor, and the clean finish. I could certainly have a couple of these. The abv is sneaky, though. I certainly felt the 8.5% by the end of my tasting."
"What else is there to say about Duvel? It's just about the most perfect beer on the market. It pours with an instantaneous, thick white head over a golden body. The aroma is distinct and smells of flowers, wheat and subtle hops; the flavor is smooth with notes of wheat, honey, and hops. The overriding distinction of this beer, though, is that there is no way to tell that it is 8.5% until you've finished the bottle! It is warming, smooth, pleasurable beer that I will enjoy again!"
"One of the best visually appealing ales I have ever seen/drank. This is the last of my 4 pack and the first time I have tried it before. It is a little spendy for what it is in my opinion. A must try if you have not have it before. Worthy of the hype I have heard. Possibly a perfect ""beer"" for a non beer connoisseur."
"Clean, crisp, golden, boozy, awesome. Everyone's going to rant and rave about how good it is, so my accolades won't add anything here. Instead I'll play the role of the French judge at every olympic contest. The ethanol profile is a tad like nail polish remover. The malt profile is a bit boring. But all in all, impossible to argue against it's being a contender for the podium. We all know this event will end with the Belgian national anthem, but the question remains; ""which Belgian?""."
"I appreciate it as a refreshing beer during the summer months, but for me personally it's over carbonated. That being said, it's still a more than worthy interpretation of the style."
"Overall: fantastic beer. One of the top ten beers of the world."
"O: I prefer the beer with the yeast mixed in. I have had Belgian-style brews that I have enjoyed quite a bit more for the money; this is a solid beer, even so, I have yet to be a fan of Belgian-style Pale Ales. Serve this one at a higher temperature (55 degrees F) in order to get the most flavor out of it as possible."
"Overall- very clean and drinkable. not very unique except for fruitiness."
"The duvel has a refreshingly light-medium velvet-like body with tremendous carbonation which in no small way make this a deceivingly drinkable big Belgian beer!"
"D â This beer is a masterpiece. Especially if poured properly, in the right ware."
"Drinkability - Ok consumption, nice ale, would have again."
"Poured from a stubby little brown bottle into an oversized wine glass. Poured slightly cloudy that looked wavy and actually really freakin cool(poured it wrong?) Large fluff/foamy brilliant white head that didnt last all that long but looked great. Was hard for me to get the aroma, light fruit, grape? Tasted slight alchohol, white grapes, like a good champagne to me. Lots of carbonation and light feel that gets slighty heavier and warming and dry at the end. I tend to compare this too delirium tremens, very similar however crisper and less fruit flavor going on here. I feel like you could pour this as an alternative to a good champagne and most wouldnt know the difference. Definitely a drinkable beer but the ABV would keep me having only a few spaced out. Ill most likely get the proper duvel glassware and get this again."
"Poured to a two fingered head that had lots of big bubbles. Head was white in color and brew itself was hazy golden. Not a lot of lacing going on. Very light smelling. Just a hint of alcohol and maybe some grain. Had a fruit taste. Maybe apples or pears. Also tasted slightly sweet. Good all around balance. Not bitter by any means. It didnt have any type of aftertaste at all. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I think it would make a good session beer. But you would have to be carfull. Lots of alcohol. Ill buy again."
"It has a good mouthfeel due to its clearness and cleanness. Makes for a super drinkable beer."
"A truly magnificent brew whatever way you like it!"
"* Note if this beer is properly prepared, its color is very clear and not murky. You should have no problem seeing through your glass. So, let it sit for at least 3 days before drinking, and don't pour the yeast into your glass unless you know you like it. It makes a big difference on taste--much drier and smoother, and with a much more pronounced hop flavor without the yeasts floating around. I always let mine sit for a week so the yeasts are settled."
"It's just so crisp and clean. The flavor has a certain je ne sais quoi that is perfectly balanced by the carbonation."
"Mouthfeel - Dry, lots of carbonation, smooth and a very light body."
"The 750l bottle is far superior to the smaller bottles IMO; it has a more rounded and nuttier-bitter hops flavor."
"D: always a pleasure to drink and a must have, top notch drinkability. Great stuff!"
"I think that is the best pale ale in the world."
"Drank out of a snifter and a tulip. Pours into a beautiful huge frothy fizzy white head that seams to last forever. The body is a golden yellow with a very lively active body. Lots of carbonation (make sure your glass is completely clean otherwise you'll see which part you have missed!) The aroma was very pleasant with bread, light grains, and dough on the nose. Taste seems to follow the nose with additions of coriander and a light leafy after taste. I can see what the fuss is. I've always skipped over this beer at the local beer store. I now see it was due to my ignorance that I was missing out on an incredible golden ale."
"D- Drinkable yes, very much. Affordable, lets just say this beer is for special occasions."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were almost perfect. It left a slightly fizzy feeling as it coated the palate. Not harsh at all and was very refreshing sip after sip even when it warmed. Definately one of the best Belgians that I have ever drank!"
"Feels great, lively carbonation and a smooth, slick feel make this a deceptively easy brew to drink. Almost too easy, considering the alcohol content."
"This is a rite of passage into the wonderful world of Belgium beer."
"D - Due to it being low bodied and just amazing, makes this an ideal drinkable beer. It's so drinkable that I would say it's borderline dangerous because of the alcohol level. I'd definitely advise to try to take it easy, although you can definitely get caught up drinking a few of these. I'm going to be guilty of finishing this entire bomber much quicker than I had planned. I'm going to cut this review short now so I can get to finishing the beer!"
"Side Notes: I love this beer, I always have. This is always in my home, as it should be. It deserves the outstanding/world class rating that it has here. Great example of the style."
"The aroma is bready and has a hint of orange hoppiness to it."
"Duvel is a top of the line beer to anyone with nose and palate. When you dive you nose into the generous amount of head you can smell a wonderul world of cloves and banana. In my opinion what makes duvel world class, is the beautiful balance of the two all across your palate from beginning to finnish."
"D - Insanely drinkable for the percent it contains making it a dangerous brew. I could have a few in a row. Fantastic flavor and feel, it is THE perfect example of the style and one of the greatest beers of all time when you don't constantly get skunked or bad bottles. Shoulda' had this at midnight instead of champagne."
"Not my favorite style, but still a very nice beer."
"This is an exceptional beer. It has a nice pale golden hue, that has a seductive glow when put to a light. Duvel has a very nice head, that is just as impressive as its color. The head doesn't stay too long, or too short. Nice lacing occurs, and leaves behind a spiraling foam covered glass edges. A taste of hops, strong flavor, with notes of citrus. The citrus element helps to create a smooth drink, with a crisp and refreshing finish, that lingers a grateful amount of flavor. Carbonated just right, which adds to its crisp taste, without taking away from the overall beer. This beer, has a good amount of AVB, so this really does hit you if you let it it. Also, this is a great beer to have in a Belgian Tulip glass, or in a bottle, but preferably from a glass. Duvel is also great on tap, or course, what beer isn't good on tap. I can go on, this beer was excellent. I recommend this beer, for both a beer selection/collection or to impress your friends."
"D - The most perfect beer I've encountered. Granted, though, you can't have 4 of 'em. Duvel is everything you want in a beer. You should experience it if you get the chance!"
"When you rate a beer you are comparing this offering to the actual specific style and your own personal taste. I think Duvel couldnt look, smell, taste, or possibly be any better. I would take this over a Delirium any day and this beer is a masterpiece in itself."
"Poured the beer from a large pint bottle into a glass. Duvel has a somewhat hazy amber color with a thick snow white head that hangs on forever. Maybe it is because I am inexperienced but I cannot put my finger on the aromas coming off the beer, it definitely is not unpleasant. Wow! this beer tastes great and is well balanced but complex, not to grainy and not to hoppy, with a touch of carbonation. Also, the finish is very smooth, no hoppy or alcohol aftertaste just very very clean. This is the best beer I have ever tasted!! Drinkability is high but this is a beer you do not throw down like you would a Bud Light, but drink slowly and enjoy. Definitely a world class beer! Also, checkout the cool Duvel website."
"Cheers"
"What else can be said about this beer that already has been said? not much, i'm afraid. it's a fantastic brew. extremely well balanced especially for the abv, easy to drink, phenomenal flavor, pretty easy to find, everything about this beer is just excellent. hey, it's one of the best beers for you (out of craft brews) at around 120 calories per serving. i actually liked duvel green (duvel draft) a bit better than white, but i would never pass up a classic duvel."
"A little sweet, medium to low bodied. A slight wheaty aftertaste but its not disturbing. Nice fruit flavors. Drinkability insanely high. I love this beer. Mouthfeel has great connectivity and overall one of the best IMO. I love this beer."
"Pours a very pale gold with an immense amount of lovely pillowy foam. Smells strongly of floral hops with a slight whiff of spicy yeast and a pear like sweetness. Tastes quite dry with hops up front and a medley of fruit undertones that fade in as it warms in your mouth. Crisp apple and pear, as well as some wine-like notes that are enhanced by the alcoholic warmth. Nice dry finish and a pleasant lingering bitterness on the tongue. Crisp and probably too drinkable for this high of an ABV. It is obvious why this beer has so many imitators."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours very light golden, with the infamous Duvel towering white head. Sediment floats about in a strange vapor-like form. Just the head by itself is more complex than most beers, sits on top the whole time, slowly getting all awesome and chunky looking and leaving good lacing. Smell is strong of yeast, lemon, pear. Not a fan of the pilsner malt used, I'm not really a fan of pils in general and gives it the scent a bit of a macro vibe. Tartness hits your mouth right away followed by many tastes, peppery Belgian yeast, apple, white grape, warming alcohol finish. Definitely alot of complexity here. Pretty good mouthfeel, but I have to knock it down to a 3.5. There is a little too much carbonation and alcohol presence for me, but I suppose that is understandable for the style. Feels very heavy too with a very dry finish. I like the complexity and I can understand why people love this beer, maybe I'm not a huge fan of the style. I had Duvel Draft (aka Duvel Green) and preferred that because of the toned down carbonation and alcohol taste."
"Drinkability: I put a two glass limit here simply because of the ABV. I could see myself going through a few 22 oz if I had no where to be."
"Drinkability: Typical Belgian Strong. Not really sure what all the hype is about. I'm not a fan of the style but even so I don't see anything to write home about here."
"Drinkability: This beer is dangerous. I didn't really fall in love with the style or it after drinking it, but other than in the aroma I couldn't mark it down. I mean this is one of the most finely made beers I have ever or probably will ever have. You can not tell its 8.1% until you start feeling it and if the carbonation was a little lighter you would drink it like it was water. I really wish it was lower abv and cheaper so I could session it."
"taste is of pear, a touch of peach, a little sour malt, a little sweetness in the back, and a few hops, end is smooth."
"I think that I will try to retaste this one when I work my way through what the beer elves brought me."
"The head is very abundant and thick. The nose is powerful fresh hops but some also reveal the apple and pear. Beer is cool but it still remains very powerful and sparkling, we also feel a slight tingling pleasant and characteristic of language. And despite the undeniable taste of alcohol mild and dry, it remains mild in flavor and thus easier to digest. Archetype International and mother of all Devil beers, this beer is always pleasant at a terrace."
"Had this many times but finally getting around to reviewing it. Pours a clear light gold with lots of visible carbonation. Huge persistent white head. Very nice earthy yeasty spicy smell. Light malt with fairly low sweetness. A hint of tartness. The main things here are earthy slightly phenolic yeastiness and lots of spiciness. Medium bodied and dry. Very easy to drink. Pretty much the prototypical Belgian strong pale and very good."
"Drinkability- If I did not have a limited supply of this beer I could not stop because of it's sheer drinkability. It is absolutely absurd that a beer this complete, complex (in all aspects of the senses) yet balanced could be created! Astounding!"
"I'm still amazed how they hid the alcohol smell so well even though the ABV is so high"
"Perfection!"
"d- at long last, the highly regarded duvel. not what i was expecting, but i really am enjoying it, for me this isn't an everyday drinking beer, but i can see myself having this again, maybe for say thanksgiving dinner, i think this would pair well with turkey and gravy. very nice"
"D. one of the most drinkable beers ever! over 8% so you have to be careful because i could drink it all day."
"D: this has excellent balance and flavor, the alcohol is very well hidden"
"D: easy to drink for a high abv brew."
" I'm assuming this is a relatively young Duvel as the best buy date is 2.5 years out and this bottle is from a Christmas gift pack so I'm very interested to see how the flavor profile changes in 1 year, 2 years and maybe even 3 years."
"[Drinkability]: An awesome beer!! Highly drinkable."
"A huge head with a ridiculous amount of lace atop a light gold fluid. some carbonation from the nucleation sit on the bottom of the tulip ( Duvel of course ). Smells of sweet malt, breads, apples, pears. Belgian yeast. Taste is light and sweet with a light white wine and nice funk. Dry finish with more malt and bready rolls lingering. An effervescent creaminess in feel that is just perfect. Refreshing and quenching. Alcohol is so well integrated as to be transparent. Drinks like a Belgian lager it's so quaffable."
"D: What a great beer. Aromas and flavours are outstanding and the alcohol is unnoticeable. I'll be picking more of this out very soon."
"750ml pours a clear golden colour on the first pour, and a hazy golden colour on the second duvel glass. Each glass was loaded with foam lacing the glass. The first pour actually formed a marshmallow of foam, interesting. Taste is of very sweet fruits with the slightest of tingles for the abv%. Fairly drinkable overall though, and a decent beverage."
"A masterpiece."
"a classic beer that's very well rounded and a great value"
"20 December 2009"
"Impression: truly one of the finest beers in the world, one I've enjoyed for many years, and the benchmark for simple complexity. This is what beer can be."
"Overall, great beer, try it. Cheers."
"D- I think this is the first beer I've reviewed with a sample from it's namesake glass (such awesome glasses they are!). And a good way to start that trend."
"Overall... well, this is a great beer. It's the quintessential Belgian Strong Pale for a reason. Find it, enjoy it."
"It's interesting that this beer is so fresh, yet so complex. It really makes for a brew that you can relax and channel out with."
"A classic Belgian Pale if there ever was one."
"Long overdue tasting of the quintessential BSPA. I thought it was a solid, drinkable beer. Nothing more, nothing less."
"All in all, this is an excellent beer. I liked it *much* more than I remembered from my previous experience >1yr ago. Small deduction in the T & M for its overly aggressive carbonation (and honestly, this is what I remembered most about my previous glass of Duvel), but this is a very very good beer."
"D. Too drinkable. In the summer heat this beer goes down very easily but beware because it has a very high ABV."
"Pours a very nice light golden color with a tremendously large, thick and chunky head. Smells lightly of belgian spices, lemons, and other sweet citrus fruits. Taste starts off with flavors of sweet citrus fruits, then is complimented by notes of spice and peppar. Some nice yeast qualities are also prevelant with the alcohol that is rather well hidden. The finish is medium in length. A very enjoyable beer on any occasion."
"D- Drinkability suffers from it's intense hops character (which I don't personally care for) and it's strong alcohol content (which I do care for). Best drank one at a time to enjoy it at it's fullest."
"Drinkability: An often overlooked beer for me that I am going to have to start making a regular part of my line up. Very solid and easy drinking, especially at 8.5%."
"D: A pheonomenal beer. A paragon of the style. The price is a bit higher than many craft beers, but I'm willing to pay it for this gem. A definite pearl in the sea of Belgian beers. Irreplaceable. If you haven't tried it, you should."
"D- very drinkable , refreshing, you can have 2 or 3 no problem, awesome beer."
"Overall, I like this in the smaller 11.2 ounce size than big bottle, but its a great drinking experience. I rarely drink this beer, but its always a pleasure. It deserves its spot as one of the world's great beers."
"Drinkability:One of the better benchmark beers out there, this beer is a standard drink for beer fans for good reason. Quite pleasant and memorable."
"a little foamy but overall really nice."
"Drinkability rates high for this gem. A great example of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style. Wonderful."
"D - Pretty easy to get this one down, and at over 8% could make this a great night and painful morning."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This is the quintessential Strong Pale Ale for a reason, and it is fantastic."
"Explodes with carbonation as high as the liquid. Glistening bubbles. Body is straw pale and clear. Nose is lovely boquete of belgian phenols; banana and cloves, melons. Flavor is nice, light marmalade, pilsner body. The finish is where it shines: starts dry, with a soft expanding cloud of phenols through the enhale; leaves a kiss of alcoholic sweetness. The added carbonation really helps with this. Drink too many and you'll be crawling."
"D - Light - yet complex, delicious, and no hint of alcohol. Very similar to Champagne. Worth an occasional revisit."
"Notes: Crisp and delicious. Very refreshing. I've heard this is much like champagne and I couldn't agree more. Great summer beer and would be really excellent paired with just about any food."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Feel wonderful with thick foam. When I drink it, a large number of tiny bubbles make me feel very smooth."
"This ale has all the elements of an excellent brew with complexity and richness, so I had a difficult time figuring out why it is that I didn't enjoy it very much and would not be returning to it. I think it comes down to too much. Too rich, too strong, too spicy, too sweet. It feels like it ought to be cut with water before being served, like it's a pale ale concentrate."
"Drinkability: To bad I only had a 750ml bottle of this brew. Could easily had more along with some grilled salmon... Mmmmm"
"D- Not much to dislike with this. Simple ingredients, damn drinkable for the strength, well made."
"D: Seems too drinkable given the high ABV. Certainly an exceptionally quaffable brew - one of my all-time favorite beers."
"Drinkabilty: Great sesssion beer if you can handle a couple of these. Strong but not too strong. Overall very refreshing and tasty. Great to accompany grilled meats and veggies."
"Great beer, I don't drink many of this style, but this is one of the best of the style I have had. Will be buying more in the future."
"MF&D - very drinkable despite the abv and aftertaste presence. the carbonation is so smooth the beer is crisp like a freshly ironed shirt, very light on the palate. quite exceptional all around."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: The carbonation and flavors feel wonderful in the mouth. This beer begs for you to drink more and more."
"Drinkability: Being so light, subtly flavorful, and refreshing, and with a virtually non-existent alcohol presence, i could drink this all night with my friends."
"D: Not a session beer by any means, this is a liquid that is meant to be savored. When Plato said, ""He was a wise man who invented beer," I think he was referring to Duvel."
"D-Finished my bottle quick and looking for another. Very good beer and will definately be storing a couple of these."
"I greatly enjoy this beer, and recommend it highly."
"Drinkability - Lot's of aroma hits the nose with champagne-like carbonation, then crisp and light like a Pilsner yet complex like an ale with lingering flavors and a dry rather than sweet finish. So, there are a lot of things going on when you sip on this beer - Amazing!"
"The smell and taste were sweet, yeasty, peppery, and spicy, like lemon peel. The feel was crisp and the ale was so easy to drink it was gone in no time. There was slight warmth from the alcohol; however, it does not hit in the manner expected from the alcohol content. Duvel is delicious and deceptively refreshing. As good as Belgian ales get."
"Tremendously drinkable and very enjoyable. Fantastic brew all the way around."
"D: I could drink 4 bottles of this in a row. I have no idea how they did it at 8.5 abv. so easy to drink and its flavor is big and devine all the way to the end."
"Very good beer. Not the world class mana from heaven that seems to be the consensus in this place, but not something I'd ever be upset to see on the menu."
"the quintessential belgian pale it poured a golden yellow with a huge fluffy head that took a long time to recede smelled of sugar lemon citrus fruit and yeast ..the taste was sweet and fruity with clove and spice and malts and hops and belgium yeast it had a dessert quality about it ....this is the grandaddy of belgium pales and well worth it.. always a treat to drink with the high abv that is well hidden"
"Easy to drink. Easy to enjoy. Would go well with roasted pork - but I had it with grilled chicken with a champagne sauce. Not a bad pairing. If you're into beer, you should really try this one."
"Overall a good beer that it always a joy to have."
"D: Highly drinkable. Great with meals or on its own...very versatile. I can't believe this is 8.5% ABV...it drinks like 4-5%. Exceptional. I've known about this beer for a long time, yet this is the first time I've had it. Wow, I've been missing out."
"D: I love this beer. It brings back great memories of my trip to Belgium that turned me on to beer... I'll never forget the first time I had it, at a great bar where people willingly came over to speak with us and ask us where we were from. Always brings back happy thoughts. I just wish NBLC liquor stores had it here, but I'll be satisfied with getting Ontario friends to bring it to me. At 8.5%, it always makes me feel good, and it's something I could always have again."
"A true classic, one of the best beers that is widely available worldwide!"
"Some notes of apple, great lacing in the goblet and good carbonation throughout. A champion beer."
"Appearance typical for the style. Smells of sweet fruit, strawberries, and a slight tartness. A bit of a yeasty scent as well. The flavor followed smell. Sweet tasting, delicious with a little bit of tart fruit and yeast. Strawberry flavors prevalent, and a great mouth feel. Overall a delicious brew."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Goes down a bit too easily considering the alcohol content."
"About time I had this beer."
"D-For this beer being so big, it goes down very smooth. It says on the four pack that they age the beer before they release it. Maybe that's why I'm not really getting any alcoholness in this. It's very nice indeed. World class I'm sure. Be sure to try this beer if not yet. I'm sure I'll visit this beer again."
"I picked up the Duvel glass and 750ml gift set, and let it age for a month or two. What a difference the tulip glassware makes! After sipping on this for a while, I had to amend my scores from the last sampling. Simply a fantastic brew. Over the last time, I found that the alcohol was a bit more muted (a big plus) and the apple and yeast were more pronounced. Just loving it."
"This is an outstanding beer...one that I'm glad has become rather mainstream...available at many bars/carryouts. It's easy to drink, and has quite a layered flavor profile. And that head is classic...sticking around until the bitter end."
"...what a difference a year makes."
"Not sure what the hype is all about here?"
"Anyone who says they don't like beer.. hand them a bottle of Duvel, we'll have converts for sure! Truth!"
"Drink it slow and savor its' flavor."
"this brew is pretty exceptionally drinkable. it isnt as strong as i thought a belgian strong pale ale would be, but it is definitely drinkable and a beer i'd love to have again."
"Hands down, the most impressive bottled beer I've ever had. Duvel seems appropriate to me almost any time of the year, except maybe the dog days of summer. Unless you're sitting in a cold room drinking this, lightly chilled. Mmmm."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer - the carbonation and sweetness balance out quite well."
"This is a world class, extraordinary beer. Wish I had a good-looking stranger to enjoy this with, as the label suggests, but then I would need more than one 750ml bottle."
"Normally i drink this beer in summer as a thirstbuster. Not more than two because else the beer is like its name; a real devil."
"D- This beer is truly light and it does have some nice complexity in flavor. The buttery corn notes as it warmed seem to interfere with the other flavors but not a great deal. The head is simply incredible and the lace just last and last. This is one fizzy yellow beer that is wonderful."
"Conclusion: A classic, and truly worth all the press it gets...not something I drink all the time, but I'm always impressed when I come back to it."
"Drinkability- excellent, definitely will drink again, It is so delicious and refreshing."
"I don't know why, but I thought this beer might have been hyped a little too much, perhaps because it's so available. After trying it, this is definitely not the case. Hugely flavorful and complex, this is an excellent brew. I look forward to trying more beers from Duvel Moortgat, if I get the opportunity. Make no mistake, this is an exceptional beverage."
"This is one every beer afficionado should try, over and over. Schol!"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer - the carbonation and sweetness balance out quite well. If it weren't for the alcohol content, I would definitely session with this. This is a great Belgian style ale that is also widely available. I've seen it in my local grocery store before."
"Fantastic! Easy to drink, hides its alcohol well, sweet and citrusy, everything a light colored Belgian ale should be."
"Extremely drinkable. This thing is a pleasure on the tastebuds. There is a definite warming sensation, but the alcohol is hidden very well."
"This is outstanding! I am very pleased."
"This is a nice refreshing beer to have, but not entirely sessionable, a little too much carbonation and at 8.1%, I don't think you want to be drinking these all day, or the Duvel in you might come out."
"This has to be the most refreshing beer on planet Earth. A devil of a beer."
"Grainy malt and alcohol are the first things to hit my palate with some bready yeast coming shortly after. Then a sharp bitterness at the end, accentuated by some more of the alcohol. Body is light and carbonation is high, perfect for the style. This is the quintessential Belgian golden ale and is always a fun beer to drink. The four-packs do not last very long in my fridge."
"D- Pretty good for the high ABV. The beer isn't very boozy, just spicy so it makes it a pretty easy drinker."
"D- A pleasure to look at, smells wonderful, and super-tasty... very very drinkable until the 8.1% ABV gets you!!"
"This beer was recommended to by by a little shop owner who thought it was great fun to tease me about American macros! He was great though, and this is the first of a long line of recommendations the nice gentleman gave me. Expect more!"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable, thirst-quenching beer."
"Drinkability: This is so good. Its not unlike champagne in the taste and feel. It forces you to take another sip. The 8% is well hiddden. I almost always have to have 2."
"This is a good brew one of my favorite widely available beers i, i think they could have masked the alcohol better and given it a tad less carbonation otherwise go out and buy some, enjoy"
"Drinkability- Wow. I think that about sums it up."
"One of the most awesome and big beers for me till now. Got it here finally in Hoboken, NJ. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. The colour was a pale golden with a great, white head. Plenty of bubbliness evident. Smelt of lemons and fruit first up with liitle notes of grain. Ok, the beer is massive on taste - really bitter first up then dissolving into grain, malt and slight dryness, but the bitterness just stays on and on. Amazing tenure on the palate, keeps you wanting for more and more. Superb concelament of the alcohol. Great beer."
"Drinkability is off the charts for me. Almost too delicious. But not quite."
"Definitely worth its accolades. Definitely worth the money. Definitely worth having in the fridge at all times."
"D- Very drinkable and refreshing, I would definately go for another"
"Obviously I cannot afford to drink Duvel every day, but it is an incredible beer, one that you measure all others against. Everything that accompanies this beer is amazing, from the bottle to the glass, it is truly an experience."
"Drinkability is very high. This is just so clean and balanced that it never overwhelms your palate and goes down amazingly easily. Not in the least bit boozy. Overall, just a plain, no-frills, well-done Belgian ale. Always a good call when options are limited, or even when they aren't."
"I think Duvel gets a slightly bad rap because it is becoming more available. Just because my local grocery store carries it doesn't mean it's suddenly bad. I'm sure Point Beer is rare in Belgium. Maybe they'll make a trade..."
"D: It demands respect. Savory!"
"Tried again 9/24/2010-- almost a year later i keep my rating right around where it is at 4.3, very enjoyable beer or almost with flavor profile of an imperial pilsner with that yummy unique Belgian twinge, a real enjoyable beer thats complex yet quite simple easy drinking"
"Overall, this beer is pretty solid. I will definitely be keeping this one around more. It is just so drinkable. It is just so well crafted. I am really amazed by this beer. The world needs to experience Duvel. I will recommend this to anyone."
"I'm really glad this one made it into my cart. The Anderson's (Dublin, Ohio) has this beer, and I'm glad they do! One other note... If you're like me and prefer a fairly aggressive pour, go slow with this one. It produces substantial amounts of foam, and it would be a shame to waste even a drop of this delightful beer on a foam-over."
"Drinkability: Not amazing, but very quaffable and easy to drink. Not as great as I'd hoped for, and with the word of mouth I'd expected a bit better, but still a good drinking beer that at the right price I'm sure would make a fantastic intro-beer."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip with a beautiful clear golden yellow with a 4 finger head with great retention and a ton of lacing. Smell is of apples citrus and bananas. Kind of like a hefeweizen, but less spice. Taste is sweet and bitter at the same time, some pepper. Some spice and bananas in here as well, but not as much as in the smell. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, but still fairly creamy; crisp. Drinkability is good, especially with 8% abv."
"Poured a clear, straw color with a generous head that faded to a thin skin. The aroma is fruity. The taste was sweet and fruity, with a lot of carbonation blurring the taste buds. Feel was light bodied, but crisp and clean. Drinkability was above average. I had 750 ml bottle and could have gone another. Nice, pleasant beer that didn't knock me out. Not grossly overpriced like some of the Belgians, I'd happily have it again. Late note: As I reach the end of the bottle and it warms, I find my opinion of the taste raising a half notch."
"It doesn't get much better than this."
"Overall its a great example of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Its flavorful, but the alcohol is well hidden."
"D: I could drink this beer all night. The lack of alcohol in the taste makes this brew dangerous. But delicious."
"D: Wow, give me another because I finished this one in less than 10 minutes. Refreshing like a pils, tasty yeast like a wheat, mouthfeel like a strong ale. This beer deserves the praise it gets."
"Served in a Duvel glass. The beer pours a fizzy straw yellow color with a billowing white head. I get big lemon and lime notes with a dose of sugar and spice in the nose. The flavor is a bit lighter with with citrus and spice. Dry and crisp flavor. This beer is truly classic."
"Happy Birthday to me!"
"This is an excellent beer."
"Cheers!"
"D - really nice at $8.00 a bottle for 750ml not bad gicen the smootheness. Will not turn one down."
"D: I can't believe I waited so long to try this beer. Whenever I see it I'm going to have to really give it a strong consideration now. Highly drinkable, highly enjoyable."
"D - For the high ABV, this goes down without a hitch. If it weren't for the price, I would drink a lot more of these in one sitting."
"Cheers!"
"Duvel will remain a standard in my cellar for it's drinkability and the pleasent experience of sipping it over dinner on the deck in the cooling fall evening."
"Am I missing something? Everyone thinks this beer is so great, but, I don't get it. There's nothing I would fault this beer for, but there's really nothing particularly notable about it, either. I mean it's a solid beer, but I find myself having nothing to say about. No impulse to exclaim or anything when I drink it. There's nothing even remotely surprising about it. I guess it's pretty easy to drink given its high alcohol content, but really its pretty standard. As I said, I'm not faulting this beer, but I just don't understand how it got an A overall, and an A+ from the brothers. Again, I'm willing to accept the possibility that I'm missing something."
"Overall, I don't know how you could improve the drinkability of this beer. Unbelievably smooth, balanced, and complex. There's also no way of telling from the tatse that this is a big beer."
"Drinkability: if I had a big bottle of this stuff or access to it on tap, I could see myself getting into a whole lot of trouble. For an 8.5% beer it just goes down incredibly easily; it's creamy, tasty and just an all-round great beer."
"Hennepen, a nice Framboise and Duvel have been my introductions to the world of Belgian beers. Some good friends of mine gave my wife and I two Duvel gift sets, the ones with the Duvel glass, for our 25th anniversary this past weekend and I'm looking forward to letting them age a bit like the one I just reviewed. Then again I may not be able to wait! These are simply delicious beers."
"D - taste similar to champagne. This is something to sip and enjoy though the bitter pine taste seems too strong."
"Overall, not my favorite example of the style, but certainly a classic and a great example nonetheless in my opinion. Certainly give it a try if you haven't."
"D - Absolutely refreshing a pleasure to drink."
"Pours with a beautiful light yellow haze and a thick white foam for a head that lingers until the end. Smells of sweet bread/malts. Taste starts off as sweet and sour but ends up dry and ""alcoholy."" The head makes it a bit thicker, and the carbonation is pretty evident. Pretty good overall, even with an ABV of 8.5%, the alcohol wasn't really that strong compared to others of a similar level."
"Final Thoughts: This clearly a beer for the beer enthusiast and not your average drinker. It's good, yes, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites. This beer honestly reminds me of champagne, in that yes it is good, but only in small doses. You should try this beer at least once, and this would be a great session ale, if it's alcohol content wasn't so high."
"Could drink this beer all day and night until the 8.5% abv puts me out. Off the charts."
"D - Sky high. Too easy to drink as it is so smooth and balanced. The 8.5% is very well hidden even though you do catch in in the aroma. That said, it is best enjoyed as a sipper."
"Drinkability: A sipper, but oh so wonderful. Probably the best beer to pass my lips so far in my young life."
"D- I like to think this is a sipper but I drink them a little faster than I should...i.e. can usually drink more than one. love Belgian Ale and this is one of my all time faves. don't think I will ever go without having a couple in my cellar."
"Drink it."
"Overall a nice refreshing beer. Not my favourite because of the smell, but will never refuse one."
"PS. The tulip glass rules!! It really heightened the whole experience for me."
"I would recommend this beer."
"D-So drinkable. Oh so drinkable. Delightfully drinkable, complex and smooth. A classic brew, with good reason."
"I opened a 750 ml bottle of this the other day and forgot about it in my fridge. I used poured it into a glass and it's still fully carbonated."
"Mouthfeel exhibits a lot of active carbonation and overall very crisp. A classic Belgian ale and all around very refreshing."
"Drinkability - stuffs great, would been even better if it was slightly less bitter afterwards"
"D: This is an exceptionally crafted beer, and that shows in the drinkability. I'm almost done, and I crave another"
"Dr. Easy, crisp, clean, delightful."
"D: Amazingly so. If not for the price, would be my go to beer. This beer leaves a grin on my face every time. Pure liquid pleasure."
"Anyway, this beer is absolutely bonkers. You definitely have to try it. Wonder what's it like if it's aged..."
"M- light on the mouth vary nice"
"Had this in a Duvel tulip glass. I love the foam this beer produces and the way it lingers. It's like having a puffy cloud above the beer that enhances the whole experience. Duvel has a champange-like richness to it that the carbonation enhances into by making it creamy and frothy. A really special beer that stands out among other beers within its style due to its complex rich, chewy texture balanced by a subtle biterness of Saaz and Styrian Golding hops. It's delicious."
"Drinkability - I'm glad I had it but this is a beer for sitting back and savoring, not really making me want another. One is good enough."
"Another beer that i havnt tried for ages and just wanted an excuse to try it again so thought id buy it and review it,i love the shape of this bottle its so original and have never see another beer come close to this beer as establishing its look that everyone knows yet keeping its own status,this beer pours a sparkling yellow semi hazy colour which leaves a nice three finger frothy,bubbly head it is so full of bubbles eventually the froth mound sort of collapes to a big frothy mound in the middle with loads of prominent lacing all down the glass,the smell is fresh apples,pears,white grapes and candy not a hint of alcohol,the taste is very fruity with some hints of yeasty characters which leaves you with a nice full bready,caramelish finish on the pallete and a little alcohol warmth on your first taste but after my second sip i dont taste it again its one of those beers that you still cant believe is 8.5% it goes down that easy and in saying that, thats probably the only reason i wouldnt drink to many of these in one sitting but i definately appreciate this beer."
"D- WOW. Sooo drinkable. Nothing harsh about this beer anywhere. Just watch it drinks too easy for a beer with a 8.5% ABV. Nevertheless I could knock back many of these."
"M- Very crisp and dry. Like champagne."
"A tasty, drinkable brew."
"Poured into a duvel glass giving a large bubbled white head of only about 1.5 fingers, much less than I was expecting, but I poured it slow. The smell was of grains and yeast funk with most of the intricacies in the yeast funk. The grain was plain, somewhat bland in both aroma and in taste giving a vague note of frutiness. It seemed a tad like wine and it seemed as if I could taste some green grapes in their with the yeast funk that reminded me of a very very laid back lambic. The mouthfeel was bitter, crisp, refreshing and full all at the same time and was the best part of the beer. It was rather drinkable, but I found it to be bland, although it did hide it's alcohol well."
"The taste is unique and has a nice bite at the end. At almost 10% its a fav to drink regularly."
"Drinkability: It's not too bad, I guess I have found a preference for other Belgians though that don't have quite the bitter preference. It's got a nice flavor and a beautiful appearance, but the ABV is a bit high for too many of these in a row, plus, it's a bit on the pricey side."
"This is very drinkable except for the high ABV which sneaks up on you after two beers."
"Poured a golden color with an extremely full white head which suprised me. The smell was mildly fruity. Very mild. I didnt care for the taste at all. It tasted of over fermented apples. It freaked me out because I thought it was bad but my dad said it was delicious when I made him taste. It was alot more full in body then I expected but it was hard to get over the disctracting taste. I wouldnt drink this on the regular, maybe I need to work my way up to it in the Belgian world."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp yet smooth and velvety. It's a joy to drink."
"On a final note: A legendary beer, what can i say?"
"Understandably, a classic. But take it slow!"
"Drinkability: the sticking lace shows my quick progress, I'll have another but might pay for it in the morning"
"Overall: There are very few beers that I associate with the ""face"" of a style. Duvel is what I think of when somebody mentions a Belgian Strong Pale (or Golden) Ale. Everything I drink in that category, I find myself comparing to this beer. It's hard for me to think of a way to improve this beer."
"As far as the 'standard' Belgian beers go, I like Duvel over Chimay or Hoegaarden. You can get it anywhere in Belgium and many places throughout Europe - as well as in the USA. Duvel has an attractive, thick and creamy head. The flavor is rich yet the beer itself, by my estimation, is relatively light. (The alcohol is hidden but it hits you. Hard.) This is a beer to be sipped slowly and appreciated."
"Tastes like the quintessential Belgian pale: spice and green apple with a yeasty buffer and expansive drying quality. If this is truly 8.5% abv I'm a monkeys uncle."
"Always a good choice. I was impresses that the hotel bar had this and Chimay red to offer..."
"D - Excellent beer. I was not overly impressed with my first experience drinking this beer a couple of years ago but I must say for the 2nd time around this is an excellent beer!"
"If you have not tried it yet - it s a must try."
"D - I hardly noticed the alcohol and could drink this all night. A nice sipper and flavors are just so pleasant."
"The well balanced alcohol is deadly. I can feel this one bottle going to my head already, but the alcohol is so well balanced I could easily see myself having one to many. This beer is extremely easy to drink. And I feel a little tipsy from a single bottle. Not really a session beer, but so damned tasty and quaffable you wish it was."
"D - I could drink this every day for breakfast."
"D- Beware the ""Devil"" will get you. Take your time and you will be in heavan. Too many and it is a night in hell."
"d- I found this to be a great refreshing yet relatively high gravity beer. An excellent combination of potency, taste, and refreshment."
"D- Not my first Duvel and will not be my last. I like this a lot more than Chimay becasue of the complexity of it being a pale ale. As unique as any good wine is. The 8.5% is not a big deal with this beer as other Belgian beers can be. Do not get the strong alchohol taste that other Belgian beers have. That is what sets it a part from others. It can be a session beer and it can be a savored beer. One of my personal favorites"
"Poured into Duvel tulip. Crystal clear yellow gold with much bubbling and a tight foamy head and thick lacing. Smell is spicy, toasty, malty, yeasty, bready, fruity. Taste is crisp and clear, straightforward, spicy and toasty, cutting, sour, pungent. Mouthfeel is very biting and tight, drinkability is great."
"It really is a beautiful sight to behold. Lots of lacing to boot. The nose is full of citrus and light spicing, along with some dry grains. The taste is well hopped...slightly metallic upfront, but melting into a pleasant bitterness with abundant graininess. Cloves and cinnamon hints are very pleasurable. There's also a lot of fruit in there...perhaps peach and pear? Good levels of carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Good drinkability."
"Over all, it's a great beer. Balance is the key word here. My two criticisms are that it's a bit too spirity and the alcohol could be masked more, and personally, just a tad less carbonation would have been nice. This is a beer that I'm sure I will buy and enjoy again some time soon."
"Well, in all my years I have never poured anything like THIS before. Half the pilsner is a very light, very clear, gold color and the other half is the head. Half the pilsner is head I said! I do not know how to grade this. I am at a loss for any analysis. I am just going to have to take a stab at looks. The smell is great. Smell of very fresh hops in something that promises to be potent. As I TRY to pour the rest of the beer, here we go again. Head out the yin-yang. Am I ever going to DRINK this beer? Finally, the taste. Not impressed. Very weak. Can taste the massive carbonation as if it was campaign, not beer. No aftertaste at all. Very fresh. Very, very drinkable, but drink a domestic light if you want a buzz. Verdict: Try at your own risk."
"Taste is representative of what one comes to love about the style. Slightly sweet, crisp, a little off-dry, but very clean and refreshing. Mouthfeel is vivid, appropriately carbonated. Drinkability... this is one of the most drinkable beers out there, period. I know it's much ballyhooed, but it is also a classic of the style for a reason. Everyone should try it at least once."
"Smooth, tasty, and easy going for this much alcohol. I would definitely have another and recommend this to others."
"Spritzy and spicy are the first impressions...like there is coriander and thyme in here. Strong yeast and wheat flavors. The body is moderate with a high level of carbonation. Deceptively easy to drink."
"One of my favs."
"I've been saving this one until I felt I could truly appreciate it, and now that I've tried over 350 different beers I think I may be ready. It poured from the bottle into my snifter with one of the biggest pillowy white heads I've ever seen. I love how it settles down into a small fluffy foam glacier in the middle of the glass It smells nice with some biscuity malt, Belgian yeast, and a hint of lemon. It tastes light and refreshing, definitely a great summer beer. It feels pretty carbonated but goes down easy and smooth. Of all the Belgian and Belgian-style beers I've had so far this is probably the best. It's light and crisp and very well done, you can taste the quality."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is."
"Poured a nice light golden color with a huge white head. Nose is bready, yeast, fruit and alcohol. Taste is boom, alcohol upfront, with fruits, bread and yeast. Mouthfeel is thin and warm. The ABV is pretty prominent. Drinkability is good but not sure I would want to drink to many of these. Just not my thing."
"D: Almost immediately seducing and intoxicating, and being so damn hard to come by (at least at a price not ranging 400% the original) where I live they are well treasured and a favorite."
"Mouthfeel - medium thin in the mouth. This seems like a good summer beer for the hoply inclined."
"very drinkable.dangerous as hell. no wonder they call it the devil!"
"Verdict: Duvel is truly a brilliant beer and thoroughly stands up to it's rather lofty reputation. If you're looking to start your journey through the fascinating world Belgian beers, you certainly won't go wrong with this as your first step. A classic in all regards."
"I don't know if I just had a bad bottle or what. I bought this today after reading all these great reviews but can't say I feel the same way. I definitely didn't think it was bad, I just really wasn't blown away at all. I do remember having this last year once and feeling the same way about it, mostly indifferent. I kind of feel like I'm missing out...what am I missing here? 4.0"
"Well made and tasty. Would drink again."
"My first ever Belgian ale, right before the yank Memorial Day weekend, and I'm definitely feeling it (the ale, that is.) I have ""gained a level."" Combined with spicy tacos, and not a good choice. Beer became bitterer. Lager would have beer better."
"Enjoyed this beer very much. I feel it's a drink that would grow on me even more as I get used to its particular bitterness."
"I can, and have, consume this all day, the alcohol is almost non-apparent, this is a classic beer, and it can be enjoyed anywhere any time."
"Overall an excellent beer, truly the best of the style. I'll be picking up more of this beer wherever I can find it. Cheers everyone!"
"Serving suggestion: Poured from a 750ml bottle into an authentic Duvel tulip glass."
"This beer was a nice champagne type beer that seems to have a bit of carbination but did not leave the palete to overwelmed. Good drinkability but I feel I may need to give this another try it did not meet expectations."
"In case you're wondering, it's still phenomenal from a bottle."
"A true classic that somehow always ends up in my shopping cart when I go to Trader Joes. It works great as a year round beer. One of these days I will get around to aging a few and see how they turn out."
"Notes: This is definitely the gold standard for which BSPA's should be measured. Having had this several times before, but reviewing it for the first time here, I can say that this one deserves all of the accolades it receives. Also, one of the best values out there. $9 for a 750, yes please!"
"Anyhow, good but dangerous beer."
"As for the Strong Belgian Pale Ales ... Duvel is thy Master."
"Not my favorite style of beer, so I am probably not able to appreciate this as much as others may. However, it is still evident that this is a well crafted brew."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. A great brew which I am glad I saved for Review number 100."
"D - Scary drinkable! Addictive and refreshing and 8.5%!"
"overall this might be #1 in my books as far as taste and drinkability"
"Drinkability is also great. I could have probably sucked down the entire 750 mL if it weren't for the other guys I had to share it with."
"Finishes clean on my palate with a bit of dryness. My mouth can't get enough of this one. The flavor is so light and refreshing that it is deceiving. Alcohol is very well-hidden. This is probably the most sessionable beer I have had over 8%."
"33cl bottle from systembolaget. Pale yellow with a crystal clear body if you pour it right. Champagne carbonation trails and a big white head that leaves a lasting layer of foam. Very pilsener like aroma, with saaz and pale malt, but an amazing tart citrus and pear character blends in too. Fruity sweet and tart all the same, with yeast and alcohol following. Elegant hop balance keeps it from being cloying. The body is suprisingly light and delicate for a beer this strong. I'm suprised at how easily it goes down. Very enjoyable and displays plenty of unique character compared to other belgians I've had."
"Appearance is pale gold in color with a good deal of bubbles in the glass and a thick, white, foamy head. Smells of cirtrus, and has a somewhat champagne-like quality on the palate, very clean, somewhat citrusy, warming alcohol on the back of the tongue. Very drinkable even at a moderately high ABV."
"Wow. Last time I had a Duvel was roughly 6-8 months ago, and I don't remember it being this flavorful. Maybe my tastes have changes? Maybe I had a bad bottle then? I'm not sure, but what I know for certain now is that this is a killer brew and deservedly one of the best Belgians on the market. Bravo. Would definitely recommend and look forward to drinking the remaining three bottles."
"D- Great. This is a great Belgian brew."
"I willl revisit this one again, probably when I have a Belgian night with some friends."
"One of my all-time favorite beers. I feel almost silly not giving this all-5's, as it pretty much is the definition of its' style. Just a great beer, and one I don't have nearly enough."
"So carbonated that the cork popped out without me touching it and shot 30 feet in the air. Poured a straw yellow with a very large head. The smell is peppery, yeasty, a lemony. The taste has some peppery spice to it, with a very clean mouthfeel. Extremely bright carbonation. Drinkability is exceptional for an 8.50% beer."
"Worthy of it's following, and being the standard by which all other strong pales are measured against. I don't know if I'd say it was the best, but it's sure up there."
"D: Exceedingly drinkable--this will be a standby during the summer months."
"A progenitor of the style, for very good reason. Once past the aggravating opening theatrics, everything just goes so very smoothly for such an alcoholic pale ale, so much so that one might inadvisably be inclined to make a night of this. I would suggest looking up the name's literal meaning before deciding on such a course of action."
"When i first tasted it in the 80s, I was defenately impressed with it, and I still am today."
"All in all, this is one of my favorite beers. There is not too much I can say that has not already been said about it. I may just have to have one now."
"I haven't found another I like as well. My affinity for this one has earned me the ""fancy beer guy"" moniker from sweet Anna at Miller's. (Yes, I figured she deserves props.)"
"pour is a light golden. crisp clear with a magnificent tight white head. smell of straw, a mild belgian sugar cane, and apples. palate is simple with a wonderful carbonation. a light floral astringent, crisp straw malt, apples, lemon, mint that tingles on the middle of the tongue, and a dry pepper with mid bitter. one of crispest for the alcohol content which is well hidden."
"Overall, not nearly as good as I expected, and I like Chimay much better. But still a decent Belgian Pale Ale."
"D=easy to enjoy the 750ml, possibly even two, any more might be a stretch"
"It's easy to see why this is such a classic. It's exceptional all-around."
"This beer looks very light, and pretty clear. Its a light golden color, and has a very cloudy, soapy head that hangs around. The smell is very floral and sweet, and has a sweet, yeast smell to it. The taste is light and sweet. It finishes somewhat dry, but the hops arent' overpowering by any means. Generally a light, sweet beer, that hides the alcohol oh so well. The mouthfeel is nice, it goes down very easy. like I said, it is a very drinkable beer, and hides the alcohol very well. I love this style, and this is a great example. I don't know how I could suggest any modifications to this. It is a great example of a Belgian strong golden ale."
"Overall, a simply great beer. The best I have had of its style and just simply delicious. A must try."
"D- I was not blown away by this but Duvel certainly is worthy of it's place within this style, of which I buy a lot of replica's of which do not compare. A bit high in alcohol which is O.K. by me but a tad to much carbonation."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Carbonation is high and the body is medium."
"Tastes slighly sweet (but not too) woth lots of different fruit tastes to baffle the toungue. Beautiful mouthfeel with the right amont of carbonation and zing. The ultimate belgian pale for a reason."
"This was the first Belgian beer I ever had many many years ago, while visiting a friend in Brussels, and it not only became one of my favorites beers, but it made me curious about other Belgian styles."
"D- Really nice brew that is highly drinkable (watch that ABV)."
"Spectacular beer!"
"Maybe I have too many good local microbreweries with plenty of Belgians to choose from but I was utterly disappointed with this beer. I prefer a sweet Beligian, so maybe if you enjoy a tasteless, flavorless, non-descript Belgian ale, then this is definitely the beer for you. If you don't have local Belgians try Urthel before you try this. This beer is really WAY overrated on this website."
"I could drink this beer all day long, it is just so light and refreshing, with the alcohol hidden so well. Excellent beer, definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it."
"poured from its trademark stubby bottle into a wine chalice. bright pale golden in appearance, somewhawt opaque, with a pillowy white head; thick and creamy up top. an endless supply of bubbles make their way towards the head and last til the beer is no more and remind me of champagne. head remained until the very end as well. a beautiful beer. smells yeasty accompanied by alcohol, smells a bit dry, not noticing much fruit or sweetness on the nose. taste is crisp as can be, from start to finish. classic belgian yeast flavors, a little hint of citrus sweetness, and definitive alcohol on the finish. the bitterness on the end of each sip is enjoyable and lasts forever. i finished the beer 15 minutes ago and the bitterness is just now leaving. mouthfeel is almost creamy at the beginning, then it feels fairly juicy in the middle. excellent, burp inducing carbonation all over the place. scores ok for drinkability, i would not be able to rush through these, but 3 or 4 wouldn't be too much a task, and would be all you need. very well crafted beer."
"The heat at the end of every couple of sips lets you know how boozy it is, but it won't take you long to eschew your responsibilities and continue to plumb the depths this beer offers. So overwhelmingly good you'll be hard pressed to stop."
"D- This is a fanatically delicious beer. I had heard good thing about his beer and it more than lived up to the buzz. I believe this is huge crowd pleaser.. super smooth yet so much flavor."
"The drinkability is a knock because you cannot have too many in a row."
"D) I found Duvel to be good, but not an exceptional example of the style"
"Drinkability is ok. Just a strong and simple Belgian blonde in my book. The glass is by far the best thing about the whole package. While I appreciate it's good looks, the taste just doesn't do a lot for me, and I find it to be average at best. About as close to American lager as you can get in a Belgian Ale, taste wise. And isn't that really what it's all about?"
"It was Duvel that kicked open the door to the world that Michael Jackson wrote about. A world of great beers, great understanding and great friends. And for that reason it will always remain in my mind as the best beer."
"There are not enough good things to say about this beer. It is my favorite Belgian Ale, Trappist excluded. I have to pour it very slowly because the head of this beer can get out of control quick. A full galss of Duvel is certainly one of the best sites to see, and has become the standard of how a Belgian ale should look, with it large flavorful head. The smell is very spicy. The taste is very crisp with a slight bite to it. This is a great beer to drink with dinner, especially my favorite, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich at The Abbey in Providence."
"D: Found this to be very drinkable. The 8.5% ABV is well hidden. I think I waited too long to try this one. I like it and would recommend it."
"I'll have to try it again sometime."
"The alcohol is present on the tongue but not over powering. Really a great taste, very smooth going down; vague fruity and floral notes."
"Notes: what a gorgeous beer! totally lives up to its reputation. extremely easy drinking, despite the carbonation. delicious fruitiness. totally disappears from your mouth once you swallow. i know i gave it all 5's, but i just didnt know where to compromise, and this is a perfect example of what a strong golden should be"
"Overall an excellent beer!"
"Overall this beer has something for everybody - go find some if you haven't had it before."
"Worth the wait."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, especially for a beer of this strength."
"What can a poor beer journeyman like myself say about a beer like this that hasn't been said? Top notch."
"Perfect amount of carbonation, and has a smooth, somewhat creamy mouthfeel."
"[resample-IF,tap]"
"Lingering astringency with this beer. Slight medicinal notes that overshadow the finish of the beer."
"I wish I didn't have a +/- 120 mile round trip just to be able to buy this beer. If it weren't for that, I would always have at least a couple of bottles on hand."
"Drinkability: I'm torn on this one. It tastes outstanding, and the light flavors make me want to drink this quickly, but the prickly carbonation and high alcohol say otherwise. This beer would be almost perfect if it were lower in ABV/carbonation, making it easier to drink, or if the flavors were a bit more full. Regardless, this is an excellent beer, and one that I will likely constantly keep on hand."
"Notes: To be honest I'm sad that I've waited this long to try such a highly touted brew. One of Michael Jackson's top five beers in the world, this is definitely something that everyone should get a taste of at least once in their lifetime. I'm so glad I bought it, but sad that I only got one bottle. I'll definitely be buying more in the future."
"Poured into a stemless wineglass golden yellow with a nice thick white head that stays around for a long time, the way a belgian should. Good amount of bubbles, but the carbonation isn't evident in the mouthfeel. Smell isn't as strong as I expected, but the normal spices are present. The taste is a nice spiced hop bite, but not too strong for a BSPA. It's very well balanced."
"D- easy but after the third glass it lost its strong ale taste and adopted a taste similar to a triple. Maybe this was just my palate."
"Drinkability: Great! I would definitely drink this one again if I saw it!"
"Pours an almost hazy, but mostly clear yellow/golden color, with a big, fluffy, white head. The head collapses, leaving a little lacing, and a thin puff of bubbles stays on top the whole time. The smell is nice. Powdery pilsener malts, some light sugary smells, but not a very intense sweetness. A very faint earthy spiciness from the noble hops. The taste comes across first with some nice pleasant pilsener malt. Then the noble hops kick in, with some minty, almost peppery spice with a nice earthy finish. There's a nice struggle between sweetness and dryness in the finish, and I enjoyed the battle. Very nice, right on, could maybe play more to some more raisiny, bready malts, but still a standard for taste I'd say. The carbonation is sharp on the tongue, which is kind of normal for a BSPA. The beer itself is kind of right on too, not too heavy/thick, or too light/thin. Good. The drinkability is good too. The alcohol warms a bit as you go on, but really you hardly notice it and this one can go down quick and easy."
"D - I'd love to drink these all night, they go down that easily. I would pass out eventually."
"Drinkability is moderate. It tastss great, but the highly ABV makes it more of a special occasion beer."
"750ml bottle. Pours a sunny yellow color with thick head. Very nice appearance, even though I do not own a tulip glass. Duvel smells very sweet, citrusy, and nutty. On the taste I definitely tastes nuts, and fruit. It is very sweet as the smell indicates. It has a medium mouthfeel I would say, and it goes down very well. I really enjoy this beer, but I would have trouble drinking a lot of this in one sitting. But I have nothing but good things to say about this beer. It is definitely highly praised for a reason."
"This is a very drinkable beer for one or two bottles. The high alcohol content would keep me from drinking too many at once. Overall this is a great beer."
"Overall, an excellent beer that is both complex and well balanced. Love the fact that it's available at LCBO's all around here and will definately enjoy another soon."
"Beers like this always serve to remind me that the world of craft beer does not begin and end with huge IPAs and massive stouts. This is the ultimate Belgian Strong Pale, and one not to be missed."
"The next adventure awaits...later."
"D: Good, given the amount of alcohol. There's a reason the Belgians have a reputation for doing strong ales better than anyone else."
"Light yellow, fizzy and champagne like appearance. So much head I can only pour so much into my chalice at a time. Sour green grapes are prevalent in the smell along with some yeastiness and cloves. The most prevalent taste is the sour green grape, but there are some other fruits in there as well. Very sweet and sticky, and as in the appearance, champagne like. Very carbonated and fizzy mouthfeel, but not very heavy at all. Extremely drinkable, doesn't taste this strong at all."
"Poured amber hazy hue with a huge rocky white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Aroma was a heavy hop, light yeast and alcohol. Flavor was a heavy hop, light yeast with a moderate alcohol burn with a long duration finish. This is a standout beer"
"Notes: This is the third time I've had this, and every time I like it more and more. First time I really wasn't that impressed, but now I'm hooked!"
"D: Could drink it all night. None of the elements are overpowering, and 3-4 of these in a night is not beyond me. I absolutely love it."
"Certainly a well brewed beer and it lends to my ongoing joke about why the German's occupying Belgium probably got fat and lazy drinking this and others given the high ABV. Not a beer that everyone while enjoy, but a neat experience none-the-less."
"Stubby Belgian bottle; best by 05/2010. Brewed with Flemish water, French pilsner malt, Scottish yeast and Czech hops. Boiled for 1.5 hours, fermented with ale yeast, lagered for 3-4 weeks at 27Â° F, bottle-conditioned warm for 10 days, then cold-conditioned for six weeks at 41Â° F before leaving the brewery. Whew! This brew pours a bright, crystal-clear gold, with lots of beads of carbonation and three inches of beautiful head. I can tease the foam two-fingers above the rim of the glass, and it is as dense as meringue at the top, with fluffy froth below. There is a bit of haze at the end of the pour, and a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Smells sweetish, with subtle esters and traces of noble hops. It's a bit muted at first, but as it warms, it opens up and becomes more aromatic. The flavor has sweet pilsner malts that interplay with fruity alcohol and esters, lots of warming alcohol, flashes of spicy Saaz, and notes of banana and spice. Becomes more and more Belgian toward the end, with lingering hops and malt. Medium-light on the palate, nearly creamy, with a medium finish. Definitely a unique brew; each sip begins and ends like a pilsner, sandwiching spicy/fruity Belgian notes in the middle, making me want to call it a Belgian imperial pilsner. A one-of-a-kind beer that is in a class all its own. Definitely worth revisiting."
"Drinkability: I'd love to have this again, and I'm sure I will. Not the most complex beer out there, but very balanced and fun. Carbonation provides for a lot of excitement in both look and feel. Flavors work well with the alcohol too. I could easily drink several of these."
"Poured from 11.2oz bottle(best before date on bottle: 04 2011) into chalice. Pours light golden, almost champagne colored, with tons of soapy head that fills the glass easily with a careful pour. The sides of the glass are covered in lacing from the head and a string of bubbles rises non stop around the glass. As I poured it I was strangely reminded of Busch beer in the scent. Upon letting it sit I get more banana like scents. Taste is surprisingly mellow with the same banana flavor as I got in the smell and Belgian yeasts. To me this tastes like a watered down tripel in a good way. Very similar in flavor to many of the tripels I've had lately but much smoother and more balanced. I've been slowly backing away from Belgian styles lately but this one makes me want more. A perfect example of a Belgian strong pale. Mouthfeel is a little tangy on the tongue and dry as you drink it but makes you want more as soon as you set the glass down. I have to say this is very drinkable for being 8.5 abv. I could definitely drink several of these despite the high alcohol content. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who hasn't had it."
"Poured from a 750ml caged and corked bottle into a pint glass. The first glass pours a bright and clear golden yellow, the last glass is cloudy with yeast sediment. Every pour results in a thick soapy white head that coats the side of the glass as you drink. The smell at first reminded me of a macro-brew. As it sat odors of yeast, banana, and alcohol are present. The taste is sweet with strong flavors of banana and yeast with little hop flavor. Carbonation is strong, but it is very drinkable. Overall a very good beer."
"M - Thin bodied, light, good carbonation."
"The color is brilliant blond with a great good body; there's a lot of spices and grapes in the smell; the flavor is complex and very strong, like the smell, with spices and grapes, have bittersweet end; there's a lot of carbonation; i finished very fast; tasty to accompany pastes (although I took it with escalopes)."
"D- easy to finish and worthy of the reputation. a couple of these in a sitting would be a treat. its a shame this beer is often overlooked by me because of harder to find, and often less enjoyable beers. ill try to make it a point to pick this up more often."
"This goes down exceptionally easy, especially considering the ABV. If it wasn't printed on the bottle, I would never believe this to be an 8.5%. Again, the flavor and mouthfeel make this a very refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: This beer is the most drinkable beer I have tasted."
"4.5 D: This is some tasty shit."
"This beer is so well balanced I can see why it's a standard. Time to get a sixer and branch out."
"A very drinkable beer. Very servicable to a 'novice' like myself, this beer was both clean and fresh. I was not impressed with the smell of the beer but the full rich taste more than made up for the SLIGHT offensiveness caused by the aroma. The book is definitely better than the cover here, and there is no reason to doubt this beer on your next purchase if you like ales or goldens or Belgian's of any kind. Truly a beer for all seasons and not disappointing in the least."
"My only regret is I didn't have a Duvel glass to try it in. That will be my next task."
"Note: I drank my bottle after letting it warm up on the kitchen counter for about twenty minutes. When served cold, the flavor is crisper and the carbonation more subdued."
"I have to assume Allagash White is a tribute to this beer after tasting it and noticing striking similarities. Both are delicious"
"A lovely pale yellow with a massive fluffy head and fine active bubbles. A bit of orange, banana and earthy spices jumping out of the glass. It's a pleasure drinking this every time. Beautiful mouthfeel, the alcohol is present and slighlt warming but in no way dominates. Such a good beer"
"Overall surprisingly good for the storage conditions."
"Thank you Belgium. Can I become a citizen?"
"D: Almost too drinkable, given the ABV. I was through my glass in no time and ready for another. Truly a classic."
"D: Of course it's exceedingly drinkable. This is, for me, the quintessential Belgian Blonde."
"This poured a delightful golden straw color, almost opaque, with a fantastic, foamy, white, mountainous, and over zealous head that laced perfectly down the sides of the glass 'till the very bottom. There was plenty of lively carbonation that actually put me in a daze as it danced to the top of the brew. The smell was well balanced and appeasing to the nose. Citrus, wheat, malts and light spices were all evident; this is how I expect a true Belgian to smell. There was nothing overpowering, just welcoming. The mouth feel was beyond exceptional, very crisp with excellent carbonation, initial sweetness followed by a slightly bitter, yet satisfying finish. Perfect balance of flavors that tasted much like the nose. This beer is extremely drinkable. The only reason I give it a 4 is because of the alcohol content. A few of these may put you away for awhile. At 8.5abv, I might only be ale to do half a sixer of it, depending on my mood. Overall, a fantastic brew and probably on my list for top 3 Belgians. It certainly lived up to all of the hype."
"D- An amazing beer, so enjoyable let it speak for itself."
"This beer is what so many others try (and fail) to be. The sophisticated way to brew an intensely flavorful, hoppy beer (as opposed to many of the ""extreme"" american brews)."
"D 5.0 - Love the Appearnace. The smell and tastes backs up the reputation. You have to try one of the in the Duvel glass to fully appreciate it. Take you time. Prep it well."
"D: Very drinkable for a decent sized beer. This is a nice combination of flavors and beer styles. It just goes down so easyily and is nicely drinkable. The only problem is I could see the ABV catching up with you because it feels more like a pilsner rathe than a Belgian. Just very light and enjoyable. Sa it took so long to get around to it but I feel like I finally have an appreciation for a beer like this. Well done and just amazing."
"Being a beer advocate for this long and I've never had this before. Picked up a 4-pack of this, which came with a Duvel glass. Pours a golden color with a huge fluffy head. It's a cloud on top of a beer. Lacing stays on the side of the glass the whole beer and head retention is outstanding. There is a steady flow of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass the whole time. Smell is belgian yeast with hints of sugar, candy and alcohol. Sweet, crisp taste that starts off sweet with sugar and evolves into a more bitter taste that has hints of seafood almost, but it is just subtle enough to be enjoyable and not disgusting. Despite the appearance, the beer is not overly carbonated and has a mouthfeel and drinkability. Overall, this is a great beer and I'm surprised I haven't had it yet."
"The taste is very clean, straightforward pilsner, but sweeter and more complex. It's light and crispy in the mouthfeel, but interesting to the bottom of the glass. A very interesting brew and incredibly drinkable. I can't believe this is 8.5%."
"Poured into Chalice (I don't have a Tulip). Poured a bright, clear, golden color with a thick, fluffy, white head of small, tight bubbles. Head was very long lasting with a lot of sticky lacing. A wonderful spicy aroma that can be picked up from a distance. The flavor follows where the aroma has led. The spice is the most noticeable, but is not overpowering. The secondary flavor is the unique yeast. A crisp, full body that leaves no aftertaste. Very drinkable, having several of these will make for a great evening. A true world classic."
"Drinkability is good but I couldn't do too many of these in a row."
"D - very easy drinking and the alcohol is hidden very well."
"Highly recommended to all lovers of beer, Duvel is something you've just got to try at least once. Chances are, you'll be coming back for more."
"This beer is very refreshing and easy on the taste buds. One of the greatest ever produced!"
"very drinkable easily one of the top beers in the world .."
"Overall, my favorite beer. It's one of those things that hasn't seem to got old yet. I went through alot to get my favorite beer stop to order it. It's one of those rarities you can't expect to find around here."
"D: Extremely drinkable...with warning that you don't feel the ABV until much too late!"
"D - drinkable, better than the first time I had it. Over carbonated then. Now, good, much better balanced, probably got a bad bottle that's why I was hesitant to try it again."
"D--Warming eventually comes on. NOT a thin/weak-bodied beer. Just smooth. Not a pounder, not a meal."
"Poured to a nice golden color with a big, thick white head that has good retention and left nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. The first thing that the aroma brings to mind is yeast that gives off a nice fruit aroma, banana, apples and slight citrus. Also spicy smells waft out which are nice mixed with the hop aroma, Saaz? The flavor comes across as sweet at first from the malts then breaks to a mix of fruit (apple and/or pear) and spicy pepper. At the end the hop aroma identified in the nose comes out on the pallet and mixes extremely nicely with the carbonation levels. The 8.5% alcohol is so well hidden that even as it warms I am not really picking it up, just dynamic flavors that play together so well. Overall this is a fantastic brew, clearly the best Belgium strong pale I have had, though I have not had many. I will admit that I like some other Belgium beer types more this one bit it is one that I will want to introduce to friends as it a very, very good."
"I've recently been drinking Grade ""A" beers and this is my favorite. It is so tasty. It doesn't get any better than this. It has a world class taste to it that is like no other beer that I've tried. It doesn't taste like it has 8.5% ABV. It seems less so it will sneak up on you. Everybody should try it."
"D: i can drink this all day which can be extremely dangerous. it's light, but you still get an explosion of flavor in your mouth"
"Poured a golden straw colour with a thick foamy head that lasted for what seemed like forever. Smelled very sweet, fruity and hoppy. Has very banana like flavours but becomes a bit bitter towards the end. I expected more from this. Mouthfeel was light and low on the fizz. Something I could enjoy drinking in the right mindset. Just a shame it didn't impress me much as I thought it woud."
"12/11/09: Trying an 8-month old version (best by 4/11 date). Not much difference although malts are a little more prominent and hops seem more herbal and are less assertive."
"Pale, straw gold with a chunky, large snow-white head (gorgeous!) and a very characteristically Belgian aroma of strong orange, banana and yeast on the nose but nothing too special. These flavours persist in the sip with a dominance of banana and yeastiness (fairly aggressive) with a medicinal background and aftertaste which I was not fond of at all. The mouthfeel is soft and dry and quite nice, and the drinkability is really excellent, it's light and refreshing and doesn't feel like 8.5% at all. I may re-review this one as I am feeling a bit sick and that might be affecting my perception of the taste... It's a nice beer, it seems, in all areas except for the taste, especially the aftertaste."
"I was hoping for a bit more of a wow, considering Duvel is a world class beer and a legendary beer at that. I have 3 more I'll cellar for a while and return to in a few months to review again."
"Pours with a lot of head. The head is really thin though. Once the beer passes through the head and touches your tounge, you immediately taste the wonderfulness of this beer. Slightly sweet and tangy at the same time. It is pretty hoppy but a great beer. My favorite beer just to sip on."
"Drinkability: This beer could trap you. It is so easily drinkable one could easily slip down too many without realizing it."
"Taste: Fruity taste just like you would expect from the smell but there is a slight taste of alcohol (not a strong taste though). This was so good that it was a little scary how easy it was to drink more then you planned."
"Poured from a stubby into a snifter. Pours clear golden with a ridiculous white frothy heading that lasts to the very end. A nice fruity smell with different smells of malts and hops.A very sweet taste alot like an apple,an awesome juicy taste.This beer is like drinking champagne truly the best beer I've had. Was very aggravated when I first opened this brew as it exploded all over my hands. Like someone played a trick on me and put it into a paint shaker."
"The origins of this beer's name are not at all unfounded. The 8.5% alcohol is unfathomable while quaffing, creating one decidedly devilish deceiver."
"Really a great beer... I wonder if it ages well... I've never been able to hang onto them long enough."
"I have to give this ""5's"" accross the board. I had my 2nd one today(one per day that is). Fruity smell, great appearance, tastes excellent all around. Less expensive at the national chain ""Total Wine & More"" compared to a local discount store. Go figure. $12.99/4 pk. Drinking from a Duvel glass ($14.99/4pk and glass!) Let me know if you find it cheaper elsewhere."
"Drinkable, almost too drinkable. This beer is incredibly smooth."
"Drinkability - Beer as it should be defined in the dictionary. It's light color, heavy head, great yeasty/hoppy crisp taste are all the combination as beer is seen or imagined in any literature."
"Once again, ""A true devil"" indeed."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a very clear yellow with an impressive white head. The aroma is spicy with phenolic notes. The flavor is sweet and spicy with alcohol notes throughout. The finish lingers with sweet alcohol. A light bodied beer that is easy drinking. Duvel is a great beer."
"Drinkability: This beer is truly well-balanced, but still bold with fantastic flavors. However, I would say that it's in the drinkability department that this one truly excels: it just drinks very very well. Of course, the alcohol will sooner of later take its toll, but it should be noted that it's not before the very end that the taste of alcohol becomes prominent."
"A fantastic beer, truly reprentative of the style. Great balance is the key, too many belgian ales are boozy sweet. This beer is able to balance the sweetness and the carbonation/hops yielding a truly magnificent beer."
"D - I'd seen many people mention this beer on the site. I was in a store and notice some additional glassware with purchase of a Four-Pack of Duvel. I figured this would be the time to try. I'm glad I did... and can't wait to have a few with friends."
"At first, I was skeptical of the high praise this beer has gotten, and I don't remember exactly enjoying it when I first tried it, but now that my tastes in beer have grown considerably, I can say that this one deserves all the hyperbole it gets. If you like beer, you owe it to yourself to try this one at least once. You won't regret it."
"There's something to be said for any beer that inspires 100s of imiitators. Duvel is such a beer. Served from the classic caged corked big bottle into the stamped tulip glass, the amazing rocky head iis truly a sight to behold, and an important lesson for BA wannabes who think that the less head is better. Brilliant quite clear orange in color, with orange peel and coriander up-front, and a pretty significant alcohol aftertaste. Having tasted Duvel in the corked cage, 330ml and on cask, I must advocate for the big bottle, the bottle conditioning sets it apart from its brethren. For anyone looking towards gaining an appreciation for Belgium's weighty contribution to the world of brewing, this beer is an absolute must. Looking forward to cracking my stash open in about 6 months. The scary part is despite the high ABV, this is a very drinkable brew-very tasty! Unquestionably one of the world's great beers."
"D: High, nothing is overpowerful here, making it easy to drink. Alcohol might slow you down, but that's bout it."
"Drinkability: Two words: Great BEER."
"D: Refreshing and delicious, a subtly complex beer. For a beer with a medium caliber abv, very drinkable."
"this is the one (and i consider it a belgian style golden ale if there is such a thing) to judge the others by. in my opinion, it looks just about perfect. hazy golden straw color with a fluffy, pillowy, white head that never goes away, and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass. apples and pears in the nose as well as a touch of musty hoppiness, lemon zest, candi sugar and some clove/pepper yeastiness. everything the nose hints at comes together in an extremly well balanced way that is light and full in body at the same time and carrying a pleasant bitterness in the finish. too easy to drink and amazing for a beer that is produced in such quantity. the cream of the crop. the only beers that will give this one a run for the money in my opinion are russian river's golden ale (damnation? I always get them mixed up) and surprisingly, brooklyn's local1. both of which i believe are modeled after this beer. quality."
"Notes: All in all a very crisp and refreshing beer. Alcohol is hidden well but still warms the throat upon drinking. The overall taste may have been a bit lacking in have a pronounced flavor, but nevertheless Duvel is well balanced."
"Over all drink ability is good. Nice flavors, would buy again. Not my favorite in this style but still a great beer"
"Overall, this beer really is not over-rated."
"Pours a clear straw gold with a nice dissipating head and moderate lacing. Smells a little skunky with some malt and spice. Flavors are a bit complex and blend pretty well, definitely a bitter aftertaste. Pretty light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This beer is much more impressive when considering the 8.5% abv. Overall a solid beer, and it's always a plus that you can find it at any local convenient store if your are in Belgium.. but if I'm there I'm drinking something else."
"UPDATE: Wow. This is the first beer I've experienced where pouring style actually makes a considerable difference. I poured my third glass slow and easy and it really cuts down on the head while quite noticeably ramping up the carbonation. Pour it normally (1/2 tilted, 1/2 90-degree angle) and it foams up and tastes very flat. Pour it as directed and it's as bubbly as champagne. Very interesting. I think I prefer it somewhere in the middle."
"What used to be my old go to beer, this bottle has been in my fridge for over a year easy, from the last case I bought probably two years ago. Four finger white pillowy head that slowly fades down to a transparent golden body. Messy lacing with gobs of the massive head still clinging to the glass. Nose is a Duvel.. heh, smells as good as it always does, pilsner malts, belgian yeast, light hops. Taste is just that, slightly sweet and grassy, very carbonated, greatly balanced. This is the standard I judge other Belgian Strong Pale's by. This brew helped get my alcohol tolance where it is today. :) So one doesn't even phase me anymore. Nice."
"Overall: WOW. This is a damn good beer. Very drinkable."
"Overall: Refreshing quad that's well priced and quite attainable. Definitely worth keeping one around in case the mood strikes."
"d- this beer is just a tad bit too tart for my liking. some of what it's got is good, but I can't really get all that into it. maybe just not my thing. It's not bad, just not what I'd usually choose to drink."
"For those in Louisville or Lexington, Liquor Barn sells these as singles for a dollar, as opposed to the $3 or $4 you'd normally pay or $6 in bars like O'Sheas or Nachtbar. At a buck it's probably one of the best beer values around."
"The white foam whipped to a fine consistency across the surface, a maelstrom of tiny bubbles, cloudy dark straw yellow, yet allowing for visibility of the streaming beads. Focused penetrating power to the nose, lemon and white grapefruit citrus, onion skin, apple, pear and pomegranate fruit, fresh yeast yet to ferment, light mixed baking spices, hoppy without seeming caught in the ""hops versus malts"" dichotomy. Medium-bodied, with the firmness to appear denser and larger. The ginger, clove more evident here, teams up nicely with the lemon, grapefruit citrus. The carbonation nudges more than pushes. Apple, apricot, cherry fruit, more snap than juice. Allusion to honey, grain to granola flavors. While well-paced, there's also a creaminess to absorb any bumps in the road. Pulls it off without any noticeable effort."
"Very drinkable, I really enjoyed this beer, and I could drink lots of this beer."
"Overall its very tasty and very easy to drink."
"Worthy of trying again, think I just got started off on the wrong foot with this brew."
"Duvel is a little overhyped IMHO. This is a very classic pale Belgian strong ale and is what is to be expected and not a lot more."
"The true Champagne of Beers."
"D: Very drinkable. I had no idea when I was drinking it that there was 8.5% abv, I would have guess 5% while I was drinking it. Really nice job on disguising that and since all the flavors blended well, it's definitely worth it."
"Awesome beer that is highly recommended!"
"Super drinkability, esp given the ABV. If anyone needs a cross-over to the world of fine, strong Belgians, hand 'em one of these."
"Just a wonderful drink....I can't wait for next one!!!!"
"Rich sweet light grain, yeast, a little white spice. No indication of alcohol at all, which makes this one unbelievably dangerous to drink. You could knock these back easily, and then try to stand up. Mouthfeel is carbonated and medium-light. Quenching and layered in flavor, a fantastic brew that I haven't had in about 10 years. Shame on me. Gonna make a point to hit this every now and then. Got a single for about $4.00, which is a bargain. Worth every penny, and then some."
"D-Very,very,very drinkable.Wonderful balance,smell and taste.I still can't believe that it's 8.5%!"
"I will be purchasing a couple of large bottles, I'd like to try this again in the near future and aged, as this is an perfect representation of the style."
"D - Beautiful Belgian. It has a high abv so you are getting bang for your buck. Highly drinkable. Enjoy!"
"This beer is smooth, crisp, and very very creamy. Very drinkable."
"Finally getting around to trying this one. It poured a pale cloudy gold with a fluffy two-finger head with a lot of lacing. The smell is fruity with some yeast and a bit of alcohol. The taste starts off with some fruity sweet malt that gives way to some yeastiness that fades into balanced hops and a dry finish with a little alcohol warming, without any overwhelming alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation that provides a very pleasant crispness. An incredibly drinkable beer, especially for the proof. The shining example of the style, a great beer that's a must try for anyone interested in beer."
"One of several New Year's Beers I tasted. Golden color, yeasty and carbonated, heady. Poured into Stella glass. Overall a very good beer, but not great for me. I preferred the Leffe Blonde over this one - to each his/her own I guess. A bit pricey and have enjoyed several others for less."
"It makes me want to move to Belgium."
"Ok, now that I'm done being corny. Incredibly crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Very light. Alcohol isn't in the least bit intrusive. Overall, one of my favorites!"
"Poured into my tulip glass for a slightly seethru gold body that had a voluminous soapy head that was sticky and left lace patches everywhere as it scaled down my glass. A great citric and floral burst in the hops along with fruits usch as orange and pear and hints of sweet malt. Medium-bodied and a little slick, citric hops abound on the tongue and are balance with hints of pepper and spices and a pronounced fruit taste of orange and maybe banana and pear. Also a sweet malt base in the body and even a little bready and chewey. One of the greats to have anytime."
"D- The mouthfeel of this beer makes it incredibly drinkable, especially for a beer with an abv as high as this."
"Well, this is a good brew. Good flavor, great atmosphere, very distinctive soft feel gives it a really solid drinkability. Great quaff. The glass is always important to the atmosphere and presentation, but do yourself a favor and use the tulip."
"D'ability - Moderate body, muted flavors, and dry finish give it the drinkability of a lager."
"D- EXCELLENT!!!"
"tasted great lots of carbonation, but not overpowering though, very smoth, you can def. tast the hops, and maybe a little lemon? and herby."
"330ml bottle. Impressive looking beer when poured. I enjoyed the taste and at first thought it might become a little overwhelming but it wasn't. Extremely drinkable, I couldn't taste the alcohol. Maybe too drinkable, I could see myself having a few of these and some trouble starting. Some people think its overhyped but I really enjoyed it."
"Straw colored with a slight haziness to it. Beautiful head - like looking at pillowy, thick clouds. Produces great lacing to boot. Smells yeasty and fruity with a charcoal like note to it - very inviting. Enters your mouth in very clean fashion with great ""cut"" - the nose follows nicely into the palate. Finishes dry with a slight hop bitterness to it. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This is extremely drinkable and deserves the BA following and high scores. 11.2 ounces disappeared way too fast. Could drink this year round - bravo!"
"D: Scary. I could session this stuff, though I wouldn't be standing afterward. It's deceptive as the complex flavors distract from the relatively high alcohol content. Overall a wonderful beverage and a bottle I will always keep 'in stock'."
"D- Yes, may I have another?"
"I must say.. I had pretty high hopes as I pop opened this beer.. and I come away underwhelmed. The good parts.. comes in a sweet looking bottle unlike anything else, is pretty drinkable and smooth, and the 8.5% ABV is very well hidden. The bad.. has a very bland taste to it.. like really bland. To me it's like a watered down hefeweizen, I was expecting a lot more different types of flavors from this one. I dunno, when I pay $3 for a single 12 oz I want something extraordinary.. and this just doesn't cut it. The Stoudt's Maibock 12 pack I got on clearance for $6.99 has a helluva lot more taste than this. I wanted to love it, but it seems like people reviewing this jumped on the bandwagon and gave it good reviews because everyone else did.. just my 2 cents."
"6/3/7/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"d: This was very good, but I'm not sure I get what all the fuss is about. Great glass though."
"Drinkability. Very high, I forget that I am drinking a strong ale. Would be easy to over do it with this. You'll know you 've had too much when you fall over."
"Beautiful beer in appearance and flavor. Small bottles are just a tease. Make sure you get the larger bottles with the champagne style cork."
"Drinkability. I think this may be one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. Refreshing cool, and plain good. Nice beer."
"Great beer. I was left wanting more of this."
"This is incredibly drinkable but the high ABV makes it very dangerous."
"Overall another very good classic Belgian beer that deserves the praise and great scores. An excellent beer that is readily available. I enjoyed it and will probably keep a bottle or 2 on hand when I want a break from those uber American hop bombs."
"Overall a very good beer, worthy of its status as a ""benchmark"" BSPA. Although I can't say that it's my favorite of the style, it's still a great example and one that every beer-lover should try eventually. Plus, without it, we wouldn't have those sweet Duvel glasses. Anyway, definitely recommended."
"Picked up a corked bottle at Trader Joe's for dinner last night. Poured into two Duvel tulip glasses. Huge white head, all the way up the side of the glass. Looks like a washing machine overflowing. Tons of lacing too. Extremely bright yellow color. Smell was very floral. Duvel tastes unlike any other beer out there. Tons of bubbles really attack your throat. Light and hoppy, heavy and smooth at the same time. You can find yourself drinking this quite easily, but also you can feel that this beer is no joke and certainly has some substance to it and has a bit of alcohol backbone. This is one of the first Belgian beers I have ever had, and will always be one of the best. Also, a great beer to use to introduce anyone to Belgian brews, because I don't think anyone could find fault with this beer."
"Pours a incredible pale amber color with an extremely frothy white head. Head also has great lacing. The aroma has a complex equation of hops, citrus and malt. The taste is so frecken delicious that this stuff should be banned. Has a great amount of carbonation that tickels the tounge. Is a light bodied beer that packs a punch at a whoping 8.5%. reat drinability. I think i found my new desert island beer."
"I worked my way through 3 very enjoyable bottles dissecting this one; overall it is a very well put together beer. I took off a point for taste, simply because I prefer a different type, but I may revisit this later. It is tough to argue with someone who says this is a perfect example of a Strong Pale Ale."
"(rated Mar 22, 2007)"
"Note on glassware: I tasted this a few months ago in a standard pint glass. Tulip glass made a distinct difference in aroma and taste (as it should for this ale)"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Both are good"
"D= decent. For some reason I just don't think i enjoyed the taste of this one as much as everyone else so that would defer me a little bit. Also the price is very high so I prolly couldn't afford to drink to many and last but not least the booze would take me down quickly."
"Mouthfeel - ultra-light from the high carbonation while smooth and watery. A slightly course finish from the alcohol which quickly dissipates."
"Bottle. Maybe a little too much hype. Pours clear gold with the big white, fluffy head. Aroma is yeasty and sweet with sugar. Taste is the same, kind of like a tripel. Very rich and strong flavors, maybe too much. Its really good, but I don't really want it again."
"The alcohol is incredibly masked on this one, as I'd be sure I was drinking something more along the lines of the 5.5-6 range. Though after a few sips you do begin to get a nice warming feeling. While decorated and well constructed, the flavor isn't my favorite, perhaps a bit too tart."
"Drinkability: is very very high too high for a 8.5% hah"
"Pours a nice slightly hazy golden color with a huge foamy white head. Very carbonated almost champagne like but not overpowering if poured correctly. Aroma of light crisp fruits and spice. Flavor consists of apple, pear, and light raisin as well as a nice alcohol presence. A great tasting belgian strong ale."
"Drinkability: At 8.50 ABV, this is like drinking water, an excellent balance of hops and overall satisfaction, I can easily polish alot of these off yet at such a high ABV, it feels like your drinking a lite beer. This is a classic beer that I'm glad I finally tried and look forward to having again in the future!"
"D - Really a fabulous beverage, one of my favorite for sure"
"This is my favorite Belgian beer. One for me is just fine."
"The mouthfeel is quite carbonated but smooth with a medium body. Overall, I think this beer is quite drinkable although I'm afraid to see what happens if I had several of them, because of the alcohol content. It is quite good and I will enjoy this again in the future."
"D: This is now (I say this way too oft) my favorite beer. It's damn delicious, light enough to be drinkable yet isn't forgettable. It packs a nice alcohol punch but on the down-low...it's so effortless. My absolute favorite of favorites...."
"This beer has pretty good drinkability. I probably prefer to sip rather than down it, but it is well balanced and worth spending a little bit of time enjoying. As beer goes, it tastes a little bit like a very dry champagne, but the sweet grape flavors are replaced by sweet malt and yeast characteristics."
"Overall: A good beer, not mind-blowing for me. It's definitely worth a try if you get a chance."
"Drinkability: Rather drinkable despite the 8.5% ABV. A respectable stalwart member of the classic Belgians."
"Bright golden color, not very cloudy, surprisingly large head and exceptionally strong lacing (it never faded, it was still on the glass in the morning). Nice hops background, slightly yeasty taste, and a sunny feeling in the mouth. I could drink a few of these if they were available."
"One of the best Belgians. The head is simply gigantic and it is a Belgian Strong Pale that lives up to the color part of that name. It's a light yellow beer, and the head is sterile white in color. It's also an entirely wonderful head. It's like the most aggressive bubble bath in the world. There are large and small bubbles that pile atop one another and take ages to settle away. The smell is all Belgian. It's earthy and spicy and perfectly blended with the alcohol. The flavor is tart and earthy, like eating a sour apple while sitting in hay. The good folks at Duvel make phenomenal beer. God bless the Flemish."
"Overall, this is just a damn good beer, and I will more than gladly drink it again. It just makes me wonder why I took so long to try it."
"By far one of my top three Belgian beers. It has an outstanding gold-colored body with a very faint smell of fruit. What I enjoy about Duvel is that the taste is incredibly smooth with only a very small amount of fruitiness, yeast and alcohol. This is definitely a beer that should slowly be enjoyed over time and is good with every sip."
"Overall one of my favorite sippers."
"very nice tasting beer. Kind of fruity taste. The only problem is that my buddy bought a 4 pack and 3 of the 4 as soon as opening them overflowed terribly. Why is that with this beer. If it wasnt for that this would be a regular in our beer fridge. now im not sure of getting this one again."
"Duvel should be savored with each sip. It's obvious care and effort went into this delicate brew. I can't believe an ale of this golden hue can have so much sweetness and flavor. Truely reminded me of my breif time in Germany."
"I could drink this 24/7."
"Post Script- the branded glasses are Highly Recommended as well. Well worth the price."
"D: Aside from the alcohol overtones, this is a delicious brew."
"The carbination combined with the twang of the alcohol scream champange but the secondary flavors say otherwise. The alcohol is subtle with an applesauce hint which is masked by a wheaty bitterness and wonderful amount of alcohol. A unique balanced beer that I would love to discover in the back of my fridge."
"Just a great beer. I was craving some last night but the store I picked it up at didn't have it cold, so am enjoying it tonight. Should never go very long without filling my Duvel tulip with its namesake."
"Anyway, short story long, this is a beer not to be missed. Very drinkable - if not frat-boy material - but it definitely drinks softly and carries a big stick. A really big 8.5 stick. Not overly sweet like a barley wine but certainly not weak like your average mass-produced Belgian. Use with caution. Perfect for forgetting one of ""those days"" at the office. Just don't plan on leaving the house."
"Theatrics aside, this truly is a phenomenal beer. Poured properly and into the right glass, the lacing is uniquely tenacious (not to mention gorgeous) and the nutty head persists for HOURS. It truly looks appetizing like no other in a tulip. It smells great as well. A fair bit of alcohol in the nose. Whats truly exceptional about the beer is its mouthfeel and drinkability. at 8.5% it really is a devil, and the alcohol is hidden so well that it will put you under the table if you choose to session it. Its perfectly carbonated and even sweet on the tongue, and leaves just a slight crispy finish coupled with enough alcohol to make you want to dive right back in. It tends to be prohibitively expensive to drink on a super regular basis, but on occasion its a tremendous treat. Miller High Life's slogan has always been a joke, THIS is the champagne of beer."
"D- Quite. I'd have two if I had two."
"What a difference...review updated accordingly.."
"D = A great easy drinker, come back again and again."
"D- Very high, I would have no problem going through a couple more."
"Duvel is a classic for a reason. There's nothing else quite like it."
"Picked up a 750ml bottle. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours a beautiful golden yellow. Thick foamy head with good retention. Leaves a nice coat of lace on the glass. It's got a nice aroma; fruit, wheat and spice. The taste is a real crisp and has a wonderful bite to it. Tastes like it smells, with fruit and spice and some nice bitterness. The alcohol is noticable and that is something I like. The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and a little bubbly. This is a very easy beer to drink and I enjoy the heck out of it."
"The taste followed with clean sweet malt flavors, yeast spiciness and some fruitiness (maybe some berry?), crisp hop bite. This was definitely very smooth and drinkable for its ABV, very balanced. Nicely carbonated and a classic gateway beer for people just getting into the craft beer scene."
"Beer added in oct. 2007, review translated from french 11-11-2008."
"Has a sweet floral aroma. Body is golden yellow in color. Taste is slightly bitter, and the palate is slightly fizzy. Good, but I've had better Belgian ales. Kind of a let down, maybe it was hyped up too much to me."
"D: A complex character brimming with delicate intricacies makes Duvel a pleasure to explore."
"D- This beer is super yummy. I'd drink it often if my budget were larger and the abv weren't so high. The abv doesnt bother me, it's just a bit high for daily drinking."
"I just poured this clear golden brew into one of my favorite glasses. The head is white with a little bit of coloration on the individual bubbles if I look closely enough. A slightly sweet aroma creeps out of the glass. The taste is crisp clean and refreshing. Mountain streams are envious, it's that good. I'll use this as a benchmark for other beers of the type from here on out."
"D: Despite picking up on the alcohol flavor, it masks the 8.5% well. Definitely will have it again."
"ANYONE WHO CAN FIND THIS EVEN IF ITS EXPENSIVE AS MINE WAS ($15 FOR A 4 PACK I THINK) MAKE SURE YOU TRY IT, THIS BEER IS NOT ONLY VERY INTRESTING BUT SMOOTH LIKE BUTTER."
"Overall - A classic, and quite unique, Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel: Very full frothy and smooth."
"Duvel is still one of the most amazing beers I've ever had. What else is there to say?"
"Pours a beautiful golden hue with enormous ice cream cone head. A sweet aroma of lemon zest and alcohol. Tastes of lemon zest, fruit tang, alcohol takes over the palate for a bit, and ends with some nice lemon sweetness. A good carbonation that doesn't attack the tongue but settles on it comfortably creates a very enjoyable drinking experience. Amazing looks, great aroma complimented by great taste equals a great-genre defining beer."
"A nice bubbly aftertaste, but overall I think this beer is a bit overated compared to other belgian beers."
"Taste is amazing. Fruit. Cloves. Pepper. Saaz hops. Sooo smooth. Dainty light body that manages to haul tremendous flavor. This goes down too easily. Great gateway beer to craft brew."
"This is an amazing belgain ale, and probably the best one I've had."
"An amazing beer that I could drink all night or have a snifter of."
"Quite drinkable due to the true value proposition of lightness against the full flavor profile."
"All things considered, I'm still relatively new at the beer tasting game. However, I've found my high point. This is what the rest are going to get compared to, and I don't see how its going to be surpassed any time soon."
"D: very drinkable for its alcohol content"
"I poured this beer into my Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours a light golden color with a huge fluffy white head. Smells crisp and fruity. The taste is incredibly smooth, heavily carbonated, fruity and alcohol and is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly, incredibly smooth. Drinkability is exceptional and is only hindered by the high abv. Overall an amazing beer."
"D: As Lionel so eloquently stated: All night long."
"The look of this beer is phenomenal. It pours a nice golden yellow with a thick white cap upon it. When sniffed I got a yeasty bready smell and nothing more, it smelled quite brut. The taste was simply boozy and nothing that I thought was too remarkable, but I'd be idiotic to not mention that it's flavor is remarkably clean- despite how weird it sounds after saying it was unremarkable. I kind of felt as thought I was drinking a cocktail. it also could have something to do with the temperature at which it was served, but I did warm it with my hands and had the same feelings about it. In the mouth it has crazy carbonation which I didn't mind at all. Its quite comparable to a brut champagne in my mind. When it comes to drinkability the beer is okay, it's light on flavor and has more kick than a line of Rockette's. I really would like to give this beer another try though."
"A: As soon as I popped the cap I had a foam over, though the label identifies it as a golden ale it is more of an anemic yellow, the head shows serious signs of staying power and has a dense cottony quality to it - 3.50, S: Spicy aroma, somewhat grassy and earthy, a faint sign of bubble gum, a very mellow yet pleasing aroma - 4.25, T: A powerful palate, quite dry, some bitter hops, rum soaked raisins which translates into noticeable alcohol - 4.00, M: Following the path of the taste, this one is dry - 4.00, D: It is hard not to be swayed by Duvel's solid reputation as the standard of the style and my distant memories which put this beer on a pedestal, and granted I do enjoy the beer and think it is nicely crafted but it just doesn't live up to all of this - 4.00"
"I could drink this beer rain or shine."
"Pours beautifully, smells deep and rich, like a clean and tasty version of walking into an underground cellar. I can't remember a beer that I enjoyed more in terms of flavor, it's a cornucopia of complexity, but it's not so strong as to be offensive. This is a beer I could drink all night, if it weren't for the price tag."
"A golden god. This beer is sooo good. You cannot believe it's 8.5% ABV because of the color and smooth finish of this beer. A pale ale that has the punch of an imperial IPA. Great beer, will absolutely buy this again."
"Nice, full body. It feels odd to feel the creaminess with the bitterness."
"D - This one will sneak up on you. It's a lighter than expected colored beer for the alcohol level. Hence, the Devil."
"As my glass emptied, prior to being served my appetizer, I gladly looked at the waiter and said, ""Thank you, sir. May I have another!"""
"M&D--I hate carbonation. I like a beer that tastes like a door after you remove the hinges--a thudding flatness. But the devil won me over, as the bubbles make it more champagne-like than astringent. Absolutely refreshing and absolutely drop you on the floor potent at the same time. Not many beers can say that--this is a creeper not to be trifled with, and more or less embodies this website's injunction to ""respect beer."" Good God does damnation taste fine."
"A world class beer for sure, but not my favorite Belgian style. But I can still appreciate the hell out of it, aroma especially."
"Purchase the 750ml bottle with freshness date from local TJ's store. Poured into a Duvel tasting glass golden yellow color with nice looking carbonation and big creamy white head. The nose is malty sweet, yeast, slight hoppiness, clovey spice, with an alcohol bite. The taste and mouthfeel are unique. First the beer is extremely well balanced and mellow given the alcohol content. The beer is yeasty which are characteristic Belgian ales. Medium bodied and refreshing with a dry finish. Excellent drinkability due to the balance and refreshing factor, but the alcohol might catch up to you."
"Overall I expected more from this beer due to its reviews. Dont get me wrong its very drinkable, but I would rather choose something else."
"D- Goes down extremely well for an 8.5 beer."
"Drinkability: At 8.5 with all this carbonation you best drink it slow, but it is near perfection."
"Perfecta"
"A great beer, but not as drinkable as the really spectacular ones. Might try and cellar some to see if it takes the edge off a little."
"Pours a fizzy straw color into a goblet, with a rough head about a half finger in width, and lots of carb action that make this entertaining to look at. Aroma is of orange, banana bread, yeasty breadiness, orange, and a little bit of plum. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, with abundant carbonation slicing through. Taste is tart, orangy with yeast and a slight hint of banana in the middle, fades to some smooth citrus hop bitterness at the end. Overall, a unique brew."
"D: This was really good. I have not had one in a while. Bought a 4 pack with the glass I am drinking from for like $13 which was a steal. I tend to overlook Duvel but it is a really good beer. I think I will grab some 750s and throw them in the dark for a while."
"This is a masterpiece."
"Wow. What a fantastic beer. Poured into a North Coast snifter. Its a clear as day gold with a frothy white head. The aroma is subtle but sweet - not too revealing. It is still mysterious at this point. The taste is just awesome - clear, fresh, refined - it goes down like love in a glass. Nice carbonation, too. Totally drinkable - tastes like heaven and the alcohol is masked remarkably well. This may be my favorite lighter beer (I'm usually a fan of imperial stouts and IPAs). I'm about to drink a Chimay after this one to compare. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"mmm my favorite in ths style, amazing flavor, excelent look & aroma. in mouth invites me to... take the next!. like michael said ""the devil of a beer"" please enjoy it listening the miles davis ""Doo-bop"" record. Uff!"
"Prost!"
"Taste is superb: hoppy and bitter, with a bit of sweetness. At 8.5% you can definitely taste the alcohol, so this one's a sipper, but that makes savoring it all the better. Some spicy and citrusy notes from the yeast are complimented by a solid bitterness. Other reviewers have commented on how Duvel tastes almost like a wine or champagne, and I'd have to agree with them-- hard to describe, you've got to try it to know what we're talking about (maybe the acidity?). Incredibly smooth mouthfeel and a sparkling carbonation. Really a treat: liquid gold. Be careful though, it's devilish."
"Finally, the potency of the brew becomes fully apparent, and the drinking experience encompasses your temples as well. Your whole face is seduced by this stuff. Devil's brew, indeed."
"This one is a great pale golden yellew with a huge creamy white everlasting trademark head. It also leaves lace clinging to everything. One of the best looking beers I've seen to date. The nose is also very good displaying light colored orchard fruit mainly pears, spicey yeast in the form of clove and pepper and some earthy almost musty hop presance as well. The taste is again pears and spice with some alcohol apearing as well. The mouthfeel is both light and crisp form the carbination and creamy all at the same time. I really could drink this stuff endlessly if it wasn't 8.5."
"The end note of this beer is clean and hoppy. I enjoyed it greatly and will enjoy the other three in my closet. Here's to Duvel, ""one devil of a beer."""
"An excellent beer, very refreshing. If not for the alcohol content and to an extent the price, I could drink this all day."
"Very loud taste is not as mellow as I would like. Great beer none the less."
"D: Very, another wonderful brew."
"D: I can drink a lot of this or rather i'd like to drink a lot of it, but the ABV is a bit much and thus it loses a point."
"D- Drinks well for 8.5%ABV. At least it gets me drunk quickly"
"Rating : A"
"Looks can be deceiving... this pours a light, slightly clouded straw color with a head that pours thick and falls back rather quickly to about a quarter inch with bubbly, fast lacing. It smells of malt with notes of lemon meringue. Taste is malty with hints of white sugar and a tartness on the backsides of the tongue. Finishes with flavors of lemon and mild hops. Has a great mouthfeel and appropriate carbonation. This one goes down oh so well."
"D. Highly drinkable i wish i had more of this. The alcohol is hidden quite masterfully too. Try this!"
"M/D: Light to medium bodied. Dry. Pretty easy to drink. A really good beer. I think I expected a little more, but it is still darn good."
"Extremely quafable, at over 8% avb, a dangerous ale."
"This is a classic. If you haven't tried it yet, get on it!"
"Overall: didn't hate it, but didn't love it either. I'll let my tastes continue to develop and have it again in a year or so."
"PROST"
"this is the belgian that got me into the stile and i am breaking into my birthday gift set. this is light and furity with some fine sour notes at the end, the alchoal is hiden well in this one but it will sneek up on you. this is an almost perfuct beer. the only porblem with this one is that once it is in my glass it is onaly an avrage of three sips befor this one is finished. top shelf for sure!"
"Just an awesome beer."
"6/11/2005. Wow, this was an interesting beer to sample. Pours a hazy golden color with a huge, thick, creamy white head. Almost out of control and the fluffy head sits on top of the beer forever. The aroma was a little fruity with a touch of malt. Somewhat sweet tasting, fruity with malts and a bitter bite to let you know there's alcohol in it. First time I had this I expected one of those refreshing type of summer beers, which obviously it's not. Good beer."
"Poured from the stubby bottle into the tallest tupip style glass I had. A few years back I tried one of these at Three Birds in Corning NY but didn't know what i was geting into. Even back then I knew it was something special. The head was awesome as was the smell. The taste was strong and smooth and the drinkability was good even though it is somewhat heavy and strong. Delicious."
"Poured out of the bottle with a tremendous creamy head. Fantastic retention of the thick cap; clumps of it stick to the glass. Hazy pale straw gold. Aromas of light yeast, green apples, assorted spices. Very, very drinkable and the 8.5% is almost impossible to taste. Medium/high carbonation, medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Refreshing. Clean and crisp, slightly bitter and lacking the in-your-face sweetness of other high ALC% beers. Some fruity malt esters in the middle. Great balance. Amazingly quaffable for as potent as it is. Each sip makes you want another. Complex yet a beer I would recommend to any beer drinker. Stunning. This is deserving of its reputation of being one of the worlds best. I have to say, It lacks nothing and has everything. One of the best beers I have ever had if not the."
"paired with aged cheddar grazier and cranberry white cheddar, deliciously"
"12oz bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Aged about a year, March 2010 expiry date. Pours a cloudy light yellow with lots of carbonation and decent head. Decent grassy, slightly funky aroma. Flavour is solid and full. Belgian yeastiness up front, leading to a rounded fruitiness. A bit of lemon. Ends with a light peppery spiciness. Similarities to Unibroue beers. Great lacing. Nice."
"Very good beer, high drinkability"
"D- Action on this makes it a great pub brew. Retains its Belgian quilities for a long time. Great to sit with during lenghty interaction with friends. Nice! Relax and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable especially for the 8.5% abv. We've all heard the name and there is a reason its reputation proceeds it."
"I have forgotten how good this beer was, since it is so widely available, but this has reminded me its not something to overlook."
"D - Way to easy to drink you can get in trouble with this one quickly drinks easily that you have to remember its abv has a very good taste as well worth trying"
"Even aside from the high ABV the drinkability is excellent. Everything from the appearance to the taste exudes quality."
"Drinkability- Nice all around style of beer."
"D: This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. The taste never gets old, it's so well balanced as to keep me wanting more. The only limiting factor is the alcohol content, don't plan on driving or doing anything else while enjoying this beer. I have a new favorite, and plan to drink a lot more of this in the future."
"Pours a clear pale yellow, with a medium, white head. The massive lacing is the only part of the appearance that doesnt look like that of a Macro Lager. Smells of cinnamon, alcohol and Belgian Yeast. The taste is very light, toasty malt, with a nice spicy yeast profile. You can also taste a hint of alcohol. Nice bitterness from the hops to balance things out that also imparts a tiny earthy flavor in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, carbonation is very high from the bottle conditioning. Very drinkable and refreshing. A great treat that I wish was available in Oklahoma."
"Poured a 11.2oz beer into a Duvel Tulip. This beer is perfection when it comes to its appearance. Duvel poured into its proper glassware pours a golden straw yellow with a big, almost overwhelming white head that leaves huge spots of sticky lacing. The glass replenishes the head always leaving about a half an inch worth of head on the beer at all times. The aroma is slightly yeasty with hints of green apple. The taste is bready satisfaction up front. Green apple esters and almost a peppery flavor come out also. The mouthfeel is light bodied with ample carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"overall very enjoyable. I'll have another. We'll be getting this one on anniversaries now instead of champange THANK GOD ! Hail to the beer gods"
"Pours a clearish straw yelow with the trademark Duvel head. The foam lasts quite a while and leaves copious lacing. Smells of citrus and pear, with a bit of hop character and slight alcohol. Heavily (too) sweet. Citrus and other light fruits are again present in the taste, but the hops come forward to add some bitterness. The sweetness is still rather overstated. Some spice, and big alcohol. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. Not really a fan of this one at all; the ever-present sweet pear taste combined with the alcohol just aren't appealing. I've had this many, many times; it was a cheap nachtwinkel beer in BE that did the job. As a proper beer though, it's bad enough that I sometimes seriously consider pouring it."
"Extremely impressive beer and absolutely worthy of the accolades. It's strong in all areas."
"The ample carbonation creates a satiating feel, but remains light and airy making for a dangerous combination with the abv. The grass and hay combine with a lemon citrus for a quick zip of flavor that rounds out to a dry and spiced finish. It is no wonder that it is copied by so many."
"D- I wish I had another."
"Despite the 8.5%, I didn't find the alcohol to be much of a problem, but I also took my time with it."
"Notes: Watch how fast you pour!!!"
"D - It is good but I'd personally rather sit down with a Lucifer"
"Overall - Wow this is astonishingly drinkable for an 8.5% abv beer. Quite different from what I expected. The pilsener taste was a pleasant surprise. I'd say this could be a white wine substitute. Substantial enough to complement a pizza or an Italian sausage or could very well be paired with some fish or grilled chicken. Swirling the bottle and adding yeast gives it a whole new level of complexity and added cloudiness to the glass. The alcohol will catch up to you so if you bought a 750 mL like I did, please enjoy it with a special someone. As the temperature increases, so does complexity and detectability of the alcohol. I will definitely buy again and see how it ages."
"Edit: My 50th review! Milestone"
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a one finger thick, cloudlike head with great retention that leaves patchy lacing, absolutely gorgeous begging to be drank. Banana, vanilla and some spice aromas blend nicely. Up front banana flavor mix with a lemon hop bitterness that give may to caramel and a creamy vanilla with a hoppy finish and aftertaste. Medium high carbonation, light body, there is a seltzer water clean mouthfeel. Great drinkability, would love another."
"Pours a golden color with a very thick, frothy head. Carbonation is apparent and lots of lacing. It smells of yeast, hops, with some hops. The taste starts out bitter, medicinal. Then it gives way to some sweet malts and a sort of sauvignon blanck-type flavor. The mouthfeel is interesting--carbonated and crisp but later its almost powdery. This is a drinkable beer but watch out--the ABV will sneak up on you."
"There is no sense in saying I'm being objective here. I've had this beers dozens of times, loved it every time, and its a favorite. So I know its good, know its a classic, and rightly give it an excellent rating."
"D-Luscious. This is a heavy weight in my book under the Belgian Strong Pale Ale classification. The complexity is beyond impressive. Much brighter than other BSPA's but not weak in any category. Takes time to pour properly and gets better as it warms up."
"D - @ 8.5% alcohol I would normally say only 1 or 2, but I could drink these all day/night. I think I'm in lust."
""
"Drinkability - This one is a highly seductive sipper. No heaviness to it makes it so easy to consume, but be careful of the abv as you'll have no idea when it starts kicking around in your head. I make it a point to come back to this one often."
"A good all around brew."
"One of the finest Belgian beers available in the USA."
"D: Highly drinkable despite high alcohol content. I fully understand the praise that is lavished on this fine beer now."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Nice flavors make this beer easy to consume. Alcohol is moderately high, but does not interrupt the drinking experience."
"This is my second time trying Duvel. I might buy it again depending on my mood. I prefer ales with a little more robust flavor and deeper character. Overall, not too bad for the style."
"If you haven't tried it, do so."
"The beer pours a light golden with a pillowy white head that holds beautifully and leaves as much lace as possible on the side of the glass. The aroma is full of bready malts, golding hops, and spicy phenols. The taste recounts all of these aromas, a wonderful spiciness from the yeast and hops and meanwhile the malty sweetness and breadiness balances beautifully. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with massive carbonation. Overall, a great beer. East to drink with plenty of flavor. Could pair well with almost any food."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. Easy to drink, but watch out for the alcohol - it'll catch you in beer that tastes this good, is this balanced and easy to drink."
"D - A bit spicy for me but very good and very easy to drink."
"D- A very good beer and a good change of pace."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz pint glass. Followed the directions on the bottle ""pour slowly"". Slow, gentle pour yields a nice tight 1 finger head with good retention. Head shrinks to a thin skim of tiny bubbles. Not much of a smell light malt and perhaps a hint of citrus. Taste is nice light, hints of citrus and light malt, light hop bittering. Very fine and prevalent carbonation. Finnish is nice dry and crisp. Mouth feel is creamy and light. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a very nice beer."
"Definitely a top notch beer."
"D: Could easily sit around a drink a few beers, I it will be a great summer beverage."
"As belgian strong ales go, this one is very different than one would suspect. The normal flavors many associate with Belgian strong ales are not as prominent. Bannana/bubblegum tones from the wheat and yeast, candy-like fruity sugars,etc. This is not La Fin Du Monde or a Trappist beer. The malt flavor is more toward the pilsner or pale lager taste spectrum. That being said, it's really drinkable and I really liked the black pepper spiciness. And trust me, It is way more complex than most pilsner/pale lagers. It just looks beautiful in a glass with a crystal-clear pale golden color and a huge foamy white head. There's a good amount of bitterness and complexity but the sweetness you'd normally get in such a high ABV is just not there. I'd love to try a beer that is similar to Duvel in taste. The taxonomy ""Belgian Strong Ale"" (given on an different beer rating site) mislead me but I was stil pleased with the beer. If I had seen Belgian Strong 'Pale' Ale it might have made more sense on my first tasting."
"I enjoy the fruit notes and clean malt, love the creamy mouthfeel."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer poured a rich pale golden color with a light, white, but thick head that lasted awhile. The aroma was hops, yeast with a hint of spice and fruit. The taste was very good. I was actually expecting it to be weaker from its color, but it really came through for me. Great flavor, yeast and some spices. The high carbonation worked very well with the beer and I think made it all the more enjoyable. The beer was clean, high drinkability and I will be enjoying this one all summer long."
"Du drink, duvel."
"M/D-It had a bubbly taste and should be enjoyed slowly. This is s great ale that I would try again."
"($4.45, 11.2oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"Much to my surprise, immediately after opening the bottle overflowed, but once poured into the glass had a nice strong 1+ cm head that lasted for the whole 20-30 minute drinking session. The beer was a bit clearer than I had expected but had a wonderful nose, that was inviting me to enjoy it. It poured wonderfully over the palate with a fruity and spicy finish. The beer continued to fizz in my mouth. Overall a stelar beer, one I would buy more often if not for the cost."
"Pours a beautiful golden with a huge rocky head. The head stops forming after a few seconds but never settles. Aroma of yeast and pears. The taste is unreal, light crisp slightly sweet with a little tartness. Mouth feel is the perfect mix of slight CO2 sensation and pillowy head. Drinkability? If I could survive on duvel I would try..."
"Overall, an excellent Belgian Ale, worthy of its status as a classic. Recommended."
"RJR"
"A standard setting BSPA."
"D - Fantastic beer, this is a great summer night beer and deserve the honor of one of the best beers."
"Very drinkable... Could be scary on a warm summer afternoon.."
"Savor this beer, as it is one of the best on Earth."
"Ok, I don't mean to seem a sucker, but this beer is almost impossible to fault. It's creamy, delicious, and aromatic beyond belief. I'll be having many more bottles of this stuff in the future..."
"D - One to be savored, I think. High abv, a bit heavy, but still damn tasty."
"This one was a gusher with a head that would not die, white and huge. Pale yellow color, cloudy, obviously bubbly. Spicy aroma with a flavor to match. Alcohol is not present which is surprising given that it is close to nine percent. This is tasty and easy to drink but not really my speed."
"D: For how strong in alcohol it is, Duvel is extremely drinkable. It's got the best mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had, and is a thoroughly enjoyable all-around drinking experience."
"One for the ages!"
"Pours very light, almost white. Has that classic, massive head. Malty, floral aroma. Flavors of citrus, spices, and aromatic hops. Smooth finsish with a hint of bitterness, with some noticeable spice. Well balanced, medium carbonation. Overall, a classic Belgian."
"If I were a rich man, Duvel would be my go-to drink."
"D - Easily drinkable with a nice hop character. The apple and DMS seem out of place, but I know this bottle has been well cared for. I will have to give this another chance in the near future to see if it can live up to my memories of it being a much better beer."
"One of the best beers I have ever had. Looks exceptional with the huge white head over the golden body. Aroma was of citus and pine, a little weaker than some. Taste and mouthfeel both reminded me of dry champagne as there was definitely some fruitiness and tartness. For the mouthfeel the carbonation was off the charts reminding me of a drink from an old fashioned soda fountain. Finishes dry with a yeasty bread aftertaste. Exceptional beer."
"A great beer that went well with pan seared halibut."
"I wish I had another."
"I suppose if I were to define what Belgian beer means to me then this would be it - though of course that idea is really wrong since styles vary so widely. Nonetheless, there is perhaps one style that identifies a nation more than others. This to me is it. It also has its own goblet. Gabe at Two Brothers seemed to be on a mission to educate us late one evening and started opening various Belgians. Pale yellow and slightly hazy in the glass, the noticeable thing is the head like a meringue that lasts the entire time: such fine structure and density; amateurs beware when pouring. Aromatic and raisiny aroma. Excellent slightly sweet aromatic palate but with complexity and biscuit, yeasty earthy components. Savour and enjoy slowly. We are beginning to warm to that tiny nation's products."
"D= This is a world class beer that is the benchmark of its style. I liked it the first time, and love it more every time I have it!!!"
"drinkability- Hands down the best beer I have ever had. Was fortunate to have a friend recommend this to me at a restaurant while out of town and fell in love. A perfect combination of taste and strength. This is a beer you must respect or else it will donkey punch you. This is the closest thing to walking sex I have ever had."
"Very good Belgian strong pale and worthy of the high regard in which it's held."
"D - A brew to be savored and enjoyed... An extremely gratifying experience... Two or three on a relaxing evening would make for a wonderful night..."
"Drinkability- It took me a while to get into this beer, but I didn't have trouble putting down the 750 bottle. I can see myself getting this again sometime in the future."
"D-Very easy to drink very good beer overall deserves all the praise its gotten."
"I had Duvel once before, but regretfully I was fairly intoxicated when I got to it. The one thing I remember was it's phenolic character and that still stands out to me upon soberly revisiting this ale tonight. A good brew no doubt, but at least slightly overrated. Tastes a lot like Ommegang's Hennepin to me, only less complex."
"D-this brew is remarkably drinkable for such a high AVB,this Belgian offering is the Bee's Knees!"
"Then the real fun comes with the taste. It is a perfect tasting beer with a bit of citrus flavor and goes down so smooth. Just remember with the large head you will get a beer mustache!"
"Pours a five+ finger white head that takes forever to fade and leaves a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet citric nose. Flavor is balanced, slightly dry and has a citric fruitiness. $9.99 for a 750ml bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH. Best by Sep 2010."
"Its got a very thick, white and bubbly head about two fingers thick and has lots of carbonation. The body is crystal clear and a pale golden color and is very nice to look at. It smells like dry hops mixed in with some citrus fruits and spices, I also pick up some hints of banana bread in there. It rolls on to your tongue pretty smoothly with a light semi-crisp feel to it, it has a medium body, but it is a bit more on the lighter side of the house. It's a bit bitter overall with some sweet undertones and a tangy aftertaste, the alcohol is very well hidden you can't even taste it in its aftertaste."
"Duvel is certainly the real champagne of beers in that it has many qualities of a beer and champagne (which obviously comes as no surprise). Honestly, I cannot stand champagne but enjoy this beer a great deal. My personal tastes wants a little more malt but this beer is certainly opening up the Belgian gates for my palate. I look forward to more of these and picking up more Belgian staples."
"D - it's a strong one as the style would suggest, but it's quite smooth and easy to drink."
"D: absolutely delicious - one to savor sip by sip, and do sip slowly, because it can kick ass. The alcohol is high and toward the end of the beer, it is quite predominant - letting one know that one of these is probably enough. Spread out the enjoyment."
"Duvel is clearly all that it's cracked up to be. I was initially skeptical of its ""Top 100"" status, but I was gladly proved wrong. This is a stellar beer. It could be slightly improved with beefing up the nose a bit. But, it's still not to be missed. Highly recommended."
"Pours a medium yellow, with a huge fluffy white head that just keeps coming. Smells of apple and grass. Tastes of apple, pear, white wine, herbs, and a bunch of other flavors I just can't put my finger on. A great blend of flavor--nothing sticks out and disrupts the harmony. Lots of carbonation, but not too much. Very drinkable."
"Not sure I would chance more than one of these - it would certainly sneak up on you. But a wonderful beer and glad I finally had a chance to try it."
"The taste is light, mostly sweet with a light bitterness that is more sharp and spicey than truly bitter. It has light fruit, banana, spiciness, a hint of toasted grain, light yeastiness, and a pleasant, smooth alcoholic quality and warmth. The palate is light but rather full and quite soft."
"Poured into a Duvel snifter a nice hazy pale yellow with a great frothy head. Aroma is sweet malt, coriander and spice. The taste is a wondeful blend of sweet fruits, bubblegum and a nice yeast bite. The beer is crisp and surprisingly light with just the right amount of carbonation and well hidden alcohol. This one is very enjoyable, but is certainly one to be careful with."
"Overall, a favorite of mine that I always go back to. The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect in my mind."
"Drinkability: Good example of a Belgian SPA... Ist it worthy of the hype?.... maybe the jury is still out on that one..."
"Altogether, this is a great beer and a nice change of pace for me. I'll definitely add this one to my list of favorites."
"D: Could drink many of these, but be careful!"
"One 11.2 oz bottle was $4. 36 cents per oz."
"D: Not bad, I could definitely have another."
"Rich golden with lasting white head served in the trappist glass. Smell is yeasty a bit with a corn like malt aroma. It is highly carbonated, refreshing simple and drinkable with a slightly spiced yeast character. The alchohol is well hidden for 8.5%. Decent."
"Beautiful bright Belgian ale. I got this in a 4 pack with its own signature tulip glass and coasters. ""nice"" Appearance is a light yellow/straw color with a thick head. very bubbely like champagne. the smell was of light crisp malts,pear and floral hops. flavor is wonderful,crisp and refreshing. notes of green apple, pear and herbal citrusy hops. very clean and drinkable, pilsner like but with a little more complexity. very drinkable but with 8.5% abv it could lead one into temptation."
"750 mL bottle into a snifter glass. Bright pale golden color. Dense creamy white head that last forever. So pillow-y that I just want to lay on it. Smells of many fruits. Some apple comes through with a small touch of lemon zest. A sorta musky smell to it too which i assume comes from the yeast. Light body with medium to high carbonation. This is a spicy/acidic beer with a slight bitter finish. Leaves the mouth crisp and clean. I think the taste is pretty one dimensional, not that interesting."
"Overall, I'm not a huge Belgian fan, but this is pretty nice."
"The high ABV cuts down on drinkability along with the high price. An extravegant and rare purchase for me."
"This is so easily drunk, it's not funny. One of the best offerings out of Belgium, and could easily sway drinkers to the premium way."
"I'd say this is definitely a session beer, but you'd have to build your tolerance up a bit as it packs a punch at 8.5% abv."
"Cheers"
"This poured a clear gold with fluffy white head, like a typical light Belgian ale. It smelled like sour yeast and lemon hops. It tasted like muted grapefruit bitterness and yeast sweetness, with no depth or real character. It was slightly thick with mild carbonation and a weak aftertaste. Overall this was a mediocre example of a beer style I don't really like; not worth drinking again."
"I could drink this stuff all the time, but I would just become spoiled."
"Unbelievable. Bottle-conditioned into a Duvel glass. Thick, frothy head with great retention -- huge stickiness. Smells of apples, yeast, and fruits. Flavor delivers on all odors. Heavily carbonated and crisp. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming. A great classic!"
"This classic pours a pale yellow with a mountainous head. lace stays and head lasts eons. Nose is floral, yeasty. Taste is nice and smooth with great floral taste, and some appley crisp taste. awesome taste. mouthfeel could be thicker, but is still quite good. Drinkability here is second to none. Excellent beer. Excellent. If there ever was a ""session belgian"" which makes no sense to me, this is it."
"I would certainly drink more than one of these but it wouldn't take many to sense inebriation rapidly approaching. This is a very good Belgian pale."
"Drinkability: Light, crisp and balanced. This one always leaves you wanting another."
"Overall- a great Belgian ale, I can't say anything that hasn't been said."
"D: The taste just doesn't sit well with me... ive tried time and again to like this beer as much as ""im supposed to"" but i find the beer coming up short each time."
"Overall - Funtastic beer. Really great ale. World Class."
"This brew yells out that it was brewed by someone who genuinely understands beer. Very, very impressive."
"D - A slow drinker at 8.5% but very enjoyable and recommended."
"Absolutely wonderful beer."
"Excellent beer, very drinkable for abv and always leaves me wanting more. Don't overlook this because of how easy it is to find."
"D - Very pleasant, legendary in the realm of 'Devil' beers. It took a lot less time to drink 22.4 oz than I would have imagined while reviewing. That is a nice quality considering it is 8% strength. I like the balance of subtle malt, hops and yeast that seems refreshing colder, yet more focused and less disjointed whe it opens up. The aroma and sweetness blossum at closer to 55 degrees and is more pleasant to my taste. A very fine compliment to my filet and asparagus, a second bottle seem mandatory practically."
"Truly the outstanding classic of BSPA's."
"Appearance briliant golden yellow huge white head that stuck around for a while. I think the appearance was one of this beers strongest points. Smell I smell Sazz as well as some english hops also had some yeasty notes as well. Taste nice cookie/breadlike backbone followed by a wallop of spicy hops and alcohol. Mouthfeel mediem body and high carbonation. Drinkability a great before dinner beer."
"I will always go back for more Duvel. I dont get the complexities in this brew like others, but this is still one of the finest beers in the world."
"D - Excellent all around beer. Fulfilling in every way. One of those beers that you can enjoy anytime."
"D - Surprisingly and deceivingly high."
"Overall, I thought this was outstanding. Now is it worth the hype and the high rating, hard to say. Something does not get such a high ranking after almost 1200 reviews without having something going for it. Are there better ales out there, sure there are, but this is a classic, and will always be. If you are looking to introduce someone to the style this would work perfectly."
"D-I just had this stuff tonight after several years without. I forgot how good it was. I'm going to stock up next time I'm at the store."
"Truly a great beer by any standards, and one of the most drinkable strong Belgians. The brewery reccommends that 1cm of beer is left in the bottle due to the yeast for fermentation. However, I felt compelled to drink that also after finishing my glass. Delicious!"
"330ml stubby with 08/2010 ""best by"" date. Rookie pour left me with 3+ inches of head. Slightly cloudy with a pale yellow color. Very little carbonation action after the initial head, but the head stays throughout. Clean on the nose, with a mix of citrus and a little spice, mostly clove. Palate starts with citrus, again, but the spices are not as defined. Finishes quick. Excellent!"
"As I am not a huge fan of the banana flavor, this was quite good for the style, and everyone that tried it agreed that it was exceptional."
" I could see swilling several of these before I figured out it was 8.5 percent abv. An extremely tasty beer...good for any time...any place."
"Very carbonated, which gives it the crisp feeling. Hides the alcohol well and is highly drinkable."
"A Duvel poured properly into a large goblet looks absolutely amazing - Clean, bright goldenrod color swirled with smokey looking yeast, with a thick white layer of foam made up of large champagne size bubbles and fine spongy head. There is a crisp, wet bite with fruit, strawberry and light coppery bitterness. A little pricey but very worth the cost."
"Bottle, poured into a Duvel glass. Subtle dry, hoppy aroma with ""Belgian"" estery overtones. Clear yellow color with an enormous white head and lots of fine bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Complex flavor: dryness, sweetness, bitterness and alcohol all present in varying degrees from start to finish of each sip yet well balanced overall. Equally complex aftertaste with the same components as the flavor. Well carbonated, light bodied, with a long finish. Fantastic beer."
"This is a beautiful beer well worth the price of admission."
"Drinkability: With the 8.5% ABV, you'd better drink them slowly. You should anyway. This is the kind of beer whose taste you should savor. I loved it, and could drink it all afternoon on a nice mild sunny day (or, let's face it...pretty much anytime). Better walk home, though. ;)"
"I have mixed feelings about this beer. This beer did not blow me away however, credit must be given where due. This is an exceptionally well constructed and balanced beer, but just not to my liking."
"D: Overall a solid Belgian, very good to style and a good entry for those unfamiliar with the style."
"The beer world has moved on since Duvel's heyday. It's a fine brew, but you can find other ales these days, Belgian or otherwise, that are far more interesting, challenging, and palette expanding."
"D - This is my first time reviewing a Duvel because I could never find the words to describe the whole experience, and I still feel somewhat dumbfounded as to my description...it is definitely something you need to try, but as with everything, drink in moderation and don't underestimate it. It is a very refreshing and crisp beer, so the 8.5% is quickly forgotten about. Suitable for almost any situation/dinner in which white wine would be appropriate - beit a sweet or dry selection."
"I poured the beer slowly and patiently and a towering, rocky head emerged. It's a truly astounding beer to look at. It smelled and tasted of fresh, dry fruit, yeast and a bit of alcohol. It was extremely warming and very drinkable for the high ABV. I would recommend this to those who enjoy Hoegaarden because I think it shares a couple flavor notes with it."
"Exquisite example of the style. Vast in complexity while keeping perfect balance. Pairs especially well with seafood and fine cheese."
"D- This is to be sipped and enjoyed. A couple of these in a sitting would be appropriate, but one must beware of the consequences."
"Drinkability: Could be the single most versatile food beer i've ever had. I have put this up against big flavors, light flavors, desserts, even cooked with it and it just goes with everything. The only reason this is not a 5 in this category is the alcohol content. Ounce for ounce, it is perfect, but very few of us drink just one ounce, eh? As Rolling Stone once said: Duvel is Flemish for the word Devil, but have three of these and you'll see God."
"D: I love this beer! Despite the its high ABV, it's decently easy to drink. However, for me, I prefer to sip slowly and enjoy the complex range of flavours, textures, and physical features that it offers. Truly one of the greatest Belgian Pale ales out there - very highly recommended."
"Drinkability is superb, and I could finish a four pack easily if the diet I was currently on allowed for it. I'm writing this as I finish off the last few sips (carbonation is STILL going, and there's lacing three and a half inches up the sides of the glass - unbelievable!!), and the alcohol has definitely crept up on me by this point, but you definitely don't feel it until it's upon you. This sets a very high bar for other beers of the style, and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in exposing themselves to Belgian beer."
"D- i need to go get a snack and lay down. and then have another devil. i might have to edit this tomorrow with a fresh review. unless all 5's really is possible...it can't be."
"d - A very interesting beer. The appearance of this beer is top notch. It looks so delicious. Great balanced taste."
"D- If this was the only beer I could drink the rest of my life, It would be a great life."
"Â·	Drinkability: Dangerous. Absolutely delicious and easy to drink. Many stories could be told with a Duvel in hand!"
"I was really surprised by this . . . not really excited by the prospect of a Belgian beer (was a gift). I'd buy this in the future (should I see it)."
"Stubby bottle pours into a tulip glass. Pours a bright golden color with plenty of building, and bubbling rocky, foamy white head. Smell is faint with citrus, with some Belgian spice in the background. Taste is crisp with some of the citrus coming through. Mouthfeeling is heavily carbonated making this a refreshing drink."
"This beer had a huge white head. Champagne mouthfeel, very carbonated tasting. I'm not a huge fan of ""champgney"" beers."
"Pretty exceptional in the glass this beer is bright clear yellow gold with a huge frothy head the volume of which is almost equal to the volume of the beer. The smell is dominated by lemon and pepper, delicate hoppy spice and ripe summer fruit. The taste is upfront peppery spice, some due to hops but a good deal of it is from the alcohol. Incredibly brash and right out in your face just under the pepper is a fair amount of sweet pale malt along with a lemony tart kick with a bit of yeast ester as well. This beer feels very lively in the mouth clean yet drying with a near stinging peppery bite that invites another sip almost slightly harsh but in a good way. Overall this is quite good definitely a style defining beer and world class by all accounts. A good choice to have on hand at all times for special occasions."
"I recently tried St Bernardus Tripel, and this has similar qualities, but more subtle. It is not as tart, more smooth, and therefore a very drinkable brew."
"mouthfeel, the beer is somehow light, but lush. creamy and tender, yet iron hard. there's a great intensity at every point on the palate and for such a high grav brew it maintains it's drinkability with ease. all this is complimented by sublime complexity and nuance. drink duvel."
"Served in my Maudite snifter. Poured the color of pale straw; ample light penetration, but somewhat murky. Voluminous white head (about three inches) with excellent retention and generous clumpy lacing throughout the tasting. Scent of belgian yeast, citrus and clove. Taste similar to nose. Lively mouthfeel and ample carbonation during the duration. Finish was crisp and clean with a bit of citrus that lingers in the mouth. Very refreshing, but deceptively so given the 8.5% abv. No wonder Duvel is considered to be the archetype of the style."
"An overall good beer. Will try it again and again."
"The drinkability is very good I see why this brew continues to get attention. Prosit, MK"
"Overall: Haven't had this in a while, but glad I came back. A real pleasure to drink. This kind of beer is one reason why I became an advocate for better beer."
"Strong alcohol taste that is accompanied by the citrus elements and a slight fruit presence, finishes with a pleasant sourness. Carbonation was a bit much for my mouth to handle though."
"Duvel is an absolute classic!"
"I would certainly try this beer again. Although I think it would be a first beer selection."
"Flat out excellent in every regard. If you see a Duvel Gift Pack, buy it. The beer plus the glass is an experience not to be missed!"
"D - I wouldn't purposely seek it out often, but if there were a few around, I wouldn't tire of them."
"Feels fizzy and sour. Bubbly. Leaves a sour film. Turns creamy at the end. A bit dry like white wine. It's a good, spicy drink. Bubbly and fizzy. Sour and pretty good."
"The appearance was a light amber color, with a little cloudiness. Poured a somewhat thick head. The smell was very nice, featuring a citrus blend of pears, apples and possibly something else. The taste was nice, but not overwhelming. You can definitely pick up the sugar content in this, though it's not immediately apparent. In a way, it reminded me of a lager or pilsener. This had a medium range carbonation, giving it a good mouthfeel. This is a drinkable beer, though I'm not as enthusiastic as others on it. I'm not huge on pale ales generally, but I thought I'd give it a whirl."
"As much as I enjoy Belgians, and especially golden ales (see Delirium and Damnation), I really did not care for this one due to the moderate sourness and earthy finish. :("
"Pours a beautifully clear golden color with a snow white head. Carbonation is excellent and the head actually hangs around for a fair amount of time. The smell is awsome, I get a dry lager sort of aroma. The taste is simply amazing, a hint of sweetness up front with just the right amount of spicy earthiness and a dry incredibly refreshing finish, making particularly drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"D - Amazing, though you couldn't down a case, this is certainly a celebration brew, as well as a relaxation brew, and most definitely a perfect dinner brew. Recommended of course."
"D: Fairly high, though perhaps not up to the price that I found it for, especially in comparison to others I have had and enjoyed equally or more. I would certainly have it again, though, if the opportunity arose."
"Drinkability - This is a reasonably strong (8.5%), easy to drink ale. Definitely recommended!"
"D: Its good, but a bit to pils like for me. Not a huge pils fan"
"Not as complex as some of the others but certainly a masterful brew."
"I suppose this is the King of Belguim Ales, but it's not my cup of tea. A warning, the alcohol will hit the uninitiated. At 8.5% this ale is nothing to mess with"
"A slow pour produces a large foamy head. The beer is a beautiful golden color with continuous carbonation. The aroma is unique and yeasty with a sweet fruitiness and hints of tobacco. The beer lightly dances on the palate due to the high carbonation. The alcohol comes through along with some spice. The finish is dry and lasting. A very good and drinkable beer."
"I poured unhurriedly as the bottle suggested but still ended up with a massive four finger white frothy head. The body is a hazy golden yellow with active carbonation. The smell is sweet and fruity with a hint of alcohol. The taste is excellent. Citric, spicy and a little tart but perfectly balanced. The finish is dry. Mouthfeel is crisp and light yet it has a slightly creamy texture. Drinkability for this high of an ABV is simply outstanding. Only the effect of the alcohol will slow you down because it is well hidden in the taste. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. By far the best Belgian that I have had yet. It is similar to champagne in some ways but far, far better. If you need a beverage to celebrate with, use Duvel."
"This is about as good as a beer can be. I understand why Michael Jackson (beer God) loved this brew. Some things are just that good and words don't do it justice. This devil is just that."
"this is a very drinkable beer. deceptive. it drinks much lighter. these things could make short work of me, but since i don't drink to get tanked, it's a great one off beer for an evening. nice high alcohol content that serves as a good nightcap or would pair greatly with some grilled fish or even boiled seafood."
"My, oh my. Pours a nearly clear golden/straw with huge white head that leaves a lot of lacing on the way down. On the nose you get a very sweet tone, alcohol, and the standard fruit. The taste is citric in style with a long lasting flavor. It stays constant and does not morph into anything else less desirable. I just have to give it a 5. Mouthfeel is terrific with a good combo of bubbles and flavor. This is easily drinkable in mass quantity. Outstanding brew."
"poured a cloudy gold color with a huge white head, its cloudy head doesn't move at all. smell is alot like champagne, or a sparkling white wine, carbonation is everywhere and i assume thats what i'm smelling. taste is good, but not fantastic like i've read. maybe since i dont have a real duvel glass, i've heard that it helps. it has a sweety fruity taste to it, and some distinct yeast flavors, its a good beer, but i wouldn't call it great. maybe i got a bad apple"
"D: Drinkable standard Belgian. Decent while not great."
"A VERY drinkable beer that I would like to drink many more if not for the near $7 a bottle price. Beautiful. I think I have to have a bottle or two of this alwys read for drinking."
"750 Bottle into Duvel glass poured clear gold. (LOL what a head) the cork came off on its own, safe to say some carbonation (the steam of bubbles coming from the center of the glass is wonderful) Spice fruity (yeast) aroma film head .Citrus and malty sweetness crisp dry finish Crisp mouth feel reminds me of a champagne. The Alcohol is well hidden and very drinkable"
"Again very bright and crisp on the palate with high carbonation. A bit of booze warmth arises especially as the brew warms a bit. Semidry finish with a starchy film that lingers on the tongue (not as bad as it sounds, just reminds you that your drinking a big wheat beer that's all). Very complex and probably the best beer of its style. Tasty is an understatement."
"I've had this in Belgium, where I noted a malt scent and slight sweet hints in the nose, possibly a taste of cardamom, and how it seemed to change character in the taste as it sat, over time."
"Sampled from a 750ml bottle. Pours golden with a huge extremely white three finger head. The nose is a bit funky with aromas of butter and candy. This beer is incredibly smooth, crisp, and clean with flavors of lemons and pears. Very balanced, not too hoppy, no to malty, quite refreshing. Drinkablity of this beer is good, however be weary it does sneak up on you. Its called Duvel for a reason."
"This is another enjoyable beer to be savored and not consumed at the pace of a lighter, refreshing beverage. Take your time with this one and see what else is there to enjoy."
"From an 11.2 oz bottle which came in a $13.99 four-pack gift-set which included a unique Duvel glass, this beer pours a beautiful golden color with almost non-stop carbonation and a foamy head with serious staying power... After hearing so much about this beer, I was definitely impressed with the appearance... The aroma is so intricate and complex that it is hard to describe... somewhat fruity with a smell of bananas... Taste is equally complex with a nice, pepperish sting to it... The mouthfeel is good, somewhat acidic... and due to the hefty alcohol percentage, wouldn't want to down too many of these bad boys in one night... a distinct alcohol taste is definitely present, and the beer contains a white-wine character... Definitely an interesting brew, though the price is pretty steep... Wouldn't advise to drink too many of these in one setting, best enjoyed occasionally... Recommended..."
"Drinkability: This is an amazing beer. It is incredibly drinkable Â a perfect treat."
"Overall I will be grabbing more of this for sure. Awsome beer and one of my favorites. Good for special occasions, just take it easy because the alcohol can creep up on you. Recommended."
"I believe I will be drinking another and buying more in the future."
"all in all, a great experience."
"This beer ended up disappointing me. When I had it several years ago, it seemed to be quite good, but for some reason this time around reminds me way too much of a high gravity malt liquor. I don't taste Belgian yeast notes, I don't taste a good mix of malty flavors. It looks absolutely perfect, but that's the best thing about it."
"The taste was crisp and clean, medium to light bodied with a slight bitterness balance by sweetness. This is an excellent Belgian beer."
"Drinkability: Drink with a lot of respect."
"p.s. A word of advice: pour with the utmost care and only ever in a proper Duvel tulip glass, otherwise you'll literally be overwhelmed by the head."
"light in mouthfeel, and hot. very hot, actually. bitter and not at all sweet (that's not a criticism). pilsymalt-forward, hot and hoppy (interesting how these seem to unify into a single characteristic) finish and spicy/yeasty in between"
"Just a fantastic example of the style as many have noted. Always a classic."
"Pours perfectly clear blond with a soapy white head the laces along the sides of the glass. Smell sweet, candied, lightly fruity and a very little spice. Starts out sweet as it transitions to a little bitter followed by a malty and fruity hop finish. Magic in the mouth with a soft tickle of carbonation and smoooth taste. Insane drinkable, this cannot be alcoholic. A delight to drink."
"my 100th review i saved for this gem ; pours a clear light golden color w/ a huge fluffy white head which lasts forever, lots of lacing that covers the entire wall of my snifter ; a very clean smell, low yeasty by-product aroma, mostly spicy hops and a pilsen-like malt smell, faint alcoholic undertone as well ; wow, an incredible, crisp malt flavor perfectly balanced w/ the hops, a faint fruity flavor underneath, kinda like a pilsner on steroids w/ a lower hop rate, hides the alcohol well ; a nice light-med body actually, slightly dry w/ a creamy texture, very interesting ; much better than most other belgians i've tried, i can see why this is one of the most sought after beers it's an extremely well drinking brew, i wish i had this on-tap in my house..."
"The high ABV didn't really bother me either. It just added to the experience. Great beer."
"Strong and tasty, a real treat."
"Light gold color with an amazing head that looked very similar to a bubble bath. Of course lacing was all over the place. The smell was light. Very fruity, with apples most notable. There were also notes of corn. The taste was very citrusy - grapefruit was pretty prominent. The mouthfeel was amazing! A blast of carbonation that left me invigorated, which is a first for me to say about a beer. An all-around amazing beer, and very warming to boot. The day after I had one of these, I went to the store and bought a four-pack with a chalice included. One of my favorites."
"nice contrast with the mouthfeel - thick creamy head against nice light champagne-like body."
"Belgians are hit or miss with me and this one is a miss. I think I was kind of expecting a Belgian session beer and this is not that. I still think it deserves all of the accolades that it's received."
"Well crafted and complex, deserves to be in the top 100."
"D: A real joy to drink. Up there with La Fin Du Monde and slowly making Belgian Strong Pale Ale's the drinks for me. I almost considered a 5.0 for this one."
"An excellent beer, I first enjoyed Duvel when on vacation by the beach, and a friend and I traded beers and samples throughout the week. Duvel pours nicely, providing a nice, rich white head atop a light golden body. The flavor was clean and crisp, and its dense carbonation reminded me of champagne. Though its taste was decidedly pale ale, it was somewhat sweeter than most pale ales I've encountered. It finished very nicely, with a very slight hoppy aftertaste that I enjoyed. I was very impressed with it overall. It wasn't a beer of which I would have several in a row, but it was a brew I can easily enjoy by itself or with another immediately afterward. Well worth trying and should not disappoint. Great for enjoying after dinner on a warm day."
"Could drink a lot of this one, very light and easy to drink, but the eight and a half percent would get me eventually, nice Belgian and it is definitely one of the classics, now I can say I have it and can recommend to friends"
"d: a very well balanced belgian beer with perfect interplay between bitter and sweet; great spice presence; a delicious brew that i could drink all day"
"As far as Belgian beers and drinkability go it's pretty hard to argue against a Duvel. Tasty and light although it is relatively strong."
"Drinkability- A big beer with big, hard to describe flavors. I really liked it but it truly is huge and not one to have multiples of."
"The Devil pours into the wide mouth goblet with an immense head that is soft and billowy. It is a lovely golden color to light yellow hue with a drink by date on the bottle. The aroma is yeasty and clean. The taste is smooth yet it feels as though each drink cleanses the palate for the next one to arrive. It is a tad spicy with a sweet finish. In the mouth it is light and hangs on with a mild carbonation. I would buy a 4 pack of this one even though the price can be challenging but you get what you pay for. Drink It."
"Drinkability: Very satisfying. The drinkability can make this beer a troublemaker. A classic."
"Overall, I don't think beer gets much better than this. I don't think anyone does drinkable-and-complex better than the Belgians, and I don't think any Belgian beer exemplifies this better than Duvel."
"Poured a golden color with big fluffy white head that hung around forever. Had a hoppy citrus aroma to it, but also a hint of malt. The taste was wonderful; starts off fruity, but finishes bitter. Nicely balance. Lacing was good. Mouthfeel was almost champagne like. Hides the alcohol pretty well in the taste. Good stuff."
"Pours a bright clear yellow with a ginormous, very thick head and well defined lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Smell is slightly of spice and orange peel. Slightly sour taste, some european style hop flavor as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, slightly dry on the finish. Fairly drinkable. I'm increadibly impressed by the head retention. In the small wine glass i poured it into, there remained a good solid 1/2 inch of foam by the time i finished the glass. Very nice indeed."
"This is a good session beer. I love the lemmony tastes...kinkda like tart lemonaide."
"D - Not something to session but a nice beer. It MAY be the ""original"" Belgian Strong Pale Ale but it's not the best."
"Unfortunately, this is one of my favorite beers and it happens to be expensive for a college student, however every time I'm in town with my parents, I'm ordering a Duvel."
"I like this beer a lot, but Belgian strong pale ales are not my favorite. As I have noted, this reminds of a pilsner but with more alcohol. Duvel is one of the best example of a Belgian strong pale ale though."
"Drinkability, forget about it. In my opinion, every BSPA worth its salt should score a solid 4.5 or above in drinkability, but this sets the standard. You could, if so inclined, drink this until you pass out. It's a dangerous beer - feels way too light and fluffy for 8.5%. Incredible."
"If I was stuck on a deserted island with nothing but an infinite supply of Duvel, I would consider myself lucky."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, nice kick, good representation of style, I had tried this beer at a tasting once long ago and didnÂt like it very much, however, that was before I had tried many Belgian beers. I liked many Belgian beers that I tried since then and realized that I may not have given this beer a fair shot, thus I was anxious to give this beer another try. However, I was disappointed again. I realize now that I simply donÂt like this beer as much as I appreciate its craftmanship."
"Very drinkable for 8.5% but one of these is enough for me if I still have to drive home."
"smooth in the mouth, still highly carbonated, slight boozey feel, . this beer is nearly flawless imo. without a doubt the best looking beer i have ever seen, best head retention, good lacing. This is what all other beers , of any style, should strive for."
"I will have to say this is one of my favorite beers of all time. I urge EVERYONE to try this beer and give it your own rating."
"I waited a long time to buy this, for some unknown reason. It certainly lives up to it's hype."
"From bottle into glass, best before date 4/2009. Nice golden color. Head was frothy and full. Taste was kinda spicy, hoppy, citrusy, carbonated. Not what I was expecting after hearing about this from so many people. Thought I was going to be blown away, but then again, maybe it's just not not my favorite style of beer."
"Drinkability: This is the classic BSPA. It's fundamentally stunning and dangerously drinkable."
"D: Again, noticed the alcohol but still a beer that is much too drinkable for its 8.5%"
"The taste is smooth, buttery, hops and slight bitterness. But it's very well balanced with maltiness and a touch of spices. The mouthfeel is wonderful and this is very easy to drink. It would make a great session beer. The alcohol is extremely well hidden, so watch out!"
"D: Has a very different taste than what I was expecting. It's not bad but not something I'll get often. Easy to drink and refreshing, though."
"I would recommend it to anyone."
"Overly carbonated."
"D- Well after the initial pour and throughout this review I only have one sip or two left of the Duvel. 11.2 ounces was certainly not enough of this brew. This is an excellent example of a BSPA (my favorite style) and one I will purchase again and again. The ABV is almost undetectable and this is one that's complexity will have you sipping and sipping again."
"This is an excellant beer,just sit down and relax and enjoy,the flavors all blend in just superb with just the right touch of spices and bitterness and that creamy feel to it.The 8.1% alcohol,hell man,you can't even tell.Duvel is a little on the pricey side but worth every penny.Do give this one a try,well worth it...excellant!!"
"wow, 1010 review as of this writing. How often does that happen in my beers reviewed list? I have had this often enough but have strayed into other areas. I decided to have a go for the football weekend and shared a bottle with my brother. Perfect as always. With all the other descriptions on flavors I'll pass and just note that once again I find the easy to get (for me) and in my backyard is damn good. In this case the grass is not greener on the other side of the fence."
"A very drinkable beer, one that I hope never changes its top quality ingrediants and I have put my money where my belly is too!"
"D- Very drinkable for an 8.5 percent abv brew however I find it somewhat of a sipper."
"D - A classic beer that I have enjoyed many times but never reviewed. Although it has always been tasty, this beer really shines when you are actually thinking about the flavors and how they complement one another. A must-try and the definitive Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended."
"Comment: I have passed this beer over in the pastÂbut no more. It belongs among the best of the class and I will keep it in my private stash for special occasions (think Thursdays)."
"The 8.1 per cent alcohol was plainly evident and blew me away. I wondered if this was opened prematurely and just needed to mature. I'm curious to put one of these away and see what happens to it by next year."
"Plenty of flavor, an excellent beer."
"D: Definitely a good, drinkable beer. Smooth, great tasting, and very refreshing. The gulp of alcohol I got later on in the beer was not too tasty, but other than that one sip, it was an excellent beer."
"Really rich and creamy. Full carbonation and body, beautifully smooth. Very easy to drink."
"Been a while since I had this beer. I had forgotten just how good it is."
"Notes: Duvel is about as perfect a beer that I can think of. I often use it as a reference when reviewing other beers, and I think it exemplifies what a fine golden ale can be. Everything progresses naturally from pour to last sip, and creates a total sensory experience that must be experienced to believe. Also, this beer is incredibly available. I have found this beer at most stores I've been to, from ABC to several local liquor stores. If they don't have it, request it. I guarantee you won't be disappointed by this world class beer: a heavenly brew with a devilish smile."
"D - I'm underwhelmed by this beer. It's not bad, per se, but it is not my favorite. Like the French Canadians say ""I think, maybe, not so good."""
"I had this beer on August 7, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe' in Toronto. The beer was poured into a tulip and was a beautiful golden colour with a huge loose rocky white head that lasted longer than the beer. The aroma was hints of malt and some spice. The mouthfeel was light but with heavy heavy carbonation. The taste was slightly citrusy with a bitter aftertaste."
"I would call Duvel one of the best widely available beers in America. In my mind, it has the ultimate appearance of a beer. It has a look that makes you badly want to drink it. Once you do, there is no disappointment in any part of this beer. Great beer!"
"Overall a solid belgian ale. I would probably have this again paired with a steak or some lobster. But to relax and enjoy a high abv beer on its own; i can think of a number of different offerings that I'd prefer. When I want a beer I want to feel like I'm having a beer and this one just doesn't do it for me."
"Poured a pale straw-gold color with more than 2 fingers of pillowy, white head that never fully dissipates and great lacing. Great aroma, spicy and yeasty with hints of wheat. Taste is malts upfront followed by some spices and hops with a bit of fruits mixed in (pears and apples). Good mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and body. Drinkability is great as well. This stuff looks and tastes great and hides is 8.5% exceptionally well."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with ample creamy froth. Flowery hops on the nose give it great aromatic character. Fuller in body than it looks, this is really well-balanced between a delicate bitterness and light malt flavors. The alcohol is prevalent but in-check. Well-done ale."
"Eric"
"Very nice drinkable ale. I wanted another before the first was done. The aftertaste is very pleasant. I love the spicy floral hop flavor and aroma. Leaves me wanting more."
"D: Very good for an 8% beer, a classic of its style, Duvel is a great beer, quite simple really, but quite delicious."
"Wow, this beer is rated pretty high on this site...Sorry, didn't really care for it. Got a taste of apple and plum, but the conditioning was way to harsh for me. This is one of those times where I tend to differ with the crowd. I do understand this style, but I don't care for this one..."
"It tastes tart, fresh, and dry, and is very effervescent. Fresh flavors like straw, with fruity additions like bubblegum and pear. Snappy alcohol at the finish that does not feel hot. Delicious and never overbearing. Duvel is very smooth in the mouth. I will be coming back to this one for sure."
"This is one brew that lived up to the hype. Mmmmm, evil beer."
"What else can I say that everyone hasnt already? Poured from 750 mL bottle, best buy 11/09. Pops like a bottle of chamapne, pours a golden yellow with massive head, thick, rocky, and left large amounts of lace. Smell is of sour citrus, some alcohol, and other fruits, I swear I detect some banana and at times reminds me of a hefe. Taste is superb, thats the only way to describe. High carbonation and an almost creamy feel to it. This might be the best beer I've every had so I dont have too many words to describe it other than that. Only a 4 for drinkability as it does pack a punch to it so a couple glasses of this and I couldnt handle any more."
"Note: This is easily one of the best beers that I've ever had. Beyond that if the name (Devil) is anything to go by it is a compelling reason for me to sin more. Hmm... maybe I will take the label's advice and try to drink the rest of this four pack with ""good-looking strangers."""
"Dry finish, bitterness that follows through the throat. May be 8.5% but is smooth throughout."
"Pours pure gold with strains of cloudy yeast here and there. Massive white angel-food-cake head billows up and lives forever; an iceberg of cream sits in the middle with big bubbly arcs all over the glass. Aroma reveals rich and sweet bread / dough malts, fruit and musty yeasts, and distant hop spiciness. Cream and flowers throughout. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sharply effervescent with a dry quality. Flavor is well-matched to the nose with the addition of a considerable sourdough malt quality; notes of lemon and pepper from the hops. Aftertaste is primarily sour and tingly. In the end dry and a touch warm."
"A strong but delicate beer on the mouth not overwhelming but very complex. Slightly sweet and creamy with some bitterness, notes of light floral hops, a bit of sweet malt and a nice yeasty tang. Smooth all the way down a real treat from a country that knows there beer."
"D - Overall a solid beer. I'm glad I bought 4 of them."
"Overall, I like it very much. It is a spicy, yeasty, yummy Beer. I will have some more in the near future."
"Pours a cloudy lemon with a billowy, pillow head. Smell was grassy with some wheat-like notes...subtle malt undertones. Taste was tart, snappy with a desert-dry finish. Dry, refreshing quality in mouthfeel, surprisingly hiding the 8.5 abv. Drinkability was good...not a guzzler due to dryness..a good choice for a leisurely summer's afternoon."
"Pours out a bright golden body with tons of carbonation and the quintessential Duvel head: thick, fluffy, full. Forms a volcano-like plateau in the middle and leaves huge, chunky lacing on the glass. Smells of pale malts, bread, (saaz?) hops, white pepper, and yeasty, spicy phenols. Flavor starts off with bright maltiness; bringing lots of bread and honey. There is some crisp apple in the middle. Finishes abundantly spicy: spicy alcohol, spicy phenols, and spicy (and grassy) hops. Finishes dry with a nice finishing bitterness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the abv and the carbonation wakes the palate with each sip. Wonderful beer that I haven't had in far too long."
"D- Very good, but so complex and alcoholic that you couldn't drink very much of it."
"The smell is reserved yet fresh, clean and light. The pilsner malt reference on the label may help you set expectations. Light bodied, the mouth feel has a creamy texture. The light citrus lemony malt flavor is refreshing. It finishes dry. A good drinker the 8.5% ABV's presence is hidden."
"Drinkability: You couldn't have very many of these or you'll end up face first in the toilet, but this is a very nice beer that I'd recommend to anyone that likes ales, pale ales, etc"
"The mouth is blessed with great carbonation. This is a nice beer and well deserving of its fan base."
"It made an excellent pairing with BBQ pulled pork, rib tips, and fried okra."
"kind of beer; now I have. The Duvel is definitely a good to great beer."
"Pale clear gold color with head. No, let me rephrase. HEAD!!!! Down in front! It's like an orange on a toothpick. The smell is lemon zest and sweet malt. The taste has a malt front, notes of pears and apricots, and then a...now take this the right way...pleasant soapiness to it. Seriously, it tastes like soap smells but in a good way. The finish has a nice refreshing hop bite. Definitely the best of the style. The mouthfeel is silky with a nice carbonation (no wonder) to break the whole thing up nicely. The drinkability is everything a hot day demands and a balanced beer offers. Someone open me another one."
"Definitely a favorite."
"Pours a nice hazy gloden color with a huge fluffy head that stands up out of the glass. It has the aroma of light fruit, pear-ish. In the taste, it is bold, a liitle sweet, a fruit presence, a nice dry finish, with a small hop presence. I wish I could get this on tap, I could drink it all day long. It is just a great beer."
"As I continue to try more Belgian Ales, I finally broke down and bought this one. Poured into a snifter from a 11.2 oz. bottle, which took almost 10 minutes to pour, due to the huge head it created. The beer poured a clear almost white color, settling to a light gold in the glass. Huge thick creamy white head, that very slowly dissipated, with thick spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is slightly fruity. The flavor is not as complex as expected, but still interesting. Fruity flavor, I'm assuming from the yeast, along with a slight hop presence. Light mouthfeel, along with a not-so-smooth finish. The beer had a slight hop-harshness at the end, but still this is a very drinkable Belgian. I can see why it is so popular. Overall, this fullfilled my expectations, and I wouldnt mind having this again very soon."
"D: Excellent. A fully realized beer that is delicious and easy drinking."
"All in all a very drinkable beer, but I think I would like to give it another go for a deeper appreciation."
"Drinkablility- dangerously drinkable, thank god this is $3.50/bottle or else I'd be stocking up. Damn, if I only lived in Belguim...."
"This is a very drinkable beer, although the high abv begs for a limited quantity."
"Almost clear as it poured from the bottle with tons of carbonation and a head that took up half the glass--I was pouring from a stubby 330 ml bottle and couldn't fit it all into a pint glass the head was so thick. The color was golden, very pale, and clear in the glass. The smell was sweet and alcoholic, it reminded me of La Fin du Monde, though the flavor was not as strong. Taste was sweet, light, somewhat yeasty, and alcoholic. All very mild; nothing overpowering. Crisp, clean mouthfeel. I suppose this is a good beer, but it doesn't seem like anything special to me."
"This is a good beer, but not my favourite Belgian. Gets better as it warms up."
"D: A very drinkable and refreshing beer for all the alcohol is packs. Probably the best Belgian Strong Pale Ale that I've had. It's very enjoyable; crisp, clean, smooth and quite tasty."
"D- A very enjoyable beer. I have had this beer before, but I have never slowed my drinking down to enjoy the nuances of this ale. The alcohol (8.5) came on early, but it let me slowup and enjoy the changes that occur as the beer warms."
"I am drinking it unpaired with food, but on a full stomach. Its malty and spicy aroma and crisp flavor work well all by itself, but I donÂt think IÂll drink another right now. The merits of the beer would be lost on me. The bottle tells me it is 8.5% alcohol, and I am noticing it after only 3-4 oz."
"FINALLY got this one, after seeing it sitting on the shelf every day, mocking me with it's way-too-expensive price tag. But I took the dive and got it, and I'll do it again. Pours an incredible, fluffy, foamy head over a nice light straw color. Foam seems to never go away. Great lacing too. Nose is great, nice spices and a good bit of hops too. Taste is excellent. Fruit all over the place, pears, apples, some lemons and oranges too. A nice hit of hops at the end. Very tasty. Feel is medium to full bodied, good carbonation. A really excellent beer, one I'll go back to again for sure."
"D: way too drinkable if there is such a thing. This beer is so easily consumed that you can easily reach for more. Make sure you are at home or with a DD."
"Overall, pretty well balanced for such a strong beer. For some reason, I feel the mouthfeel falls flat."
"An easy to drink, higher alcohol, beer, Duvel seems to be easy to find. A bonus!"
"Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip glass - Large head that slowly disaptes and reveals how little beer was in the bottle. Malty aroma with hints of citrus and lagery hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light but not at all watery. Smooth flavor consisting of malt, fruity sweetness. Fairly good beer but I think Chimay does this type of ale better."
" ~ While I'll enjoy the 4 pack I purchased for $10.50 from Dan's Liquor I can't see myself pitching in another dimer and some change to the Central European brewery."
"The taste is very complex. Initially taste strongly of wheat, but as the beer lingers on the tongue it becomes tart and spicy. Alcohol sweetness is also present. I would not mind having this beer anytime."
"Bravo to Duvel. An incredibly complex beer. This was very enjoyable, and there were no dead spots from pour to gulp. This is a beer I could see revisiting again & again, to try to learn more, to enjoy again, to fall siren to its amazing simple song. An outstanding beer. I am fast becoming a Belgian Strong Pale Ale fan. Highly recommended, dare I say almost ""required"" drinking to grasp the genre."
"D-The alcohol is perhaps a little too much in the forefront which hurts the overall drinkability. This however is a masterful beer that is in my rotation. Plus fresh direct delivery is a good thing."
"A great beer in the style. This one would work excellent when paired with lox. A must try for anyone who is looking towards the style, and a solid hit for anyone with a taste for beer."
"D: Very drinkable and always enjoyable. I first had this many years ago in Switzerland, then again 2 years ago in Cooperstown. It has only been in the last year that I've been able to find it here in Omaha. But since my first tasting, I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer and look forward to each and every bottle."
"Overall - Well-deserved for its reputation and definitely a standard-bearer for the style. A must-enjoy beer for Belgian aficionados."
"Taste: Slightly smokey with a hint of hops good spring time brew"
"This is easily one of the best beers I've had in a great while, I'd highly recommend this to anyone wanting to broaden their beer experience."
"Though it's an enjoyable beer, I usually find Duvel far from impressive. It is, of course, manditory to try for those who enjoy Belgians, and I'll certainly have it again, but it is hardly near the top of my list."
"One of the finest beers that I have ever had. Classic."
"if not almost fantastic"
"D: Unbelievable drinkability. A true classic that deserves all the hype heaped upon it!"
"Deserving of its classic status, a beer to treat yourself with once in a while."
"Quality brew. I like this one a lot."
"Overall: I find this a little too much like a lager and less like an ale for my taste. It is well executed, but not as complex as I would expect a Belgian ale to be. A quite good beer, to be sure, and one I will certainly drink again, but shy of outstanding."
"It's definitely unique, but I'll rather spend my money on any other Belgian because of the carbonation. The taste and smell are solid though... the price hurts."
"Everyone's always talking about how much head this beer produces, so I had to see for myself! Love the corked bottle from Belgium btw. I poured this beer into a chalice of no speciality and half the damn thing was thick white cream. My face was in this beer before I could even reach the actual liquid through the head! Gotta love that, and on the two other pours the head stayed, even after sitting in the sun for a good 10 minutes. Thats damn good. The smell is like a hefe suprisingly, a little acidic though. The taste is like a hefe with balls, or like the Chimay White, but a little toned down. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but hey, its a pale beer, what do you want? The drinkability takes a huge hit after the first chalice-full, it just brings the alcohol out a little too heavily for how light the beer seems, so it plays tricks on you. I can see why they call this the devil...I was a gonner after just a bomber!"
"D: If I could, I'd drink it much more often. A glorious brew, with a slightly high ABV. One of the first Belgians I ever tried, and I'm sure I'll have plenty more Duvels in the future."
"Poured this beer into a 50 degree Duvel glass. The beer was very pretty with a most gorgeous thick creamy white head that made little burgs in the glass. Beer had a slightlty sour smell. High alcohol made for a rather sweet brew I thought with a slight burn after but not bad. I know this beer is revered by many and I think everyone should try it, but it is just not my cup of beer. Will not buy again."
""
"D: Very easy to drink. Much too easy for such a high ABV."
"Outstanding ale. A mainstay in the cellar."
"It is truly amazing how delicious this beer is, while at the same time it could be mistaken for a macro when just looking at it. I don't know how they pack so much flavor into such a clear effervescent beer. It is kind of deceptive, but in that good way. Of the Belgian Strong Pale Ales the only other ones I have tasted are the Delirium Tremens, and La Fin Du Monde, and I much prefer Duvel to either of those. If you havenÂt tried it Â buy some."
"Arguably one of the world's great beers. Would drink it all night, if I had the money & the liver..."
"D: Wouldn't want more than the one 750 mL but too delicious to stay around very long."
"Overall: A fine beer, but not a great example of Belgian styles. Is probably a bit more accessible than most Belgians though."
"Duvel is still the benchmark for Belgian Golden Ales."
"I'll admit to a certain bias as I discovered this while stationed at NATO HQs; fond memories indeed (well, at least from what I can still remember!)."
"Overall a staple of Belgian beers. Very light and easy to drink, it's a refreshing change."
"My feelings on Duvel are mixed. I seem to be in the minority because I feel that Duvel is only an above-average beer. The mouthfeel is exceptional, though."
"The bells and whistles are great. Smell intruiged me, and looks were fantastic. The taste was good but I was hoping for a little more. It may have just been too cold. I'll have to review it again another day.(darn!) Great beer."
"amazing. pours fairly clear at first until the yeast is stirred. very floral, candy sweet yeast with a touch of spice. real nice. the bubbles almost shoot off the bottom. pillowy light head. the mouthfeel is beautiful. the bubbles play on your tongue. very smooth. sweet yeast taste, fruit notes. perfect in every way i think, just amazing. one of my favorite beers i have ever had. one that i will remember for a long time."
"It's very, very drinkable and one of my favorite beers. A must for all to try and some will love it's unique qualities."
"A fresh and complex belgian, you definatly have to try this one at some point"
"poured a beatiful gold with an awesome rocky head into a duvel glass. lacing? how can there be lacing when the head doesn't move? the bouqet on this is exceptionally complex. some things that i can detect/remember are: bread, honey, dough, floral notes, apricots, yeast, and much more...i was annoying the gf due to constantly smelling this beer. taste was of the above, like drinking a wonderful liquid bread mixed with honey, flowers, and light stone fruits balanced beautifully by the subtle yet present on the tongue hops. finish is not overpowering but long. medium/full bodied, mouthfeel is spritzy, quite carbonated but not fake carbonated like a macro, drinkability is great for a beer of this body and abv but i know i can't have too many or i will be drooling on myself again by the end of the night like the last time i had the devil."
"Bottom line: This is a very tasty Golden Ale that I've enjoyed every time I've had it. Highly recommended!!"
"crisp yellow with a picturesque head that rises and falls at will. what should beer look like? this. aromas of sweet and spicy malts and notable yeast, only hinting at traditional belgian odors. champagne in the mouth -- crisp carbonation and a dry finish. drink quickly and enjoy the carefree nature of the beer, or sip slowly and discover the hints of fruitiness, floral elements, and spices. drinkable, addictive, and never hints at its abv (until it hits your constitution, of course)."
"A very unique beer, very drinkable and one of the driest beers I've ever tasted."
" Tingley mouthfeel that smooths out and goes down easy. This drink is very strong but very enjoyable. Clearly a well brewed beer."
"From the Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA this set me back a full $7.99. Serious money, but then this is a serious beer. Poured into my Duvel glass it was a slightly cloudy golden color with a gigantic head that looks like a mushroom shaped cloud. The head lasted a long time and left big chunks of lacing in the glass. Aroma is cloves spices with a lot of coriander, floral hops, and yeast. Mouthfeel is rich and greasy. Simply wonderful. Flavor is yeasty, with some floral notes. Nice dry finish and good to the very last drop. A really nice brew"
"The infamous Duvel. Strong yet subtle. Almost painfully enjoyable. What can I say? Interesting brew, at least. Not to be taken lightly. Or perhaps best: a force to be reckoned with."
"Exquisite!"
"D- is a very good beer that is easy to drink alot of"
"Drinkability: This beer is amazing, always delicious. I'd describe it to myself like an alcoholic lager with more flavor, with hefeweizen banana bread flavor, but cleaner and lighter than both."
"D: Even on my second taste, it's still king of its kind. Complex, crisp, big and drinkable. The 8.5% ABV is so very well hidden. Why is it called ""Devil"" when it's nearly god-like in perfection?"
"Comments: Mostly sticking to American pale ales, this was different for me. And I loved every minute of it. I wish I would have tried this beer years ago. I know for most people this is a pretty mainstream beer, but if you haven't tried it or are looking for a change... This one won me over."
"Recommended."
"Drinkablity? I'm opening my 3rd, and better finish typing this while I still can. Can't believe I missed this beer until now. At 8.5% it'll knock ya on your butt, so watch it. I think it was $8.99 for a 4-pack, and if that is correct it was worth every penny."
"Final Statement: Although I respect Belgians a lot, I'm still not a huge fan of them. I see their strong points, and will savour one here and there, but I'm still a die hard English style ale kind of guy. Duvel is the best Belgian I have had though, I highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. I'm not much into Belgian beers, but this one really is nice. I can't say enough nice things about it."
"drinking this beer from its designed glass is amazing! never have i had a beer look so good in its behavior. semi-cloudy pale copper color with and enormous, carnbation-fueled thick head. true belgian yeast taste with sweet fruity character. a bit carbonic in the mouth but not near too much. Very drinkable - i've been out at the bar and drank 5 (8.5 % ABV) and loved every minute and after thought about it!"
"Despite the alcohol content and its high carbonation, it's extremely drinkable, although in my opinion La Chouffe is more so. I'd honestly place it up there with some of the best Belgian Pale Ale's."
"Poured into a Duvel glass. Had this many times and was my first Belgian. Still impressed by the look of this beer. Deceptively pale, explosive carbonation in every part of the glass; not just the middle or up the sides, everywhere. Three-finger head after a perfect pour that is stiff on top and rocky. Bright white in color. Smells kinda like a tripel with light spicy hops and winey, light fruity smells. Also somewhat phenolic. Taste the crisp and light spicy hop profile and the sweeter pale malts. Lighter mouthfeel and extremely bubbly. Slightly drying with a pleasant bitterness. Laces the glass from the highest point of the head all the way down. Very drinkable for the style and an excellent, easily-found Belgian. Would drink daily if I could and still have a soft spot for the beer that turned me on to Belgians."
"D - A really refreshing golden ale, considering it's strength. I drink this beer often, usually with a smile on my face. Classic."
"So perhaps there was a reason for me to pull this one out of the fridge tonight. And that is because Duvel is that good a beer; how you could you not drink it!"
"Drinkability--Even at 8.5% this goes down very easily."
"Drinkability - I'll be all Duveled out after this 750. Tasty, and easy drinking. But just not as complex as I would like. Now, the Maredsous 10..."
"I'll make sure to pick up a couple more bottles next time I go to the store!"
"this is a good beer, worth the price and I think anyone who likes Belgian beers should give it a try."
"Drinkability is really good, this goes down really easy. Amazingly crisp and refreshing beer."
"Pours a very light straw color with white chunky head with some big bubbles that doesn't go away soon. Smells a bit yeasty with some sweet spiciness. Tastes very sweet with some alcohol vapor making the mouth feel very weird, but still very good. Mouthfeel is very heavy without any carbonation burn. All in all, it's very drinkable and very tasty."
"d: very smooth & almost looks, smells, tastes, & acts like a nice sparkling wine. i've had a few of these over time & it's always interesting how the palate evolves -- not as great as i remember the 1st few times, but always great to return to."
"Honestly, this is probably not a beer I would buy a lot of at a bar (the price at Lassiter's Tavern in Atlanta for this was $7USD a bottle!). I would definitely buy this one occasionally from a good beer store. If someone had this at their house and offered it freely, I'd happily drink it though."
"The Public House in Boston hands out stickers that say ""Why not Duvel?"" and I second that thought."
"I'm disappointed in myself for waiting this long to review this gem. I'm a long established sucker for Belgian beers and have been since shortly after discovering better beers and this is truly World Class and every way. Quite possibly 'the' prime example of why Belgian Ales are held in such high esteem."
"Very good taste, wonderful aroma and altoghether an exceptional beer. My only reservation is that I feel the alcohol in my forehead almost immediately. But, oh my god!"
"Poured slowly into a chalice, it pours a light blonde with a heavy, cloudy body. The head retention is excellent and there's plenty of lacing sticking to the glass as the beer is sipped. An extremely addictive sweet smell of ripe fruits arise from the glass. The taste too is extrememly sweet, but with a big kick of peppers and alcohol to follow. The ladder will slap your tongue around, and the vast carbonation numbed my tongue. AHHH!! My palate can't take that kind of abuse yet! It still has a nice flavor though."
"D- Very good. At first I didn't see what all the fuss was about with this beer, but after having tried it a few times, my eyes have been opened. Well worth the money."
"The taste is very well balanced, with fruits and spices up front and a big, warming alcohol finish. It is quite bubbly, and almost champagne-like in texture. Still, it's really a solid beer that is worth your money. Drinkability is a touch lower because of the high alcohol and astringent finish. Otherwise, a very good beer."
"Though 'Belgian-challenged' on availability in our area, it's great to savor a brew that lives up to it's acclaim. Poured a beautiful cloudy subtle golden with an awesome white, creamy head that didn't diminish. Just an excellent flavor. A well balanced blend of malts and flavors. Exceptional mouthfeel and drinkability, with a super clean finish. I shared the four-pack with my wife and enjoyed watching her response to a relative quality brew. A newfound favorite for both of us."
"it's full and strong on the palate; alcoholic warmth doesn't come through until well into the bottle."
"Happy Birthday Pepeton! I Hope you enjoyed my 2 reviews that I had in honor of your birthday! If you're reading this, please send him a birthday beermail. He will appreciate it very much."
"Nice body, fair carbonization makes me ask for more and more."
"But for real, in this case."
"Crisp and bubbly, it finishes clean."
"D: Insert standard line about high drinkability despite high abv here: ___. A classic, and an always enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a pale yellow with secondary fermantation providing plenty of cloud-like head (it towered 1 1/2"" over the rim of my Chimay glass). Smell is slightly sweet and very aromatic. The taste is yeasty, spicy (cloves?), and wonderful. Mouthfeel of this beer is unique; it is so soft and smooth. Duvel is an awesome drinking experience."
"The taste is crisp and clean. I get fruit (apples, pears) and yeast mostly. Hop bitterness at the end. And warming of alcohol after that. Everything is crisp and clean and dry. I don't know what Miller High Life is smoking, but this is the champagne of beers, right here in my cognac glass."
"Medium body and very easy to drink for such a high alcohol content."
"D: Excellent. Very drinkable all around, especially for a beer of this strength, alcohol-wise."
"Purchased as a gift package which included three 330 ml bottles and a deep and wide tulip glass, perfect for this and just about any Belgian. 8.5% abv. Golden yellow appearance with a mushroom cloud head which was whipped cream thick and snow white. Be paitent while pouring or the head will consume the entire glass. Very faint citrusy aroma. Taste was again light with only a hint of citrus which quickly fades in the finish. Mild mouthfeel. Lace drapes the glass from start to finish. An easy drinking Belgian and one I'd recommend for both the newly initiated to the style or seasoned fan."
"750ml with cork and cage. Pours an inviting light, cloudy golden color with a huge snow white head. Smells nicely of fruit; bannanas, oranges, as well as alcohol. Tastes much bolder than I would have thought. Spice from the alcohol, earthy hops, some bannana. Less fruit forward than say La Fin du Monde but definetly bolder, for what its worth. One of the best looking brews I've seen. Not my favorite in this style, but still very good. I'd never turn it down."
"This was more than just a little bit of a downer. I pours a lovely straw golden like a pils with a titanic head. Bready and sweet in the nose, slight hint of hops. Here is where it went down hill. Sweet malt taste, but suprisingly uncomplex. I drank it at 55 degrees and even as it warmed it seemed very two dimentional. Drinks pretty easy, but was too sweet for my taste. This is not by any means my first Belgian so I had a feel for what I was getting into, but...I might just have to try this one agian."
"Thanks to Jessica & Toni for the gift pack. Merry Christmas to me. I poured a chilled bottle into my duvel chalice unhurriedly as instructed, but this baby was a foaming beast. The meringue-like head, eventually, settled and after two pours the bottle was empty. Clumps of foam stuck to the glass as the head rescinded into the golden liquid. Appearance was slightly hazy from the yeast, and very effervescent. I guess that's why the bottle made an audible ""pop"" when I opened it. Aroma was malty, sugary sweet with peppery hop notes and lightly phenolic. Taste was on the sweet side as well, but there was enough bitterness for balance. Malty, yeasty, and the alcohol was barely noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and amply bosomed, er I mean carbonated. Drinkability was very good. I had two bottles to toast the new year in style."
"Smell is yeasty with some alcohol and lemony zest. The mouthfeel is really smooth considering the carbonation that is prevalent. This is a really easy drinking, enjoyable beer. This is a very sessionable beer due to the taste and smoothnesss, but be careful it packs a punch and after a few of these you'll definitely be feeling it. This has been a very pleasant surprise and something I'll revisit quite often."
"Poured out of a 750 ml caged and corked bottle. The color was a hazy straw color with an insane white puffy head that left fantastic lacing as it dissipated. The smell is juicy, a bit sweet. However the taste is not overly sweet. There is a bit of a sweet maltiness to it, a bit of champagne, then it end dry with a little twang of bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with fizzy carbonation. This beer has great balance and is scarily drinkable. Has always been a favorite of mine since I first tried it."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden color with a large puffy white head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. It smells like yeast and spices, and also like pears. It tastes the same way to me, but with more sweetness, spicyness and fruityness to the taste. The mouthfeel is light/medium, with a lot of carbonation, almost too much. Drinkability is good, but not great because of the very high carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good beer, but I don't know if I could drink it all the time."
"The flavor carries through with a dancing array of complex, transforming flavors...refreshing like a pilsener, yet ale-like fruity sweetness and pleasing bitterness dance across the tongue. Every sip brings something new; no aspect of the character dominates, the pilsener/Belgian ale kaleidoscope of flavors makes this both a refreshing, delicious beer and one that can be contemplated."
"I have enjoyed this beer for a couple of years. It was one of the first Belgium beers I ever tasted. I think the best way to enjoy this beer is with a number of friends when you have the time to sit back talk and enjoy each others company. It should always be presented in the proper glass and poured properly to fully enjoy this beer master."
"33cL bottle from A-1 to-go in Gardiner. Light yellow translucent body with several inches of white head. Smells malty, citrusy, and slightly skunky (uh-oh...). Tastes citrusy and peppery with a hint of skunk... On the upper side of light-bodied, with a fair bit of carbonation in this one. Relatively drinkable. I have to believe this wasn't the best bottle. I'm sure I'll try it again though."
"Overall a very nice, light refreshing beer with some good Belgian hints and a beautiful appearance."
"d-I like this alot.Im gladd I have 3 more of them in storage.Thanks to my girl for picking me up the gift pack and thanks to Duvel for making this fine brew."
"This is kind of the gold standard when it comes to appearance. A rocky, yet fluffy white head with fine white bubbles and lacing that never stops. Aroma of belgian farmhouse funk and sweet malt and light candi sugar. The taste expands on the aroma with a mellow bitterness over candi sugar and light malts. Very drinkable. Damn what a beer."
"Despite owning large snifters, I am glad I bought the gift pack with the Duvel snifter. This is the type of beer to enjoy in the labeled glassware as is the tradition and expectation in much of Europe. This is a great sipper and a must-try for true beer enthusiasts."
"One of the best brews I've had. The paleness is deceiving. This is delicious. I'm going to love the next 4 that came with the pack."
"Great combination of yeast character and noble hops. A classic."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite among the Belgians but I respect it for what it is; always welcome when available"
"Slick mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable. Must get more...soon."
"However, the taste (good Lord - the TASTE!!!) more than made up for this, and this is certainly a beer I will be drinking again."
"Drinks pretty easy for the abv. A nice Belgian pale, that probably has done more to define the style than any other offering, just because it its widespread availability. Either this or Palm was among the 1st Belgian ales I ever had. Oh, the memories!"
"Take the ""Pour Unhurriedly"" statement on the bottle very seriously, as this beer will escape the confines of your glass with no objection. Quite a spectacle this beer creates, the bubbles in the beer hurl themselves like their is a storm brewing in the liquid, to form the rich creamy white head which grows like nobodies concern. A very aromatic scent, floral and fruity, quite welcoming. The taste is rich in flavor, fruity, slightly hop-y, and strong in the alcohol region. This beer reminds me of champagne, without the outrageous amount of carbonation and sweetness. This wont be the last time I shall enjoy this brew, thatÂs for sure..."
"Probably one of the best pale belgians I've tasted in the US, it still lives up to itÂs reputation."
"Wow. What a Beer. It has hazy golden color with a nice big fluffy white head that laced all the way down. It smelled of vibrant citrus and tasted overwhemingly of fruits and citrus. The taste just overwhelms you when it hits your taste buds. It felt very fullbodied, and is very smooth. I agree with a previous reviewer that this beer is best to be sipped and savored. I didn't want this glass to ever run dry."
"33cl 2005 bottle. Effervescent, pale/golden in color, with a large white pillow like head. Aroma of spices, clove, bananas, pineapples, and some earthy/mustiness. Flavor dances across your tong with pepper, spices and some metallic hints. Very dry bitterness and a little alcohol warming on the way down."
"Overall, a good beer and very drinkable for its style. It seems like a good sipping beer -- nice to unwind with at the end of a long worknight. I will say, however, that it wasn't as good as I expected. I actually found the lower-rated (on here at least) and less expensive Don de Dieu from Unibroue to be much more enjoyable."
"Very drinkable for a strong ale. Flavors are laid back, allowing for a full night of sipping."
"Pour out a golden yellow color with a huge head that lasts a long time. Left lacing. Carbonation bubbles floating up from the bottom of the glass. With a citrus, fruity, yeasty aromas. Flavors of Citrus, tartness, hops, yeast. Mouth feel is light bodied, with high carbonation. Gaseous feeling. A beer to try, with very little complexity, yet is not overwhelmed by alcohol. It is a decent interpretation worth a try. After warming up and carbonation dies down more of a flavor and aroma."
"D- Every sip is a treat. You can pick out a different taste every time you drink. I need to age some of this stuff..."
"This is a nice beer to pair with fish. It is fairly easy drinking regardless of the fact that the alcohol can become a bit overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Fabulous. Take time to enjoy a Duvel. A great beer for introducing someone to the beers of Belgium."
"This beer poured a clear light yellow with a thick creamy head. It is highly carbonated and you can see the carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass (this beer was poured in a Duvel glass and the bubbles emanated from the bottom center of the glass). It has very nice lacing. It has a sour/sweet smell. The taste is hoppy and cereal, with a bit of sourness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a heavy dose of noticeable carbonation which is brite in the mouth. This is a delicious beer that is well balanced and would be quite drinkable on a hot day;"
"Holy crap. This is one fine beer. Poured it into an oversize wine glass, the head is just amazing, billowing out the top but staying intact. Thick white foam, looks like meringue. Very light golden color, with continuous bubbles rising to the top, looks almost like champagne. Very nice fruity, yeasty smell. Nice light, dry taste. I mainly taste some apple flavor and yeast. Even at 8.5% ABV, I'm not tasting any alcohol. So, be careful. This is very good, a wonderful sipping beer. I think we can move Miller High-Life's title over to this as the true ""Champagne of Beers."" I think this beer is too good that I'll have to limit it to special occasions. I don't want to spoil myself."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color. The huge frothy white head is the show stealer here. Mountains of sticky foam make you anxious to give this one a sip. The smell is of belgian yeastyness, slight pepper and fruity. The Saaz hops come through too. The first sip gave me a huge wheat impression. Some lemon zest shows along with some alcohol. As it warms the malt flavors come though more distinctly along with some earthy tones. Very lively highly carbonated mouthfeel. Dry finish. Overall, this one didn't dissapoint. A beer that is worth the hype it gets."
"D - not one for a session, but as a sipper its great, wouldnt want more than 1 in a night, a belgian to savour!"
"In closing, I have no idea why in the hell it took me so long to try this legend of a brew, but it will be followed by many, many more. Be careful, though... that 8.5 do pack a whallop."
"Medium bodied with a huge, insane carbonation. Very, very drinkable, just an all around awesome beer."
"On a side note, this is the beer I drank after each of the three Devils Stanley Cup wins. Duvel... Devil. Let's go Devils!!!"
"This beer is most enjoyed when you have the opportunity to slow down which is required right off the bat when you are forced to slowly pour this brew. I feel that this is the type of beer that can put a huge smile on your face when your mood calls for a Belguim."
"This is an excellent beer. Highly potent, but drinkable nevertheless. It will sneak up on you. Enjoy."
"The mouth is heavier than I was expecting from such a pale beer, but then it does have 8.5% alcohol. However, it's not nearly as filling as, say, Rochefort 10. The carbonation is extremely crisp and refreshing, like champagne."
"What a thing of beauty Duvel is, sitting just poured into its own branded glass, I'm almost moved to tears just looking at it. Clear lager-like golden beneath topped with the most gigantic white head that fills the rest of the glass. Lasts forever, leaving clumps of foam on the glass during drinking. I could sit and smell this all day,although describing aromas of banana and Juicy Fruit doesn't quite convey it. Explosive flavour on tasting with a lingering length. You would not know the high alcohol. Great mouthfeel, fine carbonation. Drinkable? Hell yeah. Pure enjoyment. Undoubtedly one of the world's great beers."
"Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lots of tingly carbonation and a very dry finish that lasts quite a while. Decently drinkable, but the high alcohol content and uniquely dry flavor could prevent me from drinking more than one or two."
"Â¡Salud!"
"I'm really blessed by revisiting this one. This is a Belgian Blonde Ale as the gods intended. Highly recomended!"
"This beer puts to death the myth that a light colored beer has no flavor. I made the mistake of not being that carefull when I poored it and the head just took off! Wow what a huge, fluffy, white head with lots of lacing that lasts. The smell is really sweet with what I think is the yeast flavor coming through also. It has a great balance to it. You barely notice the alcohol. This beer finishes well with a smoothe dry finish. I haven't tried too many European brews but i'm looking forward to getting more aquainted after having tried this one."
"Highly recommended brew. Easy to locate and is well worth picking up."
"The color is so golden and clear like a beer night light. For being bottled condition the clarity is so fine. Next comes the complex orange,pear brandy, green apple mid-palate. A like a good movie there's a strange twist on the finish has a smooth stony dryness. I have a buddy who only drinks domestic swill and he even loved this beer. Duvel beer is a great way to taste the saaz hops shining thru this world class brew."
" Wavz"
"note: I have now tried this from both sized bottles, and, i must say that the larger, corked version seems to have more noticeable alcohol in both the taste and the smell. (the smaller, capped version is reviewed above.)"
"Side note: The bottle has a ""best before"" date on it which reads 03/2009. Might be fun to leave this one in the cellar for a year and check back on it."
"Â¡Salud!"
"This is a beautiful beer and it's relatively easy to find, and I often overlook it. Dangerously drinkable. Cheers."
"If only I could buy this beer often. Simply put, one of the best beers I've ever had, if not the one. Citrus aromas, with a complex sweet and citrus taste. Carbonation and alcohol mouthfeel, a very heavy beer (which is what one should expect when drinking a strong pale ale, right). I could drink this forever..."
"This would be a great beer to introduce neophytes to Belgian beers. It's definitely Belgian, but not overwhelming in any way. Its very well made, well balanced and crisp, with enough ABV to please anyone. It also has a nice ""yeastiness"" which is typical to many Belgian beers. I really like this beer, and would drink one anytime."
"D - very tasty, a classic. Alcohol content and cost makes it a little prohibitive to drink a ton."
"Duvel means Devil. Only gets smoother as it warms. This is an extremely delightful beer. Definitely top of the beer food chain. Try this one, and you won't be dissapointed. This one was reasonably fresh, as it still has two and a half years before its ""best by"" date (April 2009). Should be good fresh or aged."
"Drinkability: An exellent belgian pale ale , very well balanced , flavorful , and elegant. With a nice alcohol kick to boot! Great beer!"
"Much better than I remembered it to be. I'll be sure to keep a bunch of these in the fridge over the winter, it warms you up nicely."
"Drinkability: This is good stuff, completely enjoyable and respectable."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Very drinkable and food friendly."
"Pours into the Duvel glass with a huge meringue-like head. Carbonation is awesome with the stream of bubbles from the center of the glass. So very smooth with just a touch of the alcohol content showing through. Smells great, so convenient to bury your nose in that glass and savour the aroma as you have another sip. A totally enjoyable experience."
"drinkability: yeah, this one goes down good, really a fantatic drinker that sort of demands quick drinking. Yes you savor it, but it's pretty hard to go slow on it. This beer is worthy of the respect it gets. A must try, and a must re-buy."
"D: I struggled and struggled to finish my 750 mL, but ended up tossing the rest. If you want a quick buzz go for it. But a good beer? Try DFH or stone. Because all I tasted here was hype. Belgian beers can make some crazy good brews, but this was not one of them."
"Overall, just an excellent beer. Honestly i'm not into it being so dry, but it is still great. I have mentioned the alcohol in some places, but i do think it does cover the alc content quite nicely. I would love to have this again and again, but personally i'm a la fin du monde fan (sweeter)."
"A great beer. It's strong and complex enough that you could sip and savor it. But it's brewed to hide the strength so you could also drink it as a thirst quencher. One of my favorites."
"This is great!"
" I'd label this more interesting and unique than drinkable. It's good but I doubt I'd ever be inclined to drink more than half a 750 and even that's pushing it."
"*I poured this from a 330mL bottle with a best by date of 03 2007."
"This ale is highly drinkable.I could always have four pack of Duvel on hand, like Joe Six Pack keeps a sixer of Bud."
"Drinkability: I've learned the hard way that I have to be careful with this one. It looks like a Pilsener, but drinking it like a Pilsener is a bad idea. A sipping beer."
"This is, without a doubt, the greatest looking beer of all time!! It looks as if someone put cool whip in yer brew. Great creamy head, never goes away with some nice fruit esthers. Lacing all the way down the glass. Smooth beer and highly drinkable as the alcohol is undetectable. Feels remarkable on the palate. I highly recommend this one and it is resonably priced."
"This is a very good brew. Great for a nice hot day. Could drink this on a regular basis."
"Drinkability - This is one of my top 5 beers. Please pass me another, and another. Not at the same time however, this 8.5% adv will knock you on your arse!"
"and a few Hefewiesen kind of beers."
"Picked up a 4 pack at Alpine Beverage in Helen, GA on a recent visit. Pours a beautiful bright gold color with a head that just won't quit. Even with a relaxed pour, the head just billows up thick, creamy, rocky and just will not go away. Nice thick lacing clings to the glass. Very complex aroma of fruit, citrus, yeast and spice. Taste is well balanced and complex. Hinds of fruit, peppery yeast and just the right amount of bitteness to balance the malt sweetness. A true classic and one to savor!"
"D: A very good belgian ale of any style."
"Drinkability: easy to drink sessionable beer. Too bad it costs a shitload. It's not really worth the price IMO"
"Poured a hazy, extremely pale, straw-like yellow with tiny bubbles flowing up the side of the glass. An absolutely ridiculous head - huge, fluffy, rocky, like a huge cloud floating on my beer. Terrific lacing as well. Smells of yeast, cloves, spiciness, white grapes. Taste is extremely crisp. Touches of yeast, bready, clove, some bananas, spices. It starts off rather sweet and evolves into a very tart and semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but feels very light, champagne-like carbonation - tons of tiny little bubbles. This beer, in many ways, does remind me of a fine glass of champagne. Maybe Miller, with their moniker ""Champagne of Beers"" could use a lesson or two from the Belgians. This is the true ""Champagne of Beers."""
"D: A delicious drink, seems too easy to not stop at one. ""Devilishly"" sneaky big ABV. A personal favorite which I recommend highly. If 'drinkable' is found in the dictionary, there's a picture of Duvel next to it, which is kinda scary when the ABV is 8.5%."
"Drinkable, definitely drinkable."
"This beer has a lovely lushes head that rises to the top off its glass. The effervescence is comparable to Champagne. The sent is of citrous, cloves, pleasant mild alcohol vapors and so much more. The taste is wonderful. If you allow it to wander to the tip of your tongue it will over power your taste with it's wonderful carbonation. It's delicious, it only makes me want more ( in fact I am about to go to the store and buy another four pack). This beer is amazing, both refreshing and delicious, but one must be careful, on an empty stomach it will pack quite a wallop. Thank you Duvel"
"The beer itself is my benchmark for Belgian Ales. Beautiful golden body. Fluffy white head. Sweet, malty nose. Sweet, sugar-like taste with that fantastic bite at the end thanks to the high alcohol content and the yeast strain. Mouthfeel is light and welcoming, and drinkability is scary good."
"Duvel is one of the best, much respect goes out to this beer. Definitely recommended."
"Citric flavor, with spices, coriander and fruits in the mouth. Citrusy, bready and flowery. Very complex you keep discovering things as you drink."
"drinkability is good. as i said above, it's dry and hides the alcohol fairly well, which leads to a nice, drinkable beer."
"I'm not too sure if I scored this beer in excess of its worth, as I haven't reviewed that many beers, or tasted that many of this particular style. However, even Carling swilling philistine friends of mine have been impressed with this, so maybe it deserves its score."
"Duvel is very drinkable, but hits you in the head after 3 glasses and even then I don't feel like quiting. Body is pretty empty."
"This is fine Belgian golden ale and a good example of the style. This is probably not my favorite within the style, but very good none-the-less."
"Poured in its own wide chalice it creates a thick head that slowly settles. The color is yellow with lots of bubbles. The smell, like the taste has a certain bitterness in it that reminds me of pilsner beer. This is the reason I shied away from it for years but lately I learned to appreciate it more. Oh, you live and learn!"
"I had a pretty good idea that I would like Duvel when I finally got around to trying it. I didn't realize, however, just how truly special it is. I don't know if 'it's a style unto itself' as the brewery claims, but it's certainly the best BSPA that I've ever had the pleasure to consume and is the new gold standard by which all others will now be judged."
"Overall, a good drinker, and a wonderful revisit."
"Very drinkable- perilously so. Slides right down with no hint of the 8.5% abv, and with enough interesting flavors to keep you coming back. On top of that, its quite quenching. Really an outstanding beer, and something I've drunk over and over again through the years."
"Pale yellow color is distinct and ""pretty"" (maybe too much so) with beautiful foamy, aromatic, and brilliant white clean head. Smell of mild hops and flowers, would make a wonderful perfume. Complex taste, like the aroma, with mild hops fading to flowers and almost no hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very nice, perfect carbonation and very active. Also surprisingly refreshing, I could drink this all day. This is a brilliant crafted beer, but doesn't rate perfectly for me since it doesn't adequately incorporate malts into the flavor."
"Even though this is a strong beer, it is very drinkable and I would love to have a couple of these 750's at one sitting."
"Overall a beautifully crafted beer. Kingpin of its style, and given its generally good availability, I would say I will be drinking this again and again with no compunctions."
"An amazingly easy beer to drink. While their was a hint of alcohol in the aroma it was not noticable while drinking and tasting. A wonderfully decadent session could be had with this brew. This is something ill be enjoying again."
"Dangerous one here...goes down too easy and is well received from me this time of year. A must try if you are working to expand your pallet towards the style."
"Overall this a very quality Belgian ale. The flavors are strong but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasurable. It has a very nice smell as well. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian ales."
" This is a pure classic. enjoy."
"Drinkability: I could easily drink 4 of these and be retarded but I would feel retarded because why would I spend that kind of money unless I bought it outside of a bar. I would hope that I would be able to appreciate it well enough after 2. Further I'd probably cherish this too much to drink it more once a month."
"This bottle conditioned beer pours a straw yellow almost to the color of American Macro Lager but not as urine looking. Pours a huge fluffy white head that takes forever to disipate. It took a couple of minutes, close to 3-5, for me to pour all the beer into my glass. It smelled strongly of Belgian yeast with a nice amount of malts. The taste followed the taste with a fruity yeasty taste with the sweet malts but left my palate with a semi dry body that was suprising for such a thin body. I was expecting to be extremely dry but it had just a bit of the residual sugar build up on my tounge. It was a nice beer for a hot day, which it was 94F with a heat index of over 108F. I would buy this again on a hot day but by no means is it my favorite Belgian."
"This is my first beer review since becoming interested in beer outside the American macro scene. A tough beer to pour, it says ""pour unhurriedly"" right on the bottle and they mean it! You have to lay your glass nearly sideways and pour very slowly when starting to pour to avoid a huge head build up. Taste is good, and clean, with a little bite at the finish. Tastes fairly simliar to a pinsler except with loads and loads of flavor. A hint of fruit, and maybe a breath of peach are present too. I would like to try again!"
"Unfortunately, this was given to me to pour in a 20 oz. pint-type glass. Lots and lots of head, some due to my bad pouring. This one just typifies a very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Perfectly balanced with hops and malts, not hot at all (very smooth). Nice mouthfeel and easy to drink. I've enjoyed others by this style even better, but in my opinion, this one should be the standard of high quality.."
"I'll grab this one again, preferably in a 4- or 6-pack if it's available."
"This is one of the defining Belgian strong pale ales and it is easy to see why."
"I do recognize this as a landmark beer, and respect it for that. And I think it's really good, but I feel like some gush over it a little more than it deserves."
"Final verdict - Well, let me start by saying I have a fairly heavy moustache (pssh to those who trim!) and there has not been one time drinking this beer that I've not sucked the stray beer out of it. I enjoy and respect this beer, and it's finally nice to find something truly good in a local grocery store (hannafords). Bottom line? buy this beer."
"This is a drinkable beer, but the ABV dictates moderation. Not a particularly session-able brew in my opinion, but a very full flavored, and well balanced strong ale."
"This is a fantastic beer. The appearance is bright golden, with a billowing and I do mean billowing head. Very oily lacing made its way down the glass. The smell is just like the taste. A hint of alcohol, a lot of orange peel and lemon, with some sour malt. Excellent. Mouthfeel was very good as well still very carbonated but not enough to inhibit its drinkability."
"D- goes down easily, smooth taste for a strong ale"
" Exquisite! Outstanding and highly reccomended!"
"i had tried this beer once before in scotland, and i remember it as haveing a more intense alcohol presence. i wonder if, like guiness, they alter their recipe slightly based on the market they are selling to, or perhaps there were other factors like food or serving type that contributed to my discrepency."
"The appearance was a light straw/pale gold color, with streams of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head was huge and it stuck around for a long time. Classic lacing as I finished the beer. The smell had a lot in it, some malt, phenol/medicinal tones, eucalyptus (sp?), and clove. Taste was equally complex, with the malt hitting you first, then some apples and sort of a medicinal taste, finally finishing with bitterness and pepper. Mouthfeel was warmth from the alcohol, tingling from the carb, and a dry finish. Very easy to drink despite ABV. An excellent beer."
"I plan to drink again and review again :)"
"Very good beer. Poured from bomber into oversized wine glass. Probably the best appearance IÂve ever seen. Started out clear golden with a thick white pillowy head with excellent lacing. As the bottle progressed, the appearance turned more hazy amber, still with the same head. Fruity aroma was prevalent from the beginning. Taste seemed a mixture of the fruit and also a hint of spice, possibly clove. The 8.5% alcohol was very discreet; present but not tasted. A great finish topped off a very pleasant drinking experience."
"Drinkability: I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't like this. This could be a fine introduction to the world of good beer. One complaint: too much carbonation - I had to drink it slower than I wanted to ;) In the battle of the Belgian Strong Pale Ales, in my opinion Duvel wins, but it's tough to compare. While classified in the same style, La Fin du Monde is fruitier and has more body, while Duvel is dryer, more approachable, and looks better in the glass."
"a fine easy drinkable belgian ale this is. one of my favorites."
"Overall impression: Very good. I get why this is classic but it doesn't blow my doors off. The alcohol is well hidden but the carbonation is a bit powerful at times. Still, one to hold as a gold standard. Worth trying on the road to beer advocacy. Recommended."
"Well, it's been too long of wait before I've been able to try this beer. First thing you notice is, as a pale/golden ale, it's about as pale as you can get. Very light yellow with as huge of a bubbly white head as you want. The smell is fruity and of alcohol and the taste is the exact same. I would describe it as a mini-champagne."
"Proper glassware but they served it a bone chilling temps. I let the bottle sit unopened as I worked through two other beers, finally it had warmed up some. As always this is a beautiful pour, golden clear with a head that filled the glass out. The head takes a minute to settle and the smell is of spicey hops topped back with a malt ester wind that carries the idea of alcohol. The glass is starting to be laced as I take the first sip. Truly an artful construction of a golden ale with high ester yeast. Slightly fruity and sweet with a spice zing from the hops and alcohol make a play on the tongue. Finishes very clean with a nice full yet light body. Very drinkable just be warned on the near 9%."
"Drinkability - If I had to bring one beer to a deserted island for the rest of my life, it would be Duvel, hands down."
"Pours out a clear, golden yellow with a huge head. It was highly carbonated, too. It smelled of alcohol, corn and grass. The taste was spicy and hoppy. I also detected a clove or vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy. It is highly drinkable, except for the 8.5% ABV."
"I have had this beer about three times each time in a large bottle with champagne like cork. The carbonation like the cork is very similar to champagne. The beer has a nice white head and beautiful golden color. The smell has hints of citrus. The taste is clean crisp and has a slight warm taste from the high ABV. Good classic Belgian strong pale ale."
"We'll be carrying this at Cafe D soon, fer sure."
"Pours a highly carbonated bubbly golden body with a strong thick white head. The aroma is floural, sweet candy, musty, golden raisins, citrus lemon, with grassy fresh notes. This is a very complex nose that just gets your senses ready for a taste. The taste is tart upfront, crisp, fresh with a sour/bitter tanginess in the back of the throat. The alcohal is warming but not overpowering, this is a classic belgian pale ale very nice."
"This was my first experience with Duvel and I have to tell you, this may be one of the best ales I have ever had! I know, pretty strong statement. From the aroma as soon as you start to pour all the way to the last drop, this is a winner from the word go. I was lucky enough to get a free Duvel glass and it really seems to make a difference with this beer. At 8.5% and $12.00 for a 4-pack, this is a ""special occasion"" drink. I plan on always having at least a 4-pack or two on hand for when I really want a world class ale/beer."
"D: I hate the mouthfeel, but ignoring that, this is a wonderful Belgian."
"Purchased for about seven bucks at Bittersweet Liquors, along with a four pack each of La Fin Du Monde and Allagash white."
"Very drinkable going down, but watch out when you stand up, it's a little potent. Great beer.!"
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy...carbonation fills you completely and pushes the warming alcohol down to your belly."
"This is a pour to be thankful of. Straw colored body is topped by what you'd think of as a nitro tap head. Nose is just too faint for me. I get a smidge of lemon and what I can only call white grapes. Taste is pretty much identical to the nose ... I guess my gripe is that it doesn't do more. It's decent but there's just too much out there that I'd buy first."
"This pours a yellow straw with a giant white foamy head. The carbonation of this beer is huge. The smell is wheat, candy sugar, and some citrus,lemon or orange? The taste is crisp refreshing citrus lemon, wheat, candy sugar, and spices,pepper and coriander. The m/f is light and well balanced with a great mixture of flavors. This is a classic beer that should not be missed. A beer for all seasons. Cheers."
"I could drink them all day and all night long. Just excellent."
"Thanks go to mynie for the bottle."
"amazing"
"A 'must have' in the back of the cooler for just the right occasions."
"Jen: I would have to say that the second time around with this brew is better (or maybe it is the sudden heat wave that makes it so refreshing). It is light and bubbly, with a bit of tartness at the end. It is smooth with an almost creaminess to it. This brew is well crafted and quite easy to drink, but be careful, it is 8.5%!"
"Reviewing a corked and caged 750mL bottle. Cork comes flying off without much effort. Pours a beautiful straw yellow with lively carbonation rising to the top much like a champagne creating one of the fluffiest heads I have ever seen! The head is thick and fluffy like whipped cream. Aroma is fruity, spicey and yeasty. Again, this is probably the most beautiful head I have ever seen! Taste is very dry and yeasty with earthy and slightly spicey flavors. Mouthfeel is light and crisp that can be quite prickly from the carbonation. This is definately a world class brew! I bow down even to the empty bottle as it is contained something of pure art that I greatly admire and enjoy."
"Overall, a very nice brew and a good gateway beer for someone who is looking to branch out into Belgians."
"This beer is , for me, an almost perfect compromise between complexity and drinkability. Recommended."
"Yet another beer that I have great respect for and therefore, deserves a review. Poured (appropriately enough) into a Duvel glass slowly, to form a huge white stucky head that faded into chunks of foam as it faded. Coloration was similar to what champaigne looks like, very lush looking. In the nose were some light fruity apple flavors, a touch of mild earthiness, pears, overall extremely clean. Flavors detected included spicy pepper in the beginning, fruit in the middle, and alcohol hitting you right at the end. Duvel is one crisp beer, and by crisp I mean that it is pretty big on the carbonation. This one seems to turn to foam straight away when sipping, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I could see myself drinking a few of these and liking it more with each sip. I was never truly impressed with this beer until I gave it a fair chance, and began to appreciate the vast amount of complexities it has to offer. A superb beer."
"Crystal clear with a lot of carbonation and a cloudy white head. A sweet grassy smell. Has the characteristic hops of a pilsner. An interesting smell. Flavor of this beer is more bitter than most belgians. It opens with a sour/bitter almost champagne like flavor without the sweetness and has the characteristic finish of a belgian. Very dry. Not overly alcoholic, but more than I am used to in the style. It is a good beer, just nothing I would call exceptional."
"Overall, this is the classic BSPA. Dangerously easy to drink. I really enjoy the spicy yeasty flavors but the general sweetness seems a little much to my taste."
"Duvel all the time would be the best."
"Thats just classic Belgian ale right there. Devilish only in its wicked level of drinkibility."
"A very fine and drinkable beer."
"The aroma is just as delicate as the appearance (pretty much to a fault), with just the softest, slightest hint of spicy hops laced with spun sugar. The mouthfeel is soft, soft like the finest pilsner. The flavor of this beer is of sweet, honeyish malt, balanced just perfectly by subtle hops and its own minerally dryness. Perilously drinkable, Duvel is despite its demonic name, an exceptionally delicate and pure brew. Although seemingly not quite as spicy and hoppy as I recall from years ago, this is still an exceptionally well crafted ale."
"Had the 750 all to myself, and loved it. Though more than that would require sharing, most likely."
"I almost always prefer the better brews at higher temperatures - I can discern the flavors better. Duvel is the exception - when chilled slightly, it comes alive with a zesty, almost perfume-like taste that wasn't there when it was warmed. I can barely detect any alcohol, at any temp range. The color is pedestrian, however, and the lacing/head unimpressive. Aside from the boring physical attributes, the gustatory experience makes Duvel a solid choice for any serious beer drinker."
"This one became more filling as the alcohol presented itself. The sparkling nature of this one reeled me in but then I hit a wall; I dont think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"You must try."
"Drinkability - this goes down so very easy and is completely satifying that you have to have the next one one. The high abv is totally not evident from the taste, and only after you've had a few does that fact sink in. Still, if you don't have to drive, or be to work in the morning.. well, try not to get carried away, the hangover's a b&%#$ if you do. This is excellent beer."
"This brew pours a clear pale yellow-orange color. The head is massive, billowy and white, and lasts forever. The aroma is of oranges and lemons with a barnyard funk in the background. It is rather mellow, however, more mellow than other strong pales that I have had. The taste is of citrus with an earthy and alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and very dry. Overall, this beer is easy to enjoy. However, I choose La Fin Du Monde over Duvel anyday, as La FIn is so much more complex."
"Pours a transparent gold color with a huge fluffy head that recedes leaving lacing like you see in your dreams. Smells good. Sweet bananas and overripe melons. Taste is spiced and fruity. Lots of melon and banana (like the smell) but also a very pronounced clove. Mouth is medium, silky smooth and dry. Perfection, really. Drinkablity would only be helped if I had another, because I would drink it if I did."
"D - Very drinkable for such a strong beer. A classic that doesn't disappoint."
"A 750ml bottle with a best before date of 2/08. A beautiful yellow color with the thickest head I have ever seen. Nice carbonation. I just sat and looked at the glass for a while. It has a sweet, vaguely citrus, odor with some grain. A sweet taste, some malt/yeast, dry on the palate. A wonderful beer."
"CRUX: SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE."
"Ah, the Duvel is a beauty to behold in a 750ml bottle. But even more sensual foaming out of a stemless wine glass, This sweet nectar pours a clear, bubbly, golden color. The head is monstrous (so much so that I was tempted to eat it witha spoon), the loud uncorking was a harbinger of this foamy beast. The smell is sweet, faintly citrus (orange peels come to mind), but not overwhelming. The taste is slightly sweet and nonalcoholoic. The after taste is pleasantly crisp. This is a very nice Belgian ale. I will certainly seek it out again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied. The beer is crisp with a dry finish. The beer is well balanced. This is a very tasty beer treat from the Beer Gods. This is a nearly perfect beer drinking experience. There is very little a man could ask for from his beer."
"Overall Impression: I first tried this about 3 years ago just as I was getting into BA, and I was disappointed; too much bite, just too funky. Now I find it to be much more enjoyable. I like the Belgian aspects, but the carbonation level is just a bit annoying to me. Even though IÂm not wowed, I respect the craftsmanship and enjoyed the stubby little bottle (which will see many future homebrews). I think this is a bit over rated, but a solid beer worth trying."
"The mouthfeel is perfect as the carbonation is high enough to give the sweetness of the malt a perfect balance so as not to be cloying. I find it very hard to believe that no kettle sugars were used in this ale as it has such a clean flavor and is so drinkable. I bet i could convert many Bud drinkers to this if it were cheaper and more readily available. I had to drive into the next state (California) to get this but on my next trip i will definetly get one more."
"Pours a pale golden with a big fluffy white head. The aroma is wonderfully fruity with notes of bananas, pears and peaches. The flavor is apricots, grapes, pepper, lemon and apple. The finish is of a medium length, tart and bitter. Mouthfeel is light with very lively carbonation."
"Duvel is just plain outstanding. It has excellent flavors, balance, and smoothness like no other. Right up there in my favorites."
"Mouthfeel is hurt a bit by this beer's charictaristic carbonation. It's just a bit too agressive. Drinkability is dangerously high."
"one highly, Cheers !"
"This is definitely a drinkable beer, almost dangerously so. Definitely good stuff. When there's a lot of alcohol, I prefer to know it bodily. Better to know you're drunk than to not realize it..."
"Sunny yellow in colour with a bit of haze. Huge carbonation with a very lasting head. Strong yeasty aroma, as one would expect from this type of beer, along with some more subtle notes of light malt, citrus, and a touch of spice. Tastes of buttered bread, lemon, and a hint of pepper. Warming, with a mild grassy hop flavor on the finish."
"Note: left three ounces in the glass and swirled and dumped the yeast in. Let it settle a bit -- in my mind, this completes the beer: makes the head huge and rocky, rounds out the mouthfeel, dries the finish, and fills out the flavor. Much better. I would pour this like a Hefeweizen the next time, but then I'm a yeast nut."
"This may very well be my favorite brew, seems to be a perfect marrige of pils & trippel. Poured into my favorite Trmens glass I found it remarkably drinkable especially for an 8.5% beer. A bit hoppier than typical belgian gold ales but nowhere near dominating. A regenerating white head & golden hue are somewhat hypnotic I keep staring. Sip after bigger sip and so on, I pour another ""Devil"""
"I have mixed feelings regarding the drinkability. For one, the 8.5% abv is nowhere to be found in this light crisp beverage. On the other hand, the carbonation is so extreme that it kinda ruins this brew for me. So I will leave it at this... while I think this brew is different, and I respect that, it is not for me. I doubt I'll be dropping $8 for a 750ml again any time soon."
"WOW! I poured this into a Duvel glass. It pours a gold color with an amazing, almost overwhelming head with high carbonation. It smelled floral with a tinge of alcohol. The taste was like biting into a lightly sugared, spiked green apple. It was very refreshing and unique. I ordered another and let others taste it and everyone was simply amazed at the unique flavor. This is a beer unto itself. The taste of alcohol does become apparent, otherwise it would be endlessly drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is nicely balance and cleansing. Overall, a very refreshing, crisp and wonderful pale ale. Very impressive. Amazingly, I didn't taste the 8.5% ABV, but I defnitely feel it. While I would like to, I certainly couldn't drink too many of these in a night. It did go well with my stuff salmon."
"Ahhh...Duvel. A fan favew of mine. Pours hazy yellow with a head that lives forever, smells a bit sweet and yeasty. Taste is a very powerful yeasty, hoppy flavors with a bit of alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is really nice and finishes up slightly bitter. A nice sipping beer after dinner."
"This is a great beer. I hope I come across this again often."
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into my brand-new authentic Duvel goblet. Light golden color with a MASSIVE foamy head (fills half the goblet) that stays around forever & clings to the sides of the glass. Tons of bubbles rise to the top, especially a pillar of carbonation in the middle where the stem meets the bottom of the glass. Aroma is very sweet with hints of fruit. Taste is surprisingly dry considering the aroma. There is some initial sweetness followed by a dry, white wine type of bitterness. There is a sharp, spicy bite of yeast, hops, and alcohol in the swallow, but nothing overwhelming. Medium mouthfeel that tingles on the tongue from all the carbonation. All in all, pretty good stuff!! Not quite on the level of say, Delerium Tremens, but not a bad 2nd choice, either. Well worth the price."
"CheersÂ"
"Pours a clear straw, then clouded by the yeast pour. Forms a dense head that fills the glass, then settles to hills of foam that retain very well and leave a thin sticky film on the glass. Abundance of tiny carbonation bubbles racing to the top. Heavy belgian phenolic aroma like bananas and lemons, with a mild medicinal note. Noble hops and a pale malt background round out the nose. Whiff of ester as it warms. First sip is sweet pale malt, with zesty citrus and light fruity phenols gently washing over the palate. Mild yeast bite in the aftertaste, with a snap of well-attentuated alcohol that is subdued by a faint hop bitterness for a nearly perfect balance of flavor. The carbonation is high, but not overdone; the light/medium body and results in a lively yet extra smooth mouthfeel. The phenols linger in the finish but fade and the drinkability remains high considering the ABV. Nearly perfect execution of style, very sexy."
"Belgian Strong Pale Ales are not one of my favorite styles, but Ido like the Duvel. Appearance is wuite nice: fluffy head and a great golden color. Aroma is heavy on the yeast and quite earthy. Very refreshing, but very carbonated. Too carbonated for my liking. However, this beer is a great example of the style."
"Very easy going down, and deceptive (concerning the alcohol content). I liked it, but there are other pale Belgian strong ales I would choose first."
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle, Duvel has a brilliant gold color with a huge pillowy head that wouldn't go away. Every time I scooped some of the head out, it just kept coming back. Aroma was sweet and winey, almost champagne-like. The beer was quite sweet but had a dry finish with a slight herbal hoppiness. Duvel was smooth on the palate and had excellent balance between the sweetness and dryness. This beer is incredibly drinkable for the strength. In my opinion, this is the ""Champagne of Beers"". Excellent!"
"Aromas are estery, alcoholic, dried fruits are detected. Akin to any tripel or belgian pale I've smelled. Incredible carbonation tickles the tongue. Sweetness about with a little sour bite. This brew is struggling to hide the alcohol as it is ever so apparent. As a result, the drinkability suffers; I will definitely enjoy this bottle, but I don't think I could have anymore. Hops are nowhere to be seen. This is simply a mouthful of overcarbonated alcohol. Though I suppose that's what the devil would be if he was a beer."
"I like it served a lot colder than is recommended, the cold takes a shade of the gas out. The small 11.2oz bottles are more fizzy than the large. The gas balance is better at 34F in the small bottles than the larger ones."
"D - Each Belgian I try gets better and better with this one being the best. It could be I've grown accustomed to the taste or I just keep picking better beers. I'd like to think with this one, the latter holds true. Careful with this one - it doesn't have the heavy feeling of a 8.5% ABV beer. You could easily get hammered on this one without even knowing it. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability - good beer, not really worth cellaring though. It keeps great, but it doesn't turn into anything special. Still, right tasty and a highly sessionable brew for 8.5 abv."
"Drinkability: This ale is a winner. The candied flavors work well in warm or cold weather and the sweetness of the ale really hits the spot."
"This is my first post on a beer forum, and I'm not hip to all the Lingo, but I do enjoy Beer and trying new things and have been using this site to pick new beers to try, so hopefully I will eventually get better at my evaluations. Cheers Bigdaddy"
"11.2 fl oz bottle with a best before date of 6/08. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a beautiful fluffy white head, great longevity and equally great lace. Nice yeasty aromas, slightly orange citrus. Slight wheat malt and yeast flavors with fair amont of hop presence. Alcohol is well hidden. Slightly citric and peppery. A beautiful example of the style. A true classic and one for ll the others to be judged by."
"Clear, bubbly pilsener color with a nicely laced white head. Very lively mouthfeel. Alcohol is covered fairly well. Rather sweet, peppered, and candied flavor with a spicy hop finish. Smells of bubble gum and candy. Simple and deliciously drinkable. Wonderfully dry, almost brut champagne like.."
"Finally time to review one of my absolute favorite beers. Poured ever so slowly from a 11.2 ounce bottle into my Duvel tulip (is there really another way?). This is hands down the most beautiful looking beer I have ever seen. Straw colored with the most breathtaking stormcloud of white towering foam. If poured correctly you should have roughly half beer and half head in your glass. The head retention is pretty amazing and the lacing extensive. Really a site to behold. The smell is hay, pepper, and lemon zest. Taste is light, crisp at first. Taste of rich spices like coriander and pepper, a little lemon, and some nice buttery malts. Aftertaste is that wonderful spice flavor followed by a nice glowing warming sensation in your belly and body. This must be what it feels like to give your spirit a bath. Alcohol feeling is present and strong, but not so abundant in the taste. Still a quaffer and a sipper...take her real easy. Drinkability suffers slightly because of the high alcohol. Overall, one of my top ten favorite beers and one that never dissapoints."
"An exquisite beer to say the least."
"I have no idea why I havent reviewed this yet. Pale yellow color, with a hue white head (if poured into the right glassware). The smeel is grassy and yeasty. Malts are not a huge factore, but the yeasty esters (nearly hefe-like... spicy) and grassy hop flavors are quite complex. Mouthfeel has decent carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer to unwind with."
"This is a pleasant, well-balanced experience despite its classification as a ""big"" Belgian beer. It hides its 8.1% ABV (that's what the bottle said Â I know it differs from the info up top) well and goes down smooth. I personally favour a bit more carbonation than Duvel offers and marked its drinkability down only slightly because of what I perceive as a bit of a dry, astringent aftertaste."
"It's just a fantastic beer and one that I can't wait to try again."
"Kinda a rauchbier aroma, but less pronounced, though still unexpected. Some maltiness. Pale golden in color. The head rioted in my glass. After calling in the authorities it settled down somewhat, but continued to stand around leering at me. Malt profile with some tickling alcohol and pear notes. Mild spice, but much less than many Belgian Strong Ales. Much ado about nothing it seems."
"drinkability - i was all exited to try this one but i failed to finish my 11.2 oz bottle. for reasons listed above. tastes like something id drink out of a keg at a party."
"D - Excellent beer. I will be keeping this around from now on. This would be perfect for any occasion or sitting."
"Very versatile when paired with food...just enough alcohol content to relax with...not so much alcohol that you can't have 2 or 3 in a sitting. A classic."
"This beer is by far one of the best beers that I have ever drank. It has a great appearance and a taste that is quite good as well. This is a beer that I'll be buying again and again. It goes down incredibly easy espicially for having such a high abv. If you haven't tried this beer I highly recommend geting some of this next time you see it."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2 1/2"" bright white head above the clear golden brew. Head lasts and lasts, with rejuvenation from lots of deep bubbling, with lots of hunky foam lacing. Aroma is sugar and spice and everything, well, you know. Taste is spicy sweetness also, with bready undertones. Mouthfeel is light and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is very nice. Sweet could possibly get a tad cloying after awhile, but nonetheless, a classic."
"I had this Duvel at a restauant paired with Alaskan black cod marinaded in mushroom soy and garlic served with a ginger-coconut sauce and sweet pepper salsa. The flavors matched up prefectly and really made this beer one to remember. Excellent!"
"D - It is an excellent brew that is easy to drink. It could pair well with foods as well. Strong pales are not one of my favorite styles, but I do see why people love this beer."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip-style goblet. Golden straw color, very crisp and clean, with a tremendous white head of epic proportions. The nose is of tropical fruits and candy. A gorgeous smelling ale. Tastes of malty sweetness up front, with strong fruity flavors behind ... and finishes with a much drier, clean taste in the mouth. Ample carbonation and a unique crispness. For me, a standard in the Belgian variety ... very, very drinkable and always enjoyable. Duvel is a reliable and regal ale."
"I poured this beer into an oversized Duvel tulip glass. That's 12 oz of beer into a 22 oz container and the snow white frothy head came right to the top. ThereÂs a chaotic vortex of bubbles erupting from the bottom of my glass sustaining this mammoth head. As the head collapses, it leaves behind a meringue-like cratered head. Almost looks like some forgotten water-carved desert valley in AZ. As I drink this beer, the head collapses and leaves big awkward clumps of head hanging out on the surface. The color of the beer is soft honey. Truly one of the most visually entertaining beers I can ever imagine drinking. The smell consists of tangerines and plumbs, an enticing spicy yeast and what I can only describe as dark brown lake water. These smells are magnificently intertwined with each other that make this really unique. Tastes surprisingly bland compared to the smell, but far from bad. IÂm getting some very dry grapefruit rind, black pepper and fruity orange jello with a medicinal, dry yeast finish. If I allow some air to stand trapped in my mouth, I pick up strawberries. I must add that this is the most prominent spicy yeast flavor IÂve had with out it being too dry. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a lot of unobtrusive carbonation that disappears when I swallow. This beer is surprisingly simple, but wonderfully put together and an absolute delight to watch."
"Price: Reasonably priced the quality of beer. Buy yourself the four pack with the Duvel glass so you can drink this right. If you still not convinced accept the next one offered, you won't regret it."
"poured golden with a big soapy head. aroma yeast , citrus on the lemon side a hint of alcohol. flavor lemon, orange,light yeast and malts as it warmed got some sweetness.usually when the yeast and citrus are the 1st thing that hits my nose I get this feeling I am not going to like this beer but this one was good"
"I had this beer many years ago, and didn't care much for it at the time, but now I have to say that this is one hell of a beer. I'm glad I gave it another chance after nearly eight years."
"Could drink a few more. the appearance was the best part of this beer although the other components were impressive."
"I told a few friends about this..and a few weeks later they said they had almost exactly the same experience...although you may resist initially ; the Duvel gets your soul in the end."
"Pours yellow with a thick, massive white head. Nose is light, fruity and airy with juicy pears and apples along with some slight alcohol pepper. Taste is fruity as well, juicy apple cider...yeasty banana and definitely some alcohol heat making it's way onto the palate for the finish. Mouthfeel is high on carbonation, a little too high for me. Overall this is certainly a tasty beer although for my tastes it desn't quite back up the hype."
"definitely the standard to which other belgian pales should be judged. balanced taste, clean finish, very drinkable."
"This is tasty. I'll have another and recommend it to my friends. The flavor does come off just a little too tart to be a mainstay for me."
"pours wtih a billowy white head that is ""get in the way"" big. clear pale yellow appearance. leaves more lacing on the glass than there is on Shaquille Oneal's high top sneakers. aroma is grainy, alcohol, and apple sweet. taste is very sweet with a touch of bitter and a slight late bite in the back. mouthfeel is light and dry, amazingly so for such a strong brew."
"Too drinkable for an 8.5 ABV. This is a fine beer."
"d - Could drink one after another."
"Many beers in this category have a tendency to be syrupy and cloyingly sweet. While Duvel is a ""big beer"" it manages to be complex and delicate at the same time. It is very drinkable and satisfyingly refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is lively and bubbley, smooth, a bit chewy, and crisp. Clean feeling. Overall a very drinkable brew- not overwhelming, and certainly easy to drink considering it's alcohol content. But it just doesn't do it for me like I'd like it to. I'd take La Fin or Delirium Tremens over this any day."
"I have been waiting forever to try this! I shall not let stellar reviews affect my opinion. Really cool 11.2 ounce stubby brown bottle. Fancy label, printed on good paper. hiyooo. This poured a gorgous pale gold color that kinda looks like a wheat beer, nice and hazy. Cool linear specific carbonation and some trippy yeast spots floating within(hey I tried to be careful!). The head is amazingly rocky and white. Very airy. I tasted the head and got stung by pepperiness! The smell is nice and spicy, citrus is there. Alcohol smell not kicking my ass though. And not in the taste either. The alcohol kinda there but not too intense. Some good hop bitterness here. The mouthfeel is sharp and stingy. This is clean and drinkable. Wish i had a bigger bottle than this stubby stubby."
"Smells of alcohol, malt, yeast, apricots and spice. Tastes spicy and malty, like witbier, with apricot and a lingering mellow aftertaste of straw and apricots. Feels like a mimonsa in my mouth. Pleasantly viscous. I'll have another...for the rest of my life."
"Got this one at BJ's brewhouse in Tucson. Served from the bottle in a tulip glass, this thing had massive carbonation and foam. The bubbles in this thing were huge. Very golden in color and very clear. Smell was lightly fruity and quite spicy. Flavors were not overpowering and it tasted somewhat fruity with hints of sour apple and citrus fruits, with a bit of the spiciness detected earlier in the aroma. There is a well rounded bitter finish to balance it out nicely. Mouthfeel is greatly carbonated, crisp, and not overly thin. The higher alcohol content is artfully masked. A very refreshing beer, with a good kick to it and nice balanced flavors..."
"One area I highly commend this beer in is it head. Meringue like from the beginning to the end. I will not be Âre-visitingÂ this one."
"This stuff is really good. :P I don't know that I can have a lot of these at once, but it's damned tasty."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability, not a heavy ale. Very refreshing. I could possibly drink a few of these in one evening, depending on how the alcohol kicks in."
"Overall, a very good beer. Be careful to pour it slowly, or else you will foam over the glass!"
"Overall, an excellent beer and well worth the try."
"Inceidently, I think it's better from the small bottles, if you can get them. The larger corked bottles don't do anything for me, except that some of the carbonation and hence ""mouthfeel"" is lost."
"This is a great beer, and fit well for a new year's celebration. Very drinkable -- the 750 went down without trouble, and it was a delight to keep tasting as the bottle warmed up."
"Overall: A very good beer, which could use some time to mellow."
"Drinkability is totally exceptional. This ale has an astounding 8.5 abv - astounding because I don't taste it at all. I could, with dazzling ease, drink myself silly on Duvel."
"Pours a slightly cloudy medium yellow with a huge purest white head that is retained extremely well, leaving huge trails of lacing as it recedes into a mountain of thick foam. Smell is intense, the head bringing out the volatiles, with lots of breadiness and spices mixed with bright fruits and a touch of hops. Taste is mostly breads and peppery spices, the yeast really bringing out some musty character, with bright Saaz hop bitterness in the finish. Fruits are apparent throughout, apple and pear alongside a touch of bright citrus. Mouthfeel is excellent, stellar carbonation persists throughout, and it is very crisp and quite refreshing for a BSPA, while still being warming and full enough to enjoy on a cold night. Equally suitable for drinking right after mowing the lawn or while curling up in front of a fire with a good book. Can also be drunk at an incredible range of temperatures, equally good straight from the fridge or the cellar. Drinkability is great. A beer that I was less impressed with upon first sampling which I've really come to appreciate over time. Top notch."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is unfortunatly extreamly rare. I luckly found two bottles of this in a dark corner of a liquor store. I would definatly recommend you try this if you can find it, I would even recommend importing a case. It's worth it."
"Notes: This is a monster of a beer. The best appearance I've seen in a pale and great taste to boot. This is hella easy to drink at 8.5%."
"Appears cloudy and yellow/gold in color with off-white head that lingers for quite some time and leaves behind some nice lacing. Aromas of bananas, hops, pine, and dried fruit (apricot) come to mind. The taste is smooth and dry with a crisp, unmistakable fruity flavor that seems very tropical. The alcohol taste blends with the bitterness nicely to generate an evolving flavor spectrum from which this beer draws it's taste. Overall, this is an excellent beer and one of the finest examples of this style."
"I save ratings of ""5" for world-class standards. That Duvel captures so many depicts the true greatness of this brand."
"Pours a frothy golden color with a lively white head. Aroma is sweet with touches of banana and spices. Complex taste of sweetness followed by a nice alcohol burn. A good bitter finish to top it all off. This is the beer that started it all off for me. I love this brew."
"Just picked up a 4 pack with the glass for $12.99, what a deal!"
"Pale golden straw with a fluffy dimpled pure white head. A few bubbles are in no hurry but definitely dedicated to their task of joining that clouds of froth forming into pads where a tower of bubbles does itÂs part to maintain the cover for the duration of the drink. Smells really good, candy sweet and dry yeasty notes intermingle and caress my anxiously awaiting olfactory sensors. Taste is dryer, with just a bare hint of sweetness laced with dry champagne. The yeastiness noted in the nose is subdued, in part due to the carbonation coming alive and foaming on the tongue just as you begin being able to taste it. Hops finish up almost resinously bitter, but in balance with such a light malt profile. With a light body and that carbonation that sparks to a rolling boil in your mouth, the beer is pretty refreshing, and hides itÂs 8.5% to a degree. You wonÂt likely toss back Duvel like some ESBs, but youÂll have no trouble enjoying them."
"Drinkability -- I like this beer a lot and will most definitely seek it out again . . . I've got the special glass now. It's a little more on the pricey side, but that's pretty typical for a good Belgian. Very pleasant and enjoyable. Highly recommended."
" Awsome beer. going to buy the 4 pack next time."
"Not knowing what I was getting my self into I grabbed a 750ml bottle of this one of the local Fred Meyer's and figured it probably wouldn't be anything noteworthy, seeing it was from Freddies. But man oh man was I wrong. Duvel has got it going on!!! Beautiful golden color and a massive, thick, chunky head that clung to the glass and remained there until the glass went in the dishwasher. Smell was sweet and fruity with malts and hops. The flavor was very distinctive and full of fruity tones and hops and malts. I highly recommend this Belgian."
"A truly unique beer. Aroma is floral and fruity (pineapple, citrus). Pours a golden pale yellow color with a large sustainable head. Liquid gold. Its hard to classify the flavor of this beer as it is so unique. There is a sweetness of honey, apples, and cedar. This beer is quite hoppy, but balanced very well. Hops and malt are equally strong and each distinct -- they don't blend together on your tongue as well as a pale ale would. While this is lighter bodied ale, it is certainly not a weak beer. Alcohol is evident but not overwhelming. This beer gets very nice as it warms."
"Drinkability/Notes: This is a solid beer all around. The drinkability is high but watch it, this is a higher end alcohol beverage that will sneak up on you. A beer for people who don't like beer."
"Good carbonated mouthfeel, and a smooth sipper. Not bad at all."
"D: overall this is hellu'va fine beer. I once saw a Belgian guy quaffing this beer straight from the (330ml) bottle at lunch time when I visited Mechelen, Belgium. While I was sipping ""elegantly"" a small bottle of Het Anker's Goulden Carolus Classic in a goblet, he drank Duvel like a Bud/Stella Artois/Corona, and he consumed two bottles of them in 20 minutes!!--now I could imagine why, but still disagree with the way the beer was ""wasted"". He liked it anyhow... and so do I in my own way."
"D: Should be approachable/enjoyable by all. Not a session brew though."
"Notes: An old favorite. both sentimentally and tastewise. Glad I finally picked up a bottle for review. I forgot just how good and unique this beer is and I now remember why my avatar and desktop both feature Duvel pics. A truly great Belgian strong pale ale and A great change of pace for me from all the hop bombs and stouts I've been into lately. I love this beer. One thing I will say though is that I've never drank this beer without proper glassware and I don't know if it would be quite the same without it."
"A well crafted beer that makes me happy. It pours with a bauta-head, and with rings of lacing like sediments marking every gulp. The color is light yellow and it smells of yeast and citrus. The yeast is coming to the fore in the taste as well, complimented with citrus and spices. It ends with a dry, bitter bite. The mouthfeel is very fizzy, a little too much for my taste. Unlike many other beers I tasted this one tasted better in the first sips."
"there is so much going on in the nose i don't know where to start, it's almost like perfume. complex, sweet but also a strong alcohol smell, buttery toast in the background with a nice floral fruity bouquet up front. every sip gives new insight into the world of better beer. my first taste and first review, but i will re-visit this brew soon. this is definitely one for reflection. jesum crow, what an incredible beer!"
"The body is med to high. Very easy to drink with low phenol flavors. Overall a good example of a Belgium is pretty widely distributed."
"This beer is one of the best IÂve tried. ItÂs a real trip and every sip packs a seductive punch. I will have a six pack of these in my cellar always."
"Spicy and fruity with pear flavors and white pepper. Very clean and light with a creamy quality on the palate. Distinctive Belgian yeast taste. This is such a great beer with complex flavors that make this an interesting beer."
"This beer is visually fascinating and has a spectacularly complicated nose and flavor, but I'm just not sure if I LIKE it! Maybe I'm just not ready, or maybe I'm not in the proper mood. This beer will have to be revisited for further conclusions to be drawn."
"This is an eminently drinkable beer, especially to perk-up the taste buds before the evening meal. The 8.5% alcohol is well hidden in this smooth, very drinkable ale."
"Great though I don't know if it's worth the difference in price that it often manifests. This was the first beer that I tried in North Carolina that was greater than 6.5% alcohol as that we just passed out ""Pop the Cap"" bill allowing for a rush of new, often wonderful, beers"
"D- This beer is truly light and it does have some nice complexity in flavor. The buttery corn notes as it warmed seem to interfere with the other flavors but not a great deal. The head is simply incredible and the lace just last and last. This is one fizzy yellow beer that is wonderful."
"Drinkability: superb drinkability as this is one of the more refreshing Belgian beers on the market. This was one of the first Belgian beers I had many years ago, and I still enjoy it to this day."
"Drinkability: I find this to be more of a sipper than a slugger, due in fact to the strength of the brew and the delicate nature overall. More of a ""treat"" beer for me."
"Pours a golden yellow/light amber, clear, with ample snow-white creamy head fed by a steady stream of bubbles from my chalice. Nose is musty/yeasty up front, with citrus, apricot, pineapple, and a slight hint of alarming vinegar in the end. Taste starts off similarly with tropical fruits, yeast, some grainy/grassy notes, and again, the slightest bit of puckering vinegar. Mouthfeel is typical Belgian pale - light, dry and bubbly. This was a tasty BSPA, but I've certainly had better. That vingar sourness just through me off a little. I tend to like my BSPAs a little sweeter. Still a good example of the style though."
"I wanted a while on this one. It is one of those trappist that is always there, but you seemingly passed it over for another beer. Needless, I will not pass this one over."
"Highly drinkable, alcohol not noticeable at all."
"Drinkability is excellent. Indeed, I find myself agreeing with another quip found on the side of the bottle: ""Enjoy with discerning friends or good looking strangers."""
"I can't really add anything new to the description of this famous beer that hasn't already been said. My take on it is that the appearance is awesome, mostly due to the clumpy sticky head which never dissipates. The taste is good, but not strong. I think I prefer more robust flavor than this offers. But the drinkability is high because nothing slows you down (goes down easy)."
"The duvel is definitely in the details. Upon close examination, one can see a steady stream of tiny bubble spirits rising from the underworld of the glass. The smell is of fire-roasted banana, with a pinch of satan-chewed bubble gum. The taste is very smooth, and the flavors come together as it warms in the demonic inferno. Enjoy it on judgement day, but be sure to pour and drink slowly so not to open up the firey gates of hell!"
"Overall, a great beer, and dangerously drinkable for the ABV. I will definitely be picking up more the next time I'm at a decent LCBO!"
"It was good to see that the establishment that offered this Belgian used the Duvel snifter-style tulip glass. The head was among the most impressive I have seen and smelled on a Belgian; large, white, and with hints of sweet fruits, citrus, bananas, yeasts and candy sugar. The taste was excellent, creamy and yeasty finishing dry and smooth. There was continuous carbonation, but enough to completely distract from the flavor. One of my favorite Belgians and a must-try for any beer drinker."
"Drinkability: Very moreish, its hard not to have quite a few, but the ABV tends to avoid that somewhat."
"CanÂt wait to compare with LF du Monde."
"A great beer."
"The drinkability of this beer is excellentÂdangerously so at 8.5% abv."
"Overall a good, solid Belgian."
"World class, but everyone already knew that."
"This is a good beer but not exactly to my taste. The alcohol is a bit higher than I generally prefer to taste, although it's still a quality bevo. I'll have to give it another shot a different time but right now I would rank it among my least favorite Belgians."
"I will try this one again gladly."
"This beer pours a golden yellow. It is slightly cloudy. The head is thick and white. It fades slowly leaving lots of laces. The aroma is a little hard to explain. This beer as a spicy aroma. I detect pepper, cloves, and a slightly malty sweet aroma. I detect very little in the way of hops. This beer has a strong spicy flavor. It has a sweet malty taste also. It is slightly hoppy. The 8.5% alcohol is hidden very well in the flavor. This beer is crisp and smooth. It might be just a little overcarbonated, but not so much that it detracts form the flavor. This beer leaves a spicy aftertaste. I think that this beer might make a decent session beer, but with an ABV of 8.5%, you might have a little trouble drinking it all night. Ultimately, I think this beer was great. Try it if you see it."
"Overall, you must try this beer no matter what your preference. It truly is an excellent beer."
"This beer goes down quite easy for such a high ABV, so beware."
"Had this beer awhile ago, and wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, given the hype. Decided to give it another go and get pretty much the same results. It is one of the most visually pleasing beer I've ever had, I'll give it that. Big mountainous head, milky white, piling out of the top of my glass. Smell and taste are sugary sweet, with traces or Belgian spices and spicy herbal hops. Taste is nice, but there's a strong alcohol kick to it that doesn't seem to belong in this beer, and I have no beef in general with a little alcohol kick. And maybe a little overly sweet. Basically I'm pretty underwhelmed with this beer. Maybe if I'd had lower expectations I would've liked it more, but it still seems like an average Belgian ale to me."
"This beer must be served in its appropriate glass. Tilt glass and pour slowly. A thick head will form and stick to the glass as the beer is slowly consumed. Duvel has a light golden color with a spicy scent. This beer goes down smooth and the spiciness almost tickles the throat. Duvel is an enjoyable beer. Its light and somewhat hoppy character mask the bold 8.5% abv. A trip to Moortgat brewery is impressive and educational. Only 20% of the brewery's production is exported. The rest stays in Belgium."
"Deceptively strong, not a big quaffer, but I'd like to give it a burl."
"Bottle poured into a recently purchased Duvel glass. The appearance is a dull golden with a never-ending cascade of tiny bubbles heading towards a gigantic white frothy head. The head will lessen but stick around and lace the glass with white frothy bubbles. The smell is light and spicy with a hint of alcohol. The taste is nice smooth, crisp and carbonated. You hardly notice the alcohol, but it warms the body. Head still existent throughout. A drinkable beer indeed."
"I thought I'd like this beer, but I am really enjoying it, it really suprises me how good this is. I only wish it was a bit cheaper so I could have this on a more regular basis."
"the color on this sample is a pale golden yellow and cloudy. very light light,crisp, fruity taste. a great beer to sip in the summer shade. i thought the smell was more pronounced than the taste. it has alot of champagne character. you just cannot taste the alchohol in this one. it is one of the most drinkable beers that i have ever had. one is not enough!"
"Drinkability is ok. Definite alcohol presence which makes me want to sip this more than anything else."
"Overall: This beer is perfection in a bottle; one of, if not the best that I have ever tasted. If you've never tried it, do so immediately."
"The taste is bright and crisp with barley and cider flavors, tart with yeast remnants and just a final bit of dry breadiness. There's no excess of sugar in the body which makes it a warming, filling beer without the young sweet affects. Really quite excellent."
"This beer tasted and drank so well. Crisp. Clean. Flavorful and direct but eluding with a medium body. The 8.5% alcohol was not evident or overpowering in the taste. The beer got better as it warmed... I wish I had bought a few more of these. It's insanely drinkable. A simply great beer. I will be coming back to this one."
"I like the smell really well but when tasting, throws me the other way. I can really taste the increase in alcohol in it."
"[lazily updated 19 September 2006]"
"Marvelous."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow, huge head, some carbonation. It has a malty, hoppy, sweet scent. Very nice sweet taste with a medium body, there's a little hint of alcohol at the end. This is very drinkable, and also a great beer. This is my first time drinking a Duvel and it won't be my last."
"I think this is a great beer and highly recommend it."
"This is a great beer that complements all sorts of cheeses in a fantastic way. Great stuff."
"if it wasn't for the ABV, I could drink this all day long. a very exceptional beer in one of my favorite styles. Cheers!"
"Pours a bubbly crystal clear straw yellow, with a huge rocky, frothy white head...the definition of what a belgian strong pale ale should look like. Aroma has citrusy and spicy hop notes with a fruity ale yeast and biscuit like malt background...certainly appealing. Flavor begins with a crisp hops profile of citrus, spices, and minerals followed by a distinct malt profile of biscuit and dry toasted bread flavors, then a background of fruity ale yeast. Intriguing and original, really a combination of a pilsner and a blegian pale. Very good brew, glad it was one of the first high gravity beers available in NC."
"This was a 2 yr old black label 750... Poured a hazy, large, egg shell colored head that left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet aroma of citrus, and spices (mostly cardamom). Sweet, slight citrus hoppiness, mildly spicy, and finishing alcoholic as well."
"Pale cloudy color with a massive, creamy, rocky head that never goes away! Plenty of carbonation bubbles. Smells clean with an alcoholic sweetness backed up with yeast. The taste is crisp and fruity. Kind of grape like. Sweet alcohol and pale malts too! Oh my God! You just can't drink one! The problem is with 8.5% alv you have to be careful."
"This is incredible stuff. Truly worth all the hype surrounding it. Cheers."
"750ml bottle. Pours a pale yellow color and makes a HUGE fluffy and clumpy white head. Aroma is very yeasty with some citrus fruit lingering around. Flavor is quite complex with notes of lemon zest, coriander, nutmeg, fresh baked bread, yeast, alcohol and caramel bananas. Light to medium on the palate, carbonation is firm, strong dry finish. This is a very quaffable brew, the strength creeps up on you. I enjoyed several of these while in Brussels last week, it was nice to see something so good and readily available everywhere."
"Overall - probably the best strong pale ale there is.. an exceptional beer..."
"Yes, I will buy again!"
"This is an all around exceptional example of the style, and surely one of the best. I'd recommend, if you haven't had many, trying some from some other breweries, then trying Duvel to see what you think. Either way, it's a great beer, and one worthy of celebration."
"Opinion: Of course you know that I am of the opinion that this is an incredible beer! It is light, and very well balanced. The mix of subtle flavors masks the bite that this beer packs. After finishing this 750mL bottle myself, I am feeling a bit warmer. I highly recommend this beer!"
"A truely remarkable beer!"
"poured a clear golden color with a head that just would not stop rising, white and puffy. Smell is malty and candy-like with all the pleasures of a Belgian Ale. Taste is malty and sweet with spicy notes. The alcohol aroma is there, but not as strong as you would thing. It carresses the tongue as only this style of beer can. A great drinker. Easy to forget the amount of alcohol present."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow, huge white head fills up to the rim of my big Duvel tulip. Lace all around the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, spicy and grassy hops. Taste is very malty, slightly sweet, spices in the middle and a nice clean bitter finish. Very smooth mouth, the alcohol is perfectly hidden, very refreshing, excellent and timeless beer."
"Secondly: I was at a homebrewing store and talking to a frequent Belgian traveler who said Belgians, and Duvel don't travel well; it was a much better beer in Belgium. I can't imagine that, it is so good here."
"Light and refreshing with a lot of substance. A classic that deserves the credit it gets."
"Very tempting brew. Wonderful cap to this warm, sunny day as night and mercury fall. Try some."
"You could easily pair this number with a variety of foods. A nice veal francese wouldn't hurt. But mostly, behold this fine selection and savor each and every naughty moment."
"The mouthfeel is quite light and refreshingly swillable (though this is quite far from swill). The finish manages to stay quite moist with a small otherwise un-noticeable alcohol burn coating the mouth. Despite the high proof, this is beer is damn drinkable. I drank mine in several gulps, though I'm sure it will catch up with me shortly."
"Den"
"This beer is classic in every sense of the word. Created the style and still the standard bearer. There is nothing like a bottle of Duvel. Its reputation is completely deserved."
"Footnote: I measured the Duvel glass tulip afterwards and the volume is 600ml (20 fl. ozs). Even with my bottle being 330ml, the massive foam head easily fills the space. I don't know how the glass was designed, but it is a perfect accessory to the beer."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipping beer, drink this one slowly."
"The beer is basically ideal!"
"From the 750ml bottle. Even better than the 4 packs. What can I say? This is the ultimate of beers. Poured out to an amazing clear and beautiful golden color with a white cloud like foamy head. Dream like aroma of sweet spice and crisp herbs. The taste is heavenly, with the carbonation demanding attention from your tastebuds to savor every drop of this brew. Flavors of citrus, sweetness and bitterness were most noted, but this beer is almost beyond words. Finished crisp and clean, like it was daring me to not take the glass from my lips. The ulitimate beer in my opinion. Well worth the price tag of the big bottle. Highly recommended. This is the end all be all of world class beers in my opinion. The only brew that has every earned all 5's in my reviews. This is beer from Heaven. Grace be to GOD, this brew is the ultimate."
"I've reviewed nearly 300 beers, but somehow I'd not gotten Duvel, despite it being a favorite I drink 2 or 3 times a month. One of my favorite beers of all time, light, easy to drink, but with a substantial punch. A classic and a style unto itself, without equal."
"Drinkability is the same as taste and mouthfeel marked down for the fizz."
"Liberated from its corked 750 mL bottle that I am sharing with an uber-discerning good friend (as per the instructions on the bottle), a gargantuan head immediately crops up and threatens to get out of control. Rocky pure white head plumes above the glass and taunts me. As I sip, sticky pactches of foamy lace are left behind. Floral aroma greets my eager nostrils and fills them fresh cut apples, herbs, bitter lemons, some grass, and a little brash alcohol. Taste begins deceptively mellow - one sly devil of a brew. Smooth bready malts take the lead before being outshined by strong spices and some herbs. Yeast is noticeable and transitions into clovey bananas before giving up to warming alcohol. Finish is bitter lemons with some alcohol and a slightly drying acidity. Crisp, clean mouthfeel compliments the complex flavor."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer all around. It's nice that such a great beer is so readily available, too. Nothing short of excellent."
"This beer is a bright gold color with a big, thick, white head. There is a lot of carbonation bubbling up. It smells citrusy and spicey. And a little yeasty too. It has a very clean crisp fruity flavor with a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, there is a lot of carbonation. The fact that it is 8.5% is not obvious when tasting it. I'm sure it becomes obvious after a second or third glass."
"One of the classics."
"After the rave reviews I was expecting a lot from this beer. For a pale ale, I suppose it was decently complex, but I guess I was just expecting more. It is quite refreshing and would be great on a hot day."
"Duvel remains one of my favorite beers. The beer's character and seamless integration of flavors makes it the defining example of the style, IMO."
"Quite drinkable, I will buy many more."
"Her taste is very fruity, flavours of apple, banana and fruits were present, clear fresh hops and some roasted malt were shy but there. A very smooth beer than doesnt show his alcohol content. Well drinkable, nice and enjoyable."
"Duvel, as most everyone on this site knows is one of the best Belgian Ales around. At 8.5% alc. it can really pack a punch, but try serving it instead of wine (it does come in a 750ml bottle) at your next dinner party and you may just be surprised at the reaction you get. It has a wonderful smell that reminds me of a field in the summertime, a rich golden color and a creamy, thick head."
"Light mouthfeel. This would make a lovely apertif at the end of a good meal. Belgians - they are masters!"
"Taste: Crisp malt taste with lots of alcohol and a little bit of an apple and other fruit flavors in there. There's some pepper and spice that comes through with the big alcohol, but overall it's a pretty easier drinker for its heft. There's a real nice zing of carbonation in the mouhtfeel, and it ends crisp, sweet, and delicious."
" Highly refreshing. A great summer beer , but the ABV 's probably a little high for pounding."
"Was a little over carbonated, but not too much. Very good beer over all. Definitely one to drink cold on a hot summers day."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Best berfore 10 2007 on bottle. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA. Served at home in a Duvel glass...how appropriate. The first time I had this beer I dubbed it ""headache in a bottle"". With the phenolics and alcohol that name probably is appropriate, but it is, after all, a well crafted ale."
"Most impressive lacing I've ever seen in a beer. Besides that, it's extremely light colored and clear, which makes me want to chug it, if I wouldn't gag on the foam. Smell is medicinal with lots of yeasty goodness. Taste is very spicy, dry, and alcoholic, with more of that great yeast flavor - the yeast really stands out in this beer. Mouthfeel stands out as very smooth and silky. This is one I will pick up more often!"
"330 mL brown stubby bottle with best before date stamped on the rear label."
"well well well. i thought i perhaps built this beer up too much in my mind. but now i just think the bottle is too damn small!!"
"The taste is super light and crisp. Not an extremely bold flavor, but it tastes great. Spices and pilsner malts with an ever so modest hop character to round out the whole affair. This is like a heavyweight ABV light beer. Very strange and wonderful. You could guzzle these down and be caught totally unaware by the alcohol which remains completely undetectable in taste or smell. Very excellent choice for warmer weather, when a refreshing and high powered beverage is called for. This sucker is a very good beer. It deserves the adoration that so many seem to have for it. Surprising and impressive."
"A pleasure each time I have it. Truly a great beer."
"Golden straw body, very clear, lots of bubbles. Poured into a Duvel glass with an brilliant white huge head which never goes away. Aroma is sweet, a little fruity, and very spicy. This tastes great, very sweet and citrusy upfront with a slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, thicker than expected from appearances. After a few sips and as it warms spices start to come through. This is an immensely drinkable beer, which is a dangerous combination with its alchohol content."
"One of the great beers!"
"Bottle. Looks fantastic, pale yellow (almost like champagne) with a reasonable creamy head that retains well and plenty of lacing. Aroma is subtle - sweet, spicy with hints of honey. Taste is very well balanced starting sweet and finishing slightly bitter. Alcohol is well hidden and hardly noticable. Could drink a lot more of these if only I could afford to the ridiculous prices you need to pay over here."
"Drinkability: Here's a good way to get loaded fast with quality beer."
"Good beer, I'd say. Nothing to go nuts over, though."
"Despite the high abv, this is a damn drinkable beer that goes well with a lot of different foods."
"A soft, silky mouthfeel and everpresent fizz make for an absurdly drinkable brew, despite the 8.5%."
"Came in a 33cl short stubby brown bottle with freshness date 09/2007. At first it looks harmless but its alcohol content (8.5%) makes you have to respect it aswell as watch how much you consume of it. Quite an exceptional beer overall and very easy to drink I found. Very well rounded beautiful golden colored body and its rich complexity makes this a top notch beer that I would recommend to all!"
"Easy to drink and accessable but not ""World Class"" in my mind. Either I have more to learn or others are too easily impressed."
"Drinkability: This is one you could drink all night, but at 8.5% you'd best be careful of the beer goggles that the Devil will subvert your vision with, you'll probably wake up next to another type of 'devil'!"
"The beer poured into the glass a brilliant clear gold with a thick, dense white head, Te head retained well, and when it did recede it left a chunky lace on the side of the glass. A stream of champagne bubbles rise from the bottom, a testament to the carbonation of the bottle conditioned beer. I detect characters form the yeast in the nose. A doughy hint followed by apples, pears. There is a hint of citrus and just a touch of spice (pepper). The flavor has more of the spiciness up front followed quickly by more of the apple/pear character and topped by grapefruit and orange. Bright slightly slick mouth feel and surprisingly drinkable despite the high alcohol content."
"Overall impressions: This is a thing of beauty in all aspects. Next time you see it pick up the four pack with the tulip glass - it makes for an amazing presentation. This beer is incredibly drinkable, yet complex at the same time. One of my favorite beers to date."
"Drinkability: all day. A bit potent, but very drinkable."
" At last finishing an unending banter with another employee the waitress/barmaid returned taking the bottle and glass and asked for ""five dollars"" without a please or thankyou."
"Also: I use my Duvel tulip religiously for a variety of beers. I got this 750ml on sale for $5.99 and it was a joy to employ the tulip for its intended brew!"
"Still don't have that tulip, but I decided to re-review this one. I'm glad I did. My palate has apparently grown up since I first reviewed Duvel, and I now consider it to be one of the best beers in the world. I still wish I had a tulip, but I don't think it matters, and it certainly didn't affect the taste of the beer, nor the drinkability. The aftertaste is a bit too dry for my liking, and the smell is a touch weak, but other than that, this is one good brew."
"When I poured this I thought I did a terrible job, and maybe I did, but the picture on the bottle shows a lot of head there as well, so I guess that's normal. As for the beer itself, it was about as smooth as anything 8% that I've had. Tastes a lot like Maredsous, another one I liked. The beer just kind of floated its way down into my stomach. I finished it without even noticing my progress, I think that says something about a beer. Oh yeah and I wasn't drunk either, so it must have been the Duvel."
"I was expecting great things with this beer, but I didn't quite receive them. It is just a very good easy drinking beer, but not outstanding. Very well ballanced I might add too. I enjoyed it, but for the price, I wouldn't buy it again. Watch the alcohol content, it will sneek up on you."
"I feel as comfortable sipping this beer by day as I do by night. The most beautiful foamy head I've ever seen, and it lasts forever in the Duvel glass, sitting atop a gold so intense it almost glows. Fragrant fruity spiciness, sweet yet crisp and clean."
"Notes II: holy bejesus! The devil is kickin my ass here!"
"The appearance is cloudy, with an obviously thick head. This is not a beer you need to pour aggressively to get an acceptable head. The smell is great with a slight hint of hops. I'm not sure what it is about this beer that is different- be it the bohemian hops or the belgian yeast? Either way, the flavor is great. Excellent balance of hops and malt. Incredible fruit flavor. Very good beer. This is the classic example of a Belgian strong pale ale."
"Have to use a tulip glass to get the full effect of the pour. Slightly hazy pale yellow-gold color, with massive amount of carbonation, bubbles just kept coming, full chunky white head, nice lace trail. No strong smells, light citrus, some coriander, typical lager smells. Flavour is also quite light, more tangy citrus and some spice, touch of weiss yeast finish. Nice finish of balancing hops. Smooth finish, its not until the beer hits your stomach that you feel the warmth from the high alcohol content. Perfect for a cold day."
"Mouthfeel: light body, dry, a little astringent, and sour. I don't remember this beer being this tart, maybe it was a bad bottle."
"This is a beer you really want your sences at their peek for. A fantastic Belgian in every way."
"Drinkability: Not a bad session brew if you can tolerate the 8.5 ABV."
"At first I thought this beer was all hype. I couldn't have been more wrong. Wow, what a great beer. I am beginning to love Belgian Strong Pale Ales. It pours a cloudy lemon yellow color and has a thick white head that leaves a ton of lace in my glass. It has a fruity, yeasty aroma and a very yeasty fruity flavor. Very well balanced and definitely world. If only it was a bit cheaper. I could go broke drinking this bier."
"Now, given the 8.5% abv, this should have some alcohol kick. I tasted none of it. I felt it around the 11th ounce. This beer is scarily easy to drink. I will not consume this if I have to drive because I don't think I could limit myself to one or two."
"What a mouthfeel! Lively and smooth, exactly how it should be. Tastes good, not too many specifics that I can pinpoint, but generally floral, mild orange, hops, and some light esthers. Damn I love this glass. Just beautiful all the way through; amazing lacing and the head is determined."
"This is a beautiful looking brew with a unique taste that is surprisingly easy to drink. I didn't know what to think of it at first, but the taste grew on me (I would say it improved as the beer grew warmer). A classic."
"Also, as a 'side- tip,' make sure that you get some of the yeast from the bottle in your glass. It really does enhance the flavor wonderfully in this one."
"I really feel bad saying this, but this beer kinda sucked. The flavor of it was pretty disgusting... tasted almost like a bad witbier. Something about this just turned me off completely. I'm highly dissapointed, given that this is such a ""classic"" beer. Well... cheers, anways."
"Delicious Belgian pale, quickly becoming a preferred style."
"The drinkability is great for this type of beer some of the sweetness will limit this from being any type of session beer."
"-Oelergud"
"I have awoken late at night, from a terrible nightmare, in the past. I dreamt that Duvel could no longer be imported to the US. WOW, what an awful dream, just plain awful. This beer is almost indescribable. It seduces you with fruity and spicy aromas and flavors, yet every drink begs another, until the 4 pack that you bought is gone. And, of course you're incapacitated on the floor from the 8.5 ABV. Think of a heavy bodied beer, how it tastes/feels, then somehow make it as easy to drink as iced tea. Amazing, but be careful, your wallet and your liver do pay the price!"
"Drank this after sharing some Kwak at a Christmas party, what a difference! Pours a hazy straw color with a big puff of pure white head. Enticing aromas of fresh bread, yeasty must, cloves, banana, and cotton candy. Oohh baby, this is good! Doughy malts, yeast, clove and pepper, banana, yellow raisens, and rock candy. Sweet without tasting sugary. Quite complex and warming, alcohol not obvious. Light to medium bodied with a tight, bubbly mouthfeel. Very well done, it makes the Kwak look like an amature offering. More please!"
"The Devil,huh ? Well come on in.This belgian poured a bright clear gold with a wonderfully foamy head that left heavy lacing all the way down,The champagne -like carbonation was a definite plus.This looked just beautiful sitting there in my goblet.Both aroma and flavor were subtley citrucy and spicy with slight hints of clove and banana.Overall, full bodied and extremely smooth.This one is definitely a keeper."
"Despite the high alcohol content, I should have no problem finishing off this bottle."
"Drinkability- If I let this one sit for an hour before drinking it would have been better. The carbonation is about the only drawback in this beer for me. Otherwise it would be one of my top 10 probably. Very tasty."
"I must recommend that you have the proper glassware for this one, otherwise you are in for a difficult pour. Pours a clear golden into the Duvel glass with half the glass being a fluffy, pillowy, meringue-like head that gets thicker with time and laces like nobody's business. Smells slightly sour and clovey. Taste was a spicey light malt with a long dry finish, very complex, sometimes varying with the bottle. Mouthfeel was rather smooth and dry. The high ABV is very well hidden. This is a very good and easy to find beer, and quite an experience visually. I must find a Duvel glass for home use."
"Sin in a glass. Anything this good must be sinful and will send you straight to hell. And I don't care. Sending me to hell is worth it for this magnificent brew. Poured into a large sniffter, this beer appears to be clear. It's a golden honey, clear colour. But no, that's an optical illusion. It appears clear, but it's actually quite cloudy. I couldn't see through the glass like I thought I could. Large, puffy, five finger head that ever so slowly settles down to three. Lace abounds the glass like etched artwork. I wonder, how can this look any better? Simply put, it can't. Such a delicate aroma. Spices, peppers, sweet and pale malts, juicy apples, ripe pears, and an almost juicy hop bitterness. Tastes just as good as it smells. Starts out with a bready maltiness, mingled with a pepper and spice taste that tingles the tongue. Middle is very fruity. Dry apples, pears, and just a touch of sourness. Citrus maybe? Leaves with a spicy bitterness, with still a bit of sweet and juicy fruit. Damn, what a mouthfeel. Smooth, thick and creamy. Excellent drinkability. Can be savoured and quaffed. An excellent thirst quencher as well. A beer worthy of respect. If ever I find an LCBO that stocks this, I'll pick up every damned bottle they have."
"Poured out a light golden color,,man is this stuff carbonated.Major head and i poured it slowly,,unbelievable amount of carbonation coming up the glass.Smell is sweet,,nothing outstanding.Taste is remarkably light but pleasant considering its alcohol content.Nice mouthfeel.Overall a nice beer,ill have to get a true tulip and re-review.Major lacing thruout the glass still present as i finish the beer."
"330 ml bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a huge foamy white head that just fits into my Duvel glass. Clumps of lace left on the side of the glass. Constant flow of bubbles from the D etched into the bottom. Malty aroma with lemon and grass. Big, sweet malty flavor. Finishes crisp and hoppy. High level of carbonation. The 8.5% alcohol is well hidden. One of the first good beers I tried, and one I still often come back to."
"One of the pioneers of classic beers of belgium is Duvel and for me one of the best too! What a wonderfull and everlasting foam, great colour and that together with a wonderfull nose make this beer great without even tasting it. Nose is most hops& malt and hardly any yeastsmell. Nice and clean taste wich is mostly malt with a nice dry aftertaste of fine hops. One that I go for and I would recomend to relax and just enjoy the great taste that beer can have"
" Beautiful, near-perfect aroma of muscadine grapes, pears, Belgian yeast, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is a little understated. Like a typical Belgian blonde, the palate is dominated by yeast, a touch of light malt, and a fleeting sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little foamy. Still, very drinkable. A wonderful Belgian ale."
"This brew poured a huge head that is a cloudy golden color. The head is left behind quite distinctly on my glass. Smell is of sweet malts. Taste is heaven on earth! A seamless blend of malts, hops, and an unnoticeable high ABV creates one spectacular beer! It is very lively on the palate and very fulfilling for a golden ale. Despite the high ABV one can sip this thing of perfection all night long! Talk about your value beers, this is one of the most complete beers I have had for an outstanding price!"
" An amazing brew. My first all 5s. I have had this over the years and it ranged from ""eh"" to wow!!! This is a great beer all around. I wish I could find it more often. Truely a classic."
"If not for the 8.5% abv, this would be awesome for extended sessions."
"Great, Great Beer!!!!"
"Mouthfeel was very creamy and pleasant which lends to a very good drinkability on this yummy belgian."
"This is the quintessential Belgian Beer. Yes, it's way too commercial and too popular, but, really, there's a reason for that. It embodies all the characteristics of Yum City. The pour into its own tulip is a golden body with a thick pillowy head even with a slow, unhurried pour. I love making it froth and almost escape from the glass. Huge, thick feathery down lacing along the glass. Scent is sugar and spice and everything nice. Well, just spice and sweetness wafting forth. Taste is a bomb of spiciness and bitternessa dn finishing off slightly bitter with a warm sweetness and ending with the hops. I have to mark down mouthfeel only because the bubbles are occasionally intrusive. They fill the mouth and you really have to fight them to taste the beer and then it's over and you have the nicest hops and spice coating your tongue... I really could drink this all night. Bring a couple of four packs or a few 750's and you've got the perfect night."
"Still not amazing, but much, much better than drinking it out of a normal chalice."
"Mouthfeel- the carbonation stings the front of your tongue right away, and the body is more medium than it looked. This even left a pretty pleasant aftertaste. I had 2 bottles due to how drinkable it was!"
"The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. The finish has an alcohol kick and then a prolonged, intriguing green apple tartness mingled with hoppy bitterness and Belgian yeast. This beer is close to perfect, everyone should try it."
"Pours a pale, cloudy yellow with a very substantial white head which slowly subsides into lots of clingy lacing. Aromatic and appetizing, with plenty of hop flower smell backed by alcoholic spice and yeasty notes. Mellow, subtle, and rounded flavors. The floral and hop bitterness are intertwined and constantly vying for your attention. Very well balanced with neither flavor over-powering the other. A great dry finish which leaves you wanting more. Lovely creamy, yet carbonated body. Very light and easy to drink despite the 8.5% ABV."
"Drinkability: Insanely drinkable for such a big beer. Light, crisp, but also quite complex and flavorful. Really hard to beat."
"Notes: This is a quite enjoyable brew that I could drink every night. I love the hops. The bitterness is just wonderful."
"Extra note: Strikes me as being very versatile in combination with a wide variety of food."
"Black bottle version, aged for atleast 1 year. Humungus, cumulonimbus powder white head over a bubbly, golden straw body. WOW! Smells of tangy, fruity malt, sour apples, light barnyard funkiness. Yeast. Hoppy oil scent as well. Taste and Mouthfeel: tangy, acidic, champagne-like--dry, bubbly. Sweet/sour apples, alcohol, yeast, some farm residue, banana. Delicious! Ample bitterness. Finish is bitter with lingering alcohol and sweetness. A classic that I look forward to having many more times."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Watch out - this beer is contagious. One will not cut it. Buy 4 or 8."
"A crisp refreshing brew. The alcohol kind of sneaks up on you, the 8.5 isnÂt real noticed until you about finish the bottle."
"drinkability: Awesome stuff! This must be what set the standard for this genre, it's got it all, not a good session brew, but perfect for a special occasion, I could drink a bottle of this every week! Highly recommended!"
"The mouthfeel is good, but there is a bit too much carbonation for me here. Seems a little too fizzy going down. Otherwise it is very smooth. Drinkability is good as well and I could see myself having a few of these."
"A VERY drinkable beer. One of the many things that draw me to this beer is that the novice and the expert can with some patience enjoy it. Few beers offer such calm complexity."
"The aroma is distinct, an alcohol tinged banana coconut smell. Hard to pinpoint, though. The taste is faintly alcoholic and yeasty. It leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. This is a distinct and unique beer that has few equals."
"Trying this beer again after about 5 years, back then me and a friend drank it out of a bottle and complained. This time around I poured into the closest glassware I could find to the one pictured and it came out a nice ""hazy lager"" colour with a pure white head that refused to go away. This time around I can certainly appreciate the taste a lot more, it is definitely a ""yeasty"" beer which can scare a lot of people off. The taste is probably the best i've had in this range of alcohol strength, how the hell do those belgians manage to hide that alcohol taste? it continues to amaze me."
"Some people seem to think that the taste is too powerful and the 8,5% should say: ""dont drink more than one!"" but i totally disagree. I can sit and sip at these little suckers all evening and all night long. The perfect belgian ale and it beats any other beer in this family."
"Nice meringue-like head floating on top of clear yellow beer. Very clear, no yeast. Tastes great, your standard belgian - nothing special but nothing lacking. Nice and creamy, yet not too filling. Very nice. This is a great session beer if you can afford it. I'd like to find it on tap somewhere."
"This came in a corked 750ml bottle. After finally wrestling the cork out of the bottle I poured this into a snifter where a huge fluffy white head formed that peaked over the glass. The body was a hazy yellow color. The head gradually collapses into a rocky cavernous landscape with chunks of lace strewn about the glass. The second fill of the glass the body was much murkier. The aroma had hints of apple with a spice and yeast notes present as well. The spice was the main contributor to the smell as this warmed to room temp. A bit of malt sweetness is the first thing you taste before the spice comes in and sticks around though the finish. This has a very clean and crisp taste that has a strong bready and yeasty presence. Mouthfeel on this is medium to full with a very filling quality about it even when you take a small sip. Drinkability is perfect, I could drink this all day or until I hit the floor as the 8.5% does not show at all. Great beer that everyone should give a try if they havenÂt already."
"A very strong beer not intended for session drinking but a good choice for a belgian ale nonetheless."
"74"
"Drinkability/notes: A ubiquitous classic, the fact that Duvel is so readily available may cause one to hold it in contempt, resist this temptation. A remarkably elegant beer that compares quite well to champagne. I suspect that the experience is greatly enhanced by the use of proper glassware. This is a beer that is not to be missed."
"Hazy gold color, much darker at the top of the glass than the bottom. Huge 4"" that fades into jagged spires. Great hops and yeast in the nose. Taste is huge. Fulll of yeast, alcohol spiciness, hops, and butter flavors. Mouthfeel is full and well carbonated. So much closer to being the ""Champagne of Beers"" than the macro label that carries the phrase."
"First of all, I think that the actual Duvel glass truly brings out all of the fantastic features that this beer has to offer. The head on this beer is as good as it comes. Very thick and fluffy throughout the entire glass. It never got less than a quarter inch thick. As far as the aroma goes, this is where the tulip shaped glass shined! All of the floral fruitness is concentrated to the exact spot that your nose hits as you take a sip. Yeasty explosions fill the nostrils and remind you that you are enjoying one of Belgium's finest. Taste...this beer has all the pieces to make this a true classic. The super sweet malt taste is perfectly balanced and comes together ultra smooth with a somewhat dry finish. This beer is truly spectacular and I am now an advocate on proper glassware! Enjoy this one!!!"
"Luxurious ultra-foamy aspirin white head forms quickly, remaining until the first sip, after which it slowly puts on a magnificent churning, foaming show, until it reaches a good 3 or 4 centimetres. Upon my word, the head is like a living thing. Untouched, it remains like styrofoam. Sometimes it appears so thick it looks like ice cream sticking to the side of the glass. Lacing is the thickest I have ever seen. The liquid is almost rose-wine coloured, slightly pink and occasionally almost white. Light light orange and very pale, with only fleeting golden glimpses. Whilst at first it appears to be transparent, held up to the light it is clearly not, but quite thick and murky. Aroma immediately is sugary aged peaches or nectarines, along with a baking-bread yeast smell. A definite aged smell to this bottle: musky, dusty, and very mature. The sweetness borders on sourness, and some honey aromas become clear. Candy apples, pears, apricots, sugar-rich candy, light but very bready malt, ripe green apples, soap characteristics; not as spicy as it is sweet. Taste delivers on the aroma fully. What struck me immediately was how incredibly drinkable this was for a strong Belgian. The taste is a superbly balanced experience. I was expecting cloying sweetness with some fruity yeast, but it has so much more. The hops, undetectable in the aroma, complement the sweetness expertly. Dusty, full yeast taste on the middle, giving green apples again strongly, along with other fruits, perhaps pear. Toasted malt with strong caramel and semi-sourness, almost akin to tomato juice if tasted strongly enough. Very full, yet it disappears in effervescence on the tongue in a slight tingle and foaminess. When exhaling with the beer in the mouth, I get strong dough or pasta tastes. Some fresh pine wood tastes. The aftertaste for me personally was all green apples and sugary pear. Yes, the phenols are there, but at first I did not even notice the alcohol--it was that smooth and balanced. Certainly it does not suggest 8.5%. This bottle seemed to be very foamy, but not overly gaseous in the mouth. The lees, tasted separately, give super fresh apple and fresh dough smells, dust and ultra-sweetness. The lees give the beer even more of a white appearance, almost like a wit-bier. Smooth in the mouth, very full, it tasted basically as though I had poured some dry yeast into a glass full of lukewarm water and consumed it. The yeast made the beer warmer. Personal verdict: one of the best. This is classic beer, and when aged it accrues even greater proportions, like a classic novel written a hundred years ago. This is something most people will revisit again and again, with friends, on memorable occasions. This beer is one of the few I have found that have an indescribable quality about them; it is not easy to put into words why this is such heavenly liquid."
"Still, a fine beer for all occasions, and I imagine it would be fun to use this in a bait and switch on a Bud drinker. Ha!"
"Every time I have this beer I feel differently about it, so my review may change often. There have been times where I would have given it a perfect score, and times that I am disappointed by a harsh bite. Anyways, definitely leave the lees in the bottle for this one."
"A good session beer except for the 8.5% abv. Wonderful belgian ale, a devil of a beer."
"The beer pours a nice light straw color with a gigantic meringue-like head. The nose is very lemony. The beer is a sweet malty flavor with a lemon undertone that finishes with just a slight hop kick on my tongue. Very refreshing for this moderately warm summer day. The beer is moderately thick in my mouth, without an overowering carbonation. This is a nice, easy drinking beer. The only thing keeping this from being a true session beer for me is the ABV."
"d"
"Drinkability/Overall: So light and crisp that you forget about the high ABV. Easy to drink and a pleasure to enjoy! A devil of a treat!"
"From the stubbie bottle pours a slightly hazy golden liquid, with a thick, fluffy white head. So far, this is one great looking brew. Some lace on the glass, as the head shrinks, but never fully disappears. Swirling the glass brings another rise to the head. Smells slightly yeasty, with some spice to it, almost peppery. Pale malt flavor, with some tartness, slight fruit notes to go with a slight spicey flavor. Slightly bitter in the finish. The alcohol is noticable at the end. High carbonation makes this have an almost creamy mouthfeel. Overall, what a classic! Nothing is overpowering. This has a good amount of alcohol, but you might not notice it until it is too late. Damn you devil!! Welcome to the dark side!"
"One of my favourite commercially-available beers of all time. This beer is best enjoyed in a tulip glass. Pours a nice, golden color, and is a bit hazy with the ""in-the-bottle"" fermentation yeast. Has an excellent, foamy head that remains the entire time you are drinking it. You can eat the head with a fork. The smell is exquisite, with spicy and fruity tones and a bit of malt. The taste is wonderful. I enjoy belgian ales, and this one is excellent for a bottled beer commercially available in the USA. It is a strong, crisp, spicy ale with a bit of fruitiness that goes down incredibly smooth. I highly recommend this for anyone, anytime, but especially one who is trying out the Belgian style. Excellent ale!"
"Drinkability- Wouldn't want to drink too many of these because Duvel is fairly heavy and strong in alcohol. I think this would be a great introductory beer to the Belgian style, as it is complex and not as overpowering on the palate as the Chimay Tripel and Dark."
"As for drinkability, I'd say this is a beer to try once in a while. It's good, but it's hard to knock back more than one of these 8.5% alcohol havin' beers."
"Notes: This beer has a nice warming quality. Because of it's great flavors and it's balanced taste, this one will stay in my good graces."
"drinkability? going through a full 750ml of duvel would not be a problem due to its exceptional attenuation and clean finish -- but I know better. this devil is one to make deals with in moderation."
"Wow this beer has the biggest head ever. Pours a very pale lager yellow with a foamy monster that looks like marshmellows expanding. The lacing is clumpy mounds. Smell is rather clean to the nose, slight yeast smell, fruit notes bring up the rear. The taste is a blast of yeast, I detect light malts and a mild hop bitterness. Very refreshing, a light bodied ale, very drinkable, and that is scary with this monster being 8.5%"
"Some great fruity characters burst on the tongue. No sweetness, just fruit followed by bitter finish that lingers."
"Great drinkability. Complex and well rounded."
"Drinkability: Very tasty, but you feel the alcohol quickly, so having more than 750 ml maybe a bit of a push."
"Drinks fantastic."
"The smell is really cool, you smell slight esters and hops but mostly spices of many sorts, and each taste and smell vary from instance to instance. This beer is complex goodness and I would love it on any special occasion..."
"Very drinkable for one so strong..I will buy this again."
"Seriously guys this is as good as it gets and this is what ale was meant to be."
"Large bottle , with cork and cage. Pours very light wheat, cloudy, head is the stuff of beer dreams. Lacing is world class. Intricate,fluffy, voluminious. Great retention, finally dissolving to the tiniest of tiny bubble sheens. Nose of yeast, pepper, powdered sugar, alcohol, citrus and a light fruityness. Taste is of limes, gin, tart, peppery, bitterness late. mouthfeel is creamy and crisp at the same time. World class Belgian. Its a blessing to us all that this nectar of the gods is widely available. Go get some now, chill, pour and enjoy with a wide variety of foods."
"as an end note, once the beer warms a bit a peppery alcohol taste steps in front of the warm bready flavors. in my opinion this is definitely a beer to enjoy on the cooler side of the temperature scale."
"From a corked 750 ml bottle, it pours with an enormous white head. The head is head itself is absolutely amazing. Stable and rocky, with large pockets between the bubbles. It reminds me of glass insulating foam (the kind used on chemical piping). Lace is phenomical. The aroma is flowery, a mix of hops and esters. ItÂs got a peppery tinge to the smell as well. The beer itself is crystal clear and effervescent. My glass has a scoring at the bottom, and the steady stream of bubbles that rises from it looks vaguely like a flame on a roaring fire. The taste is sweet up front, followed by an intense hoppiness. I remember the surprise that I experienced when I first tasted this beer. ItÂs so intensely flavorful. In some beers, the aroma is the dominant attribute, but with Duvel, the mouth-taste is essential. ItÂs full, and almost chewy. I get a yeasty taste throughout the beer as well. This beer is simply marvelous."
"I bought a gift set that included the Duvel glass, and let me say, this beer looks dead sexy sitting in it's own glass. Golden in color with a bit of roange and a giant white clumpy head with tiny bubbles surging towards the top in a column in the middle of the glass. It smells like freshly cut grass and pears, and though it doesn't really make sense, it smells like it's color. It tatses like i'd think grass would with a touch of peper. the carbonationa nd alcohol burn on the outside edge of the tounge a bit and the aftertaste is lemony with other cirtus characteristics.The head lingers for a long time. It is thin in the mouth but the carbonation really gives it a fuller feal. While you can taste hints of the 8.5% abv, it adds to teh beer, and overall youwouldn't think the abv was that high making it quite drinkable. I probably drink this beer slower then most, a definate sippin' beer because the flavor burst on your tounge with each small sip, and as it warms the pear/cirtus flavor comes out more and the slight peppery flavor disapears. I think pepper might be the wrong word but i can't think of how else to describe that flavor."
"Surprisingly drinkable for 8.5% alcohol."
"This is becoming quite available in this area so I think I'll be picking some up as the occasional nightcap."
"Overall: This is one amazing beer, and it deserves all the credit it receives. This beer is incredibly drinkable with its deceptive 8.5% alcohol content. This beer looks beautiful when poured. The taste is even better. All-in-all a world-class beer from start to finish. Highly recommended."
"Huge, froathy, brilliant white head left a ton of lace. Looks like a giant fluffy white cloud. Sunny wheat colored beer. Smells of fresh grass-skunky hops, very inviting. Light refreshing beer, lots of carbonation makes it float across the tongue. Hints of lemon, grass, light piney-citrus hops. Smooth clean finish. Great beer, very enjoyable."
"Finally got around to reviewing this after all these years. Pours a very light straw color, slighty hazy yet very light looking.. A nice white head floats on top. Aroma of yeasty malts and spices greet the nose hairs - nothing overpowering, yet inviting. Taste is fairly clean for a belgian. Starts off very clean and carbonated, then the flavors kick in . Slight tropical fruitiness along with a slight bready malt. All flavors are subtle here. A nice fine carbonation holds this together. slight hoppy finish to keep things dry. Quite drinkable but not quite spectacular. Just a good belgian triple, and perhaps a benchmark. very dry and subdued."
"I poured this into a Rapscallion glass. Which produced an enormous white head. It looked like the merienge on a Lemon Mereinge Pie.The color was a cloudy yellow and the head left a kind of chunky lace on the glass. It has a strong fruityand spicey aroma. Reminded me of Apples and Pepper. The strong alcohol (8.5%) and the hops bitterness hits you all at once and settles into a crisp finish. I would have liked to get more flavor characteristics from this beer after smelling it."
"Pours a golden yellow with a huge fluffy white head that looks like a mountain range after 30 seconds. Great lacing as well noticed. Aromas of stong floral hops, fruits, yeast, and spices. Great smelling beer whatever is in there. It's just smells too good to drink. Taste however is better. NIce hoppy bite that smooths out into a nice finish. So many flavors going on here. It's great to taste. Carbonation is big on this one and I could drink this one all the time. Great brew. I love it."
"I understand now why there are so many proponents of this beer. A fine one indeed. I will try it again."
"Belgian Golden Ale. Pours cloudy golden with a lusciously thick white foamy head that has very nice retention. Good amount of carbination but not overwhelming. Great spicey bite in the aroma and taste, very peppery and wonderful. Good creamy body that is not too thick in your mouth, you can taste the alcohol- cream sherry comes to mind. Wonderful ale, great drinkability."
"""Pleasant"" pretty much sums it up, and while not amazing, pleasant works real well. The individual pieces are light in nature but they combine to flesh out a lively identity. The ABV is real and present, maybe the most substantial of the separate elements, and you have to regard it, but the full flavor and effervescence make it nicely drinkable. So even if it doesn't floor me, I'd never feel cheated while I'm drinking one."
"A beer well-deserving of a very good reputation. Poured from a 14 oz. bottle into a tulip Duvel glass. A truly exceptional appearance. Nice gold color with a creamy white head which lasts a while. When it does go down, it maintains a pretty thick lace. The smell and taste are intertwined. You can just smell the spicy, fruity Belgian yeast esters. The taste definitely has those. It reminds me of Grand Cru's I have tried. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. And honestly, that is a hard category for me to rank. The esters, while they make for a very good taste, it reduces its drinkability for me. A truly great beer."
"Duvel poured a nice pale golden yellow with a large white head that had an incredible amount of staying power. When it finally diminished, it left a nice lacing all the way around. The smell was a nice spicy aroma with hints of citris. The taste was fairly sweet with citris flavors on the front end and a little bit of a peppery kick to it on the tail end. The carbonation made the mouthfeel failry light and gave it an almost champagne-like quality to it. Overall the drinkabilty is remarkably high as it is a very smooth beer. Of course, that can be quite dangerous due to the alcohol content. This is definitely one of the best beers that I have had the privilege of drinking and I recommend it to any and everyone."
"Poured from a brown 750 ml bottle. Poured a light golden color that was a little cloudy after a careful pour per instructions on the label. Head was composed of small bubbles in a large white setting. It then settled down and left a sticky, sugary, cotton-candy look on the side of the glass. Aroma was very clean, fresh, and floral. The flavor was very nicely balanced among all elements. No flavors jumped out at me, it wasn't too sweet, too hoppy, too anything. But it was good! Lots of floral, butter, herbal notes with a slight tart edge. Loved it! Alcohol was a little sneaky."
"A huge foamy head on a glittering golden color. Nice smell of yeast, grain, wheat. Alcohol too. The taste is a smooth yeast, citrus and banana flavor at first, very similar to a hefe weizen. Quickly, the hops and the alcohol give you a strong kick and the taste becomes way more aggressive, with a thick mouthfeel and a dry long lasting floral hoppy aftertaste. I like how this beer combines two very different feelings and tastes, and how the change in taste is very sudden and kind of unexpected. After a while, the two distinct aspects mix together to form this beer's unique character. Very nice."
"Duvel may very well be an acquired taste. It reminded me, to be honest, of a beer that had been crossed with cognac or brandy."
"P.S.. - I finally bought the glass pack to enjoy Duvel in a tulip, and it made quite a difference. The carbonation was good before, but now there are a ton of bubbles constantly streaming up from the D etched on the bottom of this glass. If you ever are looking to buy a tulip style glass, this is the best way to get two of them for a great price and see a demonstration of the magic they do on a beer."
"Very good beer though."
"A 330 ml bottle served in one of the Duvel tulip's included within the gift pack poured up to three fingers of light, sculptable foam. There was good retention, and ample Belgian lace. The aroma was dominated by alcohol, and strong spicy scents. The flavors were well balanced and earthy with grain, spicy, and hints of the strong alcohol. It's a smooth drinkable beer, that I will enjoy again."
"Extremely light and drinkable. I'd still grab a Fin before this, but I have a newfound respect for this Belgian Golden and look forward to drinking the other three bottles in my fridge."
"What a head! This thing looked like a junior high science class volcano project, the head was a good inch above the rim of the glass, with no spillage. The initial taste had some bite to it, you know this beer has some serious ETOH. I liked the smooth taste and mouthfeel, it had a bit of a rubbing alcohol aroma to it though. Overall, I liked this beer, just didn't fall in love with it."
"This beer looked very good going into the glass. It had a great white head on it. The aroma was very noticable. This was the first time I have ever experienced a Belgian Strong Ale. I guess I just don't care for the sour aftertase which I believe is typical of the style. I am sure it is a great beer it's class. It is just not for me."
"Overall a very good beer. If you enjoy La Fin Du Monde, Rare Vos and others, try the ale that inspired 'em all."
"Purchased a few 33 cL bottles of this for a bargain. I brought them home and whipped out the Duvel tulip glasses, which are the only way to drink this beer. This guy pours out a beautiful pale golden color, and has the most incredible fluffy white head billow atop of the beer. There's instructions on how to pour it so that it does that too. Just in case. The smell is of active little hop, some citrus, small fermented esters. The taste is wonderful. Can something be rich and light? It glides easy, with clean feel. Again, light citrus and hop prescence with a very clean malt to give structure. Interesting spice notes play with the body of the beer. No way you'd know about its high ABV. This is the best looking beer on the planet, and among the best tasting. They're not just being cocky when the last of the pouring instructions tells you ""Enjoy perfection."""
"Enjoy"
"A hazy, pale, golden ale with a large white head and vigorous carbonation. This smells great with a peppery maltiness and some spiciness underlaying it. The aroma is evident as soon as the bottle is opened. The taste is a clean, malty ale with almost no bitterness, and a hint of sweetness. There are spices present that I have a hard identifying but this is a powerful elixir. It has a clean, bubbly feel in the mouth and then the alcohol hits. It is excellent from the first drop to the last. It gets more drinkable as it warms up. The only drawback is my inability to drink more than one due to the alcohol content, but I'll be back tomorrow."
"It is a clear, pale golden color with a big, fluffy head. The aroma has some delicate hops with a touch of citrus. It is smooth and light. The finish is a spicy, crisp dryness. It is refreshing and wonderful, and it goes down so easily despite its high alcohol."
"Let me preface this by saying this is my favorite beer. It pours to a crisp golden hue which is protected by a massive white head. Champagne like bubbles rapidly race to the surface of this beer. Aroma is of spice but with some notes of yeast. The taste is clean and yeasty but balanced well with some spicey aftertaste. I thought the 750 ml bottle had less hoppiness than I am used to in the 33 cl bottles. The same duvel character remained though. Mouthfeel is exceptional as this beer goes down creamy and bubbly. Drinkability is also amazing considering the massive alcohol content of this brew. I wish I could have more than a couple of these in a night and still feel fine the next morning. This beer is a true masterpiece in my mind."
"Very interesting beer. This one poured a pale yellow color with a really nice frothy white head that left little specks of lace down the glass. The smell was quite unique, with a slightly bitter apple scent and a grainyness to it as well. The taste was quite dry like champagne but with better flavor. The apple scent came out slightly in the flavor but I mostly detected a peppery spice which was very nicely paired with the bubbly mouthfeel. This is definanlty not a beer that I could drink all of the time, but I think it would pair well with many meals and would convert some wine and champagne lovers to beer as well."
"Duvel pours with a giant head that takes a long long time to diminish. Almost whipped cream-like. The beer is a cloudy golden color. Nose is full of hops and spice. Taste is very bitter, with some finishing sweetness with a slight bready flavor. A true classic, served best cold unlike most Belgians."
"Verysmooth and drinkable and no taste of the 8.5%."
"Before I had this one I'd heard it described as ""beer crossed with champagne", and while that's a fine description for a layman, I'd have to say it's much better than that. I'd keep this one around 365 days a year if the price was right. Certainly in my top 20."
" I bet this bottle would have been better w/ another year in the cellar. Classic Belgian Golden Ale."
"This beer deserves the hype!"
"Duvel poured a cloudy effervesent light gold with two fingers of white head. It had an aroma of malt, fruit and flowers. The taste was sharp with hints of malt and good hop bite to it, a finish that had a mint and bananna taste to it. It was well bodied with a honeyish feel to it. This is a fine beer and the taste and body make you want to drink it in volume, the bite though encourages a little slower pace."
"All in all, tastes much the same as other beers of its kind, but certainly a genuine original."
"I don't criticise but, much as you would like to, you just can't drink this stuff all day. Or not unless you are taking the next 2 days off work."
"A classic, and deservedly so. A beer I'll be returning to over and over again."
"The appearance was superior. A hazy bright gold, with a huge 3 finger white head of large bubbles. The head retained for almost the entire drinking experience. When the head did begin to recede a bit it left great lacing, picture perfect. In fact I just changed my appearance rating to 5. The smell was good. Very yeast filled and musty. It only lost points due to the alcohol which overpowered the others a bit. The taste was also exceptional. Grains, musty yeast, and some spiciness and alcohol in the background. I didn't taste the fruit notes in the middle that some have described, but I only had one. Alas, maybe next time. Mouthfeel was very good as well. Very carbonated, bubbles looked like they were being powered by a small motor. Extremely crisp. Drinkability was excellent as well. I wish I had more than one. Couldn't think of a better beer to drink to break into my 20th review."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"Ahhhh, very good indeed. This beer has a classic feel to it that lives up to its classic status. The color is rather deceiving with its rather pale golden color. It looks much lighter than it truly is. The head is quite nice-good and sticky, snowy white and long lived. Aromas are fairly complex and inviting-malty, somewhat anteseptic and spice driven with some citrusy hop notes as well. The mouth feel is damn nice! Refreshing with good dryness and medium to full body, this is a solidly balanced drink-never flabby or sticky. Flavors are classic in that they cleanse with a sweet/spicy clove-corriander? and, banana like flavor much like a German Hefe, while at the same time offering Belgium richness and complexity which kicks the beer up a notch. This is like a Hefe Squared! Interesting how easy this beer is to drink-remarkable really! I will be re-visiting this brew with food very soon as it seems to offer great potential. As I drink it, probably too quickly, I feel I will discover the origin of the name..."
"Duvel is one of the better beers out there. Appearance is a pale yellow with a huge head. Took a little while for it to settle down. But when it did, oh my! Smell consists of mainly yeast with some alcohol, but not much. Taste is out of this world. Starts out with some of that alcohol kick, but it's very well hidden with the yeast then finishes off with some apples/pears. 8.5% is a little to laugh at, you can't taste it at all. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer all day on a nice summer day outside. First class beer. I would recommend it."
"A superior brew in all respects!"
"I was rather surprised that I was unable to detect any alchol taste being as its a strong beer. Its really well balanced beer and one that I will continue to enjoy."
"Most enjoyable and the abv well disguised amidst the many flavors present in this offering"
"Nice beer no doubt, however, with the plethora of choices we have, I won't be scrambling for this."
"ah, duvel. hadn't had one in quite some time and was quite happy to once again revisit a brew i knew would be enjoyable. it poursa lovely golden colour that is slightly cloudy from the yeast and is a bit deceiving, as the body is a bit fuller than it appears. the head here (in a proper duvel tulip glass) is simply astonishing. fluffy and pillow-esque and just massive. it holds for quite some time and leaves an eratic sticky lacing that holds more of a ring form as the liquid progresses downward in the glass. the carbonation here is awesome as well, though maybe a bit high at times. in the duvel glass it forms a bubble column, so to speak, shooting up from the stem in the center of the glass so as almost to make the liquid appear to be on fire. quite nice. the smell is good but not exceptional. sweet and floral with spice hints throughout. the taste in rather enjoyabele with the sweetness still dominating here. it moves to a bit of a spicy flavour then back to sweetness before a bitter finish. very smooth, crisp and refreshing. the 8.5 alcohol is hidden well so this brew is a bit deceiving but just damn good."
"Some people might string me up and burn me but I think of this as the fizzy yellow stuff of premium beers. Keep in mind that's not a knock."
"All in all a very intriguing ale. Champagne like in it's appearance and carbonation, but a malt monster at the same time. Amazing something that looks this light is so full of flavor. I will most certainly be popping bottles of this on New Year's eve - let's see who thinks it's the best champagne they've ever had. ;)"
"Overall: I canÂt see why I have passed this beer up time after time. Even my wife (who is from Bitburg Germany and a diehard Bitburger drinker) even enjoys it. A solid beer time after time and pure enjoyment to drink."
"33 cl bottle dated best before 6/2006. Decanted entire contents into authentic Duvel goblet (17 oz. goblet for an 11.2 oz beer, four fingers of head). Thick, rockiest white head atop a hazed straw pilsner colored nectar. Gobules of foamies cling to the sides of the goblet. Sweet candi sugar and musty hops with accents of spicy yeast and a completed fermentation. Citrus notes and black pepperiness, not unlike Orval. Tastes complex like a sneak attack on your tastebuds; sweet and dry, tart and zingy. Effervescent like you would not believe, bubbly to the tongue. Beautiful tight lacing in glass. It's complexity makes it one of the best beers in the world, whereas the recipe history stated that Duvel was initially formulated to compete with the growing pilsner boom of the 30s and 40s. Love this beer. I prefer it out of the 75 cl or the 3 liter bottles, but there's no way you can go wrong with this beer."
"Drinkability: This is one devious brew: Pristine in it's innocence, devastating in it's betrayal (hey, I like that). Never would have expected to like this so much...thanks BA!"
"Golden ale with a contemplative huge mushroom white head that sticks to the glass forever. Hops and lemon aroma. Complex body like every ingredient was added to the others thoroughly the tasting: citrus, good quality hops that create a memorable dry bitterness. Delicious and incredibly well done. World Classic in every regard and if I could only give one 5 for the appearance, Duvel would get it."
"Notes: A top shelf brew, this one does it for me and then some. Pretty much sex in a bottle and the devil told me to drink it. Duvel is close to dry champagne but so much more. Between the bitterness and the sheer crispness, this beer is what I expect from the Belgian strong pale ale style."
"A pleasant beer in every sense: interesting bottle, light hazy color, nice head. Pleasant taste not overpowering. Found it a bit creamy and sweet and not overly dry, but higher than average alcohol does affect mouthfeel. perhaps it was my batch or the chemistry changes depending on storage and age. Nice with food and would have another anytime."
"Disappointing...."
"The smell, a mixture of wheaty/ malty contrasts with some soury ingredients, makes it certainly complex. But what you dont identify here and that perhaps I found somewhat reppeling was that the tasting, as you progress, you find the alcohol being ever more perceivable. That held me back from another one and left me a bit disappointed, but not enough to undermine its overall quality."
"Everything seemed to agree with me until I actually tasted it--far too full of a spirits-like aftertaste for me. Not my thing, but pretty interesting nonetheless."
"Its peppery bite is the most defining characteristic on the mouth. It's what makes the beer so good, but so hard to drink more than a few."
"Very carbonated, like a glass of champagne. This one made me sleepy, that would be the only thing keeping me from drinking a few."
"Pours a cloudy yellow under a huge and billowing white head that takes its sweet time to settle. Nice lace, but the liquid is just too pale for my taste. The smell is pleasant - pepper and spice. The mouth is way too carbonated and heavy with sweetness. The bubbles actually hurt the tongue and palate. I'll concede that there is a lot of complex tastes here, but none of them is really what I want in a beer - standard francophone sweetness, a bit of pepper and clove, very little in the way of malt, and practically no hops. Oh, wait, there is a bit of a hoppy bite in the aftertaste, but it is short-lived. I'll concede that this is a quality beer, but it sure isn't my cup of tea - or chalice of beer, for that matter."
"paid $6.99 for a 750ml."
":) sarcasm."
"My fears are allayed upon the first sip. Clove, bannana, apple, and pear come through in a very soft and clean wave. The taste just seems to ebb away to a subtly dry finish. If it wasn't for the 8.5% ABV, you could drink this all night. Can't emphisize enough how clean and finished this beer is."
"lively carbonation. peppery sweetness, balanced by earthy ""european"" hops. flavor and mouthfeel deepens as it warms. the most quaffable 8.5% beer i've ever drank. narcoticly boozy. just great stuff. even though i've had it on occasion in the us, it will always remind me of my first trip to europe. fantastic stuff."
"The aftertaste has a bit of bitterness. Very warming towards the end where the alcohol starts to come through. I enjoyed this beer very much but don't think I will go for it all the time."
"One of the best beers."
"After reading another reviewer's comments about drinking it with a chilli, I may try it with a curry - although most Brits drink lagers with currys, I have heard recently from some Indians that red wines work well, so I guess a really heavy beer might also do the trick"
"Cloudy pale yellow with a meringue-like white head. Great lacing and even better retention when poured in the Duvel glass. Nose features aromas of herbal hops, yeast, mild spice, fruit and maybe a touch of candy sugar. Taste is complex, round, and quite enjoyable. The yeast character never strays far, while notes of passion fruit, apricot, sweet malt, candy sugar and spice lead to a zesty hop kick on the finish. Effervescent mouthfeel lends itself well to this beer's overall characteristics. Incredibly drinkable for an 8.5% ale, Duvel is something else. Truly a favorite, this is the beer that morphed me into a Belgian ale fan. Wonderful stuff and a must-try. I can't believe it took me so long to review this one...."
"Pours out a very light yellow wiht a massive massive fluffy white head. Smells quite dry, a little tough to discern certain things but alcohol was definetly present. Tastes slightly more hoppy in the front but wham then the malt hits you, the alcohol is present but hidden well for the most part. It almost has the mouthfeel of a sweet champagne, great beer."
"Pours golden with a huge white fluffy head. Sweet, peppery, spicy, but clean smelling nose. Very creamy, yet at the same time has a crazy crisp mouthfeel. Almost like champagne. Starts rather bitter, but ends with malt sweetness. Minor fruitiness. Dry aftertaste. This is good stuff, and I can really appreciate it, but for some reason it just doesn't do it for me."
"This beer feels like champagne in the mouth- nice tight carbonation. The floral, hoppy flavors show little of the high alcohol content of this ""devil"". Since my first encounter I have been seeking this beer out whenever and wherever possible- what more could a brewery hope for?"
"This is an excellent beer and a true treat....unfortunately I just about had to take out a second mortage to buy this bottle so I don't see drinking it regularly....It would be a nice treat now and then but to be honest I'd prefer a belgian that is more of a sipper....this slides down too easy for the $$$ I invested...still this is a great beer I'd love to enjoy more of in the future..."
"Spectacular! Served in a unique bubble necked bottle. Head is creamy, thick, condensing and everlasting. Color is a somewhat unattractive golden yellow, the only downside. Smells sweet and wheaty, and other indiscript pleasant aromas. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had, hints of malt, sugar, hoppy thickness. Carbonation stays with the flavor and enhances it. Aftertaste is much the same, but dies with a hint of wheat. Buy this when you see it!"
"They should have sent a poet. Nearly my favorite belgian to date. Billowy, ceaseless, virgin-white head. One it settles it leaves a pure lace on the glass. The color is absolutely golden. With yeast added, its opaque and brilliant when held up to light. The nose is very direct. Fine balance of belgian hops and malts, light fruitiness, more citrus than sweet. Spices present themselves, but not in memorable fashion. The mouthfeel is crisp and micro-bubbly, as much as any champange. It imposes itself and therefore detracts, on the flavor a bit. Tastes present are citrus malts, genuine Belgian hops, apple, and coriander. Even at 8.5% you have to search for alcohol flavor, which is dangerous if put in the wrong hands. A fine brew for nearly any night. For it's availability and price, it is a must-have."
"A definite wolf in sheepÂs clothing."
"The apperance was a cloudy gold, a huge head came forth and was there even at the end,more bubbles than a warm champagne cereal hoppy aroma, very hoppy appleish taste, didn't seem as good as I remember although it might have been to cold, because it did seem to get better at the end."
"A true king of beers but incredibly drinkable even with the strong ABV. If only I could afford to drink it on a regular basis, I certainly would."
"Golden ale with one very nice head that stayed on top of brew for a few minutes. Quite refreshing with the right amount of spice. Alcohol taste is not too distinct. I could drink this one very often. I find a ressemblance in the malts to the one Unibroue use for their beers."
"The bottle hadn't been in my possession very long, but it must have been rather old. The beer was rather dull and fizzy. There were some interesting flavors, but they were very muted. It was good, very good, but not great. All in all a let down; this particular bottle anyway."
"ABV of 8.5% however. By Hercules, that's some powerful stuff! Barely touched the bottle, and I already feel like I've been slugged. Strong pale ale? Damn right, it's strong. Careful with this stuff, but do try it!"
"I got a taste of bitter orange in my glass. Belgian style sugar does not interfere with the taste, and there is a nice hoppy nose, too. That and a head that can rise above the edge of the glass like a meringue! I wanted my tasting of this beer to never end."
"Beer is bright gold and clear, basically looks like a good Pils. This one tries to jump out of the glass as it pours with a lively carbonation that creates a thick white long lasting head. The head is Meringue like in consistency. The beer smells sharp and slightly herbal and fruity, accompanied by a woodiness. Has a lightly sweet taste with a complex herbal aftertaste. Lightly bitter and hoppy. Leaves one with a soft maltiness in the finish. A very light beer that hides its alcoholic strength well."
"Well, what could I add to the prolific reviews already well known to those that have tried this amazing brew? Not much, actually. But what I can tell you is that if you enjoy a REALLY smooth, extremely well balanced strong ale that you can quaff down with unparalleled ease, then this is the one Belgian you cannot do without! Pudding like head, cloudy amber strong ale that is spicy, bitter and sweet all at once. Godly smoothness in the mouth, and a nice dry, semi-sweet finish. Liquid ambrosia! Buy or die."
"Initial pour was a perfectly clear gold with an agressive white head that fills the remainder of the glass. As I swirled the bottle and decanted the yeast sediments (which is my personal preference), liquid gold turned into hazy apricot. Aromas are sweet and spicy--bananas and cloves perhaps and there is some grain in there to hold it all together. The first sip is an arsenal of spicy fruit flavors with a nice bite from the carbonation and alcohol as if the beer is reminding you show respect where its due. Everything becomes extremely balanced and much more mellow as I take a few more sips, which is where the deception begins. This beer is 8.5% ABV, but the devil doesn't show its true identity until the goblet is drained. Very smooth and very drinkable, a must for any belgian lover."
"ng"
"Poured a large bright white, rocky and retentive head that lasted to the end. The color is a bright yellow color. It is a little hazy with a good showing of effervescence. Smell is fruity, earthy, and citrus. Taste is sweet, fruity and with a dry peppery finish. It has a great balance of tastes, mouth feel, and a crisp finish. A very distinctive character."
"Pours a golden yellow with an out of control head white head that last quite a while. Little bubbles continuously coming up from the bottom of the glass. It has a pleasant aroma of fruit and yeast. You can taste the light fruit and malty flavor it also has a nice little hint of spice. It is very drinkable even with the high content of alcohol. It might be a little pricey for some but IÂll take quality over quantity any day. It's good to have the Devil in your collection."
"This is laughing, pitiless, beautiful beer."
"Pleasant to drink. I'm going to go find another one."
"A wonderful beer that I cannot wait to experience again. Cheers!"
"Light gold color, large head. A full bodied Belgian golden ale. Very malty, slightly toasty and candy sweet. Slightly hoppy. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sharp. Some alcohol bite present at 8.5%"
"What a real nice pour, a straw color with a huge rocky head that sticks very nice to my glass,aroma is spicey and very yeasty.The taste is fruity with definent yeast flavors and some very spicey notes,a truley enjoyable complex beer.A world classic Iam glad I finally got the chance to try this beer."
"Pours a very pale golden color with the biggest fluffy white head I've ever seen. It's mostly spices in both the aroma and the taste. It's highly carbonated and very light in body. Actually very refreshing and quite drinkable. At 8.5%, it's high drinkability might be dangerous."
"This beer must be the very definition of ""Belgian ale."" It has all of the best qualities of Belgian ales in the most perfect proportions, including the fluffiest God diggidy head I ever saw. It has everything you could possibly want in a Belgian ale, and it's virtually impossible to ask for more. The Belgians can craft better brews, but as meat-and-potatoes belgian ales go, this has to be the best."
"Update: A sampling of this in 2004 shows amazing consistancy. After sporting a gorgeous appearance from several different bottles IÂm upping this rating by 0.5."
"A wonderful beer. Had this last night for the first time after getting off work around 11:30PM. What a way to end the day! Reminded me of champagne. A very foamy white head, lots of carbonation. Poured a straw color into my Chimay goblet (so I don't have a Duvel glass - sue me!). Scents of sweet fruits and honey. Taste of honey and bananas, and a nice crisp zap of hoppiness that keeps it from being too cloying. Definitely did not notice the high amount of alcohol, so this would probably have led me to dance in the middle of the street if I had a large supply of them on hand. I'll have to get my wine snob old man to drink this as part of my ongoing campaign to get him to respect beer."
"I was raving to my girlfriend about the beer, and told her i could think of nothing i wanted to do more than sit in a dark, silent room while drinking a bottle of Duvel. she suggested something she could do to me in that room that would improve the experience-- yep, it's still my wildest *beer* fantasy. time to make the 45 minute trip it takes to buy more!"
"While not quite as pretty as Orval I think it tastes quite a bit better. With chunky white head, clear straw coloring, and a faint, slightly spicy aroma this beer still presents it's self very well. Very crisp with a slight spiciness and a bit of bitterness. Not as sweet as I expected, and very, very drinkable. I found it a much better beer as it warmed, or it could just be the 750ml bottle of 8.5% goodness warming me...either way its a winner!"
"Reminds me of champagne almost from start to finish. The fizzy white head quickly recedes down to the top of the slightly hazy honey/straw colored beer. Nose is sweet, a bit fruity, with hints of honey. Flavor is also sweet, with hints of honey and candy. Mouthfeel is crisp, a bit tingly. Average drinkability due to sweetness and carbonation."
"Pours with a 1Â head, Full carbonation and cloudy, yellowish color. Very light in taste, with a bite of hops. Carbonation almost explodes in mouth on first sip. Head remains throughout glass. Strong hop presence. Beer practically floats off the tongue and hops grab onto the sides of cheeks and the flavor lingers there. Excellent amount of lace. As beer warms and settles, hop flavor mellows and the beer seems to thicken up and gains a citrus finish."
"Poured from a sweet looking 330 ml brown bottle, best before date May 2006. Looks like heaven in a glass, slightly hazed golden hue, massive amount of carbonation action (more fun than watching sea monkeys), and a massive chunky white head that stayed all of the way and left some serious lacing. Light citrus aroma, some coriander, a bit of hay. Flavour is very light and subtle at first, considering that this is 8.5% abv, but it all seems to come out in the finish and linger, mostly citrus tones lightly surrounded by spice. Very smooth mouthfeel, deceiving, as the angel on my one shoulder says to stop at one, but the devil on the other side says to go hog wild. This is very, very, very fine ale, all the hype was true."
"The beer pours a light golden color with a frothy white head that lasts. The nose is fruity with belgian spices. There is a banana smell and a hint of corriander. The taste is good; again with the spices and the fruitiness. This is a good Belgian ale straight from the heart of Belgium. The mouthfeel is a bit too intense. The carbonation reminds me of a few bottle conditioned homebrews that went wrong. The beer is light bodied. It is a good drinking beer and one that I would love to enjoy again, although Ommegang's Hennepin is better."
"Nice woosh when you pop open the cork. Pours our a murky golden blond with one hell of a head, almost cotton candy like. Smell is fruity malt, with apple overtones. Stunningly drinkable, nice medium body with the fruit overtones. This is what a light bodied ale should taste like. I would drink this any day of the week.."
"It is smooth with a tiny bite. A very crisp feel in the mouth. Refreshing. A quality ale for a hot day."
"This brew poured an extremely invigorated head of long lasting finely sized white bubbles with an excellent lacing and a cloudy wheat yellow colored body. It has a very mild malt-hop aroma and a flavor of fizzy banana clove and bread. It is a very smooth brew and hides its alcohol content well."
"The fruit comes alive on your tongue with agressive hops and carbonation. Very velvety on the tongue. Excellent finish. I enjoyed this one with a sharp cheddar and it was a nice combination. I can't wait to try this one on tap. Truly a special ale."
"I'm sorry, I know this is supposed to be a great beer but I just did not care for it too much. The head on the pour was too much for me to handle, out of control. At each taste it felt like the beer was turning to foam in my mouth. Because of that mouthfeel dropped. The taste was of a complex fruit sweetness that I did enjoy but nothing special. The balance was not there and the finish seemed too yeasty to me. Give me a Maudite any day over this."
"just perfect. worth every cent."
"Overall this is a great beer that I will never turn down. It is light, but at the same time full bodied. It is crisp and refreshing enough to drink on a hot summer day such as this, yet I could easily drink a couple of these on a frosty autumn night. I now join the ranks of true BAs."
"It is a subtle beer, but that can be a very nice thing, as it is here. Small bottle. Best before date of April, 2004."
"incredible drinkablitility light, yet strong. The flavor is balanced but the abv is high enough to have you singing by early early evening. This review is from notes. The nose is malty yet I can slightly smell the aromatic hops. The taste is sharp and yeasty , the prototytpical belgian strong ale, but witth hops to boot. The flavor is even and balanced yet strong enough to beat an average beer to a bloody pulp."
"Originally sampled on 12 October 2002. This review is from my notes. I was underwhelmed by this beer. Pours w/ a big frothy white head; opaque golden color; I really thought that this would be a Grand Cru style of beer. It really wasn't anything special. The taste didn't do much for me."
"This beer is really the epitome of Belgian triples. No wonder it's one of Belgiums biggest selling beers. So complex and yet so light and easy drinking at the same time. It's amazing this beer is 8.5% alcohol. It sneaks up on you slowly, but you'd never notice it while drinking it. An amazing beer."
"Nice looking golden ale with a head white as snow. Interesting aroma, like another rater said almost a buttery aroma. Very smooth and drinkable despite the unnoticable high abv. I've never had this one before but it reminds me of the Urthel I had recently. I also taste a blend of fruit but nothing leaping out at me. This ale gives me a very relaxing feeling and I can see why some have such an affinity for it."
"Served from 330 mL bottle. Color poured a pale yellow with a good amount of head. The smell was that of fruit, with a bit of alcohol to it. The taste is fairly dry, almost like brut champagne, and the alcohol is somewhat detectable, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, with hints of alcohol. As for drinkability, I could drink these as long as I could hold out :) I had heard many good things about Duvel, and having tried it I have to say I heartily agree! Along with its darker cousin Maredsous, this is certainly one of my favorite Belgians!"
"Cloudy in appearance yet bright, clean and crisp in taste. It has a strong and clear nose, sharp, yeasty with a very light citrus. A testament to brewing skill when a brew has an alcohol content this high and you aren't overwhelmed. Sneaks up on you, though."
"I had the Duvel in a 11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. Despite pouring it very slowly, there is still a good 2.5 fingers of fluffy head. The head dies down to about 1.5 fingers, but that's it. There is also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The color is a pale orange-yellow that is slightly cloudy. The smell is very fruity, mostly banana and citrus. It is very pleasant. The taste is a great blend of fruit, spices, and alcohol. It isn't overly sweet though, there is a good malt/hops balance. The beer has a great strong mouthfeel to it. The drinkability is just a little lower, because the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked, as in other stong ales."
"This brew poured an extremely large white foamy head. It left an excellent lacing on the sides of my mug. It was observed to have a yellow in body. It also had a cloudy appearance to it. It had a flavor of clove. This was a smooth tasting brew in my opinion."
"Pours a bubbly golden color, with a fluffy white almost creamy looking head. Fruit aroma is very present and can be smelled while pouring. The taste of Duvel is wonderful. Very fruity and hearty tasting, while being quite refreshing at the same time. ItÂs easy to forget that this brew is 8.5% abv. The power of this beer sneaks up on you. Banana flavor is very present here and very well balanced with the cloves and hops. So many flavors stand out, but none of them are too overpowering. Definitely one great Belgian beer, and a must try."
"Thanks, Rodney."
"On another note: after drinking about half my glass I was shocked to see that on the bottle it is labeled 8.5% - that sure doesn't seem to be an effect until its ""after-effect", so I say its sneaky head swimmingly delicious."
"A world classic. I can't add anything that hasn't already been said..."
"A classic brew. Every beer lover must try this one. It pours a deep, slightly hazy straw color with a voluminous, champagne-like, brilliant white head. The fruity ester and yeast smells are quite subtle and do not betray the treasure yet to come. Silky smooth, the ""Devil"" comes on in a wave of lightly sweet bready malt combined with a bit of banana and mildly spicy esters. There is no hint of alcohol taste despite the relatively high alcohol percentage (8.5%) making this one of the most aptly named brews around. Deceptively smooth and drinkable, this beer can unleash a stealth attack on your sobriety lest you take care with your pace."
"I liked this beer very much. It had a hoppy and malty sweet ""continental"" aroma. Fluffy white head and hazy golden liquid. The taste is amazing. Soft malt and bready yeast notes with a nice crisp hoppiness. finishes clean and refreshing. This is a strong beer that you could easily mistake for a beer of a more moderate alcohol content. Be careful!"
"Sampled from a 250ml bottle this legendary beer pours a very pale hazy golden hue, with a highly carbonated champagne like tawny white head. What a perfect pour with one of the most amazing head retentions I have seen, will have to credit this with the priming of the candied sugar. Brilliantly spiced aroma along with a thicket of musty maltiness and a decent amount of hopping. The mixture of malty sweetness, bready yeast notes, and striking bitterness equates to one of the most amazing beers in the world. The mouthfeel is a complex combination of fizzy carbonation and syrupy sweetness. If and when they begin to keg this stuff it is going to be the true end of the world. So, drinkable just imagine what it will be like on tap."
"Pours a golden color with large white head - Do not make my mistake and uncarefully pour it into a regular glass - it will foam all over the place. Pour it into the predescribed bowl-shaped glass. The aroma is fruity and very complex. The taste is very smooth and sweet with a lot of carbonation. It is slithgly dry, but sweet at the same time - I can't explain it well. This is a great beer and I would highly recommend it. The taste is one of a kind with a bit of spicyness about it. I love the taste, but I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a sitting because it seems like a very full bodied beer to me. Sorta fills me up."
"I've had this in Belgium in the smaller bottle, and I definitely thought the 750 mL to be drier and woodier. Very impressive and wonderful brew. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and grab one ASAP."
"Too bad I live in Iowa. Can't get it here. This is a top 10 beer for me."
"Pours a hazy golden color (like a cloudy pils), huge rocky white head, mostly lasting, sheets of lace. Aroma is fruity, banana, apple, some lemon, yeasty, and grassy - very ""fresh"" smelling. Flavor follows with apple in the forefront, lemon hiding out in the back a bit, ends dry and grassy. Body is full, very lively carbonation."
"Way too drinkable considering its completely invisible alcohol content. A seemingly moderate beer yet undeniably edible. Simple, elegant, but complex, plus one of the best glass designs. It started a revolution in Belgian brew styling and continues to be a true classic. The scion of its own style."
"pat"
"Truly a classic beer that is often immitated."
"There's not a whole lot to be said after 191 reviews, but what the hell? Why not? Great golden color with a storm-like swirl of carbonation from first sip to last. Thick, rocky head -- more or less sits atop the beer like a fluffy pillow. Very floral, spicy aroma. Fruity in the sense that many fruits -- melons, oranges, etc -- have a bitter rind and a sweet inside. This beer is more or less the same. Bitter and sweet. Very, very tasty and definitely not as hard to drink as the abv might suggest."
"If I had could only have one beer in my fridge for the rest of my life it would be this one. It's that good."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a thick, soapy and bubbly head, very active. The head will maintain throughout, and thin, sugary lacing will dominate the interior of the glass, very well formed. Initial aroma is huge - spices, hops, even some vanilla, cloves and fresh bread is noticed, the aroma seems to change somewhat throughout the duration, but is always quite pleasant. An initial combined taste of fresh fruity, sugary, bubble gum, spicy flavor is quite nice, with an immediate belly warmer feeling going on. The alcohol is noticed throughout, but does not seem to be overpowering. Very creamy and delicious throughout, crisp, malty and fizzy finish, leaves you begging for more. A sipping beer, take note though, this one will sneak up on you in a hurry, the Duvel feeling will last for quite some time! For $8.50 a 4 pack, a little over 2 smacks for a Duvel, a near steal, this is an awesome brew!"
"A definite must-try. Amazing."
""
"Hazy light golden color, almost yellow. Exceptional frothy white head, nice rings of lace. Aroma seems similar to almost every other Belgian or Belgian style I've tried. Ditto on the taste, I can't identify it but it's a spicy hoppiness. I know it's also the yeast, espescially with Duvel as I have heard they don't use spices. Spritzy mouthfeel, almost champagne like ( a drink I don't care for) 8% on or abouts but pretty drinkable for such strength. I've tried to get in to the genre but it's not easy for me. My apologies to lovers of Belgian ale's but I can take or leave them."
"Hazy, straw color with a thick white head. The aromas are medicinal, and fruity. The flavor is somewhat fruity; apples maybe? A sweet herbal flavor also comes through. This smooth, medium-full brew is easy drinking, finishing with a dryness that sticks with you. It has a strength that will easily sneak up on you."
"A real struggle to finish the bottle."
"Note: On 22-03-2005, I decided to drop Drinkability to 2.5 and Taste to 4.0 because I'm sort of tired of this beer and I don't think it should be in my top five. Not sure if it's just me or if the beer has changed."
"Hay not a bad beer, the yeast might turn some people off. Duvel has a some-what cloudy amber color, a thick head that lasts forever, the taste is a real mouthfull, malty,fruity,spicy,dry,and smooth. The AVB of 8.5% could make it a bit much for consumption of mass quantities."
"Must taste side by side with Hennepin someday, they are both champoins strong pale ales."
"A very good beer, but there are many other Belgian's that I feel are much better."
"Seems a bit overrated to me. Pours out very pale with way too much head and froth all over the place when I uncorked the undisturbed bottle. Quite sweet with the whole Belgium citrus/grain/spicy thing going for it. There are many better brews from Belgium that I enjoy more so I plan to stay away from this pricey monster of a beer. But my advise to BAs is to try it as most floks seem to like it."
"A strong Belgian golden ale doesn't get any better than this one. The color just shines thru the light and it is very drinkable , a true gem, with just the right amount of sweetness and a bit of hop balance. The foamy pour lets the beer breath and this beer truly is the Devil as the alcohol is not noticeable, until you stand up afer a few. If there is one beer tour to take in Belgium or anywhere it is the Moortgat brewery tour where Duvel and Maredsous are brewed and enjoyed."
"Overall, this is a decent beer: tasty, fresh. The alcohol doesn't really overpower the beer, but there's little complexity in the flavors to support it. I prefer Orval and Chimay... and La Trappe, come to think of it."
"The aroma is complex, overwhelming. Spice, fruit, oppressive maltiness. The taste then expands; intense fruit esters. Banana, pear, citric sourness;Â ruthlessly, at first, a rude, invading stampede, but then following with a finish that lingers long as it dissolves into exotic, florid memories. The dÃ©nouement is sophisticated, an ethereal stretch; it is the proper occasion for a taste of cheese, a nut, or a bit of fruity juxtaposition. It is also the time for intense thoughts, and for deep, rustling feelings."
"For a Belgian Ale, Duvel is one of my all time favoritesÂnot as sweet as most, and slightly hoppier. ItÂs also so amazingly elegant and well balanced. Even not being a big fan of this style, itÂs hard to find faults with DuvelÂ"
"The cork flew right out of my hand with a literally deafening pop sound. My right ear is still ringing and I think the neighbors called the police. This amazing beer pours a pale, hazy yellow with a huge white head that loves to hang out and tease you. I smell a very pleasant fruitiness, mostly lemon. The mouthfeel is very crisp from the high carbonation, but it's a most enjoyable carbonation. To simply state the complexity of taste: sweet, fruity, spicy(mostly on the finish), simply amazing. This beer defines what high drinkability is. 8.5% ABV? You would never have a clue of that high level without the label on the bottle stating it. Not to sound repetitive, but this beer can definitely be dangerous. I'm going to struggle to limit myself to one 750mL bottle."
"So good it's painful. This is a beer you don't ever want to stop drinking. One of the best qualities of this is the sound it makes when you pop the cap. The ""whooshing"" sound of the air escaping lasts twice as long as most beers and if you put your hand near it, you can feel that it's twice as powerful. It takes much longer than most beers to pour also because the head was so large. I once tried to take a sip of this straight out of the bottle, and was punished with a head that rushed out and foam went everywhere. I learned my lesson: A beer of this quality requires respect. As for the taste, a strong yeast flavor is the first thing I notice. A wonderful flavor of ripe fruit follows. Apricot, apple, peach, it's all there. It's got a slightly alcoholic finish which doesn't bother me in the least. It just serves as a reminder of the strength of this brew. The apperance could have been a little darker, and the mouthfeel a little thicker, but other than that, It's pretty close to perfection. If you haven't tried this yet, you need to right now."
"Hazy golden lemon color and a formidable head (even after a gentle pour) with the consistency and color of stiff egg whites. Persistent carbonation adds to the attraction of this pretty pour. Smell is very pleasant though a tad weaker than one might expect given the ""action"" of this beer. Clean malty grains and yeast with some spice on the edges. A really wonderful, interesting taste. The easiest aspect of the taste to pick out is the yeasty, bready finish. Sweet grains start it out, giving way to noticeable carbonation and an astringent warmth and finally the afore-mentioned finish. Mouthfeel is clean and pleasant--the flavors linger without coating the mouth. Given the strength of this ale, it has an ominously drinkable character."
"First thing you notice is that if foams alot, you need to pour this up easily. The color is golden with a misty touch from yeast sediments. Imho the smell is nothing special... It tastes great though, it's bready taste that sticks around for a while with a citrus tone. If you are sensitive you might taste a little alcohol."
"Cloudy yellow color with a mammoth and lasting head. Very minimal lacing. Sweet, bready aroma. Very tingly on the tongue, and the flavor was not overly complex. I tasted citrus (lemon mainly), vanilla, a little alcohol, and some yeast. Very smooth finish makes this beer quite drinkable. Very good Belgian."
"While I don't buy into the Belgian ideal that every beer deserves its own glass, there's something satisfying about pouring Duvel into its glass and letting the head almost overflow taking up half the glass. It's a beautiful glass of beer."
"My favorite beer (hence the nickname). A much copied style (and copied very well by many), this stands out even amongst the great competition. There is just a little something extra-tangy in the taste that I haven't experienced, even after trying many of the greatest Belgian ales (my favorite style). The appearance and taste are legendary. Huge, lemon meringue looking head, fruity, spicy taste. Unbelievable drinkability for such a potent beer! I'm sure these strong ales aren't for everybody, but every beer lover should give this a try. As for you Belgian beer fans, try it head to head against the ""competition"". Somehow, the Duvel is totally unique. Enjoy!!"
"Phoosh, off goes the cap with a blast. Pouring it slowly was not enough to tame this wild head. The head literally GROWS before your eyes, forming a peak of meringue so thick, you can float a half dollar on it. The beer itself is highly carbonated. It actually formed whirlpools of spiral bubbles in my glass. The color is crystal clear straw golden. Aroma is typical Weihenstephan Weizen yeast, with that banana/clove tang. Pretty typical in the aroma department. The taste is also pretty typical bavarian wheat, but with a warming punch of alcohol. No lambic aroma or taste. Has a sweetness in the back of the throat for the finish, and not much for hop flavor. Fumes of alcohol warm the nostrils after a hearty gulp. Aside from the wonderful head, I don't know why this beer earns such stellar reviews. It may be a Belgian-style strong pale ale, but it tastes like a typical bavarian wheat, and not even a good one at that. In my opinion, it tastes like a ""DoppleWeizen"". I had a hard time finishing just one bottle, and would not buy another in the future."
"Amazing mountainous head and a wonderfully integrated pepper/citrus/alcohol aroma. It has a good citrus/ alcohol flavor with a creamy medium/light body. Slight pleasant after taste reminds you of how good the last drink was and invites you back for another drink and before you know it the whole 1.5 liter bottle is gone. This beer is too quaffable (not a bad thing)."
"Slight pleasant after taste and rewarding...."
"Pours a clear straw color until the last drops of the yeast fall into suspention then the beer turns a hazy which is quite pleasing. The citrus fruit fills the nose with hop overtones that are lovely. I wonder if they use candi sugar like homebrewers do to get the high alcohol content. The alcohol is not over powering for being 8.5% abv. I now see why this beer is number 3 on top ten list."
"I had a bottle of this for my New Year's stash, and it was a pretty good choice, because it actually reminded me of champagne in some ways. The beer is golden with the thickest head I've ever dealt with, there were icebergs of foam. The lacing was thick and pervasive. The beer had a cloudy, mucky appearence as well, with lines of bubbles dragging up the sides. The smell is of fruits and alcohol in my book, even here I notice some champagne-like characteristics. The taste again was fruity, with currant, and alcohol kicks involved. The mouthfeel is good and the beer brings to mind the word effervescent. Overall a good beer."
"The Duvel is probably my least favorite beer from this fine Belgian brewery. The hoppiness is excellent but he finish is rough. It is also lacking in body. I prefer a more rich beer like the meredsous 10 or 8. This is still drinkable but I won't be stocking it in my fridge on a regular basis."
"but if you can't get it in the white label the black is great as well"
"Nice cloudy golden straw color. Beautiful white frothy head that never quits, but leaves a delicate lace as you drink. Hoppy citrus aroma dominates the nose. Smells clean. Tastes as refreshing as it looks. Highly carbonated, well balanced, very drinkable. I'm glad I have 3 more in the cellar."
"Backwash: Often someone on the forum asks which beer would you drink if it were your âdesert islandâ beer. Well, I canât think of a better one: refreshing, complex, satisfying, and devilishly drinkable. Appropriate in almost every circumstance. Iâve seen a novelty item, which enclosed a cigarette and match in a glass tube, marked âbreak glass in case of emergency.â Well, this is the beer I would want in that (bigger) tube."
"It started as I seen the bottle, it was the only one left sitting on the counter as it seemed it was destined for me to cherish for the night. As I poured I was curious as one of the most noticable details was the foamy top that reminded me of such south american beers I had before. It poured a rich golden blonde with a sweet aroma and luscious fruity essence that was one of the main attractions I had hoped for. The taste was rather clean and crisp with a warm spice of after taste. The ABV of 8.5% was cleary masked in the flavor though it later help in keeping warm. This is a keeper, if you have a chance to spot the black label give this a try."
"A delicate, white, bubbly, rocky head sits a top a body of hazy golden liquid. The head remained throughout consumption. Carbonation present. Aroma consists of Saaz hops and a pleasant fruit (slight citrus or pear) scent. Touch of alcohol in aroma can be noticed as the ale warms. The crispness from the carbontation dominates the mouthfeel. The taste is exquisite. Some citrus flavor and pepper in midtones. Excellent balance to hop bitterness. Dry finish. Warming effect noticed as it goes down. Very drinkable for having an 8.5% abv content."
"Overall, astounding."
"Slightly hazy, golden straw colored beer that pours with white, piloowy head that seems to stay perched atop the beer forever. Very fine bubbles of carbonation can be seen trailing up through the liquid. The lacing this beer leaves on the glass leaves no doubt why the call it ""belgian lace"". The aroma is unmistakably Saaz hops, with some similarities to Pilsner Urquell. However, this beer has much more going on in the nose. An overall sweetness, with some fruity pear notes dominate the aroma. The taste is fantastic. At first, it doesn't seem like much is going on, but then the flavors start developing. None of the tastes are stronger than the others, as this is a beautifully balanced beer. Alcohol notes of sweetness are present immediately, but just a hint. Then a light peppery citrus flavor appears, only to be replaced by a spicy bitterness. Then some sweetness reappears, but it's different than the initial sweetness. The finish is clean but yet flavorful. The mouthfeel is very good, but the carbonation seems a little strong as it tickles the back of my throat. For 8.5% ABV, this beer is amazingly drinkable. the alcohol is present in sweetness only, and that nice warming feeling your throat gets as you swallow the beer. I could easily make drinking this beer a regular occurence. Truly an exceptional beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy beautiful golden color with perhaps the most magnificent head I have ever seen on a beerÂthick, rocky, and creamy white that you can have billowing out of the top of your glass with no spillage. It also has an outstanding retention and laces the sides of your glass as the head eventually dissipates. Nose is clean and fruity with notes of citrus, sweet malts, pepper, and spice. A light fruitiness of orange and lemon come through in the taste upfront with a nice blend of sweet malts and bitter and spicy hops. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a very nice carbonation. This is one of the finest beers on the planet. Simply delicious."
"I'm not as into belgians as some here at BA, but this one wowed me. Awesome appearance with a slightly hazed yellowish hue and one massive white rocky head that lasted longer than Duracell batteries. The aromas were a bit strange at first with a slight skunky twang to the aromas, but after letting it sit for a while, nice fruity esters and spices with a slight hint of yeast in the background revealed themselves. The taste was out of this world with nicely blending of yet again, fruity twang, spices, and light yet not sticky yeast and alcohol on the tail. It has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel and it leaves you wanting more. Simply amazing! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Pours a golden colour topped by a huge nice head. The aroma of this beer is a bit spicy with hints of malt. Flavor is malty and spicy. Mouthfeel is quite strong due to carbonation and don't forget that the alcohol level is 8.5%. One the finest strong pale ales of Belgium."
"This beer poured a pale straw color and formed an amazing foamy-sudsy head like a float that left circular lace. A beautiful heavy carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, citrus and spice. A flavor of malt, citrus and spices with a mouthfeel quite tangy, but not overpowering brought on by the heavy carbonation and the citrus elements. Truely a great find with the new Ohio law change. Also good review for my 500th Karma level."
"Letting the yeast in with the pour gives an extra amber/ orange haze: go ahead, drink the yeast, it's good for you! Flavor floods the tongue, Saaz hops jitterbug along the taste buds, and the finish will not quit the mouth. Overwhelmingly pleasant! Head settles some, but remains as a 1/2"" ring. Excellent with the Thai ginger & curry noodles I'm having. The flavor, the spark, the spice, it all lingers on and on. Is there any greater delight? Do five stars mean anything at all if they are not applied to a brew so fine and lovely?"
"Golden in colour, large white head. Nicely hopped nose. This beer goes down like a champagne, well carbonated, with a dry finish. A nice balance of hops and an alcohol kick that is hidden in the wonderful mouthfeel of this classic. be careful, this one will sneak up on you!"
"11.2 fluid oz. bottle best before 4/04 served right out of the refrigerator.  Poured very slowly as recommed by the bottle and fellow BA'ers.  I got a fizzy carbonation like a seltzer.  Aroma reminds me of cider.  First impressions of taste indicate dry flavor with a hint of spiciness.  Fizzy carbonation leaves light impression in mouth.  High alcohol kicks in by stealth - deceptively drinkable."
"Note: this beer was #4 in Stuart Kallen's ""The 50 Greatest Beers in the World"".   Hard to argue with that one !"
"In Omaha four-packs run $12.00, however in Kansas City they run $8.00, a good buy!"
"If Trappist beers are indeed Godly, then this is definitely the Devils Beer."
"Pours pale gold with a massive crown of stiff white foam. The foam fades unevenly, leaving peaks and crags. It actually looks fairly dry and sticky. I had expected the body to be cloudy from yeast, but it was clear. The yeast was firmly attached to the bottom and I had not left any beer in the bottle to swirl with thinking that enough yeast would come out that I wouldn't have too since I wasn't wanting a lot of yeast in the beer. The aroma was typical spiciness of the style, with a little of the spicy noble hops (saaz) complimenting the yeast spice. Lemon and a faint sweetness were also present. Duvel seems a bit maltier than other belgian strong pales. Besides the malt and typical yeasty flavors, there was a very faint hint of vanilla and cantaloupe melon. There was also a very faint cheese flavor in the finish. The flavor leaves the palate quickly and is rather dry. I was expecting more spice from this beer, but it's actually quite balanced (possibly because the yeast was stuck in the bottle)."
"A wonderful beer that i can never get enough of."
"The taste is nice and peppery, with hints of apple cider and clove in there as well. Finishes abruptly. However, I wasn't quite as impressed, overall, as most of the other reviewers have been. I even purchased the proper Duval glass the second time around (which I love), to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I mean it's a very good beer and I'll certainly never turn one down, but I'm much more impressed by La Fin du Monde, which seems all lot more complex. Bottom line is Duval is definetly a must try for every BA."
"Pours absolutely beautiful: hazy pale-golden color with a creamy-chunky head that leaves woderful lace. The aroma is fruity and sweet, some yeast, and spicy notes.  Light to medim body with a soft, smooth mouthfeel - carbonation works nicely.  Full, rich flavor with a malt-candylike sweetness. Next comes some bitterness and spiciness. A lemon rind-like taste pulls it all together with great balance. great either chilled or after warming a bit. Alcohol stays hidden, making it very easy to drink. A temptation from the Devil. A -class beer!!"
"When poured slowly into a Duvel glass, this beer is beautifully presented.  Half of the glass is filled with the pale golden elixir, which is only slightly hazy since I left about 2cm in the bottle to keep the yeast out.  This is topped off with a huge, rocky, pure white head that leaves a generous amount of lace, yet stays very well.  A steady stream of bubbles rises from the very bottom of the glass, helping the head's wonderful staying power.  Spicy aroma of pepper and fruit esters, along with some malt presence in the background.  On the palate, delicate yet spicy pepper tickles at the tongue, creating a tingly yet smooth mouthfeel.  Slightly fruity sweetness is the major player here, and goes perfectly with the spiciness.  Very slight hop character shows itself in a rind-like bitterness around the middle and in the finish.  The finish is otherwise sweet, but is dominated by the aforementioned hop bitterness.  The high alcohol content is not at all noticeable, making this dangerously drinkable!  This is a god among beers, truly a masterpiece and worthy of its high esteem.  One of the wonders of the beer world."
"A fruity sweet (pear/apple) nose leads to a sweet, malty, fruit estery (banana, green apple, pear, pineapple? clove?) flavor with a wonderfully mouth-filling character. The finish is remarkably like a granny smith apple dipped in malt. Vastly drinkable for its strength."
"The pour produces a stupendous white, foamy head, heaps of lace. The beer is straw in color, clear, with a splendiferous nose, citrus, bubble gum, malt, hints of ripe pineapple, ""Quite Sniffable"". Front is malt, sweet, the top light, the finish acerbic, dry, sparingly hopped. A good beer, but I will take an ""Orval"" over this beer anytime. Ranks #494 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"This beer poured perfectly clear until the end of the bottle when the yeast was roused. A perfect decant was not possible as the head was literally rising out of the glass! Hazy yellow-gold body with an orange-cast topped by a dense, rocky bright-white head that holds extremely well - buoyed by a tight-beaded effervescent carbonation - and leaves some exceptional lace . The aroma is quite fragrant: fruity, yeasty, candy sweet and malty, lightly peppery with a touch of spicy hops. The body is light/medium with an extremely fine and highly effervescent carbonation that is pillowy soft and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended."
"A classic in every right. An intricately crafted, perfectly-balanced, golden yellow champagne of a beer under a lacy mountain of foam that dances perilously close to an avalanche when poured. With sweet fruit and spice, this beer packs a warm alcoholic kick in the arse without a threatening taste or mouthfeel. Smooth and beautiful."
"Taste is champagne-like.  Slightly yeast with.  Spicy hop flavor with a medium-light malt body.  Somewhat dry finish -- very smooth.  Quite a nice beer, and very drinkable in spite of the alcohol."
"This classic pours with the ""patented"" massive and huge pillowy white rocky head. Slightly hazy liquid gold with vigorous carbonation in the glass. Nose is crisp, fresh hops, clean maltiness with a hint of pears evident. Taste is also crisp, slightly acidic and hoppy...very lively, with light-bodied maltiness to mellow things out a bit. Finishes long, dry and bitter. A classic, easy-to-drink golden ale...the 8% alcohol is hardly noticable, imbiber beware!"
"One of the greats. A slightly cloudy, yellow brew with a rocky, perfectly white head. Banana and cloves in the nose, very nice. The spice in the beer, which comes out first, was accentuated by the carbonation. Next came the alcohol along with the hops, slightly bitter and warming, followed by the malt. The only aftertaste is a little tartness and vanilla. This is one of the beers that started my love affair with the nectar of the gods, or in this case, the devil."
"Pours into the goblet with a heavy frothy white head.  The head sticks around for the whole trip.  The very pale golden color is enhanced by the thin ascending bubble trails that permeate the brew.  The very fragrant aroma has scents of Belgian yeast and lemon with hints of alcohol.  The bold flavor is tart with a strong yeast character and a huge alcoholic warming quality.  This beer beats out any good wine I have tried.  A very tasty libation with a kick and a half."
"Poured slowly as suggested on the bottle.  Looked like water as poured, but noted the fizzy sound.  Huge head that settled very slowly with big bubbles.  Later much laciness on the glass.  Aroma changed over time.  Initially light malt with fruitiness and spice that turned to clove.  Pale yellow color and clear. Taste has complexity.  Starts off light, moves to spiciness (cloves and some fruitiness) with malt, then a shot of alcohol (that stays to the finish), and concludes with mild lingering somewhat bitter dryness.  Thinner mouthfeel and despite the huge head the carbonation while evident doesn't seem excessive (yet there is some experience of fullness).  Very interesting beer.  Seems worthy of its higher ranking amongst all beers.  I will try this again."
"You have to watch out... this beer is quite strong, but doesn't taste like it is.  It'll sneak up on you if your not careful (as I can attest.)"
"For some reason, I just can not get as hyped as a lot of beer lovers do over Belgians.  Maybe there is an anti-belgian beer chromosone in my family's gene pool (as my brother ZAP feels the same way about Belgians)."
"Probably one of the best beers in the world, this foamy, golden Belgian Ale is meticulously crafted and not allowed to leave the brewery until ready. The distinctive large white head and the mouth-watering smell of spices on the nose rewards the drinker with a burst of spice on the tongue that one will never forget. Again, the drinkability does not belie the fact that it is a high gravity brew, so be prepared to savor the experience responsibly."
"the devil finally caught up with me, and i sold my soul.  bright pale with a huge frothy head.  the massive carbonation made it very easy to inhale the fruit and spice in the nose.  very bubbly/prickly on the tongue, like a sparkling wine.  a  much lighter body than i expected.  the unique taste of the fruity yeast and pale malts makes for a moderately spicy, delicious brew.  the hop bitterness gets twisted up in the carbonation, and lingers on the tongue.  the 8.5 abv is lost in all the sweet, spritzy, effervescent action.  way too refreshing for so much alcohol, so be careful.  the only drawback i could find is the way the carbonation gets in the way of deciphering flavors on the tongue, making for an odd mouthfeel (the bubbles just dance in my mouth!).  nonetheless, a great brew worthy of the hype.  i think the devil is telling me to go buy more...."
"You never forget your first...Belgian.  And what a winner this one is.  It is smooth, drinkable, and has a very fruitful aroma.  With a slight bit of hoppiness and a good ABV kick, this is one of the top brews in the world, bar none."
"There is some special yeast in store for you upon tasting.  You are enveloped in smooth yeasty richness.  The balence is helped along by hints of fruit and hop bitterness.  This beer is not for the timid, but at the same time it slides down effortlessly.  The look of this brew is hypnotic.  Why on the bottle would they tell you ""not to drink the yeast"" is beyond me!  Drink it.... drink it all!"
"rich and hearty with a slight hint of alcohol (they do a good job of hiding the 8.5%)"
"The taste was mild concidering the 8.5% alcohol. Not to tart and not over spicy. I find it not enjoyable at all for a Belguim Ale. This is my second time and I rated it less than the first time."
"Like most belgian ales more heavily carbonated than I appreciate, otherwise this is an excellent beer! Dangerously drinkable - hence the name."
"I found this beer to be quite pleasant, with a soothing aftertaste. Like drinking fine brandy or wine.  Dark reddish in color, with a moderate head. Spicy indeed, with somewhat floral tones.  Alcohol taste comes through, and makes for a nice finish.  Drink this one slow!!"
"It's a nice looking beer with a big white head.  It's got a pretty good spicy smell and a somewhat sweet taste with spicy undertones.  I found the flavor and smell of alcohol to be surprisingly high for 8.5%.  It seems less noticeable in other Belgians with a higher alcohol content."
"Even if you don't like Belgians or appreciate the style, if you love beer (I do!) you cannot help but exclaim that this is one of the world's truly brilliant concoctions.   Flavour, flavour , flavour, aroma, aroma, aroma, head, head, head and finish, finish, finish....without question one of the world's most perfect brews!"
"A skeptic no longer! From the sheer beauty as it rest's to the citrusy spice nose. From the blend of slight sweetness to a tart bite and finally bitter, but a clean sort of bitter, as if the carbonation had swept the bitterness away. Yes it's lively, for sure, full lively not harsh lively. Nary a hint of alcohol. I am possessed! Duvel; how can you be so bubbly and so smooth? Duvel; I love you!"
"Duvel is legendary...the name, and especially its appearance. Beautiful thick Belgian head, and a strong yeasty smell. Extremely strong stuff that will knock you on your ass if you have too many. Too spicy and yeasty to drink many of them anyway, but great to get that big bottle every now and then to enjoy a truly renowned beer."
"In many ways, this beer sets the standard for Belgian strong ales. Golden, bubbly, spicy, intoxicating brew! I love this beer. However, if given a choice between this and a beer such as Victory's Golden Monkey or Unibroue's Don de Dieu, the latter beers will win. Hopefully, I will never be in a situation where I will have to choose one over the other!"
"Where are those crazy monks who brew this stuff? I want to party with those guys.  Duvel is a very fine beer. Is it my favorite Belgium?  No, but it is good.  Hints of fruit in the taste and nice, warming alcohol presence."
"A second bottle-fermentation, so charged up, foamy medium-bubbled head, misty champagne color and bubbly upcharge. Astringent aroma with a malt background. Light vinous flavors and swallows with a lot of carbonation. There's a slight hoppy cut to the initial flavor and in the mid-mouth feel. There's a lot of sparkling wine-like flavor. It is interesting. A modern classic, finely brewed -- but not for my normal tastes. Tart and bready at the same time. But I found it to have a higher than expected drinkability. This brew is beautiful in a Duvel glass, there's that central geyser of carbonation charging up from the center and a head as rocky as a bowl of popcorn"
"After a long time I finally tried this out.  Let me tell you I was not disappointed.  I must admit, Belgian style beers are not my all time fav, but I do enjoy them, and this one in particular.  It poured out a nice light yellow color, reminiscent of champagne.  A light pillowy head formed at the top and appeared almost meringue-like but not super creamy.  The aroma was light and spicey with some subdued yeast.  Had a pleasantly light, citrus and spice flavor with a light alcoholic echo in the background, almost unnoticeable.  Nice effervescence, dry,slight yeast, and nice warming after effect.  Slightly bitter aftertaste, but nice.  Great Belgian!"
"Absolutely beautiful beer.  Hazy, golden yellow with a classic dense thick white head.  A full inch and a quarter over the rim of the glass without any spill.  Duvel has a very pronounced, fruity aroma, lemons and pears.  The first bottle I had, I did not realize that there was some yeast in the bottle (although I love the yeast).  The beer is very refreshing, and very fruity.  Somewhat dry finish, very pleasant.  For a beer with this amount of alcohol, I do not get the alcohol warmth from other high octane beers.Looks great, smells good, very drinkable, but to me it misses the essence of a good beer.  Great for its style, but it ainât my style.  Addendum:  more than a slight hangover the next morning."
"My initial impression is that this beer is overrated. That said, it's still pretty good. I am unclear on the delineation between a tripel and this style; no matter. Prolific frothy head, very pale; vaguely reminiscent of Aying's Jahrhundert although milkier and lacking the lager characteristics. Also a hidden spice but this is very subtle. It is an unseasonably hot and humid day today, and this seems to be affecting the beer in positive ways. It is crisper, more refreshing. This is the 3rd bottle of a 4 pack and the most enjoyable so far. The first 2 (and this one, to a lesser extent) had vague euro-skunky characteristics, much like Heineken. Expiration date is 5/04 so that can't be it. I wonder if this is a slightly off batch since I've recently had Victory Golden Monkey and Unibroue Eau Benite, and greatly prefer them both to this world-class, top-rated brew."
"This is what the style is all about, strong but easy to drink. With its sweet, fruity, spicy flavors, wonderful head and high Belgian level of carbonation makes for one perfect package."
"I never would tire of this. Recommended to the fullest"
"I have finally found one of the nectars of the Gods! Duvel is fabulous. From it's cloudy apperance to it's peppery spice taste this brew is dangerous to drink. At 8.5% it will rock your world in a hurry."
"With a spritzy mouthfeel, Duvel is deceivingly light, but has a myriad of flavors.  It's got a bit of alcohol warmth and a nice touch of clove in the finish.  Duvel's a wonderfully complex beer, is one of my very favorite Belgian beers, and is WAY too drinkable for the alcohol content.  Be sure to try this one in the 11 ounce bottle-- I had several of the large bottles flat."
"Its good, but perhaps a bit overrated, great appearnce, nice flavour, bitter finish, all good things, but just lacked something."
"-Duvel Beligian Ale-Nice fogged, hazy, peach color. Fruity & complex but very balanced... Very fine brew! Don't drink to many, 8.5 abv. will make you see double. Price for a case around Philly will leave you crying & asking were is all my money! It's between $45-50 a case!"
"Extremely carbonated (quite a spectacle), head froths so easily and endures long long after initial pour.  Super pale yellow, almost white.  Mellow spices on the nose, a typical belgian scent.  Initial shock comes when the razor sharp bittersweetness hits your tongue, follows through with a spicey almost hot notes.  The flavor penetrates deep into the palate, leaving a long aftertaste.  A sharp tangy crisp mouthfeel.  Would be quite the summer refresher beer, despite the 8.5% ABV.  Always wanted to try this infamous brew, was worth $9 for the four-pack."
"Giant rocky white head that lasts forever and laces the obligatory Belgian Chalice. Fruity malt in the nose followed by a deceptively smooth taste for the alcohol content. Spicy malt followed by a long dryish hop finish. Lovely to watch the champagne like bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass as I savor this first class Belgian."
"This beer deserves its place in history.  Just the right mix of hops and sweetness for a crisp, clean flavor that somehow hides its devilish alcohol content."
"What can I possibly say? This is a world classic, one of the greatest beers brewed, bar none. You've got to drink this one in the proper glass if you want to contain the massive head. Fruity and complex in a clean, delicate way. More than 750 ml and I'm down for the count."
"Outstanding brew. Remarkable fruity flavor imparted by the yeast. I prefer to let this warm a bit and let some of the carbonation dissipate before drinking."
"Nice and peppery.  So smooth and mild, I can't believe it has an abv of 8.5%.  Wait, what's that buzzing sound I hear?  I guess I can believe it."
"I reviwed this a year ago and felt tit was time for an update.  Poured into the glass with a big rocky and creamy head.  Clear- doesn't look strong.  Spicey smell- almost like wine.  Taste is smooth and crisp, but dry.  Some flowery taste as well.  So drinkable, it's scary."
"Tastes like heaven, smacks you around like hell. could you ask for more?"
"One of the best beers on the face of the Earth. Bow down to this god of beers."
