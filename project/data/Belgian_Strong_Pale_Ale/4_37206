4.03,3.6,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Color is a amber, orange, red, and copper mixture with a little bit of clearness.  Pours a two finger bubby head.  Aroma has a lot of bright fruit and a sweet and dry malt.  Lots of that dry, bright fruity taste upfront which transitions to a slightly tart/dry cracker finish.  Lots of carbonation in this and medium in body.  Overall, if the price tag of $20 bucks wasn't so ridiculous I'd definitely get this again.  Nice fruity red grape flavors balanced by a dry and slighty tart finish.  Definitely worth a try even for those who don't like fruitier beer since its so balanced.","CTbrew32","Dec 08, 2014"

Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, rose-tinged copper coloring with a bubbly, frothy, off-white head that sits a consistent half an inch on the surface. Aromas of semisweet fruity notes, like a Blush or Rose wine. Some subtle spice highlights, as well. Subtle nose. Flavors are well blended, with a rich, tangy sweet grape profile. Highlights of earth and wood throughout, with a tartness that underlies it all. The carbonation and crisp body keep this brew light in mouth while you drink. Slightly boozy berry and grape aftertaste, with hints of clove and all spice. The beer has an effervescent, slightly dry finish. Tasty brew, and surprisingly easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","May 24, 2013"

Aroma is deep and musty, includes green apple, green grapes and some candy sugar. Taste follows the aromas pretty closely, no alcohol on tasting or in aroma. This beer has aged incredibly gracefully.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2009 bottling. A bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours very cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with very good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grape, apple, pear, biscuit, clove, pepper, grape skin, herbal, earth, honey, caramel, and yeast spiciness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of apple, pear, grape, herbal, pepper, biscuit, clove, earth, honey, grape skin, caramel, and yeast spiciness. Slight grape skin tang on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, bread, honey, earth, herbal, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and flavor complexity; with no cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong pale ale. Fairly unique flavor profile with great balance and flavor complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jul 28, 2012"

In the flavor, the wine grapes are still there along with some peppery Belgian yeast. Certainly Belgian ale yeast, lending its subtle fruity complexities that really shine through and play off the grapes. Mild tartness that has mellowed out to just a notion.

This bottle is somewhat of a chore to drink alone, but the sweetness and sourness of the grapes is really quite pleasant, and as it warms, the crispness of the pilsner/pale malt backbone makes up for the increased alcohol burn.

Flavor is quite sweet up front with a bit of bitterness in the back. And under it all is a general Belgian style strong amber ale. Body is quite soft and mouth filling; carbonation isn't enough to handle the sweetness. Maybe a good dessert beer.

3.87,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"On tap this past Saturday night at the Dive Bar in Worcester. Served in a 0.25l Allagash glass for $6. Dull orange color, with a hint of forest green in the body. Fizzy white head. Smelled like a glass of wine - fresh and a bit boozy. Taste was quite different and unique. There was a lot of grape flavor to this beer. The brewer really got a lot of the flavor out of the barrel and into the beer. I have had a few beers aged in wine barrels, and this one was one of the best examples. Mouthfeel fell somewhere between a dark ale and a wine: easy to drink, but a sipper. A small glass was all I needed for this beer, it was an appropriate amount. A great beer to try if searching for something new, or a nice crossover beer for wine lovers.","morebeergood","Apr 19, 2010"

The aroma was of Belgian yeast, alcohol, a touch of Chardonnay grapes and some fruit esters. The flavors were similar, but I wasn't thrilled. Bready malt, dark fruit, a light spiciness from the yeast, and the punch of booze. Dry, acidic and tannic, reminiscent of a brut champagne. Interesting, but it lacked finesse. The mouthfeel was a good, the carbonation high and the body medium. It was ok, but it was expensive to purchase and for the same dollar I'd rather have something (or a couple somethings) else.","thekevlarkid","Jan 16, 2009"

The smell was of red grapes (a sort of Welch's grape juice aroma, but not as sugary sweet). The taste was similar. I didn't enjoy it too much. There wasn't much bitterness to speak of. The middle mouthfeel was the worst part about it: too much grape sweetness.","gameface23","Dec 12, 2008"

Malty flavour up front, quite fruity, grape and raisin, similar to the aroma but a little less vinous. Nicely balanced with flavours really melding, a bit of toffee sweetness held things together.

The taste is again of white grapes, honey, a hint of pepper and grain, ending with some bittering hops. The feel is moderate with fairly soft carbonation, the finish starts off slick but ends up dry.

I don't like this as much as any of the Russian River wine barrel aged beers or DFH Red and White, but it has some similar characteristics. Pours a beautiful golden with a very nice finely bubbled white head that sticks around as a cap and some spotty lacing. Smells of coriander with a touch of clove, tart grapes that are somewhat subtle, but contribute a pronounced sweet-tartness, and a touch of pepper. The taste is similar, quite tart with a lot of coriander and a bit of pepper. Perhaps a few too many grapes for me here. Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing, but again the tartness is foremost.

Grape flavors and rich, smooth maltiness soon take the lead, well balanced by refreshing hop bitterness. Very much unlike most beers of this style--to my taste, like a cross between a triple and a bière de garde. Unlike the former, there's more thick malt and candy sugar flavors, and unlike the latter, more crisp tartness. Excellent offering though, as always, from the folks at Allagash.","poetaster","Jan 22, 2008"

Quite fruity aroma that conveys a juicy feeling along with the phenols that are typical to the style. It also has an element that is caramel-sweet and somehow winey at the same time -- the aroma reminds me a bit of a gewurztraminer without the spice. On the palate, tangy and sweet from start to finish, with bright, full fruitiness (oranges) from the mid-palate onward. Active, slightly solvent finish of raw alcohol. Overall, this is very well done. This is seemingly a very sweet beer, although I would not be surprised if it's just the fruitiness of it fooling my brain. I would be very curious to try a version of this beer without grapes added -- as it is, it just tastes like a well executed, fruity Belgian ale without any overtly winey or grapey characteristics. Well done.","geexploitation","Jan 04, 2008"

On the negative side, I felt this beer, while complex, lacked the focus that makes the great Belgian beers great. Something to try, but doubt I will grab another...","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Nov 24, 2007"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a warm orange amber color with shallow wispy off white head that struggles and settles to the surface nicely. Visibly effervescent, a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of this St. Feuillien goblet generating intense surface pools of foam that leave textbook spotty patterns of Belgian lacing . The smell is aggressive. There is an undeniable presence of the alcohol at first over a tart yet sweet fruity fragrance and an almost balanced earthy malt and yeasty aroma (this bottle indicates 9% ABV vs the 10.40% indicated on this page) . Well carbonated without being 'fizzy', the signature tiny bubbles of this Belgian Strong Ale give the mouth feel a really wonderful creamy texture. The first sample is notably 'warming'. The alcohol is neither timid nor distracting. Full flavored, the creamy tartness of the mouth and classic fruity taste from this Belgian yeast finishes with a pleasant, almost dry sensation. This one is a keeper. While the ""dark"" piece of this is understated, the complexity is well worth considering. Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Nov 15, 2007"
