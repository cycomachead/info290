"Beautiful slightly milky yellow. Thin small head. Nice tight knit lace left on glass I am not getting much hop aroma -some is there but nothing like a dry hopped American pale ale. Hop aroma balances well with malt aroma and fruit background. Light sour smells also. It all blends together well. Contrasting broad flavor palette. Hop bitterness definitively present. Fruit, light citrus, yeast tastes. Reminds me somewhat of a good American champagne re  yeast, acid, fruit balance. Bret character is well balanced. smooth mouthfeel. After swallowing I'm left with bitterness on the sides of my tongue, minor sourness, and the smooth mouthfeel. Very interesting beer. Opening  up as it warms. Others have said tart - yes that's it, not sour but tart."
"Wow what a tasty brew. Spices remind me of a nice chai tea, really really pleasant. Wish the price point was more reasonable."
"Aroma is light fruit, some apples and pears but a  stronger element of white grapes. The follow-on scent is a mildly sour, funky  aroma that is distinct from the usual Strong Pale Ale presence.  Flavor is very good. The fruit malt and yeast up front are strong, slightly sweet and very tasty. The sourness and funk are  fairly mild, but an interesting change of pace from the standard BSPA flavor. The  transition is seamless and the funk in no way diminishes  the traditional flavor.  Mouthfeel is rich, alcohol presence is minimal, and the variety off flavors is just right on the tongue.  An excellent brew!!!!!"

"A friend shared a bottle. Mildly tart, refreshing. A nice beer, but given Allagash's usual price points, nothing I would purchase."

"On tap at beachwood Seal Beach poured into a tulip. Golden yellow haze with tall white head and spotty lacing. Aroma is funky, pear, wine, honey, and some spice. Flavor was tart pear/cherry, grassy and earthy bitterness, a touch of grain sweetness. Light bodied, silky texture, med-high prickly carbonation, dry finish."
"Beautiful. Spicy, floral, fruity, mildly sweet. So in balance. Amazing nose, too."
"Comes out of the tap a dark honey golden with a thick, fine-bubbled, cream-color head that sticks around for a while and leaves generous lacing. Crisp aroma has a strong overtone of apple, rather like a cider. Lip-smacking flavor has a malty core and a strong, slightly sweet, slightly tart apple overtone and a whisper of butterscotch. Firm texture has a good amount of tingle and fizz, leaving a nice fruity and tart finish."

"O: would have liked less banana from the yeast and more citrus and apricot/peach; the dry finish was interesting;"
"Pours a golden color with a white head and good clarity.  The aroma is sweet and fruity, with an earthy, almost spicy phenolic yeast element.  The taste borders on tart with notes of citrus, green grape, honey, lavender, and white pepper.  Finishes clean and even, semi dry.  This is a very drinkable ale, hard to do a review on because it was gone so quick."

"The intensely fine Brettanomyces driven carbonation gives the body an airy, moussey fee. Very refreshing and very drinkable. l"

"O: Very good bretted notes brings a slight gentle sourness that perfectly complements the brew. Carbo is spot on too, lending to that creamy initial hit."

"A very interesting Belgian ale, similar to Matilda from Goose Island. Can't really recommend over the latter due to the price premium, but it's got a killer aroma and great flavor."
""

"O: Really interesting beer. Has hints of farmhouse, but also hints of standard Belgian ale. The farmhouse characters are the dominant, with the brett aromas and flavors clear and forward. Interesting. If you like farmhouse, this is for you."

"Overall, felt this beer is very flavorful, but I found the flavors to be ephemeral - nothing lasted long and it seemed to change. There's nothing definitive in the flavor - there's a lot of different components that almost seem to conflict, but the flavors change. Very interesting and thought-provoking brew."

"Brassy in color with an off-white head and thin lacing left behind. Has an obvious brett nose with a little spice mixed in. Tastes of orange peel, white grape, a bit of grain and hint of salt at the end. Medium in body with well-hidden alcohol. Well-balanced and flavorful all the way through."

"This beer is between gold and straw in color, with a haze similar to a hefeweizen. The aroma is a tropical fruit and peppery spice. There is a passion fruit flavor with a subtle brett flavor of old socks (but old socks that taste good). I have definitely had several beers where the brett is a little overpowering, but this beer had a nice blend of fruity notes from the yeast and sweetness from the malt that works well with the brett. I really enjoyed it because all the flavors work really well together."

"The beer pours a very strong and foamy clean white head. The head lasts a while and the lacing on the glass form a perfect ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a clear yellowish copper. The beer smell is fairly complex with a hint of tartiness. The smell has bits of a bread smell from the malts. The tarty Brett smell is there as well and is slightly obscured by the white wine smell as well as the hops. The hops are fairly close to a slightly grassy smell and orangey smell. The white grapes smell makes it difficult to properly distinguish. The beer taste is different from the smell. The beer taste is primarily hops mixed with the Brett. The malts make an appearance as a backbone for the taste and balances out the hops and Brett. In addition to the hops, the beer also has a white wine taste to it with hints of citrus orange. The feels is fairly clean and goes down similar to water. The finish is fairly dry. Overall, a pretty good beer and one that I might get again."

"Great silly mouthfeel on this beer. However, the taste with its bold yeast strains is just a little too funky for me. It does start to mellow as it warms, but it's still a little wild for my liking. Which is a bit of a shame since I really like Allagash a lot. I may try this again since it did seem to almost grow on me as time went on. Still an excellent brewery that I want to continue exploring new beers with."

"Forget champagne. For those special celebrations, reach for Confluence Ale instead. Its added earthen complexity makes for a greater culinary experience without sacrificing the bubbles, body or bounce."

""
""

"Overall a very tasty beer that could have a touch less funk and a bit more complexity"

"TL;DR: the smell is fantastic, the taste is confused, the mouthfeel is super, super, super dry. overall, the beer needs to age to be worth your cash."

"Nice fruity Brett in the nose as well as some nice hop character. Def best fresh or with a couple years on it. Let the dry hops die out a little and the Brett take over more and increase complexity. Pours nice with a decent head. Interludes dry hopped cousin if you will."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, golden color. Very much like a Belgian ale, with a clean, white, three-finger head. Smells like a dubbel almost - has that fruity, Belgian smell to it. Taste is like a mixture of 25% sour and 75% dubbel. There's a tiny, tiny hint of sour. But the beer is very light, has a very nice lacing on the glass as you drink it down. Very reminiscent of a dubbel, with the fruit taste. Very enjoyable beer - will definitely have again."

"Overall: The only reason I pulled the trigger on this one is that Total Wine knocked the price down to $12 for a bomber. Which is fair IMO--not sure if it's worth having at $19.99. Either way, it's a well crafted beer and I would like to try other offerings from Allagash."
""
""
"O: Exceptionally clean and crisp, the craftsmenship is in the smooth and well toned flavor."
""
"Pretty good wild ale, but not complex enough really to warrant the high price tag on the bottles. Luckily the price per ounce on a growler fill was half that of the bottles so a worthwhile purchase to try something new."

"O: pretty average beer overall. Drinkability is high, but at the price of $20 per 750ml bottle, skip it."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in January 2009 (pushing 4 years old). Cork blew off as soon as I untwisted the cork, no beer was lost to gushing. Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge tart apple, lemon zest, orange, pear, strawberry, hay, grass, barnyard funk, earth, herbal, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange zest, hay, grass, earth, herbal, pepper, funk, and light yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, citrus, grass, hay, pepper, funk, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale with brett added! Awesome flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. An incredibly enjoyable offering."

"Hazy golden-yellow color under a small, white head. Delightful sour, funky brett aroma: cherry, tart fruit, citris acidity, faint sugar cookie malt. Tart flavor, not so funky as the smell. Dry citrus rind, pepper, and fruit. Medium bodied, smooth, lightly carbonated. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Nice to find this on tap. I tend to overlook Allagash a lot because I have a hard time dropping $20 on a bottle."
""
""
"Nice brett/funk aromas, slight sweetness of malts. Taste of sweet grapevine malts, some mild funk and slight noble hop. Its super smooth and east drinker and a great intro into wild beers. Overall, good solid wild ale."
""
"M: Very carbed. Between light and medium."
"O- I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. I guess being a wild from Allagash and being highly recommended from the bar tender I was expecting a lot more. To me the beer felt like a slightly lemony Triple that they tried to sour a little bit. There wasn't much tartness and the tartness that was there I felt just didn't fit in the beer very well. I probably wouldn't order this again, but I could maybe see how some people might like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a very nice beer and another solid wild from Allagash. Not a sour beer at all, but some light funk and a ton of oranges and brett. Very easy to drink and something I would certainly recommend if you like brett. I will certainly be having it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Respectable sour, somewhat complex, but it needs something to give the malt some character. It's fleeting as it is. A fruity tone or malt flavor would make this more than a stage for something else."
"I had high hope for this beer and with the smell I was expecting something more fruity in taste. The taste was overwhelmed by must (I do suppose it's a wild ale...) and I wasn't a big fan. Very nice finish though. Maybe worth checking out but not blowing my mind."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a vase, the beer is a light, pale, lemon-yellow coloring with a sparse coating of white film. Aromas of white grape and cherry, semisweet and a bit sour. Flavors are subtle and lightly sour, with the grape flavors holding the palate. Similar to a pinot gris, but fuller bodied and carbonated. The aftertaste is light, and slightly filmy. Clean, crisp aftertaste. Very easy to drink, and very refreshing."

"O/D-Didi not know what to expect from this beer and I was definitely surprised. I enjoyed it but did not love it. It was worth a try but I was left a bit disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy splotches of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, and some light sour/tart lemon-like aromas. Taste is very much the same but there is also a yeast flavor that I am getting as well. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it's a very mild sour all around."
""
""
"O- A great brew, nice and funky and refreshing, very drinkable, very well balanced, and very nicley done, this would be awesome on a warm summer evening, love it."
""
"2012 just as good, from bottle at brewery tasting room. Brett, funky, house yeast. Cloudy blonde with large head (and I didn't pour!) A little marmalade taste."
""
""
""
""
"(750ml bottle - Mar. 2011 edition)"
"O: Very approachable and very drinkable - this would be a great introductory beer for someone that had no prior experience with brett. Very sessionable and a regular beer for me (I think I have consumed like four 750 ml bottles in the last six months)"
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. The sourness is a nice complement but does not overpower the other aromas or flavors."
""
""
"Refreshing and could easily replace champagne as a celebratory beverage. Regardless of the occasion, Confluence works well as a before dinner drink and I can imagine relaxing with it on a hot afternoon."

"Bring on the funk! Hazed-over yellow color, ample frothing. Smells of eucalyptus, lavender, green peppercorn, orange blossom, honey, ripe pears and a hint of white wine. Impeccable smoothness, nearly silky. Dry malt backbone lends more of a dried grass flavor. Mild tartness from the house Brett strain used; dried fruit and wild medicinal herbs run- ning wild all over the palate. Phenolic herbal flavor is pretty bitter—sure, there are some hops in there as well. Nearly bone-dry finish with lots of lingering complexities. Funk-o-licious!"
""
"Overall: The first problem is that this is built using the Saison style as a base, which is not my favorite beer. Even so, Oro de Calabaza and Fantôme Saison are much more enjoyable. This is just a mediocre attempt at a wild. Maybe more time would improve it, or maybe it is better in the bottle, but I was not impressed. If the goal is to create a mild wild, they have succeeded."
""
""
""
"Confluence has a bright gold going into hay yellow color to it with a sparse amount of loose white bubbles, not creamy in looks and no streaks. Smell is grassy with some light fruit, pear, a nice whiff of minir bugs, brett. Some flower essense becoming pungent over time. Taste comes off with alot of refined brett with spicy Belgian yeast with some bitterness on the end. Not all that sour, I could not say this is even tart, more like a saison with brett in taste and feel. Confluence has a mediumish feel with active bubbles off the tap. This has a lot going for it taste wise but it aint all that wild. I would/could drink a bunch of this but at $25 a bottle i'll pass. Glad it's off the spout."
"Poured into a tulip glass a clear golden yellow. A fluff of white head was visible at the tap, but my glass was filled to the brim, so there was really no room for a head of any kind. Light aroma, grassy, flowery, with tones of light fruits: pear, peach, white grapes. The taste follows the smell, with a light fruitiness--pear, peach, white grapes, apple skin--not too thick or overbearing, grassy with a touch of funk, and hints of spicy yeast. Light mouthfeel, pretty dry in the finish, and quite drinkable overall, but not overly flavorful, and I do like my wild ale to be loaded with flavor. But this is still a nice selection, and lesser on the sour side for those who don't like sour beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - its an alright wild ale. bit more of an in your face taste and cooling down the carbonation a tad and this would be a superb beer."
""
"The beer is different and perhaps I don't have a true appreciation for bret."
"Overall this is a great beer. Easy drinking and approachable sour. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not overly impressed with this beer but it does have session quality. There aren't any flavors or taste notes that really stand out"
"This pours a very cloudy, hazy, dull orangish yellow with a billowing two finger, whispy head. It is softly sour on the nose. You get some funk, brett, lemon notes, tangerine, and spicy Belgian yeasts. It has a really, really nice and approachable nose. The flavors too could be described as soft. You get a lighter bodied Belgian spice all around with a slightly dry finish. The brett is there but it's not overbearing. It's a lot lighter in body than I imagined. It somewhat hurts the flavor profile since it abbreviates the flavor with a quick finish. It just takes away from the beer as a whole really. That is why overall I'd say it's just ok. If you were just getting into wilds I'd say it's a nice place to start but this won't thrill anyone who really enjoys the style."

"Definitely well made beer. A great sourish fruitiness with a dry malt flavor and an edge of bitterness. I would recommend this as a good start in exploring beers beyond the usual styles."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall a good beer. Taste was a bit of a letdown after the nose, but still good."
"This is a nice wild ale, but it definitely didn't blow me away. I guess it's balance is a detriment? Definitely well crafted and enjoyable. A very good beer."
"O- a great Belgian-style ale. The sourness is mellow and adds complexity without detracting from drinkability."
"D- Pretty great wild beer. I'd think even non sour beer fans would enjoy this. The smell was amazing, that said the flavor is a bit light. Worth checking out at least once though."
"haven't really had anything else like it. cheers"
"Overall a great American Wild Ale, and the dry hopping is a real nice touch that makes this one better than average. Not sure about the price though - nearly $25. a bottle seems a bit steep. We're starting to go beyond the cost of a bottle of Cantillon - let's be real here!"
"March2011 Allagash Confluence. 7.4% dry hopped brett belgian. Pours a golden haze with an almost champagne like fizz, building into a tall, fluffy, fortuitous head, the like of which I may have never seen such in the way of the cumulus nimbus. A dense lace coats the glass throughout the session. A floral, slightly citrusy boquet trumpets the aroma with hints of spicy phenols. At this point, the beverage is an impecable belgian offering. Wading through the foam, dryness and crispness arrive and last through the sip, with a floral and lightly pungent mid-body that is briefly noted and requires another sip. And many more. The dryness combined with the bite of carbonation leave a disappointing finish, but with the desire to taste again so as to experience the medley again. Overall, the hopped flavor melds seamlessly with an almost invisible brett tart. While a tad too dry, this is an otherwise perfect beer."
"Sampled at Julio's Belgian Beer Festival on August 14, 2011. They were pouring the 2011 batch. The color is olive-yellow with a fizzy, bubbly head. The aroma is very memorable and distinctive as it marries together the Allagash Belgian House yeast and some wild yeast, which emits a flowery, piney, earthy combination. The body is light but delicate. Lots of zesty, acidic fruits in the taste such as lemon, apple, and pear. Very interesting and worth trying."
"D: This was a nice wild ale with great scent, but relatively bland taste. The body was nice, and the finish was smooth, so it was very easy to drink. I wish the taste matched the scent, but instead it ended up being somewhat boring and forgettable. I doube age would improve, but it maybe bring out more brett character. Not worth the price fresh."
"notes of tart grape skins, cherries and loads of funk, some light spiciness and a decent touch of oak. lots of dark fruit, tart funkiness and a nice earthy, woodsy like smell blending together very nicely on this one. Silk like smoothness, and the finest carbonation bubbles, really well done in that regard. ;ots of sour in here right up front with frapes and light lemon like citrus taking over. Rolling through some nice notes of cherry then came over me. Decent funkiness in through the middle and the finish, but it was actually almost blended out by a cherry like sweetness and more hints at a sugary touch."
"O: I would drink this over and over- really an amazing beer. Gets better with age and the brett on this really lends great flavors. A+"
"O: This is wonderful; it shares many similarities with Orval."
"O: Decent brew, the brett adds some complexity but the base brew could be better."
"I like this bottle more than I remember. It's very complex and drinkable. It's an excellent Belgian style golden ale or whatever you call it. I figure it would pair well with pasta too."
"Poured clear golden color with a large frothy off-white head that was lasting with excellent lacing. Moderate brett, woody and tart citrus aroma. Medium body with a smooth dry texture and lively carbonation. Medium to heavy sour & sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sour & sweet finish of moderate to long duration. My expectations where met with a standout change of pace brew."
"This wild ale poured out as a slightly hazy golden color. The head was solid looking and had plenty of retention. The lacing was a little sticky but doesn't really coat the glass too much. The smell of the beer had a generous amount of funk on the nose, not the most appealing of smell in my opinion. The taste a little bit of a tart flavor to it but it's actually not too bad. The other flavors are a little floral with just a touch of yeast in there too. The mouthfeel is light and fairly drinkable. Overall this beer is pretty good for the style. I would probably drink this one again."
"Notes: Maybe not the utterly complex and extraordinary brew that some expected me to believe but this is quite a rich brett driven brew. Complex enough and top quality, just a bit short of that hyped complexity. Maybe I expected something slightly different of a wild ale, this felt like a nicely hopped saison with brett. In fact, it reminded me a bit of Boulevards´s Saison Brett, which I find better rounded. I would recommend this one, although under this pricing… Allagash labels this as a Dry Hopped Golden Ale and it feels better suited under that framing."
"(750ml bottle from Rayl101)Pours a cloudy yellow-orange color with a white head. Active carbonation. Aroma is funky, ripe peach, citrus peel. This is absolutely heavenly! Taste is sweet with some sour and a touch of bitterness. Nicely balanced. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is dry. This is a very good beer and I would search it out again."
"Perfect in (almost) every way."
"I have a bottle of this chillin at the pad, I hope it develops better than what I had on tap. I guess I'll have to search for the flavors that are supposed to be there, because I didn't find them the first time around."
"Yeah, I'm a fan of that. It drinks like a conventional beer, but there's a whole lot of weird idiosyncracies going on as well. Love it."
"Pours a hazed golden straw color, minimal spotty head, little lacing. Scent is muted barnyard funk from the brett, a light fruityness, bready, lightly spiced. Tasted was much more mild then expected, muddy earth, damp wood, barnyward, lightly metallic, the fruityness is replaced by a more savory taste, backbone is quite belgian with bready malts and yeast, light spicing. Lighter side of medium bodied, aggressive carbonation doesnt help mild palate. A very muted flavor profile allows the Belgian base to shine through, not a favorite."
"Sigh. It doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's not a good Belgian style ale, and it's not a good American Wild, it just sits in the void between the two. Again, I'm not particularly impressed. I expect more from Allagash, and from American Wilds in general."
"Another on tap at Memphis Taproom,part of the no repeat beer week. Poured into a tulip a very hazy lighter golden color with a wimzy white heading that didn't stick around to long. The brett is not to powerful here in the nose or on the palate. Light crisp malty notes with lighter fruits dominate mostly.Just a dash of brett to give it that barnyard appeal. Very refreshing."
"(D)- A decent wild ale, though very straightforward; the Brett has really taken this over and made it its own. Not worth the price point. When compared to Interlude, I far prefer Interlude."
"Narrative: Walter Chiu always had a sneaking suspicion that he wasn’t born in South Side Jamaica Queens. It was nothing that he could overtly point to, but, a substantiated hunch was enough. Sure, everyone told him he was Queens native, what with his transposed L’s and R’s, his affinity for Texas Instrument Products, and encyclopedic knowledge of MMO lore, yet, somehow he looked askance at their appraisals. “Wait wait wait, mom tell me again, as a child I used to play the 5 string bass incessantly? I don’t even know how to play the bass?” “Oh yes sweetie, we couldn’t stop playing that Sly and the Family Stone record you were so fond of. Those were the days.” He watched his mother carefully slice the uni into diaphanous strips but still rubbed his weak chin at the prospect that he was an avid fan of Thelonius Monk."
"O: Overall, happy to have tried it. It definitely was refreshing but not really my style of wild ale. Also just wasn't tart or funky enough for my taste."
"Overall: This was quite different. I really enjoyed the lemon notes. Good balance and very crisp."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and tingly on the tongue. Drinks really well, tasty sour profile although more tart than completely puckering. I would definitely drink this again."
"The beer was delicious though. The brett showed great pineapple, tropical fruit flavors and a little funk but limited amounts of phenols, which can sometimes be off-putting. The hopping was perfect to provide some grounding and balance to the beer. The carbonation was a little low but pleasant with the fruity, brett-ed beer. Tasty, but better presentation might help this beer score better."
"Overall - A very good choice to pair with the speck (smoked German bacon) and rye toast I was eating. Will have to hunt down more of this and age it again, this time, for longer. Definitely recommended as a special occasion brew."
"O: This stuff was solid and quite refreshing. I was lucky to get a 12oz pour for just $3 and at that price point, it's fantastic. However, it's not something I'd drop $17+ on a 750. It's great and refreshing, but it isn't THAT good. For a reasonable price, this stuff is great and worth it."
"It starts off with a fruity sweetness and borderline-syrupy body that's kept on the right side of the line by spot-on carbonation. The bubbles spew some of those bretty notes at you, which you get up front, along with some grape and apple tastes. The wildness doesn't come until the end, but brings a perfect drying taste with which it finishes. Very balanced and not too abrasive."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall: The hops in a sour beer add an interesting dimension, though I prefer my wild ales to be a little more straightforward"
"Toasted and well carbonated melba toast and cut grass are upfront. Malted barely with bread toast and spring fruits and a splash of tartness. I would not think this is an American wild ale by taste alone. Still a good beer worth trying and sharing."
"I wouldnt buy this again. Its pretty tanic and acidic. There is nearly no carbonation and that doesnt help."
"A very well made tasty brew. Dry fruit flavors, spicy yeast flavors with a dash of funk. I am surprised I waited this long to open this bad boy."
"Light yellow, with a dense white head forming disk, this looks good.. Nose has mostly Brett with light sourness rather Orval-like. Clove, bandaid, lots of clove and light honey. Palate is similar. Biscuit, honey, band-aid and clove. No hops, light floral honey-like sweetness. Drying and Bretty on the finish, the carbonation is very, very high. A little watery, but great otherwise. Solid stuff."
"D: really not my style of wild ale with too much brett that masked most of the other flavors but was drinking good though."
"Pours clear golden yellow with tons of carbonation. Thick, fluffy white foam that persists. Great lacing. Fruity green apple aroma, sweet and spicy with a bit of funk. The flavor is very funky with lots of barn-yard notes, but at the same time it is a light, airy flavor. Somewhat sour but a nice malty sweetness balances it out a bit. Silky, carbonated mouthfeel with medium body."
"If it's between this and interlude, get interlude..."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"A good beer but not one I would buy again. I received this as part of a BIF but I understand the price tag is high."
"Highly drinkable refreshing creation. Love the citrus tart bite in this beer. similar to Fantome's tartness but with a different flavor profile. Highly recommend this beer."
"The feel of this beer is so complex there really is no way of take it all in this late in the night. It has it's own way of light the night and it works so well for this night."
"January 2009 Vintage. Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a hazy deep yellow with a four finger massively fluffy off-white head that actually bulged up larger and larger in the middle of the glass but very very slowly subsided to one finger with lots of sitting. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour funk, and subtle fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall there were some very interesting notes going on in this one. I really had mixed feelings on it. In my opinion there was just too much 'funk' in this one and not enough sour/tart going on. Good, but just not all that awe-inspiring. Interlude is still my favorite offering in this category from Allagash."
"Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, somewhat sweet, tart, and finishes dry. Such a superb beer. I have to order this online again. If you have not tried this beer, you really should."
"Pours a rocky three finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a very good lace. Hazy light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Belgian yeast nose. Flavor is tart fruit and yeast. Earthy. Bottled Feb 2010. $18.99 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D: Solid American Wild, very balanced with keeping in tact the basic malt and hop base and building on it with the sourness and Brett funk. Very complex and smooth."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being above average. Drinkability is good, it had a lot of great flavors to it and a nice complexity as well. All the flavors melded very well and it seemed very balanced for a wild ale. A very nice beer overall."
"The mouthfeel is really something. It's strongly carbonated and is really lively on the tongue. Then it dries up quickly. Overall it's a nice beer, but i was expecting some more complex and assertive flavors."
"D: Delicious and refreshing with just the right amount of funk and earthy fruity flavors. A year has done well for this beer."
"Bottle, 2010 version. Pours a very clear golden color with a coastered white head . Wow, holy Brett notes in the nose with the addition of subtle Belgian notes. Grassy, medicinal, and barnyardy all in one. Malty subtle sweetness with a very Brett underlying taste. Floral aftertaste. Light mouthfeel. Some medicinal type flavors as well. Not bad but if you aren't a big Brett fan they this may not be the beer for you."
"D: Having had NG R&D Golden Ale recently (and at nearly 1/2 the cost per mL) I much prefer that. The high carbonation and phenol/ester character with plastic-y notes I do not appreciate."
"This is a very well balanced beer, maybe too balanced? Its easy to drink no doubt and far from boring; it just lacks a k.o. punch!"
"Confluence pours just a shade or two darker than gold, and quite clear. It's got an impressive foamy white head on it, especially seeing the condition I've seen most of the beers served in tonight. Lacing is also above average. All that pageantry just led to a letdown when I first leaned in for a smell. It had the aroma of a watered down Allagash Blonde, with just the faintest hint of brett. Where's my funk? The taste brings more balance between the malty sweetness (with a little more earthiness along with the fruitiness of Blonde) and the brettanomyces. I can find just a hint of the black pepper I've been getting from their house yeast strain all night as well. The pieces are in place, but the flavor doesn't really stand out overall, and it could stand to be pushed even a little bit further towards the funk. Best carbonation on any of the Allagash brews I've had tonight though, very nice and lively. Even for a Wild, Confluence seems just a tad watery, but I'm really just splitting hairs at this point. The restrained brett influence (albeit too restrained imo) and the solid execution on Confluence support a nicely flavored beer and make it solidly drinkable. Probably my favorite brew of the night."
"D- Easy to drink. I could probably enjoy an entire bomber for myself and not think twice. This beer is great, make sure you try this one yourself. Without a doubt, I'd do it again."
"On a side note, this is my first review posted from my new Android phone... Not convenient at this point... Going back to laptop/PC-based ticking."
"D - I know damn well this is a good beer but what happened with this pour? Bad batch? A mispour? Something happened here that just wasnt good. Such a shame too."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a very slightly hazy golden with a very nice tightly beaded head and some excellent lacing. I love the aroma. Very fruity with mango, apricot, melon, and a touch of lime. This fruit is underpinned by a gentle funk that has a characteristic of overripe fruit rather than horseblanket or barnyard. This would probably change substantially with some age. The taste has more apricot up front than in the nose, and here there is also a bit of ripe cheese funkiness, but just a touch. There is a drying note of lime, and some sharp but earthy hops, as well as some dry malt, and a crisp yeast profile. Some deep flavors here, with a dry finish. In the mouth its dry and crisp, but very earthy, and with a bit of fruity sweetness at the end. Very interesting beer, and quite nice right off the truck without any extra aging- not always true for an American sour."
"D - Delicious with a lower ABV (relatively) and very refreshing and crisp mouthfeel. I could definitely drink a couple of these 750ml bottles on a warm day sitting on a nice shaded porch."
"D Good due at least in part to interesting tastes, feel. 4.0"
"Grabbed this one in celebration of my buying my first home. A great brew, although not quite as outstanding as most of Allagash's ""big"" brews. This one was kind of your straightforward sour and tart flavors that you get in a Wild ""funky"" brew, with some fairly consistent yeast and milder hop flavors, with some occasional fruity orange/citrus. Again, not bad, but in no way as impressive as a lot of Allagash's, or even their comparable Interlude."
"Drinkability:This is a well balanced beer with brett flavors intact, but still mild enough that delicate floral flavors are still there."
"Man, really good beer. These folks know what they're doing. Poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, rocky, off-white head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear, slightly pale amber. Aroma is full and of yeast, barnyard, spice, hops, malt, fresh cut grass. Flavor is similar to nose and has a slightly sweet background upon which are the tart and bitter flavors are evidenced. Body is excellent - in the way that is best for this style, not too thick yet not thin with champagne-like carbonation. The finish is like flavor and where I notice the characteristics of the Brett which nicely complements the beer. Finish is fairly long. Satisfying, good drinking beer. I'd defy someone blindfolded to say this isn't Belgian. Kudos to Allagash brewmasters; a hearty well done!"
"Confluence Ale is an easy drinking Wild Ale, though it isn't quite seated in the upper-tier. Enjoyable, but for the price I'd be more inclined to check out Allagash's other beers before I drink this one again."
"Served in a flight with Oro de Calabaza and Ommegang Ommegeddon with grilled white shrimp with tomatillo-peach salsa"
"D: Wonderfully smooth and quaffable. Effortless."
"D - one fine summer sipper, incredibly refreshing though i wish there was just a bit more going on in the flavor department as after the nose it was a bit of a let down."
"D: Not my favorite wild ale, but certainly a different take on the style (read: not sour). A good fruitiness which I really enjoyed."
"D- This is an awesome beer. Certainly wild and funky. A good member of the miscellaneous pale belgian category-but slightly wilder. Reminds me of a saison. Another wonderful allagash brew."
"D- Really interesting beer; a great beer to sip on and enjoy all the interesting flavors going on."
"Overall pretty good, a little on the expensive side, very similar to La Roja or some other JP brews I thought with oak predominantly taking over."
"Wow! I had a glass of this as a part of tasting new beers at my local beer bar.. This one stood out from everything I tasted...and they were all belgians. It had a unique aroma, very refreshing while still being interesting. Flavor, again, great sourness without being difficult to drink. I can have numerous glasses of this beer."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but sort of run of the mill. The price, however, makes this a beer to avoid."
"D-pretty tasty brew here, nice balance with a hint of hops in the back and a nice brett presence with delicious peach in there."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a little heavier than most that I've had in the style but there's enough complexity and flavor to make worth drinking for a long time."
"D: Another great beer from Allagash... gotta love how they're always willing to go out there and push the envelope with their beers."
"The body was nice and mouth coating without being sticky. Drinkability was very nice, smooth and easy. Overall, very nice beer, but one that probably wasn't worth the $22 price tag."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable with an interesting, refreshing nature."
"The beer itself is not so sour. There is an odd citrus bitterness to it and some zest, only slightly citric based sourness and almost no lactic notes. Finishes cleanly...not my favorite sour but its OK as far as a beer goes."
"Very easy drinking if you like the tartness. Earthy, hay-like finish."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of dry Brett notes with a lightly sweet malt profile and some dry European style hops. Taste is quite refreshing with some clear Brett notes that are well balance with the lightly sweet malt backbone. Dry hops also provide some further enjoyment. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done and refreshing for the style."
"I haven't had too many wilds in my career, so I jumped a bit when I saw this guy on tap at ChurchKey. The pour goes just as I suspected, resulting in a somewhat hazy champagne gold; the head consists of a ring o' large bubbles that don't last the length of the drink. The nose is wild and fruity, with notes of white grapes, brett funk, and grapefruits. The taste is not all that different, spotlighting orange peels, bananas, cloves, a dry slap of bitter hops, and the skin of some mandarin oranges (I have no other way to describe that last one...took me almost ten minutes just to come up with that). Unfortunately for me, the more bitter aspects were what shined through, drowning out the more fruity, sour, wild notes. Overall, it tasted like biting into an orange, peel and all, just before the fruit is ripe. The body is light, with moderate carbonation (less than I expected, for some strange reason) and a rather dry finish. I gotta say I was underwhelmed with this beer; not disgusted or anything like that, but definitely disappointed."
"Taste:"
"Cheers!"
"City Beer Store, Allagash night. I had high hopes for this beer, and while it wasn't quite up to them, it was also quite different than what I expected, altogether. It's a mildly sour beer with an excellent pale grain flavor, oddly clean for the style. Otherwise, there's a floral quality and a big earthiness from the Belgian yeast, almost lightly smoky in a dry mushroomy kind of way. Mild, though definitely detectable, hops provide bits of herbaceous, minerals and grass in the finish. The flavor is quite dry. And the feel is mild, though good. Quite drinkable for the abv and for a sour. I'm aging a bottle to see if the sour notes come out more with time."
"D: Nice all around. Not the best AWA that I've had, but nice and a little bit different."
"D: Goes down very easily, tastes fantastic, nice kick - I would have a few glasses of this one!!!"
"F: very dry and gets quite a bit of bitterness from some spicy hops that seem to really shine through on the finish. More lingering dry earthy barnyard funk, spicy with a little warming booze."
"Hmmm...I wonder. This tastes a little young. Even though this beer is pre-aged before bottled and release, it could use some time for sure. It has the familiar Belgian yeast flavors a lot of Allagash's beers use. There's a watery blandness though that I just can't shake. Even though there's quite a bit going on, the Brett needs some time to mature and tarten up to compliment the sweet notes. A mild hop backbone pokes through. Resembles a pilsner with a small amount of brett...with a Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy! There is no issues with drinkability on this beer, thats for sure! Overall, it needs a little age...a little dissapointed, but not a bad beer by a long shot! A very solid beer for the Allagash lineup."
"D: What I fault this brew for in the mouthfeel department aids in its drinkability. Since Confluence is not a palate crusher, a few glasses in a sitting would not be out of the question."
"this quite a bit."
"Overall, this is a decent American wild, but with the other stuff that Russian River and Lost Abbey are cranking out, I'd probably pass on this one. However, I did get a taste of Allagash's Coolship with Cherries at NotB and that was very well done. So I know they can make good wilds."
"Extremely well-crafted and good overall. Very drinkable. Paid over $20 for this sucker and I'm glad it didn't end up being TOO much of a ripoff! Price points for Allagash do tend to run high to ridiculous though, and I end up passing on many of their beers for that reason."
"Consumed: 3/12/2010"
"Allagash is a wonderful brewery, producing some very tasty beers."
"Taste very sour and funky, really sharp and tart. It's got some real spicy funk, quite nice. Mouthfeel is light and smooth, easy to dink for beig so funky."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Quite a drinkable brew considering the heavy carbonation. Quite a tasty brew."
"Superbly drinkable, I like it a lot. I am quite impressed with Allagash's offerings that I've had - they show restraint and a deft hand which aids a high level of enjoyment and drinkability, something you don't always see in sours."
"Very heady upon the pour, had to let it sit, even with a gentle pour. A clovey, horse blankety smell. I had the interlude a month before and expected the nice sour belgian ale flavor. I got a funky, clovey, sour and sweet flavor. Some decent hop bitterness as well. The first few sips were a little too funky but as the bottle went on, it was a great flavor. My fiance liked it too and she's not a big sour/funk person. I figure it was a good balance. A fair ABV for the taste involved."
"Cheers"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Very drinkable, goes down easy, real nice funky complexity. Thanks Eric!"
"Overall, a solid example of an American Wild. If this was cheaper, I would consider drinking this more often, but for the price and the lengths I went to get it I don't think I'll be having it anytime soon. A great beer, just not one that I would go out of my way to get again. Thanks Kevin for this great beer!"
"Out of a bomber this beer was a hazy, golden-orange color with two fingers of billowing head. The retention was good and the lacing good too. The aroma was complex and a little queer, leafy/grassy notes, sweet fruits (apples and pears) as well as the must of wild yeast. The flavors were similar with a strong emphasis on the Brettanomyces. The alcohol punch was also quite distinct but the fruit and must helped to conceal it. Earthiness and a good malt backbone helped to balance it all. Some lemon-like citrus notes appeared as it warmed up and the finish was dry and clean but a little awkward. The body was medium and the mouthfeel was pretty good but the carbonation remained pretty high throughout the whole sampling."
"As you might imagine, it's an easy drinker for saison aficionados. Unfortunately, I am drinking this straight up - it would excel with many food pairings, I'd imagine. Mushroom risotto? Smoked salmon? Mussels? Clams? It's an overall pleasure to drink, and to review. Yes, it is a little pricey, but saison lovers should pull the trigger on this at least once."
"D - Pretty good overall. I enjoyed this at the Allagash brewery, and then again on a summer afternoon, outside, with a couple good stinky cheeses. Something about the earthiness of this beer lends itself to being enjoyed outdoors."
"The beer smells really funky and sour, strongly similar to the nose of Orval, tart brett throughout. The taste isn't quite bracingly sour, but lives just about on that edge. Barnyard flavors (horseblanket, mustiness, etc) that hit the spot for me, also a light citrus in the bitter aftertaste, maybe not too far from lemons. Very good and easy to quaff. I love what Allagash does with wild ales, I just wish it were cheaper (along the lines of Jolly Pumpkin). Then again, Lost Abbey charges twice as much, so this may be a relatively pricey luxury for the foreseeable future."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this allagash offering. This beer was well done. I am very impressed and it is very drinkable. This would be something I would definitely pick more up of."
"D: Pretty solid, but there's room for improvement. The brett is a bit too dominant, and the mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated, but otherwise, quite nice."
"Poured an explosive cloudy copper with a head that takes a while to settle. Earthy aroma replete with brett and fruit. White apples, pear, and citrus zest mixed with Belgian yeast. Funky. Both in the nose and taste. Yet, the funk is the pleasant variety that enhances the sweetness of the underlying brew. More apples and now a vinuous quality pop up. Pleasant trippel-like spice and body. Wouldn't really call this a sour beer, as it is more earthy and fruity than anything else. Nice."
"d: Great beer, thanks joepais. This reminded me of their collaboration with De Proef. A joy to drink, even my wife liked this one."
"I have had up to two pours of this brew and I say that was my limit do to the punch it packs. I have grown to like this beer and will drink it again"
"M/D - Light, crisp and a very well carbonated. Very lively in the mouth. Very easy drinking as well."
"D- meh, one of the more boring members of the american wild family that comes with a high price tag. i probably wont be checking out the other bottle of this i have for a very long time. once again, it reminds me very much of a saison."
"Drinkability: Decent, I expected a better beer than this though, with more sour and funk. This one has too much influence from their trippel, although many of their beers suffer that fate (can't say I blame them though, stick to what works!). I hope they keep working on this as I know they can do better!"
"Drinkability? No interference from the alcohol at all and very tasty...this is a very easy drinking brew. Yet another well made beer from the gang at Allagash!"
"This beer smells horrible in a way that some of the world's best cheeses smell horrible. In the same way that I wouldn't condemn a cheese for smelling bad, I am not going to damage my rating of this beer for having an unpleasant nose. Confluence is a work of art in a liquid format. Beautiful mix of sweet, sour and spice... I wish it was easier to find and I wish I could get some kegs to tap at my place (i'd even be happy with some bottles). Just amazing."
"D: This was very different than most wild ales you come across, it reminded me of a mix of Orval and Interlude in some ways. This beer is still heavily Belgian-influenced with a hint of America."
"D- Very good, my taster disappeared way too fast."
"Semi cloudy, yellowy amber, with a sparkling near white head that trails fine and scattered lacing. Fruity nose, with lemon and pinapple on the old sniffer. Very dry brew, with more citric fruits and a moderatly sour mid section and finish. Certaintly tasty, subtle, complex and interesting. Tasty brew, if it was not so expensive in bottles, I'd like to age a few and enjoy a few others. Another BA worthy effort and a quality achievement in brewing from Allagash's brewers"
"I've met a handful of people who are a little baffled by this beer, but I encourage you to not be afraid. It is like a painting which seems ludicrous at first, but in which you find numerous meanings and nuances with additional viewings. Fantastically original brew."
"Pours a deep yellow/light amber in color. Huge pop on the cork, bursting with carbonation. The gentlest pour gave the biggest head. Smells musty, and a dry-hopped aroma. I've not smelt a wild ale that smelled so hopped. Very dry, and the hops stood out at first, but over time, the other flavors came to the forefront. Dry ephervescence prevails, some citrus, apricot, light fruit. Fairly sticky on the tongue, but even for a wild, not the easiest drink. A very slow sipper, decent, but for the cost, there are better available."
"Mouthfeel is tingly and smooth, and a little dry in the finish. The complexity left me looking how to characterize the flavors. The beer was perfect for a summer evening. It is incredibly multi-faceted. Tons going on and a great drinking experience!"
"This drinks very easily - a nice funkyish brew."
"Head is a thick white that does not dissipate. There is grapefruit and spice with something soapy/funky with an underlying fruit that I can't really identify. It is drinkable but not in large quantities - I think the flavor I'm getting is banana and cloves. This is an interesting brew."
"This beer remains stubbornly effervescent until the end of the bottle; this works quite well with this quaffable-beyond-its-alcohol beer. I like the balance in the flavor between the spicy fermentation notes, the fruit, the pale malt and the fresh hop character that this brew has. At times the zesty hop character really comes through quite well; this must have been quite a bit more hoppy when freshly released. It is eminently quaffable with just enough Brettanomyces influence to keep my interest piqued throughout. Definitely a wonderful effort and I like that the Allagash house Brett strain has run rough-shod over the rest of the beer (though that can be nice at times too). I wish I had a couple more bottles of this to age."
"Definitely unique, but not one I'll run out for for $18. Keep up the good work though, Allagash."
"Overall: An average to above-average AWA. Cheers!"
"upon tasting, the sweetness is largely relegated to the finish. plenty of acidic wildness. the yeast character comes across perhaps as spicy? white pepper? a good amount of funk, certainly, but it's a little different of an experience that my most recent wild brews. the flavor profile is perhaps not as dynamic as the aroma suggested it might be: sweetness seems to have taken a far more distant role than it did in the bouquet. dryish, actually, which turns out to be OK, though it lacks backbone to a minimal degree"
"Overall, this tasted more like a saison than a wild ale to me. Even compared to most saisons, this falls short on many levels. Not really impressed with this offering from Allagash."
"D: This one doesn't taste like 7+%. The heat and funk make me instinctively reach for another sip."
"D-Nice, a mildly tart fruit bowl. Not overly complex and seems to be lacking something. Glad I was able to get this on tap and not pay $20+ for a bottle. It's nice but not that nice."
"This beer all over and rather than complexity it comes through as muddled confusion. Granted, this was a birthday present but I saw it for $22 at some stores. Confluence is ok, but it's not $22 ok."
"Drinkability is hit by the weird herbal nature of this one that just kind of gets out of hand for me."
"ok, allagash - we all know you just snuck in some of de proef's yeast here, perhaps from your collaboration with them... admit it! ;-)"
"On-tap at Raleigh Times served in a tulip glass a hazy straw yellow with a decent frothy layer that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is loads of sour citrus and decent spice. The taste is a decent amount od sour citrus and slight malt with decent spicing. The beer is fairly light with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Wild Ale."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Herbal hoppiness and astringent husky grain, bit of green apple. Phenolic, yeasty, mildly funky but more rubbery than anything. The crisp, dry texture is nice, but that's unfortunately the only nice aspect of this beer. More mediocre overpriced beer from Allagash, woohoo."
"D: This is complex drink that seems evolve with each sip. I could easily see killing a bomber of this by myself."
"Smelled wonderful, slighty sour - kinda like a cider. Nicely carbonated. Paired up really well with the seafood i had. Not overpowering in flavor with an good balance of sour and hops. This was my first wild ale and i really liked and will drink it again"
"HV"
"Overall this is a decent brew. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to the high hopes I had for it. I love most Allagash brews, and I love everything wild and sour that I can get my hands on, but this one falls a little flat on both fronts. I wouldn't normally mention the price/value of a beer, but these big Allagash brews can run a pretty penny and I almost definitely would not pay the $20+ for this again. That said, it's still an above average and enjoyable beer. Being a recent bottling, it IS still young at this point and I'd like to see how the brett plays out with a couple years in the cellar. If this could crank the sour just a bit, I think it'd be much better. As it is right now, I tastes more like a Belgian IPA than a wild ale."
"Overall, not that 'wild' but certainly pretty good. Interesting enough, but I found it accessible, tasty, and refreshing more than anything else. I would recommend this highly, but I'm not quite sure that it's worth the price point....I hate to be like that, but...."
"Was a very bright golden color with a pretty good head with an off white color. The aroma was not very strong but was plesant and carried a light crisp fruit smell with it. The taste was of a well balanced and crafted brew. The fruit comes threw very lightly and is carried with the flavors of the hops. There were not any overpowering flavors in this brew for me. Everything was balanced and came threw very tasty. The brew felt very light and did not weigh me down, which is great for a 7.4% beer. The carbonation was very low but was just enough. This can easily beer a brew to have in session."
"Certainly better than average but not very memorable, which was a disappointment."
"Served in a tulip glass. This is a mostly clear golden orange beer with a white head of minuscule bubbles, about 2 cm in height. There is a malty, spiced aroma that is also very floral. The taste is of sweet citrus at first; it reminds me of grapefruit. As you begin experience the flavors, the floral tones come out strong and evolve into pure hops by the end, only becoming apparent just as you swallow. The tastes of this beer are very complex and quite amazing. There is a light to medium body. Overall, I'm quite impressed with this wild ale. It's not as great as Allagash's Gargamel, but it is still very impressive (much easier to obtain). I really enjoyed it and will drink it again. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a beer to think about as you drink it."
"Hazy gold appearance with medium size very dense head that falls quickly. Aroma is predominately Belgian funk and Gambrinus honey malt. Flavor is Pilsen, Honey, and Belgian aromatic malt with just enough hop to balance. Yeast flavor is a very nice blend of straight Belgian and brett. Finishes fairly long with brett flavors. Beer seems young, I'll give this one 2 years in the cellar and it should be perfect then..."
"Drinkability: Reasonably complex and more than interesting enough to hold my attention throughout the full eleven ounces served to me. Each sip presents something a little bit different and duly requires a second sip, a third sip, etc. Recommended if you're a fan of the sour ales and aren't turned off by the price tag."
"Complex, you will want to seek this one out and try."
"Poured from a bottle courtesy of my brother.... Thanks Adam! Appearance is pretty standard. Golden straw, small head fading into a fine laced glass of beer. Smell is impressive for a wild ale. Some wild yeast, minimal hops and most importantly a strong berry scent. If all sour beers could smell like this. Taste is perfect for a young sour. Lots of soft blueberry, sweet malt and a slight bit of sourness. It is a perfectly balanced sour with an excellent flavor. Very drinkable compared to most wild beers I have had. Mouth feel is pretty typical for the appearance, with a slight linger of flavor, but otherwise clean and dare I say refreshing on a warm Washington day. I would definitley recommend picking up a bottle of this if you see it."
"This is a very nice beer, one that put me very much in mind with the collaborative effort Allagash did with and De Proef. Well done."
"Mouthfeel okay, but just not a good beer. Its various component flavors and aroma just did not find any sort of harmonic ... confluence."
"I like Allagash stuff but its barrel-aged gear, while good, has not brought me all the way over the top...until now. It may have a much lighter body than Curieux, Interlude or the other suspects but I am amazed by the cleanliness of this thing and how well it drinks for something jacked up on Brett. It's hopped differently (i. e. more, it seems) and takes advantage of a lot of synergies. Just enough balsa-wood consistency of the malt to keep a good, spritely backbone while letting the yeast, Brett and the light yet prevalent carbonation mix it up with a little hop in its step. ""Light snack but good."" To say the least. Yeah, it's in the high-rent district but y'know...location, location, location..."
"Overall this is a good introduction to American Wilds. It's got a good amount of funk but is by no means overpowering - it's almost a combination of a trippel and AWA. Definitely worth a try."
"I could only drink so much of this, I have no others of the style to compare it to, but I will easily finish this 750. I like this beer a lot...the cost may be prohibitive, but I will try again."
"Drinkability: I'd sit back, sip and enjoy this new stellar addition to the Rob Tod Collection. Rob, Thanks for another great beer!"
"Not something that is terribly drinkable. I love Allagash, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
"Cork popped like rocket but didnt gush. Was immediately overcome by an intoxicating light fruity aroma with a touch of sourness, makes me think of a red, yellow and green sourpatch kid combined. Taste is as smooth and delicate as the aroma suggests, sourness is nuanced not dominant. Mouthfeel is light and almost fizzy though the head dissipated quickly. This is insanely drinkable, another quality brew from Allagash."
"I suppose I'm biased, because I really like Allagas products, but this is a wonderful beer. Served in a tulip glass, the beer was a hazy yellow color with a medium-sized white head and a bit of lacing. It had that yeasty farm-like aroma, but also was sweet and peppery. I thought it had a tropical fruit taste, a bit of spicy zing. Mostly a sweet mouthfeel. This would be a great dessert beer."
"Confluence is light bodied and tart with great carbonation. This is very drinkable, and the aroma is really great."
"Certainly not one of Allagash's best efforts, good stab at a wild ale and not something they have a lot of experience with yet, interested in trying the bottled release later on, but not in a hurry to drink again, still worth trying"
"(3.8/5)"
"Tasted like a spicy, yeasty, funky, single Belgian pale."
"Taste is of the mentioned aromas with more lemony zest coming through with a floral, and honey flavors, with a mild hoppiness coming through."
"Poured a meidum and hazy golden/orange color with a small sized head. Aromas of brett (that came out more and more as I drank this one), fruity, earthy, citrus, and some yeast. Tastes of citrus, earthy, spices, and some brett. Light to medium tart finish."
"with the tartness of the fruits in the beer, the drinkabity is much like a white wine; slightly syrupy."
"I really liked the overall flavor and appearance of the beer and suggest that if you are somewhere it is on tap, order it, you will not be dissapointed!"
