An incredible Belgian Strong Pale Ale from start to finish, The Lost Abbey's Inferno Ale get as close to replicating the classics as possible, so close in fact, one might believe it straight from Belgium in a blind tasting! To top it off, every time I've experienced this beer it retains it's quality, which is more than I can say for one of the largest producers of this style.

The color was a nice golden, the head was one finger floating above four in a snifter, slowing melting to a nice coat on the top. Ale was about 36-38 degrees F. (I like my IPAs cold) Smell was mild, fruity, typical of a belgian, with no individual overwhelming flavor. Taste was nice, extremely complex, sweet after-taste, but enough bitterness not to be cloying. Spices well mixed, several different fruity hints overlapped each other. Mouth feel was great - smooth, thick almost, left nice coating. Alcohol was nicely hidden by the complexity of the flavors, nice buzz after a while. I just might try some more of these unique belgians from now on.","techguyale","Nov 27, 2013"

Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a thin lace cap for a head that reduces to a ring. Minimal clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, honey, wheat, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, candi sugar, bubblegum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters and malt sweetness; with a great malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Zero carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall, despite having nearly zero carbonation; this was a very good Belgian strong golden. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 15, 2013"

4.8,19.7,5,5,4.5,5,5,"This January 2013 I review a bottle of Inferno bottled October 2011. This pours with the same thick head, but it dissipates faster and sticks around the sides of the glass above the beer. There are no bubbles rising in the orange liquid. the smell actually reminds me of wine- lots of fruit but a lot more alcohol in the smell than what I recall a young Inferno to have. I raised smell up to 5 after it warmed and the alcohol in the nose went down bring more of the raisin and pear and peach like smells out. Before the taste I will describe te mouthfeel as it is unique for how little bubble action we see: as soon as it's in my mouth it starts to lightly bubble and fizz. As if it was just waiting for me to taste it for it to come alive. First you get the fizz on your tongue - then you get the flavor. As the carbonation dies down in your mouth the different flavors of bread, fruits, and a metallic alcohol presence (that I associate with wine) come about. It isn't that it tasted different with each sip- it is well balanced between the bread and jam-like flavors with the alcohol resting underneath, but the way the flavor opens up in your mouth with the strong carbonation apparently starting to bubble in your mouth- then instantly ceasing to reveal a marvelously mixed flavor is something I don't recall at all from a young bottle, and it's quite an entertaining drinking experience. And it maintains that fizz-in-your-mouth quality to the end of the bottle. I would have liked to review alongside a fresh bottle but these are big bottles. Off my memory of a young bottle: main differences as far as flavor: the young bottle I remember had a somewhat sharp presence of yeast. It really stood out and brought a somewhat bitter funk flavor. Here that flavor is still present but is more entwined with the overallflavor rather than tasting like an element that stands out. You taste more of the fruity malt influence and a slightly dry metallic aftertaste. I didn't know what to expect- this is a first aged beer but damn it shows that it's worth the time.","tilopud_rye","Dec 30, 2012"

Aroma of Belgian spices, yeast and light fruit. A light metallic component to the aroma. Flavor is dry, spicy with light fruit and a hint of Brett or wild yeast. Dry peppery finish. The wild yeast component is mild enough that I enjoyed this ale. I'd probably choose a Belgian over this because of the dryness, but it is well made and enjoyable.","LiquidAmber","Mar 09, 2012"

Served from bottle into a Bell’s stemmed tulip. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a pure white five finger head that subsided to three fingers very slowly. It maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, floral, floral hop, spices, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, clove, fruit, floral, floral hop, earth, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The appearance was pretty nice on this one. There was a lot going on in the flavor of this one that really made you guess on the style of this brew. The aroma was pretty complex too.

After popping the cork and pouring into my snifter, it looked good but I was hoping for something less filtered. The smell was sweet and spicy but nothing special. The taste was a little better. I let it warm a bit and got a bit more spice but was not savoring every sip. I got bored with it pretty quick. The mouthfeel was pretty average. Nothing special. Overall this was good, but for a Belgian Strong Pale, I was left with my desires unsatisfied. The carbonation was there but did not clean the palate like I would have liked. The strong portions of the flavor stuck around a bit too long. Lost Abbey makes some good brews. Despite my warm buzz at the end of the entire bottle, I felt as if I was ripped off by the brewer. I'd rather have a Damnation or a Pranqster, which can be argued as a different classification. But for American brewed Belgian golden/pale ales, this one is not at the top of my list.

4.15,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I've been sitting on this beer for a couple of months. With the fourth snowfall in as many weeks, I figured that it was time to pull out a special beer to celebrate such a special occasion. Cork was a little tough to pull out, so I was concerned about a yeasty pour, but this is actually relatively clear, with nice carbonation. Color is a pale golden yellow. Smells super fruity, with a pleasant, almost cherry aroma. There's light cereal in the background, too. Smells pretty damn good. No head retention, but then again I'm using a Chimay glass, so there's really none needed. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but there's a ton of flavor hitting the mouth at once. Trying to catalog the tastes is a fool's errand. There's a slight sour funkiness that starts, followed by by some surprising levels of spice. The spice recedes and there's this wonderful Belgian fruitiness in the middle of the beer, with some light citrus, melon, and pear notes bleeding through. Mild citrus hop character helps to usher in a bone dry finish. Simply wonderful, and it only gets better as you let the beer warm up. The high ABV is never really all that noticeable, and the light body with the dry finish means you want to drink a whole bunch of it ... even if you probably shouldn't. Very good and would easily make it into my usual rotation if I could find it more often around here.","eclaycamp","Mar 29, 2011"

Will pair well with food, especially cheese, like many in the Lost Abbey repertoire. Perfect for one beer with a meal. Not sessionable and I would never touch this after anything with serious hops.

The beer has citrus notes on the smell, with a hint of some spices to balance. The flavors are of very light citrus, with a blended spice tasting of coriander and nutmeg. Very smooth in mouth, and a crisp, light finish. The alcohol helps balance the sweet and spice flavors, and the spice follows through to the aftertaste. Almost peppery notes on the aftertaste, also.

The taste was also pretty fruity from the belgian yeast with clove spice, apple, pear, and citrus accents. There was plenty of malts and a touch of underlying hops to cap off the flavor. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, spice, citrusy, and malty finish. It drank real good and really did some justice for the style.

The aroma is loads of pale malts and spices such as coriander and lemon zest. Taste is an absolutely wonderful plethora of citrus hops, pale malts and spices all dancing together in perfect harmony on the tongue.

4.26,6.2,5,4,4,4,5,"75cl bottle purchased early this summer down in Orange County. Crystal clear maybe a touch darker shade of gold than Duvel. They didn't really hide the fact that they were basing Inferno on the original devil of beers himself, so excuse the flagrant comparisons. The head almost lackadaisically rose to the rim of my Duvel tulip but manages to stay there for a few minutes, leaving a plethora of lace in it's wake and remaining as a nice pad of white foam for the duration of the beer's stay in the glass. ample carbonation trails up from the bottom of the glass. The aroma leaves an initial impression of doughy malt and yeast, with pear, strawberry, lemon, and spicy hops adding subtle complexity. In the mouth, there is an initial fruity sweetness that is quickly taken over by spicy hops and bitter fruit peel. Cracked grain and honey also seem to add the to the sweet quality, though the finish dries out pretty well with hops and alcohol. The body is light with carbonation on the higher side, and a dry feel on the back of the tongue. I love Duvel, and this may not be spot on, but is just as enjoyable. Seems like people are expecting something fro this beer that it never promises in the first place. I mean, the style was Belgium's answer to the pilsener, for what it's worth.","bulletrain76","Nov 03, 2009"

Very fruity aroma, yellow grapes, white wine, crackers, bread and yeast, cloves and a hint of lemon zest. Good balance. Bitterness was present throughout, but remains restrained. The fruity character so prominent in the aroma was pulled back a bit (and was more of the pear and apple variety), allowing the malt to add some smoothness and honey sweetness.

Taste begins with sweet citrus quickly followed by white bread and honey. Midway some pale malts and dry hops emerge on the tongue with a touch of booze. Aftertaste is light and fruity with a good amount of grapes and banana leaving the mouth somewhat dry. Medium body with a soft feel to it. Carbonation is strong and plays well into this style of beer. Nothing about this beer is too over the top and that's what I like about it. The 8.5% abv is pretty difficult to find, so be careful with this one. Anoter chart topper for Lost Abbey, keep 'em comin'!","BeerTruth","Jul 14, 2008"
4.32,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a pretty good initial head that ultimately fades to a thin ring. Smells quite fruity with tropical fruits, juicy and a bit sweet while maintaining a decent balance. Tastes quite nice. Smooth and even a bit waxy with some restrained fruitiness, some firm malt, a touch of sweetness and a bit of short, sharp bitterness that is pretty well integrated to the overall taste. Very smooth and even a touch soft in the mouth. Not at all too sweet. Very nice. Starts more like a tripel but mellows into a more Belgian pale taste as it opens up.","Georgiabeer","Jul 11, 2008"
4.29,7,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Very tasty easy to drink beer. Great for the summer. The alcohol (8.5%) is very well hidden. The hops used are a little too long lasting in the finish and not my favorite varietal.","WeeObese","Jul 11, 2008"
4.65,16,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Hmmm...hmmmm...What does this taste like?...Sweet?...Sour?...Bitter?...Tart? Wait, wait, let me try to convey the taste of this amazing renaissance man of beer. The Inferno Ale must just be the greatest, most diverse beer I have ever had. I keep taking sips from my tulip glass just to make sure I'm not going crazy. This beer really is sweet, sour, bitter, and tart at the same time. Wait a minute, I'm on sensory overload again. I apologize but I feel like the cop at the end of The Usual Suspects. I just can't get my head around this beer. There's definitely orange slice taste to this brew as well as hop attack. The cloudy color doesn't give you hints of what's about to enter your mouth. Most likely, you haven't tasted anything like this before; I don't mean just beer, I mean ANYTHING. The alcohol isn't too overpowering but you definitely know it's there like skeletons in your closet. Oh maybe I haven't tried enough beer yet and this is just like puppy love and what do I know? But this is as real as it gets from my perspective, I'll keep this one as one of the fondest memories I've ever had drinking.","JRed","Jul 07, 2008"

3.8,-5.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Much like other posts this was an above average beer but didn't wow me. Should be some further development as bottle fermintation takes place over the next couple years. Minerals, some roasted banana leaf, mild oil citrus. Weird to have a ""mineral"" taste as they make their own reverse osmosis water, and don't run that water over any type of stone or rock to allow the water to pick up minerals and flavor. Though this beer still expresses minerals? I do enjoy that flavor in this beer. Would buy again but only a couple for the next couple years. $9 locall I believe, so not terrible expensive.","paytoplay","0"

This is a nice golden straw color as the label states. The smell is very hard for me to describe but it is nice. This is easy to drink and I can see some similarities to Duvel but I think I like this better because it seems less carbonated. The only thing I don't like about this beer is the price. This seems more like an $8 beer (Red Barn and such) than an $11 beer.","ArrogantB","Jun 26, 2008"

Flavor is similar to Duvel, but doesn't have quite the authenticity or depth. A lot of light fruit flavors are present. I like it pretty well. Well made and a nice American Belgian style.","Crosling","Jun 18, 2008"

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"I was pleased to see that another Lost Abbey beer has made its way to the East Coast. This was bought at Marty's Liquors in Newton today. I love the Dante esq looking artwork on the bottle. Just a side note; this was tasted, as recommended by some, alongside some Duvel, which apparently shares some of the same features. Pour in to a sniffer resulted in an orange/amber color, with a moderately large white head. Nose is based in fruit, with a bit of a cinnamon gum aroma. Must and alcohol, similar to a farmhouse ale in some ways, also show themselves in the nose. Taste is wonderfully floral, with spices all around. It transitions from sweet, to tart to dry, to slightly spicy within the span of a single sip. Body is full, but the alcohol is not particularly noticeable in the taste, very well hidden in fact. This one is easy to sip as well, but be careful, as it is a decently strong ale. Overall this is a very solid offering from The Lost Abbey. Not my favorite, but still great. For those that are wondering on the side by side tasting, Duvel won by a tiny amount. Inferno is more concentrated on complex flavor and aroma, whereas Duvel is all about mastering the feel and drinkability. I highly recommend putting the two down against each other, as it was a very fun experience.","jamie2dope","Jun 14, 2008"
