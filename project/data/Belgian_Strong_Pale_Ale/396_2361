It's more fruity than I was expecting but the balance is great and the carbonation is perfect, helping the beer down far too easily for the strength of the beer. Simply put, this one is a must try for any beer fan and one that was well worth the very expensive price tag - definitely a beer that has aged well since I picked it up a couple of years ago.","flyingpig","Jan 19, 2015"

Not a classic BSPA, but not a huge departure...just a bit heavy on the sweet for the nose. As for the flavor, the sweetness comes through, but e fruitiness is more present and balances things out...although this definitively falls on the sweeter side of the spectrum for the style. Some bubble gum notes and phenolic booze on the finish. Drinks fairly nice and even without a lot of carbonation. Overall, not bad at all.

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Fast gusher upon opening. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, grape, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, spice, and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, grape, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, candi sugar, cracker, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of yeast, spice, and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. All around great balance and complexity of yeast, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild white bread, plenty of Belgian yeast, clove, a pinch of black pepper,. and a tiny bit of cracked wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a healthy dose of oaked chardonnay grapes. This bit o'ertakes much of the remainder, killing some of the Belgian-y exuberance, especially due to its clashing with the yeast and the bread. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an airily drying finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. The strong yeast just didn't jive with the strange chardonnay flavor, and there was just too much bread thropughout as well.","TMoney2591","Sep 18, 2013"

Nose of tart and sweet tropical fruit, including pineapple, mango, and a citrus blend. Spices of coriander, nutmeg, and cinnamon blend nicely with all the fruity characteristics, with hints of Belgian funk and booze highlights. Flavors of booze forward, with a heavy dose of banana sweet and subtle spice blend to follow. Clove and coriander give the beer a touch of balance, and there is an overall warmth that builds as you drink from the ABV. This one's a heavy hitter. The aftertaste is tangy sweet from all the fruit character, with that warmth still kicking around your mouth. Smooth bodied, and kept light by the carbonation.

3.6,-11.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Split a large bottle with a friend over lunch. It poured a slightly hazy straw yellow in the restaurant's (Little Ortino's) Kasteel glasses. The slight alcohol heat was understandable, but the beer was unusually acidic. I was hoping for a super Duvel, was more wine-like with a yeasty, spiced edge. My friend was not a fan. But while the flavor was a bit off the mark, little things like the mouthfeel and carbonation were on, and I wonder a little if the beer was mishandled and poorly stored. Either way, this came off like a Belgian strong pale that's veered off course.","tempest","Aug 04, 2012"

Poured a pale straw yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, clove, spice, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, alcohol, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. This one was all over the place with the aroma and flavor. The alcohol definitely makes itself known throughout the entire brew.

The flavor is lightly sweet up front with the candi sugar and, pear and grape juice showing nicely, along with the spices and hay malt just lightly peaking through.

The carbonation and strong spice presence makes this beer a bit harsh and difficult to drink. As it warms and the palate adjusts, the grassy hops, bready yeast and fruit notes become more evident. Hints of apple, pear and candy sugar add sweetness but the spice is too strong for my liking. Finishes with a lot of boozy sweetness and warmth in the chest.

It tastes of its strength, the alcohol kick is huge, a little citrusy, definite esters kicking up a storm, bit of coriander. Yes, this would definitely benefit from a little age, as the flavors are duking it out currently. Lots of flavors going on, but the alcohol burn that accompanies each sip is a bit distracting.

4.11,1.5,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,"( 37/50, 11% alc/vol, Home, after a good jam) Small yeast sediment in suspension throughout the glass of golden pale ale. The yellowish head dissipates extremely quickly. But even with this defect, the ale shines through. Some pineapple esters accentuate another slightly alcoholic ale with very evident belgian yeasts. Quite nice fruity aromas mixed in a sort of way that the alcohol is blended very well. Savor the yeast as it starts, then quickly get the grassy hops that escape the otherwise daunting body of alcoholic fruit esters. Pineapple, prunes, lemon marang pie. Tinge of alcoholic burn and an acrid yeast quickly gets the warmth effect and takes on a life of it's own. Weird because it starts off not that good, but as it warms, it begins to harmonize and eventually gets round and playful. It takes a talented brewmaster to deliver 11% alcohol in an attractive way. This one takes the cake in the originality of the delivery. Warmth brings it all together. Great nite sipper. Try it with lemon pie and filet of porc.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

Alesmith did a wonderful job featuring Belgian yeast. It's the highlight here and steals the show. A little more strength on the nose would help, in addition to a prominent spicy flavor. It's good, but could be grand. More bubbles would be a good thing, as well. Nonetheless, I'm still impressed with Horny Devil. While I don't believe it has any effect on my prurient nature, it certainly appeases my beer-loving character.","prototypic","Jan 07, 2010"

4.03,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Draught at the Red. Hazy gold with a creamy white head. Sweet aroma. Plenty of fruity notes with banana domination, some spicing, and light tartness. The flavor has that same fruity sweetness, with some orange/banana, and a spicy and alcoholic wrap-up. A lemony, tangy citrus flavor come in a bit later. The sugar lightens the body to a medium clip; much easier to drink than the grand cru, and with very creamy, tight carbonation. For 11%, this is insanely easy to put down. The banana/spice flavors and creamy texture make me think of a belgian pale-strong crossed with a German hef. Definitely the preferred of their big Belgian styled offerings a this point.","bulletrain76","Dec 14, 2009"

It's earthy and more complex than the majority of American made Belgian-style ales. It's accessible and very easy to like. Drinkability is great.

Sweetness from the candi sugar comes through on the back end, and helps the brew finish quite dry and a little hot. ABV is relatively hidden as drinkability is dangerous.

It tasted like lots of wild yeast and creamy lemon and caramel, with a bit of sugary cake and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with moderate carbonation, and had a smooth sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean beer with nice flavor and great body. The coriander really helped the lemon hops mesh with the wild yeast. That, along with excellent Belgian candi sugar, resulted in an exceptionally balanced flavor. Better for sipping since alcohol was noticeable (but not overwhelming). Age would probably help mellow this beer some, and further enhance the malty goodness. But this is still a very good beer fresh.","Pencible","Apr 29, 2009"

Medium-bodied with a sweet character. Flavors of Belgian candi sugar, yeast and sweet spices are all present. Touches of alcohol and malt are present as well. The finish is sweet sugar and spice and lingers a bit. Overall this is an enjoyable Belgian, although it does not quite live up to the standard set by AlesmithÂ’s other beers. It swings a little too far on the sweet side so the complexity suffers a bit as a result. I would get this again but the price would make me think twice.","Dogbrick","Dec 19, 2007"

The alcohol is quite noticable in the mouthfeel and this is a great example of my favorite style-but is not my favorite example. The mouthfeel could use some improvement.

It wasn't until I read some reviews that I discovered that the beer I poured wasn't flat after all. The complexity is nice, and there is plenty of balance to talk about.

I want to say first that I love the Alesmith products, and I love all Belgian styles. That being saaid, this one, at least at this age, can only be described as a fruit bomb and was a little bit of a shocker. Poured a slightly hazy golden with a decent head that faded pretty quickly and left minimal laccing. My sample didn't seem quite as flat as some others have reported, but it was a little low in carbonation. The smell and taste were both very fruity, but changed significantly toward the tropical as the bottle warmed and breathed. Some banana and apricot as well as coriander on the nose at first, and then as it warmed huge mango aromas. The taste was similar, with more restrained coriander, banana and apricot at first and then huge apricot, mango and persimmon flavors. The mouthfeel was a little slick, but there was some creaminess there as well, and as noted the carbonation was slightly low. I liked this beer at first, but as the intense tropical flavors grew it just became a little overwhelming and hard to finish- it was that fruity. I even like fruit beers, but this was super intense and also too sweet in the end.","Georgiabeer","Jun 05, 2007"

Pours a small amount of bubbles on the surface. Not carbonation foam, bubbles like you could get from water. Crisp orange gold liquid with some fine particulates suspended. Smells carry brandy and bourbon (my wife says it smells metallic). Caramel and alcohol sting. The taste is Halloween candy caramel...that is cheap and waxy. Funky phenolics are minimal, but there is a sour character. Green apples and mango. Creamy mouthfeel, but the flavors just don't come together on it.","mentor","Nov 23, 2005"

The nose is nice, with a bit of spicey orange citrus and slight wheaty grain. I dig it a lot. The flavor is not as nice as the aroma. Its a little like a creamy orange, but almost with a soapyness in there. Doesn't really do it for me as much as I recall it doing the first time. The feel is thick, almost syrupy, wtih a light carbonation. I find the flavor keeps this from being a highly drinkable beer. That soapy character just doesn't do it for me.

Lighting wasn't great, but this looked to be a faded orange with a long lasting bubbly white head that laced gently down the tulip glass. First and foremost in the aroma is coriander...lots of coriander. Swirling it around a little & trying to get past the coriander (which I like) allowed me to pick up some some additional scents of sweet orange liquor and rock candy. In the mouth, this ale really burst with flavor. More coriander across the top of the flavor profile, but not as dominant as in the nose & complimented gorgeously by more subtle spices, candied sweetness, & deep ripe fruit (banana, lemon, & orange). Some mild earthy hops are present in the background & contribute to this brew's complexity. Subtle, but warming alcohol evident throughout. Medium bodied with a very dry finish.

Very nice lacing was left around the goblet as it was consumed. The nose was filled with spice, coriander I am guessing along with a slight sweetness. The taste was very similar as a fruit sweetness was backed by spiciness and a bit of alcohol. There was also a slightly bitter aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is full and rich, as most Alesmith offerings are. Overall this is a very interesting beer that is tasty but the drinkability is hindered by the over use of spice as is wears on you by the end of the bottle.","meathookjones","Jul 05, 2004"

Palate is also moderately yeasty with more fruity notes (lime, pear). The cookie malt feels a little stale though, like a fruit juice and the balancing bitterness seems a bit restrained.

The sweetness is this beers primary flavor attribute but also one that cuts back on the drinkability. Mouthfeel: I would say medium bodied ale with a lot of texture from the syrupy fruit a bit cloying due to the sweetness. Drinkability: Very tasty and flavorful however the lack of carbonation takes away from the crispness turning into a strong alcoholic syrup, it's better than that but I am quite disappointed from this offering from Alesmith.

This really needs to be highly carbonated, this is just lightly carbonated. Does this get better? It must, right? Not too interesting at all.

Nevertheless, it's a nice looking beer, golden with a red hue, accented by lots of ascending bubbles. Huge peppery spiciness in the aroma, followed by a little lemon and coriander. A bit estery, small amount of tart apple and some dried fruit. A bit yeasty. Sharp and zesty on the palate. Smooth and malty sweet at the start with spicy pepper on the edges of the tongue. Candi sugar is detectable here. Spiciness increases as it hits the middle, and a bit of dried fruit shows up here as well. I'm getting some banana too. Lemony and sharp near the back, with hoppiness showing up right before the finish. Pepper and coriander all the way through. Spicy and dry finish. Excellent take on the style. I love peppery spiciness in beers. There aren't too many of these brewed in America outside of Unibroue's, and this one is right up there with the best.

Gives a wine like fruity fragrance and a creamy smooth mouthfeel which is probably the only outstanding characteristic I found. Sweet and fruity with an almost foul sugar aftertaste.
