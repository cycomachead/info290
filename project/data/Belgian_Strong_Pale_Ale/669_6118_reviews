"An interesting yet rather dulling beer. By that, I mean that the mild astringency, bitterness, and over-bearing dryness makes this rather flat and one-dimensional. Drinkable? Sure. Big booze buzz? Check. Memorable and wanting you to drink more? Not quite. Fair enough for what it is, but nothing to get really excited about."

"Overall, this is a big, bold, and balanced brew that gets the job done.  I actually preferred it a little on the cooler side, as some of the flavors start to tip the balance as it warms, although that really is nit-picking.  I'd be hard-pressed to declare any significant faults."

"Nice tight bubbled foamy 2 fingers of head that leave a persistent lacing through the drink. Aroma is very hefeweizen-like IMO. Banana and clove come through in the yeast. Peppery tones and Belgian phenolics are also present. Taste is a bit flat. Not a lot of nuance, but I'm not mad at it either. It's crisp and somehow refreshing for a 10% brew. Quite dry as far as mouthfeel, very tripel-like. Overall a decent example and I'm glad this is readily available here in Spain."

"O - Some aspect of this beer you will find very hard to beat. Its been a while since I've tried this but its a great beer and recommended. There is not much more that you could want from a beer in this style."

"Murky orange with a big white head. Notes of pears, chardonnay, clove, and bananas. Very classic european hop gives a nice earthy and grassy counterbalance in the finish. Nice carbonation. Not the most complex beer but certainly a decent BSPA. I might try this again in the future."

"A very good Belgian ale, but not fantastic. Worth trying but I'd ultimately rather have a Piraat or DT."

"Bottom Line: Good brew with too much carbonation."

"Kind of an earthy, subdued version of the style. Drinkable but not something Id clamor for."

"O: With its modest 3.97 BA rating (currently) I see this as very underrated and I doubt my bottle was 100% fresh either, seeing as I bought it on the grey market here in Korea."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is dangerously drinkable, with an ABV of 10% I should be just sipping it, but the taste was so good that made that very difficult."

"I am reviewing a beer that's been stored safely since 2008, and it's January of 2014. If ever there was a champagne of beers, this is it. Fruity, zesty, a bit of banana, grape skins and honey. Reminds me of a mead I made back in 1999 (and continue to cellar to this day). Very heavily carbonated, yet with a round mouth feel, two fingers and terrific lacing. Flavors linger and slowly fade on the middle of the tongue. There are some solids in the deep golden brew, but it's mind over matter as this beer warms the belly with the obviously present, yet somehow balanced alcohol. What a treat!"

"Bottle from belgianbeershop.com - Malheur 10 is clear golden with a thick and stable white head. The aroma is yeasty with fruity aspects (citrus) and with a clear alcohol presence. The taste is very like the aroma. This beer has a fresh character with a bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is very present and dominates a bit too much. Overall a good beer that goes very well with meat dishes."

"D - a good but not fantastic example of the style. That still better than most"
"Hint, it does get much better once it warms up (and not only because of the ABV kicking in)."

"Sorry, just lacks balance for me. Too much of a yo-yo experience."

"Smell is a bit faint. There's a bit of spice, but mainly malt. Equal in the taste. With that, there's a big amount of boozyness... hardly a good sign. Alcohol should be covered by aroma and flavour, and here it's not happening. The alcohol is sweet and warming, not harsh. That makes up for something, but all in all this is a boring drink."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best by 9/2011. Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge lemon, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, herbal, floral, grass, earth, pepper, honey, and spicy yeast esters. Damn nice aromas with very nice complexity and balance. Taste of big lemon, lemon zest, apricot, pear, pepper, apple, grass, honey, earth, herbal, floral, coriander, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, earth, herbal, floral, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of malt sweetness and spicy esters; with a nice amount of complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel as expected, and fairly crisp on the finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 10%, with only a warming noticed well after the finish. Extremely easy to sip on, with good smoothness. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale ale(even though I saw this as more of a tripel). Great flavor complexity, balance, and smoothness. Extremely enjoyable stuff."

"D: Typical good beer."
"Pours a murky light orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grape-like fruits, and grape juice aromas. Taste is of grain, grape juice, and spices with an alcohol kick with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the alcohol is pretty in your face with each sip."

"On draft at the brewery. Poured into Malheur chalice-like tulip at brewery. High clarity. Tall white head. Good retention. Soapy lacing. Aroma, nice malt sweetness, citrus fruitiness. Taste, mild bitterness, fruity, banana with some apricot.  Belgian yeast esters dominate.  Thick, tongue coating, no alcohol taste. "

"Nice mix of fruit, spice, and booze. Mmm, hmmm."
"Another fabulous Malheur! I let this warm to room temp and drank it over some time. It poured with a huge, off-white, foamy, frothy, fluffy, thick head that lasts quite a while and good lacing. Color is a hazy apricot amber with some particulates in suspension. Aroma is yeast, fruit, malt, spice. Flavor's a lot like nose with fruit on top, then bitter from hop and yeast, followed by carbonic tang. Body is full, rich, and smooth with good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and very slowly tapers off with some alcohol warmth. Great beer for sipping while reading a great book! Or just sipping; what am I thinking?!?"
"Overall: Another great example of a Belgian Tripel, this one is a little heavier in the ABV at 10% so that should be respected."
"WS"
"I'm not quite sure what to make of this beer. Smells like a Wit, tastes like an American wheat beer combined with a Maibock. Very unique, to say the least."
"A nice presentation though a bit fetching as for the stalwarts of the style. Nonetheless a recommended brew that improves with warming and exposure. And at 10 percent, this brew offers a solid stealth mode."
"A good beer, if not that interesting. A high alcohol thirst-quencher."
"Good beer, though more subtle than I had been expecting."
"Overall, a nice Belgian. There are a lot of layers to this one. Perhaps if this one wasn't so sticky on the mouth, I might give it better scores. But the mouthfeel makes this one a sipper. I don't imagine wanting to drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"O: amazing; basically tastes like an unfiltered wheat, with a strong caveat - the 10% abv; beautiful beer"
"T: astringent, lots of alcohol, some sweet and acid notes, long final"
"A very good Golden style ale with plenty of character."
"D- drinkability is decent. The smoothness helps to mask the ten percent abv well."
"Medium bodied. Actually a bit tingly on the tongue. Carbonation is evident in the towering head from a pour. Helps in drinkability. Very decent beer. Boozy and chemical element might be a turn off to some. Fits the style."
"Overall: A very impressive example of the style, though just a bit sweet for my palate"
"Taste is sweet, matching up with the honey flavor. It has hint of of a wheat beer taste towards the end of the swallow."
"Say, ""no"" to morons..."
"O: This is good but certainly not anything special."
"D: As it warms, the booze starts to come out a bit more, but this is still a fine enough beer."
"D- An above average BSPA. Not as complex as many in style, but still well made. A cost efficient beer for style."
"D: This beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its dryness and high alcohol content."
"Lovely beer, a really smooth and mellow, but spicy and complex Belgian strong pale. Such beers are rare indeed, and more often than not, you have to take the intense heat and spice as part of the package. I'm glad this one mellows it so much."
"jd"
"Overall this beer is good, the aroma is wonderful, but the alcoholic flavors are quite strong. I think this beer would get much better with some age."
"This is a really tasty brew. Goes down very easy. Complex, rich, well crafted. I would buy it again and recommend you try it!"
"Drinkability: A strong, not overly boozy belgian pale. I happen to like dry beers and this one did not disappoint. Pretty tasty, glad I got to try it."
"bottle split and paired with moules bleu at Granville"
"D - exceptionally drinkable. I still can't believe the gravity indicated on the label. and apart from ABV, the balance and craftmanship are just right on."
"Well constructed."
"Carbonation is stupidly high."
"Pretty warm, even for a Belgian Strong, but nice enough for a nightcap."
"Overall, I'll probably try it again, just to check."
"D: Apart from the nose this beer makes for quite the Belgian Strong. Quite a bit fruitier than Duvel and almost veers into Belgian IPA territory IMO but does not detract from my enjoyment of the beer in the least."
"Drinkability: I find this one really growing on me. It's extremely drinkable considering the ABV ... I could really find myself getting in trouble with this one; that's a sure sign of greatness."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. 15.01.09 indicated on the back label. Foam slowly oozed out on the bottle pop. Poured a hazy, dull, orange-gold with a four inch, dense, creamy, off-white head. Head slowly collapses into a one inch, frothy, bubble white mass with thick concentric bands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is pretty boozy - I can smell the alcohol from two feet away. Once you get past that initial quality, there's an earthy/spicy character, as well as citrus and prunes. Taste follows nose. Booziness begins to dissipate as the beer breathes, lots of prunes and candi sugar here. Mouthfeel is medium, with a pleasant, lively carbonation and a slight viscosity/slickness. Nice beer - reminds me a lot of a Tripel in may ways. Very respectable and solid."
"This is definitely a monster beer, it's drinkable for what it is, but it's definitely one and done."
"Overall it is decent but not an exemplary version of the style."
"D: Big kick of sour/bitter orange flavors in the beer that didn't appeal to me."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer thats pretty easy to drink with a good taste to it worth picking up sometime to give it a try"
"A good beer, which was complex and flavorful, although I'm not sure I could have one per session. Drinkability was average as it was good, but to me would only be good in limited quantities."
"D - Wow, this is a really enjoyable beer. Great with food, too."
"This beer is thick, but effervescent. It's not afraid to make its alcohol known, though this only adds to the complexities of the flavor. As the beer warms a bit, the smells hinted at in the nose bloom into something else when the alcohol comes in. It's very deep and warming, adding a layer of caramel malt that was not originally detected in the nose. Very honey-like. It tastes delicious. It reminds me incredibly of champagne, as well as mead, though it seems less one-dimensional than most champagnes/meads I've had. This has spice and kick, and a great sweet warmth that the carbonation takes right off your tongue so it does not become too cloying. Even at $5 for 330 ml, I could easily see myself buying this again."
"D- I really didn't like this the first time I tried it and although it's better than what I remembered, it still becomes to cloying with the sweetness and alcohol taste. There's much better BSPA's out there."
"F: A little more bitterness and a touch of dryness, but a lingering bittersweet taste way on the back of the tongue. More lemon peel and lingering bitter hops with some citrus, lemongrass, and floral tastes. I also get a touch of honey which seems to come out a bit on the finish and could account for some of that dryness. For 10% abv it is very drinkable too."
"Overall this is a big beer that drinks a lot smaller than it is. Very easy-drinking and well worth a shot."
"I like this. It's a good cross between a wit and a blonde. Still like malheur 12 better."
"Notes: A nice BSPA, not quite at the level of say Duvel, but a good solid example. Well balanced with some tripel and saison flavors (not as many as other complex BSPA). A tasty easy to drink beer. Definitely recommend trying this if you can find it. May not blow you away but it is solid, tasty, and will disappear faster than you may hope."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden orange/yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice one-finger foamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a good dose of yeast, green apples, pears, some spice. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty, very nice touch of pepper, coriander, some green apples, pears. Medium body, crisp. Very Drinkable, this one is a winner, very tasty. My last brew from Liquid Solutions, RIP."
"This is one of the better Belgian strong pale ales out there. Quite drinkable and certainly one worth trying."
"A very good example of a belgian pale ale. Wish I had more."
"This is very easy to take. Excellent."
"D: I was through my little bottle faster than should probably be allowed. There's a strong carbonated dry white wine theme at work here that I really enjoyed. My bottle was roughly two years old and had aged extremely well. A most excellent pickup."
"Mouthfeel - Very thick and quite carbonated."
"A bit viscous for the style to be honest, and it takes away some of the awesome refreshment you get from this brew."
"O: dark taste with tripel color/mouthfeel, very good, alcohol high but smooth, the more i have the better it is"
"D) Truly an excellent specimen of the category. Stock up."
"D - very easy drinker overall. the alcohol is well hidden and the mouthfeel is very 'more-ish' however I could see this one getting too cloying after a couple."
"Floral nose, citrus record but also with more subtle flavors of apples. It is at first sweet palate, a little spicy but it quickly becomes bitter for us to offer a persistent finish transmitting the palace of the bitterness and dryness. In the mouth, this beer is like an apple liqueur and accompanied by delicate flavors of rose, it stands out as a beer very well balanced, where high rates of alcohol does not supplant its flavor nor its delicious flavor."
"Drinkability: Big beer with hidden alcohol content. I'd serve this with scallops or shrimp scampi."
"Too strong for me and I had a terrible headache the following morning, this wasn't the only beer that night, but I am sure it did the damage."
"Pretty interesting... just seems a bit ""blah"" to be given a better review."
"D-Not very drinkable due to the abv, but after the beer really warms, it goes down real smooth."
"Overall: I'm afraid, not bad not good. Almost like a mead. Tastes like honey and booze mostly, but for 10% you get your $ worth. However for a belgian pale I think of lost abbey inferno and that's way more delicous than this."
"bottle poured into maredsous goblet. has nice golden hues, and a bigtime head that explodes out the goblet like a pillowy mushroom. smells fruity and boozy with peach and lighter fruit esters, and yeast on the nose. tastes very nice, good malt presence, tarty fruit flavors, with alcohol underneath. a nice sour/bitterness on the finish. has a full bodied mouthfeel with bitey carbonation. drinkability? its pretty strong, but its fine for the style."
"A good brew but the nose is weak. A brew more for the eyes and teeth than the nose and tongue."
"D: Great sipper; one must sip it to appreciate all the complexities and not let the aftertaste of phenols overwhelm you. Overall, a great crowd-pleaser: no strong or offensive flavors and appealing even to the non-beer-drinker."
"D-Above average. Good brew, smooth, complex, enjoyable."
"Drinkability is good but I find the alcohol somewhat distracting at the finish."
"Overall a great representation of the style and a standby classic that won't do ya wrong. Craving a belgian golden or a tripel? hit this one up. The price tag on the 750 isn't exactly one you could trip over, but that aside, a fine, solid belgian golden brew."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, this is definitely not one of the better Belgian-style beers that I've had. There are several others in the style that I would select first."
"Its a decent beer but expensive for it is."
"Overall, a wonderful brew. The alcohol makes it a little tough to finish a 750 by yourself, but it is worth the effort."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, some cloudiness. Huge white frothy head, diminishing, with good lacing. Light, floral, sweet aroma. Fruity like pears and apple juice. Some maltiness too. Dry sweet taste. Not overly strong, but some good flavor. Some light maltiness. Sweet fruity and floral taste. Some sharp bite, maybe the alcohol. Hides the 10% very well, though. Strong carbonation. Some spiciness, and a little alcohol as it warms more in the aftertaste."
"Had this after work tonight. Poured a hazy orange color with thick frothy off-white head that faded slowly and left good lacing. Smelled fruity and yeasty, and slightly sour. Tasted sweet, tangy, fruity and yeasty. Smooth and carbed well with nice alcohol warmth. Drinks easily, but no more than a couple."
"This was a surprise and a half. My girlfriend and I went to the liquor store looking for something new, and this was the only Belgian golden (one of her favorite styles) that we had yet to try out of the selection. I was skeptical but intrigued, so we gave it a shot. Both of us have found an instant new favorite, and most importantly, one that we can both enjoy together - Since she rarely likes the same ones I do."
"D- The high ABV limits the drinkability of this one, but it is a nice sipper. Overall, Malheur 10 is a solid beer that is definitely worth a try. Recommended!"
"Malheur means 'Misfortune'. I appreciate the Belgian penchant for sly humor in the naming of beer, but I feel extremely *fortunate* in having found this 750 ml bottle of Malheur 10. Oh I get it, it's irony. This offering is almost as good as Brouwerij De Landtsheer's biere de champagne, Biere Brut (Brut Reserve). Bottom line: this is an easy recommendation for all those who love big, bold BSPAs and tripels."
"I like the beer. It not one to have too many of in one night but a good strong beer to end the evening."
"Pour into a Duvel tulip glass from a 750ml bottle. Quite a bit of carbonation, with healthy looking head. Head is a creamy white but thins quickly, but does hang on side of glass as consumed. Color is an amber yellow. Aroma yields notes of some honey, but definite notice of alcohol notes. Warmth of alcohol comes at initial sip and as a long finish. Tastes of some honey and citrus. I consider this drink fairly drinkable, even with a 10%ABV, but like most within it's style, it can come and bite you in the end."
"There is a lot going on in this beer. It was definitely fruit overtones but I could not pin down. Seems to be a variety of things going on here. While fruity, it is not overly sweet which for me is a plus. Drinkable yes, but I could not have more than 2 at time."
"I really enjoyed this brew. A fine BSPA indeed, sweetness dissapates nicely as the brew warms, leaving the final few sips even more enjoyable."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with lots of floating sediment.. small little head to it, minimal lacing. Smell is boozy.. very boozy actually, as in it makes me almost cringe smelling it (and I've had DFH 120.. which is half the alcohol smell of this.) Taste is lots of alcohol taste... it overpowers about everything else in the beer. Taste is apple juice like, typical of any Belgian. Bleh, not very good.. if you're looking for a good Belgian I'd just go for a Unibroue for half the price and twice the taste."
"D: Very, very drinkable...especially considering the ABV. This is a nice light belgian beer. Good for a spring or summer picnic. This beer will do better paired with food than alone. If you are looking for a complex belgian, look elsewhere."
"Definitely a good beer, slightly overhyped in my opinion, but worth the try."
"This was a pleasant surprise. I added this to my single bottle sixer at the local liquor store not expecting to like it as much as I did."
"D: This is a beer that's solidly made, with some good attributes. Not my favorite of the style, but a decent brew."
"bottle labeled best by 3/10/09. not sure how old that means it is. golden colored, orange and yellow playing throughout, big but not too thick head that lasts a while. smells sweet, like peaches and mandarin oranges, with a yeasty zest. Same in the flavor, with some buttery (not diacetyl notes). Sweetness is very nicely balanced by the hops, though no hops detectable in the flavor. I get some honey notes as well, which usually comes when the paler strong beligians have some age on them. noticable alcohol flavor at the end but i wouldnt call it a burn. the alcohol is the only thing preventing the 4.5 on taste. finishes kind of dry. medium to high carbonation. a sipping beer, but not hard to drink at all. The BSPA style is pretty broad as far as I know, and this one leans more towards the tripel end than say, the duvel end. either way its a great beer."
"Drinkability; for a 10 pt beer this is curiously quaffable. Great beer. Better belgian I've had in a while."
"An excellent tripel with good spice and fruit notes. The beer pours a bright, slightly hazy yellow golden appearance with a big sticky head. The flavors are crisp with both citrus and spice. There is a greater hop presence than I've had before in a tripel. It doesn't dominate, but the presence of lemony hops is very nice. The feel is creamy and rich, and the alcohol is well-hidden but warming. It's a very good beer that drinks easily but should be savored for its complexity."
"Overall, a nice beer. Improved as it warmed. More mellow lemon and a tinge more alcohol showed up as I finished the bottle. This one might be worth splitting with a friend - I don't know if I'd seek it out for solo consumption, but it's not a bad beer by any stretch."
"An outstanding Belgian pale. I've had the Malheur 12 as well and was equally as impressive. It's a shame this brewery kind of goes under the radar (at least around where I'm from). This was one of the more unique brews (especially Belgian) I've had recently and was a pleasure to sip on."
"Poured a golden body with cloudiness and a voluminous soapy head that was about three fingers and took forever to die. Strong citric notes in the smell along with some spices and hints of dark fruit. Very mild malt smell. A fuller-bodied pale ale that not only contains some caramel/honey and other sweet, sticky malts, but had some spice to it along with both a citric kick and heavier fruits like orange. This beer goes down smooth and the 10% ABV is hidden quite well, as there is no alcohol burn and the backbite is pleasant. A very nice sipping beer."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong pale ale."
"My preference for pale belgians is slightly lower alcohol and more sweetness (ie; Tripels). There just isn't enough going on outside of basic pils malt and drying alcohol. Like I say, if you like Duvel, you'll love this."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Definitely warms as it goes down, though not as warming as a good RIS on a cold winter day, but still warming. Oily is right, when held in the mouth there is definitely an oily character to this one. Finish is semi-dry complimenting the earthy, woody flavor and aroma that is found in this beer. Body is medium-full. This is a beer I'd drink again, and I'll gladly finsih my glass, but its not one I'd like to pay around $15 a four for. Its a great beer, don't get be wrong, and definitely worth a try, but it just doesn't stand out to me as mind-blowing. Definitely a good beer, but not one I'd make a regular...or fall back."
"I could sip this all night, and I pretty much did. I drank this beer over the course of almost two hours and loved every sip. Not as complex as some BSPA's but I love how the flavor changes throughout the course of drinking this do to temperature changes and the introduction of more oxygen. Very good drinkability considering the ABV, which is scary. I could down two in the course of a night, then sleep like a baby."
"Pours a nice gold color, lightly hazy, with a white towering head that has been beaten to stiff peaks by the time it goes from the bottle to the glass. Aroma is lightly sweet and yeasty. Flavor is champagne and alcohol up front, with a yeastiness in the finish. Mouthfeel lingers on the back of the tongue."
"This is far and away one of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales I have ever had. It is wonderfully complex, if a fan of the style seek out! Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is great, this is an incredibly well made BSPA. So tasty and smooth, the alcohol is very well hidden, the light body and restrained flavors make it very dangerous!"
"Drinkability is amazing for a 10 percent abv. Great balance, awesome taste, and a smooth drink all the way."
"Swung over to Discount Liquor while my wife and I had a rehearsal for her college roommate's wedding. I have had the opportunity to try a Malheur Brut from a friend in the MJ Rare Beer Club so I was super excited when I saw this on the shelf for a reasonable price. This bottle conditioned strong golden ale pours out a glowing gold with a very slight haze. Heavy yeast sediment was left in the bottom of the bottle (initially). A thick quilt of airy, snowy white foam lay on top as it leaves traces of its remnants on the side of the glass. My Chimay chalice keeps a solid layer of foam the entire glass. A slightly peppery and yeasty aroma lifts from the glass. The nose is not super strong on this one, but it almost seems appropriately subdued. The flavor speaks for itself on this one. The sugary sweet and dry flavors match wonderful against the yeast presence. A strong finishing hop presence reminds you of the bitterness as it seems to blend so well with the other flavors. The heavy carbonation and bottle conditioning lends a creamy and delicate mouthfeel. An almost floral softness is balanced with a slight metallic feel. This is textbook strong golden ale at its finest. The popularity of Duvel and Delirium seem to overshadow all the wonderful goldens out there, but that is just fine with me. A gem like this should be enjoyed -and moderately with the 10% abv - and shared with those whom appreciate a lovely Belgian Ale in its finest form."
"D: Very drinkable and lighter than one might expect of 10% ABV."
"Palate is fluffy and warming on Belgian yeast, spice, finish is on yeasty bitterness, smoke, some tangerine and rust. Finish is a bit too sweet for my taste."
"taste is crisp, pear, apple, peach, and grape, not over sweet, yeasty, carbonation, and some citrus."
"Overall, a nice beer, one i've been needing for a while. I think its a good example for the style, with a saison bit of a twist. I like it."
"D: Could I session this? If I had two livers, possibly. A wonderful beer, worth the price of admission. I'm feeling like I'm on the top of the world and I'm barely half way through."
"Drinkability - This is a classic example of the style and is distinctive in its lack of distinction. There's nothing here that warrants a ""5" rating but it is a solid 4.5 in every aspect."
"I probably won't be buying another one of these, but not the kind of beer I would turn down if offered."
"This ale is a cloudy yellow color, with lots of foam. It actually foamed up out of the bottle when I opened it. Very thick head, very slow to dissipate, leaves a thin head behind. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is good, light and clean, especially considering the high alcohol content. You notice the high carbonation when drinking it, not just when opening it. A very drinkable beer, the only effect I see of the high alcohol content is the kick. I am not a big belgian ale guy, but I do like the stong pales."
"Extremely easy to drink. Nice and mellow and more flavorful than Duvel, but not as complex. Quite drinkable but BEWARE THAT CORK!"
"D - Very drinkable - delicious. But at 10% ABV, this one will knock you down with a velvet glove; I'm half way through this and can feel it already."
"Drinkability: Awesome all the way through. I'm thrilled I picked this up and wouldn't mind cellaring a few. I can't wait to try some more from this brewery if I can find some. Plus, the way it kept changing from 15 minutes out of the fridge to warm a bit (after being in there a few days... and it's about 85 degrees in Richmond right now, so 15 minutes on the counter wasn't too much) to where it is now is a remarkable thing."
"For 10% alcohol, I never noticed any of it in either the nose or taste, but did provide a slight kick after finishing. Definitely different, but not bad."
"D: The 10% ABV is barely noticed. A great appertif, as it is not too strong on the palate."
"Somewhat light bodied it seems, smooth as hell in the mouth and easily drinkable. I mean for a strong ale this is not at all a sipper. This one could fool a lot of people I'll tell you that much."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a massive two and a half inches in height, and recedes slowly into this think, chunky lacing. The aroma is of barnyard, leather, minerals, and a hint of orange peel. The taste has all the earthy, barnyard stuff from the aroma, with a strong citrus finish. It also has a moderately hot aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively, fine carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful beer that I will surely drink again."
"This is pretty tasty and quite refreshing, I thought, if that's possible for a 10% beer. Very nice. I'd have this again."
"Pours a cloudy, straw body with white foamy head. Nice aroma with some bananas and pears. Flavor is quite complex with a nice balance between the sweet fruit flavors and some malt. Packs a punch at 10 percent ABV, but it goes unnoticed in the taste. Overall, a good beer."
"Beer poured a clear golden body with slight white head but a nice little island floating in the middle. The aroma was of crisp citrus. Taste is interested with having a slighty tart character to it but also a nice sweetness, both balanced well by the other and making for a medium bodied beer. Crisp taste."
"Drinkability is nuts. Flavor is incredibly complex. I hope I can get more, and thanks bditty187 for the awesome recommendation."
"A nice easy beer that would be perfect for a novice or if you are in the mood for a small Belgian beer (that being said,the alcohol is quite well masked!)... good offering but..""seems a bit shallow and pedantic"""
"Recommended..."
"Way tto drinkable for a 10% beer. Great job."
"D: The strongest aspect of the beer is that you only know its 10% cause you read it... other wise you'd wonder where that funny drunk feeling was coming from... the taste is devilishly deceiving"
"Overall a great golden ale for Belgium. The nose is remarkably fresh and the flavors are a good mixture of a Westmalle Triple and a Pomperings Hommel. I could drink a lot of this, but I'm glad I saved my first bottle for the 3rd anniv. of New Beer Sunday."
"Lot's of unrefined sugar made the drinkabilty hard to swollow."
"This one poured with a gigantic, fluffy, white head that produced some soapy lacing. The beer itself was clear gold and fizzy. Good head retention. Very floral aroma with ripe peach notes and light alcohol. Mild yet solid bitterness with plenty of sugary sweetness, honey, peaches, and peppery alcohol. Medium to full bodied with plenty of carbonation, generous warmth and a good texture. Nicely balanced, quite flavourful and very appealing."
"Pours a hazy dirt orange color with a fantastic soapy white head that dissipated into a fluffy cap leaving lots of clingy lacing. The smell is of light Belgian candi sugar, tart green apple, and a touch of Belgian yeast/barn yard funk aroma. The taste starts off sweet with the candi sugar and has the typical Belgian yeast characteristics. This is followed by champagne like flavors. There is a hollow hop flavor and a noticable tartness in the end to round out the brew. At 10%ABV the alcohol is well hidden. The feel is fairly light and quite fizzy; again champagne like. The carbonation and tart flavors leave the palate on the dry side. Looks like a heady tripel but drinks like a BSPA and the high ABV is well hidden. It could use more of a Belgian yeast presence to add some needed flavor but overall a good brew. I'm going to cellar a few to see what the effects are."
"Pours with a translucent yellow orange color with a very foamy white head. Very carbonated. Poured into an Ayinger Celebrator fluted glass. Smells very fruity and tastes the same. Apple flavor with citric undertones. For a strong ale, this is awfully sweet and not what one would normally expect. Truthfully this tastes more like a tripel than a strong ale. All in all a fine offering, just a wee bit too sweet for my taste."
"For its potency, this is quite drinkable and refreshing. It is borderline to a Tripel with its bigger body. Overall, a very nice Belgian strong golden ale."
"Overall: A very drinkable beer, prefer it over duvel."
"Bottle from 2000. Pours hazy light gold with a massive, pillowy white head, so dense it never fades. Aroma is musty, sweet and fruity, with notes of spice as well. Pleasantly yeasty. Flavor is sweet, fruity and spicy, with some peppery notes. Alcohol apparent but very soft. Aftertaste lingers nicely, with sweet spicy notes and hints of the alcohol that was so soft in the flavor. Aging has done this beer extremely well. This is a true masterpiece of the brewers art."
"Recommended. An excellent, easy drinking Belgian Strong Pale. Give it a try."
"The good and bad here is that while this beer really hides it's strength well, the flavor doesn't come alive like similarly big Belgian. There's a mellow pale grain flavor to start that blends into a sharp Belgian spice and and noble hops. The hops are a nice touch, but the bitterness isn't lasting ans the flavors fade. I might be overly critical of what's actually a pretty nice beer, but I feel like the standards for a strong Belgian are just incredibly high."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a fun change from most normal beers."
"This is in my notes as ""Millenium 2000," so I'm not sure if it's actually 7 years old or it was a slightly different brew? Nevertheless, not bad! Pale gold with a big fluffy head. Aroma is faint (or maybe it was because this was sample #18), but lightly spicy (coriander and pepper), with hints of fruitiness (sour apple?). Flavour was yeasty, very mild spice, lower carbonation than I expected, and a decent mouthfeel. Quite drinkable considering the ABV."
"D: Really great considering its weight (the extensive cellaring undoubtedly helped)."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 330ml (11.2 oz) brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a champagne flute."
"Nice fruity orangey colour and significant head. Significant though not distracting carbonation. Yeasty aroma. Pleasant drinking. 2000 release. Well hidden alcohol by Citrus, pear and berry and bananna smooth. Finishes sweetish with sugar and honey. Medium mouthfeel. Nice."
"D - excellent Belgian golden ale, a very high quality beer that it's really a shame it isn't more widely available - this could be serious competition to Duvel - fantastic beer"
"This is a nice sipping brew! Another treasure from Belgium!"
"I enjoyed the Malheur 10 although it failed to ever really capture me; it's by no means the most impressive example of this wonderful style. But, like everything in the Malheur series, it's still something well worth buying, especially if you're a fan of Belgian Strong Pale ales."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow color that is active with carbonation and produces a terrifically tall bright white rocky head that sticks well. The tall head leaves a fine sheet of Belgian lacing in the tulip glass. The nose is quite lively - slightly floral, sweet honey and contains a bit of citrus as well. The palate is dead-on with sweet malts, floral hops and honey throughout. A pleasant sourness arises later on the palate. Mouth feel is medium and quite smooth, with some lingering alcohol in the back of the mouth. Finishes slightly alcoholic and acidic, but is really quite well-balanced for the most part. This beer was better than I expected it to be, to be honest. A fine example of the style and one I'd go for again."
"Clear golden yellow in the goblet, with a few inches of soapy head that stays around. Smells like coarse grains, tart lime and lemon peels, on a spicy alcohol backing. Husky, thick, and distressingly bland in flavor. Rough grains and hop bitterness up front give way to a muted lemon and powdered yeast center. Builds strong alcohol fruitiness and burn eventually, but you'll hardly notice this until the end of the glass since it builds so slowly. Beer is rich, almost chunky in the mouth despite a careful pour to avoid the yeasts. Drinks easily only because it's bland. Will have to try another bottle sometime since this sample didn't at all match with the other descriptions."
"Drinkability: For a 10% abv brew, this beer goes down exceptionally easy. Especially in the middle of August."
"I just love the way Belgian Strong Pale Ales come out of the bottle looking all foamy, begging me take a sip before I can finish typing up notes on how they look. Malheur 10 had that classic Pilsner float appearance down pat. The aroma was mild with a lemony and floral scent promising a subtle puch to come, so on to the first sip I went. The taste sweet, tart, earthy, and a little more bitter than anticipated. There was a lot of interplay between the dry, fully attenuated malt, the dusty yeast, and aged hops. The peppery hot alcohol was a lot more up front than the likes of sneaky Duvel, and there were no pretensions on this being a beginners drink. Mouthfeel was medium full and warming. This was a classy golden ale all the way. I will now be picking up more of their offerings, as one 330 ml bottle just won't do."
"I picked this up at Berman's in Lexington, MA of all places. The liquor store is definitely upgrading. The pour is prodigious. You'll get a nice cloudy orangy yellow with a very thick and frothy white head that retains and retains. The lacing is about as thick and long lasting as any you'll find. The smell is candied sugars, sweet malts, tangy fruits, and cloves. The taste is a burst of orange, full bodied, strong, sweet malts, typical Belgian candied sugars, some citrus, a bit of a yeast punch in the middle, a creamy mouthfeel, and an aftertaste that is warming alcohol and more lingering yeast. The downside is probably the aftertaste. That lingering, sweet, alcoholy yeastiness is what typically gives me heartburn if I have too many. L'Chaim"
"The feathery floral and citrus hints are pleasant surprises. It's got a subtle complexity that delivers a lilting, multi-dimensional flavor profile. The ABV is gaudy and bold, but the fuzzy warmth is a willing accompaniment. Basically, this is everything you'd want in a good, big Belgian, complete with some impressive highlights."
" Mouthfeel is soft and delicate, slightly creamy with a medium dry finish, perfect for the style. I think this makes a relatively good food beer for fish or even cheese and peppery crackers. Great interpretation of the style, very drinkable and pleasant."
"D: Overly sweet - could be better balanced. Limits drinkability."
"D: At ten percent, the most I'd probably drink is 3. I feel pretty satistied after just the one, but wouldn't refuse another."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and I actually like this version better than the Michael Jackson commemorative edition of this beer. This beer is pretty easy to drink, and is much more reasonably priced than some of the others in this line. I would drink it again."
"Pours a pale golden into an old style champagne looking glass from the brewery. Very healthy head and effervescence. Looks somewhat like champagne. Smell is delicate but full of nuanced aromas of nougat, honey, bitter hops, and apple. Very interesting. Taste is fantastic. Light honeyed malt and nougat up front, but dry, followed by a creamy sweetness, and finally a bitter, dry, hoppy finish. Light but creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Extraordinarily drinkable for the abv! Thankis to Brickstore Dave for this one."
"Overall Impression: This is a kick in the head. Alcohol is really raw, but held up by enough malt and other flavors as to make it bearable. This falls into my personal Belgian Malt Liquor category. You have to be in the mood for it, but its really not bad."
"Poured into a belgian beer snifter, the Malheur appears a pretty opaque golden hue with a full-bodied head that has serious staying-power and leaves some lace. I also see bits of yeast floating around in the glass and a strong, steady stream of carbonation rising up in the middle of the glass. The aroma is a pleasant spicy orange/peach aroma with hints of citrusy yeast and a smooth malty scent. The taste aptly follows suit, presenting heavy spice and orange and peach flavors. Also notable is a strong honey presence which balances the fruitiness quite well and mellows the whole thing out. Man, what a tasty beer this is. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a slight citrus tang. On the whole, this beer is highly drinkable. Forget the high alcohol (10% ABV) and just dive in. This is a brew to be enjoyed year-round, and should be just as easily consumed to celebrate a special occasion as it would a night in front of the boob-tube. High marks for this fine beer!"
"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a big yeasty white head. In the aroma coriander is present and alcohol. It has a alcoholic burn with flavors of coriander and a nice dry yeasty end. A nice smooth beer that gets bigger as it warms up. The only flaw was I feel it was a bit too much coriander, but that mellowed as it got warmer."
"Smooth, perhaps a bit light."
"Deceptive for the style and abv%, you could easily drink 2-3 of these, enjoying the mellowness it has to offer before you realize what kind of trouble you're in. Easily a session ale, although not recommended for those who have prior commitments the following day..."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, best before dating on the label (010209), pours cloudy, medium golden, with plenty of yeasty floaters present. Initially it lifts a huge white head, slowly receding to a thick film and leaving gobs of thick sheeting and intricate lace. Complex nose with hints of honey, pepper, and flowers. Tasty Belgian creation, plenty of pepper, floral, notes, yeasty nuttiness, some warming alcohol late. Love the style, this is a worthy example. Complex, easy drinking, bring on the summer salads, crusty breads and peppery cheeses."
"A pretty good beer but not a standout in this style. I would drink it again, but I would reach for others first."
"I poured it in a tulip glass, and man, oh man, did the foam come forth! At least four fingers of head on the glass, and when it settled, a it remained a respectable one inch. And it gave off a variety of flavor- the dominating was the slight horse blanket odor that many Belgians have. But the picture I had in the back of my mind as I drank was of a lemon-lime soda. It had the tang of a carbonated drink, but it was not fruity.I found little bitterness, but a distinct hop flavor lingered on the tongue. There was a tiny bit of sweetness that was very pleasant."
"Its been awhile since I have had a Belgian strong pale so I decided to go with this one for a fix,poured into a large tulip glass a medium to deep golden with a large blooming head that left alot of Brussels-style lace behind like in sheets.Somewhat mild in the nose not overly phenolic which in my mind is good,some light citrus fruit and honey notes mainly.Milder but quite flavorful the phenols are again in check pretty well with just a light clove note some refreshing tangerine and ripe orange flavors with a ""green"" herbal finish.This was a nice beer somewhat refreshing and light for such a big beer."
"It looks very nice in a chalice and, unlike the last few Belgian/ Belgian-style beers that I've had recently, the head calms down soon after the pour and maintains a perfect thickness on top of the beer."
"This is the first beer to really 'wow' me in nearly a year since the Chouffe IPA. Complex, interesting, and very very yummy."
"Drinkability- Now that the 10% ABV has numbed the lower half of my body, I must warn you that this beer is criminally sneaky. Drinking a 750ml alone for reviewing purposes is wonderfully exciting, but I would emphatically suggest a partner for the undertaking. This is Malheur's masterpiece."
"Overall, its pretty nice just too sweet for me to drink much of. The nice thing about it is that the sweetness tastes like honey (*not* implying they use honey in the beer) rather than just gobs of candy sugar like some Belgians/Belgian interpretations."
"Medium bodied, tingling mouthfeel to start things off. Notes of banana and pear with a touch of dough dominate the flavors to begin, but a blast of bitterness takes over as the sip progresses. Finishes with a bit of alcohol and the lingering bitterness. An intriguing beer that while enjoyable, I would recommend sharing, as the whole bottle is a little much for one to consume on their own."
"As far as the strong belgian pales go, this is a good example, but better examples are available here."
"The flavour varied nicely between sweet candi sugar, spicy coriander and bitter hops. The alcohol warmed, but never burned, going down, making this a fairly drinkable beer for 10 per cent ABV. If anything detracted from the drinkability, it was the overly dry, powdery finish."
"What a very nice beer, this should be in the top100, for sure."
"750 ml bottle from the Rare Beer Club has the Malheur 10 as a double blonde, which is about a year past the Nov 05 drink date but nothing I'm noticing in the taste reflects a problem with that. Pops up into a billowy white head and an aromatic spice and fruit nose over top a straw yellow beer. It has a good smell, but the spice and fruit really grow in the mouth. Nothing suprising about the beer--smell and taste--and you'll get the same elegant sensations in nose and mouth. Very fruity, apple like Budweiser but good, and yeast characteristic. Light malt but still a solid medium mouth feel. Clean, light hop characteristic throughout, and ends dry. Very good beer in a style that I'm not always that crazy about."
"Draft in proper glass at Kulminator in Antwerpen on 9/12/06."
"Drinkability- This was the perfect taster size. I can't see drinking a bomber of this stuff. Well, I can, and would probably enjoy it, but this size was perfect at the time. All around great brew here. Thanks Denali!"
"Big white head sits atop this semi-hazy ale. Dried fruit, mild funkiness, and yeasty aromas feature. The flavor profile is the biggest surprise here: hops a plenty! Surprise! Malt interacts with a semi-spicy not-too-bitter hop element! This is easy but so nice! The bottom line here is that I love Belgians with hops in 'em, plain and simple!"
"just finished this 2 hours later... I got a kick ass hops swell at the end with the sediment cloud... kick ass.. I swear it reminded me of cali/NW USA hops for a few sips.. interesting as hell... and man the ABV is now telling me ""get to bed dumbass"".... who am I to argue..."
"BB 13-04-07. Enormous head that lasts very well and a bronze beer that shows some haze. Very fine nose as all beers from malheur seem to have. Lots of fresh hops, apricot and citrussyfruits, wheatcaracter, alcoholic and litle peppered spicy. Yes again a good one from Malheur but taste is litle too sweet for me. Further very alcoholic, good taste combination of hops and malts that show litle caramel. Some spiciness with probably litle coriander and sweet gale. Mouthfeel is also very plesant accept for a maybe overdone sweetness. Carbonisation is very high and makes the brew fresher. Easy drinkable but you have to enjoy high alcohol content."
"Pours a hazy light orange color and makes a fluffy white head that lasts. Aroma smells a bit like a barnyard, very yeasty and hint of banana. Flavors starts with spicy, peppery bitterness and then turns to sweet bananas, clove and coriander, alcoholic bite in the closing. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a medium palate, has dense carbonation and finishes dry. So far, I have enjoyed every offering from Brouwerij De Landtsheer that I have tried, this one especially."
"Golden color with a huge, rocky, creamy head, many bubbles everywhere, going berserk, rising and falling having a good time. Big malt taste, alcohol, spiciness, fruity, yeasty. Not a lot of aroma, sweet, jellylike, fruity. Beer has lots of triple qualities. Very drinkable and tasty eer. Only prolem was that it was a tough pour with yeast all over the glass ut this did not take anything away from ther taste."
"Cloudy golden hue, white foam becomes a ring with nice belgian lace. Coriander spiced lemon pie aroma. Hay, cream, meringous, herbal, fruit esters (apple, pears). Very yeasty spicy palate, lots of coriander, cloves and pepper attack the tongue gently. Mostly sweet and alcoholic unfortunately with a light earthy grassy bitterness touch in the finish. Well defined fluffy/foamy mouthfeel from the high carbonation. Overall, it's pleasant enough to deserve high marks despite the few aspects I would change, it remains rather complex with well defined fruits and balancing bitterness unlike many poorer examples."
"The head didn't look too bad but it faded a bit quickly.The body is of a yellow golden color with lots of things in suspension. The smell is very dry and fruity, reminding me of fresh straw and white wine. The taste is dry and acidic, quite mouth puckering. Too much alcohol for me in there. Yeasty, light and aired, and very citric. Quite grassy too. Spicy and pepery. In spite of the dryness of the taste, the mouthfeel has a creamy character; I appreciated this combination. But I can't say that this beer is drinkable. 25cl is already too much for me."
"This is a good beer. Poured with a THICK foamy head. Cloudy golden color. The glass presentation is great. Smells good, but I can't pick out any individual aromas. Nice flavor. You can't tell that you are drinking such a strong beer. There is some taste that I just can't describe that lingers after you swallow. Smooth going down. Definitely could knock back a few of these in a row. I would buy this beer again."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a nice thick head. Aroma is quite hoppy and floral. Taste is also hoppy and floral with a hint of citrus (lemon, orange) with a bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden which Im starting to believe is a Belgian miracle. Good carbonation with standard body. Makes me want to investigate more beers from this brewery."
"Bottled 3/01. Best by 3/29/04. Looks like I was a day late! Gushed furiously upon opening the cork. Lost about 100ml of the 750ml. Fluffy, porcelain white head covers a hazy pale amber hued brew. Frothy, rough lace remains. Animated, dusty yeast aggregates in suspension. Green apple tartness offset by ripe, sugary peach upfront in aroma. Musty, sourdough like yeast presence. Becomes more vibrant in aroma as it breathes, with understated fermented pineapple and raw honey notes arising. Quirky, yet inviting aromawise. In flavor, the initial banana bread sweetness yields to a combination of honey dipped black licorice and clove. Sweetness reemerges promptly, albeit in a tracely cidery, light candi sugar nature. Bitterness is soft overall, but there remains a sharp, pithlike tinge. Overshadowed, underripe honeydew melon like tartness. Moderate in body, with a lightly syrupy, but not cloying mouthfeel. Finishes simply sweet with an abrupt minerally twang. Ethanol warmth pokes through the residual sugar after a several second deliberation. Perhaps not an ideal brew for aging, but it's nonetheless a fine, satiating brew. It lacked the dangerous briskness of many fine ""tripels"". I'd love to try this near the source."
"This was from one of the 750 mL bottles that was designated MM for the millenium. It has a big head and a spicy, hoppy aroma. THe body is light and refreshing and it finishes crisp and dry with the taste of fresh lemon zest. A spectacular beer, but I feel that drinking too much of this in a sitting would not be a good thing because it goes down so easily and packs quite a wallop."
"Very good beer!"
"Labelled ""Malheur Millenium."" Appearance: Blonde, cloudy, big head. Aroma: Hoppy, spicy and citric. Flavor: Delicious; frothy, crisp, refreshing. Some spices, I think. Somewhat like a Grand Cru.. Finish: Crisp, drying. Drinkability: Surprisingly easy-drinking for a 10% beer."
"Thanks for the Belgian ""hop bomb"" LongBeachBum."
"750 ml bottle cellared for 2 1/2 years (technically past the expiration date by 3 months). The initial glass is fairly clear, but it becomes quite hazy with subsequent pours as the rising carbonation stirs up the yeast sediment. A tall head of bright-white foam rises up over the golden-orange body as if it wants to escape from the glass. The retention is excellent, and it maintains a short, creamy cap and leaves some fairly solid sheets of lace throughout the entire glass. The nose is sweet with a light note of vanilla, a low-key fruitness, some peppery spiciness (alcohol?), and a surprisingly bright hoppiness! It's initially gently zesty on the tongue due to the combination of it's exceptionally fine and natural carbonation and light/medium body; but it becomes more cottony and lightly creamy as it warms across the palate. The flavor delivers everything that the aroma promises with some lightly fruity and sweetish malt up-front; a softer maltiness and floral hop flavor across the middle; solid, rising bitterness towards the swallow; and a distinctly dry and bitter finish that's heightened by a wash of peppery, drying alcohol. It lingers in the mouth with hot and peppery alcohol amidst the occasional reminder of sweet, honeyish malt or floral hops. It's quite charming, and leans towards a dangerous level of drinkability although the alcohol is noticeable enough to let you know what you're getting yourself into! Most likely worth trying!"
"The bottle is dated 23 05 04"
"(source: Great Beers of Belgium)"
"Cloudy lemon yellow color on the pour, the head creamy in texture and immoderate in size, the residual lace a fine satin sheet to seal off the glass. Crisp and fresh citrus like tones begin the nose, orange peel, and malt, lightly sweet and quite pleasant to sniff. Big sweet malt start, with a tartness that hits you at the top which is skinny in feel, finish ""Vinous", slightly sour, quite dry, biting acidity, a fine beer in its own right, drinkable and worthy of a try at least."
"Hazy gold with a white head that lingers to the bottom of the glass. The smell is a bit citrusy with hints of peach and noticeable yeast. The taste is delightful, full of peachy flavors and a bit of musty, horsy flavor. The mouthfeel is wholly satisfying and quite carbonated. Despite the 10% abv, it's dangerously drinkable. Thanks to LongBeachBum for the sample."
