"A bit too funky for me.  Nothing works, lots of rough edges.  Not smooth.  Rough around the edges."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer for what it was. Again, the balance is a little weird in the taste. Definitely an improvement on a pretty boring beer: Fat Tire. I wouldn’t go out of my way to look for it, but I would probably buy it again if it popped up and my pocketbook was feeling heavier than normal. I don’t think I’d really like to drink more than one at a time. So, grab a 22 oz. and share it with a friend."

"No head really on a murky orange and golden body with some lacing. Aroma of juniper, fresh flowers, orange peel, Belgian yeast and some candy sugar. Well the flavor is a little sour up front but smooths out quickly and finishes slight tart and mildly sweet. The one tastes like one of those multi fruit minute made fruit juices. Very tropical with mostly pineapple and tangerine with some peach. Belgian character is understated. Medium to thick body and moderate carbonation. This one is pretty unidimensional and hardly Belgian. This series has disappointed me again."
"D - Flabby and muddy, the yeast character is pungent but not particularly good. There is both a lack of crispness and a somewhat harsh bittering component to this beer. I'm not sure quite what they were hoping for here but they don't seem to have pulled it off."

"O: Overall I appreciate this for it uniqueness, but it's just ok for me. I would definitely recommend letting it warm a bit before drinking."
"Overall ok but not great, decent flavors that seemed to have gone a bit out of control with too big esters and phenolic flavors, although they should be there just seem a bit too much, and too boozy, just too much going on with this it wasn't really sure where it wanted to be."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It aged really well."
""
"O - A delicious brew. The booze will sneak up on you."
""
""
""
"I found this as a real treat. The Belgian twang seemed to mesh perfectly with the sour component from the Asian pear juice. Unfortunately I can’t speak to how cellaring affected the palate, but is certainly didn’t hurt it. I can say the 10% ABV was virtually undetectable."

"D - A solid beer, but not much more than that... This one takes some risks which are appreciated, but the end result is an average at best offering... Compared to its Belgian Strong Pale Ale brethren this one pales in comparison... The 10% ABV is a bit heavy handed, especially given that the overall enjoyment is a bit lacking..."
"My borscht and vodka have arrived. Maybe that will help..."
""
""
"Happy 21st!"
"Beer is medium to light in body, sweet and a little dry on the end, it is a decent beer, not great but a nice big Belgian ale. I might even have it again."
""
""
""
"O: I think I see what they are doing with this beer it's a of beat ale that plays with the pallet but enjoyable but not sessionable"
"o - one of my favorites. Easy good drinking. Sweet and tart, one of a kind."
""
""
""
""
"Good, but not great. Poured at a good temperature with a nice, foamy, tan head that soon settled and a little lace. Color is a clear orange amber with plenty of tiny bubble trails. Aroma is somewhat muted, but with yeast, bread dough, malt, hint of fruit. Flavor's similar to nose; good balance between sweet malt and yeast products, carbonic tang, and hop/yeast bitter. Body is good; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor with tang and alcohol warmth finishing."
""

"M: Sweet, hoppy, juicy, musty. Plenty of adjectives describe the ale but nothing ever comes together nicely."
""
"Thick, syrupy, medium to full body. soft carbonation. A little heat as it warms. I don't know how i feel about it. It's ok. It's different and not really what I was expecting. The first sip was very tart and caught me off guard. The flavors here aren't too complex."
""
""
"Overall: Not a very big fan of this beer. I don't think I would have any more."
""

"*First I wrote “tangier” but I thought that’d be confusing at first glance to anyone with a sense of geography."
""
"Drinkability isn't too high to me. It taste like an over-aged trippel. Maybe just the pear juice. Regardless, not digging it."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a reddish amber color with a white head which is short lived. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, with pear, banana, some sweet malts. The feel is medium higher carbonation. The taste leaves a little bit to be desired, a little sour taste, pear, sweet malts, definite alcohol taste/burn."
""
"D ~ Too hot! This beer is not together at all. Hoped for MUCH more than was deliver. This is Strike 2 for the ""Cru"" beers of the Lips of Faith series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too sweet for me and very much like fermented fruit juice."
"22 ounce bottle, the bottle is stamped with 4-14-2011. I guess that's the bottled on date, but I'm not exactly sure of that. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a mostly clear orange/amber color with about an inch light tan head that sticks around for a bit. There's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like pears, bready malt, candy sugar and a bit of sweet spices. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the flavors don't seem quite as strong for some reason. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and is well carbonated. It's a solid beer, but not something I would buy all the time. But I think it's worth trying."
""
""
"Overall a very mild tasting Belgian Ale, which was a little astringent, a bit fruity and had a strong alcohol presence."
""
"D: This was a nice BSPA with good scent and taste and body. The alcohol was pretty well hidden, so it was easy to drink. Nothing special but easily enjoyable. Recommended fresh."
""
""
"This looked like a Flanders Red ale, which might explain my sour cherry taste. I didn't get any pear flavor like the other reviewers. When I sat down to think about this review, I realized this was basically an Imperial Fat Tire aged in oak barrels. That turned me off a bit, but for the illogical reason that I like to be surprised by the brewer's creativity. This really would have been a better beer if they kept the oaky flavors more muted. I like some oak, but a little goes a long way. An interesting, if unremarkable beer."
"bright golden copper body with a thin off white head that quickly fades to a thin white ring. smells like bready biscuit malts, pear juice, yeast and spice. the bottle says they started with fat tire and doubled the malts, and that's what it tastes like. big bready flavor with pear and spice. hops are fairly well hidden. mouthfeel starts heavy with all the bread flavor but finishes softer and smooth with a creamy feel. has decent carbonation and a dry finish with hints of spice. overall i would say i'm not impressed and probably wont buy this again."

"O - Belgian-styled? Meh. Strong? Meh. It was a good idea but I think it might have sounded better on paper as the ingredients didn't blend of shine as much as I had hoped. Still a good beer though, just tough style to compete in."

""
""
""
""
"O- This is great ""sitting around drinking"" beer. Good with a cigar or during a cookout."
""
"jd"
""
"O - I'm completely in the minority on this one, but I found Super Cru to be very solid across the board. Nothing like Fat Tire save for the bike depicted on the bottle, not that it was supposed to be. Complex and unique, I find it a good brew worth picking up."
""
"O - this might be the worst new Belgium beer I've had. I don't know what else to say."
"O= a decent first-attempt offering. I'm hoping they can bring a little more refinement and focus to this on the next round."

"Wow - a rare complete miss from New Belgium on this one. Candy sweetness and rampant fruit mixes with a serious alcohol presence to give this a flavor more akin to something you find at a frat party in a cooler with random pieces of fruit floating around in it. I am already wondering if I can finish the bomber after the first 5 sips or so. The toffee malts are just way out of place here and the alcohol is very rough and raw. Bad, bad beer that I surely will never buy again. I might not even take one for free if offered."
"(reviewed 10/23)"
"Taste is instant raison and dried cherries...molasses and malt undertones. Its very strong and you can feel it. It feels like that little box of raisons enjoyed in my lunch bag as a child has just punched me in the mouth..in a way where I'm not mad. Its a great sipping beer. I'd imagine this to be great next to a warm fire with a pipe. Save this drink until you find yourself next to that fire...pipe optional."
"O: The good of this beer just doesn't overcome its failings."
"Overall, okay, but not something I would drink again. Just not that tasty for being what it is and the abv it's at."
"An alright example of the style, nothing too exciting here"
"Overall I think this is definitely one of the strangest beers I've ever had, but definitely in a good way. It was very ambitious what New Belgium did with this, but to me it pays off."
"This is some good stuff. Very complex and intricate. Just a little too tart for my taste. Still very enjoyable."
"Overall a pretty decent beer, abv is well hidden. It was a fun beer to try - happy 20th to New Belgium!"
"I thought the Super Cru was an average offering. It's distinctive in flavor, but not very special in delivery. It's a little too sweet and while I like the idea of the pear juice, I wasn't quite as big a fan of the execution here. Would I drink it again? Yes. Would I necessarily request it or reach for it...not so much. An interesting idea that went a little unrealized."
"Truth is that I’ll read this review a year from now and probably forget I drank the beer. Let’s just say that I drank and reviewed it during the Det/Tex MLB playoff game. That has nothing to do with the beer but perhaps a reminder for me that I actually drank the beer. (you will probably forget it too)"
"Notes: Nothing to write home about but pretty pleasing, it is a notch above common offerings and it flows pretty well as a more elaborate brew for people not so familiar with craft brews, and as a step to entice them into more complex brews. In that context, socially, it might be worth the repeat…"
"D: This beer hides the alcohol better than any that I have ever had. When you begin to feel it, it's too late. Whether that is well done on the brewer's part or not is up to the end-user."
"Overall-Interesting beer that I enjoyed alot towards the end of the drink. Interesting beer that changes alot throughout the drink. Sip it and enjoy."
"Overall Impression- Quite the brew! Not sure why this is rated so low but I thought it was a great Lips of Faith beer! The 10% is definitely evident within finishing the 12oz glass even. Good complexity and the right amount of strength. Would definitely go back to and get a bottle of. Go grab yours while they are left!"
"For a sweet 10% beer, Super Cru remains delicate in feel, complex in composition, and very drinkable. And it doesn't resemble Fat Tire in the slightest (which is the foundation of this beer, according to the bottle text)."
"The mouthfeel feels a bit heavy for the style and carbonation is on the higher side. Overall it was a drinkable beer, but not a great one. The pear juice and spice flavors just overwhelmed the beer flavors for me. Would have really liked to see more of the double fat tire flavors come through more."
"It's a bit of a mixed-up mess, but experiments are gambles sometimes, and not everything is for everyone. Not perfect, not amazing, but very interesting, and tasty, for sure."
"Big beer brewed with Asian pear juice. Shiny copper color; two-finger head drops to a thin ring of lace. Some vague floral fruitiness meets spiciness, with medicinal herb and alcohol in the nose. Some smoothness, slick with a big body. Mild tartness with a thick malty foundation, and a hint of sweetness up front. Toasted bread and ripe fruit soon make way for a more toasty, dry, almost broth-like flavor. Spicy, boozy alcohol, rose water and tropical fruit. Semidry finish clings to the booziness. A serious beer if strength is considered, though beyond that, it lacks a bit of depth that was expected. A tasty brew nonetheless."
"Overall. Not as super as I was led to believe, but nothing really wrong here. I didn't hate it, but won't buy again."
"O: NB's Lips of Faith Super Cru is a pretty tasty brew. I liked it for what it is: an American interpretation of a Belgian Pale with a hearty dose of pear juice. I don't know if I'll be rushing back to this often, but I certainly did enjoy my half of the bomber."
"Overall not bad just little too much pear juice for me, would probably be good or better if they just left it out."
"Quite sweet bordering on cloying. I could appreciate the pear flavors in this, but it just didn't work for me, pretty much a mess."
"Pours a nice amber/orange color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Plenty of carbonation, and decent lacing on this beer. Very clear in appearance and very easy to see all the way through. Nose is yeast, malt, pear, apple... Hops are surprisingly absent so far in the smell. Maybe once it warms a bit. Yes, they're coming out w/ warming. Taste is unique, and slightly strange to me. The hops show up a bit, but it's mainly pear juice and malt that I get, w/ pear juice being on the strong side. Everything seems just a little out of balance to me. It's not horrible, it's just not great. Mouthfeel is syrup smooth, and very sweet. Not a lot of complexity in this category. Overall, this beer is just a little off. It sounds like a good idea when you read the description of the beer, but the end result just doesn't quite make it."
"Pours somewhere between copper and amber with plenty of active carbonation and thinnish, cream-colored head. The aroma is malty up front; lots of caramel and toffee notes. Sweet, fruity notes come up after - apple (or pear, I suppose), a touch of cherry, slight citrus fruit. The flavor is very sweet right away - lots of caramel and fruit notes - strong pear and cherry notes, turning a bit sourish with a touch of hops coming in at the end along with a hint of yeasty spice notes. A very full body from the intense sweetness; the carbonation helps lighten it up a bit but not nearly enough."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Nice anniversary beer. Grab a few and lay them down for a few years. Not representative of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Not sure it has a definitive style, though."
"D - quite easy drinking for something at 10%abv."
"A solid beer in my opinion. It's not going to make it's way onto my favorites list, and at the price I probably won't buy it again. However, I don't regret spending the money to try it."
"Overall not much going on here. I love Asian pears, but I get no sense of this on here at all. Greeny apple like taste come more apparent as it warms. It's not too bad but I do not see myself gravitating to this strongly."
"Lips Of Faith Super Cru is good in a fruit-tart-with-whipped-cream kind of way."
"O: Ridiculous and un-palate-ful beer. I poured the rest out."
"Feels a little heavy handed on the sweetness, but the base recipe is a pretty straightforward, 90's era ""microbrew"" amber ale, so I guess that makes sense. I can appreciate the tribute to the beer that built the brewery, so I'll take it for the artistic homage that it is. I enjoy a Fat Tire, and it's a lot of fun to see what happens when a flagship beer is used for inspiration in the more creative endeavors.."
"O: Well, it's beer. But the yeast is overbearing and does not allow the juice to come through to the extent I hope they intended. with a really sweet malt profile and no alcohol burn, this beer becomes lop-sided in favor of decadence vs drinkability."
"Just a little too much going on."
"Decent and not terrible, but not something I would have again."
"Been lookin' at the bottle for some time, figured I'd just rock the tap at the Firkin. It pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, sourdough, light tart black cherry, light roasted malts, and light maple syrup. The taste holds notes of maple syrup, light wood (an amalgam of oak and balsa), light roasted malts, light coffee, toffee, mandarin orange syrup, and a twinge of green apple skin. Something akin to maple-smoked bacon is in there, too. All told, it's not the greatest taste combination I've ever experienced. The body is a straight medium, with a light medium carbonation and a nearly syrupy feel. Overall, though it's not an entirely bad beer, I feel it is definitely misnamed. I didn't hate it, but I sure as hell don't want another one."
"Clear reddish brown pour without much head. The smell is pretty Belgian, caramel malts, some candied sugar, sweet overall. The taste follows the smell, candied sugar, lots of malts. This is boozy and has an off-putting aftertaste, not unlike Kick. Light and carbonated well. Honestly disappointed. Thought these lips of faith beers would be better."
"Overall, very good. The faint pear sweetness adds something I don't normally find in this type if beer and I like it, it decreases the alcohol warmth and takes the edge off some of the spice flavors. Very drinkable for a high alcohol beer."
"This Belgian comes out of the tap a dark honey golden with a fine-bubbled pale honey-golden head. Rich, fruity aroma has a hint of caramel. Lip-smacking flavor is malty and fruity and has caramel, honey and woody hints. Full-bodied texture is fizzy and sassy."
"O - This is tasty. It may not be what you expect going in, but is still is pretty nice."
"Medium amber color beer, with a small, quickly fading head (looks about like Fat Tire). Fairly fruity nose, with a solid malt presence. Yummy flavor. Good initial malt gives way to extremely fruity yeast taste, on the order of Chimay Grand Reserve, or perhaps beyond it; some of it may be the pears, though I don't taste pear notes specifically. Hops are provide a great balance to the sweetness of this very strong beer. There's a nice subtle tartness as well. Spicy phenols make for a nice finish."
"Overall- I like the interesting concept, even though I am not a big fan of Fat Tire. This beer had potential, but falls short in many ways. Does it want to be a sour? A stronger fat tire? A fruit beer? A saison? It doesn't matter that its not brewed to a specific style, but there is little direction overall and it all doesn’t come together too great."
"Super Cru is not the model of the Belgian Pale Ale style; fruity, sweet and lacking any real hops character. Meh, proabably wouldn't have again, especially at the price."
"D - Very good. I think this is my favorite lips of faith so far. Asian pears always taste like a mix of honey and pears to me, so their presence is felt. This is a great brew."
"It pours a dark orange/ amber color with a thin off white head. The aroma is dominated by a clove spice and fresh pear, in the background is caramel malt and lemon hops. The taste is very sweet with pear juice right up front, following is Belgian yeast, clove, alcohol and lots of bready malt. The beer is medium bodied with low, soft carbonation and a warming finish. I thought this was a decent beer, the texture was like juice as it warmed up and the saison yeast added a nice touch."
"Pours decently with a transparent orange and a slight pure white head. The aroma is a bit hot, and sweet as well. Vaguely fruity, but I couldn't tell you if it's Asian pear- the smell is simply not delineated enough. The taste is similar. Better when it's cold- when it warms up it tastes a bit like cheap fruit juice, of indeterminate fruit, laced with vodka. A bit harsh in the mouth as well, with a slight acetone finish. I'd give this one a miss."
"Its a bit too strong for me, the belgian spices are just too much to enjoy."
"T: Some cinnamon, pear and apple. A slight bit of malt on the finish. As the beer warms, the finish gets a bit off and a bready, yeasty and slightly metallic flavor comes in."
"O: It tastes more or less as advertised: double Fat Tire with belgian yeast and added pear juice. The flavors do work well together, but the pear juice was something different my palate adjusted to during the course of my pour. As the last few posters have noted, I'm not sure why this has such horrible ratings, even much much worse than that of Fat Tire. It is certainly a better, more complex beer. My only qualms were with the fact that 10% abv tasted and felt like 15%."
"An interesting take on the regular fat tire recipe. Not bad at all..."
"I don't know what everyones problem with this beer is... Maybe that it's brewed with a non-traditional yeast, but that's what makes it unique. The beer pours a nice red color with a finger of off white head that retains and laces very well. The aroma has hints of banana, caramel and Clive spices. The taste starts caramel sweet, then has hints of banana and those spices. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and finishes clean... Definitely no hint of the high alcohol content. Overall a very good beer."
"O: This is tasty if you're in the mood for a super fruity beer. Not sure if it's got all the qualities for the style but I thought it was great."
"O- A good beer. Not the greatest but appreciate New Belgium thinking outside the box with their Lips of Faith series"
"On tap at my work. Pours a clear, copper-amber color with a small, white head. Scent is packed with pear juice and spicy zest. Belgian yeast aromas hit the nose with a lot of fruit and spices. The taste is a little overwhelmingly sweet with all the candied fruit flavors and sweet pear juice. The Belgian yeast flavors provide a bit of balance but not much. This beer seems to be a little unbalanced and all over the place. A bit boozy too, especially as it warms up. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and a little syrupy, which kinda works to this beer's advantage IMO. Drinkability is fair, as it is overly sweet and boozy. Overall, this beer is definitely not even close to being one of my favorites in the LOF series. It is worth a try, but I will not be drinking more of this stuff."
"This is a bit odd; I'm not sure exactly what it's trying to be. It's too dark and rich to really be a tripel or a BSPA, but it's certainly not in the Quad/BSDA category either. I don't mind oddballs, but they need to taste good. This one was overly sweet and lacked balance. Not horrible, but spend your ten bucks elsewhere."
"Overall I have had better."
"On tap at the Clips of Faith event in Santa Cruz. Pours a shimmering copper color with an off-white head. Candied fruit aroma, bananas, straw, and pepper. Flavor is pears and bananas drenched in honey/caramel, vanilla, pumpernickel bread, tart/acidic boozy finish. A strange beer, decent in sample size as a dessert type of thing but not a very quaffable drink. Much too sweet."
"I had to sort of force the rest of this beer down since the flavor was absolutely not doing anything for me."
"O: Not horrible, but nothing here really stood out to me and made me want to drink more."
"Narrative: “Why are mommy and daddy fighting?” Baby Apple Brandy wondered as she watched her parents tear apart their small abode. “OH OH OK THIS IS RICH! NOW IT’S….CAN I FINISH? LET ME FINISH!” Papa Brandy was in one of his booze filled rages after a family outing. It had been chaos since they stepped into that Macaroni Grill and the din of excitement had now reached its sweet fever pitch. “Oh…SURE SURE….revert back to that, let’s focus on THAT ONE TIME AGAIN!” Mama Apple was brandishing a large cutco knife and threatening no one in particular. Baby apple brandy attempted to reconcile this hectic environment with her chaotic upbringing. No one wanted to visit, no one wanted to stay, but Baby Apple Brandy still had high hopes for later aging."
"O: Pretty smooth considering the abv, yet this is still bordering on a hot mess of a brew... that being said, it’s still an interesting sipper; lots of crazy flavors going on for sure."
"This beer is OK. It is a Belgian with a slightly odd fruit taste that doesn't really stack up to other Belgian beers. Even on its own, it is just OK. Not mandatory by any stretch."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch white-orange head that fades to a thin cap. Nice rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of normal Fat Tire with the biscuit-like malt along with some light fruit aromas and Belgian yeast. Taste is of Belgian yeast up front with the biscuit malt and slight pear flavors coming afterwards. There is a spice taste that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer in my opinion. I am not sure why the overall scores have been so low. To each his own."
"I have to admit, I wanted to dislike this beer more than I did. It's weird and unnecessary, but not undrinkable."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large off-white head. The aroma is a mix of herbs and spices, with some toffee, brown sugar and fruity notes mixed in. The flavor is heavy on the Belgian yeast with some pears and cherries. I also get some bready malt and candy sugar, as well as a healthy dose of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Fairly drinkable for a beer that is 10 percent ABV."
"Overall, I didn't really care for this. It's an amped up overly sweet Fat Tire with some fruit juice and a little more Belgian yeast (banana). So lots I don't really care for - sweetness, banana, and biscuit malt."
"Final thought - I like this beer. If you like beers I like, you'll like this beer"
"O: Very disappointed. I love Fat Tire. This was nothing at all like Fat Tire. I'd rather have a case of Fat Tire than drink one of these again. Wish I could say better things about it, but it just didn't work for me."
"Overall: It's sweet, it's a bit boozy, and fairly fruity, but not quite cloying or hinderingly brash, keeping it a fair, so-so sipper."
"O: Not a big fan of this beer, but it was free due to the waitress messing up my order."
"A clear light amber in color with no head. Smells of phenolic, peppery yeast. Taste is initially sweet light caramel, followed by an herbal, medicinal, lemony middle and finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Decent drinkability, this is kind of a wierd beer, pretty good though."
"A sweet, syrupy, heavy Belgian that seems to miss the mark."
"Taste is... not good. I get the pears a little bit, along with quite a bit of burn. The first sip was not so bad, but this was not a fun one to finish. Way too harsh and some solvent flavors. Unfortunate that NB feels this beer should be called Super Cru."
"A pale amber with a lemon ice colored head. The belgian yeast dominates the nose with a ittle bit of crushed pear. Lots of asian pear on the palette. The beer is fairly smooth with a nice fruitiness and light body. The juicy pear finish is sweet and hides the high alcohol well. Certainly tasty and not deserving of the C rating imo."
"Good lord, what happened here? Super Cru appears like it should, starting out with a leather-mahogany color, frothy head. Doesn't smell too bad either; nice Belgian yeasty notes and the added pear. But man, does this taste awful. I'm not going to go into detail on this one, doesn't really deserve it, but this tastes like someone dumped pear juice into Fat Tire. Treacly and boring at the same time. I'm not sure how this was grouped with the Lips of Faith series."
"I did"
"Sweeter than expected and would be better classified as a tripel. A bit phenolic and solventy at first, but smoothes out after a bit and was enjoyable."
"Not that great, but not a drain-pour. Can't taste the ABV but you sure can feel it."
"O: It is interesting with the play between sweet, bitter and acerbic. It may be too much for some, but I think it's interesting and worth a drink."
"O: This might be a bit young, its completely all over the place, and doesn't really do a whole lot for me. This will be better with some time, it will be interesting to see how this is in another year. Right now its pretty mediocre."
"just had the lightest of aromas. Some nice yeast though, with the essence of apples and pears coming through, a touch of apricot in the back. Some light grassy like hops floating around as well. Not bad, just too light. Definitely some grain in here to. I have seen better, though it was still decent. Not being really bad in anyway, just way too light for my tastes. There was a nice presence of fruity yeast, but you almost had to look for it, which was unfortunate. Hints of pears and apricot again, maybe some light apple. Nice bit of grainy like flavors and a touch of grass in the finish. A decent profile for sure, just way too light for me. No hint of the alcohol, which was good, but it was just rather bland."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light with very low carbonation. Very forgettable."
"This beer pours a light bodied, very clear and translucent bright copper in color with a one finger off white head. It looks like it may even be filtered. How can any ""Cru"" look this clear? It smells god awful. It smells of fermenting rotten sweet pears. I didn't know I was composting in my glass. Great. It tastes of rotten, fermenting pears with a touch of alcohol and honey. It's so light in body and the style and the alcohol content. I don't know what they were aiming for but they missed horribly. At 10.49 a bottle, this is one of the worst beers I've ever had, especially for the price point. I wish they'd take a moment to improve their Lips of Faith series. Le Terroir was and is phenomenal, their Dunkel is good, La Folie is exceptional, but everything else is low grade. This ""Super Cru"" never should've been made. How did this get approved? AVOID! I wouldn't drink this again if it granted me eternal life or provided me with an opportunity to slap Ronald Reagan."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, earthy malt, alcohol, and hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy malt, slight hop, slight wood, and hint of citrus. Overall, good blend and decent aroma."
"Creamy and smooth. Will most likely climb in complexity and richness if aged."
"D - Overall I was very impressed with what this drink had to offer; delicate balance of fruit, malt and sugar tones; could have another one"
"Opinion: Again, I am certain that this beer was just sold early as you really can't condition a beer this big long enough at the brewery. I would not deter you from getting this beer as about 5 years in a cool cellar (or refrigerator) would do wonders for it. As it is, it is a bit hard to drink. The yeast is just too strong and is not playing well with the rest of the beer. As it is, I will be scoring this one a bit low too, but I am taking in mind the potential that this beer has too. There are no fermentation flaws to kick it out except maybe that the yeast ran a bit hot for my taste, but this will soften with age too."
"overall: A good beer. Nice nose, a decent taste with no distinguishing features."
"Not particularly successful as a Belgian ale of any sort, this is still an interesting conglomeration of sessionable amber ale with vague hints of saison."
"The body was good, solid without being heavy, full and nicely rounded. Drinkability was good, especially for a bigger beer. Overall, a very nice beer. If I see this in bottles I may set a couple aside to let the hotness smooth out. Worth trying if you see it."
"I am somewhat surprised by the lower scores on this one. It falls right in with the style and to me is done very well. As it warms I tend to enjoy it more. A lot going on at some points but still good the whole time. But, that is the joy of this site, to each their own."
"Yeah, tartness is a good word for the flavor too. Almost too much so. The pear is overripe or something. I've had Asian pears and these in this here beer are past their prime. Or perhaps they don't blend well with the yeast or malt. I don't know, but it doesn't quite work out. The malt is firm and rich, but then turns a bit sour. Is this a sour ale? It misses on the BSPA style for me."
"O: This beer sounded very interesting so I had to try it. Things start off pretty good but the flavors compete a little bit and the finish is a bit unpleasant. Definitely earns points for being unique."
"Drink- Well, it's a tasty beer but below my expectations. The fruit was up front with the malts on the back. Seems like a lot of juice with some beer. And of course as I finish the 10% comes into play. Damn!"
"O: Good concept perhaps but not done to its potential. Esters and malting are a bit too powerful ... but then I'm picky."
"O: The beer isn’t that easy to drink and needs to be sipped very slowly given its strong flavors and high alcohol content."
"O: Not the greatest beer in the world, but I don't see where the early C+ is coming from. This is solid American Belgian-style beer."
"Very enjoyable, and well done. Not much of a pale ale, but very good none the less. Something I would recommend."
"O- This beer was not my favorite from New Belgium yet it is also not the worst thing I have had from them. They are a company that is a love and hate thing for me in the Lips of Faith department. I wish they would stray away from the tootsie roll malt that seems to be their base as it messes up too many of their LoF beers. Other than that I didn't mind the two or three step beer that I poured. The ABV makes it a little hard to drink a full 22oz but I think the blending could have been done a little better as well."
"I like this better as I sip awhile. Seems a little coarse at first taste. Hot with alcohol and reminds me of a dark rum splashed with water. Surprising lightness of body, with a carnival of fruity flavors balanced with the dark, toasty Belgian taste."
"MF: A spicy, slow-drinker. Not huge in body or flavors, but each sip still warrants savoring and contemplating."
"O: Meh. Nothing pops on this, the flavor profiles fall short and it seems just like a bad attempt at a beer and it's sorry to say because I love New Belgium."
"mouthfeel is similar to a decent soda with alochol added"
"Overall – Worst $10 ever. I know the store I was at was a bit pricy in general, but I wouldn’t buy this if it was three bucks a bomber. Just not a very good beer, plain and simple."
"Firm up the body here; clearly just doubling the recipe isn't working to keep the balance in check. The yeast able to eat its way over 9% abv can clearly make short work of the Fat Tire malts. Furthermore, I wouldn't stick with the pear juice either. This seems to be a case of jamming 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag, before seeing if the bag can handle 5 pounds in the first place. Skip this one until they get the recipe correct."
"O- wont try this one again one and done,,just had a brandy and fruit taste to me with no character just a mess"
"This one poured a nice amber color with a perfect finger of slightly off-white head. Beautiful. Sadly, it was downhill from there. Aromas of yeast, green apples and pears. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of apples, lemon and pears."
"Medium bodied with spirited but not aggressive carbonation."
"Finish is total French Whore Perfume. Oh God, it just won't go away."
"turrible."
"Pours a copper/amber color, super clear and clean, with a nice big tan head. The nose is big saison yeast, complimented with a touch of sweet apple, pear, and biscuit malt. Nothing too impressive. The flavor is sweet with big flavors of apple and pear. That biscuit malt flavor from fat tire is present as well as a bit of spice and that saison yeastiness. Its kinda like a really sweet, fruitier version of fat tire, missing just a bit of that richness. The mouthfeel is nice, with good, not too aggressive carbonation and a sweet, but not overly coating finish. Overall, this I not quite what I expected, and yet I am not sure how it would have worked otherwise. The sweetness could be toned down a touch and replaced with more of that signature rich malt flavor from fat tire. But I'm nitpicking. I though this beer was alright and am somewhat surprised by the average score."

"Edit: Gets solventy as it warms and loses some flavor. Drink it cold. Points docked accordingly. It was great initially!"
"This sounded great, but I was disappointed. Flavors did not meld well together and it is somewhat astringent."
"It's really hard for me to say I'm disappointed just because I think this probably is what it's supposed to be and is what I expected. It's not really good or bad, but at $9-10 per bottle it's something I can't imagine many beer geeks going back to."
"O: I don't know what New Belgium was thinking, this is their 20th anniversary beer? I was sooo excited for this beer, as New Belgium makes some amazing lips of faith beers, but I feel like they could've done something more special for their anniversary. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad beer, definitely not a drain pour or anything, I just was expecting more. I'll finish the bomber but that will probably be the last time I have this beer."
"I found it odd that NB decided to use Asian pear juice, while a unique ingredient Asian pears are special due to their crispness and texture not their command of flavor. Bad investment even at 8.99 a bomber, the recent Lips of Faith have been excellent but IMO this is the biggest let down since Vrienden, lacks the balance, body and sessionable feel which Fat Tire brings to the table. Not a drain pour but not really worth seeking out again. It's your 20 year anniversary NB next time let's celebrate with a party not a hangover."
"22 oz bomber. Beautiful copper red pour with a nice foamy head that dissipates slowly. Descripted as Fat Tire as the base with Asain pear juice, it has the maltiness of Fat Tire on the aroma, along with a added belgian yeast characteristic. Mildly carbonated, touches of caramel and yeasty flavors and an interesting fruit sweetness. Has a sticky malt finish. My wife is a big Fat Tire fan, but found this one too bready for her taste. As a belgian beer fan, I thought it was an improvement.."
"In terms of style, possibly classify as an American Amber, like it's little brother (which is a much better beer)."
