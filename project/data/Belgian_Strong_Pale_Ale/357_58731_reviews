"Unpleasantly sour aftertaste.  Beyond Just the Belgian style."

"Overall: I am not a huge fan of this style in general but some of the original styles from Belgium have surprised me. This is not one of those though. Sometimes American brewers can do magical things with Belgian styles and other fall short, this one to me falls on the short side. Its not a bad beer but certainly not one I would go after again, when there are so many amazing offerings out there these days."

"Average.  That's a 3 in my book, not a 3.75.  Sorry."

"True to what the style is, yet lacking any huge oommpphh that NEBCO is known for. Good, but not seekable."

"Smells of honey, pear, clove, and light perfumed warmth. Nothing overpowering but pleasant enough in the nose. I like this but it is dangerously close to being too sweet for my taste. It reminds of the time I fried pears in WAY too much honey. That was sticky sweet and this beer is almost there. Huge honey notes  with light pear and flowery heat blanketing everything. There is a lingering clove flavor that helps cut the sweetness somewhat. Great name on packaging for a pretty good beer."

"This is a good beer, but I'll take a Duvel or Matilda anyway."
""
""
""
"O - Worth picking up if you visit the Constitution State. Humerous artwork on the cans will entertain party guests, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: smooth; hides the ABV pretty well;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic pale Belgian flavors: Some very pale malt, a good dollop of hop bitterness, the aforementioned yeast and a solid alcohol warmth, particularly in the swallow. Well-balanced. The body is as I would expect; the carbonation slightly above average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a pretty great beer. I'm not particularly fond of the yeast profile, but it tastes good and goes down smooth."
""
""
""
"Price Point - $5.99/4pk 12 oz cans"
"O: A very good pale belgian. Not my first choice in style, but I do like this very much. It's also much better than a certain other Maiden-nodding beer that shall remain nameless."

"O: Very strong and tasty beer. Dangerously drinkable but boy is it enjoyable! I would highly recommend this beer to anyone interested in Belgian-style beers. I wouldn't necessarily say this is a great starter for those first exploring the style, it's also very enjoyable on its own merits."
""
""
"o; No shortage of taste in this brew, the Belgian yeasty ripe fruit flavor is pretty strong, making it an agressive representative of the style."
""
"American made Belgian beers are usually hit or miss for me, but this is definitely a hit and I would expect nothing less from NEBCO at this point. First, this pours a hazy orange/yellow color with a two finger white head. The aroma is sweet with some citrus and the funky belgian yeast clearly apparent. The taste definitely has that distinctive belgian yeast flavor, but its not overdone at all, which I feel is the problem with American Belgians (too much spice/clove/etc). This beer definitely got a good addition of hops with juicy grapefruit coming through, but it stops just short of any bitterness and instead mellows out into a smooth, almost creamy feel.. Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer and its a good thing I didn't try to guess. Its a one of a kind beer, and its definitely worth buying again. (90/100)"

"O - Very good light belgian style ale. If I lived in Connecticut I'd drink it quite a bit."
""
""
"O- awesome name, awesome can and tasty beer. lots of belgian yeast flavors swirling around. fruits spice and sugar, very well crafted."
""
""
"O: Definitely something I will come back to again in the future."
""
""
"Decent Belgian Strong Pale Ale with good mouth complexity, though I found it too sweet with lower drinkability, but if you like the style, it is a good option."

"O: This beer is a good representation of the style. The only drawback is that you get some alcohol in the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Of course you should know I live in Delaware and in close proximity to Dogfish Head and have a very intimate look for hops when sampling. I assume it is similar to that ability of people that can taste even the slightest influence of oak."
""
""
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice full head developed, white and frothy to creamy, with great retention and lacing. Appearance was cloudy with a golden honey color. Aroma was citrus and yeast with some spice and grass notes. Tasted grainy and yeasty with floral, herbal and citrus notes. Nice medium to full mouth feel with a sweet and lingering aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty spot on example of the style. This beer out of a wine barrel is probably something to behold."
"Can share at Proof courtesy of Masterson. Head!!! Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with about half an inch of head just in a rocks glass. Head lasted extremely well. Great lacing. Thick white collar once the head did fade. Sweet grassy aroma with some clean earthy hops. Taste is similar with a touch of funk. Medium to high carbonation and medium body. Very enjoyable."

"As a Connecticut resident I love New England Brewery. It's close by and I love to bring friends by to see the small, but ambitious location. The color is golden with a great foam. It's refreshing yet still has ample body to be drank alone. The hints of citrus on the end balance well with the wheaty taste in the beginning. We paired it with light Italian and were very happy with how well the beer paired. The price point on a four pack is pretty fair and the availability in stores inside CT is very nice. Everyone we turn on to this beer keeps coming back for more. While some beers tend to give either a love or hate reaction, this one is almost guaranteed to appease almost anyone's palate. On a side note, absolutely love the name and the artwork on the side of the can."

"O - Good beer. Not my favorite style, but this is a great representation. Great flavor and aroma, and very drinkable. I wouldn't want to kill one of the few Belgian Ale's I like by drinking it too often (as they aren't among my favorite styles), but I will certainly grab a few cans of this stuff every so often from now on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like better than average homebrew."
""
"Overall â€“ Don't get me wrong, this is a solid beer... but based on their DIPA/IPA I expected a little more from this brewer. It needs more carbonation and little more complexity taste wise."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body was also average, smooth and even, but, again, the alcohol hung around a bit too much. Except for the alcohol, drinkability was very good, the beer went down easily and I could have had a couple with no complaints. Overall, a pretty typical example of the style, certainly worth a shot if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This beer is all over the place. If it were -3abv, it would be the perfect summer beer, but since it's 9%, it's more of a sipper that takes you by surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a toasted almond meat hazed ale with a ring of soapy whites with some etched surface. Smells like apricot, white grapes, cracker, some nice sweet citrusy juice. Real awesome nose. Flavor follows through with a good fruity character, some more apricot, pineapple, apple juice, some grain, some nice refined and mature belgian yeast with a clay character. Medium on full bodied with moderately hi carb and a nice wet finish. Fucking A. Real delicious, if I could score this in the PNW, I'd slam it while camping for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a decent strong Belgian style ale, however there are plenty of others that I would prefer drinking this to. It was a nice crisp, refreshing beer to drink on a hot summer July day but it definitely wasn't anything that blew my mind away. If you like the style I'd definitely recommend trying it, but it isn't something that I would necessarily seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can - golden color with a nice head. Very good lacing down the glass. Went down rather easily for a Belgian strong. Almost too easy. Good buttery mouthfeel and just the right amount of spiciness. Wish that I was able to get this more often - but then again, I might be in trouble if that was the case! Simply fantastic - a definite must try if you haven't yet!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This reminds me of a modern Duvel. The aroma is almost identical, just a little less sharp. Absolutely tastes like something that should come from a dusty Trappist bottle, not a can from Connecticut."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste holds the nose's line to start, a little pick of alcohol in the middle, smooth sailing through the spicy close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with drinkability is almost too easy. Like this one muchly, and in a can to boot? Sold."
""
""
""

"O: The beer is really easy to drink and the 9% ABV is extremely well hidden - I was shocked to notice that it had that high of an ABV. There are some good flavors in this beer and it is likely the best Belgian style beer that I have had in a can."
"The beer appeared a nice amber color, but it seemed to have a light reddish or orange tint to it. The beer had a dense, creamy off white head that we well retained. The beer gave off a moderate aroma...malty with a hint of citrus. The taste, defiantly Belgian, but it also had this slight cherry taste to it, which I thought was very interesting. The beer had a heavier feel to it, but it was smooth, creamy and pretty easy to drink...although I would probably not drink too many in one sitting. Overall, a good beer and one that I will try again when I see it."
""
""
"Cloudy burnt orange pour, with a foamy white head that retained well and left nice lacing on the glass. Taking a whiff, I believe my comment was, ""Very Belgian."" Indeed. Fruity esters in the nose, Belgian yeast, coriander. Similar taste, pear, banana, stone fruit, citrus, yeast, coriander, doughy malts lending some sugary sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, a little chewy, pretty good overall. Not something I'm always in the mood for, but I'd get this again."
""
"Decent Belgian strong ale, but nothing to go crazy over. Way too easy to drink for 9% ABV, though. Tasty and unique although some of the hop and spice combinations are a little less than desirable for my taste buds. Still a good beer, recommended to fans of Belgian-style strong ales."
"O â€“ This was a pretty good beer. The appearance wasnâ€™t as clear, the head wasnâ€™t as everlasting, the aroma and taste werenâ€™t as complex, and the mouthfeel wasnâ€™t as creamy as some of the better Belgian examples, but it was tasty nonetheless. Furthermore, it was very drinkable, especially considering the 9% ABV. Maybe the best part was that it was in a can! I never thought I would see a Belgian-style ale in a can! Thanks for giving me the chance to try this one, Jared!"
"One of the better Belgian pale ales made in the US- love it."

"O: 668 is a solid BSPA. NEBCo continues to show their prowess and Iâ€™m glad that this is becoming more readily available throughout CT. Definitely worth a try."
"a really good Belgian pale, I love the yeast flavors in this one. it pours a just hazy bright yellow color, spirited head of two inches or more and bone white rests on top. there are a few little yeasties floating around as well. the packaging on this beer should also be mentioned, what a clever can and beer name, genius at work! the nose is Belgian yeasty with some spice and some lemon rind, and the malt profile sis rather simple. im shocked to learn the abv is 9%, because I cant smell or taste it, but I can definitely feel it after a quick can. some mild vanilla in there with the creamy lemon flavor, and a bolder medium body to make it stick. some grassy herbal notes in the finish, part hops, part hay, very summery all in all. excellent carbonation and a pretty dry finish for a beer this big, a definite sneaker. overall another excellent beer from new England brewing, courtesy of a fantastic trade with thebrewo. a great many thanks for the sampling of stuff from these guys, ive really enjoyed all of it so far."

"a beer that i've been wanting for a long time mainly due to the can's artwork and the funny name. been a die hard maiden fan for a long time, and this is just hilarious. the beer being great is an excellent plus ;)"

"Overall (4.25): Color me impressed. Not necessarily a standout according to the style guidelines, but Iâ€™ll be damned if this isnâ€™t an extremely satisfying beer to drink. And, as mentioned in the tasting notes, Iâ€™m very pleasantly surprised by how well the phenols really work into this beer. Great fruit and spice tones, nice and yeasty and rich but still dry. Great beer, and I will be seeking it out in the future."
"Overall: Excellently nuanced. Subtle, but very flavorful. I'll miss this since NEBCO is leaving MA for now."
""

"O: Average Belgian, nothing too special, nice to see the style in a can though"

"O: Good not great beer. I would probably not choose it again."
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a thin, sticky white head. The nose presents a bouquet of booze-infused honey, floral hops, and fruity yeast esters. It definitely establishes that it's a BSPA in the nose. The taste works in a complex melange of yeast fruits, honey sweetness, and grains followed by a slightly bitter, semi-dry white grape aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very approachable and drinkable for being a 9% beast and leaves a lot of traditional elements present (compared to a Duvel for instance). I'm excited for such a delicious canned beer available in WNY/CNY and recommend a brief warming period followed by some smooth jazz and reasonably paced sippage."

"O: This is a very nice solid beer with a lot of flavor. Thanks Davey 101 for sending me this beer."
""
"Overall I must judge on the style but I hate this style. I received this as a poker payout, so I can't complain for free beer but this is just like every other shitty dank, musty and milldew tasting Belgian. I really want to thank Poorpatz for the chance. I enjoyed the chance but wont seek this out again."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body, light to moderate carbonation, some hop resin. This is a very interesting beer and I recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary."
""
"O: A delicious and tasty BSPA. Lots of spicy black pepper on the back end so I hope you like that in your beer. Great combination of strong fruitiness, yeastiness and spiciness."
""
""
"M&D - smooth and drinkable, slightly effervescent, a great beer. Is the house at 670 for sale?"
""
""
"O: A solid BSPA overall. It's a little lacking in depth and needs to be more carbonated, but still is enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Spicy, peppery hop bitterness up front. Candyish malts and tropical fruit sweetness swell, filling the palate. The slightly boozy, fruity sweetness lingers as the herbal, peppery hop bitterness rules the finish. Medium-full body with a sparkling, lively feel. Delicious and devilish. One of the better American ""Duvel ales."""
""
"Pretty good! Not as satanic as the label would suggest"
""
"Recommend"
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body, light to moderate carbonation, some hop resin. This is a very interesting beer and I recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary."
""
"O - Sweet, but not overly with some bubblegum like flavors that are very welcoming."
""
""
"It has great balance with respect to bitterness to sweetness. The yeast is strong and brings out great belgian style flavors. This is just overall a great beer!"
"O: Really like this, and I'm not usually into the high ABV belgians. Tons of different flavor notes, weaved together beautifully. Very drinkable for what it is. Highly reccomended. One of the best US belgian style brews I've had."
"O: for a nine percent alcohol beer the booze is really well hidden, this is very drinkable and very tasty. Deffinatly give this a whirl of you have the chance."
"O: I really love the name of the beer, as well as how it looks, smells, and feels, but I didn't like the taste of it."
"Pours golden blonde with a small white head. It's a touch hazy. Not the prettiest Belgian out there but perfectly acceptable. The aroma is raisins, limes and sugary malt. There's also a light tropical fruit note and some peppercorn-coriander spice. Taste is drier than expected. It's mostly sweet malt and spices upfront, but the finish is dry with more of that lime rind flavor. Mouthfeel is light and airy for a 9% abv beer. I'm pretty surprised at the strength. There's very little booze or stickiness. This beer isn't going to blow anyone away, but it's a very nice Belgian, and the can is a fun bonus."
"O: Definitely enjoyed this. Hard to believe that is 9% (seems more like a 6% as you drink it). Also, it is local for me which is a plus, and I love the name!"
""
"O: A pretty good beer. Drinks rather easy for 9%. Would drink again for sure."
""
"The only issue with labeling this beer ""The Neighbor of the Beast"" is that it makes me want the real beast. And this is not as good as Duvel. While the Belgian yeast strain here is rather aggressive, it somehow lacks the depth of others in this style. It's tasty, but not amazing."
""
"O - A little sweeter than I want in a BSPA, but still quite tasty. I would take Duvel over this, but I would happily drink this again."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong but well-disguised kick, good representation of style, this is a decent stronger Belgian-style beer to drink for a while."
""
""
""
"o- good beer, haven't had much from the style, but i enjoyed it. i could myself purchasing this from time to time if it was available to me."
""
""
"O: A very tasty golden ale for a not-too-bad price point. Glad to have two 4packs of this. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid Belgian style pale ale that has just what you'd expect from the style. Maybe if I get out east I'll get to try some more offerings from New England Brewing."
"O: This is a tasty beer, but it gets sort of heavy and cloying after a while. I don't find myself wanting a second. That said, it's remarkably drinkable for the abv."
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a huge Belgian yeast fan, but this is well balanced and manages to be massively Belgian without being overbearing. Nice depth of flavor."
"O - Overall, this is a good beer. Could use better mouthfeel, and some more head. Those considered, this is a pretty solid beer."
"All said and done, I'm quite impressed! This ""Belgian Strong Pale Ale"" is very balanced, smooth, and well-done. If this were available on a regular basis, it would be a staple in my own fridge. Great job guys!"
"Pours an orangish color with a nice cloudy head that never leaves. Aromas of grains, spices, and subtle hops hit the nose. Not a very strong smelling beer but nice. Somewhat sweet on the nose. Taste is full of sugar with plenty of fruits. Bread doughs and hop backbone round out the palate. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry but thin. Overall this is a sessionable brew. Nothing outstanding but nice."
""
""
""
"O: I'm usually not a fan of Belgians, but this was a pretty great brew - borders on the Belgian/American line. NEBC is new to me, but I'm impressed so far - haven't had anything less than great yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a really cool can into a snifter. Nice golden color with a light white head. The smell is dead on for the style. Taste is everything Ii expected from the smell. Spice, sweetness, delicious. One of the best American Belgian style beers I've had in a while. I can't believe this is 9% ABV, the alcohol his hidden really well. My first offering from this brewery and I am very pleased. Hope to snag some more in the future."
"O: Solid saison, easy to drink. Not my favorite, but I wouldnâ€™t turn this down."
"O: Very good. Glad I got a chance to try this one."
"O - Great overall taste, aroma and appearance. The alcohol is hidden incredibly well."
""

"I'm a big fan of New England Brewing and this, the newest beer I've tried from them, only reaffirms my love for the brewery. Well done!"
""

"668 NotB pours a crystal clear tangerine, with some goldenrod highlights. The pour is abysmal, there's barely a finger of white foam and it disappears quickly and cleanly. The appearance score would be lower if not for the fact that I didn't have this problem with some of my other 668 cans. The nose is a nice blend of pear heavy fruits and pepper and clove phenols. The two are pretty evenly balanced, though overall the aroma could stand to be a little bit more attention grabbing. The flavor profile is top notch. Some green apples creep in to join the the pears at the open, and the spicy phenols still have plenty of zip. There's also a pleasant warming sensation from a slight alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is good, but stops just a step short of being great. It's unquestionably got a dry body and bubbly level of carbonation, each could stand to be taken even a little bit farther. I really like Neighbor of the Beast, it's one of the American brewed Belgians I've liked the most in recent memory."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel that this is a good offering from the New England Brewery. Although this didnâ€™t blow me away completely, it was definitely enough to keep my interested in it. Itâ€™s al all around good Belgian style beer which is made in America â€“ something sort of hard to find. At the very least, I could easily say that this is the best Belgian Style beer Iâ€™ve drank in a can."
""
""
"Strong alcohol taste to it. Some banana taste to it. Some wheatyness. Yeast. It's quite sweet. This is a solid Belgian IPA, and I'm not usually in love with these. Mild almost cedarish taste to it."
"O: This is a great strong ale that I would definitely try again. (Thanks CliffBrake for the surprise!)"
"While its deff malty, you do taste the belgian yeasts and hops. Slight citrus and straw notes. The alcohol is present, a bit noticeable, but nicely compliments the flavor. Overall, I really like this brew. Well worth the money paid for the 4-pack and would buy again. However, the main reason I even went out to New Haven was for Gandhi Bot, and I wouldnt make a special trip for this brew...but I would deff pick up again while buying GBot."

"Some nice symmetry, review of 668 is my 668th beer review."
""
""
""
"M - The feel was also wonderful, nice and light bodied and very well carbonated, it never got flat or boring and offered a very nice sessionable feel to it. Crisp and clean this went down easily and really was just a pleasant expierence all around."
""
""
"O/D-I only bought one can. Seeing as a 4-pack is $13, one is enough as this is overpriced. But, I love NEBCO. This one is pretty good. Definitely a step or two below Gandhi Bot and Imperial Stout Trooper, but this is damn tasty in its own regard."
""
""
""
""
"I think this is the first Belgian style ale I've ever had from a can. and it is damn good. I love the amount of spicing here, and even though it's the dominate profile, it's not heavy handed at all. Great balance, and I had no idea this was a 9% beer. Very well done."

"Served on tap at Delaney's. Nice orange-gold color with a thick white head. Fruity nose, with a strong yeast presence. Taste was sweet, a little spicy and just a hint of hops; I caught a hint of coriander and pepper as well. Hides it's 9% very well; I only caught a big of an alcohol flavor. Very tasty local Belgian."
"A murky yellow with white head. A clove, banana aroma. Similar tastes prevail, with an odd apricot/fruit undertone as well as some yeasty funk. Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky. Overall a good belgain... Especially for a style I don't usually like. Thanks again gcurlow"
"Overall: Rather nice, and in a can to boot; I wouldn't mind a bit more Candi sugar and a bit less pith but that is a nit"
"Overall: I thought this beer was a bit too sweet, and then the alcohol in the finish was a bit much. I enjoyed my can, but I don't think I would have another."
"Great addition to the other nice can offering(s) from NEBC."
"It's hitting the spot perfectly. Thanks go out to Chris who hooked this one up."
"**Low Overall score due to lack of dating.**"
"The hotness of the booze here does detract from the enjoyment of the beer. Fairly average for style, perhaps not even average, due to the lack of spiciness and the booze."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, well hidden click, nice representation of style. This is a very tasty and easy drinking beer - especially for a 9%."
"Into an oversize wine glass this pours a hazy glowing dirty yellow gold under a well retained creamy head with a brilliant display of carbon bubbles swimming to the surface. Aroma is clearly highlighted by Belgian yeast and pungent fruity ester perhaps most akin to earthy orange rind. Juicy bittering fruit is king here, filtered through the dominant backbone of Belgian yeast character present. Sharp echoing ending of bready pungent lemon and tangerine citrus. The overall exotic blend of fruit really does grow on my palate through a few sips and leaves me eager for the next sip. Love the can humor here...that poor bastard lives next to the beast..."
"O - nice can of beer"
"A very nice, citrusy, Belgian style ale. Â Worth seeking out."
"Pours a murky orange with a decent amount of pure white head. Smells a bit boozy with some yeasty aromas and a almost minty touch. Lots of banana aromas. Tastes banana heavy eith yeastiness. A typical belgian flavour profile but nothing special. Thick and low carbontion. Overall nothing special at all"
"SkÃ…L!"
"O - overall a decent beer, but not one of my favorites."
"O: Good beer for a nice warm day. Would not turn down if I was presented the chance to drink this again. The name and label art are great!"
"This beer poured out with a nice orange body, the head was foamy and white. The head settles and leave a tiny amount of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a nice yeasty fruit aroma mixed with a subtle amount of spices. The taste had some citrus flavors and some other light soft fruit flavors. There is a slight hoppiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and lighter bodied for good drinkablity. Overall, I loved the name of this beer and that's why I bought it. I would drink this one again to see if my thoughts have changed at all. Pretty good brew though."
"Overall, this beer carries its abv quite well, but I donâ€™t see myself aspiring to drink more of this. Good for what it is, but not something I would seek out again."
"O: You know, I think I've now looked over my past few reviews of this style, and I honestly think now that this style is right up my alley. 668 is tasty stuff!"
"The cloudy orange pour arrived into my maw with a bit of pep in its step. Citrusy, a little peppery, fruity phenols, sweet candy but not overly sweet. I could've easily been fooled into thinking this beer was shipped from overseas. An excellent American take on this style and a wonderful runner-up choice for my thirsting mouth."
"In search of a different IPA or ""extra hops"" in something different I picked up the last cold 4-Can Pack at Waterford CT Package Store on their recommendation. Served in pint beer glass, no taste of ""can"". Cloudy orange color, head goes away by the end of the drink but coats the glass on the way down. Plenty of citrus and other spices, and a good ""bite"". The ABV of 9.00% is not something you taste but start to feel after two. Definitely on my ""A" list for this Summmer to share with friends and family as ""something different""."
"Overall: A good Belgian Ale with lots of burn. One per sitting. I do like this but think I would enjoy it more with a little less heat."
"O: At 9% abv., this beer is highly drinkable. Goes down very easy, crisp, and refreshing. Not too complex as is expected from the style but it serves its purpose and is solid enough to try again."
"O - NEBCO knocked it out of the park with this one. I wish I could find cans in my area, but fresh on tap with a blue cheese burger made for an awesome lunch."
"Pours a clear golden color with a good white head that sticks around for quite a bit before falling and leaving behind a good amount of lacing. The nose carries some light malt along with a good dose of spicing and some mild citrus character. The flavor hits more of the spice notes and has a bit of alcohol. Pretty crisp with a moderate citrus presence. Dry and crisp with a light to medium body and a bit of booze in the finish. Nice take on the style."
"D: Overall, this one is a bit of a sipper. Not completely overwhelming, but would not drink more than one or two in a session. Another solid offering from New England Brewing Company. If given the opportunity give it a try."
"O. I really like this one, especially after sweating outside all evening. I would buy this often if available and reasonably priced. 4.5"
"You can't go wrong here - now sing with me: 'SIX, SIX-EIGHT! THE NEIGH-BOR OF THE BEAST!"""
"O: The only renditions if this style I've had are La Chouffe, Delirium Tremens, and this one, and I have to say that this one has too much of a pilsner taste to my liking. I've tried to like pilsners on many occasions but I just can't, and the pilsner malts in this one don't help it's case. Still, it's definitely an enjoyable beer, but I probably won't get a 4 pack again."
"Overall a good beer. But nothing special. Probably wouldn't search it out."
"It pours a cloudy orangish gold in color with a perfect one and a half finger creamy white head. It looks great in my snifter. It smells of yeasty, pale malt, and has some light spice to it. I'd say it could be mistaken for a saison based on the nose itself. The initial flavors are of sweet pale malts mixed with Belgian yeast and honey. It's sweeter than I anticipated but still pretty good. Like most beers from a can it's perfectly smooth. It's medium bodied and has the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is a very good Belgian Strong Pale. I'm definitely glad I finally got to try it and even more glad that I still have one left."
"Overall: Another good beer from NEBCO. I really dug the name and label before I even tasted it. I have some more coming my way and I'm glad I do."
"beer pours a very cloudy golden orange color with a smallish white head that barely holds. Smells of Belgian yeasts, slight hefe-like with banana and clove. muted as well. taste is similar, like a weak hefe or witbier only drier. Medium-bodied, hides the alcohol well. overall, decent beer, but not typical of the style and somewhat weak in the spices/taste. I think there are better takes on this style out there."
"I really like this beer. Belgian style beers (excluding sours) have not been thrilling me for the last couple months but this one is working. Very well crafted beer, great balance. This is one I would pick up semi-regularly if it were available in my area. Glad I was able to try it."
"Drink- Pretty tasty and it was light and crisp at the same time. The blend of malts and sugars was pretty different for the style. Glad I got another to kick back with."
"Poured from a 16oz can into snifter. Appearance is of a hazy dark orange with about 3/4in slowly fading light tan head. Excellent thick lacing. Aroma is of yeast, some pine and light citrus. Mouthfeel is light, with a slightly stining carbonation. Taste is very yeasty, of orange peels, some nuttiness? and more bread/yeast. I am not a fan of belgian style beers, but this is not bad. It is slightly refreshing anyway."
"16oz Tall Boy. Pours a murky burnt orange with a very thin head. Aroma is of yeast, banana, slight citrus and spices. Flavor is bitter spices upfront followed by some yeast and orange peel. Small flavor of hops as well. Almost has an apricot taste to this beer. Definitely has that typical Belgian taste to it. Boozey taste to this one but drinks fairly easily. Overall, I'm not a big Belgian fan but this is a pretty good beer. Worth grabbing again."
"O- Not too bad of a brew. I'm just not a huge fan of the yeastiness in some of these Beligans, but this ones pretty solid."
"O-> Wow. Really impressed by this. First time having this beer and NEBCO knocked it outta the park with this one. There are usually so many varied complaints about American-brewed Belgian-style beers whether it be yeast or hop profile yet this one is guilty in neither avenue. Exceptionally balanced, unbelievably impressive, and all around delightfully tasty and enjoyable. Cheers to your New England Brewing! Keep up the good work....The 275+ mile round-trip excursion is worth it every time...."
"Very drinkable, but after a 16 oz of 8.8% Belgian I'm not looking to drink much more. A supremely well crafted Belgian by the pro's at NEBCo, cheers!"
"M: Mild carbonation and very smooth medium body. Very good overall."
"The mouthfeel is nice too. Moderate carbonation which is put together nicely. Small carbonation bubbles make it smooth and elegant. Overall a very nice brew - nice work NEBCO!"
"This is a pretty damn impressive beer from New England. So many Belgian style beers from American brewers are either overhopped or underwhelming in terms of the yeast character, and this is neither. It's quite drinkable and doesn't feel like 9% at all. Very complex nose, nearly as complex on the palate, and very smooth and tasty. Well done."
"Growler purchased at NEBCO on 4/16/2011. Served in my Captain Lawrence tulip. Pours a semi-hazy tangerine with a loose, half inch, bright white head. Head dissipates into a band around the shoulders and a bull's eye dollop in the center. Delicate slashes of lacing revealed during the tasting exhibit excellent retention. Clusters of tiny bubbles adhere to the base of the glass. Nose expresses coriander, clove, Belgian yeast and a faint medicinal character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also some candi sugar present in the flavor profile that nicely softens the medicincal phenols. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation, some citrus astringency and a semi-dry finish. This is one tasty BSPA. Great balance and a remarkable tribute to the style. I really enjoyed this when I tried it from the can but it's even better out of the growler. I continue to be impressed by these guys."
"I have had this on two occasions both of them as growler fills direct from the brewery. I found it to be a fantastic beer. The guys at New England are great people who truly love what they are doing and their products reflect their passion. The beer was a cloudy golden yellow with a one finger dense, white head loaded with a great combination of banana, vanilla, and spice. It starts with a very mild bite of hops and finishes very smooth and sweet. This year's batch was probably running at a very sneaky 9.5% ABV with no alcohol burn whatsoever. I highly recommend taking a run to Woodbridge and getting it right from the source."
"D: Sort of a sipper at 9% ABV, 668 drinks light and satisfying enough where it would be a problem from the uninitiated who don't recognize ABV. A tasty, fruity, floral and complex ""near-summer"" beer to quench the masses."
"After multiple attempts at trying this beer finally! Cloudy yellow gold with one and a half fingers of tight white head. Lacing is left half way down the glass. Not the best head retention however. The aroma is heavy on banana and clove and belgian spices, sweat and aromatic. Esters of apples, banana, pear and flavor of clove come through over the tongue. Faint grassy hops but this beer is really yeast driven. Creamy, full, but still well attenuated mouthfeel. Overall a good beer, glad to try it but not as good as other belgian goldens."
"D: really good. make sure you have a friend to help with the growler, this one sneaks up on you quick"
"Full bodied and well-complemented by the carbonation, this feels great on the palate. The warmth fro the alcohol is comforting, and the bready sweetness rounds it out with a great kick. A solid American take on a Belgian version that American brewers so often fail to do well. I would definitely pick this up if I saw it on shelves here."
"D - goes down easy just remember the abv and who's next door."
"Drinkability: This style gets me in trouble every time. The combination of fruit and dryness allow me to drink it fairly easily without realizing how fast 9% can catch up to you. The alcohol is a bit more present here, but it is well done."
"Massive thanks to Pabs311 for sending this one my way as an extra! Served from can into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quite quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and subtle hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, spices, and subtle hops. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. I had actually been waiting to get my hands on this one for quite some time. Definitely glad I got to try it. It had an excellent aroma and flavor going on with this one. The flavor was very well balanced with the sweetness from the malt and fruit aspect and was then rounded out with the spices and hops to balance it out. Quite an excellent combination. This is totally worth seeking out to try it without doubt!"
"This can is awesome. The design is sweet and hilarious. I think it is awesome they put a Belgian strong in a 16oz can. I poured about 7-8 oz's into my duvel tulip for the review. I wanted to keep the rest and drink it straight out of the can. Anyways, this golden, slightly hazy straw yellow with very rocky white head. The aroma is distinctly Belgian yeast with some citrus and alcohol. The taste is strong, and very good. It hints at a farmhouse-like funkiness but mainly from the yeast. Kinda spicy, peppery. This is a great beer. The alcohol is strong which makes the mouthfeel very dry. I loved the novelty of drinking a great Belgian strong ale directly out of a sweet can. Cool."
"D: Not the best begian pale ale I've had, but still a great interpretation of the style. Aside from the 9% abv, this beer goes down very easy. Smooth and creamy, and packed with flavor. Another solid offering from NEBC."
"T/M: Honey liquor--all the flavors of the nose plus a rum note. The alcohol is prominent and hot on the mouth. The texture is a bit oily but still very dry from the alcohol. A great strong beer with interesting notes and flavors."
"The Crack & Glug - works every time, although here it was close to an overflow. Gotta work on ramping back just a tad on the pour of some of these beers. Two rocky fingers' worth of thick, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving behind a lot of sticky lacing. Nose was peppery, black peppery with a slight funk, not unlike a farmhouse saison. Hmm. Color was a slightly cloudy golden-yellow. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a slight viscosity to it on the tongue. I could feel an initial heat that gave 'way to a pleasant spicy sweetness. I was reminded of the interplay in MexiCAN hot chocolate between the sweet and the heat. This was more black pepper and sugary sweetness, but it may give you an idea of the mix of tastes. Finish was very dry, thanks to the yeast-driven spiciness. Wow! I felt like I had been kicked by a goat. Say, is somebody experimenting with sulfur in my basement? What is happening? My cooler just melted into a puddle of plastic slag! I need to move on."
"Overall was pretty drinkable and another good showing from the fellas up there at NE brewing."
"Pretty good beer that I would recommend for others to try."
"D - Definitely not my favorite style but seems pretty solid and in line with other's of this style. I'm glad I got to try this but I won't be in a rush to try it again."
"3.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"overall - pretty good beer. this isn't my favorite style, but one of the best i've had in that style."
"NOTE: This beer MAY not have traveled well since, even though it was safely packaged, it arrived with a huge bulge on the top of the can. Also, my experience was nothing like what I've read from other reviewers."
"A pleasant surprise from my cousin in CT. The 16 ounce can was split with 2 others in snifters. The pour was a clear orange with a moderate white head, minimal lacing. The aroma was very sweet, fruity and a moderate amount of spice. The flavor followed the nose, with the spiciness was more prominant. The finish was on the sweet side and lingered nicely. The body was medium and the ABV was well hidden. I would love to try this again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew. Another great beer from NEBCO. Keep up the great work!"
"very drinkable. wish i had another can."
"A beautiful half inch head. A great golden haze with active carbonation. The nose is sweet maltiness and fruit. Lots of flavors when tasted: apricots and good malt warmness which is clean and fresh, balanced by a balancing spicy, bitterness at the end of the tongue."
"D- easy to finish, and i really enjoyed the artwork on the can. something id pick up again if i had the chance. my first beer from this brewery and i hope not the last."
"DB- Not as tiring as other examples of the style. The fact that this is 9% amazes me, now that I know that. Good and dry without a fatiguing yeast presence."
"Very good, saison-like. Solid."
"Got a couple cans of this one this morning, and eagerly cracked one open tonight. Pours a nice medium gold color, with a good-sized fluffy white head. Aromas of lemon, clove and Belgian yeast. On the palate, I get a hint of sourness, along with more Belgian yeast, lemons and no alcohol whatsoever (until the end, when you realize how potent this one is). Very good."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. 668 appears a hazey golden color with a finger of creamy white head. Spotty lace clings to the glassware. The aroma of this brew is typical belgian characteristics of yeast, clove and some alcohol sting in the back of the nose. The taste is a bit yeasty and sugary with a candy-like sweetness that clings to the mouth. There is an abundant amount of alcohol warmth through the back and a bit of almost bubblegum flavor mingled within. Medium bodied brew that is moderately carbonated. Drinkable and well balanced overall but nothing I would be upset about if I never tried again."
"D: Really just a nice Belgian style beer, and a good one in a can, I might add. Never once thought this was 9% as I was enjoying the beer."
"On tap at ELi's with Haogie and The Larse. Had this one while a girl wearing a BEBE shirt blew my mind. Strong yeasty boozy taste and flavor that mellows towards the finish. Not the most balanced but a pretty easy drinking belgian strong ale for 9 percent. My thought on this beer are clouded by the images of a goddess."
"This is a good beer, and I especially like the irony of the pounder can with this particular style. Thanks to the awesome guy who gave me the can at Ebenezer's Belgian Beer Fest in Maine this weekend! I owe you one, whoever you are!"
"Taste is a sharp punch of the basics, hops, yeast, malt. It tastes similar to others in the style, one of the better US versions. Carbonation is just right, with a nice aftertaste with the right combination of dryness and spice. Drinkability is above average, The Neighbor of The Beast can go down easily, so bear in mind the ABV. All in all, I am impressed with this offering from NEBC. And, I am glad that I still have a couple of them in the basement."
"Overall, I just wasn't feeling this beer. It was too strong and too much of the alcohol showed. I really don't know the intentions of this beer but it just turned out too big. Not overly drinkbale."
"Can. Must say the sticker on the can is very cool. Pours a clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head. Very reminescent of Duvel in the look. The aroma screams belgian yeast with a boozy quality. The taste is that of fruit and belgian yeast. Very easy drinking. Tasty and smooth ending with a slight bitterness. Very good. Medium mouthfeel."
"I love how closely this guy resembles Carl Brutananadilewski, though without the effect of decades of disappointment crashing down on his shoulders. The beer pours a hazy amber straw topped by a steadfast finger of white suds. The nose comprises banana, clove, Belgian-yeast spiciness, orange zest, cinnamon, and coriander. The taste is heavy on the citrus aspects, pumping that coriander and orange peel to an overt level. The cloves are joined by some peppercorns, and behind all of this citrus and spice looms a mass of honey and light caramel. The body is a solid medium, with a light medium carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a solid brew, a bit hard to drink heavily, but a decent Belgian-style sipper."
"Soft feeling in the mouth, yet maintains a 'rougher' alcohol flavor and drying hoppiness. Yeast esters are great and provide plenty of fruit and bread. Spicy, phenolic - zesty even...Impressed! Lacks a bit of complexity here and there, but overall I am very happy with this fine canned offering. Well done NEBC!"
"D: Excellent drinkability. ABV only really becomes apparent at the end of the CAN. So cool to be able to drink something like this from a tallboy!"
"D - The overall sweetness and heat of this are holding this back from a better drinkability. Good, complex flavor in a moderately light body."
"HV"
"Would I buy more of it? - yes. yes. yes."
"D: OK drinkability - it has a lot of alcohol and you can taste and feel lit which lowers its score, but being at 9% is pretty high and it's an interesting beer with a funny label."
"Amust try I have one more can and hope to get more!!!"
"D-Great drinkability despite high abv, If I could drink this every night I would...This may be my favorite beer of all time. Im blown away by this breweries pint cans. Ghandi bot too."
"Gandhi Bot wowed me from this brewery, and this beer has done it again for me, very solid offering coming out of this brewery. Get your hands on some."
"Pours a pale orange yellow color, slightly cloudy with a strong and sticky off white head. Minty hops, orange peel and a spicy yeast note in the nose. Creamier than expected body with an assertive hop character, the alcohol content is well hidden, a light spicy bite rounds out and balances the sip. Very well made, im loving the true American influence to the style in this beer. Good drinkability for its size."
"A good beer from New England Brewing. I am glad to have purchased this beer however I will take my time to revisit it."
"F: Finishes still sweet with lingering candi sugar and lots of malts, sweet juicy malt flavors, some yeast too. Touch of wheat. A bitterness also comes through on the finish, I can't figure out where it's from, perhaps some grassy hops that I'm just starting to detect. It does have a slight chewy and sticky finish as well. There's also more spicy, tingly, and warming booze with all that."
"D - This is what got me to buy this beer people saying that you could mow your lawn with it. It's drinkable for 9% but not as refreshing as it has been brought out to be with all the BA hype. I plan on having this paired at the lobster bake in a couple weeks and it should do good pairing with the fattyness of lobster."
"If you prefer belgians you can easily go through the 4 pack. Other folks might find it a tad bit overwhelming."
"D - Very fruity and spicy...huge Belgian yeast character...9% and showing it. Quite a bit boozy...a slow drinker for me...drinks more like a tripel for me. I'm liking it, but it is definitely a slow go here. I really liked the sample I had of this at ACBF recently...still like it, but the whole can is a bit of an effort to get through. Not because it is at all bad, just that the alcohol is very noticeable...could be that this is the 4th and last beer for me for the night though..."
"Drinkability: 668 and Ghandi-Bot have been some standout beers from New England brewing for me. It's nice to see a local brewery really putting out some awesome creations that have been above averge. This is a great example of a well crafted Belgian Strong, it's got beautiful aromas and the right touch of yeast & alcohol properties to make it true to the Belgian name. If your not used to Belgians this might not be up your ally, as the alcohol when this warms up can really hit you hard if your not careful. Definetley will have this one again!"
"Another impressive beer from New England Brewing Co. A tribute beer that stands respectably with the beers that inspired it."
"D - I just can't seem to put this one down. I'm just happy it comes in a 4-pack."
"This is so good, I'm starting to believe that NEBCO may have pulled some type of Faustian deal for the recipe...? Definitely worth a soul or two."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Another winner from NEBC. I usually pass up Belgians for styles I enjoy more while I'm at the store but this is a very tasty beer. I've enjoyed everything I've had from them thus far and I find it amazing how even their bigger beers have no noticeable booziness to them. Looking forward to future releases from NEBC."
"M/D- medium bodied with good carbonation. easy drinker at 9% ABV. well worth the taste and am happy i got a growler. i'll be looking for this one on store shelves in cans."
"Thanks to Ohoove for hoofing down to NEB for this nice growler full. It's a nice amber color with a modest off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma brings mild clove-malt and allspice wheat, and just a kiss of the proverbial banana, nice. The flavor offers notable citrus hops blended nicely with subtle clove and solid sweet malt. Kind of tart and sweet, citrusy and mellon, mildly spicey with some alcohol but not too prominent. I pick up some banana-orange flavor and tea. Medium to full bodied, fully carbonated but very fine and smooth in feel. Reasonably drinkable for the high ABV. A very beautiful brew. Nice work NEB. I'm generally not much of a fan of hardcore Belgian styles but this seems to ""Americanize"" the idea a bit and makes this something that just might excite the masses as well as the discriminating hardcore. Coming out in cans soon!"
"D: Insanely good considering the ABV (9%). When I got this filled the brewer even jokingly told me to be careful with it. Another fantastic brew from NEBCO. Will hopefully be grabbing some cans when they hit the shelves"
"The guys at NEB are great....It's nice to get a growler filled close by."
"The Neighbor is a fine example of the style, offering excellent flavor and aroma character in quite a smooth beer."
