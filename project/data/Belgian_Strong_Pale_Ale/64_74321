3.76,11.2,3.25,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the flavoring. The nose actually started out a bit cheap, with the grain taking on a pseudo-adjuncty feel. This thankfully faded with warmth, giving more genuine grain, fruit, and sweetness. With the inclusions of the black currants we were expecting a much more fruity beer, but instead were delivered something much more akin to a sour when it comes right down to it. This is not to say that this was a wild/sour, but the tartness of the fruit took us off guard. To note we are drinking a Batch 1, November 2011 bottling, so the sweetness has had time to settle, with the grain coming much further to the front. With warmth this beer gets better, remaining dynamic and something unique for the brewery.","TheBrewo","Apr 20, 2013"

3.65,8,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.5,"O: The nose is very fruit-forward and sweet, but thankfully Faithfull Ale shows more balance in taste. The Belgian aspects of it are very downplayed, as the yeast takes a passive role. Complexity suffers as a result, and it feels a little dumbed-down. A decent beer in the end, though Dogfish Head perhaps played this one a little more safely than they should have.","ryan1788a5","Mar 27, 2013"

Very mild hop bitterness. Feel is medium light with a crispness when cold that settles into a fuller creaminess as it warms and the carbonation becomes more expansive.

Aromas of toasted cereal and extremely subtle currant sweetness. That grape/currant character swings heavier in the palate, with a solid, slightly sour profile along side the toasty grain backbone and a touch of honey at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is roasty and toasty, but not much else. This helps keep it clean, with a smooth, slightly lingering finish that leaves a touch of fruit behind for a bit.

The nose has a light currant note, some doughy/bready yeast, light candi sugar, light peach, some light herbs, and faint sweat. The flavor is similar with more light candi sugar, peach and currant notes underneath, faint herbs, doughy yeast, and light peppery phenols. The palate is lively, medium, creamy, and slightly drying. The finish is lightly herbal and peppery, drying slightly, but ultimately still filled with light candi sugar. Not what I would call a tribute to Pearl Jam with not much going on.

The taste is quite sweet, with the currants, malts, and Belgian yeast all working to make something approaching cloyingly sweet. Thankfully a cuttingly dry mouthfeel at the end stops it from becoming too cloying. The drinkability is pretty good, the Belgian influence doesn't get too out of hand.

The nose is a bit dull (which, in the end, is probably doing me a favor), but what aroma is perceptible is dominated by the currants. There's also a slight peppery phenolic presence, but all it really does is hint that maybe currants don't belong in this style of beer. The flavor is still dominated by that dark raisin-y flavor, but a little bit of pear shows up and joins the pepper-clove notes to provide a slight Belgian Strong Pale framework for the currants. They don't belong here any more than they did in the nose though, the flavor clashes horribly with the base beer. The body is nicely dried out, but the carbonation isn't as expansive and lively as would be ideal for the style. I'm a Dogfish Head fan, and I'll try just about anything they brew at least once, because more often than not I can dig it. Every once in a while though they come up with something that's just a complete miss for me, and this is one of those times.","axeman9182","Jan 09, 2012"

Nose seems a bit off - a combination of grassy, skunky and citrusy with perhaps a trace of coriander. Taste is quite a bit different than the nose - citrus, currants, pale malts and a suggestion of candi sugar. There's also a plesant floral/herbal character that comes out towards the back end. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation. There's also a slightly oily texture which is quickly dispersed by the carbonation. A slightly acidity around the edges is also overshadowed by the carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid BSPA. Not mindblowing by any means, but a good domestic example of the style. At 7% abv I wouldn't sit on this bottle too long.

The nose has a dry powdered yeast note that falls flat, a bit of a mineral character with some mild earthiness. The nose isn't very expressive with the currant fruitiness/tartness I was expecting. Flavor is actually pretty nice with a mix of sweet malt and tart fruit currants mixing together, with a wave of warmth in the alcohol and a dry Belgian yeast finish. Not much in the way of spices or yeast spiciness. There is a texture/flavor that I just don't care for amongst the currant jam sweetness that almost has a milky powdered crushed calcium tablet note about it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied moderate carbonation, something in texture weighs on the palate between each sip making it more and more difficult to quaff on. Overall this beer lacks cohesive flavors that would be expressive of such a great and timeless band like Pearl Jam. Maybe they were going for a currant jam, but I feel this beer was a rehash of an old release with less creativity behind than their other album releases like Bitches Brew or Hellhound on my Ale.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

The flavor certainly isn't the best I've had, especially from DFH, but this does have a nice drinkability quality for sure.

More accurately, the currant is probably more forward in the aroma than it is in the flavor because of all the breadiness in the taste. Pours golden with a somewhat thin head that leaves little lacing. I expected a darker beer, probably because of the currants, so that was a surprise. Quite fruity in the nose with noticeable currant notes. Aside from the breadiness in the taste, the currants make a mid-palate appearance followed by a late hoppy bitterness. Interesting, but the slightly raw yeasty flavors contribute to a thicker mouthfeel. I actually don't mind the flavor itself, primarily since I like a yeasty note and I like currants, but I could see how this could easily hit the wrong notes for a lot of people.","Georgiabeer","Dec 22, 2011"

Taste is more earthy, with an emphasis on the grains (straw, hay, wheat) and a more pronounced currant flavor, especially on the finish. Some lemon, yeast, grass, clove, and alcohol are also noticeable. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, clean, and finishes a touch on the dry side; well done.

Damn, I gotta see what this stuff brings: It pours a clear gold topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light corn syrup (more of a vague sweetness than anything, but this is a close enough approximation), vague berries, and light dank greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with those berries coming in even lighter and with a bit of a plastic twinge. Honestly, not much going on on my tongue at all, but what is there ain't all that appealing. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty sad and boring beer. Given the greatness of "Ten", I'm not entirely sure Pearl Jam deserved a tribute beer like this (though the rest of their oeuvre kinda implies something weak being appropriate)...","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2011"

3.86,14.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4," The Faithfull is a pretty malty Belgian with some mild spice and yeast hints at chalky with a somewhat doughy and bready flavor. There is light sweetness from the pils base with slight currant note which goes well with the malt. There is a light tanginess in the yeast flavor which also brings out slight earthy currant elements. The malt verges on nutty/toasted at times with more subtle sugar in the raisiny accent, the finish comes off slightly sweet with a hint of spice. Overall this is a pretty good Belgian style golden, not great but for what it is it is alright. I like the currant addition, but perhaps the sweetnes is higher in the profile than necessary. I like the fact the alcohol is low in the overall taste, but it is just good overall in drinkability for my taste, it is like a toned-down pangea -it seems that is the base without any added spices.","Slatetank","Nov 20, 2011"

It tastes like currants, wheat/grainy malt, grassy hops, honey, and some white grapes. But like the aroma, the taste is underwhelming. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with good carbonation. Overall, this beer is just average to me, and since I'm a fan of DFH I'm probably being generous with my rating.

The smell of the beer is sweet, and a bit on the fruity side. The taste of the beer gives off a bit of a fruity note as well, personally I feel that this beer tastes a hell of a lot like Midas Touch. The mouthfeel is light and fairly refreshing, it doesn't feel dry at all it's more of a sweet feeling you get as apposed to a bitter finish. Overall I expected a little more from this brew. I'm not really sure why but I just thought that it would have been something a little more over the top. It's not a bad beer, I just feel that it would be much better to drink in the summer time.
