"Solid ass brew! Very well thought out and well placed flavors. My only draw back was the cold harsh carbonation. Everything else rocked. Highly recommended."

"Overall, why did they take away the six packs, again? Seriously, this stuff's really good, worth getting the brewers' picks to try it if you haven't. Recommend if you like their Collette and Orabelle."

"I really liked this. Had it out of the brewer's variety pack, poured into a pilsner glass. The color is a lighter gold with just a slight touch of haze, not a lot of head. Super light flavor with some nice clove and spice. The mouthfeel was pretty mild. Really worth a go on a summer day/night."

"Flavors of a very dry cream soda with herbs. Some malt sweetness but also funky yeast esters going all over including bitter citrus, light aspirin, cream of tartar, white pepper. Overall very big and bold body with some bite!"

"Overall this was a great beer for the price. I will be trying more of the Great Divide brews because of this. Great first impression"
""
""
"Overall, one of the better American-made Belgian Strong Pale Ales I've had. You can sense the tribute to Duvel, but it still establishes a character all it's own. Definitely a beer I would drink over and over if it was readily available."

"O: A Belgian Pale Ale with a pronounced spice character derived mostly from the yeast with the hops lending a hand."
""
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. There was soft sweetness of white sugar, light gingerbread, and big banana and bubblegum esters. These mixed nicely, getting you interested from the start. It did, however, lose points on the excessive bitterness and surprising booziness at the end of the flavoring. Each sip felt nice going down, but mouthfeel was otherwise less contributory. This beer is decent for the style and, at times, overly robust in all the wrong places."
""
""
"O: This beer is relatively easy to drink considering its strength and would make for a good strong pale ale to drink on a summer day (if you want something with a little more strength compared to a saison)."
""
""
""
"This beer pours up very pale straw with a thin head, not much retention, lots of delicate lacing, and a generous amount of tiny carbonation bubbles constantly rising from the bottom. The smell is honey, cinnamon, floral, malt, and biscuit. Taste mainly follows the nose with a subtle honey flavor up front followed by spicy hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation. Overall I tend to like beer a bit more powerful, but this offering is quite nice even if it is a milder flavor. Strange that a beer this mild would be called Hades though."
""
"Overall: A really good take on this Belgian style. Good use of Belgian yeast and spices. Fruit taste is solid."

"Overall, this is good beer, and certainly one of the stronger-tasting Belgians on the market. The sheer volume of flavor in here, especially present in the variety and complexity of sugars, is impressive. Unfortunately, the beer gets slightly carried away with these notes, especially as they combine with the heavy alcohol burn, and the result, while delicious, is at the same time slightly overwhelming and distracting, creating a sensation of vodka-soaked fruit cocktail. Worth trying, but beware the burn."
""
""

"Pours very pale blonde, light haze, a little under a finger of white head, little lace as well. Smell is quite malty and biscuity initially, belgian yeast and banana follows, spicy and fruity, mostly apple, quite nice and better as this neared the end. Taste is spicy with clove and banana, yeasty and doughy flavours and a little bit of alcohol, fruity, some earthy hop flavours and a dry bitterness overtop of a light sweetness. Medium carbonation, medium bodied fairly nice feel. Solid belgian pale but nothing about it really stands out, still a drinkable brew."
"Unique taste to compared to others of this style. Stands out from the rest and is worthy of taking up a side shelf in my fridge."

"Great, light-feeling fruity saison-like brew. Has some unique elements to it and hides its strength. Memorable and worthwhile, would definitely have again."
"This is a decent Belgian ale. Unfortunately, it's a bit one-dimensional and boring. Highly drinkable and smooth, it's worth a try. For me though I'll pass in the future."
"Ended up much better than the appearance. Fairly drinkable, but not something I'd want to have again."

"This is a good example of this style."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a nice golden color with a three finger pure white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, fruit, subtle banana, and floral notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, wheat, fruit, and banana. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Surprisingly this one was rather fruit forward upon investigation. While this is definitely good for drinkability it does wear on you after awhile as there was no real balance in it to counter-act this. I would have loved to see just a hint of citrus or bitterness going on to make this one a little more balanced. The alcohol is nowhere to be found though if that is more your thing. Worth trying if see it sitting around on the shelves."

"Ehh, nothing to great about this beer which is a bit disappointing considering Great Divide and what they put out there."
"Solid American influenced Belgian. Not overly complex, but there's enough in there to keep it interesting."
"Very nice Belgian light pale ale, not terribly complex but very tasty and highly drinkable."

"O: Pretty good BSPA."

"I really enjoyed this beer. It has a perfect blend of Belgium yeast with bittering hops. It pours super clear golden color (a bit surprising for a Belgium.) Smell - crisp/bright/citrusy Belgium yeast. Taste is well balanced of pale ale meets Belgium ale. If you like pale ale you'll dig this. It's a good break from straight forward pales ales. If you like Belgium ales you'll dig this too. It's not too sweet and not overly bitter. Alcohol is very well masked, you can barely tell it's a 7+ abv. I love Great Divide beers - haven't had a bad one yet! Nice work GD!"

"A nice Belgian ale, light and flavorful. Would love this on draught."
"All the flavors you want from a big strong Belgian pale ale with the drinkability of a smaller Belgian pale ale. Amazing."
""
""
""

"Overall not a super impressive beer. Good belgian qualities but there are better on the market. Very drinkable though. Great yeast strain."
""
""
""
"O- Ok beer. Middling."
"I would like to enjoy more bottles of this in the summer. Hades was a light feeling beer, which does a good job of hiding 7.8% ABV. I am going to look around for this in New Jersey to store for the summer."
"Great Divide did a credible job with Hades Ale. It’s pretty good stuff. It does have a few blemishes. The nose could use more strength and perhaps the strong spiciness could be toned down just a tad. It’s pretty enjoyable overall though. Worth checking out."

"Poured from bottle to tulip the beer pours a bright yellow straw color with a minimal head, not much retention nor lacing. Average looking beer, very little carbonation noticeable. The nose is more impressive with a nice blend of belgian yeast, sweet malt, and earthy hops. The flavor is also pleasant, a mix of cereal bread malt character with belgian yeast esters and earthy hops, well balanced, easy to drink and not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. Overall, a lighter take on a belgian strong, but sill good."
""
"First foray into Great Divide's catalog. Recommend that you pour it into a glass with a wide bowl and with room for a nice, foamy head. Bubbles disappear quickly, but go a long way in releasing all the bouquet and flavors. Smells almost like a white wine: a Riesling. Fruity and slightly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. In fact, the sweetness gives way to a nice hoppiness after a few moments. Nice aftertaste, i.e. no real bitterness. Very, very nice Belgian ale."
"This beer poured a light golden color with a nice white head that dissipated rather quickly. The aroma was fruity and biscuity and very pleasant. The taste was similar and very crisp. The mouthfeel was good. I guess I enjoyed this more than most as I was surprised by the mediocre ratings. I liked it a lot and will have again in the future. Good stuff."

"Had this one a long time ago and remember being indifferent towards it, but recently been in the mood to revisit it. Pours a yellow, golden color. Looks like apple juice. A little over a thumbs width white head. The yeast is the first thing I smell and it hit me the moment I poured it into my glass. As it settles the yeast maintains its strength alongside some breadiness from the malt. The funkiness of the yeast is definitely the most assertive of the features and I kinda wish they dialed it down just a tad. Same deal with the flavor, the yeast is what hits the hardest and I think it hit me way too hard. The yeast didn't hide the rest of the flavors though, which were bready, a touch of hops, and a peppery and fruity finish. A nice creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel with a nice dose of carbonation to keep it alive in your mouth. I definitely enjoyed it more this time around than the first time but not as much as I'd hoped to. If they could tone the funk down I think this would be much more enjoyable for me. I drank one bottle of this, I couldn't drink any more without taking a break."
"good basic belgian style pale ale. pours a plain looking light adjunct lager color with a one inch white head. smells like german malts and belgian yeast. in your face and strong there. flavor is a little hoppy with a nice yeast crispness at the end. like a vienna lager in the finish. mouthfeel is too light for me, but plenty of bubbles and a nice sturdy abv for such a light feeling brew. dangerously sessionable. going to be good with some spice grilled burgers!"
"overall this was an OK beer but not something that i would personally seek out"
"DOA"
""
"Overall I am stunned on how high the brothers rate this since it seems like a ""light"" Belgium beer. Sure it's smooth and pale but nothing seemed to stand out to make it special. Would consider getting an actual Belgium pale or Prankster over this."

"Dr: Drinkable but lackluster. Wouldn't get it again. $1.00 for a sampler is a fair price, but I wouldn't seek this out in bottle form by any means."
"D - Good balance of hops and Belgian spiced yeast, but could have used a bit more body; the head didn't form as well as I would have like and the taste was a bit of a let down with the nice nose it had to start"

"Great Divide Hades Belgian Style Ale: Here is a unique offering. I poured this beer into a Leffe goblet glass that I picked up in Europe. The Hades has the look of an aged Chardonnay, very little head and a bright straw color. Almost no carbonation. Even though it looks more like wine than beer, the aroma is 100% Belgian Ale. The distinctive yeast aroma is abundant. And that Belgian yeast, bread and sweetness come through in the flavor, but not in an overpowering fashion. The Hades is light compared to any Tripels, has a bit of a dry hoppy finish, but make no mistake, there is plenty of Belgian style enjoyment. Very highly recommended for a lighter twist on the Belgian theme."

"O- I've never had a beer by these guys that's any less than great and this one's no exception."
"Overall a better drink than I expected. ABV is not overly present and flavors work together nicely."
"I would be the first to admit this beer has some qualities that certain beer drinkers would shy away from. It has a dry finish and can be at times slighty bitter due to the phenols and high ABV, yet the flavor of this beer is truly outstanding, with a very complex, yet balanced flavor profile that starts fruity/sour, mellows to a smooth carmel maltiness and finishes with a crisp bite. This complex flavor profile makes the beer suprisingly easy to drink and the balance makes this a beer that doesn't overpower the senses in any one category like some strong ales tend to do. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers from what is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Pours a nice light golden color with a small head that lingers for a few minutes before fading away. It's a belgian style with some light malt character. The taste is slightly bitter and tastes like a belgian style. Hops give it a slight hop bitterness. it has a slight grassy taste and almost wheat character. It's not really my type of beer and won't be buying this one again any time soon."
"This was a pretty good beer. It did come off as slightly boozy along with being on the richer side."
"Overall: Drinkability is excellent. I thought the hop character and complexity was better than would be expected."
" Overall an okay ale, perhaps a bit one sided with the soapy hops taking complete control."
"O - A nice take on the style. I liked the milder flavor this particular Belgian yeast imparted."
"Sharply carbonated, but rightly so."
"O- Subpar. Can't imagine that I'll revisit this one. Was a let down from an otherwise good brewery."
"This Belgian-style ale sports a light golden color and moderate carbonation, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the head, which was 2 centimeters thick and disappeared as quickly as the marquis de Lafayette did from history after the American Revolution, and as the head receded it left very little lacing on the glass. The Hades smells strongly of yeast, which is far more pleasing than brimstone. Yeast dominates the flavor of the beverage as well, along with distinct biscuit and wheat flavors that hide the alcohol taste, and, as the beer warms up, some relatively sweet spice notes. It's also a little more full-bodied than its appearance would suggest. All in all, this is a pretty good buy if you're looking for a nice, medium bodied bitter beer."
"Pours a virtually clear golden yellow with a thin layer of head that leaves a decent coating of head made of miniscule bubbles that slide down the glass quickly and cling only occasionally. Smell is mostly grainy sweet malt with a bit of hop presence, only the faintest bit of yeast. Taste is just how it smells but with a bit more yeast and lagery twinge to it in the finish. Super light in body with a lot of carbonation. Overall its yummy, but nothin to write home about. Get'em cheap in mix packs now and then and its always a drinkable option. Alcohol is well disguised. Also have a couple sitting in the cellar -why not?"
"Clear, golden yellow body. Disappointed in the small head formation and retention. Smell isn’t overly Belgian spicy, which is a surprise. Getting just faint hints of banana and spice. In fact, its maltiness reminds me of a maibock. Nice flavor with a lot of yeast fuitiness—a surprising quality. Finish has some alcohol heat. Body is medium in weight, but a little low on carbonation. I want this to be sparkling and effervescent like Duvel is. Doughy, slightly sweet malts are balanced well with the grassy hops. It really does taste/feel lighter than its ABV%. I think the yeast is providing the overriding character to this beer—not a bad thing. It’s quite a unique ale fruitiness. Another well done style of beer to round out Great Divide’s diverse portfolio. I didn’t expect any less."
"Overall: great session beer. This is a very pleasant beer I will definately try again."
"Overall its decent. Not much to get excited about, but decent."
"O: By far, this is the best non-Belgian Belgian I’ve had. As I said above, this one even outshines some of the true Belgians I’ve sampled. Well done, Great Divide. With an experience like this, it’s no doubt that I’ll probably be trouncing through their line-up in the near future. Next stop, Denver (again)."
"This beer seems better to be had straight from the bottle..."
"The mouthfeel is at once crisp and creamy, filling the nmouth while never losing its nip, though it fades when it's been sitting a bit. Carbonation is active and the body is medium."
"Overall, lots of flavor in this one, not to be missed!"
"Light bodied with a slightly watery, crisp mouthfeel. Floral, earthy hops provide faint bitterness which is countered by some light fruit, zesty spice and some alcohol sweetness. Hints of pepper and coriander followed by some apple, pear and light grapes. Easy to dink but not complex or very interesting."
"The aroma was light, pears, apples, hints of light lemon an citrus pops in it. Nice. Warming brings hints of the yeast and nice touches of the bready touches of. Light, well balanced flavor. Hints of citrus and pears nicely balanced against light bready notes, hints of grain and a nice well balanced feel. Very, very drinkable and just a very well rounded light belgian ale."
"Summer fruit nose with smells and all special features of the apple and pear, all present in the nose but not acids. Easy to drink after all. Hop light enough and unfortunately the finish a bit weak. Of course, ideal for summer due to summer fruit flavors and complex proposed but too little, too little for a dark beer called by the name of the Underground God. Not a real ""Belgian-style"" but more a ""american pale ale""."
"Offers a decent Belgian aroma with agitation but it takes too much work to get there. Overall. a fail. Thanks for trying.."
"Overall a decent beer, have had better in this category."
"This beer poured a light yellow golden color with white head and average lacing and rentention the smells were of light malts and slightly yeasty but not overpowering the taste of this beer was just great this was one of my favorites in recent tasting it was smooth full bodied and full of flavors that you would expect in a belgian style beerl very happy woth this choice highly recommend"
"CHEERS!"
"Overall not a bad beer. For me, a bit more hoppiness would have complemented the earthiness. I'd like to try this again."
"Overall – The beer isn't very complex but the taste is very good. The flavours are well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. I'm happy I tried it and I'd buy it again."
"Note: I love BSPAs, but this just doesn't match up with the likes of Duvel and Delirium Tremens. Hades is an acceptable easy drinker with similar flavors, but no more."
"I think it would be interesting to taste this against authentic Belgians in the same style. I think this version would prove more drinkable. Great Divide does the Belgian styles better than their other beers, I think-- the Hades, Belgica, and Hoss are my favorites."
"I so wanna take Cerberus for a walk like that... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises clove, orange peel, nutmeg, black pepper, bread yeast, and coriander. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange syrup, orange rind, clove, black pepper, cardamom, greens, and a touch of flowers in the background. A strange orange-resin bitterness pervades, holding steady in intensity throughout. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a light syrupy feel. Overall, a nice BSPA, but the flavors just aren't for me."
"a-? didnt get that out of the beer, they might be reviewing partly based on price, not sure. anyways, tasted like a collaboration between a pale and ale and a belgian style ale leaning more towards pale. not much complexity to it. light yellow in color, not much head."
"Cheers!"
"O: Very tasty belgian style beer"
"O: Very disappointed. Drainpour."
"August 2007 bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance is of a light amber color, slightly hazy. Small amount of head with poor, quickly fading lacing. Aroma is of well, basically a belgian style beer. I smell hops, yeast, spices, and some orange peel. Mouthfeel is light, with fair carbonation. Taste is of yeast primarily. Some hoppiness is there, and some pine flavors come through. Slight citrusy hints are directed also. This is not my favorite style of brew, but I do appreciate it for what it is. It certainly stood up the test of almost 4 years."
"Flavor is a rich and complex mix of malty sweetness, a rush of spice, and a tinge of hops. The finish brings on an alcohol burn. Layered and delightful, this one's a unique experience."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with very good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Some very nice lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of banana, clove, spicy yeast, and bread. Aromas are a bit weak. Taste of banana, cloves, honey, spices, and some other fruitiness. Fairly dry finish, but there is some slight spicy and fruity sweetness that lingers for a brief period after the finish. No bitterness detected in this as well. Medium carbonation and body, has a good mouthfeel for a Belgian style. Overall, this is quite an enjoyable Belgian style from Great Divide."
"Poured into a snifter a light yellow color with a white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma definitely brought the bready, floral scents. Taste followed with the spice and floral. Feel had quite the bite, a medium body and an oily finish. Overall I enjoyed the beer but not my favorite in the style."
"Overall, this is an average Belgian ale that I probably would not buy again."
"O - Overall this is a pretty enjoyable beer. Its not my favorite not do i think its classified properly, but i drank it and enjoyed it."
"Not sure if this rating is just a result my style preference that deviates away from trippels and Belgian ales but overall this beer delivers in every way according to guidelines with details lacking in taste and aroma. Definitely worth a try but didn't suit my palate."
"8/10"
"This is a pretty solid offering from Great Divide. It was nice to drink it relatively fresh since I don't see this specific beer from Great Divide that much. Nothing outstanding, but it's good."
"D: enjoyable as a sipper. No doubt this is a full ~8% brew. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the range of Belgian style."
"Great Divide Hades is a crystal clear, bright golden ale with a soft white head that fades to a film. It has an aroma of tropical fruit, bubble gum, banana, papaya; fresh, rich soil and hay. It's medium bodied and lively. The finish is chewy, but dry. It's quite dry and pretty bitter. It tastes very earthy, with notes of soil, hay and apples. There's a grassy bitterness at the finish. This is pretty fun to drink. I can't ever see turning this down."
"Drinkabilty - Its ok to drink. Theres nothing special about this and i relaly dont enjoy the aftertase. Alcohol is right at the limit of drinking more then one. Its ok, nothing special, alot better stuff out there."
"I could have a pint or 2 but that is all, if true to style and represenitive it is a quality brew."
"Usually I'm fairly happy with this brewery. Sorry guys, go back to the drawing board on this one. Keep the yeast strain and scratch the rest."
"Great Divide's Belgian style offerings have never impressed me. Hades is no exception. There's nothing bad here, it's just wanting of elegance and nuance relative to the flag-bearers of the style."
"Smells tame but pleasant, with floral, clove and tangy yeast aromas all present, but all mild. Tastes a touch more lively, with a certain spiciness (white pepper?) and a bit of lemon perking things up. Lacking in crispness and carbonation, and there's a bit of a clingy sweetness in the finish. It's not bad at all, but it's pretty forgettable."
"Overall a pretty good beer this is not a complex beer but it is a tasty drinkable ale for sure."
"Notes: I am very impressed with this great example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale from Great Divide!!!"
"D: Another fantastic Great Divide beer, this is a great session and sipping beer, offer it to your skeptical macro-loving friends. I will most assuredly being going back and buying more of this, especially for hot muggy Summer months in Chicago."
"Straw yellow body with a faint white head that persists throughout. Slightly hazy. Aroma is filled with Belgian yeast, fruity esters and citrus. Very spicy aroma. As expected, the aroma translates to a lemon peppery, spicy Belgian flavor. Malt profile is moderate, with little to no hop presence. Thin body with moderate carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but nothing extraordinary."
"D: Low, based on the unpleasant taste and worse aftertaste. Drinking it reminded me of an American Pale (Adjunct) Lager; a friend I shared my bottle with felt the same way. Quite happy that I split the 12 oz, despite my usual enjoyment of Great Divide products. I generally enjoy Belgian Strong Pale Ales, and in a blind taste test it would have taken me a very long time to identify this as such."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. It's a decent beer, but a bit bland. For the style, not one of my favorites at all, but it's easy drinking and enjoyable."
"the aroma of this beer reminds me of rasins. its very crisp and citrusy. its over all a good beer that is refreshing. however, im not sure it lives up to its name. i would expect more from a beer called hades. over all i liked this beer. i think of it more as a spring time or summer brew."
"This is a solid beer. Nice representation of the style. Nothing fancy and not a lot of depth, but not shallow by any means."
"Drinkability: Overall I found this to be balanced and not too sweet, but at the same time, it was missing something to put it over the top. Although I was not upset to have bought it, I most likely will not seek it out again."
"Drinkability: Pretty straightforward BSPA that delivers as expected. Refreshing, somewhat complex and quite good even if it doesn't reach the heights of most Belgian-made examples."
"Hazy pale yellow straw color, settles to a wonderful full clear straw color with warmth. Clean white head at pour, settles to a large bubbled white ring at edge. Very belgian smell on the lighter side. Some spiciness in aroma but not huge. Mega Carbonation. Very metallic taste in beginning. Spininess shows up in middle of drink and fades towards end. Good level of sweetness. Clean finish, metallicness comes back in finish. Over all pretty light and easy to take. I enjoyed this one especially for the style."
"Overall probably my favorite of the mix pack (which included Rumble, Titan, and Samurai)."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with ABV on the bottle and no freshness/bottling date. Pale yellow/straw colored, thin head with little retention. The aroma of yeast was all over the place with underlying fruity notes, mostly banana/acetates. Taste is crisp, mildly sweet with a distinct bitter finish. This is a not the easiest of belgian ale's to describe. Not quite a beer that I would go out of my way to get, but is still a good brew to try once. Interesting beer from Great Divide."
"Drink- Would have been nice to have another one while enjoying my meal but only bought a single 12oz. Good Beer."
"Drinkability - This was quite the drinkable ale. It's on the light side of the style so if you're looking for a heavy-hitter you'll be disappointed, but overall this was a pleasant drink."
"Edit: Tried a second bottle, poured at no angle from 2 inches above the glass and still got less than a finger of head. Disappointing brew."
"This one is a fruit forward BSPA. It blends nicely with the sweet malt. I liked it more with every sip. Great Divide has done it again."
"The mouthfeel is extremely creamy, it's thick and robust while being light and fluffy at the same time. This quality makes it very drinkable which for a 7.8% brew can be pretty dangerous although enjoyable nonetheless."
"REally not particularly pleasant. Also too flat."
"This beer is extremely clear. No haze at all. A steady stream of small bubble emerge from the bottom of the glass. It smells fruity and estery. Strong hints of banana. The taste follows with nice spicy clove notes in addition to the fruit. Tastes a little hot for a 7.8% beer."
"First review, thanks for reading!"
"This beer pours a clear golden color with absolutely no head. It was carbonated I swear, just had no head. The aroma had strong hints of a river bank where fish have washed up. The taste was very wheaty with slight hints of apple juice. Overall, not my favorite example of this style. This brewery makes great beers but fell short on this one."
"I really enjoyed this and I don't even like clove...at all!"
"Lightly bitter and long dry finish. Light and easy drinking. Nice and refreshing."
"Poured a pale straw yellow with a half finger of head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was like a belgian beer with the yeast having a good presence along with slight apples, but I could detect sweet malts, hops, a liitle citrus, and spice. Like the nose belgian yeast was definitely there but it did have more of a spice kick on the palate with slight citrus, malts, and hoppy accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, hoppy, slight spice finish. It drank quite well and would like to have some more if I can get my hands on it."
"D: This is a very good beer in a category in which the Americans are clearly in catch up mode towards the Belgians. Classic flavours, and at $1.99 a single, it is extremely well priced in a category where the average Belgian is sitting at $4, and for that reason alone is worth a rebuy."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent along with a very fruity yeast character. It's dry and peppery with a bit of funk as well. There is light hop aroma as well. The taste is decent. It has a tremendous yeast character, but it lacks depth in the malt bill. It could use a specialty malt or two to round out the flavor. The yeast provides tons of complexity. It's dry and funky with peppery/Saison -like feel. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable Belgian inspired beer. It would be a good beer to transition someone into this style. It's full of esters and drinks well."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and I cannot detect any of the ABV. Is it a great example of the style? Not really, but it is a very tasty and well made golden ale with a bit of Belgian flare."
"All in all, it's just about perfect for style. There isn't much of anything about this beer that I would say wasn't done well."
"A keeper on my shelf."
"D- Wouldn't call this my favorite Belgian. The more I drank the beer, the more it began to nag on me."
"M- High carbonation. This should be a prickly beer anyway, but its a bit much. Not too dry but there is a powdery yeasty feel."
"This is a really enjoyable beer. Well brewed, true to style, considerably cheaper than Duvel, and delicious. I would gladly buy this again and recommend trying it."
"Mouthfeel is the weakest part of this beer, as it's nicely carbed and has medium body, but the finish is slightly watery (enough to not only notice but to be distracted by). Overall this was nice - I'm not saying it's up there with Duvel or Damnation, but it's refreshing and more of a light, summery take on the style. Would drink again for sure!"
"Overall- not bad, solid american take on the bspa style"
"D- Quite good. Pity those who drink this from a bottle, a Belgian-style like this needs to be opened up and explored, not simply peer upon it's surface with crude glug-glugs from a dusty, dirty old bottle! Pour this in a proper glass, and tell me it's not great!For it's strength, I'd like a few more of these, please."
"D: I would not drink more than one of these, and I do not want to buy it again. I cannot recommend this beer."
"The medium body is kept alive and easily drinkable by the perfect amount of carbonation and overall crispness. The feel is almost cottony as it fades into a lingering chalky finish."
"d-it is drinkable, but for the style I found it lacking. I would drink this if others of the style are not available. But I would rather have a Duvel."
"Thinnish head of about a finger or so, pure white without much retention, fluffy, no lacing either. Light metallic glow to the mild orange to yellow color, clear with scattered minuscule bubbles here and there. Yeasty, herbaceous nose with an ashen, stony stripe, not bitter but stiff nostril presence, pepper, cumin, coriander spice, acts like it's going to hit you with the banana then swerves into green apple, pear and sour lemons, abundance of wheat germ, straw and hay, earthy enough that there's minimal lift. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation adds a soft, round texture to the mouth, helpful given the general tartness of the flavors, peppery, dried yeast cells, raw wheat and unprocessed grains, the lemon to grapefruit citrus dried out and evanescent. Not much more can be said for the peach, apricot, pear, red apple fruit in spite of the downy carbonation. Clove and coriander as well as some crushed flowers do pretty up the finish. No glaring flaws, just kinda boring."
"D - This is a decent Belgian golden ale, but diverges slightly from the norm as the yeast esters are really restrained and the hop presence is a bit more than expected. Really, it seems more light a Trappist-style tripel in nature with the hops focused as they are. Nonetheless, it's worth a try and worth the money, just might not meet some expectations for the style."
"This is a really good Belgian Pale Ale. What I would expect the style to be, and very enjoyable. Something I highly recommend."
"D-The yeast flavors lingered throughout which could be a negative for some but this beer has good drinkability and enough going on to hide that almost 8% ABV."
"DB- The smell got me very excited but the flavor was sort of average, once again Belgian notes that are too powerful. Not bad by any means but there needs to be a bit less bitterness and some more balance here. Not my favorite Great Divide beer, that's for sure."
"Very very drinkable and easily pairs wiht lots of light meats and veggies. A good food beer."
"D= Pretty nice Belgian style ale... Not the greatest I've ever had. Reminds me of Duvel a little bit but I would rather drink Duvel anyday. Worth a shot however."
"Average drinkability for a belgian. A few of these would be ok even with the moderate to high alcohol content."
"The flavor profile is bursting at the seams, yet there is a level of drinkablity that stays true even for its slightly higher than average ABV. A rare Belgian yeast strain is used and it shows, the rarest of the Trappist brews come to mind with each sip--a guess, of course. A bullseye for Great Divide here, it's great to see a craft brewer tackle such a temperamental style and come out on top."
"The appearance is golden in color to almost light amber. The nose reveals malt and grassy tones.Taste is all about the herbal belgian yeast. Malty body with distinctive belgian character. Mouthfeel is very light for being over 7%. Drinkability....if you are in the mood for belgian styles, it is very high. I had this at room temp. and it was very good. It has a rustic refinement at room temp. Sounds like a misnomer, but until you try it, it seems to fit. Simliar to style of Celis Grand Cru, I like Celis Grand Cru, but this is better. Tastes cleaner, very true to style, without a doubt worth trying."
"F: Finishes mostly dry, but not too dry. Some more Belgian malts and yeast flavors, with a hint of fermented and dried Belgian candi sugar that has turned to dry feel and a touch of boose. Hints of wheat again, with a little banana and lemongrass. More fruit, with a little citrus to go with the wheat. Chewy malts, Belgian malts, and slight toasty malts linger. Slight lingering grassy bitterness."
"Another great offering from Great Divide."
"Like Belgium pale ales? Like American brewers? Cheers, this one is good for you."
"Taste a little underwhelming, looking for a little more, but nonetheless a nice beer, for my money, prefer Pranqster."
"pours a yellow color with a small head for a belgian and a small white ring..smell is clove and yeast with bread and citrus..taste is same with yeast and clove with bread and malt then a crisp citrus zing mouth feel is light medium with a good finish..not one of my favorites of the style or from great divide"
"I really have a thing for Duvel. I am pretty hard on beers in this category because I can't help but judge them with Duvel as the ideal. I enjoyed Hades. I don't have a lot of experience with aged BSPA's but I really liked this. Could have been more complex. Great Divide rarely disappoints and that trend continues here."
"A little fruitier in aroma than the original but great pale copper color with good light carbonation. I'll get this again and again."
"M/D: This beer has a nice mouthfeel with a lot of little bubbles. It is very drinkable and I enjoyed it. Then again, Great Divide typically does not disappoint."
"well i finished off my keg of this stuff and released i never did review it, so i figured i'd go ahead and review it. has a really nice cloudy orange color to it, looks like a hefeweizen really, had a big white head that laces a bit. smell is good, has a great yeasty aroma to it, like all great belgian or belgian style the yeast is a huge part of the beer. taste is good too, while at nearly 8% you'd be hard pressed to tell. its an easy to drink beer and a very good one, i'd defintely buy another keg of this beauty"
"Very easy drinking. Drinks like a lighter Duvel."
"Overall not bad, A liked this better than I did."
"i enjoyed the drink as well onthis one. so light and refreshing. never taste or feel the near 8%. a very nice beer to session, good for them hot days. as far as american belgian pales go, this is top notch. goes down too easy. i highly recommend."
"Pours a pale straw yellow color, capped off with a big rocky white head. A light hoppy aroma, along with white pepper, honey and a light fruitiness. Some sweet malt on the palate, along with some Belgian spices, honey malt and yeast. A nice solid example of the style, but nothing more."
"Overall, I was really surprised by this brew. With so many takes on ""Belgian Style Ales"" around, Hades really manned up. I could definitely see getting this again."
"Overall= Good American take of a Belgian style ale. Impressed by Great Divide Brewery."
"Pours a mrdium golden with a thin white head. Decent retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is is of spice,fruit and floral hops.Body is light and crisp. Taste is of sweet fruit up front with a nice tart finish. Clove and spice through out. Really nice for the warmer weather,or anytime."
" Drinkability is good, especially for somewhat high alcohol beer."
"D: Highly recommended. Try with good artisanal cheeses, or an omelet. A crab omelet would be especially nice. Or spinach. Or asparagus...."
"Excellent beer and drinks really easy. the abv may be a bit high to be marked as 'sessionable' but the alcohol is well masked in the taste. Great Divide has done it again folks."
"A good ale. I'd drink it if I were living in America, and wanted to try the triple style."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable, American version of a Belgian beer."
"D: Highly recommended. Try with good artisanal cheeses, or an omelet. A crab omelet would be especially nice. Or spinach. Or asparagus...."
"D - Not enjoying this that much. Definitely my least favorite from this great brewery."
"D-this is a pretty solid tasting beer; but it seems a little rough around the edges. Not a bad drink and definitely quite refreshing."
"Effervescent and strongly carbonated. Certainly drinkable, but unless it is in someone else's fridge it won't be something I put in mine."
"Pours a very light straw yellow color with a film head with some lacing. The aroma is of lemon, wheat, and some breadiness. The taste is of a wheat backbone with a lemon kick over the top and maybe a little floral hop taste. The mouthfeel is light bodied. The drinkability is high, there is nothing to make you dislike this beer, very solid."
"This is so similar in style to Duvel, but it doesn't match up in the full package. It's solid but not great."
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Poured a translucent straw gold with a two inch, loose, bright white head embedded with copious tiny bubbles. Head eventually settles into a skim, leaving thick, delicate bands of lacing as the brew recedes. Nose reveals lemons, yeast and perhaps a hint of candi sugar - very subdued. Taste follows nose - somewhat dull in flavor - a wheaty quality behind a mild citrus character with just the lightest hint of candi sugar. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild background carbonation, a little acidity, and a fairly clean finish. Definitely an Americanized Belgian Strong Pale. Not much in terms of a Belgian yeast character, and lacking the big candi sugar and slightly herbal essence common to the style. All and all, pretty bland, but easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. I wouldn't turn one down, but I probably won't pick this up again."
"A nice taste full of the bready yeast and a balanced grain and straw malt end with a moderate impact of dry hops. The strength of the alcohol is covered quite well. An excellent beer."
"An okay Belgian-styled ale. It doesn't hold a candle to the standard of the style, which is Duvel, but then again, what beer does."
"Value: All in all, a decent stab at a Belgian Ale from Great Divide. I can't say it's much worse than Chimay Blonde and about 1/3 the price! Plus, it's a full 12 oz bottle. I dig Great Divide."
"Good drinkability."
"D - It is refreshing, with moderately high ABV and an unobtrusive character, so its very drinkable. But I wouldn't prefer this given reasonable alternatives."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable and the best thing about it not being Belgian is the price tag...80% OFF! Of course it's all about the taste and though I didn't mark the taste of this beer as good it's more than adequate with nice elements to it."
"T: This is yet another nice offering my local crew at Great Divide. I'm really glad I stopped into the Tap Room and gave it a whirl."
"I was expecting this to fall a little short compared to it's real Belgian contemporaries but it certainly lives up to the best examples of the style."
"The feel of this beer light and pretty easy going down. Is easy on the pallet and is refreshing with is spicy, crisp flavor."
"Light bodied and fizzy, a bit over carbonated. Very nice drnker the abv is not noticable, Not really sessionable, but a nice drinker."
"Poured to a one inch head that didnt hang around very long. Head was white in color. Ale itself was a cloudy lemon yellow color. Left some minimal lacing of rings when drank. Very light smelling, just of lemon and yeast. Tasted of corriander, lemons and yeast. Also perhaps of bread. I didnt think it was all that hoppy. Had a slight bitter alcohol aftertaste. Felt light in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Im glad I tried this Ale. I just dont think I would want to make it a session beer."
"Pours a decent straw goldn. Minimal head retention is kind of dissapointing. A little banana in the nose, hops as well. Not too sweet up front, crisp. Sours out at the end, with a defined hop bitterness at the end. Finishes moderately dry. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Alcohol comes through, not in a bad way."
"D: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. Nicely done, and something I would pick up again. Well Balanced, and just enough sweetness and spice."
"D- Overall, I'm not sure I'd go for this again but I believe it's worth a try as the Great Divide has som great brews."
"Some clove, some continental-style lemongrass hops, with a decent smack of alcohol. Pretty solid effort, but I doubt I'll be back."
"Notes: This beer really made a ""comeback"" in my book since the look and the smell left something to be desired but this is a nicely brewed Belgian Pale Ale that really hit the mark. Another nice beer from Great Divide."
"big white head, and a slightly golden yellow body. head retains quite well and laces all over the glass. the body is lightly turbid. the nose is quite bold, offering up a large grainy presence and a slight sour apple flavour; there is minimal to no yeast, spice, or alcohol. the taste is quite sweet, much like the la chouffe bspa. there is a huge artificial banana flavour that dominates. the hops fall quite short in restraining the sweetness, though there is a definite bitter aspect to the beer, it is hardly noticeable to any great extent. the feel is medium with abundant carbonation, which could be crisper."
"drinkability - halfway through the glass i thought about tossing it but i went ahead and finished - but i would never buy this again - good thing i just got a single in a mix6"
"Pours golden with a thin white head. Nose has caramel grains, spicy alcohol and Belgian yeast. Taste is also sweet, but a bit dull for the style. Some nice clove and peppery yeast flavors though. Medium body a comes off a tad thick. Not bad, but nothing special."
"D - Fairly high."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Clear yellow with lots of carbonation. Very small head, ring of lace that slides, but doesn't stick. Fruity bananas and berries aroma. A tingle from the carbonation up front with some honey sweetness and a touch of alcohol. Big middle with lots of grain. More bitter than I would have expected. Carbonation bite and bitterness in upper palate at the finish."
"Drinkability- A very easy drinking offering. It wouldn't be hard to get through a 6 pack of these at all."
"Bottle poured into a small chalice. This one is a light golden color.. very fizzy and well carbonated. From appearances alone this pretty much resembles champagne. Smell is bubblegum, spicy, peppery, and slightly sweet. Taste is not quite what I expected: a lot more in terms of hoppiness and bitterness. Mild alcohol punch and slight grassy flavors."
"D: A nice drinking Belgian style that had a good slightly tart and dry fruitiness fit per style that was easy to down and enjoy. Fruity, spicy with a dry finish will keep you sippin. AT 7.3% abv the alcohol will catch up to you before you tire of this drink. A perfect thirst quencher with a nice dry champagne finish makes this a recommend."
"D. Should be drank just below room temp. Not something that I would seek out again after having drank 6 of them. Overall I was not that impressed."
"D= Not my favorite beer in the style (by a long shot) but definitely a worthy beer all the same. I would gladly drink this again if it was put in front of me!"
"Overall I was surprised the ABV was as high as it is on this - I thought it was more of a Belgian Pale and thought the ABV was following that. To make a long story short I enjoyed this beer and you probably will too. Worth a shot."
"(D)- What an interesting beer. Great classic belgian characteristics with solid pale influences. Light, crisp, and very refreshing. A 6pk on a great summers day would not last long, let alone any day of the year! A superb example of the style it is."
"Drinkability: Well, the smell and taste is decent, but the mouthfeel is too thin for me. On the plus side, there is very little noticable alcohol, and its quite refreshing. Not bad, not great."
"Very easy to drink and enjoyable. At 7.8% abv the alcohol is rather well hidden. Excellent summer beer."
"Overall a nice affordable Belgian strong pale. Not the best but certainly tasty."
"Drinkability is decent as well. I was expecting better, but got a wholly inoffensive but generally average beer."
"Pours a pale yellowy-golden with bright white foam and is slightly hazy--in a nice sort of way. Nose is quite bready with a bit of honey and some faint spice notes. Very nice mouthfeel, very crisp and elegant with brisk effervescence. Taste is nice and dry with just the faintest bi of honey. Finish is not particularly dry, but lingers with a pretty characteristic golden ale flavor. This is a pretty enjoyable beer, although the name throws me a bit...the beer actually seems quite friendly and tame, not really one I would associate with the underworld. If I had my druthers I might prefer a bit more complexity with a punch. Worth a try though, especially since it's quite refreshing."
"Overall- Light, but flavorful and enjoyable"
"Good carbonation, refreshingly light on this summer day; not bad but a little disappointing."
"[1x-DNL]"
"D- I could slug this down because there isn't that much flavor, but I would find myself wanting more."
"d - this is a good belgian with all things considered. They won't put duvel out of business but a good economical alternative."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with strong carbonation."
"Drinkability: Strikes me as being very average for the style. There is not enough going on here to make me want to reach for another one."
"single from Grape & Gourmet, VA Beach...bottled April 03, 2009"
"12oz, 2009. Poured a golden color with remarkable clarity topped with a bubbly white head that dissipated rather quickly. Aromas were fruity reminiscent of apple juice with some familiar Belgian yeasts. Tastes were also fruity - apples with hints of pear and banana. Alcohol at 7.8% seemed non-existent. Mouth-feel was on the thin side, but has good carbonation. Finishes extremely crisp and is very refreshing with a hint of spiciness at the end. Overall, decent take on a Belgian Pale Ale, but flavors seemed on the weaker side - I hate to say watery, but maybe more like apple juice. Essentially, I expected it to be more 'Belgian' and more bold in flavor."
"This poured a clear straw color with a bit of white head. It smelled like earthy wheat and cereal grain and wild Belgian yeast, with lemon and grassy hops. It tasted like lemon and grassy hops with sour Belgian yeast, and some earthy wheat. It was a bit oily with a little carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was pretty basic and simple for a Belgian style ale. It had a clean taste, but the flavor wasn't exciting or very rewarding. It was just a sour pale ale with mediocre body. However, it did hide the alcohol very well, so it was quite easy to drink. Not bad but probably not worth buying again. I prefer something with more character."
"D- the alcohol and spices combined with the large amount of carbonation makes for a weird combination. something i wont touch again for a while. hopefully some time smooths this one out. in its current state its just not for me."
"I saw the review after buying this beer, and much to my surprise, I was blown away. As someone who is recently getting into the Belgian strong pale, I found the Hades to be very well balanced, especially drinkable and perfect at the evening BBQ I was attending. The consensus around the table was clear. Hades is a damn tasty beer. Maybe because I got a very fresh (new label) bottle, but this was no ""B" beer. Kudos to Great Divide"
"Taste is grainy with a bunch of alcohol drying, like chomping on a handful of dehusked wheat kernels with a slurp of champagne. Yeast does not seem to contribute enough in the way of fruity esters, leaving the low specialty grain bill (if any) with a tough task of masking the fairly high ABV. For me, it does not have a huge Belgian presence and I am a bit let down by this beer."
"This beer pours a pale golden color. The head is a quarter inch of white foam that recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma of Belgian malts, biscuits, yeast, leather, some spicy hops. It is a nice aroma with good complexity, but it seems a little weak for a beer of this strength. The taste is more pronounced than the aroma. There is a good malt base, firm yeast notes, and a stronger hop presence. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I can see myself drinking again."
"Pours a super clear golden hay color. Quick dispersing head and subpar bubbling. Looks like a pilsner. Sweet, lightly toasted, candy light malt aroma with some yeasty fruits and very light grassy hops to balance the aroma a little. The taste starts sweet and dry on the palate. The malts come out a little more, but the yeast and malts thin to a heated, alcohol, finish. Sweet, yet quick palate that tastes more like a dumbed Belgian style."
"Overall an okay example of the style but it doesn't hold a candle to some other American examples of the style like Pranqster and Matilda in my opinion."
"Drinkability: I, personally, am a fan of this style so I could drink a good amount of these. Not the best in the class by far but an easy drinking and a good price. Try Duvel or a Unibroue ale for other good examples of this style."
"Poured a clear gold with two-finger head that quickly died and left some fair lacing. A sharp, sour fruit smell of appels and pears along with a bit of yeast and some faint malts. Has a sharp, somewhat offbalanced taste as the leafy hops and sour fruit (apple, pear, hints of tropical) somewhat overpower the malts, although this is still somewhat smooth and finishes crisp but clean. Not a bad Belgian pale ale at all, but I couldn't see myself picking this over the real thing."
"A pretty decent U.S. version of the style, but not something I'd characterize as great. A little too fruity, heavy and boozy tasting for anything more than one bottle, so I don't think I'd order another if consuming it on tap. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll be drawn to it again."
"Drinkability: VERY disappointed here. I wonder what went wrong, especially since everything I've had from Great Divide has been great. I'd stay away from this one and stick to the Belgians. Glad I only got one bottle."
"The flavor first hits with light sweetness, honey maybe, then kicks in with yeast spice and clove, then finishes with that slightly off, somewhat astringent spice note again. Mouthfeel is plenty dry and peppery and it makes for one of the more refreshing 7.8% you may have. The goods just don't really do it for me."
"D: Flavorful, crisp and dry. Disguises the abv pretty well. Nicely balanced."
"Quite a bit fruitier than Duvel, and it is also a fair bit sweeter too. It is quite a bit different than Duvel, but it similarly needs to be enjoyed with a dedicated full bottle and a bit of time as it starts to grown on you if you spend some contemplative time with the beer. But this is quite a bit better than the beers reputation had me thinking. This is definitely an enjoyable beer that is a bit too easy to drink given the beer's strength."
"Served in a cervoise glass."
"D: Enjoyable? Sure. Memorable? Not so much. Though I do think it would go great with some salmon."
"Overall, I am surprised and more than a little underwhelmed by this offering from a really great brewery. This is not really Belgian in character and is a watered down version of a BSPA at best. Don't bother picking this one up."
"An Ok Belgian Pale, nothing special."
"A nice light golden color with a one finger frothy white head that goes away quickly. Aroma is lightly floral,spicy, apple,coriander.,very yeasty. Flavor is banana, bubblegum, coriander.grass,light grains, notes of alcohol, and candy sugar. Light to medium body,high carbonation,crisp mouthfeel,with a dry spicy finish. Very drinkable, I would buy this again."
"warm and slightly nutty brew. hops are quite significant as well. in fact, i am unsure of what the beer would taste like without them (and don't mean that quite in the same way as i would of a hop-bomb IIPA). belgian yeast runs the show and the diminished foam bears witness, in the form of faint ringlets. quite bitter"
"Clear strawish golden hue under one finger white quickly dissipating head. Pears, apples and Meyer lemons in the nose and taste buds. Pretty effervescent mouthfeel with alcohol well hidden. Fairly dry finish. Taste is nothing spectacular, not an exemplar in a difficult category. If given my druthers, I prefer Pranqster. Glad I tried it, but not something I'd purchase again."
"Also, bottling date stamped on is 1/18/09, so I know it isn't an old bottle."
"Overall, pass."
"That being said....this is a well made belgian and I would recommend it to fans of the style."
"Overall: Great brew! I will be picking up some more of this. It's really got a great balance of all the things that make an excellent beer. Try it!"
"D- This a great Belgian pale for an American brewer. Easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, ginger, some clove, tart malt, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. There's also a slight dryness associated with this brew. Tastes of slight yeast cleanliness up front, then a sweetness next, then slight tart malt comes through, some sweet malt in the background, and a slight hint of spice in the finish. A very smooth finish and overall a deceivingly good beer based on the clear, pale yellow appearance. Not the best example of the style I've had, but also a lot better than others - worth a try."
"Notes: surprised when the carrier said ""top 25 of 2007 on BA"". tasted more like a strong cream ale"
"D- This is totally sessionable. Granted, I would be pretty tossed after a sixer, 7.3% isn't as deadly as the usual 9%+ often associated with this style."
"Picked up a six pack at Wine Gallery in Kenmore Sq. Poured into stemmed crystal glassware. Very bright and crisp yellow color. Large pillow-like head that left good lacing. Quick surge of carbonation at the first pour. Smelled a bit malty up front with a hint of wheat. Taste was quite refreshing. Nice blend of hoppy bitterness with Belgian candied sugar sweetness. A tad sticky in the back of the throat with aftertaste. Drinkable but noticeable abv. Easily drank three in one sitting. Reminds me of a more refined version of Leffe Blonde. Another winner from GD."
"Pours a clear golden/canary color with thick pure white head that sticks around for a bit. Smell is citrusy and a bit spicy. There is a fruit, almost banana flavor, but not quite. Great Beligan spice notes on the front. The finish makes my tongue tingle."
"A very nice interpretation of the style. The general idea of the style is there, and, on its own, is a nice, well-balanced, enjoyable brew."
"The flavor is dominated by malt and yeast and the spice indicates there is some kick to this beer. It's crisp with a dry finish, but you can taste and feel that it's a strong beer that's not too strong. It's a Belgian style with a hint of pepper; an American interpretation that is enjoyable. It's good, but not great."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a nice not-so-strong Belgian that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"D - I could have a couple of these, but after that the herbal flavor would get to me."
"I have enjoyed Great Divide in the past, and am a huge fan of Belgian and Belgian-style ales. I was quite disappointed with this ""Belgian-style."""
"Over all a good attempt at a Belgium by an American brewery, especially for the price! Very easy to drink and at 7.3% alcohol can be deceiving. Now Im off to the Great Divide brewery for their St. Patricks day celebration"
"D - I don't know. I seems like there is too many different tastes going on and my mouth doesn't seem to like that. An OK beer but not one that I would seek out to have again anytime soon."
"Eric"
"Served from a bottle, poured into a tulip glass."
" Light, yet fairly complex, refeshing and sophisticated."
"Feel and Drinkability: Real light bubbly body, should be a bit heavier. Not too bad though. This is one I'll finish and I'll enjoy it but, this isn't quite what I was looking for, especially when I had a craving for something big and tasty like Duvel. To me this is just a poor imitation of something far better, For the money its not really worth it. Not a bad beer by any means, but it really doesn't have enough belgian kick to it."
"The taste was light, similar to its smell, only weaker. This beer is subtly spicy with a watery mouthfeel and no major character notes to speak of. It bounces around in your mouth, but leaves no major distinct flavors other than cloves and oranges. It also leaves the mouth with a slightly bitter, dull aftertaste of flat water on the swallow. Good, not great."
"Maybe a little higher among wheat fans or even Belgian fans...just not what I was expecting. I believe this beer to be very average with little else to offer. It lacks the complexity to be scored any higher."
"Drinkability: Decidedly average, in my opinion, and as all I've had from Great Divide thus far (OA Yeti, Yeti, Old Ruffian, Fresh Hop, Hercules) has been really, really solid, this one comes as a bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, it's not bad, and definitely has its moments, but for 7.3%, I'd be hoping for a little more, especially from such a nice brewery."
"Tastes of hearty sweet malt with some lemon and spice at the end. No indication of high abv. Kinda boring actually. High carbonation ruins the mouthfeel and doesn't fit the taste."
"This is a good brew, lacking a bit of depth but surpassing that with a fine drinkability that beckons for a night of mischief."
"Mouthfeel isn't too heavy or too light. Overall, very nice."
"D - Refreshing soft brew that met my expectations."
"Nicely done, and drinkable. Well-rounded and somewhat easy to drink."
"D-Good, but not spectacular, beer. It's quite enjoyable and refreshing, but does not skimp on the Belgian characteristics and complexity."
"Hats off to Great Divide, this beer does something that U.S. breweries rarely do... to produce a Belgian beer that rivals some of the good ones from Europe."
"overall, this is definitely a good session beer, even at 7.30%, it may bet he fact that it is almost two years old and the hops have been quite subdued, maybe someone can gie me some feedback on a fresher date and different notes. i found this beer to be a bit of a disappointment, i was expecting much more. i haven't had many Belgian strong pale ales, mostly just the strong ales, which could play a part into my notes."
"Prickly feel from the high carbonation level, crisp, but with the chalkiness noted above. Light to medium in feel, this is a very drinkable but indistinct Belgian strong pale."
"This brew is pretty drinkable since its ABV is relatively low. This beer is neither amazing or terrible. Just a good beer to have to sip on."
"D, notes: Despite the lack of full flavor this beer is highly drinkable. This is not a bad beer just not particularly exciting or interesting."
"Pours a clear straw color with a decent pure white head that settled into a puffy cap, not much lacing. The aroma is fairly faint, I pick up some candi sugar and yeast phenols. Smells like it should. The taste is very light for a BSPA, very Stella like. Some light candi sugar and Belgian yeast flavors and spicy hops. The feel is very light, almost watery, very crisp. Though lacking in appearance, aroma, and taste, this brew is quick drinkable. I would say sessionable but the 7.3%ABV would prevent that. A positive is that you don't taste the ABV."
"A step down for Great Divide, but a nice drinking beer none the less."
"I'm a huge fan of GD beers. They predominantly produce some of the premier domestic beers available. Hades is not one of them. I'm lost in attempting to align any of the qualities of this beer to anything that would resemble a Belgian style ale. Other than some faint apricot, peach, green grape sweetness in the aroma and flavor, there's not a whole lot to get excited about here. Very boring and average."
"Pours a pure gold into a snifter. Two fingers of off-white head recede at a comfortable pace and leave well separated spots of lacing all around the glass. Smells of sweet, bready malts, pears, lemons and candy. Tastes of apples, grain, some grass and floral notes in the end. It's medium-bodied and fairly well carbonated. There's not much else to say. It's a straight forward Belgian Strong Pale Ale which maintains a good balance between it's drinkability and taste."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol levels are getting high, though it's very well masked. Flavor profiles don't work well for me, and I think it really detracts from the beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Mild/moderate carbonation, weaker than expected for this style."
"Drinkability is great, as is this beer. I love this style when it's kept simple and clean like this. Add the domestic availability and value packaging and this is probably best in class (save for the flaccid appearance)."
"A: Medium gold, thin layer of tight foam, crystal clear - 3.50, S: Distinctly Belgian aromas, smells like a pale malt and mildly like sweet wet grass - 3.50, T: Crisp and dry, spicy, nice use of bittering hops, hints of lager rather than a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, some lemon grass - 4.00, M: 3.50, D: A pretty straight-forward beer, very drinkable 3.75"
"hmm. I'm a fan of great divide, but this one just kind of misses the mark. Not horrible, but given the fairly readily available options, this one doesn't really jump out at me. Just not quite complex enough to be interesting. Leaps and bounds beyond a macro lager, but kind of lacks a bit in the Belgian Pale category in my book. I could see it pairing nicely with food, but doesn't really stand out on it's own."
"Not bad as a session beer, but if I'm spending this amount for a Belgian, I'd rather have an actual Belgian."
"Pretty drinkable for a 7.3% ABV brew."
"Towards the end however, as the brew warmed up, the yeasty notes began to get a little cloying at times - but overall not a bad brew."
"Hades pours a golden yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a little fruity and a little malty. The mouthfeel is on the thin side. Clove seems to be the flavor that hits first, fading into a grassy hop flavor. Decent, but not as flavorful as I would expect for a Belgian style beer. Worth a try."
"Light/medium bodied, smooth and easily drinkable. A bit lighter in flavor, body and alcohol content than some of the Belgian brews but still a decent intro to the style. Well worth a try."
"One of the few beers from one of my favorite breweries that I had not tried yet,for one Iam not a huge fan of the style,but I was thinkin that maybe GD put their own little spin to this.Poured into a large tulip glass a clear light to medium golden with a very tight sticky one finger bone white head that left broken lace behind as it settled pretty slowly.A mix of overripe pineapple,green apple,and light spicey yeast in the nose,with just a hint of herbal/leaf.Mouthfeel is a little light but not overly watered down,flavors are a little lighter than expected with some phenolic-like clove flavors and some medicinal qualities.Its ok but there are to many traits in this brew that makes me not a huge fan of the style,like say the medicinal compnonent,but in saying that its decent for the style and I wont grade it down because of my feelings about the style."
"D - light tasting and enjoyable to drink"
"Love the fact that this is in 12oz. bottles now, love the new packaging/labels/caps...love Great Divide!"
"The flavor is lighter than expected as was the texture. Pineapple, brown sugar, light bread and melon. The alcohol does not come through in the taste as much as the nose advertised. This is a winner for a session beer. Not too sweet and not too heavy."
"Drinkability - These are pretty easy to drink with how light they are, and generally pleasing on the tongue."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a clear gold with a white head. This is not what a Belgian ale is supposed to look like. This is what a lager looks like. Nose is barely spiced. Flavor is okay. Kind of mild. Dough is there as is some funk. It's decent. Feel is okay on both liquid and carbonation. This is an okay beer. It's not bad by any means. It's just not a very good example of this style. I'm glad they released it in 12 ounce bottles so I didn't have to waste time and money on a bomber."
"This beer is extremely smooth and easy to drink. Considering the reasonable price tag, I will be checking this out again."
"Poured into a snifter. Sweet malts, yeasty and tons of citrus in the nose. not what I expected at first. Pale yellow in color, with some cloudiness. Solid white head, good retention and lacing. Nice flavors...some citrus, very yeasty, some fruity flavors...fall fruits and clove. medium body, some usually Great Divide flavors, smooth and creamy. very drinkable. nice palate and very enjoyable. nice American take on a Belgian."
"The body is light and very easy to drink. A bit high for carbonation but ok for style. Very nice beer, surprised not rated higher."
"Crisp and refreshing with good drinkability, this is an interesting beer."
"I paired this beer with whole wheat spaghetti and meatballs w/homemade marinara sauce and it was perfect. The tangy sauce really went well with the sweetness and alcohol in the beer."
"O/ M - Medium mouthfeel. Enjoyed the beer, but does not seem like a traditional Belgian. Nice spicy flavors."
" A disappointing take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale, tasting at times more like a german hefeweizen than the quintessential Duvel. Probably wouldn't buy again."
"Pours a nice very slight haze golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, nice touch of yeast, some spices, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, nice touch of some kind of spices, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first GD in a long time, they still make some very tasty brew's."
"A good Belgian Strong Ale but not one of my favorites by style or by Great Divide."
"Overall, this is a decent example of the style. It's worth drinking, but there are even better options out there."
"I am a huge fan of Great Divide, but this beer doesn't do much for me. I expected more hops (not true to style, but true to GD). Overall, the beer is OK, but there are better efforts out there in this category."
"D: Surprising for its strength."
"Got this one on the hopes that it'd keep up with the solid Great Divide beers I'd had in the past. Not quite, although nothing too disappointing. Poured a nice light straw color with a fairly weak finger of quickly dissipating head. Looks alright. Nose is nice and tasty; lots of spicy wheat and citrus, with some biscuity hints as well. Malt backbone. Flavor is similar up front, but it actually slips a bit as the beers gone on. The carbonation is too strong, and it combines with this sort of blandness that creeps into the beer. Sadly, the flavor just isn't that good, and the good nose can't disguise it. Overall, it's not terrible, just not terribly good either. A mediocre beer that might serve as an okay intro to the style. Interesting how a lot of American brewers that do some beers so well have a hard time with light Belgians."
"Slightly cloudy yellow pour. Light malt nose almost like the smell of a hot bowl of fresh white rice. Taste is rice-y, wheaty, and moderatley spiced in the style of a wit-bier. A bit sweet overall. Interesting beer, but not a favorite of mine."
"Golden yellow bubbly brew. I used a goblet syle glass to bring out the aroma of bananas and belgium yeast. The flavor was light and sweet with a bananas and spice which, for me, slowly started to become less and less tasty. Highly carbonated. Overall, this beer is just OK and would probably be best with food and not enjoyed by itself."
"I tend to like a more dramatic smell and flavor with Belgian styles, but this is not a bad beer at all."
"This beer poured out a very pale shade of yellow and developed a steady head that was smallish when compared to the standard bearer Duvel which supplied the Tulip glass. The smell was clean, sweet, and floral. The hop notes typical in the other Great Divide beers were completely absent. The was too cloyingly sweet for a beer of this style. I prefer my Belgian Pale Ales bone dry, and the yeast strain they chose seemed not up to par to do the job needed. Pepper, vanilla, and pear notes were present, but candi sugar dominated them all. Mouthfeel was medium, but lacked that necessary crisp snap. Not a good choice if one needs to start on Journey towards Belgian style beers."
"While working at Bocktown Beer and Grill this one quickly become a go to when it was on tap during it's initial release. Appears a light pale slightly clouded bright golden hue matched with an egg shell foamy white head, dwindles rather quickly with large bubbles clinging to my snifter. Dissipating head forms fine sporadic lacing with each sip. Aromatics full of spicy yet soft characteristics matching the likes of vanilla and tropical fruit with herbal chamomile tea. Definitely a highlight of malts and funky yeast notes but like other Belgian style strong golden ales it finishes with a balanced slightly grassy hop profile. Flavor full of spicy clove with vanilla creamy light toasted malts, a touch of black licorice, tropical mellow fruits, mild citrus again finishing with that chamomile herbal tea hop profile. Mouthfeel is not cloying in anyway although medium bodied carbonation is light and effervescent enough to carry this brew with ease. Drinkability is insanely and dangerously high light and complex will keep you intrigued and refreshed with that mid grade alcohol creeping on you the entire session."
"Drinkability: Not quite as good as the devil himself, this beer is still deserving of its name"
"Hades Ale is a moniker that belongs to something black and oily and grungy, like a high-ABV Russian Imperial stout aged in oak barrels. This beer is bright and sunny. It's also delicious and wonderfully drinkable. While this is far from their most impressive effort, Great Divide delivers the goods yet again."
"Recommended if it's not too expensive. A solid, easy drinking, spicy Belgian pale. Would go nicely with lighter meats and whatnot."
"D - This a pretty good American representation of a Belgian. Really, though, I'd rather have one from Belgium."
"Poured into a chimay goblet. Very light golden color, and fairly clear. Good 1""white head. Smells of citrus and spices, similar to a saison or spiced tripel. Very silky, with not too much fizz or crispness. Does not seem to bite at all like I would like. Very drinkable, but not too flavorful, almost dulls as I finish the beer."
"Overall experience: I like this better than some other American made Belgian Golden/Strong Pales. I forget what I paid but would buy it again."
"All in all, not a bad attempt by Great Divide at the style. There are better out there but you won't be too disappointed opting to spend some time with this guy."
"Anyways, not bad. All in all nothing very negative to say. I'm not blown away by this but I could certainly enjoy more."
"Clear pale yellow with evident strong carbonation and a frothy pure-white head. Pale, spicy yeast and herbal perfume aroma...lager-like in its cleanness. Fruity esters and peppery, herbal phenols. A little sweet, with a pale malty presence. Medium-light mouthfeel, well carbonated at first. I get a little burn in the throat with each swallow. Nothing I would get again since there are many better."
"Very pale, somewhat hazy yellow color-cloudy BUD? Nice aroma-somewhat grassy and sulfury with a hint of spice. Well balanced malty and spicy flavor. Lemony and quite citrusy. Decent body- very crisp and clean. Great beer all around. Most of what Great Divide does is good so chalk up another."
"Pours a hazy timid pale yellow color. Some lacing present as the big stiff white head fades. The smell is primarily Belgian yeast, lemon, spice with a doughy malt base. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied with a tangy spice. The flavor is similar to the nose with lemony notes. A reasonable drinker; had fun with it."
"D  pretty good, gives me pleasant thoughts of Duvel, nice and strong, this is from a bomber and Ill definitely be finishing and enjoying it. Would drink again"
"Pours a three finger white head that goes slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nearly clear pale amber color. Nose is very slight spice. Flavor is like a unsweet honey, smooth with a clean finish. $7.70 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"[Don't get me wrong: if I was going to die and go to beer heaven somewhere besides California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, or Alaska, it would be Belgium. I just think that Belgium gets passes without regarding to intrinsic quality from beer geeks much like many Stone, Sierra, Victory, etc., offerings do.]"
"While this isn't an all out terrible beer, it is the worst offering I have had from Great Divide. If you are interested in having a decent American interpretation of a Belgian, reach for an Allagash."
"Not too shabby all in all; reminds me of a more polite version of Golden Monkey. I'm thinking either some age or some tinkering with the recipe would serve this brew a world of good. Don't expect a world beater out of this bottle but do sit back and enjoy."
"D: This is a decent ale from Great Divide. A nice take on the style, but there are better options out there. Still, it is worth a try."
"22oz bomber poured into a large tulip glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a thin white head. The aroma is reminiscent of Belgian strong pale ales fruity notes (mainly apple and a hint of banana). The mouthfeel is light and crisp from the carbonation. The taste crisp and slightly sweet with a mildly spicy finish. I will admit this is not my favorite beer style to begin with, but I have had enough within the style to have a fairly accurate judgment. This one falls pretty close to the middle of the pack."
"Pours a vibrantly clear pale straw color. A nice poofy white head soon dissipates to a quarter inch. Sweet maltiness dominates the bouquet, strangle very reminiscent of the Samarai I had last week. Esters are muted, nothing like a true Belgian, nor like many American versions. However, some citrus spiked dried plums can be smelled; a stickly sweetness is most of what I get. On the palate, it is slightly unfocused in its profile, starting out sweet and earthy, retreating to some vague floral, noble hop flavor and finishing even sweeter. They claim it is ""extremely balanced", and while I would say it is more balanced than some, it's also very underwhelming. Of their entire lineup, this would probably be close to the last beer I would purchase from GD."
"This drank okay, this a bit all over map for my tastes"
"The smell was yeasty with a spicy aroma with a faint banana smell. The taste was yeasty with maltiness on the back end to mellow it out. It has a really pleasant aftertaste that stays with you for a long while. I will be buying this one again for sure."
"This is a decent BSPA though certainly not my favorite. Worth trying."
"Bomber bottle, notches on the label tell me this was brewed and bottled in August '07, its fresh. Pours very light and clear, under a loose white head that leaves fine and crisp lacing, that show nice irregular and stringy formations. I like nice lacing and this one shows off some mighty nice lace. Bright nose of fresh pepper, bubblegum, medicinal and as another reviewer some sharp piss notes as well. Love the style and I'm intrigued by this offering from Great Divide. Plenty of Belgian yeasty notes, more bubble gum, pepper and assorted spice. heady, tasty and thirst quenching stuff. Nice, full throttle summery beer, bring on the cheese, salads, bread, etc and enjoy. Surprised by some of the unfavorable reviews for this tasty offering"
"I could make a decent session out of this beer. It's worth a try."
"Great Divides Hades Ale pours a light golden yellow with little head that dissipates fairly quickly. The smell is fairly strong, mostly of yeast. According to the bottle its a rare Belgian yeast strain that gives a complex spice flavor and aroma. This is definitely a smooth beer with a medium to strong yeasty aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan of the yeast taste in beer, but this will be manageable to finish. Those of you who like the malt and hops flavor of beer, this one can be skipped; however, on the flipside if you like or want to try a yeasty beer, give this one a try."
"Ah, the taste is closer to the real thing. Some citrus and a good amount of wheat flavor. The swallow features stronger wheat that dissipates rapidly in the aftertaste. The beer is highly carbonated with a low body texture."
"D - Pretty good drinkability, but not good enough. The real problem here is the residual sweetness; this beer just isn't dry enough for the style (and even disregarding style it is kind of cloying in the finish). The taste is a little flat as well; but in all fairness that wouldn't have been as noticeable if the aroma wasn't so pleasant."
"Fairly thin bodied but rounds out quite nicely and feels a bit fuller than it actually is. A Moderate amount of carbonation with a very dry finish"
"Poured into a heavy glass pint, formed a 1/4"" white head over the clear light golden brew. Head dwindles rather quickly, with moderate amounts of lace. Aroma is spicy yeasts and sweet malts. Taste is combination of the nose's two attributes, and they meld quite nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth with easy drinkability. A pleasing, easily approachable brew."
"Pours a crisp pale yellow with a decent head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was of Belgian yeast and slight sweet malts. The taste was somewhat sweet and had far less hop character than I would expect from any pale, even Belgian, still somewhat enjoyable. The beer was medium bodied and rather crisp with a nice amount of carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, but not one I'd pick over a Saison or Tripel."
"This beer pours a light golden, straw color with a nice head that disappears with little lace left. Strong, typical Belgian aroma comes immediately. The same goes for the taste only with a slight American spin. Its spicy, sweet and fruity. This is a great beer from an even better brewery...I wish it appealed a little more to me though. Anyway, worth a try and I recommend it to everyone."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a small white foamy head that dissappears quickly. This sort of looks like a big time macro. The smell has a Belgian scent to it,candy sugar,lemon,clove and banana. The taste is crisp,but thin and weak. Some clove,banana,wheat,and lemon,but this is pretty disappointing. The m/f is thin and weak with the flavors not really mixing all that well. I can't believe Great Divide made this. I love Great Divide and this is easily their worst beer. Sorry Great Divide."
"A bit weak/bland for the style which bordered on a grain-based, Pale Lager. Not one I'll be returning to."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Belgian-esque, but not up to the standard of the finest Belgian Ales. Still a very tasty brew. Recommended."
"Crisp, thin mouthfeel with a dry finish. Highly carbonated. This is an overall easy drinking brew, but not what I want when looking for a BSPA."
"Until then, pick this one up once only and just for the novelty of something new from Great Divide."
"D: A wonderful Belgian. Carries every characteristic of a delicious strong pale."
"The drinkability is good as this beer has no qualities that are offensive. Likewise, there are no qualities that evoke the giddy enthusiasm that comes with a truly outstanding brew. It is light, a bit bland, but decent. No disappointment here but no overwhelming sensation either. A one night stand to be certain."
"Cheers!"
"Pours golden, with bright highlights and great clarity. Aromas are of zesty, almost salty hops and an almost phenolic, spicy yeast character. It's got an earthiness that reminds of licorice or gentian root. On the palate, there's a softy, doughy bit that runs into some white fruits and spices. Things turn just a tad sweet at the mid-palate, but remain light. The end is quite dry. Mouthfeel is excellent -- fleshy carbonation that's not too heavy, alongside some light Belgian malts. Overall, this is very good. It's not as American as many American beers of Belgian style are. Good dryness, refreshing flavor, well balanced. Definitely a winner."
"Bottle courtesy of SS: Poured a bright pale golden color ale with a huge white foamy head with perfect retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is kind of cloying and more or less enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by sweet sugary malt which is kind of gross with a weird oily texture and light yeasty finish. Average body with some good carbonation. Definitely not the best beer from this usually fine brewery and not something that I am eager to try again and almost makes me want to suggest to the brewery to stay away from Belgian Ale and keep doing the IPA/IIPA and IS."
"Not totally impressed but not let down. Im sure there are much better examples out there so I wouldnt get this one again. Nice effort by Great Divide, who is one of my favorite breweries."
"D- Decent BSPA but not my favorite. Something I will have again. This is wonderful for a filtered wheat beer. Almost all the yeast taste still lingers. This is a good one that a myriad of beer fans will enjoy."
"This beer was carbonated, partially cloudy and yellowish in color. The smell is like a hot macro, corny and rice like. The taste is slightly bannanna like and the alcohol has quite a burn. This beer is a sipper. A real ear warmer. I would possibly drink this again at some point but would not go out of my way to drink it."
"This is a sipper. It's also a one and done for me."
"It does posses a nice mouthfeel, as stated, crisp, but not overwhelming. One can drink it pretty easily, but this isn't the best beer out there. If your store carries it, there is a good chance your money is spent elsewhere (one different beers), but its not totally a waste, and if you love the style (belgian strong pale ale), I suspect you wont mind it too much."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty basic entry into the world of Belgian-Style Ales but I could not see myself not recommending it. It's flavourful and interesting enough to rule that possibility out. Give it a shot and see what you think of it."
"Overall, a mediocre outing from Great Divide. I normally enjoy their beers, but this tastes kind of like a Belgian malt liquor. It does improve some as it warms and I enjoy it more as I get through the bottle."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, GA. I'm usually a pretty big fan of Great Divide, but this beer was just not that great. Especially compared to the other Belgian and Belgian style options out there, this one didn't fly. Pours a fairly light golden, with a very nice head. Big and fluffy looking but with some decent density. So far so good. The smell isn't welcoming. There is sharp apple, wintergreen, and a slight bit of floral hops. Somewhat harsh and not that well integrated. The taste is pretty thin up front, but develops flavors of crisp red apple with peel, banana, bubblegum, and some late astringency. Gets better as it warms, but still lacks integration, balance and robustness. Could also use a little sweetness. Mouthfeel is fairly full bodied but somewhat slick. Really, why bother? Try it once and maybe again in a year to see if its any better integrated, but there are so many better options out there. I'll stick to their non Belgian stuff."
"This is a nice beer, and solid outing for a brewery that does not specialize in Belgian style ales. It becomes more appealing as it warms in the glass, so keep that in mind. And the 7.3% ABV is masked quite well. In all honesty, Great Divide beers are among my favorites, and this one is definitely worth trying. But it's not great, and I'd just as soon be drinking a proper Belgian ale in the end."
"Drinkability: I will say that when faced with the task of soothing my harried nerves after navigating my way through Atlanta traffic, the Great Divide Hades did a bang up job."
"I've loved every other GD bomber I've had. This brew is an aberration."
"I was a little worried about this since Belgian Ales don't seem to be part of Great Divide's usual repertoire. No need. This is a fine example of a strong Belgian (like Duvel). Definitely worth picking up again."
"good drinkability, and in the context of a summer release, excellent for a warm day. something it might be nice to grab sixer of rather than a bomber, but a little high on the booze side of things to drink too many of, so maybe the bomber works better."
"This beer is for real. Pale golden in color with a little lacing. The aroma is immediately reminiscent of of Duvel or a wit with a kick for the spice. The flavor is deep. Its starts sweet and bready, then bitterness grows while coriander, vanilla, and cream come through with a touch of belgian candi. The aftertaste is a long continuation of the spice and sweet malts. Oh so drinkable. My only negative comments are that this beer lacks the mouthfeel (a touch weak on the carbonation) and rocky head that help round out a great pale Belgian. Still damn tasty. Find this beer."
"This is a nice beer from Great Divide, but I have to confess I was expecting a bit more flavor-wise. Oh well..."
"Drinkability is for me not that great can't get over the harsh start to this one."
"Saw this one in the store for the first time today, so I was quick to see what it was. Poured into an over sized wine glass a golden straw color, with a small white ring head. In the nose was dry champaign, grains, and a very faint fruit presence. Taste held pretty much the same characters found in the smell, save for a slight white wine taste in the beginning. Mouthfeel was light bodied. Certainly seems to be a very balanced beer as well. One bomber of this will be plenty for me. I found this beer to be a little bit on the boring side."
"Great Divide is a favorite brewer of mine and this beer holds its own against the Belgian examples. I miss the giant foamy head, but it's nice not having to pour so carefully, too!"
"Aroma was balanced with some citrus, a bit of pine, biscuit, sweet malt. Taste follows aroma. A nice balance between the malt and hops, the yeast richness faded after initial sip. This is a good one for the summer sitting on the porch."
"On tap at Falling Rock during their 10th Anniversary week. Crystal clear, bright and pale yellow with a creamy white dense head that falls away shortly. Excellent carbonation helps sustain a thin, lingering head, though. Nice lace. Aroma is of smooth esters and a hint of yeast. Tastes slightly fruity with a low hop flavor that blends well with the overall profile. Somewhat sweet, but not overly so. Feels creamier than it should for a dry beer- I'd have to credit the CO2 level for perceived body. This isn't a session beer, but it sure drinks like one."
"This was described as a Belgian golden ale to me by the bartender in the tap room at Great Divide.The color was clear yellow and the brew had a very small head that fades away pretty quick. I thought the carbonation lent to a nice mouthfeel. The smell was slightly yeasty, and banana-like. The taste was spicy and like bubblegum. I kept trying to think of which gum it reminded me of. This was a pretty good ale."
