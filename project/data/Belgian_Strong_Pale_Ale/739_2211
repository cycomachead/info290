Belgian yeast seems out of place for the flavor profile too, this is all over the place. the 2013 vintage had a decent mouthfeel, bubbly and cleaner than the messy taste, but the 2010 had lost its vigorous carbonation and came across particularly thin as a result. I didn't really care for either one, as they lacked that winter warming property that I love about holiday beer. I would pass this up if I encounter is again.","StonedTrippin","Dec 08, 2013"

Just a nice spicy Belgian ale, big black and white pepper notes, along with a wallop of grassy hops. A hint of liquorice adds some intrigue but isn't obvious or overwhelming. Very dry and digestible. A snappy, almost chalky, hop bitterness lingers on the finish. This doesn't scream of the holiday season, but certainly screams of a quality, enjoyable Belgian ale. De Ranke makes good beer, I wish we got more of their range around these parts.","bump8628","Nov 18, 2013"

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head retreats. The beer smells of barley malt with some nice fruity notes. I get lemon and banana as well as some clove and pepper spiciness. I'm also picking up some grassiness as well. The grassy hop notes provide a nice flavor for this beer as well as back end bitterness. I get the spice from the nose, but more of those pepper notes than the clove notes, but the clove notes do come out more in later sips. I also get plenty of that bready malt after the first sip. I don't notice the 7% ABV at all. The flavors are nicely balanced. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and there's a lingering aftertaste of hops from this beer. While the alcohol isn't present in the flavor, it brings a nice warming feel after a few sips. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Mar 20, 2013"

Aromas of straw, crackers, light peachy stone fruit, and a bit of pepper all show up, with any one of the above seeming to be dominant each time I take it in. The flavor profile just doesn't have the depth of vibrancy that was found in the nose. There's a good amount of cracker malt sweetness up front, and a fair bit of freshly cracked black pepper in the finish. Unfortunately, there's not much else. What's present is nice, I just found myself wanting a little bit more. The mouthfeel is just OK. The body is a touch chewy, and the carbonation is decidedly muted for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Aside from the aromatics, De Ranke's Pere Noel is a fairly ho-hum BSPA.","axeman9182","Beers"

The flavor, though, is strong and good. Great balance between initial sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness. Some peppery spice qualities and a nice dollop of yeast. Good.

It seems pretty drinkable if you enjoy this Belgian IPA idea. This is a bit grassy which detracts for me but it's a nice blend with some subtle ideas floating around including some banana and corriander but it's mostly a polite but edgey Belgian hop brew and I have no idea why this is billed as a Christmas brew.

It was fairly drinkable for the strength, but it was also complex enough to leave me satisfied to slowly sip. This is one of the better Belgians I've had lately and completely worth checking out.

4.65,22.4,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750ml bottled in September of '08. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a huge, rocky, off-white head that lasts. A bit of sediment. The rush of floral hops aromas is fantastic. Grassy and grainy with some citrus and other light fruit, as well as a bit of must. Really complex. The taste is equally nice, with all of the hop presence suggested by the nose and then some. The perfect amount of bitterness is countered by nice, slightly roasty, earthy malt. Interesting mineral yeast notes. Dark fruits. Medium-full body. Another exceptional beer from De Ranke.","philipquarles","Apr 05, 2009"

It poured a lighter caramel color with an off white head that's dense and frizzy with very good lace. The nose is woody, clovish and pale...enticing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slightly acidic grit to it. The flavors are many; appley and cask-like up front with lingering clove spiciness, all tied neatly with a citrus hop character that is hardly subdued. The finish is peppery, with hints of oaken wood and a dryness that is there, but not overwhelming. This is a wonderfully complex beer that would be well served to lay down for a year.

4.2,10.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Best before september 2008 so about 1.5 years of aging. Pours in perfectly clear with good head and a nice bronze colour. Smell is delightingly fruity, mostly yeast but still litle hops there. Most of the nose though is very creamy orange & peach. First sip makes you notice the used hops in high amounts and still present. 2 nd sip made me get the nice and fruity arome that reminds me of good tripel. After that I found also litle malt and hops& hops. Great brew, also to lay down for a bit.","paterlodie","Jan 06, 2005"

The nose is sweet fruity strawberry and caramel with a nice peppery background. The flavor is great. Wonderful sweet caramel balanced with a spicey pepper and a great spicey hop on the finish that sits on my tongue. Good good beer. The feel was moderatly thick and velvety smooth. Drinkability is awesome. So easy drinking, sweet and balanced. I really liked it a lot.","kmpitz2","Dec 13, 2004"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this at the Moan and Dove's 2nd Birthday party. What a fun time. Pours with a fairly big head, nice and puffy. Clearish light amber color. Soft looking. Smells a bit funky. Definate wheat presence, with a tad of dirt in there, also with a nice malt backbone and a floral hop profile. Tastes almost watery, but not in an bad way. It kind of tastes like a beer with a shot of wheat grass thrown in. Very musty and yeasty indeed. Sweet malt notes here and there, with a bitter dry hop finish for the mouthfeel. Drinkable yes, but you probably want to take your time with this one I'd say, as it's pretty complex.","twelvsies","Dec 05, 2004"

3.75,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This bottle seem to contain quite a bit of foam just waiting to flow out the top one the cork was out. It formed a very murky light amber color with a bubbly white head that dispated quickly considering all the foam that flowed out of the bottle. The aroma was of yeast, hops and some spices. The flavor was of citrus, spices, hops and some bread/dough aspects. The body was fairly light and the finish was complicated, with aspects of spices with a small bit of astrigency.","Wildman","Jul 26, 2004"

4.53,19.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml, wrapped in paper without a label on the bottle. The first pour from a long-standing 750ml bottle is surprisingly clear, and its amber body displays orange and gold highlights beneath a magnificent pillow of soft and creamy white foam. The second glass becomes murky with the lees, but the brilliant head remains and it holds exceptionally well, leaving some very nice rings of lace about the goblet. The nose is fresh, exciting, and enticing with a combination of lightly fruity, earthy, and mildly musty yeast; delicately sweet malt; and bright, grassy hops. In the mouth it's very fine-bubbled carbonation is not as effervescent as might be expected, but rather median; and it's medium body combines with it to leave it just lightly tingly and then velvety smooth across the palate. The flavor is not overwhelming... to the contrary, it slowly draws you in, bit by bit. Some light, juicy and subtly tart fruit appears up-front, immediately backed by a soft, delicately candyish malt that wraps it like a blanket as a pillow of grassy, lightly floral, and somewhat spicy hops appear. Or are they spicy? Bolder peppery notes appear almost at the same moment. And a flick of alcohol is present as well; so is the peppery spiciness coming from the alcohol, spices, hops or a combination of all three? Who knows? Who cares? It finishes dry with some lingering pepper and a combination of citrusy and dried-apricot-like fruitiness that leaves you only partially satiated and wanting more. Raspy, pine-like notes and a bolder bitterness develop at the back of the throat as you progress through the glass, almost begging you to go back to the supple, juciy and citrusy fruit found at the start. Wow! What an enticing beer! It's certainly not what one might expect of a holiday ale (think bolder & spicier), as it's so much more the seductress. Refined... elegant... regal, perhaps. A brilliant pale ale that should be available year-round, and welcome on the dinner table at any time. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Feb 22, 2004"
3.6,-5.3,3,3,4,4,3.5,"Overall Impression: I guess I'm just not sure what makes a Christmas beer a Christmas beer.

4.5,18.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A creamy peach-like orange-ish hue with a lovely creamy head of off-white bubbles. The aromas are of melon, different fruits, spicy alcohol, yeast, belgian candi sugar, and fresh floral, just cut hops! The flavor is very similar to the aromas and follows thorugh wonderfully. As Loren said, this stuff is a hop heads version of Duvel, that is definately a good way to sum this beer up. It tastes of candy coated hops, honey, different spices and flowers, belgian candy sugar, and yeast. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and light on the tongue and the drinkability is excellent as well.

4.1,7.9,4,4,4.5,3,4,"size, creamy in consistency and the color an off white with the lace a silk like curtain to cover the glass. Fruit laden nose, to me an over ripe peach, also somewhat musk like or musty like an old wine cellar, not bad mind you just quite different some malt tones at the back with the start sweet, nicely malted, tart and somewhat vinous, top is light but rich in feel. Meekly carbonated finish, bitter, hops understated, alum dry aftertaste, different from what I would normally drink, so it takes a lot of contemplation to be accurate in my judgment, drinkable, but something I'd not want to sample on a regular basis, but after some serious decanting I found it to be a bit more pleasing to my palate, so if your not into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle, even if it means pouring a bit of the beer back into the bottle you may make a serious misjudgment of taste.","Gusler","Dec 16, 2003"

Very clean aroma, I didn't pick up much action. I found this to be pretty darn smooth, and even though I knew it had some punch, alcohol wise, I really couldn't tell when drinking it. Definitely some candi sweetness in the finish. While good, and definitely well blended, there wasn't so much going on with this one. Might be a good choice for a novice, no off notes detected with this one. pat","PatandDavid","Dec 04, 2003"

4.5,18.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance: Amber orange cloudy with an effervescent bubbly carbonation, this one was done in small batches reminscient of some hard to find farmhouse ales lacing is excellent fine Belgian webbed patterns. Aroma: A bouquet of floral Hallertau blended with a piney honey tinged tone with a streak of spicing to bring holiday cheers. Taste: I absolutely fell in love with this Belgian rarity, possibly up there on my all time favorite Belgian ales as well as Christmas beers I've tasted. Fruity tones accented and surrounded by the rush of pine cone like hops, so excellent this kind of hopping with the lucious malt backbone this is the Ruination of Belgian bier just a step below Properings Hommel in my opinion. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a champagne like carbonation this one is hard to beat. Drinkability: My lord I indulged in this beer at the Sharp Edge on a Thursday by Saturday this beer was sold out there they moved two cases like nothing. Found it at D's Sixpack and picked up their last two bottles just excellent for a dinner brew or just if chilling around and the snow's coming down crack one of these babies it will put a smile on your face.","WVbeergeek","Dec 01, 2003"
4.6,21.1,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Pours a magnificent cloudy burnt sienna-orange color with a fluffy off white head. Strange aroma, can discern some hops and a bit of peppermint, malt and possibly some other spices, but subdued. Taste is most unique, unlike anything else I've tried. I recommend that if you find a bottle, buy it; can't miss the pale green wrapper on it. Mouthfeel is most excellent, effervescent and crisp. A lingering astringent aftertaste of lightly zesty hops and dull peppermint leaves. Totally unique for a Christmas beer. Floored by it.","crookedhalo","Nov 23, 2003"
4.7,23.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Man this is good!! Awesome deep honeyed/tan color with plenty of mouthwatering sticky beige head to welcome one, and very adequate lace that leaves a patch of web throughout. On the nose malty sweetness meets beeswax scented hop. The smell of the candy sugar is also evident, as is a very inviting while subtle fruitiness. In the mouth the beer hits all the buds! sweetness can be found on the roof of the mouth, while bitter teases the tip of the tongue and literally attacks the sides of the tongue. This is a great strong pale ale, and reminds me of a saison on roids! This is a big, hoppy brew that is oh so refreshing and clean! The finish with its bitter hop, and grapefruit zest like burn goes on, and on, and on! This is one of my favorite winter seasonals this year no question.

Fruity tartness dominates the smell, but the hops are more pronounced than they are in most Belgians. Granny Smith apples and grapefruit flavors make for a nice slightly mouth-puckering taste. Alcohol smell and taste did seem fairly pronounced for a 7% abv beer.","mickeymac","Aug 27, 2003"

4.35,14.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002 edition: Paper-wrapped bottle pours a beer which is clear bronze in color, topped by a medium-thick white head which quickly settles. Aroma is mild in its maltiness and hops, though accented by a lightly tart fruitiness  green apple, perhaps, or hints of grape. The flavor is led by a full, toffee-like maltiness, which yields gently to a floral, spicy dry finish. The aftertaste is of brown sugar. A really surprising beer for me, and a nice example of a Belgian Holiday ale!","mzwolinski","Beers"
4.62,21.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Turbid looking brown tone with orange highlights. A nice beige head recedes to a thin fillm that sticks around nicely. Lace is clingy and sporadic. Nose is perfumey, floral and spicy alltogether. Also fruity and orange-like. Even a little candyish. Very nice. The palate tells my this is one tasty beverage. Nice hop traits: dryness, hebalness, a recognizable, but understated bitterness, spiciness. Pretty cool. Some bready yeast undertones. Orange comes into play midway through. Some slight grainy malt tones surface every now and then. Slight musty/farmyard character adds even more depth to this complex brew. A light-medium body with just the right amount of spritzy carbonation makes this one drinkable (and enjoyable) beer.","Bighuge","0"
