I was at a fantastic bar and was interested in the local brews and choose the Ozzy based solely on the type of beer it was. My expectations were normal, for a beer enthusiast that is. It was poured for me out of a can.  I was surprised by how good it was! Since then, I made a trip to Brewer's Art in Baltimore and enjoyed the beer again on tap in their marvelous cellar atmosphere. It felt very right. The beer is exquisite. Even now that Ozzy has been rebranded as Beazly, the look, smell, taste, feel and might I mention nostalgia remain the same. It is a great belgian style pale ale and always a refreshing delight to enjoy. I highly recommend. Do not be turned off by its container - a can is more environmentally sound, protects it better from UV, and when poured into a glass does not take away from the experience. Overall: it is a fantastic beer.","jdbeertime","Jan 23, 2015"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall (4/5): Beazly/Ozzy is a very good, easy-drinking Belgian-style pale ale that works in quite a bit of complexity. I particularly like how it goes from fruity to slightly bitter/grassy to earthy and dry in the finish. Good transition of flavors. I do wish that this beer was slightly more carbonated. After it sits in the glass for a while (we're talking 45 mins.), it tastes flat and still. This can EASILY be remedied, so I'm hoping the good folks at Brewer's Art do so.","hagbergl","Aug 09, 2014"

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp and lively feel to the carbonation that pops in the mouth. There is a little alcohol here. I’ve always thought that Ozzy was a decent beer but I’m happy to see that you can now enjoy it in a 12oz portion instead of having to commit to a 750ml bottle.

I had a solid finger of rocky bone-white head that boiled and bubbled like any good witch's brew and slowly fell, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and suddenly King Midas and Croesus were wrestling with me, not over the beer, but over our new favorite Nebraska native, Val MidWest! Nose was spicy, but not from adjuncts, but undoubtedly from the yeast, which also imparted a pleasant mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was a CANglomeration between JuicyFruit and Big Red gum. It was mixed fruity, but also hot and spicy! Jeez-O, man, I may need a lay-down after this one. The lacing that had begun to appear was going to require a jackhammer to remove and I just returned my rental the other day. My mind is starting to smooth out and this is not helping!

Had a decent aroma of yeastiness, touch of orange and citric and bitter hops, tad bit of fruit and some sweet sugary malts. Easy to drink, has a mix of sweet and tart fruit as well as some spiceiness for a little kick. A bit on the plush, juicy side with a filling mouth, can't really pinpoint the fruits other than something like apple/pear and a touch of tropical as well. Some sweet malt as well but ultimately finishes dry with a crisp kick and is an excellent beer to relax with on a terribly hot summer day.","clayrock81","Jul 08, 2012"

Well balanced with a good bit of earthy, tart flavor countered by zesty spice, light fruit, sweet alcohol and dry champagne yeast effervescence. Hints of pepper and clove as well as some apple, pear, grass, straw and alcohol. Similar to Duvel but not quite as good with a fuller body, stronger hop presence and less alcohol bite.

4.29,6.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a pale golden color, nice and clear, lots of bubbles, bubbles rising up through the beer from the pour to the last sip. Nice looking. The final pour yields a little haze (I split this one into a couple pours). A nice looking beer. The smell is great. Powdery milled grains, a little spice and grassiness. Lemongrass and herbs are strong, very leafy. But also the pale grains are nice, crackery, a little bready. The taste is good. A very nice malty sweetness hits the tongue first, along with a pleasant fruity flavor and some peppery yeast. Then you start to get this spicy, herbal leafiness. As it warms, the herbal flavors start to come alive more, and mix in well with the dry crackery flavors. The yeast character is also very nice, provides excellent dryness, almost a little chalky/powdery, with a nice spice. The body is a nice medium thin, with a good bite of carbonation - it bites as you swallow a bit. The alcohol sort of slowly gets to you (I'm glad I shared a bit with my roomate), but I really really enjoyed this. A very nice take on a belgian style beer brewed stateside and a nice beer that I would've never tried otherwise. Thanks Paul.","taylorhamrick","May 19, 2010"

Tastes a bit like a Saison- certainly far more than it tastes like a Belgian Strong Pale, but with a lot of graininess thrown into the mix that distracts somewhat from other flavors and muddies the taste a bit. Not as sweet as a Tripel, but sweeter than most Belgian pales.

If you want to enjoy the beer the best, I would suggest letting it settle considerably in the glass (which might also warm it slightly, which mutes the sourness and brings forward the pilsner-like malt character).","Seanibus","Sep 15, 2008"

They certainly deserve it. This is a fantastic take on a Duvel inspired beer; fruity and spicier than Duvel, the added character definitely works wonderfully, especially considering that this is a bit sweeter than Duvel, that added flavors definitely help to tame the sweetness quite well.","Gueuzedude","Aug 31, 2008"

3.58,-10.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I wasn't too impressed and the high ABV might make this a one-a-night kind of beer. This was my least favorite of the Brewer's Art beers; that having been said, I still think I'd drink it agian.","sinistrsam","Oct 10, 2007"

3.81,-5.2,2.5,4,4.5,2,3.5,"D - Considering that this tastes more like a mild picante salsa than a beer, this is pretty good. It is definitely unique. I would imagine there are a lot of foods with which this would go well (tortilla chips stands out in my mind). Sessioning would be difficult, but not unimaginable. This is one worth seeking out.","mrasskicktastic","Aug 17, 2006"

3.76,-6.5,4,3,4,4,4,"Tried this beer before Orioles-Red Sox game at a local Baltimore bar. Appearance is of most other belgian strong pales, golden with a little haziness and a small white, foamy head. Aroma is nice and malty, with a hint of fruit and some peppery spices. The taste is of citrus fruit with a nice bitter hop aftertaste lingering. Not too powerful or complex. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is high, nothing too special about this beer but a good local brew for sure","nickg902","Jun 14, 2006"
3.97,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On tap at UJ's on the Manatawny. Nice to see a Brewers Art beer in the Philadelphia area as they don't come around that often. The beer poured a light golden color with a medium thickness white head that lasted for a bit. The aroma of the Ozzy was a nice malty / sweet smelling bouquet with a bit of hop bitterness to the nose. The taste is a nice malty, bready taste with some sweetness and a good touch of hop bitterness at the end. With a medium body, I found this beer to be rather drinkable.","ggaughan","Mar 19, 2006"
4.18,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pale gold in color with a wisp of white head. The nose of grainy malts and peppary spiciness come through rather good in the flavor as well. Sweet, citrusy, and dry finishing, this is just an all around good pounder. Finished one or four while watching the Yankees recently lose in the postseason. The best of both worlds.","Dithyramb","Oct 10, 2005"

3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this on tap in the Brewer's Art. Pours a liight gold with a thin finger of head and pretty good retention. Nose is a grainy malt with a slight bit of pepper. Taste is a pretty rich malty bread, with just a slight bit of sugary sweetness and a citrussy hop finish which is strong for the style. Medium bodied this beer has a really dry finish. This is dangerously drinkable for its alcohol content and goes great with the garlic fries.","cubedbee","Aug 15, 2005"
3.85,-4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A very clear pale yellow with a decent head, this gives off the expected sweet lemon and spice/pepper aromas with some hints of cracked, dried coriander and light malt. Similar flavors with a bit of a rind-like bitter twist on the end, which threw me for a bit of a loop. Not nearly enough body; this really did taste and feel just a bit watered down. Perhaps it's a bit too filtered? I didn't notice any haze at all.","marburg","Dec 28, 2004"
4.15,3.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is very good. Smooth and lush on the palate with nice transitions between grain, pale malts and the citrusy hops.","CRJMellor","Nov 03, 2004"
4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is one of the better beers at Brewers Art. Unlike many Belgians, I find this one if very well balanced and definitely has some noticeable hop character. Of course the malts take precedence but do not to over the top. It is extremely drinkable and care must be taken since it is a bit stronger than the usual beer.","cracker","Oct 21, 2004"

3.36,-16.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"From the tap at the Grey Lodge, this beer poured a clean and clear gold color. A thinning white head topped off this brew. Low carbonation. From this beer emits a strange egg like aroma, or it can maybe be described as a Sanford felt tip marker. The taste is light fruity and has a spicy, almost peppery hop bite. Lemon cough drop notes come out. Medium malt bodied beer and finishes sharp and clean with a light and peppery dryness and a dry spicy hop sting. This is an enjoyable beer that has a distinctiveness about it.","pezoids","Mar 20, 2004"

3.92,-2.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer was gold in color with a very thin head. The aroma was nice with some floral, citrus, and other sweet notes. The taste was as expected, malty and yeasty with some bitterness. The mouthfeel was thinner than expected. Very drinkable and satisfying. Overall I thought this was a mellow version of Duvel.","Gavage","Oct 04, 2003"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A clear yellow-gold body displays streams of very tiny bubbles rising steadily beneath a bright-white head of creamy foam. The retention is decent, and although it eventually drops to a thin but creamy collar, it does leave some very nice lace about the glass. The nose offers a distinct apple/pear fruit note amidst sweetish malt, slightly citrusy & floral hops, and a gentle spiciness (coriander?). The body is medium-light; and it's crisp in the mouth with a very fine carbonation that tickles the tongue. In the flavor, all of the elements found in the nose are carried over. It starts crisp and fruity (some light cherry?) on the front of the tongue with a low-key, fruit-like tartness; develops some malty sweetness and delicate spicy character as it crosses the palate; and finishes with a firm bitterness, a drying wash of alcohol, some low-key hop flavor, and a touch of residual fruity malt. Very well-balanced with a restrained spiciness! Flavorful, smooth yet crisp, and deceptively drinkable! Impressive!","NeroFiddled","Jul 15, 2003"
4.5,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass an amber color that had yellow/red hues to it when held up to the light, that was fairly clear. It produced a creamy white head that lasted fairly well to mid glass then formed a small film and ring on the sides of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of fruits, sweet malt, caramel, spices and floral hops. Nice balance to the aroma, each aroma seemed to be well pronounced. The tastes were full of flavor, good fruits (apples, oranges, pears), some spices (clove), rich malts, floral hops, citrus, alcohol, and some yeast. The aftertaste was rich in malt and fruit. It was medium bodied and big flavored. All flavors seemed to be very well pronounced and blended very well. A smooth drink, and somewhat sneaky because the flavors disguise the alcohol very well. A really good beer from this brewery.","Jarod","Jun 17, 2003"
