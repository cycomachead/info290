It evokes the kind of foam one sees on the seashore. The nose is honey infused herbs with some light fruit and traces of bread. Light honey, peach, citrus, light grain and biscuit flavors roll over the tongue with a trace of funk, culminating in a slightly sweet finish moderated by a moderately bitter accent.  It has very fine soft carbonation that produces a delightfully airy texture. It has a medium body and it very refreshing. Dupont uses those damn green bottles for this - I would give it 100 but every fourth or fifth bottle is skunky.","pat61","Jan 30, 2015"

Pours a clear gold with lots of fine sediment in suspension, thick head of dense white foam, thick cap remains, thick sheet down the glass. Smell: floral, lightly biscuity, orange marmalade, coriander, clove, and soft banana-ish note. Taste: grassy with a note of coriander, pear and apricot, sugary and lightly biscuity; more coming out towards the end of the sip... notes of coconut, banana, canned mandarin orange, candied lemon finish.

This beer is no exception. Wads of nutmeg, yeast, cherries, butter (salted? unsalted? I can't decide... not that I even know the difference) and cloves burst quietly from the meringue-like head. The golden color and the happy trail of bubbles that float from the foot of my glass make me wish I was a half-inch tall so I could swim in this beer. Nutmeg leads the flavor derby here, followed by a nice right-out-of-the-oven white bread and a light dressing of barnyard funk. Dull-edged hops make an entrance at the very end, but not enough to offend. Not something to slam next to the pool, but rather to sip while reading the NY Times with one's spouse on a warm, late-summer evening in Provincetown.","gfreed","Aug 29, 2010"

My first pour from a 330ml bottle was slow and deliberate and left vitrually zero head, the second bottle I aggressively poured and got the small head but also all the yeast. Either way I was not impressed. Much more impressive in the aroma and flavor departments. I get a nice spicey aroma of cloves, pepper, and other yeasty smells. The flavor follows the aroma with the same charactoristics excecpt with the addition of some yeast esters that add some sweetness and fruit flavors. No sign of alcohol in either aroma or flavor. Medium body and a spritely carbonation. The bubbles added a needed lift and life. A good beer but when it is compared to the granddaddy of BSPAs, Duvel. I would take Duvel every time.

Not much else I drank could keep up with it. Big spicy vanilla, toasted bread rolls with citrus zest and biting hops - lots going on. And compared to other Beglians, like the Long Strange Tripel from Boulevard (which is also a great beer) I had afterward, the flavors are very rich.

Immediately I noticed big floaters and a lot of sediment that poured from the bottle -- there's no mistaking that this is bottle conditioned. It is a beautiful tangerine color that lets plenty of light through, with a head that poured large but receded quickly. Lots of really pretty lacing. Nose was grass, phenols, pears.

Great citrus smell, with oranges, apricots, and a woody background. Wonderfully smooth, malty flavor. The fruit puts in just enough appearance to sex the place up. It has a peppery spice that balances it all out and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is perfect carbonation and then a silky, buttery texture underneath. Drinkability is wonderful.

Pulled out the cork and sure enough it said ""2005", so that's pretty good. Pours a nice bright yellow orange with a massive, almost overflowing white head. Head sticks around indefinitely as bubbles continually rise in an energetic fashion. Aroma is tough to pin down. Definitely Belgian, with obvious fruity ethanol on a nice clean malt base. Hint of an earthy yeast and some kind of fruit, like peaches or nectarines. Flavor is fairly strong, with up front ethanol and other alcohol notes. Spicy light malt with what tastes like a bit of wheat malt int here too, though i could be mistaken about that. Nice spicy to grassy hop notes too, somehow having survived the time in the bottle.

It was pretty watery thin and really one dimensional in that earthiness, only the slightest amount of fruity esters which I think it needed more of.

A slight haze appears in the beer, especially as the bottle is carefully emptied, as a result of the bottle conditioning. Belgian lacing lines the glassware in thick sheets. The nose is a wonderful combination of raw, funky and spicy notes you'd expect from a world class saison combined with the sweet and fruity notes of a Belgian pale ale. Enchanting peppery notes play off of the tell-tale Belgian yeast in a masterful way. The palate is terrifically spicy and packs a terrific hop smack right up front so you don't confuse this beer with a typical Belgian Pale or Golden ale. Behind the spice, a bouquet of fruity flavors fill the mouth - citrus (lemon) and some papaya are predominant. There is just enough yeasty funkiness here to remind one of Dupont's famous saison. A terrific ""hybrid"" of two of my favorite styles - I'm really enjoying this one. Incredibly balanced, the aggressive hops and active carbonation assure that this beer is not too heavy on the palate and surprisingly effervescent for the 8.5% ABV. The alcohol strength is very well hidden making this one dangerously drinkable. Smooth finish and incredibly complex, this is a ""bigger"" version of Dupont's excellent saison in many ways - the spicy, funky character is there but so is the rick, sweet maltiness of a fine Belgian strong pale ... I love it.","beerphilosopher","May 21, 2008"

In the sun, the beer absolutely shimmers with golden highlights, with no sediment to be seen. Floral nosefeel is spot-on for style, if slightly thin overall. Flowery and stemlike smells waft from the goblet, warming to become more rustic and raw, as of straw bales and wet hair. The flavors are anything but delicate, though: the bitterness is almost shocking, even for the style; fierce green peppercorn and thyme drying out over a mineral/limestone base. Still, there is a ricey malt character to be found in here somewhere. Mouthfeel is strangely sudsy considering the lack of visible carbonation. The biting bitterness lasts for ages in the aftertaste and sort of impedes the drinkability. My tastebuds are getting blasted... this is no table beer.

Big, broad, aerated chunks of dry biscuit flavors are seasoned with roasted yellow resins and a fleeting, white-fleshed fruitiness.

It first hits with a dry sweetness and some sharp sour citrus notes of lemon, maybe ginger. These quickly back off as the spiciness shows.

My tongue picks up a certain lemony acidity that makes this beer quite refreshing. There is a nice fruity yeast character, and some simple straight-forward malted grain notes.

The smell is nicely fruity, most noticeably apricot. Just a bit of bitterness balances the dry fruitiness. The taste of Belgian yeast is comforting, especially near the end of the bottle. The mouthfeel is nice, and it goes down well for an 8.5% beer.","mickeymac","Jun 13, 2004"
4.02,-4.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Very creamy head on a nice hazy orange color body with some glittering reflects. The smell is nice, yeasty, highly citric, with some peaches, maybe some anice cookies. Grassy apple juice and figs. The taste is sweet and strong apple cider, with hints of sourness. Alcohol is fairly noticeable. Very full and round mouthfeel. Strong and enjoyable.","tjd25","Jun 11, 2004"

4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"After pouring carefully, take a few minutes to bask in the gorgeous golden glow of this glorious beer. The thick head gradually dissipates leaving a permanent film over the hazy beer and lovingly laces the glass. The room fills with a fresh, floral aroma. The first taste is so... complex. Malts, hops, and spices all distinct yet experienced simultaneously. Alcohol is present, but welcome. This beer pairs well with patience. Be sure to drink with enough time to truly appreciate all this wonderful brew has to offer.","Varkias41","May 06, 2004"
4.03,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"11.2oz bottle with rust around the crown but when I pop the cap let's out a big gasp of carbonation, so I think it was sealed properly. Either way got the bottle on the discount shelf at D's sixpack for 1.99 not bad, eh? Appearance: Huge four fingers worth of white froth bubbly white head leaves fine evenly patterend Belgian style lace, the body glows a golden amber blonde tone very nice. Aroma: Tart apples grassy semi sweet notes mild alcohol phenols some slight funky musty notes and seems cidery in nature. Taste: This is the questionable aspect big musty horse blanket notes sediment layers lie in the bottom of the glass tart apple notes funky yeast pale sweet malt tone hoppy finish for a Belgian not bad. Mouthfeel: Medium body fine bubbly champagne like carbonation. Drinkability: I could definitely partake in this brew again preferrably a bigger bottle, oh yeah.","WVbeergeek","Apr 15, 2004"
3.51,-16.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Head is huge and even, but with a very uneven, slow collapse. The beer is almost clear, gold, with an orange tinge and a dark yeast pour. Lacing is sticky, but not copious. Wow... some major schpoonck on the cork pop. Citrus, spice and some sugar. Bananas in the front with alcohol and spice. Foamy, smooth mouth in the sweetish, fruity middle. A little butter. Finishes nice and bitter, dry wine-like, alcohol and tangy fruit. This seems to be apples as I reflect. There's a very bitter/sour aftertaste that's almost overwhelming, and certainly distracting. The alcohol is not all that well hidden, though it tames with temperature.","kbub6f","Apr 11, 2004"
4.35,3.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I tried this the other day at my friend Dave's house from a fresh 750ml green glass bottle. I had loved the Moinette Rouge/Bruin that we had on tap at the Bier Circus in Brussels, so I thought that this would be good too...and it is. A slightly cloudy golden brew with a nice cap of white foam that lasts and provides excellent lacing. The aromas are of spicy (slightly skunked) herbal/medicinal hops, belgian candy sugar, yeast, and some nice light biscuit-like malts. The taste is suprisingly hoppy for a Belgian, with the interesting herbal/medicinal hopping running the show. The middle reveals the nice biscuity malt flavors, and in the finish, the hops reappear. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and full-bodied and the drinkability is very good for a stronger beer (8.5%abv). Recommended!","francisweizen","Apr 05, 2004"
4.17,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden peachy hue with a big off white head. Spicy green apple aroma mixed withe the barnyard funk you'd expect from a unfiltered Farmhouse-style. Sweet initially on the palate moving towards a drier, fruitier finish at the end. A bit peppery and spritzy the whole way troughout the experience. Very good stuff.","crookedhalo","Mar 10, 2004"
4.7,12.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: An exceptionally good Pale Ale that has many of the better traits from the other artisanal Dupont beers, most notably the Saison. Highly Impressive, this one should be sought out!","TheLongBeachBum","Mar 08, 2004"
3.78,-9.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a light clear golden color with a MASSIVE head. This bottle was a gusher for some reason. I warmed this bottle up for a bit and when I popped the top, it just came out non-stop for nearly a minute. Still after it calmed down and I poured it, the head was unbelievable. The aroma consists of a strong sweet yeasty smell with fruit, spices, and hops in the mix as well. The head is still there and has barely dissipated. The taste starts with a light yeast, very pronounced spicing that is rises above all the other characteristics, somewhere in there is some fruitiness and tapers into a warming alcohol. This is a light to medium bodied beer that finishes slightly sweet and again very spicy. I have mixed feelings about this beer as I feel the spicing is a bit over-the-top, but I can't help but be attracted to it. Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","Mar 03, 2004"
4.1,-2.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very similar to the Saison yet more golden than glowing orange in color-lots of yeast bits about. Super rocky in the head dept.-like the Saison, and the head stays throughout the journey as does a nice clumpy stick. Very hoppy, in a spicy, citrusy way both in the aroma and flavor. Snappy and somewhat peppery, this beer is highly refreshing and very drinkable. All this while the beer exhibits a definate sweet malt component that is hidden way in the backgroud, just as the abv is hidden. I think of this as a Saison at Mach speed.","moulefrite","Feb 10, 2004"
3.5,-16.5,4,4,3,4,3.5,"Better balanced than some other Saisons I have tried. Still not my cup of beer. Too much bite and not enough charcter to back it up.","SeanChouffe","Jan 31, 2004"

4.58,9.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Blonde-orange color with a meringue-like head that imparts huge rings of lace down the glass. Truly a sight to behold. Nose is spicy and herbal with notes of earthy hops, pear and green apples. A melon aroma even appears as the brew warms. Taste is a magnificent melding of herbal earthiness, ripe pear, vaguely tart apple, honey, and a minor hop twang on the finish. Full-bodied and palate-coating, the mouthfeel is effervescent yet subdued. Truly artisanal as the 8.5% abv is never really an issue. Drinks incredibly easily. Certainly one of Dupont's top offerings.","Jon","Aug 31, 2003"
4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass banana colored and it had a slight cloud/haze to it and when held to the light, carbonation was present. The head that was produced was white in color and had good retention (about half glass) then fell to a film and a ring on the sides of the glass. It had the consistency of thick dense foam. With this pillow of foam sitting on the top it produced a delicate lace that stretched down the glass. The aromas that I nosed were of lots of spices (pepper, cilantro, clove), hops, fruit, and malt. Complex nose from this beer. The flavors that I tasted were of rich malt, fruit (green apple, pear), lots of spices and herbs, floral hops, some yeasty notes, and a hint of alcohol as it warmed. Finished alittle dry, alittle sweet, alittle bitter (all through the tasting), and very satisfying. Medium bodied. Great complexity and combination of flavors and smells. A real good beer and glad I had the opportunity to try. Will search out again.","Jarod","Jul 30, 2003"

3.58,-14.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice bold golden body. The good white soupy head is less exuberant than many similar Belgians since it is easily controlled and it fades incompletely, but it has exellent lacing. Good fruitiness, mild spiciness, good crisp maltiness. Slightly bitter finish lingers.","aracauna","May 19, 2003"
3.5,-16.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"An indistinct grapefruit yellow color on the pour, the head modest is size, spumous in texture, the color a bright white, after the erosion has taken place, a thin sheet of lace covers the glass. Malt dominates the nose, somewhat tart, also quite clean and fresh with the start sweet, but the tartness hits you at the skeletal top. Finish is spiteful in its bitterness; astringent, dry aftertaste, drinkable but Ive had much better.","Gusler","Mar 13, 2003"
4.83,15.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a magnificently pillowy creamy white head that lasts almost forever and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of white lace. An absolutely beautiful beer. Nose is fruity and spicy with notes of clove, pepper, and floral hops. Very aromatic! Medium in body and very, very smooth. Taste is sweet and spicy at first with flavors of fresh fruit, mild banana, juicy orange, coriander, and pepper followed by a raw yeastiness, spicy hops, and a touch of lemon. A phenomenal brew that requires you to savor each sip.","Morris729","Feb 13, 2003"

4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is an excellent Belgian ale. The taste is fresh and enjoyable. I have had this one several times and I enjoy it more each time. I prefer the 750ml bottle over the 12oz bottle. The larger bottle allows for more action from the yeast during bottle fermentation and the large space allows for the beer to mature more effectively. The flavor is fruity with a bite. The nose is very satisfactory. This beer poured a head like shaving cream thick and creamy with a distinct hoppiness and bitterness to the foam. Takes quite a bit to settle too. I find this to be a well balanced beer and I highly recommend it as an example of fine Belgian brewing.","AtrumAnimus","Jan 09, 2003"

4.15,-1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Golden in hue with a slight haze, topped by a dense, porcelain white head that rises, peaks, then slowly settles.  Attractive, textured lace is left in its wake. Pungently sweet citrus fruity esters along with peppery alcohol hit the nose at first, then malt becomes more prominent and asserts itself aromawise as dryish, white bread like graininess.  Mellow clove and mild mineral notes round the aroma out.  A bittersweet combination of candyish sweetness and black pepper like alcohol is perceived at first in flavor, then is ensued by a melange of clove phenol, vodka soaked semi sweet ripe orange fruit and bready grain similar to that of the aroma.  Surprisingly mild in esters for style.  Contrasting bitterness is supplied both by mild hops and ethyl alcohol flavor.  Overall sweetness is mild, and is mostly derived from residual sugars, not caramel malt.  Spicy alcohol couples with the light sweetness to lend a black licorice undertone to this brew.  Deceivingly light in body, w/ a quasi crisp, quenching mouthfeel that helps lend excellent drinkability considering the strength.  Finishes dry, w/ prickly, yet pleasant alcohol tickling the tongue. Moinette Blond is a very flavorful and somewhat raw Belgian strong that manages to integrate ethanol flavors with sweet fruitiness.  It's dry all around, delcious, and certainly another unique Belgian worthy of a serious tasting.  My bottle's cork indicates a 2000 bottling.","marc77","Oct 10, 2002"

3.93,-6.2,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Beautiful head and carbonation, a good stiff inch of stiff foam.  Paler, hazy gold color.  Grapey, winey aroma, acid cut to the nose.  A bit of true bitter to the flavor, like a Scots Whisky compared to a Bourbon's sweetness, with a decided hoppy close of citrus.  Maybe a little less dry than the Saison, but bolder in flavor.  Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is very well controlled.  A little more sweetness is in order for me, though I'm sure this brew has its fans.","ADR","Aug 05, 2002"
4.8,14.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"As much as I like Saison Dupont, I may like the blonde Moinette even more.  With its higher 8.5% abv (as opposed to the saison's 6.5%), I view it as a sipping version of the saison.  A number of Belgian brewers seem to make a stronger version of their ""normal"" beer -- Rodenbach and de Koninck come to mind.  Similar to the saison in appearance, nose, palate and mouthfeel, Moinette boasts just a little bit more of everything.","BKotch","Apr 07, 2002"
4.7,12.2,4,4,5,5,5,"A smooth and powerful blond coloured beer. Mild banana and clove in the taste. Dry and crisp with a steady sweetness and raw peppery hop notes (from dry hopping). Delicious.","Todd","Oct 14, 2001"
