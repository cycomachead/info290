It may not be at the top of the list of Trappist ales, but you could do far, far worse than this brew.","macpapi","Mar 26, 2015"
4.07,2,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"Smells as rich as it looks, with some leather, prune, and strong raisin scent on it.  Taste follows the same path, with a mild bready flavor on top.  Goes down nice and smooth with a small, yet soft and fluffy head.  Not a ton of complexity, but certainly delivers where it's needed.  Nothing to complain about with this Dutch take on the Trappist.","jmasher85","Mar 05, 2015"

Smell: cooked pear, overripe nectarine, whiff of date bread, buttery note. Taste: lots of plum, dried dates, pear and spiciness and some vinous booziness in the finish. Building prickly yet overall subdued carbonation is really nice. Enjoyable.","babaracas","Feb 10, 2015"

3.5,-12.3,,,,,,"Almost juicy banana along with cane sugar and a subtle hop dryness, including dough wheat, which blends well into the malty body of the beer. The hops compliment to the sweeter body of the beer, not only by adding balancing bitterness, but also by giving the malts a bready characteristic, including a somehow chewy aspect to the otherwise smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with a noteable, lively carbonation, which brings out honey and raisins. This gets accompanied by a supportive bitterness, which leaves the palate a little earlier than the malts do.","aleigator","Dec 07, 2014"

From the nose, I am picking up lots of fruit esters, primarily plum... apple cinnamon, some phenols, and a bready malt character. The initial wave of flavor reveals a big molasses taste, with fig, moving onward to a very spicy, alcohol-laden ending, and a fair amount of sharp hops. The finish is smooth however, leaving a very wholesome grainy flavor on your tastebuds. Overall, very good, but could use some improvement in the balance department.","Neorebel","Nov 19, 2014"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with good strength.

Fair amount of earthy clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, clove, caramel, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 16, 2014"

That being said, I always feel like I'm missing something when I put a Trappist Ale in a chalice, that I'm not concentrating all the complex flavors properly and I'm missing something. However, this could be the point: the monks just want me to drink it and not obsess over it. It's just beer that they made for charitable activities. Or maybe it is more of a visual wow that they're looking for: Look at that glass! Now look at what is in it! So here's my conclusion. Great packaging, but the inside contents are just good, not great. I wouldn't mind having a bigger glass, but I'm okay with the fact that I just have a 11.2oz as well. So overall, I think above average, but not hugely so for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. There are better examples out there.","damndirtyape","Beers"

To put it bluntly, from my snobby opinion this is a well-crafted ale for the style, but at the same time isn't very memorable either.

The aroma features mellow spices characteristic of Belgian yeast. Notes of banana and clove are present along with some candied grapes. The taste is similar to the nose, a bit on the mellow side, very well and delicately balanced. This is very easy drinking and enjoyable. The 7.5% abv is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, the carbonation is moderate. Overall, this brew is very enjoyable. Perhaps it is lacking in bold flavors, but for what it is, it is quite good.","homebrew311","Mar 16, 2012"

Fruity, malty nose with hints of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, banana, and just a touch of bubblegum and oakiness. The fruitiness shines through in the taste as well with lots of pear, apple, and a bit of banana. Really solid malt backbone with hints of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but very smooth with just slightly chewy and syrupy. I tasted the oak aged version of this first and really thought I'd be let down with this version since the oaked was so amazing. But this one holds it's own and it's one of those beers that just screams to be put in a barrel. I'll definitely be picking up more of both of these incredible beers!","beerdrifter","Feb 25, 2012"

4.33,8.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"So far my pick of the La Trappe family. Looks fantastic with a some serious carbonation, a cheesecake lookin head (if you know what I mean), solid and meaty. Nice, hazy sunburst orange. Some fruity esters mixed in with bready malt and some sticky pudding vibes. Caramel brittle, and some sweet yeastiness on the palate. This is very drinkable. Alcohol touch is only light. A great lasting finish. This is a pretty damn good beer, plus at $8 for a 750ml this is insanely cheap.","juju7","Oct 09, 2009"

4.02,0.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Flavor follows the nose, smooth and somewhat rich, yet disparate from its initaial association with a tripel at this point. Nice perky carbonation helps this along. Becomes a bit thin in body after some time yet remaining very drinkable. Alas, an amber triple or a light dubbel. A manageable and drinkable Belgian of moderate strength and character that is enjoyable with or without food and which offers many subtleties.","HalfFull","Sep 24, 2009"
4.18,4.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium body with a good balance of spice, earthy notes, malt backbone, dark and light fruits and sweet alcohol. Clove, pepper and cinnamon spice up front followed by a nice malt backbone with hints of candi sugar, apple, raisin and plum. There is also a slight medicinal syrupy note but it is not overwhelming and actually blends well with the other flavors. The alcohol is noticeable but still pretty well masked at 7.5% making it pretty drinkable. This is a pretty complex beer with some unique flavors and I will definitely be drinking a lot more of this in the future.","corby112","Sep 24, 2009"
4.17,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I really like this beer. Not an Orval clone by any means, but if you like Orval then this will also be a treat. Something I highly recommend.","champ103","Sep 23, 2009"
4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours deep amber with fluffy white head. Smell is rich clove and cinnamon, like a spiced peach. Flavor is carmelly, strong yet delicate, with apricot and pineapple, lightly phenolic and spicy. Mouthfeel is sparkly and carbonated.","Seanibus","Sep 21, 2009"

4.08,2.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"M/D: Slightly bitter character in the finish the is juxtaposed nicely against the sweet flavors the comprise most of the flavor. The beer is medium bodied with the ample carbonation that you would expect from a BPA. It leaves the palate feeling fresh and crisp. Delicious and flavorful, the alcohol provides a nice bit of warmth to usher in the fall.","NittanyBeerFan","Sep 12, 2009"
4.27,7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer poured a slightly hazy, deep copper (with a thick, creamy white head) into a chalice. There was a distinct aroma of Belgian yeast (banana/clove) and fruity esters - what you'd expect in an authentic Belgian ale. More of the bubble-gum Belgian yeast component in the flavor profile, with a nice tart (cherry?) component, and a clean bitter hop finish. A slightly fizzy mouthfeel which brought out and blended all the flavor components together nicely. Heavy Brussel's lacing down the glass. Overall, a nicely balanced and flavorful Belgian ale, true to to style, with its high ABV disguised well.","pershan","Aug 31, 2009"
4.32,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a murky copper amber color and formed a light tan foamy head the left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast and spices. The flavor was of malt, orange, spices and a hint of pepper. The body was medium light and slightly silky. The finish was sweet yet sprite.","Wildman","Aug 30, 2009"

4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I would thing this a BSPA.... hands down.. too much going on for a standard Belgian Pale... but what do I know? Good stuff for sure... I am gonna get these while I can.. I think a bit of time in the bottle will help.. but Isid'or is pretty nice right now... I want another glass.. but Brenda polished off the remnants..","JohnGalt1","Beers"
4.12,3.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall a decent brew. One of the reasons I like La Trappe/Koningshoeven is that they seem more willing to do one off beers like this. Not a trait the Trappist brewers on the Belgian side of the border seem to share.","berkey","0"
4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Ordered a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $7. Served in a chalice it appears light amber with a slight haze. Man, this is a delicious beer. The flavor is a subtle mix of lemon peel, vanilla, white pepper, sweet candy bread, and white grape. The spices are very mellow, but the flavors are deep. The body is very drinkable and if it weren't a little expensive I'd order another.","tempest","Aug 15, 2009"

4.1,2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The body is what makes this a little extra special. Really nice silky body, coats the mouth and tongue. Very very pleasant. With the 7.5 abv, and a body like this, I could potentially drink this beer all evening. Quite enjoyable.","ShareANevada","Jul 17, 2009"
4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had this beer from a bottle this evening while awaiting some friends. It poured a nice tan color with some red highlights. The nose was like a good bier de garde, which I was not expecting, though it was a pleasant surprise. The taste was reminiscent of Gavroche for me, but a little bit more spice in the back of the palate. Mouthfeel was smooth and excellent, you can roll the beer pleasantly around. Overall a highly drinkable 7.5% Belgian. Get it while you can.","BeerDetective","Jul 17, 2009"
4.38,9.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Make sure you try one soon as this batch should be a one-off production and most likely just available in Holland, the homecountry of this monastery/brewery. Not sure how many bottles will be produced.","PapaEugene","Jul 09, 2009"
4.47,12,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a very good Dutch beer, especially for the summer period. One of my favourite La Trappe beers already (although not better than the la Trappe Quadruppel). I hope that the la Trappe brewery will decide to brew this beer also in the future!","rvdoorn","Beers"
4.25,6.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"When they say ""jubilee beer," I think they mean amber, cuz it pours amber. Big fluffy head with an effortless pour - nice. Smells wonderful. Belgian yeast qualities dominate - very clovy, a bit buttery and peppery, candied sugar. I was expecting a sweet taste, but no, excellently balanced - starts a bit bitter, has some caramelly sweetness, and then a long dry finish. Not as complex as the nose suggested, but nice. Pretty high carbonation, but not out of the ordinary for a belgian ale. Very drinkable. This is the kind of beer that can pair well with almost any dish - it's balanced, not terribly complex, not too heavy, but not watery. I like it. I don't know when it will be released on the large scale but It's definitely worth a try.","redmagik99","0"
