"Overall, nice beer! Not epic, but tasty."

"Sweetness is very refreshing. Definitely a mood beer.   :)"

"This has a pleasing pinkish hued color with A lightly floral aroma of flor de Jamaica and a touch of citrus round it out. The jamaica (hibiscus) lends a pleasing floral note to the flavor, something akin to a ‘clean Belgo-yeasty’ character. I liked it."
""
"Bottle: Poured a pinkish color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light sweet malt notes with light fruity ester with some hibiscus notes. Taste is also dominated by hibiscus notes with some sweet malt notes and light fruity ester. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. I was expecting hibiscus to be even more showcase but still an enjoyable beer nonetheless."

"Very tropical-fruity.  Almost like a beer fruit punch"
"Thus far I have not been impressed by Stone's Stochasticity projects. I don't know what a hibiscus tastes like, but this does taste as the label leads. Slight tart, flowerly taste. Would be good on a hot Summer Day, but would not be the first beer I reached for on a hot Summer Day. Not likely to purchase again."
"Something off-putting in the taste"
"I thought I had already reviewed this. Are there 2 hibiscus beers in this 'project'?"

"This is a really tricky beer. The one I'm drinking was bottled on 09/05/14. I'm not sure if some flavor went away with being on the shelf for so long but I still like it. I feel the flavors would really come out if I had this with a meal. I would drink this again. It's smooth and light. The aromas are not powerful but do the job. I really like this beer and would recommend it to a friend if they would want to try something different."

"Pours a hazy pinkish pale amber producing 3 fingers of frothy, off-white, somewhat lasting head which fades into a thin cap leaving a thin wash of splotchy lace. Aroma is slightly sour, Belgian yeast fruit notes of apple with hints of raspberry, cranberry & cherry. Wheat, biscuit & cracker malts, hints of clove & earthy hops. I'm not sure what hibiscus smells like but it should be in there as well. Taste is pale malt, biscuit, wheat, sweet-tart, yeasty & floral (hibiscus?); Belgian yeast esters of apple, cranberry/raspberry & cherry, clove & pepper with earthy hop hints. Finishes spicy with a peppery prickle producing a herbal, vegetal & thin fruity aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation, slightly creamy, a little slick with a peppery prickle in the finish."

"I love Stone and I love all their beers, but this one wasn't for me.  I couldnt get into it at all i had glass and drain poured the rest."

"Definite belgian characteristic with phenolic undertones. MIld fruity hibiscus flavor became more apparent as temperature increased closer to room temp. Poured slightly cloudy with ruby red/pink hue. Improved flavor as approached room temperature. Clean finish. Keep upright, layer of yeast on bottom. Personally not my favorite beer by Stone but very clean and well done for what they were going for."
"maybe the worst stone ive ever had.. but a lot better than so many other breweries!"
"Nice enough but not my jam. Kind of a weird floral, fruity taste up front with a low wave of hop bitterness to follow. I want to like it more than I do."

"Right up my alley! Beautiful cooper color. Orange and citrus with a hint of pepper and smoke. Easy on the hops. Just a tad too sweet.  I think it would be a great beer on a hot summer day."

"Overall I thought this was nice beer, but I wouldn't say it's a great example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, since I didn't pick up much Belgian yeast and to me it tastes me like a Pale Ale base, as an herb/spiced beer I would say it's a little above average for the style.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, slightly refreshing, crisp, a little prickly, not too filling and the taste just did an ok job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, anymore than that and I might start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but it just got to be a little bland and I didn't find it to be too memorable.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try and I wouldn't turn down a glass of it, but it's not something I feel the need to buy more of.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Hibiscus in their beer, I thought that aspect was showcased better than just about every other Hibiscus beer I've had.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it had some good aspects to it, but it also had some that needed a little work and in the end I just wanted a little more out of this beer.  It isn't a favorite Stone beer or a favorite from this series, but it is one of the best Hibiscus beers I've had.  Nice job guys, this was a solid beer, keep up the solid work."

"O:  Luckily, I was able to compare the flavors/smells to some dried Hibiscus flowers I had.  Interesting and different.  I would never have expected Hibiscus in a BSPA."
"Just not my style. This was given to me as a gift for Christmas. Not sure I would like it but it was free so what the hey. It taste to me like a wine cooler. I've tried several fruit beers and I have yet to like one of them. I guess if your into this style it would be fine but it's not for me."

"Sometimes hibiscus beers can seem a bit sweet and overly flowery to me,  so I was a little apprehensive to try this one,  but this was a pleasant surprise.  The hibiscus mixed nicely with some nice citrusy aspects of this beer.  Enjoyable."

"Color is dark pink with no head, just a thin film in the glass. Aroma is very flowery, with some grapefruit notes. Flavor is kinda funky Belgian yeasty flavors, with some citrus notes. Mouthfeel was pretty thin, lacking any bite as well. Overall, I was a little disappointed in this version of the Stochiasticity Project beer, compared to the previous releases."

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, rose tinted copper coloring, with a fluffy, clingy, off-white head that settles into a low profile coating. Aromas of heavy floral notes, tangy sweet old world fruit, bubble gum, cotton candy, toasted grains, subtle citrus highlights, and hints of bitter hops characteristics. Interesting. Flavors are mild, with berry sweetness and fairly heavy floral notes forward. There is a tangy sweet fruit note, with the aforementioned berry highlighted by orange, and a building bitterness in the undertones of the palate. Fairly muted feel, remaining light overall. The aftertaste is more of the citrus acidity, as well as floral and hops bitterness. The finish is fairly short-lived, with only the slightest fruit and floral linger. Definitely a unique brew."

"Overall: A pretty unique and interesting twist on a Belgian ale. Nice presence of fruit and spice. Odd but good."

"While a bit deviant from the stylistic norm, this was strong enough to still fall under the category of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and remain true to form. A bit more yeast and some lemon pepper would have really taken this to another level but as it was, I enjoyed it and how nicely it went down. The floral notes dominated a bit too much here but anyone who loves smooth Belgiian-style beers or Stone's other offerings will not be disappointed here. This is worth a shot for those looking for something a bit off of the beaten path."

"O: Definitely something different (not really that surprising from the project standpoint) that drinks pretty much as billed. Good beer for summer, with all the floral and fruity notes going on. Would be interesting to age some. Pick some up if you like all things Stone or fruity wheat/Belgian beers"
"Drinks easy enough, but doesn't seem that Belgian, yeast profile is damped down, not one I would buy again, but worth a go if you stretching your beer tasting wings"

"O: Not bad but I wasn't a huge fan of the orange peel. I think the hibiscus would have been better on its own."

"I've loved beer for years and I am starting to branch out onto being a aficionado.  I stoll have yet to learn the terminology but I had this beer for the first time at a place called the Station Taproom in Downingtown, PA. I fell in love. I think this is definitely my new favorite.  Blue Moon is definitely taking a backseat to this one. Now if I could just find out where to get it..."

"Tastes like hand soap smells. Do not burp if you're unfortunate enough to be drinking this. First time I've been disappointed by a Stone collab"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy deep red-orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, apricot, berries, banana, orange peel, hibiscus, clove, herbal, grass, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/spice/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced Belgian pale ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Delicious"

"A pleasant and duly enjoyable offering - usually (i.e., the handful I've yet had) hibiscus beers are patently underwhelming, as the delicateness of the flowers can't stand up to the process. Not here, oh not here - florals and fruit abound.  Good stuff for a mere purported 'project'."

"Overall-  Perhaps my second favorite (Quadrotriticale being #1) Stochasticity offering, Hibiscusicity is the glamorous, avant-garde and maybe “black sheep” cousin to Verboten or Maredsous 6.  Keep up the strange work, Stone."

"O: When you buy a Stone beer, you expect a high quality. I find it funny that the last one of their beers I tried was the awesome Xocoveza. This one is a total misfire."
""
"O: Highly drinkable Belgian ale with a unique flavor profile. Lighter Belgian ales are not my favorite style and I do not love the yeast profiles, but this one is quite palatable, even though it may not be true to style.  Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pinkish orange hue, with a 1/2"" head.  Big floral and ctrius aroma. The taste follows the nose as the hibiscus and orange really come through with some moderate wheat profile. Refrshing and it has a short lasting aftertaste. Well balanced beer."
""

""

"O: Interesting beer, refreshing and the tart bite makes you want to keep sipping. I would have liked a bit more hop presence."
"O- A pretty good beer, but didn't wow me.  Worth trying, would like to see how it ages."

"It pours a beautiful pinkish red with a one finger lacey head. The nose is yeasty and fruity like a typical Belgium style. The orange smell is present and there is a subtle perfume fragrance. That might be the hibiscus. The flavor is almost candy like.  It's very sweet and the hibiscus is quite present. I would prefer a much thicker mouth feel"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium red-orange amber with a half finger aged ivory head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of strawberries, stone fruit with an overripe fruit or tropical flower component. Flavor is orange citrus and overripe tropical fruit, berries, slightly buttery wheat; finishes with floral fruit and a slight clove astringency. Medium bodied with good carbonation. An appropriately floral influenced Belgian with interesting but odd fruit flavors. Slightly unbalanced; the malt body does not seem to support the floral and fruit flavors throughout the taste. Kept me interested, but once was enough."
"Nice tart and citrus notes but the flavor dies at the end."
""
""
"Taste: Great carbonation. Lemon cake with some faint bitterness. A very smooth a slightly syrupy finish.  Strawberry and apple juice."
