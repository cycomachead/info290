"Pink tinge and golden color. Bright melon and grapes, lite farmhouse. Easy going pale with fruit forward flavors"
""
"Color is a amber, orange, red, and copper mixture with a little bit of clearness.  Pours a two finger bubby head.  Aroma has a lot of bright fruit and a sweet and dry malt.  Lots of that dry, bright fruity taste upfront which transitions to a slightly tart/dry cracker finish.  Lots of carbonation in this and medium in body.  Overall, if the price tag of $20 bucks wasn't so ridiculous I'd definitely get this again.  Nice fruity red grape flavors balanced by a dry and slighty tart finish.  Definitely worth a try even for those who don't like fruitier beer since its so balanced."

"Lightly hazy deep straw with hints of purple. Fruity earthy spicy aromas and flavor with a bit of a jelly or jam edge to it. Interesting brew a bit outside of the box, not something I'd have often but glad I got to try it."

"Overall - this is a nice meld of wine and beer flavors and characteristics. I felt the flavor was pretty deep and rich, with the fruitiness playing off against the malts. I actually think the pork was a weak pairing for this - could go with something much more hearty, maybe even venison."

"I applaud the effort, interesting mess Allagash has made here. Slight head and sticky lacing look good, the brew is the color of tea and smells faintly of bread and grapes. There's the taste of malt and an odd thinness from the grapes. Overall, not something I'd go out of my way for."

"O- Been wanting to try this for a long time and it was worth the wait. A great, fruity Belgian that's actually a bit different from Allagash's usual MO."
"O - love Allagash but I've experienced every once in a while a metallic finish in their bombers. That being said this one has something to offer for both the experienced enthusiast and not so much. I think its most impressive quality is its lightness when regarding its abv."

"Definitely vinous in character flavor wise along with some french belgian like flavors but finishes a little overly metallic or tinny, or almost blood like. Starts with sweet malt followed by funky belgian yeasty undertones along the mid-palate. deep red wine flavors, high acidiy covered brisk carbonation. Finishes again with that very tinny finish. There is a fain bitterness that comes through that balances things pretty well."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re into beers with wine-like attributes."

"Certainly different from the Victoria but I would probably get this beer again when it's available but I won't be running over people to do so."

"2013 Vintage. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, rose-tinged copper coloring with a bubbly, frothy, off-white head that sits a consistent half an inch on the surface. Aromas of semisweet fruity notes, like a Blush or Rose wine. Some subtle spice highlights, as well. Subtle nose. Flavors are well blended, with a rich, tangy sweet grape profile. Highlights of earth and wood throughout, with a tartness that underlies it all. The carbonation and crisp body keep this brew light in mouth while you drink. Slightly boozy berry and grape aftertaste, with hints of clove and all spice. The beer has an effervescent, slightly dry finish. Tasty brew, and surprisingly easy to drink."

"Overall: It's a solid belgian pale and the grapes do add some additional complexity. Pretty good stuff, though not quite worth the high price tag."
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty good, steep in price for not being barrel aged. I remember last years version a bit more favorably but this one isn't bad. good complexity and it's something different"
"D: not sure how well this bottle held up with time. would like to have a fresh Victor to compare. regardless, haven't had a brew like this, very vinous throughout the nose and drink."

"2008 vintage on tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, low retention on a clear, light golden body. Clear lacing, some suds. Aroma is deep and musty, includes green apple, green grapes and some candy sugar. Taste follows the aromas pretty closely, no alcohol on tasting or in aroma. This beer has aged incredibly gracefully. Developed some extra sweetness and some complexity. Wonderfully delicious and extremely tasty."

"O: Allagash is an excellent American brewery that produces exceptional Belgium style beers. This is just another over whelming amazing brew. If it is available definitely give it a try."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2009 bottling. A bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours very cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with very good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grape, apple, pear, biscuit, clove, pepper, grape skin, herbal, earth, honey, caramel, and yeast spiciness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of apple, pear, grape, herbal, pepper, biscuit, clove, earth, honey, grape skin, caramel, and yeast spiciness. Slight grape skin tang on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, bread, honey, earth, herbal, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and flavor complexity; with no cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong pale ale. Fairly unique flavor profile with great balance and flavor complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one."

"This is a decent beer. It doesn't have a Belgian yeast character to it and it has a nice balanced flavor. Perfect to sip from the tulip amongst friends."
""
"Pours a lightly hazed golden orange color, whispy plume of white head, gone quickly leaving some spots. Scent bring unfermented grape must, a light spicy yeast presence and some peppery spice, hints of sweet watery fruit and some bready charachter. Taste controlled by tart grape must, spicy, honey like sweetness, minimal grain charachter. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Strong grape and spice notes, lacks delicate notes."

"Pours a hazy honey brown with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain/malt, spices, and some fruity aromas. Taste is the same with some yeast flavors and a slight metallic flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is better than the taste."

"B-"
"Poured into a Nostradamous flute glass. Pours a clear orange yellow amber, honey colored. One finger medium white head with good retention and nice lacing. Looks nice. Mild aroma of apples, light malt and a hint of Belgian spicing. Taste is light malt, apple juice, Belgian yeast with a somewhat dry finish where the vinous characteristics show up. Medium bodied. An interesting, not very complex Belgian style ale. I like the vinous finish less than most Belgians ales. An obviously well made ale that just did not suit my palate."
""

"O - Overall, not my favorite Allagash by far. I prefer Victoria better, the grapes are intergrated a bit more. This meanwhile was a yeasty mess."
"Overall (3.5): Different but not something that I will go out of my way for. I like it with some age on it, but fresh it wasn't very enjoyable."

"2010 vintage. Pours a red tinted straw color with a head that quickly settles to a light lacing that never goes away. There is a light aroma that is mostly grapes and some grains. The tastes is just a bit sweet but it allows this to be very easy to drink. There is a couple other light fruit flavors hidden in there but nothing that really stands out for me. Each sip is lighter than the other. The 9% is well hidden. Overall, another quality selection from Allagash. Really enjoyed this one even though it was a bit sweet, but to be expected."

"Drinkability- This is a wonderful strong Belgian-style pale. It has strong base malt notes and spicy additions from the yeast. The Cabernet grapes add tangy sweet flavors and are a solid addition. An expensive beer, but worth the money. Allagash does it again."

"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed burnt orange with a large blooming white head that left multiple rings of broken lace behind as it settled slowly.White grape skin really stands out in the nose with what alot of people have mentiones,a sweet cake-like note,a healthy does of herbal hops,and sharp phenols round out the aromas.Phenols play a bigger role on the palate providing spice and sharpness,white grape fruitiness,and herbal hops in the finish.A pretty good rendition of the style,the phenols are a little heavy on the palate for me though."
"A pretty good beer overall. It doesn't taste as strong as the 9.0 percent, so watch out."
"This beer reminded me a little of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch. This brew poured out with a nice golden color to it, the head was white and fluffy. The smell of the grapes on the nose came through nicely and gave this beer a slight wine-like aroma to it. The taste of the beer was on the sweet side and leaves you with a good aftertaste also. The grapes are more sweet than tart I think, either way still pretty nice. The mouthfeel of this beer was well carbonated and had a fairly light body to it. Overall this beer was nice, Probably one of the better Allagash brew I've had. I would drink this one again."
"Oh! It was gusher, but I hadn't cooled it before opening. A rookie mistake. Don't open at 70 degrees, or you'll lose a bit of beer."
"O: A nice hybrid-type beer that definitely stays in the beer realm, but captures some nice wine-like qualities. The red grapes used impart a subtle sweetness that isn't too overbearing, and the wine yeast strain doesn't overpower the beer qualities. Very nicely done"
"I'm grateful for already having tried this beer in Portland on tap and bottle poured already. I was lookin for the perfect wine-beer hybrid to share with my father and this seems to have done the trick. Although the beer is pricy it's absolutely worth the money if you are searching for a flavorful Belgian style ale sweetly blended with grapes, or just a good beer in general."
"overall, very solid beer. no 'wow' factor per se, but pretty damn tasty. i'm enjoying it quite a bit."
"Overall this is one nice beer. Worth trying once or twice but not really worth 11 dollars."
"The palate is a little syrupy, sweet, but the carbonation cuts teh syrupy mouthfeel for a little balance. Just a little noticeable warmth from the alcohol. Rather mellow overall."
"O - I don't really feel like drinking this one again. I like grape juice just fine, but juice is juice, beer should seem more like beer."
"The color is slightly pink with a white head. smell is of the grapes and other fruity tones, with slight hint of belgian style yeasts. Flavor is sweet, but not cloyingly so. more grape. very light mouthfeel. overall, solid beer, but nowhere near the price tag i paid for it though."
"There are many beers not brewed with grapes that rival the complexity and elegance of even the finest wines; this one, however, barely even affords the simple quaffability of an average beer. Allagash has proven they know what they're doing with barrels so perhaps it's my own tastes that account for my disappointment with this offering. Either way, this is not a cheap beer and a 750ml bottle is quite a commitment - it's not something I'll be buying again."
"jd"
"O: Just really disappointing. I like that the grape flavor is there, but it's just too sugary."
"O: I'm not going to say this is my favorite Allagash brew, but it is a solidly made, flavorful beer."
"The yeast is much more prevalent than I expected on the flavor. Uber-bready, and I am surprised there is not a big fruit ester surge, grapes pretty much stand alone in that regard. Hops are there aplenty and kind of muddle things up a bit. Malts are toasty and crackery, light toffee. Spicy and phenolic, light acidity and some grape tannins. Interesting to say the least, although I am not sure I would buy it againâ€¦even at half the $17 price tag."
"Definitely an interesting taste experience. The subtle blend of flavors are much more than the sum of their parts. There is craftstmanship in the restraint shown here and the beer never threatens to overwhelm the senses."
"This is a wonderful beer. I've had really good luck sitting on Allagash stuff for about 1 to 2 years, no exception here. Extremely refined, complex and balanced. Highly recommended with some age."
"Opinion: I have been pretty impressed with this beer. To me, it is obvious that they did a number of test batches or blends to get the balance right. I like how the hops are such a big player in the aroma and the initial parts of the taste, then they step aside and let the rest of the beer do its thing for the finish. The grapes seem to really work with this beer. I think that they have done this really well."
"The mouthfeel is light and lively, much like a white wine with bubbles. No elements of booze or stickiness to detract from the tasting experience. Overall, I really liked this beer and would sample again sometime. Thanks for the bottle share, Adam!"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown color with an off white head. In the aroma, candy sugar and a sweet white wine. In the taste, candy sugar and yeasty. Almost like a sweet chardonnay or a riesling. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry riesling like aftertaste. It is like a beer version of a nice white wine, quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer and not too boozy given the 9% ABV. This is a beer to hold on to and enjoyed with others given the $18 price tag."
"D: The alcohol is hidden fairly well and makes this quite drinkable. The price tag makes it hard to drink often. This is a decent beer, but nothing special. The grapes aren't too prevalent when drinking, although you can tell there were grapes used in brewing it. Not worth the $18 price tag in my opinion."
"The taste is great, I would love to have this at Thanksgiving. The taste stars with a slight yeast flavor mixed with malt. This quickly givesway to a tart wine and almmost cranberry flavor. The mouth is a building of carbonation that finishes dry. Very nice"
"Pours a hazed gold in color with a tint of amber. Head is bone white and short livid, just leaving a few spots of lace. In the aroma, big time fragrant wine grapes adding a nice white wine type element. They really hit it out of the park with the aroma, this beer smells great. In the flavor, the wine grapes are still there along with some peppery Belgian yeast. Certainly Belgian ale yeast, lending its subtle fruity complexities that really shine through and play off the grapes. Mild tartness that has mellowed out to just a notion. Alcohol is quite tame and just present in the end. Delicate feel with a nice level of carbonation. Nice and drinkable, this is one hell of a beverage."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It had a nice body, good balanced flavors and hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. Not the best dark Belgian ever, but still very enjoyable. Was lucky to find this for $9 for a 12 oz serving at a bar because even though it was good, you really don't need to have a whole 750ml of it."
"D- This beer alone feels unfinished. I can see why they added the sour aspect with Victor Francenstein."
"Bottle. Poured into a New Belgium tulip style glass a clear copper color with a slighlty offwhite coastered head. The nose is a blended aroma of slight belgian yeast and subtle grape. Medium mouthfeel with a semi lively carbonaton level. The taste is grape, not overally so but a nice subtle grape balance against the belgian esters. Ends with a slight bitter tanic taste. For 9.3% the alcohol is fairly well hidden and not apparent. Pretty easy drinking."
"Thanks to Stan for sharing these. Bottle poured into a snifter produced a two finger white head that laced out quickly. The body of the brew was a orange to copper in color. I got a large whiff of dark fruits coming off this brew. Raisins and plums stuck out the most. Flavor wise it came off like a fizzy red wine but with a dry finish from the hops. It had a medium body to it with good carbonation. It drank really well I would think this would be a great brew to pair with a good steak. As with most Allagash it's a little pricey but worth it"
"D: Very drinkable for as big of a beer as it is."
"D: Goes down entirely way too easily, nice kick, nice representation of style. This beer is blended far too nicely. You would never guess the ABV on this one! I'd get it again in a heart beat."
"2009 vintage. Pours a one finger tight white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is spicy fruit. Flavor is malty fruit, spices, hints of grape. Better than their Victoria Ale. Higher ABV is hidden. Pricey at $15.49 for a caged & corked 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D: Well, it's up and it's down. It is 9% abv, but the burn on the finish of the taste is harsh and this brew feels like it hits harder than only 9. This bottle is somewhat of a chore to drink alone, but the sweetness and sourness of the grapes is really quite pleasant, and as it warms, the crispness of the pilsner/pale malt backbone makes up for the increased alcohol burn. This sort of reminds me of wine, but like a mix between a sweet red and less sweet white."
"D-the flavor is well balanced and more integrated than the nose. its slightly messy but the flavors are nice and it is rather easily drinken. not a whole lot of yeast but huge malt presence, interesting take on the belgian style."
"Pours a slightly dirty golden color with an off white head. Nose brings forth some yeast but mostly a lot of grapes. This carries over into the taste where, despite some yeast and spice, this is almost just a fancy grape juice. Feel consists of a medium body and good carbonation. All together, this is just a bit much and almost tastes like a grape juice mixture."
"Clean, crisp, and very drinkable. Strong overall grape impression but no one flavor dominates."
"On-tap at Hopleaf...A light good with an off white head, ok retention and lacing...The aroma has a lot going on but not successfully, very vinous throughout, grape seed, champagne-esque yeast...The taste is pinot grigo with spice, very vinous again, feels like you're drinking a wine. This is not very good and should be skipped."
"D - I'm glad I got to try this on-tap, not because it was great, but because I saved myself from buying an expensive bottle. It was passable, and I didn't any problems finishing my tulip. Hope Victor Francenstein is better."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is also a bit above average. Drinkability is pretty decent, the grapes added some nice and interesting flavors to it. It felt a bit one dimensional with the grape juice flavors but at the same time they did a nice job at making those flavors work so well in a beer. A cool beer I'm glad I got to try."
"Drinks quite nice for a 9%er."
"Overall, this is a sweet but delicious ale from Allagash. I had little idea of what to expect from this beer but the blending of grapes and wine-yeast into a beer seems to work quite well."
"Appearance is a cloudy golden color with a thin head with some bubbles. The smell has the grapes that I expected, as well as a good amount of malt and an overall earthiness to it. Taking a sip, the taste is sweet, with more of the grapes, I taste some apple as well. I also note belgian yeast with some bitterness to Victor. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. All in all, this is a very drinkable beer, especially for the style. It had been some time that I had been meaning to try it and am glad that I finally did."
"Not bad, but a bit overly sweet for me. Cork almost freed itself and the beer slowly started to overflow. Served at close to correct temperature. Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, textured, cream colored head and a little bit of lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is hugely dominated by yeast, then grape must, some malt. Flavor is quite sweet up front with a bit of bitterness in the back. And under it all is a general Belgian style strong amber ale. Body is quite soft and mouth filling; carbonation isn't enough to handle the sweetness. Maybe a good dessert beer. Finish is like flavor, medium in length and ending with a slight alcohol sweetness."
"D: This started off smelling very similar to Victoria, but the taste was much sweeter rather than hoppy and sour. It had a nice body too and hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. Not the best dark Belgian ever, but still very enjoyable. Cellaring could possibly improve it."
"D = Slow Slow Slow let this baby get to about room temp before you drink it."
"D: Quite tasty in small batches. A little too much on the sweet side for more than one, but delicious nonetheless. Great balance of flavor and masking of alcohol."
"D: Not bad, a little too sweet and heavy to get a higher score in drinkability. Consider this one more of an after dinner sipper than a pre-gaming quaffer."
"At the Allagash promo, Coppermine Pub in North Arlington NJ: poured a mildy cloudy yellow with less than a finger of white head, and decent head retention. Very herbal/spicy, dry peel, and some candi sugar in the nose. Nicely balanced aroma. However the taste was a little less so; very spicy, with no hint of fruitiness, and a dry grapefruit peel finish. I will say though that the alcohol content was extremely well hidden. Mildly carbonated, medium body. Given the flavor progression and high alcohol content, I was exactly rushing to session this, but a good beer all-around..as usual from these guys."
"D: A quality product from Allagash, but a pass at the $17-20 they're asking. At those prices to rebuy, a beer needs to have a 5 in taste. Good beer, just overpriced."
"Missed this one when it was at Paradiso, so I was jazzed (check out my jazz hands!) to see it at the CK. Everyone deserves a second chance. *single tear* It pours a mostly clear golden straw topped by a half-finger of large white bubbles, though I wouldn't name them (if you catch my drift). The nose comprises white grapes, red grapes, cane sugar, and peaches. I really do like this smell. Yes I do. Yuppers. Anyway, the taste holds notes of white grapes, banana, cloves, a slight bitterness, and an even slighter tartness. ...Is slighter a word?... The body is a light medium, with moderate carbonation and a dry, partially bitter finish. Good times."
"D- Nice Belgian beer that goes down very easy."
"On tap this past Saturday night at the Dive Bar in Worcester. Served in a 0.25l Allagash glass for $6. Dull orange color, with a hint of forest green in the body. Fizzy white head. Smelled like a glass of wine - fresh and a bit boozy. Taste was quite different and unique. There was a lot of grape flavor to this beer. The brewer really got a lot of the flavor out of the barrel and into the beer. I have had a few beers aged in wine barrels, and this one was one of the best examples. Mouthfeel fell somewhere between a dark ale and a wine: easy to drink, but a sipper. A small glass was all I needed for this beer, it was an appropriate amount. A great beer to try if searching for something new, or a nice crossover beer for wine lovers."
"D: A small sample is sufficient. I'm glad I tried it, but don't feel compelled to try this one again."
"The beer pours golden-orange with a white head. The aroma is citrus with some grape notes. The flavor is heavy on the grapes along with some nice citrus flavors. There is some alcohol detectable as well as some Belgian yeast character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Excellent as well...At 9.3%, there was zero alcohol flavor. I could drink these for hours (or until I passed out)."
"This beer has an odd late sweet flavor. The sweetness somehow avoids the front of the palate. There is a slight lactic flavor. There is also an odd yeast character. Overall its smooth. Drinkability if fine."
"D: an interesting sipper that would be great to wean a wine lover to beer."
"D - Like it. For the style, very drinkable."
"Edit: 1/12/2010. I will note that I really liked the Victoria Ale, but that was brewed with Belgian yeast I believe. So perhaps it is the wine yeast that gives it the taste I don't like. Finally, three other people tasted this at my table, and 2 of them were very mad to have spent $8 on 8-10oz. The other thought it was average and worth trying."
"M&D- Victor goes down easy enough although the 10 percent is a bit easy to detect. This goes down pretty smooth for a medium sized semi sweet beer, the carb was on point as well, not overly crisp. Im glad i tried it on tap as a whole bottle would have been a chore. Perhaps i'll buy a fresh bottle and share with friends."
"Softly carbonated up front with a nice sweet alcohol and grape flavor. The vinous characteristic from the aroma isn't present here but there is some earthy oak tannis but not too much so. Slightly cider like with ints of apple as well as some caramel and toffee. The ABV is decently masked but the sweet alcohol presence is still there. No noticeable heat or alcohol warmth in the finish. Sightly dry herbal/medicinal aftertaste. This was pretty good and I would like to try a fresh vintage to compare. It has held up remarkable well."
"Overall I feel as though the bottle version was a bit harsher than what I remember the tap version tasting like. I found that odd considering the bottle was from 2007. Anyhoo, this is a good beer but there are better ones out there from Allagash."
"Though I like this beer a lot, I could never have finished this bottle myself. A little grape goes a long way."
"A classic Belgian flavor of yeast, high alcohol and pale malts. I would not describe this as a dark ale. There is a tartness to the beer that one could associate with grapes, but I would not be able to specifically as grape-like, perhaps it's the tannin. Good body."
"Again, not really what i expected, but i didn't know what to expect from this beer. It's interesting, experimental, and it all works very well together."
"D - Well, this is fairly drinkable for what it is, but I am starting to join the camp that thinks this category should also factor in the price tag, which in this case is simply too high. Allagash is becoming brutally expensive."
"A very wine like beer, and probably a good one to share with a wine aficionado. The alcohol is perceived well, so the drinkability is lowered a bit, but it's similar to most wines."
"Taste is sweet but also some sour with a hint of wine. Nice and dry, with a good amount of bitterness."
"Definitely a boozey beer. The flavors are extremely complex and playful and the alcohol packs a punch. With that said, it was very easy to put back. Each sip yielded new characteristics."
"D: This is very wine-like and should be savored. Great for sipping."
"Darker copper color poured without much head. Pleasant, interesting smell, medium malts and lots of fruit - apple, green grape, melon. Flavor-wise this beer had a nice malt base, but was way too fruity for my tastes. White wine flavors really dominated the beer inside and out. Sweet, very tart and lots of carbonation. Drinkable..not so much. More of a slow sipper. Definitely better than the Victoria, which to me is almost like drinking a chardonnay-beer mix, but not what I would look for in this style."
"This obviously needs to be compared with Victoria. Both are different and interesting in their own way. Victoria is more subtle and fruity. The flavors here are more assertive, dry, and sour. I highly recommend both beers."
"Drinkability: If I hadn't recently enjoyed the sister brew Victoria, I would have liked this better. Victoria vastly outshines it as a much more refined product."
"Definitely a complex ale and not the first that I've had that was brewed with grapes. It doesn't quite fit the style (except for the raisin notes) but it is nevertheless a solid ale. A bit pricey but if you want to treat yourself, it's worth a try."
"To me this beer is a little more like a weak sparkling wine than a beer. It does a great job of straddling the line between the two. Not sure if it's worth $20/btl, but it's a very good beer nonetheless. Certainly recommended with Mexican food that doesn't carry too much spice."
"Sampled out of a bottle at the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski. The color was a dark orange/gold, the head off-white. Decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, alcohol, a touch of Chardonnay grapes and some fruit esters. The flavors were similar, but I wasn't thrilled. Bready malt, dark fruit, a light spiciness from the yeast, and the punch of booze. Dry, acidic and tannic, reminiscent of a brut champagne. Interesting, but it lacked finesse. The mouthfeel was a good, the carbonation high and the body medium. It was ok, but it was expensive to purchase and for the same dollar I'd rather have something (or a couple somethings) else."
"I'm a huge fan of Allagash brews, but I think this one is a bit below their other special offerings. Definitely a unique brew worth trying but not something I'm going to seek out (like a Musette or Odyssey)"
"D: Fairly drinkable, although I'm not sure I would go back for a second bomber."
"Overall, this is a solid beer but not as good as some of the others in this line (Curieux,Musette). Very creamy and remarkably well hidden alcohol, yet it left something to be desired. Not that it was a bad beer by any means, but I've been spoiled by their other exceptional offerings I guess."
"Pours a cloudy copper, almost dark orange, thick off white head forms, drops tons of lace, very rocky head, settles to a medium layer, looks good. Smell is neat, light sourness and acidity, grapes and wine, wood, raspberries and assorted fruitiness, oranges, more fruit than the Victoria, a little more intense with the aroma. Taste is light sour and tannic, strawberries, oranges, bread, melons, very dry in the middle, some nice bready malt and oak, bit of funky sourness in the finish, very fruity, pretty neat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, very dry, nice funky finish, I liked."
"This beer defines ""nothing spectacular"" for me. Served on tap at The Great Lost Bear. Pours dark reddish orange with a fluffy, cream colored head. Spotted lacing prevailed. The smell was of red grapes (a sort of Welch's grape juice aroma, but not as sugary sweet). The taste was similar. I didn't enjoy it too much. There wasn't much bitterness to speak of. The middle mouthfeel was the worst part about it: too much grape sweetness."
"overall just an average ale, nothing too impressive here the victoria ale is much better."
"Just a bit of haze to this orange/amber beer. The light beige cap showed good head retention and produced some chunky, sticky lacing. Vinous aroma, lots of wine and red grape skin, juicy and fruity, bready with a bit of earthiness. Mild tropical fruit and citrus notes appeared as it warmed. Malty flavour up front, quite fruity, grape and raisin, similar to the aroma but a little less vinous. Nicely balanced with flavours really melding, a bit of toffee sweetness held things together. Smooth, malty texture, moderate carbonation and medium bodied, a bit dry. Good stuff. Quite tasty with well hidden alcohol."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. great malty depth. i really enjoyed the grape character too. good stuff."
"Good, but I had higher expectations."
"Overall, not the most exciting beer to drink, but I finished half a bottle just fine."
"The aroma is unimpressive with malt, cheese yeast, and grapes. The appearance is deep gold amber with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall I like it but it's not as good as I was hoping. A really mediocre beer from a good brewer."
"D - this is an excellent beer. I'm not sure the style listed is correct, but this is another epic win for Allagash. Different, tasty, and highly recommended. Definitely check this out. Would gladly drink another"
"Good nicely balanced beer. Some hop bitterness on the fninish. Fruity throughout and dominating on the mid palate. A hint of raisin, pinot noir grapes, black cherry, berry fruit, spicey etheral qualities. Light bodied but long on the finish. I could drink this beer all day and not get tired of it. Very easy sitting on the palate. The grapes show through nicely."
"I'd say it was a decent beer and definitely interesting, but just too expensive for the quality. It was awfully bitter and overshadowed by a high ABV. I love Allagash's experimental tendencies and their constantly pushing the limit, but the last several brews I've had by them just haven't delivered the quality I expect for the price I've paid."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a clear toasted grain color with an average soapy white head that didn't leave much as it settled. The aroma is of white grapes, a bit cidery. The grape aroma pretty much dominates everything else. The taste is again of white grapes, honey, a hint of pepper and grain, ending with some bittering hops. The feel is moderate with fairly soft carbonation, the finish starts off slick but ends up dry. A very nice BSPA that doesn't knock your socks off with sweetness or spice but delivers a very drinkable brew. A nice drying finish rounds off the brew that make drinking the 750ml bottle enjoyable."
"Booze isn't detectable and the crisp carbonation adds a refreshing aspect to a beer already eerily similar to a Provencal Rose. An excellent, if not unexpected, choice for a summer brew."
"D - The carbonation, not the alcohol, seems to want to catch up with me after a bit. Still a very drinkable and classy beer (as noted below). Excellent marriage of grain and grape. Expensive, though."
"Impressive. What a delicious beer."
"This is not a Belgian strong dark, but it is tasty, if a little odd. I don't like this as much as any of the Russian River wine barrel aged beers or DFH Red and White, but it has some similar characteristics. Pours a beautiful golden with a very nice finely bubbled white head that sticks around as a cap and some spotty lacing. Smells of coriander with a touch of clove, tart grapes that are somewhat subtle, but contribute a pronounced sweet-tartness, and a touch of pepper. The taste is similar, quite tart with a lot of coriander and a bit of pepper. Perhaps a few too many grapes for me here. Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing, but again the tartness is foremost. Interesting, but not spectacular."
"Bottle courtesy of Jay23: Poured a deep hazy copper/orangey color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light grape taste. Taste is a quite complex mix between some light grapes, sweet Belgian malt with some yeasts attenuation and a light funky finish. Very light notes of oak and tart notes are also noticeable. I find this beer to be quite good but not sure I would purchase very often considering the price tag."
"Pours a rich dark gold with a yeasty froth cap. Fruity, tart nose supported by the first lip-puckering taste. Grape flavors and rich, smooth maltiness soon take the lead, well balanced by refreshing hop bitterness. Very much unlike most beers of this style--to my taste, like a cross between a triple and a biÃ¨re de garde. Unlike the former, there's more thick malt and candy sugar flavors, and unlike the latter, more crisp tartness. Excellent offering though, as always, from the folks at Allagash."
"D- Very enjoyable beer. Not the kind of beer I drink frequently, but when I do, I look forward to it."
"Pours a reddish amber hue with a bright white, delicate head and excellent clarity. Nice lacing. Quite fruity aroma that conveys a juicy feeling along with the phenols that are typical to the style. It also has an element that is caramel-sweet and somehow winey at the same time -- the aroma reminds me a bit of a gewurztraminer without the spice. On the palate, tangy and sweet from start to finish, with bright, full fruitiness (oranges) from the mid-palate onward. Active, slightly solvent finish of raw alcohol. Overall, this is very well done. This is seemingly a very sweet beer, although I would not be surprised if it's just the fruitiness of it fooling my brain. I would be very curious to try a version of this beer without grapes added -- as it is, it just tastes like a well executed, fruity Belgian ale without any overtly winey or grapey characteristics. Well done."
"The taste is more tart/sour than I expected but in a pleasant way, even though it makes me pucker after drinking. Quite a carbonation kick, usually too much is bad but it works very well with this."
"Not a bad use of grapes at all - present but in a supportive role - Fairly complex. A very slow one, with some astringency and alcohol making it a bit tough to get through. Interesting."
"D - I came away from this impressed and apathetic at the same time. On one hand, this beer does a great job blending the grape qualities with the rest of the beer, so that neither overpowers the other, and the funk in this beer was the best I've noted in a non-Belgian beer. On the negative side, I felt this beer, while complex, lacked the focus that makes the great Belgian beers great. Something to try, but doubt I will grab another..."
"Pours a warm orange amber color with shallow wispy off white head that struggles and settles to the surface nicely. Visibly effervescent, a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of this St. Feuillien goblet generating intense surface pools of foam that leave textbook spotty patterns of Belgian lacing . The smell is aggressive. There is an undeniable presence of the alcohol at first over a tart yet sweet fruity fragrance and an almost balanced earthy malt and yeasty aroma (this bottle indicates 9% ABV vs the 10.40% indicated on this page) . Well carbonated without being 'fizzy', the signature tiny bubbles of this Belgian Strong Ale give the mouth feel a really wonderful creamy texture. The first sample is notably 'warming'. The alcohol is neither timid nor distracting. Full flavored, the creamy tartness of the mouth and classic fruity taste from this Belgian yeast finishes with a pleasant, almost dry sensation. This one is a keeper. While the ""dark"" piece of this is understated, the complexity is well worth considering. Highly recommended."
"Somehow I finished the bottle with some minor help from a friend. Not one I would revisit anytime soon. Allagash bottles alot of their experiments, and this is one I can't recommend."
"Starts like a Duvel, finishes like a sherry. An interesting, complex taste, but definitely an aggressive beer. The hot alcohol detracts from the drinkability, but otherwise an interesting beer."
"750ml bottle poured into a red wine glass. Pretty red/orange color with a small head; a very still beer, looked like a Cantillon offering. A sweet, fruity (mostly pear, a little grape) aroma. Fairly tart taste, some yeast. Impression of grape juice. A pretty good beer, but I didn't think it was up to the usual Allagash standard."
"D- This beer has a nice flower smell and some good balance of sweetness and bitterness. It had a unique blended flavor so it was a bit hard to describe but very tasty."
"Drinkability: Interesting experiment but ultimately a failure, in my book; not very drinkable as the balance is out of whack and the flavor profile is just not that enjoyable"
"Drinkability- Overall a good all around beer...better than average for sure....but I think my days are over of paying these exorbitant prices for Allagash special releases. I still have the Interlude and the Musette to have very soon...both cost more than $15 a pop...the jury remains in session until then."
"750ml bottle from RSVP in Portland. Hazy amber-red body with a thin film of off-white head. Smells fruity, peppery, and spicey. Tastes fruity, with grapes and raisin flavors playing a prominent role. Spice, roasty malts, and alcohol warming all play big roles too. Fairly full bodied with less carbonation than expected, but enough to make this beer surprisingly refreshing. A pretty darn good beer, with some good wine qualities too."
"Drinkability: Allgash is one of those breweries well-known for always cooking up interesting twists and turns to implement into their brewing. Some of these ideas pay off in beer drinking gold and others, well, they just remain as cute concepts. For me, this is one of the latter."
"Overall a quality brew from Allagash as always, and definately overpriced. It was an interesting idea and fun to taste with friends, but could in no possible way become a regular or be affordable in a commercial setting."
"OK this is another specialty from Allagash. The beer poured a light amber color. The taste was smooth with a hint of fruit. I would even say a sweet taste. Now here it the problem I have this beer. Unlike most Allagash beers I've had this one didn't stand out from any other fruity beers. I can probably name 4, 5 or even 6 beers that have the same tastes. Now this is not to say this is not a good beer. It is, very much so."
"This somehow seems to fizz in the end, the grape flavors just don't add up to a complexity of flavor; what really seems to be the problems is that the grape / berry notes are too dominant, the underlying beer flavors don't play enough of a role for a beer this clean. Did I mention that this beer is fairly clean, it really could use quite a bit more funk to it; a touch of Brett might make this beer sublime."
"Another interesting offering from Allagash. I would have it again but I would choose other examples of the style before Victor."
"Glug, glug, glug. Another?"
"Very nice beer from Allagash. On par with all of their other special releases. Once again, I think this is great due to the fact that it is so subtle. Lots of flavor in there, and quite a bit of complexity, but all without being in you face. Fairly mild all around, yet still very interesting. Very well made and balanced, this one is worth picking up and seeking out."
"D - This drinks incredibly smooth. The best compliment I can say is it drinks like this has been a style for years, not a one off. YES I'll have another!"
"Nice round chewy mouthfeel. Very peppery coupled with ripe pear flavor that persists throughout. A bit buttery midsip and into the finish, where the grape character really comes forth.	Another interesting beer from Allagash. They really seem to be pushing the envelope of what beer is of late. $20 is a bit steep IMO, but I'm glad they're out there trying something new."
"pours a dark murky orangish amber with a big off white head that leaves a thin lace in big clumps all over. aroma is signature allagash - yeasty, spicy, bready and also has some candied sugar... can't really smell the grapes, but they come through just a little when quaffed... i was worried this was going to be an overly fruity beer, but the grapes add a very nice finish that is dry, sweet and earthy... not overly sweet, and earthy in a different sort of way than usual... very subtle... there's actually a lot going on here and a very complex thing is happening... an experiment that reminds me how fun this whole thing is"
"[Follow-up note: The bottle says 9% but the fact sheet from Allagash says 10.4%, decide amongst yourselves.]"
