"Perfect beer tastes great love it."
"Favorite of the style. Comparable to Duvel, but slightly better in taste-not as carbonated, coriander is subtle but evident."

"O - I had forgotten how grand la chouffe was. Boy, am I glad it's showing up in my area these days. An excellent Belgian ale and a pure traditional Belgian classic ranking up there with the great brewers of that part of the world. A must try and it remains one of my all time favorites."

""
""

"I love it!. It´s slightly bitter at the end and doesn´t feel like a beer with 8% ABV"
""
""
"If I could marry this beer, I would."
"I would definitely recommend and go back for more!"

"Gran ejemplo del estilo, es una cerveza visualmente muy atractiva y con un aroma complejo y lleno de frescura, con la marca de la levadura belga. Fácil de beber y placentera, no se nota el grado y tiene un paladar limpio y seco, con gran repertorio de especias y frutas verdes y maduras."

"To start, La Chouffe is simply one of the tastiest looking Belgian ales.  The initial pour yields a big, inviting pure white head, and a hazy near-opaque caramel/orange body.  The smell is very nice - dry caramel, fruity Belgian esthers - although perhaps the aroma isn't as forthright on draught as it is out of the bottle.  The taste is magic though.  Full bodied with crisp carbonation and just enough hop bite.  It's really delicious and easy to drink.  One of my favorite beers of all time.  I sometime think of La Chouffe as a perfect foil to Duvel - a much softer, rounder, less-intense Belgian ale that nonetheless brings a perfect balance of flavor.  It's more playful and sweetly bodied than some Belgian ales, but definitely a serious contender.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of drinking it."

"One of my favorites. Especially in the cooler months"

"Not one of the best Belgium Golden's , but right up there!"
""

"Overall world class beer! Those belgians know how to do it! Literally pair this with anything ... Fancy from lobster to caviar .... Or cheap nice slice of pepperoni pizza. I give it a 97.5/100."

"Quite possibly my favorite of all beers."

"although this beer has 8% ABV it is very easy to drink. but not very aromatic and a bit boring."
""
"Very solid, strong beer with not much kick."
"Little too sweet for my taste.  Not bad though"
""
"mooie kleur en geur maar smaak valt tegen"
"one of the classics. i think this basically defines the genre of belgian strong pale ale. it has all the elements, and is one of the more balanced beers in this style thats out there. a little darker than golden, bright russet colored, with a tall white head that is vintage belgian. the nose is a showcase of this very dynamic yeast, as spice laden as it is fruity, and then bittering hops with a european grassiness. the flavor is quite similar, with a little grain sweetness on the front end before the yeast driven dry finish. carbonation is akin to champagne, and the beer is awfully drinkable and creamy for something thats 8% abv. very uncommon. i kind of always keep this beer in the back of my mind and internally compare all other belgian pales to it. very few stack up to la chouffe."
"Smooth and well made. Light and delicious."

"Won't bother with a full review as that would waste time. The finish here was so sweet it just reminded me of bubblegum. I mean that literally: I got notes of Bazooka Joe and Dubble Bubble here. Matter of fact, the nose and taste were absurdly sweet as well. If you like sweet, yeasty Belgians you will love this, but personally, this is a one and done for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful hazy yellow with a fizzy white head that lasts. The smell is full of bananas with some bread scents coming out too. The taste is light and aromatic like champagne with banana and apple being in the front and then toasted biscuits and a little bit of toffee coming in the end. Very pleasant and a wonderful beer."

"I really enjoyed this one! It's like a meal onto itself. Not a beer to drink on a hot summerday to cool off. Better for warming up in cold weather, with a hearty meal or chocolates. I love Belgian beers so much!!"

"The taste is throughout great, from the beginning there is an intense taste of wheat which leads to a smooth mouthfeel, with a fresh hoppy ending. Some peppers add a necessary contrast to the beer, otherwise it might be too mild. Slight hints of berries going along with the upcoming bitterness in the end, giving the beer a generous complxity."
""
"I have a soft spot for that elf"
""
""

"Complex yet not overwhelming.   A truly pleasant sipper that morphs as it warms. Belies it's abv.  A true global gem. Love it paired with hearty and spicy food."

"Overall – The first time I drank this in 2012 I thought it was too sweet but two years later when I came to review it I found that it had a lot of flavour and real depth to it. Cloudy against the light with tiny hints of matter like clouds floating in the glass (this is a good thing) this beer is fairly typical in appearance for a Belgium blond although it may be cloudier than most I’m used to. To put it another way it is golden like an English sunrise over the Isle of Purbeck in mid-July with noticeable clouds that promise a very good day.  In some ways it resembles a wheat beer. . A cracking beer that I like very much!!"

"Expectation to see if you purchase a bottle of 750 ml, but... Appearance: fun label; the glass cloudy, with ingredients in suspension and color of honey. Aroma: A bit of malt. Taste: refreshing, coriander like Hoegaarden (would not be a Witbier??), prominent malt. Personally I preferred the Duvel; would be the temperature?"

"0.33L bottle poured into a bona fide Brasserie D'Achouffe glass at 1600 Bier Haus in Calgary. A light honey orange color just shy of reddish with a well-formed but quick-breaking creamy white head, this iconic Belgian ""special"" said to defy style guidelines smells like shortbread cookies, orange rind, and white pepper, along buttery sweet yeast and a vinous tannic note like champagne or boozy white grapes. Palate is similarly citric, fruity, and spicy, with a champagne-like undercurrent propping up some woody nectarine or apricot, pepper, fermented rank pineapple, coriander seed, and faint caramel popcorn, nice complexity but very dry and tart, almost an ""imperial witbier"" in character. Well-attenuated body adds to the drying effect, rather smooth and the carbonation and alcohol effects are decidedly mellow. I'd go here again although I prefer some other more funky brews. This one might appeal to the wine drinker closeted somewhere deep in us all."

"The head is nice, thick, and variegated, and of sufficient longevity. The body is  transparent, with a hue of light gold or amber. Caramel or toffee dominates the aroma, perfectly complementing a similarly constituted flavor. Are there hints of fruit? Perhaps--of the full-bodied yellow variety, like ripe peach or mango; but maybe I'm influenced by the beer's color, which seems to deepen with the lowering of the angle of the sun. The texture is mostly silky, with just enough sparkle. If you're looking for something satisfyingly quaffable on the sweet side of the spectrum, you can't go wrong here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm under the impression this isn't one of the ""classic"" Belgian Goldens, but its quite nice and if you feel like spending the cash, probably a good gateway into the style."

"33cl bottle into a goblet. Golden yellow hazy color with one finger head. Fruity smell with citrus, yeast and some honey. The taste was sweet and yeasty with a peppery aftertaste with some coriander that lasted for some time. Nice carbonation and a medium body. Liked it a lot."
"Excellent Belgian ale."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/2016. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, coriander, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast ester, malt, and spice flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"The beautiful body that marks the style is manifested in this one. At once soft and strong, it's incredibly creamy with a soft but even carbonation building lots of smoothness on the palate while offering a nice crispness that never falters. Alcohol doesn't have too strong an effect, and it eases into a semi-dry finish."
""
""
"These gnomes know what they're doing. It's been a while since I had the Houblon Chouffe, but this seems pretty similar, which is a good thing. This is simply one of the best Belgian Pale Ales I've had."

"O: a nice Belgian strong pale ale. I can see why this is such a staple at so many bars around my parts. Nice and easy to drink, I found this beer tasty and enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the smell of this beer, and I found it really added a great deal to the experience."
""
""
"Overall: a brilliant Belgian Strong. I have seen this at Dan Murphy's for a long time and assumed from a distance that it was a cider. I'm glad I bothered to take a closer look - one of the best balanced and most refreshing Belgian Strong Pale Ales I have had to date."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good and textbook example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale with pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style and nothing seemed out of place. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think the prickly carbonation would prevent me from drinking more than one of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and mouthfeel I thought they were both very nice and they were pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but the head retention and lacing were a little weak. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it's good, but it's a little pricey and for around the same price I can get Duvel which I like more than this beer. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style or Belgian beers in general. All in all i was satisfied with this beer, it wasn't the best of the style I have had, but I still thought it was good and I'll be on a look out for more beers from this brewery since this beer made for a good first impression, nice job guys, keep up the good work."

"Great beer. My favorite beers are the strong, sweet dark belgians (St Bernardus, Gouden Caroulus Van de Kaiser Blau on tap, Gulden Draak etc)but this beer is up pretty high on my list even though it is not a dark. I wish it finished without any bitterness at all. This has a stout long lasting 8% alcohol effect on me. Feels more like 13% to me. I will probably be buying this again and may try aging this."
"4 pack of 330 bottle @ 9.99 at TW."

"From my tasting notes: The La Chouffe was a strong Golden Ale in the vein of Duvel that came with a fluffy white head and plenty of belgian yeast notes in the aroma. This was a great tasting beer that was herbal and spicy while being very well balanced and highly drinkable. This is their flagship beer and it was very tasty. Definitely one to revisit."

""
""
"O - Normally, this is a style I very much like, but the aroma turned me off quite a bit, and the heavy finish left this beer a bit less sessionable. Still, it's a good beer and I would recommend it (if I could be assured it wasn't lightstruck somehow...)"
"O - Overall, very enjoyable and drinkable beer, especially in the warmer months. If you like your triples a bit sweeter, this is the way to go. Pretty easily available too, just one of the more pricey triples, as far as the commonly sold ones go."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- This beer is decent, but it really didn't have the depth of flavor I like in Belgian strongs. It wasn't bad, but I don't see myself buying another one for the price I paid."
""
""
""
""
"La Chouffe is just a great all-around Belgian pale. I wish I'd tried it sooner. Flavor and aroma didn't really wow me, but it's solid all-around and available in 4-packs of 330ml."

"I'm really diggin' this brew. Wonderful balance, clean finish. The high ABV was not evident. Refreshing...an all-season ale I could enjoy by the fire in December or on the deck in July. Once again, I will have to re-arrange my Top 5 to include La Chouffe."
""
""

"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers for any situation. Ive had it on tap in Amsterdam, for my first experience. But honestly i almost like it out of the bottle better. Maybe thats an unfair assesment as I haven't had it on tap in years, but regardless this beer will amaze anyone. Its so drinkable that this could convert even non beer drinkers into avid beer snobs. If you love Delirium or Duvel, you need to give this a shot, you'll probably like it even better."

"Overall - An enjoyable beer that was a little bit different than I was expecting. Some nice fruity notes and some spice to balance it out. Not sure I could drink more than 750ml of this in one night though, it's a touch sweet."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer was very enjoyable. Everything from the caramel flavors to the spiciness was a journey. The alcohol would pop up from time to time, which isn't preferable, but there was enough going on that it didn't detract much from the experience. Belgian beer lovers would really enjoy this beer. I highly recommend seeking it out"

"O - This beer was a very pleasant surprise and it can hold its head up with the best of the breed. It isvery clean, well-made and balanced. I consider the appearance to be perfect and the aroma and taste are nearly so, just lacking in depth/complexity to make it the best of the best."
""

"O/D-I enjoyed their Dobbelen more but this one is no slouch. The large bottle will disappear quite quickly. Balanced and well-crafted."

""
"O: A very well brewed artisan beer. Has typical Belgian qualities. Would seem great in the summer months. Glad to have tried, but was expecting a little more complexity."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a classic, of course, a near-perfect representative of its style. Always a pleasure, although it could be more adventurous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall while this is not my favorite of the ""Chouffes"" it is still a quality example of the style and probably one of my favorite of the Belgian Pale Ale category. The Ardennes yeast is less phenolic and estery than many other Belgian yeast strains which makes this much more drinkable and enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I knew I loved the Chouffe and this beer confirmed that for me. Subtle aroma, perfectly integrated flavors, and excellent balance on the mouth. This a beer you could drink a lot of and never get tired of it. A great example of how things don't need to be overdone to be good."

"O: Excellent Belgian brew – one of the best around."
"An orange beer with a fantastic light orange head. The aroma is fantastic: it is malts sweet with notes of alcohol, fruit, oranges, coriander, and cinnamon - a wonderful nose. The flavor too is fantastic - it starts with a nice malts sweetness containing notes of oranges, fruit, coriander, cinnamon, and alcohol. In the end, the alcohol sting your tongue, before it leaves you with a sweetness that lingers on your tongue and lips. It has a very nice palate. This is a great beer."

"Sample I got fizzed quite a bit when I opened the bottle, but not so much that I needed a towel - just had to pour some out before it got messy. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and a bit woody, not strong but still appealing. Pours a nice clear bright solar yellow with a thick and fluffy, if none too persistent, white head. Flavor is better and stronger than what the aroma promised - fruity, malty, a little yeasty with a hint of butterscotch. Must be butterscotch. Texture is firm-bodied and a little syrupy; fizz is not strong but lasts, leaving a nice, fruity, tingly, slightly sweet finish. Worth ten bucks for 750 ml? Definitely."

"Pours a clear straw with a nice fluffy white head that drops to a cap and leaves light lacing. Very nice nose of pepper, straw and hints of barnyard. Body has a fairly strong sweetness at first that later gets overpowered by earthy hop. Nice amount of pepper with notes of apple juice. Overall a fine beer, worth drinking more of."

"O - Pretty good. Drinkability is pretty good. The ABV sure sneaked up on me after 2 bottles."
"Lightly sweet with a pepper kicker in the swallow. Rich body with an above average carbonation. In a word, smooth. Creamy finish with a touch alcohol showing up in the swallow. Very complex."

"I can imagine a Belgian farmer making this his nightly drink. It's suggests to me so strongly of being made on a farm. It's earthy, spicy, and approachable. It's something I could have nightly, but not more than a glass. Where Duvel is delicate and complex, La Chouffe comes across as strong and proud, rigid in its strengths. I'd want this after a hard day's work in the yard. Great stuff."

"I wasn't sure about this one because of the term ""brewed with spice"". That term can mean an infinite amount of stupendous and horrendous things. Too loose a term for me to confidently purchase. But this beer kick ass! Cheers."
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a hazy golden colour, with a decent head that fades quickly, leaving a lace. Smell of papaya, spices, clove, coriander and some others that I can't really tell. Strong body, harsh palate (in a good sense), lots of carbonation. Taste is again spicy, clove, coriander and some that I can't tell, including kind of some fermented fruit and a lemon touch. Dry and spicy aftertaste. It taste like if it had some more alcohol. Great."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber with lots of little floating particle in it, almost like snow. Perhaps too long a pour, but it looked great. Nice thick long lasting off white head and lacing. Nice looking. Belgian fruit aroma. Fruit, malt, sweet malt light spicing. A bit of a dry abrupt finish. Tame, but nice and enjoyable. La Chouffe is an excellent brewery."
"Overall this was a little dissappointing for me. Maybe this is just a bad bottle."

"Pours a hazy deep gold with a three finger brilliant white head. Great retention and abundant lacing as the head recedes. Belgian yeast and spice on the nose. Clove, corainder, and pepper combine with a high effervescent carbonation in slick and light bodied yet satisfying brew. Peach and apricot-like fruitiness surface midpalate. The finish is dry with grassy hops and a bit of spiciness. A top-tier Strong Belgian Pale Ale and a brew that is not to be passed up."

"Bought a bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a white wine glass. Light golden hue with a thick thick white head. Strong hops with a bit of grapefruit and other citrus members in this. The flavor was a bit sour in areas where I don't think it was trying to be sour, but overall, this was a beautiful strong Belgian pale. The gnome on the front of the bottle is cute, too, and definitely adds to the advertising when most beer is trying to be intimidating."

"330ml bottle, poured into large tulip shaped wine glass. Pale golden colour, slight haze which increased, medium thin textured head which was well retained. Aroma was phenol, yeast and clove. Tasted sour fruits and clove, fairly bitter. Finish had a hint of booze, although it didn't dominate the flavour. Decent carbonation, medium body, coarse. Overall good, but not complex enough to be great."

"The texture is 5 stars! Creamy smooth with little bubbles setting up to complement some easy jazz. My first recommendation would be the early 1960s Jimmy Giuffre 3. Miles Davis Kind of Blue era would be a 2nd choice or even pop on an old lp of Grover Washington's Winelight."

"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, fruits, spices, yeast, and some slight banana aromas. Taste is the same with a nice spice finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall: Not sure what was up witht this keg, but this was not a good beer. Tasted old, undercarbonated, underattenuated and maybe even infected. Lots of off-flavours and roughness. Not good."
""
"Overall: I was expecting more. It has been a while since I had La Chouffe, but I thought it would have more body and a more complex flavor profile. Are they tuning this to the Chinese palate? I'll try it again once I return to the States, but this experience was mediocre."
"Two finger frothy head on a dark golden hazy body with nice lacing. Aroma is excellent with a distinct musty floral note with a fruity background. Taste is also on the floral side. The coriander is robust in the one with a semi sweet fruit flavor as well. Medium body and light to moderate carbonation. I enjoyed this one and will get it again."
"Overall: This is a delicious Pale Ale I hope to revisit in the future, well balanced in every aspect."

"Overall - I love how these beers are typically unpasteurized and unfiltered. Definitely my favorite thing about Achouffe's products. After drinking so many Belgian beers (blondes and quads alike), this happens to score pretty low for me, unfortunately. There are certainly a dozen or more blonde ales that are far more complex and superior. However, this is still a delicious treat from time to time. No question about that!"

"the taste follows suit, grassy, earthy, a little oil on the tongue but pretty dry. very spritey hop bitterness, overtones of yeast -- some citrus -- a full feel to the beer, lovely pale malt flavor, ZERO roasted malt or caramel flavor here -- just a perfectly developed pale malt ale. EXCELLENT."

"This is an excellent BSPA - not the most complex or interesting example of the style, but definitely a smooth, tasty, enjoyable one nonetheless. I like Duvel marginally more, but realistically I'd put the two brews on very similar footing - La Chouffe's big bottle makes it better for splitting with friends, though... I can only ever find those stubby Duvel bottles. Great stuff, definitely worth a try if you see it."

"Figured I'd give the store's last bottle of this a good home: mine. It pours a mostly clear gold topped by over a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises heavy Belgian yeast, light white bread, clove, a pinch of black pepper, light lemon peel, a hint of banana peel, and a touch of flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with that heavy yeast character really coming to the fore. This isn't to say that the spices take a full backseat, but they are definitely subservient to the yeast. Lesser beers would suffer from this situation, but this yeast works well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice BSPA, not quite up there with Duvel and the other standard-bearers, but it comes pretty dern close."

"This is a greta brew that would pass for a spectacular hefe. Really could drink this all day, a real pleasant surprise."
"I think it has been know to cure the common cold."
"Pours a light gold color with an off white head. Excellent carbonation, and super sticky lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Somewhat cloudy, but not completely- You can still see the other side of the glass. Smell is fairly fantastic- malt, yeast, spices, tiny bit of farm smell. Really smooth, and very well put together- excellent. Taste is the same profile as the nose with some fruit flavors in there. I'm mainly getting pear... Very nice, and smooth- an easy drinker. None of the 8% ABV shows itself in the taste at all. Feel is medium, w/ a fruit/spice aftertaste. Overall, this is a really enjoyable beer- I would definitely pick this up again. Cheers."
"O - Very good BSPA that I would highly recommend."
"It looks like a light golden, slightly clouded ale, and keeps a strong head."
"On tap at the Encinitas Ale House."
"Overall, a very nice dinner beer, Belgain style"

"O: a great brew, really enjoyed my first foray into this brewery, really a nice golden, so smooth and nicely sweet which is not what i had expected"
"The mouthfeel is medium with fine carbonation. Easy to drink and high alcohol not so noticeable. "
"O- It's good! But it's not my fave Belgian Pale at all."
"O - Enjoyable blond ale."
"While this is slightly spicier than I remember it being on tap, it is still a pleasant and enjoyable ale. Belgian Golden Ale (as the bottle claims this is, and not a BSPA) is a style I'm not terribly familiar with, and is one that I've been nervous about getting to learn about, since Belgian Ales generally have an air of the mysterious to them. This is a tasty BGA, though, and you should try if you can find it."
"O: a disappointment; I have promised myself never be trapped again by the look of the little hobbit - unless it is the great Houblon Chouffe."
"0- Not my favorite of the style, but worth a try."
"This is a fabulous beer. Very easy to drink because it tastes so good."
"The mouth starts with a mouth of carbonation iit becomes malty sweet and the belgian yeasts comes and drys the palet and makes a slight bitter"
"It's been a long time since I've had this beer. What a delicious brew. I am so glad that I revisited La Chouffe. I will make a point to have this around and enjoy it more often."
"Poured a golden brown, with a huge dense white head; persistent and creamy with a great thickness. Exceptional lace, even considering the serving vessel. Nose has some light pear and green apple in restraint. Sweet malts overshadow some subdued spicy and pepper like qualities. Taste is sweet with some mild caramel-like qualities. Peppery notes are enhanced by a vibrant carbonation, which is active but not overpowering. Hints of alcohol and some mild herbal qualities (Euro-hops surely, but I can't decipher them). Good warmth from the alcohol, with a medium heavy feel. A solid Belgian strong, sharing this was the best option however."
"O: Very enjoyable, a perfect evening sipper. The alcohol has a nice warming effect"
"Drank this really good Belgian strong ale at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY. They served this ale in a brandy snifter glass with a nice creamy white head and a slightly hazy golden color.  It has notes of raisins, caramel, and spices on the nose.  Once it hits the mouth the creamy tastes of raisins, and plums leave a clean finish."
"This brew poured out with a nice golden color, the head was thick and white. The lacing was minimal but had a decent retention to it. The smell of the beer was slightly sweet, some grains on the nose and plenty of earthy hops and yeast. The taste of this beer is nicely balanced, grains and malts upfront that fade into a more dry and earthy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth and drinkable. Overall this beer is quite good, and would drink this along with any of the other Chouffe brews out there again."
"Overall a superb beer and one I would highly recommend."
"Overall it hits the spot for my sweet, yeasty, belgian beer jonesin!"
"O: A very drinkable beer and one of the best representations of the style I have come across. An excellent beer."
"Poured an opaque golden/ yellow color with two finger head, some lacing. Smells of spice (cloves), yeast, and pears/ grapes. Flavor is of light fruits and spices. Mouth feel is nicely carbonated and a little thick. A great beer that is worth seeking out."
"O: This is a highly drinkable brew. The alcohol is very well hidden. Lots of taste and inviting scent. Would certainly reach for this again and again. Better for a nice cool fall evening."
"It had a very smooth taste and was very easy to drink. One of the nicer Belgian Strong Ales I've had. I look forward to trying a few of d'Achouffe's other beers."
"This is a great all-weather beer. Quenching enough to be nice on a patio, but hearty enough to hold up to cooler weather. An amazing all-rounder! Couldn't recommend this more: if you see it drink it!"
"O - Surprised it took this long for me to try, but this is a very enjoyable belgian pale. Worth seeking out."
"O. Just a little too sweet for my palate. Otherwise a very nice Belgian pale ale and well worth the outlay."
"Overall: a pretty good strong blonde ale, which is a style I'm not a big fan of generally. Its worth trying. Cheers!"
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a very hazy orange with a creamy head that lingers and leaves some nice lacing. Smells of banana and cloves, candi sugar, and some firm malt. Fairly classic aromas, but nothing mindblowing. Tastes sharp and a little bit sweet up front, then slightly grainy, and quite spicy on the finish. Not very well integrated, so the flavors don't meld seamlessly like they do in the best strong Belgian style beers. Fairly creamy in the mouth, but with a sharpness on the fore palate. Pleasant enough, but there are so many other choices I'd probably head to first."
"D: I don't care for the drinkability of it, way too bubbly and the flavor isn't to my liking."
"This beer pours a golden color, with a nice large white head. The smell is full of spices, and subtle alchool smell can be detected. The taste is very full, lots of belgin spices, a small amount of alchool can be detected in the flavor as well. Good strong flavor and very nice carbonation. Overall a Fantastic beer, a must try."
"O: This was a great experience, I much prefered this on tap vs bottle. Very well done belgian strong pale, would order again."
"Carbonation is a bit too high."
"Overall It was effortless to sip. Gave a really good pop once it hit your palate and kept itself feeling vibrant throughout the session."
"The CPJ"
"Cloudy yellow-orange in colour. Massive cream coloured head is tight and dense, well retained, and completely coats the walls of my glass in lace. Smells of orchard fruit, lemon peel, doughy malt, and flowers. Estery fruit flavour imitates peaches and bananas. There's residual sweetness from the malt. It has a nice lemony acidity and peppery spice, and finishes with a delicate bubblegum flavour. Medium bodied with abundant fine carbonation. Feels velvet and mousse-like. The carbonation is champagne like. La Chouffe is a fantastic beer with well-integrated flavours and a wonderful mouthfeel. It looks good in the glass too. It truly is a pleasure for all five senses."
"O- All in all a great beer. Only I find the flavours a bit ''disconnected''. Almost feels like pure alcohol was added after fermentation. If the alcohol and cardboard were in check, I'd probably be in love with this beer."
"O: Very nice beer. 4"
"I will try another if I find one that is well kept."
"O- im not usually a big fan of belgian strong pale ales, but i did really enjoy this one. i can definitely see myself having this again sometime in the near future. check this one out if you like the style."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer despite the lightstruck/skunky character. It has a nice balance between malts, hops and yeast character that is complimented well by a subtle coriander accent."
"Drinkability – This is a great golden ale. Lots of subtleties from the spice and peppery notes from the yeast. Drinkability is high, which is the sign of a well built beer at this ABV."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Sweet and full of blast of fresh fruit. The Belgian yeast is not overpowering, which I like. Easy to drink and fairly light bodied. Refreshing and"
"O - Amazing beer. After returning to it much later, I finally appreciate the complex flavor and composition. One of the best in this category and a great beer all around. Highly recommended."
"Overall: I live in Germany, and can't bring myself to tell my German friends that I think the Belgians just make better beer across the board. This is a wonderful example, if not my very favorite, BPSA."
"Drink- Overall a well done beer. The dry yeasty flavor will keep me coming back to this one."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Cakman2 has talked this up to me for weeks and I'm glad I finally got to try it. I'm picking up a bottle next week."
"D- Decent complexity and drinkability though it appears to me that quality and overall feel have somehow gone down with time. This is why i decided to edit this review. My recent tries were all disappointing if compared to the ones i had years ago"
"This seems like a good example of a Belgian Strong. It didn't really surprise me at all with its taste."
"Overall - A good beer but ive had better. This is a safe and mellow bsa, not what i look for in this style. Unibrowe makes a far better bsa as does chimay. This aint bad but theres alot better ones out there. A good beginner bsa."
"Carbonation is so fine and rich in every way. Can get a bit much after a full glass as the chalkiness plus the big-time body is a large load, but I'd rather have this than a less flavorful beer. Drinkability is really great for the mouthfeel and taste: it's tough to keep something like this easy to drink from start to finish, but that's precisely what this beer is. Phenomenal."
"D: awesome BSPA I will be buying again."
"Lightly bittered with a dry feel and high carbonation more reminiscent of a saison than a typical golden ale. Faint peppery flavor and initial sweetness to a malty balanced finish with little alcohol heat evident. Medium light body and dryness make this easy to drink for a bigger beer."
"Poured a hazy amber-orange that had floating particles of yeast with an average sized white creamy head that almost lasted throughout and had good lacing. The aroma was light of a staw like malt, grassy hops and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of orange, pineapple and corriander with a slight hint of alcohol. It tasted very lightly sweet at first and then had a light bitter fruity flavor with a hints of spices and alcohol at the finish with the flavor lasting an average amount of time. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a very soft carbonation. Overall a nice and tasty Belguim Ale that is quite drinkable."
"So good. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"Dr: It's got a pretty steep price, but it's a good beer for fans of the style to try. It's too light for a stout lover like me, but it's a good example of the style and certainly worth a go for any beer fanatic."
"Drinkability: A thoroughly enjoyable Belgian brew- would love to have again."
"D: I enjoyed this brew, although there a lot of very good BSPAs out there. A little less heat, and this one would have been right there with them."
"Poured straight from the bottle into my Unibroue tulip...again, and again and again until said bottle was empty. A good hazy orange in color with a small layer of foam, which disappears leaving a thin lacing along the top. Great taste, good mouthfeel. It's Belgian, haven't found a bad one yet."
"Overall, no gripes with this ale. But given all the choices of Belgian strongs, I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it."
"I ordered a pint of this while ordering at Stuff Yer Face eatery in Brunswick, NJ near Rutgers campus, and finished it by the time the main course arrived. Nice golden ale, looks awesome in the glass. Very smooth with a light fruit after taste. I'd definitely seek this out again."
"Drinkability: A wonderful beer to enjoy for the evening while watching a movie."
"Overall: very refreshing despite the 8% alc. volume. In my opinion not top of the notch of Belgian beers but quite enjoyable. Worth a try."
"D: medium plus"
"D: Drinkable, although I think the bitter skunk to the hops warns the drinker not to chug freely. Did pair nicely with my dinner. A good beer but not one i'd gush over."
"Drink - Very alcoholic but not particularly heavy, so I can't quite make the call"
"Dusty golden colors with nice thick pure white topper. Smells citrusy and sweet, with malty nose appeal. A great take on belgium ale; apples, pears, lemons, apricot and orange flavors nustle their way thru a carbonated full bodied swig. Very smooth and memorable, enjoyable and timeless beer."
"D - oh yes! So so drinkable, will be drinking this alot, for a long long time."
"A prototypical Belgian pale ale - grainy, moderately sweet, and the rest of the standard spice and booze elements very well integrated into the whole. Careful you don't trip over that oblivious little elf while polishing off this sneaky offering."
"Pours a hazy copper yellow color with a medium, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is of citrus fruits and slight herbal, spruce hint. Taste is tropical citrus like pineapple and banana on the front end with a definite herbal hop flavor following into the middle. Finishing is grassy and herbal hops. The beer is a little oily on the palate but has a nice medium body."
"D: Very flavorful er which goes down fairly smooth. Would definitely purchase again although I wish it could be purchase in a smaller bottle from the LCBO."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light to medium bodied, nice spicy finish. All around a very delicious beer and good flavors that blend together seamlessly. So far my favorite beer from brewery Achouffe."
"Highly carbonated yet smooth mouthfeel. No hint of the 8% at all. Taste lingers on your palate for quite a while. Very easy drinking, dare I say, refreshing beer. It's January in Maine, but I could easily put down a couple of these in the summer."
"Dry, crisp finish."
"Drinkability - very drinkable especially for the abv. An interesting brew well worth a try, combines two of my favorite styles successfully."
"Pours a very hazy, light orange with a big bold head. Head is thick like Texas toast. Plenty of carbonation. Smells surprisingly peppery, yet pleasant. Bit like spiced fruit. Some malts, pears, and hoppy citrus. Flavours are very light and sweet. Bananas, pears, bit of orange, bit of citrus, and bold pepper. With all the pepper, one would think this beer unpleasant, but it surprisingly works. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, reminding me a bit of champagne. So much so that, for New Years, I served this and people thought it was a style of champagne. They were, however, a tad drunk. Definitely a beer to enjoy and savour all the flavours and aromas. Drink it cool and let it warm, so that the subtle complexities shine through."
"d- good, it'd easily pick one of these up when i'm in that rare mood for a belgian, one of the better belgians that i've had easily! also gotta love the adorable chouffe!"
"Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a good white head. Very bubbly. The nose is banana, pear, and spice with a bit of creaminess. Really soft and mellow with a bit of a light buttery, chardonnay-esque character. The taste is pretty similar with over-ripe pear and spicing really standing out. The feel is nice--medium body with good carbonation and a good creamy feel to it. This drinks quite well and works nicely with turkey and accompaniments."
"Pours a golden orange with thick white head. Really nice head retention, as it dissipates to leaving a finger or 2 still. Lots of lacing down the glass. Smells more of hops than I was expecting, with banana and Belgian yeast. Quite a dry, sweet flavour with some mild bitterness. Really delicious. Medium bodied carbonation. An extremely nice Belgian ale."
"Excellent offering from La d'Achouffe."
"Pours a cloudy orangey-gold color with a minimum of head. Smells yeasty, spicy and a little fruity. The taste is very sweet and yeasty with some banana, but is surprisingly light. Not much in the way of hops. Mouthfeel is very creamy and light, very nice. Overall, a very drinkable beer, especially for a belgian ale."
"This is something I'd like to have again. Preferably in greater quantities. Very nice."
"My friend and I go to a place called growlers pub and have 2 of these and it produces a truly mellow buzz. I highly recommend this beer for it's distinctiveness and overall drinkability."
"Overall there is the little problem that the style which it is made to be, a stong belgian pale ale, is clearly not the only style the brewer had in mind, in some ways it reflects more similarities to a tripel, which presuming it is not, seems strange and inclines me to choose something like Duvel or La Fin du Monde over La Chouffe because they know which style they are and are a similar price."
"D - A beer to savour and trumps the Duvel for me."
"O: This one differs from the standard super-dry Belgian Strong (think Duvel) in that it is sweeter and fruitier. I wouldn't say one is better than the other. Both have their charms. If you want a sweeter and fruitier beer, this is for you. Sometimes might seem cloying."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Pale golden colour with a thick white head that looked like whipped cream and stuck to the glass instantly. Smells of spicy yeast, hints of citrus fruit with a medicinal candy sweetness. Taste is bready with a candy apple sweetness that finishes long there is also a slight alcohol presence here. Nice medium mouthfeel with a great carbonation that was very enjoyable. Drinks really, really well. After one 750 I wanted another this is one of my new favorites."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and slightly dry. Drinkability scores well."
"Slightly hazy deep golden brew with a big frothy white head that recedes relatively quickly (by Belgian standards), leaving sporadic lacing. Nose is very clean - grain, apple cider, hint of some sort of spice, white grape, and bubblegum. Taste is surprisingly big on bready malt, along with a good dose of spice and belgian yeast. Not as fruity/citrusy as expected. There is an iron-like metallic tinge that lingers throughout. Finish is slightly sweet but still pretty crisp. Medium-bodied, effervescent. Overall, I enjoyed it, but the lingering somewhat metallic taste distracted me, and will probably prevent me from picking up anymore of this, especially since other solid representations of the same style (i.e. Duvel) are much cheaper in the province."
"Taste is lightly winey dough, fruit, an interesting fruity-woody-herbal character that is hard to pin down, plus hint of banana cream pie and cream. It has some light complexity. It's lightly sweet up front with light bitterness that is more prominent in the finish and aftertaste, but takes a back seat to the slightly stronger light sweetness. It's very good and has a feel that is lightly creamy but also has some slight liveliness."
"I found this very similar to Duvel, both are great beers and very tasty."
"I've ordered it on two different occasions so it's got to be good."
"This beer pours a light, golden color with about a finger and a half of head which fades quicker than you would expect but does leave some nice lacing. The aroma has notes of berries and spice with a rather strong metallic smell. Soft fruits, like pear and apple, dominate the front of the tongue with a spicier finish. A slight hop presence shows itself on the back of the tongue."
"D-eh...the taste..it dwindles. not my favorite belgian strong pale ale that i've had. the abv hits somewhat but its not that bad."
"Pours a nice golden colour with a large amount of head in the duvel tulip. Tastes quite sweet with a dark fruit taste lingering in there as well. Drinks down pretty smooth for the 8% abv, but the sweetness factor to this makes it hard to finish off an entire 750ml bottle. Decent belgian pale ale though."
"Very nice beer over all quite drinkable but I had big exceptions and it didn't quite get there."
"Its beauty lies in its subtlety. It takes time to pick out each note and figure out whats going on, what flavours bounce off and compliment eachother, and how well rounded it is in the end. Its 750ml size allows and invites you to take your time and appreciate all of this. A fantastic seasonal release from this already great seasonal LCBO lineup. Worth its price and worth the time to appreciate this golden Belgian ale."
"A tasty Belgian strong ale, a great sipper for a quiet night in. A sweeter, gnome-ier version of Fin du Monde (or more accurately, Fin du Monde is a drier, less-gnomed version of La Chouffe.) Worth a pickup, despite the slightly high price point (at least in Ontario)."
"Not particularly impressive, but easy enough to put a glass away."
"Hints of coriander with a pleasant alcohol kick to it. Limited head and carbonation, outstanding flavour, a much better choice than a run-of-the-mill beer like Leffe Blonde (which I won't buy) - this one's a keeper."
"D: Really good for an 8% sleeper. Nothing overpowering to turn this in to a one-and-done for the evening."
"Cheers"
"D - A rock solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale and another excellent offering from Brasserie d'Achouffe... A sophisticated offering and amongst the finer Belgian ales... This one gets my seal of approval and is something that I'll gladly welcome in my cellar anytime..."
"D: Good. A beer to be enjoyed"
"D- Funny thing is the style is called Belgian Strong Pale Ale. This is true for ABV only. It's extremely drinkable, and actually pretty light tasting. A very good beer, with great balance and good detail, but didn't have too much kick to really blow me away. Memorable as a great beer, but a light one at the same time."
"D: Nicely hidden alcohol, very drinkable. Wish I'd found this one sooner!"
"D: A combination of a light body and fairly well masked alcohol make this beer go down quicker than the strength would recommend. A nice accompaniment to a cool October evening."
"D - Very tasty strong belgian. Although the higher ABV does come through, it is not offensive. The flavours are nicely rounded and it goes down smooth. I was very pleased with this one, and would definitely try it again."
"D - High considering the ABV. Nothing offensive is present and the flavors are pleasant."
"This was great. I loved the spice and the overall flavor. I really wanna get my hands on more of this."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy bronze color with a 1/2 inch head and considerable floating debris. Smell is of spices and fruits. Taste is good, fruits and spices are present, lots of flavor here. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"D: I believe this one is drinkable, lads. Yes I do."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, heavily carbonated, and bone dry on the finish. Definately a champaigne of beers. Someone should send Miller a bottle or two."
"Not a perfect Belgian Golden Ale, but definitely a very good beer."
"D - not so much a complex beer as a sharply contrasting beer. Drinkable but not as memorable as I'd like."
"D A very good drinking beer that hides its alcohol very well. Crisp and refreshing."
"This is a favorite in Antwerp, which says something since it rises above many of the great beers available."
"The gnome on the bottle doesn't lie, you will be admiring this beer once you get it into the glass, and enjoy it once you take your first sips."
"when the glass was empty the lace trailings were wonderful"
"Thank goodness for the inspirational gnomes of the Ardennes."
"d - A very solid Belgian. Lots of spice in the smell and a nice fruity, Belgian yeast mox in the taste. Fews smaller than 8%, will definitely have this beer again."
"Paired with fish meat and italian cheese."
"Medium body and low carbonation. Drinkability is good but for the high ABV."
"D: I really liked this one. New meets old. Demonstrative of the style as a whole while packing the flavors and spicy notes that you would expect of a modern craft brewery. Very drinkable but a bit like liquid bread--one bottle was more than enough for one sitting."
"Alright. a quick review here....cloudy pale gold with some sediment. Nice head, light carbonation. Citrusy with some metallic notes in the aroma. Flavor is good - still a little metallic tasting, nice spice however. 8% ABV, and you can taste the alcohol to an extent. Maybe a bad bottle?? Kind of a typical blond and maybe not even that good. Disappointing."
"Roasted pork loin with dried fruit and spices."
"OVERALL: A very solid strong pale ale. The flavors and aromas could have been a little bolder, and the palate a little creamier, but this was a very solid effort for sure, and one I wouldn't hesitate to have again."
"La Chouffe is a super lively, slightly hazy golden with lots of floaters. It has a huge, fluffy, white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a warm aroma of spice, fruit, bread and phenol. It's pretty light bodied and very smooth. The finish is clean, dry and delicate. Wow, it tastes fruity! I detect apple, pear, peach, cherry and maybe some dried fruit. The finish is earthy, leathery, peppery and phenolic. This beer is a treat! This would be just as appropriate on a hot summer day or a cold winter night."
"Into a tulip glass, poured a cloudy golden-yellow, with two fingers of white head; great retention and lacing. Smelled of coriander orange peel, bubble gum, sugar, and apricot. The taste revealed all of the above, with an excellent sense of balance, dissolving to an apricot/peel finish. Medium-bodied and more carbonated than expected; made for a nice sensation. Great beer."
"Overall/notes: I love my Belgian beers, and this is another well-executed one. Perhaps not on the same level as Duvel, but jeez, I won't hold that against it. Drinking this was a good, enjoyable experience."
"Yummy. This beer is a feast fir the eyes and nose as well as the mouth. I think I had their Christmas beer and I liked it a lot as well."
"Drinkability is OK to god, as this brew has all of the makings of a really great beer but comes up litte short in flavor."
"D: A relatively robust 8% ABV will almost certainly hurt drinkability of any beer. But the yeasty finish, more commonly found in Saisons and farmhouse ales, also hurts the drinkabilty. This is a sipper, for sure, but also not as great as most folks think. Not bad, but there are superior BSA's out there in comparison to this one. (Delirium Tremens, Duvel, Don De Dieu to name a few)"
"A very easy to drink beer. Lots of flavour and I certainly don't notice the 8% alcohol."
"Overall, in my opinion, this beer is overrated. It's average to me. I wouldn't buy it again, especially for $10 for the 25oz bottle."
"D- Well balanced and smooth. Nice representation of the style. I wouldn't of known the coriander was added if it wasn't on the bottle, but the spice notes were there. I would drink it again, but not something I would pick up often."
"D: Smooth, light flavors, nothing harsh. Easy drinking."
"pours a hazy golden well carbonated ale color with a billowing pure white head that does settle to a very white nice ring..the smell is floral and spicy with coriander,lemon pepper and some musty peat smells throw in some apples and pears its a bouquet of fruit..the taste is the same and more it has the yeast taste followed by bananas and apples with pepper and citrus really well balanced and a delight to drink on a warm spring day..the mouth feel is perfect medium well carbonated and just right on the taste buds..this is a real drinkable..cheers to the chouffes (gnomes)..a beautiful BSPA"
"D: Decent Belgian beer, but it didn't stand out to me as anything being very distinctive or outstanding. Somewhat light and refreshing despite the 8% ABV."
"Will be paying a visit to this brewery later this year.. can I review this same beer on tap as well?!?!"
"Drinkability: I think the key is balanance here. Harmony between the hops and the malt. I could drink this all day long."
"D - Drank a decent amount of it, but couldn't finish the entire bottle. Unusual for me when I drink."
"Taste is much like the nose, but with more hoppy bitterness. Light medium body, somewhat refreshing, but carbonation is a bit too prevalent, and doesnt support the flavor. Alcohol is well hidden, and definitely a crisp beer for the ABV."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Easy on the Palate while packing a huge amount of flavor. Great carbonation and very refreshing."
"D: This beer is a good sipper yet is also refreshing at the same time."
"Thanks to Jian for sharing this bottle!"
"I'm starting to learn that I think I like the zestyness of the american interpretation of belgian beers rather than the originals."
"Overall, really went well with the meal. Some of my guests are more fans of wine than beer, but also enjoyed the beverage. Very unfortunate that these bottles are hard to come by where I am."
"Second with David ""The Gnome"" i drink, but this time is blonde, served in a tulip glass ""Duvel"". Looks: Orange amber color, thick head of long-lasting foam, very good lacing, many sediments. Smell: Floral hops, coriander and sugars. Taste: Biscuity malts, pine and floral hops, coriander and sugar glass, pretty much like the smell. Mouthfeel: Dry, extra bitter with a bittersweet finish, robust and thick body, hardly feels its 8 degrees of alcohol. Drinkability: Very good beer with coriander and sugar, i enjoyed a lot with fillet fish."
"It was a pleasure to drink this beer. Reasonable carbonation with a good mouthfeel."
"Served this in a tulip glass."
"Drinkability: Could do probably two of this size as it does go down easy but 8% abv needs some caution but rather masked making it seem a lot less."
"Notes: Solid offering and good example of the style. Lots of flavors that go well together. Up towards the top for the style, not as good as Duvel, but Duvel sets quite a high bar to exceed. Definitely give it a try if you can."
"O : With out a doubt one of my favourite Belgium ales with all its qualities shining through. A wondeful well balanced complex beer that is a must to try."
"Decent carbonation and medium body make this one very easy to drink. I cannot believe I found this on tap. Fantastic beer."
"A great smooth finish that leaves your palate dry and crisp and wanting more. An excellent Belgian beer."
"Very drinkable for a beer of this strength. The combination of the delicate (light) flavour with the smoothness and dry finish work well. I find Duvel and Delirium Tremens more interesting but I definitely find this more drinkable."
"A cold bottle of La Chouffe on a sunny summer day would probably be just about the best thing ever. This is one of the smoothest, most refreshing Belgian blonds I've ever had."
"Body is medium to thin, nice carbonation in the mouth prop up an otherwise thin body. There is no aftertaste and the beer finishes nicely. There is minimal bitterness and a really nice fruity palate in the midpalate. Drinkability is high and so is mouthfeel. A really good beer, I would drink it again."
"Mouthfeel was a bit dead in the mouth. Medium to light bodied."
"Quite possibly my favorite beer. Period."
"D: one bottle big bottle is enough, but it went down with ease this beer is balanced, perfectly. absolutely delicious."
"Very good overall."
"Balanced, with some different hopping for this style. Easy to drink; which in this case also means not too challenging."
"D - Nice but would tire easily."
"One of my favorite, easy drinking Belgian ales."
"Overall - great beer, very well done and would love to taste again."
"Notes: Hmmm, not being a big fan of the style I fear I really do not enjoy it as much as it may deserve what seems a good brew, if a bit trite for the the style. It is well crafted, matches well common expectations for a golden ale, but there is little else that entices me to repeat when having other choices around."
"Cloudy golden hue with a super creamy eggwhite head. Lots of clove and spice on the nose and palate with hints of cinnamon and a little pepper. Has an Lemony Peach taste with a light hoppiness at the finish. Lots of carbonation that works so well with the complex flavour, it simply bursts in the mouth! The reasonable ABV means this shouldn't be a session beer but I can drink La Chouffe all night!"
"A very appealing Belgian ale. Plenty of complexity, but with an overall soft impression."
"This is the 'gnome' to purchase and sample...not that I could tell them apart. Good ale."
"Extra 1/2 mark awarded for taste in reflection."
"Reviewed from my notes. Poured from a bottle into a Le Chouffe goblet. It's a golden orange beer with a thin white head. It's translucent and has lots of carbonation bubbles visible within. It has a very nice earthy yeast aroma; there may be a hint of fruit in it as well. It has a great grassy, wheat like taste. There is a hint of alcohol in the finish. It's spiced to perfection. It has a heavier body than I expected, and a plenty of carbonation. It's a bit strong, but very good to drink. An excellent beer."
"Pours as a slightly hazy burnt yellow colour with a big fluffy white head and massive amount of carbonation. Huge malty aroma with classic Belgian yeast, fresh bread, and a slightly medicinal edge. The first flavours that hit you are malty, with lots of grainy cereal, this is followed by a nice warming alcohol feel, which lasts throughout. There is a definite taste of spice, hints of pepper and a gentle sweet sugar. It is definitely on the heavy side and the carbonation is huge in the mouth. Really like the flavours in this, they help to make this very drinkable considering the high ABV."
"Value: Not sure, as this was a gift. What a great one!"
" D-- 8%?? Really? Never would think that. Goes down well and is very refreshing. Very well balanced and is usually a couple of dollars cheaper than Duvel is here in Sydney. That is big here when good beer is expensive. One 750 is more than suitable. Not as good as Duvel is but a good second and a good alternative."
"It's a solid beer, but I can't grab onto anything special about the Gnome."
"Cheers!"
"D: Good example of the style. Could drink this all day."
"Enjoyable and refreshing. I've had this a few times, and it seems like it tastes best in its namesake glass...of course it's probably entirely psychological."
"Peach-colored golden, malty and fruity nose with citrus dominance returning bitter in taste. This is indeed spicy (coriander is the only spice used) and Saaz hops, fairly present, in fact a very dry beer. As and when the tasting, citrus flavors quickly become tough and dry. In my opinion, it lacks a little character and body to beer to win."
"(D)- A solid beer that has some good things going for it. A tad too much carbonation for my taste, but otherwise a nice crisp beer."
"Pure gold with a brilliant ray of orange shining through where the light hits. A fluffy two-fingers of white head dissipates quickly, leaving small groups of foam behind. Aroma is big, with coriander, a bit of fruit and citrus, malts, and a slightly funky yeast, which all rise together giving the nose a real treat. Fruity, spicy and malty on the palate, with a subtle, but near perfect hop bite at the end. More yeast, some sweetness (perhaps butterscotch) and a squirt of lemon finish it all up. Goes down smooth and almost creamy at first, but ends dry with a perfect amount of alcohol heat meandering down the back of the throat. One of the finest Belgian Strong Pale Ale's I've had, and that's saying quite a bit."
"D:A good beer, but the spices need to be put on a leash."
"Drinkability: for me, extremely drinkable. If I had another bottle I'm sure I'd drink it too despite the high ABV."
"D - Very smooth for 8% abv. Nice and complex as it warms."
"D - Very high. ABV isnt felt as much but could be sneaky."
"Opinion: This is a really good tasting and crafted beer. About my only thing is that I wish that the floaters stayed put, that always turns me off, but otherwise and excellent beer and I am not one that is big on spicy beers. My allergies are a little messed up right now, so I wouldn't mind trying the beer again with a fresher palate."
"I've now tried all the beers available from this brewer where I live in Calgary 3 in total. I wish there was more because they seem to brew some good stuff."
"D - There are high alcohol beers that you sip and drink slowly and then there are ones that someone still come across as refreshing. This one is refreshing even at 8% ABV, the spicy, dry finish makes this a refreshing and great beer to enjoy."
"Edit: Had a 3-4 year old vintage recently, it was still great but beginning to decline. I would recommend this one fresh."
"D: Quite easy to drink, though it's well above a sessionable ABV at 8%."
"Fluffly pils malt up front with a big, wet, fruity finish accented by light coriander citrus. Light and springy, hides 8% abv very well."
"I expect that I will top up the Xmas fridge with a couple of these."
"D - Very easy to drink don't even notice the 8% abv good taste worth picking up sometime to try"
"Nostalgia aside, this is still a pleasant example of the style - though I expect their IPA plays even more to the strength of the brewery elves..."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid example of the style. I certainly wouldn't say it does anything for me to separate itself from the pack, but it's still a well-put-together brew that I would gladly have again."
"This is a good beer. If you like Duvel (which I do) than this is for you. Something that is worth a try."
"Pours a clowdy straw yellow with a thin lace of white head. Doesn't display much retension. Aroma slightly sulfuric and yeasty. Medium to high amount of carb and a medium feel. Taste is slightly tart with a bit of yeast. Crisp finish has little to no malt sweetness or hop bitterness. Feel and carb is reminding me of champagne. As it warms clove appears in both taste and nose and a bit more sweetness."
"Its hard to fault La Chouffe, though it is pretty boilerplate for a Belgian Strong Pale. Sometimes, though, you just need a beer that adheres to the style guidelines and delivers on what its should do. I'd happily revisit this gem again."
"Not an over-the-top Belgian pale by any means, more delicate and refined. Light fruity esters of pear and apple dance with a light lemon, hints of light summer grains and hay, sparkly carbonation with a light dry and refreshing finish. Drinkable and refreshing in boatloads. Cheers Rob!"
"I tried this at Cafe Belgique in Amsterdam. It was a nice beer, very drinkable, but nothing too special or unique about it. I have trouble even thinking of what to compare it to, because it wasn't too memorable. I think this could go well with or without a meal. If you have a chance and like pale ales, try it. Otherwise, I'd recommend their dark ale (McChouffe) which was fantastic."
"The mouthfeel is nice, medium body with high carbonation, alcohol is not present, which results in good drinkability so long as one does not mind being drunk quickly."
"MF&D - some thing doesnt feel right, maybe the brew is too slick or there is a weird proportion of carbonation to body thickness. I dont know. I think it lacks a crisp carbonation; there are plenty of bubbles, they are just dull."
"Drinkability: Easily likable, and easily drinkable (at least in the 11.2 ounce format), it's a tasty, well-fortified Belgian blonde."
"D- Goes down easily. Very drinkable for an 8% beer. I had the whole 750ml bottle to myself and enjoyed it quite a lot! Highly recommended."
"The only bad thing I could say about this beer, is that it lost it's good taste, during and after my meal. I drank it with beef, and it totally spoiled the great taste. I will be drinking this again, just not with a meal!"
"M- Smooth as silk, goes down like a glass of apple cider. They got this one right. I'll be picking up some more of this on my next trip to my favorite beer store."
"This poured a clear gold with fluffy white head. It smelled like wild spicy yeast, with earthy caramel and some banana and nutty malt. It tasted like light wild yeast and sweet honey and Belgian sugar, with a bit of waxy hops and light caramel. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good beer with a super clean taste, although not a ton of depth or complexity. It had decent body, but the carbonation never died down like it usually does with bottle conditioned ales. It was very delicate but still hid the alcohol pretty well, so it was very easy to drink. Good beer, but I ended up somewhat bored half way through the bottle."
"Super-earthy with lots of depth, La Chouffe has always delivered the goods, and this bottle/year is no different. Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum. Yum."
"Drinkability: Love this beer. Would rate it as one of my favorite BSPA's, and I've had it on several occasions. Always a pleasure."
"Overall, i've had this on tap and thought it was much better, but this time I wasn't overly impressed."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another on the same night. The flavor profiles in this are not complex but each component makes it enjoyable."
"Drinkability: La Chouffe is definitely a tasty BSPA. A complex aroma and above average flavor and mouthfeel makes this beer worth a try if you haven't drank it before. Drinkability is pretty good, even with the 8% ABV. Personally, if Duvel or Don de Dieu is available in your area, I'd go with one of those instead of this beer. Cheers!"
"Altogether a good BSPA and full of character."
"The bottle features a cartoon of a gnome and has some background on the brewery. It was poured into a Affligem goblet. Its appearance is a golden tone with a small white head, which will quickly fade to a ring. The smell of La Chouffe comprises citrus, pepper, and sugar. The taste has some more of the light citrus fruit, spice, and some light hops come into play. Its mouthfeel is delightful, with a nice balance of honey, pepper, yeast, some other flavors. Drinkability is very much there, especially considering the 8% abv. It had been perhaps a year or so since I last drank La Chouffe and boy was I depriving myself. This is a great belgian strong pale ale."
"D - Quite drinkable despite the high ABV%."
"Very good belgian ale. Pricy but worth it every once in a while."
"drinkability: overall a decent belgan and I would try again"
"Pale orange/amber, huge white head of tiny bubbles that are gone very quickly. Smells of orange peel, corriander, hints of clove, candi sugar, dusty roads on a hot day. Tastes, well, not like that. Interesting. Big malt backbone - you get the sweet and rich hit as you swallow it. Corriander, yeah, I see it. Hints of star anise. Reminds me that I left a tool on at work when I left, today. Bummer. I hope it's OK in the AM. Anyway, interesting. There's some over-extraction astringency going on in here - typical for the style. A little fizzy tingle to the mouth - again, pretty typical for the style. Not bad."
"If you cant get a duvel, and are dying for a draft beer, this is the best of the strong belgian pales that's not a duvel. Worth getting at any bar and and easy drinker even with the elevated alcohol by volume. Would recommend most anytime you see on tap."
"Overall - Phenomenal ale. This is probably the best Belgian ale I've had to date"
"Great beer. I think it's sexy, I want it's body, and i'm letting you know. I hope this beer dates and impregnates many models well into it's golden years."
"The weekly beer run to SWAM (Shiroma's Wine and More)reviled this fine beer. The head is tall & airy and sticks around for a while. First thing you notice when you hold it up to light is the particles of yeast swirling around. This should help to keep those ""sip stealers"" away. The color is orange-ish, with an unfiltered look. Smell great, spice & fruit. The taste is great, fresh but not lacking in flavor. If not for the price you could sit and sip this all the way through the BBQ. If I wanted to pick a beer to build a menu around, this would be a good choice, it will compliment spicy & complex flavors."
"Overall this beer reminds me that I should revisit this brewery more often, as I've never been disappointed. Well worth a shot."
"D- Very drinkable, great overall taste. Balanced with little hints of booze."
"A coworker of mine recommended this to me, and his enthusiasm is well-founded. This is a very nice Belgian pale. The flavors did not impress me much at first, but grew on me after a while. I would like to try this side-by-side with Troublette to taste any similarities, as I La Chouffe reminded me a bit of the 'ol snail. In short, get this if it's available in your area. Or trade for it!"
"Definitely worth a try, easy to put away a bottle or two."
"Orange, maybe darker gold in color, but with little head at all. Bubblegum and sugary fruits tease the nose. To the taste, it is sweet as expected. There is some nectarine, apricot, sugar, and bubblegum flavor pleasing me. Was coriander used in this beer? Because, it has that spiced coriander flavor as each sip comes to a close. Light on the carbonation and mouthfeel, and balanced without much perceived alcohol, which makes this beer easily drinkable. Recommended."
"d - very nice and refreshing."
"If you do not drink this beer fast enough, the spice turns a little strong and is noticeably harder to drink. This was never meant to be a power drinking beer so -0.5 adjustment for taste and drinkability."
"good drinkability.packs quite a strong alcohol punch surprisingly.nice."
"La Chouffe is a wonderful Belgian strong pale, a style which I am very fond of."
"This is a great strong ale and one brilliant beer, definitely a favourite and possibly a legend in the beer world."
"Overall a pleasant beer but if I have to grade it against the great beers in this category it doesn't stack up as well. While Chouffe is a great Belgian craft brewer this isn't my favorite of their offerings by a stretch."
"Creamy mouthfeel, but light and refreshing thanks to an active but moderate carbonation. There's alcohol in the flavor profile, but it's still hard to believe it's 8% - it's just goes down too easy. If there was a bar around here with this on tap, I'd surely be thrown out, eventually - this stuff is too easy to drink."
"Enjoyed from a wine glass on a spring night in Edinburgh. Pours nicely and has a medium golden color. A rather strong fruity scent on the nose. This beer has a very light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. It has sort of a wheaty taste and almost reminded me of a wit. Lots of fruit and very smooth. Delicious and eminently drinkable."
"Could have drank that beer to the end of the world that night."
"Drinkability: This beer is dangerously drinkable. Each sip fades and as it does so invites another and another. I could easily do 2 or 3 of these right now and I certainly will return to this beer given the chance."
"D: I'm generally a fan of BSPAs, and I'm generally a fan of Achouffe, so it's no surprise that this would be up my alley. David the Gnome won't steer you wrong."
"D- Great stuff and it has held up well at just about three years. The flavors are very well balanced at this point and this could be my favorite offering from this brewery. A bit high in abv but so what, I would drink a ton of this year round but preferably in warmer weather."
"Mouthfeel: Carbonated to the max with a medium to thin mouthfeel. Very crisp and improved as it warmed up."
"If it was only a little lower on the price and abv scale, I would give it a 5 for drinkability. This is among my favorite strong Belgian pales that I've had. World class brew."
"The mouthfeel is nice, medium body with high carbonation, alcohol is not present, which results in good drinkability so long as one does not mind being drunk quickly."
"Plush feel. Medium-full body. Very smooth, very creamy. Appropriate level of carbonation. Dry finish. Not overly complex, but delicious nonetheless."
"I very much enjoyed this brew, and definitely will get again if the opportunity arises."
"Pours a nice deep gold with a medium head. Leaves some lacing on the surface. Aroma is earthy and a little yeasty with some background phenolic, malt, and spice notes. Taste is also earthy and spicy- cloves, and some fruit notes. Some herbal hops in the finish add some bitterness. Complex, balanced, and very good. Very well carbonated, medium bodied, and somewhat dry. Pretty drinkable and quite good overall."
"Drinkability: Absolutely."
"D - Oh so drinkable, I would really like to try this on tap. Very good."
"D- I don't mind drinking a big bottle to myself because this beer is so versatile that it can pair with just about anything I usually feel like eating."
"D: Extremely drinkable and, if not for the high alcohol content (which is hidden very well I must add), seems close enough to an equivalent Belgian session beer."
"One of my wife's favorites, La Chouffe is a delicious Spring-thoughts-inducing golden ale that transcends one's mind to warm fields. Ok, enough with that, it's just a damned good Belgian farm-ale. The wonderful 1pt 9.4oz bottle pours a hazy gold with bright white fluffy head & sticky lace. The aroma is a hearty spiced yeast that comes trough with sipping and stays in the nose. Hints of lemon & pepper come through as well in this highly refreshing ale. The mouthfeel is relatively flat & the yeast is creamier than hoppier. Quite nice."
"Extremely drinkable - I think it does have a slight alcohol kick to it, but in the best tradition of the Belgians it's so well alleviated. Beautiful to drink, a real pleasure."
"Less lagery than the nose because of a slightly sour, cidery character which dominates. Quite a hoppy flavour on the finish. Bit simple on the palate though, there's those sour, slightly hoppy notes and that's most of it. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, very nice and smooth in fact. Plus it's quite a nice, inoffensive sipping beer, but nothing that makes my loins breach and burst forth with essence."
"That being said, the fresh sample I had off draught in Belgium utterly blew my mind because of how good it was, so maybe the fresher the better. Although this bottle wasn't quite as mind shattering, it was certainly very enjoyable. If you're curious to try Belgian ales or if you already know you like them, be sure to stock the cart with plenty of these little gnomes."
"Light bodied easy drinker Belgian ale. Highly drinkable but watch out as this beer does have legs."
"Notes: Quite the hoppy BSPA! It features some citrus fruits, exotic fruits, a nice touch of spice, and a sizeable, but undetectable alcohol presence. This is pretty good, but where's that Belgian yeast that I love so dearly? Anyhow, still definitely worth a try if you like BSPA's."
"Would drink this again and looking forward to other brews by this brewery."
"This is an amazing beer. There...my review is over. Ok, for real though. This pours a hazy golden with massive, fluffy, white head with great retention and amazing lacing. Smell is an amazing blend of yeast, pear, grape, apple, some bread, and alcohol. Just incredible. Taste is great as well. Ripe sweet fruit (see smell description) with some yeast, bread, dry malt and grassy hops. Touch of spice as well (but I couldnt tell you what exact ones). Mouthfeel was light and smooth with a certain creaminess too it. Sweet, somewhat dry aftertaste. Overall a great beer and VERY easy drinker. So easy I had to capitalize ""very."""
"Pours bright orange with a vast fluffy white head. Aroma is orangy with anise clove and allspice. The flavor is lightly phenolic spicy, with clove, malt, and light grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Lovely"
"Pours a hazy gold in color with a nice, huge, frothy head. Smell is slightly spicy. Not sure on the exact spice(s), but after having the Gulden Draak, this is entirely different. Clean, zesty, and spicy on the taste. A little more bitter in the taste and not as full on the mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is high. Good flavor profile and nonapparent alcohol make this Belgian ale easy to consume and quite a treat."
"D: A bit too sweet for my general tastes, but this is not a beer I can ever complain about. Mid-High ABV is unnoticed."
"D - This is a great Belgian ale. It was nice to have it on tap."
"Overall: Not as good as Chouffe's IPA but decent. I'd probably try it again. Spices aren't as detectable as I expected them to be."
"Had a bottle with steamed mussels in a bacon sauce - delicious pairing. This reminds me a bit of a double wit, or strong wheat for the vanilla-like spiced yeast character. There's also a great orange candy taste under the yeast character, that adds a nice juicy element. And like so many great Belgians, this beer ends with a peppery hop note. I'll come back to this one."
"D- An excellent beer, sweet but not overly, very enjoyable."
"I'm not sure anything can displace Duvel from my personal list of top strong Belgian pales, but this is a unique, tasty and just darn good brew."
"Easy to drink and easier to enjoy."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Long Beach. Served in a goblet glass. Color is a golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma is fruity bubblegum with a hint of spice. Flavors match the aroma with bubblegum and spice notes, also giving candy sugar sweetness and a little alcohol. Nice and light for the size and a dry finish. A nice Belgian beer to end the evening."
"Full-bodied with brisk carbonation expected from the aggressive Belgian yeast. A strong beer that would limit drinkability if looking to make a night out of it. However, very mild on the tongue if this were to be part of a tasting or if one had plans of switching beers for the evening at some point."
"Huge head, white, good lacing, smallish bubbles, somewhat diminishing. Golden color, fizzy, pretty opaque. Very flowery aroma, alcoholy, like Allagash. Intense flower and spices aroma. Coriander, bananas. Fizzy taste, clean sweet aftertaste. Lightish taste compared with the aroma, bananas, flowers, spices. Slight bite of taste in the middle of the taste, but really creamy smooth finish. Not much alcohol taste (which is good) compared with the aroma. Tasty, but missing something in the taste, more fruit, too much flower. Light, slightly watery taste."
"Overall: Lots of complexity for this one and well deserving of its reputation"
"a simply beautiful product. so complex and so elegant. really a lot going on here, but in such harmony. this is beer at its finest."
"Overall: Pretty solid beer but I think I prefer Houblin LaChouffe a lot more than this one. I will try this again. The bottle is cool as hell."
"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. It was presented in an oversized La Chouffe goblet. It was a clear golden color with minimal head, it left no lacing. The aroma was mildly sweet and a little spicy, but nothing exciting. The flavor profile was sweet aand floral. The finish was crisp. The beer has a medium body and was way too quaffable. An enjoyable brew."
"Notes- I find this to be an odd duck of a beer. I really enjoy it, and I plan on buying more, but at the same time, in most categories, compared to others in the same style, it is weak. This is a very nice, enjoyable beer that breaks free of the stereotypical Belgian Strong Pale mold, without straying too far."
"Great brew"
"Overall: An excellent Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Took me a few sips before i could really get immersed in the Complexity that is La chouffe. Will have whenever possible."
"Drinkability is ok, I've never been to impressed with this beer, a bit to sharp, with not enough depth of flavor."
"Pours a hazy sunburst yellow/orange. Fluffy white head that gives way to mostly lacing after a short while. Aroma is mellow hops, with strong notes of candied oranges. Flavor is sweetly hoppy, with lots of citrus in it. This is a good example of what jacking up the volume of hops, that aren't really hoppy... any brewery can pump tons of C-hops into an IPA and blow your head off with the flavors- this beer is full of more mellow hops that don't blow your head off... interesting mix of sweet malt, along with the hop character I described above."
"Good stuff!"
"McChouffe was a little disappointing to me, so this exceeded all expectations. Aside from the kind of bland smell, everything else about this brew is great. Great tasting malts and the appearance is just enticing. A truly solid Belgian pale ale."
"D: I had 10oz with no problems, but a second might have gotten bothersome due to the fizz."
"D - Very drinkable, a liked it"
"Overall this was a really nice beer. The alcohol was well hidden, and it's easy to drink a bottle before you know what hit you. I'd try this again in the future."
"Overall a tasty BSPA. I really enjoyed the strong citrus qualities and mild spices. A winner."
"Very solid Belgian Strong Pale. Will be looking forward to enjoying more of this in the future."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a huge foamy white head. Spicy aroma with lots of crisp fruit notes. Flavor very similar to aroma with nice amount of spice and hops balancing out the apple, pear and garpe flavors. Very quaffable. Nice carbonation up front with sweet alcohol center and slight dry finish."
"try this at a time when no one is talking to, at, or around you, and don't take a shower a minimum of 12 hours prior.. if this sounds like too much trouble because you are irresistibly popular or just too important, do us all a favor and have your secretary put it in your calendar as an appointment, then go get lost in your own eyes and die"
"Overall, a very good beer that nails the style with ease."
"11.2oz. bottled - best by end of 2006 indicated on the label (should have paid closer attention). Served in my DT tulip. Poured an orange-gold with lost of yeast and bubbles floating in solution. Two inch bright white foamy head sizzled and popped as it slowly collapsed into a solid half inch cap. Some spotty lacing, but weak legs. Nose is lemon zest, yeast and grassy. Flavors consisted of pale malt, some citrus, yeast and muted spices. Detected some ligth fruit as it warmed (maybe pear). Mouthfeel was light and lively with a mild residual burn detected at the back of the tongue and a slight citrus astringency that lingers at the finish. Fairly drinkable, but this one may have been past its prime. Will have to compare with a fresher bottle."
"D - Easily drinkable. The yeast and hop flavors play off of each other wonderfully and make for a complex and very enjoyable example of the style."
"Great all around. Love to drink a bottle myself, but it ends there. Can't go beyond a glass or two."
"D: Pretty good. This one definitely benefits from warming up a bit. I find that the warmer this gets, the mellower it becomes- but that may just be true with all beer. It's light body keeps this from being too filling, thus enabling me to drink more ;-)"
"Overall: La Chouffe is a unique world class brew. The true champagne of bottled beers."
"Great drinking beer, as to be expected from D'Achouffe."
"I really enjoyed this one and will definately have it again."
"as soon as i opened it up, i smelled a skunkiness, i was really worried it was a really old one, or it somehow got crapped up, but i think its ok. regardless it looks fantastic, a beautiful golden color with a pure white sparkly head. smell is fantastic as well, belgians are just the best thing ever, i can't think of a better beer than a great belgian strong ale, or a trip/dubble taste just makes me want to move there and become a monk and swim in the beer. i really dont know what else to say, just amazing."
"Pale blonde, fluffy head. Smells of spices with a hint of hops and fusel alcohol. Tasty fruits are abound and the body is kept light. I drank this at my local, corporate, 200 tap watering hole, but because it was a warm day and work was over, it hit the spot. Solid Belgian strong pale."
"mouth is thin and slightly oily but smooth, sweet and very easily drank."
"D: To remain rather light bodied for being as big as it is, this beer wins a lot of points in my book. Couple that with the great taste and you have for yourself one highly drinkable beer, that is worthy of multiple return visits."
"I would say this is a good drinkable beer."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Duvel to me has a bit more flavor, but this isn't far behind. if you're a fan of this style, do yourself a favor and try this one."
" This is pretty much spot-on stuff and a pleasure to consume."
"This is really good stuff, too bad I can't get it at home."
"Pours a light but cloudy gold body with a decent head and a lace ring to match. Light to medium bodied, a great fruit (citric, dark, heavy all rolled in there) taste and carbonation that dances on the tongue. Complimented by some mild maltiness and a dry backbite that seems to come from some spices for a very smooth, very lively drink. This is a great beer."
"This is one I could drink & drink...just loved it."
"All that I can say is that I wish I had bought the bomber instead of the 12oz this one glass is not enough."
"Tastes of grassy hop bitterness, spices (yeast), slight fruitiness and sweet malts."
"Notes: This is not my favorite Strong Pale Ale but a very good example none the less. I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability is decent with this ale. The carbonation is a bit rough but the overall taste is good enough to warrant trying it. If I had another bottle, I'd probably age it for 6 months, possibly longer. At least you can't tell the alcohol content."
"had another two months later... and didn't seem like the sugar was broad faced in the palate as much as before. nice assistance... more honey like... more pollen like. quite a bit better. still would recommend for the american hop head joe IPA. try the De Dolle Dulle Teve... more interesting hop character with the belgian sugar quality... although it is a triple."
"taste is dry and thick on the tongue, peach, pear, spice, malt, slightly sour, finishes dry with just a touch of bitterness."
"Golden, transparent color with thick snowy head that clings to the glass. Aroma of sweet vanilla and a bed of flowers welcomes you in. Medium body with slight malt and citrus notes, finishing with a touch of vanilla and spices that linger. A well hidden 8.0% ABV behind some real flavor and charm. An enjoyable summer time beer with an amiable personality."
"Pours a golden/orange color, bright, with a thick fluffy head which is maintained leaving some wonderful lacing. Quite a bit of carbonation. This beer is very smooth with amazing drinkability. A bit light but the flavors blend nicely. Sweet malts, yeast, semi-tart fruits, with a floral hop character. Perhaps a bit fragrant. Again, at first it all seems a little light but the further I worked through the beer the more I appreciated it's delicate nature. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This one is on the lighter side for body and finishes semi-dry. Low levels of delicate carbonation that quickly fade and leave the palate. Alcohol isn't hidden all that well, however its presence enhances the overall experience when drinking this beer. Its warmth adds to the feel and semi-dryness of the palate, its taste helps to balance out and add complexity to the overall flavor.... This is one I'll drink again, one I'll buy again, and one I'll recommend to people. Overall quite a nice beer. In my opinion its almost a mix of Tripel-the dominant spicy notes mixed with a Belgian Strong Pale-the sweeter notes. This isn't one I'd look to for either as a definition of a style, but it is quite good. Give it a try."
"at the Delirium Cafe in Brussel. Tripelish hazy gold look, great retention, aromas of banana with noted hop presence, more of the same in the palate with fruits, spices, almost wheaty, exceptionally easy drinking, really, really with we could get this stuff in Ontario. Beats McChouffe easily in my mind, recommended!"
"Pours a beautiful glowing golden color, big rocky tan head settles into an off-centered island of foam in the beer, thick sheets of lacing clinging to the glass. Smell is full of fruity goodness, some apple, some lemon, faint peach, lots of pepper and spice notes. Very delicate balance of flavors here, plenty of the apple coming through, a refreshing peppery zing, tartness aplenty. Excellent mouthfeel, really active little bubbles, super-refreshing...this could be a very unexpected summertime treat. This is something I'll be drinking plenty of in the future...fantastic Belgian beer."
"This is the summer brew I have been looking for several months now. I would consume this out a used cowboy boot if needed. Absolutely delicious!"
"On tap at Ebenezer's in a tulip. Purs the standard yellow color with a thin white head. Smells of spice and some yeast. Great initial flavor- sweet with a bubble gum type kick. Really refreshing for a strong pale. Lots of flavor and a crisp refreshing mouthfeel. I could drink a few of these!"
"D: A classy Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Comes at you as the beer warms and to my delight is not overpowering and very drinkable."
"Overall a nice light Belgian that I really enjoy. I would like to taste this and Duvel together, see what I like better."
"The flavor is fine and all, but I was expecting more of a hop presence, and was let down when I didn't find it. Since it was billed as a Belgian IPA, I guess I was naive about how the style would probably come out. Oh well."
"It felt good on the palate, but was just too sweet to make it really drinkable for me."
"Bought at the local supermarket (after it was bought-out by a French mega-chain). The beer pours a hazy golden hue with a modest head. Lots of lace, thought. The aroma is quite good....lots of floral qualities. Flowers and light pale malt. A touch of hops, black pepper (honestly), subtle spice, and yeast...the aroma provides the framework for this brew. The taste is moderately sweet and full of spice. Nice alcohol warming. Moderate carbonation and a little hop bitterness in the back. The beer has a terrific lingering aftertaste. Although it's not as flavor-forward as a lot of great Belgians, this beer is engaging and very enjoyable. The peppery aspect is very enjoyable. Certainly worth having again."
"D= This is an excellent and very drinkable offering. I will be seeking more of this one!"
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a hazy toasted straw color with a nice and fluffy pure white head that left rings of lace as it dissipated. The aroma is big with pale Beglian malt/yeast, corriander, tart apple, juicyfruit. Closer to the Wit side of the Belgian world. The taste is of pale malt, slight Belgian yeast spiciness, subtle corriander, a touch of sweetness from the candi sugar, a touch of pepper/earthiness and a hint of tropical fruit. Not big bold BSPA flavors but clean and well balanced. The feel is fairly light and fizzy carbonation, though not overly carbonated; finishes slightly sweet but balanced. Hides the booz-a-hol very well. Another Chouffe winner, not bold BSPA flavors but perfectly balanced."
"Overall a damn fine beer! I wish my bottle wasn't skunked. There's gotta be something to make these guys get rid of green bottles!!!"
"One of my favorite styles."
"Some big body, yet an easily drinkable beer."
"A quaffable soda-pop disguised as a strong Belgian ale, this beer hides its ABV very well. A fun drink that reminds me of a Creamsicle, only without the stick."
"A decent Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but it fails to capture my attention."
"Drinkability- Tried this after researching other Belgian Strong Pale Ales and am glad that I gave it a try. Not as commanding as others I have tried in the same family but nontheless a good Stronp Belgian PA."
"D: due to the ABV and fizziness I could probably only drink 1 PT bottle of these in a sitting...doesn't mean it isn't a great beer though!"
"drinkability is good. this is an easy going belgian with a smooth and pleasing hop presence. cheers!"
"drinkability - I know this is popular,but felt it was overrated. I thought it was an ok beer, above average, but nothing that I would says wow you have try this."
"On Tap at Julian's in Providence. Pours cloudy orange with a huge white head. Aroma of banana, grass, yeast, and citrus. Flavor of grass, citrus, and slightly spicy. Finish is slightly bitter. Medium mouthfeel and medium=high carbonation. Nicely complex beer."
"hazy pale orange, ok retention. Smells sweet, citrusy, coriander. Coriander definitely present in the taste, though not overbearing. Citrusy smell becomes more of an orange-lemon tangy bitterness, most likely imparted by the hops. Good use of hops - sweetness nicely balanced out. The overall zestiness is really reminiscent of a wit beer. Combined alcohol, hops, and high carbonation makes the liquid dance in my mouth. I wouldn't say the 8% is totally unexpected but like many well made belgian ales, it really doesn't hurt the drinkability. Recommended."
"Light to medium mouthfeel with a very carbonated, high alcohol punch. The beer is a delicious warmer that is definitely a sipper."
"Had this with fellow BA Moxley. Poured from a Petit bottle into a goblet, had apricot color and almost very little head that settled to nothing. The aroma was light and malty, but the taste was heavy spice up front with light malty flavor. It got better as it warmed and the sediment sips saved it from disapionting to acceptable, but still not something I would buy again. I wish I had BA member 3080's experience with this one, maybe we had a bad bottle."
"Pretty good overall but second tier to the best of the style."
"I'd like to give a shout out to BA reviewer 3080. I don't think anyone can top his/her review of this beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Impressive hazy blond with a firm even white head leaving an even sheet of lacing covering the entire walls of the goblet. Sweet smell of apple, pear, apricot and peaches. The taste was spicy with sweet fruit, apples, white grapes and hoppy spice with a slightly dry champagne finish. Heavy carbonation although it suits this beer well. Nice sweet mouth coating that lingers after the swallow. Very impressed with this one. Try it if you get the chance. No comment on that little fucker on the bottle, I wont give him the satisfaction."
"D- Drinkable yes...just don't think I could put these away all the time."
"This beer seems on the verge of greatness, but comes up a little short. A touch too flat and watery. But it's easy to drink, I'll give it that. And I'll have another."
"This is quite refreshing, but the taste is incredibly faint. seems just this side of water. This is not really a knock, but I'm kind of amazed at the lack of definite tastes I can pick up in this. It's not like a poor macro lager, which is watery and sad, it's like water, yet light and crisp."
"I was pleased that my first experience with this beer was on tap. This is an excellent beer, although it's funny - my first impression was that it tasted and smelled a bit like a creamy Hefeweizen. It tasted a bit smoky, with hints of peaches and bananas. It had a delicious appearance in the glass, with a hazy gold color and a frothy head. It also had hints of spiciness - clove and pepper with a light hoppiness to the finish. Overall a really excellent, drinkable beer. It also makes an impression on tap, my friends and I are still discussing this brew several days later."
"The pour was a bubbly gold with a frothy white head of two fingers. It wreaked of citrus and honey. Bitter hops, citrus, honey, and spices were all present in the taste. The mouthfeel was great. Very refreshing and easy to drink. I would definitely go after this beer again. I look forward to trying all the products that La Chouffe makes."
"D: Those little gnomes really know how to make good beer. The flavor profile will appease the stodgiest of critics."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy pale straw color with a thick, white creamy head into a chalice. The smell was of yeast and bubble-gum. The taste was of candy sugar, hints of apple and bubble-gum, with a nice bitter finish. Good carbonation and lacing. Very refreshing for a strong ale - a solid beer."
"M + D: A liberal carbonation sizzle over the tip of the tongue... calms through the body. Wet and refreshing... tasty enough to go back for more, but not quite big bodied enough to be a gentle sipper."
"A lot of flavor and alcohol but with a smooth finish. I could drink a couple and I recommend trying it, but you wont see me having more then one or two of these in a night."
"La Chouffe pours a pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thick sticky head that lingers nicely. The aroma is a bit of sulfur with some sweet pale malt and undertones of dry, chalky yeast and esters. The slight skunkiness comes through in the flavor but just a bit. The flavor is sweet with more of the light yeasty esters. I don't quite taste any spices, but I think thats probably evidence of good light spicing, it's there but not dominant. This is a very good beer, but it's unfortunate that it comes in a green bottle, as I'm sure this contributed to the skunked off-flavors."
"Poured into a snifter. Poured a cloudy, straw yellow, with a slightly orange hue to it. Nice solid white head that hangs out for a while. Great lacing. Aromas are of sweet citrus, honey, tropical fruits, spices, nutmeg, anise, and some yeasty esters. Nice citrus flavor on top, s well as tropical fruits being all over this one. Some nice spices like clove and nutmeg really balance this out. Light mouthfeel, crisp and clean, with a great carbonation level. I think this beer is outstanding. Anything by Chouffe is worthy of a try, but their flagship beer is very delicious."
"Extremely drinkable - please go enjoy one of these, if you haven't already!"
"this is possibly one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"D- Masks its 8% abv well, nice fruity aromas and tastes make this a nice flavoursome belgian"
"A very enjoyable beer"
"Drinkability: Yes, I'll have another. One of my favorite Belgians to date."
"Well, I don't know that i'm of right mind to rate it's drinkabilty, as I've nearly polished off the bottle after a few drinks prior and am reeling just a bit. This is a nice beer on it's own but really shines i think when paired with certain foodstuffs... give it a try with your favorite cheese."
"D - If not for the alcohol content, would make the ideal session beer. Excellent."
"Brasserie d'Achouffe's Dobbelen IPA was without a doubt one of my favorite beers of all time, so I had high hopes for their Belgian Strong Pale Ale... this one didn't disappoint... after loving their last two samples, I must say this is an outstanding brewery specializing in some real, authentic, outstanding brews that really hit home and impress with their distinctive high quality... Pours a wonderful golden color with decent foamy head... serious carbonation is visible behind a grainy, straw-colored hue... Teriffic ripe-fruit smell, with a crisp, fresh, light, aroma... taste was full of grapefruit, bananas, sweet candy, with a clear, crisp flavor full of yeast... the 8% ABV is not detected behind a rich conglomeration of fruit-filled flavors that dance on the tongue... amazing, rich, tasty mouthfeel with ultra-easy drinkability that goes down crisp, clear, clean, and smooth... no trouble drinking this one... a world-class brew... Definitely recommended..."
"Golden straw color, hazy, with great head retention, almost 3 fingers. Head stays for pretty much the duration of the drink. Loads of lace along the glass. Aroma is sweet with some peppery hints, also some honey. Taste reflects the aroma, but not with as much sweetness as I would have expected. Lots of fruit flavoring, some apple and citrus, along with some honey, also some coriander and some peppery spice. However the fruity flavoring is soon subdued by a dry hoppiness and soft alcohol glow. Mouthfeel is fizzy, reminding me a little of a Duvel, but full and coating. Very drinkable, 8% is not incredibly high, and the complexity of the flavors allow for continual imbibing contemplation."
"This beer had a relatively heavy body which is somewhat rare with these belgian golden ales. I am hop head so I really like the thickness of the strong american ales. This was an extremely drinkable beer and will most certianly try it again."
"This was one of the first Belgian beers I really liked and have dismissed it for the past 6-7 years. I must say i've been missing out."
"A bit dissapointed by this one- I had very high expectations. Pourned nicely, a bit hazy- but nice creamy head. As I drank the bottle, I could see the extra yeast diposit. Nice spicey aromas and flavors- definetely on the dry side, even though there was some sweetness as it mellowed. Clearly enjoyable, but not distinctive. Too much competition at this price."
"I enjoyed this one with some chunks parmesan peppercorn baguette. The peppercorn works well with the dryness and hops."
"Maybe only the 3rd time I've had this brew... I always look over it, because my brew stores typically only carry the 750's and I try and get smaller bottles because my ADD tells me I must try something else... good choice even though the nose is definately lacking."
"Hazed orange gold with a white head. Nose is yeasty and citrus. Flavor is strong with apparent yeast influence and a minute citrus edge. Sweet, but not overly so. Definite influence from spices, but not overpowering by any means. Feel is good with carbonation. Pretty standard for the style, but still good. Highly drinkable. Id go back to this again and again...and again."
"A wonderful Belgium. Girls find the Grimble Grumble Gnome cute. Biding my time with this beer, I find it lovely. Opened it to find it bubbling out into onto my counter, quickly into my glass. A Spiced Blondie, she had lots of carbonation and lots of suspended yeast (best I could tell, of those little floaters). The guy who devised Oberon & Two Hearted recommended this so I had to try. I can see why. This beer would be amazing on draught at the source."
"This beer ended up with a higher rating than I thought it would when I first tried it. It' just that the mouthfeel and drinkability are so memorable that I am drawn to it when I want something cool. Not much more to say besides what has been written except that I find this to be like a dumb blond chick that's good in the sack. I don't want to marry her, but she's great fun on a summer day."
"The taste is not overpowering, and for the style incredibly easy drinking and smooth. Definently worth the price for an easy drinking belgian night. The mouth is smoot and nicely carbonated."
"Flavor boasts spicy sour fruits and sweeter malts. Very bitter as it goes down which accentuates the spice profile. Light hops also make an appearance."
"La chouffe is for the most part a standard belgian golden. nothing particularly amazing ( other than the fact that its brewed by dwarves!) but a great drink none the less. it pours super carbonated, but a suprisingly small head ( for a golden that is) taste is basically a weaker yet smoother version of the dobbelen IPA triple) smooth and bubbly, taste of hops and has almost a white ale twinge to it, clearly belgian in character. Good brew"
"D: Pretty good. Nicely balanced flavors and a clean, dry feel make this one go down pretty easily."
"Smell of faint allspice, raspberry, malt and cream. The taste starts off light and tangy with carbonation, finishing heavier with more yeast presence, nutmeg and citrus. I don't quite like this as much as their ""double IPA tripel"" but it is very good."
"This gets high scores across the board, I can't think of anything I dislike about this beer, it is solid through and through. I wasn't sure what I would think of this because I had already sampled Achouffe's Houblon IPA, and I think it is out of this world, so I figured this might bore me a little, but it is not the case at all. And I still can't get over how easy this beer is to drink!"
"D: Highly drinkable beer."
"Delightful to drink."
"Hazed golden color, vigorous carbonation supporting a nice frothy head. Spicy, grassy hop aromas meld with sugar cookies, coriander, and citrus. Malt sweetness, oranges, and spicy hops with fruity esters and a slight hint of alcohol. Effervescent body, crisp, and fairly light. Good stuff."
"I like this beer but it isnt my favorite style ."
"Review translated from french 7-9-2008."
"poured from a 755ml bottle labled best by end of 2008 into a pint glass. Huge white head with tiny bubbles that lasted a while. Lots of yeast floating in the glass and bottle. The smell is spice with sweet fruits as well although not as strong as it could have been. The taste is very complex with the sweet fruits, very nice spicyness and little hop bitterness thrown in at the end. This is a very drinkable brew and I would love to have again."
"D: One of the better tasting of this style."
"Overall: This beer is pretty decent. The taste is pretty good and this beer is very drinkable. Its an enjoyable brew."
"D: A very good beer from the La Brasserie d'Achouffe, been wanting to try this beer for a long time, but have been putting it of for a while. If you're a fan of yeasty, Belgian strong ales, you'll enjoy this."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle sets in the glass a slightly hazy gold color with a massive bright white head that creamy in texture, with the resultant lace a thin slip to cover the glass. The nose is fruity, sweet and a slight yeast tone also noticed, lemon-lime crispness seals it off with the start is delightfully sweet, delectable are the malts, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is biting in its acidity, the hops perfect in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, on of my favorite beers from Brasserie d'Achouffe!"
"D: Quite smooth for 8%. I would definitely like another!"
"Fantastic Belgian Strong Pale. Poured an orange golden colour with loads of yeast bits and other debris floating about. I find debris/sediment very attractive in most Belgian styles, and this certainly has plenty. Smell is very fruity and very yeasty. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but you really have to be looking for it. Taste, too, is fruity and yeasty with alcohol that is difficult to detect. Quite drinkable for an 8,0%abv brew. This is a really good beer and a great example of the style."
"Drinkability- Not so much due to the alcoholic flavor. All-around a great Belgian beer, but the phenolics take over and make it something that you can't drink all day."
"Very impressive beer."
"Move over Duvel? Perhaps not quite, but the La Chouffe offers some great flavor and spice that's suprisingly unique. It's a well-balanced, solid offering. I paid $6 for about a 12-ounce draft so, at least in this instance, I'd say it's a great value as well. Highly recommended."
"'Petit' bottle, pours a nice golden orange into my chalice, a decent whitish head receding to a nice film, a bit of a whirl bringing back a thick, carbonated foam. There is a lovely use of spices here, from coriander to whatever this yeast is giving off, in addition to the spices from hops through the beginning and end. The mouth is fairly solid, well carbonated, about as good warm as cool. In all, I just didn't get too excited over this one, as much as I wanted to. Perhaps some other time."
"Pours out a brassy gold with a decent sized head that somewhat clings to the glass. No lacing to speak of. This smells overtly of coriander. The pale malts come through, but the spicing is a bit much. There's some booze in there as well. Taste has the same things going on as the aroma (especially with the over-spicing) along with an overbearing graininess and sweetness. There's some toastiness in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is rather sticky and prickly. Not impressive."
"Got this one at my bachelor party at Eulogy in downtown Philadelphia. Pours a clear golden color with a nice big bouncy head on top that sticks around. Nose is nice and strong: spices dominate, along with some light citrus and wheat. Taste is fairly similar, although even stronger and more delicious. Carbonation is strong but appropriate to the beer, and the body is quite full and tasty. This one's delicious, one I could throw back a bunch of if it weren't for a rather high ABV and pricetag."
"Chouffe has to show."
"Pours a hazy golden / light amber color with a large finely carbonated head. The head fades quickly to a covering of the glass. There is moderate to light lacing. This is an amazingly smooth and balanced Belgian. Both the nose and the taste give an initial hint of astringency, followed by a mild candy sugar and fruit taste. Some of the Belgian beers I have tried have a bolder first taste but would not stand up well over the long haul. This would be a great Belgian ""starter"" beer. There is no overwhelming astringency or sweetness that could get annoying over the long haul. La Chouffe features a rich mouthfeel, very balanced sweetness / astringency and no alcohol taste. Drinkability would be based on how wasted you wanted to get. The flavor would stand up fine to a long, slow disciplined session."
"Draught @ Eulogy Tavern: Mine poured a hazy, golden color with almost no head and minimal lacing. Definitely some spice to the aroma. There is also notes of fruit and sweet malts. The taste is good. It is slightly beady and yeasty, with hints of fruits, as well as some coriander. Nice."
"Medium body with a creamy texture. Average carbonation. Lots of flavors present. Pine and peach combination was nice. Nothing overwhelming. Very drinkable, especially during Summer. Almost reminds me of Duvel."
"Notes: I would drink this all day on a hot day, but that alcohol content sneaks up on you quick. I may pick this up again, next time leaving the sediment in the bottle."
"Heavier than other Belgian Strong Pales but still a very nice and complex brew."
"Wondrously complex and very well flavoured with a good drinkability for an 8% ABV beer. Only downers are I find it perhaps a bit crowded and confusing on the flavour and the extent of the murkiness is a little aesthetically displeasing."
"Mouthfeel is decently thick, not as highly carbonated as the appearance would lead to believe. Almost but not quite creamy. Finish is light and smooth, apparent alcohol but easy to drink. Even when warm, the beer is relatively easy to make disappear. Tasty, solid for the style, and an excellent introduction to Belgian beer."
"A very nice brew this is. Sweetness with a good deal of hop backing. A real treat from Belgium!"
"Drinkability is great, as any exceptional BSPA should be, in my opinion. You'll polish off the 750 with ridiculous ease, as have I. Great beer."
"Cheers!"
"this one poured a nice, hazy golden color with a white head that went about 90% away pretty quickly. the nose was nice, but not heavenly. spicy, yeasty and a little peachy. the taste was the taste was also spicy (corriander, pepper) with a slightly peach and subtle hop flavor, but the pilsner malt was really cool to me. pretty complex, but not over the top. mouthfeel was near perfect for a nice summer day like today - smooth, bubbly, unoffensive. a great strong pale ale"
"-Oelergud"
"Certainly a drinkable and tasty beer, but I wasn't psyched about it afterwards. It's good, but not on par with some other Belgian Pales on the market that I've recently experienced. That being said, it paired well with a medium-sharp cheddar (Hook's 5 year sharp)."
"Drinks a little slow, due to its complexity, great example of the style, love this brewery!"
"Very easy to drink. I could have had both glasses myself. Just a bit pricey; but then, it's from Belgium, so what did I expect?"
"This has to be one of my favorite beers. We went to Belgium last fall to try out various beers and never came across this wonderful beer. It wasn't until an excursion into Amsterdam that I found it. Love the little elf-guys on the bottle. The beer itself has a lovely color and the taste is warm and spicy- thanks to coriander. This beer is very drinkable (most Belgians are) and I love sharing this with friends who aren't as in to beer as I am because it really does have a wonderful taste that anyone can appreciate."
"I'm not always a big fan of spiced ales but D'Achouffe hit the nail on the head with this one. A truly enjoyable Belgian Golden with clean flavors."
"Slightly cloudy reddish - gold body with very active carbonation under a white head that diminished quickly. Cloves dominated the smell with a malty biscuit like background. The taste is a very good mix of peppery spices and pale malts; it has a very good balance and is very tasty. The mouthfeel is right on; it is light and smooth with good hit from the carbonation. It is a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: A good, light sweet-malty beer. Im not sure how it compares stylistically to other SPAs (La Chouffe calls it a golden ale) but it is quite tasty in its own right. Recommended."
"Nice to see the draught version around these parts. The beer, as remembered, is a run for the top spot of beerdom. The pour is a hazy straw with hints of yeast and spiced in suspension. Good head retention and solid on carbonation promises creaminess and richness. Aromas release a juicy, mouthwatering plethera of ripe fruits, sweet malts, bold esters, tartness, and a splash of honey. The flavors are most bold with fruit flavors of peaches, pears, banannas, apples, lemons, appricots, mangos... Bold sweet malts swirl around the fruits and lend a full, rich cotton candy and bubblegum softness. Back-up notes of clove, corriander, curraco, ginger, and nutmeg gives a ton of variety to the brew. The feel is an anticipated rich, smooth, velvety blanket across the palate; soon washed by fruity tartness and alcoholic strength. Finishes with a mildly dry, clean fruit flavors. Simply a great beer."
"D: Drinkability is excellent. This beer reminds me of a slightly less hoppy version of Popperings Hommelbier, which is my favorite BPA. This was a pleasure to drink."
"Well balanced and good. Will try this one again to see if the appearance improves with a better bottle."
"Overall, i think this is just a fantastic beer. Great spices, is sweet, and still have a great hop characteristic."
"D-Middle of the road, this is clearly a good beer but there is something that leaves me a little flat compared with other Belgians."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lively mouth filing carbonation. The drinkability is really good, and I think it would be great on a hot summer day. This isn't my favorite Chouffe beer, but it's still better thatn most."
"Golden color with a foamy head and yeasty formations, if you let the beer sit for a few minutes. Sweet, citrus smell. Taste is crisp, spicy and less sweet than the bouquet would lead you to believe--though there are still hints of fruit (pear, white grape)--with a malty aftertaste. This is a drinkable, effervescent beer that pairs well with hard, cow's milk cheeses like gruyere."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, CA. Poured a semi-hazy dark golden with a nice white cap. Smelled quite strong of fruit. Taste was very fruity and a bit dry. Mouthfeel was very light, carbonation was on the lower side for a belgian pale ale. Kinda got bored with this after a while but it wasn't all that bad."
"It finished clean and crisp and just a bit sticky on the palate. I don't usually think of the word ""refreshing"" to describe this style of beer, but La Chouffe definitely qualifies."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Not my first experience with this Ardenne dwarf, but certainly my best. Enjoying it with the warm sun on my back was a wonderful way to spend the afternoon!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow, fairly light, and with a moderate pure white head that lasts very well and leaves solid lacing. Smell is bright and spicy, coriander, cloves, and pepper, with banana and light citrus (orange and lemon), and some yeast and breads as well. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it's very clean and bold. Taste is rather sweet at first, the fruits coming through and malt sugars overwhelming the spicier notes. Coriander in the finish, and some light noble hops. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but lacks a little bit of body, and drinkability is good. Not a bad beer at all, enjoyable and well put together. Something I could see myself drinking often, even if it isn't anything particularly mind-blowing."
"Hazy, dingy gold body, slightly chunky, topped by a large-bubbled off-white head. Head shows decent retention. Aroma has a slightly sweet, key lime note. Really clean with a hint of spice. Flavor is really mild, with a smooth creamy body. Individual flavors are hard to pick out, as everything seems to blend together. Maybe a bit of coriander, a touch of honey, an ever so slight vanilla note, and just a touch of bitterness. It's impressive because it is so well crafted. Most beers impress by bullying your taste buds; this is subtle. The pinnacle of balanced flavors. Mouthfeel is also top notch. Very light, very quaffable for 8% ABV. I think this was $3 for the bottle. Best $3 I've spent on a beer in a very long time. Worth twice that. Time to go back and try Mc Chouffe as well I guess."
"Drinkability: To much of this and you're sure to be burping, but an excellent Belgian strong pale ale and very pleasant tasting."
"A very solid belgian ale- great color and even better aromas- yeast is subdued but definately there as well as a welcome amount of spice. Very complex early on with some interesting combination of tangy and sweet peppered with a slight burn. Great carbonation, extremely easy to drink way too fast. Light and satisfying. When its available on tap, jump at the chance to sample."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Chimay glass. There was thin frothy head was rather lasting in a razor thin form on top a rich golden brew with some sediment noticeable floating in the bottom of the glass. Aroma was a nice mix of spices, light biscuitty malt with a crisp yeast bite. Taste was much of the same with some nice vanilla characteristics. The carbonation was just right and the alcohol was well hidden by an appropriate level of sweetness. Very enjoyable brew if your willing to pay for it."
"This beer was served in a chalice with one of the smoothest looking, golden hues I've ever seen. Pale golden/yellow tones fill the glass, as a pearl white head rests comfortably on top for a decent amount of time. The smells were of subtle hints of vanilla, spice, and yeasty tones. This beer had matching flavors, as a light creamy vanilla rides into a malty, biscuit like finish. The mouth feel from this tap production was incredibly smooth, with a lighter/medium body. This beer paired very well with traditional fish & chips, but I'm dying to try it with a plate of wit beer steamed Belgian mussels...Enjoy"
"A unique Belgian pale, and one I'll regularly buy."
"taste is interesting... sweet and citrusy while very floral. meelow for 8.0, not all that much alcohol or thinness of flavor."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, particularly when colder,"
"the flavor is very rich, malty, spicy, peppery, herbal, flowery, dryish, there is plenty of carbonation which gives the brew a zest, there is a lingering hint of lemon and paradise seeds. wow what a great beer."
"Not sure I would have this again; it is good, but there are definitely better choices out there."
"Best before 2009. This was a Christmas present from my loving girlfriend. Pour carefully, as there is a good amount of sediment. A Belgian ale with a pilsner-like hop bite and a healthy dose of pilsner malt...reminds me very much of an American double pilsner. The yeast character is decidedly of the ale variety, with esters of flowers. Sweet and bread-like. Strong body like a bock; I don't know but many qualities I percieve as lager-like. This is a very good beer, but not one of my favorites; I think I may prefer the draft version more. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear amber gold with a giant white head. The head is huge and leaves great lacing. Be careful pouring this beer, lots of yeast and debris in this. The smell is strong with candy sugar, alcohol, and fruit,both dark and citrus. The taste has alot of candy sugar,very sweet, with citrus, alcohol, and a ""bisquity"" aftertaste. The m/f is medium and the flavors are very well mixed. An excellant beer that should not be missed."
"App. - 4.5, Smell - 3, Mouthfeel - 4, Taste - 3, Drinkability - 3"
"Without a doubt, this beer is a masterpiece and one of my favorite for the style. Reminds me of hours logged in at Essex Ale House in NYC, where the Brasserie d'Achouffe draught beers are well represented and served with style."
"75cL green bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Golden translucent body with an inch or so of white head and small bits of what is presumably yeast floating suspended in the body. Smells hoppy; citrusy and piney. Tastes sweet, citrusy, piney, yeasty, and spicey. Surprisingly refreshing for the abv. Alcohol flavor is only there a little in the aftertaste, but the alcohol warming is there. Light bodied and pleasant, full flavored and well balanced. Fantastic. I'm impressed."
"D- Good drinker but alcohol character too noticeable. A good beer from a style I like. But not my favorite of the type."
"drinkability: good"
"Interesting Belgian strong pale ale, certainly worth a try."
"Viva La Chouffe!"
"D: Not one of my favorite Chouffe's. Too much like the rest of the golden ale pack with out enough individuality."
"Warm finish. A very nice trip."
"This beer pours a wonderful hazy-golden color. A tremendous amount of bubbles rest on top of the brew after its poured, and they continue to rise long after the pouring has stopped. The smell is very sweet, with a big whiff of hops and spices. The taste is terrific. Seems to be the perfect amount of hops, malts, and carbonation. Also well balanced. The taste starts with fuggles hops, then in creeps the zesty lemon flavor. The end result is a wonderful synergy that amounts to a tremendous beer. Well worth seeking out."
"The flavor was malty and sweet with orange rind, apples and peach. spices like clove and cinnamon carried through the finish allong with some alcohol. All of the sweet fruityness was nicly ballanced with hops making this a very pleasant beer."
"Can an elf be cozy? I think so, because this may not be flashy, but it warms and lulls and caresses. It's so nicely blended that nothing stands out, but the sum is an enjoyable end result. The ABV is well disguised, and it just warms the drinkability. You're indeed welcome in my lair anytime, little elf."
"Pours out a cloudy golden orange color, with a decent foamy white head. The nose offers malt, pepper, close, coriander, and a bit of orange/apricot fruityness. Lots of things going on in the taste, Christmas flavors (clove, pepper, coriander), some fruityness (apricot), and sour green apple. Finishes dry with decent carbonation."
"Big mouthful of effervescence. Medium, creamy body. Slightly sweet finish, but balanced with a slight bitterness."
"Hands down one of my favorite belgians. I wouldn't pass this beer up for anything. If you haven't tried this beer or if you're searching for a good gateway beer into Belgians then you simply can't pass up this beer."
"The 8% alcohol is really deep in the flavor and barely noticeable so multiple refills is definitely an appealing concept with this fantastic biere."
"Overall: A very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It has the nice mix of fruitiness and spiciness that I like in the style."
"A too quick pour into my La Moneuse tulip lets a bit of chunky sediment into the glass (I usually forget to decant Belgians). The beer forms a slow-falling two-finger head, just off-white. The beer's body is a bright orange-gold, and visibly carbonated. The lacing is also quite dense. The nose is bright: full of green apples, grass, a bit of citrus, peach, sweet, and a bit peppery. But, there also seems to a green vegetable scent, like asparagus, that messes things up a bit (I like asparagus, just not in a beer). The taste is sweet and slightly alcoholic at first, but overshadowed by the asparagus flavor I noticed before. Ends fairly bitter. Terrible. Mouth is medium thick, and the carbonation is not as forward as I thought it would be. Still, this beer tastes horrible, so I must have a bad bottle, right? Nonetheless, I'll review and wait for another try."
"Pours a murky dark honey color with a think head that exploded at first, but settled quickly to a very thin cap. Aroma is banana, clove, woodsy, citrus, maple syrup, yeast, and wheat. Flavor is banana and yeast up front with a syrup and honey background. A muddle of flavors supporting the wheat, earthy grain, and honey malts. Some english noble hops carry the sweetness throughout with a nice bitterness. Some spice, pepper, oak, and coriander. Mouthfeel is light body, med high carbonation, and dry warm finish. Excellent beer!"
"Drinkability: a neat, lively brew from a smaller brewery, and quite drinkable!"
"This beer pours a dense, orange-yellow with lots of sediment swirling around. The thick, off white,pillowy head formed nicely in my Stone Imperial Russian Stout glass. Smelled very spicy with a hint of old beer. It tasted fantastic, low carbonation, spicy, lightly alcoholic. It feels syrupy in the mouth and I would have to say VERY drinkable. Cant wait to finish the bottle!"
"Cheers to the gnomes!"
"D: It's nice, bold and spicy, but the abv means I'm not drinking a ton of these. As a sippin' beer, it does the trick. Full of fruity and spicy flavors, blooms wonderfully, and"
"Very strong beer with a sweet molasses taste. No head to speak of. Served in a half pint tulip glass. Very rich and filling to drink. I did like the taste but it has more of an evening ending kind of taste... I think it would be a good idea to have this with food. We weren't eating at the moment and were also a little ways into an afternoon of tasting..."
"Pours a cloudy/hazed light-orange, with about a ½ inch of creamy white foam. Settles slowly, leaving fine lacing. Big banana ester aroma with coriander and clove. Taste is similar to the aroma. Orange citrus flavor at the start, slight spice in the aftertaste. Smooth, light start with a slight burn in the finish. Light enough to drink a few, but the alcohol is definitely felt."
"Hazy gold with a bright white head composed of (mostly) fine bubbles. A few larger bubbles formed a solid collar, while solid lacing developed as the head fell. Fruity sweet aroma, kind of like candy, with some lemon and lively peppery spices. Malty flavour, then lemony fruit character, then peppery spices in the finish. As it warmed, peach and clove flavours appeared. Slightly slick, full bodied, ample carbonation, a bit creamy. Tasty stuff! The spices carry nicely through the flavour - assertive without being overbearing. Very enjoyable."
"This beer poured a brilliant gold color with a huge rocky head that I had to scoop from the glass to keep from running over. Aroma was very spicy with notes of citrus(orange peel?) and sweet malts in the nose. Taste was equally impressive. Very spicy and peppery with flavors of pear, Belgian candi sugar, pilsner malt and clove. Mouthfeel was fairly light for such a strong beer, making the drinkability pretty high. Another fine beer from d' Achouffe."
"D: Very tasty and light, with a good kick to it. I could definitely stick with this one for a long time, but its a bit pricy to drink several of them in an evening."
"I could drink a lot of this. I wasn't expecting this to be as nice as it is. Great stuff."
"Dark honey color  frothy white head  nose of bread , wheat , sweet dough , cloves , and fruit notes  sweet yeast , sour dough bread , nutty , earthy , slight anise , and slight hopps - medium creamy sparely body  aftertaste is nutty / earthy , short sweet with yeast"
"D :: Meh, i'd want to savor this at the beginning of a night and not return to it later on. A real treat & experience."
"Served from a dusty bottle..nevertheless when the cap popped off it foamed like champagne. Served in a wine style Grottenbier glass. It had a nice thick white head that lasted throughout with little lacing. Also, to note, lots of yeast deposits in the bottom of the bottle and which some made to the glass, so it was a little cloudy with all the deposits floating around. The aromas were delightful, smelled delicious, very fruity. It is a smooth ale with hints of spice, fruity taste, yet even with the high ABV it is unnoticed till it hits ya and you have to check go BA what the ABV is! I probably would'nt drink too much of these at one time, but its definitely a tasty Belgian ale."
"I enjoyed this bottle with some white grapes, some cheddar and stilton cheese and crackers."
"Extremly drinkable, if only i could get this in my state..."
"This brew pours a cloudy orange color with ruby hues. The head is large, fluffy and bright white. The aroma is of yeast, citrus, faint caramel, and more yeast. The taste is like the aroma, but a bit harder to appreciate due to way too much carbonation. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium bodied with too much carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew that is covered up too much by the carbonation. I would drink it again, and certainly enjoy it. However, there are better Belgain Strong Pale Ales out there."
"The beer is a joy to drink."
"Presents itself as a nice light golden color with just a bit of haze. Big, fluffy white head that lasts. Nose is of spices and fruit, primarily. Quite lively. Palate is interesting, indeed. Hoppier than expected, this one is quite fruity (some citrus), light malts, and candy sugar sweetness in there. Mouthfeel is light, and easily inbibed. Clean finish. I'm a pretty big Duvel fan ( I can prove it ... I pronounce it correctly) and this is somewhat Duvel-like. Definitely not a copy though. Give this one a try or two ..."
"I really like this beer. I would definitely recommend it to a fan of Belgian beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not quite as dynamic or assertive as it is on-tap, perhaps due to sitting on a shelf for a while. Still a hallmark example of the style that I'll always enjoy."
"Great beer -period! Try it!"
"As a post-script, I was surprised by the unfiltered solids at the bottom, I should have been paying attention! This last quarter of the bottle turned the dials up to 11, amplifying the bitter and spicy tastes, more heavily astringent and alcoholic with a strong taste of cloves and nutmeg."
"Drinkability: Different to La Chouffe on tap, where there are more prominent fruits and malts on display. From the bottle, this emphasizes spices and bitter finish. After drinking this, I could see why Garrett Oliver might want to call this a saison rather than a golden ale or a strong pale ale. I definitely prefer this on tap, though the bottle was definitely drinkable and very pleasant."
"One important note... this was my second beer of the evening (after a Hockley Dark, 5%), but ended up being my last. Alcohol is well hidden and, lightweight that I am, I wasn't up for more after finishing this off alone!"
"Very nice!"
"Overall, an impressive Belgian."
"Drinkability: Overall, a worthy session beer. Light cheeses and pasta might accompany this best."
"Great beer, but I’m telling nothing new."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable offering. I had no problems what so ever downing the big bottle by myself, but now Im feeling the effects. I recommend this little gnome strongly."
"D- This beer had some nice smooth sweet flavors and a good complexity but the fizz in the mouthfeel was a bit overpowering but I'm not sure if it would have been overly sweet if that was not there."
"A nice Belgian Pale. Solid and drinkabale."
"Recommended to any Belgian beer afficionado..."
"A highly drinkable beer and another great offering from Achouffe."
"A good, solid Belgian Pale, beats many of them hands-down. I'd have to rate it above Duvel and La Fin Du Monde and some of the more commercially-available brands. Perhaps, if you're couch-bound for a night, even a sessionable ale."
"Poured a lovely hazy golden color with subtle white hues. High level of carbonation with a white, bubble-laiden head that seemed to sit patiently for quite some time. A touch of lacing was left behind in my goblet. Aromas of honey, alcohol, and candy seemed to come out. The alcohol seemed a bit too strong in the smell. The taste was just terrific with loads of flavors. Fruit flavors seemed to work well with the added spices. A bit of hot pepper added even more depth. Very smooth and refreshing with a soft, bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoy. I could have a bottle or two of this, no problem."
"Taste was merely a refelection of the smell, herbal with distinct coriander notes and probably some other herbs in there. Biterness was nicely balanced, a lot of triple style beer can learn something from this bitterness. It is a bitterness that makes me crave for another sip and adds that little extra to a beer. There is also a hoppy and hop-herbal taste, which give the beer a certain complexity. Mouthfeel was dry and drinkability was excellent, maybe a little too good, I finished a 750 ml bottle in 30 minutes...good stuff!!!"
"Edit: After putting the rest of the bottle in w/ yeast, it's (not surprisingly) much more opaque. Mouthfeel is much fuller and taste sweeter and mellower, and the problem with floaties has gone away. Seems to be more warming as well (that could be because I've had half the bottle though...) I would recommend having this one with the yeast in, after carefully pouring most of the bottle and doing the ""swirling the lees around"" trick to dissolve the floaties."
"Per BdA: 8% ABV. OG 16 °P."
"CRUX: SOLID BELGIAN STRONG ALE, but I don't know, I expected something different I guess, with the bottle littered with words like ""artisanal," ""mysterious," ""brewed with spice,"...i don't know, I think the damn gnome lied to me. Now if they would have said, ""Solid Belgian Strong Ale," I would have been like, great! Good beer, though....sessionable, even...like a Duvel lite! I prefer their triple IPA Houblin to this."
"Poured a orange-tan color with a fluffy cap that stacked in the glass. Active effervesence. Aromas of sweet malts spice, citrus and some must. Great malt spine, soft mouth feel. Great whack of sweet malts up front is balanced by the medicinal spiciness of the hops and cinnamon/corriander...citrus peel. Wet finish with a tart after taste. A great ale."
"I'll have to see what happens with later pours, but if the entire bottle tastes like the first, yeast-free pour, I imagine this is the ultimate Belgian session brew - 8%abv notwithstanding. This is so easy to drink, I'd have no problem putting a few of these back (much to my later chagrin, I'm sure.)"
"I really have enjoyed the beers I've tried from this brewery. This beer was a hazy orange with a thick white head and wonderful carbonation. It had a sweet, spicy odor. The taste was wonderful; spicy, some fruit (lemon), with a warm hoppy finish. Very nice, a great beer to drink."
"Update...after 20 odd more glasses (yes I am a lush but this stuff was on tap for only 3 bucks!) I have increased drinkability to 5 and the taste to 4.5 (from 4). I love this beer!"
"I have to admit, the best thing I like about the LaChouffe's is the bottle art. Something about little gnomes who make beer is quite appealing indeed. They are just cute as buttons on the bottle. I wish I owned one so he could brew beer at my beck and call. Maybe I can find one under the bridge behind my house."
"D: Not my favorite Belgian by any stretch, but fans of the style will like it. A bit like a Belgian Pale cross with a witbier."
"Mouthfeel is decently carbonated with a medium body."
"Spicy perfume-like aroma with a touch of citrus rind. Pale gold color with the obligatory two finge thick fluffy belgian head. Very clean feel in the fore and the flavors are somewhat medicinal and very floral. Mild notes of chamomille and lavendaer and more of the citrus rind."
"Im instantly a big fan of this one. Truly a pleasure to drink, but I think the wicked carbonation could get old after a while."
"I was at monk's cafe this weekend and continued on my quest to expand my knowledge of Belgian Beers. I ordered a la chouffe and it came to me in a tulip glass on tap. It started out with a nice white head that faded a little too quickly but was beautiful none the less. It smelled of pears and pepper, along with other fuits and spice I couldn't quite pin down. It was very intriguing and begged me to dive in. It tasted of the same, with some malty sweetness and a dry, spicy finish. Again, more generic spice and fruit that i unfortunately can't nail down more specifically. The mouthfeel was simultaneously light and creamy. Active carbonation added to the dry perception and made it a very lively drink. I have to say I was quite pleased with this one and I will be trying it from the bottle very soon."
"got a bottle of 2003 N'Ice; i may have to crack that soon"
"Cloudy, pale, light orange color. Half-inch head that lingers nicely. Smell is strong. Mildly sweet malt flavors with notes of citrus, apple, spice, and cloves. Taste is both sweet and sour, lightly-spicy, with hints of cinnamon and other spice. Malt flavor is fruity as described in the smell, but also bready. Medium-body, not too thin, it coats nicely and has good carbonation. Very unique flavor. Interesting and quite drinkable. Definitely worth a try..."
"Taste was not that complex, but masked the alcohol very well. This, combined with the mouthfeel make this a very solid and dependable brew. Enjoyed sharing this bottle."
"On draft at 3F's brewpub. A great white head sits on top of a red tinged gold body. A steady stream of bubbles race to the top. Great lacing down the glass as it is emptied. Bananna esters with some sweet malt welcome my nose. A well rounded body with good malt backbone and just enough hops to keep things in check. The alcohol is well hidden. This could be a sleeper after several pints go down the gullet. Very enjoyable!"
"Good stuff."
"750ml silkscreened bottlecapped bottle. Poured a slightly cloudy medium gold with a huge head and very good lace. Smells of slight caramel malt with honey and slight apple and peach flavors - a bit champagne like. Malty and fruit (apples and peach) up front with some spicyness and finishes with a slight non lingering hoppiness. More fruityness than anything - again champagne like. Perhaps a bit too fruity but still a tasty beer. Although I found the fruityness refreshing and different at the begining it became a bit annoying at the end of the bottle."
"This, to me, is your average sweet Belgian pale ale stuff. It's good, very tasty, good aroma, nice Belgian funkiness, pretty well balanced. Nothing over the top, but I'd drink it anytime."
"Well worth seeking out. Don't ignore the other Belgian biggies, but add this to the list of things to respect and enjoy frequently."
" Pours a bright, translucent golden color topped by a huge creamy white head that takes its sweet time to shrink to a manageable size. Clean aroma is rather subtle - light sweet malt, light grassy hops, a touch of astringency, and maybe (?) lavender or some other light herb. Palate is very pleasant and more assertive than the nose. Sweet malt, grassy hops, a touch of Belgian yeast, and light aromatic herbs. Light body holds the flavor well enough, but becomes a bit foamy. Still, immensely drinkable and enjoyable; I had the entire bottle and would probably have another were it in the house."
"cheres..."
"This is the third or so time I've had this beer, and it's the first time I can say I've really enjoyed it. All I can say is that this is a good one if you give it a chance."
" Hail to the gnome!"
"D - Yet anouther sleepy Belgian pale, lacking in character."
"Appears misty pale yellow in colour with a large white fluffy head and plenty of lacing. Aroma is spicy, fruity and yeasty. The flavour is fruity (apples, pears, bananas, citrus fruits), yeasty, and complex. Tastes of spicy, citrusy, perfumy hops against some sweetish, light malts with a warming finish. Medium bodied. Sparkling and creamy mouthfeel. An excellent, complex, strong pale ale."
"Overall- a mediocre Belgium Ale at best not worth the $9!! Too sweet!!"
"La Chouffe is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had, thus the 5. THe flavor never gets old and it is so complex that you almost discover another nuance each time you drink some. The alcohol doesn't rear its head either which allows you to think you could go all night with this one."
"33 cL brown bottle. Light golden amber with plenty of floating particulates (yeast? spices? I poured *very* slowly...). Fluffy white head that soon dissipates. Aroma is strong spicy citrus and yeast, with underlying caramel malts and bitter greens (mustard, kale, etc.) Mellow sweet peach flavor, bready with a pleasant vegetable taste. Mineral finish and an aftertaste like salted sweet peas. Very intriguing! Satisfying creamy mouthfeel and medium body. Would pair nicely with a midday meal."
"Pours a five-finger+ white head that goes slowly leaving a good lace pour this very slooowly. Nearly clear, pale amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Spicey nose. Starts sweet and smooth, mellow finish some yeast in the background. $10.95 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall - A top notch Belgian ale.... one of the best. Highly recommended..."
"An all-round good beer. If you like strong blondes, it's a must try."
"750 ml capped bottle pours a clear yellow orange color with lots of floating yeast particles, huge frothy off white lasting head, leaves nice clingy sheets of lace in my glass. Sweet and malty, spicy yeasty aroma. Sweet sugary flavors of pears, lemons and spicy cloves. Medium bodied with a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering sweetness."
"You can drink this one all night long and at 8% you'll be feeling it. Reminds me a lot of some of the better tripels like St. Bernardus, certainly not a bad thing."
"M&D: very light on the palate making it so easy to drink, yet the drawback is that it turns a bit watery and thin as the beer warms up and the rich flavour dissipates... overall, this is a medium-bodied Belgian pale ale so light as well as delicious despite its high alc. strength. Very solid and enjoyable!!"
" The taste is of not too sweet lemoncake, wheat like malt, and grassy hops. Some spiciness at finish, along with some yeast. Mouthfeel is light and almost frothy. 750ml is no problem."
"This is another one of those Belgians that I just haven't gotten around to trying until the other night at the Publick House. It's really good too. Kind of on the golden side for a Belgian pale, cloudy, with a big head. Looks nice in the little gnome glass. Smell and taste are all over the place and pretty complex, while not overwhelming. Sweet spicy notes take over, clashing with the herbal whispy hops. Yeasty and estery, dough-like, with some nice almost citrusy or slightly sour qualities that sort of remind me of a nice saison. Definately an interesting beer. I'd like to try it in the bottle some time, because I think that sort of conditioning seems to do these kinds of beers a lot of good. Either way, this is an excellent beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: Ahhh... the classic La Chouffe. While it may not be the best beer in the world, this one is a keeper. Full of flavor and complexity, but still one you could consume for a while. Definitly worth a try..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Nice, medium activity that doesn't interfere whatsoever with the pleasant tastes. Thick and rolling in the mouth, this is one solid Belgian. A bit strong for a second helping, but nevertheless a very drinkable brew. Two thumbs up!"
"pale orange with bubbles moving upwards for quite some time after pouring, with a rocky head like meringue (sp?) or whipped egg whites. Smells of yeast and orange zest. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a quick light spritz in the middle. Smooth taste with a zesty ""wang"" of citrus and yeast. The middle is downright juicy with tropical fruit; finishes dry. Truly lovely and very refreshing and drinkable."
"Notes: After trying La Chouffe I am a little disappointed as BSPAs are my favorite style and after seeing the high overall score I was looking forward to this one. However I'm sure my displeaure is simply a matter of personal opinions as many other more experienced BA's have rated this one high. All in all quite different and a beer I'm sure many enjoy. The flavor and lack of a lasting head, however, don't do it for me. Will probably try again to see if I got a bad bottle."
"11.2 oz. brown glass bottle, best before the end of 2006 on the bottle. Pours a hazt gold color with some sediment and carbonation visible towards the bottom of the chalice. Head is large and creamy, very good retention and lacing. Very nice belgian yeast woody funk in the nose, alcohol and spices also present. Taste is absolutely crisp and clean, lots of malt backbone, good yeast and subtely fruity flavors. Alcohol also adds some more body to this excellent beer. Mouthfeel is spot on. I could've drank a 750 mL of this, but unfortunately I only had a 330 mL. I will definitely get more next time."
"Vive La Chouffe!"
"This one is sort of a cloudy golden orange in colour. Horse blanket aromas dominate, with notes of citrus, mild malt, and yeast. The flavors are surprisingly mild, but in a good way. There is an interesting spice/citrus interplay and the body is fuller than expected. I would have liked a bit more of a hop presence, but who am I to argure ? This stuff is still wicked good!"
"Seems like it could be better with a bit of age, a little young, but a very good beer."
"ive gone with a 5 for drinkability, but a 750 would be best enjoyed in moderation, or shared. this is so easy to drink it could get dangerous."
"Viva La Chouffe!"
"This is a most drinkable beer and I highly recommend it. Very refreshing."
"The carbonation gives this one an almost champagne like mouthfeel. Very clean. A good one to pair with a cheese and fruit plate."
"Smells like a lager; smells like ""beer"". This wasn't nearly as fragrant or spicy as I expected or would have liked. All in all, this reminds me of what I remember of Duvel. This is practically a high class malt liquor or a strong euro lager. Pretty well balanced on the whole, very dry and quite drinkable. Not as interesting or complex as I would have liked. This could quite possibly convert a fan a macros but for the money there are many other brews I'd rather have."
"D = Its a bit expensive in Australia."
"What can I say? On tap, served perfectly in the correct glassware in gollem...it doesnt get much better"
"flavor explodes with the first sip into a floral sweetness and a warming burst of alcohol... nice basic hop presence here adds a bit of green to the party. needs some warming time.. (tick,tock).. honey emerges and satisfies nicely. crisp and smooth with some tingle in the cheeks. yeasty, bready quality fills me up like a nice hunk of artisan bread. a bit hot for 8.0%, and that's the only negative i can even fathom in this beer. one of two beers that hooked me on craft brews and a goodbyeohio staple. near perfect."
"Notes: A great Belgian Strong pale for the summer. Like a saison with some spice."
"Mouthfeel is good at first,creamy, but flattens more than i would expect as the session progresses. Very tasty, but the alcohol hinders its drinkability somewhat."
"I took the cap off a 750ml of this beer, and I instantly remembered the last time I had a sip, several months ago. THis pour to a finely bubbled, giant white foamy head, and a beautiful yellow-orange color. There is a taste of apples and coriander at the start, and the first few sips have a hoppy ""rust"" taste to them, which recedes as you polish of the pint and a half. This has a bitterness which is not unwelcomed. The bottle says ""spiced"" and certainly this does not mean nutmeg, cinnamon or clove. There is a floral nose with a definite citrus and lemony quality. There is some great drinkability, and even though it is not as creamy as Duvel or delirium tremens, for instance, it has a peppery spice. that makes it a beer to return to bottle after bottle."
"Looking forward to brewing with this yeast."
"A solid thick looking dark orange, carbonation and particles floating around. It vaguely reminds me of an underwater scene in the frigid climes... except beer. The nose is spiced oranges and cinnamon to me, almost like mulled wine ingredients before they're added to wine. Yeasty, thick, a bit of spice, some hop... no real kick to it though. Not as much as I'd expect from the visuals and nose. Certainly complex and good tasting but nothing outstanding (at least in the bottle form). The feel is thick and juicy, it makes me want more regardless. Near perfect except for this sligh oily sensation it leaves behind that I can't place. Obsurdly drinkable for the content."
"Difficult to find anything wrong with this wonderful beer."
"The mouthfeel is a bit spicy and medium bodied. Drinkability is merely average, especially considering the high ABV. Overall, this beer was a bit of a disappointment, especially considering that I loved the McChouffe. If you can get both, try the Mc first, and don't feel too guilty if you manage to skip this one, IMO."
"Notes: Addictive taste, if you can get it without the skunk."
"Took a little while to warm up to this beer, but I'm glad I stuck with it. First impression (served too cold, I'll admit) was that it was too sweet, the spicing heavy-handed and the alcohol too prominent at the front. As I worked my way through the bottle (and it warmed), the beer's complexity came through, the sweetness receded and the spices sorted themselves out, with coriander and orange peel taking the lead. Surprisingly, as the beer warmed, the alcohol became less strident in character and integrated into the flavor profile. By the end of the beer, I was liking it quite a bit."
"Drinkability- Hello summer beer! Great job on this one. Full of scent and flavor."
"Drinkability: Great; very tasty and smooth. This is an absolute textbook BSPA, which is a bit of a curse: it's SO by-the-books that it's hard to get too excited about it. It's an excellent beer, and I've scored it as such, but at the same time, it's not going to change your life. If you've never had a Belgian beer, this would be a great place to start."
"I find myself craving a nice Belgian Strong more often than not these days and La Chouffe has successfully reminded me that my quest to find these beers should continue. Definitely worth looking for this one."
"Poured into a big Burgundy glass. Cloudy, hazy peach color with a large foamy head. Gobs of bubbles. Smell was clove and spices and yeast and candy. This beer was wonderful. Spiciness, carbonic bite, and Belgian yeasty flavor are perfectly mixed. This is a gorgeous beer with a complex flavor profile that is oh so easy to drink. Rivals its more well known style partner, Duvel. Excellent beer."
"Looks nice, smells nice, Tastes good. I think I'll let the next bottle sit a little longer though."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer from the bottle, but is absolutely a ""can't miss"" on tap! My first bottle was a disappointment, but who knows how long it had been on the shelf. Later bottles were much better."
"750 ml crown capped silk screened bottle. Purchased at Total Wine in Chesapeake, VA."
"Thick foamy white head on top of a golden yellow pour. Fruity delicious notes in the nose on top of a bit of sweetness and yeast. Flavor is full of herbal and fruit flavors, most notably some apple and a bit of pear backboned by some sweet vanilla flavors. Dry on the mouth as it finishes smoothly. One of the better beers I've had in a while, and certainly one I'll go back to when I want something with a bit of a punch that still leaves a fairly light impression on the tongue."
"One final piece of advice, be very careful with food pairings on this beer. Pair it with something light or you'll miss out on all of the subtleties it offers."
"A nice change of pace from the rash of rounder, sweeter Belgians that I have been drinking lately. It had a cutting sharpness that ripped right through the sweetness that did little more than provide balance. Its biggest detriment was that the alcohol came through a little too strong at times."
"La Chouffe is a complex, well-crafted Belgian ale, a fine example of the strong pale ale. Dangerously drinkable, this is now one of my favorites and I'll be on the lookout for the rest of the Brasserie d'Achouffe line."
"This was my first experience with a unfiltered/unpasterized ale and I certainly was very impressed! It was so very cloudy that I held it up to the light I saw the sediment floating around in it but dont let its different appearance fool this is one high class ale one of the best I've had and continue to drink."
"Nice and fizzy and smooth on the tongue. Tasty and delicious."
"Pours a pale cloudy orange with a thick foamy head with diminishes to a layer of bubbles and leaves foam down the glass. Subtle nose of spices and hint of malts. The taste is of spices, some cloves, malt and hints of peach and apricot. A lovely effervescent mouthfeel. A very nice Belgian pale ale. Very complex yet subtle flavours. I'm certainly going to be coming back to this one."
"Good strong pale ale, I'll have to try this again somewhere down the road."
"Poured from a 750 ml capped green magnum, best before date on the label says 2007. Bought with the Chouffe gift pack, so of course I poured it into the accompanying La Chouffe stemware. A deep hazy gold in colour, quite brilliant in its lustre for a hazed beer, with a massive sponge-like head that maintains impressive retention, I almost need a shovel to make a path through it to the actual beer. There is a very mild aroma, but it seems to draw me in with every inhale, a lot of complexity to something so subtle. Lemon and tangerine zest, bubblegum esters, fresh grass, and then the spices: coriander, black pepper, some nutmeg, and even cinnamon to my surprise. The flavour is light and refreshing, the mouthfeel is effervescent. This is quite an uplifting beer, I'm sampling this after an unsavory day at work, and it has completely managed to perk me up. Light grains and yeast at first, with a quick appearance of orange sweetness in the middle, then gaining some bulk on the finish with the spices, first coriander and cloves, with black pepper lingering on the aftertaste. I really didn't know what to expect with this, as the McChouffe didn't impress me much. I've certainly been missing out this past while in this case. As inexplicably annoying as I find gnomes, I can easily overlook that personal bias when it comes to La Chouffe, I'll definitely be picking more up, I can't remember the last time a new beer cheered me up so much."
"Drinkability is high. The ABV is not really noticeable so I suggest sharing with friends to keep yourself off the floor."
"Outstanding. The mild spiciness reminds me of Unibroue (Don de Dieu in particular). Bright and fizzy, nice aroma starts it off. Smooth and refreshing, matched up well with the steak and shrimp we had for dinner. Doesn't have quite the tartness of a saison, but pretty similar in taste. I've seen this many times, and I'm glad I finally tried it."
"A nice way to mark my 300th attempt at a review. Here's to many more!"
"I can't believe I drank the whole bottle. I opened it with the intention of sharing, but had to go it alone. This is a very refreshing beer. A well balanced thirst quencher. I recommend sharing this with friends, if you have to :-)"
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a towering white that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a refreshing pale malt scent with a wonderfully fruity and tart Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is outstanding. It has a very smooth pale malt flavor with a dry, yet fruity finish. It goes down easy and finishes a bit warm, but nothing too harsh. This is an easy drinker. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate to good carbonation. This is an excellent Belgian. It has great aroma and taste, an excellent sessions brew."
"After trying Duvel ,I knew that Belgians had won a permanent place in my fridge, La Chouffe has made even more room. The thick ,pillowy head was a wonderful sight and the lacing did not quit.A little citrus, orange it seemed to me,combined with that peppery undertone...yeah.. that's the stuff.And the carbonation was fantastic.It's right up there with Duvel, though I find Duvel just a bit smoother.Definitely another fun brew."
"nice ale!"
"I had this on-tap at Eulogy. Large, creamy head. This beer has a nice, estery character, but it could be so much more. Bottle-conditioned would be the preferred way to go with this one. Very good on-tap. I would assume it would have much more complexity in the bottle. In my mind's eye, I picture that tasting wonderfully. A lot of Belgian beers are that way. Remember, on-tap is not always better."
"Bright mildly hazy gold with a thin white head and champagne bubbles. No lace on the glass (the only negative I can write at this time). Aroma of bright citrus, a little hop flower maybe grass. Not much lace. Bright citrus tang on the flavor a little hop bitterness. I was a little surprised to see this listed as a Belgian Pale rather than a gold ale. Nice light mouth feel very drinkable. Excellent beer. The d'Achouffe brewery does it again."
"Really a nice Belgian blonde/triple/golden or whatever you choose to call it. Definitely one of the finest beers from the brewery."
"Folks, this is a keeper! It truly is an artisanal beer and one that everyone should be able to enjoy!"
"A great brew. I could drink this all night. The first belgian I really loved."
"Good beer, the next time I see it I'll be sure to bring some home."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep gold color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell has lots of lemon and lime going on. It's slightly sweet as well. The taste is also sweet, with more citrus fruit coming through. A very pleasant flavor. The mouthfeel is decently thick and strong. The drinkability is great for an 8% brew. A damn fine beer. Thanks to Christina for this one, she made a wonderful selection."
"My lovely wife brought this beer to the beer tasting. She's trying really hard to get into beer so that she understands what I'm talking about with flavors and aromas. I really respect her for taking interest in my hobby, and respect her choice of beer, as this was a champ. The beer poured a yellow color with golden hues and a strong one finger head that wouldn't go away for anything. The nose was full of lemony and peppery notes wtih a really sweet background. I think this would be nice to marinade some chicken. The flavor was nice sweet lemon that finished peppery and spicey and refreshing. The feel was moderate with a nice creamy texture. Damn what a fine beer. I will be visiting this one again in the summer, but I don't think I'll share my bottle."
"Pouring from the 750 ml bottle into a chalice glass, the beer is indeed cloudy, as the bottle states. Cloudy despite being vertically stored in my cellar for 2 weeks, and poured without disturbing the lees. Interesting. Honeyed, wheat, orange browns, with a whipped cream white head, tight and small bubbled. Screen lacing that ever so slowly dissipates. Tiny bits of sediment are visible in the beer. Wow, another incredible aroma from Chouffe. Mild but extremely appetising fruits up front, clean fresh bread, baked sweet cinnamon rolls, definite cinnamon itself, spicy herbs, some metallic notes once it has warmed a little, sweet icing sugar, a cranberry or pomegranate seed tartness. Some detergent soapiness, and clove. Taste is not strong at all, but extremely flavourful. Lightly roasted malt in the front, faint smoked hints. In the middle are some wheat notes, and also some coriander, similar to a good wit. Some orange marmalade in the finish, and grapefruit; this is by far one of the most complex beers for fruit flavours. Definite orange flavours, and even a hint of lemon peel. Only faintly could I detect the alcohol in the taste, but in the feel it is most definitely there--warming and smooth. The aftertaste is mainly sweet and phenolic, hops only peeking their heads through on the sides of the tongue, and balancing this beer so it is not overly sweet. Their role here is balance, not flavour. The mouthfeel is exceptional, cream-filled, foamy and medium-bodied. This is one 8% brew I could drink quite happily through an entire night, without it becoming too overpowering. Undeniable drinkability marks. This would pair splendidly with a dry cheese, or aged cheddar. Nuts of all sorts would accompany this nicely as well."
"This beer pours a flourescent golden color with a medium airy white head. A small layer of foam lies above the liquid. Smell is spicy and earthy. Taste begins fairly basic but the further I go the deeper and more complex. Lots of noticeable pale malts and a light crisp body upfront. Coriander and orange peel seem to come in and mix well with the malts. The yeast is interesting and seems to be more flavorful the more I drink it. Finish is light, dry, and semi-fruity. Not a real sweet beer but not real dry either, this one has a good balance. Flavors are delicate but work nicely. I've drank this beer twice and both times I get a flavor that I can't put my finger on and I think its from the yeast strain. I guess I'll just have to keep drinking it until I figure it out!"
"I've had La Choufee a number of times, and it never disappoints. The complex flavor and golden color are hard not to love. This is truly one of the best Belgian ales available today."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle with a golden orange color and a frothy white head. The aroma is fruity and fresh with a yeast smell. The nose is also bready with the smell of rosated sunflower seeds. The flavor is crisp and malty with afruity diesters all the way through. It's clean on the palate and does not get too sticky on the palate."
"Pours a slightly dark orange red with a thick tall head. Smells of fruit and spice. First sip is slightly sweet ending with a background of spice and slight bitterness. Finishes dry. The flavors are ok but too much spice is in the background and not enough flavor in the middle. Not one of the best I've had, but it was ok."
"The 8% abv is very well hidden given how light this beer feels on the palate. I'm glad that I gave this a try, but nothing really blew me away enough to have it again."
"Nice appearance; both in and out of the botle. Nice and white foam but not clear sight under it. Fine nose but too much fruityness of koreander in it. Nice taste, lots of fruit but again a sweet koreander taste. Further a clean and litle bitter aftertaste. Easily drinkable and wouldn't mind drinking more than just one 75 cl botle at once on a nice warm evening. But in my eyes too spicy and misses bitteness to make to one of the best in this category."
"Effervescent, lively yellow-ish beer with a big head. A little hazy but fairly clear. Aggressively aromatic! Lemon, mashed peaches, and a certain spicy crispness. The level of spiciness in this beer that I can't even begin to discern the varied flavors -- orange peel, peach, lemon, coriander, cinnamon, yeast... They form a sort of Belgian beer yogurt with this beer's creamy mouthfeel. There's a lot going on here. Maybe too much so -- but there's no hint of the 8% anywhere to be found. This beer begs to be shared so everyone can experience the job -- and so the original drinker doesn't go into some sort of spice coma. Intense."
"Biting hops and alcohol, bitter orange peel and cloves. I almost thought grapefruit?? Tart feeling. Sort of lame dry mouth, notes of grapefruit (definitely this time), pomegranite. Tart feeling. A little heavy."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden color with a huge eggshell white head. Spicy, honey-like aromas; lemon zest, pepper and the fiantest hint of spearmint leaves. Fairly yeasty and hoppy as well. Drinks with the crispness a pilsener, but it's a lot stronger. Initially malty and sweet on the tongue, and then immediately gets spicy and dry. Carbonic acid notes from higher carbonation level. Wonderfully earthy, like a spring meadow after a shower. I think I've tried it enough times to say that it's a ""classic""."
"Ah my first Chouffe beer. It poured a cloudy golden (yes I poured the yeast in as well). With a large 3 finger white head that had massive staying power and also left a nice lacing down the side of my glass. Nose is full of spice; cinnamon and clove notes dominate the aroma. Taste is nicely balanced. A little hoppy bite balances out the clove-like spiciness of this beer. Alcohol is hardly detectable. Finishes slightly sweet as well. Mouthfeel is good, almost over-carbonated. A very solid beer and I'm looking forward to more Chouffe products as soon as I can find them."
"Bottle: Poured an hazy blonde ale with a huge bubbly white head. Aroma is quite spicy with yeast also discernable. Taste is very refreshing with again strong spices (pepper?) and a yeasty finish. Good body and alcohol is not noticeable. This beer represent a quality example of a strong blonde Belgian ale, one can never go wrong with this one."
"Beery, arid grain flavors provide weight and chew while lyrical elements of pepper, mace and pollen scurry across the mid-palate. The finish is quenching and floral, with a distinct citrus blossom quality. Sun-ripened gold."
"Flavor is initially sharp and acidic with a growing tropical fruit dance with a very crisp co2 bite to battle the alcohol, coconut, pineapple flavors off the palate."
"The head was disappointing and the color more intense than just ""blonde", showing some orange notes. The beer is very nicely hoppy and peppery, very round and pleasant on the palate. Slightly sweet, very drinkable, although the alcohol gets noticeable and warming. I don't have much to say about this beer. Just a very good strong Belgian ale. Very interesting as a whole, but I don't have that much to say in details...next time maybe."
"Excellent brew to quaff as the feel is slightly silky and not at all sticky, and would be high on my list of summer indulgences."
"A contemplative selection. Perhaps a raisin dressing stuffed bird would find its perfect match with this seductive gnome. Who would have thought?"
"The beer poured a nice bubbly gold that developed a fine white head. The aroma was of alcohol and fruit with hints of malt. The taste was a pleasantly sweet strong ale with a nice maltiness to it, and a definate alcohol bite. The feel was thick and carbonated, with a bit of a dry bitter finish that went well with the fruitiness of the beer. I found this to be extremely enjoyable, and look forward to the next one."
"Rounded alcohol taste up front. Sweet malt with hints of apple and pear on the back of your tongue. Lightly dry and somewhat sour. A nice hoppy flaovr in there as well. A bit sticky but really light and smooth for 8% ABV. Very drinkable and tasty. Haven't had this in awhile and it's great to have it back."
"Paid 2.49 for a single. This is my first experience with the happy gnome, who provides me first with a sparkling golden liquid that froths so much the 1/2"" head quickly becomes 2"" of head. Smells strangely like homebrew gone bad (it's not pasteurized), sort of metallic and resinous. Tastes real good though, mellow, not spiced like the label claims. All in all a good brew, with hidden alcohol so you can quaff this one pretty good, but be careful."
"Pours a clear deep gold color. It is well carbonated and holds up a fluffy off white head. The aroma is dry, spicy, herbal, and lemony, with some subtle notes of coriander. The taste is dry up front with a slight bit of clean acidity. There is a nice clean spiciness and an accompanying bitterness in the finish which really sets this beer off. The herbal character is in the taste as well, which perhaps contributes a bit of astringency, and there is a certain lemon like character here as well. As this beer warms up it develops a certain sweetness and a hint of vanilla up front. It has a very simple, clean malt character, from the Pilsner malt, that contributes just a hint of maltiness that reminds me of lightly toasted biscuits. This is a really nice beer, it is quite clean, and could perhaps use a bit of complexity, but the hopping levels, malt, and yeast character create a beautiful balance that works very well. Actually the more this warms up and the more I contemplate it the more I am enjoying this beer."
"First impression-the model for a Unibroue. The licensed Quebec version is a harsh echo of it. The real thing is citrus, yes corriander and pepper, some yeast. Great floral smell. Terrific hops. A great over-the-top head that never quits. The beer that I can get people to switch from champagne."
"The beer after releasing its grip on the dark green 750ml bottle sets in the glass a slightly hazy gold color with a massive bright white head that creamy in texture, with the resultant lace a thin slip to cover the glass. The nose is fruity, sweet and a slight yeast tone also noticed, lemon-lime crispness seals it off with the start is delightfully sweet, delectable are the malts, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is biting in its acidity, the hops perfect in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, and I must say this is my favorite Brasserie d'Achouffe beer to date."
"Sampled 3/25/04"
"This is a nice beer that I will be seeking out again. The flavors and aromas have created a truly wonderful driniking experience."
"I'm not a big fan of Belgian beer, but perhaps I just haven't had the right ones yet. La Chouffe won't make me forswear my beloved IPAs, but it is pretty tasty. I'm glad that I picked up two bottles."
"This brew is a cloudy golden color, white foam head on the top. Good lacing left on the glasss. Some fruit and alcohol on the nose. As for the taste, it has a nice, light feel to it. Some tropical fruit tastes, light, sweet malts, touch of hops. Quite a nice, refreshing drink."
"11.2 oz bottle, Gnome thing going on the label. Pours light cloudy orange, chunky yeast floating around., yeasty,slight medicinal nose, creamy white head, leave nice lacing. Complex, fruity,spicy, multiple flavors floating around. light body, very smooth and pleasant mouthfeel. (I like the feel of this stuff in my mouth)warming and strong, classy stuff. I love this style, goes great with food and a nice warm sunny afternoon. Seek out and enjoy."
"Nothing extraordinary here, but a nice, drinkable Belgian nonetheless."
"Another brew from Firewaters in Atlantic City. Bummed about the pint glass serving, but the brew still tastes very nice. I get a slightly hazy golden color with a soft fluffy white head. Aroma is good and spicy with some cloves and coriander dominating. No real hop presence. First sip reveals a very light bodied brew with almost no carbonation. Flavor is crisp and refreshing, with citrus notes and very easy to drink. No hop bitterness present in the flavor either. No hints of alcohol anywhere to be found. This is quite a tasty brew that would be very enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"I was suprised to find this on tap nearby. I stopped in for a glass this afternoon. A slight bit pricey, but it's to be expected. It came in a Leffe glass ? I guess that's better than a pint glass, but I'd still like a true tulip for appearance's / smell's sake. This beer is a nice golden, with a frothy inch head of white lace. The smell is very fruity, lemon, with a prickle of hops and spice. The taste was quite good also. The malts are there, in a small way as this beer feels very light on the palate. I could tell there was some alcohol in it, but without remembering I would not have said 8% abv. Clean and very nicely balanced. There is a good interplay of clove and corriander with the hops which really show themselves on tap. I think that from the bottle, the beer has more of a esteric sweetness whereas fresh on tap the beer asserts itself with more pronouced spices and hopfeel. I thought this was quite refreshing and very drinkable. Price sort of hurts, but that shouldn't stop you if you find it on tap. Well worth it, at least for one. Great !"
"The flavor was pleasant. I would have this again."
"Definitely a unique beer...one of the rare Belgians with a noticable hop taste to it, and uses the coriander just right and doesn't kill the beer. This is one I'd definitely have again."
"Poured a light honey color with a fizzy white head. Smell is light, airy, with a heavy coriander/citrus/lemony finish. Taste hits with a hint of citrus and light malts, followed by a brief brush with alcohol, and a heavy-handed zesty herbal finish. Mouthfeel is not very light for a strong golden ale, but is certainly not devastating. A great beer, but really heavy on the spices."
"On tap at Le Porte Noire in Brussels (They were out of St. Bernardus ABT12 on draught...argh!). This was a nice deep golden colour with a fluffy white head of foam. The aromas are all about the fresh floral smells, and zesty hops. The taste is floral, fresh, hoppy, and zesty and spicy as well. In fact this reminds me of a saison, more than a belgian strong pale ale. This is actually more refreshing, zestier, and spicier on tap. The mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and the drinkability is very good. I highly recommend trying this beer on tap, it really seems that the flavors meld together, and make this brew even better than it is in the bottle!"
"La Chouffe proved much better than I had anticipated, given the description at the bar. I would be interested to see how this fares from a bottle."
"Pours a rich golden color with a nice rocky head that becomes a little creamy with some nice lacing,aroma is lighter than expected some spiciness with a hint of some grassiness.Taste is citruisy with a more subdued spicieness again with a grassy hop that comes thru in the finish.It almost has a creamy mouthfeel its a refreshing beer for the alcohol content a nice beer but there are better out there of the style I think."
"Long Love Beer!"
"Pours a cloudy golden/orange with a lively and large white head. The nose is pleasantly fruity sweet and highlighted by hints of bubble-gum, orange peel and spice. The taste offers a fine balance between fruity sweetness and light hop bitterness on the finish. The spice comes through nicely down the middle. A very lively and full mouthfeel but yet failry light bodied. The aftertaste lingers nicely and maintains it's orange peel bitterness. A pleasant and easy drinking Belgian. Top notch."
"Pours a murky ""peppered"" golden with a good head that fizzes away with a little bit of lacing. Smell is subdued sweetness with some peach and light spices. Taste is smooth and also subdued, this beer is spiced with what is most likely corriander, but it is very delicate. Alcohol is present, but is definitely deceptive. The mouthfeel is full and smooth with a nice crispness to the finish. Overall, I'm used to a lot more flavor from a belgian strong pale ale, but this was actually a nice change. Belgian at heart, but with a mellow mood, I would have no problem finishing an entire 750ml bottle of this (or two)."
"Drinkability is ok."
"750ml in La Chouffe glass: Dark blond color, very big foamy head that sticks well to the glass. Aroma of spices and herbs, hay field, almost like a saison with that hop profile. Taste of coriander, orange, perhaps flowers with a balanced mild farmhouse bitterness, flowery. Just very good in all aspects and actually quite complex."
"La Chouffe, in my opinion, would be a good late spring beer. Poured a nice thick head and it look like it's going to have a nice full body taste to it. Lots of floating yeast in this thing. Smell consists of citrus and some spiciness along with it. Taste is quite good. Some spiciness in there, then some apricot/peach/honey kicks in, quite good. You can taste and feel the alcohol in this thing but you can't feel the whole 8.0% on it. It poured a full body but it tasted like it was a medium body beer. I don't know, maybe it's me but it's missing a little something in there. But nevertheless, it's a good, decent brew. But if you're looking for a belgian ale, go to Duvel instead. But I would recommend this beer."
"Update 4/14/14: Nice four packs for affordable prices with short stubby bottles make this one more approachable nowadays, nice to see it's being imported into the states into Ommegang/Duvel Moortgat in Cooperstown, NY. Pours slightly hazed honey golden body with a bright effervescent white head, fine Belgian lace forms on the sides of my glass. Aroma spicy yeast, cereal grains medicinal at times but not overly boozed up. This seems to be in higher production than back in 2004 when I first reviewed it and back in 2001 when I enjoyed it at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto, Canada on tap for the first time. My love affair with Belgian ale is still intact but nothing like it was when I first got into beer, to me a lot of their beers tend to have a lot of sweetness compared to American crafts that I enjoyed more 10 to 13 years ago. Now I'm a full fledged hophead that can still respect one of the beers that really helped get me hooked. The cereal grains come across on the palate with loads of coriander and other spices, black pepper, a hint of pear, a bit of alcohol comes through with the 8% abv, very balanced and well appreciated for what it is. If you need more hops just grab an Houblon Chouffe instead of La Chouffe you'll be glad you did. Tomahawk, Amarillo, there's one other variety of American high alpha acid hops that they use in that brew. Mouthfeel is effervescent the carbonation is a bit much for me but I can still appreciate the flavors it carries along some of the residual sugars left behind in fermentation much better with the higher carbonation. Overall I'm still a fan boy of beer in general and can appreciate pretty much any style, but La Chouffe was a beer that I held in high regards because of the enjoyment and experiences with friends I had when I found this on a weekend trip into Canada with some college dorm mates back in early 2000s."
"The mouthfeel is crisp while being a medium bodied beer. Clean finishing, as the coriander lingers very softly after swallowing. Nice carbonation levels as plenty of tiny bubbles were rising through the drink. Extremely drinkable as the alcohol level is not noticeable at all."
"Hazy orange amber pour into the goblet. White head quickly becomes delicate ring and island lacing. Big Nose of floral and citrus, knocks you back a couple of feet. Pine, lemon, hay, and orange zest occupy the nose. Taste is a balance of sweet and crystal malt, melding with some outstanding hops(Saaz?).. Mouthfeel is very pleasant. It's hard to go wrong with a good Belgian."
"Pours very, very yeasty with big clumps floating around in the glass--not the most appetizing presentation, IMO. A huge white rocky head, with bubbles ranging from medium to tiny and dense, slowly subsides with scattered clumping. Color ranges from near-coppery at center to honeyish at edges of glass; all very hazy. Good carbonation with a few vigorous streamers. Aroma is super smooth, with golden lemon rinds; champagney in middle; hay and lemon pulp; the typical Saaz hoppiness; with the imagination running wild I find pine, butter, marijuana... Flavor? Just great. Light bready yeast, big coriander and a nice hop tingle suggesting rosemary or even bay(?); lots more lemon zest. At cooler temperatures, champagne flavors abound; with warmth, mandarin orange emerges in the front palate that melds wonderfully into a green apple tartness. Complex! Mouthfeel is so nice and smooth: slightly tingly and full; soft alcoholic foam; great lip-smacky tart goes to creamy and then swings back to dry. Oh so nice. Drinkability: 4.5, there you go. Why do I love Belgian Strong Golden Ale? This is."
"Pours a nice golden with a huge white head that lasts. Fairly spicy aroma with musty yeast. Taste is fairly peppery and spicy. This leads to a peachy flavor. Light hoppy presence as well. Mouthfeel is very dry and effervescent - almost like a champagne. Leaves very little aftertaste. Not bad, but not entirely what I was expecting flavor-wise. Not as much going on as I would have liked. Still, pretty good."
"Overall: This is a very nice and enjoyable brew. It is steep in price ($8.00 for a 1pt.9.4 floz) but we all need to spoil ourselves every once in a while. This brew is easy to sit back and enjoy and not worry about anything until your finished with it. A must to try!"
"A very likable product from one of the smaller Belgian brewing concerns that I fully admire."
"A solid Golden Ale with no faults, but just not that many superior features. Nice but expensive. Ill stick with Duvel until this drops in price."
"Sampled on tap at the Landmark 1850 Inn. Served in a La Chouffe tulip-styled glass. Ale has a golden amber appearance with a thick fluffy white head. Light-bodied with a pleasant crispness to it from the carbonation. Complex flavor combines a sweet bready maltiness, citrusy tartness, yeast and spices for a wonderfully smooth offering. Hop balance is right on target. 8% alcohol is barely noticable. Definitely meant to be savored and enjoyed."
"One of the best that I've had. This is simply a great beer that provides so much in every dimension as to almost overwhelm. The look is great with its lovely honey color and full, rich head and lacing. The nose is great giving off lovely aromas of citrus fruit, spice, and malt. This complexity follows in the flavor which simultaneously gives citrus fruit, spice, pepper and malt caramel sweetness with a tart overlay. The feel is light for such a full body owing to the lovely carbonation balanced by the creamy body. Dangerously drinkable given the ABV."
"Hazy pale peachy-honey gold hue, large white head with an apex of almost two fingers. Excellent retention, a solid cap lasted throughout consumption, very minimal lace though. The nose is very inviting with whiffs of pears and apples, pepper and alcohol, kind of tart, a solid does of hops too (Saaz I believe). Good potency. The taste on this ale is divine! So mellow, so complex, so engaging the carbonation is much lower than many of its brothers, this only embellishes the flavor profile. The malt is so well developed it almost steals the show, it provides a distant but solid stage to let the hops dance allover it, pleasantly spicy, tart, mildly bitter in spots, some suggestions of a Wit... oh, what a palate! Sharp, acidic finish. Soft, medium body. 8% abv? Bullshit I could not taste a hint of alcohol, very well hidden. This beer is not as assertive as Duvel but it has such unique qualities that make it very memorable. Highly Recommended."
"The beer was felt light in the mouth with a wonderful drinkability. It called out for another. Overall, a very good to excellent beer of the Begian Strong Pale Ale type."
"Drinkability  This is classic BSPA. Its a little too spicy for my taste, but on-style nevertheless."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a decent white head and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a little spicy with lots of citrus and hints of alcohol. Very nice. Flavor represents the spice and citrus with plenty of other great Belgian characters. A little yeasty and very very tasty. This has become one of my favorite standard Belgian ales. The body is dead on and the drinkability is excellent."
"This Chouffe was dying to get out of the bottle. The head is full and strong and maintains its presence throughout. It has a fine lace that clings to the glass, and an amber/golden color. La Chouffe has a great combination of effervescence and creaminess that adds an interesting character to the mouth feel and the taste. The smell is earthy and fruity with a hint of apples and pears. Taste is a complex and somewhat subtle mix of sweet and bitter that makes it very drinkable and not overwhelming. I have had in on tap and from the bottle and have never been disappointed."
"Big green Euro champagne shaped bottle. Shiny yellow pour, golden and bubbly. Huge, clumpy white head explodes on contact with the glass. Sticky lace all the way to the bottom. Smell was a mix of sweet bready maltiness, and some subtle fruit flavors. Taste was dominated by a highly charged bubbly, almost champagne like texture. Cleanses the palate, and left traces of fruit flavors, maybe peaches or apricots. Hints of honey, and cinnamon as well. Nice floral tone, and a very light earthy yeast quality to it. Very drinkable at 8%. Great summer beer, IMO. Would be great with a grilled chicken ceasar salad or something like that. At $6.99 a bottle though, I might be tempted to get 2-3 of something else."
"Fine, frothy white head. Very durable and provides excellent lacing. The beer is golden amber. More clear than I expected. Splendid aroma. Smells of spices and fields. Slight apple taste is a nice partner to the spiciness. Like a good, hot apple pie... except cold. Pleasant mouthfeel. Interesting fuzzy feel. Enjoyed the bottle and will add this to my list of ""one of these will do tonight"" beers."
"Poured (after leaving upright in the fridge for two day's as the beer was just teeming with chunky sediment) a a rich orange/golden with a thick creamy beige head that would not go away. Aromas of caramelized sugar and pine needles start things going. The flavors straight off were of cotton candy, burnt sugar and caramel. Some faint fruitiness in the way banana also were present. The beer was very warming and pleasurable to drink, with an underlying spiceiness adding to the complexity. This is a beer to enjoy very slowly with your favortite music and while sittting in your most comfortable chair. I am amazed at how much sediment this beer contained however. Is this normal for this beer? All in all very interesting and unique."
"Large bottles were always available, but we just got the small bottles in our area. Definitely one of the best Belgian pale ales I have had. It is getting better as I drink it. Oops! It's almost gone."
"Spicy cloves in aroma with a nice underlying sweetness. Orange and spice in the mouth, possibly orange peel, but not quite identifiable. Acidic tang was noticed on back of tongue that may have been due to carbonation. Orange gold in color with visible carbonation. Overall, good but the tang got in the way and the beer wasn't overly complex"
"1Pt 9.4 oz bottle. Poured a hazy golden color, with a descent head that receded quickly, leaving some lacing on the glass. Aroma is of musty straw, citrus, and malt.Taste is earthy and musty. A very different taste for me. There is some sweetness in there, and a slightly bitter finish. You can feel the warmth from the alcohol. This is a little to earthy for me."
"Nice drinkable and tasty brew, would pair well with a variety of milder foods or make a nice contrast to a good spicy pizza."
"The Belgian version is less extroverted, IMHO, but still a great beer!"
"Pours golden yellow with a nice snow-white frothy head. There's yeast floating around in this stuff like crazy, really suspended even after given awhile to settle. Nice extra fruity aroma. The taste carries on fruity, but adds some pepperiness that mellows out the fruitiness. This is definitely a spiced beer,as advertised on the bottle. Nice carbonation in the mouth and very easy to drink, nice & warm going down. I feel this beer could use bit more oomph in the taste department."
"A great beer, I'd say! Though this is deemd a strong pale ale, its spunky but appealing nose and light but enjoyable taste puts it far away from this style's standards (e.g. Duvel). Likably unique in its blend of citrus, coriander, Pilsner malt, and Golding and Saaz hops."
"Effervescent, lightly cloudy golden brew forms a 3"" thick, dense, peaking white head atop medium bubbles with dense solid sheets of lace. Strong carbonation with tons of swirling bubbles. Aroma is of bavarian wheat cloves and mild banana esters, tart applejuice, and while I don't smell lemons, there certainly is an acidic tartness in the aroma. Mouthfeel is crisp and explodes on the tongue with a light body. Taste starts with a dry, grainy, non-hop bitterness, fades into a strong, yet clean alcohol peppery bite, a here-then-gone pale malt background, and ends in a very dry, astringent fruitiness with very subtle fusels and some bready yeastiness. No sourness or Belgian Funk noted. Throw in some Pediococcus and Brett and they have a great beer, but as is, it just doesn't do much for me. A nice little spritzer, but ultimately lacking much character."
"Very nice Belgian Strong, pours a hazy yellow, not quite opaque, with a big frothy head that slowly fades to a nice 1/2 inch. Lace throughout the glass. Aromas of sweet fruit, lemon and spices, most noticably, clove. Some honey and banana noticed in the taste, as well as some spices, nutmeg, and maybe some pepper. A creamy mouthfeel with a slight carbonation that is not overpowering. Very drinkable at 8%, a nice version of the style. Worth seeking out."
"The head froths up to a pillowy dream like cloud when poured into my goblet and settles down to a quarter inch of frothy foam. There is a strong floral aroma mixed in with a lemony - pepper, wheatish smell. The body is a sweet medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. There are many flavors in this beer and some are hidden and hard to pick out but the ones that stand out are lemon, pepper, coriander, heather, and most certainly - clove. Finishes somewhat sweet on the tounge. A great belgian ale that ranks right up their with my favorites. Why did I wait so long to try this?"
"It pours a pretty gold with a fat white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass. It has a slightly lemony smell with just a bit of spice. The taste is fairly light, but everything in it comes together very nicely. The mouthfeel is creamy and it leaves a nice layer of beer and foam on the top lip after each drink. This is a very nice beer."
"Pours a beautiful deep golden color with a frothy white head. The head is quite durable and leaves nice trails of lace down the glass. Aroma is of citrus, yeast, and a touch of spicy hops. Well-balanced and quite tasty overall. Very smooth in the mouth and dangerously drinkable, this is an excellent Belgian ale. Was glad to try La Chouffe on draught, as well."
"What a pleasant suprise when I first poured and tasted this Belgium Beer. The color was of a golden reddish amber color with the aroma of malt, citrus and a hint of spices. The taste was of heaven and I can't say enough about this beer. I guess heaven is one word to use. Smooth and tasty is what I found in this so called 'Strong Ale'. Wish I could find it in smaller bottle's instead of pints!"
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Very sweet aroma. Reddish-gold with a small off-white head. Light spicy-sweet flavor and a clean finish. Not a bad Belgian."
"404"
"Hell of a beer,  Quite the expedition and certainly worth a trek."
"Pours a golden orange color.  Off white head that lastest for a minute or two.  The smell is orange or lemons.  The effervensence kind of explodes in your mouth.  Very warming as it goes down and smooth for a higher ABV beer.  I would like to try this on tap."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice bubbly white head that left trace lace. Some medium carbonation was present. An aroma of citrus and clove was evident. A flavor of citrus, clove and some malt. A somewhat tart finish. A good beer for this style."
"Light golden with a short white head. Mild spicy aromas. Sharp carbonation. Sweet taste, but not over the top; clove spiciness and an apple fruitiness are also present. Warming alcohol on the way down.  A nice choice."
"Big lemon malt nose. Gold color with lots of bubbles and lots of suspended yeast.  Decent head on pour but it is not lasting.  A slight white lace remains in the goblet.  Original taste of citrus hits the tongue.  Predominatly orange and lemon zest notes... then the brew becomes earthy with a slight grassy finish.  The mouth is lively and light.  The beer has great balence and is a wonderful belgian selection for the summer months(or any time).  Highly reccomended."
"I found it to be more palatable than other Belgians, as it didn't have that harsh spicy bite to it. I think many people like that bite, but it becomes too overwhelming for me, so that's why I liked this one more. Had a nice smoky flavor to it as well. A very interesting beer."
"a fine belgian indeed. a nice gloden pour that wants to jump right out of the glass. done just right without an overpowering flavor of alcohol, this brew goes down silky smooth. all in all a high quality strong ale ranking up with the best of em"
"Light amber / dark golden in hue w/ good clarity for style.  Prodigious production of bubbles support the thick, persistent, mountainous, ivory - white head which resembles a topographic map.  The aroma is a balanced combination of honey, ripe tropical fruit sweetness and tarter, slightly underripe pear notes.  Green apple acetaldehyde is mellow and well integrated into the aroma, and complements the tart fruit nicely.  Flavorwise this brew exhibits a fine balance of sweet fruity esters, lightly peppery alcohol, and tart, slightly bitter citrus rind.  Is there Curacao in this brew?  Hop bitterness is mild, yet counters residual sugars enough to completely prevent and cloying sweetness.  Refined bready malt and hints of Coriander become noticeable as the beer warms.  Spot on bodywise, but with a carbonation lower than the norm for style that aids in drinkability.  Finishes a touch sweet, w/ soothing alcohol warmth emerging as an afterthought.  La Chouffe is one of the very best Belgian Strongs I've tasted.  The combination of spices and yeast esters result in an absolutely delicious brew.  The relatively high strength is superbly hidden; the drinkabilty of this fine brew is top notch."
"Puffy and turbulent head, liquid is orange/amber with frosted impenetrability from yeast. Aroma is divine, and impossible to describe; suffice to say it's like, if God was a plant, and this plant was bearing its very first flower. Oh, and the plant was fertilized with alcohol. I would be happy just smelling this beer all night, but that would be downright nutty. Fruits, spices, and warm alcoholic burn in the taste. Other reviews have got some great flavor descriptions. It's the finish that kills me; orange, buttery malts, and a slight dry twang. The spectacular aftertaste goes on forever. This beer would be equally welcome on the Christmas dinner table as on a picnic blanket during a sweltering Sunday afternoon in the park. In a word, great."
"Pours a hazy orangey gold color with a creamy white head that leaves a terrific lace.  Spicy nose, lots of peppery and coriander smells in there as well as about 10 other spices I can't even identify.  Slight bubble gum smells as well.  Sweet candy sugar jumps on the tongue at first and dances around with some juicy fruit flavors.  Grapes, apples, and some mixed citrus flavors are all in there.  Faint hops emerge to give the brew a grassy/hayish quality to it for a short while before the spices take over.  More pepper and some light coriander and again there are several spices I can't even pick up on.  No alcohol is even perceived on the tongue, only the brain notices it.  Creamy and somehow not sticky mouthfeel makes this brew an absolute joy to drink.  Damn, those little gnomes know how to brew some beer.  This is one awesome concoction here."
"I'd probably suggest this as a beer to train oneself on the spicy yeast so common in Belgian beers. The spicey yeast flavor is present in this beer, but not so overwhelmingly so that it would scare off someone unfamiliar with the flavor. Huge carbonation and a big white foamy head top of a nice golden body. The aromas of peppers and peaches dominate and when you take a sip you notice a little lemon mixed in. The alcohol does poke it's head up, but it's not too noticeable. A very good, light beer that's very easy to drink."
"Cloudy golden colour with a thick and creamy white lace. Light bodied and very effervescent that is close to a champagne-like mouth feel. Dry pale malt character with a complex spiciness of clove, cinnamon, black pepper and a light hoppy presence. Burst of peachy fruitiness in the middle that awakes the taste buds from more. Lovely in the bottle but even better on tap."
"Hazy golden brown.  Charged head, bubbles settle out in about 40 seconds or so.  Spicy smell.  Understated but pleasant malt flavors, bit of cinamon and a touch of phenol.  Hop mix of Saaz and Goldings is a first rate balancer in this beer.  Not at all sticky or alcoholic in taste... very drinkable to me.  No sourness.  Low carbonation in the mouthfeel.  Skoal on this one!"
"Hazy golden in color with rich viscous.Light,fruity tropical nose.Light creamy,slight phenolic taste,but pleasent.Love this beer."
"good, but not great, interesting to drink. Spicy coriander flavour aswell, which i liked, you should definietly give it a go."
"thick white foam cresting on a cloudy golden beer, poured into my delirium tulip glass. excellent head retention, and a beautiful smell of coriander and noble hops, with a faint air of alcohol. Crisp in body and definately crisp in taste, heavy yeasty character that is soon shot down by the strong saaz hop character, leaving a pleasant aftertaste of spice and pepper. Already almost finished the whole 25 ounces while writing this... wonderful beer."
"Truly amazing.  Spicy, yeasty, hoppy.  Awesome interpretation of style. Seek it out."
