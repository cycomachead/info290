4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"this is a huge beer, certainly all of the 10 percent abv its listed at, and can feel like a whole lot more in high doses. off blonde, more peach colored beer, with a ton of visible carbonation and just a bit of yeast floating about. tall white head slowly recedes. it smells like belgian yeast all the way, mildy spicy, extremely grassy, and with the acidity of the wine from the barrels its aged in. complex for sure, with notes of peppercorns and yellow corn on the front end, tough to nail down grain bill because of these unique flavors. then the yeast adds an orchard fruit element, maybe green pear, and a lot of carbonation keeps it light for how enormous it really is. a lot of beer in this bottle, with a fair bit of body too. this reminds me of something from ommegang or unibroue, a very authentic but also very creative take on belgian beer. some residual sugar, very fruity, in the finish, and one supremely interesting beer. everything ive had from nebraska brewing has been top notch, i had no idea such cool beer was coming out of there before these ones. close to 20 bucks a bottle in cost for this reserve series stuff, but its darn close to being worth it. these are one of a kind ales here.","StonedTrippin","May 26, 2014"

4.46,8,4.5,4,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a hazy, medium golden amber with a beautiful three finger fine white head with great retention and lacing. Pleasant aroma of white wine, Belgian yeast and faint oak. Flavor is Belgian yeast, light grape, apple and pear juice; oak influence of vanilla and butter, slight tartness, Belgian and earthy spicing, absolutely delicious. Medium bodied with great creaminess. This is one of the best barrel aged Belgian ales I've had and possibly the only wine barrel aged ale that I totally loved. I'm a big fan of whiskey barrel aged ales, but wine barrel ales are often too tart and vinous for my taste. The Belgian ale base of Melange A Trois completely supported the flavors of the vinous oak, and incorporated them excellently. A totally enjoyable ale. This is the first time I've seriously contemplated moving to Nebraska. A fine production.","LiquidAmber","Nov 24, 2013"

Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, earth, wine, wood, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with wine and earthy wood flavors on the finish.

It's hard for me to like wine barrel aged beers since, like I already said, I don't drink/like wine. This is definitely a really good beer though.

Pours a hazy, golden color with a large white head that goes down rather quickly. Scent is spicy at first...spicy Belgian yeast with some pronounced green apples and pear aromas. A little bit of french oak and chardonnay. A bit of lemon as well. Nice nose to this beer. Taste is just as nice, although...I was hoping this beer would be a little sour. Taste is mildly tart green apples and white grapes. A ton of crisp, Belgian yeast flavor...spicy as well. More spicy than I was anticipating, with a good amount of pepper and lemon zest. Some definite french oak and chardonnay flavors, but I would have liked to see more Chardonnay...something along the lines of a less sour Temptation. Finishes with some mild hop flavors and dry Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry and medium bodied. There is a slight alcohol burn with the 10%ABV, but less than I was expecting. Overall, this is a very solid beer and I look forward to trying more that this brewery has to offer. Unfortunately, I may not take the risk if the price tags are this high. It took me 3 trips to Los Angeles and seeing this beer on shelves before I actually pulled the trigger.","DovaliHops","Oct 12, 2012"

While it is quite tasty, for the price it is a bit over-rated. If you can get it at an affordable price (under 25 dollars for a bottle) then I say go for it, but if not then your much better off going for something more time true and affordable in a Belgian.","Darkmagus82","Oct 10, 2012"

The smell was up oak with some citrus funk and a hint of malts. The taste of the beer was tart up front. The flavor was balanced though, it's moderately hoppy, tart and has just enough malt in there too. The mouthfeel is thin but not watered down. There is a crisp carbonation to the beer and very drinkable. Overall it's a very nice beer.","Knapp85","Sep 07, 2012"

The beer quickly becomes all about the chardonnay aging as the dominant scent becomes a glass of heavy chardonnay - vinous with faint apple notes, base beer hidden behind the grape and oak, light spice and bready yeastyness. First few sips brought me back to some high end Napa chardonnay based sparkling wine, only slightly less vinous with more pronounced breadyness and light spice. Medium bodied, light oily heft despite bubbly carbonation, dry and tannic. Been waiting to sample for a while, just never comfortable with the price point, but well worth it in the end.","rfgetz","May 07, 2012"

Belgian yeast spice, Floral notes, orange peel, some vanilla and oak subtleties. Slightly acidic and tart. Well carbonated, dosent detract from the complexities at all.

Beautiful pure white head the left a sheet of foamy lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet from pale malts and candi sugar which is quickly followed by some tart lemon/vanilla oak notes from the aging. It really takes on the Chardonnay character. Some pepper in the aroma as well. The flavor is of a sweet pale malt; sweet from the candi sugar. There is some clovey phenols, touch of banana and then the dry white grape lemony notes. Solid french oak flavors, lemon and a touch of vanilla; this gives the beer a nice tart/sour edge which helps balance the sweet belgian pale ale style. The oak is more subtle in the flavor which works quite well for the style. The BSPA has a moderate body with fairly soft carbontion and has a good balance between sweet and tart. Some slight ABV awareness during the tasting but fairly tame for 10%. An interesting brew, most likely well received by the sour/tart saison lovers out there.
