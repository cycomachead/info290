"Huge Pearl Jam fan, so i bought 18 of these. One left to age. My favorite band from my favorite brewery. I'll be honest though, it taste more like a Belgium Ale, there is a creamy note to this beer with a bit of spice. Not much on the hoppy note, I'll update once it has a little age on it."

"Pours light copper, light bottom to darker top. 1/4 inch white foam. Sits atop. Light fruity nose, must be the currants. Light malty flavor, good fruity back. Citrus in there. Really good, nicely balanced. Worked for me."
""

"Think this beer is average at best and likely the reason DFH supposedly retired it. Pours gold in color with okay head and suspended particles throughout. Smells of currants but that's about it. Pretty tame otherwise. Tasted pretty bland and usual - not quite off-centered enough for DFH. Felt easily drinkable but was completely letdown by a commentarive beer for one of my favorite bands. Needs more character or spunk like the band."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the flavoring. The nose actually started out a bit cheap, with the grain taking on a pseudo-adjuncty feel. This thankfully faded with warmth, giving more genuine grain, fruit, and sweetness. With the inclusions of the black currants we were expecting a much more fruity beer, but instead were delivered something much more akin to a sour when it comes right down to it. This is not to say that this was a wild/sour, but the tartness of the fruit took us off guard. To note we are drinking a Batch 1, November 2011 bottling, so the sweetness has had time to settle, with the grain coming much further to the front. With warmth this beer gets better, remaining dynamic and something unique for the brewery."

"O: This would probably have been much better fresh; however, I don't know the style very well but it tastes decent. I bought this because it was a DFH brew that I hadn't had yet. I was surprised to find it. Today was a bad day for beer but this was probably the best of the night."
"O: The nose is very fruit-forward and sweet, but thankfully Faithfull Ale shows more balance in taste. The Belgian aspects of it are very downplayed, as the yeast takes a passive role. Complexity suffers as a result, and it feels a little dumbed-down. A decent beer in the end, though Dogfish Head perhaps played this one a little more safely than they should have."

" ""Sometimes"" we build beers up to be bigger than they should be. Perhaps I have done that here. With all of the ""Oceans"" of other beers out there, this one did not make me ""Smile", but instead proved my ""Dissidence"" is expected. I will keep one in the cellar and check the ""Rearview Mirror"" in a couple months to see if things have changed. Maybe my ""Daughters"" would like this one, but not me."

"FINAL SCORE = A-/B+"

"O- Not that it’s necessarily a bad beer, I’m just wondering when DFH is going to stop continuing to produce the same beer with a different label. It makes me want to do a side-by-side comparison of this, Midas Touch, Chateau Jiahu, Pangaea and Noble Rot to see what, if any, are the major differences between them because I hardly see any. Good thing I got this bottle practically for free."
""
""
"Hits up front with currant then a bitter spice hop followed by zesty bread notes. This one is very complex and tasty lots of good flavor, but it doesn't quite come together the way in which my mouth would be pleased."
""
""
"Overall: not a bad brew but if your goal is to drink BSPAs this is one that might not fulfill your needs. I ain't knocking it but seriously we deserve better. Salud!"

"25.4 oz. Bottle purchased in 2011 from Chuck's 85th Street Hop Shop, Ballard, Seattle, Washington for $15.99. ""Ale Brewed With Currants--20 IBU's"". Lacy lasting quarter inch bright white head. Clear pretty bright yellow gold color. Light Belgian yeast aroma with hints of Currants and mild hop notes. Tight sediment hazes brew slightly. Clean mild sweet fruit lick black currant Belgian Golden Ale body. Very nice medium texture. Clean mellow sweet smooth Belgian end. Very smooth and tasty. Aged nicely. (4.25 / 5.0)."

"O - After its appearance and aroma, I was expecting more. Not bad by any means, but dissapointing nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It’s decent and worth a try if you have someone to split it with, but it would have benefited from more body and more currant."
""
""
""
"O: 3"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The currants are downplayed a bit, aside from the initial fruitiness of the brew. This 7% ABV specialty, fruit and music inspired Belgian pale ale has appeal at a base level, and does not disappoint there. However, the grand scheme of things is not entirely interesting or monumental. It's a good ale, but not one I'm clamoring to put back in production."
""
""
"O - For what it is its pretty nicely done. I would like to try a fresh batch but this has no sign of aging too long, maybe I would have picked up on some bitterness had it been consumed months ago but the sweet malty and fruit flavors seem to be where they should be."
""
"O: I was a tad disappointed in this. I really wanted the currants to play a lot more of a part in the overall character of the beer. I got an OK pale ale with a bit of astringent fruit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am glad to have tried this beer, I really enjoy Pearl Jam's music. I was not bowled over by this beer, but it is well made. I cannot imagine a random person just picking this one up in the beer store, so newbs need not be warned of anything."
""
""
"glassware: Infinium flute....occasion: the deck is officially framed...appearance: bubbly white head that rises on a hazy gold body...aroma: fruit-fortified--the currants are sour and stronger than some reviewers have stated; not a turn-on or a turn-off, but abrupt...palate: light and spritzy--not as strong as Pearl Jam's early or late catalogue--and easily drinkable (a.k.a. little character--decidely not Eddie Vedder!)...taste: slightly pungeant, sour fruit flavors....overall: like Pearl Jam's better songs, the subtle power (alcohol) of this beer is best served in an easily drinkable package..."

"D - Not a bad brew by any means... I'm actually a bit surprised by composite low score this one has received to date... Not something I would drink with regularity, but a nice take on style by DFH... Perhaps kicking back with any brew and a little PJ in the background will make anything taste better, but then again isn't that the ponit of this beer???"
"A clear golden ale with a thin head but decent lacing. Smell is light malt and bread with a bit of fusel alcohol. A bit of fruitiness as well, apples and grapes mostly. Taste is much the same with a mild hoppiness. A nice honeyed overall malt base with some bread and sweet rolls. Alcohol in the finish is a bit hot though the sweetness is nice, a warming swallow. Very mild hop bitterness. Feel is medium light with a crispness when cold that settles into a fuller creaminess as it warms and the carbonation becomes more expansive. A nice beer overall though not a world shaker. The price makes it a bit of a disappointment but not a big one. I just wish the alcohol presence was a bit more subdued making for a more drinkable and better overall beer imo"

"Overall - A very average BPA, if that's really what it is. Lacking complexity and fruit. Just about nothing exciting about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Urgh. I'm totally off DFH's beers. Why did I buy this one? I knew it was going to follow the same trajectory. Something about the promise of currants through the boil intrigued me. But like most Dogfish beers I've had, the intrigue is one thing, and the execution is quite another."
""
"Overall impression - The best part about this beer is that nothing is over the top. In the land of the Dogfish, this is a pretty tame critter. It drinks easily and doesn't seem like 7% abv."
"Overall, a miss for me."
""

"This wasn’t bad. It might not have been the most complex beer I’ve ever had but what is here is pretty well balanced and worked well enough together. The currant flavor and spice were probably the highlights of this for me. It’s probably worth checking out if you still see it out there."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. There is quite a bit of fruity flavor mixed in, but the beer still stays nicely balanced and refreshing."
"D - Fruity and not overly complex, but I still like it. It manages to be sweet but never cloying and it has just enough variety of flavor to give it some legitimacy. I wouldn't feel the need to drink it again, but it was nice."
"Overall: very drinkable. Nice fruit notes from the currants. The base beer seems like it follows the genre well."
"O - I'm usually a big fan of DFH, but this one didn't do much for me. Not bad, but so far from memorable."
"Pours a golden brown, with a thin white head. Smell is very muted, with notes of Belgian yeast, light malt and very mild piney hops. Taste is fairly muted, with light malt, nice spice notes from the yeast and a mild malt backbone. Carbonation is low, but this beer is a smooth drinker. Overall a fair offering from DHF, but not worth of its assocociation with such an excellent band."
""
"Overall much better than the band imo."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a large pure white foamy head. Aroma consists of light sweet malt base with note of currants and light fruity ester. Taste is an unbalanced mix between some lightly sweet malt notes with some currant notes and some weird cough syrup notes detectable in the background. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Another experience that is not a total hit."
""
"Overall: Well, I was prepared to be let down by this brew, but was pleasantly surprised. Its different, and good."
""
"Pour is bright golden yellow, with a decent white head. Looks like a Belgian pale. Honestly, the smell reminds me scaringly of Ta Henket. Toasted bread crumbs come to mind. I dont get much of the Currants they speak of on the label, and the Belgian yeast is the dominant flavor. I get the light part, but the fruit flavor not so much. A bit dry as well, right in line with Ta Henket. Finishes very clean."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed golden yellow, plume of white frothy head, little retention and lacing. Scent is meek and mild with light hints of fresh and musty hay, as it warms, notes of sweet watery fruit come through along with moderate spice and faint bready yeast. Taste more fruit forward than scent dictates, and even though i know currants are used, I get more sweet watery fruit and light berry notes. Earthy dried hay, light bit of funkiness, moderate spice and some bready yeast. Medium bodied, bubbly and a touch on the dry side. Overall, not too bold or complex but lightly refreshing."
""
"a clear golden yellow with 2 fingers of detergent like head, great lacing. smells of bready yeast, black peppercorn, lemon peel. initial strong alcohol taste followed by a malty sweetness and followed up by a weird peppery zest. taste of pepper, lemongrass, belgian yeast.. has a funky aftertaste. medium bodied with a creaminess to it, light carbonation. not bad for an odd take at a belgian.. things i'd like different are less funk on the after taste, maybe more carbonation.. or a champagne like feel to it would feel more traditional. oh, and i'm not a fan of pearl jam at all, so the label art made me cringe a bit. these are all minor things though, the beer looks beautiful when poured, smells and tastes refreshing, and that's what counts."
"I was rather impressed with this beer. True to DFH form it was not a pure example of the style but the ingredients used made for a tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear light golden color with a thinnish white head with minimal retention. Smells a bit fruity with a bit of pepper mostly. A light bit of non descript dark fruits with a Belgian yeasty twang. Taste is a bit sweet with dark fruits, candied sugar, pepper, and clove. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Decent beer, I enjoyed it, but it really didn't wow me."
""
"Overall, the fruit additions mask the belgian yeast character too much for my liking. Not one I'm likely to try again."
""
"O- Pretty boring and one dimensional."
""
""
"Overall an average Belgian style ale with nice bready start and faint yeasty notes. Godd dry finish and drinkability. Nothing that stands out though."
"This beer is bright clear and pale. Nice short dense head with very nice lacing and retention. Aroma is very mild and pretty yeasty. A bit spicy and fruity, but really not much. Some sweet grainy aroma and a mild vinous thing. Flavor is mildly spicy, not very fruity, really not a ton going on, but there is still some alcohol bite. As it warms to room temp, a bit more fruit emerges, but not a ton. Mouthfeel is heavier than I like in belgians, even a 7% belgian pale. This beer is nice, but unremarkable. Nothing is off, or wrong, but it is nothing special."
""
""
"i gave my wife a sip (she was sipping on a bigfoot) and she said ""ew, gross...that tastes like piss"""
""
""
"This is, as descrbied a very delicately flavored beer, its not overly grainy but the flavors just do not come out in any meaningful way - the over carbonation masks the low hop flavors, which is good and bad and I just never pick up on the currant flavor but I'm assuming its the lingering sweetness I'm tasting that I cannon pinpoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not particularly good. I actually like, to some degree, the effect of the currents. It is unusual and imparts some nice flavours. However, I don't think the base beer is very good at all. Without the currents, this would be a very mediocre Belgian Pale. With them, it is interesting but not a winner. The currents may have gone better in a different style- a Belgian Dark or perhaps a stout."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, cyrstal clear, honey-gold coloring with a very light, foamy head of about an inch that settles out quickly once you begin drinking. Aromas of toasted cereal and extremely subtle currant sweetness. That grape/currant character swings heavier in the palate, with a solid, slightly sour profile along side the toasty grain backbone and a touch of honey at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is roasty and toasty, but not much else. This helps keep it clean, with a smooth, slightly lingering finish that leaves a touch of fruit behind for a bit. Very decent beer."
""
""
"O: A fairly solid DFH offering, a little less flavorful than I have come to expect from DFH but pretty fantastic nonetheless."
""
"O - A decent beer but certainly not worth the price tag."
""
"The price tag on this one, and availablity, do not make it a frequent drinker but I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty but nothing amazing, the advertising seemed to promise more, still worth a try"
"D: Very simple, good to drink a lot of but not my cup of tea. Was very surprised with the way this one came out, Dogfish is still one of my favorites."
""
"Overall just a pretty boring, uninspired beer. I expect more when I drop more than $10 on a bottle of beer."
""
""
"Light to medium body with a prick of carbonation here and there on the tongue. Flavor on the tongue is a bit off putting for me, just a strange combination of flavors that don't work too well for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is refreshing, fruity, strong and tasty. I enjoy it (trying not to let my like of the band cloud my judgement) and would recommend it to anyone. For an ale it is light and crisp and would be suitable for the warmer months. Enjoy!"
""
"Wheres the Belgian? Maybe its in the yeast, but not traditional use of Belgian brewing techniques. More like French or Italian. None the less I think the fact that it is related to Pearl Jam, if only in name. Made it taste better. Have had twice..and that is enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(D)- Not bad, but not that memorable either especially compared to other Dogfish Head beers in their lineup."
"Bottle, Chimay Glass"
"This beer definitely seems to be missing a hop bite, or something like that at least & it actually has me wondering if an IPA level of hopping would have made this beer more balanced and drinkable; somehow this beer does seem to be out of balance, it is sort of thin and has a “cheap” finish (though I am not entirely sure I know what I mean by this last description); a large part of this may be that the flavors / notes found in this beer seem quite simplistic. This is a beer I could easily drink if I was mindlessly drinking something, but as something that I want to be thoughtful and contemplative of it just falls short."
""
""
""
"Pearl Jam’s Faithfull Ale (7% BSPA brewed with currants): $14.99???"
"I'm afraid this beer is kind of a miss for me."
""
""
""
"O - Not very impressed considering the steep price, but Dogfish does occasionally strike out (see: Raison D'etre). Was expecting much more fruit, and more a lambic style brew. Worth a try, but won't get again."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange-yellow amber, thin medium white head dissipates quickly into a ring. Aroma is biscuit malt, a hint of dark fruit (the currants), light yeast. Flavor is unusual, with sweet malt, light fruit, mild currant, Belgian spicing. Slight Belgian spice bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and a decent carbonation element even though it is not visually evident. Pleasant and unusual. I doubt I'll see another bottle of this, but I'd be happy to drink it again."
""
""
""
"O: This is a mediocre effort from Dogfish Head. In terms of aroma and flavor, this ale is painfully one-dimensional. It's also difficult to drink. To be frank, my expectations weren't high, but I still expected a little better."
""
""
"O-I'd have to say one of the better tasting pale ales I've had. Nothing super or spectacular but blends in nicely and woos your thirst a bit. Solid beer. "
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink, but just kind of bland. This is not a typical Dogfish Head beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to get more of this."
"POured from 750ml bottle into tulip glass. Pours a clear, dirty golden color with a full, white, pillowy, frothy had which is somewhat lasting and leaves minimal lace. The nose has a light currant note, some doughy/bready yeast, light candi sugar, light peach, some light herbs, and faint sweat. The flavor is similar with more light candi sugar, peach and currant notes underneath, faint herbs, doughy yeast, and light peppery phenols. The palate is lively, medium, creamy, and slightly drying. The finish is lightly herbal and peppery, drying slightly, but ultimately still filled with light candi sugar. Not what I would call a tribute to Pearl Jam with not much going on. The beer was mostly just candi sugar notes and subtle fruit additions. Very disappointing but again I could never really associate Pearl Jam with craft beer?"
"O- A nice beer, but not one I would purchase again. It was $12.99 here in NJ, and, to me, way overpriced given the quality of the beer. Overall, a disappointment"
"O - I actually liked this one a bit more than my rating would indicate. It had some decent flavors but it never really got to the point of being great. I wouldn't turn it down in the future."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was smooth and medium to thin in the body. Modest carbonation. Not my favorite DFH beer."
""
"M: The currants do an admirable job carrying the ale; their sweetness has a distinct Belgian appetite. It'll do in a pinch."
"O - This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor and goes down easy. It wouldn't be a problem to have a few glasses of this in a night. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a nice representation of the style. It's a good beer, but I just don't really see what makes this so special to be one of their special releases. I just has a little higher hopes for this one. I do recommend checking it out though. It's definitely worth trying."
""
"From the 750 ml bottle. An amazing $14.99 somewhere in San Diego. Nowhere as good as Matilda or Hades, to name two popular versions of the style. Certainly not a bad beer, but if you're going to do the big fancy bottle and charge more than most Belgians, you're going to build expectations."
"Overall: Falling somewhere between Duvel and the next of kin, Duvel Green, but with, of course, some added currant fruitiness. A tolerable tribute. I was ultimately more excited about the 90's tunes I fired up for the review than the beer itself."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a large white head that quickly fades to nothing, minimal lace and little carbonation. Aroma is medicinal, plum, ripe fruit, alcohol, hand sanitizer, Belgian yeast, and light spice. Flavor is much less offensive than the nose. But who cares. Overly sweet and fruity, sugar and syrup with a cloying aftertaste. Thick, syrupy body with light carbonation and a mild dry finish. Whatever, I don't care. Evenflow bros."

"Worth trying ""once"" (pun intended). Do not see a need to go back."
""
""
"O: Seems like this is a miss. Loved Bitches Brew, hated everything after. Disappointing."
"This is an alright beer. A little lighter and no hop presence for me but it's different. At this price point, $12 I will probably pass on it the next time."
""
""
"This was the most impulse-y of impulse buys. Guy at the store says ""Hey, we just got this in!"" and I just snap it up. I've been kinda passing up opening it up since then, since I don't want to have to regret my purchase. It pours a golden color with tons of visible carbonation, but a fairly tiny head. Aroma is pale malts, yeast, and currants. Smells a bit too sweet, to be honest. The taste is quite sweet, with the currants, malts, and Belgian yeast all working to make something approaching cloyingly sweet. Thankfully a cuttingly dry mouthfeel at the end stops it from becoming too cloying. The drinkability is pretty good, the Belgian influence doesn't get too out of hand. Overall, it's a decent beer, but not nearly worth the twelve dollar or so price tag that it has."
""
"overall - a disappointment. fairly boring, and not worth the high price tag."
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Pours deep golden hue with a long lasting white head. Aroma has nice fruity bouquet, followed by some biscuit malt and some caramel flavors. Palate is a nice medium, smooth body with good carbonation almost champagne like. Finishes with some nice ripe fruit, spices, wheat, some biscuit malt and yeast notes with a long light spicy ending. A very nice and tasty brew."
""
"750 ml bottle. Pours deep golden with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is very fruity, biscuit malt and some caramel and Champaign. Medium, smooth body. Flavors are ripe fruit, spices, wheat, biscuit malt and yeasty notes. Long, spicy finish. This brew is very tasty, as always from DFH."
""
""
"D: Although it’s not that impressive, Mikkel accomplished his goal of creating a fruit-forward macro with this one. If that’s what you look for in a beer, this one's for you."
""
"Overall, while this is good beer, it's just that: ""good"" beer. It's not ""great," largely because it lacks any remarkable or distinguishing characteristics, such as many of Dogfish Head's other offerings. Even the currants, despite the fact that they were added in ""10 incremental additions"" during the one-hour boil, don't make a marked presence, and simply blend with everything else. This doesn't mean that the beer is not worth trying, but it does mean that you shouldn't approach this expecting the same revelatory mindbending experience that was Pearl Jam's Ten. Instead, it's just a decent brew."
"O- this started off so well, then I took a sip of it. There's the base of a good beer here....but it just fell completely flat"
""
"Overall. Pretty easy drinking beer. I liked it."
""
""
""
"While it's easy to expect a heavy and complex display of flavors to conjoin the fussion of Peal Jam and Dogfish, the truth is that the demands of the band are quite banal, and the quality of Dogfish Head carries the collaboration towards success. I didn't expect the notion of Pearl Jam to influence the beer a 'heavier' direction. But the beer that Dogfish Head creates is a very Cream Ale taste, but with a fruity/spicy interplay and a zesty dry finish that's much commemorated! Gread job to Dogfish Head with a limited scope."
""
"Not a beer I would want to drink a lot of."
""
"The beer had a medium feel to it and appeared to have the right carbonation for the style, which is to say, very carbonated. The beer did end with a dry finish. Overall, less than average beer that I had high expectations for. I am glad that I only bought the one bottle, as I could not even finish that one."
"Overall: Very interesting, I would love to try this again."
"Overall, a nice belgian with honey and fruit (currants, I assume)."
""
"Taste-Sweet orchard fruits, faint black currant note. For a Belgian strong pale ale their is a notable lack of hops in the flavor profile. More sweet than anything, a good dose of Saaz or something a little more pronounced would have worked wonders in my opinion. Decent at best."
"O - Solid beer, nothing over the top impressive about it, but one that drinks fairly easily."
"Overall: This is a really mediocre and weird beer. I hate not being specific, but it just didn't work for me. I wouldn't have another."
""
"Overall: this beer was enjoyable based on the style. Yes it is milder in flavor, but sometimes this is exactly what I am looking for in a beer."
""
"Overall: It really tastes like Dogfish Adjunct Lager. It exists in this beer. Some nice currant notes are lost amid the spice and adjunct flavors. There's potential in this beer, but it got lost."
"Overall: Great brew for an amazing band. Not my favorite DFH offering, but definitely interesting and well done. Currants work well with the spiciness of the yeast. The sweetness is controlled well and never becomes overwhelming. I would look to try this again."
""
"D: Certainly drinkable, but was expecting more of a pronounced currant-taste and a bit more creativity (the reasons why I purchased this). Worth a try, if the price is right."
""
"Meh. I no smell hops or malt, but I did smell some spiciness. Pale golden color with moderate head and a bit fluffy. Belgo I guess, but it lacked complexity. Some fruit on the tongue, but it dies pretty quickly. It's better than that 'triple-hopped' foolishness you see on the giant billboards around town, but DFH has done better. A lot better."
""
"Very good beer. Not something I'd seek out based on the price for quality ratio. But still, I love Pearl Jam and I love beer, so no regrets."
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle from Total Beverage Westminster poured a clear gold with a small lasting white head. Aromas of straw, yeast and light currants. Mouthfeel was ligt bodied and crisp with a smooth dry finish. Flavors of straw, yeast and light currants with a smooth dry finish. Yet another boring Dogfish experiment!"
""
"I like the unique Dogfish Head connection between musicians and beers. The blues/jazz connections have made sense. This one, not quite so much. Not a bad Belgian pale ale - bright malt flavor with pleasant lively carbonation. I really didn't detect much of the currant influence. Beyond that, there was much to make this beer particularly memorable. Pleasant, but not impressive."
"Faithfull Ale pours a crystal clear goldenrod, with about three fingers of fluffy white foam crowning the beer. Head retention isn't bad, but lacing is hard to come by. The nose is a bit dull (which, in the end, is probably doing me a favor), but what aroma is perceptible is dominated by the currants. There's also a slight peppery phenolic presence, but all it really does is hint that maybe currants don't belong in this style of beer. The flavor is still dominated by that dark raisin-y flavor, but a little bit of pear shows up and joins the pepper-clove notes to provide a slight Belgian Strong Pale framework for the currants. They don't belong here any more than they did in the nose though, the flavor clashes horribly with the base beer. The body is nicely dried out, but the carbonation isn't as expansive and lively as would be ideal for the style. I'm a Dogfish Head fan, and I'll try just about anything they brew at least once, because more often than not I can dig it. Every once in a while though they come up with something that's just a complete miss for me, and this is one of those times."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH HAVING!"
""
"Not super drinkable or particularly worth seeking out."
""
"i like the smell of this ale nothing screams out belgian strong pale to me though....the fruitiness from the currant is a little forward in the nose....now the taste is where i'm stumped on where to place this beer...the currants hit you a little at the front but the back is very light, not much flavor...and salty!...yes salty. now thats not saying i won't like drinking the whole bottle...because it is an extremely drinkable beer....ESPECIALLY for a 7 percent abv beer...i'm really impressed by that. excellent body to this beer too!....very creamy and smooth in the mouth....so i guess overall i really like this beer...but to grade it as a Belgian Strong Pale....now thats a little hard to do!"

"Smooth and well-balanced, and easy-drinking. Was surprised to find its lower rating on BA. Above average."
"There was a ton of people asking for this limited beer weeks before it arrived. Is it a good beer? Yes, absolutely! Is it worth all the phone calls trying to find the store that has a bottle and the 20 mile drive? Meh, probably not. But, I will say you should grab one if you get the chance."
"750ml bottle purchased at the Brattleboro Co-op on Xmas Eve. Bottled on 12.01.2011 indicated on the bottle. Served in my DFH chalice. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a frothy, one inch, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim. Some spots of lacing, but somewhat poor retention. Nose seems a bit off - a combination of grassy, skunky and citrusy with perhaps a trace of coriander. Taste is quite a bit different than the nose - citrus, currants, pale malts and a suggestion of candi sugar. There's also a plesant floral/herbal character that comes out towards the back end. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation. There's also a slightly oily texture which is quickly dispersed by the carbonation. A slightly acidity around the edges is also overshadowed by the carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid BSPA. Not mindblowing by any means, but a good domestic example of the style. At 7% abv I wouldn't sit on this bottle too long. Right now it is pleasant and bright; however, I would be concerned that some of the off aromas might eventually translate into the flavor profile."

"While this brew did hide the ABV very well, it just didn’t taste very good and it’s hard to believe that I’m disappointed with a Dogfish Head beer, but this was a huge let-down. The sweetness makes it drinkable, and while it doesn’t taste bad it just has no redeeming qualities to make it anything bust just an average beer. Something is missing as the flavor just remains average and on life support. Based on the price, I would not seek this out again as it’s just a hair above a macro brew lager, which makes this honest assessment difficult as I love this brewery. I guess this shows that some off-centered experiments do actually miss the flavor mark. This is my DFH mulligan."

"My advice is only get this if you really like Pearl Jam or are trying to collect everything from Dogfish Head."
""
"Horribly overpriced at $15.99 a bottle. Reminded my wife of Budweiser, and she can't stand Budweiser. Like a light Belgian gone bad. No taste of currents or aftertaste whatsoever. Really disappointed in this one from DFH (and I like a lot of their stuff). Pearl Jam still rocks though."

"Dogfish Head does quite well when taking fairly common and contemporary styles and jazzing them up just a bit. I think they did fall a bit short in this rendition, however, simply due to the lack of noticeable traits from a primary ingredient listed on the beer's jacket. The wife and I enjoyed the dry finish but were hoping for just a bit more complexity from added fruit."

"This is not a bad beer, it fits right in with the DFH family of slightly off-centered (from style) beers. A good one to pair up with cheese-and-cracker-level appetizers, or white grapes. It just doesn't get high marks relative to other BSPAs."
"Overall, not the best of the style but I liked it adn would drink it again. THe kind of beer I could drink the entire bottle but nothing that I would especially remember."
"O- this was an interesting try by DFH, I know they were trying to mix styles for this specialty beer, while it was a decent beer it's not one I'd go running back to immediately"
""
"M + D: Pretty standard medium body... carbonation is good, offering a nice and refreshing drink. This is something I could see myself drinking more towards the end of summer, as a bit of a 'chill out after a day on the beach' kind of beer... not lawnmower, but refreshing and mellow. I don't know if I'd return for another, but I might give it some consideration. Perhaps a little lackluster, but alright."

"Overall, I really wanted this to be better than it was. The currants didn't add a ton and it all turned into a boring, Belgian golden ale. I would pass on this."
"Big glowing apricot bright orange body with an off white creamy colored head with a fluffy billowing texture. The body was slightly clouded and the head formed fine even lacing as it dwindled. I remember Au Courant never quite taking off, and all of a sudden we have a new 7% abv currant beer. The nose has a dry powdered yeast note that falls flat, a bit of a mineral character with some mild earthiness. The nose isn't very expressive with the currant fruitiness/tartness I was expecting. Flavor is actually pretty nice with a mix of sweet malt and tart fruit currants mixing together, with a wave of warmth in the alcohol and a dry Belgian yeast finish. Not much in the way of spices or yeast spiciness. There is a texture/flavor that I just don't care for amongst the currant jam sweetness that almost has a milky powdered crushed calcium tablet note about it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied moderate carbonation, something in texture weighs on the palate between each sip making it more and more difficult to quaff on. Overall this beer lacks cohesive flavors that would be expressive of such a great and timeless band like Pearl Jam. Maybe they were going for a currant jam, but I feel this beer was a rehash of an old release with less creativity behind than their other album releases like Bitches Brew or Hellhound on my Ale."

"overall: Miss."
"O - I'll start off by saying that I listened to Sam Calagione's quick blurb about this beer on the DFH website. The basic intention was to incorporate Pearl Jam's two favorite beverages on their tours: fruitful pinot noirs and Mexican lagers. That's a pretty tall task to combine, but I think DFH accomplished this with some success. This beer no doubt has lager qualities as well as dry, fruity wine notes from the addition of currants. The flavor certainly isn't the best I've had, especially from DFH, but this does have a nice drinkability quality for sure. A big challenge was taken on here, and while the result wasn't a big hit, I appreciate the effort and creativity put forth to celebrate Pearl Jam's 20th anniversary."
"Pours super clear, super golden with a minimal amount of pale head. The smell is very currant forward, with not a lost else going on. Still, very inviting. Tastes a slight of booze, currants and sweetness. Very light overall. Has a bit of effervescence and sweetness that lasts, and then clears off the palate nicely. Overall a bit above average."
"O: This one just didn't do it for me. It wasn't true to style, nor was it very good. One of the only DFH beers I will put in my ""Do not buy again"" list... sad really, especially with the collaboration with Pearl Jam"
"O: After Bitches Brew, I had high hopes for this release, but it was definitely a let down. The addition of currents was an odd choice IMO. Pearl Jam deserves better."
""
"O - I liked Faithfull Ale. It's an interesting blend of flavors and an experiment that was worth a taste. Not really sure why it's Pearl Jam related, but hey it works...if not quite what I expected from a DFH ale. While it's good, it's definitely not one of Dogfish Head's best and the black currants are likely to be divisive among its consumers. If you like currants, give this one a try."
""
"O- This was a disappointing beer, but could have been more disappointing. I feel the currants do save this beer, just wish you could taste them more. I am a big fan of both Dogfish Head and Pearl Jam, and just thought that they would make a better beer. I am happy that I got a bottle, but will not seek it out again."
""
"Pours a light golden color with a two finger head which gives way to nothing and leaves little or no lace. The aroma is of candied yeast and currants, the aroma is there but it is fairly weak and hard to get a good feel for. The taste mainly follows suit, it starts slightly malty and then gives way to candied yeast and the back end gives a sweet currant taste. The taste was a little weak. The mouthfeel was lowly to moderately carbonated. Overall it was average for the style. I would have liked to get a little more from the aroma and the taste on this one. Not a bad beer but not their best."
"D - I guess I can buy the integration of berries into this one, but I'm not too enthusiastic about it. I expected to hate this one and ended up being able to finish the bottle, so that's a definite plus."

"O - a strange beer, I bought it cause I am a dogfish head and perl jam fan, but I was really expecting something more than a better SA blackberry witbier, it would be a solid basic beer from any other brewery, but from dfh it is dissapointing"
"Faithfull Ale is alright beer, but isn’t great. I had hoped for a little better. Frankly, it just seems to be a little lacking in every department. It could use a little more of everything. The flavor really needs a bit more pizzazz. A bit more fruit flavor or more hops might do the trick. It’s alright though. Definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel: Crisp and dry."

"Interesting beer. Very, very yeasty and bready with more currant in the aroma than there is in the taste. More accurately, the currant is probably more forward in the aroma than it is in the flavor because of all the breadiness in the taste. Pours golden with a somewhat thin head that leaves little lacing. I expected a darker beer, probably because of the currants, so that was a surprise. Quite fruity in the nose with noticeable currant notes. Aside from the breadiness in the taste, the currants make a mid-palate appearance followed by a late hoppy bitterness. Interesting, but the slightly raw yeasty flavors contribute to a thicker mouthfeel. I actually don't mind the flavor itself, primarily since I like a yeasty note and I like currants, but I could see how this could easily hit the wrong notes for a lot of people."
"O: Not my favorite dogfish head brew but interesting nonetheless. Just enough alcohol to make it interesting."
"I have to say I'm disappointed. This is more or less a typical Belgian Ale. It's simple and leaves me wanting more. For an anniversary ale I was expecting so much more. This definitely wasn't worth the $15 price tag."

"O: A good beer, but not amazing. Not all that complex, as I've come to expect from Dogfish Head. But overall I would recommend it. My wife liked it a lot given the light body and subtle taste."
"O: This is a good sipping beer that masks its alcohol rather well."
"CHEERS"
"Overall – Again, why is this labeled as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale? This is an unremarkable beer by all accounts. Perhaps Pearl Jam likes PBR and wanted DFH to make a clone? Needless to say, I had been wanting to try this so I am glad I was able to (and honestly if you close your eyes and drink it expecting a macro lager it is quite enjoyable)."
""
""
"I realize that DFH's willingness to take risks often results in beers about which people will have varying opinions, but still not quite sure what DFH was thinking with this one. Marketing seems to have trumped quality control."
"D - Easy drinking; good summertime beer and goes great with any Pearl Jam album you have; not heavy and enjoyable"
"O: good beer and some amazing notes, a little to warm for a 7% and not enough hop flavors to be a great BPA."

"4.0 D: It's not the most impressive brew, but I do think it's quite tasty. At $12/bottle, I likely won't ever buy it again, but I'm glad I got to try it. It was easy to drink the whole 750."

"O - A cool idea, but this one comes across a bit style-over-substance. Corona plus Pinot may have sounded like a cool tribute idea on paper, but this didn't work out so well as a finished beer."

"This is very weird, and it doesn't entirely work. Somehow, despite the Belgian influences and the currants, this kind of tastes like an adjunct lager with plenty of corn. <Insert Pearl Jam joke here.>"

""
"Shame on you, Dogfish. It's gonna take a while for me to begin forgiving you all for this monstrosity."

"Nothing special, but I've had much worse. I wish the currant was featured more prominently, but still solid."
"O: A good beer. A nice beer with enough unique qualities to make me satisfied with the effort. I'm not sure the style was the right choice here (I'm not even sure this beer fits this particular style) but I'm not one to question what DFH does with their brews. They are good at what they do and I appreciate each one for its special off-centered-ness and this one is no different."
"Don't it make me smile? Yes, it does, but that's all it makes me do. It's nice. It's even nicer if you like Midas Touch (I do). And especially nice if you wanted this bottle for your personal Pearl Jam collection (I did). But really, Pearl Jam deserves a way better, more exciting, more complex beer, but hey, it's the thought that counts."
""
""
"Crisp aroma is malty and yeasty and has an undertone of - yes, currants. It pours a clear solar yellow with a thick, fluffy white head. Flavor is crisp and malty with yeasty and currant notes, just a little fruity sweetness, and a hint of hoppy bitterness. Smooth, syrupy texture is fairly fizzy and leaves a firm, persistent tingle. Keep on pearl jammin'!"
"Overall: not my favorite strong pale ale, and my least favorite yet from DFH."
"O: This is not a bad beer, but for $12/bomber, I definitely expected more. Blah..."
""
""
"I drank this one while listening to the album that inspired it. I can see why the album inspired it as I find it easy to compare the 2. There was flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming, it was easy to drink but not something I'd go out of my way to get again. And perhaps slightly overrated. It poured gold, smelled wheat like and had a hint of some fruit in it. Taste was wheaty with a thin finish of the fruit. For a belgian strong ale it wasn't very strong. It was kind of thin and just not as exciting as some of dogfishes which in some ways was a good thing. Overall it was drinkable, not offensive and pleasant to sip."
""
"O-main 2 reactions: i spent way too much on this ($15) AND i do not want this whole bottle to myself. I don't know what DFH's aim was here but they missed it. this isn't good. i bought a a 12 pack of celebration for less than this one bottle and it has caused me to rethink how i buy beer"

"Notes: Not only pretty standard and unimaginative but a tad bland, almost like the bottle design, which is a actually worse… Good drinkability though for a mainstream audience, maybe they were going for that? Maybe that is its better quality but socially unless there is a Pearl Jam fetish involved I'd rather offer something else… Without a doubt this is the most unremarkable DFH offering I´ve tried in a long while."
"Easily the weakest DFH brew I've ever had. Tastes like an average lager with a splash of white wine thrown in for good measure. Belgian strong ale???"
""
"Pours a translucent gold color with a nice column of bubbles arising from the bottom of the glass. They fuel the growth of a half inch of frothy, pure white head that dissipates to a thick ring and legs of bubbles across the surface. Scattered patches of white bubbles remain as lacing. It smells of lager yeast, various grains, straw, wheat, faint currants, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is more earthy, with an emphasis on the grains (straw, hay, wheat) and a more pronounced currant flavor, especially on the finish. Some lemon, yeast, grass, clove, and alcohol are also noticeable. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, clean, and finishes a touch on the dry side; well done. Overall, a good belgian strong pale ale that is easy to drink and very enjoyable. I wouldn't hesitate to drink more of this."
""
"A good beer but def not that great as far as style goes. Idk why dogfish would do a Belgian ale for pearl jam. They Gould have done something intense and grungy like a stout, porter or ipa! A good beer but not that interesting."
"Overall - What a huge disappointment. I know the reasons behind making this beer and all and i like the idea but come on, why even bother making a shit beer just because that is what Pearl Jam drinks?"
"At the end of the day, buy Faithfull for the bottle if you're a Pearl Jam fan. If you're a beer fan, STAY AWAY! I was extremely excited to try Faithfull, but ended up pouring out about 3/4 of the bomber."
"O- it's not a bad beer. the smell turns me off but the flavor is pretty good and it's easy to drink. Still a let down coming from DFH"
""
"O - Beer is ok, the Band is AWESOME!"
"The aroma was very nice. Lots of yeast and coriander here. Almost a peppery like note bouncing around in there as well. Hints of grass, and honey as well as some light touches of wheat and lemon. The flavor was very peppery, with a pronounced zing on the tongue from the first sips. Nice and lively feel, which was good as I was afraid it was going to come off dull, but was pleasantly surprised. Coriander riddled throughout this one, which on its own, this would be an excellent Belgian ale, but with this added level of spice it just got that much better. Very dry finish, with the moisture zapped from the tongue and a nice bitter taste left behind to balance and play around"

"O-Was expecting more from DFH, it seemed to taste like a white wine to me."

"What bothered me was the mouthfeel. It had a almost stale character. Something I am not used from this brewery. Maybe I had a bad bottle, but I was not impressed by this one and will not touch it again, especially for that proud price! Therefore my rating is low! I still love Dogfish!!!"
"O: A pleasant surprise as I was expecting to get curranted to death, but instead, DFH used a light hand with the fruit and created an above-average sweetish BPA of medium strength. Not a gotta have type of beer, but there's nothing wrong with it and the fruit realy does enhance the aroma and flavor."

"pours sort of a gold yellow. small head. smells fruity, apples banana pears. sort of fruity up front finishing pretty smooth. a little carbonation. Not much hops. very smooth thick feel to it. overall i think this is pretty good. nothing to rave about and not worth 15 bucks. but if it were cheaper it would be better."
"D: just seems like something is missing with this brew. or maybe it was a little rushed. either way, im a bit disappointed with this music collaboration release. from a brewery that is known for making consistently tasty big bodied beers, this is disappointing. grab something else for the price."

"O- Pretty forgettable and very little of a Belgian character to it. The 7.0% ABV is well hidden and I would not have guessed that it was this high, but I don’t see me going back for seconds. Unlike Pearl Jam’s ten, I wasn’t hooked on the first try/listen. Maybe if I age it twenty years I’ll reconsider."

"There was more of a demand for this beer at my local store than for CBS. Damn, I gotta see what this stuff brings: It pours a clear gold topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light corn syrup (more of a vague sweetness than anything, but this is a close enough approximation), vague berries, and light dank greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with those berries coming in even lighter and with a bit of a plastic twinge. Honestly, not much going on on my tongue at all, but what is there ain't all that appealing. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty sad and boring beer. Given the greatness of ""Ten", I'm not entirely sure Pearl Jam deserved a tribute beer like this (though the rest of their oeuvre kinda implies something weak being appropriate)..."

"As fas as Belgian String Pale Ales go, this is one of the sweeter I've had. Unfortunately, while this is from DFH's musician series of brews, this one doesn't sing to me like Hellhound and Bitches Brew did. If you're a DFH fan and must try every new brew they put out, then I know this won't talk you out of having this one as well. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother seeking this out."
""
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, small tartness and a small fruitiness. In the taste, lightly dry malt with notes of a dark fruitiness. A small bite, but mainly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry, mellow dark fruit in the aftertaste. Nice light fruitiness, nose was a bit tart, nice but still a ""Guess what I can make"" kind of beer."

"This is not one of my favorites from DFH but thankfully the taste is decent because the aroma really had me scratching my head. Overall, a very average Belgian style beer."

" The Faithfull is a pretty malty Belgian with some mild spice and yeast hints at chalky with a somewhat doughy and bready flavor. There is light sweetness from the pils base with slight currant note which goes well with the malt. There is a light tanginess in the yeast flavor which also brings out slight earthy currant elements. The malt verges on nutty/toasted at times with more subtle sugar in the raisiny accent, the finish comes off slightly sweet with a hint of spice. Overall this is a pretty good Belgian style golden, not great but for what it is it is alright. I like the currant addition, but perhaps the sweetnes is higher in the profile than necessary. I like the fact the alcohol is low in the overall taste, but it is just good overall in drinkability for my taste, it is like a toned-down pangea -it seems that is the base without any added spices."
"o - Overall a decent wheat beer. Lots of wheat and some lemon here, and pretty easy to drink, but not a ton going on and could have used some more carbonation. Unfortunately a mediocre beer (by a great brewery) named after a mediocre song (by a great band). Would have liked a great beer named after a great song though."
"I have read a lot of people stating that this beer was a disappointment. I honestly don't know what they are talking about. This is a pretty interesting and flavorfull view on a Belgian strong pale ale. I don't care if DFH is a ""sell out"" or if this beer is not good enough for pearl jam or who ever, I'd say it is worth a try if you can find it for $14 or less."
""
"O: Easy drinking but ultimately forgettable. I know when Pearl Jam were asked what they liked to drink the answer was Mexican Lager and sweet red wine. In many ways I'd have to say DFH delivered on these points. The base is light but the Belgian yeast adds character and then the currants add a nice wine like taste. I have to wonder also if the currants (currents) were picked do to Eddie and the bands love for the ocean. A limited release beer worth experiencing but no need to stock up."
"worth trying but not spectacular too bad."
"This beer poured a clear gold color and formed a nice off white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, Belgian yeasts and bread. The flavor was of malt, candy, slight citrus and pepper. The body is medium light and the finish slightly sweet."
"Overall, it's a pretty typical and average belgian pale ale. It's a decent beer, but for $14.99 I feel completely ripped off."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about an inch carbonated white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity, but it's also weak. The brew smells like berries, currants, wheat/grainy malt, and some honey. It tastes like currants, wheat/grainy malt, grassy hops, honey, and some white grapes. But like the aroma, the taste is underwhelming. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with good carbonation. Overall, this beer is just average to me, and since I'm a fan of DFH I'm probably being generous with my rating. This was a one and done for me, I was glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't buy this again."

"13.50 for a 750 ml. Points off for that. This had that in the back subtle taste of currant that wines often claim and frankly dogfish is better than some elite best in the world winery...they sell stuff that is drinkable after all. More to the point I feel like they were going for some kinda of pretentious subtle but not really there flavor. I love the creamy mouth, but the flavor is far some exciting. Perhaps true to Pearl Jam. Age imo will hurt the best feature that mouth feel. Wow I wanted to be more highly spoken but let me use words, if you like sweet and spiced beers this is something I can't even begin to under stand. I like a lot of the parts, but the final verdict with price factored in is absurdly negative...."
"Drink- Damn, this one just let me down. I wanted a bit more pop, flavor, layer. Just more. For a friday night its doing its job. Its wet, its cold has some flavors that stick around but not a drainpour and just not something I will come back too. A little too one dimensional."

"Bottle split with my roomate in our dogfish head snifters. The label said this is a belgian golden ale, so immediately i thought of duvel and delirium tremens, and figured this would be a nice drinking belgian style ale. Appearance had a nice subtle golden color with a full 2 finger head on it, left some nice lacing on the glass as well. The smell was unspectacular, but smelled well enough to continue and taste this beer. Now, when i say that if i did a blind taste test with this beer, i probably would have told you it was a heineken, that is how bland and plain this beer was. This by far is the only dogfish head beer that has ever disappointed me, and i hope that this is not a trend with some of their newer beers. Not worth the $12.99 the bottle cost, to be honest, not worth $2.99."

"Special Thanks to Jim at the Weyerbacher Idiot's Drool release for sharing this one with me and a few other guys there. The beer poured out as a very pale yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The beer looks to be well carbonated with plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell of the beer is sweet, and a bit on the fruity side. The taste of the beer gives off a bit of a fruity note as well, personally I feel that this beer tastes a hell of a lot like Midas Touch. The mouthfeel is light and fairly refreshing, it doesn't feel dry at all it's more of a sweet feeling you get as apposed to a bitter finish. Overall I expected a little more from this brew. I'm not really sure why but I just thought that it would have been something a little more over the top. It's not a bad beer, I just feel that it would be much better to drink in the summer time. I don't feel that this one lives up to the hype in my opinion."

"Beer is thinner than I thought and mildly sweet, finish is a little dry and there is a grainy sort of acidity at the end that finishes the beer poorly. The front half is fine but I don't get much currants. I guess I'm too much of a DFH fan but when I saw ""contains currants"" I immediate thought of the now retired au currant beer which was interesting and purple. They are lost in here this time."

"overall: nice addition. Not the best DFH but kudo's...please keep em comin."

But hey still worth the try and I'm a big fan of this music series idea. Out of the three, this was definitely the least interesting though."

"I can understand why some people don't like this beer that much or its nothing special but for the style of it being a Golden Ale its amazing.I think the problem is that a lot of people don't like golden ales? With that being said I recommend this beer as another well made line of beers in Dogfish's music beers."
" I'd call this an average beer. I'm glad that I tried it, but I wouldn't get it again."
"Clear golden and bubbly. Big head that slowly fades down. Leaves a ring around the glass after a minute or two. Nose has a big lemon/pepper hop and yeast character. Extremely pale fresh grains. Sharp tartness as soon as it hits your tongue. Lemony grains and green apples. Light freshly cracked grains. I want to say Pilsner malt. Dry grassy finish with a lemon peel bitterness. It must be DFH's reputation but I was expecting a bolder flavor profile. It was balanced with flavors and not a bad beer but for my $13.50 I was expecting a bolder character and larger ABV."

"Im very suprised with some of these higher than average scores on this beer. Its average at best. I've had 2 bottles of this in the past 24 hours. I'm not thrilled at all. It's incredibly bland to be completely honest. It pours golden clear in color. Quickly dissipating head, leaves a thin white ring. Smell is extremely faint in Belgian yeast. Taste/ mouthfeel is overly carbonated.. Very Light in spice flavor and currants. A little bit of currants lingering. I've actually been very disappointed with the last few new beers from DFH."
"cheers"
"This brew was really disappointing. Average at BEST."
"Overall: As a PJ fanatic and beer enthusiast, this seemed like the perfect collision of great things. It is a good, drinkable beer, nothing too special, but good. Would be a great summer quencher, very drinkable and refreshing. Wish the currants were a little more prominent. This beer will probably get a good half to one whole grade bump due to the PJ brethren wanting it to be better than it is (I may be a little guilty of this myself!)"
"It's hard to criticize DFH because I still like them a lot, but this beer--released in winter time, in honor of Pearl Jam--shouldn't it have been some kind of stout called ""Black""? I would have even settled for a saison called ""Garden."" :D"
"Sparkling gold with a frothy white head. Pale, dry aroma...winey grape, currant, and light bread. Tart pale grape and sweet, crackery grains. Tart and very slightly phenolic with a bit of citrus in the finish. Light and slick. Not at all what I was expecting and fairly disappointing overall."
"O-Well, I wouldn't buy another especially given the price ($12.99). I really expected more than just an average BSPA. I'm a bit disappointed."
"Overall, this wasn't what I was expecting, thought this would have been a more assertive beer. Regardless, I do find it to be a pleasing, refreshing and enjoyable experience. Would be more appropriate in warmer weather and could be a couple bucks cheaper, but not a dissapointment."
"O - Overall this beer was a big disappointment. Was expecting this beer to live up to the DFH name and other musical collaborations, unfortunately, it misses the mark big time."
"Thanks Dogfish for this PJ20 and thanks PJ for the last Twenty..."
"Pours a light golden color with a one finger head that disapates into a ring of light lacing. Aroma is there but not strong, hops and berries with hints of honey. Taste follows the nose, flavor rises as the beer warms and it really turns into a pretty good beer, its smooth and creamy and quite tasty. I'm wondering if some of the poor reviews were written as the beer warmed."
"o- faithfull is a good ol' musty burst of decent belgian flavor.It's certainly not the best brew dfh put out. I will say this... if you enjoy an herbal brew like midas touch... seek this out"
"I have to be honest I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It certainly surprises me the negative reviews this is getting. Nothing is off in terms of the flavor profile or offensive. Yes, it may not have the most mind-blowing flavors in the world but enough of the subtleties are there to set it apart. If you like Midas Touch and Chateau then this is certainly one you'll enjoy. I happen to really like both of those beers."
"Stay away from ""Midas touch light"" or if you're at least curious, find a sucker like me who paid good money for this atrocious beer and get them to share it with you. That way you can both be miserable and hateful towards this one but only one has to actually shell out money for it."
"Pearl Jam's 10 was one of the most significant albums of my teenage life and is still one of my favorites. This beer doesn't even begin to do it justice. Less reminiscent of early Pearl Jam (very good) and more reminiscent of late Pearl Jam (not very good)."
"O: Really overhyped. I understand the cult-like following that Dogfish has but this beer is very average. Very smart business move to make the tribute beer I just wish the currant flavor was more available."
"Overall meh, pretty lackluster, not my favorite hops, not much Belgian, etc. Not what I was expecting at all and I'm a bit disappointed. Maybe it was because I had overhyped this in my head, but either way a decent but sub-par beer for DFH standards IMO."
"O - A decent beer...but where the hell were those currants!?!? I did enjoy the dry finish and slightly sweet flavors, but I was expecting a bit more here."
"O: A little disappointed, unfortunately. I don't think this beer matched the hype and does not do Pearl Jam justice as the official beer to commemorate their 20 years as a band. I might pick up another, but primarily for the bottle, not the beer."
"Overall I am not exactly feeling this or drawn to it, but it is a typical distinct Dogfish beer, and is probably going to be very polarizing to people. Love it, or hate it, but there's things about it I love, and things about it I seem to not care for.. so I guess I am on the fence. However, would I want to have this again, and the answer is an obvious no."
"Very nice golden color-very clean and clear looking beer. very small white head. Somewhat bready and biscuity aroma. Ever so faint currant aroma. Flavor is much of the same. Mild currant flavor comes thru in the finish. A touch of sweetness as well. Some sulfury/yeasty Belgian notes. Ok mouthfeel-the residual sweetness tends to give the body a slight boost. Overall I was expecting more-a lot more. Just doesn't ""clic"" for me."
"O: A bit of a disappointment, I was hoping for a much stronger currant presence. It comes off like a rather generic BSPA, with seemingly very little of the Belgian spices even shining through."
