4.27,3.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a light golden color with a few fingers worth of fluffy white head. Aromas of apple and slight clove. Taste is complex, starts a bit sweet and fruity and finishes somewhat dry with a bit of pepper/spice along the way. Natural carbonation gives it a bubbly but still smooth and at times buttery mouthfeel. A fantastic beer that is well-balanced and fairly complex.","jfugeman","Mar 04, 2015"

3.77,-8.7,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and i thought it was a nice example of the style, sometimes it can be hard for American brewers to do these Belgian styles justice, but this one seemed to have just about everything that the style should have.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, very crisp, prickly, pretty dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste just did an ok job at holding my attention, half the bottle is enough for me, anymore than that and the carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just what I expect from a Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was going to be a little brighter than it was.  I might buy this beer again if I'm in the mood for the style and I would only recommend it if your a big fan of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but it was still just a little rough around the edges, but I think for an American example of the style it's better than most.  It's not a favorite beer from this brewery and while it's not a favorite of the style, it was one of the better american ones I've had.  Nice job guys, this was a solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Feb 25, 2015"
4.2,1.7,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"This is a complex beer. Good American version of a Belgian Classic. Probably not fair to call it an American version as it could have easily come from Belgium if the bottle said otherwise","Shumania","Feb 25, 2015"

Tropical fruity esters, pears, apples, pepper, clove, and alcohol make up the aroma. Taste is candi sugar, orchard fruit, and honey sweetness up front, followed by a little earthy bitterness and alcohol heat.

Good looking beer, golden and cloudy with good head that stuck around. Good nose but not overwhelming, crisp but not much of a hint of the alcohol. Taste is very good, and smooth considering the alcohol content. Has a light taste and feel despite being at 9% which gives it good bonus points. Not great, but very good and I enjoyed it very much. Would certainly buy this one again depending upon the cost which I cannot remember. Would like to try it again with the 2 on the same night to compare and contrast which would help me narrow down my top styles.","JamieDuncan","May 13, 2014"

Very well balanced with a light farmhouse character and plenty of light pilsner malt, chewy toffee also on the finish. Great beer and well worth having, but wont be in my top ten for the style. I think I would prefer a more assertive flavour profile to match the abv, while this accomplishes a near graceful balance, to each their own I suppose, still very good! When I eventually got down towards the bottom, I added the sediment, which added some nice bite and spice.","mick303","Mar 29, 2014"

4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/10/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon peel, orange peel, pear, apple, grape, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, honey, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of bright malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a very crisp malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian Strong pale ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

None of these three beers is as good and complex as Aureus.

Tastes very malty: bread and honey. Mild noble hop finish. Yeast character is pretty restrained. A bit sweet but dries up in the finish. Kind of reminds me of a blonde biere de garde. Alcohol strength is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is very fluffy and frothy. Prickly carbonation goes well to keep this refreshing in spite of the high alcohol. I found this at half-price as my grocery store was trying to get rid of them. Good buy for the money, but I don't know if I'd pay $10 for this at regular price.","goochpunch","May 11, 2013"

The beer's physical character is an accomplished balance of thirst-quenching prickliness and foamy smoothness. Taste? Apricots. It has to be classed as sweet, but completely free of cloyingness. The beer is refreshing but substantial. It's lighter, I suppose, than the estimable Maredsous Tripel, with which it shares stature, but in a good way. Put me down as a fan. Quite good.","Altrurian","Feb 01, 2013"

Hazy amber color with lots bubbles darting up from the bottom of the glass. Smells mostly of fruits and some grain, with some faint spices. The nose is good, but not as strong as others I've tried. Taste balanced and thin; nothing is overpowering. Fruity flavors up front; mango or apricot and apple I think, but the finish is a little more grainy. All of the fruit flavors are subtle and not overpowering. There is a definite bitter bite that stays with you for a while, but it's more subtle than others I've tried. The taste it leaves behind is like apple juice. This has a medium light mouthfeel, but the first thing I noticed about this beer when I took a sip was how carbonated it is. It's like drinking a fountain soda pop; fizzy on the tongue, then it thins out quickly. Overall a very enjoyable beer, and I recommend trying it.","cr0ckett","Aug 23, 2012"

The body is mildly hazy and filled with carbonation. The head sticks around for a while and shows no signs of fading any time soon. There’s a thick wall of lacing that just seems to corral the bubbles together. The aroma overall is wheaty with some mild spices, citrus fruits and even raisin. It’s very crisp overall, slightly bitter when it hits the sides of your mouth and it does have a mild alcohol flavor in the background.

Tropical fruit, light maltiness and slight funk in the nose, spicy yeastiness too. Fruit carries thru the taste as well, not too much hop bitterness for a Belgian P.A.

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The aroma was sweet with a fruit aspect as it was being poured into the chalice. The aroma was estery and fruity through the white moussy head and contained a very well done earthy and lightly spicy character. Sweet candy with a nice peppery backbone. Floral and fruity rule the day. The golden elixir was lightly hazy in the chalice but the white moussy head lasted very well to lace the glass. The flavor was very, very nice with a prominence of pepper well balanced with a malty light candy/caramel. The flavors worked very well together with a moderate level of bittering and an earthy and lightly grassy hop presence which kept the complexity of the flavor from beginning to end. The body was medium full and with a moderate level of carbonation the mouthfeel was nice and creamy. The finish was just dry with lasting fruit and pepper spice long and pleasant into the aftertaste and beyond. The alcohol was well hidden with a slight presence in the nose and then a decent level of warming that occurred post consumption. This is indeed a beer to seek out, well done and very enjoyable. 1 pint, 9.4 ounce corked and bailed bottle.","badbilly30","Mar 25, 2012"

It pours with a huge, slowly-dissipating head which is about as thick as a beer can have. The aroma is faintly of the trademark 'raw sugar' with a subtle noble hop presence. For such a flavorful beer, the aroma is surprisingly subtle. The flavor is similarly subtle with malt and raw sugar presiding over noble hops. This would be an uneventful beer were it not for the fact that it is, well, about as perfect as you can expect to find. The closest competition is Duvel and they are evenly matched. This is highly recommended. The 5-star rating was long pondered; it is not given lightly. The truth is that, after finishing the whole bottle, I cannot find fault.","matt20102","Nov 27, 2011"

4.15,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pale gold in color and rather cloudy. A gentle pour of roughly ten ounces into a tulip leaves about an inch of foam that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. The majority of the smell seems to come as a result of the yeast as in the nose I get a great deal of ester ranging from fruity citrus to spicy cloves. That is backed by a solid pale malt with a touch of spicy hop and some slight alcohol. The good score is because I expected a bit more strength. The taste follows the nose. Things start out quite spicy with pepper like flavors on top of a touch of sweetness that wraps up slightly bitter. As the beer warms and I get deeper into the bottle more of the yeast esters and flavor come out creating a dynamic experience. The mouthfeel is wonderfully light and almost effervescent as the fine carbonation makes it feel as though this beer floats in the mouth. The alcohol does become apparent though it is mainly through a great warming sensation and never cloying or overly oppressive. Overall this is a very solid beer, this is a tough style to separate oneself from the crowd as there are many world class offerings but this beer does manage to hold its own within that crowd.","fank2788","Nov 26, 2011"

The carbonation made it very bubbly and the Belgian-ish fruity sweetness (apricot?) was underlying throughout. The highlight of the beer, though, is the hop spice. Unlike most hoppy beers, Local 1 Ale did not have much bitter taste. Instead, it was spicy, almost like nutmeg. It tingled the tongue just enough to give the beer that extra goodness to make the beer stand out. This leaves a dry finish that goes well with the spicy hops flavor. It also has a strong but not overwhelming alcohol taste to it but that is to be expected because of the 9% ABV.

Fermented with Belgian yeast and bottle-conditioned. Pours a chill-hazed orange, with loads of carbonation and an inch of frothy white head that reduces to a fine cap. Hugely fruity aroma contributes orange, mango, papaya and pineapple, spicy/floral hops and earthy yeast. Complex, fruity, delicious. The palate adds to (or perhaps detracts from) this notes of chalky yeast, a few phenols, an almost harsh hop flavor and a lingering sweetness. Light and crisp at the start, but as the carbonation mellows, the body fills out. This brew has a very flavorful yeast and it is very easy to drink despite the ABV. It tastes quite authentic, and despite my nitpicking on the flavor, this is definitely worthy of a revisit.","mmmbeer","Jan 23, 2011"

Very complex flavor: the grainy pils malt sweetness, medium hop bitterness, complex yeast spiciness, and alcohol all fight to dominate but none of them overpowers the others. Yeast character features almonds, citrus, pear. This beer is a bit sweet up front, but dry in the finish. High carbonation helps dry it out, even with a medium body.

3.93,-4.8,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Very good - equal to some of the best Belgians. I took the cage off after letting the bottle sit outside the fridge to come to temperature. Then I got a little surprise as the cork gave a good pop and the bottle did a little gusher. Pours with a huge foamy, frothy, cream colored head that quickly settles to a small, but persistant cover and some lace. Color is a clear amber with some small bubble trails. Aroma is yeasty, malt, bread dough, grass, and a little fruit. Flavor is a little on the dry side at first and then yields to a mild sweetness; like the nose, and does go great with a variety of foods. Body is soft and carbonation is robust and a good match for the beer. Finish has duration, is like the flavor, and leaves a sense of satisfaction. Well done. Maybe not a session beer though.","drpimento","Oct 05, 2010"
3.87,-6.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"One finger pure white head small bubbles medium dissipation with minimal lacing. Golden orange body a bit cloudy (chill haze?) several streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is fairly fruity, meyer lemons, coriander, more fruity than spicy. The taste mirrors nose, pretty sweet. Medium mouthfeel, a bit heavy for the style, fairly dry finish due to yeast strain, decent effervescence. Pretty drinkable though the sweetness effects drinkability, not a lot of alcohol heat, fairly well hidden ABV kick. This beer certainly straddles the line between BSPA and a Saison, doesn't fit neatly into either category. Given the relatively high price point, I think next time I'll seek out Pranqster or Damnation or a real BSPA. Fairly tasty, but IMO not that great.","jdense","Oct 03, 2010"

The taste began with a lean towards citrus and bubblegum, followed by a more fruity/malt/caramel balance, and finished on a dry bitter orange peel note. Spritzy, yet medium-bodied mouthfeel.

Malty sweetness reminiscent of butter cookies and caramel combines with a fruity, estery flavor a la orange, banana, and tart apples. There is a tiny bit of funk that hints at the Saison style, but I would say this beer is correctly classified in the Belgian strong ale category. The alcohol content makes the drink pretty warming, as does the peppery, spicy character of this beer. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and effervescent, though the body is not too overwhelmingly heavy for a high octane beer. I appreciate how this lighter feel contributes to drinkability.

At 9%, you have to be wary of drinkability, especially w/ a 750 mL bottle - what, this isn't supposed to be a one-person show?

But there is something about it, probably the plethora of anise, that just doesn't click with me. The taste is more funky than the aroma, with the anise more subdued. The coriander and clove are strong. I like this beer's flavor a little more than the aroma, but it still seems odd for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It is not bad just odd. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a smooth texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, I can tell you if a beer is crafted with quality, and if I like. But, sometimes they aren't the same answer. This beer was most certainly crafted with quality, and I'm sure there are many people out there who would thoroughly enjoy it. However, I do not.

However, it was made in a Belgian style and must be reviewed against its style, which happens to include some of the best beers in the world. The flavor and aroma have a nice but fairly generic spice character of black pepper and clove. The yeast is earthy but not spectacularly so. There are some sweet fruits in the mix. The feel is smooth with fine, relatively gentle bubbles. The alcohol is well-hidden. I have heard (maybe from marketing materials) this beer compared to a saison, and I'm going to disagree with that characterization. It's just a generic BSPA that has neither big flaws nor big character.","popery","May 27, 2009"

The color is lighter and hazier than I expected, but at this point I am still hopeful that that this beer lived up to the ten dollars I spent at the brewery for it. I taste pear and plum very distinctly and im underwhelmed by anything else in this beer. A bit too watery by my standards to be considered great. In fact, i dont really like this beer...

The burn seems to linger inapropriately for a 9.00 abv beer and is way to present in the nose. None of the subtiltle fruit tones I get in a Duvel.

Poured a hazy orange-gold with a torrent of tiny bubbles effervescing from the nucleation point in the well of the bowl. Three inch bright white head sizzled and popped as it slowly dissipated leaving behind cloud-like formations of lacing in its wake. Nose suggests coriander, belgian yeast, candi sugar and perhaps a hint of anise, some light fruity esters and a kiss of booze at the back. Taste follows nose on this one - great complexity. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied; tingly carbonation with no burn, a little bit of tartness at the finish.

It is a very clear gold with several jets of fine carbonation bubbles jetting up to join the foam. Smell is remiscent of a Saison. Strong notes of sour apple, freshy fruity ethers, and a bit of yeast. The warm alcohol vapors were strong enough on the palate to make my ears pop.

The body is well-carbonated and lively on the tongue, while the hops kick in to add a nice bitter bite to the finish. Somewhat slick, smooth body with a medium consistency.

4.05,-1.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"First impression: There is a lot going on here. It's slick on the tongue, but the flavor profile isn't quite what I expected. I know it is described as a ""strong saison", but there alcohol profile is overly prevalent to me. That, and it seems ascetic, and a little metallic. I certainly taste the belgian sugars, but the sweetness serves as a background to everything else going on. As it warms, some spices come out, as well as some fruit (apple/pear, maybe.) The earthiness that I expected blends into the hop profile at the end, and the dryness never really manifests itself. I think I would like this more if it make it's alcohol content quite so well known. As it is, the mouthfeel is a little thin, not quite watery, but it feels like something is missing. Overall, the experience isn't quite what I expected. The sourness really doesn't agree with me, and the saison-like qualities are a little lacking. Disorganization is too strong a word, but it just doesn't want to grip me in the right places. The initial mouthful is better, but the lingering on the palate seems to feature what I didn't like about it. I want to chase it with a fresh glug, if that makes sense. Also, the booziness detracts from the overall quality for me, it just doesn't carry it too well, and that detracts from the drinkability. It's not a bad beer, and just might be to complex for my palate to appreciate all of what's going on. I think the fact that it is so different from what I was expecting through me for a loop.

A moderate sweetness from the candy sugar. Alcohol is a tad dominant toward the finish, which takes away from this overall. A pretty solid beer that has some flaws.

The flavor is light warm weather citrus fruits, most notably oranges or tangerine. Also yeasty and slightly spicy but not as spicy as I was expecting. This is medium to light-bodied, clean, very easy drinking with some carbonation and quite refreshing. The alcohol content is hardly noticed at all.

The brew itself is a natural, sunflower yellow tint with saffron hues. The head displays great retention and becomes rocky as the sampling continues and it laces in chunks. Aromas are pleasant but not overwhelming, fresh yeast. At first the flavors are slightly piqued by the lively carbonation but as the bottle oxidizes it settles. Fruit flavors of pear and green apple, grainy wheat, pale malt, slight nip in the ALC at the end. Sweeter than it smells but despite the fruit nuances it does not taste like a fruit beer. The higher % is well masked. Carbonation is high and yet not overwhelming; just vibrant all the way through. A good beer but not a God beer.

Right off I knew I was in for a treat; opening produced a loud pop, almost like a bottle of champagne. The color was a strong golden; with a thick opaque head that slowly dissolved over time. The aroma was absolutely incredible...a sweet musk with hues of hops in the background. Again the taste was incredible, smooth and hoppy, mellow and musky.

At first the taste was typical of this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but as it warmed a bit more malty, sugary, and hoppy characters made appearances in the taste profile. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with some creaminess to it, definitely helped me dismiss the high alcohol content. Likewise, despite being 9% ABV it was quite drinkable. I would definately be able to drink a whole bottle on my own.","Bitzy","Jun 16, 2008"

The smell had that hefe tingle to it, with spice and fruit hitting you. Taste was awesome. Perfect body to it, as I could feel it in the mouth but it was smooth enough to go right down.

There is a citrus fruit flavor that is dominant with vanilla tones, almost buttery like a good chardonay. Different flavors pop from all parts of your mouth and tongue. Initially it coats the mouth fully, then the high carbonation cleanses. Amazing drinkability for a 9% beer. This is an elite American produced Belgian style ale.","scottg","May 20, 2008"

Even better is the taste, which is opposite of how I normally experience these styles. Lovely burst of fruit, but never oversweet or sugary. Balance is the buzzword here: exceptional.

Generally I don't care much for Brooklyn Brewery beers, but I found this one to be quite exceptional. In the glass it had a golden straw color with a small head. As others have mentioned, the scent is very fruit, it reminded me distinctly of apple cider. The carbonation is fairly high and the taste is quite malty and sweet. The finish is very mild, which makes this beer very drinkable even with its 9% alcohol content.

4.37,5.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"750 Ml purchased caged and corked from Bottle King in Parsippany for $7.99... definitely the best beer that I've sampled from Brooklyn Brewery... in terms of a Belgian Strong, this is an excellent depiction of the style with an outstanding flavor that really hits home and is authentic in every sense of the word... nice golden, hazy, cloudy appearance with a minimial frothy head that soon dissipated, leaving a film of lace... smell was outstanding, complete with fresh fruit, florals, lemon, citrus, and slight coriander... taste strongly complemented the aroma with a superb, fresh, clear flavor full of grapefruit, pears, lemon-zest, esters, and citrus... very wholesome, refereshing, creamy, and thick taste that is certainly up there with some of the best... Brooklyn did very well with this one... very easily drinkable, which only took a slight hit due to the hefty 9% ABV... mouthfeel was also teriffic, as the beer felt like honey on the tongue... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended...","dsa7783","Feb 01, 2008"

The fragrance has sweet spices of some ginger and corriander, then some cloves and banana scents that are more like a hefeweizen. This followed by sweet aroma of candied sugar. At first taste there is the light taste of wheat, folowed by the taste of spices coming through, ginger, coriander, and little bit of a dried fruit flavor. The kicker is there is a hop kick at the end, with a grass and piny flavor. A total surprise since none was in the aroma. A very smooth feel at first, a medium bodied feel, then it gradually thins itself out. There is the feint tingle of carbonation on the back of the palate. Now I am not partial to the saison style, but this is different. It started like alot of belgians, had some surprises in the aroma, plus the unique flavor brought on at the end, makes this a must try beer.","cameraman","Jan 19, 2008"

Slightly sweet, fruity (apricots?), a bit citrusy (oranges), spicy, and, only at first, slightly musty. Taste is a bit sweet, somewhat yeasty, a touch spicy, and again quite fruity. At first it is sweet but then becomes fruity and just a bit sour. Then just before the finish the spices return (cloves). In the finish this brew gets yeasty and just a touchy funky. Since Garrett oliver described this as a strong saison I'll say that all the flavors I described are just what was intended. mouthfeel is good, lightish body that just barely leans toward medium and low-moderate carbonation. In terms of drinkability this is pretty good. I can't taste the alcohol at all but I get just a bit of a warming sensation to let me know its there.

This is very clean drinking and refreshing. Very polished and comes without the rawness this style sometimes is known for. Well made American version, reminds me alot of La Fin da monde.

Some yeasty, banana esters of the Belgian persuasion came forth. The most striking characteristic of this beer is the very dry and fully attenuated taste and mouthfeel. It is incredibly drinkable, or as the Belgians say, digestible, with very little of its 9% ABV being perceivable to the drinker. I felt like I could just keep quaffing this one, thought my rational mind told me not to. Feels drinkable as a session beer. I liked the fact that it had so little residual sugar and cloying sweetness, yet retained a complexity and character worthy of the strong Belgian genre. Very well done brew by Brooklyn Brewery.","BabaJohn","Dec 17, 2007"

Taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of yeast and peppery spice. It seems with each drink I can taste a different fruit (pear, apricot, orange, lemon, grapefruit). Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, a bit creamy with moderate carbonation that has a zip to it. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. The alcohol isn't noticable in the taste, but you know it's there because after drinking it a while the alcohol warmth hits you.

The beer is a deep hazy straw yellow with a few random bubbles climbing the sides. This is a nice looker. The aroma is lightly banana estery, sucrose-sweet, with orange and lemon zestyness. There is a mild yeasty spice running through it. As it warms a little, there is a solid puff of alcohol in there that plays nicely with the spice character. The flavor brins a good bit of yeasty spice, creamyness, and light mustyness. Orangepeel sweetness comes through along with a light sucrose sweetness. The finish is a light alcohol and mild spicy hop bitterness and a touch of raw hop leaf taste. The spicing and mustyness really come through on the finish. The alcohol is a little solventy, but not offensive at all. Warmth brings out some more fruity esters in the aroma as well. Mouthfeel is fairly thick with a moderate carbonation. It foams a little after taking a sip, which adds a bit of body to it without being too airy. Overall, this is a good brew. I like the musty and earthy yeast character and I think that a little more time will make this pop a little more.

Based on the initial aroma I would have definitely said there was spices added to this brew, but the flavor, while certainly spicy driven, is not so nearly convincing and even the clove dominated aromatic notes after the beer warmed a bit is purely fermentation derived. I really need to get another bottle of this, as I feel like some aging (a year or two) will add back some missing complexity.

As a fan of the Brooklyn Brewery in general, I am eager to try anything new they have to offer. Add to that the fact that this beer undergoes 100% refermentation and carbonation in the bottle, and this one should not be missed. Pours a pale straw golden yellow with a tightly knit head. The head recedes quickly, but there is nice lacing. Aromas are subtle--light grains and a little banana. The taste is no less than exceptional. Esters, grains, hops, carbonation--everything works together here for a common cause. The mouthfeel is somewhat slick and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation to give a little prickle on the palate. I can't get over how much this beer reminds me of a more refined DeRanke XX Bitter. Similar malt and hop profiles with less emphasis on being bitter and more focus on balance.

Aroma has elements of pear, grain, orange, and pineapple. Taste begins on the sweet side with juicy fruits and sugars, and then ends on a somewhat dry, champaign oriented note. Mouthfeel is medium, with the 9% alcohol extremely well hidden. Carbonation id moderate, and as it warms becomes even less noticeable. Easy to drink as well, it gets tastier with every sip.

There is a nice tangy aftertaste but this beer passes the palate very cleanly. I remember reading a review of this beer in the New York Times and I was determined to get a hold of a bottle--which also started my trading addiction.

Solid layer of foam lasts throughout the glass leaving some beautiful lacing. Yeasty smell backed by some white fruit - orange, peach and mango. Definitely fruity and sweet smelling. Complex taste of white fruit and yeasty spiciness with some tartness towards the end. That's the Saison part kicking in. Hallertauer Perle and Styrian Golding hops lend to a dry finish. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink for a 9% beer as the alcohol is well-hidden, but does leave a warmth in the belly. Very-well done.

Upon first sip, I can't help but think tripel. Hefty alcohol warmth with some doughy pale malt sweetness that is cut with a healthy peppery carbonation and then moves towards a lightly drier finish. Some astringent grassy suggestions in the transition between the initial sweetness and lightly citrusy finish. A very nice medium to full bodied beer with a good carbonation level and hoppiness to keep the sweetness in check. Alcohol seems more prevalent in the nose than it is in the taste, which is a bonus.

The one I tasted poured in a good pale yellow colour and with two fingers of creamy foam. The smell was dominated by a sweetness, yeast, and citrus (much like a Weissbier is). Luckily the taste was not as sweet as the smell indicated but it was still a little syrupy. The taste was also framed by notes of crackers, yeast and quite a lot of alcohol.

Soft honey sweetness up front gives way to a somewhat grassy bitterness followed by a pepperiness. All the while the tartness is there in the background and lingering in the aftertaste, some light bready and belgian yeastiness as well that mix with the light maltiness.

The beer was poured into a Duvel tulip, and it looked quite a bit like the original BSPA. The color was pale yellow (i. e., Pilsner like), and the body was extremely clear. The head was easily formed as a result of active and vigorous carbonation, but proportionally it seemed smaller than the great examples of the style. Aroma was oaky, Brettanomyces funky, and also had a tinge of orange peel to it. I liked the smell, but it was a bit busy in my opinion. Taste was spicy, quite noticeably Belgian with a confluence of bitter, sweet, tangy, and earthy flavors, but suffered from the one flaw that most American imitations of the style seem to be affected by. It just wasn't dry enough. The alcohol presence was also bigger than it should have been, making this probably a lot closer to a Tripel than a BSPA.

The finish has a long sustained hit of candi sugar, that almost tastes like palm sugar. Sweet and creamy. The mouthfeel is relatively light and refreshing, but luxuriously creamy and smooth. Each sip I take causes this beer to grow on me more and more. Beautifully drinkable, and the alcohol is well hidden.","Georgiabeer","Jun 27, 2007"

Corked and caged 750 ml bottle from 2007, chilled and poured into tulip glass. Head rose fast, good effervescence, with three fingers of fluffy white foam; retention seems good and lacing apparent. The body is a golden, glowing straw color, with peachy highlights. The nose is quite good, very aromatic with tons of light citrus, minor hints of yeast, definitely pilsner malt in here, with notes of citrus maybe apple, light pear and just a touch pepper. Id like to make a guess on the choice of hops: saaz and maybe styring golden, but thats just a guess. Taste is pleasant and very quaffable. Its very soft on the palate all tough rather complex. Carbonation tickles the tongue just enough, with out being too much, keeps it light and gives it a sense of brevity. The same esters are present in the flavor as in the nose. At the start its rather full and juicy (almost wine like) then finishes rather dry, very good. The bitterness is subtle and doesnt really express its self until the finish, which is prefect for the style. Not quite a sessional beer, but great as suggested. This beer is a pleasure to drink I will definitely buy again for food pairing. Congrats Brooklyn.","mmcave","Jun 21, 2007"

Incredibly complex taste that has a unique blend of boldness and mild character that can be as sweet and mild as honey but answers back with a kick of bitterness.

Very subtle alcohol aroma, and it's well hidden, although it comes across as bitter rubbing alcohol when it does. Gentle fruits, like peaches and grapes, and white wine.

The flavors are earthy, tart apple, spicy, slightly sweet, hint of lemon, a shot of hops in the end, well balanced. IMO this is a saison, good balance between sweet and tart/bitter, granny apple taste. The feel is fizzy and astringent, a bit watery for a saison or BSPA.

But the taste... oh the taste reminds me of my favorite De Jolle brews for sure. The BA review says that basically all of the ingredients come from Belgium, so technically this beer is not from America it would seem (but all the credit goes to Yankee ingenuity). The same sweetness and slight bitterness that we get with all Belgian beers applies to this one. It goes down very easy, almost too easy.

Once uncorked, it poured cloudy gold with a dense head into a tulip Duvel glass -- looked picture perfect and left thin lines to form a delicate lace. Aromas were mostly sweet fruity phenols, floral hops, and yeast. A hint of what's to come. I thought the taste ranked among the best -- lighter and more subtle than Tremens, but with just as much flavor. Incredibly well balanced with sweet light malts up front, tender floral hops in the back with a slight bitterness, and yeasty spice.

The alcohol is virtually nonexistent in the palate. Spicy and lightly floral, very pleasant interpretation of the style. Mouthfeel is light with pronounced carbonation, very indicative of the style.

Nothing like I assumed from the appearance. Maybe a bit to heavy for the style. Creamy with more orange and coriander. Great yeast character. Wonder which one they used?

Just a twinge of alcohol also hits my nose along with possibly some slight yeast. Flavor sips at first quite sweet with reminders of pears along with some citrus fruit and some spice. Alcohol quickly coems in to dry out the body, which is medium at most with a slight bit of yeast flavors. The body again is medium, and the combined carbonation and alcohol phenols quikly make this a bit bitey on the tongue. However, this is scarily drinkable! Oh God, a whole bottle all by myself?

Yeasty with slight bready notes, though they don't leave that usual chalky mouthfeel. Dry mouthfeel with a lemony finish that doesn't pucker the lips. Spritzy bubbles remind me of champagne a bit and tend to take over the later half of the mouthfeel I'm not sure this is a belgian strong ale. I think I'd stick it under the saison or a strong saison.

Smells malty sweet with spices and some citrus. Maybe cloves? A pleasant aroma; not overwhelming. Subtle hints of peppery pineapple. Very nice. The taste here is delicious. A musky malt flavor throughout, with notes of pepper and clove. Slight lemon character in there. Has a dry white wine quality to it as well. Leaves a pungent but unoffensive bitterness in the back of the mouth upon the finish. Definitely more complex and more enjoyable after it warms up a bit. True to the style, for sure, but this definitely maintains an American craft brew signature. Garrett Oliver and company have done well with this one.

But Hennepin is about half the price for similar quality.","AChamberlain","Mar 21, 2007"
4.15,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an almost clear perfect gold color with a sticky bright white head that leaves lacing and a collar. Very intriguing aroma of interesting sweet aromatics (left over from the sugar, I assume) along with some earthy hop notes and a slightly oxidized (after some time warming up in the glass) pearish smell. On the palate, huge carbonation and a touch of that Mauritian sugar, followed by substantial hop bitterness and raw alcohol. Some spiciness comes out at the finish (tastes like a yeast byproduct, not added spices), which is quite dry and long. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation, with some hoppy acidity but also some residual sugar making for a medium body. The mouthfeel is what places this somewhere between a dry saison and a thicker, sweeter Belgian golden ale. Overall, this is quite an interesting brew, sitting as it does between two famous and important styles. It will be interesting to see how this brew ages, but for right now it combines some of the better characteristics of each style without sacrificing much in the way of flavor or mouthfeel.","geexploitation","Mar 19, 2007"
4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brooklyn Local 1 easily holds its own with those big boys (or ladies as they may be). Found my 750 mL bottles for 9.99 (or a 2 for $16) on Freshdirect.com. Beer delivered to your door. It's good to be alive.","ommegangpbr","Mar 19, 2007"

3.53,-14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is a little oily. Carbonation is light. All around it's a good beer, not greatly impressive to me, and I don't think I'm missing the point of the style. It just doesn't suit me incredibly well.","Litterbean","Mar 16, 2007"
4.45,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Interesting bottle, caged and corked, no freshness indication. Pours light yellow , cloudy, supporting a long lasting fluffy looking near white head. Leaves nice looking splotchy/spotty and ringed lacing. Nice looking beer. Bright, fresh smelling. Notes of more lime, pepper, yeast, grassy, smells so good, time to dive in for a swig. More lime, Belgiany yeast, peppery spice, gin, honey, melon, soap, yum, sucker for the style and this one has got it going on. Fine creation from Brooklyn. Looking forward to trying it with a nice summer meal, salad, cheeses, chicken, fish, BBQ etc. Wide and year round distribution in the NYC area hopefully...life is good...","Billolick","Mar 14, 2007"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a large white frothy head. The head leaves great lacing and lasts along time. The color is alot lighter than other strong ales,but it does look good. The smell is pungent with sweet malt,alcohol,lemon,pepper,and corriander. The smell is candy sugar,lemon,wheat,pepper,and alcohol. Not ,bad,but I have to say this is more like a Saison than a strong ale. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. A very good beer that I think is listed in the wrong style.","jmz62565","Mar 12, 2007"
4.18,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Brooklyn meets Belgium -- two of my favorite beer sources -- in the latest offering from the Brooklyn Brewery. The Local 1 comes in an unusual 750-ml bottle (the cursive, trademark ""B" is etched subtly into the neck of the bottle and absent entirely from the large label). This batch is brewed using 100 percent refermentation--a rare method in which the beer is conditioned within the bottles, not before--giving it a natural effervescence. The resulting ale has a rich, golden color with a cloudy head that never entirely disappears and leaves a bubbly lace residue when swirled in the glass (I used a wine glass). Aromatic and sweetly scented. It's light on the tongue but has a complex flavor, with a hint of honey that masks the high alcohol content (9% ABV), and no bitter aftertaste.","jozols","Mar 09, 2007"
4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"When did Williamsburg get moved to Belgium? And did anyone alert the (wannabe/ex-) hipsters? Seriously though, this has become my favorite American Belgian-style ale, and is easily one of the best Belgian Strong Pale Ales overall. This is an excellent ale, and any fan of the style owes it to themselves to give it a try.","auntfloyd","Mar 09, 2007"
3.8,-8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D: The ale is very drinkable. The abv is moderate and the spice profile is a strong enough to make this an enjoyable beer.","akorsak","Feb 17, 2007"
