"Pours a clear gold, fluffy white head, settles slowly leaving a few rings of lace on the glass. Smell: coriander, honey, pear, herbal, orange and peppery notes. Taste: pear, sweet apple and grape, coriander, biscuit, spicy and mildly grassy in the finish. This is pretty tasty. Best by 8/2015?"

"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly white head that has moderate retention. aromas of light sugary malt with bits of honey. Tart berry and pomme fruits come through nicely as well as some yeasty earthy esters. The flavor holds what the aroma promised, but adds a touch of warming alcohol. Medium body, sparkly carbonation. Nice brew, thanks for sharing!"

"Sweet and chewy. This reminds me as if someone added a cerise to British Mild. Good head and lace."

"Raul's not trippin, but he's not hatin'. Light Beligian yeasts, met by more simple flavors and textures like a 3rd grade spelling bee. Some fruit, some spice, a bit sweet like Shirley Temple shaking a cocktail... Not memorable in the least, but easy drinking for those easy drinkers."

"As its sister, Caracole Ambree, it is a unique and interesting beer, though this one is heavily condimented. Nice brew."

"Overall, a pleasant beer that I would happily partake in another."

"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a fine two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Nice aroma of Belgian yeast, bready malt, light fruit juice; apple and stone fruit, cloves. Flavor is light apple and pear juice, clove, light citus and bready malt. Medium bodied with a suprising creaminess. Tastes almost subdued after the aroma, but the light fruit flavor and malt are so nicely melded that this is a delight to drink. Finishes with faint sweet malt and Belgian spicing. Very difficult to believe that this light mellow ale is 8%, the alcohol is completely covered."

"Poured this Belgian Strong Pale Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy pale yellow color, produced a nice white head, nice retention and left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of citric lemons, semi-sweet pale malt and floral hops. Medium bodied, a foundation of pale malt, lemon citric hop bitterness and eastery yeast. Finishes dry. Overall, nice version of the style, aggressively hopped and full of malt backbone. Nice session beer."

"O: This would be a fantastic first round in a Belgian tasting. This beer would set the stage beautifully to be followed by a dubbel, tripel...quad. This beer is like Belgians - 101. Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I think it's a really good value. If you've never tried it, there is no reason to hesitate."

"Overall: This is a solid Belgian strong pale ale across the board but nothing really special."
"Smells sweet. Taste is good. Strong bite for such an easy flavor. A bit astringent. I like leffe a lot and this does not quite meet that because of the bitterness. Leffe is smoother. I do like the label of the beer and the brewery does seem to offer traditional Belgian styles. I will try some of there other beers."

"Smells strongly of Belgian yeasty funk, green and black tea blends, blueberry compote, and a light lemon peel / mango combo. Tastes of funky Belgian yeast with a middling-sized dollop of spicy phenols over the top of a blend of light pear and apple esters with a certain raw cereal graininess and a very light minty hop garnish in the finish. It's pretty good, but the bottled version is not nearly as good as the hazy memory from a certain special night of revelry in which I had it fresh from the tap... sadly, I had forgotten to bring my notebook along that evening and I am left with naught but hazy and nostalgic glowing memories of a draft pour that this bottle did not quite live up to... Ah, memories..."

"Slightly hazy golden-yellow pour with a thin ring of bubbles for a head. Muted aroma, toasted grains, light fruit esters. Taste was very bland and lifeless, very light, almost like a light lager, notes of mild yeast, pear and stone fruit, a hint of grass and tea-like hops. On the plus side, this beer sure went down easy, light-bodied, low carbonation, and a barely-noticeable 8%ABV. But the lack of any good flavor just made this a downer for me, and for the price, it just wasn't worth it at all."

"Pours a slightly murky yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruits, spices, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly soapy flavor on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but smells better in my opinion."

"The alcohol is listed on the bottle as 7.5%."
"On tap at Jacs (Madison). UnderwheIming. A nice flavor, to be sure. And refreshing on this hot summer afternoon. But although it resembles other Belgian pales with its Belgian yeast and round sweetness (like Atomium, Piraat, and Delirium Tremens), it doesn't measure up to others in character or distinction."
"On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach."

"O: Good beer for summer, well drinkable and a short finish."
""
"Picked up a bomber at Bruisin' Ales in Asheville. I was in the mood for something new and Belgian. This brew turned out very much like I expected and that is a pretty good description overall - rock solid, no surprises. Pours a cloudy light bronze with a fizzy white head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of light fruit, telltale Belgian yeast and coriander. Taste is light with non-citrus as well as light non-citrus fruit, also coriander and other ""earthy"" but light"" spice. The elevated ABV is very well buried. Very nice. I will buy again."
""
""

""
"Overall: Good beer overall. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall - Grab a 330 if you can. I'm not too deep into this 750 and not so excited about the finish. Kind of a confusing drink, where some elements really rise above the average blonde, while others simply fall short - however, the alcohol level is hidden very well."
""
"Overall it seems to be less than the sum of its pieces. It's not bad - I wouldn't turn one down if it were offered - but it's nothing like competitive with Duvel or Don de Dieu in the style so I don't think I'd buy it again."
"This poured out as a hazy looking yellowish gold color. The smell of the beer was of grains and some bready Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer reminded me a little bit of a wheat beer more than a Pale Ale. The flavors were soft and finished with a little bit of a bitterness in the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel of the beer was drinkable and had a lot of sporatic carbonation. Overall this beer was decent I think, nothing too exciting but it was nice to try."
""

"Overall â€“ The alcohol is well hidden and the flavours work really well together. This beer is ideal for the warmer weather and my glass was empty before I knew it. I'll pick this one up again for sure."
"A very easy to drink beer, but just not enough to keep my interest very long."
"Nose quite well fermented yeast, citrus perceives in the background. The taste is average, not great folly, just with a peach syrup rough but not that exciting and gives a too syrupy beer. This is not to do him honor. Slight aftertaste, unappetizing. A beer just average."
"O: A solid Belgian pale ale. Delicate and lightly flavored, but an easy drinker as well."
"Beer is light in body and heavily carbonated on the palate. Nice yeast and floral flavors of the beer throughout. The finish is a little dry but not overly so. This is a solid decent beer from a good brewery. Used to be a staple of mine when I was stranded in the former beer desert of Florida. I would and have had this again."
"I expect of a beer to bring real joy. This is a classic example. The sun starts shining even when it is midnight."
"A big soapy white head of 3+ fingers appeared before the pale gold body with a light haziness revealed itself. Splothcy lace. Nose is typical of a Belgian Strong Golden, reminiscent of Duvel in many respects. Spicy, light floral, with a touch of alcohol and a prevalent sweetness and some light fruity notes - maybe a hint of pear. Taste is spicy with a high carbonation to compliment it, sweet malts take over as the carbonation trickles away with a flash of alcohol that isn't too subtle. Some mild graininess also. High carbonation with some good drinkability. Not something to usurp Duvel of its title in the style, but certainly pleasant and a nice example."
"O: Not bad, aroma/flavor were good, but seemed a little weak. Based on other reviews I would give it another try."
"The CPJ"
"Overall this beer does not stand out as much as the first time I tried it, but at that point I had only tried 3 or so Belgian ales. This is an excellent beer and dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Really tasty and balanced with only a hint of booze in the aroma. Was afraid this would be a little too sweet but it was really easy-drinking (had a sort of ""sweet Duvel"" quality to it)."
"D: A well made, very drinkable beer."
"D: High ABV, but very nice on a sunny evening."
"O: Not the best of it's style and I can't justify the price."
"O: Very tasty. I would definitely get this again. The finish is perhaps a bit too dry, but overall it is very enjoyable."
"Overall not bad, a little lighter than I expected, but very drinkable, especially for 8%."
"D - Good and unique; I would definitely have a few more; a beer to be enjoyed sip after sip"
"A pleasant, well-rounded strong Belgian ale, no edges here. Outgoing, and plays well with others, until, I suppose, that hidden alcohol strength becomes blindingly apparent, and engenders cravings for more heady, darker Belgian offerings."
"Drinkability: A good Belgian brew - you get some upfront sweet maltiness, a complex spice character, and a nice display of fruitiness. A little bit of everything."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"This was a bit of a let down for me, being one of the few BSPA's I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. A ""Double Wit"" may be a more suiting title for this. There's nothing really wrong with this beer; possessing a good nose, taste, and feel, it's just not what I was looking for. Worth a try, but as long as Duvel is readily available to me, I'll be sticking to it."
"Very wheaty, in fact the brewery owner told us the beer is a 20% wheat brew. The beer is named after Adolphe Sax (inventor of the Saxophone) who was from the nearby town of Dinant."
"jd"
"D: Very drinkable. Not a whole lot to ponder, and nothing to complain about either."
"Rather average overall."
"Drinkability/Overall: I tasty beer if you like sour type fruits. not especially complex or refined, but tasty. unfortunately the tastes build up quickly so not a real drinker"
"The sum of the parts just don't quite add up for me with this beer. It's not unpleasant, but neither is it impressive."
"D: Very good indeed. this was a favorite at the Parkway Tavern"
"An overly sweet and, to be frank, simple Belgian strong ale. There are many better ones out there."
"D- This is a complex, layered beer that is flat out well done. It is not a session beer for me, as after a couple of these, one might get a little worn. I actually really enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it, though maybe not as one's first bspa, as it is rather aggressive with some of its flavors and with the alcohol warmth."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty solid BSPA that is more on the spicy than fruity side. Extremely stiff competition in this category, so the beer is obviously way better than its rating may suggest."
"Definitely recommend!"
"D: While initially really impressive, it started to peter out early on. The cherry coming out in the taste was really pleasant, but on the whole, this beer is jarring in how different its smell and taste are. I'd probably recommend it more as an autumn brew than for spring or summer."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - Very nice and drinkable; seems more like a hopped dry mead than a beer."
"I expected a little stronger tasting beer, but it's still a pleasant ale overall."
"Overall I was quite pleased with this beer. It was extremely drinkable and refreshing, and I look forward to the next time I have it again."
"Reviewed from my notes. It has an opaque dirty/tarnished gold color and a white foam head. There is some great lacing. The aroma is a good combination of earthy yeast and floral hops. Saxo has a great smooth, malty flavor with just the right amount of hops. It has a clover honey sweetness that I really like. It's a full bodied beer. There is a medium amount of carbonation, but it feels lighter than it is. It's as close to a perfect mouthfeel as I can recall having. It is also sumpremely drinkable This glass in front of me will go down very easily. I could drink Saxo all night."
"Poured a cloudy orange with frothy two finger head that stays around and leaves lace. A classic sour yeasty funk of orange and citric notes along with hints of sweet malts. A prickly, lively beer thanks to carbonation, that citric flavors like orange and dark fruit flavors (hints of apricot and pear) poke through in a light to medium bodied beer. Some caramel and candy sugar sweetness as well mix with the beer for a smooth ride that finishes crisp and clean."
"Belgian bomber bottle, caged and corked, purchased at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours slighly cloudy, lighter apricot amber. Typical and not too excitng head, and moderate lacing left behind. Nose of soft fruits, spice/hint of Belgiany yeasty. Easy drinking and quite pleasant BSPA, the 8% quite well hidden. Fruity and refreshing, this beer served as the steaming liquid for some clams and then went great with the clams and a plate of pasta. The finish has notes of pepper, spiced apricots, phenolic yeasties and more then ample Belgian tastyness. A thoroughly enjoyable offering."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- One of the finest textures of any Belgian beers I've sampled, the mouthfeel is stunning... smooth and rolling foam that only gets better the longer it's there. A pleasant surprise from the depths of the fridge, I'll gladly recommend this to any fan of the style."
"Overall, a very smooth and drinkable everyday Belgian beer."
"D - great smell and balanced taste"
"D: Quite drinkable at 8%... not the best Belgian strong pale ale I've had, but it's still very good, and very solid. And does it earn an extra point for having a snail playing a saxophone on the bottle/glass? Yes. Yes it does."
"D: A rather nice beer, but nothing to write home about since the belgians make lots of better Strong Pale Ales."
"Drink: Not a bad beer, but not one of my favorites. It's a mediocre Belgian Strong Pale that doesn't quite stack up to elite brews like Delirium and Duvel. Don't be afraid to give this one a try, but don't expect a top notch beer. The bottle is pretty cool, though."
"It pours a hazy gold, with a billowy, fluffy white head that lasts only a short while. Holding it up to the light, one can see light through it but little else; shapes and images are not readable. Aromas of light fruit (mainly apple), spices, and a mild maltiness are detectable. It's not a strong aroma, but it is pleasant. The taste is full of lighter flavors, including (but not limited to) apple and pear, cardamom and cinnamon, and a nice, earthy hop bitterness at the finish that blends particularly well with the lingering fruit flavors. The warming alcohol is pronounced after the taste has subsided a bit, which is something I certainly appreciate. It's a bit fizzy for my taste, but it's light and refreshing while adding enough complexity to be interesting."
"Drinkability: A good Belgian brew - you get some upfront sweet maltiness, a complex spice character, and a nice display of fruitiness. A little bit of everything."
"Overall this is a good beer for the style but none of the flavors were intense enough to be anything more. Worth a shot."
"Overall it is a pretty decent Belgian Strong Pale Ale, would take some of it's contempoaries, namely Duvel over it any day, but I think I would put it slightly above Delirium Tremens."
"Notes - Plenty of carbonation made for a decent mouthfeel."
"I had high hopes for the Saxo since I am a big fan of Belgian pale/blonde ales and it did not disappoint. This is a tasty beer that is well suited for either dinner or casual drinking."
"Saxo really celebrates the succulent sweetness of malt with candy sugar, but balances with yeasty spice with little influence from hops, spice additions, or unruly off flavors. This beer signifies what's best about Belgian beer!"
"overall - I'd definitely buy this one again. A thoroughly enjoyable brew; I just wish Cacacole beers were more widely available."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a thin foamy white head. Spicy aroma with light fruit and slight alcohol presence. Very quaffable, slightly carbonated and spicy with a sweet, dry finish. Nice balance of spice and light fruit notes (apple, pear, grape) with a creamy mouthful."
"My bottle was 7.5%, not the 8% quoted above."
"Taste is dominated by the yeast. There are some higher alcohols, solvent notes and a warm alcohol feeling. One of these Belgian, superbalanced beers which are hard to describe. You just know this is right."
"Pours an amber golden colored body, with a very fizzy, medium head, creamy white in color, but diminishing. Good lacing. Has a flowery aroma, and some fruit. Has a spicy flowery taste, some light fruit like apple, pear. Light taste."
"Pale golden color that appears clear. Decent head that dissipates rather quickly and little lacing. A clearly dominate fruit aroma with a tinge of honey. Fits the style, if not just a little weak. Crisp body with a sweet initial feel and a dry finish; average carbonation. Overall a good beer, easy drinkability but a little weaker than then the Belgian Blonde's I'm used to."
"D - This is a pretty nice beer. Pricy but quite good."
"Smells nice and tart, with a lot of citrus esters immediately apparent, then hints of the malt backbone. Tastes quite similar, though hop bitterness comes through to balance the tartness. Some earthy malt rounds it out. Quite well balanced; overall, a good, refreshing Belgian."
"D - Very drinkable, the complexity of the malt and yeast profile make for an interesting beer that goes down easily due to its dryness."
"nice blend this time around. same color with lighter belgian sugar cane. light and lemony. a strong clove. and some fruit. light orange. mellow hop. quite refreshing. much better when not too dated."
"Overall great beer...glad I finally reviewed it after drinking it many times."
"hints of fruit maby some grapefruit and a nice yeastey flavor, thier is a strong alcohoal taste in the finish, this is a siper for sure that improves as it warms up, i dont know if it was worth 16 bucks for a 4 pack, but i had to have it for the art work on the bottle, i would drink agan and have added one bottle to my cellar"
"Overall - Got this on sale for $10/4 pack at Beers of the World, I found this an excellent Belgian blonde. Very well balanced, flavorful, and easily drinkable. Alcohol is hardly detected at all until the end where the temperature increases. It may sneak up on you! Would pair well with a light lunch (tuna melt?). I'll let the others cellar a bit before cracking another one open. For some reason, the past two bottles sampled were highly over carbonated. They started bubbling and producing head as soon as I popped open the top so be careful with yours. Will buy again though."
"Drinkability was outstanding. This beer was refreshing and light yet packed with flavor. Furthermore, the 7.5% ABV was hardly noticeable. Pair this one with a mussel pot and some spicy shrimp or drink it solo for a refreshing treat on a warm summer day."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into 20oz pint glass. Firm pour results in a 3 finger head that slowly diminishes. Color is a hazy amber with light sediment. Smells of yeast citrus fruits and an underlying sweet funk. Light funk and wheat on the tongue. Lots of carbonation, sweet finish. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, carbonation cleanses the palate. Highly drinkable, sweetness could become cloying."
"This is a simple but tasty beer. Sweet, but not cloying, and rich with fruity citrus flavors. I want to make this an ice cream its so tasty and candy-like. Really, it's like beer and fruit smoothie. Still, there's enough balancing bitterness and carbonation to make this a great warm-weather beer. Good for a fruity non-fruit beer."
"Medium-colored amberish-gold with a small, white, creamy head that quickly diminished to a film. Good lacing. The smell is quite mild. Mostly Belgian yeast and some malts. A little fruit in there and a hint of spice. Taste is bigger than the aroma but not big by any means. More Belgian yeast, straw, strawberry. It starts out malty and on the sweet side but finishes dry with a small, short hit of hops. It has a medium-light body, lightly dry texture and soft carbonation. This was a pretty decent beer, but nothing to oo-and-ah about."
"Pours a hazy dark straw color with a nice consistent white foam cap. Aromas of honey, butterscotch malt sweetness is light, some green apple and a mild yeast character. Starts with some light caramel sweetness, apple, light spice, lemon in the back, bitter hops and funky belgian yeast flavors moves in midway. The yeast is a bit dirty, or earthy maybe. Nice level of carbonation although the mouthfeel is a bit thickish on the palate. Very drinkable particularly for 8%."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Closely mirrors the smell with a big spicy banana bread flavor. Undertones of orange peel, green apple and clove. Light-to-medium in body. Sweetness makes this more of a sipper, and I could see it becoming slightly cloying in large quantities."
"D-Could have a few, though my wallet may not."
"The mouthfeel is nice and adds a fairly drinkable element to the brew. The carbonation level is just perfect. The odd must flavor still nags me in the back of my head. If i knew what it was maybe it wouldn't bother me so much."
"Overall, I have had much better in the past. It was just not my thing what so ever. Not a good representation of the style, and just way too bland of a Belgian. There are much better ones out there, this is pretty much just average."
"D: I like this beer alot. for 7.5% ABV, it is very easy to drink and its lightness makes it even easier. Nice, interesting flavours and a crisp, well-balanced mouthfeel. I've bought it before and I will buy it again. Call me crazy, but it really reminds me of ketchup-flavoured chips :-) Well done Caracole."
"Overall-misses the bar compared to other Belgians, almost sickly sweet to me and lacks the complexity of others Belgians. Cellering might improve it. Not my favorite version."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I'd rather have with food. Definitely not a beer I prefer to drink on a whim by itself."
"Drinkability is high, as you'd expect. All in all, nothing terribly stand-out here, but no real weakness either. Easily enjoyable beer."
"Will have to try out the 750 mL next time"
"A very yeoman-like, competent, straight-up-the-middle interpretation of a Belgian blonde, not particularly unusual or unique, but nonetheless highly competent, drinkable, and enjoyable."
"This was a very good beer and am looking forward to having some more of it in the future."
"750 ML bottle bought caged and corked from Gary's in Madison for about $7.99... ""Belgian Blond Ale"" on the logo sticker with a sea-shell creature holding up a saxophone... Pours a lucid, clear, applejuice color with a nice foamy head that soon dissipated... some rising carbonation is present... smell is very sweet, with an apple, pear, fruit, and alcohol aroma... although not entirely strong, the 8% ABV is noticeable in the ultra-sweet yet light taste... flavor has a strong floral and grapefruit essence with esters and a grainy candy taste... not completely blown away by this sample, but a pleasing depiction nonetheless... a very sweet, sugar-laden brew... Not bad at all... Certaily worth a try..."
"Pours a slightly clouded straw gold with minimal head. Nose is strong with a lemon citrus tone and yeast. Some alcohol present. Flavor is tart and tangy with a leafy lemon like flavor. Seems to be a touch of mint on there as well. Feel is nice and even with a smooth level of carbonation. Oh so drinkable. The flavor profile is so smooth and easily drinkable. A damn good BSPA, though lacking the complexity that other heavy hitters carry."
"This is the first time I've had a Saxo, and I wasn't sure what to expect. This brew pours a bright golden colour, with a fluffy white head that settled down to a thin skim in my Duvel tulip glass in relatively short order. The smell is excellent; almost liek a saison. It's got a bit of that funky, sparp Belgian character that I love. The taste is rather light, fruity and a bit sharp, and the 8% alcohol is hidden very well. Still, I keep thinking Saison with this beer (which is not a bad thing!). Mouthfeel is mediumly carbonated yet lively. A sweet aftertaste stays on the tongue after the swallow. Drinkability is pretty darn good."
"This is a very nice beer and one I'd never noticed until a recent trip to Trader Joes. Pick one up if you can."
"Drinkability : biÃ¨re correcte dans le style Belgian strong ale"
"more spices when i finally sip the beer, though of a much more earthy denomination. it's lively yet full of sweetness. the bitterness is tea-like, and a little flimsy"
"A very drinkable beer despite the alcohol. However this is not the flavor I crave for BSPA. A good beer, but I will stick with Duvel and the like."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to stick with for a whole evening, especially if youÂ’re in a Belgian kind of mood."
"An interesting Pale; bland at times and very phenolic in flavor, but not unpleasant."
"D: A great balance between sweet, tangy, funky, dry, and spicy. Refreshing."
"D: A very good beer, not the best BSPA I've ever had, but very enjoyable and drinkable for the style. Having it on-tap was a plus. Big thanks to the Thirsty Traveler Kevin Brauch for turning me on to this little brewery in Belgium."
"I first had this at a beer tasting at a new market in South Florida and ended up buying a six pack. Have had other Caracole, all of which were enjoyable and this one also falls into that group. I guess I better try more of their beers. If you haven't done so already, try this beer."
"Nothing outstanding here, but a good solid beer."
"Very drinkable, barely showing it's 8% alcohol. Super-enjoyable, glad I got a 4-pack this time. Hey Belgium: I love you."
"B'ham UK"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a large head that dies down quickly. Smell is typical Belgian, with a yeasty sweetness and no hint of hops. The initial taste is refreshing, as there is nothing that really jumps out at you. As it goes down a slight yeast consistency starts to develop, and a bit of sweetness like honey as well. A hint of pepper and coriander toward the end. This beer finishes with a refreshing and near neutral taste, but it leaves behind a syrup-like film on the tongue."
"Cloudy, tawny colour with a thin cap of beige foam. The head reduced quickly to a ring, but stuck around for quite a while after that. Some lacing. Fruity aroma of apples and apple peels, some caramel, with a spiciness that was close to cinnamon. Flavour was fruity, with apple up front, caramel and mild spice, some pear along with light acidity, and earthy towards the end. The finish had a pleasant warmth. Lowish carbonation with a medium body and a bit of slickness. Very enjoyable overall. There's some complexity here, but it didn't detract from the drinkability at all."
"Overall- A decent warm weather option. A little pricey but wouldn't turn 1 down."
"A solid Belgian ale in every regard, very good drinkability. The ABV is hidden, and didn't prevent me from finishing the entire 750 easily myself. You will be hard pressed to find a better beer in this style for the price. If you have access to this, snag it."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle. Appears a cloudy golden color. Head is quite large and fluffy initially but dies down to a thin trace after a few minutes. The aroma is very sweet and fruity. Hints of berries and banana are present. The taste is slightly tart and spicy but then finishes with a sweet alcohol flavor. Very carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, a very tasty beer, well above average."
"Overall: Served cool, not cold, this one is a flavorful warm-weather quencher. Definitely recommended."
"with a refreshing sail"
"D- could have quite a few of these even though its 8% ABV, a great beer"
"very nice drinkability, refreshing despite the 8% abv. something i'll pick up again if i see it."
"A good beer overall, but not Caracole's best. It's well worth the $7 I paid for the corked and caged bottle, but don't expect a huge wow factor. Expect a well made beer, that I think needs a bit more hops to be right. A little remaining head or lace wouldn't hurt much either...."
"A very nice Belgian Blond."
"I like the shout-out to the saxophone and even if the notes aren't in perfect harmony, it's another serviceable beer from Caracole."
"Bottled beer at Biergarden, Portsmouth. Brought out in a tulip. Hazy yellow with a well-laced head. The nose is light and yeasty. Flavor-wise, this is lemon-citrusy, flowery, with a bready yeastiness, almost like a strong, alcohol-laced witbier. Excellent. (#2693, 2/10/2007)"
"Finishes remarkably clean born about a soft carpet of crisp carbonation. Alcohol is scarcely noted save for its dizzying effects. Exceptionally quaffable except for the high ABV; would go very well with many, many foods. Lightly acidic, dry, crisp and subtly complex. Nice."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color with a large head and excellent lacing. The smell is sour with some spice notes. The taste is sour and spicy. It has sweet undertones. The mouthfeel is light and bright with carbonation. This is a delicious beer overall and has a lot of character, but is smooth enough to be quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Okay, but not quite ""good"" - glad I split the bottle. La Fin or Duvel win out any day."
"Drinkability: Very crisp and refreshing, with a nice dry finish."
"D: For what it is, a straightforward spicy Belgian pale ale, this is a really good one. We definitely will enjoy this again and again. Just having one takes me back to the dusty, stone-walled tasting room at the back of the brewery. Recommended."
"Poured out a clear dark gold color crowned by a chunky white head and lacing everywhere. The nose is bit malty and a bit grainy at the same time, rounded out by clove. The taste starts bready malt, a light sweetness. It then goes towards a decent amount of hop bitterness, but never develops the usual Belgian flavors I'm looking for. Mouthfeel was a bit flat, accentuating how poorly the flavors have married. Definitly drinkable, but too ordinary for me to care about."
"33 cL slender Belgian bottle with ""Lot G"" and ""06/08"" notched on the back lablel, served a bit too cold at Michael's Bistro and Taphouse with a small snifter. It pours a clouded peach with a 2 finger, off-white head that would leave nice lacing if I weren't swirling so much to catch the aroma. It is quite tropical, with lemon zest, apple, pear, melon, oranges, peaches, and pineapple, along with light pepper and some spicy yeast. The flavor is similar, fruity, but not quite as robust as the aroma, along with notes of curacao and perhaps coriander on top of a medium body that is very refreshing for a beer of its strength. Overall a very nice golden ale, and one I would definitely drink again."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin white head,little retention or lacing. Smell is sweet,yeasty and spicy, with a good bit fruit. Body is silky,light to medium,and carbonated. Taste is fruited, and spiced. Smooth, yet a bit of an edge in the finish. Alchol is present through out. Good stuff!!"
"Another hit from Caracole (RIP in TX)."
"D - I enjoyed this beer, the alcohol does not stand out in smell or taste. I can tell it is there after taking a drink and now that I have finished one on an empty stomach. This is my favorite belgian strong so far. Maybe, the artesian water gives this beer the little extra kick it has."
"M: good amount of carbonation, very smooth."
"Overall a good beer, good for the style, but not one for me personally to go out of my way for. Probably a good summer beer."
"It's a nice beer that went well with a summer day. The dry finish was very thirst quenching. I like this beer and I would get it again easily."
"Drinkability - this is very good, and it goes down really well. I should admonish against more than one 750 ml per session due to abv, and hence lowering drinkability points, but I don't think I can, so ... get another one, but only if you're not driving."
"Large 750 ml bottle...very hazy slightly brownish bright ochre color, large white head with ripples across the top. Laces don't stick much, mostly residual sticking spots. Slighty funky aroma with some nice fresh fruit notes, some blueberry and grape. Mouthfeel approaches medium, carbonation is high and lightens things up a bit. Flavor is bright and new, not laden with much in terms of yeastiness -- much more expressive in terms of of wild honey and the sweetness of pears and cantelopes to start things off. A little bit of hazelnut and raisin creeps in, slight reminders of cough drops. Alcohol decently hidden, this beer is fairly straightforward but works well for me."
"I'd recommend this to anyone, go out and try it. I think it's the best so far from this brewery."
"A very drinkable ale. Especially in warm weather."
"I hauled this back from KC. In the Chimay Goblet. Pours a beautiful blonde color with a one-finger head that hangs around and dissipates slowly. Lots of carbonation. The aroma gives a combination of citrus and earthy hops. The first taste on the palate is sweet with the hop bitterness coming and going. Complex, yet it tastes a little like a Saison. This blonde is awesome and would be great as an after-dinner drink. the alcohol is present but mild as it mingles with the sweetness and the herbal spicyness of the hops. A swirl of the glass actually rejuvenates the aroma. A good froth on the palate releases a good sour taste that adds to the sweetness and the well-rounded hops. This was very drinkable and I am starting to appreciate Belgians more and more. Cheers, Joe"
"Light gold/yellow in color. Head is 1/2 inch, white and fluffy. Light haze, loads of bubbles. Aroma of semi-sweet banana, citrus, and clove reach the nose, with also a touch of a cinnamon-like spice. Taste has a wheaty, fruit-like sweetness, with citrus and sour apple notes. The malt flavor gives of a hint of bready caramel. Spiciness is subtle. I detect a bit of a vegetable-like flavor, hard to discern, but its not desirable. Mouthfeel is light to medium, decent carbonation, but not a creamy/ rich as it could be. It was still easily drinkable and a nice all-around Belgian offering..."
"Opinion: This is a really mild yet drinkable beer. I personally think that it is a bit heavy on the palate, and that it should be more attenuated and dry. I like the malt balance in this beer, but it is a bit different than your traditional hop accentuated crisp Blond. It is an OK beer, and I wouldnÂ’t mind drinking another single, but I wonÂ’t be buying another 4-pack really soon."
"Pours an exploding bottle into my chalice. Light, cloudy copper color with abundant head that lingers very shortly. Very estery, fruity and floral aroma followed by a wave of sweetness and alcohol. Flavors are very candy like, also a lot of fruit in this one, raisins and peaches. Wow, a lot of raisin and currant flavor in this one. Alcohol is not detected besides the warming, very nice. It is a little too sweet for me, nearly cloying, but certainly drinkable. Bottle proclaims ""best by 12/06", who says? This one could take some age on it for sure. I wish it had a bit more body to it, its about there and gone, a little too subtle for me."
"It's been about three years since I last had a Saxo, which is too long. I plan to stock this regularly from now on."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very good, easy drinking Belgian Pale, but a little rough around the edges. Definitly enjoyable, and one I'd love to have again."
"Overall, i do enjoy this beer, but i dont think its all that complex. There are better in its style, but is still good. A bit light and refreshing. I think i would really enjoy this with a meal."
"This is a beautiful golden beer with an ample, white head that lasted for quite some time and left nice lacing. The smell is of citrus, wheat, honey, and hops, and the taste is much the same. It's a bit more subtle on the pallate, though, with apricot and lemon flavors throughout. Try this beer!"
"light body with a stinging carbonation. sharp honey sweetness with a belgian yeast backing. a hint of spice and tartness, but relatively straightforward. definitely drinkable, but not begging for another taste."
"750 ml corked bottle. Saxo pours out a slightly hazy golden color with a big, white head. The aroma is very fruity, with lemon, pears, and bananas, as well as spicy cloves. The flavor starts off as grain and turns to dough. A little bit of chocolate, which is weird. The flavor then turns fruity, with pears, lemon, and mango. Pepper and clove spice. Finishes hoppy. Alcohol seems high. High carbonation. Pretty good Belgian pale ale, but not quite at the highest level for the style."
"A very enjoyable beer to drink, one of the best belgian pale ales I've had in a while. The 8% was hidden well and I wished it was a 750 instead of a 330. I was a bit surprised by this one because it has very mixed scores. Saxo is on the top of my list."
"Drinkability- Not bad, but can think of several other pales to buy instead of this one."
"The body is surprisingly between light and moderate. Light alcohol notes but rather clean considering the ABV. Overall, weird to see the hops come out and off yeast, but still pretty drinkable."
"The mouth is just a hair on the light side, for the style. The carbonation is enough to wipe the palate clean without being too fizzy. Interesting enough to be drinkable. A meat and cheese plate would go nicely with this one."
"Drinkability is OK to good, a bit peppery but mellows quickly, touches on some soapy slurry stuff, and is seemingly simple with some complexity to it. Perhaps passable, but worth checking out if on sale as this bottle was."
"Poured a hazy, pale orange from the 11.2oz bottle with a frothy head. Fruity and floral aroma. Sweet yet tart. Citrus, spice and yeast flavours with a crisp dry finish. The higher alcohol level is not really detectable. Definitely a great drinkable beer, but rather expensive to buy in the bar."
"Beer is good. Happy Belgian beering."
"Altogether, there is a terrific drinkability here- combined with a sweet high end twang, it makes this a 750ml that you will not want to share."
"Pours a rather bright hazy yellow colour with what seems to be a semi- permanent rocky white head. As the head finally falters one is left with almost iceberg looking outcrops on top of the beer. Smell is a little sweet with notes of lemon peel, some spice (nutmeg, mace). Taste echo's the aroma. Definite lemony citrus and a honeyish sweetness. However there is enough spice, and sublte hops to keep this from being too one sided. Also some wheaty bread notes. Very interesting. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation to keep the mouth from becoming disinterested. Drinkability is good as well. Not something I would drink all night, but something I would want to have on hand for when the mood strikes. And as tasty as this was it might strike often."
"Fantastic in every facet."
"Well, this drink to me is only worth trying if you are into real experimentation, or if somebody hands you a glass/bottle for free. I'd drink it, but I wouldn't pay for it."
"super tasty brew, i wasn't really expecting to enjoy it so much as i'm not the biggest fan of this style, but, this one surprised me. that snail is way cool."
"This one pours a cloudy yellow color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus/lemon as well as a lot of spices. Very nice. The flavor is exactly like the nose - lots of spices and lemony goodness. Very tasty. Moderated mouthfeel and drinkability is great."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this one. It pours a cloudy straw color with a nice billowing head over top that falls to about 2 fingers. The nose is divine, with a lot of lemony and a nice peppery spiceyness. Wow. I could sit and smell it all night. The flavor is spot on to the nose, with a really nice lemoney sweetness and a beautiful peppery spice. Everything is well blended and very nice. The feel is moderate to thick, with a moderate carbonation. This brew goes down without a problem. The 8% is nowhere to be found. It is not filling or heavy at all. Damn. Great brew."
"Pours a nice straw color with some light orange hue with a big fluffy white head that settles leaving sheets of lace behind,big citrus aromas some lemon and very ripe pineapple.Nice mix of spice, coriander and clove with some ripe citrus with a little smoke that lingers late.Pretty darn drinkable for the alc 8%,a nice offering liked it better than the Troublette."
"Man, I'd love to drink another one, and It's on the queue list for the next travels abroad."
"All in all, a very satisfying golden ale...one to luxuriate in while drinking in the complex and glorious beauty in a Ben Webster solo."
"I enjoyed Caracole's Amberee so I thought that I'd give this one a shot. Pours a beautiful golden hue with a medium sized white head. Aroma has a nice kick of spice to settle on top of an apple like fruitiness. Both of the Caracole beers that I've had to date have a really interesting earthiness to them. Quite a lot of spice on top of the earthiness. Fruitiness becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Great drinkability. Excellent value to boot. I will definitely be seeing more of this in my future."
"I'm not sure that Saxo is the equal of Brasserie Caracole Ambree, but it's still an enjoyable brew and is a more than respectable example of the style. BSPAs will never be everyday beers for me, but this one was quite good while it lasted."
"All in all, this was a masterful pairing with the roast chicken. I will be keeping more of this in my house in the future."
"This beer is quite tasty, and is really well balanced between the various beery components. Each of the 4 beers that I have tried from this brewery have been great, I highly recommend any brew from these guys. This is one of the best golden ales that I have ever had."
"Best before f-9-06 so well in time to enjoy this one fresh and fruity. Pours out into the glas fine but not too much head and carbonation. Pale yellow colour for a 8% beer but nice. Smell is alcoholic, hoppy and most fruity. Smell somtimes is a litle solvent like and probably quiet some koreander being used. Taste is very dry, flowery and litle malty. Ends dry and is litle bitter, but how to tell that if you first had Christoffel."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light pale malt scent with a fruity/tart Belgian yeast aroma. It seems a bit dry. The taste is good. It has a dry, pale malt flavor with a fruity yeast finish. It is simple, but well done. It goes down smooth and has a slightly tart aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good Belgian Blonde. It has excellent aroma and taste; a good drinker."
"A fresh tasting pale. 8% is a surprise. Very good yeast aroma and honey yeast in taste. Creamy lemon, bit grass, spicy vanilla, moderately aggressive carbonation concommitant with being well hopped. Mid sip mint, abundant good malts for balance. Goes down smooth."
"Hazy orange-yellow color with a creamy white head. It leave some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is yeasty, herbal and lemony, with a pepper and wheat smell as well. The flavor is candi sugars and wheat, along with a tangy citrus flavor. It is also a bit spicy and peppery in the finish. It is very light in body and refreshing for its alcohol content. A really tasty interest beer."
"Taste: Lightly sweet, almost hints of banana, honey, mild maltyness. Mouthfeel was okay, I'd say light to mid range. Not bad altogether."
"A good, fairly strong Belgian. Alcohol content is fairly strong, but well hidden. Flavor is fruity and sweet, but the finish is fairly dry. Lemony flavor and bitterness with a peppery bite are evident at cooler temps, but fade as the beer warms. The bottle notes that it should be served at 46 degrees and much warmer flavors seem to fade. Strong carbonation lends a crisp mouthfeel and brings out the fruity aroma, but as the carbonation fades things go south. Murky amber color with quite a bit of yeast and sediment near the end."
"Sweet, astringent and fruity with notes of apples, pine, orange and honey. Quite hoppy. Dry, alcoholic and quite yeasty. Somewhat offensive but in a good way."
"GAB"
"Pours a nice cloudy golden color with a nice white head. Aroma is citrus mostly lemon along with yeasty bread with fints of spice. Taste light and refreshing citrus almost a light tangerine like flavor dances along the tounge with the light bubbles of carbonation.It is followed by a nice light malt flavor with yeasty flavors mingled with spice and light alcohol presence that makes for a tasty brew. Mouthfeel is just right light side of medium. Drinkability is good hard to believe this is 8% so smooth and refreshing a very nice Strong Pale Ale one I will be purchasing again."
"Drinkability/notes: A wonderful example of the style, well worth the effort to find."
"Not really my style, but not bad. Poured a hazy, cloudy orange/peachy colour. Monster white head. Nice lacing of the glass. The smell is quite strong of yeast and a musty ""basement-like"" smell. The taste is a bit bitter with some breadiness and a tiny bit of spice. Highly carbonated. The fact that this is 8.0%abv is cleaverly disguised. Tastes like it should be about 5.0% or something. I'm a much bigger fan of porters and stouts, so like I said, this isn't really my style at all. Not bad though, it's pretty good."
"Lacks complexity, and too bitter and dry for my palate. Alcohol is hidden well, but this is just an average, strong pale ale."
"Overall Impression: A little harsh, but a nice representative of the style. Another solid beer from Brasserie la Caracole."
"I would say that Saxo is this brewery's basic ale. I say this because this ale is very basic and solid. Nothing crazy, and no surprises, basically what you would expect when you hear Belgian Strong pale Ale. It pours a frothy white head. The color is golden yellow and hazy. The smells of orange, lemon and yeast are present. The taste is different than the smell would indicate. The taste is earthy, musty, and spicy. Not much fruit taste. The mouth feel is crisp, clean and satisfying. There is a hint of the 8% ABV in the middle. Overall a solid representation of a not so fruity Belgian strong pale ale."
"The beer came in a 330 ml brown longneck bottle that had a nice art deco label. The serving temperature of 46Ëš F on the back label is too low in my opinion. I drank mine at 65 Ëš F to bring out more flavor nuances. The body was slightly hazy golden pale with a medium but constant carbonation. The head was rich and rocky and left a good deal of lace. Aroma was sharp and yeasty with some floral tones. The taste was well attenuated, lemony tart, and quite dry, with a lot of Belgian farmhouse funk. There was also a peppery pungency to the aftertaste. The alcohol was very well hidden and would never have been guessed to be as high as it was (8% ABV). This was one of the first arrivals on July 1st in Georgia, and I picked it up that day. Ironically now we have such abundance of selection here, I am finally getting around to it. Good things come to those who wait I guess."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that stays, leaving sme lace. Moderate carbonation. Medium bodied. Cloudy pale, amber color, nose is raisiny. Malty but taste is raisiny. Finish is mellow but as it warms flavors are more intense. $3.50 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Medium on the palate, lots of body, finishes clean with little aftertaste. Absolutely no trace of alcohol flavors in the mix, extremely drinkable. Your palate comes out well-scrubbed by this brew. I like BeerAngel's ""Belgian IPA"" descriptor for this one."
"This is a unique good tasting beer."
"This is a solid, classy brew that I could see myself buying again. The finish is a little wierd, but all in all, this was a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a brilliantly clear golden color with a massive head and also has a large swarm of bubbles racing to the top as if I'd dropped an alka-seltzer in the bottom of it. The smell of spicey fruit, yeast, malt, and alcohol make up the aroma. The taste has a sharp carb/hop bite off the starting line resembling sticking your tongue to a 9-volt battery and slowly tapers off into a light fruit and spice with yeast and alcohol in the background. It is over-carbonated in my opinion as it creates an almost IPA/Belgian version of a style beer. I believe the flavor would benefit from less carbonation in a big way. It is a medium bodied beer that finishes slightly sweet. I'm a little disappointed in this one. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Poured a clear gold with a nice fizzy head. Smelled very nice. Fruitiness abundant. Tastes the same with some spices mixing well with the hops. I had this with dinner and finished the rest with a buddy. A good Belgian pale ale."
"Cork dated 06/2001bottling. Initially pours a perfect pilsener color, but through stages of decanting the entire bottle, it becomes a hazy orangy gold colored brew. Smell is rather Duvelish, light musty and citrusy hop notes that comes across with a clean effervescence that shines in the aroma. Tastes smooth and sweet, with a finish consistent with a Belgian blond, slightly on the drier side. Drinkability is very good."
"A big, white foamy, smooth head caps the pale, gold, slightly hazy body. Plenty of sediment. The smell is somewhat sour... some apples, some barbershop. The front is spicy/sour, leading through a tingly, fizzy middle to a dry, bitter, peppery finish. Alcohol is present. This has a little more flavor than the Troublette, but I still find it just a bit one-dimensional."
"Boy Howdy! This sweet and yeasty blond certainly did me in for the night tonight at least. Good Night! Yow!"
"The appearance is hazy and pale golden. The aroma is spice up front, and sweet fruit in the background. Also present in the aroma is lemon. The taste is sweet yet hinted with spice and then the finish is dry. The mouthfeel is big enough to mask the 8% ABV. In fact the alcohol is very understated making this a beer with very good drinkability."
"Pours a deep hazy golden color with a magnificent billowing white head that very slowly gives way to a thick and creamy lace. Nose is sweet fruit and fragrant lemon zest with some milder notes of yeast and peppery spice. Moderate in body with a lively and spritzy mouthfeel. Taste begins fruity with a good amount of spice (mostly coriander) followed by a somewhat earthy woodiness. Next comes a bit of grainy yeasts and a good deal of lemon tartness and crispness leading towards a bite of white pepper and a dry finish. A very fine Belgian ale to be had here and dangerously drinkable despite the 8% ABV."
"After a while, when the beer is more warm, the smell is less good: it becomes more heavy..."
"This is a pleasant strong pale ale. Perhaps not my favorite, and perhaps not my favorite Caracole, but a respectable beer that I would certainly have again."
"Spice and pale malt with forward sweetness. Actually the sweetness is a little much for me and gets in the way of the drink ability. Grainy heaviness really complex, but at the same time balanced so the result is a medium bodied brew. Corriander flavors also a little heavy fo rme."
"I found this brew to have a fruity and a citrusy aroma to it which I like. It had a medium head on it. There was a lot of carbonation in this brew. In my opinion this brew had a bitter aftertaste to it. All in all this brew was drinkable. It was not a drain pour. Which is not to say that I would drink this particular brew anytime soon though."
"Cork dated 06-2002. This brew pours a medium white head of all sized bubbles that leave a fair lacing. It has a fruity citrusy aroma and a cloudy dark yellow color to its body with carbonation rising up the side of the glass. It has a fizzy fruity citrusy taste. It is very smooth with only a slight bitterness in its aftertaste. All in all a decent brew."
"Final thoughts? This is a nice interesting ale. I really enjoy the estery flavours, especially when they're not overpowering -- and here they definitely weren't. If I were to suggest an improvement perhaps the slightest touch of sweetness (so you'd hardly notice it) would make it feel even fuller. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again."
"This highly carbonated blond ale pours a clear golden color with a quarter inch head that lasted the entire time it took me to drink. The citrusy aroma was exceptonal and the citrus notes came through in the taste as well. The high alcohol also came through in the taste. The carbonation made this a very drinkable and refreshing beer, but with the high alcohol content I'd say this is pretty dangerous. I could see myself drinking several of these before the alcohol hits me."
"Mostly clear, gold in color with a moderate sized head. The aroma is rather tart, with hints of banana and green apple. Flavor is very smooth, and wonderfully balanced. Wheaty with hints of lemon, mildly spicy throughout, and finished with a gentle touch of herbal hops. Very flavorful for a blond. Body is fairly creamy and a bit viscous in the swallow. A really nice, very drinkable beer. Can't believe the ABV is as high as it is!"
"A very drinkable blonde, hut at 8% you need to be careful. I like it cooled in the fridge. A definate addition to my inventory."
"Mouthfeel: light-bodied, crisp carbonation, some acidity, very refreshing, and very drinkable (the 7.2% abv is hard to detect)"
"beer pick it up as it was a great winter warmer after a day of sking."
"Pours a dark yellow color with a very impressive head, which did die down a bit. Smell was spicy, grassy, very pleasant. A very full-bodied beer to drink, I really enjoyed that. Not watery at all. Very smooth. The taste is not overwhelming, or screaming out this flavor or that flavor. I would recommend this for someone who wants to drink a smooth, full-bodied beer that is amazing light tasting at the same time. Definitely would drink again, no question."
"Drinkability: I'm not exactly sure of where to catagorize this brew, perhaps a laid-back Wit that is a little soured. At any rate, I did enjoy it and could see myself buying it again. Not on a regular basis, but now and then when the mood hits..."
"Very drinkable beer. Perhaps a bit too smooth, considering the abv. This could get me into a lot of trouble..."
"This beer poured a golden yellow color and formed a light airy white head that subsided quickly and left a little circular lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of floral hops, lemon and grain/yeast. A flavor of hops, cirtrus and wheat. The finish was light for this style and remined more of a wit/wheat style. A good beer, even if not really a good representative of it's style."
"The pour an indistinct golden yellow with a bright white head that is modest in size, creamy in its texture and the lace nice fine sheets to seal off the glass. Citrus crisp and fresh nose, lemon like, malt and tart to the senses, front begins sweet. Top is slender in feel, finish has a biting acidity and the hops spicy with the aftertaste dry, citrus tart and long lasting, quite a nice drinking beer and well worth the sample."
"Hop lemon nose.  Hazy ""white beer"" wheat look.  Original taste of lemon and wheat with a smooth mouth.  Lasting white head and lace.  Slight alcohol finish.  Very smooth blonde.  A big wheat base is apparent which pumps the ABV.  This beer is a Hoegarden on steroids!"
"I really like this beer from its yellowish orange appearance with white head that lasted to the last swig. Great hop taste with a nice lemon like aroma. Light in body with a lot of carbonation. Certainly worth a try."
"Turbid golden hue, topped by a moderate head that leaves... Belgian lace. Lemony, wheaty, and fruity aroma w/ mild phenol & a hint of peppery alcohol.  A touch tame in aroma.  Tart fruit & black pepper upfront, follwed by shandy - like flavors & mild hop bitterness.  Light in body, quite dry and well (perhaps overly so) attenuated.  Residual malt sweetness is minimal.  Finishes a bit tart, clean, and perhaps a bit bland.  Flavorwise, this is perhaps the most understated Belgian Strong I've had.  Perhaps my bottle (12 oz.) was old or the 750 ml bottles are better.  Highly drinkable, however."
"Notes: Richly complex drawing on the grain flavours, hop character and by products of the yeast to push the envelope in brings full and bold flavours. Not as clean as other strong pales and more on the raw side."
