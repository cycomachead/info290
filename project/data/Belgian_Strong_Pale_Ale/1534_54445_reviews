"I am drinking a canned version and upon popping the tab, faint bitter hops support large pitted fruit on the nose. It pours hazy gold under a very pillowy head that persists and leaves thick lace all the way down. The palate starts with fruit balancing a line between peach and apricot with citrus, very faint grapefruit, orange, bread and light grains in the background and traces of caramel. The bitter on the finish suggests earthy grapefruit rind. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium high. While the beer is very creamy, the canned version tastes artificially carbonated opposed the the natural carbonation in the bomber bottles and the dcanned versions carbonation feels a little harsher – not as smooth as the bottle conditioned variety."

"Beautiful color, with great creamy head. Smooth and tasty with great estery and classic belgian flavor."

"Pours a hazy gold with thick fluffy white head, big spray of lace on the glass, sheet for the first couple of inches. Smell: banana pudding, coriander, notes of pepper, dried pineapple, and grass. Taste: candied lemon peel, dried pineapple and banana, spicy on fair amount of pale malt sweet, then saltine with notes of banana, clove, pepper. Medium bodied, fine creamy carbonation, but finish is really dry and a bit metallic and chili pepper-ish, which was odd. From corked and caged 750 bottled 10/2013. Good but the finish leaves a lot to be desired."
"Love this style; light, dry, and sweet - a classic!  (C&C from Wegman's Collegeville)"

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/30/2012. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, clove, pepper, honey, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a nice crisp malt/yeast balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. There is a lightly astringent flavor note appearing after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian strong pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Smell like pineapple and cherries.Weak foam, short lasting, bit bitter and astringent. Apples and plums, strong sparkling and vanilla, later weaker,sweeter and easier to drink. Goes smoothly with fish and sweet. + strong, refreshing - too much fruits, similar to other belgian ales."
""
""

"Very enjoyable and smooth taste, without being as bitter as the name might suggest. That being said, I would have preferred a bit more spice in such a beer."

"O: I really enjoyed this beer for it's crispness and mildly interesting ending. I think it has a bit of Belgian taste to it without being too funky or banana-tasting (like some Belgians seem to me). Definitely something to sip on a nice spring/summer evening."

"lucifer is a wonderful example of the belgian strong golden or pale ale. it pours a hazy blonde color with an inch of patient white head that leaves heavy rings as it drinks. a nose of banana, much like a hefeweizen, but cleaner than that, without the spice. other fruit esters are present as well, and there is a light floral quality. the flavor is very similar, yeast driven. on tap i get quite a bit more hop than i do from the can, which may be slightly dated, but i almost prefer the mellow hop bitterness to a more robust experience. the carbonation is through the roof on this, which gives it refreshment value and also makes it seem much lighter than its 8% abv, which will trick you into an early and heavy buzz if you arent careful. love the cereal grain qualities, and the way the yeast becomes so summery as it finishes. under appreciated i think, this is a beer of very high quality that is widely available. a great illustration of this often butchered style. a true belgian classic."

"Overall: A very sweet, effervescent strong ale. I really enjoyed the nice oxidized fruit notes and the pleasant malty finish, but there was too much of the candi/bubblegum sweetness for my tastes. With that said, you can tell it’s of a higher abv but you certainly can’t detect any notes of alcohol, due in large part to the sweetness. Overall, it’s nothing to go out of your way for but enjoyable nonetheless."

"A big shout out to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of yeast, some mild fruits. Taste is fruity, spicy, malts, a touch of alcohol and just a bit of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"O: A decent Belgian Strong with spice and fruit."
""
"O - Very nice I have never actually tried this before although it is readily available in my market...call it normalcy I would definitely pick up several of these next time I am out. Very drinkable and honestly I am not sure why the suggested serving temperature is so low I am having it around 70° and i'ts just beautiful."

"O: Definitely a killer beer. Puts most beers, including belgians, to their knees. beautiful aroma of everything that begians stand for. Taste is huge with a prodigious amount flavor. Hops, sweet banana, and yeast. well worth the dollar to buy it. i approve this message"

"O- Pretty standard for a BSPA but enjoyable enough to get high marks."
""
""

"Refreshing, a nice light sipping beer but this is no Duvel."
""
""
"Carbonation level is good, maybe a bit to thick to be a real easy drinker. Just a very faint warmth. Thought this was very nice, would have again if looking for a Strong Belgian pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: BSPAs are not my favorite style, but Lucifer is a really solid example and one I would quite like to have again."
"Notes: Good trippel with a lot going on. However, not as good from the bottle as I recall having it on draft, which was amazing."
""
""
"An easy drinking beer, by no means the best or worst."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer that delivers complexity and a great super clean spiced profile. It's easy drinking for an 8% beer. I would recommend this and would drink it again for sure."
"Overall defiantly not worth 6 dollars a can but totally smooth and worth checking out just on the allure of the name. A very balanced Belgium pale ale."
""
""
""
"A solid Belgian Pale Ale, but too similar to the Gouden Carolus Tripel to make a lasting impression. That being said, I would buy this again. It fits the style and borrows most of Gouden's signature ingredients."

"The Crack had a nice snap to it and I once again employed the Inverted Glug to create more than two fingers of dense, foamy, bone-white head with great retention. ""Fruity aroma""?!? It smelled like somebody was chewing an entire pack of Juicyfruit gum! Color was a slightly-hazy sunshine-yellow. I leaned in for a better sniff and caught not only mixed fruit, but also a yeasty mustiness. Oh my! Mouthfeel was soft, caressing on the tongue with a very fruity flavor in the mouth. ""Delicate bitterness""? Too delicate to register on my palate, apparently, but I am not usually drinking this style for its associated IBUs. Finish was semi-dry with the yeast causing a dryness in my throat on the extreme finish. This is most impressive in a CAN and while I would not want a whole bunch, it would probably play pretty big among both initiates and those in the know if if I brought some in a cooler."
"O: A good BSPA overall. It's nice to see this beer in cans now as well. It doesn't have the depth or drinkability of its fellow demon-themed BSPA Duvel, but is still enjoyable."

"Pours a slightly murky yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O. I like this one! It ads a distinct belgian taste to the PBR that I would drink everyday. Not watery though. But still refreshing. The lite warmth of the 8% ABV cuddles me into bed and sings me a lullaby. Seriously...will buy again"

"Overall this is a decent fall back when available, however, this is nothing to really pursue."
""

"Taste is dominated by the strong yeast character. The yeast adds a strong fruity taste caused by the higher alcohols. There are flavors of bananas and peaches. The maltiness is low and most probably enriched by a large sugar addition, which makes the body of the beer low and increases drinkability. For an 8% ABV beer this beer drinks way too easy. A classic and nice example of the style. In my book at the same level as a Duvel."
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Good beer"
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good Strong Pale, but the mouthfeel is a little too syrupy and the flavor profile is a little too pedestrian."
"Bought a bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a white wine glass. The appearance was golden with a thin white head. The smell was a bit lacking for a quality Belgian beer, I thought, but I found traces of hops with a bit of grapefruit. The taste followed that, and I was a bit disappointed not to find too much laying deeper in the brew. Overall, this was a decent Belgian strong, but there are so many other better options when it comes to this esteemed category of beer."
""
""
"Pretty dang good overall. Very easy to drink, good on a hot summer day."
"Overall a very good Belgian Ale with a nice fruity citrus presence, that along with a good mix of yeast and alcohol helped make sure that no one flavor was so overpowering that it overshadowed any other. This brew was very tasty and rather refreshing for a beer that has such a high ABV…"
"Have a thirsty towel handy, because this one pops and fizzes like champagne! It pours a pretty, slightly hazy solar yellow with a thick, frothy white head. Strong, yeasty aroma has hints of pear and butterscotch. Flavor has a nice malty core with subtle fruity and butterscotch notes, a hint of hops, and a firm but not fierce alcohol bite. Texture has good body and plenty of sassy fizz. Devilish!"

"A solid strong blonde from the folks that brought us Gouden Carolus. I imagine that a bottle without the defects would rate higher, though it has a lot of work to do if it wants to meet its stablemates. At least the label is really cool."
""
""
"O: This is a beer that you want to use a tulip glass for to capture its massive head. It’s quite drinkable for the style and the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Pours a hazy yellow color topped with a thin head. Aroma is very 'yeasty,' with pineapple, lemon, tangerine, and flower petal notes throughout. Flavor is a pleasantly sweet and subtle. Bubblegum or candy comes to mind. Alcohol presence is hidden well. Classic Belgian Pale. Good, but not on the level of many others that are readily available."

"En general una buena Belgian Strong Ale."

"D - Overall this is a good beer with a good taste that makes it easy to drink"
""
"O- pretty good. This disappeared rather quickly. I appreciate any Belgian I can quaff. Some of the flavors do seem a bit artificial for a true Belgian, but it does have a lot of raw flavors too. It's definitely worth a try"
"Notes: Riva to Het Hanker… Maybe actually there is a slight jump in quality. I did like the preceding Lucifer but his one is a touch lighter, and maybe a bit more lemony, which sorta feels better on this occasion for my palate. Now, under the offer that finally made me give it a go in this new inaction this one is well worth picking up and sharing socially, but the regular overblown pricing I see for this one in some establishment of the area is way off, and makes one wonder if they simply play with the novelty that it may be for some to get a brew with this branding…"
""
""
"Stay away from this! Not horrible, just not good. Bland, boring and disappointing. I hope this is a bad batch, I'm not spending anymore time on this."
"Although a solid beer, this came across as a tripel that was lacking in some way. I've had St. Feuillien triple that served up a better banana and citrus ester flavor/aroma. Piraat loves the alcohol burn. St. Bernardus is the uber balanced tripel. This lies somewhere in the middle. I love the mouthfeel, though. I guess I'm a little torn, but ultimately this is a beer that is lacking in some way compared to other awesome Belgians. Good, but not to die for."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Its a good brew for sitting around drinking. This really strikes me as a more craft like blue moon. Its stronger for sure, but the taste is there. I'm not knocking it as I think this is something my wife would like and be okay with. I'd rather have a darker ale if I were going to pick something though."
""
""
"Poured a very cloudy straw gold with quick dying two finger head that left minimal lace patches on top of an aroma that mixed some sour funkiness and yeast along with citric notes (lemon, orange peel) and spices like clove and pepper. A light body that is easy to drink and smooth yet retains a crispness thanks to lively carbonation and some spicy notes on the backend. Some sugary goodness balances out citric tartness so the beer is neither too tart or sweet. Also, picked up touches of other light fruit like pear or white grape skin that give off a sweet fruit taste and a sour note or two as well. This is an easy to drink and flavorful ale and I'm glad its back."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid Belgian strong pale ale, but do not expect it to bring anything new or exciting to the table."
"Pours straw-yellow in color, hazy, almost creamy in appearance, forms a crafted, tightly bubbled head. Notes of freshly baked bread, lemon and ripe banana float from the glass. The tastes follow suit as a combination of pastries and lemon pepper coats the palate. Chewy but carbonated, the brew delivers a satisfying complexion without weighing down the palate. Eminently drinkable, could work as a session brew if it wasn't for the sneaky 8% ABV."
"O- Not the best BSPA I've had, but its nice nonetheless. I really enjoyed this. In the future, I might seek others first. But I will revisit."
"Another solid beer from Het Anker, very drinkable as the alcohol isn't too apparent, and great mix of malts and hops"
"Overall, a very refreshing golden ale."
"Pours a hazy, gold color. Two inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of pale malt, hint of citrus hops, hint of spice, and a hint of dough. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of citrus hops, slight spice, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good blend, appearance, aroma, and body."
"Pours mid-pale gold with a tight, quick head. A little sharp up front, and the flavor profile is solidly in the Belgian Strong Pale Ale tradition. Alcohol is a bit prominent, seeming even bigger than the 8% listed here. Teetered on the edge of harsh, but managed to pull back enough to be drinkable. Still just a touch hot, though."
"M: sweetness and bitterness are well balanced the ending is good a little dry but with good lasting mostly bitter and complex."
"O: A nice beer. Tastes good. Will drink again. Recommend."
"O: I was apprehensive, as a lover of Gouden Carolus, that this beer would let me down, but I am not disappointed. A superlative Belgian Strong Pale Ale -- one of the finest -- and highly recommended. Will drink again."
"This beer poured out surprisingly clear looking. I thought for sure there would be some haze to this one. The color of the beer was a bright yellow, the head was big and fluffy white. The lacing was scattered and soapy looking. The smell of the beer had a nice floral quality to it along with some Belgian yeast in there too. The taste of the beer got better as it warmed up. The flavors of some light hops and floral spice come in strong here. The mouthfeel was light and bubbly. Overall I like this beer, found it to be pretty enjoyable."
"The flavor is predictable based on the smell. I note some additional alcohol warmth. The body is rich even if the beer is relatively dry. Quite carbonated."
"O- Nice example of the stye, but you can find better. Still... worth checking out if you haven't had it before."
"This brew pours clean and golden yellow. hints of fruit with a dry bitter taste that is clean and long lasting not harsh. This brew has an 8% abv that drinks like a 5%. Very deceiving brew from the abv stand point. I enjoyed it most definitely will grab another when the chance presents itself."
"D - Overall this is a great belgian pale to enjoy"
"D Very good beer, abv is deceptively high, easy drinking. 4  "
"Overall - would be a WONDERFUL beer for hookah smoking. Very interesting in taste!"
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would like to have another one."
"Quite nice; fruity, but a solid gateway Belgian for someone more used to American beers."
"Recommended if available."
"The finish is smooth and again, lightly effervescent. It leaves a clean sweetness on my tongue and totally quenched my cheeks. Good stuff Het Anker!"
"Stephen Rich's bottle. An enormous white foamy head on golden body. Fresh yeasty aroma. Smooth mouthfeel, and good drinkability, creamy even. Good hops,a little saison like spice, this is a winner for pale Belgian style. Het Anker does this one good."
"Pours a pale golden colour, thick white head, slight lace on the glass. Smells of yeast, hops, malt, slightly fruity, green apple, vibrant and lively smelling. Taste is of citrus fuit, malt, slight hop presence, green apple, green fruit and a slight white grape tannic property. Nice lush mouthfeel, good use of carbonation and nice weight overall. Drinks very well, smooth and a great example of the style. Solid brew and would certainly have again,"
"Verdict: Short of World Class, but good beer. A tad too alcohol tasting to be a sessionable beer, but worth trying."
"The flavor is as the nose suggests, and to be honest, I'd swear this beer was a little bit more on the aggressive side before... alas, this is fairly smooth and easy drinking, and the alcohol never shows. It's delicately fruity (apples, pear), and sweetish without becoming candyish, honeyish, or cloying. There's some malty graininess to it, and there's just enough hop character and yeasty spice threaded through to give it some guts. It's well rounded, well balanced, and clean with just enough character to keep you coming back for more."
"Pours clear gold with a XXL head, no cloudiness if you pull back on the pour. Smells yeasty and musty with some malt aroma. Flavor is very nice, full bitter with no piney bite and a slight sweetness that is barely noticeable. Very carbonated feel, but remarkably quick to drink. Not as impressive as it's devil brother Duvel (doo-vel), but similar in it's strength and flavor in many ways. A good beer that is worth the try."
"This beer is phenomenal-my only complaint is that the alcohols stick out in the flavor a bit, especially as it warms. That said, it is so dry and crisp, you could certainly drink a ton of this-at least enough of this to knock you on your ass."
"not super impressive but still good nonetheless."
"El alcohol se siente de inmediato combinando el sabor cítrico ligero y dando un muy Firme sabor."
"I picked this up at my local Total Wine.. With an ABV of 8% and having such an evil name, I thought I was in for something amazing. Good is more how I would describe it. Very weak for a Belgian, with minimal aroma, average yellow color, minimal head. The best thing about this beer is the lack of a strong aftertaste that most strong Belgians have."
"Seven and a half years ago, a beer under this name got a thumbs down from me, as produced by Riva. Since Het Anker has been brewing it, I can't find a flaw. Though I don't normally prefer blondes, this is one I'll reach for now and then."
"This beer is a nice Strong Belgian Pale Ale and like most beers in this style is very easy to drink."
"Drinkable enough, but not terribly exciting, especially for the style. Not a huge Belgian brew, but quite pleasant, and easy to drink."
"A perfectly serviceable Belgian PA. It has the color of a tripel, which I've always found to be unappealing, with a thin but attractive white head. Enough yeast in the aroma to remind you that it's a Belgian beer. The taste was somewhat light and sugary, with a touch of fruity Kool-Aid up front and zero bitterness at the back end. It gained some density as it warmed; still, it was lacking character. Worth a glass but nothing more."
"D: Not quite interesting enough to be a frequent drinker, but would not pass it up if offered again."
"This is quite enjoyable and it drinks like a big, lower alcohol brew, by which I mean at 8% it is dangerously drinkable."
"A mellow yet tasty Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Fairly fruity, and hard to believe it is really 8% ABV. Nothing too special, but nice and worth trying if you can."
"D - Pretty good drinkability, I had no problem putting the 750 away by myself. It is a bit heaving and filling. Probably best with a friend."
"D - Clean, fizzy and refreshing. Very good and worthy of another glass (or two)."
"jd"
"Lucifer seems to be an overly aggressive and ill-balanced beer that has a lot of comming together to do."
"Overall, a deceptive and easy drinking ale with more of a hop display than I had expected. Very good, however not world class, such as its counterpart Duvel."
"The server at a local pub said Lucifer had just been tapped and recommended that I give it a try. The ale was served in a neat looking squatty stem class. It was a golden yellow, cloudy with over an inch of foam on the top and a nice bit of effervescence. The smell was fruity, a characteristic banana yeast aroma with no obvious hint of hops. It had a big banana flavor - not surprising for this style - with a light note of hop spice in the background. Very much a malt taste. Dry finish. So enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Quite nice."
"pours a perfect beautiful slightly hazy peach color with a 2 finger head that slowly recedes..smell is great also it starts with belgian yeast then apples,pears and bananas a little clove and some sweet bread in the background mmm!!..taste is superb its crisp and pure with belgian yeast lots of fresh fruits a little pepper some clove and sweet baked bread it is perfectly balanced..a treat.. mouth feel is super fresh not overpowering just full of belgian goodness..imo this is a superb bspa.that drinks like a golden..you dont notice the 8% abv..try this one"
"Drinkability: A very nice example of the Belgian Blonde style, with a lightness of touch but plenty of flavor"
"carbonation. Eh."
"When I sat down at the table and began taking notes, I made a conscious note to myself: ""Don't compare this beer to Duvel, just take it as its own thing."" It turns out that comparing this atrocity to Duvel is laughable. Maybe it needs to be bottle-conditioned to be good."
"Overall a very solid and very well rounded pale. I had no problems putting this one down and could see it being a nice intro into the bigger styles. Really a solid offering here for sure."
"D- There is some trace of the higher alcohol content here, but it was not distracting or overpowering at all. I think the fact that the flavor was so mellow was a bit of a disappointment, but this was still an enjoyable beer. I finished a 750ML bottle myself over the course of an evening of cooking. Refreshing and worth trying."
"Hazy orange body, two fingers white head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. The nose was orange peel, cardamon muted pepper presence and noticeable Belgian yeast in the finish. Taste is more grainy than citrusy, pepper doesn't become prevalent until the beer is fully warmed, dry finish. Medium dry mouthfeel but not overly so, a bit sticky. Not too much of a ABV hit to effect drinkability, but it really didn't taste all that great. This ain't Duvel."
"It was light and actually pretty refreshing, as in it would be good on a hot day. But it was a little average in this respect too."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but you couldn't pound this one all night. The drinkability is detracted from a slight bit from the strong alcohol presence in the nose and throat, but otherwise is pretty easy to go down because of the light body, pilsner malt, and dry finish."
"Hmm.. interesting beer. Also had this on-tap at The Black Squirrel. Was not what I was expecting. The appearace was average, smell was fresh and light. Taste was very yeasty. I couldn't tell what it was at first, it was kind of an ""off"" flavor. I also tasted a lot of sugar and bananas. The beer was good, but very.. thin if that makes any sense. I kept waiting for more, but it just didn't deliver. There are so many other beers in this style that are available, so I wouldn't waste your time with this one."
"Appearance is a golden amber color with a very thick fluffy head and fair lace. Smell of light Belgian yeast, spice and some fruits. Taste of the sour yeast, light sweet malts with some fruit notes. Mouthfeel is a crisp light - medium body with good carbonation. Not bad, but not great, it just lacks what I expected out of a this Belgian ale."
"As I was drinking this I found myself saying 'man, this is better than Duvel,' but I almost didn't want to believe what I was thinking. I happened to have a few bottles of Duvel in the cellar, so I cracked one for a side by side. Duvel smells a bit sweeter while Lucifer has a bigger grassy hop nose and is a bit more floral I think. Taste wise, Duvel is again a bit sweeter, while the grassy and spicy characters of Lucifer jump out more. I stand by my original assessment; this is better than Duvel. It even keeps more stick than Duvel. I never had the old version of Lucifer brewed by Riva, and there are very few reviews of this new one so far, but in my opinion this is an absolutely exceptional beer. I enjoyed it immensely."
"D - Overall this is a good devil beer with a good taste that makes it easy to drink however I would choose Duvel over this one but its still worth a try at least once"
"d - Overall it is a good Belgian pale ale that feels relatively light considering it is 8% ABV. I have had it a few times now and it is something I would continue to buy when looking for a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Drinkability: tasty enough; with the good mouthfeel it's incredibly drinkable. The ABV is undetectable."
"D - A good beer, but not great. Really lacks the complexity and the ""wow"" factor I was expecting. Mostly just sweet and boozy. I feel it needs a bit more spice or other flavors. A sipper for sure."
