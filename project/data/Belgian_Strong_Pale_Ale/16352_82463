Aromas of subtle caramel, charred wood characteristics, all spice, bubble gum, subtle hops bitterness, cloves, subtle toffee sweet, and Belgian spice and funk. Flavors are hops bitter forward, with hints of citrus and resin, followed by a subtle spice blend of clove, cardamom, all spice, and nutmeg, all on a caramel sweet backbone.

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it doesn't really fit the style of a Belgian Strong Ale, but as far as funky Belgians go I think it's pretty on par and the yeast really does remind me of Brewery Vivants house yeast. The yeast did seem just a little overpowering and the barrel and hop aspects didn't show up as much as I thought they would, but I still really like liked the flavors and I thought it was enjoyable. This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, not filling, crisp and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, drinking the whole bottle is no problem and if I was really in the mood for a beer like this I could see myself drinking a couple bottles. What I liked the most about this beer how all the aspects were equally good and didn't really have a weak point. The only thing that I liked the least about this beer was how little the barrel and hops showed up, if they showed up a little more I think this would be a very good beer. I would buy this beer again, I have a bottle in the cellar and I might grab a couple more next time I'm at Boyne Country Provisions, it's a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who like the funkier Belgian ales. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it wasn't really what I expected, but I ended up enjoying it and I think the funkier yeast profile worked well with this beer. This made for a good first impression of Blue Mountain Brewery, I didn't see any of their other beer on the shelf and I don't know much about this brewery, but if I saw some of their other beers I'm pretty sure I would give them a try. Good job guys, I'm glad I took a chance on this beer and I think it really paid off. I'll be interested to see how this changes over time.","StoutHunter","Aug 31, 2013"
3.85,2.1,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"O: Overall sweetly toasted, light and freshly fruity makes this drink easier then it looks. Has a harmonous blend of belgian yeast, fresh wet fruitiness, and american spicy hops balanced nicely with subtle hints of charred oak woodiness. Everything is delicately balanced and fine tuned here, a dark looking heavy beer that really does drink much lighter then it looks. crisp and refreshing. very good try.","beerthulhu","Aug 30, 2013"

3.86,2.4,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a humongous three finger head of eggshell white to tan foam, dense with an undulating surface, excellent retention given how whipped up it is, the lacing is on the wispy side but sticks tenaciously. Translucently clear, like vellum, coppery base that turns equally brown and orange, very few bubbles to be seen. The nose has a fresh if not quite clean profile, stone, poor dirt, pepper and dried grapefruit pulps and grains, the hoppiness sneaks up on you then, wham!, the apple, pear, peach fruit is direct and underripe like you wish you left them on the counter for just another day or two, no meaningful trace of bourbon barrel aging. Medium-bodied, smooth with a pleasingly creamy texture, even the underlying sourness can’t interfere. That said, the cherry, apricot, red apple, pear, peach fruit sunny and tart in just the right way. There’s an earthy, leafy element but not thick enough to be like “sous bois” or deep forest in character. Mostly orange citrus with a hint of lemon. Clean yeastiness, some banana, spicy without any one spice leaping to the fore. Harmonized and very drinkable, probably one of those beers best not categorized, just enjoyed.","farrago","Aug 12, 2013"

4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; best before June 2014 on the cork. Pours fairly hazy deep reddish orange color with a nice 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, apple, pear, floral, grass, pepper, light clove, light oak, wheat, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and hop notes with slight barrel presence. Taste of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, apple, pear, pepper, clove, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, pepper, clove, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of yeast and hop flavors; with a great balance of malt, hop, and spicy ester notes with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity if hop, yeast, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Even though the stated barrel aging presence was minimal, it wasn’t really a determining factor for me with this style. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

Very faint bourbon notes are present throughout as the beer warms but in no way are the forefront flavor of this beer allowing a lot of these other funky and complex flavors come forward.
