"Fruit and malt on the nose. Pours brilliant orange tinted amber with a vigorous, long lasting, 3” white rocky foam cap. A fruity palate starts with orange, peach, and a hint of banana, spice, light caramel, a touch of bread, pepper and a light bitterness on the finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation. A delight to drink."
"Nice strong blonde, hops, caramel and some yeasty banana notes."

"Beer rewards alcohol flavor without giving tasteless."

"Delicious Belgian ale.  Pale golden color and nice head when poured.  Slightly boozy.  Crisp with a hint of fruitiness.  Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"The aroma is more pleasantly expressive than the flavor, while the flavor seems to be dominated by the spicy and bitter qualities with some grainy sweetness in support and fruity esters only on a very low level."

"A decent enough brew, but at 8.5% it might be too strong for some people's tastes."
"Drinkability – Easy drinking, but a bit cidery for my personal taste."

"Overall:  A damn fine beer.  Well balanced and quite tasty for the style."
"Pours an orange color with a 1/2"" head that lasts a while. Belgian yeast is strong in the aroma. Caramel, belgian yeast, citrus, and a moderate bitterness are the main flavors. Aftertaste is long. Mildly refreshing, and quite easy to drink."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/5/2012. Pours moderately cloudy golden color with a 3 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Great dense foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, bread, candi sugar, light pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, light banana, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian strong pale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - I'm still not a big fan of Belgians, but this is not a bad beer. By no means my favorite, but quite drinkable and quite interesting."
""
"O: This beer didn't seem to be as complex as other beers in the style, but hid its alcohol rather well and therefore was quite drinkable."

"a tasty belgian blonde, lost somewhere between a classic tripel and a belgian pale or strong golden. its hazy and pale yellow, with a few yeast bits and a nose of cut grass and fruity yeast coming off of a several inch tall white head that rings every sip. the taste has a little bit of floral hops on the front end, and a pretty sweet and sturdy malt base for its color, but it flavored predominantly by a classic belgian yeast strain thats got hints of pears and apples to it, without being cloying or artificial. a decent bit of residual sugar in the finish gives body by arrests drinkability significantly, and even effervescent carbonation cant cut it or lighten it up much. a hearty brew for its looks, and one that while i enjoy it quite a lot, its a one and done for me. just a bit filling and sweet for all day drinking, but its alcohol is well hidden and its quality is at the forefront of the experience."

"Less sweet than a lot of these strong Belgians. The classic blonde flavor with a restrained yet sharp, alcoholic note. On tap at Fathom in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
"Massive carbonation with a huge head of foam about an inch thick. Golden colored with a bit of haziness. Aroma of green apples and Belgian candy sugar. I also get a bit of a Belgian yeast strain in the aroma with some pale malt. The flavor is pale malt,Pale malt and a Belgian yeast strain. Mouthfeel is a bit carbonated but dry and smooth. Taste and mouthfeel are very good,but overly carbonated and the aroma is Ok."

"Poured a clearish orange although there are definitely some murky yeast or carbonation bubbles kicking around and the head and lace retention are great. Citric and some sweet fruit and definite yeast and spicy nose as it is a particularly strong beer. Crisp, light bodied, passes easy, great balance between a crisp edge thanks to spice and carbonation and a smoothness from yeast as well as some sweet fruit flavors like mango or pineapple as well as crisp citric orange. Alcohol started to warm the finish and hit me as I drank but overall this is a really enjoyable ale."
""
""
"Overall a good solid Strong Pale Ale."
""
""
"O-I had a difficult time getting into this beer. The flavors did not integrate very well with one-another. It is as if they took Tremens, which I enjoy, and injected an unnecessary hop note that just doesn't fit very well. While I did not hate this beer, there are other Belgian bitters that I would go to first."

"This is an interesting and refreshing beer."
"It's a classic tripel - sweet and full-bodied. The alcohol is well covered up here. More cookies."
""
""
""

"Medium bodied/carbonated."
""
"Overall: It fails to reach the dizzy heights of Delirium Tremens, Chimay or Duvel, but is enjoyable in its own right. Should serve to be a great winter warmer, and I would definitely drink it again if it weren't for the ghastly price of $11 a bottle."
""
"well priced and I really like the simple label and cap, I'd call it a triple not a BSPA but it could swing either way"
""
""
"Not my most favourite style, but for what it is, it is well-made - sugar, grain, fruit and restrained booze fury. Edging into Tripel territory, this is kind of a bit off-putting to actually drink. Maybe it's my unfair seasonal expectations, maybe not."
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus hops, slight grass, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level and slight dryness. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight hop, hint of alcohol, and slight earthy malt. Overall, good appearance, blend, and body."

"Overall a nicely made offering that drinks easily and offers a worthy alternative to Duvel."
""

"This beer was poured into a chalice, light honey-colored with a short but lingering head. The nose was slightly funky, with a typical Belgian yeast profile and spice, a bit of funk, and a bit of fusel alcohol. The flavor matched, but was a bit more muted...in the mouth, the texture was creamy due to the relatively high carbonation. Overall, this was a well-carbonated, very easy-drinking Belgian Pale, I look forward to drinking it again."

"On tap at Huyghe into Guillotine glass. Fluffy white head medium retention. High clarity.  Aroma, nice hoppy bouquet, light sweetness. Taste nicely bitter with slight sweetness. Dangerously drinkable.  Very refreshing  No alcohol noted at all. Our guide at the brewery says this is coming to the states soon and also said that the recipe has been tweaked to where they are now very happy with it. Look out. This one is dangerous. "
"M: sensations are complicated well balanced with some little sweetness and bitterness of course alcohol makes a complicated sensation but not unpleasant."
"Flavours include the same sweet bready malt and candi sugar. Way too sweet and cloying."
""
""
"D: High. Despite the high ABV, you cannot feel too much the alcohol. Really easy to lose the head here..."

"D – Decent drinkability, worth having one…or two. I had this beer on tap in Belgium, but didn’t write down my thoughts at the time, except to buy a couple bottles when I saw it at a shop. After tasting it again, I definitely can place it as a very good beer."
"Overall: Good beer, but not outstanding. I will try another one in the future."
"Overall: Good beer. Not their best. Wouldn't pass one down if offered."
"Will review again."
"So Peter, this a beer which is very very good. When you see it...try it."
"O: The only other BSPA that gives La Guillotine a run for the money is Don de Dieu, which has a completely different character. Most similar to Duvel, La Guillotine pleases me far more, even if it cannot serve as such a widely-regarded stylistic benchmark. The alcohol is vaguely noticeable, but completely unconcerning. I could (and would) drink a pint or more of this beer. Highly recommended."
"Just a bit too sweet and lacking in body for me, as well as the alcohol content being too obvious."
"D: I was kind of underwhelmed here. The taste is very average, and nothing really stands out."
"La Guillotine is nothing short of delicate and is clearly a finely crafted beer. To reach this sort of balance whilst maintaining a smooth mouthfeel AND high carbonation is something special to behold."
"An impressively crafted beer, just not quite as good as some others from this brewery (particularly Delerium Tremens). A good example of a Belgian tripel, and a treat to be savoured on occasion."
"This beer is a good one from Huyghe. I've had some of theirs in the past. This beer is maybe only very little different from the others."
"Again an intriguing beer from this brewer. Probably not as desirable as stablemate Delirium Tremens but still worth a look. A solid drink, but with such an odd taste it's probably not to everyone's liking."
"Mouthfeel is coarse -- not exactly rough...maybe I should call it ""airy"". Good beer, not stellar, wouldn't session it."
"Pours fizzy golden straw, slightly clouded, beer with fluffy resistant head. Sweet nose of yeasts, hop, citrus & coriander. Not very sweet taste with excessive yeasts & alcohol, moderate carbonation, nothing to add. I've perused previous reviews and thought whether liquid in my glass was the same as beer of reviewers. This one don't stun, but disappoint me."
"D: High. Despite the high ABV, you cannot feel too much the alcohol. Really easy to lose the head here..."
"A few sips per minute allows appreciation of a very good beer."
"All in all, a very nice beer. Beware of the 9% ABV, or you might just lose your head."
"Overall I feel this is a little too strong in the alcohol characteristics to be very drinkable; however, if this is brewed with only the four main ingredients as labeled on the bottle, I'd be very impressed with no sugars added."
"Notes: I was attracted to this beer since the bottle looks much like another beer brewed by this brewery, Delerium Tremens, and I am glad that I followed through on getting it. While it does not reach the level of Delerium Tremens it is a very good beer."
"drinkability: i like this style of beer it`s sour, cloudy full of yeast,and spice and many things nice,i`m still looking for the perfect beer of this style but this one is up there on the list."
"I really enjoy this, and I'm dying to try another one with a more developed palate to figure this out, on the other hand.... I'd rather have a Delerium Tremens."
"bought at drinx vanuxum(def. spelt wrong) in belgium. Poured into its own tulip glass with a large white head.Smells very sweet and earthy/hoppy.Drank while eating some clam chowder, the pepper in the chowder deffinantly accentuates the sweetness of this brew. I don't think that it would have been quite as good with out the clam chowder, which was pretty spicy. recommend drinking it with a spicy dish. with the low carbination, it won't make the dish feel hotter, it actually cools it down."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong pale ale."
"Conclusion: I'm somewhat torn on this beer. The flavors are nice, if slightly simple, and the alchol is a bit hot, but it's also nicely sharp and palate-cleansing. Overall, a pretty nice Belgian Strong Pale."
"Pretty good, finish is exceptionally dry. The acid in the smell is a little odd. Worth trying once, but I'd stick with their Delirium Tremens which is far superior."
"If you're at the Brauhaus in Brussels, go to the end of the dead-end alley and see the little-appreciated and frequently overlooked Jeanneke Pis, the squatting little sister of famous Manneken Pis!"
"R- I haven't had a bad beer from Huyghe yet. This one is worth buying at least 3 of."
"This is a very drinkable brew, and one that is smooth with age. I imagine there's some fresher characters in the younger version that I may have missed, but the mellow, creamy, languous version I have here is just fine with me..."
"d: easy to drink given the abv & plenty of taste & carbonation to keep you interested. prefer delirium over this, but not by too much"
"This would go great with a light and flaky halibut, or some angel food cake as a dessert. Very fun and interesting Belgian to sip on; glad I have another bottle to finish off the season."
"The taste, however, is a little better. Well balanced, with a bold, sweet and SPICY taste up front but a pleasantly bitter kick at the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. This is 9% abv ?! Nothing bad to say about the taste. If anything, I would say La Guillotine falls short of the 90 mark for lack of originality - it just doesn't seem that memorable. I'd get it again, but at 470 yen ($4.50), it's kind of expensive. Along with the other Brouwerij Huyghe offerings I've had ... Recommended."
"Almost tart in mouthfeel....Quite dry in profile... alcohol heat is evident."
"It's definately something I could drink a lot of, although almost too similar to its brother Delirium Tremens. Regardless, I remain very happy with it; something I'll buy again!"
"Saw this along with the small selection of non-macro singles at a local beer store. Pured a hazy amber-yellow with a ton of carbonation...as much fizz a ginger-ale. Frothy white head that left a small amount of lacing. Very much a breadish smell with a hint of that high ABV. Tasted quite yeasty with a touch of hops. Definitely feel the alcohol in the mouth afterward. Tried this one on an empty stomach...got quite the head-rush.."
"Taste has smoothed out nicely. Lots of carbonation keep it crisp and light. Yeasty flavor, with spice and pepper. A bit fruity, but not sweet, quite dry finish. Slightly alcohol aftertaste, but still well hidden. Complex, and still a bit strong in the flavor department, but has mellowed out nicely."
"I have to concur with others that it's curious Huyghe would brew another beer so similar to Delirium Tremens. This one's different enough, however, that I can state a clear preference for its superior sibling."
"Not really sure why Huyghe makes 2 different beers which are so similar. Maybe someday I'll try them side-by-side and compare for what difference must exist."
"Overall, the very light golden ale was pleasant to drink, but seemed to be one dimensional. Poured out nicely with a good head that fell quick with very little lace, but that might have been because it was a little too cold. Strong fruity esters like apple cider, and yeasty all over the place(even pouring gently and leaving an inch), and tasted very sweet on the tip of the tongue, a solid carbonation bite with a slight bitterness to the back but nothing much and no hop presence at all. I was hoping that it would warm up well, but seemed to get thinner and the 9% alcohol really expanded and filled my mouth. It comes in a sharp bottle with a guillotine on the front, so I had hope for a bit more. Good if it's in front of you and you like Huyghe. I couldn't read the best used by date on the bottle, and got it in Jasper, Alberta--so maybe it was past its prime."
"Another beer that I am happy to have discovered during my stay in a foreign land. Pours a cloudy golden tinge with a small, but impressive looking white head. Loads and loads of sediment were swirling around this beer, as well as a few other darker sediment particles that did not look attractive, but didn't seem to bug me. Smell was excellent, fruit throughout such as cherries, apples, passionfruit, pineapple. There was also a light medicinal smell in there. Taste was amazing, juicy fruit, and sweet sugary honey dominated, with some mild sour trangs coming through as it went towards the back of the palate. It was somewhat syrupy, maybe due to the honey tastes I noticed. As for drinkability, My God if only I had this beer around every night, I would be in sheer bliss. I swear this beer came straight from Hades to tempt us all with its deliciousness. Indulge"
"Drinkable, but a bit too highly carbonated for me to drink more than a couple. Fantastically enjoyable though."
"I dig Belgian Strongs, both pale and dark. This one is worth a try, complex, but still a bit unbalanced."
"A promising beer, and drinkable, but ultimately disappointing, especially given the usually fine beers produced by this brewery."
"A fairly standard Belgian Pale. Could be better, could be alot worse."
"Notes: I wish this beer had some sort of head retention or lacing, but at 9%, I can understand why it doesn't. This beer has mellowed out into a smooth and fruity Belgian beer. The alcohol is still quite strong after spending so much time in the bottle, and the heavy carbonation makes this a slow sipping beer. Its still very good."
"Drinkability: For the style, this is well drinkable. These kinds of strong Belgian ales aren't usually too good to have dozens of, but this one is nice and I could see myself having a few in rapid succession. Still, if I wanted to get that smashed I might as well drink a couple then switch to some cheap local macro brew. I'm enjoying this one now though, and this will become a regular I think."
"I find this beer to be all over the place. There are mouthfulls that I find fantastic and mouthfulls that put me off a bit. It's certainly a complex and interesting beer."
"Overall, this is a really nice beer...I wouldn't - or perhaps couldn't, at this strength! - have more than a couple at a sitting, but I certainly will have it again."
"Upfront, the taste is even more fruity - peaches and pears, with an odd grainy texture that I didn't quite like. This is followed by a long, peppery, phenolic aftertaste that's quite spicy and a bit overpowering. Not quite as balanced or tasty as I'd like."
"This beer makes me think that Huyghe can actually brew but oddly enough, it is very similar to the Tremens...."
"Mammoth head, near brilliant white, and very fine-bubbled, milk-like. The lacing moves quickly, but it does stick. Cloudy, peachy, yellow in some light, light brown in others. The appearance is everything a Belgian strong ale should be. The aroma is super sweet, strongly fruit-filled, and syrupy. Apricot, peach, and tart candy. Mmm. The strongly sweet aroma gets high praise from sweet-beer lovers. There is a creamy quality about the aroma as well, and the yeasty freshness is superbly appetising. The taste is very much like wine or sherry, along with some ultra-sweet fruit brandies I have tasted. The phenolic taste is not overwhelming, though very tangible: otherwise there are sweet malt, apricot and berries of various sorts, mint, and earthy yeast tastes, leaving a dry puckering mouth sensation. The finish, though, is extremely alcoholic, leaving the tongue with a warming, burning feel, which is the only reason this is not an easily drinkable beer. High carbonation, and full-bodied. No, this is enjoyable only perhaps occasionally, and certainly no more than two in the same session. High carbonation, and full-bodied. This is more akin to a fruit brandy or port. Phenomenal."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, the best part of the brew for me. Carbonation is light but sharp, especially felt on the tongue, as soon as the cream from the head passes. Very good drinkability. 9% is imperceptible except for the warming of the stomach."
"Reminds me a lot of Delirium Tremens, the most famous beer from this brewer, which makes you wonder why..eh, but why wonder, why wonder...A good bottle of suds, I sez!"
"Slightly above average beer but below average Belgian."
"Came in a green 330 ml bottle coated with grey enamel, red foil around neck and cap, best before date marked on back label. Appearance is a hazy golden apricot hue, foamy white head that eventually recedes to a thin cap. Spicy nose, peppery, clove and banana, sweetish fruit like peach or apricot, some boozy pear, sweet malt. Flavour is peachy and peppery, boozy malt finish, but that taste of fruit comes back to linger on the aftertaste. Big boozy mouthfeel, the alcohol definitely makes its presence known. Probably one of the best specimens I've had from this family brewery so far, it has a well rounded character, and a very memorable one at that."
"Poured with a white head that stays, leaving no lace. Low carbonation. Light golden color. Nose is alcohol and apple. Starts with an alcohol flavor, and finishes the same but smooth. Some sweet overtones but the alcohol overwhelms the malts and hops. The 330ml bottle was found in York, England for £2.25."
"It's a mighty brew, perhaps a bit much for me. Still, that's not the beer's fault, is it?"
"-F"
"Not too good, quite spicy and fizzy, but i really didn't like the detergenty taste that it left in your mouth, it could be quite good, but its just a bit fizzy and soapy for me."
"Notes: Spicy and quite flamboyant, that is just what I want in my Belgian Pale Strong Ale. Perhaps a little over the top but there is nothing wrong with that. Complex and flailing with wild flavours."
