"Boozy, fruity and a little sweet, but well done"

"Excellent strong pale ale.  Slightly too high in alcohol level for the style giving it a slightly boozy taste which is really it's only flaw."
""
"O- good!"
""
"Smell is amazing yeasty phenols, sweet bubble gum and slight musty grains.  Taste is peppery, fruity and medicinal, sweetness is tamed by medium bitterness and warm alcohol.  Fantastic beer, more complex than Duvel."
""
""
"Yeasty nose with traces of ripe and over ripe fruit and light grains. Depending on the temperature it pours either brilliant gold or gold with a slight haze. The head is enormous – 3” or more of pure white finely bubbled foam that persists and leaves ledges of lace inside the glass. The palate offers peaches in different stages of ripeness followed by an earthy hop bitterness on the finish with a layer of malt sweetness and alcohol. It is slightly warming but the alcohol is not hot or solventy. The body is suprising medium for the amount of alcohol and flavor and the carbonation is above average."
""
"A piece of art. It brings the flavor to your mouth and you wouldn't be able to detect it's large ABV."
"Wonderfully complex and balanced, sweetness and bitterness combined like yin and yang, an effervescent mouthfeel but not too cheek-puffing, an unbridled yeasty, malty, and hoppy delight. This is ale. And quite strong ale at that. Aye,  mateys!"
""
"Yeast & dry grain on the nose, pretty carbonated, taste is mostly medium toasted malt & cereal grain, earthy with just enough hop profile to give it a pop, not bitter, lots of earthy yeast with some dry fruit, very good belgian style ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very sweet and boozy. Not what I want from a Belgian Pale Ale."
""
"Cheaper than the more popular belgian beers. Reminds me a lot of st bernardus. Definitely on my favorites list. Totally recommend it."
""
"good beer!  Glad I was able to try."
""
""
""
""
"Pours almost clear orange amber with 1 1/2 fingers of white, frothy head with excellent retention & decent sheet-like lacing. Aroma sweet Belgian yeast, fruity esters especially banana & hints of orange & apple, some cloves & other spices, honey, faintly hoppy.  Taste is sweet yeast, cherry, some banana & apple, hints of citrus, biscuity malt, honey, alcohol & hop bitterness in the finish & aftertaste. Rich & complex in all categories."
"This is good stuff. One of the best Belgians."
""
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a trippel with the bubblegum taste. It's hot with the ABV but tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much alcohol flavour. Worse than GD or San Agus."
""
""
"Almost has a cider sweetness to it"
""
""
""
"perfectly crafted Ale."
""
""
""
"the style is not my favorite but it is a very good beer"
"Golden straw in the glass. Hoppy aromas- pine, plus fruit (banana?), plus more pine. Hint of clove. Medium, smooth body. Tastes of fruits and clove. Fruits include banana and some others (tropical?) that I can't place. Midway through the swig the alcohol kicks in. And it never fades back out."
"Rich and malty. Great for a cold winter evening when you need to warm up."
""
"Price Point - $4.59/11.2 oz bottle"
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark amber with fluffy khaki colored head, settles slowly to a quarter inch, splotchy rings on the glass. Smell: pear, cooked red delicious apple, peppery and spicy, orange peel. Taste: pear, candied orange peel, dried apricot, bready, caramel note, big spicy and peppery flavors and a little grassy. Syrupy-to-fluffy, peach skin finish. Huge and delicious with just a touch of warming alcohol. From corked and caged 750, no date found on bottle but judging from the label design it's 2013/4 bottling."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.29, an awesome A-. This is one of my favourite styles of beer, and I must say that Piraat compares admirably to many of my long-time favourites like Duvel, La Chouffe and Don de Dieu. This is a sinfully-tasty strong Belgian golden ale, and its alcohol content is so masterfully masked that I'd be likely to place it closer to 7-8% than 10-11% on a blind test. A great way to cap off Christmas 2014, and any fan of strong Belgian pales should consider this an absolute must-try."

"Teku glass. Deep amber/gold colour with nice, big, creamy white, long lasting head. The aroma is big biscuit, bready mixed with hops - mainly fruit aromas and some herbs, spices (coriander?), again the big grainy aroma and also grape juice. The taste is medium to heavy sweet, crackery, some biscuit, warming booze sensations, there are also some yeasty notes - clove and earthy. The aftertaste is big malty and again bready. The warming booze sensations begins somewhere in the middle till very end. The body is smooth, thick with high carbonation and smooth finish. In overall interesting belgian beer, which strikes with lots of aromas and flavours."

"I think I might have rated this slightly higher (3.85 or 3.9) if I did precise (and based on previous experiences with the beer).  This particular taste I rated down the taste because it didn't sit as well with me as it has in the past (I wavered b/t 3.5 and 3.75).  Will continue to grab this occasionally, as I feel I do still enjoy it."
""
""
""
"Good but at least in my opinion it's not duvel, the sheer brute force and stature of this beer may make it a tad difficult to appreciate some of the finer subtleties present, these flavors will fade before you are done reeling from the size of this beer"
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great beer, well balanced and goes well with cheese, pizza and high fat/greasy fair. Palate cleansing."

"Piraat pours a golden color with a big lacing head.  There is a big aroma, lots of candy aromas, hints of peach and yeast.  The taste is very fruity, lots of peach, lots of candy, hints of a warm alcohol.  Big body, nice feel too.  Overall its a big strong beer, too sweet and fruity for me."

"Good stuff from Belgium"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It is not top of the line but it isn't very far off. Love that it packs a decent punch and is not overly sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing.  Hazy golden body with a thick, lasting white head.  Smell of lemon peel, a little herbal hop, candy sugar, and yeast.  Fantastic taste that is smooth and sweet with just enough bitterness to prevent any sticky, cloying sweetness.  There is a nice malt backbone to this with a smooth honey and candy sugar sweetness."
"This is one of the best Belgian ales of all time. I rate it slightly above Maredsous. One of those ""if I was stranded on a desert island, and had only one beer...."" kind of beers!"

"Pours a brilliant light golden with a lingering frothy ivory head. Aroma is floral, with green apple sharpness and notes of perfumey hops. Flavor reveals more sweetness, with cherry cough drop coming to mind. Finish is alcoholic. The phenols are overpowering."
""
""
""
"OVERALL - A bit boozy, but a nice beer, sippable, not quaffable. Advertised as bitter, but it's not at all bitter IMHO."

"Good, balanced strong ale; not oversweet, nor too bitter."

"Good beer, though I was expecting a bit more complexity, but on the other hand, it was surprisingly hoppy for the style and interesting that borders other styles besides Strong Golden Ale such as Belgian IPA and Tripel."

"A robust tan head throws a thick blanket over this orange brew. Smells of mostly light fruits (pear, green apple, peach), Belgian yeast and very faint hops, if any. Big fruits and subtle hops mix quickly on the tongue and play together nicely, forming a pleasant, creamy, medium body. Alcohol heat flickers across the back of the throat. Flavorful and consistent all the way through."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out to a generous buff head and orange-amber color. Aroma is clove, fruit, spice, bubblegum, aged hops and sugary sweet grains. Flavor is complex, strong on alcohol and esters and finishes boozy yet balanced. Mouthfeel is effervescent and medium. Overall a very good belgian ale. I don't think ""IPA"" fits here."
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Tavern wenches... but seriously this bold ale would have to be paired with a bold meal - char-grilled meats, bold cheeses, large Cuban cigars and gunpowder, yes gunpowder... (these food match things I write are getting rather silly now aren't they?)."
""
"O: It’s in the same vein as Duvel and I'm guessing the hops are Saaz? Just as I was getting bored of Belgian beer. Very nice."
"The beer pours a rich, golden amber and sits in the glass as a dark orange. A head of off-white bubbles forms above the beer but quickly whittles to a scrim. In body the beer is dark and opaque, with hints of cloudiness swirling before the eyes. When washed against the sides of the glass, it leaves a nice set of legs. On the nose, the beer smells of musty grains, honey, fusel alcohol, and cidery fruit notes. Hints of herbal and minty hops work their way into the scent as the glass is agitated, as well as subtle sherry. The smell is not particularly strong for a 10.5% ABV beer, but is instead richly subtle and restrained. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a warming, grainy, alcohol heat that builds to just before the finish. The finish splashes slight herbal hops and just a whisper of acidity and salinity, rounding the beer into a subtly complex giant. In flavor, the beer tastes of sweet cereal grains, which move into rich, silky clover honey before introducing sweet, grainy alcohol. The alcoholic heat builds into the finish of the beer, briefly skirting on cloying and then on to fusel notes, before it mellows into a minerally-sweet finish that blends the honey malts with herbal, minty hops, booze, very faint lemongrass, and a touch of salty bread. The aftertaste is of lingering honey and herbal, bitter hops that linger in the mouth for quite some time. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body with a crisp, sharp, yet smooth mouthfeel, and silky carbonation. The mouth is left tingling from the alcoholic heat when the beer leaves, but is then doused in a torrent of spittle that pours from the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a beautifully restrained Belgian Strong Golden Ale. The yeast character is soft, though subtle phenols and esters do start to sprout as the beer warms. This is a beautiful sipper, and a wonderful example of how to brew with a restrained hand (quite the opposite of most American brewers these days…). The more I drink this beer, the more flavors I unravel, which is excellent."

"O: suppose I'll have to try this again, poured more carefully... won't go out of my way though... it's ok, just artfully refined and somewhat boring, a vehicle for booze"
"A nice looking first pour and good lacing make this an attractive beer. It has good mouthfeel. The only detraction is the heavy appearance of alcohol in both the nose and taste. A shame; otherwise this beer would be excellent."

"Pours a pretty cloudy dark-orange in color with a half finger off-white heat that stays around for a long time. There is a bunch of sediment in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. Lots of sticky lacing is seen with each sip as well. There is a bunch going on with the aroma as there is caramel malts, lemon grass, dark fruits and honey. The taste has a lot going on as well with sweet malts right up front, followed by plums and some sweet bourbon-like flavor for the finish. I am surprised it is a I.P.A. style brew as there is no bitter/hoppy aftertaste at all. You don't taste the high alcohol content either. Goes down easy and after one of these, on a empty stomach, you will feel it. Over a great brew!"

"O - piraat ale is a classic for me. One of the first true Belgian ales that got me hooked to the world of craft beer and Belgium in general. A true genius recipe that still plays a major role in my craft beer life. It's always there and will never let you down. This is something people will be drinking til the end of time"

"Poured from bottle into tulip. Whether on draft or in bottle, this beer never fails to impress. Not a great aroma, but the taste is very enjoyable and satisfying, with hints of spiciness and moderate floral notes. While a huge Belgian fan, this style has never been one of my favorites. I'm not sure why. But Piraat has always been a favorite of mine in this style, with easy drinkability, very moderate hops, and an almost undetectable alcohol presence for its high abv. And I love the bottle. I'll always have a place in my heart for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very pleasant and tasty Belgian strong. It’s a classic for a reason as it has a nice blend of Belgian strong with just enough hop to keep it lively."

"O: A good, obtainable Belgian style IPA. Perhaps not the best, but a great example of the style, very drinkable, and quite tasty."
""
""
"O: A surprisingly good Belgian IPA. Nice crisp flavors and fruitiness. Tastes really light and refreshing until I realized this was 10.5%! It goes down like a 6% belgian pale. Great balance and drinkability is off the chart. One of the best belgian IPAs I've ever had."
""
""
""
" The taste is very good -lots of yeast providing a sort of fruity tangy element which leads to a more hop driven spice and herbal mix. The taste of candy sugar is there but it is not obtrusive, more complimentary to the yeast and supplements the bitterness of the hops in a tasty way. There is a good amount alcohol to bolster the hops in the flavor- more of a strong pale than Belgian IPA to my taste, but who knows what this is like fresh in Belgium?-Not me. I like this but it seems stronger than most of its strength. I like the taste and would definitely buy this again considering its complexity."
""
"O- A little more alcohol flavor than I prefer. I think it takes away from some of the other great aspects of this one."

"Bottle from the Lazy Dog Pours a hazy medium golden color with a huge bubbly white head that takes forever to subside, in fact this bottle tried to pour itself. Aromas of honey and pilsner malt with hints of sweet fruit, a bit of peppery spice, clove, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is honey like malty sweetness with a solid shot of warming alcohol. Bits of light sweet fruit like apple, pear, and raisin offset with a spicy earthy yeasty flavor. Medium to thick body with a spirited level of carbonation but a thick sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Nice sipping beer, flavorful and tasty, I’m glad I threw this one in the mixed six the other day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is perfect. Three finger head, a light honey brown color along with solid carbonation providing a enjoyable mouthfeel. At the end of the day I like to relax with one brew or two. If that beer happens to be a Piraat then I'm a happy camper."

""

"Overall not a bad beer. I think it is something I would enjoy more in the spring or summer, but that is just my preference. I have to say that the high abv was well hidden, and it was perhaps a little too easy to drink."
""
"great Belgian strong here, but a shade below the hype. its blonder than expected, with a robust inch of thick white foam. lemon lime color, simple, but elegant. the nose is bitter indeed, but not fully from hops, some funny malting strategy here perhaps is to blame, or maybe it is hops, hard to tell from smell alone. I don't get the other hop essentials, so im confused. rich flavor, creamy feel, vanilla before the bitter taste comes in. rich grain bill, oats maybe here, like a tripel, but not sweet at all, minus the candy sugar. interesting, but the alcohol is strong. its almost too strong. the taste finishes with a burn, and its moderately unflattering, but still unique to this brew alone with all that strange bitter. well carbonated and smooth, aside from the booze burn. less drinkable than many, but a complex and well refined glass of ale. ill be back."

"Pours light orange gold with thick white creamy head. Smells of pears, honey, light alcohol, and some citrus fruit. Taste is divine, very fruity pears, citrus, sweet sugars, with light belgian spice. Sweet and hides the booze well. Medium mouthfeel, a bit slick, but goes down easy. Not sure how to characterize this one, but it is fantastic. I would love to drink this all the time."
"I enjoyed it so much in fact that before I left for the evening I grabbed a growler and shared it with my colleagues the following evening at a dinner event. All but one person found the beer to be exceptional. The nay-sayer is admittedly only fond of Coors Light and Michelob Golden Draft Light so I wasnt' surprised in the least that he would poo-poo this dilectable beverage. To each their own though. I personally don't enjoy lima beans....there...I said it."
"Left wanting, somehow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - While I really enjoyed my beer (third best of the six pack), I found it a touch overly refined and less extreme than I hoped for. Would never turn one down as this remains one of the best in the style."

""
""

"Overall: This is a fine presentation from Van Steenberge. I acquired this beer in a Van Steenberge mix 6 pack that I carry at my shop. I was hoping for a more complex profile similar to Gulden Draak (triple). However, this beer is a great Belgian Ale that delivers and will definetly be carried now as its own item in my shop. It is very drinkable on any occasion (not too complex, but absolutely not bland either)."
"Overall, I'm glad to have sampled this beer, but it's not one I'm likely to get again. In many ways, it reminds me of Green Flash's Le Freak, but it's a bit more unbalanced than that version, even though both are quite strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Piraat. Ah, yeah."
""
""
""
""
"To be fair, this was strong and not something that could be quickly downed. That had nothing to do with the taste however, as this was great from start to finish and had enough to like in it like so many other Belgian beers. Even with the hint of lemon in the mouthfeel, this was very aggressive and spices are minor enough not to detract from that. A great beer that deserves to be savored slowly for all that its worth."

"I am sad to have to have finished halfway through this without going on any further, as I remember I used to love this one a lot. I hold the belief that this brewery makes great offerings (Gulden Draak), but I'm going to start opening all these remaining bottles from the gift pack that I negligently stored away. However, I feel that overall this isn't much better fresh - it simply lacks the subtlety of dried hops I enjoy in the style, and seems to be way too over-boozed for its own good."

"O- Great ale. Alcohol is hidden more so in the flavor than the aroma. I enjoyed it."

"Great pour. Three finger head that sustains. Good lacing. Dark amber color. Smells great. I love the bottle cap artwork. Very very good beer. The taste is outstanding. Does not taste like a 10.5% beer. It goes down very smooth followed by a malty and thin but strong aftertaste.A great after dinner beer. Outstanding."

"O: Wonderful. May have found a new favorite. I had this listed as a 4.5/5 in my tasting book... but now getting to review, this may go higher. The burning alcohol in the throat lasts a while. I don't know if that helps or hurts this beer."
""

"O-I love Belgians but I had never tried Piraat until now. I am glad I did. This beer is not for the timid...it shows all of the 10.5% ABV in both smell and taste, but it certainly is fun. The hoppy bitterness, like many of Piraat's Belgian counterparts, is not in-your-face, but it creeps in towards the finish and provides just a bit of balance for the pale malty sweetness that mostly dominates. Brash and enjoyable."

"Overall I wasn't all that impressed, the abv was very well hidden but apart from that this just tasted like a standard Belgian style pale ale."
"This is excellent. I had a difficult time ascertaining the smell and taste particulars, but had no trouble at all enjoying this brew. The pepper and alcoholic content were the most noticeable to me. I really thought it was beautiful to look at, and the taste was very unique. I will get this again."

"Superb - goes down a treat. Looks great, and the aroma and flavour are wonderfully smooth and mellow. Plenty of booze yet it complements the character perfectly. The body envelops the palate. Not sure how it got listed as an IPA; not much going on in the way of hops. A fantastic strong Belgian ale - I really shouldn't have put this off for so long. Well worth sampling if you come across it."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/20/2012. Cork blew off into the cage as soon as I removed it. Pours fairly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, floral, and light earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with malt sweetness. Taste of pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, floral, honey, candi sugar, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, prickly, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong pale ale. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters and malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for 10.5%. A very enjoyable offering."
"Enjoyed on a bitterly cold night, while fine white snow accumulates outside, classical music fills the hush and low light splashes across the room."

"D: A very nice brew indeed. Excellent example of style. Well crafted with good complexity and yet extremely drinkable. ABV is tremendously well hidden...nigh unbelievable. The more I drink it, the more I like it."

""
""
""
""
"Taste is quite good with a dry spiciness, pale and pil malts. It's bitter alittle sweet and not a hint of alcohol, while drinking it anyway."
"Overall: Just an amazing and delicious Belgian IPA. Not quite as hoppy as the American IPAs that I love but an excellent example of the Belgian IPA style."

"Overall - A good beer, certainly, and quality throughout. That said, I just don't think most true Belgian brews are my thing. I've had more than my fair share, and most of them don't hit that 'Ahh, I gotta have that again!' feeling. I probably wouldn't buy this beer again, but if this is someone's favorite beer, I can understand why. There's just too much sugar character for me. I think I'll steer clear of Belgians for awhile."

"O: Excellent Belgian brew – complex aroma and flavors and enough alcohol to make it interesting."

"The nose picked up an array of lovely desserts made in grandma’s kitchen with the main, but secret, ingredient being a bitter molasses. That would define this brew. I had to go for round two, and then round three in the bottle. Each time the carbonation pairing well with the malt for a pleasant mouthfeel. The color is something or other of a high heat fire burning the wet driftwood on a beach outside of Portobello while on a search for the rest of Captain Morgan's loot that the history books never got around to mentioning, and for good reason. The head and lace of a cloudy white, like a fire that has to churn the water to vapors to provide a dense white smoke that lingers in the glass while settling and becoming twice as dense. Aside from the mass production of this said product, we have a brew that would appease even the most eccentric of the privateers out there."

"Way too much carbonation."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Copper to amber colour, clear, one finger tanned head which soon faded, clear. Aroma was phenol, hubba bubba, yeast and booze which got more pronounced as the beer warmed. Tasted apples, bananas, yeast and molasses. As expected it was quite bitter, generally the booze was well hidden. Well carbonated which gave it a slightly coarse edge, slightly thick body. Liked it but don't think it did quite enough to justify some of the hype."

"11.2oz. bottle served in my Weyerbacher tulip. Pours a dull, burnt-orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is two inches, dense and off-white and eventually settles into a consistent, frothy, quarter inch skim. Textured swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses notes of candi sugar, citrus rind, green apple, and a slightly herbal quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of a light, toasted malt character. There's also a trace of bitterness towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, with a lively carbonation and a bit of acidic astringency. I'm not sure I'd classify this as a Belgian IPA as it's closer to a BSPA in my opinion. That said, this beer is quite tasty and complex with an extremely well-hidden abv. I'm sorry I put off trying this it for so long."

"I think that the mouthfeel is the best part. Not my thing."
""
""

"Overall: Complex and interesting, really worth sipping slowly and identifying different flavors and aromas. The alcohol is invisible until the very end. Mouthfeel lets it down a bit, but its still a top Belgian pale in my books."

"O: I'm not getting IPA out of this one, more like a Tripel to me. With a 10.5 ABV this is a sipper so take your time and enjoy, gets even better with time as it warms up. Grab this one if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A spicy and well balanced beer. Leans more on the spice than on the yeast making it more reminiscent of a spicy Duvel than like yeasty La Fin Du Monde."
""
""
"O – As I was saying I can see how some people might think that this beer isn’t phenomenal, I really can, the nose is funky and odd and entirely wonderful with it’s beautiful clashing of malt and hops and some fruit that turns into this sort of ALMOST overwhelming symphony of smells. But the clashing nature of them somehow just really works out. It isn’t too much. It is delicious. In the nose, on the palate, the mouthfeel. It’s all spot on. This is a great, and in my opinion, a somewhat underrated beer. You just gotta love it the right way."
"O - A bold Belgian with loads of flavour and an incredibly well hidden ABV. This stuff is very sweet, but still easily sessioned. A great selection an well worth seeking out."
""
""
"O - This is a good brew. I didn't know what to expect but the more I tasted it, the more I enjoyed it. Most-times, triples and quads are too Belgian estery/fruit/yeasty for my tastes and I often avoid ordering the style. This appeals enough to my love for American DIPAs to say that I'll seek this out again. Good stuff."

"Pours a dark amber honey with slight murkiness, almost 10W-30ish with zero head, slight foaming ala an espersso corona. Smell is undetectable to very slightly sweet. Taste is remarkable. I am a fan of BSDAs and If I didn't know better, I would think this is a BSDA, although this is classified as a BIPA. Fruity notes, not overpowering. 10.5% alcohol not apparent; no booziness that I could detect. Mouthfeel very pleasant consisting of a mild carbonation. Overall a fine offering from a 6 pack sampler of 330 ml bottles. Much nicer than I expected."
""
""
""
""
"O - Much better than the first time I had this one (my palette was in its youthful stages). That said, I can list a number of Belgians that are flat out better than this one. Great flavors going on here, mostly the tropical fruits whereas most Belgians [darks] have such a deeper, darker take."
""
""
""
"M: Nice, medium-full-bodied beer with high carbonation that keeps it crisp and drinkable despite the strength."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, grain, fruit, honey, and citrus zest. There is an alcohol kick and a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty damn strong."

"O- Superb Belgian style IPA. I had this a year ago (with questionable freshness) and I didn't like it but I am very impressed with it now. Amazing how much your palate can adapt in a year. Certainly worth checking out by any IPA or Belgian beer fan. Watch out for freshness however, I really enjoyed the hop profile in this beer."
"One of my favourites, not top 10 but very close. This amber coloured strong blond ale can be enjoyed with our without adding the yeast from the bottle. Personally, I prefer to add, it gives the beer that extra 'punch'. Complex & rich taste, starting with an 'in your face' hoppy biterness, followed by a caramel-like sweetness with a peppery finish which is washed away by light sweetness again, kicking in a bit stronger then first ! It has a little sticky mouthfeel afterwards so it will not be your preffered thirst-quenching drink but still very enjoyable on a warm summer evening outside."
"O - the best Belgian IPA i've tried to date, bar none!"
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the nice head, as expected for the style, and the wildly complex aroma. The smell here really does trump the taste, with beautiful spicy inclusions that translated into more puckering sourness in the taste, rather than enhancing and deepening the grain. Nice and complex, and tasty for the style."
""
""
"Despite all that, the flavors are still solid and there is still a good hop presence. The front end is sweet from the candi sugar and malts, bready from the malt and yeast, and that hop bitterness follows as well. The booze also comes through in the flavor. There is some faint fruitiness as well, but it is mild and takes a back seat to the other flavors. The body is medium with abundant carbonation. The higher alcohol can definitely be felt here, but it should at 10.5%. The finish is slightly dry. This is an excellent beer."
"O- I don't know why I expected more from this BIPA, I keep reviewing this style that I clearly don't enjoy. The only exceptions being Belgian Monk and I did like Tramp Stamp. This one could tone down the booze a bit and probably receive a better rating from me."
""
"O: A very grapey, sweet BIPA. Could use more balancing bitterness."
""
""
""
"O-I love this style and this is an awesome example. The hops really balance this out. Hopefully, we get some more Midwest examples of this style."

"O- tons of flavor, nice hop balance. Great beer belgo ipa, 10.5% is completely hidden except for a slight warming."

"the first thing i noticed, after looking at the BA site, is that this is referred to as a Belgian IPA. on the bottle it says 'Belgian Ale'. is this a mistake on BA's part or is this qualified as a real IPA? i have come to expect IPAs to be very hoppy (i prefer maltier recipes)and this is not coming close to being hoppy. at 10.5% ABV, though, this is a very drinkable beer. it came in a sample pack from the local Total Wine store and all have been excellent."

"Poured from bottle into glass. There was a sudsy white head that soon dissipated to clots leaving Brussels lace. The beer looks like a heavy apple juice. Piraat smells like a yeasty banana, pear and apricot concoction. In the taste there is also a light citrus peel-like quality. There is a smart tingle in the tip of the tongue, a complex fruity flavor, and, true to a good Belgian, a perfect hop balance. Forget the grog. Piraat will chase away the scurvy."
"Overall this was a tasty and decently complex Belgian IPA. By no means the hoppy Belgian-style IPAs we have here in America, but a more traditional take on the style. I feel the ABV was a touch high, and started to detract from the overall flavor profile; but the alcohol was very clean and was in no way offensive. Recommended to any fan of Belgians, or a fan of IPAs looking to try something different. Cheers!"
"overall i enjoyed this one. very tasty and flavorful, though nothing transcendent. will buy again. next time though will pick up a bottle to take my time with at home where i can give it my full attention."
"No freshness date. Tastes like their could be age since the hops play a very small role, either way, this'll age with the best of them."
""
"Cool label too."
"Smell and Taste: wheaty citrus, mix of hops, velvety smooth Belgian yeast notes, perhaps the most refreshing 10+ ABV beer I've had. Very good stuff."
""
"The only draw back to this beer is the price. I can't find a 4 pack for under 18 dollars, nor can I find a 750 ml bottle for under 13 dollars."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep yellow-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, spice, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, spice, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The fruit presence on both the aroma and flavor were the dominant factor going on here and covered up what could have been quite a few subtle notes that got lost. I really hope this was not the case as this one had the potential to be a really nicely done brew for the style, but just lacked the complexity I love from some of the brews of this style. Glad this one is easy to find as I might keep a few in my fridge for future tastings/guests to enjoy."
""
"Update: I don't like Belgian IPA"
"This is a fine, powerful, and intense brew; hard to think of anything better for its style"
""
""
"O: a classic - never question the integrity of the classic Belgian beers - a strong, fresh, bright, and yet deep beer. Stronger than it drinks. Don't kid yourself, this is a high abv drink (10.5) but it is extremely delicious. It might not sound like much, but this is a Top 25 beer for me - remember, there's a lot of beers, so Top 25 is a pretty exclusive club. A true ""go to"" beer, like a Duvel or an Old Rasputin."
"A magnificent beer."
"RJT"
"O: I don't remember having this beer before. It's really not quite what I expected - thought there would be more hop/bitter character than I'm finding. The dry finish is interesting, given the sweet/fruity aroma & initial taste. Still, it's a good beer, and one that's growing on me as I drink it. As a side note - given the over 10% ABV, the alcohol is very well-hidden (although you do taste it)."
""
"I can't believe I haven't rated this yet, after drinking it for the last 15 yrs. Pours a hazy amber topped with a foamy white head. Great lace and retention. Faint malty sweetness in the aroma with some grass and hints of pepper & spice. Huge malt profile of sweet malts with a massive honey-like character and notes of tropical fruits. Alcohol warms the palate and a sting of spice, then gives way to a smooth grassy bitterness and big dose of the pepper. The dry and bitter charactered finish brings spice, citrus and alcohol along, which leaves a tart-spicy-fruity aftertaste behind. Every síp brings a new impression, it’s well balanced and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Poured an 11.2 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Sported a great golden color in the body and a healthy layer of sudsy froth up top. The bite of this beer is fantastic and the ABV, while high, is so well hidden that I would call this the most drinkable beer in this range I've ever had and certainly the best Belgian IPA. I had this for the first time in about five years last night and I remember it being my favorite beer at the time. While I knew my fond memory of having it the first time would overshadow the second time around. That said, a wonderful Belgian creation, well worth the $15-$20 for a four pack."

"Warms in the body. High alcohol beer that is well hidden... a bomb! Very good beer."

"Enormous fluffy head eventually collapses into itself somewhat but just won't quit, lingering on at no less than one finger. Unreal lacing. Beautiful burnished gold shade looks perfectly inviting especially when held right up by a light source, just a touch of haze but not so much that it obscures the perpetual effervescence at the heart of the beer. Simply gorgeous. The smells are spicy and yeasty. Pretty prominent clove aroma, maybe some nutmeg. Alcohol is fairly obvious - a human being will smell boozy after consuming this, and even a tiny person is considerably larger than a 11.2 oz bottle. Flavors come on sweet and spicy at first, a lot of intensely caramel sweet and somewhat acidic fruity flavors. The hops basically ambush the scene after hiding out on the aroma front. Not much in the way of hop flavor either, but their bitterness comes on strong right along with the boozy warming sensation to create a memorable beer experience. The hops are enough to dry your mouth out, but the beer itself could finish a bit drier. This is a big, pushy beer and the carbonation level also fits those descriptors, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing as it serves to lively up a beer that would feel much stickier otherwise. All together, I personally really enjoyed this beer after having one for the first time in a long time. I feel like this one sometimes gets disrespected or overlooked by some for being widely available, or being part of a somewhat larger conglomerate, or whatever, but if an American brewery produced something like this people would be falling all over themselves (if distribution was limited and they used the word ""barrel", anyway). A must-drink for anyone interested in the wide world of belgian beer, and a good lesson that the concept of an intensely bitter beer had crossed the minds of belgian brewers long ago."
""
"This was one of the best of the type I've had. It's a manly, aggressive drink so you can't knock them back all night, but it makes a great sipper for late in the evening. Despite the manliness, it's pretty easy to drink unless you chug it."
""
"Overall - very interesting brew, and good-tasting as well."
""
""
""

""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a dark, vibrant, honey-copper coloring with a foamy, frothy, small bubbled white head that has a great cling along the glass. Nose is subtle, with some light spicing atop the boozey and rich, malty backbone. Smells solid and strong. Flavors are more heavily spiced, with a strong clove and grains of paradise character along the rich fruit and boozey backbone. Fruits range from pineapple to pear, and grapefruit to apple. Slightly cloying, resiny sweet aftertaste with a mild hopping. The finish is rich and slick, with an oily mid-linger. Great lacing left behind as you drink, and the spices leave a pleasant, cleansed feeling on the palate. The increased ABV is blended well into the beer, making it very easy to drink. Solid brew."
"This is a very nice beer, easily enjoyed equally for its sippability and its complexity. I definitly recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian ales with a good note of hops. I do wish I had this a little fresher as this bottle is probably about a year old. I think that the hop notes would not be as subdued, even though that was not a negative for my tasting. This was a very enjoyable drink."

"Pours with a thick white foam head. Beautiful honey , amber slightly hazy color. Nice earthy , hoppy , slightly caramel , clove like scent. Lacing sticks to glass long after head dissipates. Tastes crisp , spicy, Rasiny ,slightly bitter. Medium body warm mouth feel. A very nice Belgium IPA. The yeast makes this beer very funky while the hops balance the flavors with bitterness. This is an excellent Belgium IPA."
""

"Loud pop as the cork pops off. Pours clearer than a fresh version, though a minor haze remains. Slight amber with an aggressive head with a moderate pour. Aroma from this beer has faded into obscurity. Faint yeast and malt smell bounce off a surprising amount of foam. Taste of nearly over-sweet malt and robust esters from the yeast. All hop presence has vanquished. Impressive lacing for a beer of this age. Overall, not something I think I would cellar again as this beer is far superior fresh."

"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good beer and an Ok Belgian IPA, it wasn't nearly as hoppy as I thought it would be but all the other complex flavors and aromas seemed to make up for that and came together to make for a good beer. This beer had pretty damn good drinkability, It went down smooth and faster then I expected and it hid it's 10.5% alcohol very well. What I liked most about this beer was the complexity of the aroma and flavor, there was a lot going on and it all came together nicely. What I liked least about this beer was the lack hops, the hops were there but there weren't nearly as noticeable as I would expect from a Belgian IPA, a bigger hop profile would really take this beer to the top. I would buy this beer again, but it was a little pricey so this would make a good beer for special occasions, if you like Belgian beers then this one is for sure worth a try. This was the first Belgian IPA I have had that is actually Belgian so the super hoppy aspect that I was expecting may be common for American versions but maybe not for traditional Belgian ones, I don't know, I am going to have to try more real Belgian IPA's to figure out the difference. It seems like the American ones have a more noticable hop profile and the Belgian ones have a better and more complex backbone, either way I still think Raging Bitch is my favorite but this beer was good in it's own right. This beer made for a good first impression for this brewery and it has inspired me to seek out more beer from this Belgian brewery, good job guys this is one memorable beer."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with a one finger medium white head with moderate retention and nice lacing Aroma of light fruit, Belgian spices and a bit of caramel malt. Flavor follows with complex mixture of light fruit, caramel malt, coriander and clove, fairly sweet; spicing is reminiscent of a tripel. Finish is robust light fruit with a neutral, somewhat citrus hop kick. Medium to full creamy bodied with nice carbonation. Great mouthfeel. Very nicely done; complex with a nice progression of flavors. Sorry I waited so long to try this, the label looks like a lot of other middle-of-the road Belgians, but this is quite fine."
""
"Not really getting where the IPA part is coming from. That hop character seemed muted and was all about the malts and yeast."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a goblet. This pouted a dark golden color with a short lived white head. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, some funk, hops, alcohol, bread malts. The feel is medium light. The taste is pretty good, better than most Belgian ipas, good hop bite, nice malts, some funk."

"This is an outstanding masterpiece. The head on this beer is huge and impenetrable. Has a golden glassy color. Scents of classic Belgian yeasts, graininess, and clearness. Nice see through body with a golden color. No mistakes here. A bit hoppier than the usual belgians but in no way is this some ""Belgian IPA"". No way, more of a belgian golden ale. Very strong, not noticeable. A top shelf Belgian classic that many need to move towards!"
""
"O-definitely worth trying not sure if I would get it regularly but I will get one one occasin now the 10.5% alcohol if fairly well hidden"
""
"This is a damn good Hoppy Belgian that showcases its yeast. It's clear and hoppy at the same time. very good showcase of what a Belgian IPA should be. I've had several Belgian IPA's from the US, but this is the real deal. Use this as a benchmark against which to judge others."

"O: Drank this in my favorite Piraat snifter, had to enjoy the beer the glass was went to hold. A little too strong to be sessionable but the flavors and smell were very enjoyable - if I had a couple of these I would be in a bit of trouble due to the high ABV."
"O: Quite good for the ABV. I'm usually not a big fan of this ABV range, but this one holds it down. Solid, tasty, intense. Let it warm up, don't drink it too cold."

"World-class for the style. A Belgian on-tap 'must'."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. Appearance is a very dark yellow/orange with a finger of head that dissipates quickly and isn’t exactly pretty. Murky. Aroma is that of other Belgium strong ales, flowery, citrusy, yeasty, complex, and obviously sweet. Palate has a decent carbonation, and is very drinkable. Taste is amazingly complex. Masks the 10.5% very well, but there is still a warming alcohol burn. Spicy and not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Overall it’s a great beer that I’m glad I had the chance to try. I think it might have been too complex for me. It was still a great treat though."
""
"Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
"I've had this many times over the years, but I'm finally just getting around to reviewing it. Pours a slightly hazy bronze color with a firm white head, varying in size, but usually displaying decent retention and lacing. Aroma is grainy, with notes of Belgian sugar and yeast, moderately hoppy. Biscuity malts in the taste, yeasty, candi sugar and light spice, with an indistinct dark fruit sensation, and a lingering herbal bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, and quite drinkable for the style. Good beer overall."
"Overall this is nice. A little sweeter than I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
"Single finger thick head with a little lace and excellent retention on a hazy golden amber head. Nice candy, spice and fig aroma which isn't as strong as some others in the genre but still nice. Flavor is strong with a sour dark fruit, mostly cherry note dominating with a nice yeasty and spicey note as well. Very high carbonation a n medium bodied. This is a decent tripel. Not the best I have had. The carbonation was way too much for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I was expecting more to it though. It has some of the great Belgian yeast character and balanced bitterness, but it's almost ruined with the bite of alcohol. I probably would not buy this one again."
""
"Overall: A very good Belgian ale here. Packed with flavor and great balance of spice, sweetness, and bitterness."
"Poured a hazy golden brown with a couple fingers of white head. Good retention and lacing. Nose is spicy, some fruits esters, a bit of banana and big yeast notes. Taste is spicy as well, drying yeast notes, fleshy white fruits and a significant bitterness in the finish. Sweet malts with a chunk of alcohol for good measure; substantial heat from this. Medium high carbonation, chewy with a medium heavy feel. Pretty good, but doens't stand out. The flavour profile to alcohol content ratio is too low to thoroughly enjoy."
"This would be a lot better with less alcohol. Still pretty good flavors and decent carbonation to make it work."

"This was one of my favorites as I first got into belgian ales, but it was only available in 750 ml bottles which I found hard to handle. Then it came out in the 330 ml stubby format which I am enjoying now."

"Overall / Drinkability: I had this beer around 2003/2004 well before I knew what I was drinking and I could not stand it. It tasted like solid skunky bitter hops, so I'm beginning to think it was a bad bottle. But now I'm more educated and after trying it again, I can say it's good, but one is enough and I'm not sure I can see buying this again for the price. The mouthfeel is amazingly good, and the beer is nice to look at and inhale, but the taste...well the taste is something that is way too complex and difficult to tease out to my tastebuds. The alcohol is well hidden, but it's not a drinkable beer. I find that I sip and savor and once it's done I feel that I'm glad I tried it, but I need to wait another 5-10 years for my palate to get more educated before trying again. So overall - a good beer and I think there is more to this beer, but one per sitting is more than enough with this beer and I feel that maybe, just maybe, it's too much in a beer. Too much going on for it to be really just drank and enjoyed."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is just darn brilliant! I have never found an IPA I love or enjoy, but this is actually good. I am pleased with this, and I am inspired to give the style a second chance. The Belgians know beer, and this is one solid bit of evidence. Well worth your time and effort to seek out."
""
""
"I say Piraat is the best after pitting it against the elite for several years, and it's always the one I want to come back to. You may not proclaim its eminence after just one glass, but eventually, you'll be hooked."

""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
"Overall this is a great beer. I've always passed it up as I walk through the liquor store and I've never really known why. I'm thrilled to have picked it up tonight though. I've been thirsty for good Belgian ales this past year and I'm finding all the qualities I like to see in a beer of this type. Really a nice find."

"Pours from a bottle into a globe glass a caramel color with a nice white crown. Yeast and subtle malt in the nose. Nothing subtle about the taste. Warm malts and alcohol predominate, with wholesome cereal notes in back. Heavier in the mouth nicely balanced with carbonation."

""
""
""

"There is nothing quite like a good living beer. Poured into a tulip glass from a bomber, hues of a golden copper radiated from the glass. The larger head that emitted from the glass hint of a strong, but natural carbonation. Strong notes of banana attacked the nose with little effort to detect an aroma. The initial taste was very smooth. Going down easy, one could drink a lot of this before it catches up to them. Sour notes tickled the tongue with balanced hits of banana, sour apple, and perhaps a hint of citrus before a level of hoppiness becomes evident. At the same time, the alcohol warms on its way down which is a wonderful feeling on an autumn evening. The aftertaste brought to mind lemon flavor in sun tea with its unique tart bitterness coating the tongue. The final taste has some staying power which is not afraid to remind the drinker what a good beer this is."

"O: This is some potent stuff, to be sure. The alcohol is not well hidden at all, and can be distracting. Overall a decent brew, but I'm not sure it's worth the high price tag. Still, it is suitable for an occasional treat."

"Overall: I am not biased with any beers I first had this months ago at a restaurant with my g/f and was amazed. Piraat may not be for everybody but then again everybody is not a beer drinker. In NY this goes for roughly 14-18 dollars a 4 pack...WORTH every damn penny if you ask me. You haven't drank beer till you drank Piraat."

"An excellent beer in every aspect. The pour was great. With a nice head and initial aroma it tickled the senses before I even tasted it. The first sip was....what the hell is that, it's not beer....but after you let it settle for a second, and believe me that's all it will take, you want more. It had a nice fruity taste that almost reminded me of a cider. With a hint of citrus and bubbles. After the first few drinks I was hooked. And feeling good about almost everything. I think it may have been the 10.5% but I'll definitely have another."

"O - Solid belgian that I'd have again. Perfect with food and tame enough to be enjoyed by even a moderate beer drinker."

"Overall I could see the hype behind this being a slightly hoppy Belgium pale but I felt I would enjoy it more fresh from the source. Pretty good overall."

"A golden amber color, clear with a ginormous white mountain of white that gradually deflates to a thin cover with gobs of chunky lacing. The nose detects intense citrus clove and brandy-like alcohol that ends up bringing a super glue idea that is a bit stronger than I would like. A bit scary! The flavor is a nice flowery hop over intensely sweet grains and muted clove. This is medium-plus bodied with a near syrupy feel and just a tingle of carbonation that keeps this fairly drinkable. This brew is classic and satisfying, and mellows so nicely as you work through the pint."
"Light amber/orange colour, 1.5 finger white dense head, decent lace left behind. Smell is yeasty with citrus and spice, sweet candy notes, grassy, light alcohol, good hop profile overall. Taste is spicy followed by mild alcohol, lightly sweet at points, fairly hoppy, yeasty toward the finish with some citrusy sweetness, bubble gum notes come and go, well balanced. Med-carbonation, full body, good weight, alcohol makes this syrupy at points. Pretty drinkable, ABV pretty well hidden, pretty solid stuff."
"Overall, a pretty solid Belgian IPA. Can't compare to the best of them, but a nice beer all the same."
"O: A very enjoyable Belgian IPA that doesn't hide the ABV as well as some others do, but to me it works. It actually seemed more like a Belgian strong pale ale."
"O: I liked this beer but it is not distinctive in any one area. Pleasant, but too expensive for the end result."
"I tried this beer on tap at the Cheeky Monk in Denver from the appropriate glassware. A wonderful dark cherry color that is excellently clarified to provide a stark contrast to the bright white head that provides almost an impermeable cap to the beer. The foamy head actually hinders any aromas at first, but once the beer warms and the head mellows, you are left with a sweet cherry woodiness with almost no alcholic character. The flavor is also very smooth and compliments the nose with a rich cherry flavor with a dark maltiness that is more oaky then chocolatey. An all around excellent experience."
"D - Wow, this is a great beer. It has a nice complexity and an extremely pleasant flavor. I found the high alcohol to be well masked, lending nicely to it's drinkability. I'm digging the label too."
"O/D-Worth a try. Not my favorite. Definitely a cheek-warmer. At $3.99 a tiny bottle, the price is do-able. Wouldn't buy this again but was happy to try it."
"Overall – A great beer with a well balanced taste. It makes a great sipper and I'd definitely buy it again."
"It fits a niche, and deserves respect for it's avant garde approach, but it's not an exemplary ale by today's standards."
"The truth/bottom line....I didn't finish my bomber...I tried, but it went down the sink."
"O- this is a great BIPA very tasty easy to drink but youy will feel this one later"
"The idea of a Belgian IPA is a bit odd to me, particularly when made by Americans. This one seems to me between a tripel and quad, I guess. Not a ton of hoppiness or bitterness as expected in anything called IPA. The heavy flavor of spicy yeast and alcohol dominate. Cool beer if you're looking for something different, with a real wallop behind it. Can't see drinking more than 1 of even the small bottles."
"Overall: Piraat ale is very different from any IPA's I have had. It has the best of both worlds. Bitter and sweet. I love the bitterness at first sip then the sweet from every taste. Piraat ale is definitely among the top ranks of IPA's in my book. Cheers."
"Overall, this is a great beer! It really surprised me how much is going on in here, and how it maintained balance. I'll be picking it up again"
"The nose is quite hoppy with herbal notes, citrus yeast candy sugar and a boozey warmth. Malt, yeast hops and some lemon citrus, alcohol persists throughout. Has a medium body with high carbonation, very warm especially on the finish. Good beer, not great has original character just nothing fantastic about it, well worth a try."
"Fresh aromas and bitter Saaz hops. The mouth is very powerful and contrary to what one thinks, this is not the hop that brings that strength but alcohol, which is not really a good thing. The hop feel, of course, a slightly spicy, but it is overwhelmed by an alcohol too pervasive, mixed grain hereby makes the beer a little too heavy. Little aftertaste of almonds and finishing a warm mouth, almost suffocating. Damage to the power hop, that is, it must be said, almost absent."
"O: Well, delicious. I'm not a big fan of IPA`s to begin with but this was quite nice. Not one of my favorite but I think I'd like to have this from time to time. Pirates enjoyed, so did I. Van Steenberge, thank you."
"{revisited in Nov. 2013}"
"I liked this better than I expected, as I am not a fan of anything with IPA as a style. Not near as hopped up as the American IPAs I have tried, has more spice than bitterness. Not my favorite Belgian, but still not bad. The strength would keep me from drinking a lot of this, but glad I tried it."
"Final Thoughts: Obviously warming is a must on this one, but this beer wearies me on Belgian beer, specifically high alcohol Belgian beer. I really wish this was a 7-8% beer, because it's the wine like level of alcohol that is ruining this one, and many other Belgian's for me. It's just strikes me as one of those things that great when you do it right, but has just a small margin of error that many come in as just above average in my eyes. Oh well, give it a shot, you could certainly do worse."
"O: It was definatley something different. Not my usual style but well worth the try."
"-Overall 5.0: One of the best beers you will ever drink. Complex, compelling and delicious. There is a lot of history in the beer and every drop is telling you a story. Worth the hefty price tag ($12.99 for four). The jewel in the crown of the Steenberge brewery."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Soft copper orange in color with a yellowish hue. Poured with a brief, dense white head that reduced to a wispy cap. A plethora of aromas: banana, dark fruit, dark sugar, dark citrus. Different aromas seemed to pop up every time I lifted the glass. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly resinous feel. Citrus hop flavors, banana and belgian spice compete for flavor dominance. A solid sugary, fruit-like sweetness provides a solid back bone from beginning to end. Alcoholic heat shows through in the middle and intensifies toward the finish. Finishes with sweet but pine bitter hoppiness that doesn't linger for very long. Lots of aromas and flavors make this very enjoyable."
"overall i enjoyed this one. very tasty and flavorful, though nothing transcendent. will buy again."
"Poured a massive light custard yellow head which lasted longest I think I've ever seen (almost a merengue). Slightly hazy golden yellow body. Smells of malt. Taste is fairly sweet and fruity with a richness. Fairly long finish. This is from the same maker of Gulden Draak and in some ways this beer strikes me as a less concentrated version of that beer though they're probably unrelated in technique. Anyway, thoroughly enjoyable and in fact a better beer than I expected from the squat little bottle mine came in and the simple pirate reference of the label."
"M&D: rather moderate on carbonation, this full-bodied amber strong ale is very well hopped and features a delicious fruity malt theme as well. In fact, despite the unmistakable presence of alc., somehow my palate finds the nectar surprisingly easy to quaff, partially thanks to the rather low profile of candy-sugary elements. All in all, I think this is a well-balanced hoppy brew that definitely stands out as one of Van Steenberge’s premium ales."
"Overall, this is a first-class beer, and it's not hard to see why it's regularly rated among the top Trippels in the world."
"Overall, just a really terrific, and well-balanced Belgian IPA. Highly recommended for anyone just getting into the style."
"Overall Drinkability - Nice strong beer for when you're in the mood for a kick. The sum of this beer is better than the parts."
"O: A bit too sweet for me, but not bad overall, could use some complexity"
"O- a little too much booze in here for my tastes. there are better options for this style readily available year round. its still one to check out if you havnt yet."
"Rich and heavy-bodied, this is a superlative Belgian ale."
"O: This is delicious! It's the second time I've had this beer and I will definitely be going back to buy some more. If you enjoy Belgian styles then you owe it to yourself to pick up a bottle of this deliciously sweet brew."
"The beer pours out golden yellow in color with a sticky head which later gives way to some nice light lacing. The color is light but appetizing and it cleverly hides the high ABV. The aroma is what truly showcases the Belgian roots of the ale. You get wine-like fruity esters which are ever so slightly sour. The taste is yeasty, light hints of tropical fruits and cider, with a slightly hopped finish. This is an extremely drinkable beer and could really start one hell of a raucous night with its high ABV."
"D ~ Pleasing amount of hops for the style with a complex palette of spicy fruit makes this a really great beer. Seek out in single format, as it is a ""big"" beer."
"After reading all the reviews I expected a little more out of this ale...for me it was a little to sweet and it was tough to pick up the delicious bitterness of the hops. The color was little lighter than I like and the head broke apart quickly. It was very drinkable for a high alcohol ale but seemed a little too unbalanced towards the malt taste for my liking. Its a decent beer and I would drink it again...but only if someone else is buying."
"Skol!"
"Overall a very nice IPA, great summer beer, refreshing and a cleverly disguised strongly alcoholic beer. I would get this again."
"This is one of my favorite beers, and until this project I had no idea it was considered an IPA. I would call this a fruit beer… but of course, I am just saying that based on what I smell and taste in the glass. I love this brew, and can’t wait for our next bottle!"
"This beer pours out as a nice hazy golden yellow color. The head is bit a fluffy. The lacing it leaves behind isn't too bad. The smell of the beer has a good amount of hoppy aromas coming off of it. The other aromas are a little spicy and has some floral qualities. The taste of the beer brings all those qualities together in a very spicy flavored IPA. The aftertaste has some nice bread flavors also. The mouthfeel is a sharp and tingly. Overall it's a pretty good Belgian IPA. I still prefer the Valier Extra over this but this is still a worthy try."
"Gorgeous brickel golden amber colour, slightly cloudy, nice head of less than an inch with suds that drape the glass. Only complaint is that a bit more bite would make it perfect! Slight bitterness after a second glass tells my palate I need a tiny bit more..."
"Served in goblet glass at refrigerator temperature. Pours with slight head which dissipates into a thin lacing within a minute or so. The aroma is slight- heavily of sweet, somewhat spicy malt (not terribly cloying, though). The flavor is of a heavy malt which is just barely balanced by a subtly spicy hop flavor. The hop presence works but, for the pure flavor (rather than the style), I would have preferred a bit more bitterness to balance the big malt. (A judicious and slight addition of cascade would be sublime.) There's generally said to be a orange flavor but, if it's there, it's hidden by the malt. Given the double-digit alcohol count, it is surprising how little (if any) alcohol flavor is present. Would pair well with really spicy food."
"Drink- Another classic I finally got around too from back in the day. Didn't dissapoint. Ill come back to this one."
"This is a quality beer and I'd love to enjoy this over and over again."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice body with a great frothy head. Nose is basic, but denotes what you're in for well enough. Flavor is a really great balance of syrupy malt tones, subtle full hops, and a floral sweetness. Well-balanced and unique combination. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall: A good solid Belgian IPA, definitely worth a taste."
"O. Good combination of sweetness and clean finish. This is a solid Belgian! 4"
"O: By far the best beer from the sampler pack that I got. A good beer in it's own right and definitely worth buying on its own. It is well balanced, with the heavy alcohol that is present but not overly so."
"This is a very good beer and worthy of your attention, but don't plan on drinking more than one. It's pretty potent. If I had a hankering for something like this, I'd probably get a Duvel instead. Perhaps it's not the exact same style, but it has a lot of the same qualities and I think it tastes better."
"One of the best beers I've ever had, without a doubt. I hope this never changes—it's damn near perfect."
"O- This is definitely one of my favorites, and I've had it many times. Always enjoy this beer- check it out!"
"Has a medium body and some residual sugar that make it too sweet to be refreshing but a good beer to contrast nutty cheeses, sharp cheddars, or harmonize the sweet, or earthy ones. This would be great with Brie or goat’s cheese."
"Notes: It's a nice brew, but really not one for me. The acidic dryness is not my stuff, at least not here. As for the Belgian IPA denomination vs Golden Ale... Well, for my palate it falls most definitely on the Golden Ale side, now if hops or other ingredient matches the IPA range sure, file it under BIPA but the hop freshness, or its lingering memory associated with it, is not really there. Ah, and while good and despite the marketing this for me is clearly not one of the top 5 beers of the world..."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. It has a solid flavor and I will have to read up on it a bit more now as I feel pretty confident that there are some American ""C" hops in here. Overall, I like the dryness that you get from the Tripels over this, but this is still an excellent beer and I will enjoy drinking this 4-pack."
"O: Overall, I'd say it's an alright tripel or BSPA, but definitely not a Belgian IPA. Perhaps I need a fresher bottle, but the hops are almost nonexistent. As is, even if the hops had shown up the beer is too sticky sweet for me to give it a high score."
"O Decent beer but not hoppy enough for the style, thought there was too much yeasty esters and the alcohol could have come through a bit less."
"D - higher abv makes more than two a tough time but the taste says otherwise."
"I would definitely recommend this beer as one of my favorite beers to have with a meal, a snack or just on its own."
"D: Very smooth and enjoyable. I would drink several if not for the 10.5 abv. Not at all what I expected, but very good none the less."
"Aaargh matey!"
"All these factors led to a pretty high drinkability factor. I'll be buying a 6er of this next time I'm in the mood for sure."
"D - Trying to get a good read on this and I'm struggling. I hope this was just a bad bottle, but I am not very impressed with this Belgian."
"From the 330 ml. bottle marked 02FJ-14:18. Sampled on March 3, 2011. It pours a nice looking amber color with a decent head and hypnotic, upward trickling carbonation. Malts, hops, dough, and a hard to define fruit are all meshed into the aroma. The body is medium to full. The 10.5% ABV is well hidden in the taste but it leaves a memorable impression in my head. The finish is almost dry but not quite."
"this has become a favorite over the last year or so - there's no dating on the bottles - pours nicely with a hazed yellow/orange and puts up a fluffy 2-finger head that holds on for half a glass till it becomes a foamy film/ring, leaving behind spotty rings of lacing - smells of the belgian yeast, clove, along with some tropical fruit and herbal action - i guess i'm picking up the 'bananas in the beer' taste, along with a spicy 'zing' on the front of the tongue, peppery action as well and a sweet creamy finish where all the before mentioned flavors come together very nicely - each sip is very flavorful and begs for the next - good carbonation - the first glass has me warm behind the ears - a bomber of this stuff is just right for me."
"Pours a cloudy, dark, golden color with a medium-large white head that slowly goes down. Scent is floral, hoppy, yeasy, and fruity. Some scents of green apples and bananas. I also get some pear aromas with some spiciness and Belgian yeast. Taste is not what I was expecting...To me this tastes more like a triple of Belgian Strong Pale Ale than other Belgian IPAs I've had. There are some tasty Belgian yeast flavors with great spices and clove. Banana, green apples, and pear are definitely there. This beer finishes with some warm booziness and slight hoppiness. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and very dry. I like it! Drinkability is fairly high. It sure is tasty, but the booziness could probably become overwhelming after a couple of these."
"Pours a cloudy copper with about a finger of rich white head standing firm. Delicious aroma of rum-like spice, hops, and hints of fruits envelop the nose. Every drink fills the mouth with some carbonation and bitterness, but then turns creamy all the way through the swallow, ending with a warming, peppery finish. Surprisingly light for the 10.5% ABV. Reminiscent of an IPA mixed with a Belgian strong ale. I found it quite enjoyable--a great original brew from Brouwerij Van Steenberge."
"When drinking this imagine that you are a pirate. You'd want something light but full-bodied and have some kick in it too. This beer certainly does that."
"D- Yes sir."
"D: I was almost done with my glass before I realized that the bottle was practically gone. Flavorful and refreshing, this is definitely a beer where the alcohol will sneak up on you (not that's it's not evident in the taste, just incredibly easy to drink quickly). This is definitely one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had, I look forward to trying this fresh."
"Drinkability: I think this one is a bit too sweet for the style but good. I don't know if I'll look for more."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. On the stronger side for the style but this doesn't hinder drinkability too much."
"Piraat is one of my favorite beers of all time. I've had several of the 750mls over the last 2-3 years and I think they represent better than the small bottles. I have no problem at all giving it high marks."
"Still, a solid beer that I will have again."
"Drinkability is just good I would have this over a few other Belgians but I know I've had better. Could drink again no problem, but the high abv is real noticeable and does not make for easy drinkability."
"O- Pretty gangster. In the totem of Belgian IPAs, this isn't really on top... Hop-it and the Houblon have it crushed IMO. It still is wonderful though."
"Poured a nice golden yellow color with quite a bit of head. Very good smelling beer, not a real memorable flavor on the nose though. Good tasting with a bitter finish. Bit of an alcohol taste, but nothing like a malt liquor or anything. Good feel. I don't think I'd drink a ton of these beers, but I wouldn't mind having a couple in an evening."
"I haven't had this one in awhile and this particular bottle was so good, it reminds me of a tap beer. (I don't get it, but it's really working well right now.) I'm REALLY enjoying this beer in my tulip glass."
"Overall - This is a beer I would introduce to wine drinking friends. It's a strong, complex and tasteful beer, and it goes down smoothly for it's size."
"Very enjoyable beer. Definitely more on the sweeter side, not as bitter as I'd like.. but the flavors are spot on and I love the body of Piraat. It's worth trying."
"Don't know why Belgians think this style is ""hoppy"". It's way to sweet for that. Maybe I'm just an American, but this one's damn good. Gimme more"
"D: Quite a good beer, but not one of my favourites. I have had other Belgian IPAs that I found better, but this one is still recommended for devotees of the style. I probably won't be getting another one."
"D- Hides the 10.5 well. Thoroughly drinkable, albeit not as distinct as I'd like."
"A really solid brew. I just wish the alcohol were a little more balanced."
"Drinkability is good. This one would be a welcome addition to almost any time you've got a free hand and could use a beer in it."
"An easy to drink strong ale, lovely."
"On tap at Iron Horse in DC, but usually pours out from bottle to a dimple glass or snifter glass. Pours rich, golden yellow, and cheddary, with a nice head and beautiful lattice work. Aroma is a hint of sweet sage, followed by bread and citrus. Flavor is a sweet grapefruit a touch of bubblegum and perhaps bread. Palate is thick and chewy. Great Belgian that I order often at bars when available."
"Wow, whopping head, I was fast enough to not let any get away. Lace is plentiful and was not going anywhere. Color is a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is a cornucopia of berries and fruits, and malt. Taste is so complex, each sip brings something new. Cranberries, blueberry, raspberry, apple, orange, honey, spices. This is a kick your butt IPA, you are focusing on the flavor and all of a sudden the 10.5 ABV hits you, another Wow. Lots of body and creaminess in the mouth. A little too sweet and complex to drink several in succession, but one good beer."
"Drinkbilty - At 10.5% its not something you can drink 3-4 beers of. Im a sucker for strong beers and this did the trick. Really loved the flavor and kick it had. Not for the weak, this baby kicks."
"D: Overall, one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had. The hops don't overpower the flavor, and the drink overall is pretty sweet and refreshing."
"Overall, I think this is one of the best beers of Van Steenberge brewery, rich and tasty."
"11.2 oz into a snifter. It pours a rich dark golden color, fairly translucent, with a generous white fluffy head. Nose is hoppier than most big Belgians I've had...I guess why they call it a Belgian IPA. It's worth noting that the hop bitterness is nowhere near a big American IPA. The hops do not overpower the yeast or malt and it's well balanced. Great funkiness in the nose too, I really like their yeast strain. Taste is rich and deep, with a different gist at both the beginning and the end. In other words, fairly complex. Hard to believe this brewery has put out some other beers that I really didn't think were very good. This one is a winner and I'll drink it again."
"D- From the nose I wouldn't have expected this to be as bitter as it is but it packs a wallop. One I will buy again no doubt."
"Drinkability: Very nice brew. I am eager to crack open and savor another bottle."
"Not a bad beverage by any means. Good representation of the style. It's pretty easy to find in my parts, so I'll certainly have to pick this one up a bit more often."
"D: basically your classic Belgian ale. I'm not sure if I would classify it as an IPA as it's not all that hoppy, but it's perfectly fine. Gotta to love the 10.5% though. I definitely think I would buy this again."
"Overall, Piraat is a nice beer, with a few caveats. If its brewers were trying to create an IPA, however, they really missed the mark, as the only hops to be found in this brew are of the finishing variety and do not play a big role in the taste. Regardless, this is a good BSPA and I've certainly enjoyed this bottle."
"D: This is an interesting beer. It even changes throughout the tasting. This is probably because of the strong alcohol content. After drinking most of the brew, the alcohol becomes less present and other flavors dominate the palate. The initial flavor is a major turnoff, tons of alcohol and some strange off flavors (muffins and spaghetti). This is not a brew I'm going to search for in the future."
"I'm revisiting by accident, as I'd forgotten that I'd had this beer. This is clearly a fresher sample as the nose is hoppier with a nice dusty Styrian Golding hop character that rides over the citrus and the spice. Some bubblegum is present too. However, as it warms up, the sweetness and honey and booze take over. The palate is spicy and phenolic, fairly sharp, with a grassy snap to go with the extremely expressive yeast. Way over-carbonated, this beer is fairly drying on the finish. While well crafted, this beer isn't realyl for my palate, and so, I'm letting my scores stand."
"High level of carbonation. A hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Superb offering."
"D - I know it's high ABV. I just can't help it. Easy speasy."
"drinkability; very drinkable, just the high abv. lets its effects be known."
"D: The mouthfeel makes this beer crazy drinkable. Certain wine like characteristics in the flavor and the mouthfeel really make this a dangerous beer."
"Overall a pretty good Belgian ale. The booze is more prevalent as the beer warms, but it's still a great beer"
"D - Good. However, for a Belgian IPA this lacks many components I would have expected."
"Very glad to have tried this Ale. Felt more like a tripel in many respects. An excellent Ale choice that I will revisit again & again!"
"Perhaps not a Belgian IPA and perhaps a little on the boozy side, especially initially, but at 10.5% we can be a little forgiving. This is a finely crafted beer that, despite my overall hesitancy with tripels, I would enjoy having regular access to."
"This isn't horrible, but the off-flavors take what could have been a good beer and kinda kill it. I wouldn't toss it away, but I'm not inclined to purchase it again either."
"O: Good, but not great. Gulden Draak remains my favorite from this brewery."
"To this day, this is the best beer I've ever had. And I got it at $9.49 + tax-deposit, a steal for quality stuff like this."
"Nice and creamy mouthfeel. It is slightly warming on the finish, but still hides its ABV pretty well. The hops provide a pleasant change to the expected belgian ale flavours, I just wish they provided a bit more bitterness as well. This has been one of my favourites out of the mixed sixer so far; the grassy/citrus hop flavours work well with the other characteristics of the beer."
"D- Very drinkable. The 10.5% is hard to notice at all. Very little alcohol heat. This beer would be one of the easiest I've seen to lose track of and get messed up. Goes down nice and easy, a bit more than it should for the alcohol. It's a good beer and I'd recommend anybody trying it."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/11/09/tasting-the-piraat/"
"A bold Belgian IPA that starves for attention. This is a stand out beer for sure. Now matter how many times you drink it, you can't help yourself from saying, ""Arrrgghh!"" after the first sip. I wouldn't recommend taking big gulps of this bad boy."
"D: Very drinkable, and I'm quite certain that I will be adding this to my ""to buy again"" list."
"Purchased as part of a brewery 6 bottle pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Really nice head retention with lots of lacing. Smells of alcohol, Belgian yeast, banana and hop oil. Flavour has a nice bitterness, with some dry sweetness. Taste does have a definite alcohol kick to it. Good carbonation level. Maybe not my favourite Belgian IPA, but it is up there. Really nice beer."
"Drinkability: A pronounced style, suitable for sipping. My wife calls it a 'lounge beer.' Complex, but with a little too much alchohol burn and heavy, earthy dryness. I would have another, although probably not in one sitting."
"Medium body and light carbonation. The high ABV precludes this as a session beer, although the alcohol is fairly well hidden. It doesn't seem much like an IPA, more like a hopped triple or strong pale ale. Well balanced and interesting."
"Overall impression: a mix of hops, citrus and Belgian spices, this is a good beer. not a session beer by any means."
"Balanced, smooth, and nicely flavored. You can't go wrong."
"Pours a golden amber brew with its medium creamy crown. Thick foggy body, good carbonation. Very pleasant on the nose with some wheat malts, hops, fruits and floral hints. The palate its dominated by the hops amd the sweet malts ending in a sweet bitter, dryish and sour aftertaste that lingers on for a while. No alcohol taste which is very well hidden and that comes out full force as the brew warms up. Very refreshing with nice drinkability despite its respectable 10.50%abv."
"Good beer which calls for more because of the great aftertaste."
"It was a good beer. Beautiful aroma and drinkable, especially for the high ABV."
"In the end I enjoyed this beer and found it very flavorful and drinkable for the ABV. Though, I'm not sure how this is an IPA."
"I could see this as a Belgian IPA, but a hopped pale does seem more fitting. Fairly easy drinker, 1 was plenty. Having seen this around stores often, I was pleasantly surprised, and I may pick some bottles up."
"Overall, although this beer reminds me of a triple, I like it a whole lot. From the lacing to the mouthfeel, Piraat Ale is a solid sipper. Has anyone tried aging this one with positive results?"
"D-taste stays and amazingly the abv does not hit as quickly as one would think. all in all this is a pretty decent sipper."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Delicious flavor. I'm not really familiar with Belgian IPAs so I'm not sure if this is typical of the style but it doesn't feel like what I expect from an IPA. Not necessarily a bad thing. This is delicious. I recommend trying it out."
"D - very drinkable considering the abv."
"Only a sipper after the first few swigs, the alcohol creeps up and lets you know it is 10.5 percent. Complexities don't follow the same path and some flavors are pulled to their ends. All in all, still a very tasty treat."
"D-For what it is,this beer is extremely drinkable but not an exceptional brew overall."
"Nothing lingers too long in the aftertaste, and it is a bit strong to be drinking all night, and it may lose points on originality. But for a hearty, manly beer that gets it all done right: I'm going to go to this one regularly."
"While strong at 10% it is a light beer that you can easily have a few glasses of."
"D- Really strong beer in terms of abv and flavor profile; a great beer all-around though."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel is great, but the flavor profile never really pops. The flavors just seem to melt together as opposed to forming a strong identity. This also does not have quite the hop presence for me to consider this a real Belgian IPA."
"D: A very delicious light flavor. Even though I loved this beer, I don't see myself buying this a lot for reasons I can't explain."
"Had this on tap in a tulip glass at Cafe Centraal in Milwaukee. Poured a nice golden color with large creamy head. Citrus Fruit/Coriander aromas abound. This beer tastes nothing like an IPA even though it is labeled as one. It's more representative of a Belgian Trippel. When I think of a Belgian IPA I think of LeChouffe as a prime example. This beer should be classified as a Trippel. Very high alcohol content which can be tasted, but the fruit aromas and fresh spices balance it out. Definitely has a sweet syrupy/bready aftertaste on the mouthfeel that lingers for awhile. This is a very drinkable beer with lots of nice spicy/fruit flavors. The alcohol is there, but you would never guess that it is 10.5% ABV. Even on a hot summer day when most pepole reach for a fresh Weiss Beer or Pilsner this beer was enjoyable."
"(Reviewed from notes)"
"I was surprised to see here that it's a 10.5% beer - it didn't taste anything like that. If you like the standard Belgian tripel beers, this is a good example and a tasty beer, but don't order it looking for an IPA."
"11.2 oz/ 330ml bottle. Pours a apple juice color amber with a foamy one finger head that I find surprisingly small for a Belgian Ale. The typical heavy Belgian carbonation is present. Aroma is very sweet and apple juice-like as well. Also, there is a slightly doughy yeast aroma in the background. 1st sip brings an initial surge of sweet fruit (apples, apricots), which gives way to a dry, spicy, peppery finish. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpoweringly so. It's a little thick on the tongue, with a sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is good, but I wouldn't call this a session beer due to the high abv. 2 or 3 slowly sipped over the course of an evening should do for me! Overall, a good beer...not the best Belgian i've ever had, but certainly good enough to make me want to purchase more!"
"an update much later - I've now had one that was served far too cold and the hops are much more pronounced. Now it tastes like a somewhat hoppy tripel :)"
"Tasty and approachable for what it is, even then it doesn't really rock me as much as most people seem to feel about it."
"This is a high ABV beverage. It has all the characteristics of these types of brews. It has a dark golden hue, a rich, frothy head, plenty of carbonated bubbles and an intense taste. You can definitely taste the sugar in this beer as it is almost too sweet. this is a sipping beer meant for special occasions."
"I am not sure of the age of this, and wonder if this is not as fresh as possible."
"Drinkability: More like a hoppy BSPA than a Belgian IPA, but I would not argue with the classification - this beer was just not to my liking as I didn't care for the boozy bitterness"
"Just an awesome beer. I always enjoy this one."
"Great fruity taste to it with a nice level of tartness to combat the sweetness. So many layers of flavor in this beer from the candied sugar and caramel maltiness to the fruits like apple and banana to the spicy flavor from the yeast. There is some warmth from the alcohol but @ 10.5% that isn't really a shocker. This is a beer that makes me pause and reflect on why I love beer so much and dedicate so much time and money to beer."
"Still rackin' my brain tryin' to figure out what this beer's name means... Stupid foreign names! Anyway, it pours a clear golden amber topped by a stoic bit of white froth that eventually succumbs to the deleterious effects of gravity, leaving only bubbly rubble in its once proud place. The nose comprises hoppy florals, orange peel, and a touch o' that lovely Belgian spicy quality. The taste ups the spice ante a bit, focusing on pepper and cardamom, while still maintaining a firm presence of hoppy citrus bitters and a Belgian farmhouse-like yeastiness. The body is a very light medium, with a light-active carbonation and a finish that really wants to be crisp and dry-ish. Overall, a steady, solid Belgian offering. 'Nuff said."
"A very nice beer, try it sometime!"
"There is both a 10.5% and a 9% version of this beer. 330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9%. Extremely pale yellow colour, huge white head. Strong sweetish aroma with notes of Belgian yeast, ripe fruits (incl. bananas) and spices (incl. cloves). The flavour is moderately spicy and relatively dry, notes of Belgian yeast again, very light bodied and refreshing for its strength (which means that the alcohol is well hidden). Nice, but I've had more complex Belgians than this one, though."
"At Eulogy Tavern in Philadelphia. Poured cloudy golden with one finger of bright white head, which collapsed fairly quickly, and laced modestly. Lots of candi sugar, yeast, coriander, orange peel, and some other citrus in the nose. The flavor yield copious amounts of apricot in addition to what was detected in the aroma..admittedly a robust and tasty mix..but the finish revealed a sharp alcohol bite and after-burn. The body was smooth, medium and pleasant (aside from the after-burn), with only a modest amount of carbonation. A pleasant albeit harsh-finish beer to drink; beware the alcohol."
"D = Delicious but heavy and hot enough to be quite pleased with one and done."
"Drinkability: Awesome beer. Give it a try; You'll like it."
"D - I did not realize this clocked in at 10% and it's pretty evident...the tripel (Belgian) flavors were real nice but the IPA characteristics were put towards the back"
"overall: little or no hops in this BIPA very malty and a decent triple but does not conform to style"
"Quite nice and heavily Belgian despite the Americanized style."
"IMHO this is a very under appericiated style, and one of my favorites. This beer sets the bar. Hop-tacular and very refreshing. I highly recommend this especially on a hot day such as this."
"The taste is sweet, with all the flavors present that I listed for the aroma. The alcohol is well hidden for 10.5%. Medium bodied, well carbonated, and smooth. A nice Belgian IPA which reminds me a lot of a BSPA."
"**Update-- the ABV is legit. I only had one glass and I am feeling it."
"a MUST have brew after any cyclocross race this fall. heck, after any bike ride. put a couple in the creek...make sure they're hidden!"
"I am very surprised how a 10,5% alcohol beer can be so light tasting. It tastes as light as a German pilsener. You can get drunk with this very quickly, so better drink slowly."
"Drinkability: The 10% abv is dangerously hidden. Damn good brew. So easy to drink."
"D - Enjoyable but I think some more malt flavors and/or body would help. The hops are not harsh, but almost stand out too much and don't seem quite balanced with the rest of the beer. Still very good."
"Summary - Piraat to me is Mr. Tripel having a child with Mrs. IPA. The balance of flavors is great in this beer. The 330ml bottle doesn't taste as good as the bigger 750ml or on tap though. Overall, this is one of my favorites."
"I'll definitely buy this one again."
"Drinkability -- A lot of great malty flavors with enough hoppiness and spice to keep it balanced and drinkable. The booze bites on this one, which I don't typically like, but it really compliments the spiciness - or is it the other way around?"
"D: An interesting beer. The sweetness make me want to drink faster, but the ABV, which is not disguised well, makes it a bit boozy."
"Drinkability-I shared this bottle but I'd have had no problem finishing it off by myself, I could have had another to be honest; it's damn drinkable."
"D-I'm still confused by this style; I've had a few versions of belgian ipa and they vary so much from beer to beer; this version is definitely nice and refreshing; it's a bit spicy and the carbonation might be a bit much for some; 10.5% i believe, is noticeable at the end of the sip"
"Taste/Drinkability/Mouthfeel: Sweet and delicious! The taste is bready and sweet, balanced by light citrusy hops in the background. The finish is pleasant though there is little heat and a lasting mouth-coating. The carbonation level is medium-high, which is probably responsible for its fluffy texture on the palate. It also helps lighten the body and certainly boost drinkability."
"This is a high gravity BIPA, perhaps it is a bit too malty, if you love Belgian strong pale ales this one is for you."
"D - Just fantastic. After a few sips it takes a little getting used to since it's so unique, but it really comes through and gets very enjoyable. A solid beer that's fantastic and getting me nice and saucy while listening to a quality vinyl."
"D: One snifter for me, thanks. The ale is too boozy and needs to add a little more hop oomph."
"Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden-orange. Nice thick white foam head. Aroma and taste are sweet at first - honey-ish malt character followed up nicely by lemony & peppery hop bitterness. Very good all around. Mouthfeel is of a typical Belgian IPA - nice subtle carbonation. WAY too easy to drink for an ale of 10.5% abv. Oh well, I'm not complaining - give me two more and I'll be ready to take a nice long nap."
"Overall a tasty user friendly ale."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rich, thick and gives a bit of a bite on the end. Carbonation is heavy but doesn't negatively affect flavor. This is drinkable only because the bite at the end makes the mouth want the next flavor. This isn't a beer you drink two of."
"D- Its drinkable but watch out or your ass will hit the floor. Excellent Belgian Ipa, Triple and Strong Pale Ale... in one."
"I will for sure be buying this again. Very exciting style of beer for me as I love both Belgians and IPAs and this was possibly the best one I've had. My next batch of homebrew just might be a Belgian IPA."
"drinkability: good"
"D: This was a surprising little beer that I bought on a whim. The flavor is definitely heavier and bolder than one would think from looking at it. Flavors are bold yet refreshing and crisp. Pick one up, you won't be disappointed."
"Had a glass of this today and was told it was a belgian pale. I immediately knew it wasn't that but I also would have never guessed an IPA. It definitely wasn't hoppy enough for that but I did enjoy it. Good pale golden color, light colored head, clean but belgian-y flavor. I would recommend it."
"D: It's relatively easy to drink and the taste of alcohol is well-hidden, but I can't see having more than one of these in a sitting given its high alcohol content."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Belgians aren't typically my beer of choice, but this one is pretty quaffable. Would definitely drink again, but due to the price, I'd prefer that I wasn't the one paying for it :)"
"I'm looking forward to drinking this one again!"
" Could drink a lot of this, Very nice brew."
"D: A sipper for sure, would make a nice warming after dinner brew. One of the first Belgians I ever tried, I'm glad I revisited it."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smell is of fruits and alcohol. Taste is of overpowering alcohol with just a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is definatly not a session drinking beer. Overall I found this to be a mediocre offering."
"I loved this beer when I tried it a few years ago and it's still really really good."
"Drinkability:I want to say 5 because a beer like this you want more of it, but the 10.5% I am only drinking two for the night. It is a sipping experience that you will enjoy."
"Notes- Its a nice mood setter."
"Overall: The sweetness and candy character take away from the drinkability. I've had this beer a few times before and this bottle doesn't resonate with my memories. Could be this bottle was oxidized or old. If it always tasted like this, I wouldn't buy it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy."
"Light carbonation bite on the palate, medium mouthfeel -- just perfect for this beer. Highly drinkable, although it has caught up to me a bit (alcohol-wise). But I was sipping and all of a sudden, the pint was empty -- a good sign. Try this."
"The body was good, smooth and full, without being heavy or sticky. Drinkability was very good for brew of this strength. Overall, a very good beer that is worth your time."
"D - a tasty treat for once in a while."
"Poured into a chalice. It has a nice clear yellowy golden color. The head on the pour was barely half a finger. It was less than I expected and the carbonation appears to be much lower than most Belgian beers I have had. The aroma has the standard Belgian sweetness to it of light fruits. A slight hop presence is noted as well. This has a very smooth nice flavor. The sweetness is much mellower than I was expecting. On the front the sip the sugary sweetness presents itself with perfect balance. The sweetness fades quickly to a light crisp hop bitterness that leaves an incredible finish. This is definitely probably my favorite Belgian beer. I tend to not like them because I feel many are overly sweet for my tastes. This beer will definitely make me look more into the Belgian IPA category."
"D: Moderately drinkable, but a sipper not a quaffer. A bit too sweet, a bit cloying and not carbonated enough. Still, much better than I had originally found when I first tried it. A different interpretation of a tripel with the addition of some IPA qualities, it's sure to appeal to those beer drinkers who like their hops but also want their brew to taste somewhat sweet. Does need to be a bit more balanced, however."
"I was surprised by this beer, I don't think Belgian IPA when I drink it but what do I know. what do I know you ask? this is a great deal at 2.50$ a bottle this will be in front of me again soon"
"D - ABV is very masked and this ale is very drinkable and tasty. Definitely want to have more of this in the future."
"drinkability is good - this breer might sneak up on @10.5%"
"D: far too easy to drink for a 10.5% beer. The alcohol is hidden well in bottled versions, but is even more elusive on draft. I could drink this beer all night long and never look back. Highly recommended."
"(Bottle into tulip) Poured a cloudy dark amber / light orange with a large head the hung around for the entire glass. Nose was of slight citrus, with a little caramel sweetness and a hint of banana. The taste was not disappointing as all of these came through in the mouth, enhanced by the jumpy carbonation which also brought forward a nice spicy bite at the end. This helped for a very nice finish. Be wary as the 10.5% could catch up with you! Unfortunately I only had one, as this was part of a brewer's sampler."
"Definitely a unique ale and worth trying again, and again, and again..."
"great ipa, Belgian style is very apparent, which i enjoy. I also enjoyed stones cali belgique, which is very similar."
"This marks my first Belgian IPA and definitely not my last. Unlike the American IPA's I've grown to love which place a great emphasis on tropical fruits and resiny hops, this one's more focused on the Belgian yeast and spicy aspects of the beer which wonderfully disguise the very high ABV as well as highlighting why this brew has its own style."
"Highly drinkable with a nice balance. This is definitely an easily quaffable beer that I could definitely have multiples in a session, although someone would have to carry me home!"
"I had a small bottle but a big bottle could of been tacklrd as well, although the 10.5% is a bit high, espicially for a Belgian IPA. I don't think I've ever heard of something in this style with that type of alcohol. Either way it masks the alc very well. This will leave you tipsy because it's easy to drink, the sign of good beer. Will try this as fresh as possible next time and revise this."
"This beer was a nice surprize to me as it was bought on a curious impulse!"
"Overall, not a bad Belgian IPA. I would not categorize this as so, but thats not my call. I graded it as a Belgian Pale Ale, and it's a good one at that."
"Drinkability: A good sipping beer. Interesting flavors and a nice drink overall. My first Belgian IPA, and this is a style I want to look more into."
"Drinkability: An excellent and very intriguing beer. I'm honestly not quite sure what to make of this one. The Belgian IPA style is certainly complex and interesting. I'll certainly look for more in this style."
"Although it doesn't have a particularly alcholic taste (maybe that is contributing to the bitterness?), it's 10% abv is nothing to sneeze at, which is to say, I shouldn't drink more than 1 of these at a sitting"
"I love beers with with allusions to pirates. They are invariably more complex than IPAs and in the same, happy, high alcohol vein."
"Notes: Very interesting and wonderful. Amazingly drinkable too"
"I like this a lot and will buy again."
"This one certainly packs a punch and is light and smooth enough to sneak up on you. Not my preferred style, but a very solid brew that I will undoubtedly go back to at some point. One of the better Belgians I've tried, as the ratings suggested it would be."
"Medium bodied and finely carbonated; feels round and soft. An exceptional beer showing great depth of flavour. I enjoyed this one a lot."
"Mouthfeel, alcohol dominates again, throughout. Not very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel - A medium body with average carbonation."
"Feels alright and light in the mouth, okay carbonation but nothing special."
"D: A very good beer, but I don't know if I would have recognized it as a Belgian IPA; mind you, I've never had this style before, and I would expect their IPAs to be less in-your-face then many in North America."
"D-Decent, but not easy to drink. This is the first big beer I've had in a while, so I might have lost my taste for them."
"I don't think I've tasted anything out of Belgium before that didn't have a musty aroma or a taste that reminded me of a monestary, or place of worship. This is a first. A pretty cool beer...definitely unique."
"Poured a 11.2oz stubby into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a golden straw with a 2inch white head that leaves lacing that reminds me of Lorianne Swiss cheese. Odd mental picture but that's the one drawn for me. The aroma reminds me of most BSPA's. Sweet pears and apples, a bit of hops and a bit of Belgian candy sugar. I really wish the hops were a little more prevalent in the nose but they really play second fiddle to the malt that's used to push the alcohol up to 10.5%. The flavor is almost exactly the same. Orchard fruits, big malty sweetness, with just a bit of hops at the tail. I think that if this beer wasnt so sweet, the booze would be almost untouchable. It still shows it head but its mostly covered by the big malt body to this beer. The mouthfeel is rather syrupy. The carbonation is light leading to the syrupy body. All and All, I'm not really impressed with this beer. i wonder if maybe this is an older bottle. I'll definitely be trying to get a fresher bottle and will re review."
"D - Hell yeah I'll drink it."
"The mouthfeel is wonderful, sparkling and bright, almost refreshing. This is so easy drinking its scary. It would be very easy for me to have one too many of this beer. Just a great representation of the style. So delicious and the alcohol only shows itself via a slight warming effect."
"Creamy, bitter, and mild carbonation in the mouthfeel. Good taste, but packs a punch with heat and hops."
"When I first began to delve into craft beers, I avoided Piraat for several month, probably still would if it hadn't come in a Belgian holiday sampler pack. My mistake. Piraat is excellent, though in a different way from other Belgians."
"Found the tastes as in the aroma and also some minerals. Citric grapefruit in the semi-dry bitter aftertaste. Lots of hops here but the flavours are not overpowering ...and the ABV is dangerously well hidden."
"Drinkability: I can really feel the high abv here, so this is a one per sitting beer.. The flavors are good, if not slightly muted due to the alcohol. I will most likely not search for this again."
"Overall enjoyable enough, but perhaps just a tad too much alcohol in the taste for me."
"mouth - very inviting open with a mouthfull of hop bite....defenitly a high recomendation!!"
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a faintly yellowish stained creamy head. It doesn't retain it's fluffy finger plus head appearance long but quickly fades back to just a thin film across the top of the beer with a monsterous amount of lace all over the glass. Nose is slightly spicy from the hops and filled with a mixture of cloves and a bit of malt sweetness. Taste is a little bitter and has clove character in the front but it blends out to a complex mixture of grain, yeast, malt and alcohol. Slightly bitter dry finish with a lingering taste of hops left on the palate. Finish is also a bit warming which is the only indicator of the higher than usual alcohol. Light feel and carb. 10.5 alcohol makes this beer dangerous because of how easily drinkable and enjoyable it is. I will certainly be seeking this one out again."
"D - A very enjoyable Belgian IPA... Slightly rough around the edges and not as smooth bell weathers for the category... I would gladly welcome the chance to revisit and certainly not shy away from in the future... The alcohol also makes no attempt to hide itself... All that being said, this one was easy to go down and still gone before I know it... It's still a very good brew, just not head of the class as far as Belgian IPAs go..."
"This really is a quite good beer. I'd happily buy it again, especially since it's so available."
"This is a Belgian IPA, and for my tastes it's a bit too much Belgium and not enough IPA. I feel this would be better if the hops were heavier, but it is certainly a good beverage by any measure. I'm not sure if it's worth the pricetag per bottle, but I'm glad I tried it and will likely return to Piraat in the future."
"D: I was excited to try this, but I have to admit I am a little underwhelmed. The malt profile is too thin here, and the alcohol seems to take too much of a front seat for my taste. Still, an interesting Belgian that is worth trying."
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, slight sweet malt, alcohol, nuttiness, caramel, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, alcohol, citrus, and slight brown sugar. Overall, a great blend, body, aroma, and drinnkability."
"Picked one up on a random at the local beer distributing establishment. Pirate, brewed in Tampa? No its brewed in Belgium. So let's give it a whirl. This one is in a slightly more Belgian looking bottle than in the pic above, but glass is glass, so let's give it a whirl. The bottle smell of this brew has a distinct Belgian whiff, heavy malts, spices, smells like a HG brew. Pouring into a stemless wine glass yields a fizzy golden brew that has a head that disappears quickly but continues to fizz like a champ. Mouthfeel first, got any pancakes? This is one thick brew. All joking aside, the taste of this brew is a complex malt with slight spice undertones and a sweet yet dry bitterness that leaves a bready finish with hints of yeast. Most definitely warms through the AC almost like a fine sherry but better as a brew. This is one big beer. Great malt and yeast combo, almost weiss-like, but much heavier."
"Edit: I didn't realize there's actually a category of Belgian IPA (and this is in it)! That's exactly what I would've called it... either Belgian IPA or Hoppy Tripel. Very appropriate, a new niche in the world of beer."
"(10-2010. I've had several more tastings of this beer. The quality of the product seems to vary: sometimes it's a sublime ipa, sometimes it's strong alcoholic lager taste.)"
"Drinkability: At first I wasn't quite sure what to make of this beer as it wasn't quite what I was expecting. But the more I had of it the better I liked it. This beer is dangerously drinkable. I'll certainly be having this one again and would be quite happy to have more than one a night if it were not for the ABV level."
"D: does not taste hoppy like IPa ( good), I love this beer I could drink this everyday."
"Nice one!"
"D- Overall I would say this BIPA is not bad but like most, I think there should be more hops. I wouldn't mind having this again but the price is a bit steep."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied with good carbonation."
"This is great. Lots of complexities. Something I would highly recommend."
"the flavors are so melded and blended they're even harder to distinguish than in the aromatics. suffice it to say this a smooth operator and carries its 10.5% better than most BBWs. the balance is nice, though there isn't really a wow factor to be found. the body is medium full, with moderate co2, slick and easygoing. finish is a little sweet but with enough mild spiciness and twang to even it out. worth having again."
"D- very smooth and drinkable for a 10.5% abv. will be getting this one again"
"Although not a session beer, this is a fine belgian india pale ale with plenty of well hidden alcohol and character. Afternoon delight."
"The carbonation could be toned down some. For such a high ABV, the alcohol is well masked. This still doesn't help the drinkability for me, as I still find the aftertaste a bit of a downfall for this beer."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a crisp pale orange with a decent off-white head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent blend of Earthy citrus hops and mild spice. The taste is a nice balance of sweet malts, spices and a nice lingering hop bitterness. The beer is somewhat heavy, but a decent sipper. This one is enjoyable, but it looses a bit on tap, as most Belgian beers do."
"Drinkability: Oh yes, this is a very drinkable beer that would be easy to session. I love it, and will definitely seek it out again."
"Finish is soft and yeasty, with a little bit of bread and a little bit of bite. Crisp, but very smooth and the alcohol holds its grip to the end. There is a bit of unwarranted tangyness, but its impact is minimal. Overall, a very drinkable, very smooth, and remarkably complex beer."
"This reminds me a lot of Christoffel blonde, mostly because of its grainy character and saaz-like hopping. Its not quite what I expected from a Belgian IPA."
"I begining to wonder if the sampler pack from the brewery is not of highest quality. This is about the 3rd beer from the set that didnt live up to expectations."
"Conclusion: I was really hoping to be wowed by this, but...I just wasn't."
"Might be too sweet & warm for mass consumption. But I'm sure it's good."
"Surprisingly mild flavor given the style and ABV, with subtle hints of floral, grassy hops and some banana-rich yeast esters in the middle. Finishes with a tinge of alcohol that suggests a tropical-flavored spirit. Body is bubbly and lighter on the palate than I had anticipated, as the spritziness draws out some of the more subtle hop notes. Crisp, clean finish with a slight linger of booze and grass. Not the most remarkable Belgian IPA, and the 10.5% certainly limits its drinkability, but Piraat makes a nice sipper for those slower evenings."
"Drinkability: I can only say that this is way too drinkable for a 10.5% beer. I'll definitely be getting this one some more."
"Pours a clear golden color, not too much head to speak of. Aroma is surprising hoppy, some distinct spice notes (clove? coriander?) and pine. Taste is quite sharp, much more bitter than I expected. Nice punch from the hops, some mild malt flavor, mostly spicy yeast. Alcohol is quite hidden. Wonderful belgian body to, really quite good. Extremely easy drinking, highly enjoyable."
"this is good belgium ipa that i reccomend to everybody anyone who enjoys beer should like this style of ale even my wife dug it!! and it kicks ass weighing in at 10.5% mmm try some if you getthe chance a lil pricey but worth the money xxx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx"
"Silky champagne-like flavor, taste is sweet, some spices, clove, coriander, fruits, but not as distinctive as in the aroma."
"It's fairly thin on the mouthfeel; good amount of carbonation. Nice and creamy. This is very drinkable considering the abv. Doesn't become any harder to drink as it warms. Good beer."
"All in all this makes for a nice warming beer but I can't say the taste was all that impressive. In a sea of excellent Belgian tripels I'll probably spend my bounty elsewhere next time."
"I'm not a fan of this one and won't finish the bottle. Funny thing, but 'mericans seem to hit Belgian styles a lot better than Belgians hit 'merican styles. Know what I mean?"
"Drinkability: very nice, I didn;t really like the smell but it warmed nice and mild even with the alcohol."
"[MR;tap-y]"
"I would love to try this from a bottle, as I think it might be a completely different experience. The lower drinkability score stems from the high alcohol. Not a session by any stretch, but a lovely way to pass the day regardless."
"This beer came in a 330ml bottle that looks very similar to the Duvel bottle and it pours a orange mahogany hue with decent carbonation that forms a one finger cream coloured head with heaps of visible lacing down the sides of the glass,it actually smells quite subtle for a beer that is 10.5% it has nice aromas of malt,candy,yeast and a faint alcohol background,it has a nice full mouthfeel yet is light in body and the alcohol is well hidden,it has nice tastes of bread,malt,dough and candy and finishes quite easy actually no hint of overwhelming alcohol still cant believe this is 10.5% more like 5%,a very nice beer that would recommend."
"D: Still rather drinkable for such a large beer, though this bottle is inferior to the draft version I had a week or so ago."
"Served out of a bottle into a goblet. Golden in color, relatively clear, moderate head. Smell was lighter than expected, but still present and pleasant. Mouth feel was full bodied and easy to drink. I haven't had this beer in a while, and it was my fourth of the night. It was as good as I remembered and I am thrilled to recommend this beer to those Belgian fans out there, of which there are millions."
"Tastes like a really strong, belgian-ized braggot. It is unique and quite good, but it is not my favourite belgian. And I really don't get the whole ""IPA"" thing this beer supposedly has."
"The 10+ booze in this one does not even make a statement. Crisp, light bodied, easy drinking triple makes this a must on your try list"
"Light amber color with a foam head that is an ""off-white"" and about 1 or 2 cm in thickness, but I am at a bar and don't exactly have a ruler. The nose is faint, but is malty and has some touches of grain that promise some turns in the flavor other than from whatever hops is hidden in there. There is a sweet and fruity sensation to the attack. The flavor is candy like in its sweetness. A little bit boozy and some grain notes at the finish. This warms in the belly as you finish it. The mouthfeel appears to thicken during the flavor and then finishes hot."
"A great tripel and IMO a beer a lot of people forget or don't know about. It deserves the high marks it gets when reviewed."
"One bottle will do you right. Buy two, if you can afford it, and share with a bud."
"All in all this is an interestingly complex beer, and deserves another stab in the cooler season time."
"This does indeed taste like a so-so Yankee IPA merged with a big Belgian pale ale or Tripel, and further with some rather unassuming malt liquor. The Belgian side does seem to win out, given the fruity, yeasty (and alcoholic) notes herein. Any American-style IPA hopping is barely perceptible here, which is fine, but the denomination leaves something to be desired, and is a bit misleading, but that aside, this is a very well made, more hoppy than usual, strong Belgian pale ale."
"All in all, a very solid, very delicious strong Belgian ale. The ""Belgian IPA"" classification seems a bit of a misnomer to me, as the hop character was quite subdued. Nevertheless, this is a very good beer and is well-constructed. 'Tis good to see some more pirates in the beer realm!"
"MF&D - the body is perfectly viscous, not too much but not watery; just enough body that ones doesnt notice either a lack or a excess. carbonation is perfectly balanced with the medium-light body, a strong crisp carbonation to help offset some of the booze's power. I would easily session this beer if on tap."
"I was going to do a Rod Stewart themed review, next time, next time."
"D- Average drinkability for the style... very belgian-esque. I think the IPA designation is a bit misleading. Very good beer though, it was a close tie between this and Gulden Draak for which one I was going to try to clone."
"Had this the other night at home out of a Chimay glass. Poured a bronze/copper color with creamy white head and plenty of lacing. Smelled very fruity and yeasty with a hint of hops and spice. Tasted of yeast, raisins and spice with a mild sweetness. Mouthfeel was very smooth, but slightly oily. This was definitely a sipping beer, no more than 2."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
" This is what it's all about for me! complex yeast, great balance of flavor's, refreshing and yet a sipper. i've found my hidden treasure. ARRRrrr."
"this is a great belgian strong pale ale, but I like this style so I'm a sucker. This gives Duvel a run for the money, a little more carmel flavor than Duvel and a little less head. Don't let the funky label scare you, this is world class beer all the way. I haven't been able to find this one in a larger bottle, but if I could I'd love to see if a little time in the cellar changes the flavor profile at all."
"Not bad, but not something I'd drink again. Too much alcohol on the nose and it feels like syrup in the mouth. While I do appreciate the kick of bitterness on the end, it's not enough to keep me coming back."
"Oh and also, the ABV is quite high even though doesn't really translate into the fluid"
"Drinkability is really high despite the abv and the price. I could see myself picking up a bottle from time to time. I would really like to put it up against Houblon Chouffe in a side-by-side tasting just to highlight the differences between the two."
"D - 10.5%, sheesh. And it's soooo easy to drink! Easy boy!"
"fruitier than i'm looking for in a belgian IPA and not enough hops. maybe this was a sub-par bottle?"
"D: I really like this one. It is an intense ride for sure, but well worth it."
"A nice, drinkable belgian blond. Personally, I'd probably reach for something else, though. Glad to have tried it."
"M + D: A sharp twang of carbonation to start, smoothing out into a slick body, slightly sparkling, and finishing quite nice and dry. Nicely done, with a lasting flavour left in the mouth for some time, along with a touch of alcohol warming."
"D - Very high drinkability for a %10.5 abv. All in allthis is a fantastic beer. i am just getting into Belgian beer and I think this might be my new favorite."
"D - A strong golden belgian with a distinctly spicy yeast profile. Pretty drinkable for what it is, and it hides its high alcohol content well. There is a nice hop character, but the yeast dominates, and I wouldn't put it in the same category as other Belgian IPAs that I have had."
"Drinkability - For me too many things were working against this beer. This wasn't offensive but the levels of alcohol and spice really didn't work together on this beer."
"Its a super clean and delicious brew. Very easy drinking. I enjoyed the sweeter honey flavors here, as well as the toasty white bread."
"Piraat Ale is hazy, bubbly and golden with a thick, fluffy, frothy, yellowed head that has great retention and lacing. It has an aroma of bread, pepper, clove and bubblegum. It has a smooth and fluffy medium body with a clean finish. There are notes of leather and black pepper in the flavor. The alcohol is quite prominent. There really doesn't seem to be much bitterness or sweetness. Other flavors slowly reveal themselves, notably pear. The flavors are well blended and well balanced, but the alcohol flavor is a little distracting."
"Quite good, but not the hop pressence I was anticipating."
"This beer poured a golden color witha big fluffy head and lots of visible carbonation. The smell sweet malt with some yeasty presence with a hint of grassiness and spices. The taste starts off with some sweet honeylike malt that gives away to a huge blast of alcohol that finishes off with some slight bitterness and spiciness. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation and some warming from the alcohol. This is a very tasty and surprisingly drinkable beer for having such a high alcohol content."
"This is pretty strong and noticeably strong at that. It is very tasty and interesting.. I've had the Belgian take on the IPA a few times before and have found it to be a nice change of pace.. what happens when a monk gets their hands on a heavy load of hops. Very solid beer."
"D: A little overpowering to go through more than one of, but this is a very fine brew."
"It's fine. Relatively interesting, but not enough appeal for me to go back to it."
"Pours a rich golden-brown with a nice beige head. The nose has bready malts, tropical fruits, peppery alcohol and spicy yeast. The taste is quite sweet, but well balanced. I would call this more of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale than Belgian IPA as the hops presence is very subtle. Medium body is well carbonated. Tasty stuff, just lacks the complexity of other examples of teh style."
"330ml bottle, served in a tulip glass. Copper color, with a huge frothy white head, looking almost like ice cream. Great nose, hops and sweetness. Taste is quite interesting; nicely balanced hops and malt, a little peppery and the alcohol warms my insides quite nicely. Definitely worth sampling again."
"On tasting, one is struck first by a velvet smooth mouthfeel and delightful texture. Taste is not up to the same standard however with a bitter sourness, yeasty notes and lots of grapefruit. The alcohol comes out in the finish and it feels like I've had a good shot of an 80 proof liquor, not all that pleasant. I'm not sure what it was that was missing, that would make this a really good beer, maybe it was malt gone AWOL in the finish, it had an unsettling drop off on the swallow that took away from the drinkability of it all. Maybe a freasher bottle might be a good idea, I'll give that a try."
"wow. too much hidden alcohol. bombastic, delicious and full bodied. wow."
"As far as drinkability this would be a good beer to have a few but no session beer."
"Pours clear and golden. Aroma is bananas, cloves, nutmeg, light fruit. Flavor starts with more light fruit (cantaloupe?), and finishes with a tart, slightly bitter, tart kick and a spicy clove exhale. Feel has a nice carbonation which contributes to the kick. The alcohol is quite high and is felt."
"Poured into a pint glass, cloudy, deep amber in color. Foamy one finger head. Smells like alcohol, almost like malt liquor and a little bit of piney hop. Rich and heavy in the mouth, little spice, fruity and alcohol with a dry finish. One or two would be more than good enough for me."
"As far as Belgians go this was a great beer. It had a great head and the beer looked full of life. It smelled great with lots of fruit and spices. I expected a bitter beer for 9%, but Piraat Blonde was nice and mild tasting. It was one of the best Belgians I've had thus far"
"Drinkability: A sipper - Unless your tolerance is that of an Irish sink drain. This is the perfect beer to have while watching a sports event - one beer that feels like you've had three when you're finished!"
"Pretty good, overall."
"D: Among the better I have had of the style, something where I would not necessarily choose this over a hop-delivery vehicle like Hopslam but you can't compare. For what this is and what it tries to be, it is spot on. Well crafted and fully enjoyed."
"Out of squat, brown little bottle this beer was a gold/amber color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The three-finger head was off-white and retained well as a fluffy cap leaving bands of lacing like garters as I drank it. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, pale malt, floral hops and a light spiciness. The flavors were complex, well developed and balanced. I tasted floral and citrus hops first, followed by Belgian yeast, white pepper, light cloves, some fruit esters, alcohol heat and then both caramel malt and some doughy pale malt towards the end. Left a slight slick on my tongue but the palate was pleasant. The mouthfeel was creamy and luxurious, the body medium and the carbonation delicate. Great overall and a joy to drink."
"D- Excellent!!! This is one hell of a brew. Well worth a try. I would score it higher if it was listed as a Trippel."
"D: Decent. Not the best BIPA I've had, and I'd even be hesitant to call it one at all due to the lack of hoppiness. No problem drinking it though, this was fairly tasty."
"D: Definitely need to get more of these. This is one Belgian Blonde that forsakes the traditional strong yeastiness for a jam-packed, infinitely juicy fruitiness."
"D: Very easy to drink beer, which makes that 10.5% pretty dangerous but oh so good. Supposed to be known as popular among cigar lovers which is probably why I like it."
"D - It's never going to be one you'll pound, but it isn't anywhere near as difficult to drink as it probably should be. An excellent choice when you want a big Belgian blonde with a bit of a hop problem. Arrr!"
"The taste was slight ""alcohol-heavy"" but not too much for my taste. The flavor was strong banana and honey with a slight amount of malts. I thought the mouthfeel was very nice, and was overall impressed with this ale. This is my first from this brewer and will definitely have more. Highly recommended."
"D= This is one of my favorites and one of the beers that got me into Belgian ales. Not exactly sessionable, but I could certainly drink 2 or 3 if I wanted to."
"Picked up a single of this at Green's on Buford Highway in Atlanta. Poured into my Boulevard chalice. Poured an orange color with minimal head. Good amount of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is belgian yeast and orange peel. Tastes slightly citrusy with the Belgian yeast acting as the most prevalent taste. Ends slightly bitter. Good mouthfeel as there is a solid amount of carbonation. Overall, a good beer. Glad I finally got around to trying this one."
"Notes: I have had Augustijn on tap previously by this brewer, brouwerij Van Steenberge. Loved it and this is as good or better. Bought an interesting 6 pack sampler and look forward to the other 5!!!"
"Overall, a good beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Drinkability: Paired well with ""Lazy Confessions"" by the Moldy Peaches. Though the alcohol is noticeable it's not glaring or, as a wise man once said, ""It drink pretty good, don't it?"" However, when the plummeting US economy drives me to a pirate-based livelihood, I'll probably stick to dark rum instead of Piraat. That's just me though!"
"It's quite smooth, but it's a heady brew, and the alcohol edge is just a little too raw for me."
"Aroma isnt too impressive here just a sweet alcohol scent.The taste and mouthfeel is just were it needs to be. This is a good blonde with very little imperfections to it so far. If you come across this brand try one and judge for yourself I think its a good beer."
"D - Different style so you've got to be open to that. Easy drinking over all. ABV was no where to be tasted so that made things smoother."
"D: man, this one was a bit of a letdown. Seems very well respected amongst the world community and I can see some reasons why. Otherwise, I am not totally sure about this one being a world class brew. No doubt it is good..."
"Pours with a light white head, pools into bubble islands over the surface, attractive lacing clings for a moderate period. Light orange to yellow color, gauzy and unconcentrated hue allows for flickering hues and slight visibility of the bubble beads. Wet hay, clay and dried orange peels set the stage for the nose, the coriander, clove spice is very restrained and classy, golden apple, banana, pear fruit with a light glaze of honey, on the whole the alcohol is masked quite nicely. Full-bodied yet smooth and easygoing, this in turn without sacrificing the kind of stickiness required to ensure flavor intensity. The carbonation is too aggressive through the mouth entry but does fall into line thereafter. The white grapefruit and lemon citrus on the lighter side here, however, sparked by fruit flavors of pineapple, green apple, papaya and apricot. Some banana but plays, err, second banana. The grass, straw, tobacco ash and stone notes come out stronger as it warms. Gives you a pleasing bitter twist at the end for contrast."
"Excellent & refreshing brew, great palate, and high drinkability."
"Pours a hazy, almost glowing golden hue with minimal white white. Very subdued aromas suggesting sweet, fruity malts, which indeed feature prominently on the palate but are balanced by light, citrusy hops. Finish is warm, sweet, and yeasty. Medium body is finely carbonated, perfectly weighted to maximize enjoyment of the rich flavors. Drinks beautifully all on its own. Fantastic beer to have on hand during the winter."
"Very nice Belgie!"
"Notes - I can't tell you how presently surprised I am at this beer, I would put it right up there with Tremens."
"D: This is a decently well-made beer, though not my favorite among Belgians. Still, a solid effort."
"Perhaps this was an off bottle? This really disappointed, I had a tough time finishing."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable pleasant not as hoppy as i was hoping for but still very enjoyable. Would recommend and would enjoy again."
"Amber/Red color, big head-white, frothy. Aroma of hops, sour apples, slight alcohol. Fruity, flowery, apples, smooth, watery, subdued flavor compared to the aroma. Different than any other beer I've had."
"Hard to imagine a Belgium ale sending me down to the steamy equator, but that's where the pirates play. And I shall drink these like a pirate."
"Had a bottle while watching football this past Sunday at Common Ground. Poured into a smallish stemmed tulip glass. Extremely golden color. Very clear. Fluffy white head. Lots of carbonation. Can really smell the hops, and the alcohol too. Didn't taste overly hoppy though. The hop bite was there, but the wonderful doughy flavor kept the flavor moving. A great IPA, but the high alcohol content makes this one to savor, and not drink quickly. An old-school Belgian favorite. Wish I could drink this more often."
"This wouldn't be my first, second, or even fourth choice for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I've had the Piraat on too many occasions now to count and by the end always found a way to enjoy it. That affection never comes quick however, and isn't automatic the next time around either. The Van Steenberge lineup can be hit or miss and the same could be said of this offering. Myself personally, I don't care to take another shot but you feel free to."
"Served from a 33cl bottle. Poured a cloudy dark orange color with a medium white head. Had a very malty and yeasty fruit aroma that almost overpowered the nose. Taste was that of bubble gum, honey, spice, yeast, and alcohol. Felt highly carbonated and smooth in the mouth with a finish that was dry and alcoholic on the palate. Nothing like a strong belgian ale that hides it's alcohol well; ensures a good time for all!"
"D: A nice beer I'm glad to have had the opportunity to consume. Doesn't come across as being as strong as it is. Good thing I only had one bottle available."
"rich golden opaque color with about a one finger white head that holds well and some lacing. aroma actually gets better as the beer sits with fruity sweet candy notes and hints of spice. nicely spiced big flavors with cinnamon and pepper and a sweet fruity taste then the warmth hits for a great finish. only had the one 11.2 oz stubby bottle but at 10.5 alcohol its not session beer but i sure wish i had another."
"Notes - Wow, what a unique beer! Maybe it's because this is my first Belgian IPA. It relies on elements I'm not normally fond of, namely carbonation and alcohol, and yet I'm enjoying this beer tremendously. That's either great craftsmanship or good hype. Either way, I'll gladly have this one again."
"Notes- if this beer had a full, rich head in my tulip, like it does in the tulip on the label, it would probably be an A- instead of a B-. The appearance in the glass, combined with the smell, are sending the exact wrong message. Ignoring them, though, the beer is very enjoyable."
"Bottle in a Belgian sample pack I received for Christmas. Golden, slightly cloudy pour into a trappist glass. Large white fizzy, frothy head. Aroma of bananas, yeast and some spices. Nice dry taste of slight hops with Belgian yeast and a nice full mouthfeel. Lasting somewhat sharp finish."
"Pours a cloudy/hazy yellow color with a large white head, some sticking. Nose of bitter hops, coriander, all spice and thick bready yeast. Lots of the same characteristics going on in its flavor, sweet and sturdy pale malts support the body, lots of bitter dry hops and classic Belgian yeast and fruity, spicy esters. Medium/full body, bright with carbonation. Easy enough to drink but i'd be satisfied with just one or 2."
"D: This one is sneaky, very easy drinking, one that goes down well all night, without any distinct alcohol taste. Excellent high alcohol beer as far as drinkability goes."
"Overall, a great beer. Not nearly as hoppy as your traditional pale ales and as a Belgian it stands up well with comparable beers. Its hard to find a bad beer from the Van Steenberge lineup."
"Very unique, and very drinkable."
"A superb beer and a reason to buy the Belgian sampler sixpack that I got this one from. The beautifully crafted hop component mandates freshness to enjoy this beer at it's fullest."
"Among the easier Belgian IPA to track down in the US, this is a delightful treat on tap. Smells and tastes of a perfect proportion of hops and spices, notably cloves. The alcohol content is present in the taste but beneficial and certainly not overwhelming. And in spite of such a strong flavor and high ABV this beer is easy to drink and good choice for an introductory beer, where others might be too intense."
"I poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. It pours a pale yellow with an atractive white head. The aroma is very spicy. The spicy triple taste is obvious, via the belgian yeast. I really do not notice the hoppy characteristics, it taste like a standard triple to me. The beer is medium bodied and smooth. Piraat is deceptively drinkable given its high ABV. Not my favorite style, I would rather have an IPA or a triple. That being said not a bad beer, just not my fave."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a big billowing head. Apple peel, yeast, clove aromas with some orange, lemon and spicy hops. Carbonated and light on the palate. The flavors are bready malt, orange and citrus. The beer has a sourish palate presence. A yeasty dry finish. This is an OK beer, but others in the genre are better."
"Very drinkable."
"This beer is astonishing. The mildly honey-like texture, mixed with a spicy, flowery taste and a glowing golden color should please anyone. The high weight is very well blended, too, as one can taste the alcohol but it's just an aspect of the many flavors washing through the nose and over the tongue. The beer is a little too gassy, but this distinction gives me something to think about, which is great."
"good beer, what else can i say"
"D- A very unique and interesting beer. I have passed this by on numerous occasions, but this is definitely worth a try. For 10.5% ABV, this doesn't really drink like it."
"I would pair this with soft cheeses, especially a brie or camembert. Bread, cheese, grapes, and crackers would pair wonderfully."
"D: Overall drinkability was only slightly better then average at best. Much better examples per style as this one comes off pretty bland and ordinary. This was my third time sampling and havent grown to like it yet."
"Would buy this again... interesting, very complex."
"Awful. Pours clear gold with a fizzy white head. Orange peel, spice, and malt in the aroma. Taste was a metallic straw flavor with some malt and spice. A dirt-like finish. Judging by the other ratings, I may have got a bad one. But the one I got does not make me want to find out for sure."
"Bottom line: A nice Belgian Ale worth trying..."
"If I had any complaints, it is that this is a bit aggresive, but then again...so are pirates...I guess?"
"D- This is a very drinkable beer to me. It warms you very nicely! High % will sneak up on you if not carefull! Cheers!"
"330 ml bottle. Served in an oversized wine glass, the Piraat pours a golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. The aroma is sweet and fruity, it smells like pears, apples, candy sugar, Belgian yeast, honey, peppery spice and cloves. Taste is the same as the aroma (but stronger), it's fruity, sweet and spicy. It's strong and intense tasting. Mouthfeel is medium, with good lively carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and the 10.5% ABV isn't noticable at all in the taste, but you can feel it after a while. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy this again and recommend it to others."
"D - Very good and representative of the Belgian ale style. Also, good since only slightly warming."
"This is definitely a good looking beer with a golden/amber color and a nice foamy white head that has good lace throughout consumption. There is some fruitiness to the taste, but overall it's not very strong. It has some bitter taste too. Not a bad beer."
"Good beer overall. The nose is VERY fruity, grapes, plums, lemons, etc. The appearance is golden/orange in color, and clear. Thin white head. The flavor is dry, but fruity, a mix of sweet grapes, and citrusy fruits. The finish has a strong hop bittering not previously detected, and has a citrus quality as well. The mouthfeel is a medium thickness. Good beer overall."
"It drinks much smaller than a 10.5% ABV beer, so be very careful with this one!"
"D - This is a very good Belgian IPA. Nicely balanced and surprisingly easy-drinking despite the high ABV."
"D: It's pretty darn good, but it would destroy my palate after a couple."
"Why yes sir, I'll have another!"
"Drinkability: Great, slightly astringent bitter finish leaves you wanting another sip. Would drink it again. Reminds me of Duvel, but a rougher cousin - which makes it all the better."
"Overall - An excellent Belgian beer, reminds me a Tripel style ale. Could use a little bit more hops for an IPA, otherwise a great beer. Definitely an ""introduction to Belgians"" type of beer. Will buy this again when the mood arises."
"D-great beer to introduce someone to belgian beer. very friendly and tasty."
"D: It was light and packed a punch. Very nice representation of the style but a tad over carbonated and it needed a touch more sweetness to balance the citrus and spices. Nice beer that could support a long summer session."
"This beer went down easy despite the high abv. I would not say it is highly drinkable because of the fact that too many of these and you would be absolutely wasted and poor. Despite these facts I give Piraat a 4.0 for this mark. Enjoy this beer carefully."
"This stuff's pretty tasty but the mouthfeel really bummed me out. I thought it might be a bit better."
"pours up a golden color with a big frothy off white head. great lacing... the nose is grains, honey, pale malts and sweet malts... the taste is floral hops, honey, sweet malts, grains... a very sweet brew... medium body, medium carbo, sweet finish..."
"Fantastic beer. Intense. Complex. Strong! I think that pouring a Piraat into a properly chilled goblet is one of the most beautiful things a beer drinker can experience. It pours a rich, golden amber, with two to three fingers of head. Nice lacing. It's sweeter than some people care for, but once I get used to the intensity of the flavor, I love it. Truly one of the best beers I've ever had."
"750ml corked & caged. Don't know what to expect. Amber triple IPA? I thought that was three different styles :) Color is pale, almost luminous gold with active carbonation & a thin white head. Smell is very pronounced & apparent the moment you pop the cork. Lemons, pepper, grassy and a hint of sugar. Very intriguing & a definite hop presence. The taste is wonderful! A touch medicinal, taste of hay, a smooth caramel back, pepper finish. Very complex but surprisingly light. There's vanilla in there too somewhere. Mouthfeel is chewy and very, very nicely carbonated. Again, a balancing act that the beer pulls off very well. This one is very drinkable, with the malt making you want more, the hops making it seem light enough to let you drink a lot, and a pleasant alcohol warmth that just makes my toes tingle. Good on ya, Brouwerij Van Steenberge!"
"D - Strong spices and high percent make it not so drinkable for me. Definitely worth a try though."
"Drinks pretty, good this is more of a nightcap or dessert type offering"
"Drinkability is ok, but it's too boozy, and not enough hop flavor or aroma - or the one's they used are too grassy. A easy way to get drunk, but not one to savor."
"Orange hue with nice clingy head that sticks around. Tart smell tries to masks the alcohol but can't cover up the lethal dose. Light bodied in feel that evolves from sour orange to beautiful tart sweetness and finishes with a alcoholic kick that warms the palate. A gorgeous, bold Triple that can play the role of a late nightcap or an afternoon break away from the sun but the alcohol could leave you half in the bag pretty early."
"Poured a clear but not brilliant gold body color with cumulus white head of tiny bubbles, like what you'd see atop a Duvel (sticky and lasts forever). Aroma is of champagne, bread yeast, and candied fruit. Flavor is sweet and fruity, again champagne-like, but I felt it lacked structure or backbone...it's all melody and no harmony if you will. I felt like it needed more malt to balance out the other flavors that are present. Mouthfeel is light like cotton candy. Hides its 10.5% scarily well in both flavor and mouthfeel. I liked it, but it hardly blew my socks off."
"I'm glad I still have 3 more to go."
"Good, but by no means one of the 5 best in the world. The Piraat blond is better."
"Hard for me to nail this style as I'm still new to it. However, this beer does seem drinkable to an extent. The carbonation is strong and ditto for the alcohol. With some aging, this beer will be magnificent. Otherwise, it's a good take at a relatively new style."
"Definitely a beer I will purchase again."
"Piraat is superb all around. The drink has a beefy medium body and damned-near perfect carbonation to lighten it to quaffability, and all without any real indication of the whopping 10.5% ABV."
"Notes: What a pleasure it was to drink this beer from tap tonight. I highly recommend it."
"The taste was a funky yeast taste I am used to tasting with a Belgian. This is my first IPA of the country. The malt was fairly in the background with the hoppiness taking most of the drink. I found the Piraat to be a delicious soft version a normal IPA. I wish I could of had the large size instead of the 11.2 oz bottle."
"Appears like gold champagne with a beer head. Smell is like nutmeg and pear. The taste is similar to an apple or pear with a definite nutmeg taste, a big sip is yeasty with a mild malt finish, moreso then any other IPA I have ever drank. Mouthfeel is definitely bubbly and champagne feel. I could easily throwback one of these, very drinkable. This beer is a marriage of characteristics of an ipa and Belgian triple"
"Conclusion: My initial sips left me with lukewarm feelings for this beer, but after deep scrutiny I have concluded that this beer just rocks! Every sip the flavor is slightly different. Every 5 sips the flavor is completely different. It never looped or repeated, it's just been a journey from first sip to last. In this way Piraat is like a movie where many other beers are more like a tv show or sitcom. Maybe it's more like a free-form jazz odyssey and less like a 4 minute repetitious radio song. Regardless, I love it and the $15 (or so, post-tax) is totally worth it given that you have the time to tear each little sensation apart at and analyze each one on a clean palate. Otherwise you might as well be buying a museum ticket to view a Van Gogh without your glasses on, only to see a bunch of pretty colors."
"D- One of the better Belgies, but not the best. Would have another if you offered."
"Overall this is a very good beer. Pick one up if you can."
"Couldn't pack on this one. The ABV and the yeast will keep me at one for now."
"Pours a very nice mid-copper color with fantastic head and lacing. It has a very nice floral hoppy scent, though it's hard to get much through all of the foam. Very nice taste, it starts off with a nice hoppy/bitter taste, followed by a very nice Belgian spiciness, and finishes with a great smooth mixture of both. A very nice beer, although the carbonation and the alcohol content make it slightly rough."
"12oz bottle as part of gift pack from LCBO for Christmas 2007. Best before of May 2009. Pours a murky light brown with a fluffy head that recedes quickly to a normal film. Allowed to warm for about a half hour. Strong aroma, but it's too sweet. First taste is sweet, with a hint of spice as it warmly goes down the throat. Full bodied. The sweetness continues but is reasonably kept in check. Pretty nice, strong stuff."
"D - Let's get ready to rumble!! I'm getting more this week for sure."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium bodied with low carbonation and a dry finish. Slight apple taste after the finish. This is one I'd drink again, though I'm definitely going to check out the others in the style first, got a Chouffe IPA in my fridge right now."
"D - Good beer. I really like this beer a lot."
"Pours a pretty clear gold with a small to medium head. Nice lacing on the surface. Aroma is sweet with a note of alcohol. There are some herbal hops and some light yeastiness as well. Taste is quite sweet. Plenty of herbal hops provide balance. Lots of alcohol warm but not so much that it becomes annoying or abrasive. Some phenolic and yeasty notes also. Intense but also fairly balanced and very good. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Definitely a sipper. Overall a dangerous and excellent beer. Great name as well."
"I have been considering brewing a triple for some time now...but after tasting this I think I would love to brew a clone of this, if soley to have this on hand. (and hopefully for much cheaper than 2 cases of this would cost, considering that at where I bought this set, a single 330 ml bottle retails for close to 4 dollars."
"Mouthfeel is a little sticky, and the carbonation is making me burp a lot. I don't know that I could drink a lot of this one, but I would certainly like to try. It's a very complex beer that reminds me more of a tripel than an IPA. It's unique, and in my opinion, definitely worth the price."
"Piraat's appearance was wonderful, a bright blonde ale, which smell is towards the sweet side. The taste is very strong similar to most tripels. It leaves a very sweet after taste. It is very drinkable, it goes great with a nice piece of steak. It is a very smooth beer."
"Drinkability: The only problem with this beer is its cost and its become harder to find. It is my favorite beer, its a bit strong, but best and rich enough to enjoy anyway."
"Taste the honey, with a crisp flavour, bit of a carbonation bite, and an aftertaste that lingers. Is thick in the mouth, but not at all smooth (The carbonation brings with it a heavy bite). Head remains for a long period as I clear my pallet with some water, and then jet away to attend to an errand. Impressive retention, in fact. This has to stem from the carbonation - I belched twice while drinking it, despite taking my time. Drinkability good, depsite high ABV."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice high-octane beer to drink for a long time or at least until the ABV catches up with you."
"Eric"
"AFTERTHOUGHT: As expected, when the yeast is swirled in, the alcohol bite gets it's sharp corners shaved off, and the mouthfeel becomes decidedly creamier. Also noticeable is a more ""baked"" character to the malts and a more tart finish that works well with the hops."
"Note: This was part of the ""Global Beer Network 6 Living Flanders Ales"" 6-pack. Expensive, but an awesome opportunity. More brewers should do this."
"Overall this is fabulous. Not as hoppy as other Belgian IPA's (Houblon Chouffe/De Ranke XX) but just as tasty. Went very well with a toasted baguette and brie sandwich."

"Pours, the first half, with good clarity, a light amber color with a solid half inch of big bubbled head. The aromas contain a fair amount of Belgian character, light on the phenolics, more a citrus brightness. The hops in this one aren't particularly strong in the aroma, just notes of pine and a light floral spiciness. On the palate, things seem really out of balance, sort of wacky. I get a nice light crackery malt flavor, combined with some more nondescript hops, light yeasty character. But, it's the lower than usual carbonation combined with a biggish body that hurt this beer. The finish certainly has some hop bitterness to it. This is just a really difficult style to pull off (I feel) and Piraat comes up a bit short."
"D- Not too bad but not what I was looking for or expecting when I read Triple IPA."
"D- too drinkable for such potent stuff. i'm the captain of this ship and i have responsibilities, but eh, they might get neglected now after i spent damn near a pint and a half trying to decipher this bitch. boozed, sure. stumbley, not yet, blown away, no, but still quite impressed. i envisioned like a black & tan of sorts, equal amounts mixed of tripel and american IPA, but instead met with what seemed like a decently hoppy tripel. now i know what to expect from a BIPA and would like to further explore the style."
"drinkability: very tasty and goes down nice and smooth I expected a much bigger American hop character, and while I didn't find the big hops I was looking for I was pleased with what I did fine, a nice, big, Belgian ale with lots of hop character. I am interested to try more of these Belgian IPA's"
"Finish is herbal, dry, and pleasantly chalky."
"Tastes like citrus and yeast with a bit of bananas. Not much carbonation. Many fond memories of this brew."
"Notes: This is an excellent Belgian Strong Pale Ale that is similar to their Augustijn Ale but with a higher alcohol presence."
"I am about 80% done drinking this 330ml bottle and I can FEEL it. Not a beer that you will drink too much of, especially for the 4$ price but it is worth every penny. IMO nearly as good or possibly better than Duvel."
"The nose of the beer is hoppy with hints of fruits. Some spices as well. The taste of the beer is bitter, but with a nice splash of fruits and spices. The alcohol comes out fairly well, but it doesn't harm the beer. The complexity to this beer is surprising because the hops are initially very present, but the subtle spices and fruits are great. The mouth feels is nice and creamy. I don't know if I'd want to drink many of these because of the spices, but that is usually how I feel on Belgian beer."
"Despite the ABV easier to drink than one can imagine."
"The taster allows the boldness to emerge more, though it is very smooth and complex. There is lots of banana, berry, and apple, very rich, really delicious. The mouthfeel is really fine. While it could use a little more carbonation, it doesn't veer into the soda-like texture that can go overboard for some Belgians. This is just right, and easy to down. The alcohol thankfully catches up just after it finishes, a good hot flash as a reminder of what a delicious beverage that was. Very good stuff."
"Bronzed apricot hues, thick, frothy head. Nose is sweet, crunchy honey, as are the dominant notes in the mouth. The sweetness is complicated with subtle malt flavor and mild spices, but the overall effect is one of balance, despite the alcohol. The brew is softly spritzy, which works. A nice style tripel that's easy to find and enjoy."
"Highly carbonated, slightly crisp, and somewhat refreshing. Yet another delicious Belgian brew. This one's got quite a bit of alcohol, so sipping would be recommended."
"drinkability is good. this is an easy going belgian brew in aroma and taste, but heavy in alcohol and CO2. regardless, this is a nicely proportioned brew that remains light on the palate. cheers!"
"D: Not terrible but it took me a bit to finish it. Alcohol holds this back quite a bit."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass with a patch on me eye and a dead parrot on me shoulder. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a ridiculous 4 inch thick head that me dead parrot was actually able to sit on. After 20 minutes of starin at that head with me one good eye I decided she wasnt goin nowhere so I better get to drinkin. The taste was dry and way too sweet almost like drinking a wine. Warm alcohol finish with a sticky sweet mouthcoat. Way too sweet for a beer. I'd rather walk the plank than drink this swill again. Shiver me timbers this shit sucked."
"D- Definitely heavy on the drinkability. Could use a few more of these, RIGHT NOW."
"D - Drinkability is good. The high abv is hidden well and makes this one go down that much easier. I was expecting more hops in this beer but was pleasantly surprised in the way the hops were balanced with other flavors. Definitely a recommeded beer."
"so bomb so bomb so bomb so bomb!!! this beer is by far one of the best beers I've ever had. so bomb! it's sipping material, though can easily be drunk in a gulp with its bomb tastes sizzlin your tastebuds. if I had one a day i'd live to see 92. give thanks and praise for this bomb did i say bomb? CHRONIC belgian brew."
"Okay brew, I was hoping for more."
"Flavor of tropical fruit, heavy spices, and rich bitterness. White pepper. As it warms the spices become stronger and the overall flavor becomes more bitter."
"Visions of being a Pirate steeling one's courage with this strong ale can't help but leap to mind whilst partaking of this brew."
"I absolutely love this beer, it's one of the most unique and complex beers I've had the pleasure of trying. It pours golden and creamy with a gorgeous head. The taste is nearly indescribable and packs a serious punch. It has a strong yeasty flavor with earthy, spicy notes as well as creamy fruit tones. It has a strong phenol character, which normally I don't care for, but it lends a bold sharpness to this beer which I found very alluring. This beer has a lot of warmth to it which I'm sure is related to the high ABV. While drinking too many glasses could be dangerous, I really enjoyed this flavorful beer."
"The pour on this beer was a gold color with a white one finger head. Citrus and honey were the only apparent aromas that I could pick up on. The taste was pretty much the same with some hops in the mix. It was an easy big beer for me to drink. It was refreshing with a little carbonated bite."
"Pours a clear golden hue before the yeast pour, with a massive snow-white head that leaps out of the glass- just to let you know its Belgian. The typical stubborn head that comes with the style is here- one that forces you to wait; and admire the rocky billows of foam that slowly sink to reveal magnificent spiderweb lacing and active carbonation. The high carbonation releases effervescent aromas of candy-sugar, slightly buiscuity pils malt, and mild Saaz hops. The nose seems much more subdued than appropriate, and pales in comparison to the appearance or taste. First sip is light beet sugar and sharp pils. Some faint toasted notes and Trappist phenols similiar to Tripel become more obvious in the aftertaste, but the character is almost entirely devoted to bitterness. There is little to no hop flavor aside from a background spicy saaz and mabye a hint of floral Hallertau- but even the bitterness is lacking to balance the syrupy sweet malt and sugar. Of course this style is open to interpretation but Piraat is more sweet than bitter and has very litle hop presence(and yes- I am drinking the IPA Piraat). The medium body is made ultra light due to the knife-like carbonation that also whisks away some of the residual sweetness but further masks the timid noble hop character. Finishes sweet with mellow yet tart phenols, a bland and flat bitterness, and rosey alcohol notes as it warms. The phenols are interesting but other than that this seems to be a fairly simple beer and poor example of the style. This would score better as a hoppy BSGA."
"Poured an almost champagne like colour into a chalice. Very little head to speak of, but plenty of carbonation. Noticed plenty of yeast chunks got through. Will have to learn to decant better. Very tropical floral smell. Lots of citrus, bananas, and dry grass and earth. Sweet and spicy taste. Lots of fruits and malts, with some pepper, cardamon, warming alcohol and I swear I tasted paprika. Mouthfeel was a bit harsh. Overly carbonated, almost burning sensation. A decent beer that needs improvement."
"D - A sipper no doubt but highly enjoyable."
"D: As this mama warms she gets good good good. I improved the marks above a couple of times, because of this. Very strong yes but like I've said before men drink strong brews and men would be just fine with a jar of this in front of all of ye night. Definitely wear this! It fits so nicely. She will fit you like two latex mittens. YES!"
"Drinkability: Not my favorite Belgian. But it was alright."
"Drank at a house warming party, no glasses to pour it in yet. Rather rich and warm in flavour. Nice mixture of carbonation and hops up front, but not overpowering. A little sweet, but once again a good balance and not overpowering. No distinct alcohol flavour, despite its high percentage. As it got warm the quality decreased."
"D- This is rated lower due to the really big ABV. Drank one and realized I probably would not be able to have another."
"After letting the beer warm up a bit and getting past the 10.5% alcohol taste, it really starts to open up. Deep flavors of malt. Light dancing of carbonation. A really fine drink."
"If I were a pirate, I assume this would be my beer. Tropical, and boozy enough to cure the pain in my peg-leg. I haven't had too many forays into the 10.5 range yet. AL-CO-HOL! I'm not knocking this beer at all--it's good--it just reminds me of the malt-liquor kick experienced as an 18-year-old. I'm feeling pleasant and warm after one of these. If 10.5 can be drinkable, I guess this has good drinkability. Proceed with caution!"
"Now this was to be my first of the style which I thought a Belgian IPA, not a BSPA. Maybe it is mislabeled. As a BSPA it is unspectacular. It isn't overly complex, but is heavy, malty, spicy, and alcoholic; which probably ranks it as one of the best pirate grog's available. yargh."
"Overall a nice example of a Belgian strong golden ale. My bottle says 10.5% ABV, my cheeks are already feeling warm. I always like to try a bottle or two a year, just to get reacquainted to an old friend I've enjoyed for many years (I even have the T-shirt!)."
"Very creamy finish. It does mask the high ABV nicely. I just must have had a bad bottle or this stuff just smells..."
"D - Abv definitely causes a hit here, this certainly is not an anytime brew, however, it is a wonderfully complex yet balanced sipper. Given it's name, I never would have expected something so refined. Find this one and try it, you will not be disappointed!"
"If anything I have been harsh with this beer as I was close to giving it a 4.5 for taste. Quite delicious, evilly drinkable with no off flavours. Not one I had heard of before, but still one of the best beers I have tried however pricy ($11.50 per 330mL bottle). Recommended for sure!"
"Mouthfeel is rich. I didn't notice any alcohol burn, but I definitely felt the warmth. Drinkability is very good. None of the tastes are so strong as to become annoying over a long haul. The long haul here is two...based on the abv, but I would enjoy every sip of those two!!! A nice beer."
"Golden brown in color, fruity (citrus and floral) and yeasty on the nose, with corresponding flavors, subtle hops on the finish. Hops develops over time with reminants of typical Belgian yeast. Not a trace of the alcohol, well brewed. Great Belgian for beginners to try, and beer drinkers will enjoy its nuances and lasting flavor"
"Overall: A truely stellar brew, one that is a good gateway beer for the american extreme beer drinker that is trying to cross over to belgians."
"This was poured from a small 11.2 oz bottle. Gorgeous head, beautiful golden body. lots of lacing arond the goblet. Big smells of grass, yeast,wheats, wonderful wild things! These belgian brews are like sitting in a field! Taste is quite complex, sweet malts, wheats, citrus, grapefruit, thick sugary mouthfeel, very thick and sticky on the palate. Slight alcohol burn deep in the throat. drinkability for me is very slow simply because this is a very nice and complex brew, I can't drink quickly because it will all be gone! Imagine a Hogaarden x12 and this is it."
"Poured this into a tulip glass and received a small head that left constant lacings. The beer has a medium body w/ a amber golden appearance. The smell is very hoppy and yeasty w/ a tart citrus smell picked up. This is a beer that I will need to try again with more beer experience, because the taste is one of sour apples/pears/cherries or kriek/pineapples...basically a more acidic, not smooth fruit (not an orange, bananna, strawberry). I also picked up some of the hops w/ the high ABV, but there is also a dry backbite due to some pepper or spices. This isn't like most IPAs that heat up/exhaust your taste buds, this has a smooth, tasty flow over your tongue. I wouldn't drink more than one of these in one sitting, as the one I had has already made my night."
"From a short, fat, stout, 11.2 oz bottle that came as part of a ""Living Beers of the World"" Gift Set from Gary's in Madison, pours a yellow-golden color with minimal head that soon dissapated... smell is full of fruits, esters and bananas... taste strongly complements the aroma... full of citrus fruits, bananas, esters, alcohol, and yeast... a hefty 10.5% ABV is certainly noticeable... the beer has a champagne / white-wine characteristic thanks to its strong alcohol percentage... very powerful and dominating brew... although considered a Belgian IPA, this could easily be mistaken for a Belgian Strong Ale... an interesting brew, with a pirate on the sticker of the bottle... recommended as an interesting depiction of the style... hard-to-find... worth a try..."
"Pour the sediment in and you get a darker, cloudier brew that is slightly sweeter."
"Overall, very enjoyable. Unfortunately a bit expensive where I live, but its worth the extra dough."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. It fills the glass about half-way with a cloudy, melon-amber color. There is about 1/4 inch of head that was produced by a relatively easy pour. It slowly begins to fade as it sets and it turns into blotchy swirls. It smells like strong sweet malts, grassy hops, and candi sugar. This smells a lot like St. Bernardus Watou Tripel. There is a creamy aspect to the smell that I think is produced by a very delicate balance of the malt used and the yeast. I like the flavor quite a bit. It is strong and sweet, the alcohol provides undertones of tart fruits that give it a sweet white wine dimension. The maltiness provides a strong base for the slightly bitter and grassy hops to build a bridge to the fruity alcohol. This is a well made, and extremely well balanced beer that gets better as it warms. The alcohol becomes more apparent, but I enjoy the level of fusel alcohol present. It's a kid reminder that this beer will kick your ass if your aren't careful."
"Very good beer. I really like the spicy hop aftertaste. It sets this beer apart from the other pale belgian ales I have had."
"Tastes of sweet fruits, pale malt, has a very noticeable and warming alcohol and a bit of a bite at the back of the mouth. This is a sipper."
"D: I love this beer, in this style this beer is excelent and one of the best I've had in recent memory, a very nice beer for a very nice time of year, truely magnificent."
"Pours a bright and clear medium gold, with a massive, rocky head that lasts very well and leaves spectacular lacing. Smell is bold and hoppy, the alcohol showing slightly as well. Spicy, cloves and pepper in the mix alongside the citrus and crackers. Taste is strong and upfront. Big hop bitterness is obvious, but there's more here as well. Spices and banana, light yeastiness and a hint of alcohol sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and with loads of carbonation, and drinkability is pretty good. I love it, it's raw and ballsy with loads of character."
" Body is full and a bit creamy, with only a touch of stickiness. The finish is rather dry and very warming. While this isn't the easiest-drinking beer around, it is quite pleasant for slowly sipping over the course of an hour or so."
"Overall - Just an excellent IPA overall, although it is a fair bit sweeter than other IPAs I have tried, suggesting it probably should be in a different category (probably Belgian Strong Pale Ale). I personally prefer Unibroue Maudite, which is a dark ale, but tastes fairly similar to Piraat."
"D:	This is a fantastic example of a finely brewed Belgian pale ale. Its incredibly crisp and refreshing and delightfully smooth to drink despite the 9% ABV (it hides the alcohol very well). Very well crafted with elegantly balanced flavours. Its well hidden 9% ABV makes this one highly drinkable  so be careful! I cant wait till my next one."
"Nothing exceptional fights the alcohol in this ale. The alcohol is overpowering with no reward, minus the obvious."
"d: One day is plenty, but one everyday would be fine with me."
"Hazy gold with large, thick head. Aggressive aromas of honey, floral-citrus (like a tropical flower or fruit -- honeysuckle pineapple), bread dough, yeast funk, and alcohol, but somehow it worked perfectly. Very tasty as well -- definitely a big beer, but it justifies its punch with a delicious mix of flavors. Further research is required, and I will be trying this again soon."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night. It's very flavorful and refreshing even as it warms up. I think this is now one of my preferred relaxation beers. I'm definitely looking forward to having this again."
"D: I didnt like this beer nearly as much as I previously have."
"Could have drank at least three or four more of these small 10 ounce pours, looking forward to trying the triple IPA by Piraat next, had this beer twice now, once in bottle and on tap, and the draft really shows why it is a great Belgian, tastes much smoother and does not disappoint"
"Yarr!"
"O: The first time I had this years ago the bar tender said to me 15 minutes before last call ""You want to end your night with this..."" he gave a Piraat and there haven't been any truer words!"
"The carbonation is incredible - not overdone, persistent and yet not overpowering."
"Pours to a Hazy orange with not much head. Nose is very subtle, but still present. No big surprise on taste, it's a very typical belgian. Light carbonation seems appropriate. The biggest thing I noticed about this beer is the alcohol. It is very easy to find in the flavor of each drink and at 10.5% it finds you quickly too. Personally I wish the alcohol was a little more ""hidden"" in theother flavors of the beer. Still an excellent choice when looking for something to relax with and sip on."
"D - This is IMO nothing other than a good BSPA. Why is it listed as a Belgian IPA and called an ""Amber Triple IPA"" under the title? This is a damn fine beer that reminds me of the interesting Atomium that I had a few weeks ago in that it's main flavor component seems to be honey and sweet summer fruits. Although it doesn't stand out in any way, it's a really nice and boozy (but still fresh and breezy) Belgian."
"Golden brown in color, fruity (citrus and floral) and yeasty on the nose, with corresponding flavors, subtle hops on the finish. Hops develops over time with reminants of typical Belgian yeast. Not a trace of the alcohol, well brewed. Great Belgian for beginners to try, and beer drinkers will enjoy its nuances and lasting flavor"
"It's a decent beer. It's definitely worth a try, but it's just a bit too boozy and it doesn't really fit well with the other flavors. I'm glad I had a friend to share this bottle with."
"If you see a bottle of this around somewhere it's a must-try, at least once. They also make a nifty tulip glass for it that has the Piraat logo screened on the side."
"Drinkability: Even at 10.5% Ive downed 4 of these in a sitting before during a Bucs game. Not the best decision in the world, and I was feeling it at the end, but boy did it make losing the game easier to bear."
"I don't know about the IPA part, but it was still a good strong pale Belgian. There was a rich, bread dough and fruit malt flavor, similar to a paler barleywine or DIPA. he malt was followed up by some yeasty sweetness and funky yet tropical? hops. It's tasty and different - gotta love that."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, very smooth and highly drinkable. Very tasty too, such a good beer."
"Overall I recommend the beer and would try it again, maybe after some cellaring. My only criticism was that I would liked more hops, which is true of almost every beer that crosses my lips."
"I'm really intrigued by this style, I think its a great match. Piraat pours a slightly hazy light gold with a beautiful creamy, frothy head that lingers down the glass. The aroma is dry slightly funky yeast, I could mistake this for a hoppy saison. There is a nice subtley fragrant piney aroma like chinook hops but soft, not rough at all. The flavor is mostly like a triple. It's sweet upfront with a slightly chalky dry yeast flavor. It is slightly bitter in the aftertaste with some hop flavor, but toned done compared to the aroma. The beer is very smooth, and the alcohol is barely apparent, even after it warms. I will have to look into more beers of this style, because although this one is delicious, it's fairly expensive."
"Will most assuredly be drinking this beer more in the future."
"The mouthfeel is prickly hot and yet airy. Active carbonation keeps it feeling crisp and light. The abv and the somewhat hot feel to it kept me from having another on this day. I would have it again, but probably only one at a time."
"Mouthfeel is thin and a bit fizzy. I would have given a higher drinkability, but I woke up the next day with a killer headache. I walked the plank on this one."
"A nice, well-balanced, spicy sweet, tasty Belgian IPA here. Quite drinkable for abv level, though glad I shared it with someone."
"A unique beer that I will probably pick up again. Interesting flavors mix with big alcohol that adds more interesting flavors. Another quality Belgian brew."
"D-now this is one dangerous brew that I wish I got in a larger size than this stubby. This is basically a tripel with a huge dose of bittering hops. The almost honey like sweetness plays so well off of the bitter hop background and then at the end you get this dose of spice, magnificent. I will go out of my way for this."
"A quintessential example of a fine Belgian ales. Sometimes Piraat tastes more funky to me, other bottles some fruitier. But it's always wonderful. Van Steenberge forever has my highest respect for creating two world-class beers: this and the phenomenal Gulden Draak."
"The beer pours an impressive, solid gold color with pretty good lacing and head retention. There isn't a huge amount of foam, but what there is, lasts and lasts. The beer has a sweet honey aroma on the nose, but with some underlying spice and white pepper. Very intriguing. The beer is just excellent on the palate; with flavors of honey, butter and white pepper. The beer is not the least bit heavy and has a crispness I really appreciate it. It finishes just a bit dry/bitter from the hops, and is quite refreshing. Although you know the abv. is up there, this beer is surprising easy to drink. Really, one would never guess the abv. is 10.5%. Just an altogether excellent beer."
"From a corked 750 ml bottle, this beer poured a medium gold color with a massive head that threatened to spill all over the floor. This is one lively brew. Aroma was very fruity and floral with some spicy hops in the nose. Taste was incredibly sweet and syrupy with some notes of citrus and peppery spices to go along with it. Alcohol was quite evident up front and in the finish, but I didn't mind too much after half the bottle was gone. Mouthfeel was medium to full in the palate. The very high level of sweetness paired with the strong alcoholic notes hurt the drinkability for me. Overall, this is a pretty good Belgian IPA that would benefit from some time in the cellar."
"D- This is very drinkable and quite complex."
"Drinkability - I have heard a lot about this beer and tried to have that not effect my review. I can see the attraction for this offering and it does represent the Belgian IPA style very well. However, my leanings are toward the Chouffe or Ranke offerings."
"Solid."
"Drinkability - high abv holds down sessionability, but even if it did not, I find this to be only a decent beer, not one that I would seek out often."
"Poured into a Piraat tulip. Pours a rich golden orange with a white, super frothy rocky head that sits there for a long time. The aroma is of Belgian yeast, sugar, and fruit. That taste mimics it, not a lot of hops detected but some earthiness, mostly sweetwess in the form of sugar and fruit. Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. A very nice strong Belgian pale ale."
"This beer is an odd one, and certainly worth a try. The smell and taste of this beer remind me of playing in apple orchards in Sebastopol CA when i was a kid, plenty of brown apples on the ground."
"Drinkabilty- i am hammmered."
"Served in my Westmalle glass while I watch the Brewers come back and defeat the Braves, I'd have to say life is pretty good."
"Belgian ale creation"
"Looked clear and yellow as it poured from the bottle, but was a darker orangish, almost tan color in the glass. Looked like an IPA. No hops in the nose, though; the only smell was sweet alcohol. The taste is buttery and yeasty, but no malt flavors and almost no hops at all. Certainly doesn't fit my idea of an IPA, more like a Belgian tripel."
"This is one of the great beers that I can never get sick of... ever!! It is light in color, a dry finish, with a huge alcohol presence. It is listed as 10.5%, but after talking to Jef Versale of Van Steenberge, it ranges between 9% to 14%. So it is always a surprise where it might take you. Plus, after a Piraat, everything gets better...PRAAT!"
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a huge head  and nice lacing. The smell is sweet and hoppy with a touch of sourness. The taste is fruity and spicy mixed with hops and sourness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. While drinking at a warmer temperature helps, the flavors do not seem to blend well and therefore, does not make this a highly drinkable beer."
"D: This isn't the most drinkable beer because of all the alcohol. It's definitely a sipping beer, I think it would be a nice after dinner sipper. I really did enjoy this beer though, it was a pleasure to drink."
"Chewy and warming. This beer would be ideal with pork knuckle... enough spirit & fruit to cut through the fat, and hold it's own."
"Looks good and drinkable. Aroma has strong fruity overtones, making it smell almost like a cider rather than an ale. Taste is strongly fruity, as well as malty with quite a bite of bitter. I had a rather small bottle, but it was all I needed to sample this brew and rate it. A nice jazzy ale that is a pleasure to drink."
"drinkability is good. a touch sweet, but that balances the alcohol fairly well. fairly simple and straightforward, but enjoyable. don't really get any ""ipa"" out of this, so it loses taste/aroma points for that."
"Served in a small bottle the pour was a nice creamy golden color. There was a slight foam on top, more than I am used to in Belgian beers. This is the first Belgian IPA that I have tried and enjoyed it. It seemed very similar to a Belgian strong pale ale with extra something (hops?). It has a crisp strong taste that was flavorful. It was enjoyable, but the strong bite never calmed down so it may become overwhelming if I had too much."
"Certainly an interesting beer worth trying for the Belgian ale aficionado, but I probably won't have this again unless a friend wants to try it too. The flavors are a bit too intense, slightly unbalanced, and not entirely to my liking. For me it's merely a novelty."
"D  Very drinkable and little trace of the 10.5% ABV in the taste. Recommended."
"Overall: A good 'Belgian IPA' but i'd rather have a Hoblen Chouffe Triple IPA instead which is a better example of the style, imo."
"This beer pours a golden colour with a large fluffy head. the smell is of spiced yeast and fresh fruit. Alcohol is dominant in the taste, esters are also present as well as a hint of grass. The mouthfeel is too aggresive for me, far too gassy making this beer undrinkable for me."
"Drinkability: Slightly disappointing, unfortunately. I was surprised by the relative lack of hops character and the overwhelming cidery-ness. Alcohol too high and flavor not enjoyable enough to drink much at a time."
"Really gentle pour didnt yield much head. Spotty lacing that isnt much to write about. The color is a hazy straw yellow. First sip is extreme being over 10 ABV. Damn, it hits you but isn't that bad after a few more. The aroma is very different not just for an IPA but for any beer i've ever smelt. It has a candy-like banana smell like a wheat beer. Hops are tasted on the finish for just a second. It leaves a short-lived bitterness. Very good Belgian IPA, but I cannot see myself drinking more than one of these at any given sitting. This would be good after a nice dinner with a cigar. Nicely carbonated with balanced body. The high ABV makes swallowing difficult. Very different from the IPA's I drink."
"Mouthfeel is sugary, sweet up front, moderately smooth, along with a dose of pepper and coriander with a bitterness that touches the back of the tongue on the swallow."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice white head that dissipated into a small cap that left some nice lacing. The smell is Belgian. Candi sugar, spice, a bit of pepper and corriander. There is quite a bit going on in the taste department. Starts off sweet and spicy, followed by alcohol, and ending with dry hops. The feel is tightly carbonated, moderate body, a bit bitter/dry. A very unique brew, it has some boldness to it but balances in the end. The noticable alcohol feel would limit me to a few."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. It's a very interesting experiance. I find I'm starting to like Belgian ales a lot!!!"
"Wow- love the pairing of belgian yeast and IPA style. Sweet spicy yeast character works wonders on the slightly resinous and piney hop profile. The brew works on so many levels- just when you think its a fruity belgian, it comes back with the slick and powerful IPA hops and malt. Alcohol is apparent, but doesnt take away from the flavor factor. Ends sticky fruity with great hops- perfect with a plate of frittes and spicy mayo."
"After seeing this brew for years I thought I would give it a try. I am not sure if it was the bottle that I had or what but I think that this was a very tough drink, just did not set right with me for some reason. It was poured to a somewhat hazy colored yellow with a smallish white hard that broke down quite quickly bur did leave a trace of lacing at the top of the glass. The aromas seemed to be complex, which really intrigued me, had fruit like lemon, spices, and a sweet property. So with the aroma, I was really thinking that this was going to be one of my great beers but the taste seemed to hold something that was very tough to take in. Upfront the taste was good with a sweet property and some spices piping through but then at the tail end I got this rough taste that I would imagine would be a mix hop and alcohol that was tough to finish. From the way it looks I am in the minority here but I felt that this brew was extremely tough to drink, and overall not very good. Again, it I am in the minority here so take this review with a grain of salt. Will I try it again, yeah will do that because this review is based on a single experience. Will update the review if I have a different perspective."
"From a stubby bottle the pour yields a hazy, honey-colored ale with a three-finger, sudsy top. Tiny, streaming bubbles of carbonation are present. The smell is super bready/yeasty-sort of like the smell you get when cutting into a fresh loaf of sourdough, with a hint of honeysuckle and malty sweetness. Taste is also yeasty, with some estery qualities and a bit boozy too. Finishes on the dry side with a tinge of bitterness and detectable alcohol. Mouthfeel is grainy with good carbonation and a fuller body. Piraat is always easy to drink and perhaps too easy because the abv will catch up to you and before you know it you're three sheets gone. Make sure you're safe at home if you plan on putting a few of these down."
"Taste follows up the promise of the smell...some soft fruity sweetness up front, with solid hoppy bitterness from start to finish. Lingering floral tangy bitterness hangs on for a while. Really quite well done. Improves and balances out with some time warming in the glass--the first swallows while cold were a bit harsh, sour, and too bitter...give it time and the components meld well. A somewhat challenging brew yet continually interesting, you keep wanting to drink more to see what the next sip will taste like. The high ABV integrates well, the strong hops hide the alcohol. Be careful!"
"The idea of a Belgian IPA is like a dream come true for me. After trying Offshore's divine Hop Goddess and many bottles of Chouffe's IPA tripel, I had to give this one a shot. Each of these gems represent a unique take on a neophyte hybrid style and all should be highly sought after."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy light yellow color with an immense sparkling white very dense head. Smell is not too intense, but is of Belgian sugars, and slightly of hops. Taste is similar to the nose; taste is initially sweet with Belgian sugars, transitions to a light hoppy taste with a slightly alcoholic, dry finish. I have to say though I would never guess that there is 10.5% present, well covered. Beer is medium-full bodied with tons of tongue stinging carbonation. This beer is very drinkable and with the ABV, watch out! Definitely a must try."
"Pours a crystal ckear gold color with a huge bright white champaign like head that recedes quite quickly although does leave a bit of lacing towards the bottom. Smells of sugary malts, a hint of citrus, coriander, and a nice smell of hops that seems to hold all the scents together. Wow lots of flavors going on in this one, starts off with a sugary bubblegum malt flavor that quickly leads way to a surprisingly bitter hop taste that balances out the sweetness quite nicely and finishes with a nice warm buttery malt flavor that lets the alcohol give it's kick. Sips nicely as it's carbonated a bit high but it seems just right for this beer and isn't overly watery or oily. Overall I'm diggin it and glad I picked it up, a good beer to sit back on a weekend night and relax with!"
"Mouthfeel was very solid and certainly full-bodied. I was pleased, overall, with this one. I could possibly buy this again."
"Purchased in the van Steenburge sampler box along with Gulden Draak and four other brews. Apart from the creative label, which strangely juxtaposes a 17th-18th-century Caribbean pirate with a classic Viking longboat, this was a disappointing brew. It pours a nice cloudy amber and has a mildly hoppy flavor. You can also sense the power of the high alcoholic content, which most Belgian Ambers do not posses. Still, it does not overwhelmingly surpass other Belgian Ambers or IPAs in my opinion to warrant the costly price. A good beer nonetheless, but nothing I would buy again unless I was watching a pirate/Viking marathon on the History Channel."
"The is a reasonably good Belgian ale. It pours a bit mily bronze with a nice fluffy head that thins to some nice lacing and a crown. Good carbonation too. The smell is sweet and betrays to potent 10.5% ABV. The taste is sweet, with a nice balacne of hops and malts, with some definite fruit esters. A well balanced, and it bites on the swallow. The mouthfell is clean and crips, but one is usually my limit."
"Thank you, Flanders."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is pretty strong in this one."
"I like this beer, I'm looking forward to trying the other five in this package."
"Poured out a light golden color, opaque, with a strong, fluffy off white head. The nose is full of citrus, then malt, followed by ginger and honey. The taste offers lemon zest, malt, fruity esters, sharp bitterness and finally alcohol. The mouthfeel is creamy, with decent carbonation. The alcohol is a bit much if you're planning on making a night out of one beer."
"Fairly drinkable, especially considering the huge alcohol content. Alcohol is well concealed, and mostly reveals itself as a slight warming sensation. Could be sessionable, but i suspect the hangover after a night of Piraats would be nasty. While im glad to have tried it that was probably enough for me"
"D-- Too good for a beer with this ABV. Sweet."
"Bottle: Poured a deep yellow color ale with a huge poured white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of alcohol is a bit too intense for my liking with some good malt backbone and lots of sugar. Taste is very sweet with a subtle burning sensation from the alcohol. Body is slightly below average with too much filtration and alcohol is too intense. Yeast is quite discreet and sweet too present. This one is definitely not to my liking."
"Drinkability: A really tasty and fairly strong Belgian Strong Pale Ale. If you want to know what phenolic esters taste like , try this one on for size. But seriously , this is a great beer - try it."
"Flavor intensified as the beer warmed, and more components came through. A bit of an earthy pine oil surfaced, with toasted nuts and more sugar. I could definitely taste the phenols too by the end. One that I would have again."
"D- This beer is smooth that starts sweet with a nice alcohol finish. This would be a great desert beer."
"I liked this one a lot. It was a good drink while sitting around with friends after work. One of few beers that I consider not having another, not because I didn't like it, but because one may have been enough. It's strong, but I had another anyway."
"D - I dunno. Not my favorite. Certainly it's flavourful with lots of nuances, but the carbonation and bitterness are like sledgehammers. Lacks balance."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Not too sweet or malty. Even with the noticeable alcohol, it still goes down well."
"I would recommend it and try it again!"
"Light bronze in colour with strong carbonation. Aromas are of light caramel malts, banana, corn sugar, and alcohol. Warming and boozy, with flavors of tropical fruits, herbal hops, gala apple, and a bit more banana. The carbonation and high attenuation keeps this beer from getting too cloying, but it lacks a certain amount of complexity to make it anything more than an average strong Belgian ale."
"Interestingly, one side of the bottle says 9% alcohol, the front side says 10.5%. I rather believe in the later. This is a great beer."
"Sort of musty looking amber caramel color. Smells of apple, citrus, pilsner malt, alcohol, spice and a tinge of hops. Dangerously carbonated, the head was so hard to control on this one. Huge fluffy head that slowly dissipates, lingers on the edges and leaves minor lacing. Taste is fluffy on the tongue hints of coriander, malt, a little fruit and a tiny tinge of bitterness. This is nice, makes me think of fall. The alcohol warmth is nice, but only allows for a few. Unfortunately because of the availability and price it might be a while before I have this again, but it is a very nice BSPA."
"From a 750mL bottle and served in a snifter. Poured with a thick and frothy head. The thick head died down very quickly to a thin white foam head that stayed for the entire glass. The color is an opaque honey. The smell was peppery and very alcoholic. The taste is peppery as well, with a note of pineapple. The aftertaste was decently hoppy, but not overly bitter or dry. I was surprised that the taste wasn't very alcoholic considering the 10.5% abv and the smell. Has a nice frothy mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Its very drinkable, but maybe not more than one in a row. It sits pretty heavy in the stomach due to the carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer. I would definitely buy it again. Wondering where to find it in smaller bottles cause the 750mL seems a lot for one sitting. Plus, its got a pirate on the bottle. Pirates are totally better than ninjas!"
" Flavorful and complex. This is something for special occasions for me. It is highly drinkable, but I would not last too long trying to session with this kind of ABV."
"Many years ago, when I was meddling with illegal pirate radio transmitters, this was my beer of choice. And I loved it! At the time ABV was a whopping 11.5%, which was unusual as it was very drinkable with the heavy alcohol way in the background, almost not present at all. Then ABV was brought down to 10.5%. This did not change the character of Piraat much. It was still a very enjoyable, nice sweetly tripel. Maybe this was the best version they made, and which I enjoyed on a brewery trip about ten years ago. Currently ABV is only a paltry 9.0%, a reduction that the beer did not survive. While still not a bad tripel it is now average, the taste having acquired a watery blandness that was not present with the previous versions. I now only purchase it if nothing else is available."
"Smells sweet, yeasty and hoppy. Murky yellow body with very thick off-white head. One thing I do like about this one as opposed to some Belgians is how the head does not overflow quite as easily as many. Tons of lacing, typical of a Belgian... Sweet - citrus and pine definitely present. Alcohol noticeable but not overpowering like some beers of this high an abv or even lower. Very good. Flavorful, but smooth and mild. Pretty good. Similar to La Fin Du Monde, but less earthy and less overwealming. Not sure Id pay 11$ per bottle all the time, but not bad, definitely worth the try."
"D :: Pretty good. A very special drink. I'd only want one or two in a sitting."
"Pours into the tulip extremely clear golden yellow, with 2 inches of foamy thin head and fine lace. Smells of strong spicy alcohol, yeast, sweet malts, black pepper, tropical fruits (banana, pineapple). Tastes of somewhat sour medicinal alcohol at the front, becomes gently rounded with pineapple fruit in the center and finish. Medium body with fairly big carbonation. A mediocre strong ale in my opinion."
"Piraat ale was a hazy golden amber color with a large white rocky head. The head had good retention a left lots of lace. The aroma was yeasty and sort of peppery with some light malt mixed in. The taste was somewhat spicy with the alcohol evident and a warming finish. This beer has a medium body and high carbonation level. This is a highly drinkable beer, but the alcohol keeps you from having more than a couple. An excellent beer, I will definately purchace again."
"Drinkability - The alcohol is deceiving, as you can't really smell it but boy can you ever taste it. From the first part of the taste it rears its head in a big way. This is the only thing that makes this brew a definite sipper and therefore lowers its overall drinkability."
"This is a great beer. I poured it from a 750ml bottle, corked and caged. It has a golden color with a slight amber tint. The head was thick and frothy, stiffly ascending above the lip of my tulip glass with substantial retention. The bouquet is full of a blend of spice and fruit, most notably cinnamon and orange, along with subtle warm not of yeast. The taste is similar to the boquet, again with a strong citrus presence, acidic on the front, a slight but pleasant burst of alchohol on the back. The beer is wonderfully carbonated, full yet vibrant simultaneously. It is exceedingly drinkable--a party in my mouth."
"Dull gold murky appearance  nice head however the head does not last long nose is sour milk and raw dough, flowers, and caramel  medium body  initial taste is sweet then turns acidic, and dried apricotish - aftertaste is medium with a creamy, acidic and alcohol Dull gold murky appearance  nice head however the head does not last long nose is sour milk and raw dough, flowers, and caramel  medium body  initial taste is sweet then turns acidic, and dried apricotish - aftertaste is medium with a creamy, acidic and alcohol"
"D - Not bad. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Drinkability ABV does hit you and its not suttle"
"Drinkability is inhibited strongly by the ABV not hidden very well"
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a massive, merengue like white head that retains impeccably...absolutely perfect. The aroma has some tropical fruits upfront, along with biscuity malt, curacao, floral hops, candy sugar and a touch of alcohol. The flavor has some tropical fruit notes upfront, as well as some spices (corriander and curacao), candy sugar, some floral hops, alcohol and some metallic notes. The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than expected and carbonation is low; drinkability is ok. An interesting BSPA, the alcohol is concealed well enough but the complexity just isnt there."
"This beer nearly overcame my tastebuds. Absolutely packed with flavour. Sweet but not cloying, like a fine chocolate. The sweetness starts off fruity but reveals a more nutty and chocolately layer. Spiciness as well, perhaps a little clove. There's a little bit of apple/pear flavour in here too. Earthy hops try to balance out the sweetness, but the scales tip on the side of the more sweet and spicy notes. As I said before, not cloying in the least though. A lovely malty/yeastiness comes to light as the beer warms and it becomes more comforting. There's a lot of alcohol in this one, but it really serves to enhance all the flavours inherent here. Mouthfeel is near-perfect. Bites the tongue a bit but the flavours sparkle all over the tongue. A bit thick and so intense. So drinkable, a truly great sipping beer, and a classic Belgian. This would make a perfect after-dinner drink or nightcap."
"After resisting for quite some time because I thought the bottle version was way too alcoholic, hot, and spicy, I decided to order the tap version. Though very similar to the bottled version with it's fruity, spicy, and Belgian-y characters, the fruits seem riper and fresher in flavor. The alcohols seem to hide behind better creaminess, fuller body, and a rounder malt flavor. Don't get me wrong, the beer is very hot and spicy, but alcohols are not all I taste when on tap. A good alternative to Duvel and Tremens."
"This is a sipping beer to get drunk with....it's good and very complex and tasty, but each taste brings just a little more feel of alcohol buzz."
"I had tried this months ago, when I was just starting to figure out Belgian beer, and I remember being more overwhelmed than appreciative. This time, it blew me away. A new addition to my regulars."
"I drank this with no preconceptions, but I was still surprised by the muscular malt character. Sure, there is a touch of peppery spice, but it's the grain at the fore. Balance is not the way here, nor should it be. A strapping ABV is wide open and mighty warming, and a caution if there ever was one. Still, while one is the wisest choice, it's one that does itself reasonably proud."
"This is a nice strong golden Belgian beer that I will certainly visit again."
"Likeable strong pale ale, but not as balenced as say Duvel."
"Overall, this was quite a flavorful and refreshing beer."
"Given that most of my drinking experience over the past few months has consisted of running down the Best of BA list and drinking whatever I can find that sounds at least moderately appealing, this one wasn't all that impressive. However, from a less biased perspective, it is a pretty tasty and complex beer, relatively drinkable for its alcohol content. Since it's hard to find (at least in my experience) and generally shares the shelf with some much finer offerings, I don't foresee myself having it again any time soon, but if it happens to pop up on tap somewhere, I'll be sure to pay my respects."
"750 ml bottle."
"Poured golden clear with no head. Nice and shiny. Nose was a slight bit of everything. Some spices, cherries and apples. Flavor was ctrong in dried apples and candied cherries. Malts give the beer a solid sweet backbone. Bit of heat from alcohol. Tingles the tongue a bit from the heat. Just a tad too syrupy though. Nice and drinkable with a hit from the alcohol."
"Poured a dark gold/copper color with quite a bit of haze. Head settled quickly. Smell was at first malt, then rubbing alcohol. Taste was about the same, some sweetness on the front, followed by a blast of alcohol. As I struggled through the glass, I seemed to also get a grassy aftertaste. My final thought was that the beer left me feeling like I had gargled with alcohol. It seemed to improve a little bit as it warmed (taste mellowed), but it's also possible that my tastebuds were just pummeled into senselessness. Mouthfeel was OK (I think). Drinkability - well I didn't pour it out, but I am not happy that I have a second one. Are you beginning to get the idea I didn't like this beer? Looking at the other reviews, I may have gotten a skunked beer. Since I have a second, I will, as a service to beerkind, try it again."
"Cloudy yellowy straw-like look in the glass, with a strong white lasting head. Sweet smell of grapes, which makes the wine flavoring make sense. I'm also tasting a very strong liquorice and alcohol flavor. The high ABV is quite noticeable. This one is more sip-able than drinkable. The alcohol is too pronounced in the flavor for me, and while the sweetness helps to balance it a bit, in the end I have to give the drinkability just a 3.0 rating."
"This is a meal of a brew. I am enjoying this bottle, but one will be enough."
"pretty good drinkability, just a little too sweet maybe. good though."
"After reviewing this beer, I have to say that this is a beer on it's own and deserves an unbiased review. Pretty good stuff, but not as good as a Duvel!"
"Overall: at 10.5% ABV, you're certainly not going to overlook the alcohol. Bubbly carbontation and champagne-like texture are the obvious pluses of this one, but the growing candy flavors overtake it eventually, which is a disappointment. Bought as part of a Belgium sample pack, I wouldn't hesitate to try it again. After this undertaking, though, I'm not terribly impressed. Lot of foreplay with little stamina..."
"Body is medium but feels bigger. Fluffy, expansive mouthfeel with airy fluffed merangue texture. Great mouthfeel, although as it warms, the estery alcoholic heat detracts a bit. Need a few years to dry out."
"-Oelergud"
"a very drinkable brew, a true pleasure and would get a 5 in the drinkability department if it weren't for the high ABV"
"Very distinctive stuff. I never found the alcohol overwhelming, though there is always the impression of its strength. I'd say this would make for a fine dessert beer."
"The alcohol was really the only drawback. I didn't mind it very much, but it gives the beer a bit of a nail polish remover bouquet. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Plenty of body with a slick, creamy mouthfeel and almost too easy to drink make this a dangerously delicious offering from where else...Belgium, go figure!."
"This belgian brew pours from the bottle a cloudy golden color. The head is a monstrosity. Good golly it is the largest head ever! After 10 minutes I was finally able to get the glass full. The smell is hoppy, malty, and citrus (with slight alcohol undertones). The carbonation carries up inot the nose. The taste certainly conveys the alcohol content of this beer, but in a plesant manner. The mouthfeel is smooth on the palate and a bit sticky on the tongue with a slight lingering of alcohol. This is a descent brew worthy of your attention. Give it a go, but beware the moderately high ABV."
"Poured a golden slightly hazy honey color. Thick white cap that fell into deep taverns, and settled to a 1/4 inch cap. Aroma was sweet esters of ripe banana, apple, and citrus. Root beer, cloves, and yeast were in the nose lightly. A little alcohol was apparant in nose as well. Flavor was fruity sweet with banana and apple at first with a little grapefuit citrusy background. Some pepper and spice filled the palate as it became more grapefruit and the alcohol came out in taste. Good blend of sweet and bitter with a hanging bitterness at back of tounge. Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing during drink, and finishes dry and warm."
"Drinkability is great, the beer is crisp, refreshing and fruity, but still soft."
"Poured a lovely golden color with massive chunky white head. Head lasted throughout and nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is truly enjoyable with nice notes of summer fruits, bananas, bubble-gum, and yeast. Taste is also very pleasant with strong banana and other light fruit flavors. Nice and creamy in the mouth with an almost syrup like feeling being left behind. Some alcohol detected, but not what you would think for a 10.5% beer. Way too easy to drink. Very enjoyable beer."
"10/14/06 - revised review and scoring based on recent tasting: I still love this beer very much after not having one for nearly 6 months!"
"Overall i was pretty impressed with the beer. I think it is way different that what Im used to (Double IPAs, Imperial Stouts, Barleywine etc.) but could see myself getting attached to it if I had the money!"
"Light yellow amber with a thin off white head. Carbonation is light. Smells of cereal, light caramel, a hint of citrus and booze. Taste/MF are slightly acidic, well hopped, very dry, and strongly alcoholic. Mild corn flavors are also present. I find the citric acid to be a bit much in this beer because it isnt balanced by any strongly pleasant citrus flavors. Finishes sweet and thick. Body is full. Drinkability is low."
"The smell was delicious. A combination of fruity, wheaty, tropical aroma tempered by a prominent (but pleasant) alcohol finish. It is hard for me to describe the taste because it is so new and unique to me, but I would say the flavor is full-bodied, balanced, and citrusy. To sum it up, delicious, alcoholic honey. It is quite strong, though, as one beer consumed in about 25 minutes went straight to the dome. The mouthfeel is cider-like. On drinkability, I found it to go down easy, but not a beer that one can drink repeatedly in succession."
"11.2 oz bottle with no visible freshness date. Pours a deep gold/ hazy almost amber with a huge head, good lonvity and very nice lace. Grassy and earthy aromas mixed with a sweet honey like malt. A bit citrusy and apple. Big yeast flavors mixed with sugar, citrus and apple. Hos are present, but not predominate. Alcoholic and warming. A truly tasty beer but not one for a 75 degree day in March. A definate winter beer. Very good none the less."
"D - Although I'm not a big fan of Belgians as a whole - either drinking them more often has helped me acquire the taste for them or I drink better Belgians as time goes on. Fortunately I bought the 11.2oz bottle so I'll be able to go back to work later tonight."
"Taste is a lot like Duvel. Spicy with bananas and pineapple, and a lot more carbonation than expected. Thick, coating mouthfeel and almost no aftertaste, which is a nice change. Quite a well balanced beer, although it didn't really stand out as something unique for me."
"Being a fan of huge American style IPAs, this was one of my first steps out of my comfort zone of mind-numbingly hopped IPAs. I dont think Id drink it on a regular basis, but it is fairly drinkable despite its massive alcohol."
"I'm under the impression my first bottle had something wrong with it. The second time around, this beer is much easier to drink and looks a whole lot better to boot! My last bottle had very large yeast flakes floating around- way too many, it seemed, for a little 11.2oz bottle. My presumption has proved correct, as this bottle had only mild yeast floaties, and tasted a hell of a lot better. Very refreshing for 10.5% abv, an excellent example of a Belgian strong pale. I can't say the brew is very complex, but it tastes wonderful for what it is. I'd like to try this on tap, as I recently had the Boucanier on tap and it was much tastier than it's bottled brother."
"Drinkability: Again, strand me on a desert island, this is the one i'd want with me. But due to its hefty alcohol volume, it's one of those beers that is meant to be savoured, not swilled. One or two in a sitting is all one would need. Great Beer. Bottom Line."
"Drinkability- One of the sweeter beers I have had from this style. Very warming as it should be at almost 11%. Tangy and tasty. A sipper and not one to be slammed down. Allow this one to warm and take your time. Goes well with Inidan food....chicken korma in particular."
"Drinkability: Not feeling the 10.5% at all. I suppose the better stronger beers end up hiding it well, though. I paid around $4 for the bottle, which I think is now well worth it. Lots of balance, flavor, and clean sipping. Very enjoyable. Beyond impressed with this overall."
"Light gold with a faint haze and bright white head. It poured with huge, fluffy foam that showed good retention and lacing. Aromas of pear and lemon to start. These lead into bready yeast and alcohol that's a little bit forward, but balanced well. Significant sweetness in the flavour with pepperiness throughout. Low bitterness initially, but it becomes stronger towards the finish. Light fruitiness. Alcohol appears at the end. Medium bodied, generous carbonation, off-dry with a hint of slickness. The alcohol could be hidden better, but there's a lot of it to hide. Still, pretty solid."
"Overall: I'm glad I bought the smaller bottle as I'm not sure I'd be able to stand on my own had I needed to polish off a 750ml by myself. If you're a fan of Belgians, though, this one is worth a try."
"D- alcohol pretty well hidden, but it does hit you after a bit. Overall its not as complex as I want out of a belgian. Reminiscent of a good wheat beer."
"Scarce drinkability, too much alcohol."
"By the way, have pirates EVER drunk tripel?"
" Taste is more alcoholic than I remembered from the draft version, but this has subsided now that I have finished over half of the 750 ml. The flavor contains banana, is bready, and is definitely sweet. Mouthfeel is nice, mildly carbonated with big bubbles. Watch out for this one. Finished this in less than an hour. I remember the days when this was my fallback beer at Chalkies. Well, it was this or Gulden Draak, both on tap at all times. Those were the days."
"Very drinkable. Not much hop presence."
"Very good, not as sweet as I prefer but not bad."
"Overall and enjoyable and drinkable brew. High ABV not even really noticeable until it was gone and I had to try and type."
"Drinkability: While not the best BSPA you're likely to run across, reasonably priced, tasty and quite potent -- you could do worse."
"This is a beast of a beer. My cheeks are burning, my mouth is watering, and I wish I'd bought more. Yum!"
"D: Good. Approachable, but the alcohol taste begins to turn me off."
"Bham UK Jan 2006"
"The alcohol presence is extremely understated and very well hidden. This could be a very dangerous session Belgian at 10.5%abv."
"Overall = A decent Belgian pale ale. I recommend it for fans of the style."
"Very good example of the type - I look forward to doing some one-on-one comparisons between Piraat and Duvel."
" all in all, a unique take on the tripel style. The higher alcohol is a bit much here, as it worked better in gulden draake. certainly a great beer to have time and again."
"Piraat is better than the average BSPA, but has a long, long way to go to be mentioned in the same breath with the greats of the style. It lacks that *certain something* that puts a twinkle in my eye and a spring in my step, but I still had a good time with the bottle. Watch out for that ABV. It'll plunder your booty if you aren't careful."
"D - I had been wanting to try this one for some time and finally picked up a single from a store while on vacation. This one was everything I expected it to be, although maybe ever so slightly sweeter than I thought. A good representation of the pale Belgian style ... I recommend and will have it again."
"This is an impressive brew. Although it is a little more aggressive than the standard. Very enjoyable."
"Bottomline: a little lacking in the nose, but otherwise a very nice Belgian strong pale ale. Perhaps I served it a little too cool to allow the aroma to develop properly."
"Overall: Not a beer I'd repeat. Totally disappointing, 100% forgettable to everything except my pocketbook. If I want a booze bomb, well, I suppose its all-right, but, that's what distilled alcohol is for . ."
"This beer came a slightly cloudy yet glowing golden yellow with a meringue like head that was perfectly flat with no discernable bubbles. There were a swarm of tiny bubbles lazily making their way to the top of the tulip glass. Smelled of marshmallows with lots of bubble gum, banana and oranges and a touch of black pepper. Tasted creamy with an intense powdered sugar sweetness, coupled with a green grape sourness and a touch of celery. There is a lovely spicy yeast finish on the roof of my mouth in the finish. Also, I cant detect a lick of alcohol. The mouth feel is very dense and viscous that is entirely too syrupy. This really detracts from the drinkability as it makes one think of green grape concentrate. A little too thick to be enjoyed, but if you can separate the mouth feel from the flavor, youre in for a treat."
"Teaser reckons that it gets yucky as it heats up, and I agree that the alcohol becomes a little too much. Sadly not a beer as good as its cousin the Boucanier but still ok."
"A near perfect brew, totally in league with Duvel and other great Belgians. Poured out to a rich golden color with a pillow of white cloud like foam that was well lived. Nice lacing. High level of carbonation. Aromas of rich, sweet malts, yeast, grass and grain. Very fresh and lively smelling. Taste was quite good; flavors of malts, grain, dough, and yeast meet the palate in good balance, along with pineapple flavors and sweet citrus. Smooth aftertaste. Good mouthfeel, light and medium bodied, yet slightly chewy toward the finish. Very good level of drinkability. This will be in my fridge again soon. Highly Recommended Belgian."
"Really, this is too much of a good thing. The powerful punch of alcohol is not really balanced by strong flavors or smells. This is like a beer flavored after dinner drink. One 11.2 oz bottle is enough for me--tasty in an expiremental way."
"Sigh...I'll let myself out."
"D - I really like this one. It is an intense ride for sure, but well worth it. Worth the price tag? That is a tough call. If the option presents itself, then I will definitely have this again, but I don't think it will for a very long time."
"The contents 330 ml brown bottle were poured into a snifter. Color is deep hazy orange, nearly opaque even when held to light. Light contoured white head with good lacing. Earthy citrus nose. This is a big beer, not nearly as sweet as many Belgian strong ales; starts with some grainy malts, middle opens into liquorices root, finishes with aniseed and a return to the crisp citrus detected in the smell. Warm and fuzzy, Piraat triple is quite drinkable for its alcohol content and style."
"Drinkable, but strong. Make this your night cap."
"Overall, i love Belgians, but this is not one of them. Good but a little too much alcohol in your face."
"cheers..."
"Overall - A top notch Belgian pale ale.... one of the best. Highly recommended..."
" Here it is a detriment, the same way it ruins, IMHO, Dolle Teve. Just a thought- drop it to 7-8%. Or find a way to mask it."
"Pours a dark golden color with a relatively thin fluffy head leaving quite sticky and fine white lace. Nose is a complex mixture of spices, malts, and somewhat fruity. Taste is very malty and sugary at the beginning, with the belgian yeast and fruityness in the middle with a warming alcoholic smooth finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin but is nice and lively. Overall frinkability is OK, the ABV is very present at the beginning and takes some getting used to. I'm glad I tried it but it is a bit expensive."
"An excellent beer I just wish it wasn't so carbonated."
"Arrrrhhh!! keep the Piraat, I will take Duval."
"330 ml bottle. This beer pours out hazy yellow with a small head. Sugary fruity aroma. Smells like pineapple orange juice. Sweet malty flavor. Very fruity, perhaps a little too much. Finishes with some spicy hops. I would like this more if the hops were more assertive. The alcohol content is high, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is average. This beer had a very strange flavor. It wasn't bad, but I doubt this is a beer I will buy again."
"Overall, Piraat was pretty tasty and a nice pairing with a dinner of seasoned swordfish steaks, rice and a garden salad. My wife liked the draft version she had a couple weeks ago better, saying this one was a bit too sweet. I'd have to agree but it's still a worthwhile version of a Belgian strong pale ale."
"unbelievable beer. White frothy head. Fruity taste that is balanced by some truly light and powerfull hops....I've had this in the bottle many times but today I had this on tap at the library ale house in santa monica....so excited to have a beer I love on tap and hard to find...orange color with a meaty head that retreats somewhat quickly...taste is a strong belgian yeast with some fruity (Apricot/plum) taste...you gotta try it to believe it ...especially on tap."
"From the Belgium sampler pack. 330 ml/11.2 oz bottle, 10.5% ABV. Pours an amber or orangish color with a gargantuan white head of various sized bubbles which fades slowly. The head can only be described as sudsy. Lots of bubbles in the pour, with some yeast visible at the end of the bottle. Vaguely fruity nose with barley. Taste is sweet and quite reminiscent of a decent mead. Definite alcohol bite detracts. Theres a nice acid bite as well, though. Bubbly, watery mouthfeel. Alcohol finish with a bite, not too pronounced. Overall like an average mead unusual but not remarkable. I dont see where the 88 rating comes from. Perhaps its too alcohol/yeastish/meadish for me."
"Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a mammoth white head. Aroma is very complex: fruity, buttery, spicy. The taste is dominated by a high alcohol presence. I like a slight warming of the back of the throat from high alcohol beers, but this beer burns. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fairly good beer, but I've had belgain strong pales that are a lot better than this one."
"A very pale golden color with amber around the sides. Large egg white head sits atop this beer. Sticky lacing is formed as I drink it. Aroma is of pineapple and spices and there's a yeasty quality to it. Somewhat acidic as well. Flavor brings a Belgian candi sugar sweetness upfront followed by a yeasty bready content. Hops are quite noticeable and stronger than most Belgians I have encountered. Finish has an alcohol drying linger to it. Nicely done but nothing amazing about this offering. I am surprised to see this beer is 10.5% abv, seems like 8% at most."
"Mouthfeel is quite thick but the carbonation is a tad too high...it helps calm the alcohol, but I'd rather have the burn w/ out effervescence. Nice bitter finish and very clean...quite drinkable for the style. I will look for this one on tap...I believe I've seen it at Redbones once or twice...will need to compare."
"Drinkability: Clean and refreshing. This beer is an old favorite that I have had many times and finally decided to take notes and review it. I also think this beer is an excellent beer to give people who are now to good beer. It's not offensive at all and it is very gentle and welcoming to new palates."
"This was my first above 6% beer, WOW excellent. It poured a golden yellow with a huge head. Not sure if this is right, but that's what happend. Waited a little while for head to dissipate. Taste was kind of sweet, alcohol was definitely present, but not overwhelming. The aftertaste was very nice, kind of gave me a warm feeling. For a brew with a high abv, it was very drinkable. Will buy more in the very near future."
"Recommended for the sweet-loving Belgian heads out there, but for some people, such as myself, who love the well-roundedness of beers such as St. Bernardus or the trappist brewers, this can be a bit too much."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle pours a bright cloudy golden with a decent off white head of large bubbles that leaves some lacing in my glass. Bready, fruity citrus and spice aromas, fruity pear, apple, lemon and spicy flavors. Full bodied with a mildly carbonated, smooth mouthfeel, sweet finish with alcohol present, very drinkable for the alcohol content."
"We got a winner here mates, I lift me tankard to this one and will drink it with all the bravado a swarthy pirate of the Carribean can muster."
"I found the mouthfeel to be a bit course. Possibly from the abv and carbonation. I might have another after this one."
"I think I like it a little more than duvel but it's close."
"I personally am not bowled over by the beer."
"Came in a 33cl stubby brown bottle with best before date 07/2006. The appearance is a deep cloudy golden color with a real thick head poured into its traditional glass. Not nearly as complex as its similar counterpart Duvel and the alcohol content isnt as well masked either. Still it gave a warm pleasant feel to the stomach afterwards so its worth a try if you are bold enough to try."
"A fantastic belgian pale ale, nice crisp hops really pick everything up. A very tasty beer"
"Drinkability: Far to sweet to be an IPA and far too weird to be pleasant."
"looks like Duvel and drinks like Duvel but shiver my timbers it is not Duvel. Piraat is a decent take on the Blonde genre and suffers a little bit from the intial alcohol taste that hits the palate too early. The beer mellows more the further you drain the glass. A decent beer but alas lacks the complexity and grace that Duvel provides."
"Well I'm almost sure this is the right beer Piraat on the label, Brouwerij Van Steenberge, 10.5% alcohol...but amber triple IPA? I think that is a misprint. The beer I have is a straw yellow color with a slight yeast cloud and a solid whit head. It has a great spicey yeast aroma, peppery with perhaps a little corriander, balanced with mild floral hop and sweet malt. The flavor is well balanced, slightly bitter with a good amount of sweet malt, with a wheat malt and yeast finish. The body is good, and it seems to hide the 10.5% well, this is a smooth beer. This beer seems like the textbook definition of a trippel, and based on that I think it is a good example of the style."
"The smell was characteristic of american IPAs I've tried, malty, with a sort of fruity sweetness and a blend of alcohol within. decieving, because the flavour wasn't quite as much: I'd say the basic american IPA comparison point wouldn't be the first part in the tasting (a sweet, fruity and bread like sweetness, even possibly a tripel or a belgian pale), but rather the harsh (in a good way) bitterness coming right behind it. The only beef I have is that it overwhelms the rest of the beer's properties and makes it less drinkable. All in all, though, a good purchase."
"This triple pours a nice amber gold. A thick never ending white head meet the top of this beer and give way to a nice thick lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is sweet malt and with a grassy musty feel to it. The taste is sweet with a honey like quality with some fruit like sweet green grapes mixed in, quite impressive at the least. You can taste the alcohol ever so slightly with this beer and there is a hint of hops in the finish. It is very smooth, creamy and sticky in the mouth and a very easy beer to drink. You can sum up this brew in one word.WOW!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Head is short-lived, and lacing is minimal. Aroma is a bit of a sour funk with some belgian malt sweetness. Taste is slightly spicy Belgian malts, with a bit of a tang. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, very approachable for a Tripel."
"van steenberge is a brewery to watch with lots of interesting offerings. people criticize this beer for lacking complexity and i agree. steenberge makes plenty of complex beers (bornem double, gulden draak). this one is crisp, refreshing, and delicious in its own simple way. don't hate the player, hate the game."
"Received this 11.2 oz. bottle as part of a Christmas present. Appearance was an opaque dark orange or honey color and produced a 2-finger head. Stream of carbonation came from the bottom. Smell was malt and citrus, particularly lemon. Taste was banana, cloves, apple and slightly bitter towards the end. Alcohol was a bit upfront in the taste and smell. Mouthfeel was moderate, but warm and bready towards the end. This beer has a great flavor, but I got knocked out after drinking it."
"This is a pretty good strong pale ale, but the alcohol could have been tucked away a bit more cleverly."
"Bottle. looks like honey in the glass...light carbonation...small frothy head that lasts as a cap. Aroma of musty fruit. Mouth is a pleasant surprise...medium body...even a bit smooth...noted hint of the alcohol in this beer. Nice balance of hops and malt...very pleasing beer feel to this drink..only hint of alcohol is the warm finish and the peach-banana phenols one whiffs just prior to the swallow. Big beer with little complexity...a let down"
"I liked this belgian and my wife really loved it. She's coming around."
"Very fine Belgian pale ale. I found the alcohol flavor a bit strong, but great nonetheless."
"A fine, fine grog she be."
"Drinkability is quite high. The alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms. Perhaps that is a warning, 10.5% ABV should not be taken lightly no matter how good it is."
"What a beer. As big as it is, it feels balanced. The hops stand out, which is impressive in the style (whatever this one is). If I were to taste this blind, I'd peg it as american brewed, with it's hybridized feel. I don't think I could make a habit of this stuff, but it would certainly appeal to those that like a strong cocktail. Sticky sweet with a boozey prickle. I certainly wouldn't pass up another taste, provided I'm not driving home."
"Poured a pale golden colour with a thick foamy white head that never completely goes away, and laced well. Smells almost like peanut butter, and a bit of citrus. Taste is amazing, smooth and malty, with a dry hoppy finish. Very warming from the high ABV, but the alcohol is hardly noticeable when drinking it. This is a very flavourful Strong Pale, and I want another. :)"
"Overall, a solid Belgian IPA."
"A outstanding beer from top to bottom. This one poured a very nice golden color with a huge pillowy white head that stuck to my glass till the last drop. The smell was good with a touch of grass, a hint of pepper and a bit of bready yeast. The taste was exceptional with a nice sweet, not overly thick maltiness to start out with, followed by a very nice peppery flavor mixed slight hops and finnished with a great fruity aftertaste that was made up of a great pinnapple flavor. At 10.5% this is one to sip and savor for sure. Very highly recommended."
"This wasn't the easiest beer to drink, probably because of its high alcohol content, but it was certainly very, very tasty."
"Pours an ever so lightly hazy deep gold color, and is topped by an off white head that is medium sized. The aroma is dry, grassy, herbal, and has a spiciness that is a bit akin to coriander. The taste is lightly sweet up front, with a grassy finish that lingers. This beer is quite interesting in its herbal-grassy character. This beer has some bright fruitiness to it as well, evoking notes of pear, apple, white grapes, and yellow raisins. Again this is pretty good beer, if not a bit sweet."
"Creamy, long-lasting head with excellent lacing...medium yellow-gold in color. Smell was odd...something seemed off...Unbelievable the difference between smell and taste ...the taste was great..sweet on the front, rounding into a tartness and a very nice overtone of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with a nice light tart finish. Drinkability is very good for the high abv...very easy to drink. I'd have another, although at 10.5 abv...I might regret it."
"One centimeter of fine, noisy, white head leaves filmy lacing. The beer is a clear, orange-gold. That's a very nice color. The nose is spicy, orangey, hoppy, excellent! The front is spicy with citrus, sweet corn, fresh grass and pepper. Rich caramel in the very buttery middle. The finish sees a nice, sweet corn reprise, with alcohol and a nice, grassy, hoppy, bitter bite. This is wonderful: full-flavored, delicious. A nice, hoppy, spicy, fruity Belgian."
"Very drinkable. Tasty and smooth for a high ABV beer. This one is fun. Really hits the spot."
"My friend and I have seen this beer in the store and both being pirate fans decided we had to try it. This beer poured a pale brown from a 11.5 oz bottle with a very huge fluffy white head, and it stayed for a a minute or so. I was actually not expecting this as I wasn't even pouring it quickly. It smelled of alcohol and citrus. The taste was spicy and alcohol. The alcohol strength definitely made it harsher and brought down the drinkability. You couldn't drink a lot of this stuff. This was the first Belgian beer I've ever had, and I wasn't let down. It was delicious."
"Piraat, for me, is ok at best. I won't be buying one of these again. Very expensive 4.65 for 11.2 oz."
"Massive, thick, foamy white head. Clear golden body with moderate carbonation. Thick cottony lacing. Classic citrus and banana nose of a tripel plus some spice, yeasty aroma and a vague leathery quality. Flavor is very distinct with elements of leather, fruit peels, more spice, and prominent alcohol. This is a big, very enjoyable beer."
"poured into a duvel glass with a clear golden honey yellow with a fluffy rocky white head. fruity spicy aroma with lots of citrus notes spicy corriander and good hop aroma all infront of an estery alcohol background. spicy explosin of co2 in your mouth followed by warming alcohol and a nice sugary malt mouthfeel that is moderately syrupy. a very warming beer and very drinkable as much as this style is drinkable."
"I like most Belgian beers. This is not one of them. Flat, strange tasting beer. Plenty of alcohol, which is well hidden. It just has a weird taste that I can't describe. There are so many great beers of this style, don't bother with this. Even the Bier du bouccanier (if fresh) blows this away."
"Pours out a orange/golden color with a huge, thick head that never goes away it seems. Smell consisted of all sorts of things. Malts, citrus, grass and some slight alcohol can also be detected. Kinda wild almost. Taste was actually sweeter than I thought it was going to be. But wow is this thing thick. After taking that first sip I knew that this was going to be a thick brew. Almost looks like a Duvel, but nowhere as thick as that beer is. Citrus and honey and malts hit the palate first with some caramel and some hop kick towards the middle and end. A little bit of that 10.5% can be detected, but is masked well by the hops and citrus notes. At first I didn't know whether I was going to like it or not, but this does get the job done. Yes it's a thick beer, but it's pretty smooth and creamy. Worth a shot for sure."
"Pours a dark yellow color, with good off white head retention. Appearance is the best part of this beer. Smell is hope like and slightly sour. Taste is disappointing. Alcohol is a dominant factor in the taste here, and not in a good way. Other high alcohol beers blend the alcohol taste with the sweetness of the malt and balance with hops. The taste of this beer is liqueur-like, with the sweetness of the malt only having a subtle impact. Slight hops. Aftertaste is of whiskey, or ironically enough rum. This beer just isnt right for me."
"I'm adding this to my staple beers, crazy as that may sound... Arrr, mateys, thar I come."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into Chimay goblet. Pours a medium golden color, rich and thick looking. Has a medium-sized white head that settles to a 1/8th inch layer that sticks around. Aroma: in a word, nice! Bright and clean with apples, floral hints, and some sweetness. Flavor has a nice tripel-like feel with slight sweetness, apples, & cinnimon with a late hop bite that nicely balances the rest of the flavors. Some alcohol drifts up into the sinuses, but not overpowering. With this ABV, the alcohol is nicely underplayed in the taste profile (but it will catch up to you in a hurry). Mouthfeel is full and very pleasant. Because of ABV, drinkability is not as highly rated."
"Huge cumulous formations of pearl-white appear over candy-yellow liquid. The aromas tell of drunken banana puddings, coconut, navel oranges, yeast, and dry flint smoke. On the palate it is thick and sweet with flavors of tropical fruits, cream and tree bark. Like Duvel with more juice and alcohol. A persistent hop bitterness accompanies the sweetly alcoholic, medium-length finish."
"Pours orangy golden with a tiny bubble puffy head, dissolving to a sheen and of course leaves some nice lacing. Nose is strong medicinal, phenolic, alcohol, yeah baby, I love this style! first taste is pure bliss. Strong alcohol, melon, lots of pepper, more medicinal notes. As it warms, malty flavors and character come foward, This is 10%, but all the flavors and body conceal the alcohol well. Complex, tasty, strong, full of character and interest. Glad I went for this one, seek it out and enjoy. Sante..."
"Difficult to find on tap, but glad to find it. 64 oz. growler from Half Time. Poured a bright golden yellow with a puffy, cloud like head full of bubbles. Constant line of bubbles coming out of the deep recesses of the glass. Smell was very much a cross between a tripel and a grand cru. Sharp esters, orange peel, slight honey flavors all blended together with an almost brandy like quality. Taste was very sweet and almost like a less hoppy version of the American Double IPA. Sweet peach and green raisin flavors, juicy malt characteristics, slight hoppy finish that adds just a slight note of piney bitterness in the end.Sticky sweetness. The alcohol is very apparent, but not overbearing. Good beer and a nice belgian with a note of British influence."
"The appearance of this beer is probably the only disappointing part of this beer. The color is a light golden yellow, with a bit of stark white head that recedes into a light top and ring. Smell: lots of fruity sweetness, spice, wheat, hops, mustard, lemon/citrius. The taste is amazingly complex. It starts out with a hit of sweet fruit and syrup, and it quickly blends into the slightly salty meaty spiced flavors, with mustard, and the wheaty malts. The aftertaste blends into a wonderful mix of hops and spice. The mouthfeel is just right in body weight and is perfectly carbonated. The warm feeling that you get drinking it is wonderful to warm up to on a cold spring evening, and it also lets you know full well that what youre drinking is strong enough to knock a mule on its head. This is a great beer, and I hope HalfTime keeps this on tap for a while."
"I got a hold of a growler of the Piraat at Half Time (along with complimentary Piraat tulip glasses), and I tried it for the first time on a clear, chilly late spring evening. I must say, it was the perfect choice. It pours a cloudy gold color with a medium thin white head. The smell is quite complex:hops and belgian spices swirling in a harmonic blend that is very enticing. The first taste is delightful--cloves, banana, hops, that together with an underlying peppery backbone mask mischieviously the high alcohol content. I admit I was not sure I'd cotton to this combination, but it works, though I found the mouthfeel a tad too thin. Definitely a worthy choice."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Poured an intense amount of head into my tulip, belgian bubble bath shooting out of the glass! Beautiful! Golden and slightly cloudy, great head retention. Great aroma of sweetness and fruits, lightly yeasty and citrus. Fresh tasting. Nice bite and alcohol taste to it which I do appreciate. The more it warmed the more I taste tart apples. Also makes me think of the taste of bananas foster eaten with a beer... 10.5%, which is always nice too! Very drinkable and one I have shared with a beer newbie who just loved it!"
"Mouthfeel is quite smooth, slightly syrupy and overall it's a fairly thick bodied beer.. Carbonation is low, but moves well through the mouth. Just the one 330mL would suit me fine. A very nice treat."
"Pours a muted lemon-straw color with a good deal of haze and persistent, active carbonation. The finger's worth of off-white head quickly dissipates, though a fine lace clings aggressively to the glass. Yeast and grass scents are prounounced, as is a soft, peppery spiciness. Some underlying malt sweetness is detectable as well. Full, honey-sweet malt flavor gives way quickly to a massive wave of alcohol warmth and some peppery spice. While the warmth persists, it gradually yields to the grassy notes that are so noticeable in the smell. Full mouthfeel is sticky but not annoyingly, cloyingly so. A unique, interesting beer."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that wants to overflow the glass. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent which brags of Belgian pale malts and a fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a pale malt flavor that is very intense and warms on the finish. It has a dry, yet fruity yeast flavor that is pleasant. It goes down easy for having such a high abv. . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good Belgian ale, but I think that it's a little too over-hyped."
"cheers."
"750ml bottle poured at the Delirium Cafe in Belgium. This is a yellow/orangey liquid with a thick white top of foam. The aromas are very sweet and consist of citrus fruits, sugar, cotton candy, bubblegum, spicy herbal hops, light doughy malts and more. The taste is quite sweet and spicy from the interesting hopping that this beer has. The malts are a bit subdued, but lend a nice bready element to this beer. The mouthfeel is not too thick, or too thin and the drinkability is good, but hindered by the extreme sweetness of this brew."
"I had the pleasure of having this on-tap at Eulogy in Philly. This was an very good triple, which had a nice golden color and a nice frothy, creamy white head. The taste is creamy and smooth which is completely consistent for this style. As another mentioned, it is light but not watery. It has a tad more of an alcohol bite than I've had with others of this style. But given it's 10.5% abv, it still hides the percentage pretty well. Not the most drinkable triple, but still very good."
"This is drinkable enough to drink all night...but the abv would kick your ass the next day."
"This brew comes out a cloudy, orange color, and has a good size foamy white head on top. The scent is citrusy and a little malty. The taste has a spicy bite to it from the warming alcohol. Sweet, citrusy tastes as well. Bitter/spicy hops. A full mouthfeel. This is a high-octane beer."
"Enjoyed in a 9 ounce glass at Chumley's in Lafayette. This poured a nice golden color will a super small white foam head. Smell is very fruity and upon first sip i know why this beer smells so fruity. Massive notes of blueberry backed by a dry spiced body. Mouthfeel is just a tad above average and drinkability is not that great as this beer sits extremely heavy in your stomach. This is a quality brew but definately not my favorite for the style. Surely worth the shot though."
" Very Duvel - like with less malt backbone balancing the big hop profile. Very refreshing for a strong ale."
"Mmmmm... Pours a slightly cloudy pale amber hue under a thick white 2 finger head that lasts and lasts and last, leaving some uneven spots of lace down the glass. The nose is lovely - fruit, spice, malt and hop all mixed together. The mouth is very prickly and heavy with sweetness and alcohol, but it doesn't stick at all - crisp and fresh. The taste is a cornucopia of sensations, from candy to mint to malt to just a hint of hops. The finish has a touch of champagne to it - dry yet sweet. The dry bitterness lingers in the aftertaste, accompanied by a touch of fruit sweetness. Very good brew!"
"Somewhat too sweet for my liking but still a after dinner/sipping beer."
"Pours a beautiful honey amber, with a billowy off-white head that is slow to settle. Smell: Fruity notes and alcohol over belgian hops. Some sour, acidic qualities. Flavor is a bit stronger on the alcohol, but is still not overpowering for 10.5%. A very nice brewThe acidity lasts throughout and the fruity, almost berry notes mixed with the alcohol are very pleasant. Very worthwhile."
"Comments: I don't think I could say this beer is easy to drink; it certainly demands respect, for both its strength and it's complexity. However, I certainly had no problem easing my way through an entire 750ml bottle, but the sheer power of this beer prevents it from being anything you would likely drink all night long, as sooner or later you'll fall off your chair."
"I had heard many things about this beer mainly good so had to try it on tap last night.Pours a gold/orange color with a big fluffy head,the aroma has big hop presence very herbal and grassy.Taste is very citriusy and tart with some late hop coming thru,very grassy and herbal aftertaste.A pretty nice beer but not a top notch Belgian in my opinion."
"This beer is clear golden. Streams of CO2 surface at a nice clip. The head is fluffy and airy and eggshell colored. Retention is very good. Aroma is of must, lime peel, dough and yeast. Mouthfeel is too gaseous. Makes me burp too much. And it's hard to swallow. The flavors really do not do much for me. Harsh citric tones of lime and lemon. Very little yeast or dough contributions. And there's a husky astringency to it as well. Not a beer I'd buy again."
"Pours a fluffy, thick, white, three-fingered head, fades very slowly and leaves gobs of lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Color is a light golden. Nose is malty and has raisin overtones. Starts and finishes fruity with some sweetness and just a hint of bitterness. Pricey, $3.79 for a 330ml bottle."
"Hazy, peachy honey-yellow hue, it was served with a very small white head, about half a finger in height. The bartender filled my glass to the maximum with this nectar; I guess I cant fault him for that. The head that was presented did last for the entire consumption. As I quaffed a good amount of lace was produced. This is a fine looking beverage. The nose is plenty pleasant with fresh cut grass, hay, spicy alcohol and yeast, peppery, and fruity, it is a well-rounded nose, albeit typical for the style. The palate is wonderfully complex, grass, marijuana, pears, grapes, pepper, spice, and notes of wheat, apples, and hot candy yet sweet. This is an absolutely lovely drink; I cant help but sip and savor. The alcohol heat becomes great as it warms, oh it hurts so good! The hops bitterness is very noticeable on the back of the tongue, especially at the finish. Medium-full mouthfeel, this was surprising at how filling it was, modest and natural carbonation, what a very enjoyable quaff. I dont think this is comparable to Duvel or Orval; it is damn good and unique. Recommended."
"More of a specialty beer than a drinking beer. Bet this would be great hot with a cinnamon stick. It tastes a LOT like spiced mead!"
"330ml bottle pours out a hazy golden orange colored beer. The head forms to a moderate depth and thickness, and has wonderful staying power. A strong aroma here....and odd in a great way....it's a bit musty, also pungent citrus and penetrating alcohol. Alcohol dominates the flavors of this beer. Also well noticeable is a dark spicyness and dark fruityness. The mouthfeel is fizzy while being a bit syrupy. I can't really say I would want another one after having just one small bottle of it. It's very strong with alcohol flavor, and warms my stomach up enough to be pleased with just one. But everything else about it is great."
"Yummy! The nice bitter hop finish on the palate pleases me. I couldn't find a chilled IPA and that is what I wanted but this satisfied my need for a hop monster for now anyway. I think this is a very well done, solid and fantastic tasting ale. The alcohol is very well hidden but still is quite warming in the mouth on the finish. Lots of tropical fruits, but still somewhat bready and yeasty with an interesting malt flavor."
"Super beer to linger over for all kinds of reasons. Enjoy!"
"Notes: This is a wonderful Belgian Strong Pale Ale, goat cheese and roasted red pepper on slices of a toasted baguette is a quick and perfect pairing."
"Poured from a 330 ml bottle with a wacky-looking pirate on the label...also says 10.5%ABV. The beer poured a hazy golden color with a nice whitish head forming, which quickly resided leaving a blotchy lace pattern. The smell had a sweet honey and fresh lawn grass quality,with pleasant hop aromatics, subtle coriander, yeast, and a strong alcoholic component. I was very pleased with the taste and mouthfeel. The beer pulls in somewhat thin, but immediatly becomes silky and full, triumphantly carrying a parade of flavor onto the palate...a semi-sweet honey and candy-sugar backbone with notes of grass and pepper, finishing with a well-done cap of bitterness, which lingers on with the honey. I found it to be quite drinkable, as the alcohol and sweetness were not overdone, and the flavor was so delicious. ARRGG!"
"I am love the way that this beer poured out. The color was a burnt orange and the head was light and creamy. The lacing was massive and there was a substantial amount of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass. There was a wonderful wheaty, honey, sweet start to this beer and the finish was crisp. For being 10.5%, I cannot pick up any alcohol taste whatsoever. I really enjoyed this, but it is a distant second from something like Don de Dieu. Overall, another winner from the makers of Gulden Draak."
"Crystal clear amber with full white head that leaves solid sheets of lace even after receding to a film of bubbles on the surface. Very little aroma, but what there was was fruity and sweet. Crisp carbonation and strong hopping keep it from feeling syrupy. Candy sweetness, pepper, and alcohol fill out the taste. Very nice for such an agressive beer."
"Drinkability is limited by the ABV, but this was a good beer."
"Served in 11.2 oz bottle. Dark amber with a nice, ample, white head. First impression is malt, and alcohol-lots of it. Lots and lots of yeast in this one. Sweet and spicy with a hop hint at the end. Caramel color and taste. One of my favorites. Mouthfeel is great, with a lingering taste of candy. If it didn't have so much alcohol I would drink lots of this at any sitting."
"Oh and sort the fucking backward sails out on the Viking Longboat label chaps, its really annoying me. Either that, or put a proper picture of a Pirate Ship on  just ask (Captain) Russell Crowe, hell help you out with pictures. LOL."
"The taste is pure Belgian. Clean. Strong. Complex. If only I were more experienced, I could begin to describe this beer! When it comes to Belgian ales, I feel limited in my ability to accurately write what it's like to drink them. Just take my word for it: If you find Piraat, try it. Just enjoy it in moderation, it's quite the heavy-hitter."
"Hazy golden orange colored with a thick beige head. Interesting aromas. Smells like there's more hops than your average Belgian. Vinous, yeasty, and malty aromas as well as a big alcohol nose that is almost organic and musty. Sweet candi sugar hits the palate first then the 10.5% ABV kicks in finishing of a bit dry and a bit sweet. Alcohol lingers, begging for another sip. This beer has quite the fan base at my work. One's enough for me."
"Can sub for champagne or popular preference for bubby whites at dinner party. Would have again anytime. You can smell and taste the malt and yeast."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light yellow-orange color with three fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left. The smell is fairly sweet with white grapes, orange, and candy sugar. There is a hint of alcohol on the smell as well. The taste is a little tart at first, not expected. Overripe grapes dominate, and bits of sweetness are present. An overload of alcohol on the finish, no hiding it in this one. Also a little bit of peppery spices linger on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and heavy. The drinkability lacks a little due to the high alcohol taste. Not a bad Belgian."
"Comments  Probably too strong and alcoholic for most. Dont make this your first of the night, and dont make it your last."
"An aggressive triple? This is less complex and refined than some triples, namely the more trappist-styled, but not a loss because of it. A good turn on a classic style, hoppier and thinner in taste than most, but easy enough to drink."
"Pours a hazy straw color. Moderate head. Smells of mostly alcohol and hops. Tastes very strongly of alcohol, which is not a good thing. This is the fourth beer I had out of this sampler, and it the least pleasant one to date. Still very good, comparitively (better than 100% of the macro brews out there),"
"Pours pale golden with an ample white head. Yeasty aroma with tropical fruits (especially pineapple). Medium-bodied. Extremely flavorful. Very sweet malt tasting, and very fruity. Turns a little spicey with alcohol and hop bitterness. The warming is incredible. Very smooth mouthfeel. Overall this is a great Belgian, but not one of my top favorites."
"Drinkability is scored as average as the heavy body and very noticeable alcohol makes this as a one or two beer session."
"Taste initially of lemon, but soon the alcohol began to overpower this citrus like offering."
"This 330ml bottle has been aging in my basement for about 1 year now. I just love drinking beer out of it's own glass and I am lucky enough to own this one."
"A nice showing from the get go here. Super fluffy beige head with gloriously artistic lacing-hey nice legs on this one eh! Deep in the nose with an over-abundance of malt syrup and caramalized pear. The mouthfeel continues in the malt syrup direction, yet proves to be more enjoyably rich than flabby. More malt and sweet pear in the mouth. Man this is a real fun beer to warm up to! The concentration of malt,and the subtle entrance of fruit in the way of roasted pear, tart cherry and red berry make for a complex taste experience. Pretty to the end with washes of vanilla and bittersweet hop. I'd love to be on this pirate ship-cept during a storm maybe! Finishes moderately candied and warm-check your reviews for spelling to see if your not quite buzzed and beginning to make errors!"
"Appearance: Golden slightly hazed nice creamy vibrant white head lacing Belgian webbing fine lacing. Aroma: Aroma is rich sharp sweetness clean candy-like tone blended with alcohol just the way I like it, the hops actually exist in this sweet rich alcoholic beverage. Taste: Syrupy layers of malt profile nice bitterness Euopean hoppin going on, hey I'm a fan of this one flavorful as all hell, with zesty citric tones thrown in there and a warming tone of the alcohol of this 10.5% wow. Mouthfeel: Relatively light bodied syrupy texture makes it rich and warming, the secret of the Belgian strong ale make it lighter bodied and excessively good so everybody will always have a buzz even if they don't want to. Drinkability: Way to easy to sip and consume chalice after chalice, Piraat can serve up one hell of an unwarranted buzz quicker than you would expect."
"Nice golden,somewhat hazy color.Fairly decent sized head that quickly diminishes.Aroma of orange,spice and apple.Nice sweet flavor-the alchohol is definately there.Very slight hop bitterness.Flavor of malt,somewhat grassy-hint of coriander.Full bodied mouthfeel-slight burn from the alchohol on the back of the throat.Very nice triple indeed.Can see this one sneaking up on you very easily."
"One of my favourites. The incredibly bold flavours and massive alcohol warmth always makes this an enjoyable beer."
"Pours to a clear golden-amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is herbal, and spicey. The flavor is fruity and herbal with pepper-like spiciness and a bit of tartness. It is medium-full in body and warming. A very nice Belgian that will sneak up on you."
"The bartender had warned me that the beer tended to be a little flat compared to the bottle version, but this was not the case with this keg. It had a light fee in the mouth with some nice fizziness. Overall, this was a very drinkable, if not excellent draft beer. If it had not been 10.5%, I would have gone back for another one."
"This one pours an amber color with a large head that dies off into a rocky shape and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little grassy and hoppy with some sweet fruits. The taste is very strong and is composed of peppery spices and some sweetness. The flavor seems a little too aggressive for my tastes compared to the others by this brewer. Not smooth enough to thoroughly enjoy."
"Drinkability: I got this as a belated yen from Talk Like A Pirate Day. Wish I had had it then. It's not a bad drink. It's got some character and is worth giving a shot. A nice average BSPA."
"Copper gold color, large head. Aggressively hoppy and spicy. Strong malt flavor, Added cane sugar evident. Complex taste. Interesting amalgam of flavors; sweetness, tartness, almond nuttyness. Mouthfeel is full and expansive, creamy. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, some alcohol bite at 10.5%. Interesting beer. A warming afterglow, taste smoothes with time."
"IMHO: An enjoyable brew, but its intensity overwhelms the drinkability and it is lacking in a well-balanced character. Somewhat two-dimensional: a very sweet start and a very dry finish."
"Its got a crisp Hop bite with a sweet flavor. Sort of spicy, and an excellent aftertaste. As it warms a bit, the prevailancy of the sweeter flavors come out more. I would have to say its a medium to full-bodied beer with a thick finish. Definately a must try and then try it again just to make sure"
"This beer's appearance is totally awesome. Rich, thick, billowy, creamy plumes of white froth top this little beauty. The head lasts all the way to the bottom and laces in a way not often seen in many beers. The foam imparts a very sweet flavor followed by the deliciousness of the amber-hued body. The flavor is indeed complex giving the impression of many different foods. In there are raisins and plums, a little spice, some herbal hops and fruit from the vine. Unbelievably, late in the glass the smell of pure honey begins to emerge and mask the malty goodness. Truly a lovely feel and great drinkability. Complex..."
"This is definately a solid 4.0er+. It's got a beautiful rich head that lasted forever! That is one of my biggest things. It's gotta have a good head to even begin to get somewhere with me. Here it is like 15 minutes after I poured it and the head still thick and frothy. I guess the only bad thing about the appearance is the fruity looking ""pirate"" on the bottle, with a viking ship. What's up with that? Oh well, guess you can't have everything. The taste was a nice complexion of various fruits, ie citrus and grapes, mixed with maltiness. It also had to presence of alcohol, but i dig that. The smell was similar, but still had the alchololiness to it. It's cheap, so i think I could drink this some more! Arrr, shiver me timbers!!!"
"A top tier triple in my book..."
"Poured out a golden wheat like color. Smell is malty with a touch of yeast overtone. Taste is complex, with the fruity hints melding with clove and honey. A little hop kick in the end. Quite drinkable despite the ABV. One of the best triples I've tasted to date. Just delicious!!"
"It drinks pretty well but I do not think I would not want to drink more than one at a session. If just feels a bit heavy even though it looks light."
"This Belgian ale poured a hazy, orange-amber color with white foam that clung to the glass and left lace. The smell was sweet and malty, with candy sugar, citrus, and hints of fruit flavors. The taste was slightly sweet and malty (with the characteristic Belgian ale tangy flavor). There were also hints of fruit: figs and raisins. The mouthfeel was smooth and airy on the tongue. The body was medium and the carbonation feel low. The finish and aftertaste were slightyl hoppy. This was a very nice and drinkable strong ale (deceptively easy to drink)."
"Poured a hazy, dark-orange, with a large creamy-white head. Smells of yeast and alcohol, and clove(?). Bubbly on the tongue, yet explosive and chewy as it hits the back of the mouth. Great mouthfeel. Taste starts with noticeable alcohol. Corn-syrupy-sugar-sweet, raisins, caramel in the middle. Sweetness balanced by a strong, lingering bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is very present and not well hidden. I drank all 11.2 oz, but one's enough for me!"
"This brew pours a large head of fine and medium sized white bubbles with a cloudy dark yellow body. Its aroma is very mild indeed buit from what I could smell of it nice in a malty banana way. The flavor is powerful and well backed by its 10,5% ABV. It has acomplex flavor that includes nots of bread, citrous, spice, malt and maybe a few other things. It doesn't take long for the alcohol to hit you either. This is a powerful complex brew."
"Poured a medium off-white creamy head with fine-small bubbles. This brew had a clove aroma to it. The body was cloudy and it was golden in hue with some carbonation observed. I can definitely taste the alcohol in this brew. Wow! The lacing was fair on the sides of my glass. There is a strong bitter taste that lingers with this brew. This is definitely a brew to be sipped and not guzzled unless you are looking for a good buzz!!"
"Pours nicely, medium golden clear yellow. No cloudiness unless you swirl the very last bit. Very clean smelling. Somewhat tart apple or grape. Can also smell the alchohol. I drank this fairly warm. Taste also had some good fruit taste backed by some malt. Not quite a tripel. Warm to the tummy. Mouthfeel was numbing and oily. I have had this before and will have again. Very tasty beer, but I prefer Duvel(for the type)."
"Nice looking beer - faded amber in color, 30% head in off white. Lace was not as rich as I expected. As far as drinking, I've got to say that the feel of the beer was better than it's taste, and that knocked the drinkability down. Not sure I would buy it again."
"Coulda been a contenda."
"Pours a rather dark golden color. I didn't know quite what to make of this beer from the get go. It has a wacky looking label with really no description of the contents inside. So, naturally it was time for an adventure. Piraat overall is a very drinkable trippel that leans more towards the dark trippel side. My main complaints about it is that its 10.5% ABV is VERY apparent, lacking a real balance. Additionally, it is very malty, which if you like that sorta thing is fine. Many do not, however. I was not disappointed in my purchase, however."
"My aroma was a nice mix of lemon with phenol/clove spiciness. Big full head, active bubble action from the bottom. Some lacing. Mine was less cloudy than others have described. Rather bright gold color. Flavor is explosive and intense. Not for the faint of heart (as beer flavor goes). Taste of alcohol is present throughout and lingers. Good mix of flavors with malt, spices, some mild fruitiness and a shot of bitterness too. Intensity of the drink makes this a sipping beer, but a nice ale smoothness helps it go down more easily. Some mild carbonation action with the drink. I like this quite a bit, including the goofy picture on the bottle."
"Taste is quite strong of alcohol, with a lemony/orange spice and a bit of a nutlike malt, very milky, grainy, pulpy in the feel with a smooth alcoholic bite that cleansed my head. Drink this bad boy pirate slowly."
"Pours a solid orange color with an ultra-thin off-white head. No lacing. Aroma is sweet spices, with a faint skunky presence here and there. Flavor is almost dominated by the alcohol, but there are nice malt and grapefruit flavors apparent as well. Overall not a bad experience but this beer isn't up there with some of the better Belgians I have had."
"pat"
"Overall, this was a good beer, though definatly not a session beer. I had it for desert and i would do so again."
"This beer is a rich golden color, and is topped by a thin white head. There is a slight haze to the beer as well. The aroma is light, with a bit of hops and maybe just a hint of citrus. The taste is mostly a malt sweetness, coupled with a strong alcohol note. There is a decent hops bittering in the finish, but this is all about sweet, fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is very rich and smooth, and the drinkability is good. I was surprised to see this was an IPA. It is a very good beer that malt lovers will enjoy."
"First bottle in my valentine 6 pack sampler, was this offering. A pirate beer? Golden color with a good head, the hops were outstanding. It head a spice, perhaps cloves, that was odd at first, but grew on me as I continued drinking. Excellent beer, well worth it."
"A very good brew...I will thoroughly enjoy this one!"
"It's taste is very fruity with a touch of clove, the estery essance is also present here in the same way as Duvel. I have to say it's not impressing me overly much but it's still a good and complex brew."
"Very spicy first sip. Cloves are most dominant. Much drier than I was expecting. The alcohol is hidden very well. You know it's there, but you can barely taste it. Finishes slightly bitter, but nicely so. Very well balanced. Left a lingering lace on my glass. Mouthfeel is very nice, slightly creamy and excellently carbonated. Way to drinkable for 10.5% ABV."
"Mouth-watering nose of melons and lime in a burlap bag that once transported peppercorns. Starts sugary, but the sweets are soon snagged up by a brutal alcohol bully and his sadistic hop sidekick; they're ruffians, sure, but troubled youth always has a softer edge that warms one's soul. Deep toasted golden fields under fleecy clouds edging a spritzy river of carbonation that's quick yet mellow and my mind lazed back for a picnic lunch of Piraat."
"Simply put, an outstanding beer, and one of my new favorites of the Tripel style. Wow..."
"."
"This beer is a treat, sip slowly and enjoy. Beware, it will sneak up on you."
"I might be nuts but the first impression in the aroma department was of baked beans! After a few minutes the yeasty clove accented smell came through. A very impressive head adorned a hazy golden liquid. As expected lacing was plentiful. I have tried to get in to Belgians and I think I can take em or leave em. This one was my favorite of the three I have tried. I know that's not a big sample but I really think they are not for me. This was a good brew though and I liked it more than this review leads on. Surprising drinkability at 10.5%"
"This was one of the best Belgian beers I have had. Light hazy yellow color. Major spice (cloves, bananas). Refreshing taste as well. Slight head. Sometimes the spiciness of the Belgians prevent me from drinking many at one sitting. These are normally my dessert beers."
"Pours a light brown colour topped by an impressive white head. The aroma consists of caramel, malt and moderate spice hints. The flavour reflects the taste and therefore what you smell you taste really. Malty, caramelly and spicy. Average carbonation, quite impressive mouthfeel. An impressive strong ale"
"This beer poured a light amber color and formed a nice bubbly white head that left circular lace. Some small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and spice. A flavor of malt and caramel with a hint of spice. The finish was sweet and had elements of the alcohol present. A very nice beer."
"Cool name for a great beer, sneeks right up and knocks you around. Before you know it, it's gone !"
"Piraat pours with a nice looking white head over a heavily yeast sedimented rich gold looking liquid, with an intensely malty nose, heavy and inviting. Taste is equally intense, powerfully expressive malt palate followed by heaps of soothing sherryish alcohol notes and finishing up with a hefty dose of clean, strong hop bitterness. This is giant of a strong golden ale...drink with caution, this one hits hard!"
"The pour a clear deep golden-orange color, the head is elephantine, spumous, with tons of lace. Nose is malt, citrus like, fruity, and quite pleasant. Top is reedy, the finish is mastodonicly acidic, sufficiently hopped, the aftertaste is malt dry and alcohol bitter. 10.5 ABV shows up as a nice warming sensation in the abdominal region (Belly Warmer). Another of those beers I like, but will need several samplings to average out the likes and dislikes."
"Lemon fruit and floral hop nose.  Hazy pale ale look with lots  of fine bubbles.  Lasting pale white head.Very smooth cream mouth.  Original alcohol tongue with bitter orange followed by a sweet finish with yeast notes of banana and pear.  The mouth is second to none.  The bitterness is up-front in this brew.  Very unique and complex with lots of complexity.  Quite drinkable for its 10.5 ABV.  The mouth alone is worth the price of admission.  As it warms the beer rounds in flavor.  Pop one open let it sit 10 min. and then enjoy!"
"Taste starts off honey sweet, with a noticeable hop bitterness and a somewhat grassy aftertaste.  Medium-full bodied.  Not at all bad -- one of the more drinkable of Van Steenberge's ales."
"Hazy orange in hue, covered by a thick, dense, bumpy very well retained porcelain white head supported by copious bubbling.  Unripe pear hits the nose immediately, then is ceded by citrusy fruitiness comprised of sweet lemon and tangerine.  Lightly spicy, peppery alcohol and trace fusels are perceptible towards the end of the aroma.  Refined and appetizing aromawise.  Candyish sweetness hits the palate at first, then yields to citrus rind fruitiness and a drying combination of black pepper alcohol and bready grain.  Sweetness then reemerges, but takes on a floral, raw honey like character and when coupled with the subtle alcohol flavors a black licorice note surfaces mid palate.  Relatively full in body, but with a crisp, slightly dry mouthfeel that helps facilitate superlative drinkability.  Hop bitterness, although not assertive, superbly offsets residual sweetness.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet mix of fruity sweetness and pseudobitter alcohol brifely lingering on the palate.  Piraat is a delicious brew... Overall, it is akin to a Pale Strong / Tripel hybrid.  It's reminescent of a 50 / 50 mix of Duvel and Cinq Cents. Just a hair shy of the best of both worlds.  Unparalleled drinkability."
"....Shiver me timbers, you scurvy dog."
"The bottle says ""ale"" but I have to catagorize this as a Belgian triple. Big alcohol in the beginning as well as the end. Alcohol nose, overwhealming the spices. Very little head and lace, but somewhat intrigueing. Keeps you coming back. Spices are there, but you have to seek to find the hidden treasure.(sorry about that) With all the Belgians out there, I would look for something different before I would try another."
"330"
"Like most Belgium Beers I've tried, the smell and apperance are great, then its down hill from there. But, this beer after a few sip, got better. It has a fruity aroma and taste. Not real bitter on the after taste. Flavorful, as you drink this brew and it grows on you after each sip or gulp! One of the better Belgium beers for a hot summer day or a cold winter afternoon, infact anytime!"
"When I first had this beer compared with Duvel, Lucifer and a few of the other more balanced strong golden Belgian's, I found it to be aggressive and rough - with a bold sweetness, an apparent alcohol, and a rough edge of bitterness and acidity. I've since changed my opinion on that in so far as those qualities give it a bold, unique, character. There are times when you want something that will reach out and grab you! This is it! Beautiful deep gold with a bright white rocky head that holds. Nice, creamy mouthfeel that caresses and tingles. The aroma is huge, complex, fruity, spicy and sweetly malty. The flavor starts with a bright sweet malt, revealing some spice (coriander?) and light acidity, followed by a brash bitterness. Plenty of alcohol here. A very strong, highly flavored ale that tours your mouth and takes no prisoners."
"Deep gold, with fruity aroma and taste.  Think I noticed some honey flavor in there as well.  Medium bodied, and very strong... this one doesn't hide the alcohol from you.  A little too sweet for my tastes though."
"Love this beer!  Especially nice on a cold winter's day.  Has a huge head and hoppy aroma.  The alcohol is very noticable from the first sip, but you adjust to it after a couple of sips.  Definitely not a session beer, but if you're looking to have a great tripel it's worth trying."
"Careful pour into a wine glass gives 1/2 brew, 1/2 head that keeps some ""mountains"" in the middle...Hazy light brown appearance. Fruits and citrusy aroma very apparent, I thought I detected a trace of slight sulfur too. Deep malt taste, a little anise, brown sugar, and maybe a touch of banana bread. Good malt/hop balance. Pretty pleasant taste, the alcohol was not very apparent to me. Aftertaste is similar but noticeable. This is a special event beer to me, but it didn't have some characteristics that are off-putting to me. Glad I tried it, I think I prefer Gulden Draak..."
"Piraat:  Another huge, huge head over a hazy, tan ale.  Very strong aroma of citrus/alcohol.  Very nice smooth malt tastes, with a quick sensation of warming alcohol.  Excellent."
"Whew!  This is a strong one, with alcohol permeating throughout. This triple-strength brew has a powerful hoppy punch with a mild sweetness. Yeast flavor brings to mind bread dough, spices, and tropical fruits."
"Quite drinkable, but the nose and the palate have too much alcohol on them, its ok though, and a great way to get drunk (this can be good or bad!!), anyway, not the best belgian beer."
"I recently had Piraat on draught and am raising the results of my review as a result. I found that the alcohol didn't dominate the flavor as is it did from the bottle. I also noticed some subtle flavors that weren't so detectable in the bottle."
"Beautiful hazy golden beer.Nice and floral on the nose.  Nice sweetness that covers the high alcohol of the beer,great balance and creamy mouthfeel.  Almost tastes wheaty at first then the hops then the sweet maltyness.One of my favorite belgians."
"(as a side note, I won 6 Piraat glasses from Global Beer a long time ago and was delighted to finally fill one of those vessels with the correct nectar)"
