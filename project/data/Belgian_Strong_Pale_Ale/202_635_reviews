"Overall:  Like this beer, but definitely not my favorite Belgium strong (pale or dark).  Too sweet and little too much alcohol burn."
"Amazing beer. One of my favorites."
""
"Yeah, they should make it more balanced.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my baseline for Belgian brews, great stuff"
""
"Likely on the sweet end of the spectrum within the class, I find this to be a strong, solid brew.  The nose is fig newton and honey.  Taste follows closely with a warm, clean finish and virtually no hop."
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
"Copper in color.  Only mildly funky.  Decent body."
""
"Has ripe light fruit, malt, caramel, not much hop action on the nose. Pours dark amber with a slight haze under a 1” tan tinted white foam cap that produces delicate lace. Rich malt flavors introduce the palate with traces of caramel, light malts, a faint hint of chocolate, and a trace of anise with a little brown ale character. The beer is fairly sweet throughout and may be cloying to some. The balance leans more towards the malt than yeasty esters. The carbonation is medium low with a medium full body."

"Really good ale. Sweet finish. I recommend you try...if you can get it."
"Oh, this might be my other favorite beer. Such a deep flavor and not to heavy."
"Pours a clear reddish orange with two fingers of fluffy cream colored foam, settles to a thin ring, splotchy sheet of lace for the first few inches. Smell: raisin bread, sugary, overripe stone fruit note, lightly medicinal and spicy. Mildly alcoholic and a little underpowered. Taste: candy sugar, raisin, dried apricot, overripe plum; clove, grass and pepper notes. Medium-full bodied, lightly syrupy with low but quite creamy carbonation. A bit on the sweet end and not super exciting, but a nice strong Belgian ale. 6/14 label date."
"[From tap served in special glassware] Delicious strong amber coloured beer. Rich mouthtaste with a medium after taste. Strong malty taste with some hops making it a tasteful beer."

"O: I like this beer and the weird glass. Would buy again but probably not on a regular basis. Nice belgian quality but lower esters and less complex than I prefer. (personal note)-Reminds me of sharp edge draft yeasty flavor."
"Thanks to an awesome bartender at Liberty Tap Room in Mount Pleasant, SC, I was able to take home one of their iconic Kwak wood-handled beer glasses. It might be a gimmick, but it absolutely adds to the experience. I'm hoping the bottled variety is as delicious as I remember from that trip to the tap room. The cloudy, tarnished copper liquid pours with a tremendous amount of foam. Maybe part of it is the shape of the glass (with the spherical bottom) but either way, that's a lot of foam! As it settles down there's splotchy, soapy lacing on the glass. The aroma bears a strange metallic scent, like a handful of pennies, with traces of banana. A little buttery toffee in the nose too. The flavor is sweet and malty with a hint of clove bitterness. It's a tad cidery, imparting a tangy flash of flavor. There's a buttery, honey sweet bread-like taste that reminds me a little of sticky buns. A little funky Belgian yeast and fruity banana esters in the finish. The alcohol here is thinly veiled, lending a boozy solvent-like layer. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, with medium body and carbonation that may be a touch too lively. In total, this is a tasty Belgian strong ale that lacks some of the finesse and character of its contemporaries. Not quite as refined as some of the others I've tried, but delicious nonetheless. Perhaps if they put as much work in to the beer as the glass, it would be world-class."

"It's been far too long since first I tried this beer, and I just couldn't keep away from that snazzy glass.  It pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of cream foam.  The nose comprises candied orange peel, Belgian yeast, clove, light dry caramel, light grass, and a bit of vague breadiness.  The taste brings in more of the same, the Belgian yeast really driving through some fruity and spicy notes to balance out the caramel-laden biscuit residing throughout the background.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a solid BSPA, one that has earned its place as one of the constant Belgian offerings at nearby watering holes."

"Overall, it's right down the middle bordering on ""meh."" It's a Blegian, to be sure, just not one I'd buy again due to the superiority of other similar beers for the same price out there."

"Kwak would be a good Scrabble word"

"On tap, served in a tall funky glass in a stand."

"Overall, this is a phenomenal Belgian ale that does nothing wrong.  The flavor profile is complex and perfectly balanced, giving the drinker plenty to explore and savor during the experience.  Neither the yeast nor the carbonation are overbearing, giving the deft malt character the opportunity to shine.  For all its nuance and complexity, Kwak remains supremely drinkable.  Highly recommended."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18E). AROMA: sweet malty aromas, reminiscent of caramel. no hop aromas. spicy alcohol notes. APPEARANCE: deep amber color and translucent. average tanned head with good retention. pronunced lacing. TASTE: sweet malty flavour with notes of caramel. very low bitterness with a sweet finish. PALATE: medium-light body with medium carbonation. some alcohol warmth. OVERALL: a belgian ale that is less complex than its competition."

"O: A lovely Belgian beer."
"Poured from a bottle. Aromas of caramel with hints of apple. Pours a clear amber that looks great. A light sweet taste. Between medium and full bodied, with creamy texture, and slightly bitter finish. A really great Belgian Ale, rich and smooth."
"Overall – Fairly strong at 8.4% it does taste of alcohol on the tongue but has a lot more warmth to it when it hits in the belly, which is similar to whiskey. Like a lot of Belgium beers this one has a slight sweetness on the pallet but leaves an after taste like Amstel."

"Amazing"

"O- This is a nice middle ground between session and refresher beers, and strong, knock you out beers. It's good at the end of a busy day- without ending your day."

"A good ale with, for me, a bit too much fruity, and not enough malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Murky mahogany brown in color with a minuscule trace of head covering half of the top of the beer.  Aroma is strongly centered around dark malt with a bit of candy sugar.  The taste is exactly as the aroma advertised.  Light Brussels lacing.  The mouth is fairly smooth and easy drinking."

"Taste / Palate: Now on the tongue the bready Belgian yeast notes hop out first. Dark fruit, raisins, plums and apples move in with sweet maltiness. In the middle there is an attempt by the hops to come out and play but the yeast notes and malt notes and now some sweet boozy notes hold out and finish strong. The body feels smooth with lots of fine carbonation. Just right for a big Belgian Ale."

"That's when the high effervescence lifts the taste and refreshes the palate with ease- its steely caramel flavor dissolves easily, carrying with it any malty weight and bready texture- nearly preferring wine like zestiness in charming warmth as the taste closes."

"Had on tap in the iconic glass at 1400 Bier Haus here in Calgary. Darker colored than the style descriptor would suggest, a copper red with rather minimal beige head. Aroma is instantly boozy, a little grainy, with some raisin and nutty/spicy Belgian yeast notes apparent. On the palate, delivers some toffee, banana peel, dried plum/fruit roll up, cherry, and shortbread cookie flavors although everything is rather subtle, with some coarse alcohol overshowing the proceedings more than I would like. Medicinal clove and cinnamon oil flavors build over time and I get some minty wintergreen or something in the dryish boozy finish. Well-attenuated body and drinkable in this regard, on the fizzy side. Does not reach the lofty heights of some of its countrymen but worth sampling on tap. Do not be entirely dissuaded by the gimmicky glass. Does feature the expected estery/phenolic Belgian yeast profile and not super sweet."

"O-Absolutely wonderful. Happiness in a glass. Extremely well balanced."
""

""

"Alright but not outstanding. Looks OK, with a satisfyingly complex aroma of dried fruit, caramel and yeast. The flavour is similar yet somehow lacklustre - difficult to pinpoint but perhaps too sweet and cloying. Faint harsh undertones don't help. Body is acceptable. Doesn't stand out from the crowd; no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"Had this on tap a couple of times. Pours a deep orangeish, almost a brown tone. Fruits of the pear/apple variety, along with a touch of white grapes and a slight hint of must, but not really much else going on. None of the classic Belgian yeast/bready aromas. Flavor is about the same, nothing great, nothing bad. The alcohol is barely noticed, which is a good thing. A rather lackluster beer with not too much going on. Fairly standard, nothing to wet your pants about."

"Glad to say this tastes better than I thought it would - the smell lets it down a bit, but then beer is meant to be drunk, not smelt."
"Overall: I had this beer around a year or so ago as I was cutting my teeth on styles of beer other than lager. This was an awesome entrance into the world of international ales, and still hovers near the top of my list of beers. A great, easy-drinking higher ABV ale which is silky smooth without the harshness that can sometimes accompany such high ABV."

"Price Point - $10.99/750 ML BOTTLE"

"Overall, enjoyable, but there are other Belgian Strong's that are better choices."
""
""
"Kwak pours a bronze color with small lacing head. There is a sweet aroma with a strong yeast flavor; lots of Belgian candies. The taste is similar, sweet taste with a lot of Belgian candy flavors, and strong hints of yeast. Full flavor, good body; sweet. Overall a nice sweet beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like Kwak for what it is, a strong Belgian amber with apple-y character. Good beer."
" The taste is great, lots of malt with a mild yeast fruitiness and and a gentle spice quality with mild hop flavor which adds to the caramel element from the malt with an almost candy-like flavor with a semi-dry finish. Overall this is a pretty decent Belgian ale, I had this a few times before and was glad to revisit this as it was easy on the palate considering the strength. Thanks again, Erik Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Kwak is an interesting hybrid sort of Belgian ale, sitting halfway between a pale and a dark ale. Definitely worth a try."
"A bit overly sweet beer, though the prior time I had it was very cold and I remember enjoying it greatly but it was on bottle. Maybe it was badly served from tap."
""
"Overall- Good, solid beer. Amazing mouthfeel. This beer is worth trying based on that alone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is far sweeter than I would expect from a Belgian Strong Ale. That is not to say it is bad because it also has those same bready, yeasty, and dark fruity notes. Pretty easy to drink."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is dark red/amber, very little foam that disappears quickly. Strong smell of malts and some sweet, maybe honey. Taste is mainly roasted malts with average hops and strong yeast. It's got a strange aftertaste I couldn't idenfity. Alcohol is well masked under the strong malts, mouthfeel is dense and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit light across the board - smell, taste, mouthfeel. Alcohol strikes me as the predominate flavor. Fairly underwhelming and not a whole lot to speak highly of. Oh well, you win some, you lose some."
""
"O - Honestly the novelty of the glass is all that this has. Not a bad Belgian pale but there are many better examples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not the best the Belgian but not bad. I would like to age one and see how it tastes after a couple of years. I don't think I would seek this one out but it is deffinately better than most beers out there."
""
""
""
"O: My unwavering ratings of 4 in every category are the opposite of this BSPA- it's nuanced, and I hesitate to call it complex, but it will keep you entertained. Like the numbers say, outstanding in every category, I only didn't bump some categories up a bit because I feel it's almost more like a tripel than it's labeled variety. If you come across it I'd suggest a taste (especially if in a bar where they serve it in it's proper glassware and wooden holder (google pictures of it)- just be ready to get judgmental glances from MCB diehards, and maybe some BA's too)."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/11/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, honey, caramel, toast, bread, clove, herbal, floral, pepper, light banana, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, raisin, caramel, honey, floral, clove, toast, bread, light banana, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, raisin, caramel, honey, toast, bread, clove, floral, light banana, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity.spicy yeast esters; with a large malt presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian strong pale ale. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with a sizable malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable sipper."

"O: A wonderful drink that screams the holidays, at least in the states. A unique bouquet of bitter, spice and sweet that keeps one engaged though the whole glass. Would be quite fun to pair with food."
""
"Overall - a well crafted if a bit too sweet of a Belgian pale ale. Booze isn't terribly well hidden, but that doesn't take away from an inviting flavor with plenty of sweetness and the devilish ability to get yourself into trouble if you don't stop after one or two."
""
""
""
""
"This brew is rather goofy like its name and the glass it's traditionally poured in. Although socially gangly, it will dance with southeast Asian cuisine quite nicely. And giving the clown some solo attention is certainly warranted, too. Brought to you by the folks who have made a two-foot-tall pissing toddler a provicial icon...you gotta at least try the beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very good with food. Had this with Welsh Ch'Ti (think Welsh Rabbit, but with potatoes, ham, and bacon under the cheese on top of toast, all cooked up in a gratin dish) which was great, and this beer was so dangerously drinkable, I wanted another but knew I would regret it if I did. A very good beer and I hope to have it again someday."

"O - A buddy gave me this beer citing that it was awful. I thought it was decent. I wouldn't call it a favorite, but it is certainly not awful."

"Serving type: 11.2 oz. bottle and poured into a Pauwel Kwak Coachman’s glass."

"if this is what belgium exports, can you only imagine what they keep to themselves?"

"Now my current favorite Belgian."

"The body is thin-medium. Some tingly carbonation."

"Kwak, I am sad you aren't better than this. Maybe it's because I didn't drink from the traditional Kwak glass. I will post a photo of the Kwak glass on Facebook and Twitter if you want to see what that looks like. Oh well… can't enjoy them all! By the way, if Brouwerij Bosteels wants to reimburse me, that would be fine."

"I've always considered this a very good bier, especially memorable if you use the proper glass."
"Anyway, i think it's just a very tasty beer, like so many of my friends who love it even more. It's sweet, but also has a sour yeastiness to it giving it more balance and complexity. Together with a very mild bitter finish with fruits and malts it's just a very refreshing and easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Surprisingly quite drinkable, even if its characteristics, when taken individualy, are not exactly to my liking. Maybe I was just in a good mood."
""
""

"If you are willing to spring for the whole Kwak paraphernalia, which I discovered in Bruge, this is a worthwhile experience so enjoy the ""kwak"" if you tip up a tad to quickly. As far as Belgian ale, this one holds it's own compared to Zotish style ale. It is middle of the road for good Belgian ales, but definitely drinkable. Not overly complex, a little caramel, banana and slight nutty finish, reasonable alcholol cover and slight sweetness. This is the kind of beer to drink, enjoy and not worry about style or flavor, on the other hand, quite fun to enjoy the Pauwel Kwak drinking system, which is like no other, one reviewer called it a mad scientist contraption, I would say interesting and make sure you don't embarrass yourself pulling the round bottom glass out of the wood stand to sip, pay attention and use your ingenuity figuring it out."
"Final Grade: 3.85, an excellent B+. Pauwel Kwak makes for a worthwhile tipple, though as far as Belgian pale ales go I wouldn't consider it a particularly exceptional offering. I'd be hesitant to place this stuff on the same tier as my favourite BSPAs (Duvel and La Chouffe), but it's still a quaffable strong ale in its own right, with higher drinkability than average. If you're looking for an affordable strong Belgian pale to enjoy this winter, Kwak fits the bill nicely."

""
"Reddish brown, with a couple fingers of eggshell head. Moderate lace and retention. Malty nose, caramel but juggles by some by some pear, red delicious apple and a light herbal and spicy character to the hops. Taste has yeast and a lunch of spice upfront, sweeter malts, a touch of copper, and spicy hop character. Medium feel, drying yea, medium high carbonation. Adequate Belgian strong ale, but there are better choices out there."
""
"Overall - Better than I had expected based on previous reviews. My bottle was almost at it's best before date, so perhaps this beer develops well over time. I'd buy/drink it again anytime."
"Overall this is a very cool beer, mostly because of the glass. As far as the beer in the glass it is solid but not stand out."
"Pale amber colour, one finger worth of white head, some lace here. Nose is of sweet candy, malty and some juicy fruits start to show themselves as well, spicy, bits of pepper and a bit yeasty. Taste is big and malty, fruity with a good deal of sweetness, apple and orange flavours, yeasty points, more fruit in the finish with some spice mostly clove and pepper. Light-med carbonation, medium body with some fuller points as well. This is a good although fairly sweet belgian, ABV goes largely undetected, but still not a stand out for me anyway."

"4.0 D: I know this beer doesn't get a lot of love, but I think it's pretty good. Has lots of flavor and a great mouthfeel. Give it a go if you haven't."
"D - On the sweet side and not very complex but solid."
""
"M - Light body. Light carbonation."
"Sweet, a little flat, biscuity aftertaste, wheat toast, not what I expected for the style. I don't pick up on the yeast that I would like with the style. Slightly metallic, dry finish. Of course it is a good beer, but for the price I would rather pick up another Belgian strong pale ale."

"An enjoyable drink."

"O- Yum. I loved it, the back abbey in my area had it on tap, but unfortunately ran out that night! I want more!!!! I am looking forward to trying this again on tap! Such a great beer. If you like belgians and you want a decent price pick this up!"

"poured into the DUVEL tulip glass. small head which didnt stay very long; spotty lacing (or just spots) as it's drunk down. beautiful copper color- probably its best trait. like the other reviews have said, it lacks in taste and is easier to drink than its other strong ale cousins, but it's not bad and for 8.4% ABV it goes down relatively well. it could be Belgium's budweiser or lawn mower ale, but with a heftier punch. but no, it's not as bad as a bud...."

"Bought a bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. The looks of this are okay, bubbling up from a dark amber hue with foamy petri dish style foam, leaving a bit of lacing around the edges. However, the smell and the taste for this just paled in comparison to other strong Belgians. Not much else beyond a hop scent, and the taste left me wanting more. Overall, this is still a high-quality beer, but nothing like its more superior cousin brews. I liked this, but I won't be buying it again."
""
""
"Pours a clear brown with a khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some slightly fruity aromas. Taste is very much the same with a mild bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice sweet and malty flavor that I am enjoying."

"To be honest I only purchased this beer due to the glassware section of the store wherein I saw a cool little wooden case and glass specifically made for the beer. Poured from bottle undated to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a fairly clear amber color with a decent 1.5 finger white bubbly head with some retention and lacing. The nose is a disappointing mild caramel sweet character. Perhaps a hint of belgian yeast but nothing else really to report. The flavor is a little more impressive as the caramel malt sweetness blends well with the belgian yeast and provides a pleasing flavor. Mildly bitter with little hop character the beer is rather sweet and mild. Finishes crisp and clean and sweet. Well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall, nothing special really but not terrible. The glass and wooden case were cooler."
"For a quad this is a great smooth summer ale. Yes sir! Drink this beer when Belgian play in the summer European Cup soccer match. I might recommend something like Weather Report to listen with Kwak."

"O: Above average beer, a bit dusty."
""
""

"Very sweet, but to be fair I like sweet. Good overall, would really only have one at a sitting. Served in a tall glass with a wooden holder. Strong, but pleasant. A pleasant beer with a very nice taste and finish. Hard to have more than one though. Different for a pale ale."
""
""
""
"This is definitely not a strong pale ale- it's quite drinkable because of the mouthfeel. May get it again because of the price of a small bottle."
"O: Not so special but ok. But probably wouldn't drink it again."
""
"O - A very ordinary beer, that is disappointing...not used to such mediocrity of a Belgian beer."
""
""

"Nothing wrong with the beer, just something that I could not get excited about or have again."

"poured into one of those crazy wooden handled glass trumpet shaped glassholder devices that im sure has a proper name, and for this it gets bonus points. cheeky monk in denver. has a nice redorange glow, some cloudiness, and a small white head. lovely. smells really yeasty, almost sour if you think about it like that, some notes of dried fruit as well. flavor just isnt my favorite for a belgian. its tart and sweet at the same time but not in the right proportion, it kind of filled me up too, which is uncommon for this style. the yeast dominates the flavor with subtle notes of dried cherries and raw sugar. feel is nice and bubbly, crisper than most in the finish. not a bad beer, but on a night of drinking fine belgian ales, this one did not stand out."
"O - not outstanding in any way but also a drinkable beer"
""

"Overall: This is a very solid Belgian ale. I enjoyed the blend of flavors, but wasn't blown away."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a solidly average brew. It was interesting to get those grape tastes but it when the pieces came together it wasn't doing it for me."
"It's a strange beer. I don't recall any other type of pale ale that lacked even a remote bitterness and instead was so sweet. It's still a decent beer, just categorized wrong."
"O-A really well put together beer. Complex and balanced very nicely."

"O: A nice strong pale ale. The flavor in the beer is good, but to me it lacks the depth of other strong pale ales. The fruit flavors in this beer are much stronger than others in it's class."

"D - Not bad, but I don't think I'll have this one again."

"Malty aroma has an overtone of sweet apple and a hint of caramel. It pours a clear coppery brown with a fairly thick, if not persistent, pale tan head that leaves some respectable lacing. Scrumptious flavor has firm notes of malt, caramel and apple and just a hint of cloves. It is slightly sweet and slightly bitter, and these two components nicely balance each other. Smooth, full-bodied texture has a firm fizz and leaves a subtle tingle and a malty, fruity finish."

"This beer started great with the pour, hints of Belgian sugar aroma and the taste had the typical big dark tropical fruit start but didn't follow through and left me wanting more."

"Smell a bit hoppy and some definite funk, but tastes leave me wanting just a bit more, especially with this high ABV, expected more depth of character."

"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a kwak glass which came as part of a gift set (sort of a flute / tulip hybrid, pretty cool stuff). This pours a tea brown color with a massive off white head which seems to have pretty good retention. The smells are wonderful, full of dark ripe fruit, a hint of alcohol, very lovely. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, but a little disappointing after the wonderful nose, there is the hint of the ripe fruit and malts, but its a little thin and the alcohol isn't covered up very well at all. Great nose, look but slightly disappointing on the taste."

"Overall: Some nice flavors going on, but too sweet and syrupy to be top notch."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely better options in the style especially when you consider the price of this beer."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass. Dark amber with very thin creamy head that dissipated quickly into nothing. Lacing refused to cling. Nose tended toward hoppy but not overly so. The thin taste had a bit of alcohol tinge to it but nothing too powerful. Mouthfeel was thin with little aftertaste. When I purchased this I was hoping for bang-up Belgian Ale, but was sorely disappointed. Will not buy again."
"O- Bought this because of the name (I thought it was the same name as one of my current professors, turns out the O is an A), and I am always up for trying a beer I have to uncork. Overall, the beer is drinkable, and if you like the belgian style, you will probably agree, and it packs a punch (though not like the beer called ""Donkey Punch"" that I had a few years back at Charlotte Octoberfest). I am confounded by the style category this was given, it doesn't seem to match up at all with the characteristics listed for a strong pale ale, or at least my idea of a pale ale. Seems more of a dark ale or dubbel, but I don't drink the Belgian styles often, so I am still trying to figure it out. Give it a try. It can't hurt. Unless you need the $11 to buy toilet paper."
"In short: overly sweet mediocre brew with emphasis on esters and alcohol. (BB 13. March 2013, 750 ml, into tulip)"
"Well, I'm still glad I revisited this, but this is sadly a product (from a great brewery) that relies more on image rather than genuine drinkable quality. I'd still drink it if someone offered me one, but this beer could be SO MUCH more. A disappointment of a strong pale ale."
"O- really refreshing, pretty interesting, a little lacking in umph though."
"My daughter schlepped this 12 oz over hill and dale almost 2 years ago and I am tasting/drinking it now. The nose is exhilerating, particularly as the beer warms up. Lots of toffee. The Kwak has malty, lager notes that I find appealing. The head, while nice at first, didn't stick around and the beer is rather flat looking too soon. There's a nice deep golden color. The balance of this beer is really good, malt, hops, and conditioning. Great job !"
"Overall a nice bold tasting Ale with some really nice malt characteristics that you can only get from a really decent Belgian brew."
"O: A really great beer, especially when looking for big flavor, or something a little out of the norm."
"O: Friends of mine use to drink this in pubs, but even though the glass is cool, I find it too sweet for my liking - on tap. In bottle it's not as sweet, a decent beer, but still pretty sticky and not as well-balanced as other pale Belgians. I'd go for Duvel or a nice tripel!"
"Taste is sugary and yeasty with a mild hop bitterness on the finish. Its like melted brown sugar, pinch of cinnamon and clove dust sprinkled on a piece of toasted, buttered dark bread. Interesting, but all the flavors dont seem to come together just right for me. Meh, not my favorite Belgian offering...worth a shot though to see if it works for you."
"A solid beer with good tastes & powerful edge to it but for me other strong ales are ahead in my list but would get this again as its a loverly tipple."
"Drinkability: Smooth and flavorful, this is very tasty and very well crafted stuff. The roads in Belgium must have been very dangerous with carriage drivers drinking this on their routes."
"Drink-  A nice little belgian. With good balance and nice flavors.  Seems a bit off on style in listing.  Probably would have again."
"I simply can't recommend this beer to anyone. There are many better beers out there especially Belgians."
"Actually an easy to drink beer overall. While nothing about it makes me stand up and take notice, it is still a really good beer. It goes down easy, and is easy to like. One I wouldn't mind trying again."
"Overall: This was a good version of a belgian strong ale. I know it was pricey, but it would be a treat that would be me in a good mood and warm me up in the winter time. I am pleasantly pleased with this beer and would purchase it again."
"O: It's a very easy beer to drink. Well balanced is the best way to describe it. Not too sweet or strong. I would defiantly recommend. Not a favorite but I'll keep it in mind."
"O~ Another very good beer on tap at the grill next door, its a beer you need to try out of the yard glass they created for it. Its quite the experience, and a 22oz 9% alcohol beer will kick you in the liver pretty quick."
"Notes: Reminds me a bit of a softer version sometimes of some Belgians that although not my favorites are on a different league like a standard Scaldis for instance. I wonder how much this one survives by the smart marketing of the wooden stand for the official glassware because other than that, and while relatively decent, this is not a brew that I would carry in my memory."
"O. If I hadn't known that this was a pale ale I wouldn't have guessed it. With its colour and sweetness and dark fruit flavours it's borderline dark ale. I won't mark it down for that because there's always going to be some blurring of style guidelines, which can sometimes be a bit too strictly adhered to. Leaving that aside though, the beer itself doesn't really stand out. It's fair to middling and no more. A decent enough beer to try but not one that I might go back to."
"Overall a highly enjoyable beer. Due to the high price, it's not one I'll purchase often, however."
"Overall - This was fantasic as a dessert ale. Shocked from the low scores it has. Its a nice session beer, a 22oz is plenty enough, the sugary sweetness could be a bit much."
"I wanted this to be better than it is for a belgian pale ale, but it is just too hot for it's own pants. Get an American pale ale and a shot of schnapps and you'll have more fun."
"Was recommended this beer quite some time ago and eventually found some at a mom and pop store in Palermo. Pours a nice reddish brown cloudy with some decent head and lacing. Nice malt with yeasty overtones and prominent alcohol warmth. Not sessionable but a decent Belgian. Some raisin and date attributes. I would try again but when afforded the chance for some of the other Belgian heavy hitters and trappistes would have to pass."
"Not bad, but certainly not great. Belgian beers spread quite the gamut, but this is one you feel could have used a little more balance, and a little more of that classic Belgian yeast character. Lacks a lot."
"Overall: Balanced flavors and very little bitterness. True to style and quite good."
"Another nice discovery at The Grill Next Door in Haverhill, MA this one shows a deep and cloudy rusty amber color with a fairly scant white tuft on top and very little lacing left on the snifter. The aroma brings mild cherry nougat and mild apple raisin. Not very strong but not concerning. The flavor includes a mild apple pie a la mode sort of idea. There’s a fair touch of licorice and sweet scone. It’s medium to light bodied with a very fine, subtle carbonation. It feels a bit watery but that doesn’t ruin it. The clove/spice idea dominates the fruit introduction as it works over your taste buds, but it finishes weakly with an odd, sweet but watery licorice summary. Not my favorite but not bad if you like licorice somewhat unbalanced in your beers. Moderate drinkability."
"Overall quite good, i'd have this again."
"Pretty good. Pours into that funky glass with the wood frame, a orange-amber color with a fluffy white head that retains well. Bready aroma loaded with Belgian yeast. Some light sugar and banana as well. Bready taste, light sugar, bananas and apricots, toasted malts, and a dry bitter hop finish. Medium mouthfeel and quite drinkable."
"This brew was poured into it's signature glass. It has a good head to start off that settles into a white ring around the top. The color is a very nice amber color. The taste is a little spicy and had a great caramel flavor to it. The mouthfeel is pretty light but had enough body to be flavorful and pleasing. Overall this beer has some elements of a Belgian Quad. I really enjoy the flavor and the look of the brew. Very cool brew."
"Price = $9.00 at BXL East (NYC)"
"O: This feels like somewhere between a Belgian dark and Belgian pale, and it preforms really well there, with enough complexity to make it great."
"O: Really nice smooth feeling on the tongue with nice flavors and aromas."
"The first tastes I detect are an odd combination of sharp apple cider tartness, freshly baked whole-grain breads, and some of the preserved apricots I thought I'd detected in the smell. The acidity of the brew is fairly well balanced by the semi-sweet graininess. The overall texture of the beer is thick and dry."
"A lot more drinkable than expected. Looks bloody awful in the glass though."
"D-this actually goes down a lot better than most belgians. i do love a good belgian, but i find most to be too heavy to be drinkable, some heavier than the ABV suggests...but not this one. it stays great all the way through. i'll be recommending this to others. JUST ONE MORE THING: In no way, is this is a great BSPA. it doesn't remind me of one at all. instead, i think if you're in to dubbels, this is a good beer for you. I'm actually surprised it isn't listed as one."
"Overall one of my favorite Belgian beers, perhaps my favorite after Orval."
"Overall: A suprise, but not a good one. Michael Jackson raved about this one, and I found it to be average to above average at best. Perhaps the times have caught up to this one, or there was something wrong with my bottle. Slightly above average, but there are dozens of Belgian beers to drink before this one."
"O - Keep the gimmicky glassware, just give me the beer :)"
"Kwak is sort of the anatomical skeleton of Belgian ales; its conventional, unvarnished qualities provide a plain, paradigmatic taste of the style and a quintessential, agreeable learning experience for young reviewers, curious drinkers or aficionados alike. Despite being an ale stripped-down to its bare essentials, it's still an enjoyable, social and perfectly acceptable beer worth drinking (or at least trying to pour properly) at least once."
"O - 8% ABV not that much of a factor, a solid good beer but not up to the complexity level I had expected, I would drink it again but I will not seek it out 3.5"
"Pauwel Kwak has an amber/red colour and an excellent 2 cm head that lasts. This is a great looking beer, although not exactly pale. The smell is yeasty and a little sour with hints of apple. This beer is lovely and malty with some caramel notes. The alcohol is pretty noticeable. There are some notes of apple toward the end. This beer is thick and foamy in the mouth and really delicious."
"D: High alcohol content means drink it with care. As it isn't as sweet as some Big Belgians, i'd consider it slightly more drinkable."
"D: A good one to try, but many other Belgians provide more complexity and interesting qualities. Still glad I tried it and may come back to it every once in awhile."
"D A fine beer, I will be purchasing more of this. 4.5"
"Quite a strong taste and definitely a brew to try, though over the years this one has sunk in my list from a personal favourite to just a solid, good beer as I now tend more towards dubbels and quads."
"D - I had this on one other occasion and enjoyed it much, much more than this. This one is like a bad American attempt at a Belgian amber ale. A lacking of almost all the classic characteristics that make Belgian beer what it is. It's drinkable for the alcohol percent but towards the bottom of the glass, drinker be ware of the air bubble that shoots more than a mouthful your way."
"very interesting brew ... right after serving it (chilled) there was some taste of medecine and especially sage (a taste I particularly dislike) ... but once it 'warmed' up to around 12°C or 54F the spicy tastes become more integrated, making the beer rather pleasant .... as it is full bodied with strong taste it would make a great food compagnion .... Shanghai and Peking cuisine would be suited particularly by it .... funny enough it's reputation comes from wagoners ...."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, alcohol, and a nutty note. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but was not awe-inspiring in any way. I know that some people swear by this beer, but I just don't see it. Sure it is an okay brew, but there really isn't any complexity or depth to it in my opinion. I would probably buy this just to get the Kwak glass, but that is about it."
"D - The drinkability is not that high, even for a Belgian ale. The alcohol hints and the intense sweetness make this beer a sipper at max."
"This was recommended to me by the waiter at Waterzooi.. with my mussels. He picked this one our for me given what I was eating and though it would go well, which it undoubtedly did. It was served in small yard style glass in a wooden holder. Very crisp, almost grassy aromas- reminiscent of hayfields or being out somewhere on a meadow. Taste was fresh and somewhat bitter, with some subtle tartness in the back of the sip. The beer has strength, but you can't really tell when eating. Goes great with food, especially with mussels in a creamy bacon sauce. I have to say the experience was great and this beer added to it."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how much flavor was up front. Stronger brews can tend to save all of their punch for the very last drop, with an explosion of flavoring and alcohol at the back. Here, however, everything robust about it is laid out in the start of the sip, which is certainly interesting. Although we were not able to enjoy this brew out of its traditional glass, it provided a fine tasting, but was a bit cumbersome."
"Decent drink, but the sweetness is pretty unusual. Probably wouldn't drink it again."
"Not one I'd drink all the time, but very nice when in the mood for alcoholic caramel."
"Slightly warming with a somewhat sharp effervescence bite at the front. Mellows nicely, leaving a malty, spicy grape aftertaste. Medium/full body. A decent brew but not great."
"Very nice blend of Fruits, malts, yeasts, some hops and a big alcohol kick kept this brew interesting and enjoyable."
"D- This beer lacks complexity. But if you like black licorice and an alcoholic sting in the back of your throat whilst a cold is on, Kwak does the job nicely."
"D- this was an average beer at best for the style. i dont think ill be picking this one up again anytime soon. i wouldnt mind having it again in the special glass though."
"D - I'd order again, I think it was only 6 during happy hour so it was worth it to me"
"Fruitiness is strong on the tongue; red apple, dried apricot and pineapple. There's a caramelized malt backbone along with a light spiciness. The body is medium, though the beer feels overly sweet halfway through the glass. The finish is semi-dry, bready, a bit peppery."
"D: I don't really care for Kwak, but I picked these up on discount and wondered what would happen. Now I know. I have a few more bottles and will drink when I want something special, but not too heavy."
"D: This beer is a lot different then anything I've ever had. It's not a bad beer but I couldn't have more than one in one sitting. It's not because of the high Abv I enjoyed that. The taste is just too sweet. It's almost a chore to finish the last couple sips."
"330ml Bottle, poured into leffe goblet, less than 1 finger head, brownish ruby colour,hazy. Sweet corky, hoppy smell. Tastes of sweet wheat, not much carbonation, reminds me of Fullers ESB, abv is more apparent as you drink more. Could have 2 but not more, uncomplex but decent, glad I've tried this but would not seek it out."
"One that changes in the glass a bit, and has great elements to it. Decent balance, hidden alcohol levels, but one you can't go too fast or too slow through. Anytime you can put big sips down of an 8% brew, it is obvious that it is well made. It lacks some refinement and in the end you finish it because it is in your glass and not because you want it."
"Rather different from what I expected. Tasty but not particularly inspiring - but there is a certain rustic-ness that is growing on me."
"A good, not great beer. There's better examples of the style out there, but it's hitting the spot after dinner. I'd drink it again for the right price."
"This beer pours with minimal head which dissipates pretty quickly. The color is good copper. This beer smells of bananas, caramel, and a bit of vanilla. The beer is sweet with the same banana caramel and vanilla and a little bit of booze in the aftertaste. It really does have a good mouthfeel and average drinkability."
"A complex and powerful ale, with a pronounced and artfully balanced malt character. A bit too heavy for session drinking. Worth imbibing to experience the authentic glassware ""system."" Pairs well with salty Pommes Frites and dipping mayo."
"D: Not my favorite. A little raw and complex. Easy to get your fill after a few ounces, after that you get sick of it pretty quick"
"D: Cloying sweetness kills the beer."
"A big, and hefty-seeming version of the style, especially for the pale variety, and an uncomplicated boozy fruit bomb at times, the California Cabernet of Belgian strong ales, one sans overt skin extraction. Anyways, a tasty, somewhat off-kilter brew, where I can't help but be reminded of having just watched the Three Sheets episode where Zane expounds on the virtue of the marriage of alcohol and sugar."
"Poured a huge head and looked quite attractive with sort of a peach tea appearance. Taste was very mild and a little sweet with creamy malt. Mouthfeel was above average. Personally I thought this was decent in most categories but with the sole exception that it just didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting. Still, a quality brew."
"D: maybe one of the worst Belgians I've ever had, too much alcohol, too little taste."
"This is not a bad beer, it just doesn't hold a candle to other Belgians in terms of flavor. And what's with the bizarro glass? Dare I say marketing ploy?"
"drinkability: A little too intense and not quite balanced enough to rate high in drinkability."
"Taste: Bit of alcohol. Unidentifiable fruitiness and sugar. A much more simple beer than I was expecting."
"jd"
"Not really sessionable I feel due to it's weight - in alcohol and overall feel. A once-in-a-while treat - after a meal or perhaps before. One of a kind."
" Pauwel Kwak wasn't created to compete with a modern hyper hopped craft beer so it shouldn't be judged against them. I'm still fond of it to a degree and it is still much better than just 'decent'."
"I like it. But for the price I think there are better beers out there. So definitely good, but I only need one every 5 years or so to remind me that I like beers that are bigger on flavor."
"Pours a hazy copper to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small fruitiness and a sweet malt. In the taste, fruity, a sweeter malt and a small roast. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, fruity aftertaste. Nice small fruitiness and easy to drink."
"I recall this beer being much, much better on tap, but that may just be the ceremony of the pouring, and the ridiculitude of the kwak glass."
"O: Good drinkability. Very Belgian Ale. Recommended"
"This beer is worth a try but is far from the best Belgium around."
"Overall not bad, but nothing more"
"Note: This bottle listed at 8.4% ABV."
"D - This is a very nice beer that is interesting and complex, but still low enough on alcohol and body that you could drink several."
"D: Not bad, but nothing extremely special."
"Quite enjoyable on-tap from a fresh keg, but I can't comment on the bottled offering."
"Cheers!"
"D: All good flavors, would seek this out to try in the cool Belgium glass. But a very good overall brew"
"Not a great beer and I don't know why people fawn for it. Must be the stupid proprietary glass."
"D: Excellent. It would definitely be very easy to knock back several of these and it wouldn't be a problem until you try to stand up. I would definitely drink this again."
"Drank several months following the ""best after"" date, which might have contributed to the slightly low carbonation and thin mouthfeel (though aging should have been fine, given the higher ABV). Mildly sweet malt profile with a hint of caramel, cinnamon, and banana. Not too much presence on the finish. Drinkable, but not especially memorable."
"Bosteels Family Brouwerij, Buggenhout, Belgium--Pauwel Kwak--Traditional Belgian Special Ale--2008 25.4 oz. Bottle. 8.0% ABV. 10 IBU's? (4.5 / 5.0) Belgian Ale. Thin fizzy mild lace head. No sediment. Hazy bright rich amber orange color. Floral malt fruit ester mild Belgian yeast ester mild hop front. Mellow sweet rich malty crisp caramel fruit ripe apple smooth body. Zesty fresh mild hop citrus clean smooth end. Easy. Sampled 8/17/2008. 1 @ $10.99."
"Actually pretty drinkable, but mostly because there are no strong flavors to offend the palate. The sweetness does start to get to you as you get on with the bottle... getting harder to drink. Overall, this is not something I would seek out - but it is pretty decent. I'm not a big fan of Belgian yeast flavors, so the lack thereof is a bit of a plus for me."
"Good, creamy mouthfeel for this beer with not as dry finish as it's taste suggests."
"D: The beer is drinkable enough I suppose. It'll definitely make you look like a badass while you're drinking it. It's worth it once, if only for the presentation. Not bad, just not great."
"M/D: So sweet that I initally gagged on the first sips, but becomes more drinkable when warming up."
"Drinkability: Kwak is ok for the style. It is very dry. I could not finish more than one glass in a sitting. Worth a try, but I think there are better in the style."
"Disappointing. On second thoughts it's substantially worse than coopers vintage, especially for the price."
"Drinkability- this beer to me had a very high drinkability it excelled at having a great balance of hops and malts and would actually reach and hit well for a lot of people who enjoy more hoppy american style strong ales then the typical belgian beer, a beer I could easily see my self downing a few of in a night, a nice beer even though a surprise"
"D: Doesn't hide enough of the alcohol for me, and overcompensates with sweetness. 75cL is probably more than I will ever need of this one."
"D: a great Belgian brew that is much classier than their gimmicky glasswear. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: Good drinkability but they definitely catch up to you quickly."
"Dark, cloudy amber or dark brown pour has a sizable white head that sticks and laces the glass. Definitely not as pale as some other Belgians in this category. Aroma is light chocolate and caramel with a nice does of hops. Sort of a stronger version of Leffe. Taste is like light caramel, very clean and non-boozy. Alcohol doesn't show in the taste, but you can tell this is a strong brew. This semi-sweet brew is a must for any Belgian lover."
"taste is smooth and dry, sweet fruit, bread dough, some caramel, and roasted malt, ends with a oily mouth-feel."
"D: Easy to drink. Nice try if you find it, tho not worth searching for it."
"In terms of appearance it starts off well but a lack of lacing prevents it from earning any further points. Smell is great as is the taste. Highly recommended - don't worry about the gimicky glass, it's still a damn good beer!"
"Happened to stop at the Tap & Mallet while in Rochester, NY April 27, 2010. Reps from Brouwerij Bosteels as well as their US distributor had an impromptu tasting, if I understood right just because they were in town. Presented (in the proper glassware to boot) with a slightly cloudy light brown brew with a light white head which left nice lacing. Smelled lightly of apple cider and caramel malt. Tasted very much of green apples, semi sweet, keep thinking cider on this. Mouthfeel was medium to full, perfect amount of carbonation. So very drinkable with the alcohol hidden who knows where, could be dangerous."
"The 8.4% ABV sneeks up on you, the sweetness and lightness of the body lull you into a false sence of security, and just as you finish the beer to ask for another you realise the room isn't in focus as much as it was before you started drinking. A very drinkable beer and a flavourite of my wife and daughter."
"Medium bodied and smooth, with some carbonation tingling. Nice easy sipper here. This one is recommended for sure."
"The beer is solid and good, very sweet, probably best after food, with a ripe cheese."
"I would buy this again-not sure if I missed much not tasting it in it's official glass. All in all very enjoyable."
"Pretty sweet, medium to light body carbonation low in mouth. Good finish with a slight grainy bitterness at the end. Drinkability high. Some alcohol in the mouth, overall really good."
"Comes in a bottle that's heavy enough to kill when swung properly, and corked tighter than anything I've ever encountered. Had to struggle mightily with this one. Cloudy iced-tea in color with a manilla-folder-colored head which disappeared quickly. Aroma was rather weak, but I could still find some pears and apricots hiding in there, plus a strong belt of honey and some graham crackers (plain, not cinnamon, and not that cheap crap from Trader Joe's, either). Very smooth body with just a little thickness to provide some resistance; low carbonation as expected. Quite balanced in the taste: pumpernickel bread, cherries and apricots, more honey and a fistful of carmel malt. Nothing was terribly overpowering, yet I could taste everything distinctly. Low hop content and relatively high ABV makes this a nice thing to sip slowly while watching a Bogart movie, which is what my wife and I did. Well worth the expense and the uncorking effort."
"D: This 8% ABV Belgian pale is not quite what I expected, but as far as they go, it's a decent strong ale. Flavoring and color seem a bit off to me, but the overall product is a pretty balanced, fruity Belgian ale. It's alright."
"D: It goes down pretty easy but it's better to sip this one and enjoy it."
"Underrated in my opinion; I wonder if the gimicky glass P.O.s some folks so they ding the beer. Had a bottle of this at our local Belgian beer joint, in that gimicky glass. It tastes no different in a tulip glass, frankly. I followed this up with a still legal Duvel here in PA, and, heretically, the Kwak was better, just seemed to have more body and flavor. The EtOH is a little noticable, but not overbearing...Or maybe it WAS the glass..."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is full and rich, there is a thickness of alcohol that doesn't burn, but the mouthfeel is boozy. This is quite drinkable for the style, I won't feel odd about ordering a ""Kwak"" again."
"Drinkability: A very tasty beer but a bit of an oddity as it really doesn't fit the style as listed. Still a beer I would reccommend to fans of Abbey style beer and barleywines. This beer also seems to be much better on tap and fresh."
"Drinkability: Truth be known, I just bought this set for the glass, plus it's Belgian, so how could i go wrong? Well this beer is not the best example of what the Belgians have to offer. Try something different and then come around to this one, to see if it's something you like....in fact take the three remaining bottles off of my hand....I wouldn't mind one bit, but the cool mini-yard glass and stand stays with me!"
"D: Wholly uneventful, but still quite pleasant. I wouldn't shell out for another, but I didn't mind getting this as a gift."
"D= I expected a lot more from this beer. To me it tastes like sugar water. I don't understand this one at all. Not recommended to anyone unless you like macro lagers with sugar."
"i'm glad I didn't buy it and wont have it again. worst belgium beer ever had thus far"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 2 inch head of an off-white color. There is also a lot of suspended sediment. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, hint of pale malt, slight sugar, hint of dough, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet malt, slight yeast, slight sugar, hint of hop, slight pale malt, slight alcohol, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and feel."
"overall a solid brew but nothing special, good but a bit sweet and way too heavy on the booze."
"D - Takes some getting used to. Not like other belgians. A little too sweet for me."
"D: Try it once for the glass, but don't expect more than an average amber."
"From a slightly sweet nose and sweet maltiness that inevitably recalls the nougat, beer tastes quite light. And although the supply of malt flavors of caramel pleasant, the body is still quite flat. The finish is slightly spicy and alcoholic, and even a bit earthy. Good beer, far from being exceptional, but whose reputation is almost mythical drink based solely on the container, that is to say the glass bracket extremely charismatic hosts Kwak, much more than beer in it itself."
"Hadn't had this for a while and I thought the reviews on here seemed a little harsh. But unfortunately I'm finding myself agreeing with most of them. A little lacking in depth compared to other Belgian Strong ALes. Very malt and alcohol heavy with nothing too remarkable to intice you to come back for more. Decent, but I won't be hurrying back."
"Surprisingly hop forward with some subtle earthy hoppy bitterness which is nicely balanced by a sweet caramel malt backbone with hints of toffee and, caramel, slight nut character and subtle dark fruit notes. Possibly some raisin and fig notes. Very well balanced and the bitterness up front actually lingers throughout into a slightly dry sweet finish. ABV decently masked making Kwak pretty quaffable."
"D- the bitter sour finish is a little off-putting for me. probably wouldn't buy again."
"I like this beer. It's easy to drink and if you're looking to try it, go for the 330ml bottle. Also, take it easy with this one. Deceptively drinkable."
"Overall, this is a really unique and complex beer. I didn't really know what to expect before drinking it, but this was a pleasant surprise. There's a lot of character and complexity in this brew and I would definitely recommend trying it."
"Bottom line...not as good as the Tripel, but still try it."
"In the end - I'd pass on popping hard earned money on this. Stay local and stay fresh."
"Drinkability is good and I must say that I would lean toward putting this one in the Belgian strong DARK category as the flavor profile seems to lean that way, even if the color is not quite to that standard."
"perhaps if I had a Kwak glass to drink out of it would have been a little more fun, but this beer didn't do a whole lot for me, I'm not saying its offensive I was just expecting a little more"
" Doubtful I'll buy one again.. unless the price is cut in half. Decent brew though. Cheers!"
"D- If my wallet would allow I would probably love another couple, but I did enjoy this one on its own... I'll take what I can get"
"This is a beer that I enjoy. I don't think it is world class, but it is an easy drinker and will always have a place in my glass collection and in my beer collection."
"What else can I say. Yummm...."
"This has been a pleasantly consistent beer for me. Never anything aggressive or overwhelming, but always enjoyable, clean, and possessing a nice balance of character."
"Drank the beer in the original glass. The Kwak has a nice amberlike colour with a nice and firm head. Smelling strong caramel. It's not my kind of beer but what the he..! There is not much more to say about this beer. Though the appearance is good the rest is waste of time."
"Drinkability - This is a great sipping beer. After my evening meal, I am not looking for anything complex or a beer to wake up my mouth. This beer gives a nice initial burst of flavor then fades in the middle and finish. Perfect for a late evening, slow sipping night cap - enjoy!"
"D - A very well balanced beer with good taste and mouthfeel."
"Alcohol needs to be tamed, more depth in the flavours is necessary, but otherwise, not too bad!"
"Medium body, maybe leaning more towards light, with a nice creamy texture with a more than adequate amount of carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer, I have had it before and remember not being that impressed. I dunno if it was the glassware, the fact it was on-tap, my mood and/or the environment, or a mixture of all variables, but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer this time around."
"D-This one is starting to grow on me, and is much better warm (warmer than they recommend at 5-6 degrees C), but I have to stand by my original perceptions. At 8.4% abv one is perfect. Any more just screams hangover."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. The only disappointment is the aftertaste really falls flat."
"Drinkability: Good Price quality ratio. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Its a decent Belgian beer although i stuggle to label it. Its definetely not a Belgian Pale Ale though, if anything it trades closer to a Dubbel."
"Not a terrible Belgian Pale Ale if you're into that style."
"The carbonation is low and the mouthfeel is define by the malty flavour, along with a reasonable bitterness. Due to the complexity of the brew, the drinkability is not that high. It is in some ways reminiscient of a trappist beer, although not as good."
"Drinkability: Sure, nice and complex with a lot of pretty unique traits but a lot of small factors are missing to those traits, which all together simply end up leaving this one standing at the finish line of the ""Superb brew Marathon"". To clarify: there is absolutely nothing wrong with this ""Belgian strong pale ale", it is in fact pretty good, its just that it exists a whole bunch of better ones out there so why necessarily choose this one in nine times out of ten?"
"I'd recommend trying it."
"This is a dessert in a bottle for sure, a strong Belgian ale meant for slow sippin to cap the night off with a bang."
"The taste is light spice cake, buttery tpast, grain, fruit, malty and caramelly with light earthy notes, all well integrated and balanced aside from the fact that it is clearly quite sweet, with light spice and only a hint of bitterness. Alcohol is barely noticeable, aside form ading to the lightly spicey-warm character and feel. It does not taste as strong as it is."
"Drinkability: Even with the awesome glassware, this is a little bit sweet and lacks complexity to really warrant repeat consumption. Does not compare favorably with their other beers."
"D - If it was the only 6 pack, I would not complain."
"Has a beautiful deep red-orange color like a deep amber. Head was a bubble beige that dissipated rather quickly; although a thin head did linger. Armoa was pretty yeasty with a bit of malt, and the taste had a mix of a bready and fruity taste. The alcohol slightly makes itself apparent as it warms up. Slightly creamy and bubbly when drinking. Overall another good Belgian ale."
"Overall a decent beer. Finishes quick and doesn't have quite the complexity of other Belgians, but nonetheless enjoyable."
"M/d: the feel is smooth but heavy and slightly syrupy. The drinkability is easy an good for containing a decent amount of alcohol."
"D - excellent taste and mouthfeel. This is a great sipping beer."
"Taste is musty off the bat with with herbal notes and a fairly pronounced fruity sweetness. Ripe apples and bready yeast with a hint of buttery mellowness. Not particularly complex, and maybe leaning on the side of sweet, yet not cloying. Mouthfeel is zippy but not overly carbonated, as I find some Belgians to be. Soft and smooth, slides down easily. This is a decent Belgian pale, but far from the best."
"The taste is very Belgianesque, very sweet from the candied sugars, very floral, lots of clove, some pineapple, some rind flavors. There is a definite booziness to the beer, especially prevalent on the back end and beyond. The 8% ABV comes out as the beer settles. There is a touch of some sweet caramel in there too. This is a nice Belgian, pretty characteristic for the style, flavorful, and full palated. A nice seeker outer."
"Drinkability: This is not a complex beer but I did enjoy it for most of the beer. (But I must confess I was almost ready for it to end before it did.) I would not want more than one of these at a sitting and give a choice there are others I'll choose over it. I also find it hard to think of this as being the same style as Duvel and Delerium Tremens."
"D - average taste at 8% would lead me to something a bit more flavorful in that ABV range."
"D - There are some great Strong Belgian Ales out there that manage to deliver flavour that is not negatively effected by the high ABV. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that this struggles to get the mix right. Don't get me wrong, it's is an enjoyable drink but I can't help feeling that the flavours could be stronger."
"On-tap at Saucer served in a Kwak Coachman's glass complete with the wood stand that I get to keep! Served a crisp light ruby with a decent head that slowly diminished to a thin layer. Aroma was slight sweet fruits with hints of gelatin. The taste is a decent amount of sweet fruits, candi sugar and slight dried fruit and spice, interesting blend. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence. This is a unique beer to say the least, but not something I'd seek out regularly."
"Big malty goodness. I like this one."
"D) A good brew. Well crafted Belgian."
"D: This is a nice introduction to the belgian world of beers. It's not the most complex belgian beer, but it's a nice start before you try the dubbel and tripel Trappistbeers. This is a beer you should try at least once."
"Semi-hazy dark apricot color is the best way to describe the color of this beer, so I little darker than your average blonde. Some mushy bananas and clove emerge from the aroma, but so does some odd-flavored husky malt. It holds true even in the taste. There are some traditional Belgian characteristics, such as candi sugar and banana, but that stale, husky grain is turning me off. Add in husky, bland pilsner malt to the equation, and now my palate is filing for a divorce. I do like the creamy mouthfeel this beer has, but by now, it is too late. There are so many better options out there."
"Overall not bad, but forgettable. Dont know if I would pay for this one again, just does not seem worth it to me."
"had on tap in the wooden holder pours a light brown murky color with a quickly dissipating head that leaves just a small ring to the end..the smell is musty and fruity with pepper smells the taste is the same its musty some peat mixed with fruit s apples melon some pepper..i enjoyed this ale alot and will have it again"
"Drinkability: Better than remember, though, and I hate to admit this, I have gotten sweeter with age. All in all, it's sweet, warming, and generally agreeable, but I recommend serving it up in the proper Kwak glass."
"This is a decent Belgian strong that doesn't really stand out in any way but is pretty smooth going down."
"Drinkability - It's a good BSPA, and one of my favorites. I've had many over the years and never been disappointed."
"This beer is a deep and quite transparent bronze color with a very slight, wispy head. The aroma is a modest mix of yeast, esters, and moderately toasted malt. The malt has a bread-crust character, and the esters carry a little ripe fruit, and are backed by a Belgian yeast scent. No real alcohol in the aroma, despite the ABV, however, it is present in the taste. The taste itself is semi-sweet, with a distinct peppery and hop bitterness. Some warming. Some phenols come out more in the taste. Fairly full in mouthfeel, which gives the beer a very satisfying sensation. All in all, this one is pretty good."
"Kwak does have a soft creamy feel on the palate however with the exception of the glassware it is very bland."
"D: A very tasty Belgian ale for sure. A bit pricey, but worth it IMO. Kind of a hybrid of the BSPA and BSDA."
"D - Overall its an ok beer not the best Belgian or my first choice for a beer from the country it is an interesting beer thats worth a try though"
"Foam was white wheat in color, thick, bubbly and hung around till the end. Smell was somewhat bitter wheat, fruity undertones and a hops balance. Color was a amber mahogany and some gold in the light. Taste was a med. deep feel, good hops and wheat balance and yeasty undertones. Mouthfeel - full-bodied, smooth and thick. Drinkability - good but not excellent."
"I would say it's one of the high class Belgian ales, very well drinkable on several occasions."
"Poured bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a nice dark amber color with a fluffy white head. Lots of floral fruity malts in the aroma with some citrus and spice. Very fruity and sweet in the taste with a huge malt backbone. Finishes quite smooth. Easy to drink but it is a little too sweet for me. I couldn't enjoy more than a couple glasses in a setting. Will try again."
"D - The higher ABV would limit this to maybe two bottles, but the taste is just right in terms of sweetness (not cloying at all) and the mouthfeel makes it go down easy. I wish it smelt better, as that would help me get the glass to my lips more often."
"It's medium to full bodied. I would try to have more than one just to use the wooden holder again."
"D: Very easy drinker. I was expecting this to be a bit of a challenge to tackle for some reason, but it goes down very easily. Sits nice and light. Tastes are good and the beer is very refreshing. I could have easily had another, but I had already had enough by this point. Very enjoyable brew with a beautiful presentation. Worth exploring again in the future in my opinion."
"Served complete. Holder and all. They went all out with this beer. I would love to see an American brewery make a beer that is poured into a glass that requires a stand. That would rule. Orange to amber. Thin head. Looks good. I had this beer in Belgium a few times, but I can not remember it. Candied sugar. Hard candy aromas. Flavors are candyish as well. Tasty. I could see it getting old. Fairly thin bodied. I could not session this beer for sure, but good by itself. One at a time."
"This smells better than it tastes. Overall, it isn't bad. But, lacks in complexity of flavors I expect from a Belgian dark ale."
"D- Moderate drinkability. Semi crisp"
"Alcohol is absent - where are you, 8%??? And mouthfeel coats your mouth deliciously as it goes through. Obviously a very competent beer, I just find it a bit lacking in taste. Just a bit, mind you."
"With a full stomach I would go for a second without complains..."
"D: Relatively tolerable 8% ABV. If you like the Belgian ales, you have to try it; it won't be anything exceptional, but its solid."
"D: This is a decent beer, a couple of notches above average. It lacks some character, but at the same time the taste feels heavy."
"Served in the Kwak glass at Bouzy. The presentation was nice with the glass and wooden stand. The apppearance is golden with thick and creamy head which was fairly large. The nose was sweet fruity with biscuty notes and sharp alcohol. I trying to be objective, I really liked the taste, but I realize the alcohol bite may be a little up front for some folks. The mouthfeel is full bodied. I would have given it a higher drinkability rating but with 8.0abv, it may be a little rough."
"Overall, a pretty average Belgian. Its taste is lacking in complexity."
"D: The flavor is right on with the level of alcohol. It really is sub-standard compared to the top Belgians of the style and it really offers nothing unique or all that pleasureable. Happy to try but won't be seeking out again anytime too soon."
"Dangerously good drinkability."
"D 3.5, a bit of a macro commercial brewery clean/crispness, sweet but balanced, very different than what I expected for a Belgian, I wouldn't turn one down, but it's not my first pic either."
"Med/thin body, drinkable."
"Overall a pretty good Belgian ""amber"". I would like to experience it on draft in the proper glassware, but a regular 11.2oz bottle was adequate."
"D - At 8% ABV, this is certainly a drinkable Belgian Pale Ale. However, the aroma is fairly muted and the flavor is a bit undefined. Nothing exceptional, but worth a try if you like Belgian style ales."
"m/d - Felt fine, not too thick. Drinkable but unique, worth a try."
"D: Certainly worth it for the glass itself. Drinks a lot lighter than it is. Worth a revisit."
"Hope this helps. Enjoy!"
"Not bad. A lot better than I was expecting, though it does not hold up to my favorites of the style."
"The cost is a bit high, but if I ever have a pocketfull of money and this one is around, I will give it another try."
"D - Despite the sweetness this is still a very drinkable beer. Nothing spectacular but good enough."
"Overall, very interesting. Yummy, but not something that would keep me coming back. Glad I tried it. Likely won't drink it much in the future."
"ah, ok... i guess i now know the frame of reference for allagash and southampton grand cru. the BA classification of ""belgian [strong] pale"" can range from duvel, to orval and even other brett/wilds like de proef flemish primitive, to this. hmm..."
"Overall: a good sipping beer, warming; like drinking mulled cider or wine."
"A malty pale ale with nice hop bitterness. Lacking any notable ""Belgian"" character, but no significant flaws. Drinkable, but the carbonation gets in the way a bit."
"Drinkability is low here. Not thinking too much of this."
"I wasn't excited by this at all. Seems fairly gimmicky."
"Drinkability - Very smooth and goes down easy. Gift pack was a bit pricey, but I'd look into the possibility of buying single bottles again."
"o:dryness helps with drinkability and alcohol hinders slightly. i question the care that was taken with my bottle so i may be skewed. a good beer and the caramelazation is enjoyable but the yeast profile and malt complexity are limited. not a beer that i would have often."
"+/- yea, i could drink another one if i had one, but I wouldn't buy another one when faced with another option in the genre."
"Drinkability: Overall a nice beer. Not the best Belgium beer I've had but wouldn't pass it up if offered"
"Overall, Kwak is a very nice and complex beer. It is quite different from the majority of Belgium ales and definitely a must try."
"I'm a bit dissapointed to be honest, but if you're into different brews, this might be interesting."
"Ok brew with decent drinkability, but nothing to interesting to pick up again."
"Kwak is okay, but it never wowed me with any sort of pizzazz. Tastes good, but it's kind of light. It didn't come at all close to delivering a good, solid sole-shaking balance. Nothing about it is bad, it just isn't interesting. With so many great BSPAs out there, why bother with Pauwel Kwak? To be fair, everything deserves a second chance; I'll give Kwak another shot after my palate has expanded."
"D - This is a very nice tasting brew. Flavors are complex and unique."
"I wish i bought more then 1 bottle."
"Overall a tasty but uneventful experience."
"A 750 mL corked bottle of the Kwak. Beer has a nice profile: dark amber colored liquid beneath a frothy head. The aroma is slightly sweet hovering over a Belgian background of yeast and earthiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slippery. A caramel sweetness meets the taste buds up front and gives way to a slightly acidic, spicy husky malt combination with a twist of funk. The alcohol is noticeable at the end. A decent beer. Different in the flavor profile that it presents and reasonable drinkable."
"Tastes great! Even better than the smell. Very fruity beer with a touch of cirtus fruit, a bit like a unmatured orange or something. The beer in general is dominated by a very special sweet maltiness balanced by a light hoppiness."
"I've always heard this was an interesting brew and it didn't disappoint. It immediately reminded me of an oak-aged beer for the mellow, earthy spice. There are also notes of caramel and molasses with dried berries in the background. It's not the most complex Belgian, but at 8% abv its very drinkable and worth a try for something different."
"HV"
"Not very complex and a bit thin, but still very tasty."
"Glad I tried it, but, I'm not sure I'd run for another."
"There are much more interesting brews to drop $$ on than this."
"This one's fairly mediocre, easily bested by some of the more well-known Belgian strong ales out there"
"Drinkability is moderate. Decent flavor and mouthfeel make for pretty easy consumption."
"Mouthfeel is light. the carbonation makes it that way. In the absence of carbonation this would be on viscous beer. Alcohol presents on the far palate."
" A duck pairing would do this beer well, or maybe the duck would be ""kwaking"" in a Kwak apricot reduction. I love the history behind this brew, and its fun to drink. Thanks Mum!"
"Pours a murky amber with a thin creme head. Malty and sugary sweet nose. Minor caramel. Sweetness bites on the flavor. It's heavy; the sugar that is. Thick malted tones are there too. Robust and deeper. Feel has a full carbonation and a smooth liquid feel. Nice to drink, though a bit distinct with it's firm flavor profile."
"Notes: Another incredible beer on tap at the Bier Markt. If you are close to Cleveland then you should check that place out."
"A 330 ml bottle poured into a Kwak-branded mini-yard. Old-gold color with a solid rocky head that lingers due to the higher level or carbonation. Fruity, estery aroma with a mild malt nose, no hop aroma I could detect. Comes with that a sweet taste that would quickly become cloying without the astringency from the higher ABV. A full bodied belgian that is kept within tolerable range by the ABV and a mild hop bitterness. The degree of sweetness makes 330 ml enough for a sitting."
"The drink is medium-bodied and very tasty, but I probably would rather share a 750 or try the drink in smaller bottles."
"Medium to full bodied with abundant carbonation. I would rate drinkability as merely average. High cost, ABV and an average taste being the factors."
"Poured a golden orange and had a small head to it. It had a kind of sour yeast smell to it. Tasted decent although nothing outstanding, I detected a fruity flavor to it up front and had a hoppy sour almost mouth puckering ending. Other than the cool glass this is sometimes served in I didn't find this one too impressive. It's not a bad by any means, just not something I would have enough interest to try again."
"Pours a dark honey color with a rolling light tan two-finger head that fades somewhat slowly leaving a thin lacing all around the glass. Some yeast sediment floats around. Smells big and yeasty up front with an essence of sweet bread in the middle as well as plums and other dark fruits. Tastes bready, estery and sweet with some subtle medicinal qualities lurking in the background along with a nice touch of alcohol heat and hop bitterness. This is a medium-bodied, well-carbonated and tasty brew that should satisfy your Belgian fix."
"Appearance is a hazy-copper color with a rocky off-white head that settles around the perimeter of the glass. Aroma has awesome smells of Belgian malt that suggest fig and burnt sugar, but oh my, there is a bit of oxidation in the background. That's OK because the taste makes up for any errors. Flavor is bursting with Belgian malts and again fruits like fig and black cherry. A flowery hop aroma and flavor dress up this beer nicely but bitterness could be ramped up a bit to balance the sweetness. Nice touch of alcohol warmth in the finish of this medium full-bodied beer. A nicely sophisticated beer."
"overall, a very enjoyable beer, kind of tastes like a hybrid between a Belgian Tripel and a vienna Lager or Irish Red style. very good overall. I would definitely buy again."
"The next step on our crash course in Belgian beer appreciation. Wanted something to go with bratwurst and mustard and the Belgian is the match. The pour is a nice orange amber, much less carbonation than the Duvel for example, and very little head remains after a few minutes. Aroma has that phenolic aromatic component and some orchard fruit. On the palate some sweet malty components, raisiny and apple, hop bitterness emerges in the finish. Nothing particularly complex or intense, but quite decent - in the second tier of Belgians we have tried."
"The aroma was pleasant with apples and brown sugar. The malt backbone came through really sweet with some biscuit flavor. It was semi dry in the mouth and not very carbonated. Overall it was pretty average and I probably won't buy it again."
"definately a great easy drinker"
"D - A little sweeter and maltier than I expected but very enjoyable."
"Notes:It is from Belgium so it is held to a higher standard and because of this I believe it falls short of expectations. Despite all the negatives, this brew is not nearly close to bad. The feel is really smooth and while not complex it was not the worst experience. Maybe some malt?,maybe some more carbo? I really could not say. I do feel that the alcohol is not well masked and that I did not like. I suppose I was disappointed."
"Overall, a bit too heavy and sweet. Not a lot of complexity and the alcohol is a bit too prominent. Closer to a strong dark, but without the bready, spicy component."
"D: On the whole this isn't a bad beer, but not a great one either. If you hadn't ever had an excellent Belgian strong pale ale, then this might suffice."
"Definitely drinkable!"
"D = Not a bad drink, but I doubt I'll search this one out often given the other possibilities. Still definitely wouldn't run it down either."
"Poured from bottle at Brasserie Beck in downtown, DC. (Nifty glass that sits in its own wooden cradle.) Great stuff -- a tad sweet however -- with the aroma of dates and candied Belgian goodness. Superb, frothy, dense head and great lacing, silky mouthfeel. Turned more complex as it warmed and then my notes became unreadable."
"D: Good quaf but I would not go back to it again."
"T + M + D: Sweet, malty, with some fruity flavours. A bit of alcohol spiciness. All around, not incredibly complex, and not as silky and seductive as some of the Belgian ales can be. Carbonation starts off a little expressive, and mellows substantially as the drink warms. It goes down very easily, though... despite the higher alcohol content, it's one that can be quaffed without second thought. Just make sure you know to turn the glass through the neck if going for the gimmick of the glass."
"D- I like this beer, the glass is a novelty yes but the beer on its own is a nice malty belgian, not often i say that!, Some nice fruit and spice notes also which compliment."
"Recommended..."
"d: has a very german sense to it with really strong sweeter malt flavors; an interesting take on the belgian and an ok beer; worth a try"
"Pretty solid overall, but it doesn't knock me to the floor."
"This is the most effort I've ever put into finishing a beer that wasn't something from the Budwiser/Genny macrobrew family. Ouch. The color and the nose will fool you. It smells passable and appears as it should, compared to the genre. At taste, it is painfully sweet, an utter lack of balance. there's noting here but malt and sugar. I tried to pass this on to my sugar-addicted girlfriend and she was repulsed by it. It is a recent bottling according to the label."
"A nice brew."
"This is a nice example of the Belgian group. POurs a beautiful head and nice light brownish color. I also marked this high because I thought all the floaties were cool. The taste was malty and some citrus in the background. The carbonation was good. The finish was nice. Can't say anything bad about this; but this is not exceptional; just worthy."
"I wouldn't drink more than one at a time, though."
"B'ham UK Jan 2008"
"D-This might be a new favorite,depending on availability and of course price."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability is excellent, as the alcohol is barely noticeable. So much going on in this one, you could have many and not get bored. At 8%, this is not exactly sessionable, but I want another. The only draw-back is the price this place charges, but that's a function of the bar, not the beer."
"A beautiful beer. A must have around my house."
"Drinkability: Doesn't taste as strong a 8%. Fairly smooth, with a cross-seasonal taste. Enjoyable and refreshing though not the beer that leaves one craving another."
"Cannot beleive this beer is rated lower than karmeliet. I think Kwak is the staple of bosteels. Pours an amber color with decent head. tastes of dark fruit and has all the characteristics of a true belgian strong. very drinkable and creamy in the mouth. the finish is very smooth and only a bit of flavor lacking in the aftertaste, but overall a very good ale. i was impressed with this beer."
"Below average for a well-known imported Belgium."
"d- Starts out okay, but the fruity taste is a bit over powering, so im definitely not going to drink more than one at a time. and probably wont by it again."
"got the gift box mostly due to the sweet-ass coachman's glass/stand that this is drunk out of. this is a hazy deep brown amber with a tan head. most of the sediment was left in the bottle but some large floaties escaped. aromas of nuts, rum, and fruit along with roasty, spicy, and musty/barnyard notes. taste was mostly sourish with a bit of dark sweet malts. a bit of husky graininess as well. minimal hop bitterness. prominent alcohol presence which is not my thing. mouthfeel was light to medium and kinda flat/watery on the back end despite the high level of carbonation in this. drinkability suffers due to the high abv and my struggle to finish it in order to move on to a two hearted ale."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice golden color with kinda an orange hue to it. The beer seemed really carbonated and had fine bubbles in its nice head. The beer smelled bready/yeasty/fruity. It also tasted fruity with a slight tinge of oranges. A malty thickness finish and a bit too much alcohol for me. I will not buy again."
"Overall, a big ale to enjoy in small amounts."
"Drinkability: good beer in the style Belgian strong ale , but I prefer the draught version (++)."
"Served in an interesting glass held by a wooden handle that is specific to the beer. Nice dark honey color with thick off-white head that leaves foamy lace. Smells mild and sweet with fruit, maybe banana. The taste is malty with clear bananas and spice in the initial flavor transitions quickly into lightly hopped malty flavor with strong alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is creamy with soft carbonation and a sweet finish. Overall, this is too sweet and fruity for me, though it is interesting. I would probably not buy again."
"I thought this brew was excellent. Its not very delicate as other Belgium-like examples of the style, but way more drinkable than most. Very good."
"A very nice golden brown pour with a nice off white head. To me this beer tastes a little on the sweet side. I get some nice carmel undertones with a simple malt finish. This beer is smooth and clean with mild carbonation and very worth a try. Its also fun to say... KWAK! KWAK!! Try this beer with a light warm meal, maybe a turkey melt, and you will be in glutton heaven."
"Overall: This beer was good. I think it deserves a slightly higher rating than the one it currently has. 3.78"
"11.2 oz bottle. The beer pours a deep golden color with very little head that falls to a few islands over top. There is a ton of chunky business in the brew but otherwise clarity is good and the carbonation is minimal. The aroma is a bit grainy, with a mild raisin sweetness. It gives me the impression of biscuit in the malt character, which is not my favorite aroma. The flavor is mild grainy biscuit with a more mild raisin sweetness that is accentuated with a touch of caramel. I'm not real thrilled with the flavors here. Mouthfeel is light with a very light to absent carbonation. I think the lack of body and carbonation really detracts from the brew. Overall impressions of this one are pretty low. I've had it on tap and in bottle before and it was never my favorite, but this one seems to be falling short of those expectations."
"Drinkability- This was a nice beer. A bit on the expensive side but probably worth it. Nice and refreshing."
"D- It is a tasty brew. I will probably buy some more of this but I wouldn't hold onto it for to long (cork says best by 2009 and I'm not sure how well it would hold up till then). A little on the expensive side but another solid offering from Bosteels."
"Comment: I first enjoyed this beer during a trip to Belgium with my son. Since then I have bought the unique glass set and tried the prestige as well as repeatedly sampled the strong pale ale. I have pleasant memories of this beer and find its history intriguing. The combination makes it a joy to experience, again and again."
"drinkability is great. this is a stronger brew (at 8% APV), which masks the booze very well, and the liquid itself is smooth and very well balanced, both in the nostrils and on the palate. it remains mild enough for most beer lovers to take a liking to it. cheers!"
"Drinkability: Seems like I'll be picking this one up again if I can find it again. This was a very oddball brew that really made me think about what I was tasting. It was an overall enjoyable experience however, and I think next time around I'll take it easy and let this one take over my tastebuds rather than trying to decipher what's in it."
"This is a nice one, though something raw about it makes this an especially slow sipper and too much after awhile. Still in all, a complex, tasty Belgian classic!"
"D: Kwak is a very drinkable beer if you ask me. It's got a good flavor and aftertaste, and the glass you drink it out of gets you plenty of ""what the hell is that?"" looks. Great conversation starter."
"Overall a very good Strong pale ale, I love this beer."
"D: A bit too sweet to drink a bunch of them, but it goes down ok and hides the alcohol pretty well."
"I got this at Delirium Café for a single reasonthe glass it is served in is really cool. It is like a small yard glass with a bulbous part at the bottom and a bell mouth at the top connected by a long shaft but attached to a crazy wooden handle that you use to place it on the table and grab it for drinking. It had a light amber body with a thick foamy white head. The aroma was sweet and malty with a bunch of fruity yeasty esters. The flavor is equally sweet and malty, but with a flatness only broken by a bit of wheatiness at the back of the palate. It has a light to medium body and pretty good drinkability, but the glass is cooler than the beer."
"Overall - This isn't really worth the amount it costs here in Australia. I believe most pale ales are better than this. This is quite a good beer, but it is very poor value."
"I don't think I'll be buying this again but I definitely enjoyed it."
"The more I drank of this, the more I liked it. It has a nice warming feel to it, and becomes easier to drink the more you have of it. Unfortunately, it is also quite expensive, so that rules it out as a regular purchase. A decent Belgian pale ale, but more hops and less sugar would be an improvement."
"reasonably drinkable in smaller doses, too sweet for my preference, although thankfully the aftertaste is really nice."
"Very dessert-y, it amazingly never becomes overly sweet. At just the right temperature, there's hardly anything finer."
"d: a very nice belgian which i plan to enjoy plenty in the future"
"Cheers!"
"Drinks a little slow, I remember this having more hops profile in the past. Worth a try, but not if over say, 8$ for a 750 ml bottle IMO. BBD of 17/05/2008, not sure aging will help this much"
"Overall: Not the best Belgian strong pale Ive had by a long shot. The precipitate blows my mind but my experience with the brew seems to be in the same vein as other reviewers. Still, Id give this one another try just in case. Another person compared this to a Chimay (blue) and thats a reasonable match. To me, this is a commercialized Belgian that is worth a try, but not worth pursuing."
"Great look, killer aroma...so-so taste..."
"33cl bottle: This one pours a clear, amber color. There was a bit of an off-white head on it, and it lingers awhile. There is a constant fizzing coming from the bottom of the glass. The aroma isnt overly strong, yet it is very pleasant. I get some caramel, spices, fruits and a touch of breadiness. The taste is some caramel , toffee, fruits, some of the yeastiness, and a touch spicy. The flavors dont stand out, but blend nicely for a fine brew."
"Drinkability:Awesomely smooth This is a World Class Beer."
"Tried this one a long time ago. Didn't like it. At all. Wich kept me from trying it again, which - I realize now - is a pity. Really a drinkable beer, although it might be a good idea to keep count of the number of glasses, since those 8% ABV could sneak up on you and give you a rather unpleasant headache just a you finish that last glass."
"D: Flavours are subtle, nothing is overpowering, great drinker for its strength."
"Top 8th"
"or aperitif situation"
"The beer looks great; it is a sparkling amber color with a very fine billowy head. Aroma was alcohol phenols with some faint sweet caramel notes. Flavor was somewhat grapey and fruity with lots of alcohol phenols. Mouthfeel was fine and very smooth. I didn't find this beer to be very drinkable."
"Smooth mouthfeel, medium full body. Lots of alcohol present, but not bad drinkability anyway. This is an okay beer, plenty of better Belgians for the money."
"As for drinkability? No thanks. It was a struggle to get through this 75cl bottle."
"Nice overall, and a good value at only $7.29. This is another questionable categorization. It's to light and not yeasty enough to be a good tripel. On the other hand, it's too sweet and not hoppy enough to be a good belgian strong pale ale. But at the end, regardless of what you want to call it, I call it tasty. Definitely worth a try, and could make for a good ""conversion"" beer for the uninitiated."
"Pours a medium amber with a frothy white head that quickly disappears. Little lacing. The aroma is quite light and all typical Belgian yeast smells of clove, banana, and light fruit. The taste is slightly winey and sweet with a pronounced banana finish. Fairly one dimensional and a little too sweet. Mouthfeelis solid with just the right heft and crispness to support the beer. Not the most intriguing Belgian strong pale, but not bad."
"That being said, you do need to try this beer. It is pleasing to the palette and very drinkable. It will help you decide what you do and don't like about the genre since it doesn't have too much going on."
"I uncorked this monster 75cl bottle with a glimmer in my eye. This oured dark copper with an airy and big (but airy) head. Brown sugar and sweet alcohol are the primary characteristics of the aroma. The flavor, on the other hand, is heavily titled to the caramel ... very sweet, almost candied. (#2766, 3/31/2007)"
"Poured into a Pint glass, pours an amazing orange amber haze with a seriouls head that leaves some thick sticky lace on the glass, simply impressive to look at. Smell has some nice fruit notes banana and cloves come to mind, this reminds me of a hefe, only the smell that is. Taste is not the greatest thing going for this beer, its a bit mild with a bit of fruit taste again I can taste the banana flavor with hints of mild pepper after finish, I cannot detect any hops in this batch and it has a bit of a alchol burn. Not a bad offering but not the best."
"Personally I don't find this to be very drinkable. An interesting experience, but not one I would seek out to repeat."
"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a medium density, rocky tan head fed by a zillion little champagne bubbles up the side of the glass. The smell is caramel & roasted malt with something cherry-like in the background. The taste is caramel but has almost a burnt note in it somewhere. The finish is dry, offsetting the initial sweetness. The mouthfeel is gorgeous, silky and oily. The drinkability is very good, certainly helped by the mouthfeel. Not too much alcohol in the forefront on this one, given its strength. Definitely one you could sip (note ""sip"") all evening. The beer, overall, makes me think of sitting in an exposed timber and plaster pub somewhere, drinking at a long wooden table as old as, well, beer, meeting new friends and listening to the world go by outside. For whatever that literary detour is worth."
"I waited 2 monthes for my Kwak glass to arrive, I finally get to enjoy it, thanks Viggo! Pours a clear amber burnt orange with a creamy off-white head that laces very well. Smell was a earthy citrusy hop and malty grassy crystal malt and a bit of alcohol. Taste was very unique and unexpected, almost like an American Barleywine. Sweet syrupy front with solvent alcohol, but not over-powering or unpleasant. tropical fruits creep in, and the finish is dry with some maltiness sticking around. Mouthfeel was thin but warming, and this is a very pleasant and unique Belgian."
"Overall: This is a very good beer, well worthy of its reputation, which I certainly enjoy drinking. However, poured from tap into a stirrup glass at a bar that knows how to handle Belgian ales properly it is at its best; the bottled version seems slightly harsher and less refined."
"Notes: I went back and forth on this brew. There is a lack of depth in this beer but it turns out decent."
"Was a reddish-purple with only soap sud-resembling head. The smell was alcohol and grapes, like a weak wine. The taste was of grapes and volatile alcohol... very similar to a wine.... carbonatioin was on the lower end. Not really to my tastes, and if it is really a belgian pale ale, it IMO doesn't measure up anywhere close to a say, Duvel."
"It really is a great brew, and in my opinion should be rated higher than what it has been."
"When I got down to the yeasty goodness, I was really interestingly pleased with the flavor. Good big ass beer to drink while watching Kevin Smith Strikes Back!"
"Pours a clear rusty red/orange with a giant white foamy head. The head doesn't last too long and there is little lacing. The smell is not very pungent,but a real ""bisquity"" aroma is prevelant along with a mix of spices and alcohol. The taste is a mix of alcohol, lemon, candy sugar, coriander, cherries and other fruits. A good tasting beer with some minor flaws. The m/f is light with flavors mixing well. For a high alcohol beer,this is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Alcohol presence is noticeable thoughout the whole drink. Almost a sweetness working its way out as beer warms. Sorry for the mess of a review this was from sparse notes about six months ago at Delaney's in New Haven. Beer is served in it's own miniscule yard glass with holder. Very elegant and recommened trying at least once on tap!"
"Alcahol is just to dominate and flaunting."
"Upon further inspection of the BA classification of this ale it is yet another example of a Belgian Ale defying style categories--- or the need for a Belgian amber ale category. Pale this ale aint. But it shouldnt have to be."
"This is better than average, its not super, but its really servicable."
"750ml bottle into an (improper) stout glass. Aroma of toasted bread and roasting chestnuts with a strong coppery head. Docked points on appearance due to the large (20 or more per glass) of floaties in the glass, even after a very careful pour. But the flavor and mouthfeel are so much more than the standard belgian golden ales that I don't even care. Strong roast nuts, toasted almonds, caramel and hints of apricot and cherry pull together to give a beer that is a little different with each sip as the palate becomes accustomed."
"Poured with a chestnut color and two fingers of foam. It sounds strange but I thought it smelled of milk and sweet fruits. The taste was sweet and yeasty with notes of apricots and peaches, and some smoke. The liquid almost had a syrup feel to it. This beer rates pretty high in BA but I was not so impressed."
"D: If they were to dial back the abv 1-1.5% this would be so much more enjoyable. It's quite drinkable as it is now, but, could be even better. I've had much better and I've had a lot worse."
"Smooth mouth feel yet a hearty brew, taste of fruit, spices, and figs. Quite warming alcohol sensation. Not as flavorful as some of the other Belgium strong pale ales, but a good experience. Drink it out out the mini yard glass with holder."
"It's got a name, but the rep falls short. I mean, it's not a drain-pour, but it's just too thin and shallow to stand up to the rest of Belgium's best. The ABV is big enough to render its drinkability somewhat questionable. So the name on the bottle is why I bought it, but what's in the bottle is why I won't buy it again."
"Pauwel Kwak pours a reddish orange color with a white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet malt, alcohol is also noticeable. Taste is pleasant, heavily on the malty side, quite sweet with alcohol being noticeable. An enjoyable quaff."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. First pour out of the bottle was a clear amber color, though I am sure it will cloud up by the time I get to the end of the bottle. Nice large off-white head, however it left no lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel, almost buttery, a bit of dark fruit. Taste is caramel malt, the malt stays through to the end, buttery, too buttery for my liking. Creamy, nice carbonation. I was a bit disappointed in this ale, had a nice complexity but too buttery."
"D - Absolutely delicious and easy to drink."
"D: Almost an 'everyday' drinker, definitely an enjoyable and very easy to drink strong pale. Pleasant flavors, sweet and caramel-laden with good balance, though it leans toward the sugary malts; this is one I could have many times. Also a favorite for my wife."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink."
"I have to say this is a disappointment. I had high hopes for this one, after considering the uber-cool travel glass Kwak pimps! (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauwel_Kwak) Kwak is uncomplex for the style, I should think, and is altogether too yeasty and stale tasting. Possibly I got a bad bottle, but Im hesitant to pay another $4 to find out"
"330 ml. bottle  color of amber , clear  nice white head , lingering - nose of jasmine , sweet fruitiness , caramel , cherries , sulfur, and alcohol  taste of sweet fruit , floral , caramel , malts , tar , red cherries , and raisins  low carbonation , slightly tart aftertaste caramel , malts , cereal , slight alcohol"
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I, more then ever, want to try this fresh as I just dont believe Kwak is supposed to be like this. Maybe this beer is past optimal but I like it and thus the review. This is a beer Id never age but it is kind of cool to taste an old bottle. I purchased my 330ml in Des Moines, IA. Im happy Ill be able to buy this in Omaha soon."
"Mostly an estery malty flavour. Some honeycomb & toffee. Starts sweet & perfumy, but finishes fairly dryly. There is a light bitterness, and some alcohol heat. Aftertaste of green apple & lychee."
"It might be alright for someone who wants an easy drinking beer and who doesn't care about flavor or character."
"Had a very full Mouthfeel and a well-controlled amount of carbonation. Finished originally sweet, but eventually dried out the tongue. Quite drinkable and interesting."
"Actually, it's pretty light and refreshing for an 8% beer. Goes down very smooth and easy."
"Something about this beer doesn't make me want to revisit it often. I can't say I dislike it, but I also can't say it is one of my favourites."
"ON ANOTHER NOTE: I just reviewed my 200th beer today. I had been planning to pick a really good beer to celebrate my 200th review, and also my 1 year anniversary on BA. However, I wasn't paying attention and my 200th review ended up being... Rolling Rock, of all things! I got a good laugh out of that. Lowest ranked beer I've ever reviewed, and I accidentally do it for my 200th. Oh well. #300, here I come!"
"drinkability on this one isn't great. i expected more of this and was somewhat disappointed with it. might have to try this one again sometime as my experience seems to be worse than most other reviewers report."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and simple. Somewhat creamy and very drinkable."
"D - Not bad at all. Well balanced but light-ish in flavour. Not nearly as boozy as I expected."
"i really enjoyed this brew."
"Pours a nice deep butter scotch amber, not too effervescence, decent enough head that dissipates at a medium pace. The sent is not dissimilar to that of porter or even a Belgium strong dark ale. The alcohol sent is at minimum. There are more earthy scents than fruity, the toasted malt is present, but not over powering. The first taste is rich, but not thick, with notes of dark chocolate, coffee, raisins and a tiny hint of licorice. These are present, but not over powering in the least, they are more a subtle coloration of the flavor than driving characteristics. Over all I would say this is an decently well balanced beer, not too exciting, but drinkable and of course as most strong ales their strength will sneak up on you."
"Bottle, served in the Kwak glass. Pours a nice but not very creamy head, that doesn't last much, Aroma: raisins, tropical fruits, spices, caramel. Very sweet flavor, maybe too much because it masks the depth of the beer. Mouth, licorice, tropical fruits, some hot spice that I can't indentify, caramel."
"Being new to Belgium ales, i am no connoisseur, however, this beer did not leave me wanting a second. The flavours were all there, although not well defined, texture is so-so, and the alcohol sensation was a bit extreme for this beer."
"Served in the traditional Kwak glass. Color is a reddish-amber, with a big white head that leaves a persistent lace. Sweet, malty aroma. Taste is outstanding; acomplex blend of peppery and sweet, candy sugar flavor, with a faint hoppy aftertaste. Incredibly drinkable; with the alcohol well masked. This has become one of my new favorites, rivaling La Fin du Monde."
"Overall, this is drinkable but not too exciting. Suprisingly placid considering the ABV. Maybe a decent ""beginner"" Belgian beer but not something I will be seeking."
"Not my favorite Belgian Pale, but a very solid offering. Easy and tasty to drink."
"Pours a hazy copper orange, some red, lots of chunks, off white head forms, settles down after a while, some lace sticking to the glass. Smell is sweet, apples/pears, caramel, some yeast. Taste is reallly nice, toffee is insane, citrus, orange peel and spice through the middle, more caramel and chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Nice and smooth, this definately is nice after aging."
"D: It's okay. That's all. I would have another if you are buying."
"I'm surprised I haven't had this before. Some Belgians turn me off. This one, while not hugely complex by any means, is a supremely drinkable and pleasant brew. This will be a go-to-beer for me from now on. I love this stuff."
"Drinkability is not bad for the style."
"Like no other Belgian Strong Ale."
"Kwak Kwak. Pours a nice crimson color, with a literal blizzard of sediment swirling from top to bottom. My only complaint with its appearance is its head retention which, looks uneven and practically non-existent. Smell was an improvement with overly ripe dark fruit, strong alcoohol, candy sugar and maple syrup.In the taste department was honey, strawberry, more syrup. Not too hoppy in the end, almost seems to be a bit one dimensional with the thickness dominating. One or two would not be a problem. This beer is interesting, but also seems a bit over-done and strong for the sake of being strong. Still worth a try"
"Opinion: This is a pretty tasty beer. It is clean and has a good flavor profile the entire time. I can't really speak of anything that this beer lacks or anything that it excels in. It is a pretty neutral Belgian Ale and would probably be a good one for someone to try that was new to the Belgian beer scene. It is a good beer, but I will likely stick to the more exotic styles."
"Once I tasted the above flavors, there were no other tastes to be explored. Not bad, but for sure a bit bland."
"Mouthfeel is syruppy, and gets old quick. The label indicates otherwise, but it's hard to believe there's not some sugar in here. Drinkability suffers from being overly sweet. Unfortunately, the appearance was the best part of this one, and I think it may have set my expectations too high."
"D: Somewhat lacking in smoothness and the ABV isnt well covered limiting drinkability. Also lacking in complexity."
"M&D: softly-carbonated and medium-bodied for its high alc. content, this beer is quite robust yet unbelie...vably easy to drink. Compared with my previous note of the same beer on tap, it seems the bottled version is indeed sweeter, but in an ideal glassware--a bulb wine glass, rather than the stupid (sorry!) ""chemical experiment"" like glass-tube--the beer is truly nice and more pleasant."
"Very drinkable brew. Finished it entirely too quicky."
"I dont plan to buy this beer again. It wasnt good for enjoying and I would never want to session it. Quite average."
"Picked up a 330ml bottle in February at AJ's on Central for $3.79. Beer poured a dark amber with a very nice long lasting head. Nose was a hint of fruit, perhaps apple. Taste is a wonderful medley of the fruit, Belgian yeast, with a nice moderate hop finish. Mouthfeel was very good as there is creamy-smooth feeling left after each sip. Drinkability is good. Initial sip presented an alcohol warming but that quickly went away. Very nice beer that is worth a try."
"Per BB: 8% ABV."
"Drinkabilty - higher abv and will try this one again."
"Not very drinkable...even in a small dose ( 10 oz.pour) this is just too sweet and one dimensional."
"Overall, not the most complex belgian ale around; but the glass was cool, the beer was refreshing, and I enjoyed my experience drinking Kwak."
"Pauwel Kwak is a good beer, but not a great one, at least in the bottle. It's ncie and smooth, though, and perhaps could be thought of as the Belgian equivalent of an English session beer."
"Overall this is solid, but nothing special. There are more interesting beers to choose from, but I'm a sucker for the malt profile exhibited here."
"11.2 ouncer without freshness indication. Pours a nice rich and glowing mahogony auburn. Clear, with a short lived off white head and leaving delicate and fine, splotchy lacing. Nose I get is nutty, alcohol and a bit of barnyard funkyness. Notes of more nuts, alcohol, steady stream of maltyness and quite dry late. So so Belgian, this one doesnt do much for me, there are alot of more interesting Belgians out there."
"Suspended globs upon pouring. Red brick in color, large and lasting foam. Stale, musty yeast in the nose, with hints of barnyard, caramel, spice and red fruits. Flavor is dry and funky, sprucey and thin, with stale malts and boozy fruits, Really sweet and thin. I surely prefer the Tripel."
"Try this stuff, it's definitely one that should be on any beer-questor's list."
"The flavor was really good and it would have been easy to drink another if I didn't have Kulminator to go to for beers that are harder to find. The glass was a novelty, but I prefer regular glassware. I could easily make a mess if I drink this without paying attention to the base."
"D: Decent Belgian offering, but not all that unique or complex. The alcohol could have been less noticible if there were better/stronger flavors to begin with..."
"Pauwel Kwak isn't as good as Tripel Karmeliet... but then what is? As noted above, it's a solid version of the style that would probably taste better if imbibed from the traditional Kwak glass in the land of its birth. Drunk from a nonic pint glass in the American Midwest, it's still a damn fine ale."
"The taste is slightly watery, but fruitful with a flowery boquet. It has a spiciness to it, it's met with a sweet candy flavor."
"Radiant copper color with an excellant head which left a pleasant lacing. I picked up aromas of strawberry, plum, bready yeastiness, and other various fruits. Fruity flavors, hints of clove and spices, banana, and perhaps a tiny bit of floralness of hops, but just a twinge. I really enjoyed the taste, it was simply a pleasure to drink. Medium bodied with little carbonation in the mouthfeel, pretty smooth going down. Almost seemed sessionable, however, at 8% you wouldn't last long."
"I noted a superb head and nice brown hue. Then I noted a semblance of sea monkeys. I don't mind sediment. I like it, and prefer my beers unfiltered. But folks, this drank like the pulpiest glass of OJ, and I was easy on the pour. I felt chunks of stuff between my lips, on my teeth, and all over. I enjoyed parts of this, and there were some redeeming moments. But the mouthfeel...I hope that wasn't duckshit."
"Served in a crazy special Kwak glass that required its own wooden stand because the glass had a huge bulb on the bottom. I felt it interfered with the overall drinking because the smell was totally constricted after the first third was done. Pours light cloudy amber with a thick short foamy head. Nose has some nice malts, a good blend of fruitiness, and the alcohol is peeking through. Smells like an 8 at least, many have masked it better though. Taste follows with similar attributes. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. Balance is rather good. Sweet, malty, fruity, slightly syrupy, but refreshing. Smoothness is quite good. Overall, a good (but not great imho) brew."
"Wonderful beer, wish I had a case of it. Very ""belgian"". Any belgian lover should love this. Excellent."
"D - Though I drank it 5 months before the expiration date, this was a flabby pathetic beer. Nothing like the tastey brew I have known this to be."
"Drinkability: This has always been an easy beer to drink for me. A very sweet to drink treat. The beer hides its alcohol content well."
"This beer is muddied by a storm of flocs in its otherwise clear golden body. I noted a soft carpet of cream colored suds and a penetrating sour aroma defined by yeasts and/or other friendly microorganisms. The aroma eventually grew zesty like lemon rinds, warm bread, and exotic spice. Given the chance to mellow for a bit, the peppery taste becomes approachable but Im still not keen on drinking something that gives me a headache. Still, its pretty cool to name a beer after the sound that a duck makes."
"Taste -- Citric acidity, smooth malts, cider, strong alcohol in the aftertaste. This beer gains a consistency like cider when it warms and for all practical purposes drinks like a session beer. Overall a good Belgian Pale, not outstanding, but certainly quaffable."
"Very nicely done. A myriad of flavors in the taste and aroma make for a delightfully complex Belgian Pale Ale. I will be looking for this one again, soon."
"What first alarmed me was that this 330 ml bottle was not bottle conditioned. I had a large corked bottle of this earlier this year, and it was conditioned, so I was a bit disappointed from the get go. Poured into a chalice, this was burnt red, orange and gold from the middle to the outside with only a little head. Smells of mandarin oranges, pine and red liquorish. Tastes of wheat and oats with a molasses sweetness. The flavor transitions nicely into a dry finish with a nice warming. Mouth feel is light bodied with little carbonation."
"Ain't life grand?"
"Not a bad Belgian strong pale, seems a bit reserved though."
"Tasted great, sweet malt, caramel, crystal malt, spices and a huge malty sweetness. Yeasty charachteristics, bitterness and evident alcohol. Finishes dry and sweet, with lingering yeast flavours."
"Drinkability: I see this beer has its proponents and detractors but I have sided with those who enjoy it's light but sophisticated array of flavors"
"Not highly quaffabl, and won't be common drink, but not bad!"
"Without the funny glass I guess it's just an also-ran. Drinkable and pleasant, but not destination."
"Pours a medium orange amber with a huge head, good longevity and very good lace. Initial aroma of a caramel raisin like malt followed by a very nice hop floralness. Taste of a nicely roasted caramel malt with some raisin, and plum flavors. A nicely balanced hop spicyness follows but leaves no real bitterness on the tounge. Somewhat tart even and a bit creamy. alcohol is present but it is very drinkable for an 8%. A very good beer."
"Good mouth that is full and has enough carbonation to give it depth. Solid drinkability for the abv. I could see this pairing well with venison or wild duck."
"Man, what a great beer: the aroma is rich and complex, the mouthfeel is smooth, and the flavor is all of the above. Still one of the best Ive had and Ill probably continue to enjoy it for years to come. Highly recommended."
"A caramel malt flavor, rich in hops, roasted malt; i try this beer a couple of years ago; is one of the my favorite beers, i try onli like appetizer, but can be combined with cheese, german cuisine and mexican haute cuisine; in general this beer it surpasses my expectations, 95% recommended."
"D = Expensive and average means that its drinkability takes a battering."
"Pours a bit dark for a strong pale, fruity nose. smooth mouthfeel. Malty sweet and spicy flavor with some hop presence for balance. Very drinkable for 8.5%, dangerously so. Hope to get this in NC now that we can buy beers like this. this beer reminds me of quadrupels I've had, but not so over the top. I like this beer a lot. although Duvel and Fin du Monde are more indicative of the style I might pick this, given the choice."
"Notes: DEspite its shortcomings compared to my favorite Belgian Strong pales I'm glad I tried it. The appearence is especially pleasing as well as the smell. A good buy and a good beer but not up there with the Chimay/ duvel/ Fin Du Mondes in its style."
"Overall: I really like this beer. The smoothness balances out nicely with the strong alcohol tones. I've had it twice, both times in the kwak glass, so I'm not sure how good it would do in another vessel. If you've never had a strong Belgian beer before this would be a good one to start with."
"Beer is good. Happy beering. 138/3.77"
"A good brew but I thought it was missing something. All the flavors and aroma were on the launching pad but never really seemed to develop."
"D- This is a very nice beer but it doesn't have all the complexity that others do in this style."
"Decent all around, not exciting by any means, but pleasing. Maybe it's just a bit too early in the day for this, but I'm enjoying it nonetheless."
"Overall - an excellent and original brew. Not much else tastes like this... I've drunk this from a proper Kwak glass and from and ordinary glass - the Kwak glass seems to emphasise the flavours and smells quite noticeably..."
"Delicious, Served in a black 25 oz bottle. This belgian brew pours a dark amber, the head is a thin lace of tan that sticks to the glass. The smell is orange peels, vanilla, and honey. As I let this beer warm up a little from the fridge more flavors and aromas began to come out. The taste of this beer is smoothe and creamy. It tastes of honey, fruit (banana and grapes), it is sweet but not overwhelming. I definatly recommend this beer. It would pair well with a grilled steak to contrast some of the fruity flavors, as well as a bananas foster to help bring out some of the banana and caramel flavors in the beer."
"Bottle (330ml). I don't know why, but it has taken 3 goes for me to finally review this one. For some reason I could not bring myself to comment after the first two. This is no doubt a very competent brew. Beautiful hazy (I poured the yeast in) deep reddish gold with a few protein floaties marring the overall effect this time (I think I left it too long in a very cold fridge, the other two had no floaties), nice dense white head with plenty of lacing. Toasty, yeasty, subtly funky aroma, but with a slight latex finish which marked it down a little. Quick sweet caramel and honey malty start with a sudden but lingering dry middle and a warm alcohol finish with subtle but pleasant and balancing bitterness. Reasonably uncomplicated and well balanced overall. Very nice fine and full palate, accentuating the overall experience of the beer. Easy beer to like."
"sampled as 750ml bottle. Poured a cloudy amber color with much chunky flocculate. Smell was typical of a begian ale. Taste was average. Mouth feel was fairly bad with the multiple chunks floating around. Not very drinkable. Perhaps I tried a bottle that had exceeded its drinkability point."
"Dark yellow appearance, lace in glass. Yeast with spice aroma, sour dry, with sugar texture. Some spice and orange and lemon fruit, medium mouthfeel. Alcohol disguised by the sweetness from carmel and honey and sugar. Doesn't all work out. On tap at Eulogy. Had a bottle 1.5 years later, same rating."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a chalice."
"Drinkability: Another genre-crusher. Not what I would expect from a pale, not a dark -- a twilight strong perhaps? Never had one like it, but it's very good. Too pricey to drink on a regular basis, but I would if I could."
"finally brought this one out of the cellar after a 11/2 years from the 750 corked bottle, poured a hazy copper with a light tan head. aroma. sweet fruits ,honey, malts, caramel some bread a nice mild yeast , and a hint of raisins, had a hard time taking my nose away from this one. flavor apples, orange, honey, citrus, caramels."
"D - Good, but would be better if the taste was more rounded and the alcohol bite more suppressed."
"You do not taste the alcohol as much as you smelled it. This is Malty, sweet at first, with a sour aftertaste that is not unpleasant, but does not add to it. It feels good in the mouth, bubbly but not overdone. The malt does not coat. This is a little strong to drink all day, but good enough to have a couple."
"amber orange in colr with tiny bubbles constantly rising to the surface and infultrating the constant khaki head. the head fluffs up when pours but never completly disaptes. smells of alcohol, grass, tobaccos, and amtly sweatness. burns a bit on the back of the throat, not in a abd way, jsut noticable, very grassy with herbal hop profile. somewhat smokey, and that great odd sweat flavor that comes with a good beligian that i jsut cant place. Odd thick chunky bits, i would assume it is yeast but it is omnipresent from begining to end. a bit hard to deal with and very creapy at first. i got used to it though. but it does loose mouthfeel points for it. good, not great, not anything out fo this world new, or style changing, but solid, and sturdy."
"D&N: Very nice offering here, the only drawback is the price. Good beer to try."
"A bit more difficult to drink than other examples of the style, but worth sampling occasionally."
"Pours a dark, dark gold color. Presented at a Czech bar in a flute glass with a large bulb at the end. There is a medium head that dissipates pretty slowly. It has a malty flavor and aroma and there is a taste of raisins and brandy in the aftertaste. You can taste that sugar has been added to make it very sweet and this counteracts the taste of the alcohol. The carbonation in the middle of the sip tastes a lot like 7up."
"Still not the most complex or creative of beers but still pretty unique in its own way."
"I do really like this beer."
"This isnt bad, its just not particularly good when compared with all the other belgian pale ales and tripels out there. Paired this with a sharp red leicester and wensleydale"
"Rich, filling and a real belly warmer. Now if those chunks would disappear..."
"Drinkability- This beer would have gotten a pretty high mark if it weren't for the dreaded scabs. Very pleasant tasting brew. It looks like I may just have gotten a bad bottle. I'm pretty sure I had Kwak in the special glass last year at the Toronado, but I didn't have this experience."
"Thanks to Mark at 3 Corners for the sample."
"I will not get this again."
"Overall, this beer didn't strike me as anything like what it's listed as. Kwak was too one-dimensional. Almost seemed more like a doppelbock. Maybe an old bottle? I can't tell. However, I was seriously unimpressed and won't be picking up another one for a long time, if ever."
"Corked and Caged 750 Ml bottle. Pours a clear brown color, with bubbles roiling the body, making circular, vertical currents in the beer. Head is gigantic, a full 2"" in my Sam Smith Tulip. Taste is strong with alcohol, and earthy woody flavors, but I will have to agree with other reviewers saying that there isn't enough other flavor to ballnce this beer. Alcohol is too present, but this beer is still pleaant to drink. Mouthfeel is very odd, weird carbonation when taking a sip, maybe it builds up under the thick, creamy head and enters the mouth in bursts. Maybe there is yeast in the bottle, I can't really tell. FOr the same price you can get a 750 of La Fin du Monde, or Don de Dieu, both of which I would recommend over this stuff."
"Taste surprisingly has a lot of alcohol up front, followed quickly by the big fruity flavors, plum and berry and sour apple. Lightly nutty and plenty malty. Again, lightly sour. Medium bodied brew and lightly sticky finish. Lots going on here and something just didn't quite work for me. Not very drinkable IMO. the alcohol flavor was a bit offputting and it just seemed a bit haphazard. Maybe better in Belgium?"
"I wish I had the distinctive glass for kwak, but a chalice will have to do. I love the story behind the kwak glass: invented to allow coach drivers to drink while in the coach. A cider-red beer, some ruby and rosewood, almost rose with dark amber. Clear, topped with a creamy dull white head, at first a perfect size, but then receding to a thin layer. Lace that does not seem to go away, sticking tenaciously to the sides of the glass. An attractive beer, glassware notwithstanding. Curious, the very first time I had Kwak, I smelt salmon on the initial smell. I still do: there is a salty fish aroma up front, equally appetising as not, but very unique. I definitely get a great deal of salinity in this beer however, perhaps more than any other I have tried. Baking bread, vanilla, ham, bacon, and a general meat presence to the whole nose. There is some malt, well roasted, a whiff of yeasty musk, and little or no hop. Spicy, like seasoning salt, along with some metallic iron notes. Tasting, again I get the fish, finishing with a nice red-malt sweetness, bready and medium-dry. The middle gives perfume, the alcohol, butter, tomato. Hops make their appearance in the finish, with a slighly oily grass taste, adding just enough dryness. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied; almost too creamy for the beer, as it turns to foam immediately in the mouth. At 8%, highly quaffable. Quite a unique tasting beer, even by Belgian standards."
"Pours with a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a ring and some lace. Cloudy, amber color. Medium bodied. Sweet raisin nose. Light carbonation. Starts and finishes with sweet overtones, not syrupy, but clean. Pricey at $4.34 for a 330ml bottle from Oliver's Beverage Albany, NY."
"This is a very drinkable brew but it is very strong, and the complicated stirrup/glass arrangement with the signature glassware can be a challenge."
"Besides from that, its a good beer."
"Got to try this at a X-mas party, out of a Chimay goblet. Much darker than I anticipated, looks more like a dubbel or brown ale, nice foamy white head. Very sweet malty aromas with fruit, and Belgian yeastiness. Whoa, very sweet, almost sugary malts, cherries, marshmellows, and subtle spice. Light bodied and effervescant. I wish this Chimay goblet had Chimay in it! Tastes almost like a Belgian barleywine due to the sweetness. Not aweful, but certainly not what I expected from a ""pale ale"". Flavors and alcohol not well intigrated enough to be very enjoyable."
"Pours a very clear golden-bronze with white head which quickly shrinks to a film and minimal lace. The nose is lightly hoppy, with some sweet and fruity tones on a solvent-like alcohol background. Very light body with moderate carbonation. Starts lightly hoppy, developing into creamy caramel and fruit, and finishes with somewhat raw alcohol warming. The body is thin and the alcohol far too clearly unmasked for my preference. Not a particularly subtle or outstanding strong Belgian ale in my opinion. Duvel and La Fin Du Monde are much more interesting examples."
"Damn myself for not having the proper glassware. A tulip will have to suffice. Poured a dirty copper color with small frothy lacing. Aroma contains notes of cinnamon and sugar. Taste is very sweet but highlighted with a little bit of cinnamon spice. Alcohol becomes more evident as the beer warms. The sweetness also becomes less prevalent as it warms leading to more fruity notes. Very soft in the mouth due to the light carbonation. Super drinkable beer. I wouldn't mind having more than 1 in a night. I'd also like to try this straight from the tap to see what changes it presents in the mouthfeel deparment. A very solid beer overall."
"Pours a beautiful amber with a pillowy, tight head. Smell is wine-like with a grassy hop undertone. taste is tart, with wine-like essence...a little sour, bu refreshing. Mouthfeel is dry and light to medium in body. Mouthfeel and taste make this a very drinkable brew."
"The taste is sourish and very refreshing. The liberal taste of malt is slowly replaced by a lactose-sweetness and bitter hops. Then, a fine body and a mild taste of aromatic hops emerge. There is a touch of wheat beer in the aftertaste with the combination of candy-sweetness and fruity, spicy hops."
"Except for some large floaties, this beer pours a clear amber color with a full tan head. The aroma is redolent of caramelized malt, and alcohol in the finish. The beer is sweet and malty, with a creamy, pleasing mouthfeel. This is a fairly clean beer, malt is certainly the showcase here. This beer is fairly one-dimensional, but it is also pretty enjoyable."
"Kwak, you're dead to me."
"Not bad overall, but not a favorite. I found the ""herbalness"" and ""fruityness"" kinda traded on and off with each sip. I found the flavor a bit off balance."
"Overall: Tis a spicy malty brew for sure. Kwak is not, and has never been a favorite of mine, in fact apart from the funky wooden holder and glass arrangement it has never held an attraction. But I have to state that this sample was rather good, oh so much better from the 75cl than what I ever recall having from the smaller 12 ounce bottles, or even draft. Weird!"
"I may revisit this one in the future, but what I have here is completely unacceptable. Seems as though cokes has noticed the same thing in his bottle."
"This is a one-dimensional beer that is okay, but is not the first Belgian I'd grab."
"The first of the Belgians from my trip to Van. Best before date on the back label of the bottle: 02/09/05. Sort of disappointing right from the start, no head on the pour, and although the body is a decent amber, it's not so much cloudy or hazed, as much as it is simply innundated with suspended particles, like a minor protein haze, or even pulp. The aroma contains papaya, candi sugar, sweet malt and alcohol. There is a tropical fruit motif to the flavour, a sweet and sugary taste, along with a buttery blended rum finish to it, an alcohol kick on the aftertaste. Strawberries, I taste ripe strawberries on the aftertaste, like a daquiri. Very light on the mouthfeel, it's an easy beer to drink texture-wise, goes down smoothly, but I don't feel much impetus to finish this sample, let alone to buy more. I think I've seen enough halfway through the glass. Sweet and fruity, but no character or backbone to it at all."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a really nice creamy white head. Not much lacing though. No yeast seen, very clear in color. The smell has a butterscotch sweetness to it and some herbal notes but I also detect band-aid's in the aroma. The taste is very odd. It seems like there are many flavors wrestling with each other. Lots of yeast in the flavor even though there is no yeast in my glass. Very sweet at times with notes of ripe fruit and figs but then very spciy and tart/sour at other times. Alcohol is detectable in the burn and also in the finish the further I go, along with the alcohol sugars/esters. Finish is crisp and lingers but not as long as most Belgians. The body is quite thick and rich. This is definitely different than what I was expecting. Not better, not worse, just different."
"All told, this seems incomplete."
"Pours a moderate amber, slightly cloudy with lots of carbonation and a medium sized off-white head. Lots of yeast chunks (like a broken up yeast cake) coming out before half the bottle was poured. Continued floating arouond during the entire drink. So much yeast, it even was in the head. Aroma: pleasant (but not ""wow", malty, semi-sweet, gentle Belgian yeast aroma, slightly herbal, some fruit (figs, plums, dates) with slight sharpness from the hops. Flavor was similar to the aroma, but a bit spicier, and some cherry notes late in the glass come through. Nice effort, but too much yeast."
"On the nose it shows primarily roasted grains and only in the background are impressions of sour yeast and fruit. On the palate it is ably balanced between broad, malty cereal flavors and unobtrusive botanical bitterness. All of this occurs in a creamy medium of fine mousse only just offset by tangy fruit and grip on the finish. Because of it's clean, roasty profile this is a perfect Belgian beer for any BA lost in an Anglo paradigm and wanting to dip their toes into the exotic, continental waters of Beer Xanadu."
"This beer was something of a contradiction in terms. There was a great deal of complexity in the flavor profile, yet, it had all the grace of a rhino crashing through the jungle. Poured a hazy, coppery brown. Flavor was very oaky, as though it had been aged in an oak cask, with a heavy-handed tannin aspect. Alcohol flavor was distinct and not integrated. I had to work at enjoying this beer, and, in the end, decided it was not worth the effort."
"Oh and about the ducks comment, sorry for the wise Kwak! :P"
"Overall, this is worth trying....tasty...but not one of the greatest beers on earth....I certainly wouldn't turn one of these down but I don't think I'd pay the $$$ I paid for this one again..It is almost too easy drinking for what I consider a sipping style beer....lacks a little depth...still not bad though.."
"Pours a golden amber with little white head that's gone rather quickly. Smells of fruits and a slight alcohol nose. Tastes of not a whole lot, some fruity notes with slight carmel in the finish. Some warming with the alcohol and slight spices detected. Mouthfeel is light with little carbonation goes down smooth, but doesn't excite me all that much. Overall not that impressed with this one."
"Pours a hazy orange-amber colour with an enormous head. The head releases fruity aromas that include banana, tart apple, tropical fruits (ie starfruit?). The taste is similar in many ways. all the fruity taste with a really cool light cider/banana thing going on. This seems to be the thing with the belgain pale ales. I like it. I wish I had the Kwak glass, but that will soon be in the works."
"Had on tap at Redbones the night of the St. Patty's pubcrawl. Pour was a faded and dusty cloudy yellow. I thought the aroma was like jelly candy. Medium carbonation. The taste is slightly sweet, with a lot of yeastiness going on, but it's very good and very smooth. Even with that abv, it was easy to drink. Would get again."
"Pours a hazed tea color with very little head even with a vigorous pour. The smell is very nice revealing light fruit and a hint spices with a small trace of warming alcohol. The taste is a heavy malt, watery sweet fruit, and very faint spicing. The alcohol is fairly hidden in taste with the malt that starts out in the beginning. This is surprisingly a light bodied brew despite the rush of malt at the start of each taste and it finishes lightly sweet. Decent brew. Op uw gezonheid!"
"The mouthfeel smooth and this was medium bodied. Carbonation levels were good. Decent, but there are more drinkable Belgian ales out there."
"style but I found it very drinkable and would buy this again. It is also very food friendly especially with meat dishes."
"330ml Bottle. No freshness date. This Belgian poured a clear amber with a subtle head of foam that died quickly. Aroma is sweet and spicy with pepper and coriander. Body is very smooth and full yet lacks that crispness I prefer in this style. The flavor is sweet and spicy with the coriander showing up here as well. Overall a decent brew just nothing really exceptional."
"Drinkable enough that you want one when you're in the mood, but not a beer Im gonna settle in to for long. Too simple in a one-sided way, and in that respect, when compared to so many other Belgians, this beer is pretty weak."
"Overall drinkability...it took me a while to drink this because you don't want to swig big gulps of the tangy sour taste...but i could have had another couple if I planned on taking it easy and drinking slowly"
"Had this served in appropriate glassware at the Hopleaf. Pours a nice amber color with a nice big off-white head. Aroma is fruity malts, most predominant aroma I can come up with is green apple with some hop bitterings. Taste is super sweet, almost too sweet but settles down and is a very quaffable beer. By halfway through really enjoyed this beer and I'd like to try again."
"Rich amber coloured, not as much sediment as I would have expected. Average-sized white, slightly greyish head on pouring. Fruity, yeasty, complex, flavour-promising aroma. Good carbonation. There's a big, malty, quite rich flavour with some sweetness there; a heavy beer I like very much but not suited to a session; I would alternate with something with more agility and less weight. Not that clever on aftertaste though, but still a great brew; your perfect antidote to corporate industrial 'Light Ales'."
"75 cL bottle. Pours a pale, translucent copper color with a spotty off-white head. Nice nutty, diacetyl aroma of complex complete malt fermentation and vague fruitiness. Aroma just doesn't stop, especially like I drink a great lot of beers +/- ~55 degrees F; pulled out of collection and shared with a couple of pals, it's just perfect for a finisher. Sour notes come through as well as some notes like a Flemish red (slight vinegariness). Gotta mention the nutty aroma again; the malt is most impressive in this light colored malty treat. Totally sweet and dessertish, yet so beer-like, in a connoisseur's kind of way. Again, complete fermentation despite sweetness which accounts for the slightest dry finish. Impeccable. I love this, unlike any other substitute for a dubbel Belgian. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel, but all good, me and my toothbrush are ready for any sugariness (goddamn Cavity Creeps). It's totally unique but I've experienced this many times before, draught and the 33 cl bottle, not the 75 corked and caged version. I'm convinced this version's better than the draught version or the small bottle. Absolutely hit the spot."
"This beer poured a clear, reddish-amber color with white foam that settled to a thin coat. The smell was modest: sweet with traces of caramel malt, and a slight fruitiness (musty grapes). The taste was sweet up front with some vinous grape flavors and some tangy maltiness. There was a slightly musty flavor in the finish, and the flavors really lingered on the tongue. The mouthfeel was smooth with some sweetness but with a dry finish. The body was medium with good carbonation feel on the front of the tongue. The was a rather nice Belgian ale."
"The light amber brew arrived at the table with a low but persistent head which lasted until the end. The arom was fruity with a sweet candy aroma. Also present was caramel. The flavor was crisp and contained pepper and a slight bubblegum. The sweet candy flavor lasted into the dry finish. After sipping you are left with an acoholic warmth from the beer."
"The taste was quite dark for a pale ale. Almost more like a bock than a belgian beer. A malty, bread-like taste, with hints of raisins. A peppery, slightly bitter, lingering finish. Quite unexpected, and not what I was in the mood for."
"IMHO: A very drinkable beer with well-balanced characteristics. The character changes noticeably with warming, more complexity develops."
"Nevertheless, nice and has a great name as well (if aesthetics or unimportant details ought to be pointed out...)"
"Golden amber hue with a creamy, quarter-inch head. Laces nicely down the glass. Nose features variations of fruity, sweet and spicy. Notes of apricot and darker fruits, sweet malt, and spices such as coriander and pepper prevail in the aromatics department. A vast array of flavors reign, as well. This beer's sweetness sets it apart from others in its style. More dark fruit (especially dates), caramel, coriander, a minor alcoholic finish and a distinctive yeast flavor profile define Kwak. Mildly carbonated and especially smooth on draught, this beer can turn syrupy or oily as it warms. A nice sipper, but its sweetness and alcohol content keeps it from being overly drinkable. A fine Belgian in the bottle, I find the draft version to be even better."
"Brilliant orange gold color. Smallish head. Aroma is yeasty and spicy. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malty and spicy. Bright and yeasty. Spices (anise, coriander and clove) and fruit (peaches, apricot and bananas). Well balanced. Smooth tasting. Its a touch sweet, but there are some earthy and musty aspects to this beer as well. The 8% alcohol is somewhat evident in the slight oiliness to the flavor and a touch of bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet"
"Orange copper in appearance with a large white head. Very spicy aroma with a bit of malt sweetness. Taste is quite fruity with a lot of spices as well. I enjoyed this much more than what the other reviews have indicated. No, it's not the best that Belgium has to offer, but it's still a treat to try this."
"Drinkability  Sorry, but I wont buy this again. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but this went down painfully slow."
"A sweet, lightly fruity aroma with hints of mandarin orange, yeast, and sugar. The beer pours light amber in color, with a thin head. Taste is quite sweet, with a raw-sugar maltiness yielding to flavors of tropical fruit and a lightly spicy hop finish. Smooth mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable  seems to go down better the more of it you drink! I only wish itd been served in the special glass."
"Rich rosey amber color with a substantial head. Bubbles form uneavenly, and foam laces the glass. Smell is arousing, earthen and malty. Taste is equally malty, sweet, filling, and warm. Finish is clean, hints of white grape. Now I'm ready for dinner."
"One of my favorite styles of beer! A small tan creamy sized head with fine-medium sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was carbonated with a dense appearance.The hue was amber and the nose consisted of alcohol, sweet and fruity.There was not much lacing with this beer.The flavor was definitely that of alcohol and it was somewhat bitter tasting.The mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue, fairly smooth and medium bodied.This one was a bit difficult to get down due to the alcohol taste."
"The taste gave away to that sweet malty flavour with a hnit of spicy flavour. The alco level is definately apparent on this beer and gives the beer a real warming feeling as you drink it. I think it would be a good fall/winter beer. Hard to drink more than one of these beers when it's the middle of summer and 30 degrees (86 F) outside."
"After hearing about the uniqueness of Kwak, I decided to give it a try, and I enjoyed it. Although this seems like it was more of a wintery beer than a summer one, I still liked it nonetheless, and maybe I'll have another this holiday season."
"Lovely presentation in the hourglass shaped glassware held in a wooden stand. Comes out dark reddish gold under a firm tan head that leaves lovely lace. The nose is mild but distinctly hoppy, with flowery undertones. The mouth is lightly carbonated and well balanced. The initial taste has a touch of malt, but is dominated by the hops. This leads to a nice flowery hoppy finish and an excellent smooth bitter aftertaste. I liked it!"
"Pours a nice red/copper color with meium head that leaves some great lacing,the aroma is almost non existant with a slight powdered sugar smell.The tast is pretty complex malty sweet with a tast of candied sugar as the backbone alcihol is prevalent in the finish wich is nice and warming.A real nice malty beer,very impressed."
"I've always enjoyed Kwak, and while some speak of it being overrated, I would argue the opposite. A very tasty, malty ale. Creamier than most other Belgian ales. Pours a large, foamy head, with very sticky and prominent lacing. Brownish hue. Definitely balanced towards the malts, and quite sweet. Despite this, a very easy to drink and enjoyable ale (and the ABV is well hidden). Not up there with the absolute greats, but certainly on a par with Corsendonk, Chimay (red), Maudite, and several other excellent Belgian and Belgian-styled brown ales and dubbels."
"All in all, a good beer. However, for the style it is mediocre. I usually don't drink mediocre beers more than once but I can see another Kwak in my future. However, given the choice of Kwak versus any number of other Belgians, Kwak will probably lose out."
"Smooth rich dark brown with caramel, malty overtones.. Alcohol welll noted throughout this bottle with a malty blance that is rich and full bodied and not too sweet.. More like an abbey dubbel in alcohol and color, fruity, delicious and worth every penny. Highly drinkable but dangerous."
"Very little head when pourred into glass, almost no bubble coming from the bottom. the alcohol is way too evident and takes too much place leaving little for the spice taste to come throught. A little bit disapointed, I was hoping more from this belgian ale which is usually highly rated by beer drinkers..."
"Being a belgian beer i made sure to quit pouring it when i saw floating particles try and enter my glass. Poured with a very thin head which dissipated quickly. Color was a deep amber but not to the point of redness. Aroma was a sweetness punctuated by a few esters but not very much. Taste was very thin with sweetness and a slight hoppiness and again few esters. Carmelly yet dry due to esters but with a bitter hoppiness with a very clean finish. Overall i would rather try a different Belgian beer instead so i can find a brand more indicitave of the style."
"This Belgian ale poured a cloudy, brown with a poor head for style. I could best say that everything about this ale was okay. The aroma was malty and a little fruity. The taste was subdued but did contain caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel was light and bubbly. For the price, I would select another Belgian unless you are trying to introduce someone to a Belgian."
"Not bad, but there are better Belgian ales out there."
"Pours a dark amber color that almost shows a reddish hue from certain angles. Topped by a rather thin off white head that maintains a thin collar around the glass. Sweet roasted notes accented by noticeable alcohol in the aroma. Has the distinct 'belgian dubbel' sort of smell. The taste is interesting and sort of complex. Immediately a very earthy malt flavor comes through, then some woodiness. Theres a bit of chocolate in this one as well. Then the alcohol sweetness hits you. There's a touch of bittering on the finish, and perhaps even a slight astringency to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is rather light, but yet smooth. Carbonation is there, but barely noticeable as it meshes well with the mouthfeel. This is not what I expected, as something more like a Leffe Blonde was in my mind. I seem to remember being more surprised (and enamored) by the aroma and the sweetness of the Leffe, but I enjoyed this as well. Hopefully the rating reflects that. This is a decent beer, and it's even better that I picked up for a song at a wine shop in Ohio. If the alcohol were more subtle, I'd like it much more."
"Pours an amber colour topped by a creamy head. This beer looks beautifull... especially the glass adds to the appearance. Aroma consists of sweet malts & fruits. Taste is VERY SWEET. Pauwel Kwak has a sweetness like no other beer i've ever tasted. If you don't like sweet beers then don't even bother trying this one. On the other hand, if you are into sweet beers then you wouldn't mind drinking Kwak all day long. Just have in mind the ABV. Don't let the sweetness of this beer fool you. It's a very strong beer. An excellent beer in my humble opinion. MY FAVOURITE."
"Sweet/floral/fruit smell upon first wiff. Very carbonated pink look with a slight white lace. No real lasting head to speak of. Sweet yeasty taste with some dry fruit (green grapes) on the back of the tongue. There is also a touch of hop bitterness. Upfront the taste is sweet but that weakens as you swallow. Nice soft mouth. A little too sweet and light tasting on the back end. This weak lilt hurt its drinkability for me..."
"The smell is faint. It's sweet, nutty, creamy. The front is spicy and sweet. The middle is malty, a little fruity with some toffee creeping in for a deep toffee finish. Alcohol is a little obvious on the finish. What an interesting beer. It's very malty... almost a British Belgian. I like it!"
"750ml bottle. Pours a rusty amber color with a creamy off-white colored head that leaves heavy sheets of lace on the sides of the glass as you drink. Nose is very faint to start but starts to come out as the beer warms a bit with aromas of sweet malt, fruity yeasts, and raw sugar. Medium to full in body and smooth and slightly sticky in texture. Taste is dominated by an overall sweetness with notes of candied sugar and tropical fruits up front followed by rum-soaked sweetened raisins and a bit of ice wine. An enjoyable beer but seems somewhat out of balance. Still, Id gladly drink this again as it does serve as a fine nightcap."
"Not poured in the official glassware however, this beer is still a must try for any Belgium beer lover like myself anyway you can get it. This beer appears a slighlty ruby with a hint of brown amber shade to it and pours with a massive off white cream colored head. The aroma is a deep buttery malty treat that spreads joy throughout the world, and puts an instant smile on my face. The taste has a deep warming effect going on through out my palate and through my chest as I take each sip of this nectar of the gods. With hints of candied sugar that it was primed with those deep butter flavors are complemented with a smooth nutty malt flavor. The last trickle of flavor provides just a hint of some fruit tones that are amazing to me. Mouthfeel is sticky and the carbonation tickles and soothes the back of the throat at the same time. Drinkability in one word Incredible."
"-F"
"This beer pours a dark copper color with minimal head and minimal lacing. The aroma contains strong scents of fruits, like most Belgian ales with a slight undertone of alcohol. The taste is very sweet and the fruity taste is very apparent, but it is oddly somewhat sour. Not too sour, but just enough to be different. They do a good job of masking the alcohol in the taste. The mouthfeel is very pleasing as the fruits and sweetness is very clear. Drinkability is not so good on this one because it is so sweet and sour that I can't see myself enjoying more than one. Overall, a very good Belgian beer that I enjoyed profusely."
"One of the most unique beers Ive tried, even by Belgian standards. This is definitely my favorite beer from a country that I believe produces too many beers with an overwhelmingly similar flavor profile. Cheers to Bosteels for doing something different."
"11.2oz bottle - Color is of golden dark honey and the head is super tall, mega froth from the pour, 11.2 seemed more like 16, the head is frothy foam of off-white color but deeper in color at the bottm of a two finger high head. Head is smooth like whipped cream with some large divets. Smell is mostly malt like caramel and toffee with a light alcohol warmth hint and citrus fruits.Taste is smooth and yummy, amazingly sweet and malty with some toffee and rum-like capabilties in warmth, slight spicy citrus. Feel is all sweet and smooth with incredible silkyness and a warming from the alcohol thats like a brandy or rum. Surprising kick for 8%, pleasantly smooth character."
"Note: I've tried both the 33cl bottle and the 75cl. The 33cl is not bottle-conditioned, so it tastes a bit tamer and the carbonation is quite vapid. The 75 can be a real treat, though!"
"This beer is pretty clear. It has a glowing presence about it. And is very orange in color. Maybe some scarlet hues in the mix as well. Aroma is sweet (like candy), musty, a little fruity (pears) and woody. The subtelty of this beer knocks me on my ass (if that makes sense). It always poses somewhat of a problem for me as picking out the flavors and complexities in a subtle beer is always more difficult. I get some definite pear flavors. Apple cider as well. Seems fairly high in acidity. Fruity esters and bubblegum esters dance about way in the background here and there. Dry finish is perceived. Nice little beverage here. Not as good as their Tripel Karmeliet however."
"Very clear and beautiful amber colored body. A few lonely CO2 bubbles rise to the surface of the brew. Initially pours to a thick, bubbly head. Head retention is moderate, leaving trails of running lace. Spicy, malty aroma with a bit of a yeast smell. Malty flavor, slightly sweet, and balanced exceptionally well with spicy hop flavor. Also a rather grainy flavor. Slight aftertaste of green apples. Moderate bodied brew, feels fairly rough due to carbonation and alcohol, while slightly oily due to hops."
"Beautiful deep amber colour, just slightly hazy. Great head. INTENSE aroma of spiced alcohol (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, aniseed), hints of ammonium chloride too. Flavour is malty and spicy, but not as intense as you'd expect from the aroma. Sweetness seems just right. Aftertaste is good, but a bit short. An interesting beer, like so many Belgians."
"Sweet malts at the start. They dry out as you would expect. Then the brew is a bit roasty. The aftertaste is fruity, and the alcohol becomes confident that I am safe with the gas. I am sure glad that this place is not set to sell as soon as someone shows interested in the product"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for an 8%abv brew. While the flavor overall is a bit too bland for my tastes, it certainly goes down easy enough. Still, I like to be challenged with assertive brews, and this isn't one I'll go out of my way for again."
"Clear dark copper hue, covered by a thick, creamy, rutted ivory white head. Belgian lace is left. The aroma is an enticing melange of bright, acidic ripe citrus, and pronounced brittle like nuttiness. Mellow buttery caramel and mildly spicy hops add additional complexity aromawise. As the beer breathes, caramelized malt becomes progressively stronger in aroma and fruitiness diminishes. Flavorwise, this brew has caramel malt character far exceeding any Belgian style I've experienced thus far. Rounded, caramel and molasses tinged sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by mildly herbal phenol and an understated, but perceptibly grassy, chlorophyll tinged hop flavor. Quite light on fermentation byproducts, and other than the mellow clove, a hint of banana esters rides parallel with caramel malt. Hop bitterness is paltry, leaving the overall balance well skewed towards sweetness. Impressions of carob and oak emerge mid palate and complement malt character. Full bodied, with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes long with hints of chalk and fleeting biscuit and banana. Kwak is a delicious and highly drinkable brew. It's most akin to a dubbel in overall character, but with a uniquely assertive caramel malt presence. Kwak gains complexity and depth as it warms and breathes. Smooth, sweet, and somewhat dangerous."
"dark orange colour. light and refreshing look. the first sip had a noticeable alcohol kick. good maltiness that helped give this beer some body. spicey and hints of citrus make this beer pleasurable but not outstanding by any stretch. maybe sampling this beer in it's original ""yard"" glass would have enhanced the experience. nontheless, i liked it quite a bit."
"Orangish/amber in color with a tan head. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, malty, and somewhat fruity. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. The flavor is sweet, bready, and malty. It is a medium bodied brew, and easily drinkable. I enjoyed this brew."
"I am generally not a fan of Belgian-style beers, but I liked this one very much. As an aside, my fiancee, who is German and loves the great beers of that country, proclaimed this beer with its abundant suspended yeast to be ""gross""."
"Mouthfeel is smooth as butter with very very little carbonation. Fruity flavors blend sweetly with a touch of mild hops and warming alcohol towards the end. This is a fine ale to be enjoyed by all, and certainly can compete with the best."
"If youre interested, here's a site where you can see a ""Kwak"" glass: http://www.karmeliet.be/main_eng.html"
"Managed to take the last of the final keg at Monk's when I was there. Slightly hazy amber with a dense creamy off-white head. Nose was enticing with belgian yeast and almost candy like aromas. Flavor was dominated by a sweet maltiness but also showed signs of belgian yeast. Overall I found the flavors to be more subdued. Will definitely try it again hoping not to get the end of the keg."
"Pauwel Kwak is a sentimental favorite or mine reminding me of many days spent at Vol de Nuit in NYC drinking Belgian brews and eating fries and mussels. Tasting this beer always brings me back."
"The glass was perfect for the beer, as it showed off its very fruity/yeasty aroma. The taste was smooth, with strong flavors of citrus fruits, with hints of bready malts. Very nice, very easy to drink, but watch out for the kick of alcohol at the end."
"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. Copper color, with an off-white head. Mild malt aromas, like dark fruits with a little pear thrown in for good measure. Taste is sweet, ripe pear, licorice, and pepper. Pleasantly bitter finish. Locals in Belgium might consider this a fad brew, but I liked it anyway."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Amber color. I found this to be a very smooth Belgian with a sweet and clean flavor. The flavor is definitely better than the name."
" Good beer you need the glass for effect!"
"This pours with a white head that lasted quite a while, leaving great lacing on the sides of the glass. Deep amber colored beer with a nose of sweet and fruity aromas such as banana, cloves and bubblegum...not to far off from a good hefeweizen! Taste has much complexity and depth to it, with some flavors of banana, alcohol, and liquorice/anise all sensed. Little hoppiness to report, finishes up sweet and quite warming."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice bubbly white head.  A good amount of tiny bubble carbonation is present.  An aroma of malt and cinnamon.  A flavor of malt and caramel, with a decent amount of sweetness to a medium body.  Slightly astrigent finish."
"My most recent 750 ml of Kwak was choked with giant protein flakes, to the point where you could feel them slip down your throat..."
"Hazy, deep orangish-red-amber with a creamy white head that holds fairly well and leaves some good lace. The aroma is sweet, with a light caramel maltiness, and shows some alcohol. The body is medium with a soft carbonation that makes it very smooth in the mouth. The flavor is rich, with a lightly fruity & candyish character that has caramel & toffee undertones as well as a light spiciness. Again, the alcohol is somewhat noticeable but not distracting. It may in fact, help to thin the sweetness. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish, but that's the extent of it. Kwak's flavor isn't complex, but it is quite luxurious. A really enjoyable beer that should be lingered over. Highly recommended."
"I was not impressed with this beer when I had my first sip after it was poured.  But things definitely got better as it started to warm up.  As it warmed up the malt and hops became more apparent.  Nice little hop taste on the beginning of the tongue, followed by nice malt and toffee taste at the back of the tongue, warming itself as it travels down your throat.  This is a beer to be sipped over a long period of time after it has warmed to enjoy all its character."
"Quite nice caramelly malt flavours, slightly spicy, i liked it, but lacking perhaps a bit of complexity, slightly sweet aswell, but well balanced."
"Notes: It is definitely a strong ale being that its alcoholic prowess flexes its muscles right away. A decent strong ale though seems to be a bit over the top for its own self, lacks complexity and depth and a bit too much on the esters(too warm of a fermentation?) though makes up with its drinkability."
"Tried this at a beer tasting last night,was one of those beers that doesn't jump out at you by apperance,but its decieving.Nice golden and slight cloudyness.Nice nose but can detect some phenols.Great balance that finishes with a little creamyness.It was one of those beers that appeals to people that like lighter beers and those that like strong ones."
"I thought this to be a mediocre brew when I had it in Belgium, and so did the locals. Most who drank it, did so because it's served in mini-yard glass with a wooden holder. More of a fad brew."
