The flavor has a lot of grape to it, subtle floral elements and a Belgian yeast funk.  Alcohol is kept at bay for the most part, and this is a refreshing option.  Full bodied, well carbonated feel with a slight dryness.  Overall, this is a good ale but seems to lack direction in the smell and taste.","Stinkypuss","Nov 01, 2014"

You get a touch of sour, some funk, a little sweetness, a little booziness and finishes with a slight hop bitterness. Overall its an easy drinking 9% brew and has alot going on. It didn't quite give me the WOW factor but its definitely at that level just on the cusp of a world class brew but not quite there.

3.7,-5.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a slightly hazed, bright orange-gold coloring with a thin, whispy, filmy coating on the surface. Some slow carbonation throughout the body present while you drink. Aromas of toasted grains, sweet and tart grape, and some berry sweet and bubblegum from the Belgian yeast. Flavors are light and effervescent from the crisp body and carbonation. Toasty grain backbone with white wine characteristics, both in dry sweetness and booze kick. Like a dry Pinot Gris. Some of the funky character from the yeast shines through, but not much. Pretty well balanced palate, maybe slightly leaning to the dry side. The aftertaste also has the wine-like feel, with a dry, fruity grist flavoring. Dry and smooth finish, with a slight sweet and tart linger. Interesting and unique beer.","GarthDanielson","May 24, 2013"

Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big white grape, grape skin, pear, apple, honey, floral, apricot, grass, herbal earthiness, white wine, light black pepper, light funk, and light yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt notes and yeast esters. Taste of big white grape, pear, apple, apricot, honey, floral, grass, herbal earthiness, light pepper, white wine, light black pepper, light funk, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal earthiness, light funk, and white wine on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of malt/yeast esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Strong pale ale. Great flavor balance and complexity of malt and yeast esters; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 25, 2012"

4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This brew poured with a barely there white head on a clear, yellow body. Mild carbonation was visible in the body. The nose had a hint of tartness, and this is where the chardonnay grapes became apparent. On the taste, it definitely had a lot of Belgian yeast to it, which was quite tasty. The grapes were also very apparent in the taste, but not cloying or overly sweet. The sweetness was just enough to be pleasant. The mild carbonation really complemented the lighter than expected body. I also got hints of pear and apricot as I sipped more on the brew. The finish was quick and sweet. What also surprised me was how high the booze was on this bad boy. It was completely and totally hidden. I would definitely have this beer again!","mgironta","Sep 12, 2012"

This beer would be a good low alcohol substitute for a 14-15% chardonnay, and you could definitely use this to wean a white wine drinker into beer. Aging has not hurt it; I think I'll buy a few more and lay them down for a couple years. It is a bit pricey at around $18, but it is as worthy in MHO as Cantillon lambics made with white grapes, which I also adore; this is taking a belgian golden ale in the same direction, but with a bigger malt body and nice creamy carbonation that is a great meld of a golden ale and grapes.","Beerenauslese","Aug 26, 2011"

As a fairly avid wine drinker as an active beer advocate (though my love for beer far transcends that of wine), I think this is an excellent hybrid between the two alcohols. It starts with an aggressive grape note, but from the middle to finish, the beer has time to develop its own complexities and flavors, so overall I don't feel one side dominates over the other. I could see someone who doesn't enjoy wine (especially white wines) not particularly enjoying this beer, as the start of the beer and the dry finish is ripped directly from white wine, but those who enjoy white wine could definitely jump into this beer.","nhindian","Aug 14, 2011"

The flavors were very similar but I liked it better than the Victor. Lots of orange and more fruity sweetness was the primary difference aiding in how drinkable I found it. I also thought the alcohol was better hidden. It reminded me of a rose champagne, fruity, highly carbonated and fizzy in the mouth only with a malty complexity.

3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Hazy and an orange/peach colour, this beer poured with a yellow/beige cap that formed some clumpy lacing that really stuck to the glass. Aromas were bready and yeasty, quite fruity with grapes and ripe oranges, delicate spices and a bit of alcohol. Mild bitterness, fruity peaches, malt and honey, biscuit and bread, with sweet apricots and light spice in the finish. Just a bit of alcohol flavour and warmth. Plenty of carbonation, medium bodied, a tad coarse in texture until the carbonation settled down. Pretty good. I'd gladly have this again.","DrJay","Dec 27, 2008"
3.67,-6.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a small head that settled into nothingness, flat. The aroma is sweet, apricot, coriander, honey and green apple. The taste is of tropical fruit and coriander. Big spice profile, perhaps some white pepper. Some honey notes as well. I don't really pick up the white grapes as I did on the Victor. The brew has a moderate body, prickly carbonation, sweet and a bit sticky. A spicy BSPA for sure. Not really my bag but others might like it. I preferred the Victor over the Victoria.","Gmann","Nov 19, 2008"

3.98,1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The aroma is kind of weak for a strong ale but there is definitely a fruity grapeness with yeast and malt and very little or no hops.

3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"a cloudly, very light amber color... almost saison like. a sufficent head. not a lot but consistent. no lace. smell of apricot, astrigent, hop and grape esters... like that of a grape juice... not minerally but tangy with a light malt. the malt is with the grape tangy where as the hop is with the herbal quality... heavy thyme. quite crisp and dry. the crispness isn't a dry mineral sensation as the grape seems to lack the quality of the skin. it more subdued and exposed in the herbal effect. this beer lack the earth to be fantastic. its great but by way of two very separate things the hop dryness and the malt tangy all very crisp but this is lost in the high alcohol content. great with food... not back only. i would highly recommend game birds.","rtepiak","Aug 08, 2008"

3.85,-1.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a golden amber with a finely beaded head that is quite healthy. Fades to a ring. Sweet, very ripe grapes followed by some Belgian yeast tang and some light citrusy bitterness in the aroma. The taste has more of that extreme grape flavor going on, especially up front. Sweet, ripe grapes followed by a spicy, fizzy, aftertaste with hints of clove and fennel as well as some late earthy bitterness. Up front this almost tastes like Most- the Austrian drink of wine that is not fully fermented, but the finish tastes more like a more herbal version of a tripel. Mixed reaction to this one at my house. I think it is somewhat unusual, and fairly pleasant, but by no means would this make my regular to drink list. I've actually had this a few times now but neglected to review it. I'm probably done with this at this point.","Georgiabeer","Jul 06, 2008"

There was also a Belgian maltiness. The taste was lightly tart grape skins with Belgian malt and light hoppiness. There was a faint flavor of tannins. Overall the flavors were somewhat subtle. The mouthfeel was very dry with medium body and very pronounced carbonation (frothy). The sweet maltiness and grape skin flavors lingered.

4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Despite my comments regarding the heft of this beer, this has disappeared remarkably fast from my glass. Something about it is definitely drinkable, though I still would not say it is quaffable. I think it might be the acidity here, there is just enough to not allow the sweetness to become overbearing and actually it keeps it quite manageable. I definitely think this would be much better at a slightly lower alcohol content; at 6% or even 7% this would be quite a bit easier to drink and would actually be more in line with what one typically expects from a Chardonnay grape. This is definitely a hard one to judge, on its individual components I would score this quite highly, and even overall I am enjoying it, but I don't think it is as good as it objectively seems.","Gueuzedude","Nov 03, 2006"

Head gets reinforcements in small constant bubbles rising form the bottom of the glass, and lasts accordingly, with delicate lacing. Aroma is slightly spicy sweetness, with effervescent notes. Taste is moderate maltiness upfront, with spicing coming on, and a dry lightly fruity close. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy over the tongue, and drinkability is very nice for the abv.
