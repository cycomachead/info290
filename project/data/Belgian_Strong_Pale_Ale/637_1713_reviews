"It's not bad but just doesn't come and grab me like the rest of the Dupont family.  It's also a little bit hot in feel and flavor strangely, and seems to hint more towards saison character, so I'd prefer the others if that's the direction for me."

"When poured into a chalice, it had about an inch of head with a cloudy honey color. There was significant lace upon agitation. It was sweet, with some spicy and mild bitter notes. There is also a yeasty flavor, similar to what you may taste in a  hefeweizen. There is a mild alcohol taste near then end. Overall it is refreshing beer."

"Moinette Blond pours hazy gold with a fluffy 2” mountainous, persistent white foam cap that rises up above the rim of the glass, leaving thick lace, with a small mound of foam remaining in the glass when you finish. It evokes the kind of foam one sees on the seashore. The nose is honey infused herbs with some light fruit and traces of bread. Light honey, peach, citrus, light grain and biscuit flavors roll over the tongue with a trace of funk, culminating in a slightly sweet finish moderated by a moderately bitter accent.  It has very fine soft carbonation that produces a delightfully airy texture. It has a medium body and it very refreshing. Dupont uses those damn green bottles for this - I would give it 100 but every fourth or fifth bottle is skunky."

"A nice beer but not much more than a regular Belgian strong ale."
"O: Yeah, pretty good."

"From a corked 750, looks like 10/2014 bottling. Pours a clear gold with lots of fine sediment in suspension, thick head of dense white foam, thick cap remains, thick sheet down the glass. Smell: floral, lightly biscuity, orange marmalade, coriander, clove, and soft banana-ish note. Taste: grassy with a note of coriander, pear and apricot, sugary and lightly biscuity; more coming out towards the end of the sip... notes of coconut, banana, canned mandarin orange, candied lemon finish. Body like whipped cream but fantastically easy drinking. There's so much more going on here than in most BSPAs, whether trying to fit to a style or not, this is excellent."
"12/20...pours hazy dark gold, 1/4 inch fluffy white foam. Funky yeast nose, but light. Lighter blonde taste, some belgian yeast rises with a spicy hop. Light bodied, some complexity of taste. Creative."

"Like the sourness, but it should not be in a blond."

"Outstanding beer. In my opinion one of the best references for a Belgium Blond Ale, as other Dupont, it is intense in spices, complex and with a relatively good amount of herbal hops."
""
""
"O - I liked the sourness - I find the sweetness of some Belgian blondes and strong ales a bit off putting.  This beer is more tarty than others with a similar ABV, but the crisp finish is all I remember.  The spiciness is potent, which I'm not fully sold on."

"Very enjoyable Belgian beer, this one was reminiscent of a saison early on and not being the biggest fan of the style I was initially worried but the funk, tart and Belgian yeast died down some and the fruit flavours and spice slowly took over. The beer was a well balanced some and despite the alcohol content it still managed to go down easily, While it's not a beer that I'd go back to time and again, I would definitely consider trying again at some point in the future."

"(O)- Granted, this is not technically in the same style, but I might prefer this to their classic Saison Dupont. This is just so wonderfully dry, balanced, and layered flavors that would make this ideal to have bottles around when grilling in the backyard in summer time."

"OVERALL : Dupont always manage to come up with amazing stuff, and this is no exception. I've got a whole case of it and it's not going to last me half as long as I'd like it to. The warm boozy side is going to be great, this winter."

"Heavy side of light body. Creamy carb and mouthfeel. This drinks really nicely. Belgian brews are so hit and miss for me, this one was definetely good. Worth trying."
"O-outstanding ale with great flavors and balance, will definitely seek this out again"

"Don’t be fooled by the “blonde ale” on the label—this is anything but your run of the mill (bland) blonde ale."

"750ml bottle: Pulled the cork from this and found that it said 2006 on it. It should be interesting to see how it has held up after almost 7 years. It opened with a fairly loud ""POP"". It pours a fairly clear, darker golden color. There was a small white head on it that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The aroma is good, but a bit subdued. Definitely yeasty and bready nose. Lighter aromas of spice, banana and lemon. Maybe a touch of Brett. The taste is very good. It is extremely smooth. Bready, lightly spiced, hint of lemon. A very small hint of sourness. Very nice!"

"O- This beer is nice to drink even though more carbonation would have really helped out. The Brett flavor carries the beer as the rest is pretty light. I was surprised at the taste when I pulled the cork and saw it was a 2009."
"Overall, very good."
""
""
""
""
"Bright and citrussy, with an astringent finish that makes this very refreshing. A good food beer. Another winner from Dupont."
""

"O - I consider this beer a very strong saison, rather than a pale ale. It has moderate hop character and is very dry and sharp. It would be more to my taste if a bit softer"

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- Probably the best blonde I've ever had...sorry honey."
"D/O: Really an all around great brew. The farmhouse ale is certainly a strong blonde, but it's also boarding on a bier de garde/saison."
"O: This beer is about 100 times better than I thought it would be. I mean I knew it would be good but I wasn't sure I would think so highly of it. Bravo Moinette, I'm going to become a regular drinker of this beer."
"Overall amazing strong saison easily the star of the night"
"Awesome beer. It is a great aperitif beer, a wonderful companion with mussels or a welsh rabbit. Excellent nightcap. Can turn into a deadly trap if drink without moderation..."
"Overall: highly drinkable with the mouthfeel comfortable and both the flavor and nose full for the style."
""
""
"O: Excellent Triple specimens. Mandatory for Belgian beer lovers"
"M: dry, slight astringency in finish when first poured (CO2), astringency subsided, very balanced and easy drinking for ABV, some EtOH noticeable"

"Overall, this is an impressive beer. I consider it a great example of the style. Luckily, it is easily found here in Maine, so I can get a bottle nearly any time I want. If you haven't tried it before, it is recommended."
"O: A very drinkable belgian blonde ale. A little spicy. Good."
""
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic brew. Nice to have it on tap at Sycamore."
""
""
"Overall - Surprising but very enjoyable, I'll definitely order this one again and will surely review my tasting with more experience. I would however give preference to a Chouffe over this one."
"Overall – The carbonation level was very very high.. the beer made my mouth tingle. The flavours are not subtle and the alcohol is very well hidden. Definitely an above average beer that warrants trying at least once."
"Overall: What a beer. Will buy again."
"O/D - Seems like there's too much spice and yeast mixed together for my tastes. Maybe it's just me, but I can't really enjoy this too much."
"A classy and characterful Belgian Ale with a fruity overtone with balance of spice and herbs. It's easy to see why this is quentessential of well made Belgian Ales."
"O - This stuff is dangerously sessionable for the ABV. Feels quite basic but is just delicious. Gets better as it warms. Top shelf Belgian."
"jd"
"O: A good Belgian Strong Pale Ale with a nice taste profile."
"Overall: Moinette Blonde proves to be a very tasty belgian pale ale, with great strength, flavor and body. Was not expecting the hop presence to be so strong. Reccommended."
"If you like your Belgian pales and goldens dry, then drink this beer, it's a classic."
"Classic."
"The only thing holding its drinkability back is the ABV. Totally delicious, awesome stuff. I would definitely pick this up again should I run into it."
"O - Very nice. I really love Dupont's beers, and this one is also very enjoyable."
"O: Fairly complex, bordering on saison, but not as bitter. Worth the $$$."
"Drink- This was a great pale ale with a twist. Big ABV and flavors. I could drink this all night long. I would like to have a bottle or two around the house."
"Worth a try."
"Not many people are buying this at my liquor store so we put it on clearance. A shame."
"Pours pale gold with a towering, growing head. Nose shows light fruit, mainly lemon, pears and green apples. Alcohol is fairly noticeable, mixing with spicy phenols. Flavours are not so great... Quite sweet at first with more light fruit and candi sugar along with a doughy yeast character. Then the booze creeps through and mixes with a sharp bitterness to create a slightly off-putting finish. Carbonation is too high."
"O: This is a beer that needs to be sipped due to its dryness and strength, although the alcohol is mostly masked from the taste."
"A strong pale ale or a saison? I would say the second. Sure, a very good beer"
"Drinkability: Will become my go-to Belgian Strong Pale Ale. The class of the style sampled so-far."
"O: Very complex and well done Strong Pale Ale; the smell exceeds expectations, and perhaps causes the taste to be a little disappointing; however, the taste is great, and mouthfeel is beautiful; this is a well-balanced and delicious brew!"
"O: Very nice blonde."
"D-A definitive example of the style, not to be missed."
"D: medium"
"An enjoyable enough strong Belgian pale ale, lots of fruit and spice, with the alcohol just percolating under the surface. I would imagine that this would be an agreeable way to see the sights and get high in Hainaut, or blasted in Bruges."
"Served to me with a finger of creamy white head. Good retention and lacing. Color is a bright gold with a fair amount of cloudiness. Smell is fruity, yeasty and bready. Apple and pear notes mix with a zesty yeast aroma of coriander and pepper. Palate is complex, yet very approachable. Same fruity and spicy flavors from the nose. Alcohol is hidden very well, making this a dangerous brew. Quite a well made brew."
"I initially tried this beer straight from my frig. Doesn't smell strong, smelled like Belgian sweetness. My first impression of it was fine, but it got way better as it warmed up. I thought it was the best when almost room temp, around the 60 degree ballpark."
"Beer is sweet and light in body. Heavily carbonated on the mouth. If this wasn't on the best of Belgium list I wouldn't have bothered, it's nothing special, its a moderately dry, moderately spicy moderately yeasty moderate beer. Who cares?"
"Highly drinkable, and would pair very well with shellfish or fatty white fish (mackerel, snapper, halibut, etc). Lacks a little complexity compared to my favorite examples of the style (e.g. those by De Dolle)...but still an exceptional ale."
"A unique and very nice beer experience."
"Pours a light yellow-orange. Initial hard pour yields a nice, tall head that falls down and leaves a bit of lacing. Nose is pretty diverse with citrus, lemon, grass, hay, and some earth. The taste really brigs head components to life and integrates it all quite well. A nice bit of grassy earth is carried by ample carbonaion and results in a moderately dry finish. Drinks quite well and makes an excellent choice alone or with a good number of foods."
"Overall: Good. It seems to have a slight lager finish. This is a definite wheat and yeast prominent beer!"
"D-extremely well balanced with a great level of complexity creating an extremely tasty beer that brings notes of spice, fruit, and hints of funk. wow, give me more!"
"Drinkability: Not a bad drinking beer. Not generally a style I typically reach for, but I'm enjoying it. It goes pretty good with his warm fall evening we've got lined up here. I could see myself enjoying this brew again, though I do admin I wouldn't go on a late night beer run just to score some."
"I can think of a few American breweries that could learn a thing or two from BD's consistency-- everything I ever had from this brewery has been A-level. This beer is no exception. Wads of nutmeg, yeast, cherries, butter (salted? unsalted? I can't decide... not that I even know the difference) and cloves burst quietly from the meringue-like head. The golden color and the happy trail of bubbles that float from the foot of my glass make me wish I was a half-inch tall so I could swim in this beer. Nutmeg leads the flavor derby here, followed by a nice right-out-of-the-oven white bread and a light dressing of barnyard funk. Dull-edged hops make an entrance at the very end, but not enough to offend. Not something to slam next to the pool, but rather to sip while reading the NY Times with one's spouse on a warm, late-summer evening in Provincetown."
"Taste is tart, fruity and Belgian hops. It also has a background sweetness which makes this more drinkable. Lots of carbonated bite and average mouth feel. Alcohol is well hidden."
"An unexpected pleasant experience."
"Drinkability: A BSPA? Not like any I have tasted previously. How about an Imperial Saison?"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Fluffy tan head on a clear gold. Head soon diminishes to a thin layer. Thin lacing. Malty smells. Taste is very smooth and deceptively light. Malty with a light hop finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Drinkability is very good but for the high ABV."
"An awesome beer and fully deserving of its status in the top 10 for the style."
"Really nicely done beer, what else from Dupont. Can't say it's rocking my world but a really classy, well made beer."
"D - Not as complex as others but still highly drinkable."
"pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with a smallish head but a fresh white ring with some nice lacing on glass..smell is of fruit and spices some hops and some citrus and some musty grass..taste is fruit like bananas and pears and apples..then some floral hops some nice yeast tastes as well throw is some bread and hops..this BSPA is well balanced and medium on the palate its full of flavor and very drinkable enjoyed and recommend"
"D: An extremely sneaky-good Belgian pale ale -- a very different beer than Duvel with a highly malty and fruity profile countered by a citrusy, lemony very dry finish. Yeast is strong here too and adds another dimension of spicy fruitiness. A very nice brew."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight pale malt, hint of citrus, hint of hops, and dough. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness noticeable. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, hops, slight wheat, and dough. Overall, good aroma, blend, body, and appearance."
"Poured hazy orange color with an average frothy white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex spicy fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium fruity balanced flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to long duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a refreshing standout beer."
"D- I don't think I could have more than one bottle as it seems like it would cheapen it, but just that amount seems perfect to appreciate. Has a bit of ""oomph"" to it with the abv% and definitely continues to have fun with my taste buds even as it warms up. Enjoy!"
"D - Refreshing and delicious with good flavor and the ABV although higher its still a very drinkable beer."
"Notes: Nice beer that is easy to drink and tasty. Not really like the other BSPA that I have had, it has some aspects of a BSPA but also some of a Tripel and a Saison. Well balanced with a good amount of fruity flavors. Not amazing or stand out but a solid beer."
"D: Fantastic beer, a sip draws you in more. A great beer to welcome the coming spring, reminds me that there is more than the soul crushing darkness of the winter months out there. Another winner from DuPont."
"* = ideas from fellow taster"
"D Fair to good due to the ABV (which is well hidden but still, at 8.5%, is still up there) and the relative big feel as well. 3.5"
"Overall a really nice Belgian strong pale. Very strong, very unique, very glad I gave it a try."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, pale malt scent along with a dry, earthy yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a bitter, earthy character that's quite genuine and well integrated with the basic pale malt bill. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some light hop flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a traditional Belgian pale. It's smooth and easy drinking with lots of excellent yeast character."
"Wonderful BSPA, but a little less interesting than either the Duvel or the Delirium Tremens. Moinette is more subtle. Very drinkable, but the bold mouthfeel of Duvel and the rich flavors of the Delirium are both more muted in the Moinette. Wonderful beer, but not best in its class."
"The nose is floral and well hopped, like the mouth is just as much and is reminiscent of a Westmalle Triple by force of hops used. Several varieties are probably present. The finish is dry but still powerful. Not at all sweet, it is earthy, reminiscent of earth, roots and usually hops in its most pure apparence."
"Bottle 2008. Silty blond appearance with floaties. Aroma is kind of wild, skunk, citrus, toast. Taste is quite grassy, bitter & dry alcohol showing in the finish. O.K. palate, a little too sparkling but quite full bodied. Had higher expectations but pretty good anyways."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a half inch of white head that slowly settles to a thin skin of bubbles. Yeast particulate is left floating in the beer. My first pour from a 330ml bottle was slow and deliberate and left vitrually zero head, the second bottle I aggressively poured and got the small head but also all the yeast. Either way I was not impressed. Much more impressive in the aroma and flavor departments. I get a nice spicey aroma of cloves, pepper, and other yeasty smells. The flavor follows the aroma with the same charactoristics excecpt with the addition of some yeast esters that add some sweetness and fruit flavors. No sign of alcohol in either aroma or flavor. Medium body and a spritely carbonation. The bubbles added a needed lift and life. A good beer but when it is compared to the granddaddy of BSPAs, Duvel. I would take Duvel every time. Espiecially when Duvel is $5 cheaper a 4-pack."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is fantastic, creamy smooth and well carbonated. Drinkabilty is very high seeing as how the alcohol doesn't come out through the delicious flavor."
"D. i will buy this again and will enjoy it often. i think that the balance on this beer was great. the flavors were all enjoyable and rich but the beer did not overpower"
"On tap at The Olde Forge in Lanesborough,MASS.. Served from the tap in a goblet type belgian glass. Outstanding beer..Taste reminded me of Nilla Wafers (this is an absolute highbrow comparison)..Had to order another just to make sure..Look forward to enjoying this beer again."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. 1 finger of pillowy foam rests on top of a golden body. Aroma is beautiful. Refreshing belgian yeast, clove and banana dominate. Lacing is soapy and lingers for just a bit. Worth mentioning is that I swear I saw a dinosaur silhouette in the lacing, brachiosaurus, I believe. Allowed the beer to warm to desired temperature while I researched the name of the dinosaur that I saw in the lacing. Anywho...taste is all that, and a bag of chips. Amazing masking of 8.5% ABV. Sweet citrus and Belgian yeast dominates the taste. Just beautiful. Simply."
"this is one of the better Belgian blond ales I can remember trying, pick it up if you get the chance"
"A very good beer overall. The alcohol comes through towards the end, but is not overpowering. Easy to drink and enjoyable; this is the type of beer that leads to trouble since it's light and tasty and has 8.5% ABV...my advice is pick one up and get in trouble."
"This is a very enjoyable BSPA/Saison. Lots of subtle complexities. Something that I would recommend."
"Thick, dense head that leaves great, chunky lace. Cloudy and orange-amber. The aroma is earthy, grainy and dry. The flavor is complex: smooth and light, some sourness but there is a solid hop kick at the swallow although the aftertaste has the sourness show up again."
"Drinkability- A great beginning Belgian for the uninitiated. As for Belgian lovers, it's still very nice."
"This is a great and crisp ale, but the funky aroma doesn't go along with the taste, which was a good thing."
"Smells sweet and fruity, the taste was much of the same. Some good apple and pear flavors for me. I noticed the alcohol in this but it wasn't too strong. I also pickedup some spice in this. Overall a good beer. Not my thing, but still pretty good"
"D: refreshing for the summer, but complex and interesting enough to enjoy anytime!"
"Medium to high carbonation with a bit of a chalky finish. Couldn't really taste the alcohol. Very decent beer."
"On tap at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul. Appeared in a red wine glass with a couple finger of head and a hazy yellow body. Man, this was a heck of a beer to start the night with. Not much else I drank could keep up with it. Big spicy vanilla, toasted bread rolls with citrus zest and biting hops - lots going on. And compared to other Beglians, like the Long Strange Tripel from Boulevard (which is also a great beer) I had afterward, the flavors are very rich. The beer doesn't overpower your taste buds like a DIPA, but it's not all mellow, subtle flavor. Clearly an excellent Belgian. One of the best I've tried in the style. No Question."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger foamy/fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty/yeasty, with some corinader, bananna notes. The taste is malty/yeasty, bitter, with some corinader/bananna notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew."
"Overall - An excellent Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Certainly not as good as Duvel, but still very good."
"Poured from a bottle, this experience was great from the moment the top came off. Immediately I noticed big floaters and a lot of sediment that poured from the bottle -- there's no mistaking that this is bottle conditioned. It is a beautiful tangerine color that lets plenty of light through, with a head that poured large but receded quickly. Lots of really pretty lacing. Nose was grass, phenols, pears. The taste was wonderfully complex, having a great smooth, long lasting finish. I've only seen this beer a few times but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"750ml. A 2005 vintage. Looks just drop dead gorgeous. Very effervescent, clear almost backlit gold with a dense creamy pure white head. Great citrus smell, with oranges, apricots, and a woody background. Wonderfully smooth, malty flavor. The fruit puts in just enough appearance to sex the place up. It has a peppery spice that balances it all out and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is perfect carbonation and then a silky, buttery texture underneath. Drinkability is wonderful. It is light, balanced, mellow, and delicious. I don't know if this is a strong pale ale or a saison but I know I'm getting more. I love these guys."
"Pours an amber color body, cloudy, sediment in bottom. Big white head, creamy, somewhat lasting. Belgian flowery aroma, some grapes, musky, dusty. Old world smelling. Flowery, sweet taste. Sour aftertaste. Not as belgian ale, but more like a gueze. Interesting taste, some alcohol."
"Poured a nice yellowish color into a tulip glass. The head is a nice fluffy white and stays there for quite some time. As it simmers, there is lace all around the glass that stays there until you drink all of the brew. Smell is crisp and a slight banana smell along with malt. Fist taste was breath taking. bananas, malt, very complex but yet incredibility smooth and crisp. very little aftertaste. light feeling in the mouth, one cannot help but continually drinking this and wanting more. This beer has made me want more Belgian's, but I don't see how this could be improved on. A must have, in my opinion."
"D - Eminently quaffable - dangerously so, given the beer's strength. Not very complex but otherwise outstanding."
"33cL bottle. Pours an opaque apple juice color with a thick, frothy white head. The cap resides after a minute or so to leave behind some decent lacing. Lots of sediment. Smells of farmhouse yeast, coriander, and some sweet fruit esters. The spiciness is the first thing noticeable upon tasting with black pepper jumping out this time. Later, the slightly sweet, maltier side shows itself, with a dry, lightly hopped finish. Quite refreshing, and it certainly doesn't taste like an 8.5% brew. Hard to go wrong with Dupont."
"Bottle from a wine shop in Davis, the name of which i can never remember. I bought this because it looked old (mold on the top of the cork, dust on the bottle) but also like it had been stored in the cooler under low light. Pulled out the cork and sure enough it said ""2005", so that's pretty good. Pours a nice bright yellow orange with a massive, almost overflowing white head. Head sticks around indefinitely as bubbles continually rise in an energetic fashion. Aroma is tough to pin down. Definitely Belgian, with obvious fruity ethanol on a nice clean malt base. Hint of an earthy yeast and some kind of fruit, like peaches or nectarines. Flavor is fairly strong, with up front ethanol and other alcohol notes. Spicy light malt with what tastes like a bit of wheat malt int here too, though i could be mistaken about that. Nice spicy to grassy hop notes too, somehow having survived the time in the bottle. Mouthfeel is, id say, medium bodied, with a bit of a syrupy quality, though this isn't detrimental to the beer. Overall, a very tasty beer and a good find."
"This beer was relatively flavorless, the color was a golden blonde but lacked any real character. Overall, I did not think this beer was worth the cost and did not meet my expectations from the belgian blonde. The bottle fermented blonde was a severe disappointment."
"Taste is better than hoped for. Tart acidic up front, followed by an array of musty ""funk"" sweet orange,granny smith apples, that ""horse"" funkiness-that-we-all-love passionfruit, peach, spicy coriander,touch of black pepper. Not really a touch of hops to be found, and that is beautiful as I have been drinking lots of Barleywines lately. Ends long,spicy, sweet and floral. Amazingly complex yet again.Mouthfeel is creamy, yet biting and warm on the finish. This is great,fantastic, I don't know how to sip on it!"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable.. I could give it a try in a four pack as well. Very nice considering it's age."
"I really enjoyed this blonde from Dupont. No disrespect intended to other brewers but I've had a number of beers from other countries attempt to make a beer like this, and they just don't measure up. The Belgians just have it down."
"Overall: I will buy this again. It's only $5.00 for a 750mL bottle. Great value and great flavour for the price. Amazing beer. I need to try Dupont's Saison very soon, but Merry Christmas everyone! :) Peace."
"D - One of my good sippers, worth a try if you get one, well-balanced"
"There was not a lot of head and it did not last very long. Very little retention. It was very hazy and lots of obvious sediment. Lots of phenolic characteristics. So much happening in that aroma! Spiciness in the taste - pepper. A bit of apple. Moderate body. One very interesting beer."
"pours slightly darker than a saison. orange in color. medium head nice lace. smell is cane, fruit malt, banana, and floral qualities. some yeastiness. taste is pine hop, a light pilsner saison follow through and the cane sugar. not too sweet. cane and yeast have a chalky potassium quality. hence the banana. no trace of alcohol. light apple finish. not as crisp astringent as hoped though. would like to see the carbonation of a dupont in this."
"A truly sublime Belgian golden ale. Sweet, spicy nose, with a nice balance of hoppy tang. Velvety mouthfeel. Notes of honey, butterscotch, coriander, clove. No session beer, this, its high alcohol content makes this one to savor. Warming...delicious."
"In short, yes. More please."
"The spiciness drops the drinkability a point. I can just feel that this one would be a heartburn monster, when consuming multiple bottles. (No, I don't get heartburn easily, or frequently, for that matter.)"
"An altogether excellent beer. Perhaps my favorite of the Dupont line."
"As expected for this style & ABV it does feel a little heavy, so I wouldn't do a session on it, but ohhh, how enjoyable for 3 or 4 glasses."
"Flavor of raw hops, citrus and yeast. Awesome. Exeptionaly dry and drinkable. At 8.5 avb, its a knock your socks off beer."
"This isn't sweet like your usual Belgian Golden Ale. Moinette Blond shares a number of characterists with its cousin Saison Dupont. High praise for this gem."
"I liked this beer and would drink it again."
"Pours a nice hazy dark yellow with a diminishing head. Aroma is a nice blend of sweet malt, spice, hops, and yeast. The taste is a nice comlex plend of sweet malts and lingering Earthy hops. The beer is somewhat heavy but not over the top, there is also a nice dryness. This is a truly special beer to say the least."
"Seems to me this is a fuller bodied Saison /dupont with more spice and less fruit. The thing I love about this beer is the smoothness even at a fairly high ABV. The beer is very balanced with a slightly dry finish that keeps you coming back for more."
"d: a good belgian pale"
"On tap at The Back Abbey in Claremont, CA. Poured into a Moinette chalice. Pours a light clear yellow with a nice big fluffy white head. Smell was typical Belgian yeast earthy. The taste was a bit disappointing to me for a strong pale ale. It was pretty watery thin and really one dimensional in that earthiness, only the slightest amount of fruity esters which I think it needed more of. It was still not a bad beer overall, the mouthfeel was the biggest disappointment with the taste only being a slight disappointment. I had a Saison Dupont afterward that I enjoyed a lot more."
"D: The beer had a nice drinkability with a nice smooth sourness of oranges, lemons and very enjoyable."
"Moinette Blonde pours a golden color with some cloudiness & a thick, white head. There is some lacing. The smell is of strong yeast and floral scents. The taste is complex--bitter, fair amount of hops, pear, a hint of lemon and some spicy flavors. The aftertaste is strongly bitter. Mouthfeel is surprisingly flat at first with an acidic bite later on. Moderately drinkable beer, but I'm a little disappointed in this offering from the much praised Brasserie Dupont."
"This ale pours a medium gold color with lively carbonation bubbles and a massive, frothy white head that won't subside. A slight haze appears in the beer, especially as the bottle is carefully emptied, as a result of the bottle conditioning. Belgian lacing lines the glassware in thick sheets. The nose is a wonderful combination of raw, funky and spicy notes you'd expect from a world class saison combined with the sweet and fruity notes of a Belgian pale ale. Enchanting peppery notes play off of the tell-tale Belgian yeast in a masterful way. The palate is terrifically spicy and packs a terrific hop smack right up front so you don't confuse this beer with a typical Belgian Pale or Golden ale. Behind the spice, a bouquet of fruity flavors fill the mouth - citrus (lemon) and some papaya are predominant. There is just enough yeasty funkiness here to remind one of Dupont's famous saison. A terrific ""hybrid"" of two of my favorite styles - I'm really enjoying this one. Incredibly balanced, the aggressive hops and active carbonation assure that this beer is not too heavy on the palate and surprisingly effervescent for the 8.5% ABV. The alcohol strength is very well hidden making this one dangerously drinkable. Smooth finish and incredibly complex, this is a ""bigger"" version of Dupont's excellent saison in many ways - the spicy, funky character is there but so is the rick, sweet maltiness of a fine Belgian strong pale ... I love it."
"Mouthfeel is good as the body is not so big that it overtakes the nice tastes. The body does allow for cloying, which toward the end of the drink, could be a distraction. Nice for a day like today."
"Bought this one on a tour of France and Spain. Was not as impressive as I had hoped, but still pretty good."
"D: this is a nice complex ale."
"Sa robe opaque orangée et sa mousse abondante sont agréable. Son nez est un peu amer, avec des odeurs de houblon et d'herbe. En bouche, elle est beaucoup plus douce que prévue. Légèrement sucrée, avec une touche d'agrumes, son goût est évolutif avec sa température. Agréable, surtout en mangeant (mon opinion concernant la plupart des pales ales!)."
"D-Pretty good. I could have a few of these."
"Recommended..."
"Drinkability: Wow, this is the best Belgian ale I've had in a while. I will certainly be picking up more. I want to make it last because it's my only bottle, but I just can't stop quaffing! Very yummy with apricot Stilton, and interesting but not great with Parmesan. A poor fit for Cheddar."
"Nice creamy head that releases a wonderfully earthy saison aroma.For a blond it has some beautiful caramel and amber colors coming through. The taste is simply divine, grassy notes with some farm house flavors and pepper. It has a slight sweetness upfront but finishes with a strong yet smooth dryness with a fair amount of bitter. The mouthfeel was about as smooth as they come and the surprising refreshingness led me to believe I could drink a lot of this in one sitting especially during the hot summer months. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone. I also found that pairing it with a sharper aged cheese like provolone worked fantastic, with the beer serveing as a sort of palate cleanser."
"Pours a fully clouded orange with a nice off white head. Looks just beautiful. Nose is a consistent yeasty funk. Flavor is very nice. Very nice indeed. Nice full funk with a mild sugar tone that is not very visible. Mostly it is the yeast just dancing in your mouth. Very robust. Very hearty. Feel has a high carbonation that is almost a bit attacking on the tongue. Overall this is a very drinkable BSPA. Definitely worth trying."
"For me, this beer is missing nothing."
"A well executed beer that is easy to drink. I would definetly seek ths out again"
"Drinkability : Bonne bière noble"
"M/D: Nice creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied, good amount of carbonation, very drinkable as alcohol is masked very well."
"Would I buy another 4 pack at the $17.19 price tag...probably not soon...but an interesting and worthwhile beer experience none-the-less."
"D - Alright. It is very bitter with otherwise a mild flavor. I have no problem finishing it, but it is a bit harsh. Not worth having again. I expected more from Dupont."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a magnificently pillowy creamy white head that lasts almost forever and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of white lace. An absolutely beautiful beer. Nose is fruity and spicy with notes of clove, pepper, and floral hops. Very aromatic! Medium in body and very, very smooth. Taste is sweet and spicy at first with flavors of fresh fruit, mild banana, juicy orange, coriander, and pepper followed by a raw yeastiness, spicy hops, and a touch of lemon. A phenomenal brew that requires you to savor each sip."
"hazy yellow straw color with a big fluffy white head that leaves an incredible lace. smells of hops, mildly sweet malt, yeast, citrus and spice. taste is complex and professionally blended. citrusy, spicy (pepper and corriander?) and sweet bready malty/yeasty. nice and creamy with a tingly like finish. well carbonated and the bubbles just carry it through proper like. easy drink and a true pleasure."
"I've only had a sample glass of this before... I am very glad to finally savour a whole bottle. This is an excellent beer, but likely not for everyone."
"Highly recommended. A very tasty, easy to drink BSPA."
"D-I think this is a very nice beer, but the easiest for me to drink. I like a little more subtleness in such a delicate beer. Either way, this is a true belgian masterpiece that many would love."
"Drinkability - Wonderful bspa. Incredibly drinkable at 8.5%."
"Overall this is a very nice beer that is extremely digestible with such a unique flavor profile."
"I haven't tried to cellar this beer, but I suspect that it is best fresh."
"A blonde ale with a bit of kick to it. Seems rough around the edges to my palate."
"Wow, was this a good one. I bought it based upon it pedigree, and I was not disappointed. Appearance was a nice pale golden color. Smell was decent, possibly would have been better had I used a tulip instead of the Chimay widemouth. Taste was fantastic. Such a well-balanced beer, with a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel was awesome, with that signature Belgian cremere making it super smooth. Drinkability was high, based upon the extraordinary balance."
"Overall: Another excellent offering from Brasserie Dupont. Very sophisticated blond with all the elements coming together to make a remarkable beer. I accidentally bought two of these; oh happy fortune. Definitely recommended."
"A good one to sip ....at 8.5 % this will kick your ass."
"This was a very good brew, and while it probably will not make it into my regular beer rotation, I would buy it again in the future and I would definitely not turn it away if it was offered to me."
"overall a beautifully made beer that i can see having again! light enough for any occasion but still has the guff to stand to the challenge..."
"Mouthfeel is totally not sticky, although the beer tastes kind of sweet. A great beer, which should be drank fresh."
"Not a bad Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Very complex."
"Slick/oily mouthfeel coupled with the overwhelming sensation of bubble-yum bubblegum. Start to finish this is dominated by bubblegum, but towards midsip a bit of black pepper and a touch of alcohol creep in. Truly unique, and appealing, this is a nice BSPA that I could sip all day."
"So easily drinkable too, with the abv not really making much of an impact on the taste. Mellow and warming, this is how I love this style."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer, I may like it more than the Sasion DuPont. I will have to have another to make a good comparison. Would have another anytime."
"11.2oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a cloudy deep gold with a huge head, great longevity and equally great lace. Citrus and peppery aromas with a hint of alcohol aand yeast. Lots of nice caramel malt flavors with just enough hop flavor and bitterness to offset it. Nicely balanced. Somewhat citric and spicy - eathy and yeasty. Very nice."
"Deep gold in color with a sizable fluffy head. Appealing nose of spice and hops. Flavor profile begins with some lemony hop zest coupled with pepper notes. Sort of spicy up front and middle, but then it mellows a bit towards the very end to some nice citrus tones and a subtle yeast aftertaste. Nice supple presence on the palate with a medium full mouthfeel. Drinkability is quite good. This is a pleasure to partake."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle (dated 2004) into a Fantome tulip, the Moinette Blonde was a orangish burnt gold with a slight haze and huge, 3 finger, white head with tiny bubbles. It was slow to recede, with a slight crown remaining until the end. There was also a lot of effervescence throughout the whole bottle. The aroma was mildly spiced, yeast with some brett. sourness and a strong presence of alcohol. The taste followed suit, initially very strong fusals, which gives way honey, floral sweetness, peppery spice, finishing slightly dry with a metallic harshness, not in the rustic farmhouse way that would be enjoyable. The mouthfeel was very carbonated and yeasty, and the alcohol was too dominant (especially for being aged over 2 years) to be that drinkable."
"The beer poured with a fluffy white head on top of a clear gold body. I was expecting a bit of cloudiness. The nose is floral with a bready yeasty background. The taste is excellent; it has so many flavors I can't place them all. There is the floral from the nose, almost lavender, then a sweet citrus, then some pepper, and it ends with a little bitterness. It had very active carbonation giving a dry finish. A very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: Very nice and not too sweet."
"This is an in your face brew. The citrus and spice are intense to say the least. Although it doesnt have the Saison elements that I love in Duponts beers, it is certainly an interesting and flavorful pale ale."
"I see this beer is well-reviewed, but I personally would skip it."
"A classic full-bodied Belgian, leaning towards Saison..."
"Very good, and fun to drink because it felt like you had two or three different beers with the temperature affecting the flavors. I had this about a year ago, and I didn't remember it being this tasty."
"Bottom line: I really like this Belgian Strong Pale Ale and would not hesitate to buy more. To me, this is a Belgian version of Russian River Damnation and that is *all* compliment, baby. :^)"
"A different beer. Cloudy orange, with a thick white head; very sticky. Grainy aroma, some orange, some herbs. It had a sweet orange taste, herbs again (I swear I tasted some thyme), with hops appearing late. A robust beer, very enjoyable. One that I will want to drink again."
"The taste is malty; some grassy, grainy notes in the middle. Also some orange peel and peppery spice. The finish is dry, but the low carbonation and creamy medium body make this overall a smooth, drinkable beer."
"M&D: softly-carbonated, ultra-smooth and rounded, the mouthfeel really helps the overall performance a lot; just like my last bottle consumed a year ago, this one tells a subtle story behind the formidable appearance and cloying nose, tasting fullsome but quite balanced, with a dryish palate of yeasts and bitter hops ensuring high drinkability. All in all, a nicely crafted ale, quite like a Tripel to me."
"Dull gold/ orange murky appearance  white frothy and thick head  nose is of cereals, malts , dough, caramels and smoke  medium grainy body  initial taste is sharp, cereals, malts, and yeasts - aftertaste is medium with a creamy, acidic , and grains"
"Carbonation is strong initially, but settles down. Medium body, very round and fairly smooth. My girlfriend isn't into saison, so I drank the whole thing. I really enjoyed this beer."
"A bit of a strange beer for my tastes, there are moments of greatness, but the overall effect doesn't hold up to my favorites of the belgian strong pale persuasion. Certainly worth a try though."
"This is enjoyable if you're thirsting for an authentic Belgian brew done with the Dupont yeast. Very yummy stuff."
"D = Very very drinkable."
"Stashed away and enjoyed months later, a beautiful, humid summer evening. Great pour with over generous head which stayed ample through the course. Thick lacing. Not quite clear appearance, hazed yellow in colour. A piquant aroma, notes of spice and light 'farmhouse funk' - but nimble. Flavour equally favourable, but again on the softer side. At 8.5% this beer carried enough to keep it interesting, but was nothing overly impressive or elegant. Carbonation stayed unobtrusive to the texture. Improved as it warmed. A very nice Saison, or tripel, or Belgian Ale, or whatever it is! Recommended, I would have been more than happy to finish off another 750ml bottle all to myself!"
"The Whole Foods Market should be commended for carrying this as well as a fantastic array of great ales."
"Ultra-refreshing, and with only subtle alcohol presence. Moinette has nothing but greatness to offer, and is the perfect example of why Belgian beer is held is such high regard."
"This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a frothy white head that holds and laces well. It smells yeasty with fruity aromas of bananas lined with some smells of spices. The taste again hits you at first with a yeasty flavor. There is also similar spice and frutiness as found in the aroma. The mouthfeel is full bodied with great conditioning. Overall, highly drinkable a good belgian."
"Hoppiness throughout!"
"Drinkability: A little heavy at 8.5%, this beer will wear you down."
"Powdery and dry on the mouth, the bitterness and semisweet nature of this beer keep the drinkability much less than this breweries ceaselessly schwillable Saison Dupont."
"Carbonation bursts in the mouth with green grapes, cloves, lime skins, starfruit, and new whole wheat sourdough starter that's not yet ripe. This golden ale has a minerally aftertaste like calistoga mineral water, and a little sour twang like fresh whey. There's an oceanic backbone to this as I have images of smelling sea breezes, and the yeast is really strong with a seaweed flavor."
"I think this beer would make a great session beer. However, it is slightly high in alcohol, so too many glasses might become a slight problem. This is a very good beer. I will definately have it again."
"D: I'm going to need to give this beer another shot. I really wasn't a huge fan at all."
"Overall - A top notch pale ale.... Recommended..."
"Mildly hoppy flavor with hints of orange and clove... bitter on the backend. Very good."
"Exceptionally drinkable. Non-craft brew drinkers who haven't tried Belgian beer might like this. Well worth a try and certainly worth having several in stock on a continual basis. Reminds me of New Glarus' Spotted Cow except more complex and significantly better."
"330 ml bottle. Moinette pours out a cloudy yellow color topped with a long lasting, huge, white head. The aroma is honey and herbal hops. There is also some tartness in the aroma. The flavor is malty, more so than I expected from the aroma. Sweet and tart, with farmhouse style funkiness. There is a strong herbal hoppiness. Like Saison Dupont, this is hoppier than most Saisons. A vanilla flavor comes out as the beer warms. Finishes dry. The mouthfeel is creamy. No sign of the 8.5 abv. A terrific beer."
"Color is a bright gold, mildly hazy. Head is white and wispy, a full 3/4 inch high with slow dissipation, clinging to leave a nice lace on the glass. Smell is lemony and spicy, with notes of clove and tangy hops. The nose overall lacks potency though. The flavor is strong on malt, a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests. Notes of citrus at first, with a light bready spice in the finish. A touch of sourness lasts beyond the finish also. Medium body, very creamy mouthfeel with enjoyable bubbly carbonation. Not overly complex, the flavor is nonethelss excellent. I couldn't believe the alcohol was 8.5% as I hardly noticed it. This was highly drinkable and I will have more..."
"I probably sell 12 to 15 cases of this a year just by my love for this brew. This was my first belgian ale and it made a massive impression on me from the very first sip. I remember about half way through the bottle I commented to my friend that this was the best beer I've ever tasted even though I'd probably only had a dozen beers under my belt. Now that I've sample well over 300 beers this is still the ONE !!!"
"Large bottle, caged and corked. Cork says 2004. Pours with active, but not out of control carbonation, light straw in color, with some floating sediment, a large, white,puffy and long lasting head, leaving lovely sticky and well spread out, thick lacing. Nose is floral and spicy. This is a heady, tasty and satisfying Belgian, notes of pepper, vanilla, spicy hops and honey. Yeasty, cloudy , nutty late pour. Smooth mouthfeel, just a great beer all around, bring on the spicy food, salads, and/or BBQ ! Another great saison from Dupont."
"Santé"
"drinkability: fantastic, highly drinkable. we have a winner here. begs to be drank with a fine meal, but i'm enjoying it on it's own right now."
"Gold clarity with an enormous head. Wonderful, distinctly Dupont aroma, full of esters loads of fruit and farmhouse funk. Flavor is amazing, with loads of fruit and farmhouse. It's the house character of Dupont which makes this so special. Dupont is a very special brewery. I love them."
"I just picked up this bottle the other day at the Foodery in Philly. The beer poured a hazy golden color with a thick, crispy white head. The aroma is a citrusy and a bit sweet. The taste is a balance of sweet and tart, a bit earthy and a little bit of a spicy/hoppy bite on the backend. Nice representation of the saison style, as all Dupont beers are. Ringing in at 8.5% abv, this is a deceiving beer. I enjoy this beer and find it pretty drinkable despite the high abv."
"True to style, this beer greets us with a big-time, frothy head, along with a hazy medium gold body. The nose is sweet and tart... in other words, ""Saison-y."" I find the flavor profile to be a bit surprisingly on the light side. Bitterness arrives mid-palate and jockeys with sweet malt into a pleasantly long finish that is semi-tart and partly astringent. There's some alcohol warmth going on here as well, although that doesn't hamper this beer's easy drinkability."
"Lots of carbonation give it a lively mouthfeel, but there is enough body to keep it from being too scratchy. Very enjoyable and it pairs well with a plate of edam and swiss."
"This saison is not too bold as others I've had in the past. Having said that, it maintains all complexities of those that tend to be more ""in your face," but it does so with a delicate touch."
"Like the label states on the back, its a bit fuller and sweeter than its cousin beer (which I assume means the Dupont). This works well and would be a great beer with some good grub."
"Opinion: Wow, now this is a really tasty beer! I am pretty surprised how the brewer got such a contrast in the hops. I was expecting a harsh, astringent and bitter finish by the middle of the profile, but the malt ends up winning in the end. Amazing! This is a great beer, and one that I will definitely be drinking quite a bit in the future."
"Hazy golden amber. Active carbonation. Frothy meringue-like white head with sticky lacing. Apples, moistened leather, horsebarn hay, cilantro, and a faintly sweet bready malt aroma. Dry, spicy, grassy. Saaz hops with horsey-funk and apple-fruity sweetness. Tart and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is superb -- sparkling and dry, yet juicy and quenching. Quite nice, quite nice. High marks for drinkability, but there are just so many damn-fine saisons out there, and others rank higher for me. Nonetheless, this is surely a world class representative of the style. Outstanding beer from Dupont."
"This beer is good. Apparently, it has won several awards, and rightfully so. I dont know if I would drink this one on a regular basis, but it would be nice to go to every now and then. It comes in 330ml (or 11.2 oz.) as do many belgians. Good bottles for homebrew."
"Last swigs: Wow! 8.5 % ABV? Ya gotta be jokin'. $7.20 from circle liquors. It's a 2003 cork in 2006. sweet!"
"BB 09-2007. Good nice snowwhite thick head and a golden beer with white clouwd. Taste is very strong and shows lots of alcohol. Dry, grassy, wheaty and very spiced are the main impressions but this one shows further lots of spice with sweet gale, hops and probaly many others. Yes this is a great beer though maybe litle bombastic and highly fuelled for the beertype as I see it more of a saison then a Blonde beer as it off course also is. Highly enjoyable brew that I certainly see again soon, great to just sit sip and enjoy."
"Drinkability- As said before. Something needed to complete this beer. As it is...just blah."
"One thing that I notice is the beer is hot. A very noticeable phenol taste. More then I expected from a 8.5% beer. Really reminds me of wine and even has a white grape essence to it. The body is in the mid range and the taste is smooth but dry. Overall a decent beer."
"Alcohol is hidden nicely. Be careful"
"A wonderful beer. This is one of those beers that keeps me going back to Belgain Pale Ales."
"It should be fairly obvious by now that I think a lot of Moinette Blond. I really have nothing else to add, except to say that I can't wait to see (and to drink) what else Brasserie Dupont has to offer."
"Pours a thick yellowed peach hue and makes a dense white head with lots of lacing. Aroma is a musty banana with a subtle hint of cloves. Flavor opens with some bittering and a peppery spice, yeasty banana character dominates the middle and there is a bit of buttery toffee, finishes with a strong peppery bite. Lots of carbonation on the palate with a medium to fully body and a slightly sticky finish. This is a nice offering, it seems to deviate a bit from what I am used to in a Belgian strong pale with the extreme peppery spice, but I like it. I would try again, but sadly I have but this 1 bottle."
"Purchased a single 330ml bottle at central market. Pours a deep, cloudy golden color with an off-white head that is indefatigable. Very sweet/spicy nose, with hints of apple cider and coriander, and light toffee undertone. Taste is saisonish with spices and a cashew-yeast flavor supporting the fermented-apple hoppyness and the spicy-sweet crispness of this ale. The mouthfeel is a bit oily and smooth but well-carbonated. This ale coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. An excellent summer ale, but I wouldn't recommend more than one or two of these babies in the Texas sun. Overall, a good belgian strong pale."
"Bottle (courtesy of Presario): Poured an hazy blonde color ale with a super huge foamy white head with perfect retention. Aroma of funky yeast and coriander with some floral hops. Taste is sweet with some nice farmhouse feel to it, mix of coriander and wheat is well done. Alcohol is extremely well hidden (I thought I was drinking a 6% beer) and body is just above average. Truly a wonderful triple just the way I love them."
"Bottle from my wife for my birthday! Here goes... nice milky-yellow haze in the glass, though not as disgusting as that sounds. Smells strong of a wild yeast brew, kind of tangy and sour. Taste is good strong Belgian ale - heavy malt and high gravity. There is a sourness to this beer though that I don't care for too much. Kind of like Cantillon only not as pronounced. Mouthfeel is nice, lots of bubble but not overly tingly/sharp. This is a good brew, but the sourness will keep me away."
"330 ml bottle."
"Mouthfeel is lush and creamy, but the sharp end in the flavor profile keeps it from being really drinkable."
"Enjoy."
"The little blond nun makes me feel good with this beer. Aroma opens with thoughts of home, a wood stove and baking apples in the oven. Very nice. It pours delicately with a straight up yellow appearance reminiscent of drying straw. It's initial taste is pleasant but with strong alcohol (remember it is 8.5% - yikes) with wheatiness. It's big but still leaves room for food. Finish is hops. I'd like more in the mouth but due to its strength it's quite amazing the beer feels so light. Goes down easy and wakes up groggy."
"Nice light-medium body that made it quite drinkable even at 8.5% alcohol."
"Poured into a tall tulip glass from an 11.2 oz bottle. Cloudy straw-gold color with a thin white layer of foam. Sweet malt scent, a little buttery. Lot of spicy phenols right up front on first taste, fruity, fairly yeasty. Enough hops to dry things out, but hop flavor isn't much present. Finish lingers around for a while. Lots of carbonation, but somewhat light body for the strength of the beer. Very nice mouthfeel. Very nice!"
"Drinkability: Terrific and a bit offbeat -- impress geeks and newbies alike. Not too expensive, either. Much to like from this saison/pale... whatever. Try it, you'll like it."
"This beer was part of the brasserie dupont/vanberg and dewulf beer dinner at monks on may 10th. Moinette literally means ""little nun"" - a play on not paying service to an abbaye... it's aroma opens with a reminder of baked apple and was poured a pale yellow straw color with very little head retention. However, each refill [from a pitcher] poured more carbonated and with a better layer of disappearing foam. Tasting notes included notions of high alcohol, a light body [wheaty?]...a great and enjoyable beer who's mouthfeel is thin but amply big in flavor. Drinkability? Extremely high...but watch out. At 8.5%, you'd better watch out for the little nun's sneak attack."
"A pitted, crinkly head of pure white foam, consisting of perfectly round and uniform spheres, fills half the goblet on the pour. This is just really nice to watch, as it subsides to a quarter-inch collar and clings soapily atop its brilliant, banana-yellow liquid. In the sun, the beer absolutely shimmers with golden highlights, with no sediment to be seen. Floral nosefeel is spot-on for style, if slightly thin overall. Flowery and stemlike smells waft from the goblet, warming to become more rustic and raw, as of straw bales and wet hair. The flavors are anything but delicate, though: the bitterness is almost shocking, even for the style; fierce green peppercorn and thyme drying out over a mineral/limestone base. Still, there is a ricey malt character to be found in here somewhere. Mouthfeel is strangely sudsy considering the lack of visible carbonation. The biting bitterness lasts for ages in the aftertaste and sort of impedes the drinkability. My tastebuds are getting blasted... this is no table beer. Very muscular even for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but certainly worth a try."
"Overall: very enjoyable beer from Dupont. Not as good as Duvel in the strong pale ale category, but very close IMO. My 3rd Dupont brew, they have all been high quality, much props to them."
"Drinkability and Overall: What a nice beer. Truly a treat to enjoy, and I enjoyed it heartily. Quite taste, and quite drinkable. Definitly one to try."
"Overall Impression: Wow. Impressive Belgian beer. Complex, well crafted, tasty. Cant seem to make complete sentences. The alcohol stepped right on top of me, Im a bit numb after a half glass, but I never saw it coming. This has farmhouse characteristics, but uptown refinement. I guess it is the farmhouse qualities that make this a BSPA rather than a Tripel with which I think it shares many qualities. Should be paired with a fine meal or snack rather than on its own. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"This well-hopped, spicy Belgian pale ale was an excellent pairing with a dinner of grilled beef, potatoes and seasoned squashes. Seductively drinkable and able to hold its own when paired with seasoned foods. I've developed a real liking for the creations from Brasserie Dupont and Moinette Blond is no exception. Well worth the money."
"Tall crispy white merengue forms over honey-colored liquid. The aromas are heady and sweet, steeped in grassy herbs, butter, mashed nuts and ripe pears. I had prepared for something sweeter in taste. While this is not as astringently hopped as this brewery's famous Saison, it is quite dry. Big, broad, aerated chunks of dry biscuit flavors are seasoned with roasted yellow resins and a fleeting, white-fleshed fruitiness. Stony earthiness lingers before succumbing to finishing flavors of bitter, raw nutshells. Nicely framed bitterness. One of the driest 8.5% beers I've ever tasted. I plowed through this 750ml. Time for some scordalia."
"Tastes big and wicked and funky. As funky a Belgian Strong Pale Ale as I've ever had. Like a sweeter saison, sort of. It still has the larger hop presence and general funkiness that I'm used to from a saison, but with a greater sweetness. I dig it... It's amazing how the aroma hints at lemon and spice and fruit, but the taste is all grassiness and barnyard funk."
"Hazy golden-orange color with a thick, chunky off-white head. The aroma is hebal and floral, spicy, peppery and somewhat honeyish. A very nice aroma. The flavor is yeasty and spicy, with an herbal, phenolic taste. Very drying and somewhat alcoholic. It is medium-full in body. A very good brew."
"On tap at Monk's, this beer is served in a tulip. Its body has a peach-golden color, and a tight head of an inch has average retention. Active carbonation. The initial smells are of spicy phenols; pepper and sharp citrus or corriander. Below these lingers a muted funk smell, somewhat moldy, somewhat lactic. The taste is very clean. It first hits with a dry sweetness and some sharp sour citrus notes of lemon, maybe ginger. These quickly back off as the spiciness shows. Finally, the taste and aroma of hops wrap the ending together and give a long satisfying aftertaste. The sweet/sour/spicy/hoppy combination is wonderfully complex and quite enjoyable. Easy to drink, easy to love. A great beer from DuPont."
"I could easily drink a lot more of the bottle than I should in one go..."
"750mL: Shining golden hue, dense Dupont style white head with gorgeous lacing. Big yeast clouds float around the glass. Delectable pilsner malt nose with honey tones. Crisp cookie reminiscent toasty and floral flavours. Rather complex if not demarcative. Creamy and fluffy mouthfeel, not quite bubbly though. Sweet mouth entrance is accompanied by a white peppery yeast atmosphere. This pilsner malt puts the crisp in crispy, saazy finish provides a good bitterness with a bit more ironoxide than Id like. Characterful, herbal, Dupont quality mark."
"Lovely, I mean it."
"Creamy easy drink. Some barnyard-like yeast there but easier smoother drink than their Saisons. Satisfying. Pure Belgium, with apricot and lemon, medium mouthfeel. Nice blond white and lacing. Peppery, not too sour nor sweet, more malty and vanilla, some nutmeg. perhaps shelved long?"
"Bright lemon-orange body, abundant carbonation, and large frothy white head. Nice, fresh yeasty aroma of bread, esters, and apples. Crisp and tangy with significant bitterness in the finish. Alcohol taste is apparent. A nice, interesting Belgian Strong Pale."
"Damn this beer has a bite to it! Dry and bittersweet fruitiness. Alcohol flavors. A strident bitterness but not form hops as far as I can tell. Can't put my finger on that taste but it dominates the palate. Almost like Campari? Juniper berries? Spicy clove in there. taste is nothing like the smell. Amazing complexity. Bitter and smooth. Sweet in the nose and dry on the tongue. really excellent. Could have stood to be aged and I really wasn't expecting that from this brew. Lingering dry btterness stays around forever.Been wanting to try this for awhile and it has definitely peaked my interest to go back for more."
"This is the definition of drinkability."
"Pours a very clear gold color. It is well carbonated and the bubbles that dance through my beer support a thick off-white head. The nose is spicy and aromatic with notes of grass, grain, alcohol, lemon, and coriander. The taste is lightly sweet up front, and is followed by a sharp astringency and a bitterness in the finish. This beer is medium-light on the palate. There is some spiciness her, though it is not as complex as the Saison Dupont. My tongue picks up a certain lemony acidity that makes this beer quite refreshing. There is a nice fruity yeast character, and some simple straight-forward malted grain notes. This beer picks up more sweetness in the finish as it warms up and loses its carbonation. Overall this is quite a tasty brew, though I must admit that I prefer the Saison Dupont."
"From a 750 ml caged and corked bottle, it's a vibrant gold with an immense white head that ends up looking like the top of a laundry load. The smell is nicely fruity, most noticeably apricot. Just a bit of bitterness balances the dry fruitiness. The taste of Belgian yeast is comforting, especially near the end of the bottle. The mouthfeel is nice, and it goes down well for an 8.5% beer."
"Very creamy head on a nice hazy orange color body with some glittering reflects. The smell is nice, yeasty, highly citric, with some peaches, maybe some anice cookies. Grassy apple juice and figs. The taste is sweet and strong apple cider, with hints of sourness. Alcohol is fairly noticeable. Very full and round mouthfeel. Strong and enjoyable."
"I could open one after another of these incredible beers!"
"After pouring carefully, take a few minutes to bask in the gorgeous golden glow of this glorious beer. The thick head gradually dissipates leaving a permanent film over the hazy beer and lovingly laces the glass. The room fills with a fresh, floral aroma. The first taste is so... complex. Malts, hops, and spices all distinct yet experienced simultaneously. Alcohol is present, but welcome. This beer pairs well with patience. Be sure to drink with enough time to truly appreciate all this wonderful brew has to offer."
"11.2oz bottle with rust around the crown but when I pop the cap let's out a big gasp of carbonation, so I think it was sealed properly. Either way got the bottle on the discount shelf at D's sixpack for 1.99 not bad, eh? Appearance: Huge four fingers worth of white froth bubbly white head leaves fine evenly patterend Belgian style lace, the body glows a golden amber blonde tone very nice. Aroma: Tart apples grassy semi sweet notes mild alcohol phenols some slight funky musty notes and seems cidery in nature. Taste: This is the questionable aspect big musty horse blanket notes sediment layers lie in the bottom of the glass tart apple notes funky yeast pale sweet malt tone hoppy finish for a Belgian not bad. Mouthfeel: Medium body fine bubbly champagne like carbonation. Drinkability: I could definitely partake in this brew again preferrably a bigger bottle, oh yeah."
"Head is huge and even, but with a very uneven, slow collapse. The beer is almost clear, gold, with an orange tinge and a dark yeast pour. Lacing is sticky, but not copious. Wow... some major schpoonck on the cork pop. Citrus, spice and some sugar. Bananas in the front with alcohol and spice. Foamy, smooth mouth in the sweetish, fruity middle. A little butter. Finishes nice and bitter, dry wine-like, alcohol and tangy fruit. This seems to be apples as I reflect. There's a very bitter/sour aftertaste that's almost overwhelming, and certainly distracting. The alcohol is not all that well hidden, though it tames with temperature."
"I tried this the other day at my friend Dave's house from a fresh 750ml green glass bottle. I had loved the Moinette Rouge/Bruin that we had on tap at the Bier Circus in Brussels, so I thought that this would be good too...and it is. A slightly cloudy golden brew with a nice cap of white foam that lasts and provides excellent lacing. The aromas are of spicy (slightly skunked) herbal/medicinal hops, belgian candy sugar, yeast, and some nice light biscuit-like malts. The taste is suprisingly hoppy for a Belgian, with the interesting herbal/medicinal hopping running the show. The middle reveals the nice biscuity malt flavors, and in the finish, the hops reappear. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and full-bodied and the drinkability is very good for a stronger beer (8.5%abv). Recommended!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden peachy hue with a big off white head. Spicy green apple aroma mixed withe the barnyard funk you'd expect from a unfiltered Farmhouse-style. Sweet initially on the palate moving towards a drier, fruitier finish at the end. A bit peppery and spritzy the whole way troughout the experience. Very good stuff."
"Overall: An exceptionally good Pale Ale that has many of the better traits from the other artisanal Dupont beers, most notably the Saison. Highly Impressive, this one should be sought out!"
"Pours a light clear golden color with a MASSIVE head. This bottle was a gusher for some reason. I warmed this bottle up for a bit and when I popped the top, it just came out non-stop for nearly a minute. Still after it calmed down and I poured it, the head was unbelievable. The aroma consists of a strong sweet yeasty smell with fruit, spices, and hops in the mix as well. The head is still there and has barely dissipated. The taste starts with a light yeast, very pronounced spicing that is rises above all the other characteristics, somewhere in there is some fruitiness and tapers into a warming alcohol. This is a light to medium bodied beer that finishes slightly sweet and again very spicy. I have mixed feelings about this beer as I feel the spicing is a bit over-the-top, but I can't help but be attracted to it. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Very similar to the Saison yet more golden than glowing orange in color-lots of yeast bits about. Super rocky in the head dept.-like the Saison, and the head stays throughout the journey as does a nice clumpy stick. Very hoppy, in a spicy, citrusy way both in the aroma and flavor. Snappy and somewhat peppery, this beer is highly refreshing and very drinkable. All this while the beer exhibits a definate sweet malt component that is hidden way in the backgroud, just as the abv is hidden. I think of this as a Saison at Mach speed."
"Better balanced than some other Saisons I have tried. Still not my cup of beer. Too much bite and not enough charcter to back it up."
"Pours a lighter golden color with a huge fluffy/sticky head,aroma was spicey and citruisy and lightly grassy.The taste is lemony with some pepper notes some yeastiness in there as well,very refreshing tasting.For the alcohol content this is very easy to drink,I really like this beer I have to say."
"I paid $4.50 an 11.2 oz bottle in Omaha."
"Blonde-orange color with a meringue-like head that imparts huge rings of lace down the glass. Truly a sight to behold. Nose is spicy and herbal with notes of earthy hops, pear and green apples. A melon aroma even appears as the brew warms. Taste is a magnificent melding of herbal earthiness, ripe pear, vaguely tart apple, honey, and a minor hop twang on the finish. Full-bodied and palate-coating, the mouthfeel is effervescent yet subdued. Truly artisanal as the 8.5% abv is never really an issue. Drinks incredibly easily. Certainly one of Dupont's top offerings."
"This beer poured into the glass banana colored and it had a slight cloud/haze to it and when held to the light, carbonation was present. The head that was produced was white in color and had good retention (about half glass) then fell to a film and a ring on the sides of the glass. It had the consistency of thick dense foam. With this pillow of foam sitting on the top it produced a delicate lace that stretched down the glass. The aromas that I nosed were of lots of spices (pepper, cilantro, clove), hops, fruit, and malt. Complex nose from this beer. The flavors that I tasted were of rich malt, fruit (green apple, pear), lots of spices and herbs, floral hops, some yeasty notes, and a hint of alcohol as it warmed. Finished alittle dry, alittle sweet, alittle bitter (all through the tasting), and very satisfying. Medium bodied. Great complexity and combination of flavors and smells. A real good beer and glad I had the opportunity to try. Will search out again."
"A great saison, in fact take anything by Dupont on your next picnic. I'm happy I did."
"Nice bold golden body. The good white soupy head is less exuberant than many similar Belgians since it is easily controlled and it fades incompletely, but it has exellent lacing. Good fruitiness, mild spiciness, good crisp maltiness. Slightly bitter finish lingers."
"An indistinct grapefruit yellow color on the pour, the head modest is size, spumous in texture, the color a bright white, after the erosion has taken place, a thin sheet of lace covers the glass. Malt dominates the nose, somewhat tart, also quite clean and fresh with the start sweet, but the tartness hits you at the skeletal top. Finish is spiteful in its bitterness; astringent, dry aftertaste, drinkable but Ive had much better."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a magnificently pillowy creamy white head that lasts almost forever and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of white lace. An absolutely beautiful beer. Nose is fruity and spicy with notes of clove, pepper, and floral hops. Very aromatic! Medium in body and very, very smooth. Taste is sweet and spicy at first with flavors of fresh fruit, mild banana, juicy orange, coriander, and pepper followed by a raw yeastiness, spicy hops, and a touch of lemon. A phenomenal brew that requires you to savor each sip."
"Second review 21 February 04 - 250 ml green bottle"
"Cloudy light yellow-orange in color, huge foamy off white head of tiny tight bubbles that cling to my glass. Fruity spicy aromas, fruit sweet malty and yeasty flavors, medium-full body nice full and creamy mouthfeel, spicy and some what sour finish, balanced."
"This is an excellent Belgian ale. The taste is fresh and enjoyable. I have had this one several times and I enjoy it more each time. I prefer the 750ml bottle over the 12oz bottle. The larger bottle allows for more action from the yeast during bottle fermentation and the large space allows for the beer to mature more effectively. The flavor is fruity with a bite. The nose is very satisfactory. This beer poured a head like shaving cream thick and creamy with a distinct hoppiness and bitterness to the foam. Takes quite a bit to settle too. I find this to be a well balanced beer and I highly recommend it as an example of fine Belgian brewing."
"Good stuff, overall."
"Good head, thin and white, even if a little compact. The smell is floreal, that explodes in the nose, fresh and delicate. The smell is somewhat different from the expectation, stronger and compact, white a note of bitter."
"Notes: A killer Saison, the dreamy flavours nearly numbs the senses of the taste buds. A prize brew to be had and one I will make sure to have around."
"Golden in hue with a slight haze, topped by a dense, porcelain white head that rises, peaks, then slowly settles.  Attractive, textured lace is left in its wake. Pungently sweet citrus fruity esters along with peppery alcohol hit the nose at first, then malt becomes more prominent and asserts itself aromawise as dryish, white bread like graininess.  Mellow clove and mild mineral notes round the aroma out.  A bittersweet combination of candyish sweetness and black pepper like alcohol is perceived at first in flavor, then is ensued by a melange of clove phenol, vodka soaked semi sweet ripe orange fruit and bready grain similar to that of the aroma.  Surprisingly mild in esters for style.  Contrasting bitterness is supplied both by mild hops and ethyl alcohol flavor.  Overall sweetness is mild, and is mostly derived from residual sugars, not caramel malt.  Spicy alcohol couples with the light sweetness to lend a black licorice undertone to this brew.  Deceivingly light in body, w/ a quasi crisp, quenching mouthfeel that helps lend excellent drinkability considering the strength.  Finishes dry, w/ prickly, yet pleasant alcohol tickling the tongue. Moinette Blond is a very flavorful and somewhat raw Belgian strong that manages to integrate ethanol flavors with sweet fruitiness.  It's dry all around, delcious, and certainly another unique Belgian worthy of a serious tasting.  My bottle's cork indicates a 2000 bottling."
"I forgot how much I love this one. Barnyard nose, yum. Nice Belgian pale malt flavor, rind-link hops, definitive farmhouse charactaristics. Oh so good."
"Beautiful head and carbonation, a good stiff inch of stiff foam.  Paler, hazy gold color.  Grapey, winey aroma, acid cut to the nose.  A bit of true bitter to the flavor, like a Scots Whisky compared to a Bourbon's sweetness, with a decided hoppy close of citrus.  Maybe a little less dry than the Saison, but bolder in flavor.  Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is very well controlled.  A little more sweetness is in order for me, though I'm sure this brew has its fans."
"As much as I like Saison Dupont, I may like the blonde Moinette even more.  With its higher 8.5% abv (as opposed to the saison's 6.5%), I view it as a sipping version of the saison.  A number of Belgian brewers seem to make a stronger version of their ""normal"" beer -- Rodenbach and de Koninck come to mind.  Similar to the saison in appearance, nose, palate and mouthfeel, Moinette boasts just a little bit more of everything."
"A smooth and powerful blond coloured beer. Mild banana and clove in the taste. Dry and crisp with a steady sweetness and raw peppery hop notes (from dry hopping). Delicious."
