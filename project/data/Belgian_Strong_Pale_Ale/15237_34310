Sweet fruits, leaning towards peach and pear flavors and a mild malt backbone. Faint spicing. Fairly mild flavored for the body and appearance. Flavors opened up and became more interesting as it warmed. Pleasant and somewhat different flavor for a BSPA. I will definitely buy this again","LiquidAmber","Mar 05, 2012"

The nose is very unique and hard to pin down. I'm getting sweet and sour notes with hints of orange peel, caramel, grass, and a touch of clove. As it warmed it really opened up. Very complex, spicy taste with hints of butterscotch, caramel, orange peel, lemon, apricots and alcohol. As with the nose, the taste really morphs as it warms. Slightly boozy, but it doesn't really hurt the drinkability. The finish is crisp and dry with a nice tangy, bitter bite. Headed to the O.B.E.R.

My overall impression is of a well-made, imaginative beer that explores some new ground and does it quite well. However, I’m thinking this is not a good beer for aging in that with the eventual fading of the hop bitterness, what will remain is the sweetness. While it is a complex sweetness, if there isn’t a bit of bitterness to “terminate” it at the end the sweetness will probably be cloying.","drtth","Feb 24, 2011"

4.45,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"330ml, BBE 12/2014. Cap removal instantly releases bottle-trapped hoppy aroma. Everything less volatile than that goes into Karmeliet glass. Pouring produces half an inch thick bubbly white head that collapses creating a soapy film atop of murky pale yellow-orange fluid. Aromas are mostly hops followed by citruses, yeast and refined cane sugar with a touch of honey. Yeasty flavor with soft sweet malt supported hops and citruses creating an illusion of grapefruit sensation. Lots of hops in here resulting in long lingering bitterish aftertaste. I couldn't put my finger at any particular spice - this brew is all about quest for bitter-sour balance where hoppy bitterness always prevails over citrusy sourness, but that might change with time as the hops will lose aroma, flavor and bitterness as they age. The medium bodied beer is soft on the palate as its carbonation is bridled by viscous fluid. Absence of visible yeasty particles that Reserva abounds with and pronounced hoppiness separate regular Tsjeeses from his barreled brother. Oh, I didn't mention alcohol.

As a Belgian strong pale ale, it is somewhere between a Belgian strong ale and a tripel. Almost makes me think of a blend of Maudite and La Fin du Monde--though it's more mellow than each of those.

4.2,5,4,4,4,5,4.5," Body is light and airy, yet not foamy - it's just perfect to convey the myriad flavors held within the beer. Even though this is billed as a 10% winter ale, it goes down very easily, and is a pleasant change from the usual slate of dark, over-spiced holiday ales.","ElGordo","Dec 26, 2008"

4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Rusty orange color, tan foam initially that fades to a skim later on. Tiny dark suspended particles. Candied fruit and alcohol in the aroma, which can be overlooked as a "Belgian X-Mas Ale". Strong rich flavors, caramel, stewed fruit, very mild spice level. Alcohol seems to be lurking at the edges, reinforcing that this is a slow sipper. Dry finish with lingering fruit in the aftertaste. Some vegetal hop character that I can't really endorse or veto, it reminded me of a homebrew I had once, but not in an amateur sense at all. One and done, this was worth a try.","emerge077","Dec 25, 2008"
4.15,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a fully clouded brown hued orange. Thin white head. Nose is a touch of honey, melon, sugar, and sweet tones. Flavor bring a thick level of spices, sweet tones, and a bit of honey. But the sweetest side rides highest here. Feel is pretty smooth on the liquid and fairly low on the carbonation. This is a nice ale, but if you don't like the sweeter Belgian ales, you probably won't be able to appreciate this as much.","RblWthACoz","Dec 23, 2008"
4.12,3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Fine and dandy full bodied with big carbonation that matches the style nicely. Good alcohol bite on the finish. Middle is all fruit and spice. Cherry, berry, and citrus make for a pecuilar combination. Tingles on the toungue. A great christmas treat.","mcallister","Dec 23, 2008"
4.3,7.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some bannanas, licorice, coriander, clove. The taste is malty/yeasty, slightly sweet, with some bannana/licorice notes, with some spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, quite different.","Wasatch","Dec 22, 2008"
3.67,-8.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I picked up an 11.2oz bottle at Champane's in Warren for $6.99 (never seen it anywhere else to date). The label shows a stoned guy in a Santa hat, it couldn't be Jesus, there's no way it's a picture of a stoned Jesus, but with the name "Tsjeeses" I'm starting to think it's Jesus after all. The beer is completely hazed dark orange color, lots of sediment on the bottom. It might have been less hazy if I didn't pour it all in one go. The head was composed of big bubbles and receded within 30 seconds. The smell is very Belgian, with sweet candy, yeasty esters, and some cough syrup. It reminds me a little of Carolus brews' aromas. The taste is sweet and a little alcoholic, lots of fruits in the after-taste. The bottle claims spices, herbs, and noble hops, but I couldn't pinpoint any spices with accuracy. Mostly this is a strong pale ale, very Belgian in character, not the spiced christmas beer as I was expecting. The body is very thick and syrupy, and combined with the evident ABV this is a sipper. Final judgment = good beer, too expensive though.","TurdFurgison","Dec 22, 2008"
4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall pretty good beer. Hazy cider color with an unappealing suspension of yeast particulate (guess I overpoured it). Fairly prominent foamy head. Smells of tart fruit and spices. Tastes more of the same - apple, grape, honey. Mouthfeel is fairly thick but ample soft carbonation prevents this from being syrupy. Pretty good drinkability factor on this one despite the ABV. My biggest knock is the exorbitant $9 I spent for this bottle. This will be a once a year treat for me.","waltonc","Dec 22, 2008"

In fact it's so good, that I'm not going to bother disceting further and just enjoy. ABV is well hidden. Unique for a Noel, I dig the fact that it's a pale and not overly spiced. They could have called this a Belgian IPA and it would be a standout in the category. Still, like most De Struise offerings, it's over-priced, but on the lower end of their spectrum at least.","ccrida","Dec 18, 2008"
3.85,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"After a careful not to disturb the sediment pour.But with just enough umph to try and get maximum head, I get no head. Just a little quick foam in my Goose Island wine glass. Lovely nectar of life colored amber with quite a bit of suspension in their too. Can't see any bubling though. Very yeasty fruits in the nose with a little swirl. Some mangoey like hop characteristcs swirl around their as well. Tropical fruits abound at the forefront of the taste of this beer. The finish is a little dry and bitter. Some of those Brewers' Gold hops shining through I suppose. Long, yeasty linger after each sip too. Dry, fruity palated beer with a bit of chewyness.","scruffwhor","Dec 17, 2008"
4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice orange golden with big fluffy white head that disovles. Smells of yeast, orange, ginger? other spices. Tastes of citrus, little alc. noted. Nice balance.

STUNNING.","Crosling","0"
4.07,1.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"I don't like my Christmas Ales overly spicy, so that's probably why I enjoyed this beer so much. The only thing that hurts this beer is the price. It was expensive on draft and it's expensive in a bottle. You don't much for your money. Is it worth the hefty price tag? Yeah, I would say that's it worth a shot if you can find it. This beer would make for a great Christmas treat.","AltBock","Dec 11, 2008"
4.28,7,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"T/M: Nicely carbonated. Very smooth and slick with a hinth of prickliness. Taste is similar to the nose with lots of honey and nutmeg, cinnamon, orangepeel, fading to a nice malty sweetness and then a bready ness. Finish has some hops coming through.","ejquin","Dec 07, 2008"
3.49,-12.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Tsjeeses pours an awkward orangey, brown ruby burgundy color, thick with small suspended floats and a small peachy white head. Very winey in the nose, grape skin, green apple, orange peel, fresh earthy hops, sweet alcohol soaked grain and evergreen. Alcohol heat is pretty pronounced in this one, but it also allows the herbal, leafy hop character to take center stage, it too becomes dominant, shoving the malts into the passenger seat. Subtle wintery pepper spice and estery yeast is not over done, but i wish the sweetness of the malts was more apparent. Tsjeeses is a sipper for sure and most definitely a holiday treat, i still felt yearning for more of a 'wow factor' after the 9$ glass was through.","ATPete","Nov 24, 2008"

4.17,4.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle from the Bayou. Pours out a cloudy orange color with a small white head. A very nice aroma of apples, some spices, and a lot of woody notes. The taste was very nice; sort of a warm and mellow brew, citrus flavors, apples, a dry yeasty flavor full of mellow barrel aged aspects. Very enjoyable. As it warmed it was much more flavorful and fruity. Drink it at 12 degrees maybe more. A fizzy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable.","Douglas88","Nov 10, 2008"

4.04,1,3,4,4,5,4,"Bottle. Pours hazy orange with an average, fizzy, off-white head, somewhat lasting with fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (bread, cookie, biscuit), light hops (flowers), heavy yeast (barnyard, earth) with notes of apple, pear, and honey. Full bodied, creamy texture, lively carbonation, and a chalky finish. Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness.","BeerandBlues2","Jun 12, 2008"

2.83,-29.3,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Taste is brrrr.. oxidized, cardboard whiffs. I have to be strong. Underneath here is a good beer, or need I say was? Very spicy with bitter orange zest and other bitter spices. Warm alcohol is not helping drinkability. Malt is thin and I suspect a good addition of sugar. This is probably a good beer when fresh, but De Struise Brouwers need to keep an eye on oxidation during brewing.","Absumaster","Feb 01, 2008"
4.03,0.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very nice hazy copper, plenty of sediment, an average size white head recedes to a ring. Aroma is refreshing blend of straw, grass, honey and wheat sweetness a bit of lemon tartness and citrus fruits, some spice as well. Flavor follows with lemon and apple tartness blending nicely with a honey like sweetness, peaches mid taste and lead into the dry grassy hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a bit of weight from the sugars, carbonation is on the lighter side but is somewhat sharp, peppery and dry feel in the finish. A very interesting beer, quite tasty and very well balanced for its strength.","hoppymeal","Jan 01, 2008"
4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle courtesy of fonefan: Poured a deep dirty beige color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention and some great lacing. Aroma of fruity (peach) ester with a spicy peppery yeast. Taste is also a mix between the very nice fruity ester and the peppery yeast with a dry hoppy finish. Body is full with limited filtration and great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Maybe a touch too sweet for my personal tastes but a very good example of the style nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Aug 15, 2007"
4.09,2.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Sampled at the Kierstbierfestival in Essen, Belgium a few weeks back. The beer poured a bronze color into my snifter with a slight off white head. There was a port like nose to the beer, high abv aroma. The taste was pretty hot, alcoholy but not to the point that it was all I got. The taste was also a bit citrusy with some grapefruit and a touch of sweetness as well. A very interesting beer that I am glad I got a chance to try.","ggaughan","Jul 02, 2007"
4.25,6.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"An interesting beer, and definitely an interesting take on a holiday beer; one usually sees heavy, sweeter malt character in these types of beers. The simple malt character is actually quite nice and accentuates a different side of the spices than one usually sees in a holiday beer. At times the spice notes and the fruitiness seem like they should be disparate, but they are not; in fact this beer is quite well integrated, quite complex & most definitely tasty. This beer is really growing on my as I slowly work my way through this 330ml bottle.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
