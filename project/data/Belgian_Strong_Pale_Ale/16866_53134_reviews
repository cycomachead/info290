"Effervescent and a little peppery. Slight citrus. Nice esters. Smooth mouthfeel. Great color and clarity. Head is foamy and effervescent with great lacing."
"It was ok. Taste left me wanting"
""
"Fruity nose, cider, and malt. Pours clear straw under a 3: finely bubbled moussey white foam cap. A very creamy palate with fresh fruit evoking a cider over light malts in the background. Fairly dry with a hop accent on the finish. Its effervescence gives it a light and refreshing feel."

""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at The Bruery’s tasting room poured into taster. Hazy yellow with white head that settles to a cap that remains for the duration. Aroma is grapefruit, bread, spices, some pine. Taste is early light grainy sweetness shifting to moderate hop bitterness that mixes with the peppery spice and lingers. Light to medium bodied, thin texture, active carbonation, dry bitter finish."

"Very closed to a Belgian tripel. I'd even say it's an American tripel."

"Overall: A good balanced pale ale that puts the yeast on full display, without being overpowering."

"	With every beer I plan to review, I open it roughly 10 minutes before pouring the first sampling of it... Many reasons for this; but my main purposes are to let it breathe, or aerate slightly, as well as giving it a moment to sit out and gain a few degrees in temperature... I wouldn't usually make note of this step, but when I opened this beer it popped louder than I've ever heard any beer pop in my existence, it was startling to say the least... Shortly after, a pointy cap of foam has since grown and fallen to the side resembling a ""santa-hat"" atop its' 750ml throne... It's a beautifully clear hazy beer, (if that makes sense) with far less carbonation present than it had me anticipating... Laughing to myself as I realize 20 minutes have passed and I've merely popped the cap - I grabbed the beer and ""gently"" poured it (via instructions on the label...) It poured light, dispensing a golden-yellow, but the head is so incredibly large I could hardly pour, what I consider to be, my rough ""standard"" amount!! It grew quickly to a rocky four inches and dissipated at a nice slow pace with a little spotty lacing left in it's wake... On the nose is a beautiful wheaty lemon aroma, with a very slight funk amongst some bread and oranges also... At first it tastes much like it smells and is extremely light on the palate... Midway through, more fruitiness arises in the form of possibly mango(?) as well as bananas(?) - regardless a mildly ""tropical"" element is presented... The finish is crisp and contains some more bread, leaving just a touch of bitterness from the hops... The mouthfeel is light at first, but the effervescence builds as it fills this beer out... Somewhat classic in style, it's an almost ""chic"" brew the way it's elements are fairly ""delicate," even in the bitterness of the hops - not to take away from the beer's complexity, flavor or craftsmanship... An easy drinker, probably best enjoyed on a sunny day, this represents a well crafted Belgian that should be enjoy by many... Another good brew - Cheers!!"

"06/20/12 From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Although it's ""hoppy"" according to the bottle's label, I find it more citrusy. Could be a great beer for a nice dinner. Complimentary yet substantial."
"750 ml poured into a 20 oz Firestone glass.Golden color with a 3 inch head.Very nice slight hoppy smell with a touch of grapefruit.Very mellow brew not overly harsh.I liked it.Nice kick to it at 8.5 ABV.Would have to say that it`s a good value at 8.99 a bottle compared to a lot of other Bruery products.I would get this again.Give it a try."

"A strange mixture meets the nose as it holds a spicy peppercorn and clove along side a perfume, floral, flowery hop. To top that off there's a fruity pineapple scent along with honeysuckle. The flavor is light, peppery, spicy and yeasty with some bubblegum-like sweetness. The feel is dry and cidery."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over a decent belgian pale ale, the flavours are very subdued but taste good. The carbonation is a bit too high. The abv is hidden very well."
""
""
"Pours a nice pale yellow. Has a bit of a hoppy smell, and a yeasty smell. May have some brett. Taste is pure and clean. I could definitively taste the yeast, it is not a sweet beer, or a bitter beer. It is a pilsener, it is light, yet it does have a flavor to it. Great beer. Very strong."

"750ml bottle served in a tulip glass. This beer is a golden, hazy, color with medium-high carbonation and head. The aroma is light, slightly smelling of citrus and bread. The taste is of orange peel, a bit of tangerine sweetness and a very nice finish. There's definitely an abundance of characteristically Belgian yeast notes. The taste stays complex even after quite a few sips. I like this very much."

"This is my first encounter with The Bruery and it was definitely a good one. This offering pours a very clear golden hue with an abundance of white foamy head and handsome lacing. The nose is overwhelmed by noble hops, belgian yeast, lemon, pepper, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a little skewed by the overly generous amount of carbonation but that's expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The flavor follows the nose but not quite as balanced the hops poke through a little too much and the malt is lacking. There are additional notes of west coast style hops that I'm not sure elevate the beer or just make it a little more interesting. This is a very good beer and one that I'll enjoy coming back to again. Great west coast take on a European style."

"o - i was not too impressed with this beer, aside from the perfect level of carbonation. There was a definite funk to my glass. I don't know if that was just a bad pour or if this is the true expression of the beer. Either way, I wasn't a huge fan."

"Atmosphere is good. Light hue, thick head, and dry sticky lacing. Nose is hoppy, with a little spice, and lemon citrus. Tastes like it smells...light hops, lemon, and spice. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"This beer has a massive carbonation amount as evidenced by the inch thick tightly woven white head of foam. Rich golden colored with incredible clarity. Brussels lacing. I smell that very clean aroma of Belgian Strong ale yeast with that residual candy like sweetness. The mouth is very dry, crisp, carbonated, and it finishes with a gentle warmth due to the alcohol. There's a very dry sugary sweetness in the flavor. Despite the carbonation this is very drinkable."

"O/D - Didn't enjoy it thoroughly. Didn't hate it though. Not at all what I was expecting for something described as a 'hoppy Belgian golden ale. ' Not my favourite example of the style. Didn't finish the bottle and I probably won't revisit it."
""
""
"D: Very crushable with the light and super lush mouth feel. Tasty and well balanced in flavors of some moderate hops and signature Belgian yeast character. Quite refreshing. Makes for a good warm weather brew."

"The beer is golden and moderately hazy with a towering white head, even after a slow pour. The aroma offers Belgian yeast, pear, apple, grassy hops, floral notes. Really tasty and teeming with flavor. Diverse characteristics. Fruity and hoppy with a touch of tangy bitterness to round things out. Not on par with Duvel Tripel Hop and other authentic and outstanding examples of the style, but a tasty beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden and crystal clear if you manage to leave the yeast sediment behind in the bottle. This brew is highly carbonated and has a crazy frothy head. I tried pouring carefully and still ended up with a good three to four fingers of head. The nose on this beer has that distinct belgian yeastiness about it with a good malt presence. The brew has some nice resinous hop aromatics coming through which go nicely with the belgian characteristics. Terrific aroma! Taste is primarily sweet like a malty apple cider but with a pepper kick and some definite tartness to it as well. A little funky. Pretty typical Belgian characteristics with a hoppy west coast twist. Some bitterness from the hops coming through on the finish. Very crisp and dry mouthfeel. Over all this was a great beer that i rather enjoyed."
""

""
""
"Shared and poured in small tasting glasses. LOT""s of head on this one. Pour slowly, glass tilt and all. Good lacing all the way down. Appearance is a little cloudy and a nice light golden color. Some nose, but not very prevalent. Taste is good for a style of beer I don't normally go for. Some sweetness and a little acidic bite at the end. Sits on the tongue a little. Overall I personally probably won't purchase this again, but glad to have tried and tasted."
"served in a small tasting glass. has a nice Belgian foggy appearance with tons of head. POUR SLOWLY. nose is not strong but the smell is good. no off flavors. taste is good but not as sweet as I would like. leaves little on the tongue but a mild sweetness and slight acidic bitterniss. lacing is very prevelant and carbonation is high. overall a decent beer. I would not buy it again at 12.99 but I also am not a big Belgian lover to begin with."
""
""
""
""

"Would probably have again; worth trying if you like American-style Belgians."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, pineapple, pear, apple, pepper, clove, floral, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, light pine, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast, hop, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, pear, apple, pineapple, wheat, bread, floral, grass, pepper, clove, light pine, and floral/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, tangerine, pineapple, pear, apple, floral, grass, light pepper, wheat, bread, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and moderately slick/crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong golden! All around great balance and complexity of malt, yeast ester, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Hoppy, dry, fair amount of bitterness. Yet lots of spicy and citrusy flavors. Reminds me a bit of Duvel and while not as good in my opinion, it still satisfies with good flavor and easy drinkability. Just right in a small snifter. Like most Bruery beers, this doesn't disappoint. Will have this again."

"Overall: nice effort. Not mind blowing but a good beer."
"O: I respect the style but I'm not a fan of how aggressive and over the top this beer is. I waited till it warmed to the recommended 7C and that certainly helped but big is necessarily better. IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours just slightly hazy blonde. Wonderful citrus, flowery aroma. Good level of carbonation. Cirtrus and various fruit flavors, a bit of bubblegum sweetness. A bit tart. Pear, a touch of peach, a touch of pineapple maybe. Flavors change as it warms up. Very enjoyable. Nice and dry. Too many U.S. brewers don't get their Belgian-style beers dry enough."
""
""
""
""
"The main ""mischief"" this ale is up to is teasing me with indescribable spiciness. Overall, a very ""American"" (meaning hoppy) take on a Belgian style."

"Not a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales but this one wasn't bad. Had it at The Bruery while in Cali for vacation. Overall everything about it was slightly above average. Not my favorite beer from The Bruery but not my least favorite either. Hard to accurately review after a month has gone by."
""
"O: Great stuff. They folks at the tasting compared it to Duvel."
"A sharply executed Belgian and one of the best off-the-shelf offerings from the Bruery. Well done."
""
"O: I found this beer to be pretty interesting - a bit of a hybrid between a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a Belgian IPA (there is a hoppy presence but it still has that golden Belgian flavor). The alcohol is pretty well hidden and it is relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O-This is a perfectly good, but not great, Belgian style beer. It is good-looking and I like the mixture of fruits on the palate, but I found myself thinking that something about this beer was just sort of, I don't know, blah. Maybe it is the lackluster mouthfeel. Hmmm...Anyway, just because this brew is a little boring doesn't make it a bad beer. In fact, I would readily drink this again, but it is not one that I would go searching after in the future."
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, but with some faults. I like the fruit flavours a lot, but the yeast and mat components of an expected BSPA are too subdued, and they don't blend well with the fruits. Still, fairly tasty."

"O: A solid American style Belgian ale. The Bruery excels here with a refreshingly hoppy ale with strong yeastiness that adds fruity ester complexity."
"I was moderately impressed with this beer. Definitely worth a try, though, as it is complex and unique."
""
""
""
""

"O: A good to great beer. Hides the ABV very well. I love the tart sour finish. /88"

"Overall, an excellent beer. Hits on all the notes you expect from a good Belgian Strong Pale Ale and provides that characteristic Bruery flavor profile. Were the opportunity to present itself, I would gladly drink this one again. As the Bruery is hard to get in Kansas City without an online purchase, I'm unlikely to go out of my way to get this one."
""
""
""
""
"Strange and different, and Belgian Pales can be touchy, but I enjoyed Mischief. Hefty amount of spice as well as a hefty amount of fruits with a good hand in the hops as well. The borderline acetone-like alcohol can be a bit fatiguing over time, but the brew is good in small doses. I wish some of these Bruery beers came in smaller serving sizes."

"Overall I have to say I really like this beer. It is extremely easy to drink and refreshing. These guys hit it spot on when they made this beet. It's a belgian IPA mix, but the hop presence is JUST noticeable which I like. Hop bombs usually are so gushing with hops you taste nothing else. This has a very nice balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Bruery takes on the Belgian Golden Strong Ale style and hops it up a bit. This beer is very similar to one of my personal favorites, the notorious Duvel. Mischief reminds me of Duvel with a slightly stronger malt presence married with the hoppiness of Russian River's Defenestration. Highly recommend to someone who whats to try a hopped up Duvel."
""
""
""
""
""
"One straight-up - pedantic, even - emulation of some of the best that the Flemish have to offer - all without the usual uptick in unpleasant, astringent booziness. So, yeah, I like this, and not just because I can place this on a mantle amongst the best that the whale society of BA-friendly producers can churn out."
""
"A very nice beer, not terribly expensive (for Canadians) for the quality. Recommended."
"For the money I was expecting a bit more. Fairly hoppy for a Belgian style ale, but I just couldn't get into this one. For less money I'd rather have a Brooklyn Local 2 which I think is a far superior take on a Belgian style ale. Some of the other Bruery products I saw were ridiculously expensive, based on this one I will pass on the others."
""
""
""
""
"I'm pretty happy to see The Bruery here in Alberta and can only wonder what else I may be able to get my hands on. Its not cheap beer but you gotta know I'll be buying all of them at least once."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall: Nice first impression of The Bruery. The price was fairly low for what my expectations of the Bruery ($12 for a 750 at a bar) and the beer was well done. but amazing that i would kill to get my hands on again."

""
""
"The Bruery Mischief ---4/5."
""
""
"Overall, a good example of Hopped up Belgian pale ales. The alcohol note was a bit of a distraction for me. One to try."
"initial taste is a mirage of fruits but most notably pear followed buy a good blend of earthy/spicy hops that perform there duty by balancing out the fruity taste and esters given off by the yeast. the beer does give off a little bit of alcohol warmth as well. the beer finishes dry but has a medium mouthfeel that is rather creamy. very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- I do enjoy this style of beer and this is a fantastic American hoppy version. A nice level of intense hops without sacrificing much of the Belgium aspects. Went really well with the Carolina Honey baby back ribs that I grilled up."
"Overall an OK beer but a little funky, that onion flavor throws it off a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of yeast in the aroma with a bit of funk. Okay body, but the beer is a little bland. Funk aroma does stand out in the flavour. Not a whole lot of fruit or flower in the taste. Maybe it is old, but I expected more lighter notes of citrus fruit than the heavy funk that i do get."

"O-I enjoyed this BPA, good flavors and easy drinking even with the higher ABV"
"Pours a hazed blonde with a creamy three finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is typical beligian with fruity esters,belgian doughy yeast,peaches,lemons and some spice,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,creamy and well carbonated and tastes are pretty much the exact as smell with peach predominant firstly followed by that Belgian bready yeast,boiled candy,lemon and limes and,candi sugar and finished with a dry herbal bitterness and overall its a nice take on a Belgian style and if not for the label it could pass as one cheers."

"Purchased at BevMo in Tacoma. HUGE white head, four fingers. Color is a hazy rosy gold. Very tangy smell, tartness, yeast and dark fruit. Very dry, lightly hopped and extremely crisp. Quite refreshing. A light touch of vanilla. Very drinkable for 8.5% ABV. Starts to sneak up on you by the end of the bottle."
""
""
""
"The brew is remarkably easy to drink, partly because of the light body. Given the powerful flavors I'd expect more weight on the palate, but it does add to the drinkability."

"750 ml bottle poured into a Gouden Carolus chalice. Thanks Cheesemoose! White, fluffy head, high retention on a hazy coppery golden body. Aroma includes a caramel and fruity sweetness, some Belgian yeastiness and candi sugar. Some banana and some earthy hops. Taste follows closely with the aromas. Highly carbonated mouthfeel, cleansing on the tongue, really opening up the dynamic flavors of this one. Quite a tasty Belgian style interpretation."
""
""

"O – Attempts to imitate Duvel, but not as bright. A little maltier. A fine beer but many other Belgian golden pales I would rather drink."

"Overall, pretty nice, similar to a Belgian iPa, Belgian pale."

"O - I have been so tired of this style, that I have pretty much stayed clear of anything that says Belgian, on the label. I have tried SO many and still can't understand why ppl love it so much. The yeast is so overpowering, that you can't even make an assumptions of the type of malts/hops the brewer used. I've heard great things about The Bruery, and was hoping they would bring my love for belgian brews back to life. Sadly, Mischief did not do so... I also bought Saison Rue and Autumn Maple, I'm REALLY hoping they can make up for Mischiefs upset."
""
""
""
""
"Overall -"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Any issues aside, this is still a significantly balanced take on BSPA on the style, and definitely the best West Coast adaptation since I had Russian River's Damnation. It's definitely a good way to introduce newcomers to the style, and it pairs quite easily with most types of food as well as all seasons in the year. Glad to try this as my first beer by the Bruery, hope to try more soon!"
""
""
""
"Like how the subtleties of this beer come together so well on this one. Highly recommend and definitely reasonably priced for $7.99 bomber."
""
""
""
"I am a big fan of BSPAs, and this is yet another one that I can add to my list of great examples of this style. The hoppiness is a good American twist on this style."
"O- Nothing is what expected from this american styled belgian, and I mean that in a good way. I really enjoyed each and every characteristic from this beer. I would have to say as far as it goes for the american style, this is a must in my book. Glad I live close to the Bruery, this on tap has to be 5x better. :)"
""
""
""

"O: A really dry and quite bitter BSPA. Lots of citrus, grass and herbal hops. Nothing amazing, just a different take on the style."

"Pours a lightly hazy golden with a HUGE, meringue like off-white head. Lacing sticks to the glass better than almost any other beer I've seen. Really amazing to see. Aromas of vinous vinegar, and a hint of hay. Taste begins with a a huge lemon blast up front, followed by some light grassyness, a hint of aspirin after that. Then herbal bitterness, intermingled with banana and a bit of clove. Finishes with a clean, dry bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich. Carbonation is super high, but that's not odd at all for this style. Overall a great BSPA. The extra hoppyness is nice, though its not so crazy that it overwhelms the rest of the beer."

"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy golden color ale with a huge white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light sweet Belgian malt with some notes of dry hops with light fruity undertones. Taste is also a mix between some lightly sweet Belgian malt with dry hops notes and light fruity undertones. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Good but I was expecting more of dry hops notes based on the description."

"Very fine beer from The Bruery. Wouldnt't mind some morebitterness or acidity to clean off the dominant tropical fruit."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy orange amber with an aggressive white head, about 1/3 of the glass. Nice Belgian spice aroma, somewhat sour. Whoa. Like a modest IPA crossed with a saison, a sour wild ale component with a hop kick without any noticeable hop flavors. Lots of bitter citrus. Obviously made well, but a complete miss for me with my least favorite aspects of the two dominant components."
""
""
""
"Warming, medium-full body with a fairly upfront effervescence. Not an overpowering, in-your-face kind of carbonation but quite noticeable. Slightly drying finish. Malt & spice hang on in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Wants to compete with trade winds but cant. Great beer on it's own otherwise but a bit of heat and a bit too floral and overly spiced."
"Overall: Very good beer, definitely a step above of what I thought it was going to be. I picked this up on a whim and honestly will again. Hope you enjoy, Salud!"
""
""
"overall, i would buy this again."
"Overall a solid BSPA from a solid brewery."
""
""
"Bottom Line- It appears that this is a top notch brewery now all I have to do is find the right beer."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter slowly (to minimize disturbing the bottle sediment) a glowing, partly hazy, pale yellow gold supports a foamy dense white head. Mildly sour lemon citrus juice and rind come forth in a fruity aroma to the beat of a Belgian yeast character. Fruit and spice seem to harmonize here nicely to deliver a tasty treat for the Belgian Golden style lover and novice alike."
""
"Overall Impression- A sweet version of the style, I wasn't too impressed with this one from the Bruery. I'm still trying to knock off all of the beers from this brewery off my list but am trying to miss those that aren't outstanding. Wouldn't necessarily go back to this one again..."
"Very clean mouthfeel. A mellow crisp if you will. The more i dwell on it the more i like it"
"D: Very nice twist on the Belgian golden with a more aggressive hopping."
"Overall is this a tasty Belgian Strong Pale. Less boozy and more fruit/tart flavors than others I've had (it's almost like a wild ale). Definitely one worth a try; I'd have it again!"
"O: I'm sincerely enjoying this beer. It's a wacky mix of old world and new school. Big Belgian yeast and lots of citrusy hop profiles. It's pretty darn good. I'd drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: very drinkable with just the right amount of hops on a well made belgian base beer."
"Overall this is a solid American made Belgian style pale ale, definitely worth checking out if you like the style."
""
""
"O- Something is off for me. I can taste way too much alcohol for a 8.5% beer."
""
""
"* I read other reviews and this may be an older bottle. I'll never know. *"
"Pours a hay like yellow with a hefty, foamy white head and nice lacing. A smooth funky, mildly fruity tart, and sweet aroma. Flavor follows suit; incredibly smooth and balanced. A nice active, maybe medium bodied mouthfeel with a dry finish. Overall, a really nice Begian (strong) Pale Ale. Wonderfully put together."
""
""
""
"Complex, light, effervescent. This is about as good as an American Belgian Pale gets. Go buy one."
""
"A bit of a mess of a brew, but still very good. Heavy spice and thick heat bring out interesting Belgian interpretations. Recommended. I would age my new one for 2-3 years..."
"O - Really loved this one, a highlight from the Bruery, great summer beer shared with a great Dutch friend."
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head. The smell is also reminiscent of honey and some fruity yeast/hops. There is a grainy aroma that is slightly tangy which follows through in the taste. The hops don't carry through as expected, but overall it's very balanced and has a slightly grape-like aftertaste. This beer might be worth aging because the hops don't present nearly as expected and some time aging may file down the heavy 8.5%abv."
""
""
""
"Overall a really nice version of the style. Just as good or better on tap as it was in the bottle, from what I remember."

"Overall pretty easy drinking ale, light and hoppy with a surprising lack of malt character in exchange, yet an interesting take nonetheless."

"A nice drinkable beer with great yeasty flavors and aromas. A Fine example of what a Belgian beer should taste like, straight out of California."
""
""
""
"O: very impessed with my first beer from the bruery, definatley sweeter than most belgains but I love the tropical fruit smell/taste."
"The hops are definitely on display here. Malt is likely there but not very detectable. Not boozy but does give a faint alcohol burn at the end. Nice beer."
""
""
"A very enjoyable way to spend a lazy afternoon."
"O= A nice brew from the Bruery. This is the first beer I've had from them with a hop character to it and I enjoyed it. A nice subtleness to it that keeps it from being a hop bomb but enough hops so anyone can recognize them there. Effervecent carbonation and a great flavor make this a beer worth drinking again and again."
""
""
"I like this beer. I mean, it works. There is a slight hop spicy tone to it that gives it a bit of an edge, but overall, the beer just seems well made and ""good."" It doesn't blow me away in a manner that awes me, but it's good, and I like it."

"D - Very drinkable. Really nice American inspired BSPA. The extra bit of hops really balances nicely with the more traditional Belgian flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with an off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is of grain and yeast up front with spice flavors that lingers after each sip. There is a mild bitterness on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the spices are quite strong in the flavor."
""
""
"M: It's a light/medium body. Good mouth coating."
""
"A decent brew, it is nonetheless my least favorite of their offerings that I've had so far. No doubt it is hoppy; however, I find that the hoppiness overpowers the BSPA notes looking to come through."
""
"Overall, a solid strong pale ale. It's very well constructed, and while I wouldn't say it does anything I've never experienced before, it does a great job of putting everything together."
"Overall this is a very good belgian strong. I like the flavor and balance. I'd like to get ahold of a fresh bottle just to do some good comparison."
"This is a phenomenal take on the style and one of the best examples I've ever had."
""
""
"Overall - Despite not liking the flavor too much, I really like how well the beer is overall. Its pretty drinkable, and it reminds me of their Saison Rue, only with the flavors ramped up. Its not as refreshing, but it is a good drink to pair with food."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good, Belgian Pale Ale is usually not a go-to style for me. Only major complaint is the carbonation."
"wow. outrageous take on a belgian style golden. pours a hazy dark hay color with a really pumping white head. sexy lacing on the glass as it drinks. smells fruity and fancy and sweet, aromas of kiwifruit, dandelion, grassy yeast. flavor is tart a little, and acidic. a lot like a fresh pineapple, just totally in bloom. mouthfeel is unreal, dry to the max with bright flashing carbonation and a crispness thats just short of refreshing, like you cant take a big enough sip to quite satisfy. the abv surprises me, seems lighter than an 8.5%. this is why american breweries should keep making belgian style beers, because sometimes you can surpass the genuine article. this is dope dope dope"
""
"O- Another major score from The Bruery. Rapidly becoming one of my top 5 American breweries."
""
""
"O. Normally I'm not a huge Belgian Ale fan, but this was outstanding."
"O/D-At $9.75 for a 750ml, this is of average price for the quantity. I enjoyed this beer a bunch but I don’t know if I would toss out another $10 for a Bruery beer. A great drink nonetheless. Plenty to like about this Belgian inspired ale."

"poured hazy/foggy golden, nicely unfiltered. to the nose is definatly spice with piney-hoppy undertones, some fruit rind arouma follows. mouthfeel is carbonated with hops and spices playing nicely and a nice dry finish. and thats were you'll find the A.B.V, in the dryness, definatly dry hopped. all though well hidden it might just creep up on you. overall a great beer with all the right balances. wish i had a tulip glass for this one tho, i bet i missed out on some sexy lacing. but a pint works just as good."

"750 ml bottle pours a pale amber with giant bubbly head and massive lacing. Aroma is earthy, spicy belgian yeast. Flavor is light citrusy and peppery hops with typical belgian yeast banana/coriander flavor and a subtle dose of sourness. At 8.5% the alcohol is well hidden. Carbonation really dances on the tongue with nice dry finish. My first offering from The Bruery - not a big fan of Belgians but I'm coming around and I very much enjoyed this one!"

"Overall my first bruery offering, not my favorite style, but an excellent beer none the less."

"If you're a fan of Belgian Strong Pale Ales and you can handle tartness then this is a good one to try."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into Tripel Karmeliet oversized snifter."

"""Belgian-style ale golden and hoppy"""
"D/O: This beer shows up with hop qualities blazing, defying the Belgian standard which inspired it. It proves to be effortlessly drinkable, yet strong, and complex at the same time. As the label says, keep an eye on this one because it could sneak up on the drinker."
"This is very good, I like that its a bit hoppier than most beers of this style."
"Drink- This was a beer I had a long time ago and never got around to reviewing. This was very tasty beer. It had good layers and nice balance."
"Gonna give this place a visit soon"
"Taste is more of the same from the aroma with great dry and crisp flavor and mouthfeel. This beer has the best attributes of Brooklyn Sorachi Ace and Duvel and tastes sort of like a combo of the two."
"First taste of a beer from The Bruery which is local for me. Belgians are my favorite so I was curious to taste this ""hoppy"" style. Loved it. It combines my favorite flavors into one beer. While it has the appearance, smell, and flavor of a belgian it also has a nice hoppy background which finishes nicely. I will definitely buy this one again, rolls right down my throat."
"O - An excellent beer."
"Dr: Decent drinkability, below average quality and above average ABV."
"Just an altogether lovely beer, and an absolute treat to see on cask."
"The Mischief from The Bruery was a decent find and kudos to the supplier that recommended it. Not normally a Belgium style fan....but I think I am starting to come around. The Mischeif was a cloudy yellow in color, great carbonation and decent white head that reformed every time you swilled the glass. The smell included clove, banana, and hops (pine/citrus). The taste was surprisingly light and crisp....even though it was registering in the 8%+ ABV. This is a dangerous beer. The clove/spice and banana are present at the start and then the hops take over to clear the pallet. The mouthfeel is remarkedbly decent. If you see this....try it."
"A great looking beer. Would definitely have again."
"Mischief warms differently than a Duvel. As it sat out, it developed into a duller, more coarse finish. I found this rather satisfying however - it had a toughness that reminded me that I am drinking a good, strong ""manly"" brew. These California brewers have hit a most medieval note in this sound ale."
"Poured from a fresh growler I got at The Bruery yesterday. Pours a clear, bright golden color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is nice Belgian yeast with some profound hoppiness. A bit earthy with some citrus aromas as well. Taste is initially bright fruit flavors with a hint of floral notes. The slightest bit tart with some lovely Belgian yeast and spicy characteristics. This has a lot of the same characteristics as Snicklefritz does, just a lot less buttery. Finishes with lightly bittered hops for a crisp closing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale. Glad I chose this to fill the growler."
"Taste starts sweet, a peach tartness in the middle, and smooths out with some alcohol at the close. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is good and easy, especially for the abv. Not bad..."
"O: Overall , I was a tad disappointed with this due to the bitterness at the close. To me it tasted like a Belgian style ale with the wrong style hops in it, a bit confused tasting stylistically. I wouldn't seek this out again."
"O - A nice integration of hops into a strong golden."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. The Bruery tries to infuse a new spin onto the style, and I think it works nicely. If you are looking for a strict obedience to the 'style', I'd look elsewhere, but since it's marketed as a hoppy Belgian, I am on board with it and really enjoyed it. If only I could find Bruery products local to me!"
"O: A good North American interpretation of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale that is more bitter and hoppy than its Belgian counterparts."
"A nice, fruity and easy to drink Belgian Strong Golden Ale. The hop character adds interest and the spice is well balanced."
"A flawless American version of the style. Thank you, The Bruery."
"O: Strange, but recommended. I'd have another, but only if I'm in a hoppy-sour mood."
"My first Bruery beer and first review. Trying to do new beer Sunday. Very impressed, I would have again."
"O-very complex and unique. i really appreciate this and recommend this. i've had nothing like this before and am willing to spend the $$ for more bottles."
"jd"
"O - Very nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Heavy on the fruit aromas, they remain when tasting but balanced nicely with bitterness, and a touch of spice. Will certainly enjoy this one again and would be very interested in aging a bottle."
"O - Pretty good. Reminded me a bit too much of an IPA. I would have liked for the spices to come out a bit more. Worth the price though."
"O - Solid BSPA with a nice orange kick. If you like orange flavor in your beer this is a good pick."
"Excellent rendition of a Belgian golden ale with a touch of American hopping."
"Overall its great wonderful nose taste is good even if not as sweet as the nose, very drinkable. Thanks merlin48 for sharing this one with me."
"Overall, this is a very nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale, reminds me a bit of Damnation from Russian River."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, fairly quick drinking despite the higher ABV. I've had this a couple times before and keep forgetting how much I actually enjoy it. The hop profile is a nice touch of the style, and I like how they were able to keep the alcohol under control."
"Overall very good. Light beer with great flavor. So signs of ABV."
"Overall, very interesting and nicely complex beer from a well-known brewery that knows how to execute."
"- This beer stands out among other golden Belgian-style ales of this type. The zest and spice stand out while yet melding well with the rest of this beers complex flavors while leaving it very balanced, but yet dry and hoppy. Certainly a must try in my book."
"An enjoyable Belgian Golden/Strong Pale Ale. I think it could stand to shave off 1-2% ABV to make it a little easier to drink. Unique mix of attributes makes it memorable but not outstanding. Paid $9 for the 750 mL and have had it on tap for $5/12 oz."
"Very drinkable, one of my fav Bruery beers, simple yet elegant and nuanced in my opinion."
"Well done!"
"O: Really great representation of the style, enjoyable in all respects"
"Again, I know these California boys brewed this up all on their own, but you'd think they had a Belgian's shoulder to look over and copied the formula from note for note. (And then, naturally, dry-hopped the $#!@ out of it just to make it their own.) Congratulations Bruery Mischief, you've just made it onto my list of favourite all-time strong pale ales."
"The mouthfeel is really nice. Like other Bruery beers, their bottles take on a nice champagne like quality. This one is no different. It's light, bubbly, and refreshing. The alcohol doesn't really seem to register. There is a little warm alcohol aftertaste but it's really subtle. A nice beer overall."
"This brew pours out as a nice looking golden yellow color with a pretty decent head on top. The lacing isn't the greatest but it did have a few scattered bubbles around. The smell of the beer was hoppy and had a good amount of Belgian yeast in there to balance it out. The taste of the beer was a little earthy, but has a big hoppy aftertaste to it. The mouthfeel was smooth at first then it switched over to a more tingly feeling that left the mouth dry. Overall I thought this beer was pretty interesting. It was much lighter in color than I thought it'd be. I'd say it's worth trying."
"Appearance is a cloudy golden tone with a two finger head upon first opening it. The smell contains banana, belgian yeast, spices, a good dose of hops too. Sipping from a tulip glass, I taste pine, citrus, more of that yeast, some of the boozy alcohol aspect presents itself as well. MF is medium with a solid carbonation level. All in all, this is a very good strong pale ale and another solid offering from The Bruery."
"Taste-Spicy Belgian yeast,coarse, earthy hops,funky barnyard essence. Crisp, hoppy, dry, snappy and very tasty. Bubbly and very drinkable but sip with caution as this brew goes down very smooth for a ""big caliber"" (8.5ABV) beer. Sip slowly and enjoy!"
"Overall - Just a solid example of the style."
"Not going to break this one down because honestly I don't have much to say. Misty gold in appearance with a nice 2 finger head. Smell and taste are almost identical: belgian yeast and hop bitterness in the foreground with apricot sweetness smoothing them over and bringing them together. Heavy on the carbonation, too much for my taste. Overall quite a good beer for the style but a little too straight forward for me."
"Pours a pretty golden orange color with a few finger foamy head. Aroma is bright and hoppy. Wow this almost smells like a belgian ipa. Tastes super bright and tropical with decent hoppage. Delicious! Feel is tingly and nice. A delight! I really wish I had access to more Bruery stuff here in upstate NY."
"Second time I had this beer. Hazy copper that's a little murky. Bubbly white head, good retention. Very sticky aroma, pine, lots of hops, really overpowers the yeast. I've had hoppy belgian pales that were more in balance. Most of the taste is dominated by resinous herbacious hops. Too much early addition hops, much of the belgian quality is hidden. However a rather dry mouthfeel, only slightly chewy. I'm just not that enamored with this beer. Too hoppy, or too many of the wrong hops at the wrong times of the boil. Typically love the brewery but I think they missed here."
"Mouthfeel - pretty light body, a nice refreshing summer beer, very crisp and clean"
"Pours misty golden with giant white head that stays. Smells yeasty, clove, a bit of alcohol, slight ketchup. Tastes of citrus peel, cloves, yeast character, lemon zest, alcohol burn, undertone of banana and tropical fruit, hop dryness makes an appearance towards the finish. Finished crisp with lingering citrus peel. High carbonation and medium bodied. A boozy, dry Belgian that is hard to put down."
"A nice beer, one I would definitely seek out again."
"Strong aroma is crisp and fruity with a firm yeasty overtone - and a bit of a nip. It pours a clear, bubbly golden yellow with a thick and fairly persistent white head that leaves some respectable lacing. Crisp, fruity flavor is rather sour, yet has a sweet undertone, as well as a woody hint of hops. Texture is milk-smooth, a bit thick and rather tingly. Mischief indeed! This is a worthy brew."
"Feel is smooth, effervecent, crisp, nearly full bodied with a complexity that carries one heck of a nice touch of playful citrusy zest and peppery hops without over doing it. A damn solid American take on a big Belgian style. A little more sweetness to it and this would be more to my liking. Yet, overall, I enjoyed the heck out of this Mischief."
"O - A must try from a great brewery. We will both be seeking this out again."
"Interesting, but not very pleasant drinking. At the Wazee Supper Club in Denver."
"glad i tried it once."
"Overall Mischief is a little weird for me. Not my style, and a little adventurous in a way that doesn't work with my palate. Yet so many other things are done right, it's har to grade this beer below a B."
"o: Beautiful smell, attractive (carb aside) and pleasantly tasty. Unfortunately, the carbonation was too much. It didn't totally wreck the brew as I would enjoy this again...but I would certainly save it for a scorching hot summer day (100 degrees plus) where I was outside for 4 hours doing hard labor (which doesn't happen too often). Worth a try just for the flavor...but be warned about the heavy level of carb."
"O - I appreciate the attempt. I think I would actually like this beer a lot more if it wasn't carbonated so heavily."
"O - a very solid BSPA with a pleasant twist, thoroughly enjoyable; I might enjoy it even more on a hot summer afternoon, as opposed to this fairly chilly spring evening, but I can't fault them for that, of course; I'm wondering what it might be like after a year or two in the cellar."
"O: If you like Belgians, try this beer. It not your average Belgian Strong. After tasting this effort, I'll be looking for more beers to try from this brewery."
"Pours with a slight haze. Golden yellow with huge frothy ice cream soda like head. Smells dusty and dry like hay. A lot orange aromas. Palate is sharp up front and immediately dry from the yeast. Explosive yet creamy mouthfeel. Flavors are of hay, orange rind, lime oil, corn husk, and lemongrass. A good bit of bitterness. Long finish. Much softer than Duvel on the mouthfeel, but more flavorful in all respects. Well done."
"Wonderful marriage of blonde style with hoppiness. Mild hop aromas, rich nose of malt. Golden blond with lots of off-white head. SLightly spicy. Just magnificient drinkability, the hot weather and the food made the moment perfect. Above average mouthfeel."
"Price = $ 9.00 at Witherspoon Wines"
"O- This is a really good beer for the style, and definitely worth the pickup if you like good brews. If the taste and feel matched the appearance and taste, this would be a world class BSPA. Still, it's a solid effort, and I enjoyed it."
"D: This was like a Belgian IPA, with lots of hops and not much yeast or sweetness. The body was ok but not great, but the alcohol was well hidden, so it was pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable but nothing special."
"O: All things considered, I enjoyed the Bruery's Mischief. It's not the best in show, but for a Belgian Strong Pale, I kinda dug it. I do feel that I'd prefer it one of two ways: with a bit of funk, or as a standard Belgian Pale with a lower ABV. Regardless, this is a pleasant enough beer."
"Pours a semi hazy unfiltered straw, bone white head, little retention. Smells of peppery Belgian yeast, some grassy hops. In the flavor, sweet belgian yeast, alittle tart, some herbal hop flavors and a clean dry finish. White grape and notes of pipe tobacco. Well carbonated with a smooth semi dry feel. Overall, a tasty beverage and almost a dry tripel."
"Overall, a real nice beer. The dry hopping with American hops throws a real curveball into the traditional Belgian ale. Nice complexity and flavor. An enjoyable beer all around."
"overall, a solid well hoppy belgian pale. it hits all the right notes, and the hops have a complexity to them that you don't usually find in the style."
"Final thought - First beer I have had from this brewery and I love it"
"FANTASTIC BREW, DON'T MISS IT!"
"Well done."
"Very nicely done. This beer is easy to drink, very flavorful, and makes you want to have it again. Very good stuff!"
"Not the most complex beer I've had from the Bruery, but quite competent and enjoyable."
"Overall: This a good but not great beer in my opinion. The finish took away from what I thought was a very good beer. My bottle seemed a bit over carbonated."
"Pours a light yellow, just a bit of haze with a pig pillowy head that hangs around lacing the glass all the way to the end. The aroma is fruity with the hop presence lingering in the background. The flavor is sweet with some Belgian style spice and maybe a bit of banana which becomes much more hoppy and bitter especially as it warms. Very dry and refreshing. Nice carbonation keeps the palate clean and crisp."
"D: very refreshing brew. light and easy to drink, yet an alcohol content that keeps it serious. does anyone know if bruery does 12oz bottles?"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a big white head. In the aroma, fruity, dry and earthy, a small hop presence. In the taste, dry earth, nice hops, and hints of pear. A hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry earth and a dry pear fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice earth and fruit to a hoppy golden ale that hides the alcohol."
"Had this one on tap this evening at Hops & Pie in the Highland neighborhood in North Denver. I had been resisting purchasing a bottle of this one, as I have not been overly impressed with either the flavors or the prices of the Bruery's regualar offerings. After trying this one tonight, I will definitely be purchasing a bottle soon. Hazy golden color with a big fluffy white head. Aromas of tropical fruits, citrus and Belgian yeast. Medium bodied, with flavors of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, peaches and pepper. Very good."
"Overall, as a Belgian strong pale, it seems to be missing a good amount of malt. Seems like more malt was dashed in favor of hop additions. This seems more in line with a Belgian IPA. However, style quibbling aside, this is still a good beer."
"O- this a great golden ale or saison or pale ale.. tae your pick it is delicious"
"Don't know how much better it can get than this. You tell me. I don't know."
"O- I love this beer, the Bruery continues to surprise me by making great representations of Belgian style beers."
"Poured into a large tulip glass a clear deep golden with a large blooming white head that took forever to subside.multiple layers of lace left behind.Wow what awesome aromas,there is an American twist to this beer no doubt,floral and citric hops all over the place,its perfect as far as Iam concerned.Dry on the palate with grassy herbal hop notes,light spiced phenols but they dont play a big role.This is quenching and bone dry,I really like it.If all beers of this style were like this I would be a convert,the American craftmanship to the Belgian strong pale style in this beer shows thru with great left coast hop flavors.The alcohol lends a little sweetness but its held in check pretty well."
"Grabbed this guy with the saison rue the other day. Side by side, the saison rue wins out, but I enjoyed this as well, especially for it's cheaper price. First of all, gorgeous pour on this one - not to be missed. Unfortunately, it looks a bit better than it tastes. Drinking it, there's a bit of complexity. It begins with a bit of a citrusy fruit mixture, turns greener, sourer, and finally, toward a dry, earthy finish. I think at the start, the beer is fantastic, but something gets lost in the finish. Maybe something gets added. I had the same feeling with the Saison Rue, that there was something amiss. It was almost like both of these were just barely not fresh enough to retain the intended character. Like something in the bottle twisted just enough to raise an eyebrow. I enjoyed the beer, but not enough that I'd recommend it in a line up. Because of that off-taste I couldn't quite place, though, I'll definitely have to try it again."
"This beer is flavorful, vibrant, and fun to drink."
"Belgian-type IPA's rarely show this type of power and intensity while not over-complicating the balance or layering of taste. The beer is understood to be focused on grapefruit flavor and bitterness with only periphrial and complimentary flavors and aromas to support the crisp citrus dominance."
"Overall: This probably would have been better - certainly hoppier - when fresh. That said, it was still a decent Belgian pale. Great nose, but the flavor profile was a bit dull and possessed too many ester and earth notes."
"Overall: Another very solid offering from The Bruery. I've been impressed with every beer of theirs that I've tried and can't wait to be moving to their home state in a few weeks."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Medium bodied and filled with Belgian-yeast taste. I left the yeast in the bottle, as it suggested I do. Drinkable and creamy. Not the best Belgian ale I've had, but not bad either. Slightly disappointed with my expectations for this one."
"D - A very nice beer, goes down very smoothly. I like the dry finish. This is my first quaff from The Bruery, want to try some other styles from them."
"My first beer from The Bruery. Very well crafted, fine tasting."
"D - A touch bitter but a nice combo."
"I really enjoy this beer and even if that's not how it's classified here I think this is one of the most enjoyable Belgian IPAs out there. Just a really well crafted, tasty beer. A relatively simple one, but that's just fine because it's done so well. One of the best from The Bruery imho."
"Drinkability was very good, as I find the style to be in general. Overall, a fine first impression was made by this brewery, I look forward to trying more of their brews."
"M/D: Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Very crisp and easy drinking. Very enjoyable."
"Drinks extremely well. It's refreshing and I think a lot of that comes from the flavor profile. The fact that the body is light also helps this out. This is just excellent execution on an idea that many other companies seem to have tried and not done so well on. A very nice beer."
"D: A drinkable beer, to say the least. It is an interesting marriage of Belgian and hops. Worth checking out for sure."
"bottle sample- golden pour with excellent clarity and moderate head. Nose- grassy hops, apples, bready. Taste- pear, citrus and spice. Finish steers towards a boozy slightly astringent and metallic dryness. Body and mouthfeel is about right for style."
"The Mischief pours a golden straw color with a very big pillowy white head that lines the glass. Nose is dominated with fruits. Subtle notes of breads and hops. Taste is mostly pears and apricots. Musky soapy flavor lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is crispy and medium bodied. Drinkability is pretty high. Not overpowering and pretty good tasting brew from a brewery that has never let me down."
"D: Good easy drinking beer"
"This beer pours a murky, muddy apricot in color with a billowing three finger white, soapy head. It actually looks very similar to the Upland Peach Lambic. It smells sweet and has almost a citrus accent to it. It tastes really good. It's citrusy with a nice, light hop finish. It drinks very smoothly and leaves the tongue tingling. This beer is stellar. We had it after a Damnation and prefer this. It's insanely drinkable. Awesome beer."
"A decent offering, but better out there. Maybe I need a fresher one to get more hops?"
"Overall, a pretty easy drinking golden ale. Straight forward. A bit above average."
"D: The first time I had this beer, I thought it was fantastic. It was served cold, split among four friends and the beer never had a chance to warm. My next few experiences were on draft. Completely different beer and unimpressive. I thought the taplines may have been dirty so I found another bar serving it. Still...quite forgetable. This is a review from the bottle, consumed slowly throughout the night, by myself. I strongly recommend that anyone so inclined to drink Mischief finds themself a bottle and a few friends. Serve it cold and drink it quick. In my experience, this is the only way to enjoy this beer."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a crisp pale orange with a thin off white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a hint of sweet fruits and mild spice. The taste is a nice amount of crisp sweet fruits and spices with an interesting bitter hop finish. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation and a nice dryness. This is an enjoyable draft Belgian style beer, these guys seem to pull that off better than anybody."
"Had this on tap at the Toronado. Super pale yellow hue. The pour yielded a thick white head that turned into some lacing. Strong, spiced, bubble come aroma. Man, you can smell that Belgian yeast good. Super smooth mouthfeel, kind of thick. Tastes of citrus and malt, almost a bit like lemon grass, which seems to dominate at times. This beer kind of confuses me. It's trying to achieve a few things all at once. It's got the Belgian aspect down, but then there's that citrus thing going on. Does this want the character of an American Pale Ale, too? Not even 1/4 of a way into it and I'm already wanting my next beer. It comes off a bit like a super thick saison."
"Golden, hazy color with a thick bubbly head, that turns into foam that leaves decent lacing. A flowery smell with citrus notes and a familiar Belgian yeast, and some tartness as well. A crisp, full-flavored beer with a strong hop character, complimented by a tart spiciness. A dry beer with smooth champagne-like carbonation. The high ABV is well-hidden in this beer which suits any season or reason. Quite a few worthy candidates, but this is mostly likely my favorite offering from the Bruery. Cheers!"
"Medium bodied, heavy carbonation, finishes dry. Overall pretty disappointing. Nothing about it stands out as extraordinary. I will pass on this in the future."
"Had this on tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Pours a straw-yellow colour with thick white head, nice lacing. Smells quite grassy, with lots of Belgian yeastiness. Well hidden alcohol in the flavour, mild bitterness, some sweetness. Good carbonation level, makes this quite smooth to drink. Really nice beer."
"D - Very enjoyable beer. I would recommend it."
"Alcohol is well hidden, and the mouthfeel is crisp, inviting, though not watery."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a short head but some nice lacing. Smells somewhat sweet and a touch yeasty with some malt tanginess at the end. The taste is a good deal better, with a nice balance between spicy hops and some nice yeasty notes. Very dry, and quite crisp. Pleasant"
"Drinkability: Solid, but some distance from perfection. The high hopping adds some amazing attributes to the appearance, but there are slight imperfections with how it blends with the base beer. The 8.5% is nothing to sneeze at, but manageable if one drinks slowly (and not out of bounds for the style). I think this one could be tweaked slightly to either go full bore Belgian IPA (let's amp up the citrus and the herbal, minty notes) or the other way - either way would strike a really nice balance between the constituent parts of the base beer (which is expertly made, of course) and the hop components (which are nice, unsurprisingly)."
"Cloudy golden yellow with a sticky, thick white head that leaves plenty of lace on the glass. Juicy orange and spicy Belgian yeast ester aromas. Juicy citrus hop, ripe fruit, peppery yeast. Sweet, bright, and dry. Medium bodied and very drinkable. I enjoyed this one!"
"Drinkability: goes down really well, would not have guessed the hight ABV. Slightly reminiscent of a tripel."
"Dam fine beer...perfect size bottle for a sitting."
"Taste is sharp, hoppy and yeasty. Mouthfeel is quite full and smooth. Very tasty and easy drinking. It's a bit pricey but still tasty."
"Overall, a decent if interesting take on the style. This one wasn't bad but didn't hit it out of the park for me in a category with a lot of classic examples."
"D: I like this beer. It presents itself in the nose, riffs on the smell in the mouth without trying to play games. A confident beverage. It looks beautiful, too. Recommended."
"D Pretty good beer, I would repeat."
"Fruity sweetness with a nice dry grain character, with a hint of flowering yet bitter herbs. The Bruery hits all the right notes both for style and for sheer pleasure. Eminently drinkable, so dry and the alcohol so restrained. The Belgians would consider this wildly hoppy, but in the American milieu, this is right down the middle. Very clean, perhaps lacking a little bit in personality. No-brainer: give this one a shot."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall, this beer is excellent. A good amount of hops give it a good kick to the traditional style, but the earthy, funky character keep it rooted quite well."
"The taste consists of light floral and citrus hops. In addition, I get a bit of spice and light pear notes underneath. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a nice spicing to it. Drinks quite well overall and is fairly unique."
"D: One of best American versions of BSPA. Drinkable in the extreme."
"Drinks easy, but some flaws hold it back from greatness. Reminds me of Boulevard tank#7 with some things I like more & less. I like it, don't love it..."
"M - Great body, maybe a little gassy if I had any complaint but I would definitly seek this out again."
"Overall- This is a nice beer, IMO not as good as many of the ones from Belgium, but this is a good American version."
"This is a well made BPA. It's above average though not drastically so, but is a great American interpretation of the style."
"4.5/4/4/4/4"
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with zippy carbonation. Sort of a Belgian IPA/BSPA."
"D - good beer, hides its ABV well and easily drinkable with an attractive flavor and easy mouthfeel."
"D - This is a good enjoyable beer that has a good taste making it easy to drink a little too quickly worth getting sometime to try"
"Finger of bone white foam, mix of many bubble sizes, enough fluff that the retention is decent, forms sheets of lacing which slowly slide down the glass side. Light orange to deeper yellow in hue, not especially hazy but not transparent either, dispersed if steady bubbles. The nose has a certain tightness to it, led by wet grass, pepper, unsweetened multi-grain bread and a shock of sour white grapefruit pith, blends in whole cloves and green apple to pear fruit scents, again there's not a lot of give and what is there evacuates in a straight line. Medium-bodied, the carbonation also has a tight weave to it, hints at foaming up but then pulls back. More than in the nose the orange marmalade to white grapefruit citrus is in clear control, tart, sour and bitter, omnipresent. Momentary brush of banana before meager pear, apple, pineapple fruit come on. Pine resin, coal tar and damp hay anchor it further onto the tongue. Hard to find any clear malt elements, perhaps some chocolate near the finish. A very muscular beer which makes you break a sweat with each sip."
"D - I love BPAs and BSPA and this representation of the style is very good. I can see why The Bruery is hyped so much. The flavors are nice and present on their own but also work so well together. Very delicious and refreshing beer and the ABV although high not insane and slightly unnoticeable."
"D- This is a great beer. On the mellow side, but the flavor isn't bland at all. Lots of interesting notes keeps me reaching for the glass again and again. Great fruitiness that is balanced out by the crisp/bitter finish. Nicely balanced. My favorite Belgian Strong so far (Sorry Duvel!). I will definitely buy this again."
"Nice."
"Overall, this just doesn't do it for me. I haven't liked any Belgian IPAs I've had. And this one adds some weird notes - rotten fruit, mint, soap and melon."
"D: Yes! I love thick, complex, alcohol-infused, tropical smoothies!"
"Simple yet complex...which of course makes no sense at all. The label totally gets it right: ""not quite evil, yet not to be trusted."" Definitely one of the best I've had from The Bruery so far. Hugely intriguing, hugely enjoyable. Glad it's a huge bottle."
"BeerAdvocate has a lame spell checker that does not allow loquat, transformative, pasley, yesterhour (hello? Yesteryear, ergo...) hoppyness or hoppiness. Nor does it allow Beeradvocate as a word. Shame, bros!"
"D: Ok, an interesting (though perhaps in many ways failed) take on the Belgian. I liked the fruit. Not sure that I would get it again though"
"D - Moderate to low. This is one complex brew, and a 750ml is my one night limit here..."
"Drinkability is ok, but not a great beer. It's mostly kind of hot, major cat tongue here, the biggest sweetness is the alcohol."
"For the price is it worth it? Eh, maybe."
"Drinks: light and summery, Mischief would be great on a hot day. I liked it better as an aromatic than a beer, however."
"Autumn Maple, 10% abv"
"D- I could easily drink multiple glasses. The ABV could get a little dangerous due to the easy drinking."
"Probably the winner of the night for me and most of the tasters. Very much like a more Belgian style IPA than Raging Bitch but tasted simialr. Awesome hop presence which I was suprised since I had no idea how old it was. Tons grassy earhty flavor from hop/belgian yeats combo. Paired with steak frites."
"750ml bottle $8. I picked this up because it was $2 off, why not? Hazy orange color, smells good, a little funky spice, oranges. The flavor is good and hoppy with a citrus flavor, spice, quite a nice beer indeed. In fact, this may be the best beer I have had from The Bruery so far."
"Seems they hit the target they were aiming for with this one, but I'm not a fan. Drinkability for hopheads is great, however."
"taste is somewhat sour, malt, a little yeast, sweet fruits, and a touch of banana, ends a bit on the oily side with some bitterness."
"crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel. admittedly not one of my favorite styles but i'd easily have it again."
"This is a nice crisp hopped up belgian that is pretty refreshing. It's enjoyable and drinks pretty good, but the alcohol is felt. Glad to have tried it."
"overall a perfect light ale for the summer, that 8.5 percent is nowhere to be found, i could have gone for more of this one."
"This is a very decent beer, but their interpretation of the belgian is so wildly carbonated, it seems a bit too much, even for a belgian strong. However, the flavor is good and the aroma is delightful, so it comes across as pretty damn drinkable."
"All in all, a very good beer that I would probably purchase again."
"A fantastic, ultra-hoppy Belgian-inspired ale. It'd be easy to call this a Belgian IPA, but it's not at only 35 IBUs. Instead, it's been hop-bursted and dry hopped to keep the hop flavor and aroma intense but with a mellow bitterness."
"-Gfunk"
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp and dry. This is a great belgian."
"D - A very good belgian pale with some nice complimentary hop flavors, a very good example of the style"
"Wow, I am in love with this beer."
"D - A little sweet for me, but overall quite a drinkable beer. Actually makes quite a nice lazy summer night beer."
"D= A well made beer that somehow fell a bit flat for me. I am a big fan of Belgian ales and am certainly not afraid of hops or the new Belgian/IPA beers, but this just missed my personal taste preferences. Having said that I don't regret buying this and would like to revisit it some other time."
"D- Fairly high. Could dial down the sweetness a bit. Still, an enjoyable beer."
"A celebration of hops, spices and Belgian yeast. Yum."
"$8 a bottle is worth it, I was leery at first, but this is definitely one of the best bottles available in Reno."
"D/O- This is definitely a well-crafted beer, but I can't say that I love it like so many of my fellow BAs. A decent Belgian IPA, but you can find better. Cheers."
"The NL win makes it that much better  "
"Pours slightly murky golden color. Aroma is mild but has a bit of citrus and yeast coming through. Flavor is much more complex - bits of apple, lemon yeast and some spices are all present. Well carbonated and fizzy as you sip - feels very nice going down. Would definitely drink this again. Very tasty!"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy pale amber color. Nose is tart apple. Flavor is tart citrus, some hoppiness. Lingering dry bitter aftertaste. Unusual golden. $8.99 for a 750ml bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA."
"Wish I had a slice of pizza right now; it would go perfectly."
"Overall, the smell had so much potential that the taste didn't deliver. Still good, and well worth trying."
"Hell, who knows. Maybe this beer has gone over. But if so, it is still pretty good."
"Mischief pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a voluminous and fine head that leaves lace like crazy. The aroma is surprisingly citrusy with lemon and orange marmalade mingling with some spicy Belgian yeast and pale malt sweetness. I take a sip and am surprised again. I was expecting this beer to be very Duvel-esc, but it is almost as if Duvel and an IPA had a baby. Orange, pear, coriander, a touch of clove, honey and herbal hops. There is a lot going on here. The one aspect of this beer that seems a bit one dimensional to me is the malt character. It is pretty much just pale and plain, but that is okay since it accentuates the hops and yeast. This beer has a medium mouthfeel that is fairly smooth and finishes fairly dry. It is almost as if it first coats my mouth then evaporates. It is an interesting and enjoyable texture. It would be more drinkable if the ABV did not show itself so well, but still goes down quite easy. The Bruery is two for two and I will be seeking out more of their offerings."
"D - Again, very crisp and refreshing. High drinkability. I was honestly shocked when I discovered the ABV on this one, could have easily killed a bottle by myself."
"Drinkability: Balanced; not overpowering despite its full flavor; highly drinkable"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, gently spicy of pepper, sweet up front, and dry in the finish."
"D - Once again The Bruery does it with a spicy, light-bodied beer that's incredibly drinkable. This one manages to hide 8.5% ABV very well. It needs more to it though. I just saw the bottle in stores back in Wisconsin though so I'd love to give it another go."
"A very nice beer with one unfortunate flaw. Unfortunately, that flaw bleeds through to several other areas, including drinkability - the lack of carbonation leaves it slightly unbalanced. I had no trouble drinking my glass, and enjoyed every sip, but I wasn't really craving another after finishing."
"Poured from a brown bomber, a deep yellow with orangish hue. Nice BPA foamy head and wonderful yeasty, bready aroma with lots of citrus orange character. Very sweet sugary smelling. Very sweet candy taste with lots of orange hoppy character. Very enjoyable. The hop character combined very nicely with the sweet maltiness of this Belgian."
"Drinkability- Not bad but the booze is a bit much for how delicate the beer is. The hops are still nice and fresh and fruity and everything fits nice except for the 8.5%. All and all very enjoyable but let's scale back the booze just a tinge. Thanks much Jeff!"
"D: This goes down easy. It is perhaps a bit too hoppy and heavily carbonated to drink all night (not to mention the 8% ABV)."
"Dry, sweet beer that has a good body and great mouthfeel. Seek it out."
"Pours golden with a beige head. Nose has herbal yeast, tropical fruits, peppery alcohol, grassy hops and caramel. Taste needs more hops. Lacks complexity. Light to medium body is way over carbonated. Not bad, but lacks any sort of depth. The Bruery can do much better."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Good for those who like their beers dry and earthy."
"D: Another high quality beer with a high quality rate of enjoyability and drinkability. dry and easily manageable despite its 8.5%ABV."
"F: Semi bitter, lingering citrus and pine, little orange and tangerine, creamy flavor lingering as well, chewy malts a bit, fruity and juicy flavors lingering, very dry and very slight astringent hops late. Some creamy Belgian malts and touch of sweetness but mostly dry."
"to go, because as the flavors fade, you really get a chance to explore what's going on with the hops. The body seems light and prickly at first, but yields to a soft, medium-bodied feel mid-palate. In terms of hoppy Belgians, this is one of the best American versions I've had."
"Wow, this is one of the first American brews that comes so close to a Belgian as to be virtually indistinguishable. Poured with a nice off white foamy frothy thick head and good lacing. Color is a lightly hazy amber. Aroma is great - spicy malty floral a bit of yeast. Flavor is similar Fairly dry but still a bit of sweetness, especially in the finish. Excellent body and carbonation as it fits the beer perfectly. Very easy drinking beer. Session."
"Drinkability: Well, this is one where miscategorization screws up my review a little. To me this is a Belgian IPA. Even so, there's still very little of the fruity complexity I was hoping for. Its a pretty damn hoppy IPA though, and a tasty beer."
"D: both myself and person I'm with are really enjoying this. Good offering by the bruery."
"D: drinks good and really surprising belgian style ale from the bruery. This is the second time I've had it and both have been great."
"By for one of my favorite belgian beers I have ever had!"
"Absolutely delicious - ordered a half-poor of the cask at the Linkery, only to order another one as soon as i finished my first. If I had a higher alcohol tolerance, I would drink these all day long. Amazing!"
"Easy tasting, easy drinking. Biscuit and yeast make up a decent backbone. Spice, white pepper, curacao and mint. The hops give a great snap to it and calm down the malt, but their flavors are small, thus not interrupting the dance of bread and spice. It's quite good. They did well with this one."
"D: A very good, easy drinking pale ale. However, I was expecting a little bit more Belgian funk along with a stronger flavor profile. Yet, this beer is clean, crisp, and the alcohol is virtually undetectable."
"This was a very tasty brew. I am normally not a fan of most Bruery stuff but this was very nice. Would drink again."
"Beer finishes slightly dry but it drinks great. Some citrus flavors in the mid-palate and there is some bitterness at the back that grows with the beer. No aftertaste and the finish is nice. I usually don't like my beers to finish too dry but this one does a nice job with it. Very wonderful beer."
"J"
"D - Overall a slight disappointment... Both the ""hoppy"" and ""tripel"" components of this offering underwhelm... HOwever, an excellent appearance and rather good quaffability keep this respectable... Not a bad offering, but this one could have been so much more..."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Mischief is definitely a beer that I will be purchasing again in the future. Recommended!"
"D- Worth trying once and coming back to later, alcohol is masked so it's easy to go through a few of these."
"This is an exceedingly light flavored beer if you discount the hops. The fermentation character is too light to stand up to the hops, despite the fact that the hop character is not overly aggressive here. All of this is despite the fact that I served this on the warm side. I do like the hop character here, it is perfect for a Pale Belgian beer of this strength, but it really needs some interesting yeast derived flavors to make this truly interesting. Despite all my complaining, this is actually a pretty tasty beer. There are no major flaws and it is hard to screw up bright hops, even if the background is a bit cleaner than I expected; really the fermentation character plays more of a supporting / subservient role than I was expecting, but does compliment the hops well."
"D - A solid example of the style, this beer is full of complex and bold flavors. The yeast is quite dominant in the flavor with a clove note that lasts through the finish. There is some fairly strong malt and a bit of fruity character, more in the aroma than flavor. An enjoyable beer, though the clove character gets a bit excessive toward the end of the glass. Another nice beer from the Bruery, though not as good as their saisons."
"Mischief is a nice release from The Bruery. I like it. I think it's more of a Belgian IPA than a BSPA, and should be characterized as such. Just my take. While it is very good, it could be better. More bitterness would be my first request. I like the hop flavor, but it's crying out for a little more bitterness. More carbonation would help, too. Having said that, it's far from flat. All in all, Mischief is good beer....whatever it is. Definitely one of the better beers from The Bruery I've had. Check it out if you have the opportunity."
"I found this to be extremely drinkable. Love the hop profile for this style."
"D: Really love this beer. Delicious. A new member of my staff."
"Drinkability: this is a nicely quaffable beer. Worthy of a try."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Much like your favorite Belgian pale ale. Huge thick fluffy head. Gorgeous beer. Smell is super citrusy - mostly orange - with a hint of something floral. Taste slams you with citrusy hops. This is hoppier than most IPA's! There is a slight hint of malty bread underneath. The mouthfeel is very nice and as expected for the style. The strong hops and high alcohol content hurt it's drinkability. This impulse buy was awesome. It's really a Belgian IPA and would surely be a hit with fellow hopheads."
"Drinkability: Agree with the other BAs that this is a Belgian IPA; I would argue that it is a Belgian take on a West Coast IPA as it has that wondrous floral grapefruity character to it"
"A Belgo-American take seems like an understatement here, as the hops were much so off the charts tasty and fresh. Much more so even than this being on draft. Really great stuff that put a fantastic American spin on an old classic."
"Purchased at Kahns for $9.99"
"I'm curious to try this again some day to see if the other beers I had unduly influenced my rating."
"D: An easy drinking Belgian strong/IPA, which has a refreshing element to it with an excellent balance in flavor that is not at all overpowering."
"Light to medium mouthfeel. Easy to drink and refreshing. The 8.5% is slightly noticable at first but then fades after further drinking. I would drink this one again for sure."
"D: You need to love bitterness and hops to enjoy this bad boy. The IBUs must be off the charts. Quite good to me."
"served in a small St. Bernie chalice at The Hive/Busy Bee, Raleigh"
"D - the nose is a little strong for me but it tastes so delicate and crisp but still packs a lot of flavor. I'm quite impressed."
"Bit of haze, coppery gold with a short whitish cap from a gentle pour. Fine bubbles formed a collar that produced some lace. Good head retention. Fruity aroma, nectarine and grapefruit, citrus rind, with a hint of biscuity malt and spice. The flavour was quite fruity up front too, more of the same grapefruit and citrus, but with more of a tropical character than the aroma. Bitterness was solid throughout and lingered in the grassy finish. Caramel sweetness appeared mid-palate and was joined by a bit of alcohol and spice towards the end. Light warmth, creamy carbonation, full bodied. I liked it quite a bit, but it seemed more like a Belgian IPA to me."
"D: No strong taste of alcohol, yet it is there and it hits you hard enough that you probably shouldn't finish the bottle alone in a short period of time."
"13oz weyerbacher tulip glass at Capone's with some very mild chicken wangs. Mischief pours the brightest straw yellow blond that I have seen in a long time, this is a bright looking beer. A frothy sticky head on top that sinks down but leaves a sheet of lace on the glass. Smells include alot of citrus with alot of lemon and some grapefruit. Come to think of it hops take up most of the smell including a floral scent. A small bready malt base and a Belgian yeast strain imparting some odd odors. Taste is a floral IPA with Belgian yeast. The hops take up room with grapefruit and floral notes. Im getting a huge amount of lemon. Some biscuit malt and a candi like vibe going. The feel is lighter than medium and the carb is quite pumped up. While the mouthfeel was great, the flavor just did not come together for me. Im all for this style but there are better ones out there, Belgian and American versions."
"Overall-Recommended to me in lieu of Stone Cali-Belgigue and it was a successful recommendation. I'll buy this again and recommend it as a great Belgian style IPA"
"D-Bright and sharp with a pleasant melding of flavours makes this one easy to enjoy. Maybe not quite as hop assertive as I would like but I cannot complain too much. A nicely done brew."
"Tastes like a beatifically balanced blend between spicy belgian yeast and old school, east coast american hops. Like Yuengling and white pepper with some light citrus nodes sneaking into the backend. And if that doesn't sound good to you, well, you and I have different tastes."
"Mouthfeel is thin and crisp but with a substantial feeling in the middle. Carbonation is moderate for the style. I liked this beer but I would rather drink a plain Belgian Pale Ale. Glad I got to try it though, and I enjoyed the 750."
"Pours a cloudy amber with fluffy white head, settled to an inch and turned the whole side of the glass white with thick lace. Tons of yeast sediment.... and there it goes, a delayed gusher. The second glass is just plain murky. Smell: very musty, sweet pale malt, spicy, floral, cantaloupe, orange. Taste: pineapple core, orange citrus, a little sugared grapefruit, spicy. It's quite hoppy. Sweet pale and sugar, a little funk and pear at the end of the sip. Medium bodied, somewhat fluffy feel, with a dry finish. I was excited to try this, then not so excited after the pour, but it ended up being very tasty. But I'm not sure you can call this a BSPA with all of the American hops in here... it doesn't exactly fit the description on the label either, bottle conditioning can be fun."
"D - Exceptionally easy drinking Belgian strong pale ale. Alcohol is noticeable but restrained...lots of complex hop character, good malt in the background and just enough Belgian-ness. The Bruery gets plenty of hype, but for me anyway, they pretty much hit the mark with very few exceptions. This is another great one, I'm very happy to have readily available to me. Thanks Patrick!"
"Very tasty, highly drinkable and interesting beer. Always nice to get something pleasantly unexpected in a new beer experience. Would recommend giving it a try."
"Notes: If I had been rating this purely to style, the rating would have to be a lot lower, as it's not ""Belgian"" enough to be a BSPA. It seems to me to be a good unfiltered, bottle conditioned American IPA. With some little Belgian characteristics. The last pour with the dregs adds more bitterness and an even smoother mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is awesome with a lot of citrus hop character. The flavor is Belgian yeast, pepper and orange and grapefruit hops. For a Belgian-styled beer, this has a ton of hop character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the best hoppy Belgian beers I have tried."
"Taste was fantastic! This is probably my favorite beer from The Bruery. It is smooth, sweet, and citrusy without being annoying. Perfect summer beer! Down side is that it is a limited offering, I hope its around a bit longer or becomes a seasonal."
"(D)- An interesting combination in a beer. Golden, yet hopped almost to IPA standards. Crisp & refreshing. A fun beer to enjoy for spring."
"Drinkability: Such an amazing beer. This is by far my favorite beer from the Bruery. I'm so glad I have access to it locally. I will be buying a lot more of this."
"Poured a golden color into tulip glass. Smell of fruits and slight hint of hops. Taste is a mellow hoppy flavor. Nice mouthfeel that doesn't overwhelm. Good drinkability that is nice to the palate. Overall, I good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I was expecting more hoppiness but the mellow IPA taste has a good mouthfeel to it."
"This is a real winner from the guys out west. It's not quite a Belgian IPA but for those of us who like 'em this is an excellent slightly subdued take on the style."
"I am pretty upset that this is listed as a ""brewed once"" offering. Patrick needs to reconsider this. Great beer."
"Overall drinkability is quite nice - I'd recommend pairing it up with some sharp, tangy cheese, as this could easily be classified as a Belgian IPA."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very nice drinking beer. It tasted more along the lines of a Belgian IPA then a strong pale but that was fine with me since the hops were delicious."
"This beer is a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and 8.5%. It poured a deep pee yellow and was a bit cloudy. It had a good thick head on it as well. It smells like American hops- pineapple, grapefruit, pine and it tasted like hops- citrus, pine. It had a slightly sweet and light flavor and finished dry- the alcohol is well hidden in this one."
"The yeast makes the mouthfeel a bit funny. It's a bit much. Still, a good, interesting Belgian-style beer from The Bruery."
"Like I mentioned above, what a perfect beer for a perfect Sunday. After this I'm ready to go dig out my shorts and get ready for beer festival season. As far as drinkability goes, I'm going to rate it based off your hop tolerance because its loaded with them. But the same time this doesn't kill your taste buds with the bitterness because the candy sugar and yeast moderate it very well. So if you want to step out of the normal IPA and enjoy triples go for it because this is an amazing hybrid beer which I hope to drink plenty more of. At $14 bucks a bottle I feel its a solid purchase compared to the quality, quantity and ABV."
"D- Such a clean finish. This drinks like the best of them. The alcohol is virtually unnoticeable."
"D-a great summer beer. I don't mind going through a big bottle of this by myself."
"Drinkability is incredible I'm sippin' on these without fear. I know this brand will be around much longer than the current appreciation level found for this Placentia, CA brewery. Grassroots and homegrown have worked for these guys, I can't get enough keep sending it my way to Ohio.."
"Drinks very nicely. Refreshing with a nice crisp hoppy bite. I'm admittedly not a huge fan of belgian IPAs and overhopped belgian pales, but this is quite drinkable and seemingly balanced despite the full hop profile. I'm not sure about the off 'infected' presence of plastic fumes, and am curious to try another bottle in the hopes that it's a handling or one-time problem with this bottle."
"Drinkability: Good-pleasant to drink, taste good and 2-3 glasses go down comfortably. Like a lot of Bruery beers it's a bit different, for the style, but still very good."
"D: A Belgian IPA in every sense but a very good one -- none of the overwhelming sourness that hits this style and while the hops are still frontmost, the malts are given a chance to shine and just about steal the show."
"Thanks to brewtull. Sparkling and bright, a pale beer with superior foam. Pleasant and intense American hop aroma, backed by a biscuity Belgian pale malt body. Some very sharp peppery notes too. Really gentle bitterness isn't what i was expecting from the big hop aroma, but it works well. It was very good when cold, but as it warmed it opened up into a more tart flavor with a bigger and much less carbonated body which became a challenge to finish (drank a bottle in probably an hour). Glad I got to try it but probably won't get this again."
"Bruery Mischief is pale, peppery, and dry. It poured cloudy straw, with a massive pillowy head. It left thick sticky lace throughout the glass. The smell was citric; the taste acidic, like lemon rind, with a peppery finish. The feel was bubbly with an extremely dry finish. Although very attractive in a tulip-shaped glass, Mischief has a feel and finish like sparkling wine."
"D: Not bad at all. It has room to improve in my eyes but it is easy drinking and isn't a bad beer by any stretch. Its highly drinkable beside the carbonation issue. Has a nice balance to it and the hoppy aroma is damned fine. A solid offering but I was expecting a bit more."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, pale malt scent along with a wonderful bouquet of aroma hops. It's incredibly dry with a light Belgian yeast character. The taste is good. It has a nice pale malt flavor; dry and crisp. The hops are ever present, yet not too intense. It's wonderfully balanced with a light Belgian yeast fruitiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinker. It's a well brewed Belgian pale with some excellent hop character; another quality beer from the Bruery."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and goes down well. Some aftertaste does linger but does not ruin your mouth with abrasive flavors. Pretty good beer."
"This is dangerously drinkable - hoppy, aromatic, and smooth. It's a well-done American, hoppy take on a Belgian Strong Pale!"
"I might retag it is a belgian (american) pale ale. Not a belgian ipa, but more of a pale. Well balanced beer that is different."
"Like any beer from this ""Bruery"" I would recommend."
"Pours a dirty golden brown color with a wispy and webby pure white head that left some clingly lacing. The aroma is sweet with tropical fruit and pineapple aromas, some pepper and a floral hop. The taste starts off with a floral and citrus hops flavor, not too strong but noticable. This is followed by a sweet pineapple flavor along with pepper. There is some candy like sweetness but it is not cloying and is offset with some hoppy bitterness. It could use some more yeasty flavors, seems to be a bit lacking in that department. The brew has a moderate feel with rather soft carbonation, well balanced though finishes slightly bitter. Definitely a hop forward BSPA, with american hop flavors. The brew is sweet and fairly light which gives it that Belgian PA characteristic but needs more yeasty goodness."
"D: Very good. A little more alcohol presence in the taste than I would've liked but certainly not a deal breaker, at all. Nice!"
"D: Very enjoyable to drink and it would be easy to put back a few glasses of this."
"D: Very drinkable for 8.5%, as expected for a 'devil' beer. Some odd flavors going on but definitely an interesting brew."
"D-this is like a fantastic American IPA. its so creamy with a nice lighter body to make it go down so easy. the juicy tropical fruit dominates but is held in check by a light belgian yeast that gives it the only trace of its style origins."
"D – A nice brew, sort of straddling the the gap between Belgium and California in style and taste. The Bruery is very impressive."
"Know what? This is the perfect Belgian IPA. Hoppy. Distinctly Belgian."
"d - Overall this was a solid Belgian style ale. I was expecting more hops and less malt smell and taste, but it was still very enjoyable and smooth. Very easy to drink and I would definitely try again."
"750mL bottle picked up in Chicago for $9.99. A beautiful bottle as always with the Bruery, and the beer itself is nice too. Hazy golden color with about 2 fingers of white foam, vast webs of lace. The aroma is sort of like a muted Belgian IPA, some grassy hops and light fruits (pear, peach, maybe mango), a little earthy too. Really nice, and the taste follows the same profile. Pale malts might be responsible for the mild sweetness in the taste, in any case it's balanced well against the Belgian hops flavors. Not very bitter, a lot of grass and tropical fruits, excellent."
"This beer poured a cloudy amber color and formed a huge foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided acting much like a float. A heavy amount of carbonation can be slightly seen. An aroma of malt, hops, pine, citrus and candy. The flavor was of malt, hops, pepper and candy. The body was medium light and the finish slightly sweet and sprite. An alright beer, but not a strong representation of the style."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a 2 inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, pineapple, orange peel and some bready malt. Taste is fruity and hoppy. There's tropical fruit, pine and citrusy hops, peppery spice, and some bready malt flavors that I notice. There's also a light lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's refreshing and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good, solid overall brew. I liked it."
"Taste is"
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good beer. Sitting here I can definitely feel the alcohol warming on my through, however. I find this odd because I can't taste the alcohol but I can feel the after effects (which feels good on this cool evening sitting outside). Overall though, this beer fails to genuinely impress me. I am still trying to find myself a Bruery beer that will genuinely knock my socks off and this one, while good, did not do that."
"Ratings re evaluated and adjusted 12.30.14"
"D - Enjoyable from start to finish, worth having again. A strong example of the ""hoppy Belgian"" subgenre."
"Alcohol is only slightly apparent. This is a delicious brew and even though it was a pale ale, was still much more hoppy than I expected. I've been impressed with the few offerings I've had from the Bruery, and this one takes the cake so far."
"Poured a dirty gold with good head that died slowly and left lace patches. Sour smell coupled with some sharp hops and citric notes and a touch of sugary malt. Light to medium body with some tart fruit notes along with the spices and orange/citric note. Little prickly, my only complaint is that the malts are a little subdued and it lent a somewhat sour, tart backbite. Still, a good beer to enjoy sipping on."
"Pours a cloudy orange yellow color with a certain glow. A medium sized and very sticky peach toned head sits atop of the brew. Piney, resinous fresh hops, orange/grapefruit peel, marshmallow and a fruity yeast note. More of a Belgian style IPA to me, very hop driven and mouth tingling spicy, a long aftertaste of orange rind and sweet malt finish things up. The high-er alcohol content is apparent but not completely threatening, good drinkability for its size, quaffable. A must try for fans of the style and the brewery."
"I did enjoy the beer and I do prefer the juicy tropical hop flavors in my IPA's so while it was an enjoyable beer, a BSPA it is not."
"D: This is a fantastic beer. Great take on the style, nicely blended and love the hop character of this beer. Enjoying a few pints of this is a must!"
"Mouthfeel is kind of playful. It feels light and airy but still has some body to it. Drinkability is good and the alcohol is well hidden."
"d: if I didn't know I wouldn't say that this is a 8.5% very well hidden. I'd also have more of it if it wasn't an 8.5%..."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Smells of some bright hop aromatics initially, but these seem to fade as it warms. Semi-sweet apples and booze come out as it comes closer to room temp with some general belgian fruity esters and bread. Taste is similar, a little more yeasty (tons of sediment in this bottle towards the bottom). A little bready maltiness with some earth leads to a drying, biting, semi-medicinal spice note in the finish. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. I drank the whole 750mL myself but it got to be a bit of a chore towards the end. Interesting enough but not one of my favorites from the Bruery so far. Might be better on tap or with a fresher bottle after they continue to perfect the recipe."
"Overall, a little let down by this beer, started off so nice with that great fresh hop aroma but the taste and feel just couldn't match..."
"A refreshing and fruity Belgian ale with a hefty hop profile, this is another winner from the Bruery."
"D: Very tasty, and the alcohol is well hidden. Overall very enjoyable"
"By the end of the bottle the pours got darker with an orange cloud as more yeast was disturbed. This gave a further complexity that I really enjoyed. The alcohol was also present but did not take anything away from the beer. I would recomend this beer as well as purchase more."
"I'm glad I tried this since I really respect The Bruery and it continues their tradition of well crafted beers, but this beer is a bit lacking in the complexity department. It's good, but not impressive. Don't anctipiate buying again."
"Pours a golden amber with a rich, frothy head. Some scattered lace remains as the head diminishes. A prominent hop nose that is floral upfront, but bouquet of herbs and citrus fruit with a Belgian yeasty spiciness. Creamy and soft, medium carbonated and bodied.Tastes of biscuit malt, oranges, and some caramel sweetness. Herbal hop flavor takes over and lends a clean and dry bitterness that is not harsh at all. Faint alcohol on the breath. Flavor profile slanted towards the hoppy side, and in a good way. An intriguing Belgian style that is hoppy enough but has just the right malt sweetness to keep the drinker coming back for more. Well crafted and highly enjoyable."
"Very smooth on the palate. and easily drinkable."
"Overall: Flavor not as hoppy and smell, but flavor still enjoyable."
"I like it, but honestly, don't love it."
"Overall this is another in the line of Bruery beers that don't disappoint. The flavors all play off each other surprisingly well and this is worth a shot."
"Oh, but the mouthfeel was brilliant. Go figure."
"Slow, careful pour produces a hazed golden orange with a small frothy white head that settles in a thick ring and sheets of sticky lacing. Musty, earthy aroma mild citrus hoppiness with underlying malty sweetness and light rubbing alcohol smell. Medium thick body, light carbonation, very soft smooth texture; not quite expected for this style. Body has strong malt and Belgian yeast background with a musty, citrus hop flavor that lingers throughout the finish. The flavor isn't very complex and the finish is a musty, earthy mess; not very pleasant. Not the worst Bruery beer I've had, but I'm having a hard time finishing this bottle and am not really enjoying this. Typical."
"D: The decreased yeast component really bumps this beer up a few notches for me. I find it to be much more enjoyable and the esters and spice don't conflict with the hop character."
"Bottle courtesy Sam. Pours a hazy dark gold color with a frothy wet white head. Nice citrus hop aroma, grapefruit and orange with banana and apple ester notes. Fruit salad with phenolic spices. Soft fleshy fruit flavor, pears, apples, not so hoppy in flavor but there's a lingering grassy bitterness. Very drinkable, no alcohol presence. A solid hoppy Belgian pale."
"D- Goes down super-smooth, especially for the ABV. A Belgian style pale ale with American hops... wonderful."
"Overall I will be drinking this a lot. Don't cellar it or you will loose all that hop aroma and flavor. Good thing I grabbed a bunch of bottles at the brewery because I am gunna like havin this around. I'm drinking this whole bottle by myself."
"This is a great tasting beer, very nicely hopped with fresh American hops, and fruity yeast. It has a balanced sweetness, and is very drinkable. I am salivating for the next swallow."
"Highly recommended!"
"Well crafted, and fairly unique, though (not surprising for The Bruery) style-bending."
"D- Very drinkable, went back to this beer several times during the celebration. Easy session beer with tons of flavor, my brothers favorite beer besides the black tuesday and papier."
"The flavor is earthy hops with an upper low bitterness, notes of orange and grapefruit, wheat, Belgian yeast, and lemon."
"Drinkability is very high. This is a great beer overall."
"Cloudy and a darker yellow color. The theme in this Belgian blond is hops, and you can smell them and taste them in this beer. It's a little sweet and holds some dry biscuit malt to hold the beer in place. Clean hoppiness all the way around. Alcohol remains hidden. For a hophead, this is a nice twist on the usual hoppy beer."
"Crystal-clear straw colored body with a thick white foamy head. Super hoppy aroma. Some sweet malt aroma witj some light fruitiness. Surprisingly sweet light flavor finishes with a touch of bitterness. Very light bodied. Aftertaste a strange combination of sweet and bitter where both are distinct."
"Reviewed on 12/6/2009. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a cloudy light orange with a small white head. Aroma of citrus, light fruitd (melon in particular), and even some spicy hops. Flavor of plenty of citrus and melon notes as well as Belgian yeast. Very drinkable and tasty! Nice flavor profile too."
"Mini growler fill from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours light golden, with some moderate cloudyness, off white head, that leaves nice light sheeting and well developed low lacing. Fruity nose overlaying some citric hoppyness. This one comes over like a hopped up Belgian IPA, pineapple, grapefruit, crisp hoppyness quite bold and evident. Dry, citric and tasty, with Belgian yeastyness floating in and out and all around. Enjoyable Americanized version of classic Belgain beer, one of my favorite things."
"I thought the 8.5 was really well hidden. The beer was crisp, refreshing, felt like a session beer, really drinkable."
"Hop forward medium body with a ton of dry earthy bitterness balanced by a prominent citrus sweetness. Dank oily resinous hops with a lot of lemon peel, grapefruit and mango, countered by a very subtle graham cracker/biscuit malt presence. Lots of earthy pine notes provides a nice dryness that lasts throughout, providing balance to the sweet notes. Slight alcohol presence comes through mid-palate and lingers into the finish. There's also a bit of estery Belgian yeast that provide some light fruit notes, especially apple, pear and grape. Pretty complex with a nice combination of west coast IPA and Belgian Pale Ale characteristics. The 8.5% ABV is decently masked, making this beer relatively drinkable. Very good!"
"The pour is hazy yellow with a thin, soapy head. Not terribly impressive, but that's the only part of the beer I can say that about. The nose is absolutely glorious - citrus dry hop character with orange, tangerine and a touch of yeast in the back. A mild sweetness is present, bringing to mind a fruity orange-lemon marmalade. Awesome stuff. The flavor is just as good, opening with plenty of hop flavor with citrus, honey and a touch of floral character. Honey-like with ripe orange and plenty of tropical fruit and a touch of spice (white pepper). The finish is dry and fruity with orange and a touch of jackfruit. With low bitterness, a light body that's a tad slick and very soft palate, this is one enjoyable - and drinkable - beer."
"Well carbonated. Nice."
"D: My favourite of this series so far, you could almost call this Humulus Mischief because of the hop profile, much different than #1 or #2."
