"Finishes with an outstanding malt supported bitterness, which occupies the tongue for quite a time."

"Overall: The first sip was a shock. Expected it to follow the nose but it was harshly bitter and dry. Very grassy and spicy with mostly clove. After it warmed up a bit, the taste mellowed out and became very pleasant. Pouring the second half of the bottle in smooths out the taste and brings up more fruitiness and spices. In the end it turned out to be quite flavorful and complex. Would recommend to have this one."

"On tap at the Bier Stein yesterday.  Very complex nose and flavor profile, with considerable spice (clove and nutmeg in particular), but with a very dry citrus and white pepper bitterness on the finish.  On the palate, you initially get considerable tropical fruit, but that's quickly pushed aside by the dry, hoppy, spiced fused finish.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and drinkability is excellent (though with all the different flavors in this beer, it's one you want to savor, appreciate and enjoy.).   Really a nice beere from De Dolle."

"Medium bodied with lively carbonation, this is another fine brew from De Dolle."

"The taste is light and fruity at first with interesting tropical and citrus blend of flavor that has a mild spice element with herbal hop taste and gentle white grape coming from the yeast. There is a slight pepper aspect and mild lemon rind which is palatable with mild herbal bitterness coming through with a very dry crisp finish which is mostly yeast driven, however a subtle tropical taste of golden grapefruit is present. Overall a wonderful Belgian pale to quaff -very easy to drink considering the 8%, the only attribute that is lacking is taste slightly but I can only imagine how much better this was when fresh -outstanding!"

"Seemed pretty farmhouse, saison-like.  Nose of Belgian yeast/saison.  Taste very earthy/grassy/hay and dry."

"Pours a hazy gold orange with a large white fluffy head some lacing. Aroma and Taste begins with nice dose of citrus, Belgian yeast and fruity notes followed by a bit of biscuit malt, sweet spices and a zesty tangy lightly spiced hops bitterness on the end for balance. Palate is a medium to full body, crisp with good carbonation. The end much the same as taste, citrus, Belgian yeast, and sweet zesty, tangy spiced hops bitterness with some biscuit malt. Overall a very pleasant, flavorful and tasty brew. I would drink again."
""
""
"Normal pour fills 2/3 of the glass with a dense white foam, even surface, close to zero lacing, retention is very good though. Cloudy liquid with a healthy amount of particulate, golden orange in color, could be rust water, huge amount of visible bubbles, wall-to-wall activity. The nose has a rough texture to it, wheat and grains, earth and peppercorns before slightly softening into banana, white grape and apricot pits, not that sweet and the clove to nutmeg spice could show more oomph, stays within itself well. In the mouth it’s full-bodied and tends to be bottom heavy, the carbonation is indeed strong so it makes you imagine what the feel would be like without it. Much more floral here with lemon accents, the clove stronger as well. For all the sweetness in the pear, yellow apple, apricot to banana fruit, dryness takes over past the mid-palate. Hay, quinine, spent lees, iron flecks, sort of heads in many directions at once. Astringent ending but can’t call it herbaceous nor really green in any manner. Seems to unclench some as it warms so may be one to linger over rather than quaff with abandon."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while but there are better choices within the style."

"Another nice Belgian beer, fruity with plenty of citrus & pineapple the highlights. Easy to drink due to the fact that the alcohol hidden for the most part with only faint hints of it appearing in places; this one is a beer worth trying if you get the chance."

"Poured a very pretty gold with mild haze adorned with a large white head that lasted quite a while. A fairly complex nose. Honeycrisp apples, bartlett pears, touch of riesling, clove, white pepper, and apricots. Maybe some golden raisins too. There's a lot going on here. Bit of earthiness (not like the lambic kind though), it's tough to explain that one. Maybe from the hop variety they use. But the beer is superbly smooth and drinkable. Quite a fantastic beer."
""
""
"Overall - My third variety of beer from this brewer, and they have all been amazing. Another world class beer from one of my favourite belgian brewers. Great mix of flavours and a textbook example of the style."
""
"D- Decently drinkable beer. Somewhere in between a session beer and a sipper for me ... don't necessarily know what occasion i'd recommend it for."
""
"O: this was by no means a bottle in tip-top shape, but it's a credit to De Dolle that this beer still turned out to be tasty, refreshing, and enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose and taste are like a mixed fruit bowl that has been plunged into a bath of yeast, then had pepper dusted onto it before someone squirts lemon juice all over it. Now boil it and take out the lumpy bits, add some hops re-boil, allow it to settle in a bottle for a while and then it's ready to drink."

"Served in beautiful Oerbier stemware - bright golden-straw body, thick endless white foam which enhances the beautiful appearance and feel of this beer. Nice notes of citrus, peppercorn, champagne, spice, clove and yeast. Sparkling carbonation - really nice stuff"
""

"Superb beer, a Belgian Strong Pale Ale that is hard to beat. Hoppy as a Belgian IPA and amazingly fruity. Complex and still very easy to drink. Dangerous beer."
""
"This was a bit of a gusher. It was very heady and took multiple times to pour it. The head has a slightly soapy taste. The beer is fairly bitter which is uncommon for this style. Very sappy, resins tasting. There is a fruit under taste, slight carbonation while I drink, but that could be from the 10 minutes it took to pour. Overall, not too bad of a beer."

"Pours cloudy golden with a head that explodes up the glass. Took a while to get the whole bottle poured. Maybe there’s soap in this thing? Aroma is banana, clove, funky yeast, and an unpleasant bitterness. Flavor feels overly spiced and bitter (not in a hops way, but in a licking a shoe way). Hint of banana, but finishes with a funky aftertaste. Not a drain pour since it cost me $5.50, but this thing just tastes dirty. No date on the bottle, so maybe this is just a bad bottle."

"This ale has so much going on and possesses so much quality that it needs to be tried by anyone who crosses its path."
"I had this beer on tap at the Beer Trappe in Lexington, KY. It pours golden yellow into a snifter, with a minimal lacy head. This beer is all about the nose. Lemon predominates over pears, apples, and clove spiced bread. Wonderful! The initial taste is honey sweet fruit but finishes moderately bitter and dry. The bitterness is a surprise after the smell and initial taste and does not perfectly imtegrate with the initial impression. The mouthfeel is smooth and light but astringent at the end, like a dry wine or cider. I believe this beer is worth a try just for the smell."
""
""
"Unique in the dominance of resin and one of the more bitter examples of the style I've experienced. Balance is decidedly hops, though more bittering than flavoring. Good Belgian ester presence. More bitter than I prefer."

"O: A great Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Balanced sweetness, complex, and easy to drink."
"O: Quite tasty. This would probably be better fresh, but it's still drinking great right now. Regardless, this is one of those mildly strange beers that really makes you contemplate it. Think of it as Duvel's slightly loopy but lovable younger brother."

""
""

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."

"Undoubtedly a geeky beer in my opinion, hard to fully appreciate. The beer is about as fresh it can be at the moment, and rigid to drink in big gulps, even though I would love to. As the spring is about to arrive here in New York, I can't help but to envision sitting with a tall tulip glass of this, enjoying one of the earliest balmy spring suns. To sum the appraise, this beer is original, complex and highly aromatic. http://quaffable.org/?p=563"

"I picked up a nice orange marmalade note on this brew. Totally dig it. I've had plenty of Belgians before, but what struck me about this one was how well-balanced it was - from start to finish, none the typically distinguishing characteristics overpowered it. Extremely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a perfect level of moderate to lively carbonation. The liveliness of the carbonation assists in moving the flavors of this strong brew across the tongue without becoming taxing. I would love to be able to definitively state how old this brew is but of course, such a means is not precisely documented. I can hardly make out a marking on the neck of the bottle that reads 350 07 which makes me think this was a 2007 best by date. Regardless, the age is felt in this with the oxidative touch and visually the bottle is stained in the familiar pattern conducive of a beer that has been resting for quite some time. Plain and simple, I need to buy more of this and drink it instead of laying it aside for years at a time."
""
""
""
"Overall. An interesting and tasty beer."
"O: nice bitterness, but lacks a bit of complexity"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white and rocky head. In the aroma, notes of fruitiness and candy sugar. In the taste, yeasty dryness, and a dryer candy sugar, with notes of fruit. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry candy sugar presence in the aftertaste. Quite nice and kind of simple, light nose and flavors, but nice nonetheless."

"Overall (2.5): Something tells me I got a very old bottle of this beer. It tastes oxidized with some odd, phenolic notes in the nose and on the palate. Looking over some other reviews, what I’m tasting, seeing, and smelling doesn’t resemble what others seem to have had very much at all. My guess is that this is an off and / or old bottle. I’d really like to revisit this sometime with a bottle that I know is fresh."
""
"O - A very good beer, with the highlights being the appearance, inviting aromas and balanced flavors. Harsh mouthfeel is the only detractor."
"This is a very tasty brew. Very smooth, medium bodied, easy to drink, medium carbonation, and very delicious. I am very happy to be enjoying a tulip of this beer. Another solid Belgian beer to cross off the list."
"O: Very drinkable. Something between a Strong Pale Ale and a Belgian IPA. Reminded me Duvel, but a super-spiced version of. Absolutely great Belgian beer"
"O - Another interesting brew from a very good brewery, though not my favorite from them. The earthy bitterness and the fruitiness didn't seem as harmonious as they could have been, but I would still have this again."
""

"I popped the top and the foam charges out the bottle. Lively carbonation makes a spectacle of the yeast bits floating up and down the glass. Big ‘ol textured head doesn't quit. Nose is deep, rich, and fruity: apple pie, tart grapes, buttered rolls; taste follows suit and is oh so smooth – mouthfeel is superbly smooth with a quick effervescent punch and a decadent finish. Good stuff –I wasn’t sure what kind of beer this was at the shop, but I couldn’t resist the funky label."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy golden amber color with an awesome 3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big grape, tart apple, pear, pepper, hay, grass, bread, earth, light funk, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon, pepper, grape, pear, apple, herbal, floral, earth, hay, grass, bread, and yeast spices. Dry, spicy, and slightly tart on the finish; with lingering notes of grape, pear, lemon, pepper, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity. Highly carbonated and medium bodied; with a very crisp and slightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Very easy to drink; with hardly any alcohol warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale! Great flavor complexity and balance; and extremely easy to drink. Outstanding."

"D- recategorize this one as a Belgian ipa and I'm all for it. Not what I expect from a BSPA. I'm sure it was dry hopped and all that jazz and being so hop forward it would be nice to have it labeled as such. Love this brewery though."
"pour is a transparent color with PBS of tight fluffy head. The nose is very nice, lots of spicy yeast, great earthy leather note, underlying caramel and sticky malt. Flavores are the same, bright lemon and golden apricots in back. Well integrated, dry, light body, soft carb. Great beer!"
"Pours a fantastic tawny straw color into my Chimay goblet. The head on it somehow manages to come out perfectly flat and hanging off the side of the glass like icing on a layer cake. There is some fine sediment present in the glass. Aroma - hints of fruit (banana, cherry, pear, and tangy orange) as well as some faint hops, a grainy, yeasty character, and the alcohol acidity is clear as well. The flavor is softer than the aroma suggests... it's very balanced and smooth. The dominant bready malts are glossed over lightly with sweet apple and tart flavors. Alcohol is hardly noticed. The mouth feel is light, but 'creamy' as well. The finish has a pleasant tingling sensation as the slight bitterness comes out. Another great selection from De Dolle. I am thinking that this brewery can do no wrong."
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic beer, I'm really glad that I was able to pick one up. Too bad it's too rare and pricey or I'd drink this much more often. It may not be the best comparison, but this is like a richer, and more decadent version of Duvel. Very well done."
"M: complex sensation formed by bitterness that remains through the end for a very lasting and astringent end."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is my favorite part of any De Dolle brew- VERY LIVE. Very exciting; it tingles all the way through. Light bodied and heavily carbonated. As I've said with my other reviews of De Dolle, BUY THIS BEER IF YOU CAN FIND IT!"
""
""
"O: Not sure its worth $5.50 a bottle (11.3 oz.). Maybe its better on tap, it isnt a bad beer just dont understand all the hype."
""
""
"Crisp and slightly tart, there's a strong fruity character, with some cookie sweetness underneath and a touch of herbal bitterness. Apricot, golden raisin, plum or peach pits, dusty bubblegum, honey shortbread. Effervescent and highly charged. ABV is completely hidden. A benchmark BPA, a classic to return to again and again."
"O: Really great beer! This is absolutely smashing and super drinkable. A must have!"
"D - Very high. This would make an awesome summer beer in that it is complex and tasty, yet light and refreshing."

"Overal a nice beer, complex."
"A benchmark BSPA for sure, and just another fantastic beer from De Dolle."
"O: A really unique beer which is definitely worth revisiting every so often for its near-perfect feel and floral honeylike sweetness. De Dolle no doubt knows what they're doing."
"O - Just a great beer. Its all been said already. If you can find it aquire it. Totally worth it. Another fantastic beer from De Dolle."
"Consumes like a ""session"" beer. Super easy drinking. "
"O: Decent/good. A bit too bitter for me regarding the style. I like bitter beers, but the bitterness doesn't fit so well in this one."
"Apparently only getting about half a beer tonight. Popped the top and beer went everywhere. Evidently some serious bottle carbonation going on here. Pours a dark brown with a nice huge head that went everywhere. Head sticking around for a decent amount of time. Nice and tasty aroma with sweetness and malt on the back end. Flavor is amlty but definitely noticeable alcohol on the end. Color is fairly cloudy. Great beer."
"Dr: Fairly high ABV with very easy drinkability. The price is rather high, but then I got it in Denmark."
"As with all De Dolle beers, this is a ridiculous gusher. Pours at about a 98-2 foam to beer ratio, and that's not an exaggeration. Doesn't matter how cold you chill it, it could be a half-frozen slush and still manage a huge mountain of suds. After a requisite waiting/re-pouring period, I am looking at a golden-orange liquid, completely opaque, with a dense, creamy off-white head. Aroma is big on spices, with coriander and clove leading the way. Yeast and light fruity hops as well. Flavor is lightly tart with some apricot, orange peel, and yeast. Solid hoppiness, floral with a light bitterness. Dry palate with a bit of peppery alcohol. Lively carbonation, obviously. A very nice strong golden ale."
"O) Another excellent beer from De Dolle. This one is tougher to find, but worth the effort."
"overall: i had a little moment with this beer. it just reminded me of how very much i love beer... and why. haven't had much from de dolle, however, will try anything i can get my hands on after this brew. :) ahh. content."
"Overall: One word: beauty"
"Normally a fan of tart and sour character, but found it too overbearing and adversely impacting on the yeast and ester profile."
"O - The bitterness of the enormous head here has totally overwhelmed the more subtle flavours of the bier. First time I've ever drank some water in the middle of a review to try to get a better grasp of the flavours but it still doesn't completely eliminate the bitterness. I'm sure there's a really good bier under the bitterness but it's not coming through today."
"No slouch here but doesn't deliver the goods as promised."
"Notes: ""An arabier is a pure malt beer 8°vol/alc brewed with flower Nugget-hops from Poperinge. It has the special dry-hopping taste and aroma, so appreciated by beer lovers all over the world. It is one of the two main beers from De Dolle Brouwers throughout the year. Aging time is limited due to the fact that hop bitterness is declining with the time. Store arabier cool and dark and serve cool at 10°C. """
"Pours a darker coppery amber color, huge plume of prickly white bubbles, akin to many bottle conditioned beers, retention leaves about a half centimeter of bubbled and some nice sticky lacing. Scent is quite a blend of sour over rippened fruit, day old bread and over kiln dried grain with a faint hint of earthy must. Taste moved in quite a different direction from scent - the dominant flavor is dry stale bread, but without the yeasty kick. The background has minimal notes of sour over rippened fruit and lightly toasted grain. Only a touch of honey and butter - the lack of sweetness leads to a lingering earthy quality. Medium bodied, very dry on palate, carbonation active for most of glass. The dry breadyness of the beer did not work that well with the perceived over rippened fruit notes, leaving my palate somewhat disapointed, especially after the solid nose."
"Though it's a completely different beer and not quite in the same league, Arabier reminds me of Orval with its dryness and drinkability. Great stuff."
"Pours a clear golden color that is a bit dark for the style, though not too much. Massive white head with some good lacing on the way down. The nose carries quite a bit of bread along with a very mild yeast presence. Flavor continues like this. It's simple -- which isn't necessarily a problem with the style -- but it gets the proportions wrong. The taste is too bready without any of the light stone fruit I'd like, or really much yeast character at all. The breadiness makes it too thick and chewy, and there's not as much carbonation as I'd like. With that said, it's still a well-made beer that I wouldn't complain about drinking again."
"Overall: Okay. It's interesting enough with its complexities for a dose and a bit champagne-like in texture, filling me up with gas, so I can skip lunch -- no, sir, there will be no need of Panda Express today."
"Pours a nice, slightly hazy yellow-amber with a VERY thick off-white head that is quite frothy and sticks around for a while. Be careful when pouring this or you’ll get foam from hell to breakfast! Aroma is not strong, but it is pleasingly malty and fruity and a little yeasty. Fruity, malty flavor has a surprisingly hoppy and bitter undertone. Sublime texture is silky smooth on the outside and lively and fizzy on the inside so it slides down the pipes easily yet leaves a nice tingle behind. Love them Belgians!"
"O: Not a very good beer. Too much grape flavor/aroma with a chalky, bitter yeast instead of having a nice balance of malts, spices, and bready yeast."
"Overall just solid as could be."
"aftertaste. (330 ml, bottled Nov 2010, BB Nov 2011, into tulip.)"
"O/D - Nice one. Great to sip on and a nice hop/funk/yeast combo."
"I'm a little surprised at the floral and citrusy hop tastes in this beer. It's a bit more bitter than I expected, as well. The backbone of this brew is the sharp carbonic bite paired with a gently sweet malt following close behind. The yeast earthiness rounds out this great example of Belgian beers. The texture is grainy and sharp, with a bit of alcoholic dryness. Medium-bodied and easy-drinking."
"Served in a stem glass. Poured hazy, golden-yellow with a nice white head that receded partially. Floral aroma and some fruitiness. Very organic tasting, the aroma follows through in the taste: floral, light fruits and some citrus notes, complimented afterward by light grassiness, giving a crisp finish with a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, and nicely drinkable."
"O – Glad I picked this one up. If I were to find another bottle stashed somewhere I will definitely pick it up."
"O - a very good brew that I'll have again when I come across it. not as ""belgian"" as I anticipated it being, but very good nonetheless."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’m liking this beer more and more as I sip more and more. I’ll certainly be willing to drink this one again, so long as it is relatively fresh. My overall impression of this beer is that it is very balanced and well made, that it is a real treat that stands out from the field of Strong Pale Ales with its imaginative combination of the best of Belgium and the best of hops."
"O: delicious, it seems like they might be using the same yeast in their beers, giving them a signature yeasty raspberry-esque flavor that works really well with their malty-cum-sour flavor"
"Notes: The hoppy side that the brew talks about was there but woven, maybe subdued given the uncertain age of the bottle. I´d be happy to find another one and compare notes though. This was quite tasty and top bracket quality wise. Thanks Toño for the treat."
"Overall: a real treat! Complex enough to be enjoyed on its own, but for all us savages who need food with beer it stood up to Chinese without batting an eye. Looking forward to having again when the weather warms up."
"This is a fantastic beer with great traditional style characteristics and an overall tasty experience."
"Arabier pours somewhere between a hazy tangering and full on orange. The cream colored head is absolutely towering, 4 fingers plus after pouring only about half the bottle. Retention is off the charts, 15 minutes later there's still a foam iceberg marooned in the center of my glass. Lacing is pretty good, but more spotty than cohesive sheets down the side of my glass, and just keeps the look from being about perfect. The nose is heavy on herbs and clove, with a bit of granny smith apples and pears peeking through as well. Neither the bottle or the De Dolle website mention anything about brett, but I swear there's a bit of funk to this one. Beyond that, the usual pale fruit sweetness leads off (though is unusually subdued) before a bigger than usual hop bite leads into a beautiful blend of herbal notes from the Nugget hops and clove and white pepper phenols from the yeast. A little bit firmer of a malt presence would balance the beer out a bit more and really elevate it even further. I don't mind my BSPAs being a bit on the dry side, but I'd say Arabier takes it just a bit too far. There's no substance to it at all body-wise. Carbonation is quite lively, and spot on for the style. Arabier is a relatively unique, interesting take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, and were it not quite so dry would be up there with Duvel as a top offering for the style."
"This one from De Dolle is really complex and has to be one of my favorite pale Belgian ales."
"This bottle says it's 8%ABV, not 7. Pours a very cloudy golden color with a HUGE white, frothy head that doesn't go anywhere anytime fast. Good lookin beer. Scent is yeasty, spicy, and fruity. I get oranges, apples, and banana. The orange is actually predominant in the nose. Taste is somewhat unique in its own way...Tons of flavor...Initially I get a hoppy flavor, quickly followed by delicious banana and orange flavors. Then I get some bread notes and tons of yeast and spice...a lot of pepper and some clove. It finishes very hoppy, which I was not expecting. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry with a lot of flavor. Drinkability is fairly high, as the ABV is pretty well-hidden. This beer is nowhere near Duvel, but it's a good beer overall."
"Overall this beer is very mediocre. Do I have a bad bottle? I just don't see the appeal at all here."
"jd"
"Cap is stamped ""Bottled May 2010."""
"More hops and bitter notes than other beers in this style. Enjoyable."
"D- as with everything de dolle brews, i enjoyed this. theyre a seriously under appreciated belgian brewery. i think this is supposed to be a hoppier offering. maybe the bottle i got is too old to fully appreciate it. id love to try another one that is newer."
"D: This is a great beer to sip if you are looking something with dryness and lots of spicy flavors."
"Goes down smooth at first with the decent carbonation but it fades quick as it warms. Very pleasant to drink when slightly chilled carbonated, not so much as it warms and loses it."
" D- This beer has a well-blended complex flavor with a dry but fruity and hoppy but not over hoppy flavor. It is very easy to drink and did not last long enough."
"O: Nice belgian which should be drunk in the summer."
"This is a very playfull beer. It tickles your tongue and gives you something to work with. It is a wide spectrum of flavour and yet so well balanced. The carbonation is low and the over all feeling is very warm."
"M/D: The finish is dry and leaves a long bitter aftertaste on the palate and the tip of the tongue. Very drinkable and thirst quenching"
"D: A nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale, a bit too hoppy, mabye (considering the styel)."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing, interesting and the carbonation is just right, with medium sized mid-soft bubbles."
"Slightly unbalanced to the bitter side, maybe storing a year would help. Anyway, good with cheese."
"A huge beer from a small brewery. This is what a BSPA should be like - period. I am left with an insane feeling of wanting to try De Dolle's other offerings like Oerbier and Stille Nacht..till then I will continue to savour my small booty of Ara Bier. Cheers. Smack !!"
"Full flavored and full bodied, it makes sense that this is sold bottle by bottle. A six pack might be a bit overwhelming to have at a sitting but having this on hand in a cellar would be a good idea."
"Drinkability: This is more like a Belgian IPA. By far the hoppiest and most bitter BSPA I've had. Very little of the delicious fruitiness I want in a BSPA. The hops drown out any of the subtle complexity that may be there. On the other hand, stepping back and tasting this as a Belgian IPA, I'd probably like it more, although I wasn't really in love with the hops flavor either."
"Mouth feel is very bubbly but not overly so(like Alka Seltzer). Alcohol is hidden. This beer is easy to drink."
"D - A lovely take on a Belgian pale. Lots of character and a pleasure to sip. This is one I'll make it a point to revisit."
"Overall a decent/complex beer, but not really in a good way. The flavor doesn't quite finish the deal compared to appearance. Be patient with the pour. I am just not a big fan of De Dolle I guess."
"D: This was a decent tripel, but its taste was fairly harsh, especially in the finish. The alcohol was well hidden, but it was still tough to drink since the aftertaste was so sharp. There wasn't a ton of depth or balance either. On the plus side, the body was spot on. Ultimately, this was a mediocre beer that's probably not worth trying more than once."
"Poured this one and I'd say about three fourths of my tulips is head! This beer is mostly a big fluffy white head on top of a straw colored beer. It looks nice but I can't even pour this thing! The head takes a while to dissipate and all in all it really took me about ten minutes to get this whole thing in the glass. No biggie though. Smells like sweet apples and I can really smell the Belgian yeast. Slightly bitter on the finish. The taste is like sweet and sour apples, Belgian yeast with a bitter tart finish. Pretty nice for a medium body but I feel like De Dolle over carbonates. It lowers the drinkability for me and at 7 percent, I can somehow taste the alcohol on this with a bit of a warming sensation as I drink it."
"the drinkability is good. it does show it's 7% abv, but i don't mind, it's a wonderfully unique beer that may come up short in some ways, but leaves a very positive impression overall."
"Drinkability:Very pleasant, and easily sessionable."
"The mouthfeel right out of the bottle is terrible because of the carbonation. Bubbles just form in your mouth and its distracting as hell. After 20 minutes in the duvel glas it's died down and become quite creamy in the middle but still finishes dry. That's pretty unique and I'm enjoying it. The drinkability is just above average, mostly due to the alcohol taste and the carbonation."
"This is an interesting effort from a good brewery that's definitely worth a try, despite its overpowering candied sweetness."
"OVERALL: Enjoyable pale ale. Good taste profile with plenty of bitter hops at the finish, though the palate could be a little creamier. Still worth a try if you're a fan of the style."
"D: An extremely drinkable beer."
"Taste follows in the same vein, although it is a bit more intense than a Duvel. Yeast presents some nice ester profiles with some banana, pineapple and clove flavors. Plenty of tropical alcohol notes and the hops contribute a spicy finish and grassy flavor throughout. It all comes together pretty damn nicely. Another good beer from the talented folks at De Dolle."
"Overall, a great Belgium brew, I highly recommend it."
"D - This is a cracking Belgian Pale Ale and you will struggle to beat it."
"sour apple and earthy hops. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a dry finish from the Poperinge dry-hopping. Well-balanced flavors of caramel malt, bready grains, musty barnyard yeast and light citric hops are delicately interwoven, achieving a beer that is engaging, yet simple."
"This is my first from De Dolle has me really looking forward to their Oerbier"
"pours a cloudy golden brown with a big big billowing head that recedes very slow highly carbonated..the smell is fruity and spice whiffs of candy some whiffs of citrus peel yeast a little coriander..the taste is really good it smokey and musty a little peat taste mixed with fruit and spice..i taste raisins some pepper..there is alot going on in this BSPA different then the dozen ive had in this style..but props to the complex taste..the mouth feel is full is crisp and bitter with some hops but is earthy and finishes dry its a sipper and changes as it warms,,if you kike BSPA'S seek this on out its an interesting one"
"It's very easy to drink, but some self control should be exerted as this beer is so complex that it's meant to sip and savor. An excellent beer which I highly recommend."
"Thumbs up for de dolle brouwers again."
"What does De Dolle add to this beer to make this taste the way it does? It's worth experimenting with if you want a ""different"" BSPA."
"Note: Label says 8% ABV, not 7."
"Creamy with brown patches. Nose quite complex blends discreetly smell of apple and apricot. The bouquet is well hopped and is associated with a drought quite powerful. It is both bitter and spicy with a hint of apple syrup and lemon and a hint of butter. Bitterness is also a remarkable appearance and it drags in the mouth with a pungent most welcome. Like other beers Dolle Brouwers, it offers a range of interesting flavors, alcohol hidden well but a heady power should not be overlooked."
"Drinkability: Well I don't know if it is me or my bottle but that was tasty. I would definitely recommend grabbing a few of these."
"Drinkability: pretty good, but a little harsh. This would probably pair well with a curry or other highly flavorful dish -- this could definitely stand up."
"D: Very nice beer. Highly enjoyable. Complex and funky, small bottle, but a big beer."
"D: This is not a BSPA like Tremens. Think De Ranke XX Bitter, only better for my palate. Dry, hoppy IPA character dominates, a very tasty and interesting beer."
"D- drinks excellent, my only prob. w/ drinkability is the amount that cascaded onto my dresser couldn't be salvaged"
"This was My first offering from the De Dolle Brewers and I will do my best to check out some of their other offerings"
"D - This is a big and aggressive beer. The yeast character is wild and huge; so much so that it threatens to obscure the subtleties of the malt and hops. The aroma is quite well balanced with appropriate contributions from all of the exceptional aspects of the beer. The flavor is a bit less controlled with a huge wave of sometimes harsh phenolic yeast flavors that threaten, but don't quite succeed, to wash away the creamy malt and atmospheric hops. This beer walks the line between complexity and becoming a hot mess, but thankfully it just barely manages to land on the side of excellence. In the end, my only real complaint is that it didn't come in a 750ml bottle and that I will have a hard time finding more of it. A wonderful, and truly unique example of the style; I wish there were more like it."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. I think the bottling date was on the top of the cap but it isn't legible. I don't think its too old. White, fluffy, long lasting foam sits atop a golden beer. Aroma is of fresh fruit with a bit of funk, some tartness and some miscellaneous sweetness, not sure what it is but I know its good. Waited a few minutes for the beer to warm a bit and the head to reduce so I didn't get foam on the tip of my nose. As the beer warms, a sweeter, honey like taste and smell start to emerge. Really a joy to drink and a journey of the senses to say the least. Wow."
"M&D - Medium bodied and Very smooth with good carbonation (I had figured it was going to be over carbonated from the pour, but I was wrong). Bubbled up a bit in my mouth but only the first couple of sips. I could drink more but I would have liked it a bit better balanced."
"De Dolle Brouwers, yo!"
"D - Very high. This would make an awesome summer beer in that it is complex and tasty, yet light and refreshing."
"interesting, drinkable beer - another good example of a belgian blonde sour. bought at a nice little beer store in bristol."
"Pours a clear golden color with a huge white meringue head that lasts forever. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a spicy phenol aroma with green apples lingering in the background. Also some alcohol is detected. The flavor is heavy on the yeast flavors. Cloves and pepper up front with some apple flavor coming in towards the back end. Hop bitterness is very apparent in the finish as well which I guess sets this one apart from other Belgian pale ales. A little alcohol warmth is also noted. Has a light body and seems a little overcarbonated especially right after the pour. It settles down a little with time but still a little high. A very good example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale but I would still take Duvel over this one."
"Cracking the cap on any De Dolle beer is always a pleasure, and this one proved to be no different. Depth, complexity, allure, uniqueness...it's got it all. Have had this one several times over the years, and this is surely not the last I've seen of it. Wowza."
"taste is fizzy, sour malt, sweet fruits, peach, and apricot, ends dry, a little sour, and a little bitter."
"Had this one last night as part of a De Dolle session. Poured a golden color with thick, frothy white head that faded very slowly and left good lacing. Smelled of yeast, fruit, malt, and toffee. Tasted of fruits, yeast, sugar, and caramel. A bit fizzy and dry. Good beer!"
"Upon pouring into a Duvel tulip glass, the appearance of the beer is a nice golden body with a frothy two finger head. It smells a little hoppy, kind of sweet. Upon sipping it, it tastes of fruits, candies, as well as yeast and malts, and in the end, it finishes dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with its carbonation coming through along with its sweetness, but all in all it is a smooth and enjoyable mouthfeel. The drinkability is very good on this 7% abv beer, I really wish that I had another right now...damn good beer !"
"Overall not at all what I expected but once I got into it I found it highly unique and enjoyable. Will definitely purchase again."
"After this great start with the smell and look I was greatly disappointed. This is not a very good beer. It is very very bitter with a no taste of orange that I smelled and just left me disappointed. Not at all what I was expecting."
"Distinctive, superior version of the style, though one of the more subdued offerings from De Dolle."
"Overall this is another very good beer from De Dolle, but somewhat in the middle of the pack. There's a lot going on here but the flavors don't meld as seamlessly as they do in De Dolle's other beers. Still, well worth a shot."
"A classic beer."
"I necessarily shouldn't take points for this, but it pissed me off as it was my first brew of the night and I hate waiting for that first one. Poured into a tulip and received about half a glass of foamy white head that took FOREVER to go down. This sat on top of a tantalizing gold body with some yeast floaties (I think). A tart citric hop smell mixed w/ hints of something spicy like clove or pepper and some sweet malt smells as well, not to mention that typical Belgian yeast smell (w/ the hint of orange). A mild, light sweetness mixed with some tart hops that pack a little punch on the backbite. A complex beer as I was going back and forth between picking up these bitter tastes and sweet tastes, as this beer's mouthfeel seemed to vary from thin and sour to full and creamy/smooth. I'm glad I tried this beer, but I'll be prepared next time."
"yum times a thousand. i love belgian beers that aren't too sweet, so the 'belgian ipa' category is usually my favorite. i'd categorize this one thusly if i didn't know better."
"D: Again, this score would be much higher if the mouthfeel were different."
"D- This is a decent BSPA. It is well put together and is definitely a unique, cool interpretation of the style...but its not really my cup of tea. It is definitely worth a try and I am glad that I had the opportunity offered by a very generous BA."
"Palate is dry, crisp, light, soft. A delicate and very refreshing beer, interesting and unique."
"Pours a fully clouded brown hued orange with a thick frothy crème head that's going nowhere. Nose is citrus, spices, dough. Flavor is quite robust and earthy. Evident flavors from a high use of hops. Tones of sugar, citrus, heavy spices, and minor dough. A lot going on here. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation nips at the tongue with tiny, ever present bubbles of carbonation. This is a hearty ale. Earthy, robust, and full."
"Overall this is a good but not outstanding representation of this style."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful pale malt scent along with kick ass yeast character. It's dry and earthy with a nice tartness to it. The taste is good. It has a smooth, earthy pale malt and yeast flavor that goes down slow and easy with a bit of warmth in the finish. It's quite dry. The earthy yeast character is outstanding. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent beer. The malt bill is pretty straight forward. It's warmth and fruity with a dry earthy finish; awesome."
"Drinkability: Another hits from this brewery. I have seen these labels for many years and avoided them because I just didn't know a lot about the contents. In searching for more Belgians, this one followed me home and I am glad it did."
"Notes: For the price my store has it at, it's fucking amazing. Love this brew."
"This beer was an absolute treat from beginning to end. Oh to have a case of these at hand at all times. Gives any of the tops Belgian Strong Ale a run for their money."
"Drinkability: This beer was aged for a few years in my cellar and is drinking beautifully; easily my favorite beer from this impressive brewery"
"5/3/6/3/13 (3.0/5)"
"this brew pours a cloudy ugly brown color with a perfect off white frothy head. great lacing on my glass, baby cakes....the nose is sweet malts, slight oak, honey, light sour fruits, citrus. the taste is grains, yeasty, citrus, malty....medium bodied, medium spritzy carbo. Decent brew from De Dolle. I've had better from them..."
"The appearance was a deep cloudy golden orange color. When poured it yielded a decent white head that succeeds in not disappearing too quickly. To the nose, this beer gives off scents off bread and citrus- namely grapefruit rind. When I took a small swig the grapefruit taste wasn't apparent, but the more I drank the stronger the grapefruit taste became; yet it still has a little breadiness and a bitterness from the hops which lends itself quite splendidly to that whole ""grapefruit beer"" kind of taste. In the mouth there is no lack of carbonation here with this beer, I think it's pretty light in weight though far from really light. Though good, I haven't drank more than one in a night; the grapefruit taste is good, but not something I want to taste all night."
"Drinkability is high, this is such a great beer. A super full flavored blond, so right up my alley, bier like this is why De Dolle is one of the best, period!"
"Would be great with dinner or a few just to relax. If I could afford it, I would drink this one all the time."
"Found this one at the Steelgaarden in Bethlehem, PA. It poured a fuzzy golden amber color with a thick full off-white head like snow and chunks of lacing throughout. The aroma is a sturdy clove and grass hop, a nice apetizing blend. The taste brings on lively bubblage full of lightly malted lemony wheat, clove overall and a dry overtone. But the hop presence is nice in a bready sort of way. Very fine, tingly carbonation, pretty drinkable. Smooth and likeable stuff."
"D - Wish I had another!!!"
"D- a definite sipper. The overflowing head makes it impossible to chug this or down it in 10 minutes. This is a beer to be enjoyed."
"This is a pretty flavorful, complex ale. Quite enjoyable and something I'd be glad to revisit."
"Ahh my first Ara since having it on draught at De Dolle! Out of the bottle it pours a slightly hazy brown/orange color with lots of rising carbonation and a monster of a white head. The nose is incredible as it is with many of De Dolle beers. Big floral esters, mint, lemon, sweet malts and subtle but detectable hops. Its hard to define the taste of Ara, so crisp and refreshing, yeast and malt invade first, nothing overwhelming just a nice flow of light flavor, it falls off midway leaving the bright fruitiness and moderate hop bite. It sports a medium body with lots and lots and lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. Amazing brew, perfect for summertime, actually this is drinkable anytime...beware of the burps!"
"Taste completes the intial triology of greatness this beer presents. Its a liquid version ofthe nose, only even more potent.The peachflavor explodes right up front, followed by a delicate balance of hop flowers, candi sugars and coriander. Alcohol is well hidden. The only complaint I have is that it may be a little too sweet, but sometimes I take a sip and think its perfect, the next too sweet. I did however, highly enjoy this beer and did a double tasting of Arabier and Orabier- BSPA vs BSDA. quite an enjoyable experience!"
"This is a perfect combo of a beer that's light enough to knock back on a hot summer day, but complex enough to savor. Great stuff."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Carbonation formed in the bottle immediately after popping the cap, resulting in a slight overflow. Pours a murky dark orangish color with some yeast floating around. This is definitely a slow pour, with a massive head forming from the high amount of carbonation. The aroma is fruits (mainly apples and pears) with a touch of spices and yeast. The taste has a peppery spiciness to it with a dose of earthy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is very light bodied and very heavily carbonated. Overall, De Dolle Ara Bier is an interesting Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but there is a really strong medicinal aftertaste that turns me off to it. It is worth a shot for its uniqueness, but I don't think I would purchase again."
"Ara Bier is a very good Belgian pale, and the abnormally intense hop character really provided a refreshing, fun twist to this classic style. Not the best from De Dolle, but another solid pick from their lineup."
"Something refreshingly light and summerish about it despite the complexities. The abv is reasonably well-covered. Pricey (at over 5 bucks for the small bottle), but a treat to sip on, especially on a warm day."
"Perfectly drinkable. I think I found a new favorite!"
"Not a bad beer, and would have again."
"The taste is full of spices, mustiness, dead grass, and yeast."
"Taste starts off with lots of yeast then changes to a kind of clove with citrus and spice. The finish is sort of sweet bitter. Interesting beer."
"An exceptional beer from De Dolle - one of my favorites."
"I've only had this brew one time before and only purchased it this time to review it.. I won't pick it up again, unless I am brewing a BSPA and want a little inspiration."
"Medium-full body and huge, lush, carbonation leads to a classically and exquisitely foamy-filling belgian-style mouthfeel. For sure one of the best I've ever had."
"Overall - Another very good brew from De Dolle although probably my least favourite of the ones i've tried... definitely worth a try though..."
"I had a bottle of this at the Palm Tavern in Milwaukee."
"Served in a tulip. Appears a pale gold with a big white head. The aroma is of apples and subtle herbal spice. The flavor is of sweet malts with with a touch of apples and white grapes. Finishes with mellow, grassy hops and a bitterness that balances out the initial sweetness. I find the carbonation a little much - strong enough that it gets hard to taste the beer. And once the carbonation did die down, big band-aid and medicinal phenols took over the aroma. I really dug the hoppy aftertaste, but the phenols and carbonation turn me off."
"A complex beer, flavor doesn;t quite finish the deal compared to appearance and nose - but an enjoyable belgian of distinction. Be patient with the pour."
"11.2 oz bottle copped singly from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... this one is obviously less intense and over-the-top than other De Dolle beers that I've sampled... very similar to their Bos Keun... really liked this one... an excellent depiction of the style, bursting with flavor and taste... Nice golden, hazy, and cloudy appearance with a decent frothy and foamy head... Great citrus smell with fresh tropical fruits and florals... terrific taste bursting with candies, sugars, caramel, and vanilla... very thick, rich, and full-bodied... De Dolle specializes in ultra-thick, creamy, rich beers, and this one certainly fits the bill... if you're looking for a thick, full-flavored beer, look no further than this one... Outstanding creamy mouthfeel with an easy drinkability... 7% ABV is hardly noticeable... a pleasure to drink and goes down very smooth, crisp, and clean... another winner from De Dolle... Definitely recommended..."
"Quite easy to drink, another wonderful Dolle creation. Incidentally, it matched chinese potstickers (not spicy) very well."
"D: A decent brew but was expecting more from this brewery.drinkable but only moderately enjoyable."
"After having the Export Stout about a year ago and really enjoying it I have seen this breweries other brews on the shelf and decided to pick on of them up to give it a try. The one I decided on, and not 100% certain why was this Ara Bier. The brew poured to a dark golden color, with a distinct brown hue. The pour gave a huge head that filled the glass perfectly with the end of the pour producing a good amount of yeast particles. The aroma had a number of properties that came out to me. Nice fruit, apple and pear, maybe (?) more than a slight earthy barnyard smell, and spices that seem to be mostly clove. The aroma was also pretty good as the fruit notes seem to come out more as I seem to pick up more apple along with a sweet sensation probably from the malts. Has what I would classify as a slight hop start to it, very mild and goes away quickly to the sweet flavor described above. Overall I must say that I enjoyed this brew, not my favorite but it was a nice change to the normal stuff I have been having. I would get this one again in the future, surprising that it is at 7% as I did not pick up much in the way of alcohol notes sticking out."
"Somehow I've never had this beer before, even though I've seen it for years and enjoyed other De Dolle beers. I must say that this one is just bizarre. I read an earlier review that described this as overly phenolic.I have to agree wholeheartedly. Pours a very cloudy golden, like a hefeweizen in color, but with a huge creamy head that pillows into hills and valleys in the glass. The smell is funky, slightly sour, and quite clovey. This is just a touch of medicinal funk as well. The taste is shocking. Starts slightly sour and a bit sweet, and quickly transitions into band-aids, burnt plastic, wood, and a smokiness on the finish. In a way it is weirdly fascinating, but ultimately it is hard to stomach. Mouthfeel is very nice. Quite carbonated and soft and creamy with the jolt of all that carbonation keeping it lively. It does improve somewhat as it warms, but the medicinal flavors are stronger than any other I've ever tasted. Ultimately I'm barely able to keep taling sips of this to review- and I can't say I'm enjoying it. I think this is one that gets worse with age."
"D: a special beer to sip, the warmth in my stomach tells me so."
"D - Very enjoyable, but suffers slightly from its excess of drying spices. Definitely a beer to be savoured slowly."
"Calling this beer a Pale is kind of a stretch. In fact anything but a Biere de Garde would be a mis-classification. This is one weird beer. A very woodsy, nutty, fruity, dirty, musty character chases this beer throughout, at times robbing it of sweetness, but adding a ton of comlexity. Aromas are boarderline barnyard, dusty, and like grandma's attic. Flavors are less funky, but more woodsy, tart, and full of rotten fruits. The yeast / bacteria has stripped the beer of much of it's sweetness and body, but the other complex flavors, textures, and aromas compensate well. The beer has an overwhelming phenolic character that passes plastic and medicinal notes, and well into a smoky, scorched flavor. Finishes as muddles as the flavors with the low-lying sweetness going first, and a tart, cheesy flavor lingering. It's basically an alcoholic mud puddle."
"Review added 10-23-2007, translated from french 2-29-2008."
"very drinkable beer."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian beer."
"Haha...that one goes out to you born around 1980, listened to crappy music in middle school and know the names of the brewers for this company."
"love this brewery. hazy honey with a white head that settles into a floating island of solid, creamy goodness, leaving tons of lace as it does so. nose is lemon, honey, herbal tea and maybe a touch of dried apricot. to me taste is lemon up front followed by buttery herbal tea with a touch of honey. proper medium body, although i wish it was a touch creamier. i was worried from the typical humongous de dolle head that it would be overly carbonated, but this one was about just right. dangerously drinkable. i'm trying to savor, but it's just so difficult. another please..."
"D - Its drinkability is rather low, due to its high alcohol taste and complex medley of flavours which should be enjoyed thoroughly."
"D: Good, borderline excellent. I liked this beer but wished the drier qualities were balanced a little more with some sweetness. Then again, that's MY preference only. A likable beer I'd definitely have again."
"Great gold color, with a strong head if micro bubbles. Appetizingly dry. The alcohol is present but dances well with the yeast (it's listed as 8% on the De Dolle website, not the 7% listed here.) Crisp finish. One of the few De Dolle brews I'll go back to."
"Would drink it everyday if possible, but no more than 2 at a time. Superb."
"sure, it's smooth, but not drinkable at all. I hope this is a bad bottle, but the other reviewers found many of the same flavors I found."
"Highly recommended. Another wonderful example of De Dolle taking a common style and adding their own unique twist."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and rather spritzy with carbonation."
"This is a really interesting beer from De Dolle. Nothing like what I was expecting. Much stronger hop presence than expected goes nicely with the other flavors. Looking forward to trying some of the other De Dolle's I have in the fridge."
"This is a solid, hoppy Belgian strong pale ale. It is a little less sweet than some others and the bold hop profile nearly renders this pleasing brew to be a Belgian IPA in my opinion."
"Drinkability: I found this to be a somewhat refreshing and easy to quaff. An enjoyable and almost session-like belgian beer."
"D - Not great. The flavor isn't pleasant, it just has too much much pepper to be enjoyable. It smells nice though."
"Fantastic strong pale ale from a brewery that rarely disappoints. I love their sense of experimentation and originality in their beers. Give me a bottle of this over Duvel ANY day."
"Overall, I like this one very much, thank you!"
"Overall it's funky, semi-sweet, slightly odd...but this one is a pioneer for some of the funked out emulations that we now find brewed in the U.S."
"Cloudy dark orange colour with a huge thick white head. Left most of the yeast in the bottle. Head settled to a white cap and left some lacing on the glass. Aroma is fresh, tart and sweet. Reminiscent of green apples, green grapes and champagne/white wine. Some spiciness there too. Flavour is sweet, fruity, tart and acidic. Some typical Belgian yeast flavours present. Medium body and high carbonation. The 7% alcohol provides a nice amount of warming. This is a superb Belgian pale ale. Bottle advertises that it's unfiltered and unpasteurized."
"Drinkability/Overall: as drinkable as any BSPA I've had, a session possibilty. Solid all around."
"Very well-crafted beer from this brewery, the 8% is invisible."
"A really clean bottle from De Dolle. Bright, hoppy and spicy. Just the right ticket for a single beer for the night."
"D: Good. This is a beer that needs savoring, not quaffing."
"Divine."
"11.6 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. A fast head that quickly recedes to a thin filmy ring. Color is a hazy orangish-yellow, with a lot of sediment. Smell is slightly citrus with grassy spices. Taste is strongly of coriander up front, but as it warms a grapefruit flavor appears. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strong fizz feel. This is an interesting beer, and I'm glad i tried it, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to get it again."
"Pours clear gold with voluminous carbonation and an out-of-control half glass of delicate foam. Aroma is a nice blend of fruitiness (green apple, pineapple, pear) and earthy spiciness (orange, black pepper, alcohol). Flavor is a little mellower than the smell. Tart rounded citrus fruits combined with dry rough hops and leafy yeast. Finishes super dry and hoppy with puckering tartness. Extra light body that's crazy with tiny bubbles. A superb beer and well worth seeking out bottles in good condition."
"Slightly overcarbonated with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel that carries with it a powerful pear presence. Some chewiness by midsip with a strong sensation of yeast, finish has a touch of bitterness."
"D- Because of the price I wouldn't drink it all of the time, but every once in a while it's nice to get a single to sip and savour."
"D: Good beer, becomes much more flavorful as it warms. Fairly original."
"D - I could polish off a 750 of this no problem. A very good brew."
"Pours a clear light golden color. Huge head of white bubbles. Aroma is spicy and dusty. A hint of apple. Taste is light with hints of grain. Faint grass and perhaps some bubblegum way in the back. The grass becomes more sharp as I drink. Very dry. Drinkable, but not my choice for Belgian Strong Pale Ales. Just too sharp on the grass."
"Drinkability: Very complex and very easy to drink equals a deadly combination. However, I still wouldn't really want to have more than one in a sitting. Certainly worth a shot, and very nice in the summer weather for a sipper."
"33cl. bottle. The first thing that I noticed was the slowly rising column of foam in the neck of the bottle. It poured into the glass with quite the frothy, white head of foam. It did linger for a little while, and did leave some lacing. The aroma was very pleasant. Spiciness is the first aroma that you detect. This is followed by some breadiness and a whiff of some fruitiness. It is a little effervescent on the tongue. That seems to limit the ability to taste the beer. I do get hints of sour apples and a faint hint of caramel malt. Spiciness is evident. An interesting beer."
"I like this offering and can't wait to try more from this brewery!"
"What a wonderfull beer, strong, full-bodied and not too sweet and complex, recommended!!!"
"In a word, creamy yeast with strong carbonation. Tasty, honeyish and on sweet side, but carbonation on mouth detracted. Rather one dimensional on yeast, some clove tea spice, some orange citrus, Drinkable. Did not get much from dry hopping. A nice one."
"Drinkability: The bitterness is an issue here (don't get me wrong I love bitter beers under certain circumstances), but this beer surpasses so many others with its other characteristics that it might not matter."
"This beer really reminds me of some american pales (like SN) with a bit more of a sweet/fruity kick. After the Oerbier, my favorite de dolle brew."
"D - Fantastic beer. Easily one of my favourite Belgian beers. In fact, it's one of my favourite beers full stop."
"Overall, a good, quite interesting beer, but not something that blows my mind. Well worth a try, though."
"Overall: This is a decent Belgian Strong Pale Ale, not one of my favorites though."
"taste has a lot of apple in it as well, with some nice candied overtones and yeasty belgian flavors. not particularly bold; the flavor is very good, but fairly subdued."
"Good god I need more. More more more. Everything that is wrong with the world can be summed up from my lack of this beer. Everything that is wrong with me. Everything that is wrong with you. Everything that is wrong with mother."
"The 7% abv is almost undetectable. Good sour qualities and sweetened fruit flavors. Another well brewed offering from de Dolle."
"An all around enjoyable beer."
"Pours a thick, opaque peach color with a hint of brown, makes a huge fluffy white head. Light floral aroma with notes of coriander and cloves. Flavor is complex with fruits and lightly spiced, has a sweet aftertaste. Medium on the palate, creamy texture and finishes dry. A rather good strong pale ale, easy to drink, alcohol content is very subdued by the complexity in the flavors. I would try this one again."
"overall: after the first sip, i must admit, i thought i was gonna be givin' this beer an average rating. didn't take long for me to reconsider. very tasty brew especially as it warms. get yourself some!"
"A hyperactive explosion of white mousse turns rigid and chunky. The color below is blurry blond. Satisfying rich vanilla and cream sensations are evident on the nose along with flamboyant impressions of citrus filling, dusty white pepper and minerals. I like the even split between hard core, peach pit-flavored bitterness and farmers market flavors of herbs, grass, lemon oil and root vegetables. The finish is persistent with that same mixture. The yeasts are a little unruly here. Nice."
"Very flavourful and complex ale with a powerful yeast character and beautifully rounded body."
"Bottle. Hazy but luminescent orange with a HUGE merangue like white head that lasted admirably and left heaps of lace behind. Aroma is hoppy citrus with some malty sweetness in the background and a little belgian yeasty funk. Taste is dry at first with a little malty sweetness, but dominated by a big finish of spice and hop bitterness, completely hiding the reasonably high ABV. Also noted a slight off ""latex"" taste. Mouth is light and a little course. For me, not up to the Oerbier unfortunately, although I am sure I will get plenty of disagreement."
"I found the hops to be a nice break from your standard offerings in the style, with much more gusto than some."
"another top-notch offering from de dolle."
"I may be prejudiced for de dolle, but this is another quality offering and at 7% abv, it doesn't seem so .... until it hits you of course"
"I'm glad I read that this beer poured with a volumnous head. I decided to utilize the Gulden Draak goblet for this one. It did pour up a huge, rocky bone white head atop a golden colored beer. Lightly honeyed malt aroma with hints of citrus and pear. Light hoppiness and, overall clean smelling with a light yeast mustiness. Introduction of lees attributes a mild spiciness. Trace amounts of a medicinal quality, but nothing severely off. Slightly sweet and an herbal, hoppy finish that is rather sedate, yet noticable. Very refined and elegant. For some odd reason, I didn't really know what to expect from this beer, but I surely was not disappointed. A very tasty pale. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet spritzy. Finely tuned and highly recommended. One of the better Belgian pales I've had recently."
"Ara Bier is a BSPA that fits neatly into the bitter-dry end of the style spectrum. It's well-made (I'd expect nothing less from Brouwerij De Dolle), but it doesn't quite push all of my buttons. Okay, it doesn't push them *firmly*. It's worth a repeat purchase though and is definitely worth a look if you happen to run across a bottle."
"Drinkability- Almost like a Belgian IPA. Ineresting and different. Very drinkable...may get this one again next time I go shopping."
"Pours a hazy peah-like color with just a volcanic head that took over most of my tulip glass leaving nice sheets of lace behind,big pinapple aroma from the offset with some clovey spiciness and a little cinnamon thrown in there as well.The flavor along with the aroma has a strong pinapple character with a big yeasty-spiciness in there as well,as it warms a little the alcohol pops up more along with some light mineral qualities.Glad to try this beer very well made with some subtle complexities I really like the fruitiness to it will love to have again."
"The taste is wonderful. Pretty sweet, almost like apple juice with a tiny bit of hops added in. The aftertaste gets a little bitter, and the slight feeling of carbonation lingers for a little while, but the smoothness of the initial sip really begs for another. As you have more and more, the aftertaste starts to go away and you are left with only the sweet start. A great beer for any occasion."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention. Aroma is mostly comprised of yeast with some spices and hops also noticeable. Taste is quite sharp with again the yeast making a lot of impression and spices with strong malt being quite evident. Strong body with some good carbonation. WOW, this brewery seems to always be amazing."
"Another wonderful concoction from De Dolle Brouwers."
"Terrific appearance. An attracting hazy golden with a gigantic white head displaying splendid lacing. The head leaves a trace after every sip and just stays there, mountainous, rocky, all over the glass. Sediments move at the bottome of the glass. Appealing yeasty sweet aroma. Honeyish malt is the base on which dances an above average hop character for a belgian beer, citrusy, lemony, sprucey. Notes of bread, farmhouse, apple and pepper+cloves. I expected this to be the least interesting De Dolle, but how wrong I was, this one is fabulous, complex, yeasty, balanced, refreshing and almost a session beer. Palate is dry up front, hoppy with a generous bitter finish, but all kinds of things happening in between. Theres a subdued fruitiness in the likes of grapefruit, apple, orange or apricot and complex complementing spices. Refreshing mild tart profile. Great creamy and velvety mouthfeel with above average carbonation. I just played a few hours of tennis and this is a superb ""sunny day welcome"". The complex toasty almost pilsnerish malt just seduces me. All the ingredients in this beer makes themselves heard and known. Oh plentiful harvest, how I want to live to drink your offerings again... Thank you for enlighting me Sham."
"A super solid sipper, not as drinkable as most other De Dolle treats, but approachable and pleasant non the less. Easily more enjoyable as it warms up. I enjoy the Dulle Teve by a good margin more along with Bos Keun for De Dolle classics but this still would be something to have again, no prob. It grows on ya."
"Yert again, GClarkage, you're the man. Thank you for sending this one my way."
"Poured into Rapscallion glass, where it formed a big, fluffy 2"" bright white head over the golden light amber brew. Head is dense, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere quick, with good lacing. Aroma is fruity, peaches, perhaps, with a light undercurrent of alcohol. Taste is initially spicy, with some rounding out with pale malts, and sharpens up with some hops bite, amongst other varied flavors. A busy set of taste buds on this one. Mouthfeel takes a bit of getting used to, but eventually becomes somewhat addicting. Drinkability is good for the main reason that you must revisit to make sure no flavors were missed or overlooked."
"Drinkability is below average for this style. I would not buy this again."
"On tap at Redbones in late August. After every sip I said ""this is crazy"" , even at the end of night of hop slugs and hot sauce. Insanely complex, yet pleasant, and damn drinkable. Spicy, sweet, tart, other flavors all in turns. Please Redbones - bring this one back !"
"This will be my first De Dolle beer and I am excited. The beer pours from a 11.6 oz bottle. Yellowish tan in color with a huge head that lasts. The smell is clean and citrusy with hints of something grassy. Very effervesant. The taste is much stronger than I expected. The grassyness starts to come through even more in the taste. You get a hint of some alchol at the end as well. Not as balanced as I expected. I can't get over how huge the head is. The flavor reminds me of something in between an Orval and a Duvel. Very good, just very different."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"I was really disappointed by this brew. Poured a hazy gold with a huge, rocky head. Aroma was sweet with apple, lemon, and malt. I was disappointed most of all by the taste, as the tartness was just overpowering, and didn't match the aroma. Spicy hops and alcohol. Grainy and phenolic. I detected some charcoal and metallic notes as well that were rather unpleasant. Mouthfeel was prickly, which matches this style fairly well, and grows smoother with every mouthful. This is certainly my least favorite offering from De Dolle."
"Mellow, soft but very hoppy and delicious. Fruitiness; mainly peach and tangerine. Incredible balanced and very pleasant. I would love to have this again."
"Another one I brought back from Beermania. Nice yellow bow tie on the bottle. Huge soft, fluffy, airy, persistant head in the goblet. Slightly hazy gold color with lots of bubble density. Spicy cloves in the nose with a hint of lemon. Inital taste of lemon and dry pinapple followed up with a grassy slightly bitter finish. Quite smooth on the mouth and tongue. Solid smooth and drinkable..."
"Pours surprisingly clear - unless you try to get every drop, then you get some nice yeasty bits. Golden amber with a huge, thick white head...incredibly thick head! Took me a few minutes to get it all in the glass to control a head that ended up thick as foamed milk. Aroma is sweet and fruity - pears and banana shine through. The taste is light and fruity, with some sourness at the finish and hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Very light on the tongue - flavor and intense excited carbonation fill the mouth completely. The mouthfeel is champagne like - light and airy - mouthfilling. A great summery beer that satisfies and brings on a craving for another -"
"Sampled 1/22/04"
"A careful pour from a long-standing bottle delivers a clear, yellow-gold body beneath a huge head of rocky white foam that holds exceptionally well and leaves wide sheets of thin lace about the glass. If the yeast at the bottom is disturbed, however, it becomes a hazy marmalade, but at the same time delivers more flavor via the yeast. The bright nose is yeasty, floral, subtly fruity, delicately spicy (cloves) and welcoming! Some acetaldehdye (green apple) and candyish notes (from a combination of phenols and sweet malt) arise as it warms. A very fine, effervescent carbonation is achieved through bottle conditioning, and combines with it's medium body to leave it gently zesty on the tongue before warming to become velvety smooth across the tongue. The flavor delivers fruitiness and hints at tartness upfront before a honeyish and mildly nutty maltiness and spicy, grassy, leafy and floral hop flavor becomes apparent. Its bright hoppiness is quite a twist on the standard Belgian golden strong ale style! Bitterness rises towards the finish, and lingers dryly in the long aftertaste amidst a smattering of grassy hops and phenols. An interesting and exciting beer!"
"A white grapefruit bitterness, along with orange zest provides a nice sharp edge. Coriander, cloves and peppery spices seem to unify the different tastes. A warming alcohol is a welcome flavor and sensation partner. I like this brew a lot!"
"This cloudy, golden beer has a huge rocky head that just won't quit. There are some fruity esters in the aroma that smells of apples. It is delicate and spicy with a dry bitter finish. It is complex and refreshing and everything that an artisanal beer should be."
"A nice looking beer, with an interesting aroma -- but a one-dimensional and not very appealing taste."
"Aftertaste very bitter, fresh and herbal. A lot of long standing bitterness."
"This beer can be REALLY strangely bitter when it's fresh (see above bracketed comments], but after a year or more of proper cellarage it becomes much more balanced. Based on this, I have increased my rating of it. It will likely be at its prime with a year's storage under its belt."
"turbo charged carbonation produces a beer that is golden in colour, with a monstrous head and thick rocky rings of lace. very pleasant aroma of mixed tart tropical fruits backed by that underlying slightly sour yeast smell. very pleasing tastes in this one...refreshing fruits followed by a bit of woodiness...a brew probably meant for summertime consumption rather than december. smooth but lively mouthfeel...easily drinkable despite the presence of some stern alcohol notes. a very good beer all around and one of the better belgians i've tried. i'll probably get another one of these to re-review and get more specific about."
"A little different but well worth a try."
"A hazy orange color, it is very well carbonated and it produces a thick white head. It has a spicy dry slightly funky cheese aroma. The carbonation prickles the front of my tongue, as I take a sip. A very spicy funky Belgian brew. Lightly sweet in the finish, which ultimately ends with an astringent aftertaste. Fruity with perhaps some tropical fruit notes, a certain woodiness is in this beer as well. I get notes of some wild-woody mushroom type character as well. There is no acidic sourness in this beer, unlike some of there other offerings. Very good and quite complex, it is amazing how good the beers from this small country brewery can be."
"Bottle tasted at Erasmus in Bruges. Appearance: Orange, cloudy, good sized head. Aroma: Spicy, noticeable bretamyces, and hops to beat the band! Flavor: Fairly sweet, but still very intense. Lots of hops. Finish: Crisp, spicy hoppy finish, with lingering sweetness."
"Another bottle conditioned volcano, 3 inches of rugged head in a Duvel glass. Highly sedimented dull bronze color, laces like cotton on a Christmas tree. Light aroma, spare yeast and a lemon cough drop kind of malt, a little different. Flavor is marked by a hard to descibe maltiness, present with decent body but counteracted by a considerable bitterness -- a one/two of citric pith drying to pine needles. Whew, can't say this one is a favorite but an arid and bitter alternative to the thick and malty brews. Very much worth trying, there's a lot going on here."
"Update: Re-tasted in 2004 and picked up a lot bigger Belgian hop balance along with shades of sourness. I enjoyed the Mouthfeel more and raised this category, as well as Drinkability, by 0.5."
"My records indicate that this particular sample was bottled around 2000. Nonetheless, it pours a hazed peach hue with a frothy white head. Some yeast remnants float in the beautiful liquid. Nose is almost entirely gueuze-like. Big notes of sour acidity, horse blanket, and earthy hops lead the way in the aromatic department. Herbal, earthy hops, citrus and passion fruit along with a refreshing acidity quality are all present on the palate. Well-attenuated and aging nicely, this ale's mouthfeel is quite smooth and appealing. Drinks quite well for a brew of 7% abv -- the alcohol is hard to taste. This is a great, unique summertime beer, albeit the hefty alcohol content that will eventually catch up to you no matter how well it's masked. Another excellent Belgian ale."
"Nasty, nasty nasty taste to this one. The bartender ( who I know is knowledgable about beer) said it sucked when I ordered it. I decided to go for it anyway, since I figured one would be an experience, if nothing else. It started out as a cloudy, blondish colored brew with an enormous head. Had an odd smell, a little bit like honey, but with a strange, unpleasant odor vying for attention. The taste actually reminded me initially of Chimay white, but then this nasty aftertaste barges in that totally overloads the tastebuds. The bartender afterwards gave me a Chimay goblet to atone."
"Beware the foam with this beer! This beer pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with an enormous, growing head - unreal how much foam this has - even with a good pour. The head stays thick throughout and causes the top portion of the beer to have an odd dark hue, even though the head is white. The aroma for this one had a lot of spices and hops in it with some small hints of yeast. The flavor was very tart and spicy with the alcohol being far too prominent for only having 7%. I didn't care much for this one - possibly influenced by the fact that it foamed over onto my table more than once."
"11.6 oz bottle. Poured a hazy golden orange, with a small head that didn't last, and left some lacing on the glass. Aroma is of citrus and some hops. Taste is lightly tart and crisp. I really enjoyed this beer. It was almost like a lambic, but with a more complex flavor. very enjoyable"
"This brew poured a small white head with small bubbles that quickly diminished. This brew left a fair lacing on all sides of my glass. The body was cloudy and straw yellow in hue. It had a mild hoppy aroma along with a citrus aroma. It had an initial sour flavor that was still there at the end. The body was light on the palate. I was not very impressed with this Belgian and Belgian Strong Ales are one of my favorite styles of brew."
"It was the label that attracted me. That bird looked so cute, and it had ""CAT.S"" written on it. It poured a carbonated orangish yellow. It tasted almost like a lambic IMHO. Tart, I swear I could taste an overwhelming cherry taste. I found this beer quite different, I think one a session is more than enough."
"This one poured a nice looking gold with just a hint of orange. The head was white and craggy, like a big iceberg on top of the glass. The smell is spicy with some medicinal undertones and traces of ripe cherry. The taste is on the tart side and just a bit mouth-puckering. Unfortunately, the taste of alcohol becomes a bit too pronounced for a 7.0% beer, which detracts from the drinkability."
"Pours a bright light amber (turned cloudy after I had room for a second pour). A stormy blizzard of streaming bubbles feed a growing head that can be touched and will spring back into shape. Flavor is bright and crisp, but still complex. Honey, apples, apricots and the faintest hint of pecans.There is a surprising hop bitterness for a belgian beer. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Aroma impresses also: heady and vibrant, buzzing with spice, and spritzes of citrus. Loads of malt in the body, but jam-packed with hops above all. Excellent integration. The flavor is dominated by citrus, with a dedicated yeastiness riding throughout. The finish is sweet and brief, but the hoppy zing at the front provided for a very pleasurable experience. An excellent bier, and I have JohnyDuvel to thank for it!"
"A big 'thank you' goes out to StevieW for including this gem in our Blockbuster Trade!!"
"The aroma is very nice. Hoppy. Piney. Musty. Citric. My guess is that this beer tips the spectrum on the high side for hop load for this style. This is a nice tasting Belgian brew. Probably my favorie of this brewery (of which I've also tasted Stille Nacht and Oerbier). The must and peat tones are prevalent to me. There's an acidic tinge and hoppy undertones. A little lemon. But the malt base is evident and sufficient. Biscuity. Bready. Some yeastiness as well, but not as much as I've become accustomed to in fine Belgian brews. Body is light and pleasing. Drinkability good. All in all, a fine beverage here."
"F."
"Amazing fruity nose, pineapple and grapefruit. Amazing white head on golden body. Classy yet huge bitterness. Medium body with wonderful body. Nose changes to a spicier, maltier aroma. Taste is strikingly different from nose, and is floral on a sturdy frame. Carbonation has serious, yet refined attitude."
"Many thanks, Bighuge"
"Drinkability: Good, fairly tart."
"Pours a cloudy orange gold, with a thick pillowy head that leaves sheets of lace. After swirling and pouring the yeast, the beer became a cloudy copper. Aroma is full of fruits... topical fruit, fresh fig, and apricot, with a musty sweet character. Flavor is an intense burst of fresh figs, sour apples, musty barnyard notes, and a slightly sour herbal finish. Has a medium body and is very smooth. A bit too sour to drink very much, but a very interesting bier."
"To tell you the truth I purchased this beer because of the bird on the bottle. I poured this bottle into my usual 15 oz mug and wished that I had a 32 oz mug. There is so much head on this beer. I have never seen head like this before. It's BIG, pure white, and fluffy. I had the head coming out of the beer by an inch. This beer is a yellow that turns into brown and is very cloudy. Citrus is the dominate smell, with a hint of apples. This beer is tart without being bitter. It is slightly sweet, weak bodied, and finisher greatly. This beer leaves great lace, all the way to the bottem of the glass. At 7% abv, this beer is still surprisingly drinkable."
"Notes: Oh baby, this is a nice one. One to have on occasion to bring the whole beer thing into perspective. Meaning that even pale brew can be this complex and flavourful yet drinkable at the same time."
"A hazy dark golden to orange amber color under a giant white smooth head. Head is huge, makes my belly look small, rich creamy vanilla pudding like. Smells are lots of citrus undertones, and warm spices. One of the most pleasant and complex tasting beers I have ever experienced. Inviting spicy richness, matched with crisp citrus lip smacking goodness. High abv will sneek right up on you and warm your belly at the same time. Bottom of the glass leaves a spicy yeast sediment that revives the last few sips. Unbleievable beer. I picked this one up and a couple other from the same brewery on the recommendation of the beer store owner in Tampa.....can the others be as good ? I am looking forward to finding out........"
"Great for motivating you when Ironing. Well thats One Sock done....."
"This Belgian ale is similar to Chimay Cinq Cents, but has a very unique flavor and is easier to drink. This flavor is a combination of toasted and caramel malts, black pepper, coriander, and pleasant barnyard flavors. The dry hopping is marvelous.This is easy to drink due to medium strength alcohol - wish I had more than one bottle."
"The head on this impressed me a lot, big frothy and lasting. Orange colour, a bit lemony on the nose. Lemon juice sort of flavour, quite acidic, bit of a peppery spice, quite unique, but not really to my tastes, interesting."
"Slightly hazy light orange hue w/ small aggregates of yeast in suspension.  The head is dense and well retained, leaving a (true) Belgian lace.  Very sweet, honey - like aroma, w/ a hint of green apple and clove as well as a light floral note. The overall flavor is comprised of honey notes, light phenol and bit of nutty sweetness. Smooth and pleasant mouthfeel, w/ a medium body that keeps this brew very drinkable.  Finishes sweet with an unexpected and odd lingering non hop derived bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Although sweeter and not as complex as other Belgian Strongs, Ara is flavorful and light enough to be quite drinkable."
"Nice orange color with some pretty intense thick head.  I am staring at my empty glass now and seeing the history of every sip I took on the side of the bottle.  Nice fruity, almost citrus, flavors.  Moderately spicey/zesty with a good amount of malt character.  Ordered myself a case of this as I find it a nice beer to drink out on the deck while reading or hanging with friends."
"I was surprised to find this beer to be fairly average all around.  Light orange color.  Some acidity, some apricot flavor.  The flavor appears upfront and then promptly disappears.  I actually wish I had poured more yeast into the glass so this beer would have exhibited more flavor."
"Notes: Hot damn! This about as unique as it gets fellow advocates. Todd bought this at the 't Brugs Beertje in Brugs for 140 BF. Buy it and savour it friends."
