"O: An extravagant beer that hides its alcohol well."

"i have a beer friend, whom i have not known for an extraordinarily long time, but who's opinion i respect very much. he regards de dolle as the best brewery in the world, and the stille nacht their best beer. thats high praise from anyone, especially him, so at long last, i finally get to drink one of these. on tap at the bull and bush, a real treat once the server got it right. hazy and quite pale in the glass. not sure why i expected it to be darker, but its cloudy but bright, not thick at all, almost delicate looking, and not that abv ever has a look, but this looks too light for 12% abv. head is thick as shaving cream but not as white, it stands tall like beaten eggs ready to be folded into a cake batter. it smells unexpected as well, hoppy, but only really as far as the belgians ever take it in that regard, less bitter, more leafy grassy, and fully yeasty. it smells tart like good lemonade, but still with that estery belgian yeast fruitiness and complexity. there is a hair in me that thinks this has some wild in it, not pitched bacteria, but some wild strain that got worked in one way or another. very complex, and unique to my nose. the taste is the same, new but enticing, taunting almost. the hype around this one, which is more internal in my circle than external i think, maybe not, had this one highly anticipated, and first sip shows why. that tartness is there in the finish, with even a moderate acidity. usually the strong belgians, especially the tripel types, the pale ones, have tons of sugars added for extra fermentables, or such a high original gravity as to never quite get dried out enough for my tastes. not this one, and that is its immediate success for me. its dry, but its huge, but its delicate and rich, its a bunch of caucophanous juxtapositions that resolve in beautiful synchronicity. splendid. lemon is there, straw, hay, clover, plantain, white pepper, mild brett, even decaying forest floor. this is wonderful beer, not fully understood but entirely appreciated. is it the best beer i have ever had, i dont think so no, but it is something to be revered and treasured, and there is nothing else like it."

"Overall: I'm glad this is a winter beer, since if it were available all year round I'd be drinking rather a lot of it and end up pickling myself in the process. It is, I suspect, rather an acquired taste - a sweet tooth certainly helps as it's quite sugary and heavy. That said, it's well worth tracking down and trying if the chance presents itself. Definitely worth taking your time over (especially at 12% ABV!)"
""
""
""
""
"Oh my goodness, HAPPY 2015, and what a way to kick it off!!!"
""
""
"Didn't expect such a BIG beer (tho, 12%). Tasty, but a sweet-tooth is imperative, strong, so take some time with it. Hard to rate."
""

"Boozy, flat, nothing that can make wanna finish the beer from the glass."

"Taste of this brew is complex, alcohol is present from the very beginning and lingers till the end. Very yeasty, lots of spices on my tongue, cinnamon, clove, pepper, burned malt, sugar, honey and a little bitterness at the end, which enhances the sweetness of the sugar. Long aftertaste of mostly sugar and alcohol. In my opinion they push it too far, the beer appears unbalanced to me, sugar and alcohol are too present, they dominate all the other ingredients and interrupt the possible complexity."

"What a beautiful Belgium beer!"

"A cloudy brown amber with a large long lasting white head on the pour. Caramel malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruit notes along with some citrus orange fruity esters. There is some brown sugar and sweet alcohol flavors with mild bitterness. A medium body, a smooth and mild sticky sweet caramel orange bitterness on the palate. Finish is sweet full flavored. Overall a very well made and tasty ale."

"O: A really good and very strong and flavorful Belgian strong pale ale. I would definitely buy more of this if I came across it again. Its sweet, warming, bitter and interesting."
""
""
"O: not a ton of the classic De Dolle funk found at the forefront here, but it's a stellar creeper beer... one of the most satisfying simple, malty, strong Belgian beers you'll find... could very well be the Zeus of malt liquors"
"O- What an amazing beer. I recommend aging one for a long time and enjoy!! Has a lot to offer, very complex."
""
""
"M - Smooth, consistent, full"
""
""
""
""
""

"D- Amazing beer to sip on. Just when I thought I hadn't had a belgian beer in some time that really blew my socks off ..."
""
"O: Really nice BSPA. Super high ABV for one in fact, but it doesn't detract much. Doesn't get too syrupy, too heavy or too overpowering. No way would I assume 12% for that matter. I'd say 8-10% tops. Love the honey flavor in this one, even though I'm pretty sure there's no actual honey in it. I really enjoyed this one, one of my all time favorite BSPAs right off the bat."

"Overall: I had to look at the bottle again, there is now way this is 12 percent ABV! This drinks like it is at least 7%. Notice I didn't say there was any booze in the taste. This is very delicious, despite the appearance. Some don't like chunks in their beer but that was not a problem with this guy! I feel this could be a nice dessert beer or paired with a nice Fruit Salad. This refreshed my Love for Belgian Strong Ales. This is my New Favorite BSPA. This brew is Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very very good, excellent balance of sweet malt and light tartness, with a hint of funky yeast on the finish. This is one of my new favorites. $6.99 for 11.5floz"
""
""
"Oh wow - this is one terrific beer! Rich malt, fresh fruit, baking spices, and warming alcohol all come together perfectly. Anyone who thinks Belgian Strong Pale Ales have to taste like Duvel is in for a shocker if they try this. If I come across another bottle of it, there's not way I'm passing it up. Highly recommended."

"Pours a hazy reddish orange with fast fading dense white head; streaks of lace on the glass. Smell: pear, buttered toast, caramel, mild spiciness and floral note, dried apricot. Taste: soft pear, white grape, red delicious apple, spice cake and caramel, spicy with sugary pale backing. Fullish bodied, creamy into pillowy carb. Tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good beer but very messy. Definitely worth a try but I think you might I agree (if you get it fresh) that it needs some aging. This is the only reason I would buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Batch not dated. It clings nicely to the side of the glass. Almost translucent going into the glass. Aroma is deceivingly faint but very pleasant. Slightly sweet, deliciously malty with subtle yeast back that doesn't linger. Silky smooth going down. Fantastic holiday beverage!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really love this beer. I wish I had a fresh one to compare but I imagine that age has done wonders on this as it is so smooth. The greatest think is it was already five years old when I bought it for $5. Truly a steal."
""
""
"Rich, smooth, warming. Light effervescence, nearly full bodied. A solid coating of the upper palate develops quickly. Cloying is the word I want. Only real knock against it."
""
""
""
"This may be my favorite beer ever, which is saying a lot. I had a 2008 a few nights ago, which was wonderful, so I had to try the 06 for comparison. It just keeps getting better with age. Highly recommend a try, if you can find it! I was lucky enough to find 4 bottles of 2010 on the way home (a little something for later!)."
"Pours a significantly darker amber-brown. Smells like apple pie, and tastes like it too. No cinnamon, but the apples and buttery crust are both there. Not nearly as tasty as the fresher version, but interesting in it's own right. I'd drop the rating on the 2009 down to about a 3.9."
""
"O: This beer ages with the best if them. I've had older bottles, which I like even better than these. Either way, age integrates the flavors really well here. The sharpness I get with this beer when fresh is almost completely gone."
""
""
"Poured from bottle (2012 dated) to Unibroue tulip. Bright murky reddish orange pour with a big frothy head. Aromas of sour tropical fruit, dry oak, very slight vinegar, plums, white grapes, cherries. Flavor is a blast of bittersweet white grape and mango, alcohol heat going down, dryish finish. This is good. The alcohol is present and warm on the finish, but still goes down pretty easy. High carbonation with a medium slick mouthfeel. Very thick and strupy toward the end as it warmed. Unique flavor and somewhere between sour and dark Belgian quad. Really liking this! Would love to try the Reserva, but not gonna do that level of whale hunting."

"I forgot how fierce this beer was - the label implies a playful holiday ale, but it's far from that. A huge, potent masterpiece - something of a liquid fruitcake - layered and complex and densely packed. Yeasty, banana, clove, honey, booze, herbal and earthy, spiced bread. Lots of sediment. A classic - nice to try this one again"

"Full-bodied, complex Belgian ale - really enjoyed it the first time, but now just find it too sweet and boozy. Better with age, which dulls the sweetness."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2010. Gusher bottle upon opening, but I didn’t lose anything. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy orange amber color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big apple, pear, orange peel, raisin, grape, honey, caramel, banana, clove, floral, herbal, pepper, candi sugar, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big apple, pear, grape, raisin, fig, caramel, honey, banana, clove, candi sugar, herbal, floral, pepper, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, honey, banana, clove, candi sugar, floral, herbal, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester notes; with a very balanced malt backbone and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and full bodied; with a slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale! Big complexity and balance of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Glorious bier and De Dolle's best."
""
"The beer pours a relatively clear (speckled by some yeast) amber topped by a fluffy white head with modest lacing and a residual thin blanketing/halo. The nose is sweet and alcoholic, with yeast, honey, and a sun-dried fruitiness to it. The taste is also relatively sweet, slight caramel toastiness, grain, honey, raisin, booze, and a touch of bitter hops in the finish. It's approaching full-bodied, boozy, potently flavorful, gain-sweetness forward, and a bit too boozy to suck down quickly. I'd say this embodies the Belgian strong pale ale with its tremendous sweetness, yeast fruit, potent ethanol, and mild bitterness. This is probably not a repeat bottle for the price."

"Pours a hazed golden apricot with a foamy white head, thick lace and good retention. Aroma of bubblegum, yeast, peach, booze, banana and bread. Medium thick body, heavy carbonation and a soft body. Flavor is hotter than nose suggested, with a ton of fruit (grape, peach, pear) and bubblegum and bready malt."
"Overall. A very nice beer with dangerously well hidden high abv and lots of nice fruity belgian flavours."

"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a moderate to lighter level of carbonation. For being what I believe is a 10 year old bottle, the alcohol has not mellowed all that much in this offering. Regardless, it is a pretty fantastic brew and one I will be sure to purchase more of when I get the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol is definitely present and warms you up as this is a sipper and not something you would quaff but a treat to be savored."
""
""
""
""
""

"Fantastic beer, just superb, really hides the alc., I guessed it at 8%. It's just right in all the ways it tries to be, and they all play well together. Highest recommend."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An awesome Belgian strong pale ale. Very well balanced between fruit and spice with no booziness."
"Overall: This is a really interesting beer. You'd think this would be a sipper given the high sweetness and ABV, but it's surprisingly drinkable. I would definitely have this again, and would really like to try the Reserva version."
""
""
""
"As the beer closes, I don't feel that I have fully explored all of the beers slight nuances or it's powerful complexities. I simply hope that this review has given you a glimpse into the shallow impressions that I gained from this session. Still, a heightened sense of dryness, even at the determent of 10% abv. just might improve it's character."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall: That nose writes a check the rest of the beer can't cash. Wouldn't buy again, but would buy a candle smelling like it anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Kinda like they tried to make an imperial tripel. Harsh finish along with all sorts of yeasty biproducts. It does make for an interesting drink, though."
""
"O: Big fat meh for me here. I was very underwhelmed by this one. Not objectionable flavors perhaps, but the alcohol was too much. I've got another bottle to sit on, likely for another year. Will update if it's significantly different."
""
"O – A very pleasing, intense and complex beer. Has many of the same characteristics as Bush Blond, but seems to be more smooth and complex overall. It does not hide its alcohol at all, but allows it to remain blatant and blend with the overall sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really awesome beer. Glad I finally drank this bottle at the time that I did. Should really stock up on this one next time I see it. Complexity is brilliant here."
""
"A rusty-golden ale topped with a bubbly white head, tons of carbonation with some yeasty particles suspended within. Foamy lacing is washed away and then reappears with each sip. Aromas are bready yeast, floral, fruity, grape juice, apple juice, booze is non-existent. Flavors do not disappoint: very sweet with honey, apple, white grape juice, pear, peach, bready malt, Belgian yeast, slight spiciness, floral notes as well, buttery, again booze is non-existent other than being warming. Mouth-feel is creamy & rich with plenty of carbonation. Finishes semi-dry and very clean. Only making its second appearance as a Christmas Eve beer for me, but I'll make it a ritual and have it again each year hopefully for many years to come."
""
""
"O - Overall a delicious yet somewhat overwhelming beer for me. Been a while since I've had a strong Belgian Pale so my palate is still piecing it all together. Not sure what makes this their Christmas Holiday beer although I detect some spicyness but could simply be from the yeast. I do know it has a nice winter warming effect from the alcohol on a 25 degree day."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite for the style, but definitely well crafted and a little different. Very enjoyable take."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer (considering the noticeable alcohol presence), but this could stand to age for another 5-10 years. I think it will be even better once it mellows a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer blurs the line between wine and beer, it's real fascinating, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- One the best Belgian ales I've had. World class. Will definitely be getting more of this."
"Honey color with some floaties. Thin coating of foam. Smells of plum with a sharp alcohol note. Some caramel and roast. Very rich and sweet, but still quite hot. Good quad-barleywine hybrid, but could still mellow a bit."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is just awesome and I'm not sure there is one better on Earth, at least it's the best barleywine ever. This is the richest, tastiest beer I've ever drunk, it seems even better each time I drink one, and aging works wonders with this brew (I just can't imagine drinking something better than the one from 1987 I had a few weeks ago...)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great as a kind of sweet snack, in small quantities (not that you'd be drinking a pint of it, anyway). I feel that it's not as complex as its reputation might entail, but it's a fine beer. I'd probably prefer an Oer- or Arabier on most days, though, and the Oerbier Special Reserva on any day."
""
""
"The palate opens pretty big and sweet with honey, brown sugar and some spices. Age has wiped out the nugget hop flavor, muted the bitterness, and has added mild leathery and earthy notes. The alcohol, while well hidden, is fairly obvious, compromising sobriety rather quickly. The mid-palate is where all the complexity is expressed. Honey, stewed fruits (peaches, grapes, pears), some brown sugar as well as come caramel are all present. I'd say this is too sweet but for the leather that tames this just a hair. Medium-full in body with rather high carbonation, this beer has a long, sweet finish, almost saccharine in some ways, along with some spice. Despite that, it's very enjoyable, though best split two ways IMO. Not your prototypical BSPA."
""
"slightly lower numbers for taste because of the light oxidation, but still a stellar ale."
""
"Honey is at the forefront here. Reminds me of an English barleywine. Medicinality isn't present in the taste. Would love to try it with 5+ years of age."
"One of the best holiday beers I've had. Nothing really distinguishes it as a Christmas beer aside from the name, but as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, it's right up there with the best I've had."
"O - Trying to be objective and not finding a lot of enjoyment here. Balance of flavors not hitting me right. Maybe the age of the bottle and/or storage are affecting it."
""

"Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one during a recent tasting! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with some floaties with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, bread, fruit, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, dark fruit, bread, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. All aspects of this one were very good and quite inviting. The flavor however was a little above and beyond the rest of the brew. It was really smooth and easy to drink, but still had a nice alcohol sweetness bite on the followthrough. Definitely a must try from this vintage."
""
""
""
"O - A nice strong ale, a real winter warmer."
"O - I have had this one in the past and it was much better than this bottle. I will have to give this one another chance in the future because this bottle did not do it justice."
""
""
""
""
"Bottled 2000 drank summer 2011. Pours golden orange, mostly transparent with thin off white head. Nose has lots of malt sweetness, caramel, some sweet scotch, with light dark fruits in back. The flavor adds more wood notes and is far sweeter than expected. Full bodied, syrupy and creamy with a well balanced carbonation. A little sweet, interesting scotch notes."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer. A real pleasure to drink. A standout from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is dense and rich with creamy carbonation. It maintains its drinkability without being overly heavy. A tasty winter brew that is worthy of a good celebration :) Well worth seeking out - love me some De Dolle."
""
""
"O – This is a damn fine beer. Complex taste that just comes alive in your mouth. I am amazed that the ABV is so high. It really does not taste like it."
""
""
"O- This beer is almost overwhelmingly complex, and maybe this is what prevented me from giving it an even higher score. Still, it is greatly balanced and amazingly drinkable given its character and ABV. A top notch beer"
"O - A beer to think about. Not for everyone, but its worth a shot, even at $6 for an 11.2oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer."

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers last year this time, so it has about a year of age on it. Hazy yellow-orange pour with two finger head that fades quickly with excellent lacing. Yeasty, fruity Belgian nose with hints of grass, apricots, orange zest, alcohol, and a bit of lemon. Very bold, tart, yeasty, almost medicinal at first sip. Hints of candied fruit, specifically pineapple, along with cinnamon, phenols, orange zest, raisins, and a touch of pepper. Very complex, well balanced and ever changing as it warms. The carbonation is a bit much for me, but the drinkability is crazy for a 12% ABV. It's a sipper for sure, but there's something about this beer that draws you to it. Normally, this would be too sweet for my palate, but for some reason it's not. Can't wait for next weeks O.B.E.R. Kerstbierfestival to get some more!"
"TASTE: Mellow but bold alcohol taste, with a sweet citrus fruit, slight biter finish."
""
""
"O - Perfect christmas brew in my mind. Cereal Worthy definitely. I can imagine this one with christmas dinner. Oh baby"
""
"(O) It was good but a little too carbonated for me. I think with some more balance it would be top notch. Definitely doesn't drink like a 12% beer."
""
"Big foamy white head on this one with a nice golden colored body. The smell of this beer has some good Belgian yeast aromas with some bread and some spicy notes also. The taste of the beer is nice with a good amount of grainy flavors with some soft banana flavors in there. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth with some light carbonation in there. Overall this beer wasn't too bad, I would like to try it again someday."

"(D)- A solid little beer. If the carbonation level was not so robust, this would get top marks for the style, though I bet this is just divine with a few years on it."
"A delightful, fruity pale Belgiam with highly exaggerated yeast flavours. Excellent."
"O- kick ass!!!"
"time has treated this very well. at $4 a bottle, i will get more."
"Drink- This was a damn good beer. Enjoyed it a lot and will have to wrangle a few more bottles for the holidays."
"Poured a 1 1/4"" white head. Hazy light apricot colored body. The smell is very complex and fruity - dried fruit, pineapple, fig, citrus, light malt. The taste includes all the above plus spices like ginger, and some molasses. Medium weight body and a substantially long finish. It's a powerhouse of a pale ale packing the punch of a quad. Amazingly the 12% alcohol is well hidden among all the flavor so watch out, it will sneak up on you."
"Not in the mood it seems."
"O: I like this beer, but would like to see a little more balance. I'm not sure I could have handled it fresh. Well-done, but a little overpowering for my taste."
"I would put this on the ""good"" side of Belgian beers for me, which is significant, but because they aren't normally my bag. It's definitely tasty, and I like the complexity. My only real complaint is the alcohol heat, making me think that I might have liked the 8% version more."
"Thank God you can spend a good deal of time with this since it’s 12%. ABV is very well hidden, although you get a sense that something is up. Definitely don’t pound this one. I think it would pound you back. I’d love to grab a few more of these and let them cellar. Think I’ll look. Very nice beer."
"Reading through my notes makes me afraid to try this beer again. I'd be so disappointed to not find god again in a glass of Stille Nacht. "
"Mouthfeel was very smooth, with great carbonation. There was a nice slickness to it. Awesome beer."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Can't wait to age this one."
"O- de dolle can put together one hell of a brew. As complex as they get and yet accessible enough for the lay person to enjoy. A killer brew and one I'd like to lay down for a few years and see what it does."
"Overall: The score is to style as a ""strong pale ale"". If it was a “Belgian Barleywine” I would probably bump them up a little. I love De Dolle Brouwers, but this is just not a style of beer that hits my sweet spot (so to say)."
"o: delightfully complex, quad-like qualities in a lighter belgian, but by no means a light beverage. a serious sipper, the alcohol is a bit distracting."
"Overall - Really enjoyed this beer, SpinRSX shared it with me and it was all it was met to me. Would seak out again for sure."
"Overall – It’s been a while since I’ve had a beer that wow’d me as much as this did. The flavours are amazing and the taste is very complex. Pretty much everything about the beer is near perfect and I’d be happy to have this again anytime. This beer falls into the ‘must try’ category for sure."
"WS"
"Overall: An excellent and complex example of the style. From the funky wild aroma through the spicy aroma and flavor, through the sweet, balanced, and warm finish. This brew is highly-recommended!"
"overall always one of the best, nice to be able to get it when i want now."
"O: My favorite beer for the style. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys the Belgian art of brewing. Cheers!"
"Stille Nacht is an unplaceable, awesome beer for me. I think all of De Dolle's beers are like this, to a certain degree, but Stille Nacht does something the others don't. After finishing almost any of De Dolle's beers, I inevitably look back on what just happened with awe, and wonder where that awesome drink I just had in my hand disappeared to. Now that's a high compliment, but with this particular De Dolle beer, I'm happy to find that this statement does not apply. This beer more than any of their others strikes a balance in which I'm perfectly happy to see the drink go, because the last sip comes just when I hope it will. It's just as satisfying as it needs to be. What a great brewery."
"Overall. ABSURDLY well balanced. This beer has consistently blown me away. I'd say the 09' vintages will still be drinking miraculously through at least 2013 (though most certainly longer under ideal conditions). One of the best Belgian beers I've ever had. World Class."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, ridiculously well hidden kick, nice representation of style. This is a nice beer to sit with for a while."
"This is an extremely good beer, and although I found it to be a little hot, it's only a minor gripe-it doesn't put me off very much at all. I could smell this all day. Definitely a heady little treat. Love it."
"D-hands down, this is the best belgian pale ale i've ever had. i had almost given up on this style after finding Duvel, La Chouffe, Gnommegang, Don de Dieu, and other to be only mediocre and not very drinkable. this is perfect. i love it.there are no negative side tastes. the only bad thing is that this bottle isn't large enough. i genuinely could drink this all night long."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: With this ABV and the overall level of sweetness, this is definitely a one a night beer. Sipping had to be taken slowly but was a pleasure each time. I’m glad I tried this and look forward to having it again one day and maybe even to getting a few to age a bit. My overall impression is of a beer that pushes the limits and walks the thin line between being too sweet and well balanced. At the moment this is balanced just right for the bitterness to prevent the sweetness from cloying."
"Full bodied with high carbonation, and a sweet aftertaste. This is a bit sweeter and boozier than I would like it to be, but what did I expect when the abv is 12%? This is still a good beer, and is worth trying if you get the chance."
"I suppose I could see this beer really blowing some people away if they happen to be looking for just these aspects (heavy bitterness, lots of carbonation, deep development of yeasty flavor), and I *would* seek out more beer by this brewery. For my tastes, though, there's many better (and cheaper) BSPAs available, so I doubt I'll return to this one."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a nice 2 inch off-white head that lasts. Very tiny and thin lace strands on the glass on the drink down. Smells of tropical fruits, spices, and yeast. Taste is of malt, candied fruits, spices, and yeast. Extreme level of carbonation here. It seems like this is more carbonated than a soda would be even. Very prickly and fizzy on the throat. I am not sure if it is meant to be this carbonated, but I do not care for this. A bit of alcohol burn on the drink down. Overall, this a good beer but the carbonation is not what I expected from this style."
"D - This reaffirms my belief that after enough time most beers start to taste the same. Reminds me a lot of the '04 Westy I had yesterday. Easy to drink 4oz, but I'd rather have this fresh."
"jd"
"Enjoy this one, but not as much as De Dolle's other offerings. It's a very big beer."
"Note: 2009 vintage"
"D- A pretty awesome Belgian strong pale; I'm definitely going to sit on a few of these and see what some age can do to the. Mellowing out the alcohol a bit could make this beer even more incredible."
"probably the most drinkable 12% beer I've had"
"Reminded by the feeling afterwards, this is a 12% abv beer and that has been well hidden by the sweet/sour/yeasty flavors of this most interesting winter ale. This has been one of my go-to winter ales and continues to be that. With so many flavors and things happening on my tongue its hard not to see what the next bottle will bring to my taste buds."
"Pours a very murky (can't see through at all) orange color with a large white, frothy head. Scent is spicy with some very strong sweet fruit aromas.I get a lot of orange peel, bananas, and green apples. There is also some Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is very yeasty and a bit funky. Lots of delicious spice with some funk and bread-like characters. I get coriander and banana, along with orange peel, slightly sour green apples, white grapes, and sweet honey. Tons of flavors in this beer. And the 12%ABV is insanely well-hidden! Mouthfeel is dry and full bodied with immense flavor. Well carbonated and complex! Drinks so damn easily! Drinkability is scary high for such a big beer."
"D - Just too sweet and boozy to go very high here. No way would I have been able to drink more than 1 bottle, and I am a real fan of big, high ABV beers."
"Light carbonation as it should be for the style with a medium mouthfeel. highly drinkable for the abv that this clocks in at. Easily recommendable to try"
"D: You know you are drinking something enormous and you want to savor every last drop. The alcohol plays its role beautifully and in perfect balance with every other component. I'm not sure I'd pair this with food. It should be enjoyed on a stage by itself."
"D: Opened two bottles at once--one for me and one for the missus. She did not like it (""where is my St. Bernardus Abt 12?""), so I got both 11.5 oz bottles. Feeling pretty good halfway through the 2nd bottle, but that's probably my limit. I would not want to drink more than two, as it's too sweet. Almost better as an after dinner beer."
"Notes: Think this is mislabeled as a Belgian Strong Dark. It's incredibly pale..."
"d - Overall this is a nice Belgian dark, but the alcohol shines through a bit too much. I loved the smell and it looked great, but the taste and alcohol warmth knocked it down a bit. Would have again but wouldn't go through any hassel to buy. Maybe I'll pick one up for the cellar."
"D: This is too big to have one of these alone, in my opinion. I enjoyed the beer, but getting through the whole bottle myself was semi difficult. A nice beer that I'll have to get again and age for years and years before cracking it open."
"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a tulip. Cap shows this beer was bottled in 2008. Been wanting to try this winter warmer for some time now. The beer pours orange amber with a great big low-density foamy head which lasted pretty much throughout leaving nice laces every sip. The aroma is complex - sweet malt, white candy, and a hint of tangerine fill out the fruit flavors; leather and wood lend a certain sophistication to the nose; strong caramel hints at a sweet beer to follow with the first sip. Alcohol is abundant in the aroma, especially early on. The flavor, nearly three years in, is very nice. Somewhat sweet but not overly so, dark caramel and baked apples before the taste twists nicely and plenty early into well-hopped finish. Pepper and again some leather add interest midway, along with a cognac and golden raisins perhaps. Unfortunately, the aggressive carbonation and a ton of sediments detracts from the mouthfeel, making this beer - which seems otherwise perfect for savoring on the tongue - hard to drink in that way. The alcohol is predominant, which is understandable, for 12% ABV. I came to this beer with high hopes, and I'm not disappointed. It loses a few points on the palate - I'm not big on beer with heavy sediments floating around. It was an interesting experience now that I've had two De Dolle beers - seems like their beers have a tendency to bang out big foamy heads and complex flavors worth deliberating over."
" pours a nice slightly amber gold with thick white head, decent lacing, left most of the yeast in bottom of bottle to try later. Flavour is of yeast, slight hops, sweet malt, banana, sugar, and some fruity esters. Flavor matches well, but is a bit too sweet for my liking. Alcohol was pretty well hidden, but obviously still there. Pretty decent,"
"Pours a hazy, dark orange with lots of little floaties swirling around. Just beautiful. Tastes of sweet candi sugars with a hint of fruits like apple and pear. I think this bottle is lying when it says its 12% alc. That is ridiculous. Very easy to drink and I am detecting no hotness at all to this. Very tasty treat. Rock on De Dolle!"
"D: Overall, way too sweet and alcoholic. Although this one isn't hot in the traditional sense, the ethanol taste is a bit overwhelming at times. Would love to try one with a bit more age on it to see if it mellows out, but as is, decent but a bit underwhelming."
"Pours a hazy, dark amberish golden with an initial solid white head which fades to bubbles around the edges of the glass. Smell is a nice combination of dried fruit skins (grapes, plums), honey sweetness, bready yeast, malty spice, and a faint woody essence. Some alcohol heat is present too. Taste is boozy dark fruits, carmel, brown sugar, with a yeasty mild sour finish. Mouthfeel is slick and oily and rich. Overall, a sipper for a cool winter night."
"drinks slowly, yet well. a huge beer, but with enough flavor and nuances that you want to sip and savor for a while."
"A good beer to sit down with for an extended period to best take in all it has to offer. At 12% ABV it's going to be a sipper anyway. One and done, but really what isn't at an ABV that high?"
"Drinkability is hurt by the massive alcohol kick but the flavours are anything but uninteresting. Me likes a lot."
"D: drinkable but not too at the ABV level"
"This is an epic beer, I have seen it on the shelf for years now, I am glad I bought it finally."
"Its vigorous quirks and steamroller strength are exactly what make the beer so deserving of its notoriety as a classic Christmas time tipple. Its savory spiciness and warming qualities are perfectly suited to the festivities of the holidays and stashing a few of these in the cellar for future Christmases is indeed a wonderful gift to give yourself."
"Drinkability: Alone one maybe two is plenty, after all it is 12%. It's a beer I have in my Christmas line up each year and one I look forward to."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are very good. It's diverse, I'd say medium to full bodied. Even though it's unfiltered ti doesn't leave that yeasty feeling in your mouth that bad that many of this style do. This beer is technically a winter style but could really be used as a year round beverage in my opinion. I'm not a fan of this style, but I found this beer to be absolutely wonderful."
"D: Of the many different brews there is for the winter season, I like this one in the Belgian Strong Dark ale. For an all around everyday brew, this might be one I would get for a good goto strong ale."
"Its a slow sipper, and one is enough. There is way too much going on to enjoy several."
"This is a big beer, the flavor is intense and spicy, and the alcohol is high. A beer to be reserved for special occasions."
"A very nice and fulfilling beer, perfect after dinner, with the cheese. 2008 Vintage."
"Wow the mad brewers do know how to make some great beers. The yeast is the star of the show as most Belgian beers are and it does not dissapoint. The 12% alcohol is well balanced in this beer, meaning you feel its presence but it is not in your face. Reallly excellent well crafted brew, Enjoy."
"To make matters worse, the mouthfeel is characterized by a flat and syrupy thick liquid.  That's it.  Life is too short to drink bad beer like this and even shorter to write about them.  An utter abomination.  When I type Stille Nacht into google it asks me if I meant Still Nacho.  I wish I did.  Even stillborn nachos would be better than this."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. It had the right amount of booze showing. It had some solid sweet flavors, but still had a nice malt backbone to even things out. The cereal grain worked well with this beer. I dig it. Decent drinkability."
"Bottle. Cap says 2003, assume that is the year this was bottled. Pours a cloudy hazed apricot orange/brown color with very minimal head. What head there is collars around the glass in an off white color. Smells sweet with hints of apricot and pear. The taste is pretty sweet as well with an undertone of alcohol. Apricot flavors is all I have in my mind, in a god way, as this drinks very smooth. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. White grapes in the taste as well. Some lace left on the glass as I drink this down. This is very good, sweet, but good."
"I poured this beer into a tulip glass and it had a two finger fluffy head. It tasted medium-bodied. This beer is highly drinkable. The aroma smells somewhat fruity. It is very smooth to the taste. I hope to visit the De Dolle brewery and look forward to trying more of their beers."
"Overall - A truly decadent beer that makes for a great dessert or nightcap. This is among the better BSDA's I've had. Definitely worth hunting down or picking up if spotted!"
"Pours a glowing candy apple orange with a thin white film atop. Nose is really signature De Dolle yeast, apples, tropical fruit, maybe a touch of caramel. Flavor is a myriad of things. Some tripel elements but so much more, segues from an apple / tropical fruit into a lavish, lightly sour, almost winey finish. This bottle has a bit too much bitterness on the back palate. The best vintages are sweet and candy-like but finish dry and have a kind of sour funk to them. It's a magical beer, probably best to let it age for a couple years."
"Ppours dark brown with an off white head with a bit of lacing. The nose fits the style quite well with good notes of dark fruits, caramel, and a bit of booze. The taste and mouthfeel combine together quite well. There is a nice creamy character that accentuates the dark fruit and caramel flavors. Overall, a well done beer that I think would be quite a bit better with some age on it."
"Overall impression: delicious! reminiscent of alcoholic cider."
"Drinkability -- Bought this on sale at my local bottle shop and it appears that soon I'll be back to purchase more. I can imagine this being quite boozy fresh, but after a year it's drinking rather well. After a few more years I bet this will drink like a champ. Phenomenal."
"D: It's too bad that this beer was so alcohol forward. I'll look to revisit this beer in the future (possibly with an aged bottle), hoping this was an aberration."
"D: I shared this beer with a friend and was left wanting more. I could have easily had the whole thing. 2 may have been to much. This is a perfect sipping beer for a cool night or a night cap. Although, being a 2003 vintage, it's going to be a rare and special night. A must try if you can get your hands on one."
"I was surprised that the color of this beer was not dark at all, but rather a hazy golden sunset hue. The beer has a medium-small white head that recedes pretty quickly, leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aromas consist of Belgian yeast, alcohol, and delectable fruity esters. Stille Nacht has a very bold and brash flavor, with a heavy alcohol presence. I would really like to sample some older vintages, as I imagine this beer ages quite gracefully. Despite the deceptive appearance, this beer tastes remarkably like a quad. The feel is very good and the heat is even enjoyable. This spicy beer was a tasty treat. I look forward to stashing a few of these away in the cellar."
"D: An excellent, drinkable beer."
"OVERALL: By far the best beer I've had from De Dolle. The alcohol burn makes it a little tougher to drink, but it is still an enjoyable sipper to help warm you up in the winter. The palate also delivered on this one, which cannot be said for their other offering, so the alcohol burn was kept in check by the creaminess of the body. Check it out if you get the chance."
"I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to sample such an amazing beer. Kudos to the brewers at De Dolle for making such a fantastic elixir and to the folks at Erasmus for presenting this beer to me in optimal condition. I simply cannot have imagined a better way to finish my meal. Drinking this was surely the highlight of my Belgian beer odyssey."
"Notes - Let's give credit to De Dolle. This brewery makes real quality beers. Ive yet to be disapointed."
"D - very very easy to drink more than 1 11.3 (330ml) bottle."
"Grabbed a marked down bottle of this at Downtown Wine and Spirits today. I like the label with the little snowman on it. It pours a murky, dark orange color, with a solid inch of white heading. Alcohol can be smelled right off the bat after the pour, along with some honey and ripe dark fruit. More of the same from the taste, which is very nectar like if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel is definitely on the hefty side, and rather hot, though I am not sure what year this bottle is. The heightened alcohol does hurt the drinkability a bit, but if you sip this one slowly, your good to go. Overall a nice Belgian beer from De Dolle. I will visit this ale again when it gets a bit colder out. Cheers"
"D - Most excellent indeed. I would buy this. 4.5"
"Nice carbonation for such a heady brew. The smell is a combination of mead and madiera with some orange. Somehow, i don't smell a lot of boose even with it being 12%. The taste is very madeira-like more than anything else, which is right up my alley. Taking my first few sips, i guessed the alcohol content was maybe around 8-9%; 10% at the most. I was surprised to see that it was 12%. The taste of the boose is there, but it's extremely well balanced against the hops and the malt. This beer is way too drinkable for how strong it is. I know I should sip it carefully with my pinky stuck out, but I can't help but take one big sip after another. This is truly a magical beer, even by De Dolle's standards."
"No way it could be anyone's everyday beer, but it is an easy sipping beer."
"D: Although sweet and a little boozy this is a really pleasant sipper, especially at 12%. Too much would upset my stomach though."
"D- I am into it for sure. The complexity of this beer will keep me going back for more."
"D - Just too hard for me to drink as it was so rich, need something to cut the sweetness and depth of this, food, or something else."
"Drinkability: exceptionally drinkable, especially considering its larger-than-life ABV. While I think there are some imperfections in the flavor, it's still very good and has a helluva lot going for it."
"A very solid beer, the more belgians i have, the more i realize that there aren't enough categories for them, perhaps that is the point. Really loved the nose on this, taste didn't quite meet expectations, but still very good nonetheless."
"Pours a hazy golden color, not what I was expecting for a BSDA. Big white head, decent lacing. Smell is almost sour, some big yeasty notes, some lemon zest, a hint of darker fruit, some clove and some booze. Taste is more BSDA like--clove, banana, dark fruit, yeast, and unfortunately a lot of booze. Medium mouthfeel, not as big as I would like, drinkability is ok, but the phenol/booze content here kind of slows it down for me. I might have to revisit it."
"D - ABV blends nicely at 12%."
"Not my favourite ale from the mad brewers, but it's good."
"All of De Dolle's beers are big Belgians, but this one takes the cake in terms of intensity. Would love to put some age on a few bottles."
"D- a big and complex bsda. Run a tad a on the sweet side but it is a holiday beer so compliments the season well with it big abv and spicy flavors. Think I'll buy a couple of these to age seems like the potential for even greater complexity is very good."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid. With the intensity of a strong, sweet brew, it's definitely a slow-sipper for me and the small, singular bottle is more than plenty."
"Overall, this is a great Belgain brew. Sweet and malty with light fruits. This is my second time trying this and I've enjoyed it quite a bit both times. Really glad I have another bottle to age in the cellar. Worth seeking out."
"D: Both bottles are gone out this, but damn, a great beer with this much age on it."
"This beer has certainly become very elegant over the years and the 12% are well hidden. The 45 DKK (~4) we paid were money very well spent. This is truly a five star beer."
"Try this beer, a delight."
"This, my second review, was considerably different than the first, which consisted of much more carbonation and sharper acetic and citric tones that were good but not nearly as representative of the delicate richness otherwise found in this beer. This is one of my favorite styles, and my first review didn't seem to suggest much of the same beer found in other reviews. I sense that the flavors and aromas described in this review are more consistent with it's usual character. A phenomenal beer with a lot of incredible balance and craft presenting in a blend that ages remarkably well (I've tasted it over 10 years old in the past)."
"D--I can't remember the last time I drank something so compelling--wine and liquor included. A triumph. I'll be back."
"Superb. Exquisite. Damn near perfect."
"An 11.6 ounce bottle given to me as a bonus by one of the employees of Shawan Liquors in Hunt Valley. The cap has no date, just a laser jetted ""xxx", so I have no idea what vintage this is. I've had it for about 3 years so it is at least that old. Uncapped and poured into my tulip glass. The ale appears a hazed, muted golden amber color with about a finger of cream colored foam. The nose and flavors consist of candi sugar, caramel, honey (yeah, it's quite sweet), fruits such as orange, tangerine, plums, spicy prickly yeast, sweet biscuits, warming spices and a trace of alcohol heat. A notch or two better than medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Really nice. I would like to soak some french toast in this. Overall, the sweetness hurts the drinkability a bit. I had to break out some extra sharp aged cheddar to cut the sugar."
"D: Delicious beer, and one I would love to have again. Probably too sweet and too potent to have more than a bottle of."
"Though superior to either, this shares some of the qualities of Scaldis and Scaldis Noel, which makes me think some cellar time is essential for these high ABV vintages. So, perhaps I'll be able to add a rating bump/re-review in a few years. Time will tell."
"D - This will kick your ass, but I still have to rank anything this fabulous as very drinkable. Y.O.L.O. Live it up..."
"D- A hot 12%, leaving a pleasant burning sensation in the mouth, throat, and stomach. Moderate drinkability considering the level of alcohol, but more than one would be dangerous."
"D: too quaffable -- it's so smooth"
"D: A classic Christmas beer right here, another De Dolle classic, I wish I could try the already legendary 2000 vintage."
"The 330ml is plenty - a sipper, no doubt, and worth the time to explore & enjoy."
"Pours a slightly murky brownish-yellow with a one finger white head, which stays around until the glass was empty. The aroma is Belgian yeast with bready malts and some unidentifiable fruit. The flavor is alcohol and strawberries. You also get some yeast, caramel malt and some sugary sweetness. The alcohol is very warming. I also got some slight banana notes as the beer warmed but they were faint. The beer gets fruitier as it warms. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel."
"Good feel and drinkability."
"Perhaps, the name and reputation made me sit and think about this beer more than most, but Stille Nacht has more complexity and soul than nearly any beer I've tried. It's rich and full, just perfect for a frosty night."
"330 ml bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. 2008 on white cap. Huge, huge off-white head sits for all of eternity above a murky, gold body. I note some strange flakes sitting in the foam, looks like cinnamon? I have no idea what it is, I'm not concerned. Aroma is pure funkiness, not in a bad way. Taste is a blend of sour, sweet and bitter. Some tart apples, some sweetness from the sugar and the age, slight alcohol taste, extremely minimal noting 12% abv. A delicious amalgam of many, many different flavors."
"Dry and pleasant. I like it. Good pick for the winter time."
"O: Great drinkability. Excellent beer"
"For 12%, this doesn't hurt much at all. The moderate fruity sweetness masks a lot of alcohol, I think. One 12oz bottle isn't much of a problem."
"A delicious but intense brew. I was hoping to get in more reviews at this event but after this monster I have a feeling palate fatigue will set in soon so I'll stop here."
"D: A winner."
" $5.67 for 11.6 oz. bottle Insanely complex for this style."
"The beer is a little sour and has a strong taste that I associate with tripels. The mouthfeel is a little thin and the drinkability is high. There is almost like an apple character to this beer. Beer is quite interesting and it lingers in the back of the mouth for a moment."
"2008 bottling. This is possibly the best holiday ale I've had to date. It really looks like a a BSPA with a light coloring for a dark ale. Light creme headthat fade kinda fast, not much lace. Smell is full of caramel, cookies, vanilla, butterscotch. Light hop florals. Taste is superb smooth sweet maltiness lays down a bed for the light holiday cookie and spice profile. Delicious fruitiness with apples, grapes, bananas and more. Honey drips in. Finish is dry and clean with a slight warming and sweet alcohol that fades to light spice that features nutmeg. Some graham and cookie dough as well. Feel is so beautifully carbonated and supple on the tongue even though it is close to full you just don't notice it. Creamy. Super drinkable, the abv is nowhere to be found as it is so well integrated into the taste. You can go through several if these if you are not careful. Wow! I am going to get a pair of these and cellar them for next year to have with a pair of fresh."
"D: Unbelievably drinkable for the ABV. Delicious and complex with a lighter-than-can-be-imagined feel. A really good beer that is best for a cold Christmas night -- I might have to make this an annual excursion."
"Definitely worth a shot. You'll be surprised at the contrast of flavors for the style."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is very thick, I believe this beer is 27plato, which is huge for the style, but I love it. there's also a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is fairly low in terms of quanitiy, since the flavor is so intense it would be hard to drink two. Drinkability on a single bottle is great though...very enjoyable."
"Flavors of caramel are up front with that Belgian yeasty taste. Lots of complex dark fruit combines well with a heavy mouth feel and tight abundant carbonation. The finish is long and sweet with lots of warmth from the relatively high alcohol. Overall a very nice experience."
"M/D - Very lively feel with excellent carbonation. Easy drinking given how big the alcohol and flavors are."
"Taste is exceptional right away, carbonated, sweet and spicy leaving way to a very sweet and fruit aftertaste. Great beer...can't wait to age this more!"
"smells like a lambic but is not"
"Poured an amber color with a thick white head that I had to let die down before I could pour more than half of the bottle. Smells sweet malty,fruity with some alcohol. Tastes of sweet fruit/malt with some bitterness cutting the sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and very carbonated almost as much as Duvel. Drinkability is good for a 12% beer, I may have to put it on my list of holiday beers."
"Just bought bottle, dated 2006. Pours an amber brown with half a finger of crème head. Smell is of a sweet wine. Alcohol is apparent. Brandy soaked plums. A little bit of spice. Taste is malty and caramely and somewhat sweet. A lot of fruit. Some diacetyl. More brandy soaked plums. Maybe pear? Alcohol in the back, going down nice and warm. Mouthfeel is creamy with a good amount of bubbles. Very drinkable for 12%."
"Notes: My first from De Dolle. This beer is certainly interesting enough to seek more out from De Dolle and I will be doing that at The Beer Engine in the near future."
"D - It's a sipper and not quite as easy to down as an Arabier or Lichtervelds Blond, but with how tasty it is, it keeps you wanting another sip. They don't all have to be chuggable."
"Amazing carbonation. Grape, apricot fruits follow the nose. Soft malt - kind of nutty and biscuit. No bright esters as in nose. Minor alcohol notes. Zesty spicy. Mild kiss of malt in finish. Minor chocolate. Nice fruit. Bright spicy carbonation. Tastes good. Feels very good. Good drinkability."
"D - A great tasting ale, very easy to quaff until you realize how potent this tasty beer is! An easy to drink 12% is a like few others. I can't help but think the 9 months have given this bottle a smoother drinkability but considering the fullness of flavor it could be cellared for several years without problem. An excellent Belgian strong ale."
"A+ one of the best beers I have ever had."
"D: It is a bit of a sipper since its such a high ABV and has quite a warming effect."
"Had this last night as part of a De Dolle session. Poured an amber color with offwhite head that faded somewhat slowly and left plenty of good lacing. Also had quite a bit of sediment in it. Smelled of dark fruits, yeast, and alcohol (almost brandy-like). Tasted sugary, yeasty, and fruity (dark fruits). Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, but otherwise smooth. The alcohol stung a little bit, bet this one would age nicely."
"Pours a big, bubbly light amber, like a cider. Big puffy head that still has a good 1/4 inch on it an hour later. An absolute ton of yeast floaties, it appears like 50/50 beer and floaties. Really don't taste them, though. Also some appear as black flecks in the head. Aroma is strongly spicy and floral, with a big boozey sense. A lot like it tastes, except it works a lot better on the nose. First of all, this is a slick, floral beer. It also tastes soapy, like you sometimes get in very hoppy beers. This isn't hoppy, but still soapy. Also, it tastes acetic to me. Like vinegar, but I don't get any oxidization, so I don't think it is that. Third, it is spicy. Like crazy spicing, even more than you get normally from Christmas beers. Fourth, it is boozey. A definite sipper, but even then, it is still an adventure. Some burn going down the throat. These flavors tend to dominate. Some pluminess, and a bit of sweetness, but overall these two are subdued by the rest. If this was what the brewers were going for, it is very well made. If not, maybe I have a bad bottle, I don't know. But this is a struggle to get through. It is bubbly and big and carbonated, but all of those other aspects just aren't melding well for me."
"Nothing else really different than the other reviews. I would think this beer is best aged for no more than 4-5 years."
"This poured a nearly opaque light mahogany with tons of light tan head. It smelled like lots of lemons and wild Belgian yeast, with some orange and coriander and earthy caramel malt, and a bit of brown sugar and alcohol. It tasted like zesty lemon and orange hops with wild Belgian yeast and earthy brown sugar, with lots of spices and a bit of alcohol. It was watery with lots of smooth carbonation, and a spicy aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty complex beer with a nice clean taste and great bottle conditioned body. Not quite as dark or malty as I hoped. Alcohol was noticeable, and with such complexity, this is definitely a sipping beer. It took a long time to pour before drinking due to the massive head, and I've heard that this is better aged. So this beer takes a long time to fully enjoy! But it could be worth the wait."
"The mouthfeel is as smooth as can be. excellent drinkability. One of the best beers I have had the luxury of experiencing, thanks guys."
"M - Creamy, velvety, smooth, good carbonation."
"11.6 ounce bottle, 2008 vintage as stated on botttlecap. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an orange/amber color (with some floaties) and has about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, lacing is decent. It smells like nutmeg, yeast, honey, pears, plums, and a bit of pepper. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes fruity and spicy, like plums, pepper, yeast, apricots, orange peel and nutmeg. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick but has a little bit too much carbonation for me. But with that being said, it was still easy to drink as it's quite smooth. The carbonation is soft so it doesn't hurt the drinkability too much. The 12% ABV isn't too noticable at all. I enjoyed this beer a lot, I'd buy this again in the future. Recommended."
"D - A bit too strong and heavy, plus you lose a good % to foam."
"In short: A viscous, boozy brew with bittersweet fruity tartness reminiscent of a candied citrus peel ."
"D) This is wonderful stuff but beware -- packs a serious punch."
"The body is just right, mild carbonation that pops in your mouth at each sip."
"this brew pours up a murky apricot color with an immaculate white head. great lacing. the nose is light fruits, slight funk, subtle sourness. the taste is light fruits again, nice sweet citrus, very apparent citrus and floral hops, slight alcohol warmth, heavy carbo in the finish yet very smooth carbo, full bodied, sweet finish. I dig it"
"Overall a tasty brew. I would have it again for sure."
"Drinkability- The alcohol is definitely very well hidden, not something I could see my self having often and maybe not again, but it was an interesting and experience and very unique, the 12 percent will knock you on your butt and you wont even see it coming, nothing that really dazzled me though, had better."
"Soft and fluffy mouthfeel, unlike any other beer. Wow! Easy drinker for the abv, one of my favorites all time!!"
"2008 vintage served at 53 degrees in my New Belgium Globe glass. Gusher off the cap pop (this is really getting old). Poured the color of apple cider. Hazy clarity with lots of yeast floaties in solution and vigorous effervescence from the nucleation point in the bowl of the glass. Four inch frothy, off-white head slowly dissipated leaving behind thick strands of lacing (at least the head retention was good), before settling into a solid cap. Nose suggests apples and a metallic character. Taste consistent with nose, but also picked up a fairly complex spice profile, a little peppery, and a little alcohol heat, but not at all boozy. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent. Not my favorite from De Dolle, but a decent amount of complexity and nice overall character."
"Overall, this was one solid beer. I will definitely have to compare this with a fresh one to note the differences. Highly recommend aging this one."
"Hey, it ends up being a little on the heavy side but the complexity acquits itself nicely. Maybe something I won't reach for every day but a well-done effort nonetheless. Good change-up."
"Definitely a sipper, but one I would buy again without hesitation. I have never been disappointed with a de Dolle beer."
"A slow-sipper - Didn't have on Christmas... but, it was a nice warmer on a cold day in very early March after a heavy snowstorm."
"D - At 12% I dare say this is a once in a while beer, I could not drink more than one of these every once in a while, but it is so so good."
"D= This was another good ale from DeDolle, but IMO its not one of their best. Both Oerbier and the Mad Bitch are better. Still its worth a try for all fans of the brewery and/or the style."
"This beer is most definitely a sipper. The alcohol makes for a great winter warmer, but after one bottle that was enough."
"Got a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for $4.75. This was a mild gusher, so beware when you open this baby. It poured with an amber body, white head, and small floaties a la Brasserie des Rocs. This beer strikes me as a touch plain for all the ingredients that have gone into it. At first, the carbonation is too sharp to taste anything, but once it settles there's a delicate mix of acidic citrus and orange peel with earthy hops and sweet sugar-topped bread. Fairly drinkable once the carbonation dies down. But for the strength (and price) I'd expect more character."
"This is a beer to be savored but that does not mean that I will not savor several of them in a single, very long and happy sitting."
"and why can't they do something about the gushers?!"
"Pours a golden fizzy, dark yellow color. Humungeous head, lasting, white. Hoppy grapey bitter aroma, fresh-lots of grape. Coriander, fresh biting taste, sour, wine-ish. Can taste some of the alcohol, warming. Warming up, a more fruity aroma, fruit punch. Also more fruit punchy taste."
"Another winner from one of my favorite Belgium brewers."
"taste was quite nice. medium body beer that had a really nice balance. predominantly malts dancing around - brown sugar, carmelized malts. decent amount of carbonation but not so much that is was negative."
"This is a standout beer"
"blown away. super complex. not for the beginner. less peppery and boozy as it warmed up. caramel, toffee, fruit, esters, herbs, pepper, and on and on and on... too much to even get into. well balanced for such a monster. a must for the big huge belgian beer fan."
"Enjoyed a bottle of the 2005 edition in early Jan 2009 at the Kulminator in Antwerp. Pours a dark burnt orange copper with a nice tan head. Fruity, malty, and spicy smell. This baby is full of comlex spicy, dark, winter, candy, and light fruity flavor that comes together beautifully. What a nice, complex beer that packs a nice punch for winter with equally nice balance and flavor. Highly recommended."
"This is a crowd pleaser for me. The complex palate, cloudy yeast body, and overall aggressiveness are very impressive."
"D: Nicely balanced with the spicing complimenting the warming nature of the beer instead of drowning it out like other xmas beers."
"Drinkability is good. This is a two-and-out beer, but I would be looking forward to the second one. A nice Christmas beer/winter warmer. I would put this on in my winter roster!!!"
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale."
"I've got another bottle. Maybe I'll crack it open for the 25 Beers of Christmas '09...or '10."
"One of the better beers I've had in a while, and most likely the best I have ever had with 12% abv or higher."
"Reviewed on 4/25/08. Bottle. Initially pours a clear orange/amber, but once the yeast is poured in (it doesn't cake at the bottom), the beer becomes quite cloudy. Aroma of light fruits (apple, pear). Flavor of these same fruits, spices, plus a strong alcohol presence. I liked the light fruit notes in this beer...but they didn't go very well with the 12% abv. Side by side with the Boskeun, I'd say that I like the flavor of Still Nacht better, but overall, the beer was less balanced and too alcoholic at times. 7/4/7/4/13 (3.5/5)"
"Mouthfeel is full, but it's a little syrupy."
"D. Excellent beer, a great winter beer!"
"Overall I was in a good place after I finished this beer. One of the better darker Belgians that I've had in quite some time. Be sure to pick this one up and give it a shot."
"The Mad Brewers don't make a bad beer, but this is probably their best."
"This is one that needs to sit a bit before drinking, both to tame the incredible head and to allow it to warm and open up a bit. After that, however, this is a stellar brew. I'm sorry I bought only one. I'll definitely be looking for more of these. A truly remarkable brew."
"This is definitely a beer I'd want to drink on a cold winter night. I'd also like to grab an extra bottle or two to put in the cellar to age for 3-5 years. I do enjoy it, but it's not a beer I'd drink on a regular basis. I'm glad I bought a bottle. I will probably buy one or two more to age, and see how well they hold up. However, Stille Nacht is not a beer I'm going to keep on my drink often list."
"steak with a bleu cheese and anchovie garnish in the equation highly recommended."
"De Dolle Stille Nacht pours a hazy apricot color with a white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Sweet golden fruit dipped in brandy would describe the aroma. The flavor is similar, golden fruit (although not as sweet as the aroma it's stii pretty sweet), and a hint of alcohol. I definitely feel some warming from the alcohol. Very good."
"The smell is fruity and spicy. With the first sip you are hit with familiar Belgian yeasty-ness and a in your face spiciness. It is on the rather sweet side and is of brown sugar. The alcohol is really present but isn't burning. It is full bodied and encompassing. There is a tiny bit of hop bitter on the finish. Overall a very enjoyable Belgian Strong Dark."
"D- this was my first time trying something by de dolle and i think ill search out more from them. a little too strong to have more than one at a time, but it has a very unique and distinct taste that im sure ill find myself seeking out fairly often."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet. Dark goldenrod/grey poupon color with a sticky white head. Great lacing with ample legs. Completely hazy. Aromas of freshly baked bread, overripe apricot, raisins, and cinnamon. Flavor is very sweet, with banana and peach esters that melt into a brown sugar finish. Lots of yeast and spice, even a little hop bitterness towards the back of the palate. Full bodied, but even so there's just too much carbonation. A couple of modest sips result in an appreciable belch. Chewy, caky mouthfeel, no alcohol flavors. Drinkability takes a hit from all the CO2. Very good beer."
"D - Wow, an amazingly complex beer. There is a bit of a disconnect between the dark flavors in this beer and its relatively light color. The carbonation borders on being a bit too high and the alcohol is kind of hot, but these minor flaws are overshadowed by the complexity, especially of the aroma. Overall I am quite impressed with this beer and I can't wait to try some more of De Dolle's other offerings."
"Take care with 12% ABV... it's easy to get drunk...."
"Pours a really nice dark copper orange color with a white head that lasts for an eternity. Very nice lacing. Lots of sediment. Smells of apples, dates, lots of malt, and brown sugar with a bit of grape. Very strong nose. Taste is also very intense initially. Apples and dates again, along with oranges, strong malt, lots of brown sugar, and a slight earthiness. A nice bitter character at the end really serves to balance it. No real alcohol presence save for a warming sensation. Though it hides the ABV very well, the 12% does limit the drinkability. Definitely a sipper."
"D-I may lay this down for a while as the alcohol burn was a little much to enjoy the flavors. Really didn't seem like a Belgian Dark."
"Pretty awesome beer, but I wish the apple flavor weren't as strong so the other qualities of this beer could come though."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, need to try this again during the winter, but a good one to knock the chill off a semi-cool July evening. I've yet to have a bad beer from this brewery"
"This brew, whose name means ""Silent Night"" is a Christmas beer which is rated at 12% ABV and the De Dolle website claims that it is ""the highest density"" of any Belgian Beer. Brewed with a seemingly unreasonable amount of malt and Belgian candy sugar, this brew is extremely strong, while remaining pretty drinkable, all things considered. There is such an enormous complexity to this beer that you should really try to take an hour or so to drink it, as it warms up, it changes so many times that you (almost) don't realize how hot it's getting you. There is fruit, booze, and all kinds of other sweet and tart flavors, with only the slightest hint of bitterness. Sure, my American mouth wants MORE HOPS but really, does it belong in a beer like this? This is one of those bottles that distracts me so much from everything around me that I have to restrain myself from buying it too often. Life is Beautiful, indeed."
"Pours rich honey amber with no head. Smell is tart, sweetness and almost a salty twinge. Taste is sweet and very lightly tart, but nice and malty. Slightly full bodied and lightly but not overly syrupy in texture which surprised me for a 21 year old brew! Pretty tasty. Thanks again Mike!"
"D- this is a definite sipper and is not one for the power hours or the keg stands. A nice beer to sit and relax with. Strong on the way down and leaves behind a zing in my throat for a good 2 minutes."
"For an authentic Belgian beer, this is not to be missed. Perhaps I am in need of more experience and my opinion will change in time."
"D: only good for one or two at 12%. great winter beer, with a great us of sours."
"Hugely sweet. Spicing flavors are subdued, but leave an impression. Take care; this one requires sipping to fully enjoy. I can't seem to take stock of all the fruits I find herein. Impressive: a dark ale that's not that dark, but has all the complexity."
"Love it."
"Taste: Sweet with a caramel maltiness, finished spicy and dry with a bit of alcohol. Light and highly carbonated. I think this would be awesome with a few years on it."
"Orange to light brown with a nice puffy white head. Big ol' legs. Smells sweet, malty, grapefruit zest, coriander, cumin, apricots. Taste is dry and malty, with plums and dates. Tangy and biscuity, mild chocolate. Hint of nutmeg and alcohol on the finish. soft and chewy. A punchy, fun beer to drink. A nice holiday spin on the style. Cool!"
"The beer pours hazy brownish amber color with a some wispy foam floating on top. The aroma is dark fruit, caramel, with a hint of alcohol and earthy background. Full bodied and slick on the palate. An syrupy apricot fruitiness flavor commingled with caramel. Sweet but not to the point of being cloying. Slightly dry with some alcohol detectable. Overall well rounded and pretty good."
"Merely ""good"" drinkability, because it's potent, the alcohol making its presence known both in buzz and flavor. But cloying alcohol? No. Stille Nacht delivers wonderful flavor, a definitive Belgian holiday ale, and a fine representative of the country's legendary beer legacy in any season."
"D-Won't have another unless it is a reserve, though even then I will be reserved."
"I thought this beer was a bit odd. It starts off pretty normal and almost boring, but builds and becomes a complex sipper."
"D - Drinkability is good. The excess carbonation really starts to hinder the beer in this department. With some patience, that problem resolves itself and it ends up being very good. I would have another one of these and would recommend giving it a try."
"Alcohol is under the radar, and the beer drinks fast."
"R- One of my favorite beers of all time, i have a few bottles laying around and after a few sips off of this one i just had to share it with everyone! Safe to say I'm very excited to be visiting De Dolle with a few guys from the BBB in about 2 weeks! woooo!"
"D- For such a high ABV, this one is more drinkable than most. The interesting flavors and champagnelike characteristic makes this one a classic beer in my book. Well done. I will pick up a few bottles to cellar."
" Peppery, champagne-like carbonation tickles the back of the throat. Big warming alcohol hides behind fruitcake flavors, banana, allspice, and earthy undertones. The back palate is surprisingly dry, with flavors of grain and mature yeast. A strange, faint note of vegetable water, like when you boil broccoli. Barely perceptible, but definitely there. One of my favorite Belgian Christmas ales."
"I can't get this one in Tennessee but picked it up in Indiana and wish I'd gotten more than just the one bottle.."
"This beer actual pairs well with some left over Danish Blue. It tones down the sweetness."
"Poured into my chalice and received an extremely frothy two-finger head that never went away. To give you the proper picture, imagine wiping off a half-inch layer of snow from your windshield. Yeah, that much. The head never died, and it left minor lacings on top of a apple-cider colored body that was not seethru. The smell contained spices and some hoppy aromas, like citrus, but the main thing I smelled was some pepper and something like an oakey smell. The taste starts out real spicy with the hint of some tart fruit flavors. It also contains sweetness like there is cinnamon and a pinch of colve, and there is a smoothness that leads me to believe that there might might something like honey or caramel, with a hint of apple in there. The high ABV is slightly noticeable, but for the most part a full body that passes down easily, almost svelt. I thought this might be a little better, but perhaps I had too high expectations. An excellent winter warmer and one of the best ones I've ever had."
"Poured from a 11.6oz brown bottle with a white cap marked ""BOTTL 2006* 12%"" into a tulip glass. Huge, thick off white fizzy head of foam easily three fingers high, extremely active carbonation, exhibits some staying power. Easily one of the longest lasting, largest frothy heads of foam I have ever seen on any beer. Appearance is a rusty yellowish orange color, cloudy and semi-translucent. Small floating bits of yeast also present. Aroma is bready and yeasty, notes of sweet dark fruits, dates, banana, clove and other more subtle spices, sweet malt and earthy undertones. Taste is sweet and malty, caramel-toffee malt, dark fruits and banana, slightly drying grainy aftertaste. Alcohol warmth is noticeable in the aftertaste, but far from overpowering. For 12%, it is hidden well. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with higher levels of carbonation, rougher and hits with a slightly metallic twinge on the tongue, washes with a slight oil-slick feeling. Drinkability is good, hides its abv well and is exceptionally well balanced. Overall a great example of the style, strongly suggest trying, would seek out again."
"Another stellar belgian. This beer is massive at 12% and yet it remains very drinkable with many subtleties. Fantastic!"
"Appearance is friggin' awesome with a huge fine bubbled off white head that pours like custard you can literally form sculptures with the head as you pour it into one of your nicest chalices. As it slowly dwindles and more body forms a hazy amber burgundy hue is noticeable, and as the yeast sediment goes into the glass it resembles a glass of unfiltered apple cider. Lacing is so fine and even textbook for the term Belgian style lacing, light layered and intricate all day. Aroma upfront tartness fresh cut green apple with mild funky leather and spice bursts, after a second pass citrus and tropical passion fruit comes to mind. Just bury your schnauze in a glass of this fine brew especially at $3.99 a bottle. Tart acidic cider notes shine with mellow creamy spice filled bliss just around the corner. Flavor is built around yeast characteristics, the tartness balances the sweetness and thick coating of spice added. Full alcohol burn with tart acidic fruits green raisin and apples with black licorice anise in the mix and other wild yeast funk blended with cultivated yeast strains that bring the complexity. Hard to describe yet you know it's world class beer after a sip or two. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a lacquer of spice oil texture, carbonation is fine yet definitely does tickle the back of the throat. This beer has the ability to absolutely coat the palate. Definitely warming with the alcohol putting the singe on the fine receptors of the beer drinker's palate. Drinkability is incredible as far as intriguing qualities would I like another, however in the department of can I actually drink that many it's of course week at 12%abv. Plus I think the amount of flavor available in this small bottle is unreal, what a value I'll be getting more."
"Pours a dark golden in color with very little head at all. Smell is lots of candy sugar, some banana and a little clove. Taste is all the same with surprisingly a good amount of heat from the alcohol coming through. Medium on the mouthfeel with absolutely no carbonation to speak of. This is a very good beer, and a treat to have on Christmas."
"I thought this beer was great for most aspects. A murky brown with a little bit of amber color. Smells and tastes very sweet. My only complaint with this beer was the carbonation. It was way too bubbly and was very tough to drink. Aside from that, it was a great beer. I just don't think I would seek it out."
"A 33cl bottle with bottled on 12/2006 stamped on the cap. Served in a tulip glass it was an orange color with a huge, thick, whipped cream head that slowly settled, leaving some great lacing. It had a sweet orange aroma, with a bit of spice. The taste was similar to the aroma, with that Belgian yeastiness apparent. This was a big, fulfilling beer. The alcohol was very well hidden, but I think one of these at a time would do quite nicely."
"D--This is a monster. You could get your world rocked by this one. High quality BSA, a must try if you love the style like I do."
"D - Overall it was a very good beer and I think the brewer got what they were shooting for..I don't think I'll be looking this one up soon..but certainly a good beer"
"Wow, so well balanced and drinkable for a beer this big. A near perfect example of the style."
"This is a very nice Belgian Strong Ale. Take your time with this one and don't rush."
"From an 11.2 oz bottle copped singly from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa for $4.99, this beer pours a HUGE, frothy, foamy, and immense head with incredible staying power... smell is replete with caramel, malts, sweet sugar, and yeast... taste is equally malty and rich, very thick and full with deep caramel notes... I've heard that this is Belgian beer has the highest gravity... and its thickness and richness is certainly detectable in its overhwelming flavor that sticks to the pallate and doesn't let go... 12% ABV is certainly noticeable, with a strong flavor permeading throughout... Very, very, sweet and ultra-thick and rich to the point of almost being overbearing... this beer won't stop attacking your taste buds... such a strong and flavorful taste that you got to sit back, relax and truly sip this one over a long period of time... an eccentric brew to say the least... a sipper that you got to take your time and enjoy... good stuff..."
"I would jump at the chance to have this again."
"This is just dangeoursly drinkable. So very intense and filled with different tastes it's almost overwhelming. Perfect for sipping on during a couple of hours. De Dolle Brouwers, you have my uttermost respect! Recommended!"
"Pours a hazy orange with a thin white head. slight sour fruit smell on the nose with some belgian yeast and baked goods. Taste is slightly sour up front but that fades fast into dark fruit and belgian sugar and yeast with slight sour cherry. Smooth silky mouthfeel is a touch thin for my taste. Sugary residue remains on lips. Fairly drinkable and a good selection, would be great with a little age."
"I'd say two nights before Christmas is a fine time to drink this, and it's a nice touch this time of year. The flavor has a sweet bias, but it's a manageable slant. The ABV is bulky, but it's worked into the big picture nicely and well. Silent night on a silent night, not a bad bit of harmony."
"A great beer that I am suprised I've never reviewed.... I've had it probably a dozen time over the years and like it so much, a few friends received a bottle as a Christmas gift this year."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber brown with some head. Nose is like rotten apple skins, but not in a rancid way. Flavor is extremely sweet with almost a brown sugar flavor to it. Strong and pungent. Definitely a winter beer. I just want to light a log and throw it on the fire and sip this thing for the next hour....or two. Mouthfeel is a little thinner off less carbonation than I like, and also syrupy due to its style, but the drinkability is very high even though it is a ""sipper"". I could go for these all night...especially on Christmas Eve as I stare at presents under the tree with someone very attractive next to my side. Hey, baby. Whats shakin."
"Drinkability: More like a BSPA than a BSDA but mis-classified beers seem to be the lot around here, lately; in any event, a complex sipper but I woouldn't want another bottle in succession"
"bottle poured cloudy appricot with a few yeast chunks floating in it. Nice thin white head Aromas of appricot, belguim yeast and some alcohol nice medium to thick mouth feel, flavors of sweet fruit honey spices with a light touch of hops, the alcohol is well hidden in this one of 12% this is a wonderful winter sipper."
"Poured into a chalice a murky golden amber color, some carbonation, little little fizzy tannish head, which leaves some oil slicks, and some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, sweet, with some figs, prunes, raisins, and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is awesome really love this one, malty, very nice sweetness to it, dark fruits, and caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well. Full body. Very drinkable, love this brew, highly recommended."
"Had the opportunity to try this beer during a recent trip to Belgium. One of the locals that I got to talking with in the 't Brugs Beertje bar in Bruges insisted that I needed to try it. The bartender informed us that they had multiple years of it as well, so we ended up doing a vertical tasting of the '05, '06 and '07. Its definitely a beer that ages well, with the flavours and aroma mellowing nicely. Aroma and flavour are both sweet and fruity, with a bit of spiciness in the finish. A delightful warming affect as expected, but at a respectable 12% ABV, this is beer to enjoy slowly, perhaps as an evening-ender."
"Overall- Nah, not a fan! Too much like wine."
"Pours a hazy amber color while emanating a decent sized head. Wonderful bouquet of fruit, sugar and spicy alcohol aroma. Quite a complex flavor profile. I get ripened nectarine, peach, peppery alcohol notes and many other flavors which my uneducated palate struggles to identify. Medium-full mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish - ends with a definite warming sensation from the alcohol. Very satisfying presence on the palate as a prickly bath of carbonation floats the taste over the taste buds. Considering the 12% abv this one is a knockout. Makes a great dessert beer."
"Drinkability: I had no problem finishing an 11 oz bottle, but it's too strong to make me want to go back for seconds."
"I must admit, I am a bit disappointed with this one. I have heard much about it and have been looking for it off and on for some time now. I finally located it and now that I've had it, it seems that it simply doesn't hold up to the hype surrounding it. It is a good beer at best, not great or fantastic, simply good. The appearance isn't very dark at all, and in fact looks more like a glass of murky, muddy, river water than anything else. Smell is rather pleasing with loads of yeasty notes and a bit of spice. Taste, too is okay with many profiles common with Belgians. Something I must admit with this one, is the 12% is very, very well concealed, and while an abundance of CO2 lead me to score this simply average on mouthfeel, the well hidden 12%abv makes this dangerously drinkable, all things considered. Overall, not a bad beer, just not what I was expecting, I suppose. I may buy it again in the future, but I certainly won't be rushing out to get more."
"There seem to be kind of mixed reviews of this beer, but personally I think this stuff is incredible. Don't hesitate to try it."
"D: For a 12% beer, this is amazingly drinkable. It's a good thing I only bought one. But, when I clear the store of every last one of these beers, it'll be harder to hold on to them. Without question, one of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"Pretty tasty, but too rich and strong to be very drinkable beyond sipping one, at least right now. I've got a bunch of this in the cellar, can't wait to see how it developes!"
"Entirely drinkable for a beer of this strength, but it is one that demands sipping. I defy any one to drink this in under 20 minutes. In fact I took almost a half hour, and I'm sure the spelling and punctuation mistakes are evident in this review...."
"Almost no head. Clear, but with some yeaties floating around despite a careful pour. Good aroma of grass, heavy yeast, raisin, pepper, and alcohol. Kind of syrupy with a light carbonation. Long finish. Maybe a little bit too sweet for me, however. Ok, but I don't think I'll pick up any more."
"Low drinkability, too sweet and not very balanced."
"If if were on the beer menu and nothing else caught my eye, I'd drink it again. Otherwise, not a Belgian I would ernestly seek out."
"Well, I really can never imagine drinking a whole bottle of one of these. I'm glad I tried it though, cause it's a most interesting beer."
"This beer pushes an almost stomach-churning envelope, but manages to be enjoyable in a slightly masochistic way. Drinking this might be compared to getting pushed down some stairs by a stocky old lady."
"Drinkability: another hgh alcohol beer that can be dangerous. Drinking more than 2-3 in a night session would oversaturate the tastebuds. Great beer in a single bottle session."
"Very enjoyable! Can't say I've had much like it. Recommended!"
"Overall,. this was reasonable enjoyable to sip on, but I wish I had gotten a well carbonated bottle. The intensity of the flavors kept the drinkibility to a minimun. As I look at other reviews that state a ""big pillowy head," I feel like I have been cheated out of the true essence of this very unique brew."
"Highly recommended!"
"It's a great and complex beer yet, and probably will be better with age, but... please, brink back the old Stille Nacht, one of the beers I would have rated a complete 5."
"This beer smelled wonderful and it may have been the most wonderful part. The appearance of the beer looked like hard cider and it also had a cider taste mixed with a Belgian strong dark. There was hint of orange peel and spice. The carbonation seemed strong but the flavor and mouthfeel were complex. Overall, the beer was enjoyable and I would drink it again, but this definitely a unique beer."
"This beer pours with a huge head. It is about the color of murky water. The smell is alcohol and bannannas. The taste is fruity and sweet. Mouthfeel isstrong. This beer is a sipper. Many fruity flavers are hidden and the alcohol is clawing to escape. This beer attacks your tastebuds."
"Very good beer, couldn't drink it all night (without falling over), but a fine example of what Belgium can produce."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is an opaque golden-orange hue topped by a good inch of creamy off-white head that retains very well and leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Aroma is herby, with some holiday spice, lightly sweet malt, and more than a little alcohol. The herby character is dominant on the palate, especially up front. Sweet malt emerges to balance it out, with spicy notes of tropical fruit and a touch of treacle coming through right before the swallow. Body is rich, silky, and creamy, very enjoyable. Highly drinkable for a strong dark ale. Wish I had purchased more than one bottle this holiday season."
"Praise be St. Arnold! This is beer at its finest. That little snowman on the label has been rightly crowned as this is truly a regal concoction. The complexity of this ale is the closest Ive come to witnessing divine inspiration (fine, madness)."
"Fantastic."
"This is perhaps my favorite belgian ale to this day. Frickin' delicious."
"Nice sipping brew, but nowhere near as good as that 2002 on tap. If you're anywhere near Delaney's in New Haven then you have to try it. This one is decent."
"Drinkability? I'm lucky it comes in a small bottle, but even this is a challenge to finish."
"Drinkability/Overall: interesting for sure. Just soooo sweet that it's hard to get over. Not necessarily cloying, but too sweet to drink more than one. Glad to be splitting the bottle with Steve. Hmmmm."
"Mouthfeel was fast and delicious. Came off as quite drinkable with a ninja-like, hidden ABV."
"Pours a very hazy amber with a good head and lacing. Aroma is sour and smells slightly of grape must and pommace with banana and sweeter smells emerging on the finish. Taste is of juicy fruit, cherries, cinammon, tangy malt, and some late astringency. Nice balanced mouthfeel and interesting enough for very good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is hot, smooth, and full bodied. I'm impressed that they were able to get a beer to taste like this! More, please!"
"This was poured into a wide mouthed goblet. The color is a hazy golden/orange. The head is big, but it dissipates quickly to leave nice lacing around the glass. The aroma is of honey, figs, a little citrus, and candi sugar. The taste is malty, sugary, honey sweet. The honey dominates the flavor. The mouth is coated by the slicky sweet nectar. A nice winter seasonal that is a good find for anyone."
"Poured a cloudy golden color with hints of orange; the yeast seems to float around. Very little head, I initially thought it was flat. Has a cider/champagne smell, very candy like, dark fruit. The sweetness hits right away, it's a bit overpowering. Slight caramel malt taste, you can taste the alcohol going down. It has a creamy mouthfeel to it, light carbonation. A very sweet beer, something to sip. I would only drink one, can't imagine drinking 2 of these in a row. Overall a good ale but I need to go brush my teeth now."
"A very sweet beer, for dessert only. I can't get into this style personally, though."
"Overall, a fine Belgian. Normally I don't care for sugary sweetness and alcohol, but it is well blended and balanced here."
"Big and chewy, my understanding is that this is at least a partially wild beer. I detect some wildness in the aroma, but I suspect that this is a bit underattenuated by the nearly cloying sweetness. Definitely drinkable, but could be a bit drier. I suspect this beer becomes something mighty special after 5-10 years of aging."
"Great beer, complex, intersting new flavors everytime you sip. Holloah!"
"Drinkability - I was given one as a present and I can't say I'm eager to get more. This beer was sweet and loaded with an alcohol presence that seemed to make it not much more than a sweet sipping beer from Belgium. I'm a big lover of Belgian's and this is a nice beer, but I've had better/more balanced beers."
"Belgian Strong Dark Ales are fast becoming my favorite style because of their complexity. Every new brewer and bottle is a surprise!"
"This beer is a must try. Will be over the top for some but it might be your next favorite."
"2005 bottle. This beer pours a hazy orange/yellow with a thin white head. There seems to be plenty of carbonation in this one. There also seems to be quite a bit of sediment floating in there too! The sediment never settles, it just hangs around, floating in the beer. The aroma is initially sweet, but a tinge of alcohol comes through. Sweet breads, a touch of caramel. The flavor is full of malt sweetness, some bready yeast flavors, nice spices, and a little caramel. The mouthfeel is medium, clings to your palate well, but does not overpower. Excellent beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation. This one goes down like milk. Mouthfeel is similar to that of Guinness Draught. Pretty easy drinking. I would say this is middle of the road for strength (8%) but it never really shows. A solidly drinkable beer."
"An attractive honey orange beer capped by an off white foamy head. This is an aromatic beer, it fills the air as its poured. This smells like Belgium, yeasty, spicy, with orange, bread, with some sweet fruity malt. The beer takes you totally by surprise when you drink it though. This is pretty big, lots and lots of malt and alcohol, but smooth. Warm, but not on fire. You start off with the yeast and the malt, then it get sweeter, and finishes with spice and clove, although not really clean, and just short of cloying. If it had just a little more compexity to it, with a cleaner finish, this would be an amazing beer, but it falls short on a few notes. On the whole, an interesting beer with a bit of an indentity problem."
"Finish is tart and mouth puckering. Quite appetizing for the next sip and hence very drinkable to me."
"Drinkability is kind of not right. It's an amazingly complex beer with lots of flavors but a full glass is a lot to take. It's a sipper, not a drinker."
"D: Bit too sweet for me. This was over the top sweet. Probably could use a couple of years to round out."
"Drinkability is ok not bad to start the longer you sip the more the alcohol seems to grow in intensity. Thanks to babydoc and BCG BIF for this bottle."
"Drinkability: It is not drinkable, the sweetness and abv overwhelm."
"Peachy colour with foamy white head, boozy and yeasty aroma. Taste of fruity yeast and spices and eggy kiche.Sweet nutmeg and pepper and cinammon. Noticeable carbonation, fine, refreshing above average Belgian. Medium mouthfeel.Easy to drink if you like Belgians."
"Overall - An excellent beer... Highly recommended... I have another of these which i'll cellar for a couple of years to see what difference it makes..."
"D - A very interesting beer from a brilliant brewery. It took a few sips to get into because of the initial sweetness, but was well worth it."
"Unfortunately, this beer is better than its rating reflects. I will gladly start my night off in any season with this brew, despite the silly snowman on the label."
"D: awesome. i wish this was year round and i could get it more easily. as it is ill be very sad when the last bottle sells of my shelf which will be very very soon. great great beer from a great great brewery. rock."
"This beer poured a deep cloudy amber color with absolutely no head to speak of. The aroma I first get is very earthy and a bit sweet, maybe plumy. The taste is very interesting. I get an initial shot of tartness and after it lingers....some sweetness...almost port like. Again I get some plum notes like in the aroma. Very nice. I compare the taste somewhat to the taste I recently got in an 88 bottle of JW Lees Harvest ale. Overall an intersting beer that was worth the try."
"Drinkability was decent, but holy hell was this a strong beer. I'd say this was a definite sipping beer, but even this doesn't warrant several in an evening. You enjoy one or two of these tops. Overall, a very complex and interesting beer."
"Overall, this is one sweet, sweet beer. There's some complexity there, but in the end it's just too much sweetness and syrupiness in one place."
"from the bottle, poured a cloudy honey with alot of floaties and with a small white head that left a thin layer of lacing. aroma strong hops followed by lemon and and malts with a nice sugar sweetness and a sweet navel orange. flavor the sweetness was like cotton candy, than the hops and malts came out nicely followed by just a touch of alcohol along with some spices. nice smooth mouthfeel enjoyed drinking this. good beer."
"This beer is a little too alcoholic for me, after this bottle I had a little buzz in my head. But for it's strength it is very balanced, excellent!"
"A strong sipping beer. Flavor profile is unusual and very deftly handled."
"definitely a sipping beer, but very enjoyable, after last years fiasco, I was a bit scared to pick this bottle up."
"this is my celebration beer for the seattle seahawks winning the nfc championship game. pours a hazy caramel colored brown with an off-white eighth inch head in a chalice. head drops to a ring around the glass quickly. aroma is fruity, wine-like and a touch yeasty. some medicinal aromas as well. first taste is bursting with flavors. corriander, and a little pepper, grapes, apricots, some apples and significant alcohol warming. very vinous, spicy and yeasty bitterness in the dry finish. mouthfeel is a medium body with a creamy roll over your tongue. swallows smoothly. this is a slow sipper. every swallow reminds you of just how much alcohol is in this brew. don't get me wrong, the burn is nice, but don't expect this to disappear in a matter of minutes. overall, this is a tasty belgian with nice fruity and spicy characteristics to help bring in the holidays."
"All in all, one of the most dynamic beers I've ever tasted. I've never had something taste, look, and smell almost completely diferrent. Aside from looking pretty bad, this beer is great I think, as are most of De Dolle's offerings. Think white beer, on steroids. I think that's pretty close."
"The mouth is a little too slick for my likeing. The wonderful nose and complex flavors make me like this beer. Yes, I'll have another."
"11.6 oz bottle, vintage 2004, poured into a snifter. Pours a muddy coppery orange, a finger of off white head, moderate amount of lacing. Nose is sweet and alcoholic, some slight phenols, sweet unripe dark fruit, some yeast, and a slight spiciness. Taste is more of the same, a very sweet alcohol infused malt, molasses, dark fruits like raisins, plums, figs, overripe citrus--very sweet, a little cloying after a while. There's also a decent amount of spicy yeast in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and syrupy. Overall, this is a decent belgian dark ale that is overly sweet and not one that I could drink a lot of."
"Drinkability: A rich and complex brew, one that should ultimately be savored and consumed slowly. Also a great example of the style. I'll surely be having this again. And if you don't think you can handle a whole bottle, I could see this being a great 6 ounces a piece for a couple of folks."
"Let me preface this by saying that I am reviewing a 3 yr aged bottle in particular. In general, I've always regarded Stille Nacht as a good example of a Belgian beer but never one of my favorites. This weekend my friend broke out a bottle that he had aged in his cellar for 3 yrs. It did get much better with age. It was noticeably sweeter then usual. I'm not usualy a fan of beer that is too sweet but with the probable increase in alcohol this had a nice mellow blend. I recomend it for aging , if that's your thing"
"Notes: This beer is like a barrage of different flavors, one coming right after another, and very quickly. It is quite a potent beer in terms of the Belgian taste and the alcohol. Its not quite as restrained and balanced as other Belgian strong dark ales. Though the alcohol taste is strong, its never hot or solventy. The carbonation is very strong, which makes it a slow sipper. Overall, this is one of those beers that gets you thinking on how they made something like this, and yearn for more."
"Thanks Kevin!"
"This is a really unique brewery I've been discovering, though I've only had a few of their beers. Pours a light but rusty looking straw color, nice clarity, with a big ol fluffy head. Don't know if I'd call this a strong dark all, because it's not exactly that dark. More like a triple or a strong pale or something. Smell is of sweet malts and maybe even some candied sugar, along with a nice peppery spicy hop profile. The taste is even sweeter, almost too sweet. Tastes like liquid frosting almost, yet with enough herbal, spicy hops and other spices to balance it out a little. Really smooth, soft mouthfeel. The only thing that keeps this beer from being just that much better and more drinkable is that it's so sweet. It's a nice quiality at first, but it's almost cloying at times. Easy enough to get past though because this beer has so much else going on. Definately worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel is rich and full and yummy. Alcohol is no where to be seen. I love this beer. Drinkability is as good as can be for this type of beer."
"sweetness wears out its welcome near the bottom of the glass. can't imagine having more than one, but it's a very well put together belgian brew."
"The mecinal qualities are there in the taste as well (in fact sometimes it tastes like pepto bismol) but are completely obliterated by the most horribly cloying sweetness you can possibly imagine. Besides the nice apricot flavors, this tastes like Bubble Yum coated with pure sugar. There are some caramel notes in the finish but absolutely nothing there to balance the sweetness which lingers on an on. The only time this beer was enjoyable was on the first sip before the lingering sweetness. I'll give it a 2.0 - bonus points for complexity, but even that seems generous. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and well carbonated, but a little sticky seeming. I was only able to finish a quarter of this in almost an hour."
"Wow, what a beer. I was lucky enough to have a bottle of 1982 when I was at the Kulminator in Belgium, but this is a more recent example and is simply amazing as well. Very deceiving in that it looks and almost tastes like it might have gone bad, but the complexity of the fruit flavors and malts are breathtaking. A sipping beer that ranks right up there with the finest port wine."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Wonderfully viscous, the texture accentuates the bold fruity elements of the beer perfectly. This might be saved for an after-dinner dessert beer, as this could pair beautifully with vanilla ice cream or even custard. Very nice."
"Overall a nice winter warmer but one a night would be it for me...a nice once a year treat.."
"This is another great Belgian beer, brewed as only the Belgians can do it."
"Always interesting to read the old reviews. I clearly needed time to adjust to bigger beers. This has become one of my favorite Belgians, and I usually grab it when I see it (which isn't that often). One of the creamiest beers I've ever had, great body. Full, lasting foamy head (maybe the sample I first reviewed was a bad one?). It is sweet, but not overly so. Interesting spices, nice warming effect. ABV well disguised. One of the best of the style."
"Poured a hazy golden with a deep orange hue with a thinner than expected head that left no lace behind,nice aromas of tart green apple and spicey,clovey yeast and Belgian candied suger.Big and in your face flavors very fruity orange zest and that green apple elemant with a spicey somewhat alcoholic finish.Glad it is only 11.6 ozes here quite heavy but packed with rich flavors,a sipper for sure."
"cheers..."
"A complex offering worthy of much praise. One I will be going back to again and again."
"Pours golden hazy, floaties all around, absolute minimal head. Smells of oranges apples, cotton candy, bubble gum and very very sweet. Tastes very very sweet. Cloying fruits and honey some yeasty bite with sharp alcohols all over the finish, and thank god for it cause it's the only way i can handle this sweetness at all. Very full mouthfeel with very little carbonation, terrible drinkability due to its syrupy sweet nature. Dry this out some, lighten the body and a touch more carbonation and this would be a fantastic triple. As is...just way too sweet. The only reason i keep sipping is because the finish with the alcohol kick and warming is fairly nice. This will not be a repeat purchase."
"Body is a beefy medium with a slick, sugary, and coating mouthfeel with a slippery texture. Drinkability suffers a bit due the booze and the sweetness. Goes great with the jerk pinapple tilapia I had for dinner."
"What a cool name. The nose is full of sugar and spice and everything nice. It pours a murky orange with a foamy white cap. Leaves some nice lacing. Very sweet with loads of sugar. Fruit cake. Very full bodied for a Belgian. Alcohol abounds. Whatch out for this one."
"Serve this in a tulip or chalice. Also serve this with naked waitresses as a bonus...."
"Hazy amber/peach topped by a dense, bright white head that shows some lacing and good retention. Pear (with a bit of apple) and malt combine nicely with a bit of alcohol, producing a mellow aroma. Malt and fruit kick things off, followed by a large dose of sweetness. Alcohol flavour is a little pronounced with plenty of warmth at the finish. Quite viscous, smooth and creamy at times, and a bit sticky from the residual sugar. Lightish body and generous carbonation. This is one that would likely gain a lot from prolonged time in the cellar, but still an experience as is."
"Drank this on a hot August evening but this was Xmas in the Summer. Showed dark orange/ red/ brown with a misty haze. The nose was all old and orange peels drowned in vats of fino sherry. I tasted a lot of huge complexity mixed with care and attention to the little beer details. No rough edges and no taste holes to drive the truck of disapointment through. A beer that really took my breath away and replaced with brewers cobwebs and grain mice."
"Hard pour yields a minimal head with small bubbles. Color is a hazy pale golden brown. Head is now gone as I type this. Typical Belgian aroma. Light fruit. Taste is very intense not what I expected from the light aroma and color. Bold overripe fruit apricots. Sweet. A bit of yeast in the aftertaste. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Carbonation is detected in the mouth feel, but almost zero head interesting. Taste permeates every square inch of my mouth. Strangely, I perceive a great deal of flavor in the upper back of my mouth... Intense. Not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for a bold, flavorful Belgian with a full body then this is it. Seems like a great choice if you are going to have one beer. One of these will leave you satisfied. I will definitely revisit this beer when I find it again. Even though I really enjoyed this, I could be happy splitting the 11.6oz bottle. It is almost too much. Maybe there is a purpose for the anchor old foghorn 7 oz. bottles!"
"Another very nice entry from the best Belgian brewery no one's ever heard of. I'm glad I bought three bottless...the other two will be a lot better a year from now."
"One of best beers brewed on earth and also one of the toughest to acquire. This belgian beauty has dark, creamy coloring rich with chocolate tones. The taste is dense with sweet, bitter truffles and spicy apple. A tad tart to the palate but the sweetness quickly overtakes your senses. If you can find it, grab it, this one is true brewing perfection."
"Drinkability - Very warming but, I think one is perfect for an evening. Must find more!"
"Drinkability- An excellent nightcap brew. Maybe even with a dessert with tropical fruits in it. Or maybe pair it with a chocolate dish. Either way it goes down smooth and really warms you up inside."
"A dollop of sandy head, the bubbles varying dramatically in size, sits atop burnt sienna liquid with tea-colored highlights and dries into thick arches of lace. Miniscule, silvery lines of carbonation run past dense blobs of suspended sediment. One swirl of the goblet and the whole room starts reeking of cinnamon graham crackers. Smells like... wow, malt malt malt. Caramel covered raisins or baked apples sprinkled with cocoa powder; molasses and sawdust with a cidery wassail finish. Taste is all huge enormous molasses and cinnamon... first savory and gingery, shifting to caramel apple before finishing like pear syrup and clove. Astonishing mouthfeel is literally cookieish, like gingerbread batter, with a floury dryness from the alcohol. Some drinkers might have a problem with the sweetness of this brew. But I'm having mine on a cold spring night just before bedtime, and under the circumstances, it's all candy wassail scrumptiousness and scrumptiousity. Yum."
"Definitely likes up to its name-- a STRONG ale. Pours an orange hazy brown with a little head. Smell is like a cider mixed with other dark fruits. The taste is really strong at first, but as the sips go on it gets more manageable. The initial is of strong cider like the smell. The middle is not as good at hiding the alcohol and tastes like that. The taste is a bitter mixture of alcohol and dark fruits. Overall it is a very flavorful beer that is not able to hide the high alcohol."
"Overall, not something I'm going to rush back to again soon. Appearance was fine but the overwhelming sugary character and alcohol punch didn't do anything for me."
"I've been saving this for a while to try. It pours a dirty light orange color with a small head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is not what I was expecting. Its almost doughy, dank, musty. Not what I was hoping for. The flavor is much better than the nose would say. Some nice raisiney sweetness and slight bready notes. There is a slight spiceyness on the finish. Maybe a touch I'm happy I didn't let the nose get me down too far. The feel is full and thick, slightly syrupy. Overall, when you get away from the nose, this one really is a nice brew. The sweetness is slightly cloying, but I enjoy it."
"This forest of flavors sits upon a foamy, frothy, yet syrupy mouthfeel. Somewhat reminiscent of an intense California orange muscat or a Beerenauslese."
"The nose collects a sweet malt and mashed fruit sour with light peach/apricot floral. The mouth is full and occupies one with slight syrup. The palate is touched by the low tones that rise up first (the sweet malts). But then a TWANG hits just past the tip of the tongue and reaches the high palate and remains clear into the next taste minutes away. It is this twang that I found took energy to drink and to thoroughly enjoy the Stille Nacht."
"D- This is a lovely complex beer that has all the flavors blending together in a wonderful beer. It may be one of the few redeeming qualities of Christmas. From appearance to aroma to taste to mouthfeel this beer is treat to drink."
"Very sedimented medium brown, dull and sort of muddy looking. Thickish head settles as brown grey skim of 1/8 of an inch. Not the most attractive of beers. Laces in wide loops. Candied fruit aroma, sweet, like the bread and candies of hot cross buns at Easter. Full mouthfeel and very low carbonation, would come off as lush if it wasn't for prickly cinnamon and alcohol tones. Lots of fruit flavors come through, tempered by yeasty flavors and an awful lot of residual sugars -- what hits me especially is mincemeat with a coal-like bittering as the brew rounds out. While not my favorite as a pie flavor, it works at least intellectually in the brewer's art, the flavor profile is to be respected here, in my opinion. Comes off as very alcoholic to my tastes. Smooths pleasantly as it warms up. But still, for me, gloppy and overly sweet..."
"this beer is very drinkable but i can see in moderation."
"Smells sweet, with hints of mint, pine, raisins, hops. Taste is freaking weird. Starts of insanely sweet, then rises up to meet the hops which fade to leave you with a sweet medicinal flavor. Very fruity, with many over the top flavors, with strong carmel and butter flavors. Slight medicinal quality throughout. Mouthfeel is full and sticky. Holy crap this beer will be the end of me. It is just too much with its high ABV, boisterous flavors, and eccentric belgian artwork."
"This is a really special treat well worth a try."
"My least favorite Belgian thus far."
"Man, it's been half an hour since I finished the 11.6 oz. and my review, and I'm still drunk. Don't expect to drink one of these and drive."
"Stille Nacht (Silent Night) is a fine winter warmer of a BSDA with a full flavored, sweet fruitiness that is reminiscent of a Christmas fruitcake aged in brandy. I've been impressed by De Dolle even though I've only had a few of their offerings. The near cloying nature of this beer demands that it be drunk slowly, but it's a journey well worth taking."
"Poured with little carbonation but there was a nice slick ot white head on top of the beer. The smell was quite sweet; full of molassas, brown sugar, carmalized candi sugar, and very sweet belgian notes. The taste was a little too sweet getting close to cloying. There was too much sweet cherry flavored cough syrup and not enough balance. Even a little bit of alcohol would help. This was vertainly not my favorite beer ever."
"This brew pours a deep copper with golden hues and a light fluffy white head that leaves only a slight lace. Aromas make up a mix of yeasty esters along with white grapes and an appley tone. Initial flavors are super sweet up front due to what seems to be a heavy dosage of belgian candi sugars. Following there are hints ofapple and grape like tones but they are just simply overpowered by the sugary notes. The mouthfeel to this beer is slightly gritty and slightly effervesent due to the high carbonation. The finish is a sweet as the beginning which makes it quite hard to put down. Overall an interesting take on a strong belgian ale, but one that I can definetly do without."
"On the walk over to Hampden, the warmth buoys you. The sticky sugar is gone and your mouth isnt warmed, but your body is. Your face is red, your cheeks are rosy, and your body tingles with Belgian Xmas delight. What a refined old world treasure, which contrasts sharply to kitschy Christmas goodness. Good conversation, hub cap Xmas trees, creepy moving dolls, and my new favorite winter warmer."
"i can't say enough positive things about this beer.. i'll be scoring it as one of the higher ones i've reviewed (don't think of me as a '5' whore!) cheers to de dolle!!"
"A blend of fruit cocktail and fine, old Pedro Ximenez. Plus ashphalt-flavored scars on the finish."
"2001 vintage. Opened with a loud hiss and poured into the goblet a chunky golden amber with a volcano of light beige colored, rocky foam. Good, tattered lacing. Lots of particles in suspension. Yeasty, spicy aromas with a solid honey malt backbone. Light fruity esters. Way more fruity in the taste that the aroma. Very clover honey-like sweet, tropical fruitiness like starfruit, muskmelon and guava. Mild esters in the finish is the only let-up from its cloying sweetness. Overall, it's not bad, just a bit too sweet for my liking. I recommend trying older vintages over the fresh ones."
"It pours a murky amber with almost no head. It looks still. This makes the bridge between an english barley wine and a belgian christmas ale. Aroma is rather complex, very yeasty and sweet, but also full of fruity esters. The honeyish malt profile is extremely fruity (peaches, apples, vinous grapes, oranges, pears). Aroma is also quite spicy (mint, cloves) and alcoholic, a little less would have been appreciated actually as at times you feel almost like you're having a scotch. A faint bitterness fails from balancing the almost cloying ravaging sweetness. Palate is yeasty, extremely sweet and with more of those fruits dancing on the tongue, well supported by a medium body with low to medium carbonation. No doubt this is complex and full-flavoured, but the balance is just lacking when its so sweet and a bit too much alcoholic for its own good. I must say I feel a bit let down, not only cause I love De Dolle, but also because there are plenty of things going on in this beer, but they dont seem so well blended while it has a fairly good reputation."
"Unlike other reviews this poured with a thick creamy head with remarkable retention. It has a deep pumpkin pie color and despite my best efforts plenty of yeast came out of the bottle when poured. The aroma reminds me of soy sauce with a high level of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, but does not make up with the overly sweet taste as though the brewers were a little too happy with their belgium candy sugar. Overall having to take extra sips of this beer to review it was unpleasurable, the rest I suffered a great tragedy and went down my sink after friends rejected my offer of free beer."
"Pours a dark amber very little head due to next almost no carbonation. The aroma is both sweet and sour at the same time with an interesting spicey peppery background. The alcohol grabs your tongue first and then there is a quick rush of a licorice taste with a slight spicey peppery hop finish. Because of the lack of carbonation it goes down easy. But I would not try to sit around and drink several of these."
"Don't know what vintage this one is, but pours with zero carbonation into a goblet. None. Nada. Zip. So that affects appearance. It's a golden dark honey-orange with small floaties only noticeable when held up to the light. The smell is chewy malt and hints of honey. The taste is thick and sickeningly salty sweet. Not impressed. Not in the least. It kind of tastes like thick fruit with a ""soy sauce without the salt"" aftertaste. All I can really say is, yucky."
"2002 bottle-does this have a ""vintage""? Nice hazy amber color-slight head that tends to linger. Malty aroma-fruity,somewhat tart. cranberries? Big malt flavor-almost wine like. Very ""grapey"" if thats a word. Theres a tartness thats nicely balanced with the prevailing sweetness. A very interesting and well done mix. Great body-deceptively high in alcohol. A great beer-dont know how many I could have but a great dessert or end of the night beer."
"Not any christmas type spices in it but a great very sweet malty brew. I had it on tap. It poured a cloudy brown color. Lots of yeast in the keg I guess. Very drinkable but you have to like sweet malt flavor over hops. A nice beer to enjoy year round not just at Christmas time."
"Note so sure this is very very drinkable, but not bad either. I've really been finding De Dolle beers fairly harsh recently."
"The main scent reminds me of some shampoo I used alll throughout highschool but for the life of me I can't remember the name of. Very girly and very fresh scented- very springy.... still can't place it. Oranges and spices, vineous... Insanely high carbination, champagnelike. Bit too much carb for me, too much foaming up in the mouth. Thankfully the chunks that are shooting around in there are not something you can feel, just see! I really am surprised that this tastes as good as it does, after it's appearance. This is almost like a barleywine. Very good flavors that balance so well. Merlot, dark fruits, cherries, cherry brandy, soy sauce, biteyness. You taste tons of alcohol in it, almost burns your tongue. Nice. The carbination makes it almost creamy, yet keeps it bitey. Enjoyed the flavors alot but with the amount of carbination and intensity of flavor it may have a bit too much going on to be more than a sipper -I could not see myself having more than one bottle per night of this."
"Pours a red/gold color that?s pretty clear until I dump some yeast chinks into it. Head is an off white with poor retention and sticky lace. Aroma is wine-like, astringent and cidery. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with some effervescence?intense. Flavor is sweet with some hop bite. Quite one-dimensional. Musta gotten a bad bottle?"
"Beer is good. Happy strong beering."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"There is no head. I can get a cream-colored film with vigorous pour. It leaves a couple of small spots of lacing. The beer itself is a hazy, dark, peachy-orange. The nose is pure, sweet, fruity ice cream. Quite strong smelling (almost hard sauce). The front comes in extremely sweet, with spice and overripe fruit. It smoothes a little into the middle, taking on a more creamy, fruity, syrupy character. Spicy fruit in the finish doesn't quite hide the big alcohol. It's too sugary and syrupy for me, but there are some nice fruit and spice flavors in there."
"1999 bottle drank in 2004 at Kulminator in Antwerp. Poured a hazy medium brown beer with a super huge head with perfect retention. Carbonation is perfect with bubbles still present 10 minutes after the beer was poured, which is a bit surprising considering the age of this beer. Aroma is a quite strong mix of plums, sugars and roasted malts. The taste of this beer is one of the most wonderful things I had the chance to drink in my lifetime and consisted of a mix of roasted and sweet malt, plums and a sweet bitter finish. Alcohol was well hidden and didnt break the overall perfect balance of this beer. I know must find more of this since it is so incredible."
"Notes: 12 ounces is more than enough. You may want to share this bottle. And be sure to save it for the end of the night on a special occasion. The sweetness may be overpowering for some."
"i've been saving this since december, and i couldn't wait any longer. i should have waited until this coming december; as this fine belgian surely would keep nicely for awhile. i'll revisit this again!"
"Poured a hazy, amber brown color with thin foam that settled flat. The smell was a very nice sweet caramel and dried fruit (figs, raisins) aroma with some malt. The taste was full of dried fruit flavors, with some caramel malt sweetness, some sugar, and a vinous grape flavor. Very nice. The mouthfeel was smooth and sweet with medium body and low carbonation. The sweet fruity flavors lingered on the tongue. This was a very enjoyable beer, great for sipping and savoring."
"Pours with hardly any head that settles to a white ring. Cloudy amber color. Virtually no carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is sweet raisins. Starts and finishes sweet almost a little too sweet. The high ABV is not really noticeable. Pricey - $4.85 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Astounding! This is dessert in a glass and not your run of the mill, honey let's buy a pie from the grocery store dessert. This is dining at the Ritz, tuxeoded waiters and dishes enflambe type of dessert. A sure rarity, but it points to the possibilities inherent in a well aged De Dolle product (assuming the beer's in the bottle is clean)."
"Candy sugar, sweet oranges, apple, along with gentle touches of cinnamon & anise. Finishes warm, but cloyingly sweet. Round & soft of the pallet, medium bodied, gentle carbonation."
"I'm hoping to visit De Dolle Brouwers in July. Great Brewery."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
" I like this one quite a bit, though many will find the sweetness cloying. I enjoyed the sweet, malty finish, and would happily have another."
"Courtesy of Kahn's in Indy: This brew is a dark golden brown/orange color with a very thick off-white head. Thick and sticky lacing. Complex aroma of alcohol, sweet fruit, vanilla and malt. Medium-bodied and borderline cloying at times, but with a satisfying array of flavors. The different fruits like plum and apple are at the forefront. There is also a nice malt, spice and alcohol presence. The finish is very sweet with a lot of yeast. Taking your time with this one is the way to go. A very nice beer."
"Was on sale -- wanted to give it a go."
"The beer pours a cloudy amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a very spicey scent. There are a number of ingredients here, but I can't put my finger on a single one. It almost has a rootbeer smell to it; very refreshing. The taste is decent. It is really heavy and full of sweet malts and spices. I'm pretty sure corriander is used here along with ginger and some others. It warms on the way down. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. It drinks well. This is a good Belgian brew."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy and deep amber color with a frothy bright white head that piles high upon the body, as it desiccates the lace forms an encircling sheet upon the glass. Nice cotton candy sweet nose, caramel, ripe fruit dominate, fresh and crisp, a real treat for the senses, start is moderately sweet, perfectly malted and the top middling in feel. Finish is timidly acidic, the hops benign in their bite, sweet and sherry dry aftertaste, a fine beer and one I enjoyed immensely."
"In one word: Wow! This cloudy, dark orange beer is a great treat. The fruity aroma smells of apple and plum. These are but a few of the tastes in found in this very complex brew. There isn't much carbonation (and for that matter a head), but it does not matter.It is spicy in the finish with some pepper notes and a burst of warming alcohol. A must have in the winter time."
"Medium copper body, slightly hazy, with a small, off-white head. Smells of tangy fruit that's been soaking in alcohol overnight. Slightly vinuous, and yeasty. Taste was a little surprising. Over the top sweetness laced with alcohol, or more accurately: cough syrup, Belgian cough syrup. Whew! The big candy sugar/alcohol wave crashes into some sharp bitterness, but the nyquil-ness lingers on. The combination of the cloying candy sweetness and the medicinal alcohol prove too much for me to enjoy this. I'm hoping this bottle was an off one, but I'm afraid I won't be ponying up another $5 to find out."
"Taste is immaculately displayed with great, easy, and very yummy flavors of sweetish dark fruits and heavy liquored candies. Yum! Oh my, this is nice. Exceptional thickness. Its got a great heavy creamyness and feel thats loaded with great dark caramel and toffee candy laced with intermingling sweetened and ripe dark fruits of yellow raisins, plum, dates, and dulled orange. Notes of honey dart across the finish along with slight floral herbalness and a lingering darkened sweetness resides as the thickness just keeps sticking within and coating every pore in the back of the throat. A late warmth sneaks up into the nose clearing the senses a bit. Incredible for 8%, usually that amount doesn't offer up so much warming attributes but this stands on its own. Absolutely yummy and thick with a nice added oommff of warmth. Ohh so nice... lovely brew. Recommended!"
"Had this on tap at Redbones. Pour was a dark cloudy amber, head which settled down nicely. Aroma was of caramel. I found the taste to be of candied caramel. Mouthfeel was rather full, but very smooth and sweet. Definitely a sipping beer, I thought it would make an excellent dessert beer. Good, but a little bit goes a long way."
"This brew comes off more like juice than beer, with a stickiness clinging to the lips and a monstrous sweetness. This would be a terrific, albeit expensive beer to give to that girl you know that only likes fruity, neon colored mixed drinks, and claims that beer is gross. Not that it's unpalatable for a connoisseur, but it's an accessible flavor for the uninitiated. The $8 price tag on my glass will definitely prevent another round, but I don't think I could handle another anyways. The sweetness gets to be a bit much, and the last few sips become cumbersome."
"Drinakability is very high but can only imagine what a few of these would do my brain."
"This is a great one-at-a-time beer. Not quite so large at the Midas Touch, I think I actually prefer this one to that beer. Will order again."
"This beer has a nice copper colour, but it's cloudy from the yeast. The head dissapears quickly, leaving a thin white hint of the head. The smell has a bit of citrus fruit and yeast but you also smell the alcohol of this strong beer. It has a sweet taste, almost to sweet for me. You can taste the yeast too. The alcohol leaves a warm feeling and it is a beer to enjoy on a silent night when it is cold outside."
"Nice bright copper color with a suspension of particles hanging evenly dispersed throughout. No head whatsoever only a slight thin bubbly lace on the surface and a ring around the edge of the glass. Sweet malty aroma with some vinous notes. No real hops apparent on the nose. Very full and thick  even syrupy  mouthfeel. The palate is at once very sweet. Smooth malty start with very light carbonation that comes in towards the middle. Towards the end theres a slight tartness that develops, but the sweetness never fades. The finish is quite warming. There are some ever so slight vinous notes that come through from time to time. This brew is a bit too sweet and somewhat cloying for my palate. Not that I would never drink it again, but it wont worry me to not have it more then once a year. This is a sipper, not an overly drinkable brew. More like a heavily malted sweet barley wine then a typical Belgian ale."
"Many thanks to Paquette for this gift."
"As for the taste, it reminded me of really sweet rose water. The thick, very sweet orange/vinegar background definitely was not pleasant. Not sure if this was a skunked bottle, or if I just couldn't take this sickingly sweet beer."
"Overall: I'm happy with this beer, and I think that from time to time I will go back to it"
"Being a fan of de Dolle, I was really looking forward to trying Stille Nacht. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. Served from the trademark 11.2 oz Belgian brown bottle, it's a nice-looking copper with good-sized chunks of floating yeast despite a careful pour. The head disappears almost immediately. The smell is funky Belgian yeast and sugary sweetness. However, the sweet smell is not adequate preparation for the overwhelming sweetness of the taste. It's sticky sweet and reminiscent of a cherry soda. No hop bitterness or trace of sourness balances the mouth-coating effect of sugar-soaked cherries that makes this beer a labor to finish. Oh well, no brewery is perfect."
"Brown bottle pours a dark amber color. I could not produce much of a head on this beer. What was present disappeared quickly. Almost no lacing on my glass as I drank.Smells of sweet malt, and alcohol presence. This beer tastes very sweet, a touch caramel and butterscotch. This beer does a have a good medium body to it. I could taste the alcohol presence. This is an interesting beer. This is a good beer for the holidays to enjoy slowly. I will look for this again next year."
"I could not drink this beer or recommend it to anyone. I really wanted to like it and tried with each drink to convince myself it was good. Unfortunately, I could not get myself to like this beer. I'm not sure this was what they intended, but it is disappointing."
"Drinkability: This selection will be on my Christmas-time sipper list."
"A strange bird, but nice and warming! If this is supposed to be a strong dark ale-it ain't much in the color department, and a big zero in the headage department-zilch. Aromas, flavors, and textures are big, rich and syrupy in nature. In fact the beer almost looks like maple syrup coming out of the bottle. This is more of a dessert, or kick back in bed and read a book while sipping beer, than anything else. The flavors favor gooey malt extract, that come off in a big fruit cocktail like style. I will say, that while I am sipping this brew, we are having a snow storm out the window, and this is quite the comforting beverage. Simply expect this to be a hedonistic fruit driven over the top drink and you'l dig it!"
"As I drew near the end of the glass I wished that I had another, but alas, I did not. This beer is why I review styles I do not care for, so that I can better appreciate all styles and come to know variations within each style. This is especially true with Belgians that are so broad ranging."
" This is one strange beer. It had a lot of earthiness at first with spices and vegetable flavors. Alcohol came in large gusts. A few sips later, it was very sweet with minimal spiciness. A few other swigs had it tasting like brandy. The complexity was nice, but it really didn't all go together that well. I usually like something new and strange to me, but this one just didn't do it for me."
"Sweet! Stille Nacht is soooo sweet, maybe the sweetest beer I ever had. However, I like sweet so I liked it. It was a pretty orangey amber color with a big head, smelled like honey and wine, and spiced apples in there too. It tasted pretty much the same as it smelled, with that sweetened honey flavour predominating. I liked it but it was almost syrupy- a bit too thick for my liking- and I definintely wouldn't want to drink more than one glass of this stuff. I might try it again in a year, I'll be due for another by then."
"This bottle was a little bit too sweet - aging will probably do a lot to this beer."
"Other: Quaffed in honor of the pumpkin sculpture I made for my workplace's 2nd annual pumpkin decorating contest. I took three small white pumpkins of different sizes, hollowed one out, and then made a snowman out of it. Pictures available upon request."
"I really don't know what to make of this, and I'm absolutely confused."
"Drinkability  This is almost like an aperitif wine. It is very fruity, smooth, clean, sweet, and inviting."
"A deep golden color, with amber notes to it. Pours with hardly any head at all. It looks quite thick as it is poured into the glass, and is very lightly carbonated. Smells of honey and a general fruitiness. Tastes thick, complex, sweet, with a strong honey note to it. This beer is also lightly sour which balances wonderfully with the sweetness. This is a world-class beer, and is incredibly well balanced."
"$5.49 for a 330ml bottle at Big-10 in Lansing (A tremendous rip-off from the guys who automatically mark up any Belgian beer 300%.)"
"Deep eclipse orange (Can't see thru) color. Enormous white frothy head. Aroma is fruity, oranges and apples, and a little yeasty. Big candied fruit and yeast flavor that is so typical of Belgian ales. Flavor is apple-ish and spicy.Sweet and tart. Very intense flavor and carbonation. The 9% alcohol is very evident, but it sort of blends together with all the other stuff going on here. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is a little yeasty with an pronounced alcohol bite."
"Thanks so much to JohnnyDuvel for this one!"
"12 oz euro bottle. Poured a hazy orange color with a massive head that slowly receded. Aroma of malt and fruit. Taste is a complex blend of sweet, with some fruitiness, and a bitter finish. It is rather hard to describe. More like a barleywine in the complex flavors. This one is hard to place. Not bad but not something I'd have again soon."
"This was THE biggest head on a beer that I have witnessed since I started rating beers!! WOW!! The head was off-white with medium bubbles. The nose was that of clove, fruits and some sweetness. The carbonation was fizzy and the lacing was excellent with this beer. The taste was that of alcohol. This is definitely a beer to be sipped and enjoyed due to the presence of the alcohol. The body was murky and the hue was pale orange. The mouthfeel was a burning sensation in my throat as well as a warm sensation as it was digested. All in all, a good brew that I really enjoyed having the experience of drinking and rating."
"This is a very complex belgian. It improved as it warmed a little. Thick, dense head. But the taste and appearance of the beer proved it to be rather lighter than many belgians. The initial note is of a honey flavor coming forth followed by a spicyness that seemed a little too strong for my liking. A fruity sweetness came forth next to offset the spicyness. The beer finished with a yeasty dryness that left me wanting more. All in all a very good beer but probably not worth the price."
"I'm not sure if the vintage and aging have anything to do with it, but I'm certainly going to enjoy a few more of these!"
"Remember kids, don't chill a beer, let it warm up and then open it, especially a highly carbonated Belgian like this. Large misshapen head is out of control. Peach, lemon zest, salty. Alcohol a little too noticeable and the sweetness is a bit cloying. Surprisingly bitter finish."
"Cloudy amber, lots of tiny bits floating about, and millions of tiny bubbles racing to the top. Aroma is big and fruity, apple and pear mostly, some alcohol showing, too. Flavor is super sweet, mostly apple, ends with the alcohol poking through. Medium body, alcohol becomes more and more prominent towards the middle and end of the bottle."
"1982 Vintage (First Year). 10 euros at the Kulminator, and personally selected by Dirk and Leen as are ""final beer in Belgium"". A deep amber-ish colour with a frothy white head of foam. The aromas are excellent and consist of cotton candy, funky belgian yeast, sweet candied fruits, alcohol, red wine, and more. The taste is so freaking complex, that it is hard to describe. cherries, belgian lambic funk, sour red qualities, sugar, fruity, non-fruit sweetness, bubble gum, other various spices and fruits and more...The mouthfeel is perfect and the drinkability is excellent as well. I'd probably rate this vintage at a perfect 5!"
"Pours a murky looking dirty amber color. Huge, bubbly, white head. Fizzy and efferfescent. Great retention. Aroma is sweet and fruity to say the least. Melons, mango, grape skin, apricot. Pretty nice though. The flavors of this definitely tip the scale on the sweet side. In a Harvest Ale sort of way though. Sweet passion fruit and dark cherry rise up. A hint of alcohol. Maybe some spicing like orange curacao, nutmeg, ginger or corriander. I do notice a slight bitterness on the aftertaste. All in all, pretty nice."
"Whatever, I can't deal with this one."
"I could smell this brew even before I poured it. Cloudy deep amber with a beautiful head. Champagne like carbonation keeps the head alive long after the pour. I see some floaties hovering around inside the glass. Smells sweet like a wine. Hints of pineapple? My first sip sets me back. Pineapple and apricot flavors jump out at me followed by an alcohol warmth. No hoppiness to speak of, just sweet and fruity. Very creamy and thick on my tounge. I'm not sure what to make of this beer, I like the appearance and mouthfeel but it is just too sweet & tart for me."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that left circular lace as it subsided. A heavy aroma of malt and fruit with almost wine like aspects to the aroma. The flavor was of malt and fruit and an interesting finish. I have trouble figuring this beer out because it seems to be trying to be an dessert wine more than a beer. I would consider this a night cap kind of beer."
"This is first beer I've reviewed where the scores varied so much!"
"This is my second review of a de dolle beer. The beer is a beautiful cloudy brown. In great similarity to the ara bier, Stille Nacht has a ton of head that seemingly never reduces into a rich, thick, white head. Lace is very nice all the way down to the bottom. The aroma is malty with hints of fruit. The taste is dominated by apricot but still manages to be just a little sweet, with a hint of bitterness. I get a very hittle hint of hops in the beer. This is a medium-bodied beer that finishes a little dry. Defiantly a warming feeling on the way down. I would recommend to anyone."
"Cloudy golden color. Despite my best efforts, a huge explosive head erupts from the bottle. Head is rocky and lasts forever, full bubbly and beige. Full of sweet citrus aroamas, grapefruit, slight orange peel and subtle spices. Taste is at first full of citrus, and rich yeasty taste. Very typical of a belgian pale ale. (Not a dark, but that's what it says.) As the subtle yeast flavors fade, an overwhelming sweet candied fruit taste slides by an finishes the beer. Complex flavor combinations confuse the taste buds, but the sweetness is striking and overbearing. Very slick but not syrupy. Super sweet finish lingers. Harder to handle as it warms. Turns into a slow sipping beer, and at 8 % it probably is meant to be a night cap. A very interesting, complex and tasty beer, just a bit to sweet to be really outstanding."
"A unique brew that demands a lot.  Attractive depth of color and powerful head retention, definite alcohol presence in the nose.  Sweet as the dickens at first sip, rounded of slightly by some hops somewhere in the distant background and some muddled yeastiness.  If the sweetness isn't enough to floor you, the alcoholic content kicks in on the follow-up.  Lots of candy sugars are right there in the moderately full mouthfeel together with a good warmth, followed by a finish that either leaves you gasping for air or gasping for more.  Although quite impressive, perhaps a bit too sweet for me, I'll have to give it another shot when my taste buds deteriorate.  Not a beer for the weak-hearted."
"Bloody Marvellous !"
"Hazy copper hue, topped by a tremendously dense and persistent ivory white head.  Doesn't look like a Dark Strong at all.  Ripe fruit sweetness, citrus rind, sugary honey w/ a hint of buttery, sweet bready malt in aroma.  Sugary, candy like sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ensued by musty yeast flavors, and assertive non descript spiciness.  Ripe, perhaps overly ripe sweet fruit abounds and when coupled with initial sugary sweetness, the overall profile is very sweet, and just a hair of being cloying.  Hop bitterness is virtually nonexistant.  Moderately bodied.  Finishes w/ lingering fructose - like sweetness lingering.  Stille Nacht is a complex brew, but the residual sweetness is a bit offputting, and hurts the drinkability.  It falls short of its aroma's promise.  That being said, it's still worth a shot due to its uniqueness-- it's a stylistic bastard."
"A strange beer definitely. Kind of sweet aroma and taste, but before passing judgment on this beer, you kind of have to stop and think. To me it was quite sweet and not overly impressive, but there is a time for it for sure, kind of a dessert wine character, and more impressive with every sip, acidic lemon flavour combines with a orangy marmalade flavour, interesting, unique."
"A strange beer. Too much sweet, smell and taste.A ""cotton-wool"" taste, too much sweet again, and even unbalanced to the alcohlic. A delusion..."
"This is by far one of my favorite beers.  Another of the Monk's Cafe selections, I tried this on recommendation from a friend.  Nice fruity character that is not too overwhelming.  Smooth finish."
"Purchased at t'Brugs Beertje back in April 2000 -- thanks Daisy."
