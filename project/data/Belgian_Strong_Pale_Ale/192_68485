I wouldn’t go out of my way to look for it, but I would probably buy it again if it popped up and my pocketbook was feeling heavier than normal. I don’t think I’d really like to drink more than one at a time. So, grab a 22 oz. and share it with a friend.","TheBiercast","Oct 28, 2013"

Well the flavor is a little sour up front but smooths out quickly and finishes slight tart and mildly sweet. The one tastes like one of those multi fruit minute made fruit juices. Very tropical with mostly pineapple and tangerine with some peach. Belgian character is understated. Medium to thick body and moderate carbonation. This one is pretty unidimensional and hardly Belgian. This series has disappointed me again.","kylehay2004","Mar 18, 2013"

That turned me off a bit, but for the illogical reason that I like to be surprised by the brewer's creativity. This really would have been a better beer if they kept the oaky flavors more muted. I like some oak, but a little goes a long way. An interesting, if unremarkable beer.","Philousa","Dec 27, 2011"

Candy sweetness and rampant fruit mixes with a serious alcohol presence to give this a flavor more akin to something you find at a frat party in a cooler with random pieces of fruit floating around in it. I am already wondering if I can finish the bomber after the first 5 sips or so. The toffee malts are just way out of place here and the alcohol is very rough and raw.

Some vague floral fruitiness meets spiciness, with medicinal herb and alcohol in the nose. Some smoothness, slick with a big body. Mild tartness with a thick malty foundation, and a hint of sweetness up front. Toasted bread and ripe fruit soon make way for a more toasty, dry, almost broth-like flavor. Spicy, boozy alcohol, rose water and tropical fruit. Semidry finish clings to the booziness. A serious beer if strength is considered, though beyond that, it lacks a bit of depth that was expected.

Yes, they're coming out w/ warming. Taste is unique, and slightly strange to me. The hops show up a bit, but it's mainly pear juice and malt that I get, w/ pear juice being on the strong side. Everything seems just a little out of balance to me. It's not horrible, it's just not great. Mouthfeel is syrup smooth, and very sweet. Not a lot of complexity in this category.

The flavor is very sweet right away - lots of caramel and fruit notes - strong pear and cherry notes, turning a bit sourish with a touch of hops coming in at the end along with a hint of yeasty spice notes.

The nose comprises buttery caramel, sourdough, light tart black cherry, light roasted malts, and light maple syrup. The taste holds notes of maple syrup, light wood (an amalgam of oak and balsa), light roasted malts, light coffee, toffee, mandarin orange syrup, and a twinge of green apple skin. Something akin to maple-smoked bacon is in there, too. All told, it's not the greatest taste combination I've ever experienced. The body is a straight medium, with a light medium carbonation and a nearly syrupy feel. Overall, though it's not an entirely bad beer, I feel it is definitely misnamed.

The Belgian yeast flavors provide a bit of balance but not much. This beer seems to be a little unbalanced and all over the place. A bit boozy too, especially as it warms up. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and a little syrupy, which kinda works to this beer's advantage IMO. Drinkability is fair, as it is overly sweet and boozy.

Some light grassy like hops floating around as well. Not bad, just too light. Definitely some grain in here to. I have seen better, though it was still decent. Not being really bad in anyway, just way too light for my tastes. There was a nice presence of fruity yeast, but you almost had to look for it, which was unfortunate. Hints of pears and apricot again, maybe some light apple. Nice bit of grainy like flavors and a touch of grass in the finish. A decent profile for sure, just way too light for me.

How can any ""Cru"" look this clear? It smells god awful. It smells of fermenting rotten sweet pears. I didn't know I was composting in my glass. Great. It tastes of rotten, fermenting pears with a touch of alcohol and honey. It's so light in body and the style and the alcohol content. I don't know what they were aiming for but they missed horribly. At 10.49 a bottle, this is one of the worst beers I've ever had, especially for the price point. I wish they'd take a moment to improve their Lips of Faith series. Le Terroir was and is phenomenal, their Dunkel is good, La Folie is exceptional, but everything else is low grade. This ""Super Cru"" never should've been made. How did this get approved? AVOID! I wouldn't drink this again if it granted me eternal life or provided me with an opportunity to slap Ronald Reagan.","aasher","Jun 23, 2011"

Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy malt, slight hop, slight wood, and hint of citrus.

3.33,-2.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Opinion: Again, I am certain that this beer was just sold early as you really can't condition a beer this big long enough at the brewery. I would not deter you from getting this beer as about 5 years in a cool cellar (or refrigerator) would do wonders for it. As it is, it is a bit hard to drink. The yeast is just too strong and is not playing well with the rest of the beer. As it is, I will be scoring this one a bit low too, but I am taking in mind the potential that this beer has too. There are no fermentation flaws to kick it out except maybe that the yeast ran a bit hot for my taste, but this will soften with age too.","SkeeterHawk","Jun 19, 2011"

3.3,-3.8,4,4,3,3,3,"Yeah, tartness is a good word for the flavor too. Almost too much so. The pear is overripe or something. I've had Asian pears and these in this here beer are past their prime. Or perhaps they don't blend well with the yeast or malt. I don't know, but it doesn't quite work out. The malt is firm and rich, but then turns a bit sour. Is this a sour ale?

They are a company that is a love and hate thing for me in the Lips of Faith department. I wish they would stray away from the tootsie roll malt that seems to be their base as it messes up too many of their LoF beers. Other than that I didn't mind the two or three step beer that I poured. The ABV makes it a little hard to drink a full 22oz but I think the blending could have been done a little better as well.","alleykatking","May 31, 2011"

3.23,-5.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Firm up the body here; clearly just doubling the recipe isn't working to keep the balance in check. The yeast able to eat its way over 9% abv can clearly make short work of the Fat Tire malts. Furthermore, I wouldn't stick with the pear juice either. This seems to be a case of jamming 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag, before seeing if the bag can handle 5 pounds in the first place. Skip this one until they get the recipe correct.","BretSikkink","May 28, 2011"

Nothing too impressive. The flavor is sweet with big flavors of apple and pear. That biscuit malt flavor from fat tire is present as well as a bit of spice and that saison yeastiness. Its kinda like a really sweet, fruitier version of fat tire, missing just a bit of that richness. The mouthfeel is nice, with good, not too aggressive carbonation and a sweet, but not overly coating finish. Overall, this I not quite what I expected, and yet I am not sure how it would have worked otherwise. The sweetness could be toned down a touch and replaced with more of that signature rich malt flavor from fat tire. But I'm nitpicking.
