"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/10/2015. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, orange peel, lemon zest, light banana, wheat, pepper, clove, coriander, floral, herbal, grass, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of spice, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apple, lemon zest, orange peel, grape, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, candi sugar, light honey, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, lemon zest, light banana, clove, coriander, pepper, wheat, herbal, floral, candi sugar, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong ale! All around great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pretty standard Belgian strong. Age has faired this a bit better than expected, but I probably should have drank it sooner still."
"Overall - It's good, but too heavy. I enjoy the spice combination, as strong as it is."

"Overall, excellent. A really good BSPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a large frothy white head that quickly disappates into a small head that clings to the side of the glass. Great aroma filled with lemon, coriander, and pepper. Lots of spice in the flavor but not overpowering. A touch of heat from the alcohol is noticable, but is more warming than uninviting. Surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer. By far the best beer I've had from Southampton to date. Would definitely buy this again."

"O: An interesting and heavily spiced BSPA. Not as crisp and refreshing as a lot of BSPAs tend to be, this one is bigger, smoother and spicier. Nice balance of flavors and quite complex. I prefer mine on the lighter, crisper side but this is still quite good. Drinkability is oddly high despite the ABV. It's oddly smooth."
""
""
""
"O: super - better than the Beast (Avery brewing), IMO, these being my only two ""grand cru"" BSPAs - reminds me of a tripel but with more spices and less fruity flavors - has the same soft character and grace."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, Belgian yeast, and some slight citrus aromas. Taste is pretty much the same with the spices lingering on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice set of aromas and an even better taste."
""
""
""
"O- A pretty substantial letdown since I'm a huge Southampton fan. This is only the second beer of theirs I consider just OK."
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but not a real easy drinker - there is just too much alcohol presence to be an easy drinker. I think this is a more sipping over an hour or so kind of beer. Very nice beer."

"o: I fell in love with the first sip, but turns out it was just infatuation."

"O - One of the better offerings from Southampton. Glad to see one of the locals do a good take on a belgian style."
"Southampton Grand Cru glides into the glass golden with a small tint of faded bronze within. a nice sheet of bright white up top, leaving a cap and small splotches. OK retention. Smell is fruity with a bready Belgian yeast with trace amounts of candi. No grassy scents, some hints of alcohol. Pretty bold in scent off the tap with a bit candi like scent than alot of American versions. Taste is up front with Belgian essence and a fruit. Apple, pear, small earthy hop bite in between with some candi sugar in the end that does not cloy. First sips give off some alcohol that warms the gullet. The 9.5% is not all the way hidden. Feel is a strong medium with a nice crisp carb. After half the glass this becomes all to easy to drink. A nice stab at the style and much better than alot of American versions out there. I just wish bottles were not so damn pricey, this would be a nice one to slide into 4 packs or so. Until then, I'll grab it on tap."

"Amazing price on this beer and it's well worth the money! Thanks again J ryan's for providing outstanding beer at reasonable prices."
"O- This is the only beer I have had from Southampton, but it makes me want to try their others. It really is a nice beer, the first night I tried it I had a couple glasses with a meal and thought it was fantastic, so good that I wanted to go back just to try it again on its own to see if it was really as good as I remembered. It is nicely complex, subtle and balanced. This is definitely my favorite American Belgian-style beer I have tried so far."
"This is medium bodied with a smooth feel and modest to lower levtl of carbobation that gives fhe impression of a thicker feeling brew. Yet somehow it is fizzy in the feel when swirled around. The alcohol is well masked behind the bold sweetness. Overall not a bad offering but much, much more sweet than I was expecting."

"O: The beer seems to be more malty compared to other beers in the style but hides its alcohol well and isn’t cloying."

"For that reason alone, it's not a completely high rated beer to me, but I'll be blown away if it stops being highly rated, because it is damn well crafted. And perfect for after football. Cheers to Double Windsor for pouring it on tap!"
"I picked up a 750mL bottle of this at Anocona`s wines and spirits. The appearance is a nice honey color with nearly two fingers of bright white head to it; served in a wide wine glass. The nose of this ""grand cru"" has coriander, citrus and some funk. Its` taste comes through with orange, anise, candied goodness, mmm. The body is fairly lean for the abv, but with a sharp carbonation. It is a remarkably good beer and its one that I waited longer than I should have to pick up."
"Overall the bottle was 1.5-2 years old and age wasn’t very kind to it. The sweetness was too much and the flavors seem too muddled. I’d like to try this fresh for comparison, but the aged version was something I’d not seek again."
"Overall very good, a decent version of an Americanized Belgian grand cru, similar to their abt12 but lighter and more fruit, complex and good, hides the booze decently well, great flavors."
"O - Spice is often used to cover things up, they should have tried to cover up the spice with this one. Not a fan."
"Drinkability is high on this brew. It takes a hit on the appearance, and it can get a little sweet after a couple of glasses. Other then that this a great beer and I am ISO-ing this ASAP. I want more! Great brew."
"O: 'Grand Cru' typically denotes the 'best' a brewery has to offer; while this may not be my outright favorite of the Southamptons I've enjoyed, it's definitely among them. A superb accompaniment with dinner (soba noodles and braised vegetables, hanger steak on the side) and for sipping, after much warming, a bit later. My second time trying this terrific beer - looking forward to the third and beyond..."
"This beer quaffs way too easily. Just had some Pliny the Younger last night, so this is two nights in a row of high ABV brews that go down easy and delicious. Southampton nailed this, outstanding."
"Very fruity with grainy malts and high alcohol. This could pass for a triple were it not for the coriander. Maple syrup comes out as it warms and the yeast esters are all over the map - fruit, bread dough, herbal. Very Belgian-y beer, quite complex and spices are fairly low-key. For some reason though, I find it to be a bit sweet and the esters really never come together well. Seems like others like it, so maybe this ones just not for me."
"Happy New Year!"
"The star anise... no. Nope, nope, nope. I hate... HATE... HATE star anise flavors. I can stand them and appreciate it. However, I despise it. Thankfully it is not here at all, thought. I mean, I think I should be able to pick it out since it causes a gag reflex at too high of a concentration."
"Beer finishes really dry, that's the first thing I notice. Sweet up front with some interesting esters in the midpalate, minimal spice for an ale that is advertised as a spice ale, but I actually like that the spices are kind of hidden. There is some bitterness that I am picking up now with the finish of the beer, the yeast character is coming through more now. The ester levels are growing and it's a great feeling beer. I'd have it again for sure, very nice. I need to drink more South Hampton beers."
"One of the great strong pale ales. Hard to slow down and take all the flavor in. With the high ABV, slowing down is necessary."
"This is a beer with all kinds of complexity, a light, easy-to-drink body, & a nice shot of spices that don't go over the top. Very good brew."
"Overall, a very solid Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Complex but very quaffable at the same time and it packs a serious punch. I recommend trying this one wholeheartedly. This is clearly the best thing I've had from Southampton Publick House. Well done!"
"The only thing American made belgians cannot seem to duplicate is the head of the brew. This one is no different. A bit of a soapy head and it goes down quickly. That is the only negative as it pours a cool, bright, caramel color. Scents of Belgian candy, sweet coriander, pepper. Taste is unique. A bunch of describable flavors hit the palate immediately followed by a sweet appley aftertaste. Almost like a cream soda. It is sweet, which I do not usually care for, but this has a different taste to it. Very warming alcohol and a real treat. I really enjoyed this one."
"DB- Citrus and spice are huge but do not bother me as much as some other Belgians. Maybe the caramel malt is balancing it. Alcohol adds some harshness. Lots of fruit as well. Split the bottle for sure."
"Hope you like oranges! Malty fruit bomb this is. I didn't expect a 'Grand Cru' to be so fruity and sweet. That being said, I liked it, could use some more complexities. Definitely a sipper. Good price for a 750 for nowadays standards."
"Fantastic beer. This one had sat on my Wants list for awhile but I'd never gotten around to pursuing it... I think that may change. Glad to have tried this."
"Clear honey orange pour with a quick-vanishing head. Sweet aroma of oranges and pretty heavy malt. A decent amount of candied seville oranges shine through, which is kind of becoming a staple of some Southampton brews I find. Nice, big, juicy flavors, but pretty sweet and just a thin mouthfeel. Some creaminess could really help this beer. More pleasant nuances begin to unfold toward the bottom of the bottle, as is custom with Southampton. Delightful floral notes play with the candied orange. Kind of reminiscent of the Cuvee des Fleurs when the yeast mixes in. Possibly a great one to cellar."
"A great easy to drink beer to start the night. Also a great attempt at a belgian, not very often does a belgian get nailed by an American."
"Notes: First impression wasn't anything spectacular, but as I drink this and it warms, this gets more and more interesting. Would like to sample a fresh bottle to see if there is any hop bitterness, but I'm not unhappy at all about having cellared this one for quite some time."
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is orange peel, coriander and caramel malt. The flavor is orange, coriander, wheat, toffee, candi-sugar and caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and was very nicely balanced. Very well made and flavorful beer overall."
"This bottle of Southampton Grand Cru was purchased at Liquor World, and is from 2004. After a heavy pour, still not much heading, but color is nice, coming out dark orange. Many particles of yeast sediment can be seen as well. The nose has a large presence of mandarin oranges, and other citrus components. Some yeasty character, and honey emerge as strong smells too. Big blast of honey up front from the taste, followed by a bit of that citrus, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy sweet, to the point that it almost reminds me of a mead. There is some carbonation there to help the drinkability, but the overall sweetness and thick body can make this one difficult to have a lot of. I am surprised that this beer shows the same sorts of characteristics that it did when I had it fresh. It is worth a try I suppose, though not one of my favorites within this style."
"Don't drink and review."
"To be blunt, this beer is pretty unimpressive. It tastes good, but the blend of earthy, creamy breadiness and harsh spiciness isn't always that great, despite how nicely restrained the added spices are overall. The mouthfeel is pretty lackluster (especially for a BSPA), and the taste itself isn't particularly interesting. While there are a lot of good flavors and aromas here, none of it is done particularly well. I would pay $7-$8 for a 6-pack of this occasionally, but I can't see why in the world I would buy another 750ml bottle with so many better Belgian style ales available."
"D: Not as complex as some of the better BSPA's, but very nice. Glad I got to try this one."
"Ok, before I start the review, I'll just say wow. I've been sitting on a bottle for awhile and never bothered to try this for no particular reason. After my first sip I was very disappointed I don't have any more of this. Appearance is a clear deep orange/amber with minimal sediment and a light tan/off white head that settles in as a thick crown and thin film with minimal lacing. Aroma is a delicate balance of orange peel, cream, vanilla, yeast and mild spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation resulting in an overall creamy, soft texture. Flavor is very sweet, complex and rich without being too cloying or unappealing. The sweet (ripe fruit, candied sugars, belgian yeast) and spice balance each other well. Drinkability is incredible, I went into this expecting another run of the mill BSPA, but ended up very impressed with this unique beer."
"Bottle from the free table at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a hazy murky goldenrod/orange color with a small, wet white head. Aromas of caramel and earthy leafy hops, candied orange, spices, and yeast. Flavor is nutty caramel with a little stone fruit and coriander. Some alcohol warmth. Great complexity, nice firm body and fine carbonation."
"D: I'd definitely have this again. I'm not sure I'd drink this all night, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down."
"A three year old bottle. Decently large white head of several fingers. It slowly recedes to a thin cap and ring on the perimeter. Amber in color clouded by yeast after the initial pour, with an active carbonation. Smell is caramel malt, orange , vanilla, coriander, Belgian yeast esters, banana, and alcohol. Taste is full of sweet caramel malt with a slight roasted presence. Sophisticated bittering that balances the broad malt sweetness. Banana and clove like spiciness that evokes wiess without the wheat twang, then the coriander and light anise takes it somewhere deep in Belgium. Alcohol is well integrated but gives a fusel edge. Introducing the yeast tames it considerably. Light biscuit in the finish. Finish is long, dominated by the malt sweetness with the hops kissing it closed. Feel is medium weight with a carbonation that leans toward crisp and effervescent. A silky suppleness on the tongue. Drinkability start out good and seems to improve as the alcohol presence fades as I work down the bottle."
"This is a drinkable beer. I'm happy to have had the experience. The ABV is very apparent at the end, but that's a good thing."
"Drinkability: ABV holds it back a touch....but thats it!"
"Copper in color and cloudy with a large beige head. High carbonation is evident and the head retention benefits, though not as much lacing as expected. The nose has a good amount of butterscotch and Belgian malts, acidic sour cherries and plenty of other fruity esters. The alcohol is evident as well. I wasn't too appetized by the scent, but as soon as this hit my tongue I quickly discovered a complex and tasty brew. The malts and fruits that seemed more separated in the nose come together very nicely with a moderate amount of sourness, creating tastes of dried cherries, rum raisins, candi sugar, and a plentiful amount of Belgian style flora and phenols. The finish is lightly cookielike with a hint of dried fruit, and ends drier than it would seem to. This is a full bodied beer with moderate to high levels of natural fine carbonation. A nice beer, though it doesn't really tickle my personal taste."
"Drinkability: A completely transcendent buzz comes from this beer. One of the weirdest and euphoric I've ever received, if not the weirdest and euphoric. I'm starting to think wormwood was involved in this or something. But Wow. What a beer. One of those ""experience"" beers without having to be something completely new. I wish I had a case of this to sit, because weird and wild things will certainly be going on as the beer ages. Get. A. Bottle."
"Large bubbly off white head with weak retention but good lacing. this beer pours a bright pinkish copper that looks beautiful when held to a light. The aroma of this beer is very fruity and sweet. I hate to say it but it reminds me of fruit loops and lemon drops. Unexpected amount of spice in the flavor, the nose was really deceiving. Lemon zest, oranges, peaches, hint of ginger and black pepper, a little boozy, and some nice earthy notes. This is a nice beer to sit around and sip on. Wrong beer for tonight, still very good though."
"Mouthfeel is medium to medium/full with a healthy dose of stingy carbonation. This is one odd beer. Very impressive that all these unique characteristics blend together to create a one-of-a-kind beer that makes you want to keep taking sips to see what you'll find next. If it wasn't for the metal/plastic aspect that was present mostly in the smell I would have rated this higher."
"Drinkability- First and foremost, I'm not a huge fan of the style. Usually the American version of these brews are either too sweet or too highly spiced. Hell, even the Belgium versions of Belgium's sometimes are too sweet or too spicy. This brew is neither and is quite simply tasty as hell. Glad I let this be for over 2 ½ years because it's drinking freaking spectacular. Thanks Adam!"
"D - Decent example, but not nearly as good as their Saison. I found this to be a bit too buttery and one-dimensional."
"D: Very drinkable. It was very good both cold and at cellar temperature."
"This poured a nearly opaque copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like sweet oranges and lemon zest, with creamy wild yeast and a variety of earthy spices including nutmeg, vanilla, and ginger. It tasted like oranges and cream, with lemon zest and bready yeast, and some nutmeg and ginger and coriander. It was somewhat thick with mild smooth carbonation, and had a mellow bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very complex and delicate beer that blended many tastes and scents together very well. It had awesome body and hid the alcohol nicely too, so it was very easy to drink but worth taking your time with. It could probably improve with some age, also. This is a fantastic beer that's unique but classic."
"D - Gotta be in the mood for this one but if you are, it's an excellent beer."
"D - Too unique and palate killing for long term. Fun to try, though."
"Thanks JNN4V!"
"D - On the sweeter side & fairly high alcohol which limits the sessionability but it's something I'd recommend and I'd drink it again."
"Bottle purchased at Bierkraft last fall. Hazy orange with small white head and a tad of sediment toward the bottom of the bottle. Smells like orange peels, alcohol and sweet malt. Tastes...the same. Very sweet. I admit I don't detect the star anise. Might benefit from being a bit drier, but I can't really complain. Body is thick and sticky, carbonation is below average."
"Reviewed on 05/23/2009. Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet butterscotch, orange peel, and sweet malt. Flavor of more of the same, sweet butterscotch, orange peel, star anise, lots of malt. Meh, not a fan...very sweet."
"Need to find a way to get this more consistently in California!"
"Anise, corriander and orange peel are all evident as the bottle would say. But there is so much more. Golden raisin, candied apple and some pitted fruit flavors lead through from front middle and finish long into the finish. Slightly sweet but not cloying at all. I could keep going on but it would get repetitive and this keyboard blows. Yay Dell XPS."
"Holy crap, this is a great beer. It is bar none the best American-made Belgian that I've ever had, and actually probably the best Belgian (although I can imagine some Trappists getting even better with age on them). The beer is a glowing golden liquid with an excellent creamy head. The nose and flavor are both very complex. It's a sweet Belgian flavor that works incredibly well. There is a balancing spice of coriander and light pepper. The sweetness is a blend of earthy Belgian tones, candied malt and hops that taste like wildflowers. Hats off to Southampton for this one. The feel is creamy and luscious. Despite being aware of the hype, I was happily surprised at just how much I enjoyed this beer. I split a bottle with good friends, and I wish that I had another to do it again. Ship to California, Southampton. Please."
"Note: I have had this beer many times in the past but just realized that I have never reviewed it until now."
"Thick creamy body is perfectly carbonated. Every sip brings new flavors through the finish. Fantastic ale that deserves to be enjoyed at or above cellar temp. This really opens up as it warms."
"D: I haven't had it fresh but goddamn is it good aged."
"Drinkability... sorry guys, couldn't even finish a two ounce sample."
"Overall-great beer, complex, fine tasting, a lot of flavors, well worth a try."
"Overall, this is a great, great beer. A little too sweet for me, but I will be aging one to drink in, oh, 5 years or so."
"D- Good tasting, interesting flavor, not a bad beer overall, and a little different take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale with the different spicing of coriander, orange peel, and star anise. Basically a witbier with no wheat (as far as i know)."
"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting, but my expectations were certainly surpassed. This is a fantastic Belgian style beer and very, very drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"EDIT: Had this again with in a short time. Messy, to say the least. Spices were all over the place, and an alcoholic taste that was really discomforting. Much harsher then the first time."
"Thanks to DrJay for sending me this one in the 80's BIF!"
"D- Splitting this one with a friend was just fine. A good sipping beer, but definitely not one to session."
"This is definitely a sipper - I'd be interested in seeing this age further. Very nice offering. Just saw that alcohol wasn't mentioned once in my notes from a few weeks back - that's gotta count for something. Good stuff."
"Overall: waste of time and effort"
"Had my sister pick this up for me in New York on her way down to NC. As a fan of Duvel I had to try this and I am glad that I finally did. Comparatively this is not on par with the above mentioned beer but nontheless this is a strong brew. I particulary like the flavor combinations and the fact that it is not overwhelming even though it has a high ABV. Good beer that I wish was available down here, hopefully I can get some more soon. Would like to try other offerings from Southampton."
"D: This was one of the best ones of this style I've had. Even my wife a non beer drinker enjoyed it's complexity regardless of the high ABV. Not one to be disposed of quickly but to sip and smack your lips to all night long. This type of beer makes me put pend to pad asa well as being proud of American craft brewers and their versions of Belgian classics. I cannot say enough about how good this beer is to drink."
"Picked up at New Beer in NYC."
"Drinkability is somewhat impaired by the booziness that comes to the fore as this one warms up, but its more or less par for the course for such a big beer.. Big thanks to Derek for sharing this beast!"
"Thanks to skinnyelvis for this halloween '08 treat."
"This beer is highly drinkable, espcially considering a fairly high ABV%. The balance and complexity make sure that you could drink this all night. My initial reservations and prejuidices about this one were definitely wrong. This is a beer I will surely be trying again."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with foamy white head. Spicy aroma with hints of light fruits as well a touch of hops. Very quaffable considering the 9.5 ABV. Spicy with hints of apple, pear,, and orange peel. Very nice interpretation of the classic belgian style."
"Poured a cloudy, golden yellow color with a large off white head. Aroma and tastes of spices, citrus, yeast, leather, caramel and oranges. Alcohol well hidden."
"I really enjoyed this. Big thanks to aerozeppl."
"Note: I think this bottle had been sitting on a high shelf, in the light, at my local grocery store for a long time, so it may not have been a prime example of the beer."
"I have had this beer two other times, both on tap. I am just as blown away this time as I was then. To me, a perfect beer. My first and only all 5."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is nice high-gravity Belgian beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"After looking for a bottle of this for some time, I was definitely thinking this would not meet my expectations...but I'm finishing up my last few sips, and I've concluded that this is the real deal. Just superb..near brewing perfection."
"What's not to love about this one? Very little. Perhaps the look's just okay. That's about it. This is one tremendous beer. Even if you're not a big fan of Belgians, this one may change your mind. Flat out great beer. I'm so stoked I've got another 750 waiting in the wings. But, not for tonight. Not just yet."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp and clean. Easy drinking BSPA."
"This is a very enjoyable beer, particularly after warmed slightly above cellar temperature and decanted to open it up. Pleasant balance and overall flavor make it easy to continue to sip through the bottle. Alcohol and richness are the only real detractors in drinkability, though not enough to stop craving it."
"Oily after dinner sipper. Non existent carbo; head makes brief appearance then out of sight, possibly due to the oversized wine glass. Strand of sweet candy sugar introduces dry, bitter peel. Herbal and medicinal towards the center, hint of slight tart then overun by a complex vacuum of booze, thats suprisingly well hidden. An amber wine with several components to its character; didn't do me right though."
"Sweet, soft, candy-ish malt flavors up front. Herbal grassy hoppiness on the edge. Becomes fruitier with notes of tropical fruits (kiwi, pineapple, a little banana) and melon. Warming, peppery alcohol adds to the complexity. Mild herbal bitterness in the finish with lingering peppery alcohol and residual sugary malt. Very nice. Rocky, lively carbonation in an otherwise creamy, full body. A wonderful beer."
"M: Full, rich, somewhat velvety. A very good carbonation note, very nicely done. This is a very tasty brew, and one I look forward to getting into again. Excellent."
"Pours a golden amber with a white head. The smell I get is of cream, citrus and other assorted spices I can not peg. The flavor is very nice of a well crafter well balanced beer with most of the flavors from the smell intensified in the taste. The mouthfeel was nice it seems to be a nicely carbonated Beer. Not something I think I could drink all night but certainly something I would like for special occasions, which I did! This was the beer I saved to drink of my wedding night with my wedding dinner!"
"This so far is the best beer I have had from Southampton. I wasn't that impressed at first but it continues to get better as it warms. The mouthfeel, spiciness, and warmth set this apart from others of a similar style but as I drink I keep wanting more and more. This is actually an excellent beer that I would love to pick up more of."
"Very complex...too complex for words. I've enjoyed this entire big bottle."
"An outstanding an impressive beer. Superbly balanced, tasty, attractive, this beer has it all. Recommended. Goes well with fries."
"Nice big mouthfeel, easy to drink no problem finishing the bomber. Love it. and go on...."
"Into my Hennepin glass, pours a pale but rich golden color with a very nice and generous off-white head and some spotty lacing. The nose is soft and plush, soft fruity and floral tones. The taste gets a bit more assertive, less mysterious, yet hard to qualify. I could tell you there is nice orange peel, corriander and anise, but they're so well integrated its counterproductive to attempt to discern them. The body isn't too light or heavy, the alcohol only the slightest warmth, the finest of carbonation. This is one fine brew, marvelous."
"The finale of the BIF Race 2008 package from Eyedrinkale, Southampton Grand Cru arrived in a 750 ml. corked and caged bomber. When poured in a flute, the head occupied more than half the glass. The body of the beer was clear and golden to orange in color. The aroma of the beer was like a spice cake, with oranges, clove, rum raisins, and sherry smells. The taste was cake like as well because of the sweet bready and airy malt backbone with all of the flavors I was smelling embedded within. Since a Grand Cru is generally served at weddings, the cake character was apropos. The alcohol provided a bitter, ethereal, drying counterpoint to this flavor. Richly textured in the mouth with a satiny feel. Unlike the PC game Portal, this cake is not a lie."
"D- Can't believe I finished this one so quickly. Amazing beer and one of my favorites."
"Recommended..."
"Chalice time for this bad boy, been sitting in my refrigerator for too long. Quarter inch head fills out the straw color, medium carbonation. Smell is clove, lemon zest and maple. The maple really comes through in the mouth with candied fruits and even the slight touch of ginger ale. It got me thinking and then researching: beers made with maple?"
"D- This beer was complex but had light flavors making it very easy to drink. The sweet beginning was balanced by the dry finish and there was hints of funk blending with complex yeast qualities. Everything about this beer was balanced. I was truly a wonderful beer."
"A dual between this and the Fin du Monde for supremacy, in my book. A really fantastic beer."
"I'll have to bury the next one."
"Another very impressive Southampton."
"You can smell the Coriander and Star anise right away! It looks light orange with a paper thin head. Smells awesome! Very sweet from the star anise and coriander. A nice sweet slightly malty flavor of the above mention ingredients. full mouthfeel with what seems to be a little extra carbonation. Very active carbonation indeed! Light but very bubbly. Fills the mouth with flavor and explodes with a unique sweetness. I think I could drink this wonderful beer all damn day! Another hit from SOUTHAMPTON, although it is very sweet. Kudos!"
"750 mL bottle of Southampton Grand Cru. The beer pours an attractive copper color with an inch or two of off-white foam. The aroma is heavy on the spice, coriander at least, and also some citrus fruit with a little bit of yeast. Sweet and fruity (apples) up front and finishes with a bang of spice (coriander again) and alcohol. A little thick on the palate for this style. The sweetness is a little heavy on the palate and the alcohol is a little much at the end. I was hoping for more complexity, but over all not bad."
"Complexity & dryness hurts the drinkability, but only a bit. This would right at home in Belgium. Well done SouthHampton!!"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I think perhaps a little sweeter overall than I would like, a bit more bitterness or drier finish would have been nice. I didn't taste much of the spices, and I made comparison to coriander seeds and star anise I had on hand- personally, I'm glad I couldn't distinguish it clearly, I enjoyed the more melded flavors. While I would enjoy drinking this again, I can't say I want to drink it all the time, hence less than a four on drinkability. But this is definitely a beer I enjoyed."
"One of my first experiences with Southampton and it was not bad, usually not a big fan of Grand Crus but this one was pretty good, would probably age very well, would drink again if I ever get the chance, recommended"
"I think my Grand Cru lost some carbonation through the cork, because it lacked it almost entirely, from reading the other reviewers, but the beer is still quite good despite it. The beer as mentioned is a coppery orange, some head and retention. The smell is apple, coriander, sweet malts, but not an overly strong aroma. The taste is sweet malts, apple, coriander, with a sherry like consistency, but it lacks some of the yeasty full bodiedness of a genuine Belgian, perhaps because the carbonation ran out. The beer is a bit syrupy, not entirely full bodied though. I knocked this beer down a few points because of the overly strong alcohol notes in the finish. This is a 9.5 ABV that tastes even stronger. I tend to appreciate when the throaty alcohol notes are more subdued or hidden behind complex tastes. Not so here. This is a good beer, but I'm going to have to try another bottle that has more carbonation, and perhaps it will merit a re-review."
"While I am not a fan of ""spicy"" beers in large amounts, half a bottle proved just right."
"D: While not the biggest fan of Grand Cru this is a damn fine beer. Glad I have a few more bottles in the cellar. Would love to crack another one open during the summer."
"D- A little too bitter sweet on the finish. Not my favorite style so no harm as I passed off my glass to someone more appreciative"
"This is my first experience from Southampton and i will certainly be back."
"do not go into this expecting a duvel, and you will enjoy this immensely."
"Taste & mouthfeel: This stuff is absolutely packed with complex fruit flavors; orange, banana, mango, melon and pear all come to mind. Spices are present underneath, with anise and coriander shining through quite strongly. Syrupy, almost cloying sweetness sticks to the tongue in the finish - this one is a bit too sweet for my taste. A hint of drying alcohol appears in the finish after the sweetness subsides."
"At the time of this review, the Grand Cru is the #1 rated Belgian strong pale, and I can see why. This is an awesome concoction, brewed with orange peel, star anise, and coriander. 750 ml cork-n-crown bottle with no freshness date, and labeled as 9.8 %. The beer pours a sedimented radiant orange hue, with very active carbonation and three inches of fluffy, off-white head that puts loads of lacing on my tulip glass. It has an irresistible, sugary sweet bouquet, fruity and peppery, with oranges, pears, and yeast - I can't stop sniffing this beer. The flavors are even better, contributing orange, peppery coriander, hints of licorice, fruits (pear?, melon?, kumquat? stone fruits?), a mild to medium bitterness and the slightest hint of alcohol. Even the mouthfeel is complex - the medium and smooth, yet prickly body imparts coating citrus flavors that last long into the finish. Final thoughts? Powerful aromas and flavors, along with skilled brewing and delicious spicing combine to provide a unique, damn tasty Belgian that almost comes across as a big, meaty tripel, but goes down so very easily. It's beers like this that prove that America has some of the best brewers on the planet."
"The booziness, spiciness, and mouthfeel make this beer a little hard to consume vigorously. Nice change of pace beer, very unique indeed. I think I might try it again."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is truly one of the most flavorful beers I have had in a long time, the thick texture and hefty alcohol content limit the drinkability, and this is best enjoyed slowly during a lazy Sunday (at least for me)"
"Poured in to my Delirium Tremens tulip. Pours a nice golden amber witha a sticky whire head. The orange peel is very apparent in the nose. Pepper and sugar are also upfront. The flavor is just the opposite. The peppery coriander and sugars used are very upfront with a sweeter finish. Pretty robust palate. I really enjoyed drinking this beer."
"Pours out clear orange with ruby hints and a thin head that reduces to lace, but sticks around the rim for quite some time. Nose is sweet and sour, with barky spices, clove, and vague citrus aromas. A bit buttery. Taste is coriander and yeast, with nice Belgian qualities. Well balanced, with light fruits coming through. Bit of alcohol and more spice on the finish. Mouthfeel is very dense, dry, and full. Good drinkability."
"A complex, tasty slow-sipper. Alcohol slows it down, though it adds warmth without interfering in the taste. A nice anise touch adds to the uniqueness of it all. Everything blends well together here. A real treat!"
"Pours orange to golden with small floating sediment. A puffy white head foams up and sticks around lengthily. Smells strong and spicy and yeasty. Hints of oranges and coriander. Orange odor is tart and slightly musty. Taste is strong and tangy. Orange rind and yeast. Spicy malt, hints of alcohol. Slight burn on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and cottony...interesting for the style. Drinks very easily. Smooth and impressive."
"Thanks very much to pelican for trading this and giving me a chance to try it. This is the best beer I've had from Southampton. Tastes like a great Belgian example, and it is beautifully balanced. Fine Job with this one. Textbook pour. Dark golden with an excellent head that sticks around. Little lacing. The aromas are nicely balanced with candi sugar up front, followed by banana, a hint of clove, and orange zest. The flavors are awesomely balanced and there is quite a bit going on in the glass. Flavors of sweet cani sugar, clove, banana, coriander, sultanas, orange, cream, star anise, and the tiniest hit of peppery spice at the end all intermingle seamlessly. Really beautiful flavors. The mouthfeel is very creamy and a bit sweet. Amazing drinkability for the abv. It is definitely a sipper, but it's drinking well right now and is not at all hot. Just a pleasure."
"I recently had the Abbott 12 and I was not a big fan, but oh man I wish I had about a dozen more of this one."
"A nice three finger off white head grows quickly and shows nice carbonation upon a strong pour. Body is a honey amber with golden tones around the edges. Solid rocky head retention and lacing as it fades. Nose is a perfect array of banana taffy, vanilla, mellon, and spicey wheat. Wow!, as you take first sip you quickly come to realize this is a very complex brew. A wonderful mix of flavors attack the palate with sweet ripe mellon, robust spicey wheat, and hints of banana and back round hops. Coean and crisp while being bold and intriguing. Alchol is scary well hidden. Off the scale drinkability. Delecious brew that deserves respect."
"I shared the bomber with my son-in-law, but could have cheerfully finished the whole thing. A great beer that I will be trying again."
"Well carbonated and fairly clean finish, a few lingering notes of tropical fruits. Fairly easy to drink but the orange peel and star anise do become a bit too much after half a bottle, thats pretty much my only complaint."
"Pours a slightly clouded gold with a sizeable white head that falls, but not too quickly. Nose is heavy with a yeast influence and a lemon edge. Flavor is tangy and sweet when it is colder. But when it is warmer, it presents a spiced strong ale. The spices peek out much more than the tang or the sugar when it is cold. Feel has a lot of bubble on the mouth, but a thicker liquid feel with a slightly slimy type of character. I know that is a weird word to use, but to me that is what it is. It is not syrupy, but it does have a different type of texture to the fluid. Overall, drinkability is high. Its a bit too tangy in my opinion, but its still another good production from Southampton."
"Porsit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"D - A very interesting beer to experience as it evolves over the course of a couple hours, great to enjoy almost as a meal on its own, rich w/ no more spice than needed. Very traditional in flavor w/ new world touches as good as many Belgians from Belgium w/ nuances you have to spend time w/ this ale to appreciate. Deserving of its' place among the greats I wouuld say 5 given the surroundings and uniqueness. Maybe a crumbly cheese on toasted pita points would go well w/ this. Definitely one of best I have tasted this year. Worthy of the purchase of a case, and truly worthy of its high rating."
"The mouthfeel is bright and yeasty with some crispness in the finish. Really nice, higher carbonation helps to accentuate the complexities rather than dull them. Lots of warmth in the finish. Well done throughout. An excellent selection."
"What an outstanding beer. A total treat"
"2004 vintage 750ml bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy amber color. It has a fine effervescence rising in it. There was a small off-white head on it. The aroma is spicy and peppery. Some sweetness coming through also. The taste is quite good. You notice a slight slickness in the body, which is somewhere between medium and full. Slightly sweet taste, with notes of the coriander and some fruits. Hint of alcohol. Very nice."
"poured very orange, a little flat for a belgian style. smelled pretty amazing - zesty yeast, orange and coriander definitely come through. Tasted great too. Really complex. Very sweet. no hops to speak of. it was really surprising to me that the top rated belgian strong pale ale is brewed in long island, but I think this one may live up to its reputation. Went great with some spicy curry."
"Overall, I really enjoy this brew. Its complex and tasty. I will grab a few of these when I get the next chance."
"Overall: Fantastic offering and a great example of the style. Perhaps a bit too syrupy but great nonetheless. Get one if you can."
"Just a bit cloying, JUST a bit, with a pop of medicine alcohol. But not enough to bring this one down. Solid brew, drinks easily. A winner."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and irresistibly creamy. Perfect carbonation level, this is a pleasure to drink. It's even refreshing at the same time with no hint of the alcohol content. This 2004 bottle has held up beautifully. Simply an amazing Belgian style Grand Cru from the masters at Southampton. I only wish I had another bottle of this vintage! Well worth seeking out."
"Thanks Joe!"
"Tastes like a burst of the regular spices you get from spiced belgians but then there's this absolutely unparalleled explosion of like fifty different fruits all kicking in in one sudden, unexpected, and exceptionally smooth burst. Jesus. There's every single fruit you can imagine in here. Apples and like pomegranate and those big green bananas that aren't quite bananas. And then all the other fruits of the rainbow. Cripes."
"The bottom line is this Grand Cru is awesome...the more I drink, the better it gets...went great with pair of goudas and salamis, particularly the peppered salami and candi tasting Ewephoria. Between this and Southampton's Saison Deluxe, they've got some of the best Belgian beers out there, period. Way better then many of their peers on either side of the pond, seek and enjoy!"
"Overall: This beer tastes good. I would drink it again of I had the chance. It might be just a bit too syrupy sweet. Thank you HimerMan for this beer. I am not one beer closer to reviewing all the top 100 beers."
"Drinkability - I love this beer! It is really an outstanding beer with well defined complexity that is extremely interesting to a beer geek. It is also so well made that I was able to give this to non beer geeks and they liked as much as I."
"Overall, another example of an excellent Belgian from this brewery, highly recommend."
"D - A tasty brew that blends the spice flavors nicely and doesn't come off as spicy as I expected."
"bottle pours redish orange the white head quickly fades , but the carbonation remains even giving it a slight tingle in the clean crisp mouthfeel . Smells of sweet , fruity, belgiian yeast . along with wonderful spices fill the nose thru the tulip that I poured it in .I start out tasting the orange sweetness followed by the spices there is a small alcohol burn in the end . Truly an execptional Ale"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Spicy nose. Flavor has a lot going on, spices, malts, hints of alcohol and a sweet, clean finish . Pricey @ $13.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"Absolutely fantastic & applying for a mortgage in amazing. A tip of my glass to Southampton for crafting such a masterpiece. It would be interesting to pair this with a fully bloomed, creamy Bleu, but my gut says Brie or Cotswold. This would hold up well with anything sweet, spicy or sweet n' spicy, as well as wild game. Just a phenomenal beer and incredibly enjoyable. I cannot recommend this highly enough. A true classic."
"Made a nice pairing with some aged Gruyere."
"It so great to have great Belgian-style breweries in the U.S. I'll definitely be looking for this beer again despite the lofty price tag."
"Taste is too sweet upfront. Some fruit and malt complexities show up: orange, apple, honey, caramel, toffee. Maybe some cinnamon if you look hard enough, but this beer is definitely lacking some spice IMO. A strong tangy sweetness lingers afterwards, which is a little too much of a good thing. A sipper, not because of the alcohol but rather the cloying tangy sweetness. Still, a good complex flavor. Nice delicate carbonation. Almost perfect for the style. The best aspect of the beer. I dont see what all the praise is about."
"Malt is sweet, but big malt is cloying, so there you have it. But it works, because it has to be thick to stand up to everything else that's going on. Complex, blended, and artful, not even a ballsy ABV can keep this from drinking like a dream. It's busy, but like a bee hive, with a real sense of meaning behind all the activity. This is a saucy, savory meal in a glass. And it makes me want seconds."
"Pours a clean deep orange color, with an off white head. In the nose, spicy notes with hints of alcohol. In the taste, dry and a bit spicy, but a nice clean end. It hides the alcohol quite well. Clean tasting, a small bit of a spicy aftertaste. A very nice beer, but be worth ageing one for a few years."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Orange in color, with a medium head that dissipates quickly. Very spicy aroma, peppery. Fruit, primarily orange, also present. Great flavor. Sweet, orange. Still very spicy and warming. Maybe some licorice flavor late. Very nice. I think the degree of spiciness, as well as the 9.5% ABV, limits the amount one would drink at one time, but still this was a wonderful beer."
"Maybe it's because I haven't had any strong belgian styles in a while, but I seriously doubt I could have more than one of these in a sitting. Palate melting."
"Incredibly drinkable for such a high abv."
"D- Theres something special about this one. Fantastic!"
"Drinkability: ABV is well concealed and if I enjoyed the spiciness, this would be a great drinker. Unfortunately, this beer just doesnt match my palate. Thats not to say that it isnt a very good beer. Im sure for some, if not most people it is. For me, however, this is not a very drinkable beer."
" Overall this was a good one to try, and if you are a fan of the style I could see why you would like this. A bit too sour for my tastes, and came off a bit too wine like. I would say give it a try as it is a more than decent offering that is obvious that alot of work when into creating."
"A very fine beer from Southampton."
"Appears the last bottle was a bit too old. This years was nice and lively. Pretty much along the same lines as Unibroue 11 or Edition 2004. Nice amounts of corriander and good yeasty flavor. Didn't really blow me away, but will adjust the rating accordingly. Don't age this one!"
"Wow, this beer really impressed me and I can in fairly skeptical. I loved the balance between sweet malt and uncommonly assertive bitterness for the style. The flavor had lemon, spice, and funky cheese-like flavors, I also got vanilla, orange in there and even some grape in the initial aroma. I'm a little amazed this. It was spendy at $12 a bottle, but still one of the best Belgian beers I've ever had. Damn, find this."
"Overall, this was one of the best Belgian ales I have had to date. With its distinctive appearance, sweet aromatics and complex flavor palate, this beer exceeded in every aspect."
"A chest full of the alcohol. Quite drinkable."
"Poured into a chalice a nice slightly cloudy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger white head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, slight hops, orange, coriander, belgium yeast, slight caramel. The taste is awesome of slightly sweet/bitter malts, slight citrus, coriander, yeasty, and slight caramel. Medium body, nice complex brew, leaves a nice warm feeling in the body. Very drinkable, love the Southampton brew's so far, highly recommended."
"Great Belgian strong pale. My first SH offering gives me a great impression of the brewery."
"Thanks for the bottle mymrngjckt!"
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a spicey bouquet which contains coriander, orange peel, and anise (although I don't really smell the anise). The Belgian yeast adds a beautiful complexity to the aroma. The scent is fruity with a bit of earthiness in it as well. The taste is great as well. This is some smooth beer especially coming in at 9.5% abv. It's pale in the malt bill and fruity in the finish. THe spices round out the taste and add a nice complexity to the flavor. THe mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's flavorful and easy drinking."
"D- It is good. There are a few flaws but other than that I really like it."
"Southampton Grand Cru is a very pleasant ale. It pours from the bottle a cloudy golden color. While there was no hint of carbonation when the cork was pulled, a very nice large head forms and sticks around for some time. The smell is richly fruity, but not overbearing. The taste is certainly spicy, with first thoughts being of lemon and grass but then it is followed up with a nice orange peel flavoring. A very nice brew worthy of picking up, if you see it. Enjoy!"
"M&D - easily palatable, but you must enjoy beers with a spice to them, chances are if your drinking this beer,then you do, a well brewed beer, im not a huge grand cru fan, but i can enjoy a good one, which this is"
"D: Im shocked and totally stunned at how good this beer is. Yes, its been a top 50 beer for a while but most of those beers arent this good. This beer wasnt even on my radar but its so far up my alley I feel like I should have saw it coming. Man is this going well with my Cajun chicken."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a golden orange with a giant white foamy head. The head lasts forever and great lacing. This is a very good looking brew. The smell is very pungent with lemon,cloves,banana, and a peppery aroma. The taste is crisp hop bitterness and a blast of alcohol. The normal Belgian spices are present along with candy sugar,corriander, and a fruity flavor. The m/f is medium with the complex flavors mixing well. This is a first class beer and this one, I believe, would be even better with a year or two of cellaring."
"Glowing hazed copper appearance with massive 3 finger head. Foam is tan and made up of large soap-like bubbles being fed from the steady carbonation below. The aroma consists of a fruity, coriander spice that dominates with some mild floral resins and potpurri in the background. The taste is very sugary and alcoholic. Lots of fruity malt with cinnamon and orange/citrus notes. The flavor and alcohol border on becoming too strong, but hold back just enough. The mouthfeel is not thick, however the very foamy carbonation creates a rich mouthfeel that coats pretty well. This is a solid Belgian Strong, perhaps not deep enough in its complexity, but rich and tasty nonetheless..."
"966"
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and cage bottle. The color is a hazy orange copper color with a huge egg shell head that dissipated slowly to a slight cap which left some chunk lacing. The smell is quite strong, big orange peel, corriander, sweet. The taste is much the same, very flavorful, orange peel, corriander, peppery, some malt, sweet, boozy. The mouthfeel is moderate and fizzy, slick. I wish I was more of a fan of orange peel. If I was, this beer would be getting some 5 ratings. This beer has some nice complexities to it. It tastes like a malty Belgian white ale."
"Beer like this makes me glad to be alive. This is one of the best BSPAs that I've ever had, no matter the country of origin. Sometimes I sit and marvel at the complexity in each mouthful, and sometimes I simply enjoy what's happening to my taste buds. It's only January, but it's going to be hard for any brewer to top the sheer brilliance of Southampton Grand Cru during the remainder of 2007."
"drinkability: good"
"Fairly light for a Belgian strong pale, but that doesnt detract. Theres a nice mixture of spicy and hoppy flavors here that cant be completely pinned on hops or spices. The malt serves as a blank canvas for the interplay of these other flavors, but is substantial enough to balance the beer. The hop character is prominent, but with soft edges. An Interesting and enjoyable ale."
"I might like this beer more if the spice was toned down, perhaps with age this will be curbed somewhat. A full 750 was too much to take at once, perhaps best split with a few friends it would make for an interesting sampling. I will say it was well done and quite complex, but it's really not my bag, baby."
"Received in a semi-recent trade from ???"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. 9.8% ABV on bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"This beer pours a wonderfully hazy golden color with a huge head (if you're not careful...). The basic smell is of sour yeast and a mostly zesty presence. The taste is terrific, with tongue that is congruent with that of a Tripel, but less assuming. I would call it mild, and the subtleties are what make it stand out. The sour yeast taste is still apparent, but its accompanied by an almost honey-like sweetness which makes it incredibly easy while going down. There are also spices, such as coriander and orange that are easy to pick out. The finish is sweet and leaves much to be desired, but of course this subsides when the next gulp goes down. This is a beer that is well worth seeking out... Enjoy!"
"Overall this is a decent interpretation of a grand cru. It has a plethera of flavor, with a nice aroma. But the carbonation seems high, plus this might be an old bottle the cork broke with no effort."
"Pours honey orange in color, slightly hazy with a good size white head that recedes slowly and laces fairly heavily. Aroma is strong of coriander, behind this there is a delicate sweetness, like a fresh cream that mixes with the orange is reminiscent of an orange push-up. Taste follows the aroma with a strong and lingering coriander presence with a nice subtle creamy sweetness to balance it. Honey and oranges. There is some alcohol and a burnt rubber bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel shows some spiciness in the finish although it is quite smooth and soft thru the beginning and middle. The alcohol is fairly well hidden for nearly 10% but warms and bites just the right amount in the finish. Very much like a strong belgian wit, easy to drink a 750 even at this strength I keep coming back for more. Spices are well balanced by the soft sweetness, mouthfeel is outstanding."
"Really, one of the best examples of its style I have ever had and stands shoulder to shoulder with the Rodenbacher. Truth be told, I think I prefer the Southampton."
"Beautiful amber/gold colour with a pillowy white head. Aromas are of plum, pear, honey, and spices. Taste is fruity, with a malty and yeasty backbone, subtle spices. Fullbodied feel without being heavy or cloying, impeccable balance. This was a killer choice for Turkey-day."
"Pours a hazy amber, huge thick white head forms, tons of lace all over, head never leaves, very sticky. Smell is complex, sweet and spicy, yeast, apples and citrus, alcohol, reminds me of the Allagash yeast strain. Taste is sweet, citrus, yeast and spice through the middle, apples and pears in the finish, light alcohol, pleasant warming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, dances around, made me feel good. Definately a nice Belgian style. Thanks for sharing grub!!"
"D: The big abv is limiting, as the ale really packs a wallop, but the depth of flavor is wonderful. It definitely could use a few more years in the cellar."
"This beer was almost unfathomably spotless. Quite a treat, thanks again Russ."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hopdog): Poured an orangey color ale with a small bubbly head with limited retention. Aroma of orange is quite intense with something sweet that didnt mix very well with the beer. Taste is like a mix between an orange crush and an average Belgian ale and was not really what I expected from this beer. The flavour doesnt really mix well and body was quite thin. I was expecting to be impressed by this beer based on previous rating but I am now wondering if I totally missed something or if this was a bad bottle. This was definitely one of the worst offerings that I had the chance to try form this usually fine brewery."
"drinkability is good. really tasty and well balanced."
"Mouthfeel is is of a doughy, spicy, sugary goodness that melds into a medium bodied treat bouncing along the palate with a perfect amount of carbonation."
"Too drinkable. I declare it illegal. Believe the hype."
"Still, all in all quite a nice brew... although I will usually be able to find other brews I like just as much for less than $13."
"Slightly hazy orange/caramel colour with a bit of rocky, nearly white head that settled to a thin skim. Thick solid lace with decent retention. Sweet, fruity aroma with distinctive clove spiciness. Maybe a bit of pepper and anise. Sweetness in the flavour really brings out the spiciness - coriander and anise are prominent. There's a light orange citrus quality as well. Light alcohol and warmth in the off-dry finish. Full bodied with carbonation on the light side, making it seem a bit heavy. Very nice. I'll be putting a couple bottles of this away to see how it ages."
"Nose is is a miasma of scents, spicy yeasts, caramelly sweetness, light fruitiness, some mustiness lurking as well. Taste starts with the sweeteness, but quickly the spices seem to tickle the taste buds one by one, increasing in intensity. Close has a citrus zest to it, and a light alcohol warmth is the parting blow. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. This recipe hasn't lost anything in the past couple batches."
"Pours a musty golden orange with about a half-inch of off-white foam. Moderate retention, fine lacing around the glass. Smells of banana bread and clove. Taste is similar, yeasty banana spiced with coriander and pepper. Good amount of carbonation. Light body, smooth start to finish. Moderate drinkability; however, I did have this late in the evening, so its difficult to judge. Nothing spectacular stands out, but very good overall."
"A fantastic beer. This is definitly one to take your time and enjoy. This wouldn't exactly fit with any food specifically, but would be a perfect beer to enjoy with a bitter cigar on a nice relaxing evening outside near a fire. A very fine offering from a nice brewer."
"I'm glad that I bought this bottle. In the past, I'd had some negative experiances with corks from SouthHampton. This bottle had signs of slight leakage from the cork, but did not exhibit any off flavors. Even though it is $12.50, I'd buy it agian."
"Strange note: The front label says it was brewed and bottled in Royersford, PA even thought the back label states ""Brewery and Restaurant in Southampton, NY"". Guess that's why it's becoming more widely distributed."
"good drinkability, but it is a sipper with it's high, but well masked abv, and reasonably balanced sweetness. this was really pleasant surprise."
"Belgian Strong Pale is not my most favorite style, but I have to admit that this is exceptional. Deep and fruity, with a thunderous sweetness that lingers... until a final little snap of hops closes every sip. How nice to have a beer that can stay with you from the beginning to the end of your evening."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff and having several glasses of this is a no-brainer. Great beer here."
"Overall a great beer, though a little green IMO. I see this one maturing over the next few years to become quite a fantastic brew once all these components meld together. I can't wait !"
"Every time I thought there was something that was bothersome another element came into play to slap it down or build it up. Probably the maltiest version of this style I've had and I think it worked."
"the aroma is the best part, for its complexity, and while it's a nice brew the 9.5% precludes a higher score for drinkability"
"Overall: Wow, an excellent Belgian Ale with a nice strong spicy character that's balanced well by bready and fruity sweetness."
"This pours a light copper color, slightly orange, slightly golden, very clear. Some nice head, and some very nice lacing. Smells citrusy, zesty, and some definite spicyness in there. Very Hennepin-like. Taste is also citrusy and bready, and again spicy. Too spicy. Overload of corriander and black pepper, just way too much. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, and thin. For the alcohol content, it's pretty sneaky, but it's too sweet and way too spiced up. And the mouthfeel is kind of unpleasant. Better than the last time I had it, but it still disappoints."
"an overwhelming sweetness in the flavor, with notes of raisins, oranges and alcohol. gentle carbonation and a medium-light, smooth feel. high sweetness and alcohol notes limit the drinkability."
"I really did enjoy this beer. Definitely one to sip and enjoy."
"Pours a sparkling dark orange that leaves a bubbly body foggy and inviting that has a clingy tan head. The nose is candied orange, wheat, grass, lemon peel, honey, tartness, fresh spicy hop aroma that is elegant and delightful. The taste starts malty, candy fruit, citrus rind bitterness that is rounded out by a clean palate cleansing from the carbonation. The finish is bitter and slightly boozy but that alcohal is smooth a little rough but it is quickly offset by the fruit backbone making this is a phenominal ale one of the best I've had the pleasure of having."
"Overall, an excellent American beer in a Belgian style. The alcoholic hotness does not detract from the overall enjoyment I got from this beer. Complex, tasty... a winning brew, no question about it. I'd love to see how this tastes in 5 years."
"750 ml corked bottle. The beer is an effervescent and slightly cloudy light-orange colored brew. Topped with a thick and puffy white head, this is a brilliantly attractive brew (the lacing is incredible). The aroma is of citrus, spice, and yeast. Theres a fresh bread quality thats expanded on by orange and coriander. I also swear that I can smell honey, apples, and some funky yeasty wildness. The taste is equally as intriguing. It starts with a light sweetness, followed immediately by a pleasant alcohol warming and the spice complexity. Theres a quiet caramel and roasted grain flavor that also creeps into the taste that seemed to be missing from the aroma. Nice spritzy carbonation. At first, because of the carbonation and aroma, the beer gives the sensation of lightness, in fact, this is a quite full bodied brew. It dries out by the finish, which is flavorful and long lasting. Wonderful."
"I nearly finished off the 750ml by myself before I had dinner and I also thought this would be peer to my favorite on draft."
"This ones amazingly easy to drink for the complexity and carbonation. Fantastic!"
"Slightly coarse mouthfeel, this ale is almost saison like, with its barnyard funk flavors. Definitely spiced, with the orange and anise apparent. Some notes of hot alcohol are present midsip with faint notes of nutty sherry. Finish is syrupy sweet with notes of honey and a drying sensation."
"The taste from the last 3rd of the bottle was still ""sweet n sour"" but the balance was much improved and...that boosted the drinkablity factor as well. I definitely would try this one again!"
"A refreshing brew, but it seems as though it would be best paired with something."
"Beer is good. Happy big Belgian style beering."
"Drinkability: Not more than a couple glasses in a sitting. Alcohol and sweetness/tartness holds you back."
"I am not quite too sure what I was expecting from this beer, but it is quite a nice end to an Christmas day of overeating and stuffing myself. This beer has a certain richness to it (in both the sweetness and the earthy spiciness) that is quite nice and fulfilling. There is a hint of tartness to this beer, and if there is one complaint it is that this beer could use a bit more tartness; the level provided by some aged Fantome's would be classic. This beer is quite enjoyable, though I was perhaps expecting a bit more complexity and depth here."
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus with some hints of sourness - interesting. The flavor has a lot of tartness as well as a lot of citrus with some hints of the alcohol. There also some spices in there. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is moderate as well. The tartness detracts in my opinion."
"Drinkable, but not a session beer by any means. Like most Southampthon beers it has a very different and unique taste. At 9.5% abv it is tough to have more then 2 of these."
"Believe this is the 2004 vintage. Pours a deep coppery color with a light patchy head. Nose is very interesting. I get big notes of orange and lemon. Lots of orange and vanilla notes. As it warms, it gets a lot better in my opinion. I would guess it to be sweet Very light puff of alcohol as well. Flavor is very nice and tart. Big blast of lemon with a thick sugary sweetness behind it. Again...no hint of the alcohol. Nice and thick beer here. Almost syrupy. No real carbonation on this one. Overall, this is a highly drinkable beer. Enjoyable brew. Very happy to have tried it."
"750 ml bottle, 2005 vintage. Hazy golden brown with a large creamy white head. Grapes, yeast, and tartness on the nose. Flavor is a bit tart, with apricots, banana, some cookie, and vanilla. Spices become evident as fruitiness gives over to a some coriander, white pepper, and orange zest. Full bodied with a spicy/sweet finish. Awesome brew."
"Cork and Caged bottle that came to me as part of a fantastic trade with Twilight. After the cork comes out with a little persuasion, this beer pours a hazy brown/prange color, head is very small, but good retention. The smell only reflects what the flavor confirms, that this beer needs age. The orange peel and spice give this beer a (although not unpleasent) sour orange juice flavor. Alcohol is very noticable, goes well with the spices. This beer is still to fresh for me, I think a year or two and it would be sublime."
"I did not want a second glass of this."
"Get some MF!"
"Great beer. Deeply flavored and rich with the sweetness and coriander almost being a bit too much for my taste."
"Overall: This beer is definitely good, but I don't know about grand cru. I'm also kind of mystified at the ratings it has gotten. I was expecting much more. The fact that it is so sweet, combined with a light body with no carbonation is kind of aggravating. It's good, and gets better as it warms, but still. I thought Stonecrusher's review was perfect when he said that this is definitely a complex beer with a bunch of flavor, but none of them really all that delicous. This seemed similar to the unibroue 10 to me but I felt the unibroue was better."
"The mouthfeel is thin, and the carbonation is light to moderate. I would argue that the distinctness of the fruity elements and the lingering spiciness offset the thin mouthfeel, leading to only moderately drinkability. Each sip is packed with flavor, so although one could certainly down this as you would your run-of-the-mill pale ale, theres certainly no good reason not to sip this as you would any big beer. The spiciness triumphs over the alcohol, masking it spectacularly, but also showcasing the warmth of its background presence. Dont listen to OldSock. Hes crazy."
"Drinkability and Notes  Big and complex, but still relatively easy to drink. This is one of the best American made Belgian style ales, but cannot compare to the many fine strong pales ales made in Belgium or many of the offerings from Unibroue. This vintage, in my eyes, does not deserve the status that this beer has received."
"Taste: Starts off very candi sugar sweet, then it gets even sweeter somehow, than a bit salty and almost peaty, a splash of funk gets into the mix, alcohol not noticeable in the mouthfeel but definately feels warm and fuzzy in my gullet. It blew me away."
"Overall: Wow. This is my first ""real"" Southampton brew outside of the contract-brewed new bombers, and it's easy to see what the hype is all about. This is just an incredible beer that hits on every level. Damn near perfect."
"It's like there's a party in my mouth, and everyone's invited. It had more of a fruity smell than I'd prefer, but the taste and subsequent intoxication more than made up for it. This is the first Belgian Strong Pale Ale I've had, but you know for damn sure it wont be the last. I drank it while watching the Kentucky Derby, I figure if I'm watching the sport of kings I might as well drink like one and the Southampton Grand Cru delivered."
"A cloudy dark amber/copper beer. With no head. Appearance reminded me of hand pressed apple cider. The aroma was sweet with honey and fruit notes. Also there was a spicey hop presence. All this with an inviting alcohol background. There was a honey like mouthfeel. The flavor a fruit sweetness with an orange peel character. The finish had a nice spicey hop flavor with a nice ""warm in the tummmy"" alcohol goodby."
"overall excellent for an american brewery"
"Yum, yum, yum. I could drink this all night, but I have a feeling I'd have a very rough morning if I did. This beer is way too smooth for its potency. This is the first Southampton brew I've had, and I'm definitely impressed so far."
"This poured into the goblet a dark cloudy orange with a decent sized fluffy white head forming on top. Minimal lacing was left around the glass as the head died down. Aroma is full of fruity esters with notes of apples and pears over a variety of spices. A touch of sweetness and yeast round out the smell, which is great. Flavor starts off with fruity apples with a backing of spiciness, some coriander and orange peel I believe. Notes of other fruits are present. Its a bit sweet and tart but never too much of either. The fruit and spice carry the flavor nicely. Body is medium effervescent, crisp and refreshing. I can hardly believe this is 9.5 this drinks like a much lighter beer and is so damn enjoyable. I would love to get my hands on some that is fresher to see the difference. I believe this bottle was nearing a year old. Thanks goes to Steve for the hook up."
"Super many thanks and good wishes for an amazing Christmas time trade from FeloniusPhil for this beer!!!"
"Poured a hazy yellow orange color with a medium sized off white head, and light lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet orange, citrus, and musty yeast. Taste was very nice, spicy vanilla oak, sweet caramel, lots of citrus fruits, yeast, and just a hint of alcohol."
"Supremely Impressive and Highly Recommended."
"A second bottle, acquired from Buffalo (the first was from Poughkeepsie), was completely different. A raging sourness obscured the sublte, creamy richness and made it a much slower drink of only academic interest. I've changed the ""taste"" score to reflect the combined experiences."
"Exceptional beer 2003. Surprising grand cru with bold spice. Good carbonation, full mouthfeel. Must be consumed with food. Lots of spice: cloves, cinammon, licorice anise, corriander and hops and malt for balance. Also the orange and tropical fruit and candy sugar cream in yeast. Like an American over-the-top Fantome. And that's some compliment."
"Thank you Paul Davis of Troutbrook Brewing for sharing this beautiful beer. It pours a slightly hazy amber color with a rich white head. Aroma is sweet and bready with a good deal of ripe fruit and spice. Mmmmm. Starts with a bit of sour, musty Belgian yeast flavor that gives way to tropical fruits and exotic spice. The spice is perfectly subtle(corriander, cardamon, cloves), some spiced beers are too intense. Finishes with an unexpected nip of hops. Nice, a great beer all the way!"
"So. Like I said. Review over. Time to float down the canals of the soul's last refuge and best respose..."
"Taste - this is a delicious beer, sweet/malty, light on the spices, candy like, Delicious. Finally a Southampton product that I tried that warrants the compliments."
"Heavy flavor and hearty alcohol! Two trademarks of many quality Belgian or Belgian-inspired ales. Definitely to be found here. Orange liqueor and vodka honeydew with a splash of pineapple from a can. Syupy -- but only in the Karo LIGHT vein. A slight plant bitterness helps this avoid being rock candy sweet. A spectacular wedding gift from some damn good BAs and friends. Superb in every way."
"Cloudy amber, light and sticky off-white head is very nice for the strenght. Unique malty aroma of orange, toasted malt, grahma cookies, plain oat, coriander, bread dough yeast, curacao etc. Very interesting although Id have hoped for more intensity. Nice complex belgian style palate, peppery, mostly dry. Faint creamy lactic component. Curacao leads to a pleasant fruity bitterness. Light grapefruit lingers for a while in the superb aftertaste. Very yeasty yet even more balanced. Usual Southampton creamy mouthfeel, full bodied, extremely smooth despite the rather high carbonation. Nice beer, sure thing."
"This is a work of uncommon artistry. I drank Southamptons Grand Cru on a sailboat at sunset and have rarely enjoyed a beer so much."
"Lovely, perfectly-balanced, simply excuisite and flawless brew. Notes of orange peel, anise, coriander are balanced perfectly by a caramel, dough and toffee maltiness."
"This was the toughest bottle I have ever fought with... the cork just would not come out! 2004 bottling. Tropical fruit sweetish nose with corriander notes in the sinus. Wonderful peach look in the goblet with lots of little bubbles and a nice lasting, sticky, thickish white head and lace. Wow what a taste of regal malt and tropical sweetness. Lots of lip smackin' sweet orange/cinnamon/corriander/caramel. Very viscous thick comforting silky mouthfeel. Very smooth.. and very, very drinkable.. it just slides down lovingly. A beer which is a work of art."
"Comments  Thanks to Davo for sending this one out my way. I split this up with a few BAs at the first annual Fright Night extravaganza."
"Pours a lightly hazed medium amber. Large thick off-white head of foam settles out in to a sheet of lace that stays with the brew. Smells very grassy, yeasty and citrusy. Great smelling and so pretty in the glass.The taste is out of this world. I've never been to belgium, but this fits the picture in my mind of what a ""real"" belgian beer should taste like if the monks brought it down to me personally. The lightest most delicate malt taste passes over your tounge, followed by a slightly tart citrus wave of lemon and orange. Finishes slightly dry without the slightest hint of alcohol. However, my head knows it's there. Mouthfeel is moderate and in perfect proportion with the flavors of this beer. You could drink a lot of this and get in heaps of trouble fast. This is a must drink. If you see it and pass it up it's your loss."
"The cork did not burst out with a pop as I thought it would with a champagne cork. The cork had a great smell of pineapple juice. Bright orange color with tight small bubbles and a wonderful nose of pineapples, honey and a yeasty sweetness. This is an exceptional beer. Rich, thick, and oh so soft and creamy. The alcohol was evident but does not overpower the great tastes. The spices are so subtle but that does not matter. This has to be the best American Belgian-style beer. Got it at the American Beer Distributing Company, Inc in Brooklyn."
"Light copper with a good head. The aroma is slightly tart with a hint of bandaids. This is also a pretty herbal and earthy aroma. The slight tartness continues into the flavor along with a good bit of citrus fruit and peach turning the bandaids into something pleasant when its hard to imagine them being such."
"Overall: My favorite beer from Southampton, bar none (which is saying a lot, as these guys keep cranking out the quality brews). This sets the standard for the style. I feel it is the equivalent to a California (or Long Island, as it were!) sparkling wine outclassing anything from the actual Champagne region of France. Hard for me to rate a beer perfect, but"
"Thanks to Davo."
"2004. This is a real Belgian with lots of intricate and definitive spiciness--orange, corriander, even anise--but unlike most of the strong ales, there something understated about this superb, delicate brew. It pours a dark, slightly cloudy gold with a fine sticky lace. The aroma is sweet and piney, and the taste is exquisitely balanced. The carbonation is smoothly thin and perfectly appropriate for the mediummothfeel. This is one lovely offering, but note: very potent though you would not notice it right off the bat."
"Appearnace is a basic golden amber color, with a good head that leaves patchy lace and a very even top after receding. Smell is very interesting. The main smell is a cross between rubber and fresh cut live wood. There's also a small grapy smell, and some hop hints. Taste is quite sweet, but it mellows so quickly that beyond the first bit of sweet, it is quite good. Its a thick taste probably because its got so much alcohol, with some fruity tastes, but they seem dulled down by a meaty salty taste too, interstingly. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, but medium in body. This is quite a good beer."
"This stuff is a monumental acheivement in brewing. Pours a serious shade of golden amber, shimmers and quakes with strength and vitality. A strong surge of flavor, boldness and complexity greats the tongue. No doubt about the quality of this lordly creation. Went great with a crab cake. This is a powerful sipper. Seek this one out and savor."
"Nice looking copper appearance capped with a thick, frothy dirty white head. Retention is outstanding. Lacing is moderate and droopy in form. CO2 bubbles stream to the surface at a moderate to somewhat quick pace. Nice nose of sweet orange, must, bready yeast, dry corriander and hayfields. The taste follows through with the breadiness and sweet orange. But there's also a great spiciness to the flavor. Alcohol spiciness. Black pepper spiciness. Corriander-like spiciness. Alcohol is apparant, but incorporated nicely into the overall structure of this beer. This beer has the type of bready, yeasty flavor that I love in Belgian style beers. Oh yeah, this one's nice."
"A strong ale of nice design. If again, I would age this beer less to aid its pungent array of possible complexities. Regardless, this drank like a sweet, citrus, and simple pleaser. Hard pressed to think of many better ales similar to it."
"This is a gorgeous beer. Thanks to herbjones for sharing. I thorooughly enjoyed this beer. Opaque golden color, sweet aroma with a complex fruity flavors on the tongue. In my opinion, it was absolutely a phenomenally well made brew. It was luxurious. You could sit back and enjoy it for a long time."
"Incredibly drinkable and well worth seeking out. Call in your favors and get your hands on a bottle, but do not share it, savor it all yourself!"
"This wonderful beer was a lovely clear golden colour, with a fluffy, big, white head. The aromas were sweet and consited of belgian candi sugar, yeast, various types of roasted malts, some very, very, background hops, fruit, spices, and more! The taste was a wonderful melange of spicy fruit flavors, as well as a tiny bit of alcohol flavor, malty goodness, and yeasty abandonment. The mouthfeel was very fine, with tiny bubbles gripping to the surface of my tongue, taking each and every taste-bud on a magical carpet-ride to never-never land! The drinkability is excellent for a grand cru, and many other breweries could learn a thing or two from this brewery that is churning out such drinkable versions of very hard-to-perfect styles. The East Coast Alesmith perhaps? I'll have to try some more of their brews to know for sure. But for now, I am glad that I am not a ""virgin"" of Phil Markowskis brews anymore!"
"It's a peachy golden nectar with a heavy, creamy head. The aroma of applesauce, spicy yeasts, vanilla, and an abundance of other spices. The flavor follows along with an incredible sweet fruit flavor (peaches,pears) spicy yeast and marshmellows. It's a verrry drinkable medium body with nice carbonation. The flavors are hard to put to words but this beer is not hard to put to mouth. My rec is go get this beer and let it do it's magic."
"A most impressive brew! Its lush flavors are delivered within a perfect mouthfeel. Extremely well done. and absolutely worth seeking out! This beer rivals some of the top Belgain ales!"
"I have yet to be disappointed by any Phil Markowski brew. I wish we all had access to his brews!!"
"Overall this was a wonderful find and well worth the nearly $10 for the bottle. My friend Geoff who does not like most of the beers I tried said he would drink this all day long. A ringing endorsment in my world. This is by far the easiest drinking high ABV beer I have come across and this solidifies my love for the Grand Cru style. I am immediatly going to go back and buy a couple more and cellar them for the Rochester winter."
