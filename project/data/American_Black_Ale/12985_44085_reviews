"Overall - Totally disappointing. As well as Wookey Jack represents the style, Dogzilla represents poorly."

"O- very disappointed, Total wine BA score is a lie because it rated it as a 93, and for $3.99 for a pint, I thought this would be a steal, was definitely the opposite."

"I think everyone is rating this as an IPA. It definitely isn't that. It tastes more like a light stout. Pours dark. Not quit pitch black, but very dark brown. No clarity at all. Small head that doesn't really last. Virtually no lacing. Has a roasted almost sweet smell. Maybe chocolate? Maybe caramel? The smell is the best quality. Dark, malty up front taste with a moderately bitter roasted aftertaste. Again, maybe chocolate? Sweet. Could be raisins? There a dark fruity taste. Virtually no bitterness from hops. It is lacking balance. Not bad but would buy many other beers before this one. Wouldn't ever turn it down, though."

"On tap to a tulip glass. Pours deep black with minimal head and lacing. Smell was decent but nothing really popped to me to be honest. Taste was minimally hoppy with a bit of smoke malt. Very drinkable but wish it was a bit more hoppy. Mouthfeel was a bit thin to be honest. Overall it was okay although I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"I was really looking forward to opening this, got to say I'm a little let down by it on a few levels. Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a stemmed glass, wonderful dark brown but with no head...only clear bubbles around the glass. Smell of rum soaked raisins and a faint chemical hint...possibly the sweet smell of anti-freeze (smell NOT taste!) was present. The taste started out bitter and flat...bitter is fine but the flat was like a true old style Porter...this is not a Porter so it didn't settle well, alcohol and some hops bitterness are about the only flavors..mouthfeel is medium but seems to start out thin and then settles medium on the tongue. As a side note as you drink this the hops come out in the aftertaste...I've had a few Black IPA's and this is not among the good ones. Overall I think maybe this might be infected because I've read reviews about massive foam...and some with the clear bubbles that I had...either way it's not what I want in a Black IPA...or any beer for that matter...might try it again if the price is right."

"Medium bodied and, strange considering the pouring explosion, not overly carbonated, just medium for the style. All told, it isn't a drain pour, but the thought did cross my mind. Here's hoping it's just a bad bottle, but I doubt I'll have this one again."

"2nd afterthought: this just may be infected. extremely volatile... but nice head!! wish I could get some head this good!!"

"The beer looks like coca-cola without the fizz. It smells of chocolate (which isn't a bad thing, but not really my thing). But the taste. Oh god the taste. It doesn't work. The chocolate stout notes don't mesh well with the light citrus/pine notes. It's not a terrible beer, but it's not a good beer either."
""
"The rest was used to cook food. I expect way more from Laughing Dog than laughs at this attempt at mockery."
""
""
""
"O - I cannot believe how bad this is, the smell and taste is so far off-target from where it should be. I dont know where these weird flavors come from, but Laughing Dog, do yourself a favor and dump this recipe down the drain with the rest of this beer."

"Overall - Yeah, a completely and unquestionable infected bottle. A certain candidate for a future re-review, but I have to admit I sort of enjoy this. Can a Belgian Black IPA be that far off? Are they already being made?"

"22 ounce bottle killer label of the Dogzilla attacking the town, simcoe and cascade in a black IPA from Idaho man are we getting progressive, did I mention I purchased this in West Virginia, holy shit what's going on? The body is pitch Black with a light beige head almost white, I've never seen a head this light in a beer this dark. Aromatics are giving off citrus and spicy notes almost a cinnamon like character if I had to describe it any further. The first sips carries that black roast blended with high alpha acid hops rather nicely, drinks like a highly carbonated schwarzbier with more hop pellet kick than most of them out there, the spicy characteristic is nice and would blend great with the Kristoff Sumatran wrapped cigar I'm about to light up. Light dark chocolate herbal mint, spicy hops, mild citrus twang but really ends up as a nice spicy schwarzbier more than a black IPA. Mouthfeel is medium at best with ample flowing carbonation a layer of spice and hop bitterness is left on the palate between sips. Overall a beer that I will drink sparingly not the one I wanted compared to other big dark beers out there, I'm glad the alcohol is not over the top it's well hidden and barely a factor in this big beast of a 22 ounce beer."
"Oh, no, they say he's got to go... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear midnight garnet topped by over a finger of wan off-cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, anise, pine needles, spearmint, and cinnamon. Odd as it may sound, this thing smells like certain Christmas cookies I've had in my day, almost like a gingerbread man with peppermint buttons who happened to have been left on the baking pan a bit too long, blackening the backside a bit. Here, it's not quite what I'm looking for, and luckily not entirely offensive, especially considering that the mint gets stronger as time progresses. The taste brings in more of the same, though that minty character is now nearly absent until the finish, the roast is darker and more bitter, and the pine asserts itself a great deal more. Unfortunately, everything is in competition with everything else, precluding any chance of flavor harmony. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a fairly smooth feel, and a drying finish. Overall, this black IPA just didn't sit right with me, what with the chaotic nature of the flavors."

"O: Decent Black IPA, definitely piney on the hops, with a decent dark coffee/caramel malt backbone. Neither quality overwhelms. Not a Black IPA I'd choose to revisit but it is relatively good."
""
""
""
""
""
"It’s got some flavors but most of them are undesirable flavors. If you want to try it, then try it, but it probably won’t be a beer that you try twice."
""
""
""
"Overall it's ok but not outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had other Laughing Dog beers I loved but this black IPA tasted strange and off. I would try again only if bottled fresh or from a tap."
"-Finishing taste is almost like sarasparilla, that with the carbonation adding to the rootbeer experience."
"O - It is a flavorful beer, but that citrus and orange presence just reminds me of cleaning products. It is kind of a turn off."
"overall - unfortunately, misses the mark. disappointing."

"Picked this up recently as I had tried several black IPAs during the craze a few years ago and liked them( mostly). Packaging caught my eye also and looked forward to trying this bomber. The beer poured a dark reddish color into a pint glass with a prodigious head of lumpy ochre foam, creating a sticky mess in the kitchen. Aroma of roasty malt and citrus was somewhat promising. The taste was overly bitter even for a west coast ipa,enthusiast. Very hard to finish although it improved as it warmed. Overall not a beer I would recommend."

"O: This beer seems to be overcarbonated and requires a very careful pour. Nothing really stands out to me about the smell or tasted compared to other beers in the style."

"All in all, Dogzilla is a worthy journey into the CDA/BIPA style; perhaps not the most assertive example, but sufficiently complex and well-crafted to put a smile on the face of the beer drinker that likes dark, earthy beers. The kind that make us Californians want to move to the Northwest..."
""
"I picked this up based soley on my recently discovered affection for Black IPA's. After reading some of the other reviews I was really apprehensive! I am pleased to report my experience was 100% enjoyable! This brew poured with the expected dark color, and had a pleasent, roasted nut scent. The taste was smooth and went down easy. I would visit this dog-pen again!!!!"
"The taste is better than average for sure. Loads of dry roasted malt. The hops have a great aroma and slick feeling. The dark chocolate works pretty well with the slick citrus fruits. Theres just enough punch from the hops. the bitterness from the malt just gets compounded by the bitter hop extract oils."
""

"22 oz. bottle to a pint glass. I was really excited to try this one because of the spiffy name and awesome artwork. Honestly, I should've just taken a picture of the bottle, because it was all downhill once I opened it. First of all, the head was HUGE! It would almost be more appropriate to measure it in hands instead of fingers. The color was almost jet black and the smell was floral and hoppy, but smelled oddly dank (for lack of a better term). The taste was NOT GOOD. Burnt, but not roasty like you expect from dark malts, and although it smelled floral, it tasted really bitter (not floral) and finished even worse. Also, it was too dry and reminded me of a really cheap cabernet. Stay away, there are better BIPAs out there."
""
""
""
"This beer is way over-carbonated. I couldn't drink it out of a glass because the enormous head never settled. I had to drink most of it from the bottle. The carbonation hit my mouth like an explosion and was not pleasant. But this wasn't the worst part of the beer. The beer finishes with an awful, medicinal taste that lingers in the mouth. The nauseating taste stayed with me long after I drank the beer. I definitely won't drink this beer again!"

"Overall: Laughing dog brewery if you read this retire this beer, you and I both know you have come out with much better than this. Still you can give it a try might be worth your while, definitely not mine...Salud!"
"So on the whole, I'd say its worth a shot."
""
""
""
"I liked it, but it was unbalanced and took me for a ride, which is fun too."
"This beer pour a dark brown color with a trace of tan head. The aroma is very strong with grapefruit hoppiness. The taste starts with that strong fruity and citrusy hops and then donates with some malty sweetness. The overall taste impression is very sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh and overcarbonated. Overall though a very interesting beer and definitely worth a try."

"O - While I'd probably drink more of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous, I think this is a an easier drinking alternative due to the fact that's it's far less sweet, has a thinner body, and more bright hop characteristics. So overall I think this is a pretty good Black IPA. Cheers!"
"The taste is has the distinct flavors of pine, bark, lemon, raw cocoa beans with a punch of sharp bitterness at the end. It's simple yet complex. The body is medium-full but feels light in the mouth. Not too bad, a no fuss BIPA."
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but it doesn't necessarily measure up to other beers of the style."
"O - I liked the citrus hops used but found all the dark malts of be a little to much for this style in my opinion, however, they did work well for this beer. I could have used more hops in its flavor and smell but thought this was still worth the $5.59 I paid for the 22oz."

""

""
"O: OK. Becomes more bitter on the last pour. Grassy, pine needle-like bitterness over roast. Not juicy or containing the chocolate malt sweetness that I like for this style."
"22oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""

"A disappointing but perfectly adequate bottle--expecting more from a Godzilla reference beer. Not big enough to fill those shoes."
""
"Overall - Not very good. I drain poured this one, its not worth the calories."
""
"Chestnut colored ale with tall rocky and persistent head. Aroma is moderately malty, toasted - caramel, moderate citrusy hops, moderate to heavy bready notes and strangely enough some yeast. Flavor is moderately sweet and moderately hoppy, long bitter finish. Body is thin, texture is watery, soft carbonation. Not bad."
""
"D - Not very good, it is lacking in hop character and there is a medicinal character that us really off putting. I an almost inclined to think it is infected, but based on other reviews it seems that this beer just tastes kind of off."
"My first dark ipa."
""
"M: Medium bodied."
"It was unlike any of the other american black ales that I have tried, and it just wasn't for me. If you are looking for a beer that nearly defies category, this is it."
""
"Drinkability - I just want to be done with this one, a rare statement for me and a beer, even an infected one. I can try it again, but I don't recall ths being that old sample. I'll track it down once more for posterity and see if I can get a good sample in order to fix up these scores."

"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Big fluffy white head, pours a rootbeer amber. Aroma is dark roasted malts with some spicy hops and a little skunk. Taste has some toffee and citrus, but a lot of sourness (in a bad way). Mouthfeel is very thin and wet. I'm a big fan of the American Black Ale style, but this is not one of the better examples."
""

"O --- it's a nice beer, but weak compared to the other Black IPAs available in the market"
""
"Poured into an imperial nonic a deep chocolate brown with some real ruby tinint,a 1/2 finger tannish colored head atop that was gone pretty quickly.Sharp piney hop notes along with dark roast at the onset,dark molasses sweetness is light,pretty average for the style.Sharp and thinner in the mouth takes away from the flavors in my opinion,piney hops dominate with mild sweetness,a little raw earthiness in the finish.Not a very good example of the style in my opinion,it lacks body and flavor complxity,still I do like most of Laughind Dog's wares."
"O - Nice example of a black AIPA. Surprised about the negative to blah reviews here. I enjoyed this beer and wouldn't mind having it again."
""
""
"Not my fav of the Black IPAs but pretty good. I let it warm some out of the fridge and then with a fairly agressive pour got a nice, fluffy, foamy, billowy thick, cream to light tan colored head that slowly subsided and some lace. Color is a lovely, clear shad of red brown with some nicely flowing bubble trails. Aroma is an interesting blend of roast, malt, dark ripe fruit, licorice, toffee, citrus, lumber. Flavor is very similar to nose, almost brut dry, with hops against the dark malts and a little carbonic tang. Body is odd as there is plenty of carbonation, it still feels soft in the mouth and has lots of hop high points that don't work so well for me. Almost chewy but not quite. Finish is like flavor and the high points in the bitterness linger for quite a while. Wouldn't cook with this. Worth checking out."

"Not what I expected for a black IPA but a very well made beer that I will drink again."
"A strange bird (ok, 'dog'), this one - many of its traits resemble a decent PAC NW Black IPA, however, the strange herbal and isolated anise characters just don't really do it for me. Which is a minor shame, as the restrained 'blackened' part of the style here is actually quite appealing - huh, when one door opens, another one closes, I suppose."
"Got this one expecting a ""black IPA."" I guess not everyone's definition of this is the same. I thought roasted malts with plentiful hops. This was neither black nor IPA."
"The overall persona here is just a tad dialed-down, but it's strong suit is drinkability, as it's balanced and quietly nuanced enough to consider tackling multiple bombers in one sitting, though one's attention may begin to wander."
"D - The pineapple scent and astringent flavor was unexpected, and disagreeable at first, as was the massive head. As I drank through the 22 oz. the flavor grew on me, and the creamy texture was solid. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't have it all that often, however."
"Flavor is similarly puzzling. It's sweet and boozy, and the leafy/herbal hop profile just doesn't seem to fit. Not nearly roasty enough for the CDA style. Some major tweaks are needed here. I've had some nice brews from Laughing Dog, but I can't recommend this one."
"Good, if somewhat light carbonation. Mildly high ABV, but not alcohol burn. I can't see this as a session beer."
"Just not quite as well put together as some others I've encountered, but I remember seeing this before most of those as well. Perhaps it's time to tweak this recipe. I think the potential is there."
"D ~ This does not taste right! It's just bad really. It's slick, gritty, acidic, and really horrible. Maybe it's ""infected"" with all the talk of LD sucking lately. AVOID."
"This beer poured out as a thick looking stout-like black liquid, The head was big and tan colored. The lacing was thick along the glass. The smell of the beer was citrusy with hops and heavily roasted with chocolate malts. The taste of the beer was pretty good also, The chocolatey richness blended quite well with the piny citrus flavors from the hops. The mouthfeel was thick and has a healthy carbonation to it. Overall I found this Black IPA to be quite good and would drink it again in the future."
"Average effort at best."
"I gave Dogzilla a shot, but I'm pouring out the other half bottle and passing the next time I'm offered it."
"Is it possible I had a bad bottle? I don’t know, this beer is too weird to be good. If this is the way it’s supposed to taste, I’ll pass next time."
"Nice and even brown color with a good clarity to it. A nice rich looking head of light tan rose up from the sides of the glass and reached a height of around two fingers before settling back down with a smooth and even lacing and a nice consistency hugging the glass. Aroma is a good bit hoppier up front then I thought it was going to be as well. This one just seemed to be full of surprises. Rich caramel and earthy grains lie underneath a bouquet of pine like hops. Quite light and very complex. I was extremely open to this one. First sip is smooth, creamy malts that wash across the tongue. Great complexity here now as well. Rich brown ale flavor, creamy, hints of earthy tones and a rich, subtly dry hop presence that seems to build and build. Last sips seem to be equally as well versed in sweet caramel notes as they are in dry, piney hops. Super session able and a pleasure to drink."
"O-I will certainly put my money where my mouth is for this libation. It is bold and complex in every way. Despite appearance, taste is essentially the biggest concern and I would recommend this concoction to anyone who is a fan a Black IPA's...Cheers!"
"A thick blackish brown color with a large tan head and lots of lace to go around. The aroma brings bright lemon and swampy malt. Very, very agreeable. The flavor brings a similar taste at first but settles to steady evergreen malty blend. It’s medium bodied with moderate carbonation, but plenty drinkable. It’s kind of glassy in feel, good stuff. I see not everyone likes this but I may be unique in enjoying that swampy/evergreen combo. Almost resembles a peat idea that I just find agreeable."
"O: Not impressed, by far the worst black IPA ive ever had...the color is not even black and carbonation is about 10 times what it should be not to mention it tastes bad."
"Overall, not particularly good, but different and worth trying."
"O - Very drinkable. Not a whole lot of hops for a black IPA. Not blown away by this beer, but would recommend trying."
"Laughing Dog is generally good, but this was something of a miss; not terrible, but like a decent BMC effort."
"Overall, this beer is okay, but far from my favorite ABA. Not sure I'd revisit it."
"P.P.S. I still won't ever drink this beer again."
"D: i've had far better bipas, but i coud see myself drinking this again. overall not a terrible black ipa for a bomber."
"Not the best example of this style, IMHO, Stone does a much better job with this style."
"O - Average, run of the mill black IPA. Looks nice, but is this feature normal or just the result of a possibly infected bottle (due to the massive over carbonation)."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is hidden but not completely absent in character. Easy drinking for the most part but one and done was enough. I'd probably pass on trying it again in the future unless there was any indication of freshness. This looks like an American black ale/ black ipa but it is lacking in flavor and aroma."
"My first Black IPA pours similar to a porter, with thick white head, aroma is pungently grapefruit, the taste is bitter then you taste the roasted malt, mouthfeel is creamy overall it is well worth the 5-7 dollars spent it is now one of my go to beers since OK got it in a few weeks ago."
"DOGZILLA pours into the glass a dark brown color with some black in there as well, a mix of the two leaning towards black. A nice loose bubbled dark tan foam rose up and retreated after some minutes, okay retention, weak lacing. Off the bat, this does not smell like a IPA, black ale is a good term for this beer. Smells grainy roasty with some small storm king like hop scents with a touch of the 6.9% coming out. This comes off like a hoppy porter with some tropics of a IPA without exibiting the bitterness of one. Feel is a step below medium with a nice carb but goes down smooth and not bitter. Im glad I split the bottle because this is not a good example of a black IPA, whatever that is."
"D- its a solid brew, not really getting this style yet but there are some I've found to be a bit more put together. While its a beautiful looking beer the flavors clash a bit a and just miss the mark a tad."
"this is the first time i've tried this, and i'm not usually a huge black ipa guy, but this is my favorite one thus far. it smells like an americano, and it's dark brown with a red hue when put to the light. as you take a sip you get hops hard!, then it mellows into the nice roasty malt, and finishes bitter with both hops, and coffee roast. nice! i will drink this again."
"Nothing overly offnesive here, but nothing that jumps up and becomes remotely reminiscent of this one either. You do or you don't. That's about it."
"Pours very dark - nice color, good lingering head with nice lacing. Unfortunately, that's the best this beer has to offer. Taste is thin and bitter with some sour notes as well. There is a definite hoppy taste, but not enough malt to offset the bitterness. Not my cup of tea and I would not purchase again."
"There's some malty sweetness in there, carbonation normal, I just can't get over the flavor of this beer. It's pretty offensive."
"Overall, a very easy to drink IPA. Hides the abv extremely well."
"This beer pour a dark brown color with a trace of tan head. The aroma is very strong with grapefruit hoppiness. The taste starts with that strong fruity and citrusy hops and then donates with some malty sweetness. The overall taste impression is very sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh and overcarbonated. Overall though a very interesting beer and definitely worth a try."
"I can't seem to understand why this is rated a B, seems quite low."
"It poured black with a good amount of head. The aroma was a pleasant amount of hop aromas. Their was something off about the taste. It wasn't that hoppy, and had a bit of a buttery diacetyl taste to it. Unfortunately I'm writing this off of notes and didn't write down what the batch number or anything was. I'd be interested to see what this is supposed to taste like. Considering the fact that it was probably a bad bottle, it was still a decent beer."
"A medium bodied beer that is very enjoyable even so that this beer is not my favorite beer style. A great job of brewing."
"Certainly a dark beer, though almost more of a porter color in that you can still see some red lurking in there when back-lit. Develops a one-finger head which dies away but leaves some lacing. Smell is really nice, very American hop-forward and certainly within IPA boundaries. Sweet, juicy hops, making me think of bubble gum and citric fruit. Taste is intriguing as it unfolds. The beginning has a sharp hop bite, followed by a bit of soft caramel sweetness (though not much), and the finish is a long, strong bitterness that borders on astringent. There are a lot of IBUs grinding away at my tongue. There is just a slight roast quality to it, but not a lot. I need to try more black IPAs to try and understand their purpose (if there is one). The body is about right and thankfully not too heavy. My biggest complaint is that the bittering hops are too heavy-handed for my liking. Otherwise, it's a tasty beer and a pretty good deal at $4/22 oz. bottle."
"Hoppy goodness in nose and mouth, very dry. Overall a nice beer, well above average."
"First sip reveals an average smooth textured body with tingly but gentle rolling carbonation. There is some bread notes mixed with the roast malt up front and then the flavor rolls to some earthy hops. No hints of ABV anywhere. The beer is well balanced and very easy to drink. I will buy another bottle of this beer in the future, the near future!"
"Surprised this one doesn't have higher numbers; I loved it and will not only get more, but will be hunting down more from this brewery. HIGHLY recommended."
"While this beer is enjoyable, the aroma leads more towards an American IPA and the appearance more towards an Imperial IPA. The flavor seems to be the highlight of this beer for me, and overall it is certainly worth a try."
"Smells of slightly floral hops and old lady bad perfume. Great head and nice lacing. Weird bitterness and taste of perfume with bad after taste. Not impressed wont buy again or recommend to anyone. Worst black Ipa I've had. The only thing good about this beer is the head not even black."
"Far from great, dogzilla is also far from poor. I love this new style, and the combination of black ale with solid hopping is up my alley. I do enjoy the beer, just wish it was a little more refined, less bitter, and a bit chewier in the mouth."
"Overall = this is an awesome beer it has the beat of both worlds - he aging mal presence of a stout an the hops of an IPA."
"Pours a very dark brown with no highlights showing up, and a thick tan head that leaves nice lacing and retains well. The aroma is bursting with fresh hop notes: grapefruit, pine, orange zest, along with some cocoa, dark chocolate, coffee, burnt bread, dark fruits and some alcohol...very nice and complex. The flavor is similar with big citrusy and piney hop notes upfront, along with some cocoa and orange zest, burnt bread and espresso, dark fruits, a slight chalkiness and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is maybe a tad thin for my liking, but drinkability is good. Pretty tasty black IPA, not mind-blowing but sufficiently complex and satisfying."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Lacing clings to the glass relentlessly. Smells of freshly cut grass. Taste is herbal grassiness up front, with a dark caramel middle, and a bitter grapefruit rind finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, high carbonation. Drinkability is good, brutal bitterness, in a good way that gives you your hop fix."
"22oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown color with a big frothy head. Lots of lacing. Aroma of piney hops, roasted malts and a small amount of chocolate. The taste is mostly pine with mocha. A bit of a metallic aftertaste. Decent Black IPA but there are better ones out there."
"Would I buy it again? Only if there weren't so many above average IPAs available. Why go for safe on first when you are capable of hitting a home run?"
"D- This wasn't a terrible beer, but it seemed as though they tried to go 4 directions with one beer, to the point that it was just not quite as good as it could have been."
"My local beer store had a bunch of Laughing Dog in stock so I picked up several, including DogZilla. Pours a deep dark reddish brown, not truly a ""black"" IPA - to me this would be what I would call a ""Cascadian Dark Ale"" - though that style name is somewhat pretentious. This beer is pretty to look at, with a billowing and sticky two finger light tan head, with lacing clinging to the glass. Massive hop aroma hits the nose first, with loads of pine and grass up front. Malt aroma there as well, somewhat crackery, though faint. Mouthfeel is mildly carbonated, and a little bit thin. You don't have time to really notice this though, as tons and tons of fresh hop flavor hijack the taste. This is clearly a West Coast style brew, right up there with the big boys in terms of hop presence. Atypical to style, the taste is fleeting - rather than slamming the tongue with waves of lingering bitterness the brew instead finishes very dry, with crackery malt hitting all the right notes. Overall this is a very nice take on the CDA / Black IPA / IBA style, as the mild bitterness and great hop character makes for an easy drinking beer."
"Overall: I've yet to see a black IPA live up to the hype. This one is a good IPA, but it might as well be pale. Not that I don't like this beer because it is good. There's just nothing that stands out (other than the color) from any other IPA. I WOULD buy it again."
"My first laughing dog beer. They have my attention, but this one doesn't really hold up by IPA standards. In a way this is average beer but in a way it just doesn't hold up. A light score decrease on price (6 for a 22 oz) and style considerations (IPAs are great even if they're crap)."
"I did a blind taste test with another ""un-named"" Black IPA and this one lost."
"D/M: Nice crisp carbonation with a good overall flavor that coats the palate. Really strong sipping beer that does not meld with the style as I expected. I wanted more weight to the beer."
"Drinkability is good. This is a pretty nice and tasty beer. Doesn't seem to fit really well in the Black IPA category though, needs more dark malt and hops flavors, and some more body to be better."
"drinkability is out of this world - light enough to be a drank on a hot summer day and rich enough to warm you on a cold winter night - this might not pack the punch of stone's SSR but this is the blows away boulders flashback which i loved"
"D - Was expecting more from this beer, but it failed to live up to expectations. Perhaps I bought a bad bottle. Maybe down the road will try it again."
"Highly drinkable for such great flavor alone! thought the ABV is definitely going to catch up with you at some point. Until the very last drop, Dogzilla is a smashingly good beer."
"Finally a reason to visit Idaho."
"A really good shot at the style. Not world class, but certainly worth ordering a few."
"Dark brown middle with cherry red edges. A small dirty white head recedes quickly. A rumbling of lace sticks randomly. Smells of oily hops with a fleeting sweet malt undercurrent. Tastes grainy with more huge oily hops and a perfect sweetness in the end again, which balances everything out, saving the day. Medium mouth-feel and highly drinkable. I haven't been able to get to this style lately, but this particular beer gets me one step closer to acceptance."
"Poured into a tulip. The color is a dark brown coming close to black. The aroma brings some really nice pine and citrus along with some roasted malt. Fairly common for the style and right within the parameters of what I would expect. Good taste with a bit of roast though the hops aren't quite on the level as the nose. Roast and bitterness in the feel. A nice beer; I wouldn't mind having more from them."
"I think this bottle was mildly infected. It still pulled through rather well, though."
"Pours very dark brown to black with a half inch of foamy head that laces the glass. The aroma is malty, slightly smoky, with some aromatic hops adding a sour zest. The flavor is of very dark roasted malt, coffee and a hint of smokiness with a bracingly bitter finish."
"Pours deep, dark brown with tan head. Very nice lacing lingers all the way to the last sip. Nose is a nice blend of citrus and earthy hops. The taste is of burnt toast, caramel, and charcoal, followed by earthy, hoppy bitterness. The bitterness remains in your mouth for several minutes after each sip. The body is bit full for the style, but overall a decent CDA."
"This was my first black IPA, and although I really enjoyed this beer, the style does not seem unique enough to draw me in. I will try other examples, and hope for more inspiration."
"Notes: Excited to try this as it is my first Black IPA, but I was a bit underwhelmed. I'm not sure if I'm not a fan of the style or just this beer, but it just didn't really work for me. Both the hops and malt came out, but neither is really strong or enjoyable. Hops provided mostly a bitterness, not as much nice hoppy flavors. Probably not worth the price, although again, I might just not enjoy the style as much."
"Hearty drinker, rich, full of flavor. Solid."
"D- the entire bomber went down easy enough, but I don't think I'm rushing out for another anytime soon"
"Hope to find a ""clean"" bottle in the future so I can do a proper review of the beer and not the infection."
"Mild carbonation, excellent mouth feel, creamy and rich. Alcohol is nonexistent to the senses, maybe after you finish it. Another after 1? Maybe, a great beer to settle with, though with the bold flavors would be hard to pair with a meal. Better as a stand alone or with some rich desserts."
"it was an ok beer. but nothing I'd buy again. I wouldnt turn it down if offered, but I would prefer something with a little more complexity. like I said earlier, just reminds me of a Guinness with some piney hops. I'd rather stick to a standard stout or a standard IPA."
"I don't remember having had a black IPA before. It tastes like an IPA with some dark stuff thrown in (if that's not obvious). Pretty good twist, I enjoyed it immensely. I could see this being a regular brew."
"D - This stuff is delicious and the higher ABV is nicely hidden. A very tasty dominant hop presence which is nicely complemented by the malts. A must try for any hop lover and I would definitely indulge again."
"There's nothing about this beer that makes it hard to drink, but there's nothing that makes it stand out from others in the category."
"The pour was jet black with a ridiculous amount of head, about 2/3 fo the glsass, the 2nd pour only slightly better. Pine and sweet citrus on the nose. The flavor has pine resin, oranges and a little grapefruit and a light finish. Solid medium body, averrage carbonation. I knocked the drinkability because I had to wait 10 minutes to drink it because of the head. A decent black ipa, but there are better ones."
"D: Extremely drinkable - I think my 22 oz bottle was missing a few ozs, it went so fast!"
"Thanks again Toby, I don't think I can say that enough!"
"Strong aroma is like freshly baked rye bread with an undertone of yeast and just a hint of citrus. It pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thick, fluffy, fairly persistent, pale tan head. Flavor is more rye-like and yeasty than hoppy, rather bitter, hint of grapefruit. Texture is smooth as soymilk and just a little bit tingly, leaving behind a sharp, slightly bitter, rye finish. OK, but I have had better."
"this is a very unique brew! worth a purchase for sure!"
"The real question is, is this a beer to seek out and spend your hard earned money on, may answer is ""Yes"" this is a very enjoyable Black IPA well balanced with enough hop flavor for Hopheads but not so much that you hit over the head with it. Overall this is a well carted example of a Black IPA"
"Big ups to JohnGalt1 for this choice. huge IPA fan, not so much on the Black IPA, but this is legit and kind of changed me. Deep burnt caramel pour, sweet malty smell. I liked this because it was a nice balance for a change, some of the new black IPA's are too dominated by the malty sweetness, this doe not have that, you actually get some pinet hop notes. Clean, crisp hops, sweet malt backbone to add to the drinkability. Good stuff."
"D- Overall, I really dig Black IPAs and this one is definitely worth a try if you like the style."
"An interesting style and fairly sessionable. Good, but not near the best in its class. Needs to be slightly more balanced. Normally I like acridity (especially from smoke), but it doesn't seem to work here. A fan of Laughing Dog's approach and will continue to support them, and hopefully their offerings can jump to the next level."
"Not sure if I got a bad bottle, but this was not a very well balanced beer. The head was a pain. I do not feel like waiting 10 minutes for the head to dissipate."
"Poured a dark brown with a half finger of brown head and left a little bit of lacing saticking to the glass. The nose was like a regular which was grapefruit citrus, pine, and floral hops but it had a big roasted malt character. The flavors were like the nose consisting of a piney hop bite alongside citrus grapefruit that help out on the overall bitterness but the roastes malts to add some dimension to this IPA styled beer; quite intresting. The brew was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a roasty, citric, and bitter finish. It drank pretty good and I'm really digging this experimental style that other brewers should take on to make beer that much more intresting."
"Overall not a bad beer to try but for $7.99 i do not anticipate buying again."
"drinkability: My first Lauhging Dog is a success. I would buy this again. Unsure why its only rated a B."
"Like many other Laughing Dog products, the basic recipe seems fine but the infections from tannin extractions and polyphenols is just too much to overlook."
"This is one of the earliest examples of the Black IPA style that I can remember seeing in bottles and while it could use some more balancing dark malt character to help offset the hops, this was still pretty darn solid. This is definitely one of the better ones that I've had from Laughing Dog."
"   D-  This is a nice IPA with full good depth of hops and a nice balance of bitterness.  It has an interesting twist with the black malt qualities being more sweaty, astringent ( but in a pleasant way) and not the fullness of black malt you get in a stout or porter. "
"Pretty decent still. Not an SSRA, but still good!"
"Great full bodied mouthfeel. Tons of carbonation. Very very good beer."
"Pours a dark brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma is grassy hops with a lot of toffee malt, piney hops and some iced tea notes. The flavor is pine and roasted malts with some resiny hops, earthy hops and surprisingly, something that resembles tea. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Good, but not among the best Black IPAs I have tried."
"One of the better black IPAs I've had - I'd be okay with this as a light colored IPA."
"Overall, not going to buy this one again, but it might be for some."
"A - This bottle had to be infected. I've read other positive reviews, so this must be an aberration. I will give it another chance and buy a bottle with fingers crossed."
"Taste improved after the beer aired. Started out very charcoal and bitter. This mellowed a bit after the drink continued. The bitterness stayed in my mouth and was very strong. The beer had just a little bit of a watery mouth feel. The bitterness held down the drinkability as well."
"Pours a dark brown color, but not black as the style suggests. It has a foamy, white head on top with big bubbles. The smell was citrusy and floral as you would expect from an IPA. The surprise came from the taste, which felt like I was sucking on hard candy! There was no roastyness as would be expected from the color. This one really threw me for a loop, and I liked it! It was my first foray into the realm of Cascadian Dark Ales (Yeah, I like that term better than Black IPA) and I will defiantly seek out more of this style to get a better feel for it."
"Enjoyed at the Oregon Brewer's Festival 2010"
"Pours a light brown colour with off-white head. The head dissipates quickly with little-to-no lacing. This bottle must be infected, but it was recently purchased I was told. It had almost a smell/flavour of a bad white wine, mostly sour grapes. Not getting roasted malt or a hop bite that I'd expect from a black IPA."
"Drinkability: unsubtle, but flavorful; this beer has some gotcha and it plays its cards well. I would have this again."
"I wasn't all that impressed with this one. I'll be interested in trying a different brewery's black IPA to see if it tastes any better or if I'm just not a fan of the style."
"Paired with something meaty this would be a repeat on my lineup."
"Big white soapy head. Mollasses and hops - simcoe. Some roasted malt. Infected? Buttery mouthfeel,some malts, hops did not work, weak carbonation. Frehly purchased bottle by RK, certainly not his fault. Not finishable."
"Thanks to hopflop for this one! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a dark amber with a three finger off white head that is very frothy but subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet hops and malt. The flavor was of dark malt and hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA. The head retention was epic on this one. Just glad I was able to try this one. The flavors and aromas were definitely on par for this style and it was one of the top black IPA's I've tried to date."
"Pretty carbonated but complex, this is also not that thick. Medium in body but highly drinkable."
"Pours Dark Brown with a huge tan head. Nose is hoppy but the burnt malts also show up as the beer warms up. Not a huge beer in flavour but rather a slightly mellow Cascadian IPA. The beer actually has a bitterness in the finish that grows tiresome as the bottle progreses. I poured out the last half glass becuase of this note. I have had better versions of this style and will not purchase this again"
"The beer seems a little over carbonated and leaves the mouth feeling a little dry, but it does not distract too much from the taste of the beer."
"good for an IPA, but darker than normal."
"Decent head and appearance. But the taste is not likely to please most American IPA fans. Smell and taste evoke a Christmas beer -- cloves and minty pine. Next Yuletide I'll buy some Schlafly's, but for summertime hops, I'll look elsewhere. Not recommended for IPA lovers."
"Overall this was my first of this style. I hope it gets beeter after this. So far Black IPA's are 0 for one in my book."
"Interesting black IPA, but lacking in a few standard IPA qualities. Still a good beer and worth picking up for any IPA fan."
"Drinkability: I could have this again. This is an interesting beer with the chocolate and hops..Almost like a hopped up schwarzbier. Good above average IPA."
"Notes: This is quite a beast it might appear to be cute and cuddly but that is only an illusion inot the dark heart of this beer. I am glad I got my hands on this one and will get more. Cheers."
"Something is odd about this brew. I like it, but between the caramel in the nose and the vanilla sweetness in the taste you can easily forget this is an IPA."
"This beer poured a clear, deep red-brown color with tall, creamy, light brown foam that persisted. The smell was NW hops, though not very prominent. The taste was hoppy but also malty like a very hoppy Dunkel or Schwarzbier. Not overly sweet, but a tad more sweet than an IPA. The mouthfeel was crisp and hoppy with medium body and good carbonation. Good dark malt throughout, and a hoppy finish. This was a nice beer."
"Good overall...across the board actually...not exceptional but not bad, really."
"As I try to drink some more, I realize I've only had a few ounces and can't fathom even pouring the rest from the bottle.Yeah, this is a drain pour."
"Light carbonation, full bodied, a nice IPA to take your time drinking. Overall it was good, probably enjoy Alpha Dog more though."
"Overall - Mix a Porter with an IPA - you get this beer. I'm not sure what to call it, but I know I like it."
"Notes: Maybe this is an off bottle, although I doubt it, and even if it were it was a rather pleasing drink. Thing is that it has great funky sense, not a skunked one mind you, but something more in line with the way that brettanomyces feels in a subtle way. The nose and look support that feel, and make for a nice dark IPA with a fresh hoppy funk that does the trick very well. Did they bottle something else on this one?"
"Laughing Dog's ""Dogzilla"" is one of those beers that tries to be different while ending up the same. Pours an opaque black with a thick head that quickly dissipates into a tan lace. Smell is of sweet bread and bubblegum. Nothing unique about the taste except for a lingering bitterness that is almost unpleasant. Drinkability is scored as average because of this. One and done..."
"D: Good IPA with a nice balance of flavors. Easily drinkable."
"D - I hope there wasn't a reason this was discounted from 7.99 to 3.99 at the only store I know of in WI that sells it. I will have to get another to see if this one was infected."
"This is not a beer I would seek out again."
"Overall, a very nice beer that I'll certainly try again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of black IPA style facet, this is a solid beer that is worth drinking for a while if you want a slight variant of a normal IPA."
"( no freshness date on this bomber ), I hope this one isn't too rough on the guts tomorrow..."
"Would recommend this beer to IPA fans and other beer lovers. I found it to be very good, and easy to drink. Also very well balanced."
"Drinkability: I mean, not too exciting here. It's got more flavor than a pale ale might, but the flavors don't feel synergistic or add much to one another. Just a bit underwhelming."
"Appearance is pretty dark with a nice head and fair lace. Smell has a nice balance of hop and roasted malt with some grapefruit. Taste has a big punch of dark roasted malts and a little salinity with a good bite of grapefruit bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. A little roasty for my taste, but overall not a bad beer."
"Flavors of roasted dark malt, cocoa and coffee, paired with bright, citrusy and piney hops. Hints of smoke and oak. Flavors move in and out, working well together. Full and rich mouthfeel, satisfying and tasty."
"I'll definitely buy this one again!"
"This is a good IPA. The chocolatey appearance doesn't add much of anything but novelty. The pour is a deep brown to black with a modest white head that retreats quickly leaving a moderate lace. The hops and malts don't exactly explode into the nose but they are there, they are consistent, and they are nice. The nose is a bit boozy with some sweetness via the malts. This IPA has a nice combination of malt and hop, not too much of either, just a nice fruity bitterness with a toasty sweetness that coexist quite nicely. There was a lot of hype surrounding this style and the dark malt does add a nice toastiness to the beer, but it is nothing to really write home about. The beer is good and the hype is hype."
"The feel throws this off - This is second brew from this brewery that has a carbonation issue that throws it off. (Another had a hint of it - and a few others were fine.) Despite this, it is an interesting beer with bitterness coming from hops and roast."
"Check this beer out if you can on tap, I've had bottles I wasn't nearly as impressed with. You just don't seem to get the Simcoe and Cascade hop assault not nearly as complete without all that pine and citrus hop mouthfeel."
"Medium body with a pungent aftertaste, the way this beer lingers in my mouth costs it some drinkablity points. Other than that great beer hope I can acquire another."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, odd yet pleasant, flavors play nicely off one another, I could sit with this for a bit."
"Overall, a solid beer. Dark, but light mouthfeel."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3 1/4"" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. Head lasts more or less forever, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is sweet and citrusy. Taste is rich and sweet upfront, piney citrus in the middle, and closes with ample bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Nice brew."
"Poured great, more of a darker brown than black, tasted good while drinking but the bitterness lingered stopping this beer from competing with the better beers. Love the idea of IPA/stout hybrids and think Laughing Dog is headed in the right direction."
"Just too much for me without a bit of sweet to save it. I didn't want to finish it."
"Very bitter dry piney hops up front that are quickly countered by a very strong buttery toffee presence. There is a strong dark caramel and chocolate malt backbone with hints of dark fruit, mostly sour cherries and dark berries. It really does taste like a very biter chocolate covered chrry. Very odd and unpleasant combination of flavors. The bitterness lingers thorughout but the strange malt backbone is very rominent and the whole beer is a bit of a mess. Not a fan."
"D - High for the style. Great black IPA overall. These Laughing Dog guys are solid. Really can't believe this is rated B- overall."
"22 oz. bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Opened with a big pop. Lots of carbonation. Poured a deep brown with a huge head of light tan foam. Citrusy hop aroma. More citrus and piney hops in the flavor. Plenty of hop bitterness. Some chocolate malt. Nice lacing on the glass. Medium bodied, the carbonation didn't really take anything away from the beer. Finished with malt dryness along with drying hops. Nice Black IPA, works for me."
"Interesting..."
"D - Not on my watch. Not recommended to anyone except serious, devout hop-heads. Even then . . . oh, well. They get an ""'A' for creativity, which should be a category."
"Mouthfeel has a slickness to it with a fluffy texture. This one is hard to categorize. It's not following rules."
"Is it a dark IPA or an over-hopped porter? Either way, you will experience something outside the comfort zone. AND it is still very good. If you have an open mind, seek this out and try something totally different from the usual fair."
"Drinkability: Overall, it was a very good dry and bitter IPA that was weak in the nose, but had a nice bitter taste with black toasted malts backing it up. If you ever want to try a beer from Idaho that's bitter and dry with a unique color, then pick up a bottle of DogZilla. This beer shouldn't burn a hole in your wallet."
"pretty decent. i love black ipas so kudos to all that make one. has a good flavor that i never really got bored with. i like this and will try again."
"I can't say that I'm a fan of this beer."
"A rough mix of irish stout and ipa which is not as satisfying as either on its own. Like most pre-mix black and tans. A black ipa maybe a good idea, but this take needs work. Stick with Alpha Dog or Devil Dog."
"- Overall this isn't bad... bit too much towards a porter though for me... for me a Black IPA should be more like a dark lager, but an ale, and with a larger hop profile... which after belching... there is a nice flood of hops.. citrus even... and is a bit hidden by the over-done porter-like malting. Blanced almost."
"Very deep reddish auburn colour, clear, with great head retention. There were thick rings of whitish lace denoting each sip. Intense aroma of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - not much else. Moderate bitterness up front that grew into the finish. Caramel sweetness with a bit of toffee, fruity tangelo, grapefruit towards the end and a lingering bitter orange finish. Medium bodied with average carbonation and some dryness. Decent texture. Overall, not bad at all."
"Mouthfeel is rich and drinkability is good (if you have time to wait for the head to die down)"
"Drinkability is good but nothing special really, just an IPA with some lightly roasted malts thrown in."
"22 oz bomber. Dark brown with a huge light tan creamy head. Aroma to me was very subdued and unimpressive some maltyiness, and the barest hint of pine. Taste weird, this is my first Black IPA and certainlly its almost a balance between the malts a..toasty,toffeeish and the hopping..mainlly piney. Takes some getting used to. Nice mouthfeel on this one. Overall a very different IPA. Like I said my first Black IPA, need to try some more."
"Drinkability: low- I couldn't get over the tire flavor, which is a shame because every other aspect of the beer was delightful"
"A: Excessive foam on an easy pour - a full four inches to one inch of beer though it dropped within a few minutes leaving a slight rocky head, the color of a cola, some sticky patches along the edge of the glass - 2.50, S: Mild sweetness in the back of the nose, noticeable espresso and ash, a little vegetal, hard to decipher or identify the hops which seems meek - 2.25, T: The palate is considerably better than the nose led me to expect, significant hop bitterness but mild for the style, some grapefruit and orange rind, also some coffee ground flavors - 2.75, M: Slightly gritty and smooth - 3.00, D: I appreciate the concept of an IPA with dark specialty malts, but the IPA side of the beer is seriously lacking in my opinion, there's a fair share of bitterness but none of the other pleasantries associated with hops, though certainly a drinkable beer, I don't foresee buying this beer again - 3.00"
"D: Still trying to figure out this style...a good and reasonably drinkable version of a style my taste buds consistently protest. Worth a try - be your own judge - but still the same drinkability (or lack there of) i've often found."
"overall: I like the carbonation in this beer its very bubble which is good for a virginia evening... as far as these style go i will take an iniquity or a stone black ipa over this one, im new to the style and while this beer looks and smells great it doesnt deliver on flavor which as we all know, is king"
"This poured a clear very dark mahogany with tons and tons of light tan head. It smelled like juicy oranges and copper hops, with some roasted barley and a bit of coffee. It tasted like strong coffee, with some copper and cream and roasted barley. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter metallic aftertaste. Overall I love this style, but I'm not a huge fan of this particular example. It still had a pretty good smell and taste, with decent body. But simply pouring it was a nuisance due to all the head, and the lasting metallic flavor makes this a bit tough to drink. I miss the clean and succulent character of Iniquity or Sublimely Self-Righteous. DogZilla just didn't impress me."
"It's drinkable, and a very good beer, but too roasty for style. Maybe black IPA needs its own category, as I suspect this happens a lot?"
"Overall this was interesting, but I'm not sure I would get this again."
"This is a good beer, but I think it's drinkability is hurt by the fact that it purports to be an IPA but is more of a style of its own."
"DogZilla Black did not work at the end of a warm summer day, and as IPAs go, it's just plain wrong."
"D: Decent drinkability, the dark malt base and bitterness go well together but wish the hops were brighter and sharper in pronunciation. Worth a grab if you see it, but don't expect the hoppiness to win you over here."
"From a 22 oz bottle, this poured a hazy red with fairly fat tan long lasting head very sticky lacing rings. The nose is lightly roasted malts with floral and citrus hops. Thick and cream palate with a slick mouthfeel. Lots of rich flavor with a good balance between the sweet malts and hop bitterness leading to a slight bitter"
"D: An intriguing beer but done much less well than Iniquity from Southern Tier, and it suffers for it."
"Pours a very deep, dark reddish-brown and edging that glows with a creamy tan colored head that lasts for sometime and remains a layer atop the glass. The aroma has sweet chocolate, roasted malts and some fruity hops, although faint. The flavor has much of the same although more sweetness and has a nice soft bitter finish. Its a medium bodied beer that is plenty carbonated and has a slightly dry finish. I found it to be a more balanced ""Black IPA"" than most others I have tried. Pretty good. It has a soft smokiness that becomes present as the beer the warms up."
"Another typical Black Ale, although they call it an Black IPA (which makes no sense). Anyway, dark roasty malts sit under some pretty sharp citrusy hop flavors. This is one of the better beers from Laughing Dog. Recommended."
"The taste is just awful. I couldn't get it out of my mouth fast enough but it was, at least, fast enough that I didn't have to figure out what it was that I was tasting. I immediately walked downstairs and poured it out. I was afraid that I might spill some on my clothes and ruin them forever. I don't understand how any brewer can bottle this and sell it, don't they ever taste the beer they make. The first time this was reviewed was 8/2/08 so if it has only been brewed the one time then this is 10 months old. I can't think of a better reason why all beer should have the bottling date on it. How could I possibly know that this is 8 months past when I should have bought it, if this is true. I will rate it because I don't know when it was brewed. I would rather drink 10,000 Bud Lights than one of these."
"A new brewery at my usual source, Whole Foods Market in NoVA; they also has there Alpha Dog and the CSD."
"M: light - mild"
"Drinkability: this black IPA did not do it for me at all as the bitterness level was lower than expected allowing the sweetness to rise to the top."
"Overall- Solid tasty IPA. Another good LD beer."
"D: i like black coffee so it's not bad... but definitely not what i expected. i don't think i would want to drink this one again... but it was worth the try. If you like black lagers or fruity stouts, i'd say go for it. as far as IPAs go, Alpha Dog blows it away."
"Overall this is a bit strange for an IPA, and no where near as good as other ""black"" IPAs I've sampled such as the Stone 11th Anniversary brew. I wasn't a big fan of this and would not have it again."
"In my RR tulip, this beer is a gorgeous brown with ruby highlights, a thick, fine latte-colored head and some breathtaking lacework. On the nose, there's citrus hops, with orange and lemon, with a creamy chocolate character. Decent. On the palate, it opens up with a harsh hop bitterness, citrus with grapefruit and lime zest providing the foundation. There's muted malt flavors, with a milt sweetness present. The milky character I noticed on the nose is missing, and there's a hint of roasted malt, but the hops just cover it all up. There isn't enough balance between the flavor and bittering hops. Carbonation is good, but the bitterness is a bit higher than I'd like, and rather unbalanced. The finish, OTOH, is good, with a pleasant dryness and a mild bitterness. Again, the lack of balance hurts the drinkability of this beer"
"M: medium bodied. carbonation level is a litle high. very crisp and slightly muddy."
"Pours a clear brown with red highlights. This beer is certainly not black. Smells of west coast hops and not much else. First sip is grapefruit hops. The massive hops easily dominate the malts to a point of being too unbalanced. Very bitter from start to finish, this is quite good in a west coast IPA sort of way."
"Drinkability- The more of this I drink, the more I'm thinking this is infected. I've had infected brews before (usually my own homebrews) but nothing this light. It's just got a sour/tartness that is out of place and the carbonation is obviously a bit much. Oh wells, win some ya lose some."
"Overall - I enjoyed this brew because it had the hop of an IPA and carried the taste of a stout as well. Im not a big fan of stouts, but i enjoy the flavor, here you get that flavor in a lighter IPA style."
"D: worth a try, I guess, helps increase the palate of flavors on the tongue. I pass on this one"
"Pours a deep dark brown with garnet highlights and a massive mocha head that persists forever and leaves mad lace on the glass. Smells of floral citrus and pine. Some brown sugar, caramel, and toffee in there as well. Taste is fairly hoppy bitter citrus with a bit of astringency in there. Slight caramel and toffee but very faint this one is mostly hops. I pick up a faint spicy Belgian yeast character in the finish of this one. Body is medium to thin, mouthfeel is sticky, carbonation is a bit high. This one is only ok. The body is too thin, there's an off putting astringent taste, the carbonation is much to high. I like what they were trying to do, but this is one and done for me."
"It's okay, but I wouldn't go looking for it again."
"Overall, I'm not very impressed with this beer. For a black IPA, it seems to be missing the IPA part. It's just a mess. Try if you like, but don't go out of your way to get it."
"Well at least it looked good. Poured black with a large light tan head. Aroma was bad and the taste was even worse. Sour (in a bad way) plastic, mild vomit. I would have not even rated it if I thought this was an isolated case but by looking at some of the other ratings I am sure there is a problem with this beer in general. Down the drain. What a shame."
"D: ...but I can't bring myself to finish it. Just shy of a drain pour."
"Purchased: Liquid Solutions"
"Don't know how long I could drink this one. I really wouldn't want to drink it at all if I was in the mood for a DIPA."
"D: I really liked this one. More black IPA's need to be made."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours more of the color of a English black tea then a true black. From the pour, a nice 2 inch head, that was remarkably light for the color of the beer, came forth but left no lacing. The aroma is interesting. There really is just a slight hint of citrusy hops, with an odd aroma that I can really describe as frozen yogurt. The taste doesn't really remind me of an IPA. There really is not hop presence except in the bitterness of it. The malt adds more body then flavor also. The one really defining attribute of the flavor profile is a strong bitterness at that finishes. Its way to bitter and comes across as medicinal, like sucking on an aspirin. It's just not a flattering trait in a beer. The flavor of this beer is really off putting for me. The medicinal qualities are just to much. I definitely wont be seeking this beer out again."
"Not very drinkable and certainly not sessionable. I would expect something with this type of drinkability to have a higher ABV, and a little alcohol heat couldn't hurt the flavor either. I'll probably pass on the Dogzilla in the future."
"Very well made IPA with a touch of porter or stout to it."
"I wont go through the details but if you are looking for an IPA do not drink this beer. It may sound novel, but Black IPA is a retarded name for this, its not an IPA whatsoever. No hop flavor in the taste, not even close. Im pissed I paid 4.30 for this. Ridiculous. Look elsewhere fellow hopheads, please."
"its not that i cant drink this beer. its just that i really am not pulled back to it like some others. i would probably have to nurse this for a while. worth a shot if you want to try something different. just dont expect something phenomenal."
"I scored this a little better than average, because I applaud their effort. But this isn't something I would seek out again."
"Unfortunately, Laughing Dog DogZilla comes nowhere near the promise of its name and label. I don't care if craft breweries come up with Green IPAs, Purple IPAs or Turquoise IPAs, as long as they're good IPAs. This one doesn't cut the mustard."
"D - This is a unique and delicious IPA. It almost tastes like a strong Baltic Porter mixed with a West Coast IPA. Very cool and different."
"Drinks okay. Not sessionable for me. Would have this again. Interesting."
"pours a thin redish black color with a small white head that disapers to a light lacing around the entire rim. the sent of hops rushes out at you at the crack of the cap. this is one of the best smelling ipa's ever. the taste is bitter all the way through, hints of coffiee and biscuts, caremel, yard trimings, sweet tobaco and strong alchoal. this is a beer i will seek out agan for sure"
"D - Not a terrible beer but not a good one either. I'll bet they're good on tap but based on my experiences, the bottles seem to be off."
"it is really smooth, and has a nice darker aftertaste. the aftertaste exceeds the taste, but the drinkability is low. (I can only hope this is a bad keg or a dirty line.)"
"A cutting pine needle and citrus in the aroma. But the quaff puts me off a bit, too much woody resin in the finish and aftertaste. I luv a good IPA, but the harshness of this one doesn't set well. I didn't taste any smoke as previous reviewers, and certainly don't think this is an ""A" beer."
"A curious IPA and a nice twist with the dark malts, it's like smoked porter versus India Pale Ale on this one, some sort of hybrid like the name Dogzilla tends to imply, and it works."
"overall pretty good, not a session beer, this one went down slow."
"Drinks well, a little filling mainly due to the dark colour and caramel ending making it feel more like a porter"
"Good interesting beer. Acidity from the dark malts works well with the hops."
"An unusual tasting beer, but I enjoyed it. I'm not sure I'd want to session it, but one bomber hit the spot after getting off work today, and I'll definitely have it again. If my friends tried this version of this beer and didn't like it, I have to respectfully disagree with them. If this is a re-worked version of what they drank, then I'd say the fine tuning was worth it."
"D: Well the very fact that they pay homage to the Blue Öyster Cult tune Godzilla (from their '77 album Spectres) on the bottle is a good sign. Plus, this does go well while jamming BOC and probably while watching the cinematic masterpiece The Stöned Age. I thought this beer was unique, innovative, and delicious. Highly recommended to everyone."
"The black IPA is a sub-style that I would like to see being made more often. They're interesting to a hop head, like me, with the new malt additions. Dogzilla brings to mind the freshest of Founder's Black Rye unfortunately I can't drink them side by side. Thanks for the bottles Toby, I thoroughly enjoyed them both."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, not much carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, sour/tangy, metalic, very slight roastyness, with some citrus/grapefruit. The taste is hoppy, with some malts, sour/tangy, metalic, some roastyness, and some citrus/grapefruit. Medium body. Drinkable, but there is a strange sourness/metalic taste to this brew."
"The aroma is cascade like with a spicy citrus and pine smell. The taste is initially hoppy then fades into a roasted malt backbone. It leaves a little bit of an abrasive hop bitterness on the finish and stay with you in the mouth for quite awhile. You really need to be a hop head to enjoy this beer fully. Overall it is a interesting American IPA and definitely worth a shot. It was priced right as well."
"D - I enjoyed this one quite a bit. The dark malts balanced well with the hoppiness, and I could certainly drink this one again and again."
"D - Very drinkable. I hope this one sticks around for a little bit. This is an IPA for any season!"
"smooth, rich, hoppy, different, and a finish that just keeps going, another supreme ale from Laughing Dog"
"drinkability - very drinkiable. I hope whole foods still has some left as I only got 1 bottle and would like to keep another on the shelf for a while."
"I really hope Laughing Dog makes this part of the litter. No doubt I will be buying this again... I know it is drinking very fresh right now... but it is such a good value, I can see picking up a bunch and throwing them in the fridge so anytime I want something a little different I have a good goto brew. Fantastic."
"Coffee and roasty malt is subtle, but there tucked behind the big american hop profile. Ever so drinkable and a really really nice IPA. This deserves to be a fulltime brew if it isnt. Smooth and with a nice dry aftertaste that makes me want to keep drinking."
