"DATE TASTED: December 30, 2014... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... OCCASION: celebrating Shan's new holiday--New Year's Eve Eve... APPEARANCE: jet black body with gray uneven head that simmers to a marshy top; post-trailing is tangible... AROMA: extremely floral with vanilla, citrus and bubblegum; complex... PALATE: immediately effervescent, with bubbles coalescing on the tongue; warming, stoking at the throat; at 9.5% ABV, devilishly subtle...TASTE: intense hops blunt  slightly sweet, almost milky hints; malts lend a smoky appeal to the chunky dark body; coffee is secondary, but smoothly infused... OVERALL: a BIG beer that requires sipping for appreciation; in the Box o' Hops, a third to the Creeker and Flower Power, but that is not an insult, but that's the company it keeps..."

"Some roasted malt, little chocolate.  Mild coffee.  The hops do not quite compliment the rest of the beer.  Balance could be improved."
""
"Very solid beer from Ithaca. Strong malt and bitter hop finish, yet oily and the nose is coffee and malts with a subtle lactose like smell."

"not really my style of black ipa"

"Two fingers wort of late to develop light brown colored batter like densely packed frothiness...  Rock solid retention...  The color is a translucent dark brown...  A limited bit of carbonation can be seen meandering around...  The nose is fairly subdued but far from impotent...  There is a bright citrus at the forefront...  Pineapple...  Oranges...  Next comes a rock solid malt base...  Biscuit...  Light caramel...  This all sits a top a faint roasted malt character...   The palate starts exactly as expected with a pleasant mix of hops and malt base...  The finish has a surprising presence of vanilla which lingers a bit...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Smooth an rather quaffable...  Limited carbonation...  The finish has a very slight charred texture and turns slightly chalky...   Not a bad brew by any means, but a few notches below best in class American Black Ales...  The slightly cloying vanilla presence, while not off putting, detracts slightly from the other charming qualities of this brew...  Having now worked my way through the 2nd Box of Hops offering, I can safely say the Flower Power is still the best of the bunch..."

"Overall:  It's hard to think this beer is 9.5%.  Alcohol is well hidden and this beer drinks do smooth.  Will Revisit this one again."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Flavorful, complex and robust Black IPA. Piney grapes, in two words if you will."

"It is a sweet hoppy meld in my mouth. I get bitter grapefruit and lemon along with sweet orange. It rounds out into a malt mouth with caramel notes and plumb in the background. The myriad of flavors is complex and smooth keeping it interesting and delicious. It also goes back and forth between bitter and sweet so as it not to be off putting or cloying. This is an excellent brew."

"A decent take on the style, will definitely appeal to those who like BIPA to feature bitter and  roast."

"Overall, a very good brew, nice flavors and cover the strength well. Nice roast presence and good hop flavor."
""
""
""
"But to the beer: nice fruity edge, in a black ale kind of way. Seems like there is some tasty hop oils on there too. Earthy, yet balanced and bright. Not blowing me away, but a very pleasant drinker."

"On the lighter end of medium body with a strong earthy hop presence giving off some dry, piney bitterness that lingers over the dark malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Resinous oils, dank buds, pine needle and spruce tip followed by hints of burnt toast, bittersweet dark chocolate, used coffee grounds, oatmeal, ash, caramel and toffee. Pretty robust but never approaches being acrid, harsh or overly roasted. Complex, well balanced and very easy to drink with a well masked ABV. No heat with very little alcohol sweetness in the finish. I'm not a big fan of black IPAs but this is one if the better interpretations of the style that I've had."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a thick, sticky finish. Overall, this is a good black IPA, but isn't anything that will blow you away. That being said, the combination of the dark toasted malts and the pine and floral hops is very interesting, and worth a try."

"overall too smoky/malty for me. but drinkable."

"Overall, this is essentially a hoppy stout. Dark Vine has a strong hop flavor and a good supporting cast of dark malts and resilient yeast. A perfect beer to drink when there's snow, freezing rain, and sleet outside."
" The taste of Dark Vine has a mild pine hop flavor with some dark roasted keeping up and slight brown sugar element of crystal malt toward the middle. There is a mild citrus tinge from the hops which have good flavor and dominate the malt, however there is enough to soften the flavor and give a more balanced flavor of burnt malt with the juicy hops trailing toward the end. Overall I enjoyed this a lot more than most of the style even though it is a bit more malty than I expected considering the bitterness level of some of the other hoppy beers in the repertoire however the alcohol is pretty well hidden making for a drinkable hoppy black ale"

"Overall I was quite impressed with this beer not too bitter or roasty very balanced reminded me of the 15th stone Black IPA but less bitter. Worth picking up paid 3 bucks for the single."
""
"Dark Vine is a good black IPA. It's not a bad pick."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the worst Black IPA's I've ever had. Its too extreme and unbalanced, there's so many undeveloped flavors here too. What a shame, considering how amazing The Creeker turned out to be."

"I love the black ipa style. This is by far the strongest black ipa I've had and may be the reason for the distinctive flavor profile. Poured into a Left Hand glass, smells like an ipa, tastes like a dark, smokey ipa with a hint of alcohol bite. First sip was very disappointing, however the warmer the beer gets, the better it becomes. I suggest drinking it five minutes after pouring and don't judge it till you're half way through."
"O: very nice brew. Not offensive, but it has some pronounced notes. It's is like porter meets APA over buttered popcorn. Pleasant."
"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, citrus zest, and pine aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, earth, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: I would like to preface by saying that in my opinion, this beer is very well executed in terms of the development of the flavors, aroma, etc. However, the combination of the aromatic, citrusy and floral hop aromas with the dark malts that establish the black IPA classification are a strange combination to me, and not to my liking. The least desirable part of the beer to me is the taste, where the hop flavors are overpowered by the maltiness, but the hop flavor does not pair well with the malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - What a great, tasty beer. Has a lot of flavors, balanced well, and is rather easy to drink for being near 10% alcohol. Another winner, hope they package this in 6 packs, will drink again."
""
""
""
"O - The ABV is incredibly well hidden and I had no idea this beer was sitting in the 9% range which makes it dangerously drinkable. Speaking of which, I'm not a fan of the style and I didn't enjoy this at all in the beginning but several sips in it started to grow on me with some really tasty hop resin which I never expected. I purposely avoided this one in the Box of Hops and it turned out to be way better than I anticipated - don't care for the aroma but the taste makes up for it."

"M: Round medium leading to fuller side."
""
"O- not a bad beer, just nothing outstanding. Below average for a black IPA"
""
"O/D-I've grown to slowly dislike Black IPA but every one and a while a brewery takes a pretty sharp take on the imperfect style."

"Dark cola appearance, light tan head forms thick with thin speckled lacing. Aroma hints of dark chocolate, herbal hop notes. This is a great smelling beer, herbal hops hints of pine, mild citric notes amongst a dark roasted malt backbone, the beer really works better than most failed attempts at Black IPAs. Flavor brings big hop bitterness hints of dark chocolate and herbal mint character from the hops mild citrus hop accents. Overall you have to think of one of the Andes mint chocolate when you drink this beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied moderate natural carbonation slightly oily resinous hop components glide across the palate. Nice dry finish keeps this beer drinking great with every sip, I need some more of this stuff."
"O: a good black ale, featuring most of the elements common to the style, but augmented by a dark hop bill to boot"
""

"Poured with a thick, billowy beige foam with nice staying power. Foam reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Black in color down the middle with dark brown shades on the edges. Dark roasted malt, floral and light citrus aromas with occasional pine hop and a light medicinal, band-aid smell at the back end. Medium bodied with assertive, but delicate carbonation. Burnt malt flavor up front followed by citrus hop bitterness into the middle. Pine hop bitterness and espresso flavors from the middle to the end. Finishes with a lingering pine hop and charred malt bite along with boozy notes as this warmed up."

"Not quite as good as The Creeker, but miles better than the abomination that was Double Zilla."

"Overall: Excellent big Black IPA. Too bad this one isn't regularly brewed."
""
"Overall I'm enjoying this beer. Strong yet it remains easy drinking due to the great flavor. If youre a fan of hops seek this one out in the Box of Hops."
""
""
"This is a typical black IPA/Cascade Dark Ale. It is smooth for the alcohol percentage, but it is not hidden very well. Was expecting a little more balance, but this is a drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"This is a solid ""Imperial Black IPA"". It's well-crafted, but it's really nothing too exciting and leaves me wanting more. Too many alcohol notes in the nose and flavors. But once again, it's not hot or boozy."
""
""
"A good example of the style. Its not my favorite style so it is slightly reflected in my score. Well made."
"I really dig this fine offering from the gang at Ithaca! Oh and yes, there will be lacing."

"While the beer's label designation as an IPA is warranted, its taste is on the mild side of the genre. There's a certain sweetness at its center, with an appropriate--though unchallenging--bitter finish. The hops are there, but comprise a sedate, dignified presence. The beer's texture is mellow and smooth. I'm not sure what Ithaca has in mind for its ""Box of Hops"" selections, but this is one I wouldn't mind returning to."
""
"Tastes at first strangely hollow, the dark color doesn't seem to come from dark malts. Hops are exactly where I want them, though, so the next sips I mash around in my mouth more before swallowing. As I get over the surprise of the first few sips I start to find the missing center to a fine dry hoppy mouthfeel that makes my mouth water after each swallow. The only piece missing to this great puzzling black beer is a bit more roasty dark malt flavor, but maybe that's just a problem with my expectation from such a stout-looking brew."

"Overall: this was an enjoyable Black IPA, slower sipping but mildly refreshing. Defintely worthy of a try."
"What would be nice would be a blend of flower power with a roasted porter, thats a black IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't super impressed, but really liked how easy this was to drink. Wasn't overly impressed with the aroma, but the taste and drink-ability more than made up for it. Unlike the first beer I had from the Box of Hops (The Creeker) this one can easily be a one and done brew."
""

"O: The Black IPA is a fantastic winter beer to those who can't stomach the malty/spicy offerings usually found on offer in the darker months. That being said, it's a style that is still young and developing constantly. This particular beer could be a fine example of the style with a bit of tweaking. It's the first Black IPA I've tasted from Ithaca, so perhaps they're still experimenting, but it's a strong start to an exciting style."
""
"Overall, a very nice cascadian dark ale (the term I prefer). Fresh hop flavors blend nicely with dark malt very well. Another winner from the Box of Hops."
""
""
"O: Quite good, though a bit too much char/ash to meet my ideal ABA."
"This one came so close to a stout but the malt stopped just short of heavy enough to be considered a stout. It stayed supple and smooth even amidst all the taste texture of the roasted qualities. You might never guess that it's almost 10% abv."
