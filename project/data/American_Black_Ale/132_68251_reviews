"O: I will never drink this beer again. There are lots of nice flavours present, but the licorice like bitterness ruins this beer for me. I am barely able to taste anything in the beer but this licorice taste. This is without a doubt due to my absolute hate for black licorice. Otherwise, I think this could be a good beer. It's a shame I wasn't able to enjoy the other flavours. Worth a try for sure if you think you'll enjoy that taste."

"OVERALL: This is a really, really good black IPA with a solid, almost stout base beer. Actually, this is pretty much a very, very hoppy stout with more than enough bitterness to satisfy any craving. Something I was very happy to drink and would gladly drink again if the LCBO gets more next year. Recommended."
"Overall – A rather decent black IPA, but nothing all that exceptional overall.  A nice one to try, but really not worth the added price of the bomber or on tap in comparison to some of the other black IPA’s out there in 12 oz-ers"

"Nice chocolate smell"

"O - Just an average beer, lacks any real flavour depth and the dry bitter finish it not for me."

"Taste-Herbal, earthy hops, roasted malt, coffee and pine. Well-balanced, and nicely suited to a grilled burger or BBQ pork."

"That being said, Dad's Little Helper offers more of a superficial glimpse than it does a master class on the style; while thoroughly enjoyable there are, to be sure, more formidable examples out there. Those new to the style, however, are encouraged to cut their teeth on this. Rogue rarely does any wrong, and this offering is up to their usual solid, serviceable standards."
""
""
""

"Final Grade: 3.98, a respectable B+. Dad's Little Helper Black IPA is a solid brew, with a yummy malt backbone that should sit well with most stout/porter fans. Despite being quite bitter, the hops don't really seem to contribute many other flavours to this one, which is a little disappointing for a black IPA from the West coast. This would make a good introduction to the style, and there's no disputing that it's a well-made beer, but aspects of this one still leave me wanting. Worth a shot, but not a world-beater."

"The taste has a malt character but it is more like licorice or molasses. Muted sweetness. The finish is a tad bitter but not over the top. As far as Black IPA's go it is alright but I am not blown away."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"MF – Creamy with a dry finish. Medium-bodied. A bit thin on the palate. 3.25"
""
"O: Didn't really like the first sip... let this one breathe and strike when it is a little warmer. Not exactly what I expect from a black IPA. More along the lines of a ridiculously hopped dopplebock. Not my fave in the style, but not bad at all, either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like the Fathers Day theme and this is a fine beer, I would recommend everyone try it at least once."
""
"Pretty tasty beer, and a bit different from other black IPAs I've had -- again, it tastes more like a hoppier-than-usual stout than a black IPA. Still, not a bad price at all, and it's a pretty tasty beer."

"OVERALL: this is a fine beer for the style, this style is just not appealing to me personally. I've had some beers brewed with chocolate and that worked but the coffee taste and roasted malt taste does not work for me."
""
""
""
""
"Food match: This is definitely an ale for the next cigar society meeting, which I am not affiliated with, nor do I acknowledge the existence of."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, citrus zest, weed, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but there is a definite weed aspect I am getting in the aroma."

"O : I have had some delicious beers from Rouge, this was enjoyable but nothing besides the appearance really stood out for me. I found the smell to be mild, the taste to not be all that complex and it had a fairly strong bitter and dry aftertaste which i wasn't a fan of."

"Bought for Father's Day, but just opened today when I found out I was going to be a father to a daughter. Appearance is a black appearance with a slight red hint in the light. Creamy, thin layer of retention with good lacing on the side. Aromas were rich in malts with a slight chocolate, maybe coffeeish, flavor. Taste is a bitter, with a roasty malt flavor. The drink has a good, crisp, medium body with a creamy texture. Overall, a great, celebratory beverage for a great day in my family!"
""
""
"Overall: Solid ABA here by Rogue. I feel the bitterness could be lightened up a bit and this beer could be more enjoyable."

"Drinkability- I thought this was pretty good. Not my favorite style but still very good for the style."
""
""
"O: I really like this beer, one of the first Black IPA's I actually enjoyed drinking back in the day. If I were to nitpick I wish the black malt was smoother."
""
""
"D: This was an ok black IPA, but the scent and taste weren't overly delicious. The body was excellent, and the finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. Nothing unique or exceptional about this brew, but not bad."
""
""
""
"Thanks to Kirk for the beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell brings pine hops on top a short but present dark malt background. Malt is stronger in the taste, but all the same basic flavors are there. This is is quite drinkable, and the mouthfeel is solid and pleasing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: While I wish there was a bit more malt backbone to counter the hops, the beer works nicely. The beer needs some stronger flavors to pair with in regards to food. I tried chicken schnitzel but it clashed a bit - I think the recommendation on the bottle of beef or lamb would have been right. The beer definitely needs to warm up a bit before drinking though. When first poured and still fairly cold, it's more bitter than anything else and the other flavors get lost. After warming up all of the flavors come out and that chlorine smell goes away. In the end, a good beer, but not sure I'd buy again. As for drinkability, I found that I drank it up fairly quickly, but I was sated after completing the whole bottle - I did not want another."
""
""
"Pours a pitch black hue I can't believe it doesn't have black patent malt, extremely light tan head forms thick and dwindles slowly. Fat chunky lacing spans the sides of my chalice. Aroma herbal earthy with a kick of resinous pine. The Chinooks really do complement the dark Black IPA quite well it's in line with the Troeg's Porter that packs loads of Chinook. Flavors are dark bitterness from the roasted barley and massive hop additions, I get bitter dark chcocolate and loads of pine sap and other assorted hop resins at 92 IBUs this is definitely an IPA...coats the palate with the bitterness aspects of the hop. Mouthfeel finishes each sip with a lingering bitterness medium bodied smooth natural carbonation, going strong keeps each sip worthy of the next. Overall an impressive black IPA a nice transition from the malt liquor formerly known as Dad's Little Helper."
""
""
""

"Its a good brew...its a different kind of bitter...more roasty bitter than hop bitter but still has some nice flavor. Solid brew but better black ipas are out there."

"Overall- While I am not a fan of IPAs, I am developing a taste for black IPAs. This is a decent example of the style. Just enough hops to fit the style but not so much to suck all the moisture out of your face."

"Overall enjoying this one sitting out on main street with my nachos. Not the best but a plenty enjoyable beer."

"Overall - Knowing Rogue's ability to nail complex malt profiles balanced by a strong hop presence, I had high expectations for this one. The generic cocoa flavored malt profile underwhelmed me, odd considering the use of 5 different malts, and though a bit of redemption was found in the strong citrus hop finish, the general impression I have of this beer leaves me wanting. Simply, the malt is too sweet and a roast touch non-existent. The flavor, especially that sweet cocoa, reminds me a quite bit of Moylan's Orange and Black Congrats, except this finds balance in the bitter hop back end. For the price, I think I'll pass on giving this another go."
"I'd say this is one of Rogue's lazier efforts thus far. Kinda one of those where you're not quite sure what the brewer is getting at. Not outright bad, just...muddled. Kinda makes me wonder if this was a rush replacement for the original for sales reasons. Not buying again, but your mileage may vary."

"Not so much of an IPA….poured form a bomber into a glass. Thin head…lasted, but thinned out. Very little lacing. Black appearance…in the direct light it has a root beerish like look..opaque rather than translucent. Sweet aromas with some light caramel and chocolate...some fruitiness. taste is again sweet chocolate is what I got right off...and brief tart pine like taste again accentuated by what seems herbals. Aroma was more malty than hoppy....this is not an IPA. Mouthful was creamy and smooth...easy at the beginning and lasted a while in the back part of the tongue...it was not at all offensive."

"Bottle. Pours mostly clear and dark brown with a large, creamy, off-white head. Fantastic retention. The aroma is of milk chocolate and caramel – no real hop craziness here. Full-bodied with a milky mouthfeel and modest carbonation. The flavor provides a lot of unsweetened dark cocoa and charcoal, but not much hop bitterness until the fairly bitter, dark chocolate finish."
""

"Interesting combination, but did it really become a good one? Much hops, weak body!"
""
""
""
"O- outstanding beer. This is a black ale with a great hop bitterness. Not an ipa! A black ale. Thats the only thing I have against this beer, the label. The ipa thing is a huge fad right now and a great moneymaker but this is no ipa. Maybe the best dark grains I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not complex but it is very flavorful."
""
"A rather disappointing beer. Rather disjointed as far as everything pulling together; the appearance is the best thing, but the taste, especially, doesn't live up to the promise. A bit more malt presence to tone-down the alcohol notes would be nice. Some decent hop aroma also would be a plus..."
""
"Taste wise, it's got mostly a dry coffee flavor. Full in body, very dry to the palate and slightly warm in the end."
""
""
""
""

"Solid all-around. This version of a black IPA embraces the roasted malt aspect of the style equally with the hops. Malt was not as dense or roasted as the hoppy porters known back in the old days as ""robust porter," but more malt backbone than a hoppy brown ale. Hops were appropriately assertive, but well balanced. One of the better examples of the style."
"Pours a hazy dark brown color with a thick tan colored head that leaves rings of lacing on the glass. A very floral hop aroma with some roasted malt, licorice, and chocolate. More of the same in the flavor. A nice floral hop flavor mixed with a slightly grainy toasted malt. The finish is where the dark chocolate bitterness comes through and leaves a bitter roast flavor on the back of the tongue. Feel is light with peppery carbonation. Pretty good beer. Good flavors and not too heavy like some other black ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark, almost black, and true to its name. Nice head and hangs around well. IPA smell is not immediately present and is masked by the malt. Taste is pleasing with a good amount of malt balancing the beer - hops are harder to detect. Solid beer and even pleased a non-IPA companion."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark ruby-brown coloring with a thin, low profile, filmy, off-white head that starts a solid half an inch and slowly settles into a filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of slight char, a malty backbone, and a subtle, resiny hops profile. Smells well blended, but light overall. Flavors are much more hop prevalent, and hop forward at that, with a resiny, bitter, very tangy hops profile followed directly by a strong roast and char characteristic with kills the bitterness, as well as highlights a subtle malt profile that is underlying on the palate. The aftertaste is tangy and bitter, with a slight drying feel in mouth after a round, robust body. Dry, bitter finish cleans the palate. Very drinkable at a solid 7% ABV...glad it's a bomber."
""
""
"I have to say that my palate is tiring quickly with this brew. Too one dimensional of a bitterness factor. I'm a bit pleased that I don't have more bottles..."
"Overall, there's no doubting this beer's power. But it sure harms its drinkability. Maybe I'll just have one."
""
""
"I don't always like black IPAs but I quite liked this. Poured a 1"" light mocha head of medium life. Body is a deep dark burnt umber brown, almost like coffee. Smells of roasted malt and piney hops. Taste is a roasted malt IPA with coffee and dark chocolate and the zing of the IPA hops. Fairly long finish. Good stuff."
""
"O - Disappointed, I believe a good interpretation of the style to be darker in color, more american in hop smell, cleaner in flavor and thicker in body. All that said, there was a complexity to its smell that was enjoyable and it seemed to have good presentation in terms of head retention and size."
"Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Pretty good, not my favorite style but it grows on me a little."
""
""
""
""
"I tend to avoid Rogue these days, but I can't resist a fresh release of Black IPA. Here we go. Pours black, thin ring of tan head. Herbal hops fight it out with a muted roast malt character - cafe coffee, roasted nuts. Hops continue to press on with their bitter, herbal, peppery, edge. Yeah, its ok for this young style of beer. Nice flavors, big bitterness. But I'm kind of sick of Rogue's shit - rebranding and renaming styles of beer, types of malt, and varietals of hops. Overpriced and under-delivered."
""
""
"Pours dark black with 1/2 inch of white foam. Settles mostly down. Oily pine smell. Like trees. Very light through, for an IPA. Light chocolate malt taste with a firm grassy hop. Firm IPA with a subtle maltiness behind. But more hop than anything else. Bittering holds. Smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
"Full mouthfeel, round and creamy. Okay beer overall, but would have liked more depth of flavor and complexity."
""

"From a bottle, poured into a tulip. Poured very dark brown, almost black. Completely opaque with 4cm of off-white head that leaves lots of lacing. The nose is hard to coax out, but does eventual develop a dark roasted malt, char, and piney, grassy hops hiding underneath. Taste is that of stale coffe, bittersweet chocolate with some grapefruit that just do not play well together. The finish is very long with an unsettling hop bitterness and roasted malt that just sits there on your tongue. The flavors in this beer just seem to bash against each other. Not my favorite black IPA."
""
""
""
"It's a tasty drink and fairly strong on the ""IPA"" side."
""
""
"This beer grew on me and got better as the bomber went down. I like Stone’s Black IPA’s better, but this was a pretty tasty beer and one I’d definitely have again."
"I only tried the Malt Liquor once and cant really remember it so im in two different minds about them changing this to a Black IPA netherless its a style i like so its worth a shot and on pouring did someone say RED IPA or BLACK IPA as pours a very deep copper red hue with a nice two finger creamy head and lacing everywhere,the smell is dark malts,caramel candy and fruity resinous hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and really sessionable with tastes of toffee,caramelised plums,nectarines,candy and finished with bitter fruity hops and overall its alright but for me its more of a Red IPA then a black IPA and im left a little confused."
""
"Overall - Not bad, plenty of flavor just seems like its not balanced perfectly with the malts and hops. Would be better as a ipa or even just a porter other then the styles combined as one. Worth a drink, just not the best black ipa out there."
""
"I haven't bought a Rogue product (other than the totally solid Yellow Snow) for 5 years, but the promise of a BIPA was too much to pass up. Pours an opaque very dark brown with two fingers of dense khaki foam, thick-ish sheeting on the glass. Looks great. Smell: smells like dehusked carafa... just the hint of roast and brown bread, spruce-y and vaguely citric c-hops. Taste: a little roast, some raisin-bread, pine and tangerine. Not amazing, but definitely enjoyable."
""
""

""
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, biscuit, herbal, floral, earth, coffee, pine, and slight citrus. Some decent aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, earth, pine, floral, grapefruit, toast, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, earth, pine, citrus, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bitterness with roasted malt flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly chalky mouthfeel that isn’t detrimental. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a really nice black IPA. This has a good balance between the roasted malt and hop flavors, which I tend to prefer in the style. Very enjoyable stuff."
""
""
"For the style it's a rather good beer and a black IPA with a decent bitter quality. Still a dull style, but this one kind of stands out. It stands out as Rogue beer as well."
""
"This was better than I expected. Aggressively hopped with plenty of roast and char character. Not the total package but very fun to drink."
""
"O - As I sip on it, I'm torn. I wanted it to be more, but it's not bad. I've had a couple better black IPAs, but I've had more that weren't as good as this. Definately a must try."
""
"O - A very enjoyable beer that I'd pick up again. Nothing out of this world, but something a little out of the ordinary that works pretty well."
""
"O - Haters gonna Hate on the surge in this style, but I am a fan and this is a fine example of the style, its strikes a great bold balance of hops and malt, Rogue seldom dissapoints"
"Overall an OK beer, entirely drinkable, but not setting 'my' beer world alight!!!"

"I might be a little Rogue Bias (just because they've sent me a couple of free bottles that I cant get in ohio) but I was extremely impressed with this beer. I don't usually like Black IPA's but this was almost a combination of a smoked porter and an IPA. Had a smooth smokey taste, with a slightly bitter finish. Color was a deep black. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone with a passion for porter's or ipa's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- My first Rogue beer and im now embarrassed to admit it. After having a few beers lately that were just meh, this made my day. This is very similar to the Alpha Klaus Christmas (Xmas) Porter by three floyds that I tried and loved recently. Get this if you cant get that or don't want to pay the 4-5$ difference. Cant wait to try more Rogue."

"brown color with a good clarity to it. A nice rich looking head of light tan rose up from the sides of the glass and reached a height of around two fingers before settling back down with a smooth and even lacing and a nice consistency hugging the glass. Aroma is a good bit hoppier up front then I thought it was going to be as well. This one just seemed to be full of surprises. Rich caramel and earthy grains lie underneath a bouquet of pine like hops. Quite light and very complex. I was extremely open to this one. First sip is smooth, creamy malts that wash across the tongue. Great complexity here now as well. Rich brown ale flavor, creamy, hints of earthy tones and a rich, subtly dry hop presence that seems to build and build. Last sips seem to be equally as well versed in sweet caramel notes as they are in dry, piney hops"
""
"O: Not bad. I've had other American black ales I like better, but this one is not bad. I would have liked to see the roasty, toasty dark malt flavors toned down a bit so the hops could have come across more clearly, but otherwise I have no real complaints with this one. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very disappointing as many Rogue beers are. If still lived in Colorado I doubt I buy any ever again, but still a somewhat viable option where I live..."
""
""
""
"A dark brown/mohogany color with a very healthy off-white head that settles down quickly and surrenders a very thorough lacing throughout. The aroma says chocolate malt with a tasteful touch of herbal hops. Full and beautiful. The flavor follows with a fairly aggressive herbal grass hop, sort of a seaweed bite over a pleasant malt with subtle milk chocolate pleasantries. It’s medium bodied with a somewhat thin but chalky feel that goes down easily with subtle carbonation. The flavors blend so nicely with plenty of hops to bring an easy smile of satisfaction for yet another Rogue success!"
""
" The flavor has more of a coffee accent with the type of acidity you associate with a dark roast, the malt has light caramel backing while the hops come off as bitter but don't really add any flavor to speak of besides a spicy accent to the mild roast component. The finish is dry and it seems to increase in bitterness as it warms if that is possible. The drinkability overall is just above average, I prefer a fruitier more ipa in this style with less roasted grain, but your mileage may vary."
"Overall this is a nice black IPA but nothing special. Worth checking out though if you can get it for a good price."
"Overall: a good session beer with a lot of flavor in my opinion. I wish it was available in 12oz six packs, but that's just a wish. I like this brew, and will definitely pick up some more in the near future and like the tribute to Fathers. Good Job again Rogue!!!"
"Dark ruby red. Clear. Thin beige head. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is chocolatey, roasty, yeasty and hoppy. Taste is solid all around. Roasted malt bitterness mingles with hop bitterness in a nice way. Bitterness is nice and clean. Chocolatey notes add some depth. Moderately carbonated. Good drinking beer."
"O - Pretty solid offering, would have again."
"Definitely worth a try."
"looked great, smelled good but couldn't keep up the pace in the end, at 8$ a bottle I doubt I'll be drinking another anytime soon"
"Overall, great beer, I'd order another pint. That said, it's more porter than IPA, and if you're calling it a Black IPA, I expect some hops."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Deep brown, almost black in color. Poured with a big frosty beige head that stuck around for the duration, leaving lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Combination of light herbal, pine and citrus hop aromas along with dark roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation and a light resinuous feel Flavors constantly change from beginning to end. Starts off with a light milk chocolate flavor that carries through to the end but takes a backseat to all of the other dominant malts and hops. Dark roasted malt flavors come next that transition to coffee into the middle. Then the hops take over. Pine hops with a hint of citrus with the pine slowly intensifying to the finish. Malt flavor transitions from a dark roast flavor to a to burnt malt flavor at the finish as well. Hoppy pine bitter aftertaste but it does linger for long. Lots of great aromas and flavors. This was a great brew."
"O - This is a nice black ale."
"O: 4.0 for effort. Care clearly went into crafting this beer even if the outcome is not entirely to my liking. I would recommend trying it, even if I wouldn't have another."
"I liked this one. I've had stouts that were overhopped and it didn't work (see Hoppin Frog Black and Tan). This managed to get a nice taste balance between the two, yet it is a black IPA. Nicely done."
"OD- The intensity of all of these flavors would make it hard to drink more than one, but I can still enjoy it. No hint of booziness. Nothing too spectacular, but a solid and satisfying beverage."
"The beer was a decent experience, but not really one I will be repeating."
"Dark, dark IPA that was unique to my palette. Like most of Rogue's stuff, it's just a really great beer. Nothing ground-breaking, but thoroughly enjoyable. Left a little to be desired in the hop department, but the darker color and taste gave it a different experience. Had it with a pork chop and the two made music together, and would definitely pick it up again."
"Pours a dark, deep brown/black. Nice fluffy toffee colored head. Light lacing for the first half of the glass until the head dissipated. Smell was roasty and interesting. Taste didn't hit the ""IPA"" hoppy note for me. The bitterness seemed to be coming from the roasted malts, and less from any sort of hopping. Coffee notes, roasted malt, and bitterness dominated the flavor. Mouthfeel was standard. Overall not bad, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Rogue Dad's Little Helper Black IPA is an opaque black beer with brown highlights. It's topped with a generous, lumpy, light khaki foam that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a very grassy aroma with a hint of malt and maybe caramel. It has a smooth medium body with a soft, dry finish. It leaves the tongue a little ashy. The flavor is well balanced between charred roastiness, grassy bitterness and a touch of melanoid. There isn't really any sweetness and the flavor is quite smooth. The aftertaste is charred. This is very smooth and sessionable. The flavor isn't extreme, but it kept my interest the whole time I was drinking it."
"This beer pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights. The head is big, off-white, and retains and laces very well. The aroma is quite nice, it's got a solid leafy hoppiness on top of a solid amount of roastiness. This one tastes mostly like a hoppy porter. The chocolate and roasted coffee tastes really dominate, with the hops providing some extra character. The mouthfeel is nice enough, it feels a little watery, but is otherwise nice. The drinkability is this brew's strong suit, this goes down very easily for 7%. Overall, a solid hoppy porter, not sure if it's deserving of being called a Black IPA, but still tasty for sure."
"O: In general, I think Rogue is an overrated brewery, but Dad's Little Helper is a well made and drinkable beer. Very easy to like."
"Final thought - $5 a 22oz and a 7% ABV. This one is for fathers and fathers day"
"This is more of what I think a Black IPA should be like (apparently not knowing what the style is), this is a perfect balance between roasted malts and hops, this is one of the better beers I've ever had (and this coming from a guy who normally doesn't get Rogue drinks, although that might change now)."
"O- Meh. Kinda wish I ordered something else. It's not bad- but my mind kept drifting towards stone's sublimely self-righteous while I had this."
"Overall, this is only my second black ipa and from what I remember off the top of my head I enjoyed Sublimely Self Righteous much better. However, for fans of the style its worth a try."
"O – This is easily one of the best blipa’s I’ve had to date. Fantastic blend of dark roasted malts alongside the leafy hops. Highly recommended for fans of this style as it will surely not disappoint."
"While not unpleasant in the least, but its not readily approachable either. It never gains a true identity, nothing coheres."
"Overall - I liked it a lot; kind of the love-child between a stout and IPA, getting the best from both worlds. Great coffee taste and smooth mouthfeel while still having a hoppy/bitter punch."
"O: nice beer from out west"
"As a huge fan of porters and IPAs I thoroughly enjoyed this one for its very well balanced and brings out all the lovely flavors of roasted malts and hops together without any intensity. Porters have that great dark, yet light bodied coffee flavor with slight bitterness that some people cannot resist, while IPAs have, depending on which one, citrusy and piney hop character. This beer combines all of these flavors very well, in what is in my opinion a well balanced beer with just enough complexity. I highly recommend this mostly because its a perfect example of the style and is highly available most of the year. Stay thirsty my friends."
"On tap at Elis on the day off before the trav champ with the Larse. Dark brown body with an off white head. Smells nice and piney with some citrus and dark malt. Tastes nice and bitter. The coffe comes second. Smooth feel to it like all of the rogue beers. Overall a solid black ipa."
"Overall. Good dark ipa. Not as nice or pronounced as others of the same style in the dark portion, but nice and hoppy for the ipa part."
"Overall I am not a fan. I wouldn't reach for this again. All well. Rogue still brews my personal fav.."
"Dad's Little Helper pours an intimidating black. The light cream colored head maxes out at about three fingers in height before slowly creeping down the glass. Lacing is left in a web pattern along the glass. The nose is burnt, roasty grains first, and some earthy and piney hops second. I'd really prefer to see the two switch places in terms of relative potency. The flavor maintains that same (unfortunte) balance, and the roasty malt character crosses the line a little bit into an acrid, burnt flavor. That's only accentuated by the mid palate bitterness. The earthy-herbal and pine hop notes do their best to soften everything that came before, but it's not enough. Body is about as mid-sized as I'd expect for a 7% beer, and carbonation is a little bit less than I'd expect, but still works well. To me, Black IPAs are a tough style to get right, the specialty grain to hops balance can be very sensitive, and ultimately Dad's Little Helper doesn't quite work out."
"Overall: I am a proud Rogue fan. There is not much I do not like from Rogue. Unfortunately, this was not one that impressed me, and when looking again for this particular style I will go steer away from Rogue."
"Right off the bat, I've got to say this is both a quintessential example of the style, but distinctly Rogue. There's that same sort of cookie note that comes off the Mocha Porter and Shakespeare Stout. There's a ripping grapefruit and pine hop character under big (but not heavy) roasted grains. The malts come off a bit like an amped up Irish stout. The finish is a mix of dark, bitter roasted grains and citrus rind hops. My only complaint is that the aroma is a bit muted."
"O: like I started with the style is not right and a drastic change from the original. It is OK at best, there are better B-IPAs out there."
"O: Well, I really was expecting a lot more IPA hoppiness at the start, and this one is slanted a lot more to the roasted malt side. Nevertheless, quite tasty and I would buy it again. Give it a try."
"M: lightly carbonated, perfect for a heavier beer such as this."
"Overall, like I mentioned, this tastes more like a porter. I was looking forward to more of a balance between the hops and roasted flavor. Not bad but I don't think I will be searching for this again in a bottle but I would try it on tap if I had the chance."
"Dark brown almost black opaque body, broken tan head, no visible carbonation due to dark hue. Nose is pretty roasty, some floral hops (?), ends with resinous hops once it warmed. Taste mirrors nose, got progressively bitter on the backend, creeper, I was still tasting the resin on way out to car. Mouthfeel is coating, oily. Not bad, once John gets his CDA groove back on look out for the return of Skull Spliter!"
"Very nice black IPA."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Nice four finger head with a dark, almost black color to the body. Not quite black like a stout, but more like a porter. Some roasted notes in the nose along with spicy hops. Piney bitterness up front with the chinook hops. The roasted malt flavor goes through in the middle and then that piney bitterness shows up in the end. The body is medium and there is a slight astrigency from the roasted malt. IMO, this is an over-hopped porter. i guess it's worth a try, but not a plus."
"Poured a blackish body with one-finger head that dies quick and left a little lace patch or two. A sturdy, malty aroma of roasted, some coffee or toffee maybe, touch of caramel sweentess and only a hint of citric hop. Taste is more of the same and while alright, this is like an OK stout more than a black IPA. I get dry, roasted, bready malts and some sweetness as well in a fuller than regular IPA body, but I'm not getting much hop action at all. The carbonation and touch of hops lead to some semblance of balance and a little crisp finish, but the minor citric fruit flavors and sweet malt are overpowered. A decent beer but not my first choice if I want this style."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice mix of citrus hops and roasted malts. There is a dry, earthy character as well that adds a bit of complexity to the aroma. The taste is good. It has an outstanding bitter hop bite up front along with a solid malt base that boasts of pale, roasted, and patent malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable black IPA. It has a little more malt character than most which does hide a little of the hop character, but it's still quite enjoyable."
"Overall, this is an aggressively hopped black ale. Heed the warning that is called an IPA, although Rogue will probably give it fifty other names."
"Pours a deep burnt brown color with a half inch creamy tan head and good retention of lacing. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate and vanilla, and burnt bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is of burnt nuts, earthy, some coffee, malty, dry with some hops. Slightly smokiness is detected. Finishes with a very earthy coffee taste. For a black IPA, this is pretty tasty. I dig."
"Overall it's not a bad try at a black IPA."
"Medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is rather sippable and close to thirst-quenching. The carbonation helps to move the beer along, but also allows the flavors to persist just a bit too long."
"The CPJ"
"O: Had I been drinking this blind, there is no way I would have ever guessed it a American Black Ale, there was no evidence of hops in either the aroma or flavor profile. The smell and taste aren't bad...just not to style."
"D - This is pretty bad - it was a struggle to work through my pint even for the discounted price of $4. My liver has better things to do."
"D - Very representative of Rogue with their standard dry malt profile and a balance that favors harshly bitter hops. It works well up until the finish, but the hop bitterness and dry, burnt toast malt character both amplify one another in the aftertaste and become unpleasant and acrid. The price on this bottle was more reasonable that what I have come to expect from Rogue in recent years, but it still reminds me why I no longer drink a lot of their beer; they have made some classics, but they have also made a lot of beer that tastes like burnt toast."
"O - In the bottle, this is a great ABA, but the cask was largely unbalanced and off. I wish it had melded more completely..."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"drinkability: nice offering by rogue and nailing down a style."
"A good beer that I hope to enjoy again soon."
"Beer is medium in body and REALLY BITTER. Aside from this beer being probably 70-75 IBU, it is not an IBU. It is a really bitter brown porter from what I can tell. It is not a black ale in the sense that you can taste all those chinook hops. Overall it was fine but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that likes IPAs but if you want an interesting porter, knock yourself out."
"Rogue always gets a fantastic malt taste in my opinion. Always getting that sweet thick and robust malt taste. You can definitely tell they put a lot of different types of malts in here. Since its so highly roasty and sweet the hop flavors just mix in with that sweetness and try to push through the malts with a citrus graepfruity taste. Like I said though it ultimately ends with a pine/coffee roasted taste. Definitely a ridiculously top notch beer. This is my 2nd favorite Black IPA of all time right behind Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale.This definitely comes well recommended."
"overall, its a good beer. As most Rogue beers are, its good. However, its not great. many other better choices for dollars less than this one."
"Overall, a good beer that I will try again but I won't go out of my way to have it. I feel that Back In Black and Alpine Black IPA are better choices."
"On tap last week at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass near pitch black with a thin light tannish colored head atop.Roast and dark stone fruit aromas slightly overtop of piney hops,the hops were not quite as assertive as I thought they would be coming from Rogue.Piney hops are more assertive on the palate really providing a good punch,the dark malt and slight roastiness provides good balance.A solid ABA,good hops and a good dark malt profile."
"O - This is a pretty good take on the style; more hoppy, less malty, and a bit lighter overall than the (fledgling) style norm."
"O: Not a winner. It looks good, smells OK, but goes downhill from there. Could use more balance: some sweet malt to offset that harsh roasted bitterness."
"Dad’s Little Helper tastes almost like a black English IPA — nearly roasty enough to be considered a porter, but with the subdued and earthy hops that exemplify British styles."
"With the (haltingly welcome) preponderance of Black IPAs hitting the market as of late, it's nice to see this big West Coast player jumping into the fray. And jump do they ever - the formula ain't complicated and Rogue pretty much nails it. Roasted and hoppy. Get used to it, I guess, at least for the time being."
"Overall. It's probably not a real close 'black ipa' more of a very hoppy stout. But being that this style is still new and argued over it's still a very good brew."
"Very tasty take on the style. Opaque body with significant lace, small white head. Complex inviting aromas of hops and some roast. Above average mouthfeel. Well malted, very drinkable.Not the typical Cascadian hops: Newport, Chinook & Rogue Micro Hopyard Rebel Hops."
"This is a nice tasting, pleasant beer. Loom forward to seeing how it goes with my burger!"
"This isn't a west coast hop bomb. Rather, it's a subtle and shall I say, balanced example of the style. It deserves an A for effort."
"4/4/3.5/3.5/4"
"- Overall this is a good CDA.. but doesn't quite top a few of the others that are out there. For the price this should be a double. The bitterness is this beers highlight."
"I am guessing but this alcohol here couldn’t be very high. As a result this beer doesn’t really seem to be a substituted for something like Avery’s 17th or Stone Sublimely Self Righteous. It also seems to be needing that extra push to have a thicker body and perhaps a bit more malt flavor to work here. A decent beer, but not one I’d seek out again."
"This is a very nice beer, but the dominace of roast and sharp piney bitterness creates some astringency and sharpness that prevents the beer from the pleasant dryness that other examples of the style exhibit. It's just a hair off of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale."
