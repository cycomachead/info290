"So much left to be desired from my first New Holland brew."

"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, 2014 bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice crisp bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, an OK sweet fruity black IPA."

"Overall, a very drinkable black IPA.  Although Beer Advocate recommends a lower serving temp of 40F, the beer is more tasty at higher temps: the fruit , sweetness, and chocolate are more prominent."
""
"This beer nicely separates the hop aroma and the malt flavors yet balances everything out to make for an enjoyable beverage. The hops shine in the aroma primarily and the malts make for a rich and tasty dark grain treat. Sure, there's some overlap with these things, and that's where the subtle balance comes through. Easy drinking dark ale..."

"To the Point: if you are looking for bold citrus – keep looking; nice aromatic hops with a solid robust style from the roasted grains; when the roasted grains and the aromatic hops work together Black IPAs are pretty good; they are still not a favorite in my book but, I am liking them more and more when I get a good one – and this is a very good Black IPA;"

"Pours a deep brown with a frothy tan head. Aroma is lightly roasty, a bit nutty, with a string citrus presence. Flavor has some dark chocolate notes that add intrigue. There's a bit of phenolic character at the finish. Fairly characterful brew. The hops don't clash with the malt."

"Overall- A good example of a black IPA. One of the better beers that I have tried of this style."

"O: An incredibly approachable, easy-going American black ale. It is more simplistic and straight-forward than many other examples of the style, but this actually works in its favor. More balanced and with a better integration of flavors than many ales of this style, I recommend this one highly to fans of hoppy dark ales."

"O- Rye Hatter is one of my favorite beers, so I was expecting much more from this one. When my wife asked me how it was, I paused for a minute and finally answered, ""It's confused."" I'll stick with Rye."

"Black Hatter is a dark beer pointed in bright citrus fruits, carob, dried Provence herbs and minty flavours. Hopheads will rejoice: So gloriously luscious! And indeed they should (especially at $4.99/bomber). That said, it does lack the rich mocha notes and muscularity of the style's best examples which makes it a somewhat incomplete example. Still, I definitely enjoyed it."

"Edit: after warming - a little more spiciness comes out in the taste. Upgraded slightly."

"O: A milder, gentler, better balanced black IPA without the clashing flavors of some others."

"I could not see myself hanging around on July 4th drinking these all day. I could see drinking one or two. Would buy again!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Good carbonation level. Intense citrus hop aroma is very inviting and leaves me wanting for more. Intense hop taste and mild carbonation tickles the tongue fading into dark malt flavor. Not a ton of roasted malt flavor, but enough for me. Viscous mouthfeel. Excellent!"

"Okay black IPA. Very forgettable. Nothing I'd seek out."

"O: I think this is slightly better than the overall average here on BA, especially considering the price."

"Trying the Black Hatter...and I think it is pretty good. Another fine creation by Holland. The beer pours a almost opaque black with teh deep ruby hugh. The head is at least a finger thick and is leaving a lace. The smell has very fine hoppy with pine leaning tones. There is not much in the form of roast or malt. The taste is a bit bitter than I would prefer from a black ipa....would like a bit more roast and malt to start and then let the hops clean the pallete. The beer has a light to moderate body with smooth carbonation. Overall it isnt bad....but definitely not the best. I like the flavor with the lower abv which makes this a potential session brew."
""
""
"O: This was a different take on IPA. The darker malt did not provide a strong enough backbone to support the hops. It lacked the sweetness necessary for balance. And, the hops flavors were one dimensional and almost harsh. Overall, it was okay, but not something I would go very far out of my way to find."
"O: Very nice and a good CDA. Will buy again, especially since it's only $4.50 for a bomber. I'd order another."
""
""

"for the price, this is great. i will buy a few more."

"Smooth tasting but a little flat also. Finishes semi dry and semi bitter. A solid offering from the boys at New Holland."
""
"O: Overall a decent cascadian ale. Flavor was decent, but felt it fell just a bit short of being a solid good (4.0) rating with a linear complexity and lacked that spike or stand out quality. End of the day a good example, respectable, worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice roasty and chocolaty flavor with some nice hoppy accents. While not the greatest black IPA it is rather tasty."
""
"I’m a big fan of New Holland’s The Poet stout but haven’t been that impressed anytime I’ve tried their Mad Hatter IPA. I view this beer as a very pleasant surprise and one I would purchase again."
""
"This beer pours pitch black with some blood red around the edges. The beer has a hop dominant nose. There is an impressive amount of citrus notes as well as a heap of pine needles. The flavor is also all about the hops, the pine and citrus come through full force. There is not a ton that would give away the ""black"" part of the beer other then the appearance, the roasted malts and other dark flavors aren't too strong. However this beer drinks really well and is a worthy version of the original."
""
""
""
"Not a stand out in this growing style but not bad either. At $5, it's not a bad value either. "
""
"O: Might be my favorite of the Hatter variants. Pretty decent."
"This is my first foray into Black Ales, but I will definitely heed the other reviews and look at others in the genre."
""
"The feel is good, about a medium body with a brightness to it that seems to contradict its thick, dark look. Crispness never fades and it's smooth underneath."
"A good black ale, this above par for New Holland, one I would reccomend"

"Dark pour, inch head, great lacing. Smells like an IPA. Tastes like an ale with a bit of slightly smoky malt with a decent amount of hops. Roasted malt is prominent in this blend and works well adding balance to this beer. Unique and very drinkable. If you get a chance to pick this one up, go for it. One of my favorites from New Holland."
"Bottle pours deep black with a big off white head, some ruby coming through the light on the edges. Smells of pine hops and lots of roasty malts. Very nice. Flavor is hop forward, with lots of pine, some earthiness, and then a good bit of roast. Creamy finish on this one and rather pleasant. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Overall, this was actually pretty decent."
"Pours opaque black with a two and half finger off-white head. The aroma of pine, citrus rind and roasted malt, although a bit more understated rises from the glass. Pine and citrus rind dominate the opening of this brew which transitions to a mild dark chocolate roastiness, and then finishes dry with citrus-like bitterness and a touch of roasted malt. Adequate carbonation, lighter-medium bodied brew. I've had Black IPA's I liked more, but I've also had some I didn't like as much. A solid, tasty brew."
"The beer is pleasurable enough to drink, but the problem is that the beer has a tough time competing with the black IPA of Southern Tier, Stone, or Rockers."
"o - pretty good, but doesn't hold a candle to the stone or deschutes takes on the style. i actually prefer regular mad hatter over this version. worth a try i guess but not a beer i'd drink often."
""
""
"O. A decent beer. Drinkable with a manageable amount of hops"
"Overall, this is a tasty black IPA. I'd definitely buy it again."
""
"Medium bodied, average carbonation, and has a ruby red grapefruit aftertaste. A good Black IPA / American Black Ale which I recommend trying if you get the chance."
""
"Not bad but not great. Nothing really stands out. It's smooth and drinkable, but ultimately forgettable."
"Not my favorite ABA. Very overwhelming. The malt bill needs to be more in your face."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pints glass. The beer was a thin black, giving a distinct hoppy aroma. On the intial taste, my first thought was green olives. These are good on a pizza, but bad in a beer. This was accompanied by the sensation of a strong licorice taste. For an IPA, the hops were rather mild. If it did not say IPA on the bottle, I might not have guessed the style. The mouthfeel was thin, making the experience end quickly. This was help along by the blast of carbonation which probably caused the bottle to foam over in the first place. Obviously, this was not a well balanced beer."
"Appears black from a distance, but up close you notice quite a bit of light coming through revealing more of a cola color. Forms a moderate sized light tan head colored head. Some mild lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and citrus, but the combination doesn't work so well resulting in a slightly metallic note. The taste Is similar with some lightly roasted malts, grapefruit, and a mild acidic quality that seems very out of place. Not a whole lot of hops or roasted malts or coffee for that matter. Medium bodied. Appropriate carbonation. Mild bitterness."

"O - A pretty good black ale, but not something I would get again."
"Pours black bodied with thick beige soapy head that leaves 3/8 of an inch retained head. Pleasant Cascadian citrus aromas, and inviting. Creamy mouthfeel, spot on the style. good drinkability. Roast, some citrus and decent hop bitterness.Thanks for bringing back Chris."
"Crisp and resiny palate, not a session beer for me, but flavor and worth trying again, and sharing."
"O: So hard to put into words. The flavors aren't necessarily the best, but they somehow complement each other surprisingly well. The orange/malt combo with the pop of mint has a dessert-like quality. More importantly, since it's so complex, I just kept going back for more, because I felt it was impossible that a beer tasted like that on the previous sip. Whackadoo."
"I have liked the Hatter series, but much like the Rye, this comes up quite short when compared to the Oak aged, which is by far superior and the top of the group."
"O: decent, interesting brew. It was $4 for a 22oz in Chicago, but I'd like to try it on tap at New Holland to see what it's like. Drinkable for a glass, but don't have 2."
"O: I'm glad I tried this on, I tend to like dark beers and IPAs and this one did a really good job combining the two."
"Overall: Very pleasant beer. Surprised to catch notes of mint in the nose. Not a common beer smell, not an unpleasant one though. Silk-like texture with low carbonation made this black IPA surprisingly smooth."
"Deep reddish brown body, good garnet highlights when held up to bring light, no visible carbonation. 1/2 finger light tan head, slow dissipation with good retention, minimal lacing. Nose is, err, off to say the least, latex band aids, significant dose of roasted malt, hops negligible in the nose. Taste is fairly roasty, hard to get by the aroma, but there's a pronounced lack of Cascadia hops, the label mentions Centennial but having a hard time detecting much else. Mouthfeel is medium not much effervescence. It was hard to try and enjoy this after the strange aroma profile. Pass."
"A decent black IPA, although not as good as others I've had before, like the Thornbridge Raven Black. Also, a decent IPA offering by New Holland, though not as good as its oak-aged sibling. If you're looking to complete the Mad Hatter series, definitely give it a try. Otherwise, I personally find it to be a rather forgettable entry in the black IPA market."
"The taste was appealing. After moving furniture most of the day, I was very thirsty. The first impression is of the dark roasted malt, then the hops came through."
"It's tasty, and overall a good brew. I good IPA, but it's definitely somewhat of a disconnected American Black Ale."
"Pretty good."
"Medium bodied with a good balance of dry, bitter, earthy hops and deep roasted malt. There’s a blast of bitter earthy hops up front with hints of soil and pine which is countered by some sweet citrus. The citrus character isn’t as strong as the nose suggests with faint hints of grapefruit and citrus rind. The dryness from the hops is complimented by the deep roasted malt flavor. Hints of coffee bean, dark chocolate, burnt toast and licorice. Overall this was okay but not the best of the style. Decent balance but the hop profile is one dimensional and the malt presence is a bit heavy for my liking."
"Loved the Rye but missed me on the Black Ale!!"
"Overall: This is a really good, low alcohol black IPA. Lots of flavor and feel. Not over the top, but very solid."
"I had high hopes for this one and they were completely dashed. This isn't anything like what I want from a good CDA or black ale, or what have you. I'm far less inclined to try the others in the Hatter series. I drainpoured half the bottle."
"D: This was a very nice black IPA with perfect balance of mostly hops complemented by dark malts. It had good body too, with no alcohol noticeable, so it was very easy to drink. One of the better examples of this style. Recommended."
"O - This is a very nice black ale. These Hatter variations have been pretty nice."
"My favorites in this style category tend to be above 7% ABV (excluding RJ Rockers' Black Perle, which I didn't love)...and this one doesn't buck that trend. New Holland beers are usually nothing less than excellent, but this one, although not a total loss, is something I have no interest in buying again."
"Enjoyed this more than the Oak Barrel Hatter."
"A fine beer. Pretty drinkable, but seems to be missing something. I would call this a good introduction to the style. Fairly priced beer as well, although I won't reach for this one again personally."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, hints of coffee, chocolate, and sweet oatmeal. In the taste, pine like hops and small presence of coffee, although a bit watery. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry pine hop in the aftertaste. More a porter, small hops, just about average."
"With the low ABV as it is, this is one of those ""sessionable"" beers. It doesn't really do anything badly by my book. I searched and searched in vain for the metallic aftertaste so many other BAs have described but I could not find it in my bomber. One hopes that perhaps they may have fine-tuned out some kind of problem that used to exist. I'll be looking for this one again next time I am in a black IPA mood."
"Overall, I wasn't very impressed with this Hatter variation. The flavors didn't mesh well and the aftertaste is foul."
"O: After I got past the initial bad impression of off flavors, this opens up to be a pretty nice beer. I'd certainly buy this again."
"Overall, a very nice, balanced, ABA. Not too roasty. Roast malt and hop bitterness pair nicely."
"Overall it was a good beer, not great, but solid. Love the bitterness and roastiness combination, but not a fan of the metallic aftertaste and the lackluster aroma."
"O- A nice try on a new style of Mad Hatter for New Holland. I think they went a little too safe and it shows as this is not more than a average beer. The ABV is light making it drinkable for many pints over but I would just stick to one and then go onto something else."
"Notes: Another nice offering in the Hatter series, with this price-quality ratio I would not mind picking it up again when it hits the shelves fresh."
"O- Nicely done.. Pick this one up if you haven't checked it out yet, it's worth it."
"Overall - Not very impressed with this. Its too bitter, lacks flavor, and too thin and mild. Black ipa's are getting popular now, i hope new holland reworks this brew, not something i want again."
"Pours black with some reddish edges with cinnamon head that leaves lacing. Aroma of wet grass, lemon, roast, toast and slight cinnamon. Tastes of wet grass, earth, vegetation, lemon, roast, toast, cinnamon sticks, burnt bread toward the finish and then goes clean. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavors are aggressive and unbalanced. An attack of malt vs hops with no cohesion."
"I am a big fan of the original Mad Hatter IPA, and this one is a nice variety on it. Would like to have it again soon."
"O: This is a good, well made, easy to like beer. Very drinkable."
"overall this is 100x better then the oaked mad hatter and is a solid low abv ABA @ only 5.5%"
"i liked this one. i'm a fan of new holland's regular mad hatter ipa, and this was a great variation of it. the citrus/pine of the ordinary hatter shone through very well. the roasty/malty notes came afterwards, with a strong emphasis on coffee, and then back to the citrus/pine and bitterness."
"O: Not my favourite black ale. Drinkable if you can get past the bitter herbs, but I won't be having another. I might dry one out of the bottle..."
"O - like the lower alcohol, enough of the black element to make it complex, would love to see it in 6 packs, and it was 5 bucks a bomber"
"O - I am very happy with this beer, if it was sold in 6 pack I would go to it on occasion. I wish more breweries would produce more normal strength versions of this style. Good change of pace."
"D- it's time to put the whole black IPA fad to rest. If your going to do it do it well or skip it."
"Overall, this was a disappointing brew. I really enjoy black IPA's, but this one was below par. I followed this brew up with a Sublimely Self-Righteous ale, and the Stone beer was far superior."
"Drinkability: A very impressive brew from New Holland Brewing. A good style of beer too."
"D_Very very drinkable."
"D- Pretty easy to drink and a nice little twist to their IPA."
"Drinkability:This is a very interesting beer, with subtle qualities."
"Had this charm on tap at reverend's and i must say besides the imperial hatter this is probably the best of the series. A very malty BLACK hatter. A truly rare beer that should probably be bottled sometime. Not very hoppy but still a verry good brew."
"on tap at brewpup (july 2007) poured a deep dark brown with a miniscule tan head. Aroma is of roasted malts with some herbal hop notes. medium bodied with a roasted chocolate malt flavor backed with some citrus and floral hop notes, and a nice bitter finish. A solid beer"
"This is a nice, drinkable beer, and easy tweak for them to use their IPA recipe and throw in alternative specialty grains. I inquired whether they considered it a porter or stout and the reply was that it's their IPA with dark grains. I'd have to agree with the first reviewer that it's most like an American stout, but not as complex or rich."
"Pours a dark brown murky color, with a nice off white head. Slightly roasty aroma combines with a floral, piney hop aroma. Seems like a cross between an IPA and a porter. There are some roasty flavors, combining with some sweetness and floral hoppy flavors. Bitterness seems to work well with the light roasty flavors. Maybe a bit thin, but carbonation seemed right. A very interesting think here, hard to classify but certainly worth looking at. Big thanks to BAs macallister and pixel for sharing this with me!"
"A smokey dark chocolate roasted malt quality. Hints of caramel help balance the rough edges of the chewy hops. The beer drinks more like a hopped up porter than an american stout. The rough tannins of the hops do hurt the mouthfeel somewhat."
"Deep mohagany pour with black in the middle. Medium but durable tan head atop. Smells really roasty and sweet with a nice hop twinge in there as well. Roasted chocolate flavor with some herbal qualities. I really liked it. Tasted similar but wasn't quite as enjoyable. This still was quite good. Stronger roasted flavors, almost smoky at times, but they are tempered by the piney flavor of the hops. I always thought Hatter would be solid with a more stouty profile and I was right. Give it a try if you're at the pub."
