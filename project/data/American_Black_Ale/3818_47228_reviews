"Rich hoppy flavors, easy to drink, really enjoyed this one. A big sweetness that's incredibly handled and doesn't disturb in the slightest."

"O- this is the first black ale that had such an emphasis on citrusy hops, it was quite the contrast with the chocolate/coffee malt notes.  Very good overall, hides the alcohol well   4"
"I really enjoyed this Imperial Black Ale. Could become a regular staple."

"O: I love black ales and lagers. Unfortunately, I don't see enough of them. I would definitely get this again."

"Overall this is one heck of a beer, if you see this one and don't buy it you are wrong and hurting no one but yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not as bitter as I might like and very floral for something so masculine. Surprisingly crisp. Might not seek it out a-purpose but tasty never the less. I might prefer something less floral and acidic and a bit more bitter."
"Not bad but not great... Disappointing"

"Pours a dark black with a nice light head. The smell was very light and citrus in contrast to the color. A lot of floral and citrus notes. The taste was very nice. A clean finish that was very refreshing while having a good body and flavor to go along with it. I found a lot of orange flavor to it. The only thing I would have liked was more malt, to give more flavor on the end and give it a bit thicker body."
""
""
""
""
""
"This black ale pours a very near black color with a thick off white head that leaves beautiful silky lacing. The nose is shockingly malty and one note. All roasted malt and little to nothing else. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and smooth and creamy. The flavor is much better than the nose with some hops, chocolate, coffee, and dried fruit added to the roasted malt character. It is still quite sweet for the style. I'm not sure if I just have a bottle that is slightly past its prime or if this is what the brewer was going for. It is far maltier than most of the American black ales I've had; more reminiscent of a dopplebock or a belgian dark ale. I'd really like to try a bottle of this that I knew was fresh to see if this was the intention or just a victim of time. Good none the less."

"Taste throughout is a mix of roasted malt and pine, burnt bitter aftertaste but enough sweetness to not be overwhelming, carbonation is medium with an average body."
""
""
"O- This black ale is deep without being rude. Tons of flavor and feel from the dark side. Roasted malts mingling with a bitter hop backbone makes for an interesting conversation. And that ain't no lie. Good sippin' brew but could fill you up. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Interesting beer that I feel I could easily pick out of a line up of black ales. That tanginess is unmistakable. For all I know, this beer is mildy infected, but whether it is or isn't, that little sort of funk is more than welcome. Bursting with resinous hops, a roasty character on the finish, alcohol that's not shy to show itself... a very interesting, enjoyable beer. Well worth the $2.49, because this was an experience worth having. Would have it again, for sure."

"Maybe it's possible I got a bad bottle? There was something a little off with the smell. And then at the initial taste, this quite off-putting heavy alcohol aroma hits. Completely ruins this otherwise-good beer for me. But again, with people praising this beer and rating it so highly, I'll have to try it again and adjust my review. But until then I have to rate it poorly."
""
""

"O: A really well executed and surprisingly balanced take on an American black ale. I could definitely see myself picking this one up again in the not too distant future."

"I'm impressed with this beer and would buy it again. This is a great beer. It's appearance and smell weren't anything special, but it had a thick and rich mouthfeel and it's taste was rich and full. There wasn't any chalky or metallic taste and it hid its high alcohol content well."

"O-very much enjoyed this one. Drinkable by full of flavor. Nice twist on a traditional black ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: I really like this beer. The body is on the lighter side for an imperial, and it doesn't have that syrupy mouth-coating quality you sometimes find in imperials, but it has a nice layering of flavors, with maybe the alcohol showing up a bit too much. Overall very good."
""
""
""

"O-this beer has the taste and the aftertaste ans was a great beer"
"The beer poured very well with good viscosity and a nice thick head. The smell was our favorite aspect as it sniffed very very well. The taste was good but had a pretty harsh aftertaste. Mouthfeel was good and overall was a very good imperial black ale. I would recommend anyone to that hasn't tried and imperial black ale before as it's much easier on the palate."
""
""
"The limited amount of head is minute but last for an extended period of time. Roasted and phonolic aroma. Flavor is a bit alcoholic, warming to the throat and cleanly roasted. maybe a little raisin flavor too. A good, solid, black ale...no messing around...not super fancy...solid...enjoyable...luxurrious..."

"O: I enjoyed it, but I thought the booziness somewhat eclipsed the more subtle elements. Perhaps apt, given the name."

"To me the darker flavours are so integral to the success of a black ale. This seems more like an IPA that happens to look dark, and even then it's a bit flighty and fruity and lacking in gravitas. Can't say I love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big drink, but it's not overwhelming. You don't necessarily feel the need to have to slow down and sip; you do it because it's very enjoyable. I had a bit of trouble figuring out particular hints that I noticed with each smell and taste. The pepper and alcohol were the first things to come to mind, but it's not as if they dominated the taste. I couldn't quite place much more. I noticed a sweet vanilla hint in the smell, and it seems like there was a grape taste present. Of course, I didn't want to get totally lost in figuring out what the smells and tastes were and forget to enjoy it. The sum of the parts make this a great brew. I will get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are so many great black / Cascadian ales out there, and this is not my favorite. I think the molasses flavor is a little much for the style and the hops flavors are good but just not quite what I want. But this is just quibbling: this is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I think that this was one heck of a great ale and more than deserving of it's present rating of 92. This beer had an incredible balance of hops, bitterness, and malt. I will definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable take on the style. I will get this one again!"
""
""
"Anyway, bottom line is: it's a solid black ale. I still like Hop in the Dark and certain others better, and I'm glad this wasn't any more expensive than it was, but it's still quite an enjoyable drinking experience."

"Pours black with a ruby undertone. Two fingers of sturdy foam from a vigorous pour that fell unwillingly to some sticky lacing. Nose is muted dark fruits, citrus hops and roasted malt that’s a little burnt. The forward hop nose is contrast to the dark color. As it warms the malt comes forward even more, a little coffee, more earthy hops and slightly boozy. First taste is a surprise. I expected very sweet but what I got was smooth, burned toast and bitter. The chocolate comes out a little and the alcohol is warming. It finishes big and heavy, bittersweet and smoky. Well made."
""
"Too highly carbonated."
""
""
"Overall its a quality beer made with real skill but falls short due to Southern Tier's sweetness problem. This is where personal preference comes into play; someone who likes a nice barleywine or quad will love this but those of us who love crisp pilsners and dry stouts will feel compelled to brush out teeth afterwards."

"I haven't had a black IPA I enjoyed this much since Stone's 15th Anniversary Ale. I should have had this a little fresher, but it should hold up well given the thick malts and high ABV. However, the earthy flavors are a plus here, and it's all owed to the dank yet vibrant hop profile. Can't wait to try more beers from these guys!"
"O - Outstanding beer, always a delight to have."

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a deep, dark color of charred wood and allowing just the faintest amount of light through its belly. The head is big, two to three fingers high and cloud-like. There is lacing all over the glass as the beer disappears. The nose is a huge citrus hop blossom. There are all the usual offenders of bright oranges, grapefruit, lime and citrus zest. The black malts impart the very faintest of a Hersey chocolate bar, but gives much ground to the dry hop additions. The taste is incredibly smooth. The hops take all of the glory of this show and have all the fresh orange zest, fresh oranges...just a lot of orange flavor all over the place. There is a good bitter profile to the beer, but in no way astringent or overbearing. The malt gives good backbone to the beer and the creamy and roasty characteristics of a good black malt without any of the sometimes bitter component that comes across unnatural to some black IPAs. The mouthfeel shows none of the 9% abv and has good body. My only complaint would be a little bit of a syrupy feel at times. Notwithstanding, this beer is a fabulous black IPA that really features the late hop additions and pulls off a wonderfully balanced beer."

"Overall, this brew is quite nice. There is a good dark malt sweetness and roast but the hops shine together with these malty notes. Pretty delicious ABA."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, the beer is pretty well balanced between the malts/hops and sweetness/bitterness but that disappointed me a little bit since I was expecting a little more bitterness due to this being a black IPA. The beer is pretty easy to drink but there are some slight hints of barleywine notes to it."

"O- Extremely well-balanced beer. The roasted malts and hops combine to make a delicious bitter-sweet combination. I love the coffee flavor which breaks through. The 9% ABV is hidden well beneath all the complex flavors. Very well done. I would recommend."
""
""
""
""

"I think that beer should give us a 'fizz', a feeling of content-ness, an appreciation of what we're putting into our body, something to make us think, to bring us to a better place. This beer seriously lacks a fizz for me, both physically and mentally.."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Another great beer from Southern Tier. I'm increasingly impressed with this brewery. This beer is an alcohol bomb, but it is well hidden, other than a deep warming sensation. The color is a rich brown color, very deep, with a thin tan head. The aroma is intense...brown sugar, molasses, burnt grain husks, toasted bread crust, malt, and booze. Not much hop aroma, although there is a bitterness and and a hop bite in the taste. Smooth and warming. Some fruit in the flavor. Lingering, boozy sensation on the tongue. Balanced, drinkable, dangerous, and brilliant."
""
""
""
""
"Poured bomber into 34oz mug. Deep brown/black that shows brown/ruby in the light. Smell is hops like an IPA, but with a strong malt backbone. Taste is hops at first, but the expected bitter finish is obliterated by malt and sweet chocolate. Finishes wet and sweet and delicious. Alcohol is hidden entirely by the sweetness, as is the hop bitterness that would normally come at the end of a beer that smells like this one. Mouthfeel is creamy without being too heavy. Overall, this beer is a couple different styles, and no style at all. A delicious abomination, as many have said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great twist on one of my favorite styles. I typically prefer a black IPA that is very hop forward and hide the fact that it is black in color. But this beer reminded me of some great IPAs that can feature a great malt bill inside a hoppy beer. Malt stood up in the smell, in the flavor and in it's mouthfeel. In its flavor it might have been a little to malt forward. Little bit of sweetness was a negative but all around a cool black IPA and an imperial one at that."
"I cant recommend it enough"

""
""

"The brew hides the alcohol well. I want a lot more of this. Another excellent job from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
"O/D-A perplexing brew. I was not a big fan. I enjoyed its individuality. It doesn't suit me well. The large format Souther Tier brews are not my favorite way to spend 8 to 9 dollars."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's been a few years since I've had this one. I remembered enjoying it much more, but this isn't as complex as alot of the big ""Black IPAs"" coming out these days. Decent big beer, but one note and boring. It's not exactly worth the price of admission, in my opinion."

"Not a bad beer, but not the best for the style. Seems pretty average, but maybe it was a bad batch or something."
""
"O: Great example of a Black IPA. The smooth, fluffy body of a stout with the full-hop flavored hop presence."
"Had high hopes for this beer, didn't exactly live up to the lofty standards. Being a rare, albeit one of my favorite, styles, I was expecting a nice smoky, charred hoppy taste. The hops are there.. but also just a cloying sweetness and not enough balance for my liking. Not a bad beer by any means, and probably above average, but if I'm spending $7 on a bomber I want superb taste with complexity and balance... and I didn't feel I got that with this one... also, too much of a boozy aftertaste, even for the high ABV."
""
""
""
"O:A very well balanced brew, Loved this beer very unique and tasted great."
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours dark red brown with wispy light tan head and lacing. Sweet and roasted malt and hops aroma. Citrus fruits, sweet and roasted malt and chocolate up front. Malty, dark fruit middle and hoppy, roasted malt finish. Medium bodied. Nicely made and enjoyable."
""
"Overall: This is a fantastic imperial black ale; That I would recommend to anybody who enjoys dark beers. Good call by Southern Tier putting this beauty in regular bottles."
""
"Overall: Now THIS is a big beer done well. Never overly pretentious, it walks a perilously thin line between a hopped-up IPA and a refined Belgian strong dark ale or quadrupel. This dance could have gone so wrong in so many ways, but it works. Flavors are perfectly balanced with every sip bringing new appreciation for the subtle complexity containing within the murky depths."
""
""
""
"Overall a very interesting beer that is certainly worth trying. Have gotten a few times and not been let down. Liking the new 12oz bottle to make this easier to enjoy."
""
""
""
"I like the bottled version of this offering a bit better than the on-tap version. There is more body to the beer and the hop flavors are more distinct."
""
""
""
"O: This is an outstanding Imperial Ale. It really seems to fall somewhere in between an Imperial Ale and a Barley Wine. This will really please fans of malt centered beers."

"A very unique ale. Pours dark brown to black with a white head. Aroma is sweet sugars, molasses, a bit of pine. Sweet molasses like flavor with some piney hop bite mixed in. Complexity keeps me from identifying any one flavor. This was sweet but relatively light. Slick on the palate, with plenty of carbonation. Candy like flavor, but not cloying. Interesting beer."
""
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 12/30/2011. Pours fairly clear very dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, dark chocolate, roasted malt, herbal, orange, biscuit, floral, pine, light coffee, and earthiness. Some really nice and well balanced aromas here, with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, dark chocolate, roasted malt, biscuit, floral, pine, light coffee, orange, toast, and earthy spiciness. Moderate amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, citrus, roasted malt, pine, light coffee, and toasted biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, with plenty of roasted malt sweetness balancing out the hops perfectly. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic black IPA. Plenty of roasted malt sweetness balancing out the hop flavors; which is what I really like in the style. Very smooth and easy to sip on."
"M: Creamy and finely grained. Perfect carbonation."
""
""
"Poured into my trusty pint glass from bottle. Kind of a brownish hue with decent head. Tastes of toffee and chocolate and the smell is the same as it tastes. Strong enough to have a couple of these at a time though. Smooth tasting a great filling!!!!"

"O - I liked this beer, and it's true to the style. Perhaps, it isn't as complex and big as, say, the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous, but it surely is one of the most drinkable 9% beers out there! Recommended!"
""
""
"Overall - Wow, this is excellent, i always thought southern tiers beers were far over the top with the feature flavor of the beer, ""mokah, jah va etc"" but this is killer with balance, flavor and smoothness. hands down the best black ale ive ever had, and untill i find it, this gets a perfect taste for me."
""
"650ml bottle. Tulip glass. Enjoyed on nov´11. Pitch black. Beige,large size bubbled , froth creates a creamy fairly well retention crown. Collars on sides. Subtle toasted malt aroma, hints of cocoa. Very pleasant toasted malt upfront. Flavor is a miscellaneous of bitterness, dark fruits & prune hues. Gentle molasses to the palate. Full body, medium carbonation. Dry sharp hoppy finish. Smooth oily resins on the aftertaste. Toffee notes. Well balanced beer where ABV is perfectly hidden so drinkability is such a mistic experience. Thankfully it´s presented in a medium size bottle if it were smaller I´d felt frustrated."
""
""
"Taste is spicy and bitter as the relative lightness of the pour might suggest. Smooth and silky for its heft with a touch of cherry and shaved chocolate for a bit of balance. Finish is a touch oily but really much drier than expected for the style and the ABV. Overall pretty enjoyable and quite drinkable vs. a Stone SSR for example. Yet not as memorable either. The jury is still out..."

"22 oz bomber pours a near opaque black. Head and lacing is a bit of a disapointment. Nose is roasted bready malt with spicy hops, and chocolate. Taste is subtle smokey malts with dark fruit, spicy and grassy hops and thankfully-not overly sweet. Alcohol well hidden for 9%. Smooth but nice crisp mouthfeel finishes a little wet. This is almost too drinkable for such a high ABV beer. With such a complex but subtle flavor I'm drinking this way too fast..."
"First experience with Southern Tier. Definitely keeping an eye out for their stuff in the future!"

""
""
"Overall this is easily recommendable and another stellar addition to the Southern Tier name."
"overall my impression of this experiment is positive. i've had trouble with black ales/CDA's and others most closely related to the style. now an imperial version...it seems to agree with me as i can't really find anything that doesn't agree with me in a big way...good thing i have only one bomber! good stuff here."
""

"... yes. I will have this one again."

"Overall a very solid black ale."

"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with brown highlights and a sparse ring of film around the edge of the surface. Aromas are malty and roasted, with hints of fig and coffee. Flavors are rich and robust on a light, crisp body. Coffee roast, dark chocolate, and dark, old world fruits such as fig and date. The increased carbonation and the thinner body keep everything light, and lead to a quick finish. There is minimal cling along the glass, and the aftertaste is light and quick, with some roast coffee flavors. Very easy to drink...tasty little beer."

"O - very enjoyable and would definitely recommend this beer."
"O - Very well balanced offering which exemplifies the style. Perfect blend of hoppy IPA character and dark smoky malts of a porter. Well done Southern Tier."

"Overall: Good black IPA. The mouthfeel is really what saves it to make it an above average beer."
"An exceptional offering from Southern Tier. This is an easy drinking brew that I will definitely look for again. A remarkably well balanced brew. Good stuff."

"Overall impression: I have yet to be disappointed with anything from Southern Tier. This is a very good BIPA. Unlike other posers, the malts are roasted enough to justify the ""Black"" IPA. I have had too many BIPAs that taste like an ordinary IPA. Way to go, Sourthern Tier!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink compared to other beers in the style because the hop bitterness is well balanced by the underlying malts."

"Overall it is pretty good black IPA. You get the mix of IPA and porter tastes. There is coffee and some hoppiness. Neither flavor over-whelms the other. Pretty good for balance. I recommend picking up a bomber or a growler to enjoy this beer by Southern Tier."

"Overall I am happy with this brew. I'd get another."
"Pours a very dark, nearly black color with an initially thick and creamy head that slips down to a thin, bubbly covering. Dark caramel malt, toasty wood, tobacco, and a smooth booziness hits the nostrils first...orange and citrus blossom hoppiness meets some pine and light lemon. The flavor is good balance between dark malts and sticky hops. Chocolate, spruce, sweet black tea, raisin, and some trailing citrus and mint. Not quite full bodied, but creamy and fairly well carbonated. Pretty good all around, the hops are still tasty and the balance is nice, but something makes me question the freshness of this bottle. It should be fresh, considering it came from a fairly new store, but I detect a certain ""aged"" quality. Worthy of a revisit in the near future..."

"Incidentally, the label depicts a hexigram talisman, a five-pointed image to invoke good luck while representing brewing purity. I really enjoyed this one and suspect any discerning BA would as well."

"O: I have always like this beer, but this is the first time reviewing it. The mixture of sweet, roasted malt and hop is perfect."

"Overall - This is one of my favorite beers in this new and blossoming style of beer. It is much more deserving of the ""IPA"" tag that adorns the bottle than many of the participating breweries. It tastes and drinks more like a session IPA than a higher gravity Black IPA. I will buy again very soon."

"Disappointed. I expected more."
"Overall: An enjoyable beer, but nothing special. It's not one I'd prefer to have more than one of."
"O: There's a lot going on here, and the multiple layered flavors make this a true blend of an IPA with a darker beer."
"Well not quite black but close. A dark clear cola with a dark off white head that does not want to go away. Scads of lace and just a joy to behold. Nose is full of roasted grains. Light chocolate and coffee notes waft back and forth with a lovely caramel sweetness. This is so good. Taste is much like the nose with a brown bread malt core that envelopes a yeasty fruitiness bringing forth some faint plum and figs. No trace of the alcohol anywhere. Wow. Finish is crisp with a good earthy hops that has a firm but mild grapefruit bitterness. Feel is supple and medium-ish with a touch of light syrup. Carbonation is lightly creamy and super fine. This stuff goes down like a lager and is so delicious that you need a plate of good food too keep you from getting in trouble. A stupendous beer."
"For some reason, likely my own preconceptions, I was expecting a beer called an Imperial Black Ale to be more akin to the new Black IPA. And it sort of is, if you don't mind a malt bomb as an IPA. I don't, necessary, and quite enjoyed this. But the hops are very subdued and someone looking for a more hopped up black ale may be disappointed. I like it and think it's really good."
"O: It really is the antithesis of Unearthly. This beer is a complete mess, but in a good way. It's even weirder than other Black IPAs I've had. It's not as well balanced, yet it's still enjoyable. It's really hard to grade this brew. Technically it isn't a well done beer, but I like it. However, the Stone Escondidian is a better example of the style, in my opinion."
"Interesting drink. I thought it was going to be like a Schwartzbier, but it was advertised on the bottle as a Black IPA... but it was neither and very enjoyable."
"Overall - This one is a winner. The bottle claims that it is the antithesis of unearthly, and I would like to try them side by side. I find this easy to drink, and do not taste the alcohol."
"A very nice beer overall that went down easy and was highly drinkable. Definitely check this out."
"Definitely worth trying. I will, if I can procure a fresher bottling."
"D/O: For a big black IPA, this beer is fairly palate-friendly. Flavors are balanced, with just a slight edge given to the layered dark malt qualities over hop influences. It is notably similar to Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous ale, a beer that arguably founded the imperial black IPA sub-style."
"Pours a super dark black into my snifter glass. Decent carbonation, and excellent lacing. A little thinner looking than I would expect for the style, but the color is right on. Head was half a finger cocoa in color- it quickly disappears. Nose is really nice, bordering on fantastic. The 'C' hops are here, as well as malt, grapefruit, and caramel. Very smooth and balanced nose. Taste is really nice as well- nice malt/hops/caramel/chocolate/fruit vibe. Definitely balanced and a smooth, easy drinker. The feel on this beer is excellent- very creamy, smooth and somewhat dry. Just about perfect for the style. The 9% ABV is completely absent from this beer as well- I'm not sure where they hid it, but I don't even get a whiff or taste of alcohol at all. Totally stealth. Overall, this is a nice brew that deserves a pick up if you haven't had it. I enjoyed it- Cheers."
"Good stuff - thanks to Wilkins44 for this."
"There is an off taste or something, it doesn't really affect my opinion though and i would have another no problem."
"Overall I think this is a great beer, but it entered a ""style"" that is dominated by extraordinary beers like SSR, Stone 15th Anniversary and Hop in the Dark. It is good but doesn't come close to measuring up the the heavy hitters in the style. Thanks to MaxSpang for the bottle."
"Overall this is a solid brew from Southern Tier, and a decent representation of the style. I've had better, but this is a beer worth trying from a brewery that helped usher me into craft beer. Cheers!"
"O- A very sinister and barbaric looking drink which has a very pleasing and smooth taste. If I were a Viking I would drink this next to a massive victory fire on a cold battle ridden night. I will definatly have another."
"O - So, so - wouldn't purchase this again. I love Southern Tiern but am not hip on this particular beer."
"I love it! It's a favorite and it's perfect for my wife and I to split before bed!"
"O-very good. I really enjoy this beer. decent hops. good balanced taste."
"This beer poured out nice and black in color, the head was brownish tan and left behind a sticky lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was pretty good, lots of chocolate and hop aromas pouring out of this one. The taste is a rich, and loaded with flavorful hop and roasted malts. The mouthfeel of the beer is a bit on the thick side and for Southern Tier that seems to be something that their Imperials never lack. Overall this brew was quite tasty, I'd really like to revisit this one someday."
"Overall: The taste is very good but the aroma was lacking. This is a very good tasting beer and I will be getting this one again."
"22oz poured into a snifter. Dark brownish black ale. Aroma of roasted malts, dark fruits, sugary booze and floral hops. In the taste, an even balance of roasted malt, barleywine like heat and fruityness, and a small piney resiny hop profile. Full bodied, chewey, strong brew. Southern Tier once again brews an extreme beer to please and challenge the palate. Solid."
"Overall: Great beer, I am very glad I have two bottles of this!"
"This is a pretty decent black ale, I like how the hops sort of sneak up on you, its not at all a black hop bomb and has some nice layers."
"D - Very drinkable. The roasted and burnt flavors balance quite well with the hop flavor. I especially like the coffee flavor that comes through at the finish."
"Overall: Honestly this is probably one of my least favorite Black IPA's or ABA's. The flavor profile is just an absolute mess in all honesty not at all what I expected from Southern Tier"
"Very smooth-drinking and flavorful. Nice balance between the roasty, sweet, and hoppy qualities."
"Certainly not a bad beer. Very smooth for the ABV. I could use more hops on the smell and taste."
"Overall for the style this example has it's own unique flavor I can't seem to wrap my head around. I thought the mouthfeel was the strong point as well as the hidden octane. A good beer overall."
"O - Was expecting more. Could be that its an old bottle? Would like to sample it very fresh. It just seems what's going on doesn't mesh well to me."
"I like it but you have to be in the mood for it."
"Overall, not a bad tasting beer. But maybe the style gets a little more hype than is necessary maybe?"
"Overall a nice experience, a style that stands on its own. For having lots of flavors and higher ABV, a pretty smooth drinker. I'd do it again if the opportunity arose."
"This is truly a genre-bending beer, as well as a first-class taste experience that has to be tried to be believed. A must-buy for beer afficionados."
"Really a great black IPA. The bottle describes it as ""the antithesis of Unearthly", and it really does taste like Unearthly's alter ego."
"O: An intriguing beer -- very tasty. I would recommend it. Drinkable for the ABV, and something I wouldn't mind revisiting in the future."
"This may be my favorite from southern tier yet. Absolutely outstanding. This one will be on my gots list for future BIFs and trades for sure."
"overall, this is a very good brew in my book. I love the unearthly, and I agree this is the antithesis in southern tier's imperial series. I find it incredibly drinkable, completely delicious and for $8 a bomber, a great deal for such a beer."
"Im not sure how sweet ST likes their beers but this being my second, and Unearthly being my first, i'm beginning to see a lot of sweet and sticky traits in their brews. I picked up a few bottles after hearing about the infamous Pumking, and I soon found myself going back for more of their selection. These beers are sure to please the maltier crowd just as much as the hop-heads. The balance on this beer in incredible, every ingredient is used just above its status quo. I highly recommend checking ST out for some great beer. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Overall: A very solid version of a black ale from Southern Tier."
"D- 4 I enjoyed this one. Although I wouldn't probably drink more than a bomber because of its somewhat heavy/somewhat sweet tastes, I would definitely buy it again. Interesting and solid brew."
"After having another American Black Ale, this one just didnt live up to the style. Maybe I had an old bottle - but the hop presence in this was very muted & dominated by the malts."
"O - A solid beer, I would recommend it."
"Iniquity pours pitch black with two fingers of beige foam on top. Head recedes leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee and a bit of chocolate. Taste follows with big roasted coffee notes up front. Coffee is followed by a sweet malt backbone and a mild hoppy bitterness. The finish is dry and roasty, with a lingering bitterness which is quite nice. Feel is thick and chewy with a medium to low level of carbonation. Alcohol is exceedingly well hidden making the beer extremely drinkable. Overall, Iniquity is a very solid offering from Southern Tier in the somewhat ambiguous American Black Ale style. I'd say it nearly qualifies as a stout, given the flavor profile. Regardless of style, it is a tasty brew which I'm glad to have had the opportunity to sample."
"Very rich, smooth, creamy and easy to drink. Nicely balanced and mellow."
"Overall: Flavorful and not too astringent or brutishly bitter like some, so, yeah, I'm down with Iniquity. Not even giving this beer a try, well, that would truly be the iniquity."
"O: This is one amazing brew. This is stouter than...well, most stouts. With huge roast flavors, but creamy caramel that balances out. Amazing."
"This American Black Ale style is getting to be a strange catch-all. Everything from almost-Schwartzbiers to what seem to be double Stouts, so the label's ""Imperial Black Ale"" is perfectly appropriate."
"Not a bad brew. The hops and malt mix quite well. I did notice some alcohol but for the most part it's well hidden for a 9 ABV. It's quite easy to drink but I think this is meant more as a sipper."
"I must say the drinkability of this beer is insane. There is so much flavor and a couple layers while remaining as easy to drink as your favorite Pale Ale or Porter."
"Two finger plus head of churned up, larger bubble infused dark brown foam, more hills and valleys than dimpling, the lacking streaks are thin but numerous and cling very well. The liquid is black but without the über-density of so many, allows you to get a sense for its innate clarity, this more so as there’s a wide burnt amber coloration at the glass bottom, quite attractive overall. Thick, close to dewy nose of warm milk chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, licorice, candied orange peels, cashews, all this tends to cloak the plum, cherry, apple fruit, too soft to be really roasty, the florality the most pronounced signature of any hops, nothing close to herbaceousness. Full-bodied, the carbonation builds quickly, possesses a tight enough weave to keep the mouth feel firm. Layers of chocolate, coffee, caramel, butterscotch, for all of its sweetness stays in balance, especially with a mineral water, earth element in play. More green grass and a touch of pine here, the orange citrus met equally by white grapefruit. Has a tingle to it but has a “wet” and clingy feel and does not ever take on a powdery texture. To me, drinks like a chocolate infused porter but, hey, I am unsure if anyone knows what an “American Black Ale” is supposed to taste like. Just tastes good tonight."
"the finish is very dry. but yet this is a throat coater -- this beer can definitely stand up to strong cheeses, cured meats, olives, the grill -- it would go pretty well with a chocolate desert of course as well."
"Poured bomber into 13 oz tulip glass. Pours very dark, with a inch of light tan head, minimal lacing. Smell is of dark malts & some mild hops, maybe a little breadyness. Taste chocolate, some dark fruits, & some citrusy hops. Nice body and very easy drinking for the ABV. Overall, I had higher hopes, but it is a solid example of the style."
"O- a winner of a black ipa it hoppy with citrus notes but has a great balance of chocolate and malts"
"O: This is a good beer overall, but not a great example of the style, in my opinion. Worth giving it a try, though, without a doubt."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. One that I'll more than likely drink again."
"A good beer. Not sure how I feel about and IBA, but if I don't think about it, the beer is just fine so I'm going to forget any preconceived notions about what beer is supposed to be."
"To sum, sweet and roasted mixed on the body but not in an overpowering fashion...floral on the backend with little bitterness. A pretty decent beer here, in that it's very drinkable and manages not to be over the top in any way. It's pretty well put together and goes down easier than its 9% ABV would suggest."
"Most of these are sipping beers, but this one can be pounded."
"Overall a fantastic beer. I typically enjoy both the malty porters & stouts and the hoppy IPA's and this beer is really a perfect combination of the two."
"O- Not impressed at all with this brew, very unusual, was hard to finish the bottle even with two people drinking it."
"Been loving the darker, hoppy beers. Not sure why, btu waited to pick this up. Guess I'm not a fan of the packing of S. Tier, but this beer in the glass was brown/black with a big, yummy head. The smell was molasses, charcoal, and west coast hops. The taste was smooth and showed a great balance of hops and the darker malts. Great beer."
"O: Overall It'd rate this just above good. It's not perfect by any means but it's a really great beer. This beer would be great for people who like barleywines or DIPAs/CDAs/ABAs, whatever you want to call them. I would buy this again."
"This is an enjoyable ale. I didn't enjoy it as much as Southern Tier's imperial IPA, but it is still one of the better American Black Ales I've had."
"It was our annual trip to Tampa...the night before THE BUCKEYE CRUISE AGAINST CANCER!!!! The better half and I walked a couple of blocks down from our hotel and found a wonderful sport to taste numerous different brews. The third beer I tried, thank to the suggestion of our server...was Southern Tier's Imperial Blaxk Ale...again another nice suggestion!!! This was a quite nice beer!! The color was...black with creamy white head. The nose had a subtle hop and definite roast/coffee. This of course fed into the taste of the beer which was full body (prbably cuz of high ABV), with a great balance of hop, molassis, malt, and coffee. I could drink maybe four of these....then would have to wave the white flag!!!!"
"Overall, a very good beer!!!"
"O: Very nice."
"Taste is nice and sweet. Some fruit that wasn't present in the aroma. Chocolate too. And just a little bit of pine and grass. Good dose of chocolate and sweet malts behind the hops."
"Overall: Certainly quite different from the other Black IPAs I have sampled, this one is somewhat sweeter but still has the dramatic contrasting sweetness/bitterness I seek"
"My first love of Southern Tier was Krampus but this one has taken the cake, and it's year round. I am very excited about this fact."
"Very good beer. I like'em a little hoppier, but the lack of roasted astringency is a nice change."
"Really impressive offering from Southern Tier, and the most impressive beer I've had in awhile."
"Bottom Line: Yet another well made beer by Southern Tier. Reminds me of Old Man Winter taken to the extreme."
"D/O: Definitely drinks well, the alcohol is almost unnoticeable. I'd love to get this a bit fresher, because I'm pretty sure the hops are a bit faded, and could stand out a little more. Still a great brew, nonetheless"
"All in all, I'm not sure if I had an old bottle. I can't find any bottle date printed on the bottle anywhere. I've had it for about a month, but the hops shouldn't be completely gone... only not as strong maybe. I'll give it another try sometime as I love the black ale style. But for now, I was very dissapointed."
"This is a hugely drinkable beer, and one of the best American Black Ale's I've had to date. Complex but balanced, this will become a mainstay in my house."
"Call this an adjustment, but well the sum of the parts are greater than the final product. Good? Sure, but there's just something here that doesn't work."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin, but, of course, more like an IPA than a stout. Overall, a very enjoyable brew."
"It's difficult to get past the notion of ipa's being black and offering the acrid dryness of burnt toast; it becomes hard to tell where the hop bitterness ends and the burnt toast bitterness begins- but again, that's all part of the fun. Kinda reminds me when the green ketchup came out; then, the psychological game was too much to accept. We'll see about black pale ales."
"D - I'm so glad to have found this. Iniquity very quickly shot to the top of my favorites/go to list with just one bomber. I will add also, this went absolutely perfectly with some Indian naan dipped in a medium hot curry sauce"
"D/O- No alc heat. A very solid brew all around. Southern Tier really pulled off a good ABA. Will be getting this again."
"D - Easy to drink and tasty. No alcohol taste. Drinks like a 6-7%, not a 9% Not going to buy it again, but it was pretty good."
"I almost get some milk chocolate in the finish but then pine and citrus take hold. Quite good to say the least but I expect this from Southern Tier."
"Thanks Dan..this is a good one."
"Poured into Draak goblet. Dark black/brown with slightly tan head, only two fingers. The aroma is of candi fruit, spicy hops, and roasted licorice. The taste starts with a earthy dose of bitterness from the hops. There is a roasted malt sweetness; a flavor of root beer without the large amount of carbonation. Low carbonation. The body is full. Not their best offering."
"An interesting brew. I like the flavor combinations."
"This is an excellent offering from Southern Tier- my favorite from them by far. This style has been on my radar for months now and is becoming my favorite. It has something for everyone that enjoys a big beer."
"Drinkability? It's easy enough to drink despite the beer being on the boozy side; for the style, it doesn't match up all that well with the few others I've tried though none of the others had ""Imperial"" in their name. Okay, I'm thoroughly confused by this beer and I'll make no excuses..."
"D/O- Nothing terribly wrong with this beer, but overall I just didn't care for the flavor too much. Southern Tier is usually hit or miss with me and I'd have to mark this a miss."
"Overall: Incredibly unique and flavourful brew. This is pretty much Unearthly with the addition of roasted malts. A must try for any hophead or fan of original beers."
"Overall, I'm unbelievably impressed by what Souther Tier has crafted here."
"drinkability is very good - even @9%abv i had no problems taking down the entire bomber and could have cracked open another if i had bought one"
"Overall: This is a perfect introduction to the style and one of my favorites. It perfectly blends the hop profile of an IPA with the complex roasts of a darker style."
"Thick and creamy, really a great feel that I wasn't expecting with the hop bite of this cascadian. Really a great beer and matches up with some of the best in the style. "
"D: Wonderful beer. Quite strong. Definitely a beer I would want to enjoy time and time again. Try it!"
"D - There's a syrupy sweetness that isn't really noticeable with any singular drink, but builds and really weighs you down towards the end of the bottle."
"D - Probably no more than a bomber, as the sweetness, though subtle at first, starts to catch up with you. Still, a pretty easy drinking beer with a an interesting and pleasant flavor profile."
"M/D: Appropriately thick for a beer this dark but not quite as heavy as the 'imperial' moniker would lead you to believe. Easily finished the bottle."
"Overall: This was my first Black IPA / India Dark Ale / American Black Ale (whatever), and it remains one of my favorites. It is incredible. I love what Southern Tier does with dark beers."
"Notes: seems like the hops could have been stronger despite the negating factor of the darker malts and fruitiness. still a delicious brew"
"If you drink Iniquity as a beer without a style it is great. Trying to decide what style it should be and if it fits takes away from the enjoyment. Very enjoyable beer, one I wish could find its way to six packs so I could enjoy it more often."
"D: Very much drinkable brew. Only had a sample but probably could have taken down the bomber without blinking an eye. Good product from a solid brewery."
"Drinkability is ok. This is a pleasant enough beer, but it kind of misses when compared to other Black IPA's. There just isn't enough hoppiness to carry this one, and it kind of lacks complexity."
"D - This beer is decent, but not the best example of the style. Easy enough to drink but a weird sticky sweetness to it. Okay beer, still love ST stuff."
"I think I would call this a stout drinker's IPA. Very hoppy and roasty, but not overly so on either. Not so many hops that you can't stand to drink more than one glass, but not so intensely malty either. Very nice balance, I think I have found something to go for when I'm in a hop mood."
"Overall: Really, if someone told you this is a Black IPA, you would swear this is a Stout. Southern Tier makes some very good stouts and this is a slight variation of....worth seeking out. Glad to have on tap. Enjoy!"
"Definitely worth your effort to sample this libation!"
"d - wow, this is an incredible beer. southern tier's blackwater beers continue to amaze."
"Drinkibility. Not too shabby, especially considering it's high abv. Good drinker behind that intimidating apearance."
"I think this style is kind of growing on me. I'd drink another but not right now. Maybe I'll just have a real chocolate milk shake."
"D - Delicious! That's all."
"Overall, this is an exceedingly drinkable beer that would pair nicely with a range of foods or be good just on its own."
"Rich aroma is oily and smoky with tones of caramel, semi-sweet chocolate and burnt molasses, rather like a good stout. It pours a dark chocolate brown that is barely translucent just at the edges and has a thick, fluffy, fine-bubbled, pale tan head that leaves fairly heavy lacing. Flavor is rich and mouth-filling, mainly like semi-sweet chocolate with hints of smoke, molasses, caramel, toffee and licorice. Texture is slick and smooth with a subtle alcohol bite and a firm fizz so it leaves a strong, persistent tingle behind. Overall, this is more like a stout or porter than a strong ale. I strongly recommend this one."
"Quite an enjoyable drink this is. I look forward to more for certain!"
"D: Another delicious one from ST. Their beers tend to be dessert in a glass to me, so I always enjoy slow sipping. Alcohol is pretty well hidden on the palate, which throws this one into the dangerous category."
"Long story short. i would definitely drink this beer again and would recommended to any stout fan."
"D-Good drinkability but still something there that makes me wonder if I could drink multiple pints of this."
"D- iniquity has some dark characteristics that are tasty. Massive alcohol though. I will always snag some of these malt fests"
"D- Lovely complex flavor. The nose was a bit too sweet for me, the alcohol level makes it a bit hard to get through a bomber."
"Overall, this is an excellent DIPA, but it lacks the full on roast, chocolate, toast, and ballsy hop bitterness that I expect from a Black IPA. All of these elements only show up in trace amounts here. Ironically the label states that Iniquity is ""the anti-thesis of Un*Earthly," yet aside from a few flavours brought out by the black malts, I find the two beers to be almost identical. Granted, that's not a bad thing, as Un*Earthly is one of my all-time favourites."
"Drinkability - I would drink this beer anytime I could."
"D- Not 100% sure on the Black IPA style and I try to rate based on style but being a little unfamiliar, I may have to come back and re-review this one to give it a better shake."
"Drinkabilty - well blended brew , smooth taste not overpowering for a 9% abv concoction, nice finish with a very nice aftertaste, This was my first one - won't be my last -"
"Drink- This brew gets a bit boozy if you drink indiscriminately, though you don't necessarily have to sip to enjoy. Probably best to split the 22oz with a friend."
"Overall, not the best black IPA that I have had. I prefer more of a pronounced malt character to get the best of both worlds. The hops were perfect. The creamy mouthfeel made this an easy drinker and I would like another."
"This beer is dark like a root beerish color with a flat tan head the disapears quickly with no retention around the glass. I can smell sweet malts and some floral hoppiness. The taste is pretty good- dark fruits and choclate. But I get a hint of licorce which I am not a fan of. the better has a watery mouthfeel to me, very disappointing to me. I wish this was a thicker brew."
"This is one dangerously drinkable 9% dark ale that is pairing nicely with some fresh smoky gouda."
"drinks good for the abv, but one bottle is more than enough, a good beer to split with someone due to its high abv and richness."
"Overall I was very impressed Would buy again. I bought as a part of a winter mix I was building... Though its not a seasonal winter beer it sure goes well with it"
"medium-full body with a bitter/ sour finish. Bummer."
"We give it a solid A for awesome. This is a fantastic abomination of a beer. Get some."
"this beer is awesome i havent had to many of this style but in my mind this is what i expect it to taste like"
"I liked this but I was a little confused by the style. Is it an IPA with the hoppiness?; was it a Porter with the dark roast malts? or was it something else with the lighter body (lighter than expected)? My senses were not calibrated for this."
"Overall- Incredible brew!!! The Black IPA is something we're seeing more of and I love them!"
"pours dark reddish brown. off white head dissipates quickly. sweet brown bread in nose. taste of molasses cookies, licorice, raisins, chocolate. citrusy hops on tongue in finish. tasty. well made, curious how would taste on tap and would drink again."
"9% ABV and you wouldn't even know it, easy to drink and not to harsh. Overall not as hoppy as i would've liked but maybe i bought an old bottle from Table and Vine, ya' never know unless they date um'."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A nice medium-to-full mouthfeel, clings to the palate a bit. With all of the strong, conflicting flavors in this beer, the alcohol is easily hidden. This is an interesting style to say the least. Others have rated this beer very highly, so if you're looking to try a Black IPA I would certainly pick it up and give it a try. This beer just isn't for me."
"Pours near black with a nice tan head, leaving a little bit of lacing behind. The nose is in your face with a strong attack of citrus and pine hops atop a good amount of strongly-roasted malt. The taste is pretty good in its balance, though it lacks the depth and interactions of the nose. The roast comes through a bit more here. The dry roast and hop bitterness combine well in the feel. Quite a drinkable brew and one of the first Black IPAs I ever came across."
"Not quite the black I was expectng-still a deep, deep brown color with some nice reddish hues along the edges. Decent carbonation level though no real head. Mellow sweet aroma-somewhat piney and resiny. A trace of licorice in there. Very nice, caramel like sweetness with some very nice roasted grain flavors. Good dose of hops going on. The caramel/toffeeish flavors are great. really balances well against the hops. Soft, almost creamy like body to it. Really goes down easy-almost too much so! Damn drinkable and a dangerous abv to boot!"
"Overall, a big and bold black ipa that brings the flavor. The flavors of this style are too good to be set within such a high ABV beer. I would love to see more of this style in a 5-7.5% ABV medium. This one is still worth a try."
"D: A tasty beer, and easy to get down, overall. I'd probably stop at one, but it's a pretty easy one to drink."
"D. Starts out easy drinking, but starts to be a commitment half way through."
"D: I am a bit turned off by the smell of this beer, but the flavor and mouth redeems itself. If I am to compare this to the only other two examples of a black ipa that I've had, from Stone and Deschutes, I'd have to say this falls in third. It's still a very drinkable brew, and one that would probably be monster on tap. Thanks again Michael for a very interesting brew I would never have gotten a chance to try otherwise."
"D - I finished the bottle. Would definitely drink a second. This is a dangerous beer. I love the concept of an overly hopped dark beer. IBA is just great. This goes beyond that. If this beer hasn't won any awards, it's because they haven't found or made the right category for it."
"D-This very drinkable. I wish Southern Tier bottle dated. I also wish this were available to me in 6 packs of 12 oz. bottles. Not sure why they call it ""iniquity"" since it seems to hit the mark quite well."
"Drinkability is pretty good despite the high ABV."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer. The flavor is somewhat unconventional but I like it. I would drink it again."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. Pours a dark black with chocolate milk colored head. Very easy on the palate was expecting a little more hoppy for being a black ipa. Easy to drink quickly tastes chocolatly malty more like a stout just a little lighter. Very easily to get down esp at 9%"
"Wow, I am impressed. Not just with iniquity, but I also tried the creme brulee and Jah vah stouts from southern tier and am thouroughly amazed. This is one of my new favorites."
"M/D - Somewhat aqueous and is neither dry nor sweet. At least it is drinkable for a 9% brew. OK, but I probably wouldn't buy it again"
"It says ""the antithesis of Unearthly"" on the label, and that is a strange statement. If anything, I felt that I recognized the beer clearly from Southern Tier's other products, very much including Unearthly. It is different, but it's more like a little brother than an antithesis. It goes with the style, I guess. And variety from the heavier DIPA:s can be good."
"The sweetness surprised me and dominated the bitterness from the hops. A nice black ale from Southern Tier."
"Taste with dark sweetness, somewhat strong dark fruitiness in the middle, and closes a bit boozy. It all comes together well though. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is good also. I don't know what it is, but a double IPA, I'm thinking no. However, I don't think good beers always have to fit into style pigeonholes."
"D-very drinkable, even for a 22 ounce bottle at 9%ABV, the mocha taste lasts more than the others, and it tastes very well. doesn't have any bad tastes that keeps this from being extremely enjoyable. still one of the best black ales i've ever had."
"Drinkability is fairly high, despite the alcohol content. One of the original Black IPAs which are becoming popular lately; I appreciate that Southern Tier was original before it was cool to make this style."
"Pours extremely dark brown. Near black but on the light side of black if that is possible with a tan head. Smell is full of chocolate surprisingly. Kind of expected some hoppy bittnerness but it actually smells closer to a stout than anything. But no, no bitterness in the nose. Hmmm tastes more like a hoppy Imperial Stout than anything. I am not really too keen on the taste. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish but mostly bitter chocolate. Second Black IPA for me. Cap'n Krunkles although I didn't care for it either was closer to IPA tastes than this. I take it I just care for the style although I say this is well done."
"I poured the Iniquity into a snifter, which resulted in a rather minimal head -- just enough to patch over the top, and create a bit of subtle lacing. The brew, true to the bottle label, is nigh pitch black, though does show hints of brown and amber throughout. The scent is of sweet syrup and citrus, a bit more dessert-like than my pre-conception was for this brew. The hops come out more in the taste, however, starting with a jolt of lemon and pine, followed by a maltiness oddly reminiscent of sweet Japanese milk coffee, only for the tang of hops to rise once more again in the lingering aftertaste. Overall, the mouthfeel is appealing, though I would have appreciated a touch more carbonation to keep the brew from feeling quite so weighty upon the tongue. All in all, quite a tasty find, and I do hope to have more in the future."
"Aromas are interesting and predictable. Overriding aroma is sweet malts with dark dried fruits like prunes and raisins. Some roastiness as well. The hop aroma is muted. A touch of vanilla. Flavor is sweet and smooth. Medium bodied with notes of brown sugar, molasses, candy, vanilla. Finishes with smoky Red Man chewing tobacco. The hops are more spicy than bitter in this brew and they are very understated until the very end. A rich beer. The complexity on the finish saves it from being too rich. A good brew. Southern Tier is really starting to earn my respect as on of the top micros in the US."
"I hate to sound like the typical hophead, but this needs more hops! And they need to clearly date the bottles, so I know how old the beer I'm drinking is. Also, I put the bottle down too closely to my Duvel tulip and managed to crack the glass. Not Southern Tier's fault, but I'm rather disappointed."
"Honestly though, I don't care. The Iniquity is delicious, and really cool. It has a nice dry and slightly quenching finish with some roast and smoke coming though. It was exceptionally appetizing. I actually enjoyed it with a roast beef dinner with bacon potato pie; absolute heaven."
"I really think that this is the most drinkable high-alcohol beer I've had in a while...the alcohol isn't even detectable. Delicious."
"D-I like it but I will only be having 1or 2 a night. This is not an everyday beer."
"Rather impressive. Tasty, with a nice aroma & well-hidden abv. Overall, a solid representation of the CDA style, as opposed to a hoppy porter (though at times it wants to lean toward the latter)."
"Highly drinkable; but for the other offerings on tap that night, I absolutely would have had another."
"Iniquity has an imposing look and a musty flavor, but its sweet and smooth finish make sure its bark is worse than its bite."
"You can't ignore the alcohol but it's decently masked for being a 9%er. I'd gladly drink this again, but most likely single doses if I plan on drinking anything else with noticeable hops in it."
"All in all, this reminds me of a more sweeter, maltier SSRA, and it's definitely good."
"I enjoyed this one, another good one from Southern Tier."
"Pours a very dark reddish-brown with thick off-white head and lots of lacing, with good retention. Smells of citrus and pine hops, with some roasted malt. One of the better smelling Cascadian Dark Ales (I like this name the best), as it seems to be really well balanced between the hops and the roasted malt. However, the flavour I'm not as impressed with. It just seems a bit too much like a sweet syrup then the bitter roasted flavour the smell would suggest. If you have a sweet tooth, I can see finding that appealing though. Mouthfeel is quite creamy."
"Dark reddish brown pour. Very little head with no lacing left behind on the glass. Taste is a nice blend of sweet malts and bittering hops. Syrupy mouthfeel, but could definitely use a bit more carbonation IMO. Glad I tried this one, but not likely to seek it out again."
"Lighter mouthfeel than I expected. But still good. I liked the beer, thought it tasted good and finished cleanly. Overall, I'd have this again with pleasure."
"D- the sweetness is a little much...its decent for the style. The big selling point is the BLACKNESS I guess...but whatever. Its an average DIPA"
"This beer is an absolute steal if you can find it, like I did, for less than $6 per bottle. Seek it out, don't ignore it, on that gorgeous shelf of Southern Tier imperials."
"D: Refreshing and still complex with some good flavors and good strength. Not hard to drink at all. Very good now but could age well too."
"Pours black with only the faintest bit of bubbles around the glass. Scent is a mild and subdued combinaton of dark roasted grain, faintest hints of roasted coffee and cocoa beans. A slight herbal, earthy and piney hop quality is there. Taste again brings a relatively mild and subdued quality - the roasted grains are present, backed by a noticibly unbitter presence of earhty, floral and piney hops. Tastes of dark fruit, coffee and chocolate barely touch the palate. Medium bodied, mildly carbonated. A decent beer that has some very mild flavors and lacks a bitter bite... nout much of a dIPA in my opinion."
"Solid Black IPA, but weak aroma and thin body don't help..."
"Love a beer that evolves in the glass. Pours a dark red, cola colour with not much head. Initial bouquet of citrus hops gives way to some interesting cocoa and yeast aromas. On the palate as well, what starts out tasting like an IPA with driving bitterness starts to morph into a smooth almost dark Belgian kind of vibe. Finishes dry but with a hint of yeast sweetness. I've only had a couple of beers in this style but this is the one that has really sold it for me."
"o - pretty decent. flavor is fairly mellow, but makes it very drinkable."
"Drinkability is high. Lots of stuff going on that is reminiscent of an American Barleywine Lite. Nice."
"I'd buy a bomber of this for sure and would get it again on tap."
"* Creme Brulee was still way too much of a good thing."
"Big friggin' dark ale... I like it!"
"D - I'm drinking this easy, and I could have some more."
"Big bodied, with a nice smooth feel. A good sipper even on a hot spring day."
"Overall an okay beer. After having the Unearthly IPA, I had high expectations which were let down. It is still a good beer, but after having Sublimely Self-Righteous a couple of weeks ago, it is apparent this one is in a different league."
"consumed jan 2010."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a tasty dark IPA, totally different then the local CDAs, but very good. Granted my bias towards them, it's still very good."
"- Overall this is one of the better offerings from Southern Tier. I would take this brew over any of their Imperial IPA's... Unearthly, Oaked Unearthly, Hoppe, and Gemeni. It's just better. Still on the sweet side... but at least it seems most of the sweetness is from the grain."
"D - As for most high ABV southern Tier beers I could enjoy in succession this one was kind of one and done due to the alcohol being very noticeable. I would much rather pick up another unearthy or Jav-ha than drop another 9 on a bomber. One and done."
"This is a beer that should be tried though at least once."
"Really like the texture. Big body. Plush feel. No real noticeable alcohol. Easy drinker, for a style I don't consider to be terribly drinkable. It's no Sublimely Self-Righteous, but it's still a delicious beer. Another Southern Tier ""big"" beer is a winner."
"Southern Tier is newly arrived in Maine. Thus far, not impressed. I imagine I'll try some of their other beers."
"This beer is a failed experiment."
"Tastes like biscuits slathered in blackberry and currant jam. Quite fruity and yeasty. There is a decent amount of hop flavor, but not really a whole bunch of bitterness. Malts are pretty sweet with some semi-sweet chocolate and caramel toffee coming through. Too much alcohol is piled on top to make for a pretty messy offering. It's ok, but after having Stone's SSRA, this one is a bit of a letdown as a black IPA."
"Drinkability: Like I said, doesn't taste or feel like 9% alcohol, so I gave it high marks for drinkability, but I'd hesitate on going back for another bottle."
"Auspices of the reliably good taste of one Gambrinus, this black beauty shows a dark black brown color with a fair light tan colored head and solid lacing. The aroma is heavy imperial malt! Also some tasty roasted ham and red wine. Awesome. The flavor brings peaty herbal malt and deep caramel. It's a little bit smokey with a hint of ham and a maple sweetness. Full bodied and reasonably carbonated but fairly drinkable for the style, which is quite unique. Luscious feel and delicious. A hit for any lover of heavy malt with a hop touch."
"A very good blend of styles."
"Notes: This would be my first ""black IPA", so I'm not sure if this is typical of that style, but if so, I would challenge that this should either be in a new ""black IPA"" style, or classified as something other than an IPA/DIPA. Very delicious though..."
"D: The 9% ABV isn't tasted in the flavor so much as its felt in the big, sweet malty doses in the mouthfeel. You can tell a lot of residual wort sugars achieve the well-blended, hoppy enough malt character of this black ale. A very nice split bomber to have after dinner or in the early evening. Antithesis to the Unearthly? Whatever, I call it delicious."
"There is no way this is a black IPA, this is definitely a Baltic Porter at heart (if I had this during a blind tasting, I would be totally convinced this was a Baltic Porter). There was basically no hop presence to this at all. Overall though, a pretty good beer. Better than their Unearthly IPA (only other beer I've had from these guys since they started distributing here.)"
"D - Booyah - this is one helluva good brew. Southern Tier has done it again with this brew. Thanks CK for introducing me to this beer!"
"One of my highest recommendations, and I can't wait to taste the other ST labels. I'm very impressed, to say the least."
" ~ I am ver impressed with this high quality brew. I suggest you go grab yourself a bomber. I may just go get another."
"This is an excellent, very drinkable ale."
"Would probably classify this beer as a Strong Ale. I'd recommend anything from the Imperial selection of Southern Tier. Looking forward to their 2XIPA coming soon."
"D- This is a well done Black IIPA-the highlight is the hops, as it should be-the malt could come through a little more to make this better. As with all other ST beers the high ABV is completely masked-its nowhere in the nose, flavor, or mouthfeel. Another good beer by ST."
"D - I've been wanting to try Iniquity for a while and I'm glad I got the chance...I like this new trend of black IPA's...the hops were top notch coming from Southern Tier and the malts shined through when needed"
"Nice, good quality, sipping beer."
"This is a good beer, but it's not a DIPA, I don't know what to call it, imperial black ale with chocolate? There is a nice amount of hops in here so they are not absent, but they are not used like they should be. It's tough to rate this, so Im going to do it with style not in mind."
"D- pretty decent but a little sweet. The flavors are all over the place but I'm not sure how well they all blend together."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of the ""black ale"" style, this is yet another quality imperial beer from Southern Tier, it's very flavorful and is worth drinking for whole evening."
"It is pretty drinkable and you don't really notice the 9% abv."
"drinkability: solid black IPA"
"D: This beer is not a DIPA. If I were to review it as a DIPA, it would be an F. Aside from that, I found it difficult to drink. Annoyingly sweet with little else going for other than contrast between the roasted malts and some hops. Only saving grace is its 9% abv."
"The Iniquity pours a cola brown color with a cream white color and some retention on the glass. The head fizzles with carbonation and bubbles line the glass. Aromas are mostly plums and raisins. Faint hints of malts and licorice. Pretty good smelling brew. Quaff is not what I expected in any way. There are a lot more hops present than I expected which leads to a bitter finish. Some grapes and raisins present with plenty of alcohol. A truly unique tasting beer. Mouthfeel is bubbly and silky. Overall a great beer and will continue look for some in the future."
"D: Definitely worth trying. Not ST's best, but is a solid changeup. It's complex, so I think I owe it another go."
"thanks JDV for the opportunity to try this beer"
"D- Overall, Southern Tier did a fantastic job with this beer. As my first Southern Tier beer, I would say this is an excellent start. Can't wait to try more from this brewery. Recommended!"
"D- very drinkable for 9%. not bad."
"d - Interesting beer. Nice mix of dark fruits, malts, and hops. Pretty enjoyable, would try again."
"D - Good, but the alcohol in the finish is gonna get to ya. 3.5"
"Drinkability: Here the sum is greater than its parts. This is just a really good beer. Reading back over my review makes it sounds like a mess, but everything kind of works. Comparing this to an IPA isnt fair, so the review is a little artificial."
"Note: rerated after another try, getting more of the usual ST DIPA profile: earthy, green, and a little offputting. Still, it's one of the better ST brews, and not a bad Double India Black Ale (or whatever this is called now)."
"Salud!"
"I was looking forward to this beer. Southern Tier is new to the area, and this is one of their year round offerings. Beautiful color of this beer, nice and dark. Nice off-tan colored head that disappears quickly. Insane taste on this beer, the carbonation dances on your tongue, nice roasted malt on the attack with a slam of smoke on the back end. There is a bit of hop bittnerness to this beer, but it sneaks up on you. Sorta like your little cousin that thinks its ""cute"" to scare you, the hop comes up and slaps you subtly across the face. Good Beer!"
"D – I like it but this beer would not be a preference."
"Iniquity is a lovely beer melding different styles, and is very very drinkable despite it's 9.0% ABV which is due in large part to it's exquisite mouthfeel. It almost wants to be gulped rather than savored!"
"Overall, I was very impressed and enjoyed this one a lot. Another great job by Southern Tier."
"D= 4.0 It's a good beer and I didn't read the bjcp guidelines for the style. I have had a few previously but I wasn't all the impressed with this beer. It is a good brew though and southern tier is a great brew co."
"Notes: Funny, not the first time I have this one and this tasting is really not like I remembered it, still pretty good and remarkable though. I wonder if it was a bit of aging on the bottle, change of recipe or most likely my faulty memory. Let´s compare notes with a future tasting..."
"One finger light tan head, quick dissipation with good lacing. Dark brown almost opaque body, no visible carbonation. The nose centers on a big malt hit, caramel, chocolate, roast, with flowery hops pretty well hidden by the malt, though after warming the hops became more prevalent in the nose, I'd recommend letting this beer warm up a bit before serving. The taste is chocolaty goodness up front with some roast leading to a hop-filled bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full and sticky. Warming alcohol glow cuts into drinkablility, but overall a fine tasting brew. I'll be checking out more beers from Southern Tier in the near future."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with notes of piney hops with light citrus undertones. Taste is also a unique mix between some light roasted ,malt with traces or caramel and a medium hoppy finish with lots of note piney and citrus hops. Body is about average full with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad and interesting take on the style."
"This is a very unusual tasting brew. Tastes good; seeing a dark IPA is not a common thing. A good drinkable brew for the high alcohol level. Another fine offering from Southern Tier. Stellar stuff indeed...."
"D - A very balanced beer which produces a very nice black IPA profile. The dark color of the beer tends to play tricks with your mind as you immediately think it is a porter or a dark malty ale not an IPA which is very cool. Alcohol is well masked in the complex taste profile which is very drinkable. Great cold weather beer."
"Overall, a really interesting beer. It's got absolutely no semblance of being 9% alcohol, which I found with the ST DIPA aswell. It's a bit scary. Just really easy to drink, with fantastically well balanced flavours."
"D: a very enjoyable beer, but still a big beer. Easy drinking for the style; definitely the best black I've tasted. Shame it's so hard to get down here in Texas. :("
"D-- Drinkable yes. This is ment to be savored in a big way. First really big East Coast beer I have had that could pass for a West Coast. ABV is very well hidden because of the aggressive pine/ hop taste. Malt is there at first but the hops take over once it opens up more. I guess the irony is when I lived in AZ/CO I would not have seen this beer for a long time, distribution, good to see it in Australia."
"This brew pours a nice jet cola hue with decent carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head with lacing all splattered around the edges of the glass,it has a real citrus fruity hop aroma to it with a caramel,toffee malty background very inviting,the taste is beautiful with a nice smooth creamy mouthfeel and big hints of caramel,toffee,expresso and some fruity hops which are beautifully blended together to make no taste a standout just a real nice mix of all and its ABV of 9.0% is so well hidden its not funny i could drink this all night and in saying that this so far for me has to be my most favourite Southern Tier brew to date and will be buying more of this delicious brew without a doubt."
"Drinkability: The only thing holding this beer back is that it might be a touch sweet for me. Nonetheless, its an easy go to DIPA for a hops fix. I might keep this on hand during the summer months, but for the winter and colder months this feels like a great winter style DIPA. Its warming, filling and complex, making it a great brew. If you havent tried this sucker, go get one and enjoy."
"A really drinkable beer with lots of flavour and a bit of a twist. Very enjoyable."
"This is strong at 9.00% ABV but that never got in the way of how this tasted. For the winter, this is a great choice as it combines several styles that are popular this time of the year. One of the better beers I've had recently and like their Hop Sun, another niche offering that Southern Tier should be proud to have in its lineup!"
"a nifty twist on the D/IIPA. full points for originality, really (unless, i suppose, it was brewed with ""american strong"" in mind)"
"Fairly easy drinker and very complex beer. Well crafted and interesting, not sure of categorizing as a double IPA, but also not sure where else it fits per style. A nice beer that should be consumed if found on the shelves."
"Superb."
"Almost dissapointing in the palate. Not as bitter as I'd hoped. That being said, it delivers in all departments very well. Citrus hops mingle well with chocolate malts and roasted malts. Very good, kind of wish they'd up the bitterness. It's balanced. Maybe that's my problem...."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, especially given the abv. Refreshingly good as my 2nd ST beer, definitely implores me to continue sampling their offerings."
"A dark brown color is poured, with a light tan colored head that is inch and half high. The head clings and laces to the glass, leaving its mark as slowly creeps down. A dark bread aroma hits the nose, bringing dried fruit fragrance as well. A malty scent lingers in the nose for some time. The malt attacks the palate with bread, biscuit, and touches of coffee and chocolate flavors. The taste finishes with a grassy, pine, and earthy bitterness to balance it all out. A thin feel at the front then moving towards a heavy water feel gaining weight to become more of the texture of skim milk. The back of the palate is left with a mild dryness. This beer is malt strong, that dominates the aroma and taste. The color is dark and inviting, the texture is the touch that makes it a great beer."
"An interesting beer. I like it, but am confused. I guess that's the point. ;-)"
"D - off the charts for something this strong (in both gravity & flavor)"
"Pours black, but when held to light you can see dark brown highlights. Has a nice off white head that leaves tons of lacing along the glass. Smells like a good ol' hop bomb, but with a slight twist. Lots of tropical citrusy hoppy goodness in the front but right in the background there's some sweet roasty malts. With the first sip I'm assaulted by loads of citrus hoppiness, but right behind there's sweet malt, chocolate, licorice and a slight smokiness. Great balance. Lots of hop flavor here with little hop bitterness. Very smooth in the mouth. Each sip leaves me wanting more. Not a hint of alcohol. Very nice brew."
"Mouthfeel, decent, doesn't fade, just keeps being mysterious. Drinkable, yes, as you keep wanting to drink more hoping to find the answer to its riddle, but alas, I missed."
"D - This beer was one of the best beers I have had from Southern Tier, which is saying a lot because I love this brewery, kudos for making one of the most unique beers I have every tasted"
"Pours clear brown with a thick and creamy, white tan head. The dark brew gives off strong aromas of citrus hops. The drink is different. Roasted malt flavors with hints of coffee flow through the light body and high carbonation levels and then are overwhelmed by a sudden explosion of citrus hop bitterness. The combination of dark malts, light body, and outrageous hoppyness is new to me and to be honest, I wasn't ready for it. The common balance was not present and the contrasting flavors made it hard to drink."
"D: A nicely crafted beer, easy to drink, goes down well, I would opt for others of the style though."
"I had this beer last in a flight of IPAs and DIPAs so there is a good chance some of the hop character was muted due to the prior beers. With that being said, I still really enjoyed this."
"CHEERS!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and slightly creamy. Drinkability is good. I enjoyed this one on several occasions now and probably will many more. A nice choice when wanting something different."
"This has been the best beer I have tried from ST. Would love to try this fresh from the tap."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Had this on tap after in the same glass I had a bottle of Dark Horse Double Crooked Tree IPA immediately before it, so I can't say this is accurate. Pours a pitch black color with a nice beige head that leave a sticky lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine, with dark malts beneath it. Taste is surprisingly bitter, with molasses and roasted malt leading the way, and finishing with a lot of hop bitterness. Full mouthfeel that hides the ABV."
"My sister sent me a couple of these from my hometown brewery. Deep dark ruby brown pour with nice creamy carmel head and great lacing. The nose is huge and complex. Pine, citrus, dark fruit, rasins, bread, and chocolate. It seemed like each time I smelled it I found something new. The taste was much the same as the nose. Very unique style that seemed like a cross between a German Schwarzbier, a Porter and an Imperial IPA. Really complex, well balanced and surprising. Not at all what I had expected. Dark fruit, rasins, chocolate, oak, citrus, and a touch of vanilla. Chewy, but not as much as I expected. Really nice mothfeel, not so syrupy and sweet like a few of their offerings have been as of late. It's actually quite drinkable for a big beer, but that's what Southern Tier does best. Why couldn't they have existed when I lived in Western NY???"
"D: Very impressed with Iniquity. A well-balanced ale that is strong on both hops and sweet malts. Well crafted and a different type of experience for lovers of IPA/DIPA."
"D: I like it, but it's fairly big & bold."
"D-this is so well balanced and has such big flavors with a great mf, another great seasonal from ST!"
"Overall, an exceptional beer that perfectly blends the hoppy ADIPA with a smooth malt flavor. Yet another excellent offering from ST. Most highly recommend. Rotation - not avail in TX so got in a trade. If here, it would be a regular. For now, I'll be trading for more for sure."
"A small brown/black body with two-finger head that left sheath lacing down glass. Smells like a regular DIPA w/ a strong citric/floral hop smell with some minor roasted and sweet malt. Great mix of hops and malts for a balanced taste in a medium-bodied beer that goes down smooth with a little dry kick in the finish. Reall hoppy as you drink it and yet it still has some light stout like qualities with a little bit of sweet caramel and coffee in the backend. A great blend that ST pulled off and very enjoyable."
"This beer has great balance and is very pretty. Would highly recommend this to hop-heads."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D-Too much of a boozy feel to be repeatedly enjoyed--quite surprised, as Souther Tier usually manages to hide the alcohol extremely well."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is well hidden, and makes this a very drinkable beer. The flavours are well balanced, and the malts are more prominent in this beer than most DIPAs."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is perfect. Full bodied, smooth, velvety, a little oily; like a pillow on your tongue. Drinkability is really nice. A superb beer."
"Pretty cool beer with the IDA idea showing up all over the place. Pours almost jet black but the nose says IPA. The malt is quite strong but the hops are more dominant especially as the beer warms up. I like the thick mouthfeel ( a ST trademark) and the drinkability for such a big beer. IDA's take the IPA into more Fall/ Winter territory ."
"Beer is overall sweet with a slight roast in the back. There is some hop flavoring and bitterness but they are understated and well balanced with the rest of the beer. Beer is smooth and his a nice medium body to it. Definitely a repeat, my wife also really loved this beer. Drinkability high."
"D- Very drinkable, despite the higher ABV. I easily could enjoy an entire bomber on my own."
"Not sure what to make of this confusing beer. Sort of a milk stout-DIPA combination. I think Southern Tier did a good job of of accomplishing what they set out to brew, but seems like kind of a novelty beer. Tasty, but I would prefer either a porter/milk stout and get my dark malts, or to drink a DIPA and have my hops less muddled."
"Overall, not as strong as a DIPA should be in hops and not that impressive as a malt offering. The flavor profile could use a little work. Enjoyable overall, but it does fall short at times."
"Drinkability: Showing no sign of the 9% ABV its easy to find your self going through this one a little bit too quickly. This was the first black IPA I've had and was very impressed with it. Certainly something that I would purchase again."
"This one is different but good, a unique idea, great for winter."
"Southern Tier Iniquity pours a good finger of sandy foam over an almost opaque black brew. The nose is toasty mocha notes, sharp herbal hops and a bit of alcohol heat. The flavor reflects the nose- espresso, mocha, with molasses notes balanced with herbal/piney west coast hops. What to call this- a black IPA, maybe? In any case, there's a very fine balancing act here- the burnt espresso and hop notes never really overshadow the sweeter aspects of the malts here- the overall effect is smooth, yet assertive. Mouthfeel is round, drying a bit in a hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol is 9% ABV, which is only apparent in the nose and as a warming sensation- share, or take it easy. Whatever this thing is, it is good- seek some out if you can!"
"Conclusion: This is really interesting, my first Black IPA. It's really pretty similar to a good, drinkable DIPA, but with a little more"
"A big dark IPA. Well balanced. Trouble is, balance is between orange and licorice - do those go together? As complex as it is, I'm just not compelled to actually keep drinking it. Interesting nonetheless."
"Overall this is another solid incarnation of the Black IPA. I didn't know what to expect after reading the bottle but I did know to expect something good and ST delivered. Well worth a shot."
"If you can just ignore what you know about beer this might be a beer for you. To me it isn't that excellent tasting to allow me to forget the faults and recommend it."
"I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. I think that the bottle I purchased might have sat on the shelf for a bit too long since there was only minimum hop flavor. I plan to try this again and see if the beer scores the same."
"This is an extremely good and very unique beer. It's definitely more on the IPA side of things with the hops showing out, but the sweetness of the malts and chocolate make for an intriguing and very drinkable mix. The alcohol is completely unnoticeable."
"Pours dark, dark brown with deep red highlights. Modest tan head appears coarse with large bubbles. The aroma is a harmonious blend of citrusy hops and roasty malts. This beer becomes far more engaging in the flavor with sweet bitter orange and chocolatey roasted malts with some licorice in the finish. Full-bodied and a touch sweeter than I was expecting, but enjoyable throughout the entire bomber. I'm definitely a fan of this hybrid style and look forward to finding more examples (probably with lower ABV, and therefore higher drinkability) to satisfy either an IPA and/or porter craving simultaneously."
"Not sure what it is, but its nice and tasty. Give it a try."
"D - This is a great brew from Southern Tier. I'm really becoming a fan of the Black IPA style and this is a great example."
"Mouthfeel: A little chewy. Not heavily carbonated, but you can feel the bubbles on the tip of your tongue. Slight warming in the aftertaste from the higher ABV."
"Drinks a bit slow due to the complexity & ABV, but I really liked this one. I suspect this one may not please hardcore hopheads, but I dig it! Every sip seems different to me, wish I had a few more to see if I can replicate this! Seems almost like a blend of a great DIPA & Imp Stout & may be..."
"D- An enjoyable beer that goes down nicely for the ABV. I kind of dig this black DIPA thing."
"Drinkablity is off the charts. I was guessing 6.5-7.5% abv but at 9% the alcohol is very well hidden. I have finished a bomber in under 20 minutes and I'm just now starting to feel the effects."
"Pours dark brown, almost black color with 1/2 inch of tan head that has good retention. The head eventually settles to a thin cap. Sheets of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is nothing like I expected in a dark beer. They used dark malt but there is no roasted charactor to this beer. I smell chocolate, citrus, and dark fruit. You can definately taste the C-hops in this beer but bitterness stays at the moderate level. There are hints of dark fruit and dark chocolate as well. Alcohol is well hidden. Again this is nothing like a hopped up porter or stout. The malt profile is more like a Schwarzbier. Has a substantial body with a wonderful creamy, soft texture. It is a pleasure to drink. The high ABV is the only limiting factor in the consumption of this beer. One of my favorit ST beers."
"Feel and Drinkability: This is an easy drinking beer, body is light. Its a bit deceiving since this beer is so dark in color....one suspects that it'll be heavy since its jet black in color, but its really just the opposite. The body is medium-light. Esters from the yeast and the black patent flavor last long on the palate. Carbonation is somewhat prickly but works with the beer, I think something softer would be even better but, hey, that's just me. This is a good beer, but for the price I'd rather be drinking Sublimely Self Righteous. No qualms with the feel, not really. As far as drinkability, I'd drink another one, if I saw it in a bar I'd prolly get it, but going out to specifically get this, prolly not going to happen again."
"Southern Tier's Inequity pours very dark, almost pitch black - very much like a stout. In the light, it loses some of the darkness and becomes a very dark red. The pour yields very little head. I poured my allotment into a pint glass, but since my roommate bought the beer he got the tulip and that didn't have much head either. There's very, very little lacing on the glass as you drink it. The smell is something you wouldn't expect from the look of the beer out all. Depending on your experience with IPA's or beer in general, it can be a real mindfuck. You really, really expect a stout when looking at this, however your nose picks up a bit of grapefruit and hops. Then once you taste it, oooh. Wow. Your mouth does not expect this at all! While it may be a very straight forward IPA, cascade hops and grapefruit charactersitcs, the true joy of this comes from the look. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great tasting IPA it's just the look! Crazy. The novelty of this beer makes it a definite purchase (if you like IPA's) if you've never had it before, after that is left up to your discretion! It drinks well, the mouthfeel is thick enough and it's very drinkable - not too bitter."
"Like all arch nemeses, Iniquity shares strong connections with it's foe (the budding, obnoxious hoppiness). It may also be its most threatening enemy - if there's anything that can compete with Southern Tier's DIPA it's their ""black"" DIPA. In fact, the first time I tried this a friend had split his bottle with me. I loved it so much I had to go buy more for myself. Hum, looks like it may also turn out to be Un*Earthly's most recurring enemy too..."
"Southern Tier has many, many more hits than misses. In fact, their misses fit on one hand with fingers to spare. In the still sparsely populated category of Black DIPAs, Iniquity is a bull's eye. I would gladly pay $6.99 for another bomber. And another... and another... and another..."
"Alcohol hits a little hard, but man this is a very easy sipper."
"Dark black, held up to the light, some bloody crimson burgundy colors. Nose is a mix of a DIPA grassy hops and some malt notes of raisons brown sugar, bready, etc. Taste is more on the malt side, a bit syrupy, a bit chocolate, on the sweet side. Definitely way better as it warms up.. high abv is totally hidden. I'm not overly impressed but certainly a nice beer."
"Very interesting beer here, almost like a stout and IPA combination. Original, dynamic and pretty friggin' tasty."
"Chocolate, cocoa, cream, hops all blended together in beer frappe (thick body, low carbonation). The aftertaste is bitter and lasts for at least fifteen seconds."
"A very interesting twist on an IIPA. Putting this in a 12 ounce bottle would be enough. Definitely worthy of a try."
"Plenty of sweet malt, anise, chocolate in the aroma. Pine needles sticking the mouth on the quaff, with a hoppy black licorice arriving at the finish. Very different brew, never had one with so much sweet anise in the mix. Gets a bit cloying by mid-bottle A strong beer, but the alcohol never shows up."
"Pours a two finger dark cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep, clear amber/mahogany color. Grapefruit hop nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is malts and grapefruit hops that are really well balanced. Nice imperial black. $6.49 for a 22oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"A very interesting beer. Tough to see this as a double IPA as hops are far from the focus here. Rather, lots of dark fruit and alchohol. This one seems closer to an american barley wine. Regardless, very enjoyable to sip and savor."
"Poured a very deep brown, almost black, with a one finger head with that quickly faded to a thin skin. The aroma was chocolate covered grapefruit. The taste, wow, this is an interesting beer. There is both chocolate and citrus hops. Who da thunk that would have made a good combination, but it did! The feel was medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability was fairly good, just a little sweet to have two bombers. A pleasant surprise."
"I liked what this brought to the table, style wise, and as I mentioned before, seemed much more robust than some others. My only issue was with the ABV of this, which didn't always work well with the hops and darker malts aspects of this, definitely cutting down on the drinkibility some. This is one to take your time with."
"Drinkability: An excellent IBA/Dubbel style beer that goes down easy for a higher ABV brew. I easily had a couple of these from the tap and could have had more if the ABV was lower."
"Pours a cola and molasses brown color with a nice, brown, one finger head. Most definetly does NOT look like an IPA. The Unearthly hops give a freash zest of citrusy grass, but the dark malt bring aout roasted nuts, coffee, and chocolate to this malty hop bomb. Starts with coffee, cocoa, and orange and citrus smashing togethe into to one homagenous flavor upfront. h texture comes up with some oily feelings to match the really bitter coffee in the middle. The adds the heat from the alcohol to this dark and Unearthly bitter concoction. Prettys unique beer with its style bending qualities an allure. This beer is a contemplative sipping brew."
"Drinkability- One of the better beers of the night. Great all around. I'd like another please!"
"Drinkability: Interesting. While I am not sure I would throw this int he ring with other Imperials IPAs, it is certainly good. Just not the same level of extreme hoppiness one expects from the other IIPA/DIPAs. Rmeinds me in many ways of a dark lager in that the flavors are similar to a standard IPA, but have the additional maltiness and color of darker grains."
"D: Quite refreshing and drinkable. A nice balanced blend of flavors between the smokiness, sweetness, and bitterness."
"I'll call it an interesting experiment that didn't win me over. Don't think I'll be going back for another one of these."
"Drinkability: Not sure I would call this an imperial IPA but it is a very very good beer. It almost drinks like a light RIS and is dangerously sessionable although due to the high ABV one is enough. It is odd that such a dark beer can drink this light. Another Southern Tier triumph and one of my favorites of theirs."
"OVERALL: Very enjoyable and drinkable brew. Listed as a DIPA, but everything points more to an Imperial Stout. The nose gave the impression of a DIPA, though the flowery and citrus hop notes stopped there. An good brew I'd certainly have again, but wouldn't reach for if I were in the mood for a DIPA."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly hoppy, with some malts, with some spices. The taste is hoppy, malty, sweet, bitter, with some spicyness. Medium body. Drinkable, I would not call it a DIPA."
"Had this on-tap at the Blind Pig in Champaign. Pour was thoroughly black, with no light shining through even when I hold it to the light. Mocha head sitting on top. Smell is hops, pine, some caramel malt. Interesting combination. The taste is a delicious and perfect balance of hops and dark chocolate malt. Some toffee, and more hops. Absolutely delicious. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Light carbonation. The drinkability is very high. 9% abv? I think not! Couldn't even taste the alcohol. India Black Ale is really a great way to describe it, as it stands out from your typical IIPAs as well as your typical stouts. Really an amazing beer."
"Quite roasty malty up front, tobacco. Nice fruity zest of hops pokes it's little old head out for a minute- cranberrry, strawberry, light citrus. Caramel sweetness in the middle. Hop zest in the rear. Maltier than what I was expecting. I guess the hop flavor is under the malt. I appreciate their effort here."
"Notes: I want to be positive but this beer was nearly ruined by the hop presence."
"D - Fine beer especially for the ABV."
"The beer is medium full bodied with medium carbonation and a thing, unsatisfying mouthfeel. A mediocre, unmemorable stout masquerading as a black Double IPA."
"Nice drinkability, but at 9% ABV, this one could sneak up on a person. Unique beer indeed. I would call this a hoppy quad or a hopped up stout. Either way, very good. I would drink this again. Another solid beer from ST."
"Drinkability- Extremely delicious and grows on you as you go, you certainly have no clue how big the alcohol is but certainly a sipper, it has nice longer finish starting to become reminiscent of a barley wine, overall a good drinkable brew"
"Pours a dark brown with a small bubbly off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of mild grapefruit, some earthy hops, a bit of chocolate and light caramel. The taste is a smooth light chocolate and caramel earthy hops with a bit of that ""c" hop twang in the back of your mouth. Prunes, raisins, some brown sugar in there as well. Slight alcohol burn leads to a smooth hop finish. Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation, thick body. WOW that one is different. Beautifully complex brew. ST is continuing to knock them out of the park IMHO. Start sending em to NH already will ya!!!"
"D - I quite like it, but I wish it didn't have a dry feel."
"D: Pretty drinkable, especially for such a twist on a traditional style, really like their creativity."
"No head to speak of. My gentle pour caused a light head. Color was a deep, dark brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very dry, chocolate, malty, dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium with soy sauce, prunes, raisins, bourbon, grapefruit, pineapple, and chocolate on the tongue. Finish had a salty medium finish that lingered. Another beer to share."
"D- Good drinker I will be buying this again since it's now in Indiana. Good beer to try when you want something new."
"Drinkability: Tastes more like a schwarzbier than a DIPA. That being said, I should probably rate this beer lower than I will because I'm not sure it lines itself up with DIPAs. However, it is still a tasty brew. I would have again, but wouldn't seek out."
"Overall: next!"
"Another nice snag from my quick visit to the Piggly Wiggly at Market Commons in Myrtle Beach, SC. This one pours a deep cola brown if held to the light other wise it looks like a huge dark black schwarzbier. Head is light beige tan and rises well above the rim of my glass, looks like bready rising, lacing is streaked evenly with each sip and makes the beer look very appetizing. Aromatics have deep herbal and pine like hop cone action going on amongst deep dark roasty malts, and a touch of mellow alcohol in the background. I'm getting some herbal mint like qualities amongst the dark bitter chocolate roasts. Flavor is fantastic, one of the dark semi sweet chocolates with a dry finish, enough malts give it a caramel roasted malt flavor but overall very hoppy expressive flavor that includes more herbal and aggressive pine hop action to the enjoyable Imperial Black Ale I have in front of me. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a touch of cloying milk chocolate syrup notes, carbonation level is carried well here nothing that makes me want to pour it out, very enjoyable in fact. Much more so than other hopped up dark ales with the higher alcohol contents. I split this with my wife, who typically enjoys darker offerings, I ended up finishing more of this than she could handle. I think the hop forward approach in this dark caught her off guard."
"Found Iniquity on the shelf and decided to give it a try, after all, Southern Tier rarely makes an undrinkable beer. Poured dark chocolate, minimal head with light lacing. Nose is heavenly, slightly hoppy,but the sweet roasted malts come through to balance the flavour. Taste and smell go hand in hand, can detect the hops, however the maltiness is quick to balance. Very smooth finish, and quite enjoyable. I would buy more of these when I see them!"
"I didn't really know what to expect coming in to this tasting, but I left very surprised and pleased. Also, this was on sale and I was lucky to pick up a few bombers!"
"PS - Overlord, good call with the Arrogant Bastard similarities....after reading your review, I can taste that connection."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. I would love to be able to get this whenever I wanted but for now I'll have to stick to trading."
"D: This is a unique and outstanding beer. Great balance and flavor, and great texture. Southern Tier just puts out one great beer after another, they are easily one of my favorite brewers. Iniquity is a well crafted brew, to say the least."
"Pour looks thin, but it's completely opaque with fluffy tan head standing about 1.5 inches high. Nose is somewhat muted, but there's that tell-tale cascade aroma sitting on top of some black malt/burnt malt aromas. Palate is crisp and flavors are complex and mingling. Crisp hoppiness up front is quickly tallywhacked black chocolate malt which is supported by a net of alpha-acid and lemon zest. Medium- to light-bodied (esp. for the style) and crisp like any great black lager (I know it's an ale). Does well as my first ""Imperial Black Ale."" Nicely done, would like more body though."
"22oz bomber served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a deep brown/black with about a finger of tan head. Big piney hop aroma with chocolate malt. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest. Starts off with some cocoa. Medium bodied. Hops in the middle and finish. More chocolate that really lingers in the finish. Very interesting and unique beer that really worked for me."
"Well, nice bubbly mouthfeel, and a good brew."
"Overall: Excellent sipper. This is one of those beers that basically astounds me every sip, not because the flavors change but because it's so well balanced and intriguing. I could sip this and stare into a fire for hours. Highly recommend."
"D: This one goes down so much more smoothly than I expected. It disappeared quickly."
"The sweet sort of blackness blended with genuine IPA hop maks for a drinkable beverage. It's a really light sweetness--I don't know the calorie content, but (minus the alcohol) it seems like a dieter's dream...uh, as far as sweet beers go. A really strong offering from Southern Tier--not just the antithesis of Unearthly (as the bottle suggests), but better."
"Picked up this bottle in Buffalo. Pours a pure black with a finger of off-white head. Decent retention and lace. The aroma is good - a mix of chocolate and coffee with some lovely c-hops. The flavour is not quite as hoppy as I expected, and shows more balance than usually found in southern tier's big beers, while also dropping the booziness that they tend to have. Chocolate and lightly roast coffee mix in with some smoke before hitting a good splash of grapefruit and some pine in the finish. Simple, but good. Medium body and carbonation. Drinkability is high for an imperial. Nice stuff from ST!"
"Pours a cola like dark brown almost black color with a tan head that gives way to good lacing. The smell is of coffee and chocolate as well as citrus and piney hops. The taste is of malt chocolate and sweet malts at the front end. The taste is balanced out by citrus and piney hops for a bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little syrupy but overall it is very good. The overall drinkability is very high, it is an overall very complex beer with a lot of malt and hop balance."
"The 9% is a bit dangerous. The combination of sweetness with the light body and hops make it very drinkable, and very easy to forget that you're drinking 9%."
"D- This beer is a nice IPA with a twist of some soft mellow dark malt notes. Interesting concept that was nice to drink."
"Imperial Black Ale? That's what Southern Tier calls it, and the name is rather fitting. In character, perhaps a bit of a combination of New Belgium's Enlightened Black Ale and a nice hefty DIPA, but with pronounced Imperial Stout leanings as well. Very interesting and very, very tasty. Definitely a must-try."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and slightly sticky. Very enjoyable."
"A little boozy, not overwhelming but there for sure. Chewy and nice light carbonation."
"Pours a slightly dark brown, somewhere between a traditional IPA and a stout. Head like a stout, same mocha color and billoweyness. Smells like sweet hops basically, except unlike a busy malty IPA like DFH 90, they really blend together quite well. Mostly earthy, a bit of pine, not much citrus. Taste is great - the flavors compliment each other. It's like drinking a real earthy IPA, except without the huge pine sensations, the malt sweetness drives it. Almost like a real hoppy brown or some such. If you're looking for a real strong DIPA, this isn't it. If you're looking for a great balance between malt and hop, this is the target. Nice coating mouthfeel, and sublimely drinkable. For me, who isn't a huge fan of IPAs, especially huge malty confused ones, this walks the line perfectly. Bravo!"
"Just had to check the ABV. 9%. Wow, be careful with this one, it drinks real easily."
"Here's what I love about Southern Tier. I haven't had too many of their stuff yet, but everything I've had is robust and flavorful. Good stuff all around."
"If this were a normal-colored Imperial India Pale Ale, I might not score it as highly as I am. The fact is though that this beer tastes like a double IPA and looks like a porter. The sensory head-trip is really fun and makes this a great beer to spring on a party. The sense of play that the brewmasters at Southern Tier imbued this beer needs to be acknowledged and taken into account. Fun, tasty, hoppy... this is a recommended beer."
"Oh, another thing about the label, they call it an Imperial IBA. Firstly, I thought the TTB did away with any abbreviations on labels, but regardless, I'm guessing they're calling it an Imperial Brown Ale, or is that Imperial Black Ale? Imperial Blacl Ale fits better. But whatever you call it, I'm drinking it! The darkened malt and citrus-pine hops just go together so well, and despite its strength it's oh so drinkable! Additionally, althought it's not really complex (...a couple of malt notes here, some yeasty fruit there, a few shining hop flavors, and some bitterness...), it's actually very unique. I've never had a beer like it before, and that makes it interesting enough for me. Well done, and given that uniqueness, well worth trying. Kudos once again to Southern Tier!"
"Iniquity smells like roasted malt, dark chocolate, a dose of hops in there as well. Sipping this offering from Southern Tier, it tastes rich, sweet, some of that strong alcohol comes through in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is thick and strong, but interesting in this imperial black ale, good idea to have some water after this beer. Drinkability is average on this heavy beer. It makes for a great beer to pair with a dessert such as a brownie sundae."
"D: Tasty and drinkable"
"Not a bad beer to drink and I would like to see if some time on it would mellow the alcohol, would also like to try it alongside some other foods, like something spicy."
"22oz bottle into two DFH Signature glasses shared with rtratzlaff. The beer pours a nearly opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice blend of brown malts and citrus hops. The taste is a nice balance of brown malts, cocoa, citrus hops and traces of pine and caramel. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence. I'm always eager to try hoppy dark beers, but this one was a bit of a let down."
"I could drink this all night...well...ummmm...I could drink this for a couple of hours only to wake up the next day in a puddle of chocolate colored drool, my thumb in a glass of lukewarm water, and my jeans soaked to a deep navy; With a headache and a smile."
"Fun and brutal. I couldn't see drinking a lot of this, or even very often. But this has a great deal of deviant charm."
"They're not kidding when they call this a black ale,it's very dark,no light will shine thru. This has a giant tan foamy head that lasts forever and leaves great lacing. The smell is pungent with dark fruit,hops,and roasted malt. The taste is nice with a buttery roasted malt,dark fruit,chocolate,and alcohol. This is a very unique brew. The m/f is light for a high octane beer and all the flavors mix well. A very memorable beer that you really must try."
"interesting take on the new ""black IPA"" style, with slightly more roast and coffee character than you would expect from a regular IPA. perhaps tough to drink more than a pint or two though."
"Drinkability - pretty tasty for a 9%er. The closest thing I've had to the local Double Dark IPA by Barrelhouse. Rock on, ST."
"Blipped a crazy cover of ""Black Hole Sun"" by Handsome Hank"
"Very interesting blend of IPA characteristics and porter/schwarz. One of the more unique brews out there and a good one on top of that. Just don't come in with any expectations."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied with very active carbonation. The bitterness coats the mouth and lingers. Definitely one I could sit down with for a long time."
"D) Delicious. Another great beer from Southern Tier. Great mix of dark and hoppy."
"Drinkability: I don't think my palate would want more than one of these in an evening. This is a really fun beer to drink though, and I'm glad I picked it up. Another buy from Southern Tier that will end up in my crate in the future."
"You would never know from looking at the bottle that this was a double IPA. Once you pour it, it's completely black, but not so thick. More like a black beer than a stout or a porter. The taste, smell, flavor, mouthfeel are all imperial IPA. If I had my eyes closed I'm not even sure I'd know it was black. Maybe the slightest hint of roasted barley. Another big score for Southern Tier."
"D- I don't think I'll go back to this one. Pretty much disappointed here."
"Overall a very fine beer that will sneak up on ya"
"Southern Tier are fast becoming one of the greatest U.S. brewers of all time, and I'm not surprised they've come up with another utterly fantastic beer with Iniquity. This is a winner, and one I would love to have on hand regularly."
"This beer pours very dark brown almost black in color with not much of a head. The aroma is slight with a little bit of chocolate and caramel. The taste is mildly sweet with a medium mouthfeel. There is a buttery feel of alcohol on the lips and the taste is pretty balanced. There is a mild bitterness in the finish the turns to an alcohol warmth and taste."
"This is just a great beer, unlike anything I have had recently. Certainly something I will visit again. A must try. Way too easy to drink, I am putting this thing down quick. This does not resemble many guidelines within its style, but its absolutely delicious!"
"not a session beer."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small white head. Aroma of sweet citrus, cappucino coffee, and light roasted malt. Flavor is sweet initially with a roasted malt/coffee finish. More on the brown ale side than the IPA side I think, but an interesting blend. A little sweet too. But I liked it overall."
"So unique, so unusual, so really delicious. The best of malt, the best of hops. Damn, what is up with these guys...? Just keep making the great beer, Southern Tier!"
"Here is a cross between a brown ale and a Double IPA. Delicious and worth seeking out."
"drinkability: ok"
"Poured into my Iron City Beer pint glass, the head dissipates quickly and leaves this beer looking like a glass of Coke. I suggest smelling/tasting this beer with your eyes closed; the color plays tricks with your mind, as you're expecting a roasty porter smell. Instead you're met with an IPAish aroma, but it seems muted. Inhale deeply, and the hops start to fill up your nose but stop short. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste, but it's not overpowering. Overall an interesting twist on an imperial IPA."
"Mouth is medium varbonation and slightly viscous. Drinks well and quite slow."
"This was an interesting beer, I would almost call it more of a porter than a IPA/DIPA. Doesn't seem as ""extreme"" as the other Southern Tier bombers, but is a pretty nice beer."
"Pours black with a very thin tan head. Nose is like older tea. No. It's iced tea! I hate iced tea. Try growing up in the very Deep South hating iced tea. Going to someones house for dinner and they don't put a glass of water out next to your plate; just a glass of iced tea. Flavor is bringing the tea yet again. Tea Beer. Really. That is what I am getting here. Feel has a nice enough carbonation and the liquid is fairly thicker. An interesting beer to say the least. I will say it again. This is a tea beer. Double/Impy IPA? Huh? I get almost no hop character whatsoever off this."
"Overall: A try it beer. Cheers!"
"D: A singular brew with a rare but excellent combination of dark malt with C-type hops created with great feel. A wonderful beer to come back to periodically, and not a bad value for the contents to boot."
"Drinkability: This was my first experience with a ""Black"" IPA and what a good experience it was. It was a very interesting beer. Not only was the beer roasted, but yet it had a touch of citrus flavors to it. If you want to try something out of the ordinary, then I would try this beer. Would I ever buy this beer again? Maybe once more, but that would be it."
"22oz. Just realized that this is classified as an Imperial IPA - interesting - I was expecting American Strong Ale. Poured near black with hues of chestnut at the edges of the glass when held to the light. Beige head is thin, but still respectable and it leaves a decent lacing on the glass. Aromas are of floral hops, citrusy grapefruit, and pine. A blind sniff would reveal an IPA or Imperial IPA - smells pretty good. Initial tastes are completely different than aroma - we've got roasted malts with slight hints of molasses and chocolate. These notes don't last long and are quickly taken over by a nice hop character - citrus with some pine notes, which really brings this all together to be an incredibly balanced ale. Overall, I really liked this one and wouldn't change anything about it. Definitely recommendable."
"Overall: Another nice selection from Southern Tier...I've been very pleased with their imperial beer selection, and this is no exception."
"Bitter and sharp on the finish, rounding out with a little roasted malt in the back palate. Lingering hops."
"On-tap at the Acadia Cafe in Minneapolis. I had a small glass during the bar's IPA tasting. I thought it was a nice change of change for big hoppy beers. I thought the malt profile landed it more in the neighborhood of an imperial brown ale. There's some dark roast in the flavor, but also toffee and caramel. And like a lot of imperial malty beers that try to be DIPA's in some sort, the hops don't quite dominate like they do in a regular IPA. Still, very tasty and enjoyable. Worth a try, though I'd just call it an American Strong Ale."
"D: I was glad to see that this wasn't yet another 11% ST beer. The alcohol is pretty well hidden and we really enjoyed the hoppy/sweet/roasted maltyness of this beer."
"Not sure I'll seek this one out again."
"Very clean and refreshing and another really well done beer by Southern Tier."
"Overall, this beer is pretty awesome. I like it alot better than Southern Tier's Unearthly and Hoppe. I also think this beer is more complex than Stone's SSRA. I just wish the flavors would coat your mouth a little more. Worth the time and money for sure."
"For drinkability, this is an awesome freaking beer. I will buy it again. I will search this beer out on tap. This beer is all substance, but no points for style. Call this beer an Imperial India Porter Ale, and you'd be dead on."
"Pours a typical black ale appearance; very dark brown, lighter on the edges, smallish tan head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a light citrus hop, some pine, and a bready honey malt. Kind of a funky hop aroma, not much in roasted malt. The taste is malty sweet (honey) like a traditional DIPA, some tin like hops with perhaps a touch of pine. There is a touch of roasted malt in the end. To me has very much the DIPA flavors, malty sweet though not very hoppy. No real roasted malt characteristics like a traditional black ale. Seems the color is the only true characteristic of a black ale. A nice moderate feel with prickly carbonation; finishes sweet but not cloying, nice balancing bitter hop. Just ok for me. Not a big fan of the flavors, too much of a honey malt DIPA quality. I was looking for a nice roasted malt but only got a bit. It does drink fairly easy as there are no dominate flavors and not too sweet or bitter."
"This is a very mellow brew and when it was fresh, it was likely more vibrant with the hops and warmer. However, I really like it and I'm glad I picked it up as this type of IPA is uncommon, Worth a shot if you enjoy ST's other IIPAs (UnEarthly, Hoppe and Gemini)."
"It's all a mish-mash of oddly-matched flavors, but it doesn't bring the brew down, though I wish it were a bit bigger. It's just unique."
"I was scared to get this one when I saw it poured on draught because of it's thick black pour. I couldn't resist. A beautiful and smooth BLACK ale with all the sweet aromas and flavours. I cannot resist getting bottles as well as draught. I will miss it when my work runs out of it."
"D: Good drinkability, nicely hopped with accents of soft roasted malting gives this a nice spin on an ipa. Smooth going down and defiantly good for a few."
"I like what Southern Tier did here. There are so many IPA's out there that remind you of this one or that one. This IPA takes a chance at something different, and that is OK in my book. It is ok to switch things up once in a while. Nice job."
"I bought this bottle at Blacklick Liquor on Broad Street a few weeks ago."
"D - A nice change of pace, but you definitely can't kill more than one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Goes down fairly easily while being slightly dry. Overall, this was a tasty black IPA, however I found it a bit on the sweet side malt wise."
"Very enjoyable beer..finishes a little citrusy acidic in the mouth but that is about the only complaint...very well done"
"Very dark brown, but when held up to the light it was clear and had a deep reddish chestnut colour. A fine cap appeared after the pour, settling to a collar with a skim of bubbles topping the beer. Good retention after that, with a lot of spotty lace. Big citrus aroma, tangerine and grapefruit, more rind and pith than flesh, plus a little pineapple. Malt was present, but far in the background, with some caramel and molasses. Sturdy bitterness, but really just enough to overcome the malt presence. Malty caramel and brown sugar sweetness were complemented by dried fruits (prunes, raisins) and a bit of roast. Toasty and a bit doughy with a pleasant fruitiness. Hops were in the grapefruit to pine range, but were balanced nicely with the malts. Medium+ bodied with carbonation a little less than average. Smooth, not much of an alcohol presence, perhaps a bit of alcohol spice in the finish and a hint of warmth. Quite good. Really drinkable for a bigger beer. The balance really worked for me."
"Overall, very different, and I'll have to try it again sometime."
"Complex, enjoyable, a balance between hops and malt. Go get this"
"Drinks fine for a noticeably stong brew. Interesting, and enjoyable for that."
"Expect a re-review of this one!"
"Pours out a dark brown color, light mahogany higlights, with a massive tan head. The head is formed with loose bubbles, which leave just little bits of lacing and kind of stays around for most of the drink. The smell is very nice, fruity, piney, resinous hops are sitting on top. There's a tiny bit of lemony citrus peel underneath, with a big chocolatey back. There's also a fruity, raisiny note underneath. I love the smell of dark, hoppy beers, so much complexity. The taste is really great too. There's a good hoppiness, but actually a very well hidden bitterness, with lots of flavor. I get so much orangey, lemony hop flavor, with a bit of tropical fruitiness, and some resinous flavors. Then the maltiness really kicks in, coffee, dark chocolate, a good bit of sweetness, like raisins of plums. No dryness, just very full flavor. I like it. It feels just a bit watery. At least more watery than I would've expected, very little alcohol presence (a good thing), a bit syrupy, kind of prickly carbonation. A pleasant drink. Easy to go down, and it won't hit you too fast, but I can already feel it about half way through. I would recommend it for the pure enjoyment."
"A: Midnight black with some crimson along the edge of the glass, thin layer of dense head, some lacing down the glass - 4.50, S: Touches of charred wood, fusel alcohol, pleasant hop aromatics - the citrusy and earthy varieties, a hearty fruit aroma such as fig or possibly an aroma of dates - 4.50, D: Lots of bitter chocolate, molasses, solid hop bite, noticeable alcohol, there is what tastes like a little green on the hops - 4.75, M: Slightest touch of graininess - 4.00, D: Another very impressive product from Southern Tier, extremely drinkable - one I will seek out again - 5.00"
"taste is of toasted malt, caramel, touch of pine, a little chocolate in the back, and some citrus, end is thick and a little bitter."
"i wouldn't call it an american iipa, and don't know if i'd even call it a black american iipa. the dark fruit makes me think more of something like a darker, hoppier, belgian strong dark ale. maybe belgian black ipa? no, it doesn't have that belgian yeast character, and the hops are still distinctly american... ah, who cares what we call it - it's a damn tasty beer that i'll definitely be picking up again."
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown, almost black, some red in the edges, slightly opaque, medium sized light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thick ring, leaves some nice lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, lots of floral and grapefruit hops, some pineapple, light caramel malt, dark fruits, raisins and grapes, brown sugar, a light toastiness, very lightly roasty. Taste is similar, sweet at first, caramel and brown sugar, biscuits, grapes and raisins, prunes, nice hoppiness, some floral and grapefruit, very fruity in the flavour, licorice, maybe a touch of roast, smooth balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth for the ABV, very balanced. Real nice beer, aroma is pretty hoppy, like Unearthly-lite, but the flavour is very fruity, good stuff. Thanks Russ!"
"D: ABV is very well hidden. A very drinkable brew, but not a session brew due to the extreme hop nature (and the ABV eventually catches up to you). Surprise your friends with this one...the dark color will not prepare them for the taste! Again, if you are a hop lover, seek this out."
"It is certainly an interesting experiment."
"Sniffing my glass after pouring this dark brew I was surprised to detect a floral scent, underneath which was a barely noticeable hint of alcohol. An impressive off white head frothed to the top of my glass. Taking a first sip, a floral hop flavor immediately hit, followed by a very mellow bitter chocolate flavor. As with the aroma, a scantily noticeable trace of alcohol was detected, but it did not detract from this delicious concoction."
"Drinkability: Much more like a dark Unearthly than the bottled version. This one actually tasted ""dark"" - does that mean it's better or worse? I'm not sure, but I do know that this one was more what I expected than the other. At 9%, it's not as big as the Unearthly either, enhancing the drinkability ever so slightly."
"Overall a good beer that I can only drink in small quantities. It turns out being very sweet that seems to take over the whole beer. Still, very different and a very solid beer."
"M - Thin bodied, creamy, good carbonation."
"Purchased on the advice of Kendo, and glad i did. Poured into an old Griffen pint glass, it looked a lot like soda, not quite black, with a decent head. I got the smelll of malt, coffee, and I thougt licorice as well, and that was reflected in the taste. It may be mistaken for a stout by appearance and smell, though not in mouthfeel, much thinner. A great brew by the great folks at ST again."
"Pours black body with a white generous head. Great C-aroma. Great taste of grapefruit, lemon with the malting making it a great complexity. Above-average moutheel. Good drinkability. A tad acidic, still one of the better beers I have had, regardless of being a DIPA."
"The beer poured a rich black with a nice tan head. The aroma is of toasted malt, coffee, and hops. It tastes of sweet toasted malt front end with a hoppy coffee finish. The feel is medium and dry. This was a very enjoyable beer, nice and rich, the malt up front was so enjoyable it allowed me to appreciate the bitterness in the finish."
"D - A nice beer, but in the end, nothing too special here. A bigger dose of malt would result in a more layered presentation and could tone down some of the pine."
"Wow. A definite surprise for me. I'm used to their excessively malty beer, but in this one it works. You may not have heard about it when it came out, but Iniquity is a beer worth drinking."
"D - A very good black IPA if you will, but one of the best of the hoppy black ales. Nice Hop flavors which tak priority over the bitterness and the black malt is not bitter. The malt adds roastiness but still allows the hops to shine throuh. Highly recommend this ale - another great example of the style."
"D: I guess there really wasn't another style to categorize this beer in other than imperial IPA. It's not necessarily apt, but this is definitely an excellent, drinkable beer."
"D-Wow! This is damn good stuff. Another Southern Tier Imperial brew that rocks! Full of flavour, truly a nice surprise!"
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle split with psycohops and Deuane. Poured into a shaker glass. Appears a deep and dark, but still translucent brown color with about a finger of light tan foam. Smells and tastes of fresh candied orange and lemon peels dusted with cocoa powder, full of fruity, citrus hop notes with an ample amount of roasted grain and caramelized malts. Rather smooth drinking with little to no alcohol presence and medium carbonation. Delicious and dangerously drinkable."
"Thanks for the bottle, Alan (BanditBrewingCo)!"
"This poured a translucent mahogany with light tan head. It smelled like copper and grapefruit hops and sweet honey, with some roasted coffee. It tasted like grapefruit and pineapple and orange, along with roasted coffee and sweet honey. It was fairly thick with smooth carbonation, and had a mild aftertaste. Overall this was an excellent black IPA, maybe better than Stone's! It had great delicate flavor that was well balanced and very clean. It had great body too, and was quite easy to drink. I just love this beer."
"Had this several times since and have to say on each revisit have found the malts a bit heavy handed and artificially sweet. Still worth trying."
"Another successful experiment from ST. I think it could be slightly less sweet, but it delivers everywhere else. Reminds me of a ""black and tan"" I had with a sweet east coast IPA and a nice balanced stout, if you were to stir it up."
"Pours very dark with minimal light coming through. Not much of a head but tremendous lacing. Smells very floral, citrusy, tropical fruits...hop bomb. Tastes of more huge hoppiness, citrusy, pine, melon, hints of alcohol, light roastiness. Delicious. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, perfect carbonation. Very enjoyable and drinkable...fantastic tasting Hop Burps!"
"On tap at Rustico. Pours brown with half a finger's worth of tan head. Strong, delicious floral hop taste giving way to chocaltey-sweet goodness, combining to amazing aftertaste and the best hop burps ever. Very drinkable at 9%, no noticeable burn. I've had a few of these black IPAs (they seem to be all the rage) and this one was unique. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability- Extremely. Even at 9% alcohol this beer is one I could enjoy multiple times in a night."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes slowly into moderate lacing. The aroma is of citrus, grapefruit, and pine resin with traces of malt in the background. The taste is full of hops, but the part I like most is the roasted malt backbone. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good beer. I'm not sure what an ""Imperial Black Ale"" is suppose to taste like, but I am sure that this beer works."
"Pours sinfully dark with an absolutely HUGE foamy light tan head that fades slowly. Tons of Belgian lacing left behind with each mouthful. Is that to style? P*s on that! It's better than looking through a pale fizzy yellow beverage. The smell comes across to me like a candied grassy pine, huge sweetness behind it, and a lemon-vanilla combination. I've picked up on that common thread with the last couple of beers that ST has rolled out. It dominated the oak-aged unearthly; its as if there were leftovers from the brulee. Full flavored, the taste is a balance of extremes; big tangy grassy lemon minty hops married with an overly stated sweetness. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel almost burns from the hop and alcohol combo. That hoppy business is all up in the front and on the tip of the tongue while the back of the mouth bathes in sweetness. It gives the impression of being lighter in body. The taste and spicy burn lingers significantly. A really interesting beverage!! I hope my tastes aren't changing that drastically...i wasn't looking for that much sweetness. The 9% ABV warmed the chest nicely. Totally different experience than XI."
"Overall another EXCEPTIONAL beer from ST. One of the best I've ever had. They never cease to amaze me."
"Poured fairly black but with red highlights at the bottom of the glass when held up to light. The super thick and frothy light brown head was crazy. The lacing was also thick and frothy as the head refused to leave the side of the glass. Aroma is of piney hops mixed cough syrup. Kinda tastes liek a strong ale but the alcohol taste is well hidden, the throat warmth is present though. This is quite balanced, the super sweet maltiness is balanced by the piney hops. Feel is moderate and smooth but slightly tingly to the tounge. As fun as this is to describe this beer almost tastes too mild, like there is too much balance. Drinkable, but the plainest strong beer ive had from southern tier. One of the few misfires from this brewery."
"Mouthfeel is is medium light bodied and clean with a nice amount of carbonation."
"Drinks very easy for the 9% ABV. Very tasty, mothman and I wish we had more!!"
"Dark mahogany. Clear. Thick and bubbly light brown crop of froth sits on top. Retention and lacing properties are very good. Great aroma of chocolate and resiny, piney hop tones. This fits the bill for a Black IPA. Closest thing I've had to Alpha Klaus, though this is a little different. The ""blackness"" of the beer and the ""hopness"" off the beer blend really nicely. Roasted and chocolate notes are form the malt base with gooey, resiny, sticky hop traits adding great character. The body is about medium or so and the carbonation is fairly restrained. VERY easy drinking. Alcohol damn near absent in this. Quite an accomplishment here."
"D: Oh yeah. 9%? Where? Gimme another!"
"Overall, a sweet looking DIPA. With a sweeter than normal taste. Still had the DIPA flavor. I wanted this beer to never be finished. I highly recommend!"
"D - it goes down nice and easy and at 9% abv that's the way it should be consumed."
"This is very good and very drinkable. Theres' a lot going on in terms of flavor, everything is balanced out very well with the hops and everything else playing supporting roles with each other and just weak enough in abv so two can go down relatively easy. I haven't had the XI by Stone yet but so far this is the best of this style I've had. After finishing two I still want to go for a third, only my buzz is stopping me."
"This one is classified on BA (at the time of this writing) as a Black DIPA. I say this doesn't make sense. Considering it has both black and pale in the name. I like the idea that's presented in the description on the bottle, as an IBA, or India Black Ale (or maybe Imperial?). Let's stop calling these beers, along with Stone's 11th Anniversary Ale as a Black IPA. First off, it's black, not pale. Also there is no history in this beer that has to do with India. Therefore, we drop the I and the P. So that leaves us with Black A, or Black Ale. Strictly and American style. It perfectly fits what's a porter that's basically highly hopped. We can put this beer, Stone 11th, and Flying Dog's Gonzo Porter in this area. You can have a Black Ale and and Imperial Black Ale (which would fit this one better. Everything makes sense, I know. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is thick, oily, buttery. Very heavily bodied. This beer is strong and challenging, but bursting with flavor. A superior beer. [Similar in style/flavor to Stone XI Anniversary ale, http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/38470]"
"I've never had a black IPA before, but i am impressed. The choice of hops and a moderate to mild roastiness works great together in this beer. A little rich from the sweetness brings down the drinkability a tad, but all in all, a great beer."
"M + D: A medium body, with a little slickness. Alcohol is hidden very nicely, though the flavours linger for some time. Could be an interesting aging candidate, even though it's a hop based beer. Pretty nice stuff."
"I shared this with a friend with high hopes.a bit of a let down.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep dark black but not opaque,a thinner but well retained off white head atop.A mix of left coast hop and bitter chocolate in the nose,quite bitter and earthy.Not the hop profile I was hoping for on the palate,it left me wanting more.Big earth and unsweetened chocolate on the palate,the hops seem more subdued in citric form.A nice beer but it left me wanting more."
"Drinkability: superb beer that you can't put down. The flavors are well balanced and if you are in the mood for a differnt big IPA this is the beer to buy."
"Dry finish makes me drink this one quicker than I should. By the time I sip and put down my glass, I'm ready for another sip. Good sign."
"Not as good as Stone SSR, but still pretty decent for us unfortunate souls who don't get Stone in our distribution network. Reminds me a little of GI Night Stalker as well, even though the hops used are different."
"D: This one gives Stone 11th a run for its money and is definitely one of the better black IPAs on the market. Go get some."
"All in all, as mentioned, it has some earth but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a nice, calm and dare I say it balanced offering from ST. I like what they did to weed out the patent tannins. Cool!"
"Overall a really, really good beer. This was a shocker for me as I was not expecting it to come across as good as it did. Really another very good offering from Southern Tier."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best. The alcohol is big time from the first sip, but the delicious taste and really nice feel keep me going."
"Not my favorite style, but a fantastic beer none the less. Reminds me of Old Man Winter taken to the extreme."
"D: I dont really enjoy this beer at all. I will probally never buy it again or order it at a bar. Overall I feel this beer is very bland. Not a single charecteristic shines on this beer."
"A unique and interesting offering from Southern Tier. The bold hoppy character of this brew coupled with the dark color is a cool combination. Not something that other breweries haven't tried out, but a very nice example to add to the group."
"Kudos again to the STBC!"
"Overall, interesting juxtaposition of the hoppiness against such a dark palate and color background. Regardless of the novelty factor, this is a damn tasty brew with a good deal of complexity for the style. Highly recommended."
"22oz. bottle served in my ST tulip at 48 degrees. Poured the color of cola with a half inch bubbly tan-colored head that sizzled and popped and quickly receded. Only a few specks of lacing were present during the tasting. Nose reveals light, floral hops aromas as well as a grainy quality. Taste was pretty subdued for the style - much more sweet malt comes out than hops. None of the sweet grapefruit that you get with Unearthly or other DIPAs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium-bodied with a consistent level of background carbonation, and finished fairly cleanly. Alcohol was well-hidden for a 9% abv and went back pretty easily. I have to say that I liked it, but I didn't love it. I usually love most of ST's big beers, but this one slightly missed the mark for me."
"Bomber, w/o freshness indication. Pours dark mahogany, dark tan head and ample spots and strands of lace. Bright nose of hop cones, fresh and pungent. Tasty, hoppy brew. Notes of more smooth, citric and pine. Smoothly over the tongue, with hints of milk chocolate, dark malts and more hoppy goodness. Enjoyable dark hoppy brew. Highly recommended. More High quality brew from NY state."
"D - Goes down easy enough, tastes good, and despite the high ABV is quite quaffable."
"I was excited to see this on the shelf of Whole Foods in Chelsea and it really delivered in the glass. I can't wait for more from Southern Tier."
"This may be my favorite yet from Southern Tier, great hop aroma and flavor, perfectly balanced with the black malt. The aroma as soon as you open the bottle is a mix of citrusy floral with malty chocolate. The taste was exceptional, as you drink a little more you discover all the flavors this beer has. Can't even tell that this is 9%. As the beer warmed up it got a little more malty flavor, more hop taste when colder. Easy to drink overall. I would highly recommend this. Can't wait to try it on draft."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable for a higher ABV beer. Really complex flavors make this beer unique. A black IPA seemed odd to me. I kind of like it though. After having this I see a whole new style to enjoy. As a homebrewer it is inspiring. As a craft beer drinker it is comforting."
"Drinkability: Moderate, very tasty overall -- the balance is interesting as it essentially goes from one end of the spectrum to the other (hop to malt) and the flavors don't necessarily blend, but follow each other. ABV is a bit high, but as long as I'm at home and/or not driving, I'm good to go with this beer."
"On tap and tasted on: 4/9/09"
"Drinkable...yep! Damn yummy and one solid brew. A milk porter with a great twist of hops - or a juicy IPA with a melange of dark malts? Whatever it is so deemed in style, it's great! One of the few fairly priced brews from Southern Tier to hit our market @ under $7 per bomber, you can't go wrong."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that lasts. The aroma is awesome. The hop aroma of this beer is out of this world. It has a huge citrus/floral scent with just a hint of black malt. The taste is great. It has a nice pale and black malt flavor that's roasted enough to give it color, but doesn't get in the way of the hops. It has such a fresh hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. I would like to do a side by side comparison with Stone's version of the same style. Recommended"
"I think this is a good beer but I also think that Southern Tier has the makings of a really exceptional one with a few tweaks. The darker malts never fully come together with the hops in the aroma, and even with the taste they don't fully complement each other. I think it's dry hopped a bit too much, resulting in the leafy and chalky aftertaste. Overall I think they need to try to marry the components together a bit better, and if they succeed they'll have a real winner. For now, though, it's good, but a bit of a jumbled mess."
"My first Southern Tier experience...I'm a big fan! Can't wait to try some more."
"Well done! Highly recommended to all IPA afficionados."
"Southern Tier Iniquity is a very dark (nearly black) ale with a thick, foamy, light brown head. It thins out a little but stays put to the bottom of the glass. It leaves a generous, thick sheet of foam all the way down the glass. It has a strong citrus aroma that's detected from arm's length. It's all grapefruit and pine. It is medium-full bodied and incredibly smooth and soft in the mouth. It tastes squarely between sweet and dry. It's very well balanced; hoppy, but not overly bitter. The finish seems to have a touch of roast or ash. It is thoroughly enjoyable and unique."
"Great mouthfeel, very smooth and full and consistent. Very drinkable."
"Overall a delicious and complex DIPA."
"Would definitely have this again, it's delicious but obviously not a session beer. Iniquity can be added to the long and ever growing list of great Southern Tier offerings."
"D- At 9% abv this beer is highly drinkable, I really love this beer. I wouldn't call it extreme, but it's really fun to drink."
"Light roasted malt flavors up front. Sweet dark fruits follow, before big hop flavor and bitterness takes over. Very resinous, with herbal notes and pineapple near the end. There's almost a dark chocolate and vanilla thing going on as well. Some fruity malt lingers in the otherwise bitter finish. Full-bodied with a creamy, smooth feel. Very nice mix of lightly roasted notes and big time hops."
"The finish is bitter with unsweetend chocolate, husky grains and some hops, but the hops are now mostly drowned out by the smoky bittering flavors. More hops, less smokey black grain huskyness."
"""Antithesis of Unearthly""? Sure, why not. Obviously they're looking for people to try them together. Perhaps I'll update if I try it."
"Notes: the keg kicked while I was at Lionheart last night. Based on that and the fact that I heard quite a few people ordering it earlier, it seems to be popular. I can understand why. Another winner from ST worth seeking out."
"D: Took a while to get through the pint but it was really enjoyable. I have been a little disappointed with southern tier stuff lately but I think it has more to do with my high expectations from them. This is a great and singular beer worth seeking out."
"Was able to give this a try tonight while visiting Mahars. Brew poured to a nice black color with some reddish highlights. Thick medium tan colored head that had great retention and left a ton of lacing. The aroma, well I really cant get past the hops, nice mix of citrus and pine aromas that clearly dominate but are so inviting. Maybe some coffee aroma there but I am having a difficult time getting past the hops as mentioned above. The flavor, real nice! Again the hops are at the front with the coffee making a clearer appearance here than was in the nose. Never really sense an alcohol feel to this one. Overall I think this is a fantastic brew, like the darker malt profile though it was hard to pick up the properties past the hops. I will get this again!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is medium. The carbonation is moderate and works well with the beer. The flavors are well balanced and layered. A very nice beer drinking experience."
"Another new beer from Southern Tier, a dark DIPA. It would not surprise me if this becomes a popular style soon. Fast pour reveals a solid looking black beer, with about a finger of slightly tanned white heading. Despite its blackness, there seems to be a clarity about it in color if that makes any sense. Pretty decent smell. I get from it some mild chocolate, little metallic twang, and some alcohol bitterness. Taste is more centered in hop flavor, but for an Imperial IPA (Sorry, IBA) there is a very good level of balance. The dark malt manages to stay behind the hops, but still smooth things out. Alcohol is hardly present in this one. Had somebody told me it was 9% I might not have believed them. Like I said, the well hidden alcohol and balance between malt and hops both combine to make this an easy drinking ale. This is a very respectable effort from Southern Tier. I liked the fact that it was balanced as opposed to hop overkill. Please continue to experiment."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with a clear printed label (I'm glad Southern Tier moved away from printing ink directly on the glass, it didn't work too well). The beer is dark brown with red highlights along the border, some wet off-white foam that laces all over the glass. The beer smells like a strongly hopped schwarz bier, citrus + pine over a roasted malt body. The taste is really good, much better than Stone 11th in my opinion, more than just a dark IPA, this was tasty in a complex way that included roasted malts and chocolate to offset the citrus character of the hops. Very nice, this is the kind of beer that keeps me coming back to Southern Tier."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. I can smell a lot of citrusy and piney hops. There's also some sweet malt and a bit of dark fruit noticable. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the citrus and pine hop flavors being strongest. I can also taste some bready and roasted malt, and a bit of coffee and dark chocolate, too. The malty flavors get stronger as the beer warms, but there's still a lingering hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol isn't very noticable at all. This is a very unique brew, and I liked it a lot. To me I think this brew is a great mix between a Schwarzbier, a stout and an Imperial IPA, but that's just my opinion. It really is a hard to describe beer, you just have to try it for yourself. It's one of the best beers I've had lately."
"Wow. This is an excellent beer. I'm not sure if it's the coffee or the 1% to 2% drop off in alcohol, but for a change I don't feel worn out from the obvious alcohol. It's slightly noticeable after half a glass, but for the most part this beer is surprisingly drinkable, given the abv. Impressive."
"Iniquity is quite the interesting beer. It's good. Perhaps very good. But, I can't help but think about what could have been. The spicy hop flavor really cuts into and overtakes a more appealing citrus flavor. It's interesting. The citrus hops just begin to take hold...and then they're gone. Iniquity is injustice or an immoral act. Perhaps suppressing that really nice citrus hop flavor is Southern Tier's poetic (in)justice. All kidding aside, Iniquity is a nice beer. It really is very good. But, it's not quite as good as it could've been. Just sayin'."
"Pours an expected black color with a small tan/off white head. More malts in the nose than i thought there would be, a sweetness met with a moderate hop aroma. Malt dominant initially, fruity and semi sweet, notes of raison and plum, shallow hops, no where near as bright as i had hoped for. I was and still am pretty amped for this one but so far it has let me down. I will definitely revisit in hopes of a better outcome."
"D- different than anything i have ever encountered and a challenge to review. its a DIPA that doesnt know if it wants to be a stout or not. very unique, and something that i loved drinking and will check out again in the near future. another one tonight would be a problem because of the strength."
"Not extremely drinkable..."
"Not bad on drinkability. Almost finished with the bottle. It went down quite easily."
"D - Reminds me of a schwarzier hopped to DIPA levels. Very tasty. Like Unearthly with some black malt tossed in."
"Wow this is tasty. The malts come through much more than many other black IPA's I've had. Thick malts with hints of roasted quality and a chocolatey sense. Burnt caramel as well through the beginning and middle. Late into the middle and through the long finish the hops devour the palate and bring things together with the malts showing a bit of sweetness on the very end. A roller coaster type ride on the palate. Hops are more piney in the mouth with some spicy qualities as well. Only a bit a citrus is distinguishable in the very mid palate. A very complex beer."
"A beer well-worth drinking! I got to taste it the day before it was being bottled."
"M&D - rather drinkable and not at all too big, even with a serious palate and highish ABV, well done southern tier, i recommend this beer, try it out"
