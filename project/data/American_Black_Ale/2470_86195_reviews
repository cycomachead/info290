"Some roasted malt and slight coffee.  Earthy, pine, dirt notes come through with the bitterness at a nice level."

"Pours a solid brown with more than a hint of reddish cola around the edges, and a voluminous tan head builds up quickly, leaving an intricate web of sticky lacing. I'm a bit of a sucker for ""cascadian ales," or black IPAs, or whatever you want to call them; I find the combination of smoky roasted notes with an often citric hop bite to be wonderful. Brew Kettle nails both aspects here. Ample Citra hopping delivers a winning burst of tropical fruit and citrus, before giving way to an almost mocha-like smokiness. This is delicious. A muted nose is the only subpar part of the beer. The body and feel are on point too, creamy and just aggressive enough. Tasty, dry finish. Love this."

"Solid black IPA. Hoppy and roasty"

"Best black IPA I've ever had"
"Over all a solid black ipa  good and hoppy with a light roasty finish."

"The aftertaste is grassy and just a bit bitter. Great. Highly recommended."
"Overall, I think the Brew Kettle executes this style well. They definitely get a melding of both the hop characteristics and the roasted malt to be evident in the profile. Probably the best Iâ€™ve had of this style, although I must admit, I still find this style a little perplexing. The mix of hops and roast is still not my thing. Having said this, this one is pretty good. Fans of this style take this review with a grain of salt."

"One of the better BIPAs out there"

"O - A very nice BIPA that is similar to a local favorite of mine, Silk Scorpion."
"O: This nose goes on for days but the taste backs it off a tad I would say for a black IPA this is pretty good but it's not a style I see anyone in. I'd rather ave the sweet clinging finish then the bitter harshness and roast from the end of this."
"I'm not sure if this beer uses the same hop blend as White Rajah, but I certainly enjoyed it just as much. Easily the most IPA-like Black Ale I've had. It lacks the complexity that Stone's SSRA has, but it is highly enjoyable. Kind of strikes me as a non-imperial version of Blakkr with less roastiness."

"Exceptional Black IPA. Smooth and well balanced."

"Not a huge fan of Black Ales or Black IPAs, but this one sets the bar high. Brew Kettle makes it look easy by using their fantastic IPA as the base then crafting this tasty brew.  Congrats!"
"This beer is black with a nice light tan head and beautiful lacing. It looks like a great stout but its full of delicious cutrusy hops. As soon as you take a wiff there is no doubt it's an ipa. The taste is predominantly grapefruit with a little orange backing it up and the bitterness is mild to moderate. It's probably the best dark ipa I've had. I certainly can't remember any that were better."

"not one of the better cascadian blacks Ive had. look was perfect smell was a little lacking in the hop but the malts were a nice yeasty bitterness."
""
"Overall, the black rajah is just as impressive as the White Rajah, which I truly love as well.  The Brew Kettle kicks out some damn tasty beers.  This is a very good beer."
""
""
"This is as good a Black IPA as I've had. It's smoother and more accessible than most. I could quibble with the hop flavor (I'd like it juicier) or the roast quality (almost too subdued), but those are minor deviations from my own preferences rather than flaws."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate roasted malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon/orange zest, pine, chocolate, cocoa, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate roasted malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"3.75/5: Yummy black IPA that doesn't seem very 'black'"
"Side by side comparison with white rajah. Aroma is skunky and citrusy with tropical notes even in the bottle. Resin, grapefruit, mango, mango, and pineapple are contrasted by roasty chocolatey malt. The hop aroma profile is damn near dead-on between the two. Flavor reveals similar citrus notes, along with biting resin and an underlying malt sweetness, with a slightly more bitter finish, due to lingering roast malt. I like the perception of sweetness the chocolate notes in the malt provide, but the char pushes the bitterness too far out for me. Think I'll stick with the original, but still a great beer."
"Overall impressions for me are that I'm really getting into this beer for sure, I'm glad I picked up a six...White Rajah is the most drinkable go to IPA I have access...I'm hoping they bottle this one year round as well.  Those guys know their hops up there in Strongsville, OH!"
""
"O- Great black IPA, very hop-forward with a strong roasty back-end. Very well-done."
""

"Aroma is sharp hops and a tad bit of roasted malt.  The flavor is almost all citrusy hops.  I would not have known this was a black IPA if I hadn't seen the color.  Unlike offerings from, say, 21st Amendment (Back in Black IPA), there is no caramel malt sweetness to counterpoint the hops.  The dark roasted malt is additional bitterness rather than a contrast.  That said, the flavor is clean, and this is pretty drinkable if you're looking for a fairly assertive IPA.  I would have rated this higher as an amber IPA, which is basically what it tastes like."
"O - This is a black IPA that hits hard on the IPA elements, hops and more hops.  The roasted malts that give it the look and color only raises the slightest hit of molasses and bread.  Great flavors, and a solid beer overall."

" O - This beer is clean, well made and tasty.  It differs from an IPA in the color (obviously) and the darker tasting malt flavors in the finish.  I haven't found too many Black IPAs that I enjoyed, but this one is interesting and worth seeking out."

"Great color on this one. Nice tan head. Pretty good amount of lacing. Nose is that sticky sweet hoppy thing. Flavor carries a bit of the same with that oddly woody fruity character that so many black ales possess. This is a very good example of the style and quite nice to drink. I dig it. And I highly suggest it."

"O - This is a well crafted black IPA. I enjoy the balance. It is not overly hoppy as many Cascadian dark ales are. I enjoy this beer immensely."

"12 ounce bottle, no bottle date.  Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours very dark brown with a couple inch frothy light tan head.  The head stayed around a long time, and there's also a lot of lacing.  The brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit), pine hops, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt.  Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some grassiness and coffee noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and coating with a good amount of carbonation.  I thought this was a good brew, definitely worth a try if you come across some.  $11.99 a 6-pack."

"Very nice and refreshing Black IPA. Has a solid taste, yet doesn't overpower.  if anything it might lack body in some regards. I also have been crushing huge stouts this week. So maybe it just appears light. the tropical fruit shines through. I suppose it has more IPA than 'Black' to me. Still a very well rounded easy drinking beer~"

"O- The hop character on this beer is huge and very reminiscent of White Rajah.  The dark malt bill doesn't add a lot of other character to differentiate it from White Rajah, but this is still another great hoppy beer from the Brew Kettle."
""
"This is a fantastic Black IPA with a really nice balance.  Definitely has more citrus and hoppiness than your normal Black IPA."

"Served on tap (and enjoyed in a growler) from Spinoza's in Beavercreek, Ohio. This poured a very dark brown with a two inch head that left splotchy lacing. The smell is malty and hoppy, with roasted malt and toffee but there's not much that stands out (while White Rajah has an amazing smell that rivals the best IPAs). The taste consists of a 40/40 balance between chocolate and pine from the hops with caramel and coffee rounding things out. As for the mouthfeel, this is fairly smooth and minimally carbonated with bitterness that seems to come more from the coffee than the hops and that is moderately thick. Overall, I'm not a big fan of black IPAs, and so I expected to enjoy this less than White Rajah. Still, I think there's some room for improvement here. This is more difficult to find than the White, probably because (I believe) this is only available on tap and tends to go quick."

"This is an awesome Black IPA. It's been awhile since I've had it, and I was very happy to revisit it. It does a great job of doing White Rajah justice. I wouldn't mind seeing this in bottles. Great stuff. Recomended if given the opportunity."

"O- Being that White Rajah is one of my favorite and go to IPA's I found this one to be a little disappointing. I was really excited to try this one too."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights, khaki head with excellent lacing. Nose is big tropical fruit hops and a trace amount of chocolate malt. Flavor is a burst of tropical hops, slight caramel malt, and a complimentary - not overtaking - amount of roasted malts. Best black IPA I've had this far, well done."

"Very enjoyable Black IPA. Definitely worth a try."
"It was a treat to finally try this beer. Not very aromatic but the taste was excellent. One of the few smoky beers I have enjoyed recently. Smoke in the front, some malt and hops to end. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but glad I got to try it. Another solid beer from a great brewery."
