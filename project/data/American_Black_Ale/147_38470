Amazing aroma of citrus hops greets the nose.  There's undercurrent of dark malt.  The taste is of bitter piney hops on the front of the palate.  The back of the palate is dark malt.  It finishes with a bitter flourish of more piney hops.  The mouth is initially creamy and then very dry and lightly sticky.  There's a lot going on here.  Why is this being discontinued again?","Franziskaner","Saturday at 01:59 PM"

4.03,-4.5,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured a rich black body with reddish brown highlights around the edges and one finger of tan head. A gorgeous looking black IPA, quite nice. Scents of pine resin, grassy hops, medium-high levels of roasted malt, light smokiness, light citrus and licorice aromas and light fruity esters and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice black IPA, rich and true to form, with a pleasant balance that leans towards hops, but lets enough roasted malt through. Quite nice. Flavor begins nicely bitter, with notes of roasted malt, smoked malt, pine resin, grassy hops, tangerine flesh and citrus peel. This moves into a bitter middle with notes of pine resin, citrus peel and a nice undercurrent of roasted and caramel malt. Finish is highly bitter with notes of pine resin, roasted malt, grapefruit peel and some sweet citrus flesh with a mild note of grassy hops and light alcohol. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, pine resin and grassy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice, very bold black IPA. It is very hop forward and bold but still quite nice, and with enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying, sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice black IPA, like many I have had. Overall this is a pretty good black IPA. It has a good aroma and flavor and a nice mouthfeel that aids the flavor profile. Not as good as the gold standard, Wookey Jack, but still quite nice and a shame it's being discontinued.","Auraan","Feb 07, 2015"

Hmm smells like a porter /stout, but what's that end note!?!  I'm gonna go for a sip...... WOW!!  this is delicious!!  Starts off like a porter stout ends like an iPa. I can't explain it. I've actually looked at the low reviews on this one AND THEY EXIST! I know everyone's taste differs but I feel like this is one of the greatest beers ever. If I had enough to spend $12 on a couple 4 packs a week I would, but rather keep it special and get every so often. Hands down best 12oz bottled beer so far in my journey though craft beer. If you like IPAS and don't mind porters /stouts try this. Just make sure you get it fresh and check the dates! Although it is understandable living on opposite coast these days.. Thank you Stone! Please don't stop brewing this. Ever. Cheers, Kevin.","Ipaupaweallpa","Dec 25, 2014"

4.75,12.6,,,,,,"First BA review in a few years! Dark ruby when held to the light with big sheets of thick lacing. Great aromas from this one, malty and dark roasted notes, slightly sweet and subtle vanilla. Soft on the pallet with a nice hop texture, finishing with a lasting dryness till the next sip. Very balanced BIPA, lending itself to the the hoppy side of the range. The strong ABV is controlled and not overpowering, but shows on the finish. I really like this offering from Stone and see it as one to judge others.","orangemoustache","Aug 22, 2014"

The smell is full of hops but not much else it would seem. The taste though was very different. Starting out with a lot of floral notes in the beginning gave way to a semi sweet malt finish that I found very refreshing. Would highly recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 12, 2014"

Strong hops with no subtlety, roasted malts and burnt coffee. I would still say give it a try; I know that Stone is a popular brewery and you just might like this offering more than I.","microbrewlover","Jul 03, 2014"

The aroma on this beer is huge but it is slightly more bitter than I would like but that's nitpicking. For awhile I thought this beer was just a German style black ale but boy was I wrong. Also they could amp up the roast presence ever so slightly and it would probably be the best black IPA out there. But I really dig the hop profile on this one, it might be coincidence that I find NightTime to have a very similar hop profile, or maybe not.","PaulyB83","Jul 01, 2014"

This is the kind of complex beer you can tell they made repeat batches with its recipe for a damned good reason. Overall, this beer just tastes fantastic, is pretty easy to drink, and not SO bitter where a regular beer drinker who is into craft brews wont find it a chore to finish the pint. A TON of hops at the beginning, but it doesnt leave you with an overly sticky/bitter feeling in your mouth. There is a great and complex flavor to the beer and makes you want to come back for more.","sanzenapocalypz","May 19, 2014"

It is smooth and rich, with a good thick head that lingers just long enough for an ale. I had it from a bottle, served just under room temperature (about 55 or 60 degrees). The smell and taste are that of most IPAs that I've tried, very piney and bitter, which are not up my alley, but this beer has a good mouthfeel. Not too much carbonation, and it actually goes down fairly smooth. The strong hops flavor is just not my thing. This may be a fantastic beer to a true IPA fan, but it's just not my mug of ale.","JDJ","Feb 22, 2014"

With that said, this is a very good take on the style, and with Stone's signature hop profile, this is something I'd seek out again.","Tsar_Riga","Feb 02, 2014"

This black ipa pours and tastes much more like a porter than any ipa I've ever had. It is near perfect opaque black in color but thin and smooth in body. Starts with a small tan head that dissipates to a slight tan lacing that holds well to the glass throughout the session. The aroma is actually very subtle with a lot of roasted malt scents upfront and a little hop and sweetness behind it. The flavor is nothing like I expected following the nose. It is rich and deep with notes of chocolate, coffee, and maybe even a little pepper. Great balance of the sweetness of the malt with the bitterness of the hops. I still feel this one falls closer to porter than black ipa but what ever it is; I think I'll have another one.","lochef81","Jan 18, 2014"

I love the warming, bubbly effect. What IPA's do that? Only a Cascadian Dark Ale/Black IPA can pull this off. Sublimely Self-Righteous matches all of the best IPA's and yet cranks up the hops highly and is packed with mysterious head scratching flavors. So known yet unknown.

Really does an excellent job of creating a balanced, meaty, refreshing beer that has the best of both worlds that are quintessential to a black IPA. Also does an exceptional job of concealing the almost-9% ABV.","LambicPentameter","Nov 30, 2013"

Some charcoal, cocoa powder, mango and roast notes hit the nose as well. 8 Ball black appearance with some decent lacing and thin foam. Really strong bitter hops greet the palate. Shortly after, the stout quality comes through delivering strong roast, dry coffee bean oil, subtle toffee and smokey notes to the palate. Finish is immensely dry with a continuous bitterness, herbs and strong alcohol. As it warms up, the juicy, fruity qualities really shine through with grapefruit juice, mango, tropical fruits and pineapple. Really a fantastic take on the style.","IAmAPenguin","Nov 14, 2013"

It looked really nice. finger and a half head. some lacing. Smelled kind of foul. It had the typical hops aroma, but it smelled burnt. Literally like a burnt piece of pine wood. It tasted like it smelled, literally. I dumped the second half out. Perhaps I had a bad bottle, that's why I didn't mark it any lower than I did. Scared to try again though.

This is one great beer that brings together dark malt with a bit of bitter of it's own from the burnt and charred qualities and it's signature hop bitter. This was fruity and tremendously sweet. That sweetness deepens on the nose and in the drink as it warms but it never surpasses the tart fruits or the piney resin. The brown sugar goes so well with the orange. I'm in love.

Lots of smoke for a non smoked beer. Plenty of bite from the hops, with a nice clean bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel with more than adequate carbonation. Solid beer, but I’m not sure it belongs with the likes of Wookey Jack.","BMMillsy","Aug 02, 2013"

3.76,-10.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but the hop profile didn't impress me as much as other Black IPA's and the bitterness was just a little too aggressive in this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, and the alcohol was a little too warming for it's strength, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, I think the bitterness would really start to wear on me if I had more then one. What I like the most about the beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very good with appearance being the best, it may be the best looking Black IPA I have ever seen. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor, it wasn't bad, I just wish the hop profile highlighted those citrus hops that I got in the aroma more and I thought the bitterness was just too intense for this beer, it would really help the drinkability if it was toned down. I wouldn't buy this again, it's no a bad beer, but there's many more Black IPA's that I like more than this one so I don't think I will be revisiting it anytime soon and I think it's a little overpriced but I would recommend that any fan of the style at least give it a try. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, Stone is very good with hoppy beers, but this one fell a little short in my eyes and it didn't have a hop profile that kept me coming back for me, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jul 31, 2013"

Aroma of citrus, orange peel, pine hops upfront with some good dark caramel chocolate malt. Taste is of dark chocolate malt, a bit of liquorices with a good amount of citrus hops. A medium to full oily body on the palate, slightly smooth with a sweet bitter sticky mouth feel. The finish is a combination of sweet dark caramel malt, chocolate some brown sugar, the ending is sweet bitter liquorices and citrus orange bitterness for balance. Caramel malt flavor shows through more as it warms up. Although a bit on the bitter side, it is an interesting combination of flavors, but still a very good and tasty brew, well done.","Samp01","Jul 11, 2013"

I also had this on tap recently, and found it to be very drinkable. The ABV is very deceptive. Definitely a good gateway beer for those who loves stouts but are having trouble with IPA's.","crazyfoMostout","Jun 16, 2013"

I see here BA has it as an American Black, which is fine. These hybrid beers are wicked good! Hats off to the brewers. Try this beer out ASAP, Condor recommended.","TheCondor","Mar 03, 2013"

Don't see a date. But knowing Stone I imagine it would have been a good bit hoppier when fresh, and that may explain the depression, which I won't quite call a hole.","BrownNut","Jan 30, 2013"

The aroma is a blend of citrus and sharp hops, a bit metallic; reminds me of the smell of a jar full of old pennies just opened. I loved that smell as a kid. Strong hops bitterness hits up front, citrus again with a little hint of alcohol followed by some mild maltiness. Just the right level of carbonation, the hops drys the mouth and leaves touch of bitterness in the back of the tongue. A delicious, unique and satisfying ale all around.","Steamer","Jan 24, 2013"

The front is dominated by the aforementioned pine hops that bite the tip of the tongue, but the middle of the sip reveals a very creamy, slightly waxy mouthfeel that brings out a really balanced malt profile which eventually coalesces back with the hop profile near the end until a wonderful finish of dark chocolate gets the last word. Medium carbonation provides a nice bite and meshes perfectly with the slightly roasted, chocolatey finish. An absolutely stellar example of balance and linear taste progression from these arrogant bastards.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

As the glass warms, resinous hopping aroma joins in as well. The flavor is slightly more roasted-focused than the nose is, but that is not to say that the hopping is not well represented. There is plenty of piney goodness to go around. It overall keeps very dry and ABV is about 75% hidden. (There is a rising warmth in the background, but mostly the orange peel hopping is made fruitier and richer by the ABV presence, which is a good thing in my book.) This is one of the best Black IIPAs out there on the market IMHO.","WastingFreetime","Oct 09, 2012"

I remember first trying this black IPA several years ago and being absolutely blown away, because not only did it possess the bright, hop forward and citrus-y flavor profile of an imperial IPA, but it also had the appearance and chocolate-y and slightly roasty malt characteristics of a great and smooth porter. Nowadays, it seems like more and more Black IPAs forget to include the chocolate roastiness of Porters in their taste. Sublimely Self-Righteous certainly doesn't succumb to this pitfall and definitely earns it's namesake year after year.","flayedandskinned","Sep 15, 2012"

Deep roasted malt comes through a touch in the beginning of the sip but huge resinous hop presence comes through almost instantly. Despite the massive amount of hops and big bitterness pretty good balance, a bit of detectable alcohol. Touch of malt but this beer is a big hop show case. If you love double IPA's you'll love it because big pretty good tasting and pretty standard. However for such a dark beer the malt really doesnt play as much of a role as you expect it. Good but I was expecting much more, especially at the price.","jtierney89","Sep 13, 2012"

This beats is trapped by a thick billowy cloud of bubbles, tan in color and very tempting, like the sirens of old as described to me by Homer…and they bring friends, many friends to lure you into their depth (good lacing). If you’ve been to hell and back, then you certainly recognize the odor of sulfur (hops, hops and more hops all mixed in with some dark fruit and citrus aromas here and there). If you’ve ever eaten Eskimo P***y then this beast will fair no different, among the best tastes in the world. Simply delightful for a hophead; relatively light bodied for this brewer, but the hops are present and do not disappoint. The roasted barley is fresh and its bite is mild and only gives you a hint of the alcohol it contains. The citrus flavors you feel when it first hits you are quickly transformed into a lasting and lingering burnt hops aftertaste. This is a very good ale!","vickersspitfire","Aug 21, 2012"

Some raw grain, some citrus hop notes. Nice, evenly balanced mouthfeel between the fullness and the carbonation. Flavors are comprised of spooned mashing grain, lemon, pine, and grass. Some dark roasted barley. Finishes with some faint pine and unfermented sugar. Big beer, but not because of any one big flavor. This is my favorite Stone brew.

There is a tower or beige head that leaves sticky lacings all over the glass. The nose is full of roasted coffee and chocolate malt with a dominating citrus and pine hop character. Very good nose. The taste is very hop dominant. There is lots of citrus hops, grapefruit and orange peel with some resin. A nice balance comes from the roasted malts which even out the palate very well.

5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours black with a tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The beer is opaque, but bubbles can be seen collecting on the underside of the head. The hop aroma of this beer is strong, but I can also pick up dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and some mild sweetness in the smell. The taste follows the nose. The citrus hop flavor is intense, but I can also pick up the malty flavors as well as bitter chocolate and anise. The alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor. The body of the beer is medium to full with plentiful carbonation. The drinkability is very high for such a big beer. Overall, this is a most excellent beer that everyone should try once.","acevenom","May 25, 2012"

Too much bitter pine character overruns the entire experience. I don't know if the bottle I had initially was old and the hops had mellowed to the point that other flavors were able to shine through, or if there's been a change in the brewing process, but it's been a pure pine bomb the last few times I've had it. My score now reflects my latest assessment, which is far less favorable.","TheSixthRing","May 05, 2012"

It has the potential of a regular IPA, yet also has a really awesome roasty flavor that compliments the hop bitterness. I've had one other black IPA from another company so far, but I feel like the roasted flavor of that beer dominated the hops. With this one though, as mentioned above, it's a perfect 50/50. Stone definitely knows what they are doing, and this one is worth a try. I will have more of these in the future for sure.","HaynesJB","Apr 27, 2012"

Pours almost pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, biscuit, chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, floral, and herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, toasted biscuit, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, herbal hop, and coffee. Nice sized smooth spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, toasted biscuit, chocolate, caramel, citrus, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of hop bitterness to roasted malt flavor for a black IPA. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a delicious Black IPA as expected. Big hop flavors with a great balanced malt backbone that I usually prefer in black IPAs.","superspak","Apr 14, 2012"

That’s really the main thing I like about this beer – that it’s unique (as are most of Stone’s offerings) – but as far as dark, hoppy beers go, I think a stout might be a bit more satisfying for my tastes. Of course, that’s not to say that this beer doesn’t have its place. If you really want to see where this one stands out, grab something salty, garlicy, or just plain spicy and crack a bottle – the darkness will soothe your burn, and the hops will rile it up at just the right times.","BarryMFBurton","Apr 14, 2012"

That said, it can't be faulted at all; it offers more drinkability than the 15th, and somewhat less of a medicinal aspect. What can I say, I love both. Stone has defined Black IPA, in all its contradiction as a term, they bring the intense hop and roasted malt together perfectly in both cases. I had the 15th when it was just a week or so old, and I have never experienced such a fresh hop blast. Again, this is similar, but less hi-test and in your face. But not much, at all. I'm glad this is becoming a regular offering. Herbal hops with a touch of a medicinal aspect, which is rare and appreciated. Kick ass brew from a kick ass brewer. Get it if you can handle it.","MarkBlackout","Dec 08, 2011"

Tons of hops in the nose, with a dryness to them moreso than in a big paler IPA. Loads of hop bitterness on the tongue with some smoky after-tones. Cheers to Stone for making a very interesting beer in a style that doesn't come in six packs. Why aren't black IPAs more popular? At least most of the brewers who decide to make one know what they're doing. Mouthfeel is excellent and I recommend trying this beer.","chicagoabbot","Nov 30, 2011"

The nose comprises lime, pine, blackened pretzel, light roasted malts, light char, orange zest, and very light coffee. The taste holds notes of pine, roasted malts, light char, light vinyl, lime peel, mint, and balsa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very solid CDA, though I think the roasted elements were left in the oven just a bit too long (or something like that, anyway). Otherwise, good stuff.","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2011"

No surprises, but maybe that's what disappoints some, but I like the roast and spice in perfect balance. Bit more roast in the taste than the nose. My wife is not a hop head at all, but likes this beer because the hops blends and compliments so well into the sweet malt roast. Incredible beer that is one of Stone's best.","FightingEntropy","Nov 05, 2011"

Smell is sublime. Sweet tangy grapefruit with a touch of caramel malt and toffee. The main reason I usually don't like the style is because the chocolate malts overpower the rest but seems more into the IPA zone. The citrusy notes come through as more of an orange/lemon zest and this beast is bitter as hell! Very clean and easy drinking. I think I finally found one in this style I finally like. Carbonation is spot on as well as the downplayed alcohol although there is a touch of heat. Being only a month old probably helps too.","generalnotsew","Nov 04, 2011"

What a surprise—a hoppy, dark beer… Funny thing is, I knew what I was getting into (a Cascadian IPA) because I’ve had this beer before—when it was called Stone 11—but the hop aroma still took me off guard. The beer itself pours a lot like a foamy cola. It’s dark dark dark brown, with a good half-inch of loose, bubbly foam lingering atop after a few minutes and a vigorous pour. Think pine more than citrus, with just a hint of dark roasted malt on the nose. Some grapefruit. Smells wonderful. Tastes fantastic, surprisingly full-bodied but not heavy (and distinct enough for me to not raise my ever-present questions about the black IPA style’s similarities to a hoppy porter). Bit of a resiny chew to this, enough to let the flavors linger but not to the point where I find it disagreeable. Hops mix with a little roast in a wonderfully delicious combination.","elNopalero","Oct 22, 2011"

The hop bitterness and roasted malt interaction is cool. I don’t find the beer as bitter as the IBUs testify. I wonder if this beer is best fresh. I wonder if aging this in oak barrels would be beneficial in bringing out some flavor. I definitely find it too heavy on the alcohol in scent and taste.","BJA","Sep 13, 2011"

3.85,-8.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D/O: Certain beers, due either to timing or to mastery, have taken on the role of archetypal example of their style: certainly Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the archetypal American-brewed pale ale, and within its distribution range Alaskan Amber will always be the defining American-brewed alt. Sublimely Self-Righteous (SSR) ale by Stone defined the archetype of the black DIPA--which is, I think, an important distinction to make from the black IPA. While the style has been popping up here and there and everywhere with ever-increasing frequency, this beer was very accessible within Stone's distribution range before most breweries had even discovered black IPAs or DIPAs. More hop-focused than some, it is interesting in the way that its hop profile puts it closer to Double Bastard than to the Russian imperial stout. It is worth returning to occasionally, even if it isn't your favorite black DIPA--after all, it set the mark to which all others are measured against.","beagle75","Aug 05, 2011"

The smell is a hop explosion like an IPA with a tad of sweetness some roastyness and a mild smoke character. Taste is absolutly what a black IPA should be and the best I've had in the style. I can taste candied hops perfect roasted malt flavors and the best part is the coffee taste is minimal.

For this style it is easy to produce a watery beer with little substance, but they seemed to retain a good deal of body, after which the hops were added as a secondary feature. This made for a nice balance, which allowed for no component to really obtrude the other.","TheBrewo","Jul 23, 2011"

The hops are the strongest smell with the roasted malts and some alcohol smells. This has a medium thickness. The taste is mostly of bitter hops, to a lesser extent there are some roasted malts and a molasses taste, but they are overpowered by the hops. Overall an excellent beer and one I'll continue to buy again, but from the few American Black Ales I've tried, I actually prefer Hop in the Dark to this one, I think its better balanced between being very hoppy and having flavorful roasted malts, still this is a great beer.","DavidST","Jul 05, 2011"

The initial smell is of hops and roasted malts, but as it warms a more piney hop character and some tropical fruit are evident. A touch of alcohol present on the nose as well. The taste is hopy, with just a touch of roasted malt and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall one of my favorite black ales.

4.29,1.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation, drinks fairly well, likely due to its appearance tricking me into expecting a big heavy RIS.

Dark malts and dark fruits in the aroma, but a definite citrus hop presence like you'd get from your typical IPA.

The flavor is pretty close to the smell with the hops coming out first followed by the roasted burnt malt flavor. The beer is very dry with no residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is light bodied wig good carbonation and a bitterness feel on the side of you tongue. Overall it's a good beer worth trying at least once","rowingbrewer","Jun 28, 2011"
4.21,-0.2,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured a 3"" off-white head which was slow to recede. Dark walnut brown in color, and clear I think though it's so dark it's hard to tell. Smell is strong on hops and citrus and I'd agree grapefruit seems dominant. Taste matches the smell but includes quite a bitter finish. As is often the case with Stone this is a big bold beer with no shyness on hops. They're all great, but I do think most are just slight deviations from each other or from a central big beer concept by Stone.","MoreThanWine","Jun 26, 2011"

Aromas of bitter hops,pine and citrus fruits,particularly grapefruit greet the nose. First sip reveals a surprising roasted malt character that is nicely balanced by bitter hops. Also hints of bitter coffee,chocolate and more citrus. This beer has a very usual flavor profile but the flavors work together amazingly well. Mouthfeel and carbonation are medium and there is a definite creamy quality to this beer. The finish is long and quite bitter and any hint of alcohol taste has been completely masked.

Small head but some even lacing. Smell is bitter but not of hops, initially. Slightly burnt grainy malts and molasses lead into some earthy hops, grass, spruce and citrus peel. Taste is so weird, in a good way. Jumps back and forth from malts to hops to malts to hops and back. After is sits a bit, the finish is a nice roasted coffee bean flavor. A bigger beer at 8.7%, but this is pretty thin and very easy to consume. Alcohol is hidden behind all the changing pieces as it doesn't know what to be. One drink a malt beer, next is IPA. Excellent beer from Stone, should we be surprised.","spree92","May 17, 2011"

4.89,15.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"To say that I’ve been looking forward to this beer is an understatement. One of my buddies happened to pick this up in Denver last year but he of course didn’t share. 22 ounce bomber poured into an oversized wine goblet. Comes out of the bottle dark brown (think cola) with a frothy long lasting tan head. Wish the head was a bit thicker, but the high ABV probably makes that difficult. Aroma comes across as this dank and earthy hop character, with big notes of pine. It’s huge! Roasted grain and chocolate are buried in the nose. You have to work your way past the incredible hop aroma but they’re in there. Then there’s the whole matter of taste. Hops shatter the palate first, with a prolonged bitterness in the finish. The first taste is all hops. As you acclimate you’ll be able to start to pick at the malt profile a bit more, but the first taste is jarring. I like the mouthfeel as well. It’s slick and despite all the hops never gets sticky. This beer finishes very dry (something I’ve noticed with most Stone beers), as the malt character never goes overboard into sweet territory. Instead it opts for roasted and nutty, with a slight bitter coffee note. That’s not the best description. Let me put it this way I’ve toasted pine nuts, getting them to the point where they’re almost too dark, and that’s what this malt flavor reminds me of. It’s not burnt, but is right there on the edge. There’s also some definite alcohol warmth but I’m not picking up any fusels in the nose or taste, very impressive. It’s not often that I find a beer that lives up to my expectations when trying it, but Sublimely Self-Righteous does that and then some. Not sure if it’s possible, but this is a textbook example of an emerging style.","eclaycamp","May 13, 2011"

Taste is of piney and floral hops. Maybe some chocolate and coffee flavors but they are certainly in the background. The hops are the main focus here.

Crazy fresh hop flavor with a fair amount of bitterness. Medium bodied with a dryish finish that brings the roast back into play.

On one hand this is a very hoppy black ale and has a good blend of hops to go with a sweet, malty flavor profile. But while I like it, I'm not as in love with it as most. It seemed a little too strong on the back end. this is still a very good option form Stone.","socon67","Apr 08, 2011"

The body is black with hints of dark brown here and there, especially when held up to the light. The head is still there, but not as much as I would like it to be. Overall this looks pretty good. The smell on this is really surprising to me, it doesn't really smell like a black ale, it smells like a black IPA or maybe ever a regular IPA, the hops are just phenomenal for it being a black beer. I really don't detect too much malt either, maybe a little bit, but not much. It's mostly just the hops on the smell, I do get a small indication of the high alcohol on the smell. Overall it smells pretty good, not too complicated, but it smells good and powerful! Taste is really good, huge hops in the front end, and a little malt in the finish, not too much alcohol noticeable in this one, which is nice. The mouthfeel is a little light, which is ok for the style, but I do like my beer thicker. It's a very well done beer, which is expected from Stone, but just like the smoked porter, it's not that complicated or unique. If you wanted to look up in the dictionary what a good beer should be, you should (I don't know if you would, but you should) find this beer listed. On the other hand if you looked for creative beers in the dictionary this would be no where to be found. Maybe my opinion is a little biased because I recently had their scotch ale and it was super complex, who knows. We will see if there are any other flavors that come out as the beer warms, but for now, I will leave it as this: great beer, not complex.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 07, 2011"

At 45 minutes in, finishing the last third of the 22oz bomber, it was simply phenomenal. I changed my score above to a 9 based on this.","keith712","Mar 21, 2011"

This is definitely a beer that balances itself well. Out of all the 'newish' style of black IPA that I have had, this one is definitely the crown jewel.

Nose is complex with sharp hops-citrus and floral; some malt but no discernable alcohol; floral character overall. In the mouth, it's bitterly hoppy up front with a nice burnt toast malty character behind it. Strong hops presence with a bit of sweet malt for balance, finishing on a bitter, acrid note. Very nice flavor profile. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, very smooth, with light carbonation, complementary of the flavor.

The flavor is hoppier than anticipated as well. It has a very sharp and distinct pine/citrus hop profile right out of the gate. It finishes with a load of dark roasted malts, on the verge of tasting burnt. It's good but the charcoal flavor keeps me from scoring it higher. It drinks pretty full in body and the flavors become more bold as you continue to drink it. It's a good beer but like a lot of Stone's darker beers, I don't consider it to be overly drinkable.

Black IPA is a perfect description of this beer. The hops are prominent and persistent throughout the palate. Upfront, the first impression is of a porter, with the chocolate/roasted malt flavor. Then the hops come in and dominate; the dry hopping is especially prominent in this one. The hop flavor in this beer is AMAZING-seriously like having a glass of fresh hops.

Nothing bad to say about this other than the smaller batch of the 11th was better. I still have 4 bottles of the 11th and I drank one the other day.

At first I get much similar flavors to an Imperial IPA, with the caramel, strong malt profile as well as intense hops. The hops seem to be well balanced of citrus and floral notes.

Poured a black ruby brown from the bottle with a nice tan creamy head. There is some brandy on the nose and a heavy roasted taste. Then the finish kick in and, wow! The finish is incredibly complex, with at least 4 stages of subtle change on the tongue.

The beer has a 1 inch creamy, thick, tan head. The nose is hop heavy, with grapefruit and resinous forward notes, followed by a solidly smoked and roasted note that helps to balance it. The taste is hop forward, very bitter and resinous, and these characteristics are enhanced by the roast and smoke characters. The hop-heavy feel continues into the finish, where there is more of a citrus hops linger, but still plenty of bitterness. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, despite the boldness of the flavors.

Nice big light tan head that has great retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. I've never had a black IPA before so I keep thinking more of a stout smell and taste and I keep getting thrown off...in a good way though. The smell was very hoppy way more hoppier than I expected actually. Mainly citrusy. A little bit of malt in the background which gives it a slight roasted smell. The taste is similar, very hoppy with a slight roasted bite in the background. Nice and bitter, ends with a faint coffee/roasted malt finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average and smooth, like a step below creamy. The ABV on this one isn't terribly high so finishing this is no problem. I'd actually take another. My first black IPA and it's pretty great and another great beer from Stone. Will definitely pick this one up again.","dismal","Dec 31, 2010"

Very assertive citrus, less assertive pine, and finally, a light touch of coffee and roasted barley, which I can't quite comprehend with my nose at the moment. The taste, however, seems to put it back in place and is actually quite good. The grapefruit lasts throughout, but fades into pine in the finish, followed by a touch of astringent coffee-like bitterness. How odd. I could call this an India Porter Ale... or an IPA with an identity crisis? Whatever it may be, it fools me nicely and I'm having a blast enjoying this beer.","DmanGTR","Nov 20, 2010"

Immediate scents of dark roasted coffee, smoke, spice (black pepper), dead pine and an odd, sweaty B.O. ""old tennis shoe"" odor which detracts. The flavor is sharp and pungent, musty and rich with smoke and earthy basement flavors. The mouthfeel is very good, rich with a nice spiky carbonation. Drinkability is a bit low due to thick gunk collecting on the back of the tongue and throat. Not a true winner. Stone was over-hyped for introduction to my market (Chicago), and has turned out to be no big deal compared to Founders, Bell's, New Glarus and other reputable midwest brewers.

Very unuasual, unique earthy nose that's half stout, half IPA. Initially it almost reminds me of soy sauce, with just a touch of black licorice. Lots of malty burnt toffee as well as some subdued citrusy hop notes. Really unique taste that's much like the nose. All the best characteristics of a stout perfectly matched and balanced with the best of an IPA. Subtle roasty, chocolate and coffee matched with bitter, hoppy, citrus, and sweet malts to balance it all out. Mouthfeel is also part creamy stout, part bitter hop bomb.

It's nearly porter in color, but a little bit lighter, sort of red. The head was nice and stayed around for a while. The taste was good with a bitter old ale flavor. It reminds me a bit of the german alt style. It is a little fruity with hops but mostly exhibitsa solid malt flavor; caramel, raisin, with a bite of peppery spice. There is very little hops in the scent. It barely has any scent at all, but definitely more malt than hops. The aftertaste is good, and the beer is smooth.

The flavor and nose were full of sweet oaky notes and vanilla, with hints of smoked peat moss, molasses, brown sugar and booze like rum or bourbon. The sweetness ruled the taste, but there was still a lingering smoky bitterness after each sip that left cocoa, toffee and dark chocolate notes. The aging tamed the hops but really brought out the rich malty flavor, which to me was a very welcomed change. This beer still throws a punch as one bomber got me banged up.

Thick, creamy mouthfeel brings on a slew of flavors ranging from syrup, sweet malts, hops, tobacco-esque hop bitterness, slight bitter cocoa, coffee beans. Hop bitterness finishes out the drink and slicks the tongue. Despite the strength of the beer and its flavors, it remains a very drinkable ale that asks to be enjoyed at dusk.

It smells like a malty hop soaked in grapefruit juice and it tastes like a hoppy grapefruit. When I aerate it in my mouth I get bitter, dark fruits. I love it. It's viscous and it finishes sweet and dry. It's a strong, interesting beer but there is nothing offensive about it at all.

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"A almost black body with a quickly dying tan head and minimal lace. Intense hoppy smell but there is a noticeable aroma of roasted and cocoa malt. Like a hoppy coffee stout this beer has a medium body that is smooth and a tad creamy with a mixture (heavier on the former) of roasted coffee and chocolate malt (gives a lil' bit of sweetness) and citric hops. Also a minor note of black cherry and other plush fruit. Easy to drink ale that is meant to relax w/ after dinner.","clayrock81","May 23, 2010"
5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"22oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. These beer pours completely black when in the glass. It comes out a very dark brown when the liquid gets a little thin, but overall it's pretty black and opaque. The beer produces a tan head with some decent lacing to it, the way beer should look. A very good looking brew. The smell is truly exquisite. It's complex, but gets to the point. Overall it's completely dominated by the hops, but the malts make themselves noticeable as well. Roasted malts with a slight smokey smell that is covered by a delicious hop aroma. A little more pine than citrus in my opinion. The taste is truly outstanding, but I wish I had the opportunity to grade it a 4.9 I think that's what I go with in that situation. Like most beers of this style it's very hoppy, the good thing here is it's not to overwhelming. Along with the great hoppy taste is the good malted flavor. It has a great malted taste much like the smell, with a slight smokey taste. Wonderfully balanced overall. Mouthfeel is good, not quite full bodied in my opinion, but pretty close. Has a slight dry bitter finish from the hop, very good. Extremely drinkable beer, could drink this rain or shine on any occasion. A wonderful beer to have on standby, and you should!","AndyAvalanche","May 22, 2010"
4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the Brattleboro, Vermont Brewer's Festival on May 22, 2010. There is a mahogany dark brown pour with some red hues and a two-inch puffy tan head. Hops are the lead ingredient in the aroma but it seems very well-balance and not overdone. Hops also tend to be the first thing caught on the tongue but there is also a rather molasses-like sugar-sweetness in there. Definitely not as bitterly hopped as some strong ales. This one tends to be a lot mellower than other strong ales. Pretty good.","puboflyons","May 22, 2010"
3.72,-11.8,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Taste: Rich and bitter and pretty darn good. Herbal/floral/grassy hops with a nice roundness and sharp bitterness. A healthy helping of ripe pear and grapefruit oil that tickles the throat. Molasses and caramel and some barely perceptible clove with nice dark malt flavors. Mocha/Coffee emerges as it warms. Slightly interesting play between the dark, slightly roasted malts and the bitternes but the bitterness is a just a bit harsh and hurts drinkability and the mouthfeel is pretty oily. Finish is grassy with an astringent edge, grainy, bitter coffee, residual orange oil.","4000qtrap","May 21, 2010"

Normally you would expect a beer this dark to be sweet and heavy. But this one comes across like some crazy hybrid of just about everything Stone does well and the result is awesome. Pours fairly thick, like a porter say, and as dark as a stout but with more carbonation. A nice, thick toasted brown head forms. The scent is almost all hops with notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is a beautiful melange of hops, dark chocolate, coffee, and raisins. Not too sweet and not too bitter. The good amount of hop bitterness gives it a lighter body and cleaner finish than an imperial stout, making it a very drinkable strong ale.","hoppyhampy","May 05, 2010"

The flavor is dominated by dry hops and toasted malt with a slight smack of cherry cough drops on the finish. The mouth is dry most the way through, the slight sweetness at the end, but that diverse of a mouth from tongue to throat. It's quite drinkable, with the alcohol well hidden, but the predominant woodiness would prevent it from being a session beer. Solid overall, but rather mundane compared to the stars in the Stone universe.","Osiris9588","May 04, 2010"

Bit of wintergreen mintiness comes in and is followed by an almost chocolaty malt flavor. Very smooth for a black IPA and has a nice creamy mouthfeel.

Head eventually dissipates into a soapy skim that coalesces around the shoulders. Generous bands and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals lots of malt, brown sugar and molasses off the pour. Out of the glass some light hops aromas come across in the back. Taste follows nose, but the hops bitterness really asserts itself at the back and lingers between quaffs, slightly detracting from the experience. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a level background carbonation and a slightly creamy texture. Not a bad brew and reasonably priced at $6.99, but the lingering bitterness was a little off-putting for me.","Jwale73","Apr 14, 2010"

Hard to believe all this is coming from such a dark brew. The malt is pretty subdued, but does add a mellowness the body and finish. Bitterness expectedly rears up at the end.

It is a cross between an IPA and a stout from what I can tell. It's good, a very strong beer, complex, with a strong finish, sort of coffee-like at the end, leaves a slight after taste. I must admit, at the first sip, I was disappointed, I have learned to expect great things from Stone, but after I started to drink it, it grew on me, and I enjoyed it. Great pour/appearance, consistency. For the price they charge, I am not sure I'd buy this again, don't get me wrong, it's a solid beer, but it is over-priced, I think you could get alot better value for the money.

The hop aroma is spectacular with a very intense and fresh pine note that is much less colored by dark malt than I would have expected based on the style and the color. The flavor is quite a bit darker and more typical of the style, though no less excellent. There is a very nice balance between caramel malts and citrus hops as well as between harsh, acrid bitterness and a subtle, restrained sweetness that appears at just the right moments to encourage your palate to endure the assault and keep the beer drinkable.

At $7 per pint, the price (and yes, I've read the blogs where rich dudes claim you shouldn't ever consider expense in ""drinkable"" considerations) is too steep for us to want more than one pint per day; but the brew itself is so extremely intense, we wouldn't want to indulge in more than a single pint even if we didn't both have to get back on our tandem bike and pedal 3 miles steep uphill to get home with it glowing darkly like a black hole star in our contented bellies.

Beautiful cola brown pour with a nice light mocha head. Swirl bings a bit of that back up. Taste is almost all hops, but a bit more of an aftertaste. Some stone fruits, almost a back taste of prunes, brown sugar. Subtle though, because it is the hop power that shine through, and a bit too much for my liking. Not that it matters because the mouthfeel is so smooth. Like many Stone beers this has a smooth and full body that lend itself to easy drinking. Alcohol is a nonissue. The only thing holding you back is your feeling about hoppy beers. This was gone in no time. I prefer this to a double IPA, which is just too much hops for me to take any more.

Chocolate and coffee flavor, rather burnt, with fruity hop flavors, citrus notes, pine and resin. Full, rather dry mouthfeel, and a long, piney and resiny finish with citrus. This is one of those lovely beers with layers and layers of aroma and flavor. The aroma being the best of those though.

This beer shows aromas of fresh hop flowers, coffee beans, vanilla, grapefruit, and some smokey, dark chocolate. The flavour profile is uniquely Stone's. There's a hop/grapefruit/citrus component leading into a porter like dark chocolate/coffee middle. It is also quite roasty with just a small amount of toffee sweetness towards the end. The finish is chalky, astringent, dry. Coffee bean, hoppy lingering aftertaste with an espresso bitterness. Quite a treat. Thanks for sending this my way Richard","mrmanning","Feb 14, 2010"

The smells and aroma are pleasant but not what I was expecting from Stone.... is that too meant to be sublime? I was waiting for a punch to the nostrils with hops and grain. I was quite delighted by the taste however. Near 9% ABV and the most I get is notes of coffee and sharp hop bitterness that clings to the back of the tongue long after the sip has passed.

It's a bit like Picasso - it doesn't end up being what it seems. It surprises you on two levels. The appearance and taste are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Then on top of that, both elements are fantastic in their own right. It looks like a glorious after-dinner stout, but tastes like a top-notch, flavorful and summery IPA.

4.06,-3.8,3,4.5,4,3,4.5,"This pours a dark, dark brown - definitely not quite black, with an effervescent head, loose quick forming and disappearing head. Looks decent, but not exiting. The smell gets you with C-hops, citrus, underripe mango, lemon-lime, with a lot of pollen, resin, flowers. Super flowery. But you get just a note of chocolate, caramelly sweetness. I guess it more than does its job as a black IPA. The taste definitely has more malt balance than the smell. It's very sweet and chocolatey, caramelly, not quite roasty like a stout, but the hops add greatly to the complexity. Pleasant and fruity, a nice layer of sweetness, mango and sweet oranges on top of some chocolatey tastes, not quite bready enough to remind me of cake. The body is moderately full, the carbonation is kind of hard to predict, but is a little low. Overall, its very nice and enjoyable, though the hoppiness pushes the envelope. I think its a good beer, like Stone IPA with some chocolatey sweetness, which I think is a bit of an improvement on the enjoyability.

I found a somewhat persistent frothy white head with the slightest of brown tints. I took a whiff and a got a noseful of hops, yet was not offended. It seemed to me like it smelled oddly familiar. Up-front hop bitterness in the taste seems to overwhelm the slightly roasted-tasting malt, but after about 1/4 of the glass I became accustomed to the bitterness and it was quite pleasant to drink.

Thick tanned head pours more than a finger full and laces all around the glass and has some lasting retension. Aroma is strikingly citrusy with a fresh hop smell. Some burnt malt subtleness is evident in the background. Hops really prevail in the nose. Taste is hop forward with citrus bitterness but burnt grains and a little bit of chocolate/coffee character fills in as well before the bitter finish that lingers. Light carb and medium feel. As it warms the alcohol becomes a bit more evident in the taste but I am not complaining, this is a fine beverage.","stakem","Dec 09, 2009"

The grains seem only to be present in a slightly burnt aroma. It was odd drinking a beer with this appearance/taste combination. Alcohol is really not noticeable...very drinkable.

The taste is really, really good! Lots of pine and citrus up front, very light malt, with a bitter chocolate finish that sticks around for 30 seconds or so before the chocolate starts coming through again, then fades away to hops. This is a very weird beer and one of the most unusual ales I've ever experienced. The feel is very smooth on the tongue and almost touches on creamy, but doesn't quite get there. This is a very drinkable beer and I could definitely have a few of these and not grow tired of it. I would say it's complex only because it fades in and out of a few flavors, there's not alot of stuff going on beyond hops and chocolate, but the way it blends is pretty impressive, especially when the color fools your brain into thinking there'll be more malt presence.

The flavor is very similar to the nose with grapefruit dominating, except there is a touch, and I mean a touch, of chocolate that comes through. The mouthfeel is about perfect, with the right amount of carbonation. It is pretty drinkable, a couple of bombers could probably be drank in one sitting.

This bottle changed all of those feelings I had, this beer nailed the dark roasts and the bold American hops. Stone is perfect I just had the Stone 13th and that was pretty lackluster and definitely carried no finesse. This on poured a pitch black body with no ruby highlights when held to the light, it did have a big tan foaming head that rose well above the rim of my glass. Lacing was even and retention was excellent great looking brew from Escondido. Aromatics hit a solid blast of pine and herbal hops with citrus following close behind, sweet baked goods with cocoa dry powder, definitely roasted malt characterstics wtihout much coffee action. Flavor was layered between dark chocolate roasted malt and aggressive hop bitterness that did manage to work. Some citrus, pine resin, and herbal dirty hop flavors came about between layers of dark chocolate cake it was a good mix with moderate alcohol burn coming through. Mouthfeel was big but not chewy carbonation was tight bubbled it carried the brew very well, not overdone pretty natural smoothness going on with a soothing dry finish between roasted malt and bittering hops. Drinkability overall was excellent another great reintroduction to Stone's black IPA, I had Iniquity last night from Southern Tier and I'm diggin' the dark hoppy beers.","WVbeergeek","Aug 20, 2009"

The brewers at the Stone Brewing Company, located in Escondido, CA, pride themselves on being able to consistently produce such fine works of art like this truly self-righteous ale. This beer was first produced in 2007 as their annual anniversary edition release and was such a huge hit they had to make more. When you poor it into the glass the color is black as pitch with nose that similar to most imperial IPAs with notes of grapefruit that dissipate to hints of red fruits. The palate was bitter, but a balanced bitterness that comes from both the hops and malts, with hints of cranberries in the beginning and finishes long and dry.

Otherwise, I though the flavor profiles were remarkably similar - not a bad thing since both beers are quite tasty! That being said, its a unique hybrid style and one that I enjoyed.

Completely and I mean completely black in color, you'd think it was a stout by looking at the glass. Then you smell and, wham, the hops slap you upside the head, all pink grapefruit, pine needles, tropical pineapple, guava, papaya, nectarine fruit, the floral side the weakest hops element, yields to burnt biscuits, lightly roasted coffee beans and peat moss. In the mouth it's full-bodied, muscularly sinewy and gets right up in your face. While there's no getting around that pink to white grapefruit, pine sap, licorice and bitters, here there's more equanimity shown towards the roasted malts and toasty dough elements, blends in coffee bean, hard toffee and a nip of butterscotch. The carbonation more prickly than anything else, fits in with the overall tingle. Balance for Stone is a high wire act blindfolded, but this one comes about as close as the brewery can get.

When held up against the light, some ruby highlights showed up, but otherwise this was pretty much a black beer in terms of look. The head atop seemed small but stable, and was quite light in color, which was in stark contrast to the body. The smell was like a hop field, which pine and grapefruit smells being quite prominent. Underneath them, there was some chocolate lurking there. The taste was quite hoppy indeed, which made me wonder if this was not a year old bottle, but rather a fresh brewed batch for us on the East coast. The spicy, prickly, earthy hoppyness was just as intense as any IPA, however the black patent malt astringency, and some chocolate flavor were unusual, but went surprisingly well with that. The body was more in line with IPA than the looks suggested, and this was very drinkable for me, since I like hoppy beers. Quite a unique combination, but it works.","rajendra82","Jun 27, 2009"

Well bodied, not quite chewy, fizzy carbonation, bitter all around, finishes with an asprin like dryness. Good contrast between the hops and malt but both bitter.

Starts off with a sweet malt flavor, but the hop bitterness follows. It is really an odd combination that, in the end, I really enjoy. The hops could be considered out of place, but it works! Almost like a chocolate orange at Christmas time. A bit dense, as a result of it being such a robust beer.

Overall this was a very unique beer! I love the concept and execution. This is what a black and tan (or porter?) should be. It was very clean and easy to drink, with great taste and pretty good body.

I was almost confused at first - the beer pours a very dark, nearly opaque brown color yet with a big fluffy head - but at a whiff it smells much like a sappy pine-riddled IPA. Lots of hops in the nose, but digging deeper you'll find a nice mellow chocolate character. The taste too is all hops up front. Really brashly bitter. Yes please. Resin and pine. Once your palate has been smacked around by the pine and resiny hop attitude you notice the whole roasty, chocolatey, rich underbelly of this beer.

There's pine and citrus, and orange, some fruity sweetness, and then comes in the roastiness at the end with coffee tones, and light caramel malt. When I taste it, I can tell that it's not fresh (which I wasn't expecting of course), but it still is pretty hoppy. It's a bit sweet, prickly, with some grassiness, then comes in the roasty chocolate character - it's quite interesting. I'm not sure if I'm really into it, but it sure is fun to try.

This is one interesting double IPA with a massive resiny hop bitterness in the finish. 90 IBUs completely hides the 8.7% abv, but even for the hop head that I am, I suggest drinking it on the cold side. Up front, there is a much better balance as a hint of roasted maltiness briefly rises above the piney, oily hop bitterness.

The mouthfeel was silky for a well hopped brew. The taste was like a roller coaster of flavors. The smooth chocholate and coffee taste takes center stage then the big citrus hops try to peak thru the murky flavors of all the malts. This beer was darker than most Indian brown ale's I've tried. Thanks to Stone for pushing the envelope.","athensbeermaster","Jan 21, 2009"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of my favorite Stones. A little more accessible that the Bastard beers from Stone, yet is has a character of its own. Pours extremely dark for an ale. Great head and retention. Aroma is very Stone, as is the taste. Hoppy and thick - lots of layers to the flavor. Fruits, figs, then some smokey dark woody notes. Very pleasant and smooth taste and feel. 55 degrees is best for this beer, similar to the Bastard beers. This has become something of a regular for me - luckily I bought a case a while back. I'm looking forward to the Self-Righteous Ale so I can get a case of that. Man I love Stone!","prsguitarsr4me","Jan 20, 2009"

4.37,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Off the tap at Stone Night this beer was a nearly opaque dark brown with some very deep mahogany hues visible against bright light. The head was tan, one-finger thick and retained well as a thick collar that left lacing in broken sheets. Good looking for sure, if it were a lady, I'd be picking her up. The aroma was intriguing, like an IPA gone evil, to further the metaphor, the lady with torn fishnet stockings and red, red lipstick. Big floral hops, rich malts and a depth of spiciness. The flavors were equally complex, deeply floral hops, balanced with robust malt, elements of pine, caramel sweetness in the middle, hints of mocha and milk chocolate. The punchy 8.7% was well concealed and I had to give it high marks for being both impressive and unique. The mouthfeel was very creamy, the body full and the carbonation perfectly smooth. An unusual treat.","thekevlarkid","Jan 12, 2009"
4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"From a 1L growler fill at the brewery. It's interesting how this beer has changed over time. Just in the last 6 months a ton of the hop character has started to fade since the last time I tasted this beer. It's closer to a strong brown ale now than it's former dark IPA self. It still has a good strong hop profile, but it is mellow and round with the malt. Don't expect this beer to slam you over the head with hops, but expect a big malty beer that is still fairly bitter.","Brewsmith","Jan 10, 2009"
4.23,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Love this stuff. Pours dark brown, almost black, with a creamy off-white head. Cascade hops, some resin, dry pine needles, some earthy leaves and wood. Clean, dry hop bite. Roasty, burnt coffee-like maltiness mixes well. This is the first time I have ever had such a blend. Kind of like an over-hopped porter or a black IPA with malt and coffee. Worked out nicely.","magictrokini","Jan 05, 2009"

3.96,-6.2,5,4,4,3,4,"Stone XI is a solid black ale with red highlights. It has a creamy tan head with oily bubbles. Great retention and lacing. It has an aroma of licorice and medicine. It almost smells like seawater. There is salmiakki and something leafy in the nose. It's medium-bodied and a bit sharp with a gritty finish. The roast really comes out in the flavor, along with a bit of chocolate. It's quite bitter! It tastes like Christmas trees. It's bold and flavorful and has good balance.

Taste is a cross between a really nice dark ale and a hoppy IPA. Sweet and malty but finishes bitter and citrusy. Excellent stuff. Sturdy, full mouthfeel and this is one easy to drink brew.

3.98,-5.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer is the darkest IPA I've ever seen. Stone calls this an IBA or India black ale. It is a deep and dark brown color with a full slightly dirty tan head on it. This beer left creamy rings of lacing until the very last sip. The scents that dominate this beer lean heavily towards piney hops, loads of tropical fruit like tangerines, mango, and passion fruit with a touch of caramel waving from the back row. My brain is perplexed at something that looks like this beer but smells the way that it does. The flavor profile starts with heavy floral hops notes providing plenty of bitterness, but the malt begins to show its assertiveness with dark roasted malt and dark fruits (plums and raisins) coming to life as the beer warmed. The finish brings back those hops with plenty of citrus and pine and showing you what Stone Brewing is famous for. The mouthfull is a bit chewy and sticky, but yet the finish is actually quite creamy. The drinkability is quite nice on this beer since the alcohol was extremely well hidden on this offering.","TheodorHerzl","Jun 19, 2008"

Pours a dark brownish black yet somewhat clear with a thick fluffy off white head that lingers around for quite a while. Taste is very citrusy and definite big hop characteristics.

Flavor is earthy hops from start to finish with some molasses and brown sugar. Pretty bitter as well, too bitter actually, sounds just weird associating that witch such a dark beer. The coffee grind flavor is there which adds more to the bitter effect. Very dry in the mouth with a full medium body. Strong carbonation on the tongue. I guess being classified as a Strong Ale is a pretty good fit seeing it beat the shit out of my mouth. I just wasn't feeling this beer.

I read the bottle and it said IPA, but this appearance is throwing me off. Strong floral hop aroma, sweet pine, and a light dash of citrus. I am pulling some tart green apple. Some sweet malts makes this remind me of a barley wine. Very hoppy, slight citrus with a very sweet yet subtle malt characteristic. Great grapefruit taste. This makes me crave a barley wine for comparison. Definitely more hoppy than a barley wine but the malts are wonderful in this. The mouthfeel is a little on the dry side for my liking, but understandable with the high alpha hops. Mild carbonation. A nice treat.

There is a mild stream of carbonation in it, and clarity is hard to gauge due to the dark color of the brew. Good looker here. The aroma is interesting. There is a nice pungent hop that is coming across very earthy and piney, though I imagine that fresh it was more brilliant. There is a strong malt backbone in there, with a good bit of bready and melanoidan toastyness. There is a hint of anise spicyness as well. It is an interesting mix. The flavor brings an initial hop that is slightly citrusy and earthy, this is followed by a peculiar malt flavor. I get bready and molasses qualities with an infusion of spicy anise. The hop bitterness really hits along with the sharpness that gives me a molasses. I find the bitterness to be a little too harsh for my liking. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a light carbonation. It has a bit of slickness to it. Overall, I think the flavors clash a bit in here. I find the hop bitterness to linger a bit too strong on my tongue. This one is certainly good, but I think it is a little too forceful and slightly unrefined overall to me.","kmpitz2","Mar 23, 2008"

With first sip you get... oh what is this, smoooth well developed hop profile followed by a biscuity malty feel. Fresh fruitness gives some sweetness in the middle mixed in with some veggies and spicey malt. A hoppy burnt bitterness is left painted all over the mouthfeel.

There are some faint suggestions of bread and honey mixed in there, but this is a hophead's brew. As it warms, balance appears, allowing a stronger malt profile to emerge.

Sort of a smoky flavor and sweet aroma at first- the taste is huge- lots of hops all over. You can notice the sweetness in the ale. It tastes like an IPA, but the smokiness makes it quite different and very enjoyable. Unique.","AaronRed","Jan 06, 2008"
4.67,10.7,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"A light brown color, with touches of red along the sides of the glass. A two inch thock head foems, beige in color, and lacing slowly down the glass. An incrdible aroma of citrus, mostly grapefruit, pine and grass scents, with a earthy mellowness. There is a surprisingly feint scent of malt at the end. At first taste that malt is very apparent, with a sweet, nutty flavor. That flavor is overtaken by a dominant hop presence, with grapefruit and grassy tastes being the strongest. A medium bodied feel all the way through, very consistant, coats the palate evenly and a dry finish lingers for some time. WOW! What else is there to say, this is an excellent beer. I thought the tenth anniversary brew was outstanding, this beer surpasses that one.","cameraman","Jan 05, 2008"

This one takes the cake though. Its appearance is as exciting as the taste profile. The dominant hops are not overpowering so that the chocolate and roasted malts come through. I am not sure why this is labeled as American Strong Ale. It is not like Old Thumper or the old Magic Hat Red Ale, its an IPA on steroids, GREAT BEER.","kidcas","Jan 04, 2008"
4.45,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep brown color with a full, persistent head. Aroma has a bunch of citrus hoppiness in there along with some nice roastiness that pushes through once you expect the hops. taste is all IPA at first, then a bit more of a dry chocolate malt flavor comes through. The malt sweetness seems to build as you drink, and the hop flavor also becomes more sweet and less bitter. Really an enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel is solid, maybe just a tad heavy for the workout the flavor gives you. Drinkabiity is also very good. Something interesting that I'd like to see more examples of in the future.","aaronh","Jan 04, 2008"

Delightful as a meal in itself.","Sammy","Dec 22, 2007"
4.73,12.1,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Stone XI poured a deep ruby color, more along the characteristics of a Stout than a brown ale. The head was dark, rich, and had a ""surge"" similar to a Guinness. The smell had a noticeable aroma of earthy hops and a slight roasted malt undertone. The taste was true to the aroma; it had a solid roasted malt character that sat well on the tongue and faded gently into a distinct and enjoyable hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very good, a nice body but not heavy or thick. This beer is quite drinkable, but be careful to enjoy in moderation or it will bite you back. Enjoy!","DevilDogBeer","Dec 21, 2007"

4.56,8.1,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow! Definitely one to try. I wasn't sure what to expect as its only listed as Stone XI and mentions a dark IPA on the back. Pours a brownish-black color with ruby accents around the perimeter. The head is a little too over abundant and hangs around in thick 1-2"" clumps after finishing a pint. As it warms the head only multiplies in following pours, leaving long yearning minutes of undrinkable beer due to a mountain of foam. Smell is intoxicating! A porter?, an IPA?, BOTH! Smells of toasted oats and grain while balanced by a hoppy aroma, slight citrus note, porter and some barley wine qualities. This is among Stone's better brews as it is an ensemble to the sense. Let this beer sit from the fridge for awhile and it's definitely a treat.","dhilltop2000","Dec 19, 2007"

Sticky rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a cross between an Imperial IPA and a roasty Porter. Loads of citrusy hops in the nose, with a full roasted malt undertone. Other aromas like pine and toffee are present as well. Rich and bitter with a full array of citrusy and piney hops flavors. Toasted malt and chocolate flavors are found too. Slow alcohol burn through it all. The finish is long and bitter with a tasty grapefruit hops finish. Excellent overall.

Aromas are of a hoppy IPA but also there is some roasted and chocolate maltin there as well. This is kind of a cross between death and taxes and racer 5. The malt background is nice and the hoppy/piney/citrusy middle smooths out into a chocolate caramel coated hop finish of roastiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and helps this beer achieve a solid drinkability level. Nice one.","francisweizen","Dec 11, 2007"

The flavor starts with sweet dark caramel, but it quickly gives way to bitter, citrusy hops. If I wasn't looking at the color of this beer I would just assume it was a big resiny DIPA, but if I look for them, the roasted malts come through in the finish. The alcohol and strength are both well hidden, probably because the beer is just overboard with flavor.","ericj551","Dec 08, 2007"

I do, however, like the experiment, and I have a feeling that this can be a kind of strong ale to set the standards for more like it, with the odd-enough and unheard-of hybird, at least from me, of IPA and Porter, which this beer does, somehow, quite singularly and successfully. Certainly beyond worth a try if you can find a bottle. And even if you wouldn't go for such a style, this isn't going to be around for long of course.","asabreed","Dec 05, 2007"

Nose has a profound hop floral spiciness at the front, backed by the sweet malt, caramel, and maybe a hint of chocolate, mouth watering. Start has a nice malt sweetness; hop bitter bite to the back, top is moderately full in feel.

However, like most Stone brews, that second half of the bomber goes down way to quick! Still, I couldn't really take to big of a swig, that weird sweet and sour combo was just too much. I had this right when it came out, and this one tastes about the same, maybe a hair sweeter, but I think the store kept it chilled the past 3 months, as the hops are still in full effect. I'm gonna cellar one just to see what happens in about 2 years.

4.15,-1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Looks like root beer, smells like hops. Nice fluffy tan colored head that sticks around for a good while. Good lacing. Aroma is mosty piney and sappy with nuances of caramel and suggestive chocolate. Some leafy suggestions as well. Very hoppy with bitterness throughout, yet some malty sweetness comes through, too. Pretty balanced and drinkable. The roasted malts make for an interesting twist on what would be, typically, an imperial IPA. Kind of feels like an ""imperial stock ale"". I like it, it reminds me of of an ale I brewed 10 years ago, except the Simcoe hop was not around then and Cascades were used and I, accidentally, used a bit too much chocolate malt in the grain bill. Anyhow, Stone's 11th is an agreeable ale worth checking out.","crookedhalo","Nov 04, 2007"

Initially the mouthfeel seems a bit harsh, but that fades very quickly to a full boddied brew with a slightly fizzy finish. Another well rounded offering from Stone.

A little bit of licorice and chocolate is also there following the hops. A very subtly carbonated beer brings forth a freshly hopped beer rounded out by lots of caramel and chocolate malts. The finish is quite bitter and dry with the hop flavor carrying through. This is an exquisite beer, I'm glad to enjoy it at this date as any more aging would kill the fresh hop flavor.

I recently brewed a double black IPA and thought it was wonderful, but it pales in comparison to this. This is, undoubtedly, an Imperial Black IPA. The unbelievable hop powerhouse aroma unleashes itself immediately. Massive pine and grassy overtones explode in the nose. Sticking your head in a bin of freshly picked hops is comparable to this smell. Jet black body with beige head. Lacing was intense and carbonation was lively. The taste was all IPA from beginning to end. Wonderful hop presence throughout with a warming alcohol taste. Maltiness is there but well hidden behind the hops. Sharpness is intense but very enjoyable. The high abv is hidden behind the IBUs. This is a wonderfully crafted beer that hop heads need to try. I would love to know how they managed to get the dark body without the roasted bitterness. For my Black IPA, I cold steeped de-bittered black malt for 2 days.

The mouthfeel was fluffy as though this were a cask-conditioned beer. Interesting! There are definite dark-roasted, slightly burnt notes in the flavor. The burnt malt flavor dominates the hops hops somewhat, so the hops in the smell are stronger than in the flavor. This is a very interesting hybrid style.

The beer pours a lot like a dry stout: very dark brown, nearly opaque, and with a firm, withstanding head formation and retention throughout. It's basically a black beer. Aromas are very deceiving comming from a black beer; with a heavy citrus hop nose and backup notes of pine, lemon-grass, and charcoal. The beer tastes similarly from the hop's side. But the beer has a different story too: the malts. The sweet malt character is very similar to the candy-sweet flavors found in Belgian Dark Strong beers -- but without the yeasty, peppery, phenolic twang. This beer is all American with a high attenuation rate and hop domination throughout. Though the hops side and malts side make the beer enjoyable, they may be two separate beers, caught in the same bottle and need much more melding together to do. As is, it's a firm DIPA with challenging malt character. Good beer, but time will surely do it some favors. But as American Strong Ales go, I prefer Arrogant Bastard.","BEERchitect","Oct 18, 2007"

Big floral hops smell that just blows me away. This has to be one of the best smelling beers ever. Some sweet malt comes through in the background but it is really the floral smell that stands out. Taste is hoppy up front and then big malts kick in. Very sweet followed by a mild bitterness. Solid chewy mouthfeel that lets you know there something behind this one. Once again a solid beer from Stone.","beermanbrian","Oct 12, 2007"

A smooth, small bitterness mouthfeel and a grapefruity hop aftertaste. A hop bomb, interesting in color and style.

Notes of bright, tropical fruit and balanced citrus, hop resin. Faint hints of mustiness along with a light biscuit aroma. The flavors are rounded tropical fruit: pineapple, peach, apricot; as well as, notes of ripe pine/spruce. Light breadiness; very clean, with just a hint of phenolic mustiness.

Stone calls it a Imperial BPA (Black Pale Ale). Well for me it poured beautifully, The thick tan head above a midnight black beer looked like the perfect stout(especially poured into a pint guinness glass), but the taste is anything but that similar to a stout. The head faded as the beer was drunk leaving a perfect lace ring to mark each sip's journey down the glass. I'm not sure I can describe all the flavors I'm tasting. First there's a strong flavor of roast coffee, and burnt malt, followed by a winey, nutty middle, that ends with the dry astingency found in this brewery most noted of hoppiest of beer like their IPA and Ruinnation. The winey flavor and the roasted hops converge to leave a long lingering aftertaste you will long remember. I had this beer in bottle and on draft within the last three days, the most notible different was the draft version had a very noticable alcohol burn, I'd even call it a rush of warmth that doesn't come through in the bottle. I still want to lay down a bottle of this complexed bottle of flavors for at 8.70% ABV the changes can only be interesting. Do pick up a bottle!","NJBeerguy","Oct 06, 2007"

It's quite complex with bit of roasted and black malts as well. The hops dominate the aroma. They're bold and add balance to a hefty malt bill. The taste is awesome. It has a pronounced roasted malt character. It's dark with a warming finish. It goes down hoppy and ends hoppy. What a beautiful beer. The hops resinate after the finish, but a lingering roasted malt taste remains. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass beer; one of the best IPA's I've ever had, black or not. I do enjoy the roasted character.","WesWes","Oct 04, 2007"

Pours a very dark ruby, almost black with a couple fingers of lacy tan head that stays well. Smells of grassy hops and a little malt. Tastes malty with bitter almost pineapple hops with a different hop profile that Im now realizing is particular to this style. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation. Took a little time to finish. The better of the two Dark IPAs that Ive tried. Though its not a bad style, I still prefer is predecessor.","franksnbeans","Oct 04, 2007"

The aroma is a very sweet fruity, reminds me of the Avery's big beers. The flavor has a get mix of hops flavors that change as the beer warms. It covers floral, fruit punch, citrus rind, and finishes with an herbal black pepper taste. Yummy. There's a touch of cocoa in the background, sort of like what baking cocoa adds to a mole sauce.

4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark brown, clear, with ruby/mahogany highlights. Fine, tan bubbles clung in sheets to the sides of the glass and formed a tight cap. Good head retention with spotty lacing throughout. Intense pine resin and grapefruit rind aroma up front, fruity citrus and a hint of sweet cocoa fill in the background. Very floral and fragrant. Solid bitterness, not overpowering, that tends to linger. Sweetness is just enough to provide some balance and has more of a chocolate/cocoa character than stright-up caramel, but the hops are still front and center - mostly grapefruit flesh fruitiness and a bit of pine. Light alcohol flavour in the finish, along with mild warmth. Medium bodied, a bit chewy with creamy carbonation. Very nice texture. This is great stuff, worthy of an anniversary celebration. The darker malts, even though they're fairly subtle, really pull things together and create a nice counterpoint for the hops.","DrJay","Sep 22, 2007"

4.29,1.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"It looks like a porter; mostly black with a tan head. Smells like an imperial IPA, but with a faint roasted note hinting at Imperial Stout. Hops up front - Stone style. If I closed my eyes, the first few sips might taste like that of a fresh Ruination, but as the beer warms up in my mouth, the astringincy of roasted malts kick in, and I would have to open my eyes at this point. Now there is not a pronounced stout character as that would add too much malt to compete with the hops, so they have wisely chosen what kind and how much dark malts to use in order to achieve this. This will no doubt spark a new age of imperial Stout/ IPA hybrids (just three days before this was on the shelves in my area, I had tasted a bartender's blend of Old Rasputin and Two-Hearted Ale) and we will see who comes out with a more roasted version that still brings the hop aroma and flavor before it just becomes an Imperial Stout with too much hops.

I thought X was a really good IPA (glad I have another bottle), but this black IPA is so unique. The ability to combine a big, hoppy, Double IPA with dark, roasty malts is something else. Doesn't come across as a hoppy Porter as you might expect from its appearance, but its a true, honest to god, big time West Coast DIPA. Plenty of of citrusy hops (dare I say Amarillo or Simcoe?) with a subtle roastiness and plenty of malt sweetness to balance things out. Being 8.7% makes this a sipping beer for sure, but man is it drinkable. The dryness in the finish begs you to take another drink. Definitely seek out and enjoy, highly recommended. A hop heads delight for sure. Glad I grabbed a couple of bottles. Can't wait to cellar and try again next year.","SwillBilly","Sep 21, 2007"

The smell is definitely fresh simcoe hops, and I have to stop to smell every time I go for a taste. The taste is perfect. There is a strong dark chocolate taste, and bitter like unsweetened chocolate chips, but goes very well with this. There is a lingering and pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste that seems like a perfect balance of dark chocolate and fresh hops. I can't get enough of the fresh hop taste. The chocolate taste really reminds me of FFF Alpha Klaus, but the overall flavor is definitely DIPA. After smelling this when I first poured it, I thought for sure there is no way it will taste as good as it smells. I was very wrong. I picked up two cases of this and have already called to set aside a third. Hopslam and Un-earthly will always have a special place in my fridge, but this stuff is hoppier, and just plain delicious.

4.4,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours coffee black with a substantial tan head that recedes slowly while leaving a wash of sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma is brightly hoppy. Huge citrus character. Based on aroma alone, this most closely resembles the Summer Yulesmith. My first impression upon tasting is that this beer could possibly age quite well. There is plenty of malt lying just below the surface of all that hop presence. Like a furious undertow waiting to drag you out to sea as if to prove it's just as powerful as a towering wave. As it is, there is just a ton of flavors vying for my taste buds' attention. Tough to pick them out singularly, but there is definite chocolate, roasted coffee and fig presence to go along with those great hop characteristics that we all know so well. Together, these flavors combine to produce a pretty strong bitterness. Despite the intense battle going on between so many different strong flavors, this brew finishes pretty clean. Mouthfeel is dialed in just right. It's slightly thick and a bit oily, and the carbonation is ratcheted down a notch or two. Very smooth on the tongue with just enough bite to satisfy. Fits the flavor profile nicely. Overall, I really like this beer and am impressed by Stone's apparent eagerness to step outside the box and put out something so unique. Not sure I like this one quite as much as last years anniversary ale, but I'm excited about seeing what will happen to this one over time. I plan to put at least 6 of these away and won't check on it for another 6-8 months. I see great potential and think it might be even better once some of these background players step to the front of the stage.","jakon","Sep 19, 2007"

I poured this beer in to a sniffer glass without really reading the description on the back...in fact I didn't really know anything about this beer, but with Stone I feel like you can bet safely that you are getting quality product when you take a chance on one of their brews. The pour was charcoal black, with no light getting through and a white head. ""Stout? fuck no, this is way too hoppy for that"" I thought, then decided to check out the label. A black ipa certainly sounds like something interesting to me. Aroma had piney hops, grapefruit, earth, and some rough spices. Beer is chocked full of hops in the flavor, with a nice malt touch in there as well. I also detect a slight hint of rye bread and garlic. Mouthfeel is bordering between medium and heavy for me, although that could be in part because of the fact that the dark coloration of this one makes you think that it is a heavy brew. Easy on the drinkability as well, although I would definitely say that this is one to sip and savor. Kickass offering from Stone right here. They should make this a year round kind of brew.

Earthy bold coffee flavors from the dark roasted malts with a definite alcohol flavor drying out the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is not-too-thick, but it does have a nice viscocity. Oily and smooth.

Anyway, if you only have one bottle drink it now, cause it is at it's peak fresh hoppiness right now. It will be interesting to see how the dark malt character plays out; it is very subtle right now and if this was put in a blind IPA tasting (you would actually have to be blind folded though), most would have a hard time guessing this was not a typical, albeit supper hoppy IPA.","Gueuzedude","Sep 02, 2007"
