"Everything Sierra Nevada brews is done well as in this I.P.A."
"I did not like this beer. It looks good and smells alright. But tasted mildly bitter, malty and ashy. I am a big fan of Sierra Nevada. Maybe black ales are not for me."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is ok but it's not as bitter as I would have thought for a BIPA. Closer to a porter in fell even with the high carbonation."
""
""
""
"Looks like a Guinness @ the pour.dark and foamy head.ocean like lacing.dirt like taste.smooth taste and finish..Prost"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes:  This is more of a bad stout than it is a BIPA"
""
""
"Not very good. Bitterness is flat. Mouth feel is thin and somewhat slippery. Looks substantial but taste and complexity is  not satisfying."
""
"Overall 70 IBUs?  Bottle was ""PKGD 01/15/15  15:52"" so it's not old.  This is more like ""Sort of hoppy porter."""
""
""
""
"Very nice BIPA, would definitely recommend."
""
"Overall - I like it, but will drink it as a stout, not an ipa"
""
""
""

"Awesome clean stout taste that is known for Sierra Nevada beers. Hop taste is noticeable but not overbearing. A perfectly balanced combination."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very nice beer, although I think the bitterness is a little low for the style..  Still smooth and enjoyable."
""
""
"Btw this ale has two other entries, one discontinued and another from the original beer camp..."
""
""
""
""
"This one grows on me. Very subtle black IPA, but extremely smooth. Certainly a good entry level brew for the style. SN once again puts out a winner."
""
""
""
""
"Not getting much IPA here, much more a stout IMO.  Maybe it's out of date."
""
""
"O: This is pretty spot on for a black IPA in my books. The hops are good and assertive up front, but the dark malt pushes back too. I dig it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I welcome the others but not back to back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose roasted malt, cocoa, pine, faint citrus, smokiness, & coffee.  Taste roasted malt, chocolate, slight coffee, earthy, & grassy, pine."

"starts as a porter, then comes to bitter with too much after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good roasted malt flavor, some black licorice, and a modest hop bitterness to finish."
"O: I was expecting more citrusy or piny hop aromas and flavors on this, wasn't there, more roasty than hoppy, still a good tasting beer. It's almost 6 weeks old so I am not sure if the hops have died off, but it's less than I expected."
"Tastes more like a stout than an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't bad, just didn't rate too high with me. Wookey Jack is much better by comparison."

"I like the Blindfold.....its not as bold as the Stone SSRA but its an lighter version.  It pours a dark opaque with think ecru head that is leaving a nice lacing.  The scent carries pine and some citrus like hops.  The taste carries IPA flare with coffee/roast/peat base.  The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation.  Overall....solid."

"The only minor tweak I would make would be to turn down the carbonation a notch, but this is a minor quibble as the beer is tasty and balanced."
""
""
""
""
"O: a pretty good black IPA; probably my 2nd favorite from the 4-way IPA pack, after Snow White Wit."
""

"It's an IPA, so it's supposed to be hoppy, but the dark color makes you think it would be sweet and malty as well, but it isn't. If you think you'd like a slightly coffee flavored. bitter, hoppy beer, then you'll like this. I did."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice black IPA, enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""
"A real nice Black IPA Wouldn't mind seeing this in 6 packs."
""
""
""
""
"Another solid beer from Sierra Nevada, who, it appears, can do near no wrong. Not my absolute favourite CDA, but solid and drinkable, and worth the 4-way IPA pack in which it came, even if the other three variations weren't already enjoyable themselves (which for the most part they are, though this is probably my favourite of the four -- yes that includes Torpedo. SUCH HERESY!)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good, but it would have been nice to try this fresher to get a better sense of the hop presence intended. Considering that, this is solid and worth the try."

"Poured into a standard pint glass, this is certainly a dark beer, but it also has a good finger's width of offwhite foam atop it, dense and lasting. The nose features some good dark-malt aroma, like a European dunkel, toast-crusty not caramel nor roast. I can't find any hops in the smell, though, which is odd for anything labeled ""IPA"". The hops do come through in the flavor, but it's primarily bitterness, without hop flavor. It does have a nice complex malt, all bready, but I think the description IPA is definitely off. This is just a bitter dark ale. As far as ""black IPAs"" go, this isn't a particularly interesting one of the bunch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - rarely do I meet a SN beer that I don't like, and this is no different!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this beer presents a very nice balance, showcasing the two primary elements of a black ale quite well - this is what a black ale should be. I would get this again if it went to six packs."
""
"I didn't really notice a overpowering nose to this beer. The taste is very satisfying. Starts with a good hop hit with quite a bit of floral notes. The coffee  flavor as a finish is a little bitter but that is OK. Thin head good cling to the glass. Good overall everyday beer in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black, white foam starts at 1/4 inch and settles with lacing. Chocolate malty nose, some pine. Rich malt open flavor that eases into a subtle pine mint taste. Notes of earthy coffee and dark chocolate. Oily hoppy close. Real good black IPA, balanced and chewy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There’s an underlying coffee roast aroma with a light grapefruit note. The flavor is surprisingly piney, with a big intense bitterness and a long lingering finish. Some roast and dark chocolate comes through and round it out."

"O-A well made black IPA, easily the best of the new beers from the pack."
""
""
"O: Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty beer."
""
""
"Poured a big foamy head on a black body. The aroma is rich roasted malt with lemon coming in second. The taste starts with smooth roasted malt with moderate lemon bitterness. Nice balance. The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. Really good.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer and you could certainly drink a couple."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's delicious and seems like a departure from the more traditional offerings from SN."

"O - Overall I enjoy this beer very much. I am a big porter drinker but also enjoy the IPAs. This beer is the perfect combination of both. Starts out mildly hoppy and then is smoothed out by the malts. Ends dry like most most good IPAs. Very clean smelling and tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Seems to have more hop character than the original ""Beer Camp"" variant, while still maintaining that nice roast malt base, and for me that's a plus. This is a beer I might consider buying a sixer of from time to time... if that day were to come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a medium-high level of carbonation. Small hop bite, finishes clean. Overall, this is a good entry level black ipa, which is as accessible as it is hop forward."
""
""
""
""

"D – This one drinks more like an American Porter… That’s not a bad thing, just an observation… It’s what I’ve come to expect from most Sierra Nevada offerings… Solidly above average and not much more… A decent beer worth exploring, but not something I would revisit with regularity given the increasing number of quality American Black Ales readily available in the market place…"
"Overall a good Black IPA, and even above average compared to what I’ve had, but not outstanding. Easy to drink and hoppy enough to fit in with the Sierra Nevada profile, it was a good new beer from Sierra Nevada and one that I would definitely recommend and have again."
""
""
"Overall, this one's a bit reminiscent of Avery's New World Porter. Like a porter meets a piney, Cascadian IPA. The odd combo of roastiness and hop bitterness can be jarring at first, but this one evens out just fine. A good beer with an impressively long finish /aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O - A nice black IPA. Definetly worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A really good black IPA. The best one the variety 4-way pack."

"My favorite of the 4 in this twelve pack, great example the style done right"
""
"O.. This is another strong entry from SN but falls slightly short of outstanding. Easy going for 6.8% ABV. Certainly worth a try (or two)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice dark malt profile with a bit of roast and even slight dark chocolate, but the hops just didn't do it for me, the earthy pine and forest floor aren't too bad except they start to clash with the dark malts IMO, and the mild orange is also meh. I do like that little minty herbal tea note late on the finish, and the grassy and spicy hop notes would have been a nice touch if they earthy piney citrus rind hops didn't overpower it. Again just continues that this is one of my least fav styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty solid beer and right in line with SN standards. Probably my favorite from the variety pack. A big flavor beer with a nice balance of hops and malts, not for amateurs. Its nothing earth shattering but a great change of pace from normal IPAs. I'd definitely give this one a try and would buy a six pack in the future, but I wouldnt kill a man for it."
""
""
"More ""black"" than ""IPA"".. More hops please."
""
"Drinkability- Very good! They did a great job with this one. Very smooth! I would love to and will have this one again!"
""
""
""
""
"o: A tasty and well-balanced black IPA. Wanting to do a side-by-side with Shipyard's new Black IPA. Also left wondering if this is a second production run of Beer Camp #73 Black Ale, which was also called ""Blindfold."" Perhaps not though, that one had a significantly higher (7.4%) ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Does not have the dark malt flavor that I look for in these beers. Still some really nice hop flavors and excellent mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer, overall, though quite bitter. I'd like a bit more depth and less bitterness."
""

"Pours almost black. Can see through and see ruby tints. Nice tan, long lasting head. Smells of chocolate malts with some roast in the background. Some spicy hops and some fruitiness. No off flavors but I expected a stronger hop aroma. Upfront roast & chocolate with a nice firm bitterness that follows. Some coffee flavors and spicy hops. Maybe a little pine. Mouthfeel seems about medium with nice crisp bitterness and good carbonation. Overall, a nice attempt at a black IPA. Would like the hops to pop out some more as I feel the dark malts are a little too much in the forefront. Even still, not a bad beer whatsoever. Very drinkable and solid from SN."
""
""

"The taste is malty up front with a woody and toasted taste with some peppery hops entering mid palate with a more bitter flavor increasing toward the end. The malt is bitter with deep roast in the taste almost charcoal like burnt with some interesting caramel accents but hops linger in the flavor after the swallow with some pine and herbal accents. Overall this is a decent beer, not my favorite example of the style but well brewed and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a well-made delicious brew. Nice blend of malt and hops. An excellent example of a hop-forward black ale!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a good Black IPA, but it leans more towards the malty side and the hops are more complementary."
""
""
""
""
"In general I like this beer. It looked fantastic and smelled great. Now all they need to do is work on the taste."
""
"Overall a good black IPA, I hope to try more soon to get a better gauge on the style."
"This is a good brew. I'll certainly enjoy the other 2 bottles in the box."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer, and one that I would love to have again. It's a solid brew, and one that demonstrates what makes Black IPA's so awesome. I'm a sucker for Black IPA's as it's honestly the closest that you can get to the best of both worlds."
"Blindfold is not a big in your face black ipa. It does not contain a huge ABV, no long alcohol finish, no acute hop twinge. What blindfold is a well crafted, well balanced ale. Plenty of roasted malt flavor, but the blend of summit and cascade hops really brings it all together. Really well done!"
