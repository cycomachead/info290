Wonderful aroma of piney hops and dark malt. The hop taste actually seems pretty tame compared to what I'm getting from the aroma. This is still fairly bitter with piney hops,but that dark malt backbone is very apparent. Mouth is a bit thinner than I would have imagined. The flip side of course is that it's not as filling as a typical IPA at that ABV.","Franziskaner","May 12, 2014"

Full bodied and slightly chewy, the hops are strong and this beer is more hoppy than malty, not that the balance is totally askew. The roasted malts are evident and there is a slight biscuit feeling along with sweetness, but mostly I get the strong hop presence in this beer. I really like this ale as I prefer black ipas that are hoppier than what is usual of style.","clayrock81","Apr 08, 2014"

4.02,2,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"As a fan of black ipas and Green Flash, I was quite excited to see this on my store's shelves. It pours a deep black with a generous off-white head that gives way to a nice film but little lacing. The nose is a beautiful balance of citrus and pine hops and roasty coffee and caramel malt aromas. It sips quite light and very clean and crisp. I actually had hoped this would have a little more body to it. The flavor, while delicious, is not as good as the aroma. The hits with a very west coast hop bite, lots of citrus and pine. Then comes on with the roasted malts. The finish and aftertaste is coffee and bitter chocolate. There is a nice balance but I almost feel it could use just a touch more sweetness. It is definitely one if the hoppier black ipas that I have tried. Not my favorite black ipa or Green Flash offering but damn good.","lochef81","Mar 09, 2014"

Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings aruound the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, orange zest, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, pineapple, mango, orange zest, grapefruit, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange zest, cocoa, toast, light roast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with light-moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice black IPA. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Raw hop character in a black IPA format, the appearance is cola brown with ruby highlights, big tan head forms thick, rocky texture. Aroma has pungent citrus peel and dark roasted malt layers combined into one, goes great with food. But my ideal IPA is citrus fruit grassy and clean the muddled alpha acids with dark roasts just don't work as well as your typical IPA without the dark roasted malts. Flavors have the dark chocolate notes with herbal, herbaceous dank weed, and grapefruit peel bitterness heavy in the backend finishes dry without much finesse. It's just hops and dark bitter roasted malt without much poetry between the two, gimme a porter or an hoppy IPA in place of the hybrid any day. Mouthfeel is resinous with hop oils it even makes your nares burn with the combination. Overall I can't wait to try something more approachable in the Black IPA department, this is good but I know there could be better versions out there.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

4.23,7.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Scored the growler at DeCicco's (Brewster, NY) last weekend and poured into the pint glass chilled this shows a very dark ruby edges mahogany color. The head is thick and light tan in color, leaving a substantial layer of lacing. The nose hit is full of bright citrus, grapefruit and orange with a twisted pine quality in there for good hop measure. Just a vague malt complement comes through as well. Very nice. The first taste sensation brings brilliant citrus but blends nicely with a brown bread cereal malt. The dominating theme remains the rather sharp hop flavors but there is a clearer note of some malt and even a licorice nuance with a sort of minty outcome. Just delicious if you favor hop character in your IPA's. This brew is easily medium bodied with a smooth, somewhat luscious feel. Carbonation is a bit dainty but provides an effective tingly sensation on the tongue. Great results here for Green Flash!","Durge","Mar 15, 2013"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, citrus zest, and slight cocoa. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with more of an emphasis on hoppy versus roasty aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","0"
