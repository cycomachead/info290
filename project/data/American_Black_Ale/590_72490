Enticing aroma of fresh,piney hops is moderately present.  The flavor is a well balanced blend of piney hops and caramelized dark malt.  There's a prominent pine hop edge that stays with you in the fade.  The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy.","Franziskaner","Feb 27, 2015"

The malts provide a slightly sweet caramel flavor the melds well with the citrusy hops (the bottle says the hops are piney and citrusy, but I get more citrus than pine).","Lucular","Jan 24, 2015"

3.95,-3.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"a hoppy black ale that combines sweet and roasted barley and chocolate malt with a rather delicate, if high volume, citrusy hopping. a very interesting marriage of flavors here. not as black as expected, dark brown glowing amber in the light under an inch of off white fluff that settles slowly. the nose here is citrus hops and roasted barley with all of its attendant bitterness. seems brighter than it looks, and a sturdy ale yeast ties the two together. the flavor starts and ends with the dark malt. not brutally dark, but earthen and well roasted. the hops are only in the middle, not in the finish, which i find odd and enjoyable. lemons and even kiwi fruit are coming from the hops, a very cool palate, before the wave of dark barley washes them clean. id like a little more body in this one, the flavors are great but the journey from a to b is too short. carbonation could also use a little kick up. overall though a very cool beer from new glarus. thanks to drlovemd87 for bringing this one back for me.","StonedTrippin","Jan 08, 2014"

A nice black ale with good hop character; not quite as toasty and dark malt as a Northwest style (CDA), but pleasant and well made for a black IPA.","LiquidAmber","Dec 15, 2013"

Smell is of roasted malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

I do not recall last time I had a black IPA so this will be my baseline comparison. Its one of those beers where I could have 2 or 3 in a single day - pretty sessionable.","Benish","May 31, 2013"

A thin, light tan head settles atop the brew while providing a solid amount of lacing. A rich bouquet of hop aromas entice the drinker to get a deeper whiff. Aromas include tropical fruits, pine resin, grapefruit, and orange zest play out over subtle hints of roasted malt and a touch of chocolate. On the palate the brew melds together a perfect balance of floral, citrus, and hop flavors over a wonderful caramel and chocolatey dark malt base. Superbly balanced, Black Top is well carbonated and features a silky medium body. Please ship to Colorado!","phishsihq","May 17, 2013"

The smell of the beer is aromatic, it's got a nice piney hop aroma blended with the roasted earthy malts and chocolate in there too. The taste is really balanced, it's got a hoppy flavor upfront with a chocolatey roasted aftertaste. It's not nearly as hoppy as some of the Black IPA's out there. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's rich and slightly creamy. The carbonation is really nice also. Overall this is a very good beer, high drinkability with a lot of flavor.

3.8,-7.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Another big thanks from 2BDChicago for the never ending Secret Santa haul. 12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 53 degrees. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, half inch, fizzy, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it dissipates into a consistent quarter inch froth. Swaths and spatters of lacing coat the walls of the class during the tasting. Nose expresses earthy/piny hops in the foreground and a suggestion of chocolate malt in the background. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a slightly metallic quality in the middle and the malt profile is very much subdued. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation that leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. There's also a little bit of acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. Overall, a pretty good representation of the style; however, I prefer something a bit more malt forward. Well worth your time if the opportunity presents and you tastes lean towards the hoppier end of the spectrum.","Jwale73","Jan 09, 2012"

Piney hops right in your face, but not enough to think you're going to drink Pine-Sol. Mouth watering. The hops are definitely up front on this one.

This beer is not that dark, not that hoppy and a little on the malty side but these standards are nearly unreachable. I prefer Lakefront brewing companys IBA to this but this is an excellent interpretation of a new style that my guidelines might be construed against. Still another great beer from Wisconsin!!!

The beer pours just about opaque, slight light still coming through...the head was thin, slightly off-white and is leaving a lacing. The smell includes pine, citrus, and chocolate. The taste provides hints of pine and slight bitter citrus. There are some tones of chocolate but not overly present. The mouthfeel is a good medium body with decent carbonation. Overall it is a very good beer. Besides being a great beer, other notable positives is that the abv is lower making this a decent session beer.

4.03,-1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - pretty solid brew by New Glarus. Really nicely balanced and chock full of flavor on both sides. Highly recommended as this is a side of NG I haven't seen before.","birchstick","Sep 29, 2011"
3.87,-5.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O. This is a solid, easy-to-drink offering from New Glarus. Tossing back a few in one evening wouldn't be a problem.","bound4er","Sep 29, 2011"
3.78,-7.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"overall, i find this a delicious beer, but isnt exactly within the style. I think I honestly prefer the moon man IPA offering from new glarus, but this is a nice change of pace.","crewfan16","Sep 28, 2011"
4.25,3.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D/O- If I were blindfolded the thought of this IPA being black would never have crossed my mind. Cheers to Dan and Co. for tackling a newer American beer style even if they're the (domestic) masters of classic German styles. Highly recommended.","Duff27","Sep 27, 2011"
4.04,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"NOTE: Even though the review score averages out to an A-, this is a B+ beer in my opinion","Jules11788","Sep 27, 2011"
4.45,8.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pretty good beer. Generally I don't care for dark hoppy brews, but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Poured a lovely, light tan, thick, foamy, billowy head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a very dark, clear garnet with some bubble trails (seen with a flashlight). Aroma is very hoppy with pine, citrus, and pineapple predominant along with malt. Flavor is similar to nose and I don't pick up much of the roastiness that I expected. Body is good and ditto carbonation. Finish is fairly long, ending with fresh hop. Good drinking beer.","drpimento","Sep 25, 2011"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, the hops dominate but there's enough balance to prevent the hops from burning you out. I expected more malt flavor since it's a dark IPA but it's more hops than anything. The hop profile is good, a balance of pine and citrus hops. Another very well done beer from New Glarus.","adman08","Sep 22, 2011"
4.33,5.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This was a very enjoyable beer and it's growing on me even more. I hope it hangs around.","Strix","Sep 22, 2011"
4.65,13.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"No trace of alcohol despite the nearly 7% abv. Easy to down more than a few of these, and well worth the trip to Wisconsin to pick some up.","matjack85","Sep 20, 2011"
3.88,-5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark mahogony brown. Beautiful colour. Lots of off-white frothy head. Smells very hoppy. Some roastiness peaking through. Definitely very drinkable. Body is a bit thin but low carbonation levels. Despite not being a huge Black IPA fan this was fairly tasty. Quite sessionable","Urbancaver","Sep 15, 2011"
4.17,2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O- very nice beer. Good work. Another hit from new galarus.","brew3crew","Sep 14, 2011"
3.8,-7.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Overall, although this beer largely lacks the deep roasted character of a black ale, and it isn't potently bitter like many IPAs today, it was still quite a pleasure to drink.","devilben02","Sep 13, 2011"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Thanks orbitalr0x for the bottle!","emerge077","Sep 12, 2011"
3.57,-12.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"O - very solid, very drinkable, while the hops melded fairly nicely with the roasted malt components there were a few flaws that kinda stuck out a bit too much for me to be completely sold on this one","johnkale","Sep 10, 2011"
4.32,5.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O) Wow.... Really enjoyed this beer. This is one more reason I am thankful to have New Glarus Brewing Co located in my neck of the woods.","RoamingGnome","Sep 09, 2011"
4.45,8.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This is a really good beer and like the best of New Glarus it's perfection is slowly revealed. Any doubts that the Black IPA style is a gimmick should be dis-splled by this brew. And, the other myth of this style being only done well by the West Coast brewers is shattered. Another big win for a championship team.","2BDChicago","Sep 08, 2011"
4.17,2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is another great, drinkable brew from New Glarus. It's nice that they ventured into this style, it is one of my favorites. This is not the best black IPA I've had, but certainly one of the most drinkable, something New Glarus always keeps in mind for the Wisconsin consumer. This brew could benefit by more of a coffee and roasted malt flavor profile.","iDrinknewglarus","Sep 08, 2011"
4.42,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"All in all, another unusual (in a good way) offering from NG. Good work, people. Keep it up.","joefeidt","Sep 08, 2011"
4.1,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Still a seemingly incongruous meeting of elements, these black ales. You dig it or you don't, although not all are created equal. This one is better than most.","Metalmonk","Sep 07, 2011"
4.5,10,4,4,5,4,4.5,"I'd heard great things about New Glarus before I moved to the midwest, and this beer did not disappoint. I've enjoyed this Black IPA above all others I've tried since the trend took off, mostly because the contrast of look/smell and taste is so pronounced. Looking forward to trying more New Glarus brews.","rwathree","Sep 06, 2011"
3.98,-2.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Better than a lot of beers of this style. The black is not just color but has some flavor.","morimech","Sep 06, 2011"
4.45,8.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"*EDIT* Just saw this beer won gold medal at GABF. Impressive considering how competitive the style category is this year, it looks like I'm not alone in thinking this beer is the epitome of the style.","Soneast","Sep 06, 2011"

4.12,0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is one of the top examples of the style that I have had. I think this is one of the most drinkable ones for the style as well. This is an absolutely well done ""American Black Ale"". The nose is killer and the overall beer is a real treat.","jera1350","Sep 02, 2011"
4.34,6.1,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Now, the thing that this beer does exceptionally well is in the nose. This is the first beer in a long long time that I can remember smelling so good from all the way across the room from my pint glass, the nose really carries that far! Heady scents of pineapple / mango, pine resin, and roasted malts as if from a porter mingle together in a combo that really makes me salivate for some reason. Tastes of all the things promised by the nose and also some interesting interplay between a sweet caramel malt tone that plays hide and seek with a roasted more bitter malt, finish is relatively straightforward bittering...overall a fantastically well-executed BIPA.","WastingFreetime","Sep 02, 2011"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I'm not too familiar with Black IPAs, but I did enjoy this beer quite a lot, and look forward to enjoying it and other Black Ales again.","bertram","Sep 01, 2011"
4.77,16.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall: I've had some top shelf beers in the last couple of days, but this is really standing out for me. I don't consider myself an IPA kind of guy, but this is everything that is right about IPA. As a matter of fact, I'm calling it a night as I feel I've reached the pinnacle.","anglagard1","Sep 01, 2011"
4.1,0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall I wouldn’t change a thing. It will be interesting to see if some time changes this beer. Fresh as it is now it is amazing.","dbtoe","Aug 31, 2011"
4.62,13,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is easily my favorite new brew of New Glarus since the Crack'd Wheat. I have enjoyed Two Women thus far, but I thought the Edel Pils was a much better example of a similar beer in the New Glarus stash of recipes.","dimensionQ","Aug 30, 2011"
3.37,-17.6,4,4.5,3,3.5,2.5,"It is still kind of jumbled but at least black ipas are evolving into something a bit more drinkable.","crossovert","Aug 29, 2011"
3.54,-13.4,4,5,3,3,3,"D - Very strange combination. The aroma seems like a completely different beer than the taste/mouthfeel. Everything great about the aroma just disappears.","brewcrew76","Aug 28, 2011"
2.87,-29.8,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"O- I tend to look at Cascadian Dark Ales as a full-flavored beer that blows your palate but you can only have one or two a night. I could probably drink 10 of these if i had to, but thats not really a good thing. Its pretty watery and lacking the robust flavor promised by the roasty, hoppy aroma. NG tends to make more approachable beers, which this is, but maybe not every style needs to be made approachable. I would say this is the first New Glarus beer i've had where they really dropped the ball. Its a Black IPA, but not a very good one.","znichols","Aug 28, 2011"
3.71,-9.3,3.5,5,3.5,3,3," ~ I fear the complexity that longer roasted malts should have offered to the brew is not here. At 6.9% I say it's out of the realm of sessionablity but it doesn't offer enough in the taste or feel characteristics to be something I would consider a good beer to sit down and really enjoy.","cdkrenz","Aug 26, 2011"
