"Overall- Interesting, as the cocoa flavor adds complexity for such a hoppy beer. IPA meets porter. A good sipping beer."

"Another very good beer from duck rabbit.  I wish this one was more common, hard to find outside of bottle shops, even in NC.  Would like to see this one on draft a little more often, Ive had it at festivals and would order this beer regularly.  Great hop lovers beer from the dark beer specialist."

"I might've entered my rating a little early, as this drink got better over time.  Right out of the fridge, the flavors seemed timid and not all that complex. As the beer warmed up, the foretaste seemed more and more ""stouty"" while the aftertaste developed a hoppier tone. Nice roasted malts up front. Smooth on the tongue. And very pleasant hops in the gullet. Don't confuse this with an Imperial Black but do give it a try... just let it sit a while before you make up your mind."

"Based on this beer's name, I was expecting, well, something a bit more hoppy.  That's OK though.  This beer was still nice to drink.  It reminded me more of a brown ale with some nice nutty notes."
""
"Played too much with my taste buds. Hoppy hoppy hoppy darky darky darky."
""
""
"Not really my style, so take it for what it's worth. It's a IPL all day, just happens to be black."
"It's just not my type. It taste like burnt malt mixed with water. I like duck-rabbit but this was just not one ill have again."
""
"Not a bad beer but one that favors the malts more than the hops."

"lovely dark brown (almost black) ale with hints of coffee/Chocolate in the smell and taste. another very good brew from Duck-Rabbit Brewery."

"Overall / Drinkability: American Black Ales are all over the place on style, and I've had some very hoppy American stouts cross over into this flavor range that I get with this. In fact, if someone hadn't told me this was an ABA, I would have thought it was a hoppy stout. All that being said, good appearance, flavor and mouthfeel with this beer and I could easily have another one although at that point I could kiss the rest of my evening away for any sort of productivity. Part of me wondered if the hops should have been stronger, and yet if they were too strong I think the two flavors of hops and malts would have been in conflict, so I think this one was just right, even if the two flavors were simple and deep in flavor. Sometimes too much complexity becomes a muddled mess - so the lack of complexity I think makes for a better beer. I'll have to revisit this beer sometime."

"O: Very yummy, though not completely my style of beer. Lots of flavors and an absolutely wonderful aroma (I think I'd rather smell it than drink it). The coffee flavor is welcome but a little overpowering. Wish it had more sweetness to it to fight the hops. Still, at least it's got character."
""
""
"Poured put nearly pitch-black. Hard to see any light getting through it. Massive foamy tan head forms almost immediately. Almost like a root beer float. Leaves big sticky lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of schwarzbier with just a slight extra hint of pine. The taste is equally similar with a nice earthy quality. There is a decent weight to the body and a nice crisp finish. A nice dark, lightly hopped ale."
""

""
""
"O: Duck rabbit does it again! A great brew, smooth and up to par with others in this style."
""

"Update: Tried this a second time in August of 2014 and noticed a discernible difference.  Both the nose and flavor profile were bolder than I remembered the first time.  The roast definitely outpaces the hops but the blend of the two is quite tasty.  An upgraded rating is warranted and was completed by me."
""
"True to its name, it's black with a small tan head that leaves only a bit of lace. It has a beautiful, smokey scent. Really nice and balanced."
""
"O: Yet another beer I really enjoy from Duck Rabbit. I was expecting this to be a bit hoppier just because of the name. But I love the balance in this beer and the roastiness I get from it. Perhaps the lesser hops are due to it being at the very end of its suggested lifespan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- if this is this good as it's nearing its shelf life, it must be awesome when it's fresh."
"Very good as a dark beer. The hoppy goodness is there, but not overpowering. Creamy mouthfeel is consistent with what I expect from a good dark beer. The bitterness is not overpowering, either. It is an interesting flavor closer to a stout than an IPA, but the best of each."

"D - An outstanding American Black Ale... It should also be noted that this one scores nicely in terms of the value proposition... There's a lot of very good things going on here for a rather economical price... Possibly my favorite Duck Rabbit offering... Just because they are the ""dark beer specialists," doesn't mean they don't know what to do with some hops... Kudos..."

"Poured on-tap at the Carolina Ale House in Fayetteville, the beer was served in a 22oz mug. The beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring with ruby highlights and a dense, creamy, foamy, light tan head. Nose of coffee and cream, earthy notes, and bitter, dry hops. Flavors are roast forward, with mocha notes throughout, creamy highlights, and a solid, dry, bitter backbone. Easy to drink. Light, smooth, crisp body. The aftertaste is coffee and cream again, with chocolate highlights. Smooth, clean finish. Not overly hopped, but very well balanced and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"O - more like a porter IMHO, but very nice offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a mouth full. At times the taste can be overwhelming but once it wears off you keep wanting to go back for some more. The beer is best ones it start to warm up. The taste won't be as bad. Its A little bit thick at the beginning but not quite a Guinness"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good. Isn't over the top hoppy like most in this style, which is nice."
""
""
""
"D) Hoppy Bunny is pretty decent overall. I could go for less of the tangy roast and more of the chocolate. It's rough around the edges and doesn't fully gel. Hoppy Hare would be a more appropriate name."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a very good take on this style, a little sweet or a touch too much roasted malt maybe, but good mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"a winner of an aba in my book, great focus on deep, dark roasted flavors with a pungent, dark hop side"
""
""
""
""
"O: not very hoppy and over carbonated."
""
""
"Overall, this is a reasonably drinkable beer. However, I must confess to being irritated by two things. One, the lack of hops in a beer called ""hoppy"" Bunny (I guess ""Malty"" Bunny wouldn't sell as well) Also, and this isn't just Duck Rabbit, I'm beginning to wonder if Black IPA's are worthwhile. There are certainly tons of better IPA's out there, and tons of better Porters/Stouts. If you want to combine the two, both elements need to come through. This just doesn't cut it. It's more of a porter/stout. Not unpleasant, just not as advertised."

" The taste seems like bittersweet cocoa with a nice caramel malt sweetness in the forefront and bitter dark grain flavors mid taste with slight herbal hoppiness near the end with more floral hop flavor rounding off the dark chocolate malt aspect. The overall enjoyment of this is good, but I am not exactly pleased with the hop level. I think for this brewery the focus is expected to be on dark malt however for this style and with a name like 'hoppy bunny' I expect more hop flavor and aroma, I would probably pass unless I was in the mood for a robust porter."

"O- I was actually a little apprehensive with this beer. The ABA style can be all over the board, ranging from hop bombs to near stouts in my experience. I was very happy with this presentation and its nice balance."
"O: This was delicious. wonderful chocolate and coffee with a bitter earthy hop. Nothing over powering, dare i say even sessionable. /88"
" Great smooth all around black ale. Worth seeking out for sure."

"The crispness I'd hope for is in this medium-bodied ale, but it's also got a very nice smoothness. A bit of an almost English-style tea-like quality leads into a drier finish that lingers softly."
""
""
""
"O: Good brew - nice combination of dark, roasted malts and bitter, grassy hops."
"OV: An interesting brew and I'm glad I got to try this one. Can't recall having something similar to this before. Some nice flavours in this beer, though I'd have liked the hops to have been more assertive as I think that would have really balanced this nicely. It's decent and worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall - A rather tasty ABA. It was actually a nice pairing upfront in the taste of the drier roasted flavors with the pine followed by another nice complementation of the grapefruit hop and chocolate toward the end of the taste. This was a rather tasty drink and is one to try."
"O: This beer seems a little maltier compared to other beers in the style and isn't hard to drink, especially if you aren't a big fan of very bitter beers."

"3.76/5.00"
"a great dark bitter ale. i'd love to try it fresh and see what the hop profile is like, but by no means can complain about it with a bit of age on it."
"Poured from my home keg with a nearly opaque color brown color and a thick beige head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a dull but varied mix of chocolate and herbal hops. The flavor is a bit more lively, with an earthy combination of hops and roasted malts. The light, resinous mouthfeel supports this flavor profile nicely. Overall, this beer is roasty and multi-dimensional without being too overbearing like I find many in this style to be, making it a flavorful selection that goes down easier than its alcohol percentage would suggest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice brew. As far as an ABA, it's very solid. Lots of flavor, hops and malts. Very drinkable, and easy to put away a few in a session. One that I will go back to for sure! I am glad the owner of my regular store turned me on to it!"
""
"Pitch black in color with a mocha colored head. The head fades pretty fast. Nice aroma that mixes between hoppy and smokey. The flavor is where this beer shines as it's delicious. Wonderful balance between smokey, coffee, and hoppy flavors. With none really dominate just a perfect balance that makes a delicioius beer. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Thick without being too thick. Easy to drink. This beer is delicious and I highly recommend it. Another fine beer from the dark beer specialist."
""
""
""
"This has an interesting smoky thing going on to it that I feel isn't usually there for the style, but I do like it. Consistent and thick flavor. Hops are here, but are accents and not hijacking the experience. Smooth drinker, but a sipper. Not too many new beers from Rabbit-Duck cross my path, so always nice to find a new one."
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable example of the American Black Ale style with a nice blend of roasty malts and bright hops. Easy to drink and hides the alcohol quite well."
"overall: dug this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque dark sable-brown with a fairly thick tan head that leaves some good lacing. Smoky, hoppy aroma has notes of roast malt and anchovies. Flavor has woody and smoky components plus a fishy hint and a bitter hoppy undertone. Smooth texture has about average body but good fizz and leaves a burnt-wood finish that has a hint of fish."
""
"O- I havent had too many black ales but this is the best i have had. Flavorful and not to hard to put back."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, some roasted malts. Taste is like the hops and roasted malts going toe to toe throwing haymakers, with the malts finally winning in the end. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, despite the somewhat high abv, this beer is extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"4, 3.5, 3, 4, 3.5"
""
""
"O: This is a superbly hopped American Black Ale with qualities resembling a lighter IPA but having a richer more lasting finish. Overall an excellent beer."
""
"A very tasty and enjoyable beer that is very complex and gets better as it warms. This was a really good beer and went down easy; plus, it threw a nice hop punch to add bitterness and balance to the roasted malts. The balance and complimentary flavors make this one to seek out as it was very well done."
""
"D - Kind of odd re,arrived to the emerging style profile for a black ipa, with a dark malt character that is out of proportion to the relatively modest hop flavors. Still, I can't help but like it, the dark malt is expertly handled and it does work well with the pine hop flavors that confine themselves to the background."
"Overall: Different for sure from other black IPAs I have had. The hops are well represented in the flavor without being overpowered by the strong coffee presence."
""
""
"Overall: a tasty and drinkable ABA. The style can be really hit-or-miss, but I think Duck-Rabbit has something here."
"Overall, this is a safer, saner take on the ABA than most I've had. I think I prefer this subtle, well-modulated (and sneaky : 7.3% ABV!) example of this hybrid style to the bigger, cruder examples that seem to hang out on the west coast."
"O: I used to hate this style, but as long as BIPAs continue to be made with this quality, I'll continue to explore."
"Overall pretty good, as usual not my fav style, nice malts, decent hops, and blend fairly well but just not a great style as too juxtaposed flavors."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice black color as the name of the beer advertised with a nice froffy brown head that dissipates slowly. Smells of coffee and flowery hops, very nice. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and some flowery hops, a nice combination. Medium bodied beer finishes well and has good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
"Overall enjoyable brew, tasty easy drinking beer."
""
"Not a beer to knock your socks off but beautifully crafted and rather tasty."
"I'd definitely order it on tap but not buy it again in a bottle. If I want a porter, I'll just buy a solid porter, maybe even Duck Rabbit's Porter. Nothing special or profound here."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Hops aren't really citrus or pine forward in this beer....just plain bitter. Couple that with the huge roasted flavors, and you have a bold & bitter brew. Luckily, I don't mind bitter, so this one is doable for me. Not the best example of a Black IPA, but not bad by any stretch."
"I didn’t know what to make of this at first, with the uniqueness of I believe Summit hops and a very brunt finish keeping me out of this but then as things started to warm and balance and more of that chocolate flavor started to emerge, this ended up evening out very nicely. This was solid and I’d definitely try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this isnt a badd black IPA, just a bit too harsh on the burnt malts for my liking."
"4.0 D: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I've had some pretty good ones as of late. I hope brewers keep impressing me."
""
""
"A well-made Black IPA. The malt pungency thrives in the nose but mellow out in the drink."
""
""
"Pretty enjoyable and flavorful beer, but if you're not a fan of hops, you're going to have a bad time. This is overwhelmingly hoppy, approaching American BW or Imperial IPA levels and, in some examples, passing it. Still, as hoppy beers have grown on me, I'd have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very good, heavier end of medium in body while having total full flavor. Great carbonation level. It's smooth with a surprisingly clean bitter finish. Duck-Rabbit does it again, but why should I be surprised."
"O- Fantastic stuff. I really appreciate the complexity of the hops and the quality of the malt bill. Highly recommended."
"Very nice beer!!!A bit high octane for mass swilling, but still an easy drinker."
""
""
"A magnificent ale from The Duck-Rabbit!"
"A lot going on here, dark and sludgy beer lovers go get some of this. For me its likely gonna be one and done"
""
"OVERALL: Being known as the Dark Beer Specialists, the Duck Rabbit Brewery proves once again its prowess with a fine black ale, some where between stout and IPA. It works here quite well, this is what the doctor ordered."
"Overall, a really solid ABA and one I would gladly pick up again. Duck Rabbit really makes some good beers."
"Really a pretty good beer. It's just a weird niche though. If I want hops, I'd rather have an IPA/DIPA/APA/whatever. If I want chocolate, I'll go with a stout or a porter."
""
""
"Very good Black IPA. After hearing reports that some batches of this were infected, I was a bit leery going in, but thankfully this one is good. Very hoppy, but also extremely roasty. Good stuff."
"A little less pine and a little more complexity from the hops would make this a winner. The malts are in the aroma but just can't fight through the huge pine bitterness."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and a little creamy. Carbonation is moderate. Very nice mouthfeel for the style. Overall, it was a good beer of the style. I thought the aroma brought out a little more hoppiness, where it felt a little overshadowed in the taste."
""
""
"D: This was a very hoppy black IPA. It looked great and had great body. The scent and taste were good but not great. The finish was a bit harsh, so it wasn't super easy to drink. Nice beer but not amazing."
""
""
""
"Dark black pour, seemingly opaque in the dim light, topped with a cap of dense tan head; nice retention and lacing. Battle of hops and malts in the aroma, the hops bringing in citrus and pine elements, with a defined dark chocolate roast on the malt side. The roasty malts come out first on the palate for sure, with a dark chocolate taste that is actually quite smooth and sweet; mid-palate bringing in grapefruit zest and orange blossom that mixed quite well with the chocolate malts; lesser notes of coffee and pumpernickel with a hint of indistinct spice. Medium body, and quite enjoyable overall. I'd get it again."
""
"M: A drain-pour - my first from DR. It's not enough to dissuade me from the beers though, I'll pick up another Hoppy Bunny next time I see one."
"Overall: It's bold without being disparagingly intense. A solid ABA."
""
""
"This should be a benchmark for this style."
"D: i would imagine a fresher example would be much more tasty, especially considering the promising start on the nose. please pass on any bottles you may see still out there and wait for another batch!"
"Paul, you did not make it up to Philly Beer Week this year. It's all good, keep sending your beer up, it will make up for it."
""
"I didnt think this was a very good effort. Perhaps something went slightly wrong in the ferment, or maybe this was supposed to be tangy; either way, not a fan."
""
"The dark beer folk at duck rabbit have hit another one WAY OUT THE PARK!!! Bravo Paul and everyone at the brewery. Please make more and send 1 state south to the super cool cats at greens piney grove rd. FANTASTIC BREW!!!"
""
""
""
"O - A very solid prototypical black IPA, nothing super special about this one but it does what it does as well as any black IPA that I have had the pleasure of indulging in"
""
""
""
""
"Really lovin' the black ales, this is a great one. Great sessionable case worthy brew here with a nice ABV."
"Picked up a single at Chip's in OBX. It poured like a porter a near-black bodyand tan head. The citrus hops are well-balanced against the cocoa-tinged roasted barley. This is a smooth, medium bodied beer that could pass as an American stout or porter. It's plenty hoppy, but there isn't a clean upfront blast of hop oils to separate this beer from the other dark ales."
""
"Easily over two fingers of dark brown foam, good mixture of bubble sizes which causes some dimpling, takes some time sizzling down to the surface, solid ring of lacing around most of the glass, tenacious grip. The liquid is black and opaque but not quite so dense that you can’t see the tiny bubbles rise, thin ring of orange at the glass bottom. Real roasty, toasty nose of cocoa powder, ground coffee, vanilla bean, oats and unprocessed grains, the interplay between malts and the hoppier pine, white citrus notes quite pleasing, really stiffens in your nostrils without seeming heavy, very longlasting. Medium-bodied plus, carbonation at first gives it a fluffy mouth feel, however, overall dryness wins out. Licorice, more of that mocha to cocoa powder and roasted coffee, nutty at turns. The orange to grapefruit citrus has a harder time finding its voice here. More floral than grassy, hops add more texture than flavor. Minor notes of peach, cherry, black grape fruit. Smoky like a wood grill. There’s a lot of energy here which may now and then mask some of its complexity. Real intense, need a glass of water to rinse the flavors out."
""
""
"Dark dark color black in the low light at taco mac woodstock creamy dark tan head that has been holding for awhile now. Smell is dark roast chocolate n hops ok lets dive in. The dark roast burnt flavors on the nose really shine through here. Creamy mouthfeel with hop bitterness left on the tongue. Hops arent as much in the taste as on the tongue. Overall a very nice black pale ale."
""
"To the left of mid bodied, carbonation is just right to keep it drinking very well. Nice balanced black ipa. Would guess this is even better on draft. Don't hesitate to give it a try."
""
"This is a decent black IPA. I think there could be a more refined balance between the rich, chocolate, roasty malt character and the citrusy hop character. It does have good drinkability and good flavor. Ultimately, it's another solid offering from Duck Rabbit."
""
"Overall not bad, enjoyable brew, sort of what I expect from Duck Rabbit, nothing mind bending or exceptional but I could have another easily."
"Overall: I expected to like this beer and I do; I think it has a lot going for it; I might tinker with the hop profile a bit to make it a bit more West Coast in style but it is darn close as it is"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 08/12 notched on the side. Pours a deep black with an inch-thick mocha head. Nose is sharp with pine needles, mild citrus, and a semi-sweet roasted char. Smooth hefty body. Creamy finish. The hops in this one add a pleasant bitterness, but they fall a bit short on the flavor. They taste muted and lacking in juicy freshness. The roasted aspect comes forward more, adding a warming coffee-like finish. This is a good beer, but not my favorite of the style for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): I’d like the different pieces of this beer to be a little more well-defined and less shout-y, but there’s no question that this is a solid brew. It borders on astringent at times, but it definitely benefits from warming up a bit. Not the kind of beer you’d hand to a first-timer ☺"
""
""
""
""
""
"Black with a line of chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass and a hefty, persistent tan head of foam. Fresh hoppy aromas over a nice roasty base of dark malt. Lime, grass, pine, chocolate, and coffee along with a slight buttery note that actually somehow seems to tie the malts and hops together. While I would say the aroma is ever-so-slightly hop-forward, the flavor is certainly more aggressive with the roasted malts. That's not to say the hops aren't there - they are - but in a more leafy/earthy/oily sort of way, leaving a trail of bitterness behind. The roast and bitter qualities make for a pretty astringent beer. Chocolate, light smoke, pine resin, fruit. I wish the malty flavors cut through the brashness a little more, but maybe it will all smooth out with future batches. Hoppier as it warms. Medium bodied and actually quite smooth and almost chewy before assaulting the palate. I'll be getting this again."
""
""
"Recommend Hoppy Bunny for anyone wanting to venture into Black IPAs."
"The beer pours a dark black with no head. The smell is a roasted marsmallow and the taste follows with a lot more bitterness and roastiness. Very tasty BIPA with a lot more roast than expected. The bitter aftertaste lingers and is slightly drying. This beer is definitely worth trying and will cover your hop fix & your roasty dark ale fix as well."
""
""
""
"The aroma is spectacular. I just think it needs a little more heaviness on the malt for how much bitterness and floral hop flavor hits your tongue. I just think for a roasty beer to have this much in-your-face hop presence, you need to go higher gravity with it, and this is coming from somebody who differs greatly from the bigger-the-better BA mentality."
"Great to see a new DR offering.Poured jet black with a thick creamy beige head that left multiple broken rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Sharp piney,earthy hops mixed with bitter chocolate and roast in the nose.Light smoke,earth, and roast at the onset with lightly sweet chocolate melding into a rush of prickly,piney hops that linger nicely.A damn fine ABA easily one of the better ones I have had,well done Duck Rabbit."

"o - overall, duck rabbit is a brewery that hardly disappoints and this venture into black ale territory is no dissapointment either, but far from the highlight of their catalog or the style. definitely worthy if you are into the style, go for the 6'er...if you are unsure on the style, go for a single, but you'll likely be back for more. a bit dark for the warmer weather, but a nice blend of roast and hops."
"O: really like this beer. Hope they make more of it. Probably the best fitting ""black ipa", super dark really hoppy. Try it'"
""
"Now this flavor is unique for sure. Bitterness from the malt and hops. bitter roasted coffee, dark bakers chocolate, and alpha acids. Medicinal sort of flavor is the only real knock here. Black roasted malts underly what is really a pine heads dream. Its all really balanced and smooth (surprisngly)."
""
"O: excellent and highly drinkable."
