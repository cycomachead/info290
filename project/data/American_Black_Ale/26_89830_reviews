"On tap at FFF brewpup. Pours dark brown with thin tan head. Aroma of prunes/dates, tobacco, roasted hops. Similar flavors with hints of grapefruit citrus."

"I do enjoy a good hoppy beer from FFF, but they've always been good at choosing their malts carefully, and this is perfect example that showcases that. While the citrus, pine-y notes are more faded in this bottle, it makes up for it with the rich, roasted delicious cocoa-barley flavor. Hope to have this fresh sometime again, because this was definitely enjoyable."

"Damn tasty black IPA that easily tops some of the more highly rated 3 Floyds offerings. Somewhat mellow taste for it's ABV, a nice dark color and mild aroma. Good finish that leaves a slightly hop forward taste in your mouth. A nice choice for someone looking for a cross between a stout and an IPA."
" Overall really enjoyable with nice balance."
"O: An interesting beer. (im guessing here) The chicory coffee used in the beer (if there is) is adding a character to the roast and mouth feel that doesn't make it very drinkable. It opens up at warmer temperatures and boarderlines on a stout, which (in my opinion) would have been a beter style for this beer. Overall. meh"

"overall this one wasnt my favorite. not bad, but if this was the first 3F beer i tasted i wouldnt be impressed by the brewery. luckily they make some much better brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good. I like the orange in the aroma and the pine/herb blends well with the malt flavors."
"Overall: A bit too much rye, but this was saved by the wonderful sweet pineapple in the trailing finish. I like the band that they did this collaboration with, an it is a super cool bottle. Glad I was able to try it!"
""

"O: Solid, enjoyable/easy to drink but I expected the flavors to be a bit bolder. That being said it's still a fine beer and one I'd easily recommend"
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and flavoring. While many Black IPAs/ales tend to overdo it with the bitterness of roast and overly hoppy bite, this guy strikes a tender balance between the inherent sweetness of the roasty, chocolatey, porter-esque malt base, with the fruity, citric, and floral hoppy balance of your sweeter east-coast IPA. This makes for a pleasing, highly inviting beer on all accounts. The ingredients are full flavor and never really cheapen, giving richness and robustness throughout. This is one of the best, most balanced weâ€™ve had for the style in a long time, and it, again, truly speaks to the diversity of the brewery in drive, intensity, and execution."
""
"Malt is forward and the best part of this brew. Hops are mostly bittering on the finish and there is also a decent amount of alcohol."
""
""
"Overall a nice example for the style. It been a while since I had an actual hoppy black ipa."
""

"Trade from BrewMane. thanks! Pours dark brown with some ruby with a tan one finger head that stays with it. Big sweet dry hop aroma with floral bots and definite citrus and pine. Some roasted malt in the backbone but smelling hop forward. Flavor is big bitter pine up front with a bit of spiciness and lots of toasty malt backbone. A nicely balanced brew. Medium mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. Dry finish. One of the better black ipa's for sure."

"This beer really surprised me. Malty, very smooth, very similar to Topless Wytch. Very, very drinkable. Honestly, I could have drink the entire 22 oz'er in 20 seconds! The sad part about a beer like this is that everyone will not be able to try it. The beer gods of Munster have struck again and it is good!!!"
""
"Sampled on tap at the brewery. A deep brown with some light passing through and a creamy beige head. Less hops than I expected for FFF. More balance. The hops are there with flavor and bitterness. But they're offset but malts with a nutty and biscuit push (nothing remotely roasted). Interesting brew."
""
""
""
"O-A decent black ale, was expecting a more hop forward beer from FFF though."
""
"o: I do find similarities with this and Toxic Revolution but I think the latter is a much more solid overall beer. This one is a decent Black IPA but there are others I'd seek out first (e.g., Wookey Jack). Glad I tried this but not one I'd seek again if it were to be brewed again."
""
"It was a good but not great black ale slash black ipa."

"Thanks again to Al for sending this one out. The birthday week is coming to a close shortly but this was another nice addition to the agenda and definitely hits the spot tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishing the night off with a strong black IPA from the Floyds. And it's not Toxic Revolution. Shots fired. Anyway, this stuff pours a dark black-sienna topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises heavy leek, light roasted malts, and some light pine resin. The taste brings in more of the same, but luckily the roast o'erpowers the leek character, though not enough to rid the world of it entirely. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I guess this could've been a nice black IPA had it been brewed with different hops, but the leek here just ruins things for me."

"As I drink the lacing is just gorgeous. First impression is that of smoothness with a lot of great hop flavor without much of the bitter crunch. (Possibly due to me holding on to it in the fridge for almost a month) Sits heavy on the tongue as the taste continues and the roasted caramels really come out. There are even some coffee notes. Overall though, still tastes pretty much like you'd expect an IPA to taste like - just with a dark twist that makes it super interesting, yet still very satisfying."
""
"The palate feels resiny, somewhat dry, but also a little oily. Pretty good Black ale, but not something I'd want to drink regularly."
""
"O: A decent beer. Certainly not the greatest, but a different take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Unlike most other FFF IPAs, the hops are subdued in this beer, and the roast/chocolate character overshadows them. More akin to a hoppy porter."
""
""

""

"Pours a cola brown with tan head. Plenty of head retention, perhaps a bit lighter than some of the other black IPAs. The nose is heavy on citrus hops with notes of grapefruit and bright pineapple tones. If I were blindfolded, I would never be able to tell that this IPA is dark. The taste features the deeper malt profile that I expect in the style, but almost no roast is present. Fruity hops dominate with some resinous undertones and mellow bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat light with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, I don't know what the dark malts contribute to this beer, but it is tasty nonetheless."
"O - this beer is very similar to FFF Toxic Revolution Stout which I drank right before this. It's slightly more hoppy and less roasty/malty with a thinner body. I prefer Toxic Revolution to this by a small margin. This is very similar to Firestone Wookey Jack and the same style, but I prefer the taste of this and I swear I'm not a homer rater nor do I have a stiffy for FFF. Nice beer!"
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer that I would not pass on in the future. It is by no means a rock star, but something I would gladly drink again. Good, solid beer, but I prefer Hop Heathen."
""
""
""
"O - Well made with the right notes and an easy drinker at that."
"Was very excited about trying this one being a fan of Eyehategod! This brew here is an easy drinker. Like most black IPA's, it's not very heavy at all. Very smooth. If I had to compare it to another Three Floyd's beer, it would be the Toxic Revolution. After pouring, I saw that it was dark brown in color with a burnt brown, thin head. Tasted kind of woody to me, kind of like a light porter or something..."
""
""
""
"A well made black ale. The roast and pine notes dominate as expected for the style but with the welcome addition of some tropical fruits. It drinks smooth and I had no problems finishing the bomber in one sitting."

"brew poured a watery black with a grey foamy head that left chunky lacing. smells of dank sticky hops with solid roasted malts. nice citric notes. taste is big and bold leading with roast and then slamming you with the bitterish hops. fairly dank and pine cone, but the roast really changes the character of an ipa. the body is nice and smooth with good carbonation. things are really in balance. this is a style that i'm not wild about, but if more of the black ipas were like this i'd probably speak differently of the style. i really found this one to be quite good."

"This is a pretty solid Black IPA. There is great balance and tremendous drinkability. The hops are intense and the flavor profile really hits a good range. I actually thought the herbal character meshed best with the malt character. The malts were also prevalent, but very well balanced. This was a decent Black IPA that is definitely worth checking out."
""
""
"Overall - Tough to pull off this style. Pine hops aren't the way to go, but its a decent take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Well this is well-made and to style, it's not really what I look for from a Black IPA. The combination of hop and roast bitterness gets fatiguing and lacks balancing sweetness. Alcohol is well-hidden, and the smokiness paired nicely with the stuffed peppers we made. Might order again as a change of pace, but only in a small portion size."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite FFF beer but I do enjoy this style in general so this was up my alley. I probably will end up liking this more than most. Even though I describe the hop profile as subdued I find it to be adequate for the beer as I continue to enjoy this bottle."
""
"The taste is pretty much the scent. It's almost like a combination of Alpha King and Topless Wytch. Deep roasted taste but the brightness of the hops come through. The carbonation is on point as is the viscosity. This would be a better bomber to share as I was done for the night after this one just because my mouth was on flavor overload. The alcohol is well hidden due to the all the battling flavors. I would seek this out to try. It's very different than many Black IPAs I've had. The roast is deeper, and the hop character is distinctly 3 Floyd's."

"Overall- Best Black IPA to date perfect example of a solid beer from the FFF"

"D - Unexpectedly balanced. Normally I'm all for that, but in this instance it's balanced because nothing stands out in the taste. The aroma was significantly more complex and interesting. Would grab Wookey Jack before I'd try this one again."

"This is a real style blur, I am not that drawn to it, but it's kind of interesting."
"It's an incredibly bitter beer from both hops and char. More floral character and an even drier malt texture could really propell this thing into orbit!"
""
""
""
"O - Roasted malt with a hoppy background. Mild Beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent - no particular flaws but nothing outstanding. I had higher hopes for this beer from this brewery...but only mildly disappointed."
""

"O - wasn't super impressed with flavor. was hoping for more hoppiness. alcohol comes thru more than expected. Three Floyds has many much better products. I would pass on this brew."
""
"O- A great black IPA, and it could be stellar if it wasn't so ridiculously bitter. Still on par with wookey jack."
""
""
""
""
"O - A great black IPA from FFF that brings lots of different hop flavors together with the fruity and the bitter pine / grapefruit. It is well balanced between the two and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Another great IPA from FFF."
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle purchased fresh from the brewery poured into a tulip. Color is translucent black with a finger of beige head. Smell is malty and boozy with lots of hoppiness, hops dominate the taste but not in a bad way. Nice mouthfeel once some of the carbonation has had a chance to settle. Enjoyed this one."
""
"Overall - Another winner from FFF. If you like their IPAs, you will probably like this. Hits hard at 7.1% ABV. A nice change up from the usual IPAs. This is more of a 'once in a while' beer for me."
""
"Thanks to mjmadsen21 for sending this one. The beer poured out as a nice deep brown color. The retention is thin but the lacing is pretty sticky. The smell of the beer is a little earthy, a bit roasted and hoppy. There also seems to be a slight amount of spice on the nose too. The taste of the beer is a lot like the nose, there is a touch of chocolate in there along with the subtle spice note. The mouthfeel is pretty sharp, but goes down pretty easy. Overall it's a pretty solid black IPA, not the best but I was really glad I got to try this one."
""

"Pours a hazy brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but has a better smell in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall: Falls into the same problems that most black IPA's do - the malt and the hops just don't complement each other well. Smell's fantastic, but it's fairly average after that."
""
""
"O - This was an okay black IPA. For FFF it was surprisingly lacking in the hops department. Good body and mouthfeel but a bit lacking in the hops department. i was hoping for more hop aroma and more taste. It does have a nice dry finish though. A decent black IPA"
""
""
""
"the appearance is brown . it smells light, alittle carmel and hops. alittle nutty. the taste threw me off with a nice fruity nutty mix with alittle somthing else. it is a good beer. Three floyds hasnt had anything i didnt like so far. I dont know what they do"
"O - Haven't had many Black IPA's so not sure how to compare to the style. The lack of aroma was a bit unusual considering the taste profile. Picked up a bottle to try at a warmer temperature, served very cold at the Brewery."
