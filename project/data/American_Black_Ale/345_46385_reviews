"O: Delicious, unique brew with lots to love on. Unique style unto its own. Beatiful, tasteful, great name, great bottle great company. Would go well with hot wings."

"O: I'd prefer tangerine, mango, fresh orange, pineapple, papaya, passionfruit, tropical fruit, etc. mixed with the roasty flavors, but this is still a great beer. I'd definitely recommend it, if you like the black ale style."

"Pours black with a thick and creamy off white head that has excellent retention and lacing. The nose has lots of pine and citrus notes from the hops. And the grain bill offers burned caramel and milk chocolate, there's toffee and roasty notes too. The taste is much like the aroma with pine trees and caramel and chocolate. There's a huge resiny bitterness that lingers long into the finish. Silky and creamy body with a noticable hot alcohol that could be hidden a lot more.overall, this beer is pretty decent. Not really impressed though."

"O: Great interplay from both malt and hops, and a modest complexity offered by both. This beer boasts a very unique flavor profile. I also would never have guessed that this fella clocked in at 8.7% abv. A solid American Black Ale."

"Watch out for it's abv though, can't quite tell."
"From my tasting notes: the Yakima Glory poured a deep ruby brown with a full tan head and loads of hops on the nose. Below the hops there was a hint of sweet malt that subdued the hoppy aroma. The taste was a front load of big juicy hops that faded into a bitter burnt chocolate and sweet toasted malts. The two flavors played well with each other and brought out the shining attributes of each while not allowing the other to take over. There was loads of flavor and lots of dynamic tastes to be had. A delicious beer with plenty of flavor to spare."

"Medium body, strong effervescence up front. Drying from the start. A really nice beer."
"Overall 3.75: Excellent tasting beer, but there are some problems here and there with this beer's overall presentation. However, regardless of some cosmetic issues (*ahem!*), this is a fine brew. Actually, it reminds me very much of Northern Brewer's ""Black IPA"" homebrew recipe that I brewed once. Big, malty middle and lots of excellent hop blending. Makes me wonder who influenced who. Long story short, I recommend this beer on its taste alone."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It was okay. I didn't enjoy it much but thats my dumbass fault for buying a beer that pays tribute to a place that produces a lot of hops when I don't like ym beers to be supper hoppy."

"Poured into becker pint glass; dark brown with a big fluffy tan head that leaves tons of lacing as it dissipates about halfway to sit as a thick disc of foam. Smell is a nice mix of fruity and piney hops, and dark chocolate malts. Taste is absolutely delicious; the mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and full, with chocolate dark malts moving seamlessly into juicy fruity hops. It finishes sweet and bitter at the same time, and sticky. Awesome."

"O - Second time having this beer. This isn't much of a summer beer but i remember sipping this during Christmas Eve one year and thats when craft beer became a passion instead of a hobby. Not to sure that this beer tops by 10 but this beer will always be remembers because of how it turned me into craft beer."

"Taste starts with suprising but welcome citric hops (didn't get much smell of these) which are quickly overtaken by roasty malts with bitterness, chocolate, and tobacco, has a bitter, roasty, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light with moderate carbonation for a black IPA."

"Is a surprising first sip - big hops - not overwhelmingly bitter, or stingingly astringent necessarily - but spicy and fruity. You know it's Victory immediately. Afterward, as it starts to warm up, you get a malty backbone strong enough to hang those juicy hops on; they're almost bitter orange & linger on the exit. It's just the slightest bit toward the heavy side; it's too hefty to be ""sessionable," it'd do you well to savor it."
""
""
""
"Very tasty. A bit unusual for a black ale/black IPA but worth trying for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Really good stuff. It's like a flavour explosion when you take your first sip. A nice mix of flavours and a good balance of east and west coast flavours. ABA's are one of my favourite styles, and I'd drink this again any time."
""
"Pours a hazy super dark orange-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, citrus zest, and some spicy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor that lingers on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- This is a great winter beer. Enough bittering hops to balance out the initial sweetness of the malt. This is a solid east coast dark IPA, not to be confused with a NW CDA"

"O- I really dislike it when breweries put hops upon hops in their beers. Hops does not make your beer good. There's so much more to a beer and it annoys me when the only attribute I can really describe is the hop, and the hops used in this beer are very simple and have no complexity to them at all."
""
"Tobacco, burnt, bitter rye bread notes. Victory american hops big time. Very hoppy profile. Spicy in the finish. Slightly herbal hidden behind the big malt and hop flavors. Big full body. One of the best black ipas in my opinion. Most of them are crap these days."

"O: Love this beer – super hoppy but balanced well by the malt - and enough alcohol to make it interesting."
""
""
"O: Call it what you want (Dark IPA, American Black Ale, Cascadian Dark) this is a great combination of the right malts with the right hops. Great by itself, or with some hearty food."
"overall - I liked it but a little too hop filled for me. IMO, appearance is the best thing about this beer, it looks great and you get lacing all the way down the glass and a huge head out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite black IPA's, even if it doesn't hit you over the head with hops. A delicious beer that I look forward to every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"About mid body, mid-high level of carb. Drinks easy enough, pretty dry. A fine beer, just mis-classified."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really great example of an American Black Ale. Great, unique, malt character and wonderful interaction between malt and hops. I really need to get some more of this this winter."
""
""
""
"O- This is a very interesting beer that I enjoyed and would certainly have again. I like the combination of bitter hop and malt flavors. Also enjoyed the high ABV% that was hardly noticeable. Could definitely have a few of these and enjoy a nice little buzz."
""
""
""
"O: An enjoyable black IPA. I'm glad I finally gave this brew a shot."

"Attractive deep russet hue, topped by a respectable ecru head that lingers a bit. Unexceptional but perfectly good malty aroma. Nice, toasty flavor, brings in elements of cocoa and dates, followed up by a little hoppy volatility. Texture nearly creamy. While not a chart-topper, worthy of becoming a staple."
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown with a light tan head that provides some lacing, but eventually falls flat while drinking. The nose is piney/hoppy with a slight bite from the alcohol and a touch of sweetness. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced in the beer's nose. When tasting the beer I'm a bit surprised as it lacks the roastiness I was expecting based on the beer's appearance and nose. It has a lot more resiny bitterness than I'd expected and a touch of caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is mild-medium bodied with a bit of caramel and a pronounced, residual, hoppy/bitter punch to the palate. Overall I'm not too impressed and think a bit more citrus/fruity/floral hops would go a long way with making this beer significantly better."
"O- Hearty and tasty, a perfectly drinkable fit for the season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe I just don't like American Black Ales - not sure. I felt like the strongly bitter hops were not balanced at all by the burnt, roasted malt. For comparison, I think Victory Hop Devil has similar hops in it, but I enjoyed that much more than this."

"Personal Rate: 4.25"

"The pour was a dark brown, a little haze, two fingers worth of creamy head that clung nicely and persisted. Aroma was hops and the malts, definite roasted notes, not much citrus on the nose. First taste was overwhelming bitterness, but the sweetness from the malts kicked in to balance that out nicely. On the aftertaste, the citrus comes to the party with a nice grapefruit bitterness. Carbonation was low, a little warmth at the end and some longing syrupy sweetness. Thought it enjoyable, nicely balanced, would have again."
""
""
""
"O/D-I was expecting a much darker beer here. It was at times a pleasantly surprising experience. During other sips, it wasn't as enjoyable. This is a sipper due to the bitterness and alcohol. I enjoyed it, but I can see two or three of the bottles from my six-pack hanging around in the fridge for a longer period than other beers."
"O: Not the greatest ""black IPA."" The distinct flavors don't mesh as well as they do in the very best examples of the style. The result is a little harsher than it should be."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, great to have during a cold winter night. The hops are what make the beer but they wouldn't be anything without the huge malt backbone. Something to look forward to every winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent. One of my favorites of the style."
"Taste is heavy on the bready malts, and frankly a bit boozy, more than I would like, but It is 8.7. taste smooths out a bit as it warms up. reminds me of a chewy pumpernickel. This one has characteristics of Belgian dark ales and dopplebocks. certainly Complex, but lacks a certain cohesiveness to hold it all together."
"O: I think this truly stays to the style of ABA/Black IPA as originally intended. Most beers of this style end up being IPA's that have some roasted malt thrown in. Not this one. The hops complement the malt flavors but not overpower or take center stage, which I really enjoy. This is top quality stuff and met my high expectations as I have been waiting to drink this beer for nearly a year after just missing last years release. With the high ABV, you also feel pretty good at the end of a 12oz. bottle. Well done, Victory!"
""
""
"O: A more than solid ABA. Surprisingly (very) hoppy with just enough roasted malts to make this one a black ale. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of the style and can find it fresh"

"Pours a dark brown-tinged red with one finger thick khaki colored head. Settles quickly to a thin ring, leaving a few splotches of lace behind. Smell: lots of pine, slightly herbal, then plum skin, light caramel sweetness and toasted bread with faint char as it warms. Taste: pine with mild caramel and plum-ish sweetness upfront, then exclusively a butt-ton of pine, plus a little booze. Some citrus rind and tannin-ness in the finish. Medium+ bodied with creamy carbonation into prickly, relentless pine and booze bombardment, finishing dry with some residual sugar stickiness. I'm not a fan of this hop profile when dialed up this high, but as a seasonal is a nice change of pace to mix in."

"Sampled at Gainesville House of Beer. Solid black ale. Nice hop presence with a sweet aroma, a sort of blend of chocolates and pine needles. Good hop bite with a complex black currant flavor, some good roast, but the two are melded rather well in this one. One of the better Black IPAs out there, and I have mixed feelings on the style. This one is definitely worth drinking."

"Pours a dark ruby amber color with a thin tan head. Poor retention and minimal lacing. Smells very strongly of earth and pine hop notes, slight grass. There's also a faint caramel component to the aroma. Taste is sweet up front, fading to an alcoholic flavor, and finishing with a long lasting bitterness. Sweetness reminds me of dark fruits, cherries and plums. Bitterness is very pine like and has resin like qualities to it. Medium carbonation, full bodied, with a rather thick, resiny mouthfeel to it. Overall, very interesting beer. Well done, however not necessarily a classic example stylistically. I'm definitely glad I tried it."

"This isn't really an ale that is overly showy or carrying a wide character. But it's consistent and full in flavor. I like it."

"Pours a dark brown with a solid sheet of toasted cracker foam, the ale is surprisingly translucent. Lots of pine and resin in the nose with a bit of spruce character; the malts are toasted and like a brown ale: some tea character, a touch of spice and rye bread. Flavor is toasted malts, refined and soft bitterness and plenty of pine flavor. The malts are slightly spicy and a bit dry. Thin body with hi carb and a slick finish. This beer was worth trying, not sure I'd seek it out often."

"Mouthfeel- Hoppy resin, leaving a sappy mouth a nice malt sweetness cleaning the palate and leaving a dry, lingering bitterness in the mouth."
""
"Paired this with some rosemary chicken and stuffing for a delicious dinner."
""
""
""
"Can't wait until November when it comes back."
""
"Overall – A tasty IPA with a wonderful roasty and hoppy flavor. It is relaxing with its slight alcohol booziness and roasty flavors, yet exciting at the same time due to its nice hop presence. Quite a good brew for either or."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby -chestnut coloring with a decent, thick, foamy, beige colored head of a solid inch. Decent head retention with great cling as you drink. Aromas of rich, roasted caramel balanced with wet, spicy hops. Some earthy and woody aromas blend in, also. Flavors are malty on the forward tongue, with resiny and bitter hops attaching to the mid and rear tongue once the sweet caramel and toffee lightens from its initial showing. Hops are peppery spiced, as well, and the malt backbone has some smokey and roasted qualities that highlight throughout. The aftertaste is slightly cloying sweet, but balanced well with a deep bitterness. The finish is rich and bitter, with a slight drying in the mouth. Decent brew, both tasty and unique. A little heavy to drink in quantity, but a good strong one to enjoy at leisure."
""
""
""
""
"O - It looks lighter colored than any beer that I have had in this style, but the taste is there. It has more of a mellow hops presence than others, but it was a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another likeable beer from Victory. I'd get this again."
""
""
"Overall Impression- Very nicely done by Victory but almost a dull Black IPA in my books... Nonetheless, its still an above average brew and wondering who else besides Schlafly and Victory who brews their own ""Yakima"" brand labeled beer? Good stuff."
""
"Very hop forward flavors...caramel, amber like toffee. Something I cant really put my finger on here...I think its the caramel-like malts mixed with the intense hop and some citrus. Its pretty bitter. I would think it would balance with the darker malts, but its still pretty bitter. Overall, a good brew. Its not the almost 9% that keeps you from really drinking this brew, for me its the off-bitterness. Otherwise, nice unique brew and work a try."

"Overall – A tasty IPA with a wonderful roasty and hoppy flavor. It is relaxing with its slight alcohol booziness and roasty flavors, yet exciting at the same time due to its nice hop presence. Quite a good brew for either or."
""

"Overall impression: More like an American Brown Ale than an American Black Ale but it's all good. Probably won't have it again but glad I tried it once."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There's definitely an off flavor that I can't put my finger on, but besides that I think it's really great. It's really bitter but you actually don't get a ton of clean hop flavors. So the malt notes really take the floor."
""
""
"O: I hesitated opening this beer on a warm summer evening after a long workout. However, it was surprisingly refreshing. I wish more beers were this balanced and refined. Will definitely purchase again."
"O - Really 4.125. Drank this on an unseasonably cool June evening, half a world away from my loved one. It's a comfort beer, the ideal beverage for someone separated by business or other unwanted necessity from his/her partner. Yakima Glory is warm - evocative of winter, fireplaces, and a pleasantly light touch of loneliness and melancholy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Big malt character and herbal hop presence in this complex black ale. Great winter comfort beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- Usually my complaint on black IPAs is that the malt doesn't add enough to the IPA dimension. In this case the hops were clearly muted, and what was left didn't have much taste. Disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A good beer but like most Black IPAs the balance between the roasted malt and the hops is not where it should be."
"D - Damn good. I will have again for sure. I'm thrilled to still have two left from the six pack after this one. I'd say american black ale isn't really the style though. IPA is more like."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 11/30/2012. Pours cloudy dark reddish brown color, with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, pine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, herbal, toasted malt, and a touch of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas that are very citrus hop forward. Taste of big chocolate, pine, grapefruit, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, herbal, orange peel, and a touch of coffee. Nice sized bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, pine, citrus, biscuit, roasted malt, and caramel on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop bitterness to roasted malt sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a very nice black IPA. It has a nice roasted malt backbone, which I enjoy seeing in the style; and is very enjoyable to sip on."
"Overall a brew that settled rather nicely on the taste buds, with a good mix of flavors which virtually hides most of the high ABV..."

"Review from 1/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a very dark red amber. Faint head, but a bit of lacing. Hops and citrus aroma. Nice spicy hops up front, with some citrus and light malts. Pleasant resiny, hoppy bitter finish. Quite a few flavor changes throughout the taste. A fairly complex, interesting hop forward ale. Apparently a renamed Yakima Twilight."
""
"Flavor is a bit of sweet malt and caramel rolls to some pine tree and grass. Finishes very dry with a the slightly astringent bite and also a bit of peppery booze. A nice sipping beer without a lot of complexity. The smooth texture and fairly well hidden booze make it easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer, nothing I would go out of my way to get though."
"O- This beer has not been on my top list of beers as far as hops, I am not a person to buy or consume a more hoppy floral beer, I like the more malt floral beer. But all in all it is a beer that i could enjoy again on a summer day."
""
""
""

""

"This is quite nice. Victory did well with this one, not surprisingly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good interpretation of a black ale. Definitely worth a try and comes recommended."
"Mouthfeel is rich but with a crisp hops ""bite"" at the end. A nice slow sipper that is not too sweet or malty."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth a try, but something I won't revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely an interesting brew. I like the combo here in the taste, but the nose was a bit of a let down."
""
""
""
""
"Pour was a dark ruddy brown with two fingers of light beige head. Good amount of lacing. Nose was powerful citrusy hops, floral bouquet, malt, and a bit of pine. Taste was strong hops, but the malt and citrus mellowed the burst. Very drinkable with nice palate."

"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
""
"Pours out a dark brown with ruby highlights and a very short-lived collar for a head, minimal lacing. Aroma consists firstly of heavy tropical fruit: Mango, pineapple, and papaya. Medium roasted malt aroma with excellent char / sweet dichotomy in the flavor profile. Minor nutty character appears as well as the glass warms up. Pine resin and grapefruit peel maintain a constant presence throughout. Carbonation levels are slightly low, medium-thick body with a certain interesting level of slick oiliness."
""
"O: It's an ok beer. It's not to style. It's more just a big ipa. Hides alcohol well with matched assertive bitterness. This is not a black ipa. This is a brown/porterish ipa at best."
""
""
""
"O - this is probably one of my favorite victory brews, and is an overall good beer as far as i'm concerned! never really had anything like this before as far as taste/color goes."
"Pours a deep ruby red color when held to the light with a half finger of head which recedes to skim but leaves rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of caramel malt with a nice citrus smell. There is also an earthy nutiness to it. The taste follows suit with a caramel malt backbone up front then a nice citrus hop flavor along with a slight floral hop and a semi sweet dark fruit taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, but slightly thin. Overall this was a very good beer. Nice aroma and look to draw you in, with a great taste."
""
""
""
""
"Served to me in a chilled pint glass. Dark amber in color with a nice head with decent lacing. Smells pretty hop forward with a good bit of pine and mango. The palate is a bit more balanced with some sweet and smokey malts countering the hops. Good amount of bitterness in the finish. All in all this is a good representation of the style but is not a standout."
"O: Bold and bitter, but lacking uniqueness. Good beer, not great for me. Would pass over for something a little less bitter."
"O: Reminds me of Terrapin's Hop Karma just not as intense, more straight forward hop/malt presence compared to a salad of flavors. Another example of Victory defining a beer style. This is a India Brown Ale in my book, not a Black Ale."

""
"O: wow very good ale. The taste wins out on this one. Nose has a lot going on but seems a bit sweet and malty, but wow the taste is very subtle in all regards and finely balanced. Certainly a brew that is approachable and one I could drink a lot of. Recommend."

"Sampled from a bottle - best by November 2012. Dark brown in color with deep ruby red hues and good clarity despite the dark color. Poured with a dense, rocky beige foam with good staying power that also left sheets of thick sticky lacings on the glass. Complex combination of dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate malt aromas along with citrus, floral and and pine hops that intensify as this warms. Rich, smooth feel with aggressive carbonation. Dark roasted and lightly burnt malt flavors up front, floral and citrus hop bitterness from the middle thru to the end. A hint of dark chocolate flavor toward the end as the dark and burnt roasted malt flavor intensify at the finish in combination with a delayed bitter pine hop aftertaste. A multitude of aromas and flavors make this a beer to be sought out."
"O - Balanced. Bitter all the way through. When the roasted bitterness meets the hops on the back end it could be a bit much for some people. The bartender did state they are marketing this as a black IPA. Very easy to drink but not sessionable."
""
"O - This has come to be one of my favorite beers, from one of my favorite breweries. There is a very unique taste that I have trouble describing. The flavors culminate to create a very distinct, balanced, and delicious beer. I don't know if it completely fits the style based on color and flavor, but I can't come up with a style that better suits it. I have a hard time ever passing this beer up and I will soon miss it greatly until it returns next November."
""
"As I prefer crafts with a mother-lode of fruitiness (Like Pliny and Alesmith-X), I'll pass on this one."
""
""
"This one definitely warms the mouth. Not too much carbonation. Overall an interesting beer, I haven't had too many high hopped ales this dark before. I definitely will be picking this one up again come next winter."
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a dark amber color body with not a lot of head but some nice tan lace around the edge. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits the tongue very malty and sweet. Then after that the piney hops comes on the back. The mouthfeel is nice and overall a good winter style beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is also excellent; a little syrupy but lightly-moderately carbonated so it is certainly very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very good beer in a style that I intend to start drinking more often."

"12oz bottle with an Enjoy By Date of Nov 02 2012. Pours a dark brown color with light brown hues and a thin layer of head. Some lacing. Aroma is piney and chocolatey with some citrus notes. Sweet. Taste is pine and floral hops upfront with hints of chocolate and a floral finish. Not really getting any citrus like I did in the nose. Flavor is mostly floral hop bitterness with pine. Overall, decent and worth having once in awhile."

"I'm a little unsure where I stand on this beer. It comes across incredibly bitter and intensely hopped. It's a little much even for a hop head like me. The malt character is a little one dimensional and doesn't really, in my opinion, hold up to the intense hop character. I probably wouldn't have another one."
""
"I love this stuff, drink time I see it on tap and keep a six pack around as long as it lasts."
""
"Pint glass, Lots of malt on this nose, sweet smelling, a little licorice & dark fruit, hint of coacoa with some herbal and citrus hops. Nice appearance as well, ruby red bordering black. Burnt flavor, toffee, ashy, a little coffee, lots of hop bitterness adding just enough balance. Definitely would drink again"
"Overall this is a fine beer, I would probably buy this again over most other ABA beers out there. I enjoyed it."

"this aint a black ale, but thats okay! pours a deep deep ruby red meets chocolate brown color. huge rising white head, lacey. hectic yeast floating around. smells very very hoppy, but rounder than an ipa, big sweet dark malt aroma too. taste like a big ipa, many different hop characteristics here, piney and floral, but really sturdy. malt sweetness comes in later adding nice depth. mouthfeel is on the heavy side, and the alchohol is present on the tongue. not as carbonated as maybe it could be, and a little heavy in the tummy. not a session brew, but a good starter for the evening."
"O: This is a good brew, just not quite what I was hoping for in a ""black"" ipa. It's very easy to drink though and I'll have to try it on draft at some point."
"There’s definitely a subdued hoppiness on the palate. Bitter, sharp, a little herbal. There’s a light maltiness to balance it out without being too sweet and I taste the alcohol, more than I’d expect to for a 8.7% brew. I’m liking but not loving this one. Layer in some more roast, perhaps, to match the hops, or dial back the booze and I’d really dig this one."
"O: a good one here folks. it reminds me of winter storm from heavy seas with a nice little sweet malty goodness at the end. price-per-sixpack is a little steep but this is something i will buy again"
"Pours a dark brown with crimson highlights. Average lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Way darker than I was expecting. The nose is pine, spruce, citrus, with a slight tinge of caramel malt. Fairly hoppy nose on this beer... nice. The taste follows the exact profile as the nose- the pine, spruce are really out front on the taste. Feel is medium, crisp, w/ major hop bite and a very dry finish. Overall, an interesting and good brew. Cheers."

"Single finger head, not much lacing on a clear amber body. Aroma is Toasty, nutty and malty. Hazelnut in particular. Pine and coffee. Some roasted malt in the taste. Has a burnt element and decent piney hops. Medium body and moderate carbonation. It is a very complex beer and hardto appreciate all of its elements. May be a little too complex."
""
"Even though it was sourced through the official channels, it doesn't seem to have the punch that was intended. Still, its a good go at the style. Plenty of chocolate in this, would still buy again. I do like how Victory seem to work with their beers, with this another beer that is just fun to drink."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark red, almost black, with little head. Smell of fruits with a hint of alcohol, almost like a barleywine. Tastes more like a barleywine than a dark IPA at first, but has a good hoppy aftertaste. Goes down pretty well for a high ABV beer, although it is more of a sipper than a session. Overall, a very fine beer."

"D: like i said in appearance, i wouldnt classify this as an american black as much as i would call it a very hoppy american brown ale. the hops are so refreshing and drinkable and with the roasted backdrop there is a really nice added dimension that gives this brew some depth. well done victory."

"A black ale but has hops and floral undertones in boquet. You can barely see through this beer when held to light. Not very bubbly. Bitter upon tasting with some chocolate taste."

"*EDIT*: just looked at the brewery website and it says a dark IPA, so I will be changing my overall to a 4"

"O: A nice beer to be sure, but I wish it tasted a bit more like it smells! A good experiment with a great result!"
"Enjoyed this one tonight from a pint glass with hummus and pita chips. The glor6y pours kinda weak, like flat soda. I had to adjust the angle to get any kind of a head on it, which faded fast. The smell screams citrus, clover and lemon. The taste is rich dark malts with hop assertive presence that tastes nicely hoppy and fun. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with some warming and phelonic aftertastes. Overall, quite nice."

"Had on draft at Pizzeria Uno's. Poured into a pint glass, furnishes a 1"" head that quickly dissolves leaving some thin, spotty lacing. A pretty dark, lager like brown that lets minimal ligh through. The nose is a great mix of hops and malt. The taste is quits unique. It's both hop and malt foward at the same time. This is quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is a bit bitter, and lingers for quite a while. Overall, a solid beer."
"Solid black IPA"

"O: I will buy this every winter from now on."

"Medium body and carbonation with a lingering bitter and slightly boozy finish. Drinks like a DIPA in terms of power. The malty sweetness of that style is mostly supplanted in this beer by the burnt and roasted quality, one I really enjoyed. This is a top notch, big and tasty hop forward brew by Victory."

"A potent, balanced, and all-around wonderful brew. Exquisite!"
"Despite the drink by date on the bottle, I do not believe this is one to age, which could be a factor."
""
""
"Not bad, but not really my cup of tea."
"I was very happy to be able to sample this before picking up a growler. It is very tasty. For a black ale it is more of a dark brown. It was roast malt noted with some sweet notes of a banana or pineapple. There was also a bit of smoke under the surface of this stuff. Good complexity. The carbonation was a bit low but allow for a cleaner taste and I think it complimented the beer style. I am curious to try this in a bottle to see if I like it better."
"Overall: Frankly, until last summer, I thought this whole CDA thing was overrated and a pain in the neck. Since I don't live in the Pacific Northwest, I hadn't been exposed to these beers. Now I'm a believer! Great beer."
"O - Great find! And it's seasonal. So if you see it out I definitely recommend giving it a try. It has a fun wacky name too. Also at 8.7 abv it leaves you feeling a little wacky, without that sweet alcohol taste left lingering... which is nice."

"Overall - A year ago this was my favorite beer. I haven't drank it in over a year so i was nervous since i knew my palate has changed a lot. I was underwhelmed honestly, but this one is very nostalgic and still a very good beer. My favorite beer to this date? No. But that is the fun of being a beer advocate, you keep on evolving."

"D and O: I dont know how to feel about this beer. I was within the ""best by date", but I also feel like the hops had faded quite a bit, and I didn't really feel like it was an American Black Ale, so rating to style is hard. It reminds me of an American Barleywine...It's drinkable, tasty. Just confusing. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not too bad. Still not sure how I feel about American Black Ale's, but this seems like a nice go to."
""
""
"Pours bubbly amber-brown with foamy khaki head. Aroma of slight cinnamon, cola, grass, evergreen. Big and tasty: cinnamon, cola, and then hop presence soaks thru, evergreen, mint, mild lemon, grassy but without the hop bite. Booze is detected toward the finish but in no way a nuisance. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A very drinkable boozy delight."
""
""
""
"I'm assuming this beer is really fresh which is why I am tasting all hops and very little in the way of roasted malts. Tastes more like a regular IPA right now. Does a good job of hiding the alcohol though. Solid brew but not really my style so I don't know if I would drink it again."
"Saw this as a single on the shelf and remembered how much I liked it last year. Very hoppy, but nice dark color. Bitter and sweet but not syrupy. Velvet texture on palate. Slight sourness. Not much head, good alcohol percentage though. Reminds me a bit of DFH Indian Brown, just a bit more hops."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear black color ale with a average size foamy head with good carbonation and light lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt with light resin and piney notes is satisfying. Taste is more focused on dry roasted malt then hops though some resin and piney notes still comes trough. Body is light with good carbonation. Not sure if I had an old bottle or what but this is below the standard of the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter, best by Nov 2012. This pours dark brown almost black color with a small tan head which quickly dissipates and leaves a lacing. The smells are of pine hops, coffee, molasses and caramel. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty great, lots of spicy black pepper, some dark malts, a little more spice and it finishes with some hop bitterness and a little alcohol burn, dang good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was very surprised by this one. I am on a ""Black Ale/IPA"" quest right now and believe that Stone 15th Anniversary is the pinnacle of the category. This one is much lighter but still dark roasted and a great example of the style. If you are into this style you must try this one."
"If you're into very hoppy brews this is one for you. Personally i'd like something with a touch more malt balance but it's still damn good."
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: Another winner from victory. Great malt flavor and no hint of almost 9% alcohol."

"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours deep amber with adequate head and lacing. Citrusy hop aroma. Taste is a little light for the American Black Ale style but a very nice citrus hop blend and slightly dark malt. This is a very nice beer, not true to the style but as a crossover between straight IPA and Black ale I'm digging it."

"Overall, great beer, one of the few seasonals i pick up a full case of, great balance and mix of hops and malt."

""
"Poured into 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown, with one inch tan head, that sticks around awhile and then settles into a film of bubbles. Plenty of lacing. Smell is pine, grapefruit, hints dark chocolate, and some grass. The taste is all of that, but much more intense. Some strong coffee notes and boy is this a hoppy beast. Body is perfect, neither thick or thin and that makes it dangerously drinkable. Lots of life and on the dry side. This is a great beer, with a great price, and you know how old it is. This beauty is 17 days old."

"o - pretty hoppy and bitter, i would say this is more of a darker (not black) ipa for sure. the higher alcohol percentage gives a subtle warming feeling after you swallow and wait a little bit. i could myself see enjoying this on a chilly day again, even though the beer didn't stand out to me too much"
"Overall I don't think this is really a Black IPA at all. Drinks more like a strong ale with some English influences. Lots of toffee and caramel malt with punishing bitterness. Very interesting and unique beer which is worth trying."
"Strikes me as more of an (Imperial) Red than an ABA, but it's bloody tasty regardless. The choice and proportions of malt and hops demonstrate a brewer who knows their shit."
"Some things were nice about this beer but some things weren't as well."
"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that leaves some decent retention and a beautiful ring of lacing around the beer. The smell is a nice combination of chocolate malts and citrus hops. The taste starts out with some hops followed by some chocolate malts and than more hops attack the palate followed by some sweet malts and the finish leaves some hops on the tongue. A very complex hoppy beer that has a nice smooth, easy to drink mouthfeel that leaves you dry and wanting more. With a beer this good all I can say is Victory Brewing is living up to its name."
" The taste is slightly roasted malt with piney hop backing in the swallow, there is a slight citrus edge, not quite what I would call grapefruit in the middle with the resinous element bringing out more spice with slight sweet nutty tinge from the malt with subtle dark toast and mild alcohol in the taste. There is more heat in the finish with sharpness from the hops lingering. Overall I feel this is good, but it straddles the fence between a hoppy Imperial brown and the black IPA which doesn't fit to me. There is a lot of roasted character which seems to cover some of the hops, but overall a nice American strong ale."
"A really solid ale and my type of dark, hoppy ale. Lots of flavour with great hop character."
"This beer pours a dark carameled amber color with a nice off-white head that laces well. Caramel aroma, fresh piney hops. Taste of toasted bread, honey and caramel, piney hops in generous quantities. Mellows out and gets a bit smoother as the temperature rises. Medium mouthfeel, and quite a good drink overall."
"O: I am not a fan of this style, but this is pretty decent. Wouldn't buy it again as it didn't blow me away. But one you should give a shot if you like black/brown ales."
"Overall- Taste was a slight let down from such a beautiful appearance and aroma, but in no way is this a bad beer... just not an excellent one."
"A deep ruby color with a thin layer of khaki bubbles drifting about the top. Smells of caramel, plum, toasted malt, and floral hops. Tastes of buttery, toasted malt, dark fruit, and burnt rice. Leaves an odd aftertaste that just doesn’t quite add up. Mouthfeel is smooth and wet, but the odd flavor left behind takes away from an otherwise good beer. Not one I'd be opposed to having again, but not one I'll seek out either."
"Overall: Not a fan of this beer; I have enjoyed other brews of this style much more; Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet comes to mind."
"O- probably the most drinkable dark ipas I've had to date, falling slightly behind sublimely self righteous. Would definitely recommend it to any fans of the style."
"D - I'm glad I decided to give this a go, this was my first black ale. Excellent balance with many delicious flavors. The alcohol is well masked and the drinkability is superb. Overall, an excellent beer that I will be trying again in the future."
"Overall - A nice blend of Hoppy and roasted grains, slightly sweet, hides the 8.7% ABV quite well."
"Overall a very interesting beer. I like how the sweet malts offset the bitter grapefruit"
"I took my time sipping on this beer and as I did she really opened up. The taste was on the hoppy side at first but really balanced out once it warmed up. Will buy again!"
"On-tap at Ale+Witch. It pours a deep, dark mahogany-amber hue with a tawny head and sheets of lace. Not black, per se, it is more akin to a darkly-colored BW. The nose has a lot of piney and herbal dankness and is evocative of SN's premium brews' hop profile. There is also a slight vegetal and catty aroma. A piney, earthy, and woody hop profile sits upon an English-style malt (i.e. biscuity, buttery and unobtrusive) and the whole thing reminds me, again, of a top-shelf SN offering. Some tea like bitterness is observed after a while, too. The feel is fairly creamy for a beer in the IPA family; I like. Overall, a very good Black IPA / CDA / ABlkA; one of my favs of the fledgling style."
"I had this first when it was still called Yakima Twilight, and I have enjoyed it since. It is much less burnt than some other examples of the style, but I can deal with this. The flavor profile works, and it's all-around tasty."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Enjoyable beer that got better as it sat, bought a six pack and am looking to age the others so im hoping they age well!"
"Victory Yakima Glory Ale is a highly sparkling, dark brownish red ale with a thick, creamy, light brown head that has outstanding retention and lacing It has a hoppy, roasty aroma with notes of citrus peel, caramel and coffee. It's medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a very dry finish. It tastes dry and well bittered with citrus peel and pine resin. There's a healthy dose of dark roast. The malt is sturdy and has a toffee-like quality. All of the flavors are in balance and they work well together. Great job, Victory. This beer is right up my alley."
"This is a very interesting beer which reminds me of a mix between a black IPA and a barleywine. I can't say I've had too many like it. Victory makes some good brews."
"This beer poured out as a much darker than expected amber color. The head was pretty big here and needed some time to settle down. The smell of the beer was very hoppy, plenty of citrus and pine on the nose. The taste gives off some deep caramel sweetness upfront and a great floral citrus bite in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer had some decent body to it and a good carbonation. Overall this beer was really good I thought and would be willing to drink this one again sometime."
"This beer delivers in every way, a victory for Victory."
"This beer has worked its way into my top 5 beers. I go to Victory Brewpub quite frequently and can't help but order the same beer (yakima glory). a nice use of hops providing a nice scent and taste. i rarely see it on tap anywhere outside of the brewpub but definitely gobble it up if you find it."
"Hopheads should look for this one."
"I didn’t have any Idea what kind of beer this was when I bought it, so I was a little surprised when it came out so dark. The head is thick and sticky and the body is a perfectly clear dark mahogany. Aroma of roasted malts and piney hops. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Flavor of dark roasted and toasty malts countered by a grapefruit rind bitterness.Delicious. I will be looking to get more of this one."
"O- A great example of a Cascadian Dark ale, from all the way in Pensylvania. Its all in the execution and this one does very well. very drinkable despite the 8%+ abv. CHeers."
"O - Probably the hoppiest ""Dark IPA"" I've had. Lot's of interesting tastes going on between the darker malts and the hop bitterness. I'd happily revisit this one."
"O) A decent brew. I'd have another one."
"O) A decent brew. I'd have another one."
"Overall: This is not one of my favorite styles but a complex and tasty beer. I liked the dark, warm, fruity qualities of this black ale versus others in the style The bitter and boozy flavors increased as the brew warmed, which I didn't love but others might."
"Super offering, I wish i could get this in my neck of the woods. True hops heads may think it holds back on the hops, I like the balance delivered here"
"D - With 8.7% ABV, I don't expect to have more than 1 or two, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Another fine beer from Victory. I hope to sample a ""Hop Wallop"" next."
"D: Good, but a tad boozy and dark/not hoppy. I'd order another, but I won't buy a sixer of this one."
"Drinkability: At this ABV Yakima Glory a one a night beer for me , but it’s a nicely complex beer that I’ve enjoyed sipping. I won’t hesitate to treat myself to this one again. My over all impression is that this is a well made beer that works quite well as a cask offering. For me much of the difference between this one on cask and the bottled or tap versions lies basically in the mouth feel of the beer. Even though I thought the tap version to be smooth and creamy, this one tops it for creamy smoothness."
"Didn't quite understand this style the first time 'round, so let's see how one o' the first CDAs I've tried appears now. It pours a clear garnet-russet topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises toffee, light cocoa powder, grapefruit peel, light pine, and mint. The taste leans heavier on the hops, primarily with notes of orange peel, grapefruit rind, and pine. An undercurrent of toasted caramel flows nicely, though definitely hindered by the hops. Things clash a bit here, with balance a lost afterthought. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a decent CDA, but the flavor clash really makes this thing hard to drink with a smile."
"Overall: As the trend of Black IPA's has really taken hold in the US, Yakima Glory tends to get lumped in with them, though it's not at all black and not quite as roasty as it's newfound brothers. Still, a good option for the hopheads looking for something different, although...well, let's be honest, with SO MANY on the market nowadays, these dark IPA's are becoming rather commonplace."
"Overall: OK for the style. I like this style a lot and this one is more hop forward and less roasty. I like a bit more balance as I generally like this style. Not a bad beer, but not one I would go for again given all the better alternatives in the style."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Highly recommended."
"The booziness is completely hidden. I could see having a few and taking a nice nap."
"Very dry, malty mouthful. It tastes like sweet yellow grapefruit but then very bitter on the back end. This beer tastes best when it is cold, because the high ABV (8.7) starts to present itself when on the warm side. In fact, I didn't even know it was that high in ABV until I looked on BA. Victory is slowly becoming one of my staple beers for cost and quality."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how well the roastiness and the flavoring hops blended together. For some reason we were expecting this one to be overwhelmingly hoppy, which could have possibly clashed with the otherwise darker aspects of the brew. When evaluating these “mixed” styles it can be easy to have one component outweigh another, but this brew sees a nice balance through to the end, with some admittedly robust flavorings."
"This is a pretty well designed beer, I laud victory for being bold in their delivery but the flavors aren't integrated well in my opinion, I'm finding that the burnt sourness on the end is overpowering any sort of hop bitterness that I should be tasting. Cool beer but I'm not gonna finish a sixer by myself."
"An average example of the style, but with so many better versions out there, I won't be seeking this out again."
"This stuff really surprised me the first time I had it. Like most other Victory beers, it's a winner. This batch seems a little different from past years, but still really solid. Wicked foamy head when poured. Smell is of hops and malt, with an earthiness. The taste is not overpowering with the hops. There's a toasted, sweet malty flavor that backs it up. Damn, I really love this beer. It's different from everything else I've had, and I dig that."
"O: Good"
"Pours a unique two and half finger of creamy yellow head. Deep brown color. Smells of sweet malts, carmel, toffee, sweet alcohol, earthy hops, piney and some floral. Dated best by Nov 2011. Tastes quite nice, big carmel sweetness, toffee, chocolate powder, earthy and more earth, pine, dark fruity notes, some roasted malts. Medium bodied, medium carbing, a strong lingering pine and earthy bitterness, some dryness but not too much. Overall this is good. The price hurts it overall at $2.75 a single."
"Overall pretty good, I thought it was going to be a light IPA like beer with a name like Yakima Glory, but it's a pretty decent beer otherwise, a bit syrupy and sweet, and sticky, but pretty good, bitter, plenty of hops too."
"O - Very happy with this beer. I actually had it on tap prior to this review and did not enjoy it. Perhaps it was due to poor tap line maintenance, storage or the multiple beers I had prior. Anyway, I'm much more pleased with the bottle presentation. A complex blend of hoppiness and dark malts without trying to overpower the drinker with West Coast hops. Very strong from start to finish."
"If your pallet appreciates hoppiness, seek this brew out. I beleive it's seasonal ."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Rich."
"Carbonation is moderate and the elements work together to offer a balance of crispness and smoothness that won't blow anyone away but certainly makes each sip pleasant. The body is medium, fitting for the overall character if not quite in line with the typical ABA."
"Its` smell has hops, roasted malt and some lemon as well for the citrus aspect. YG hits you with malts, then coffee, hops, a bitter finish. This leans toward full bodied, with the right balance. YG is a nice beer and another solid offering from Victory."
"This one poured a very dark amber/brown color with a good amount of head an decent lacing on it. The smell is pretty heavy with alcohol, not all that pleasant. Taste is heavy caramel malt with some alcohol taste coming through. Not bad, but could be better I think. Medium mouthfeel, not too smooth though. OK beer, but not great. I'd try it again, but won't search it out."
"Overall - Ultimately didn't like it nearly as much as I expected to based solely on its appearance and aroma. More complicated than some Black Ales or Black IPAs, which seem like conventional hoppy beers with dark food coloring added. Here the dark malts add character and complexity, but in doing so detracts from the hops."
"This pours very dark purple with medium tan head. There is moderate retention and decent lacing. The smell is pungent dark fruits and hops. The flavor is robust raison and citrus hops. I like this because the complexity relies on fruit rather than spice. I'm most impressed with the amount of detectable hops and bitterness in the taste, and the lack over over-sweet syrup qualities that sometimes come with ABVs over 8%. The body is heavy, but well balance, so 1-2 of these would be pretty painless."
"Overall, I find this to be a reasonably drinkable, but rather unremarkable beer. Some hops, some malt, decent balance, but just not all that much to it."
"I definitely recommend this one. If I had known it was a seasonal I would have bought more."
"Vey tasty, I'm glad I bought this as a sixes rather than a solo bottle. I'm looking forward to enjoying this smooth, slightly sweet and totally tasty ale."
"Overall what I found in Yakima Glory was immense drinkability. There's a lot of character there but it's not overdone, and what is there is really quite polished - it's superbly balanced! The alcohol might be the only thing that would keep me from having another, but to be honest, I didn't really find it anywhere. Sure, you know it's there, and you can feel it towards the end of the glass, but it never really shows. Nicely done!"
"Interesting that this is characterized as a black ale; not sure what I'd call it, but am not sure black ale is it. In any case, this is a pretty decent beer; I'd get it again, but I prefer the hops to be a bit more assertive in a beer like this. All in all a decent, fairly complex brew."
"Color is a nice deep amber, almost red, with a half-inch white head that lingers for some time. Crystal clear. Balanced smell of malt and hops, with some citrus and dried fruit as well. With closed eyes, could almost mistake it for a double IPA, but the malts give it away. Hoppy, but not too bitter, and extremely well balanced. THe malts lead off, and the hops closes. I'm still working on evaluating mouthfeel in general, so unless I 'feel' something unusual, the rating will be a 4. This is a nice winter to summer transition beer. Pairs well with a good cheddar. Another good showing from Victory."
"A really good brew. Victory's take on Arrogant Bastard, but in a more drinkable, more balanced presentation. I would buy this again, despite the hefty price tag. Not a black IPA as the video on the web site would have you believe. Too bitter and not enough dark roast character for that style. Recommended."
"It's not a porter, it's not an IPA, and I wouldn't even really say it's a hybrid of the two styles but it has some similar elements. Probably most similar in style to Hibernation from Great Divide or maybe a less-intense Arogent Bastard. High praise indeed as those are two of my favorites of the style."
"D: Very good. Not my favorite black IPA, but an excellent example, one I will revisit frequently."
"Overall a very nice dark IPA. The alcohol is well hidden letting the hops really come through. Would definitely drink again."
"Pours a ruby red mahogany brown. Wait a minute... I'd give it higher points for appearance, but it's not black. Then again it doesn't say anything on the bottle about it being a black ale. Sure does smell like one though. Smells earthy and of citrus. A little woody. Crisp hop bite with a very complex finish. Several flavors pass through the pallet before ending. I'm getting a little coriander, almost like a belgian trippel or dark ale. The mouthfeel makes this one a bit harder to wrap my buds around. It's not violently bubbly, but it definitely keeps things from standing around. Notes of mint, tobacco (earthy). The buffet of flavors are definitely trying to gang up on the hop dominance."
"Very good beer and pretty perfect for a spring choice. Strong, yet refreshing."
"this is a great beer. black ales are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles and this is an excellent example. a real multi-purpose beer that could serve as a winter warmer or a refreshing drink on a warm Spring day. highly recommend."
"Pours dark amber with initial inch of creamy foam that settles down to about 1/4 inch. Deep malty smell with a lurking grassy pine smell. Prfounding hoppy taste with a lingering burn. Resin like taste remains on the toingue. Can alsmot taste the hop oils. Very good taste, a little to harsh to drink lots of. But good."
"Batting third....Yakima Glory....from Victory. Must admit....I was expecting a imperial IPA....instead I find out that it is a potent American Black Ale. It is not too bad...high ABV is definitely present....yikes. I think my lid flipped! The color is a cloudy dark amber. It has a nice foaming head that laces well. The taste is initially overpowered by the high ABV, but eventually settle into a decent sipping beer. No way would I session this and the ABV keeps the score lower for me."
"Conclusion: If I saw this on the store shelf, I'd probably look a little harder to find something I like better. It is a very respectable beer but not one I'd search out."
"The powerful hop presence and 8.7% abv mean that one may not like to have many of these consecutively, but it is nonetheless a great hop showpiece displayed on a canvas of dark, roasted malts."
"I could have a few, the 8.7% is well hidden in a so many layers of yummy goodness."
"Real interesting beer, good for drinakbility and could have again. This one strikes me as interesting to try on tap I think it might even be better possibly."
"D - Excellent beer that I would drink all night."
"As with most Victory products, I think this is a great beer. Very enjoyable and pleasing to the palate. Could sit around and suck on these for a quite a while."
"The drinkability is good. It could be a bit more interesting and dynamic, but it is a solid beverage."
"Mouthfeel is great, as the beer is very full and creamy at times. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the finish, and also due to the 8.7% abv being pretty visible, and not in a good way. I like this beer, but it was a bit disappointing to me."
"Overall, this was an interesting brew. The ingredients meshed into some unique aromas and flavors. This wasn't the best black ale, but it definitely unique and good."
"D- Overall its another solid delivery from Victory. I enjoy taking my time with this one. As it warms up you can definitely notice the ABV. I bought one and then bought a case and have been enjoying each one ever since"
"Drinkability: I didn't like this one as much as I remembered from the past, but it is still quite good. I would like a bit more of the nutty roast when I take a sip. That being said, I'm sure I'll end up having it again."
"D: Besides the longstanding bitterness I was getting on the finish, I'd love this beer. However, the unpleasant aftertaste is probably going to make this a one-and-done selection for me. Victory is a killer brewery and everything they make is worth drinking. This one may just be a matter of my own personal preference, but I'll stick to Hopdevil if I'm looking for bitterness."
"This went down pretty smoothly, so I guess drinkability is pretty high for me. I'm not completely sold on the style, but this is one on the better black IPAs I've had."
"There's no shortage of citrus and grass in the nose, a touch of chocolate, but little in the way of dark roast. Taste is more of the same; it's more like a malty (but flavorful) east coast IPA instead of a proper CDA. Plenty of pine and grassy hops with a nice juicy citrus presence as well. Respectably bitter. Finish is all juicy hops and caramel; where's the roast? I'd be scoring this significantly higher as a regular IPA, but as a CDA it falls flat. On a positive note, it's more bitter and flavorful than most east coast IPAs."
"D: I imagine this is a pretty good example of the style, but I just find the flavors to clash and leave a unpleasant aftertaste. One and done is good for me. I'll scale the grade with style in mind."
"I first tried this last year when it was Yakima Twilight, and I think at that point I'd only had 1 other Black Ale (Stone 11 I believe). It was remarkably good then, and after having many more black ales over the intervening year, I still think it is one of the best. A very good, highly drinkable beer, and a perfect non-spiced winter seasonal."
"Overall - Its a very bold beer and extremely hoppy beer but it tends to smooth out as it warms. Definitely not sessionable, but its a nice 1 stop visit when your palet is in the mood for a strong hop bite."
"Drinkability: This goes down very easily for an 8+ ABV. The taste is very nice and the alcohol is hidden well. I really like this beer and will likely buy it again."
"This was a pretty good beer, good complex bold flavor that was relatively easy to drink."
"D/O- Good beer. Don't know if I'd want any more than one or two."
"D: This is a very complex beer, with both the hops and malt flavors battling each other. I will give this another shot or two in the future."
"Pours a very dark brown/mahogany with one finger of tan head with good retention. Fascinating aromas: malts and hops are equally dominant, and the hops are surprisingly IPA-like. The malt aromas are of charred chocolatey sweetness, and the hops are piney and resinous. The overall effect is that of a smore cooked on a sappy pine stick. Flavor-wise, complex hops actually dominate the front and mid-palates, before dark chocolate comes in on the finish. The taste of chocolate-covered orange peel lingers long. An intriguing beer. One that I'd happily buy again."
"Honestly not my top pick for this style, but I could definitely see myself enjoying another glass or two in the future. I am especially interested in seeing how this is on draft..."
"D: This is a very good black ale, with unique characteristics of both IPAs and stouts combined in a manner I have only found in this beer. It is an excellent example of what hybrid styles can be and is my favorite black IPA."
"In the end, a very nice beer. This is a interesting style of beer and Victory does a good job representing it."
"If you like this and live in Michigan, try Good Humans by Short's brewing. They must share a grain bill and hop schedule to a certain degree because of the unique flavors."
"Hints of bitter pine come out in the aroma and taste as the beer descends to the wider portion of the snifter. The bitterness sticks to the palate and it's not super pleasant. This is a easy-drinking beer for 8.7% ABV, but there are more fun Victory beers available."
"D: At 8.7% ABV I thought I was going to have to muscle thru half of it and end up giving the rest to one of my friends. But it was gone before halftime."
"{Updated with a older bottle believed to be near best by date. Definitely preferred over fresh one. This aged bottle is one of the best black IPAs I've had.}"
"The hop grit so often associated with IPAs coats my tongue throughout, quite unique in my experiences for a Black Ale. This is a real treat, and is also smooth. Despite the rather high ABV, this is no sipper, very enjoyable and yet another terrific beverage from one of the finest breweries around. Victory has done it again, and with Yakima Glory, has successfully melded ramped-up hops with heavy malt to produce a splendid, tasty beer. Excellent creativity and craftsmanship, Yakima Glory is very well done."
"A good sipping beer, but I think the black is stronger than the IPA."
"Pours a dark brown with a one finger head that dissipated pretty quickly. On the nose it is a combination of a conifer with some chocolate and roasted malt underneath. It's a really clean aroma. On the tongue the chocolate flavors hit up front with a whole load of the piney hop bitterness following close behind. In the mouth it's pretty thin but it compensates a little bit with the bitterness sticking around for a while. A pretty good beer, and now I'm interested in the style."
"D: for me huge, it goes down so easily. if it werent for the fairly decent ABV, id enjoy more than just a few at a time. i loved it last year and love it this year!"
"Another good one from Victory. Well balanced but complex, dark but an ale, not a contradiction but a confirmation that ""black"" and ""ale"" can co-exist on a beer label!"
"Victory Yakima Glory has a dark reddish colour and a nice 5 mm head that fades to decent lacing. The smell is of piney hops with some sourness. There may be some yeastiness too. The initial flavour is hoppy, but the taste develops into a roasty charcoal finish.The flavour is lovely, probably my favourite example of this style. This beer feels creamy in my mouth. The charcoal flavour builds as you drink more, but it's still a delicious beer that combines some interesting elements of an IPA and a stout."
"D: I really like this beer. It's good to grab when you need a change of pace. It's goes down a helluva lot easier than the abv would have you think and it's another fine offering from Victory."
"D - Good drinkability on this one. This is only the 2nd black ale that I've had, and I think it's pretty good. It goes down smooth and has a nice flavor to it. Black ales are kind of a weird style IMO, but I'd try this beer again for sure."
"Good tasty ale for hop fans, pleasant and easy to drink."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark. Very dark. Borderline black. Slight lacy head. Decent hop aroma, nothing overpowering, but very well balanced. Slightly sweet smell. Pleasing to the nose is an understatement. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Citrus-like hoppinness without an overpowering bitterness bite. Slight sweetness at the end, which mutes down the hops just enough. A little watery for my liking in the feel, but I'll deal with it and leave it at above average. Aside from the heavy alc. content, I could drink this exclusively every day and every night."
"Another great offering from Victory Brewing Co. I love reading the verbiage on beer bottles and this one is no different. It would have been nice, however, if Victory had listed the different varieties of hops used in this beer, since it is the aroma and flavor of hops that stands in the forefront of this brew."
"Great beer. Good sipper. Good cold weather beer with great hops."
"D: This is terrific and one of the only black ales I enjoy."
"D-Decent representation of the black IPA style."
"D- Alcohol is totally masked, very drinkable and tasty can be paired with spicy dishes."
"Overall: I was expecting something totally different for my first American Black Ale/Black IPA/Cascadian Dark. Instead of black and hoppy, I got amber and smooth - but in the end, I really liked this beer."
"Cheers"
"D- A nice ""black ale"" taste more like a black IPA. Either way not too bad would def try again."
"M/D: A decent black IPA. The hops leave a slightly unpleasant bitterness and this beer didn't pair up well with some dark chocolate I had. Still, the mix of roast and bitter hops is intriguing and worthy of purchase."
"Pours out a dark brown color, fairly clear but a bit of haze. Smallish to non-existant white head. Kind of a really thick brown-ale scent. Pretty malty nose- but you can smell the alcohol and some bittering hops as well. Kind of the same idea as the scent, its like a high-octane brown ale. Given my general dislike of brown ales, this is actually pretty good. Prominant malt from with some nutiness, a bit of bitter hops, and a visible alcohol spice. Fairly wet and medium bodied. Certainly not something you'll taste every day."
"D- Easy to drink and very enjoyable. I do think that it is a little better on tap, but still very good out of the bottle. A quick description for me would be roasted Hop Devil."
"1/2 finger light tan head resulted in broken layer on top of amber brown clear body, medium dissipation with some spider leg retention, minimal streams of carbonation rising, I thought the color was light for style, needs more carafin. Nose is caramel malt dominated, some floral and very slight citrus notes, no roast. Taste is pretty sweet for style, cuts into impact of hops, caramel, some citrus, pretty well balanced but light on the hops. Mouthfeel is medium, pretty good effervescence. Good drinkability despite noticeable alcohol heat. If this is supposed to be a ABA/CDA the color was not indicative of the style, and the hops weren't assertive enough, irrespective of absence of roasted malt."
"Verdict: A very good beer anbd worth tracking down, but not for the timid."
"D: a nice black ale a little above average from what I've come to expect from this style."
"The mouthfeel is very thick and carbonated, I think it might be a little too thick when considering the dry and bitter aftertaste. The drinkability, however, is excellent. Any hint the nearly 9% ABV is completely masked by the malts, and it's super drinkable. A very interesting and well-composed beer. I'm not sure if I'd want a six-pack of this, but I'm sure one here or there wouldn't hurt."
"This was so-so for me overall, I would have it again but it didn't really strike me as outstanding"
"This one pours and nice brownish hue, a shade darker than amber (not black), and with a nice IPA-esque head and lacing. Nice hoppy aroma, pine and tobacco, mingled with a sturdy malt base. This is a really well balanced beer. The focus is on hops, with a nice bitter bite up front, but also plenty of malt character and a nice mellow roastyness, nutty and toasty too. There's enough malt balance that this doesn't come across as a super bitter beer, but the finish is dry and lingering, real nice. This contributes to the drinkability of this beer. Also, I was drinking this last weekend and now I realize why I got a little tipsy - 8.7%?? I was tossing em back, thinking it was a perfect session beer. Well, it kind of is - real nice to drink, as long as you aren't going anywhere! A bold American ale by Victory!"
"A tasty and easy drinking Black Ale from Victory."
"Overall I still am a very big fan of this beer but I don't believe the cask conditioning did it any favors. Worth a shot however you can get it but it's better on-tap or from a bottle with full carbonation."
"The taste is great. I enjoyed this a lot. Its caramaly, bisquity, and full of hoppy goodness."
"Medium body, sticky and bitter on the palate. Pretty tasty drinking, especially since the alcohol is masked well. I'm not totally into black IPAs, but this was pretty tasty."
"This is a nice drinkable brew and has a high alcohol level that is hard to detect. Another winner from Victory."
"D: Decent. Dryness of the aftertaste keeps you drinking. This was definitely more dark than IPA"
"lower carbonation, fairly smooth mouthfeel and creamy head. no hint of the almost 9% abv."
"2015 Update: Pours blood red color with a thick foamy 2 finger tan head that had a lot of speckles in it and faded extremely slowly, leaving great foamy lacing - raised the ""Look"" quite a bit in the review based on this (went from 3 to 3.75). Smells very dank and fruity, like fresh hops, dark fruit, caramel and thick brown sugar in a glass. The nose and taste are both very sweet, very fruity and full of piney and citrus hops with a rich malty sweetness like molasses, syrup and fermented candied sugar. Not sure if it's the hops or the malt, but either way it's very sweet and potent which lets traces of the ABV come through like barrel aged booze. Pretty bitter and a little too sweet, but better than I remember it a few years back.  Lacks the balance I hoped for, but better this time around."
"Overall: A nice beer, I wish the overeager server wouldn't have taken my glass when I got up to get another beer."
"Medium/Light body a great balance of hops and malts bitter but not overly pungent."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but the light body and sharp roast hurt the overall drinkability."
"D - This is a one or two at a time max type of beer. Good punch of flavor that will erase the taste of that crap beer you just had. But anything more than that could kill your buds for the night."
"Good mouthfeel and drinkability despite the high abv. A little stronger than most in the style, but very good."
"D: A drinkable beer as there is nothing overwhelming about it. If your in the mood for a maltier, dark pale ale than this is a decent choice."
"Very drinkable, but at almost 9%, it's certainly not a session beer. Works well as a winter beer, but it would suit any season. Another great beer from Victory."
"An exciting, delicious brew fit for hopheads."
"So get yourself some blazing hot curry and let this puppy tear right through it and finish the whole thing off with a gingerbread man or too."
"An excellent beer."
"Pours a murky brown with a frothy mocha head. The smell is sweet, with a hoppy nose and subtle malt undertone. The flavor is big, much bigger than the smell. The flavor starts with a hop kick and some bitterness that sticks through the aftertaste. The beer moves into a nice malt background, but the star of the beer is that citrus hop flavor that continues to build as you drink. The mouthfeel could be better, not so smooth but still enjoyable, a medium mouthfeel. This is a nice drinker, lots of flavor, the higher ABV isn't noticeable."
"Had this on tap at The Pony Bar in New York City. Pours a dark brown colour with a finger of white head. Nice head retention, as some head remained all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus hops with a huge roasted malt. Flavour has some bitterness, but the roasty sweetness seems to shine more here. Medium bodied carbonation. This is a very nice Cascadian Dark Ale, and I'm sure to have it when I'm in the US agian."
"The tastes are all over the place earthy hop, roasted and crystal malts all come together to form an almost blackberry flavor that finishes dry nice"
"Notes: solid IPA with a bigger malt backbone than typical, though no where near a barleywine. great option if you wanted something very flavorful and more balanced"
"I'm intriged by this brew. It was not what I expected, but it's interesting. The challenge of Black IPAs is to balance the hops and malt, obviously, and somehow get them to compliment one another. Kind of a water-and-oil thing. This one does this well."
"Drinkability: Solid black IPA, but I have had better."
"The beer had a medium body to it with a nice dry, hop aftertaste. The beer had good drinkability and was smooth but as the beer warmed, the alcohol was noticeable in the aroma and some in the taste, but this did not distract from the enjoyment of the beer. Overall, another quality beer from one of my favorite brewers and I could see myself really enjoying this style of beer."
"D - This is a very good Black IPA although it is not as dark in color as most."
"Taste is similar to aroma, bitter-spicy burnt citrus up front (not too strong), joined by caramelised raisin and citrus-candy sweetness, some juicy yeastiness. It is fairly balanced up front but after the finish, lingering spicy bitterness hangs around too long. It has light raisiny alcohol but not boozy despite the ABV. It is a bit one-dimensional as with aroma, very humdrum, etc., but it is a well-made beer otherwise and what flavours it has are clear and bright, reasonably balanced and drinkable despite the failings, tediousness and high abv."
" a dial 911 hop attack."
"A dream of a beer for all you hopheads out there. Perhaps a bit to harsh for the ""faint of palate"" beer drinkers--nothing we had a problem with though."
"Overall, a really good BIPA that is very refreshing and balanced. High recommend. Avail here in TX. Winter seasonal so I'll have to get my fill now and add to my list to look out for next winter. If avail year end, this would make the rotation. [R;Y]"
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finishes bitter and dry. This is not a beer I would recommend or try again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it had a lot of flavor to it and was pretty good overall. It was very bitter in the finish with both the hops and roasted malts adding to that. Pretty decent beer overall, but roasted malts and strong hops isn't really my favorite combo overall."
"D/O- All in all a good Black IPA. Personally, I've got a sneaking suspicion that Black IPAs just might not be my cup of tea. Victory is one of my favorite breweries, but I'll more than likely reach for one of their other beers before this one. Worth a try. Cheers."
"D - This tastes in between a strong amber ale and a pale ale. I think it's really intriguing and different but overall I wouldn't drink this regularly. Not too bad though."
"A very tasty and interesting beer, haven't had anything quite like it before. Although when it gets warm the alcohol flavor begins to overpower everything else, when drank cold to cool the alcohol is not nearly as obvious."
"Verdict: Yakima Glory is a solid and easily drinkable Black IPA with a well-hidden punch. Ultimately though, it's a little too leafy and not citrusy enough for my personal tastes."
"D: This beer exhibits a slight astringent note at the end of the taste, which lowers the drinkablity of the beer. Overall, really interesting beer. It is a hybrid, but I have no idea what the mix is (as in which styles were slammed together to bring together the concept for this beer)."
"D: This beer is massively flawed, not really requiring further dissection in that regard. What is interesting is the stylistic place from where this beer takes its inspiration. Whereas most black IPAs inherit their dark ""genes"" from a beer of porter or stout parentage, leading to a dominating black roast/coffee malt profile, this beer seems to have decidedly Belgian roots. Stylistically its dark qualities remind of a quad--albeit not a very refined one. With hop flavors that are mostly dark as well--nuanced, perhaps--there just isn't the expected clash that somehow ends up working in the best examples of this style. As a strong sipper this beer is not an unqualified mess, but Yakima Glory lags behind many other, worthier, examples of the style."
"d - An ok Black IPA, but too much alcohol in the taste. Would try again."
"The mouthfeel is the best part of this beer in my opinion. I love how the malts start out the slick feel and moves quickly into a swelling bitterness. That bitter pinch lasts into and through the finish lingering the perfect amount. A great, easy drinking beer."
"Drink- I like what Victory does. Solid beers and not too over hyped. Will have to recommend this to some friends."
"Slight booze bight, but is really well balanced from the fruity sweetness of the hops.  I could drink a six pack of these easy.  "
"Beautiful colour, slightly less expansive aroma, and a delightfully robust taste profile - albeit tasting far boozier than its 8.7% should require. Not quite as hoppy as I had hoped for a ""Black IPA", but still a drinkable pint. Would like to find a draught tap to see what, if any, complexity or balance is added via time in a barrel..."
"MF/D- Full bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability is good for being big on the palate. Again, not to be a jerk, but this should be an American Strong Ale."
"D - Decent drinkability but the with the 8% ABV one or two would be my limit."
"Poured a dark amber brown with yellow ruby highlights that had a thin head and left a little frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma had some hops with caramel, citrus, and sweet malty notes but had slight underlying nutty notes. The taste had a better hop profile which meshed well with the caramel flavor with citrusy nutty accents and a decent malt backbone. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, nutty, mild hoppy, and slight bitter finish. It drank good and was a solid interpretation of a cascadian IPA. Definitely wanna try a range of the black hoppy brews."
"Im glad the west coast is starting to get lots of Victory brews now. Great brewery."
"no alcohol heat for a relatively strong brew makes this an easy drink. the flavors are a tad odd and not perfect for me, though they are not harsh or a hindrance. would drink again (and again)."
"D- what I expected. An amazing presentation on a black ipa. Dark malt with a prized hop profile leave an incredibly drinkable beer. The 8.7 percent is not even recognizable. An amazing brew!"
"This beer is not really black, it's kind of a dark red to brownish colour. The best part about this beer is the nice, light tan, rocky head. Nose is kind of off as well as the taste. It doesn't have enough of that roasty character associated with this emerging style. It was almost like they were scared to fully commit to the process and sort of just stopped half way through. Yakima hops are good tasting but with the sense of incompleteness in the roasting, they are left to fend for themselves. An okay beer, not great though. Probably won't come back."
"Overall, a very good black IPA."
"D - This beer grew on me. At first I wasn't sure about it, but about half way through the beer I was sold."
"Don't know if bad tap lines or what, but I this did not taste or smell like I expected it to."
"I can't help but find each sip of Yakima Glory more and more intriguing. Personally, I wouldn't call it a Black IPA. It's more of a hoppy, herbal Amber/Red Ale. While it is good beer, it could easily be improved. I think a narrower hop profile would give it more of an identity and more focus. More body would be good. Definitely worth checking out though. Good luck putting your finger on this one."
"Pours a crystal clear deep garnet color with a frothy off white head that dissipates quickly but coats the edges of the glass all the way down. Aromas of citrus, herbal hops mixed with a bit of toffee and caramel. Taste is bitter almost to the point of harshness. The herbal/earthy/citrus is there but not as prevalent and gets mixed with a bitter tea flavor. Some dark caramel, little bit of chocolate, and maybe a hint of dark fruits mixed with some warming alcohol round out the taste experience. Lightly carbonated with a creamy/resinous mouthfeel and medium body. I can appreciate this for what it is, but I didn't particularly care for it. That harsh bitter tea flavor kind of ruined this for me."
"Drinkability: Other than the mild touch of ""hotness", almost dangerously drinkable. But the ABV would really come and bite you in the end. Sip this one."
"D - Hop bitterness does not affect the drinkability however the ABV is a little too high for me in regards to drinkability."
"This one's pretty thick as you might expect from the style, but one that I could see having 2-3 of."
"Cheers!"
"Beautiful deep amber red in color. Has a lasting off-white head. minimal lacing on the glass. Very balanced smell between the malts and hops. Smell is sweet, slightly bitter. I can smell a somewhat toasted character along with grapefruits and a little piny smell towards the end. Very simple in that area. Lots of sweet toasted malts at first but then citric hops come in. Not too much though. Somewhat light for an IPA. It finishes bitter and leaves a citric hops lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel on this one is thick, with lots of carbonation. Washes over the palate cleanly. I dont think i would be able to drink more than a couple of these. Flavors are well balanced but something seems to be missing. The ABV is pertty hight as well. A sixer of these I would be pretty drunk. Thanks to johnnnniee I was able to try this one out."
"Not really jiving with this one, probably one and done for me."
"Notes: not really a great example of the ""new"" style, and as big a joke as Cap't Krunkles is (trading wise atleast), it is better than this"
"Beer is a dark brown, the shade of black tea. Not much of a head. Aroma is surprisingly complex: toast, malt, cherries, orange, cocoa. Taste is bitter and hoppy, with a big malt backbone. Finish is dry and hoppy, with hints of cherry or something that I can't quite place. Taste was a little less complex than I was expecting, given the aroma. Still quite nice. Mouthfeel is nice. It's well carbonated, and the alcohol provides a little warmth but is hidden well. Fairly drinkable. It's somewhat heavy, and so not a beer I'd probably want to have more than one of."
"Mildly drinkable beer, tiny bit too much bite for me."
"Nice balance. The 8.7% ABV is not at all noticeable, so be careful with this one."
"very enjoyable as I am not so into the sweet browns. I could have this beer again and again."
"D - Very drinkable, very nice black IPA."
"Everything I've written above is basically a longer version of: I like the malts here, but don't particularly enjoy the hops and the sooner they fade away, the better."
"I dug the malt profile that I somehow could discern through it all. A different hop combination could turn this into a winner. It's a vague reference, but my overall take on the hop flavors was a scent I remember vividly of a Styrofoam block used to hold a silk flower arrangement. Help me out with this if you know what I'm talking about."
"D/M: overwhelming maltiness really dominates the pallet and in my opinion it is not a good thing. Drinks heavy and finishes the same. Leaves a lingering malty taste in the mouth"
"Smells juicy as you pour it into your glass and then an huge aromatic smell tells you that this has a lot of resinous hops. You smell some of the dry malt in there too but most hop dominating in the smell. The taste is amazing. Whole flower resinous pine like grapefruit hops hit you right away with an amazing malt sweetness in the middle. The malts also contribute a cherry like character to it that mixes very well with the bitterness. This actually reminds me of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale but with more resinous hops. Yakima Valley Washington must be a serene place. It also finishes very dry. On top of that they sell a pretty much 9 percent beer in 6 packs! This is awesome and will really make that 10 dollars I paid for it worth while."
"Is it me, or does Hop Devil, Hop Wallop, and Yakima Glory all smell and taste the same?"
"Pours out a brown hazy color with tan head which quickly dissappated. Not very effervescent upon pour. Not much lacing, which seems odd. Smells like deep resinous pine, strange that this beer smells slightly reminiscent of their Imperial Stout Storm King, same hops I am thinking give it that familiar spiceyness and citric quality. Wow, the taste is actually very smooth for such a big beer, I can see these going down toooo easy. Big leafy hop grapefruit bite followed by some sweet malt, but not too sweet and pine finish. This beer is a bit hard to place, definitely a few shades darker than my other favorite hoppy beer Alpha King, more toastyness from the darker malts, perhaps some toffee. There is a lot going on here besides big hops...mouthfeel is quite smooth and this beer is extremely drinkable, little alcohol coming through in the taste. Overall this beer is quite nicely balanced, makes me wish more beers came off this way. If your a fan of Victory brews, specifically Storm King, think of this as perhaps a Storm King light, if that is not totally beyond absurd?"
"Enjoy this one easy, but reach for the top!"
"D - This is a very nice black IPA, it achieves a balance between the dark malt character and the hops that most don't manage while it also avoids any chocolate or coffee flavor that would confuse it with a stout. The hops are significant, but with the thick malt profile, they are really just barely enough to balance the beer. Very nice, this is definitely a beer that is worth seeking out."
"D: This is one of my favorite Victory brews and one of my go-to drinks this time of year. If only the Hop Devil and Hop Wallop could be this fantastic!"
"One of the ""Black IPA""'s I've had that's actually well-done, and worth buying again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and plan on having more. Soon."
"Fairly heavy bodied, but easy to drink 1 or 2."
"This beer poured a clear dark amber and formed nice foamy light tan head that left lattice lace. Looked like a root beer float. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, caramel and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, hops and cocoa. The body was medium light. The finish was bittersweet."
"D - Not my cup of tea. The pepper was too over the top and I left the glass only half drained."
"Highly recommended."
"D-Easy to drink and another is certainly an option."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and taste, which makes this beer rather easy to drink."
"This is a really solid beer despite the astringency. I'm not sure, but I heard that last years batch wasn't as astringent. The flavor is rich and deep, and I sure hope next year this astringency is taken care of."
"This gets a 5 for drinkability without a doubt. Considering the fact that this is basically a 9% IPA, I'm not sure I've had anything more drinkable...its smooth, totally balanced, warm but not boozy...just really nice to drink! Somehow the strong malt character totally mellows the hops and vice versa - as borat would say...Great success!"
"D: purdy dang good. I'm a fan of this style and this one lived up to my expectations for both the CDA and Victory as a brewery. Very drinkable, not too bitter, not too sweet, not too heavy, not to watery, with just the right amount of alcohol. Suffice it to say, it's incredibly sessionable and I can foresee many more of these in my near future."
"1287"
"D: This is sort of like a darkened double IPA imo. It really is interesting how the hops and citrus blend in with the darker malts. Also, very little alcohol is detected, yet it is 8.7%. Whew!"
"Some of the flavors and aromas are reminiscent of porter and scotch ale, and the high hop factor seems to fight with what would otherwise be a delicious, hearty beer. Being a hop-head however, I say kudos to Victory for creating a dark IPA that isn't black. Definitely worth trying more than once."
"This is a tasty brew that I will put on my list to snag when I can find it."
"Pours a clean deep amber to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, fresh citrus like hops. In the taste, fresh pine hops, and a mellow citrus hop, with a nice malty backing. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, fresh hop aftertaste. Nice balance with a mixture of hops."
"Scents of roasted chocolate and molasses malts, and also of piney nuts on the nose. Strong peachy scents as well. Has a two finger head with good lacing down the glass. Is also a very dark red/light black colour. Wow, this one blasts through the palate. Heavy malty flavor mostly of a heavy IPA. Bursts on the back of the tongue with strong hoppiness. This is one hell of a brew. Very comparable to Troegs Nugget Nectar..IMO! Delicious beer!"
"Hmm. This is a tough one. It's very much delicious and all but the style just doesn't seem to fit. I would only rate it lower due to the fact that it's not quite where it should be style-wise."
"Drinkability suffers as my impressions change from first sip through to the last - my enjoyment steadily decreases as I pick up more sweetness and yeast and bitterness and alcohol as I go along. I'm kind of flying into a rage right now as I ponder the 12.99 spent on this six pack, but I""m calming down because there are objectively good things I detect amidst all the downers."
"Taste-Spicy hops, toasted malt note,definite rye spiciness going on. Pretty dry finish. Not quite a ""Black IPA"" in color but more in the flavor profile with a nice balance of spicy,toasted malts and piney hops. A bit of a surprise in taste, as no style is listed on the bottle, but certainly worth a try."
"I reviewed my notes from 2009 and I believe this year's release is a bit darker in color and the flavor a tad more intense. Still a great beer and an ""A' in my book. It has a beautiful fall color. A light hop and citrus aroma. A full flavored and bodied beer. Little if any unpleasant after taste. I considered this one of the best beers for 2009. A couple more and I will let you know how it rates for 2010."
"D-A decent release from Victory, but not one of their best. It would be hard to drink a 6 pack of this."
"Cheers.."
"On cask at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep brown almost black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is toasted dark malts and mild pine hops. The taste is an interesting blend of toasted caramel malts and sharp pine hops. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with smooth subtle carbonation. I must say, I like this one more this time than either of the other two times I've had it."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with amber highlights, and a thick and frothy tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is equally impressive with huge juicy and citrusy hop notes, along with some orange marmalade, some cocoa and light coffee notes, caramel, fruity esters, and some alcohol. The flavor is a little less intense, with piney and floral hops upfront, along with some milk chocolate, mocha, caramel, orange marmalade, fruity esters, and moderate alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. Really tasty black IPA here, note quite on the level of SSR but not far off either."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried it because it is an interesting brew. Not one of my favorites, but I wouldn't turn one down, and I may try it again (five more in the fridge anyway)."
"Drinkibilty - Was a nice change from normal ipa's. Enjoyed the bitterness and maltness. Would like to drink a few more of these"
"Overall this beer is decent."
"D= Not a bad beer but not quite what I'm looking for in a CDA. This as a beer is not too bad though. It has a time and place but sort of falls into a unique category."
"Pours reddish brown with a nice off white head with decent enough staying power. Some nice legs on the way down. The nose brings forward quite a bit of malt character with some dark fruits and candied dark sugar. Also a fair amount of piney, resinous hops. The taste is a letdown, with some sweet malt failing to really interact with the piney hops, and the darker fruits get lost in the background. Feel is somewhat sweet, yet still a bit dry. Overall, an interesting beer with some decent characteristics, but not my favorite and pales in comparison to some others within this emerging style."
"D-I enjoyed this beer. It is not a session beer. The body is full and the beer can be filling but the flavor ranges over a broad spectrum of tastes that makes for an experience."
"The beer is not overly bitter as the sweeter malts succeed in acting against the hops but both the dark, bready malt sweetness and the bright, fruity and floral hop flavors create a flavor greater than the sum of it's parts and the Black IPA is true harmony in a glass."
"Black IPAs are moving way up the ladder in my preferred beer styles, and this one is a very strong contender. Another really strong offering from Victory."
"D-Seems unbalanced..."
"Much heavier in the mouth than most IPAs, yet still oily. Good on drinkability even though I can't see myself ever drinking more than one of these (taste preferences). Fans of the style should love this brew."
"D - tons of flavor and body -- and yes, alcohol too -- but it's never overwhelming. not a huge IPA person but this is simply superb craftmanship."
"D - I had pretty high expectations on this beer and it stacked up well for me. I really enjoyed the blend of hops/malts as well as the hidden alcohol that basically lends a warming in the throat. The alcohol is dangerously hidden so watch out! I could see myself sitting down with a couple bottles of this bitter brew, pretty damn good and worth the $10.50 a sixer price tag. Cheers!"
"An assault on the pallete for sure. If you want to pair this one with food, make sure you have some strong flavors going on in your dish. Great beer. My only criticism would be that it's just a bit too bitter for my liking. Other than that, it's awesome."
"D: Despite the high ABV, I could drink this all day."
"Hmm, seems like I like this one a fair bit more than most folks. Dark brown color with a tan head on top that sits around for a good while. Really enjoyed the dark IPA, big hops flavor, some citrus, and then all kinds of darker, dried fruit flavors in there as well. Roastiness, some lighter chocolate and some light caramel as well. Big, mixed flavors that mix nicely together. Would definitely pick it up again, although the price tag was a little higher than I'd hope."
"D- Pretty big on this one, 8.7% hidden pretty well though, fantastic complex beer, the depth of the flavor is great, with enough body to work really well as a nice IPA option for a cool fall evening."
"I enjoyed this beer. first time I've tried a dark IPA, I would certainly try the style again."
"D - Quality brew. I could drink plenty of it."
"Another dark beer with a serious helping of bitter hops. Nice citrus aromatics greet you. Looks kiind of brown, not black, so mebbe they should call this a brown IPA? Whateva it is, it is freaking great!@! Really digging these dark hoppy beers. Goes down pretty easy for the high ABV."
"Whatever...I like this stuff."
"Draft. Poured a red/tan color with minimal head. Hop notes in the nose of slight pine. Very malty back bone on this one with a hoppy pine ending. Tasted the pine flavors more than I thought since the aroma wasn't that strong. A sipper for sure. Medium mouthfeel."
"This is a rich beer...it is very active on the tongue, and has a very good balance between each element."
"Defintely better than expectations, victory always seems to be a little underwhelming in the hop department, but this was just right."
"Yakima Twilight is rather enjoyable. With a best by date of 5 months from now, I have no idea how old this beer is, but I get the impression it wasn't bottled recently. Maybe I would like it more fresh? In any case, this is a creeper despite the hidden alcohol."
"Drinkability is very high, loved it. Well done PA! Dangerously tasty."
"M/D: Medium body. Active, bubbly carbonation that is a little harsh on the tongue. Nothing special at all in the drinkability department. Alcohol is not hidden at all. The taste isn't bad, but its just not doing much for me. I'm good for one and ready to move on. Odd beer with an odd taste profile."
"A nice brew. I'm never in the ""must be aged"" camp but laying this one down for a little while really rounds this beer out in my opinion. In fact I think the 11/2010 may be too conservative an estimate for a best by date."
"Drinkability -- Very solid hop-forward strong dark ale. I would be tempted to classify this as an American Barleywine. Has a lot of rich malt notes with the raisin and molasses, but with well-matched hops to and a great depth of flavor that makes you want to keep coming back."
"nice"
"This is tasty and enjoyable. Not a session beer, but a nice winter or nightcap choice."
"D - Not all that great of a beer. The aftertaste is really off putting. It seems like this beer could be tweaked a bit and would come out great but as of now I am not a fan and will not seek this out again."
"Seems to become more IPA like as it warms."
"Pours a dark amber with an off-white head. Smells pungently of pine and American hop varieties. Taste is decidedly bitter, some chocolaty malts evident but the hops play center stage here, and they are of good quality for those not feint of heart. This is basically an IPA, a good but not great one."
"Drinkability: this beer is quite drinkable, despite its high ABV. I find myself getting over the malt characteristics which aren't my favorite in order to sample more of that great dynamic hop flavor. Good stuff!"
"hmm, this is an interesting one. despite the abv, it's definitely not a double IPA, as the malt backbone is prominent. but it's for sure hoppy enough to be IPA-leaning. drinkability suffers from the complexity, but it's an interesting and fairly unique beer. glad i had it - not necessarily going to buy a case of it."
"D - Dangerously delicious."
"DB- A pretty intensely flavor and warmth make this a sipper/one bottle at a time thing. A pretty cool combo of some flavors that aren't always blended together. Worth trying at a great price. I would say the vine notes keep this one from being great."
"D: I'd love to have several of these in a sitting, but the ABV hits me harder than others in the same range. Maybe it's just me being mellow from the hops..."
"Edit 11/22/10-- Just got a very fresh sixpack and its a whole different world. Hoppy, caramelly, and toasty. More like a India brown ale than a black IPA, but damn good. Balanced and cohesive."
"Another outstanding winner from the great Victory Brewing. They never fail to please. Be careful, because at 8.7% ABV, you do not want to have more than a few"
"Deep mahogany color, fine tan head. The aroma is a balance of dark fruit malt and piney hops. Dark fruit comes through up front, with a touch of sweetness. Slightly vinous malt profile, with a minerally, woody tinge. Hops are plentiful and pervade the palate with citrus rind bitterness and hints of pine. A punchy beer, with equally pronounced malt and hops. For all the fruit flavors from the malt, the beer is pretty clean and finishes semi dry. Another nice one from Victory."
"D: Meehh, this is one with no je ne sais quois, it's just what it is."
"Not bad, probably wouldn't buy it again."
"D: One and done for me. It's good, and I feel like it fits the style well, but it's a bit too aggressive on the hops for me."
"drinkability: They should keep this in the line up. superb.... a new fav of mine"
"Overall, a very nice beer. Worth trying when you see it."
"Overall, this is a delicious and complex beer that really defies any kind of classification. Another great offering from Victory."
"D-Really, this brew kind of lacks drinkability for me., to an extent. I think it's flavor profile is unique, which deserves merit, but it just isn't there for me."
"Overall: A very big, well balnced beer that refuses to be pigeonholed into a style or class (in my opinion) Great with German chocolate cake."
"D - I found this very drinkable. Dangerously maybe. I only bought one at the time but I don't see myself making that mistake again."
"These go down quickly for me. Silky and bursting with hop flavor. Thank you Victory."
"D - OK drinkability. This is a fairly big beer that showcases them hops so balance isn't big part of the equation. I'm very happy to drink one of these, but no more than that in a sitting."
"Overall a fantastic and ballsy strong ale from the state of Pennsylvania. I really like this beer's dryness. It has the texture of a top-shelf gin: dry and smooth with a little grit at the finish. The perfect balance of hops and sweet malts really counterbalance each other perfectly, without muting any of their pronounced qualities. There is a little heat in the finish from the high alcohol, but the ultra dry hops disguise it masterfully. A beer I will definitely seek out this November. I sure am enjoying mine on this sunny, 60F early Spring afternoon."
"Pours a darkish copper with one-finger head that stays around for awhile. A clear mix of herbal, springy hops and a thick caramel malt base along with hints of raisin, figs and dark fruits. A mix of very large hop base that is tied to a thick a malt base for a leafy, tea-like beer that is dry but unlike an IPA's overpowering hopiness this beer finishes muted and subtle with some sweet malts. A good beer that has a chewey feel along with a drying sensation for a beer that I didn't exactly think was so great but enjoyed drinking and would tell anyone to try once."
"The flavor tastes pretty balanced at first. Then the hoppy bitterness comes through and destroys that balance. Finishes bitter but its not pleasant. A quality brew from a quality company but for me this is lacking."
"Served at a cool temperature a clear dark reddish brown with a thin creamy tan head. Smell is rich toasty malt and herbal hops. Taste is chocolate and caramel up front with a herbal hop middle and a piney hop finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I wouldn't want more than 12 oz at a time, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"It surely cannot be a coincidence that a brewery named 'Victory' is seemingly incapable of making anything less than stellar, if not spectacular beer. Like I said, Yakima Twilight has a loud, spirited personality, one that probably takes some getting to know before becoming truly comfortable around it, but that's exactly why I keep asking their beers out."
"Pours a reddish browish color, with a tan head sitting astride a somewhat thinnish body. Reminds me a lot of a porter jacked up with tons of beautiful citrusy hops. Very drinkable, as the thin body doesn't fill you up, and the hops remain fresh and vibrant."
"Overall I'm loving this one... After 3 of these, my wife dragged me to the door as I was ready to slam these the rest of the night.. A delicious offering from Victory..."
"Into a pint glass, pours a ruby copper color with a creamy, er... cream head, nice bits of lacing here and there. The head sticks around for quite some time. The aroma reeks of hops, glorious. Great fruits, nice biscuit malts. Taste is equally lovely, lots of hops, a decent malt bill too, bready, caramels, lovely. The hops come in resinous and fruity tones, grapefruit and the likes. The mouth is smooth, creamy, a bit lively, and quite warm, the alcohol giving just a peak. In all, a quite lovely beer."
"D: It wouldn't be too difficult to down a couple of these. You can choose to sip or gulp, but the higher ABV will slow you down."
"Overall, this is a nice example of the style, though by no means my favorite. The anise taste to it is not a deal-breaker, but was an unexpected twist for me. Still, I'm being harsh - this is a good beer from a very good brewery that is very balanced but still manages to keep some strong flavoring."
"Pours a dark brownish-red color with a beige head. The aroma is very hoppy, with some piney and resinous notes. The flavor is resiny hops and is quite harsh. There is also some pine and medium bitterness. High carbonation (a little too high in my opinion) and medium mouthfeel."
"D- a struggle at first but then it gets smoother as you drink more."
"Overall- i was expecting alil more from this brew. just sweet malt with hardly any hops to back it up. i guess it's just a malt lover's ale."
"they call this a strong ale -and that's just what it is - strong. Produces plenty of head, which seems to be typical of Victory. As hoppy as a double IPA but perhaps more balanced. Exhibits a deep,dark bronze color. Seems just right to me! If you like plenty of hops you should like this beer."
"I liked the brew but, one a sitting would be enough for me. Its just to big all around for more than that"
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a dark amber with a tint of red with an off-white, thin, but lasting head. The initial aroma is of bitter coffee along with dark chocolate, but maintaining a fresh hoppiness as well. The malts are very darkly roasted and smell a bit like oats. The palate begins with the same bitter notes as the aroma giving way to grapefruit, floral notes, and hops on the mid-palate, and ending again with the bitterness. The finish is reminiscent of an endive bitterness, slightly green, and slowly turning back into the familiar grapefruit flavor. This does not feel like a huge beer on the palate, but the carbonation causes a very round feel, due to larger bubbles. Overall, this is a good beer. The alcohol content is very well integrated, and the complexity is more than acceptable. I will gladly drink this beer again."
"Drinkability - This is a world-class beer that deserves the highest of accolades. It must be incredibly difficult to pull off this flavor combination but Victory did a tremendous job."
"A little too much of a good thing, but great flavors for the IPA enthusiast."
"I love the color on this beer, a deep ruby amber color with big sandy brown head. Decent lacing, good retention. Smell is robust, with some spicy and sweet malt notes and some grassy and citrusy hops. Barleywine-esque. Taste follows, reminds me a little of what I would imagine 75% Arrogant Bastard and 25% Double Bastard would be like. Big malty flavors, a fair amount of caramel and lightly roasted notes. Earthy hops follow, grassy and herbal. A fair amount of bitterness here. Full-bodied and creamy, definitely a sipper, though a nice one at that. Good stuff here from Victory, one of the best value breweries, IMO."
"Drinkability: I like this much better than Arrogant Bastard as it is not as sticky but has a great flavor profile"
"Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit lighter than you might expect but it works well overall. The brew goes down well and is generally pretty easy to drink. Nice."
"I had this on tap and found it to be a very good beer. I think I liked the bottle even better. A little darker than i expected but overall a great beer. Good aroma, great flavor, very impressive mouthfeel and quite drinkable, particularly for a beer with that abv."
"A dark copper red color pour with a big long lasting foamy white head , leaving lots of lacing all the way down , lively carbonation , a very nice looking beer ! Aroma is of sweet toasty caramel malt balanced well with a nice amount of citrus and piny hope notes , a little spicy . Flavor is a lot like a IIPA citrus hops to a nice caramel mixed with an earthy spruce hop flavor , nice level of bitterness nice balance , the lively carbonation gives it a lighter mouthfeel than you would expect , full body , slight warming effect , with a hoppy finish covering a ever so slight bit of alcohol . Very good , drinkable , and enjoyable all around . Nice work !"
"This makes for an interesting comparison to Arrogant Bastard actually, as they have some similarities despite some key differences. The profile of the former seems better integrated, but Yakima seems more full of fresh hop flavors...so it would depend what you are in the mood for."
"D: One of the most unique brews I have had from Victory, but one of the best. This beer is a beast, but it's very easy to drink."
"Overall this is one of my favorite styles of beer except this beer won't be purchased by me again. Others have compared this to Stone Brewing's Arrogant Bastard IIPA yet, that is an excellent beer and this does not compare...unimpressed yet, many others are."
"Overall Impression: This is Victory's answer to Stone's Arrogant Bastard. It's a flavorful and complex brew. A great beer for the colder months."
"Drinkability: Extremely bitter cross between an English Strong Ale and an American Barleywine. While it has a nice complexity, the bitterness overwhelms the nuances that are hidden beneath the surface."
"A must for any beer fan!"
"A really pretty beer- clear dark reddish brown with a huge persistent dense off white head. Smell is citrusy hops. Lemons. Taste is again is mostly citrus hops. Nice caramelly malt. Some bitterness but nicely balanced overall. I like that it's just a bit on the hoppy side. Great full bodied creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Another great beer from Victory."
"M/D - Very creamy. There is strong carbonation and it is a little fizzy in the finish. It feels a little slick. This is overall a very enticing, very warming drink, and I wish I had more than the half-pint serving."
"Bottle poured into large snifter. Dark brown/purple color, fizzy with half an inch of head. Smell is a perfume-ish mix of grains and pine needles. Taste starts grassy with dark malts and finishes bitter with biting alcohol and hops. This an interesting beer with a barleywine-esque quality to it. Despite the high ABV and obvious presence in its flavor, it still isn't too much of a chore to drink."
"drinkable brew from Victory..."
"Yakima Twilight is a dark wood and leather ale with a huge amount of earth. It's a deep and wonderful experience."
"SKÅL!"
"Its drinkable with a unique flavor all its own. Its well blended, has interesting flavors, and delivers the alcohol very well."
"Victory hits one out of the park here. This will appeal to fans of super-hoppy ambers (ie. Nugget Nectar), malt-heads, and anyone looking for big beers with lots of attitude, excess of character and, most importantly, balance. YUM."
"All and all a very tasty beer."
"D - Surely hides the ABV well, I was guessing closer to 7% until I checked it here on BA. A solid brew, but not a great one."
"My first reaction to this was that the taste was as equally undynamic as the nose, but it definitely grew on me. Certainly grainy, hops, but also a bit of acidic spices. Bitterness is in the aftertaste, but with medium body and light carbonation. Overall this is a drinkable brew considering its ABV, but not my favorite strong ale, thats for sure."
"Purchased a growler from the Whole Foods Store in Plymouth Meetin, PA. Deep rich copper pour with 2 finger head, calming down to a light froth during the drinking stage. Nose of hops, and the taste was a great combination of malts and hops, combining sweet with bitter. For an ale, I enjoyed this offering, it treated me to the appreciation of fine brewed ales, which I was not appreciating until this point, being a stout/porter lover, and shied away from hop brews!"
"Pours dark bodied with a small amount of off-white head and is citrus hoppy above else.Closer to a sipper in drinkability, it is married with a vienna. This is not sessionable alcohol, and I was getting a tad of alcohol warming."
"M: High carbonation, which aids in keeping the bitterness alive on the tongue. Perhaps a touch high, but a great experience overall."
"D - I like hops but I am not in love with it. One and done."
"M/D - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation, rough on the palate (in a good way). Finishes dry due to the high alpha acid content and a nice alcohol warming factor without the taste. Very drinkable and a good, solid strong ale but not something exotic."
"Overall an outstanding ale I would have no issue at all with trying again any day. Simply stunning."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is absolutely massive, and recedes at a glacial pace. This is a very attractive looking beer. The aroma is grapefruit, pine, with some malt underneath. It is rather underwhelming for a beer of its strength. Its real weakness is its lack of any sort of complexity. In fact, I think I would like it even less if it were stronger as its blandness would be more in my face. The taste is a mirror image of the aroma, and equally dull too. There is a noticeable bitterness in the finish, but that doesn't really improve anything. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a big disappointment. I could see how this beer might be enjoyed by the crowd who's only criteria for to be good is strength. But I'm not in the crowd, and I expect more from a beer."
"Rich and malty, I wanted more hops. It's got a picture of a hop on the bottle, for cyring-out-loud! I know it's not a DIPA, but there's a picture of a hop!! Isn't it?? It tastes like a regular strong ale, but a bit bland and new. At 8.7%, it's not really strong. With a one-year max freshness duration, it's blah. Shouldn't strong ales be ripe for cellaring? The carbonation is well-done (as I'd expect from Victory), but it's just a hop-influenced malt beer. Though I'll go with a relatively average rating, I must admit I'm disappointed. In fact, the feel is where I'll take it down a notch. Malt blahness, it's left begging for more hop influence. Kinda rich without significant backing, it feels like a miss. As for drinkability, I will not be seeking this one out again...."
"This beer is a shadowy ruby colored liquid, topped with a creamy off-white head. It's a pretty brew, but the appearance doesn't foreshadow that this is one powerful hop-bomb. The smell is all about hops....piny, resiny, citric, oily, sharp, and serious. It's like rubbing your nose in your homebrewing buddy's hop harvest. There is a little malt in the distance, but it's hard to discern a specific character behind all the hop scents. The taste is also hop-centric. It's bitterness has a no-nonsense intensity, and the resiny, tannic, slightly oily sensations are amazing. There is a little more malt in the taste....bread-crumbs and toasted crackers. The finish is long and bitter. Full body...warming. This is one adventurous beer!"
"Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated, a bit dry. Very nice, easy to drink beer. This goes down awfully smoothly. It would be way too easy to drink 3 or 4 of these & end up totally snockered. Very easy to drink."
"Body is a little heavier than medium. Appropriately carbonated. Smooth, surprisingly easy drinker for 8.7%. Tasty, with good bitterness. Not much lasting flavor, which knocks it down a notch in that category."
"Clean dark ruby body. Tall, thick, creamy, light khaki head. Looks delicious! Sappy hops dominate the nose. We're talking super sappy and piny here. Also getting some notes of toffee, pineapple, scorched caramel, and peppery-fruity alcohol. Toasted malts and herbal hop bitterness up front. Bitterness becomes pinier, sappier, and gently numbing. Caramel cookie dough malt makes for some nice balance. Spicy, fruity alcohol follows, before the pinesap and resin hops take over the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. A very tasty, sappy-hoppy, American strong ale."
"Notes: Interesting how the color is far darker on the bottle and the nose is a bit more consistent. Likewise, an assertive but pleasing hoppy bitterness feels better accomplished here."
"D: I like a lot of the elements in this beer, but it doesn't quite do it for me. A decent offering from Victory though, an interesting brew. I can't help but think, though this doesn't fit the style, how popular the black ipa is becoming."
"almost 9& ABV and tons of hop complexity would stop me at a few. i did enjoy this and plan on trying it again. this is listed as a strong ale, reminds me more of a DIPA or imperial amber."
"Mmmm good beer. Served with a fine foamy off white to light tan head and a little lace. Color is an amber brown. Aroma is roasty, malty, hoppy and a little toffee. Flavor's dominated by the hops, but it works well with the roasty malts supporting and complimenting the hops nicely. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is mainly like the flavor and is long with alcohol coming out towards the end. Be more drinkable except for the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a quick first taste of caramel/roasted malts and dark chocolate followed nicely by a strong pine and citrus flavored hops bite. With all the pine flavor and aroma I pick up, I feel like I'm hiking through a forest in the Pacific Northwest. Great carbonation level accentuates the hops. Crisp, dry finish. The hop bitterness lingers in the mouth for minutes after the beer is completed."
"A good beer, fairly solid. Nothing really stood out, but good nonetheless."
"Received in a straight pint glass, a very dark copper-coloured pint with a firm head that doesn't really go away. Both malt and hops in the nose, piney, grassy, citrus, lots of caramel and chocolate. The taste is somewhat muted after the big blast of powerful aroma. Let's just call it subtle and dignified. Bot malt and hops at the friend and a superbly dry, bitter finish with an aftertaste that lingers and lingers. Good, if slightly oily mouthfeel. Very nice indeed."
"D - Reminds me of a tamer (in aroma/flavor) Arrogant Bastard but with a more noticeable numbing alcohol presence."
"pours a dark copper color with a big fluffy head that does recede to a tan head and ring that stays to the end..the smell is potent its hops and citrus with a musty peat smell and some roasted caramel..the taste is good its a hop blast full of citrus and grass it has roasted caramel some toasted malts a little bit of semi-sweet chocolate..there is alot going on in this strong..the mouth feel is full and robust with many layer of flavor as the beer warms..another winner from victory who just quietly churns out brew after brew after brew that are solid"
"Overall a very nice beer. After all the hassle wren had to go through to finish this trade I'm going to savor every drop of this beer."
"I like to think of this as a dark IPA, especially when it's super fresh. I'm on my second 6-pack for this review, Yakima Twilight is fantastic. I'll save one to cellar to see what this is like more malt-forward, but I don't think it will equal what I'm drinking right now."
"M/D - Again somewhat sticky but not nasty, appropriate for the style. Really easy to drink and the awesome flavor keeps me going back for more."
"D- ABV in mind.. pretty damn high. Drank 1L with ease. Would buy again. One of my new favorite Victory beers."
"D - really nice victory is in Maine but have not seen this one yet anywhere glad to finally try it. Hope it gets here soon."
"D- Twilight is a bold and assertive beer and makes no excuses about it. Not my favorite use of hops as I prefer citrus a$mnd floral over piny and bitter. However I think this was likely the intent. Not my cup of tea but a solid beer."
"Overall - This definitely comes off as more of a strong ale than an IPA to me, as it lacks the citrus fruit flavors that I've become quite fond of and accustomed to in IPA's. If you're looking for a strong, bitter beer that packs a punch, this one will not disappoint. Try this if you're a fan of Arrogant Bastard, and are curious to try something new."
"Pours a nice dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy light tan head, with tons of thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is big on malts, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with lots of caramel notes, very slight bitterness. Medium body. Drinkable, really liking this one."
"12oz bottle pours a dark red maroon colour with lots of foam lacing the duvel glass I used. Smell is of piney hops, but doesn't match the taste. Taste is of dark malt with dark fruits with a lingering of the hops in the background. This beer drinks very smooth for the alc% of 8.7. Its a very interesting beer and seems to fall inbetween the style of iipa and strong ale. Interesting offering."
"Dark as night as the name implies with a big head of cream colored foam. Tons of lacing and great head retention. The aroma is very strong on the bitter hop notes with grapefruit and dried orange peel. These are both present in the flavor with the addition of a stronger malt characteristic. Caramel and particularly chocolate are present behind the hops. It's definitely heavy on the hops which is why it loses a point in my book. I could have used a little more balance but it's not bad. Medium body with good carbonation makes this one pretty drinkable and the hop finish is nice and super bitter. Overall it's a very good beer I think. I can see some people being put off by it's blend of massive hops and chocolaty flavors--in fact I don't really love this one personally--but I think it's very well made and definitely worth trying."
"This might be my favorite IPA of the 2009 calendar year."
"Hops come to mind first and are hard to look past but malts give a slight sweet aroma, but are in the background. Hops have a floral aroma to them. First thing I notice from the flavor is that the hops are not as big as I thought based on the aroma, or at least give a different flavor than I was expecting ... still pretty big. Malt flavor seems to be a bit hard to pinpoint but give a caramel feel. Slight alcohol flavor is there but well hidden. This was a very nice brew, hops are big, malts are big, though they get muted by the hops, drinks easy, has a nice warming feel, great sipping brew. Would get this one again."
"A fantastic beer that rides the line between stronger American ales and Imperial IPA's. Thanks Stiggs!"
"D: Goes down easily and smoothly. I will definitely try this one again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops. Taste is very hoppy, some pine, definatly way to bitter for my liking. Feels bitter in the mouth and 1 of these was enough for me. Overall if you are into hop bombs, this may be for you, otherwise avoid it."
"D- This is very drinkable for the style and level of hoppiness. Not too hot or bitter. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a surprisingly dark mahogany color with a big tan head that sticks in sporadic slowly dripping sheets. Highly balanced aroma...fresh, sticky hop flowers melding with sweet, dark, roasty goodness. Chocolate, tea, lemon, honey, and pine, all working together. A continuation of balance in the flavor, a dark and bitter creation showcasing the resiny pine and grapefruit pucker of the hops as well as a rich and dark caramel malt base. The hops coat everything in the end, and I like that. It's fairly thick and a good blast of flavor, but I'm craving another so it's not too much to handle at all. Very tasty and well made...East coast style."
"Not gonna end your night, weigh you down, or kill your palette."
"D: A good beer, but the ""woodsiness"" of this beer become more prevalent as it warms."
"Not really a beer I would choose to try again"
"Drinkability is alright, it is a good beer but I might only want one at a time."
"Overall, this is a completely unbalanced hop bomb, but it's fun."
"It is drinkable though with a noticeable bitter dominance coming in towards the end of the warmer glass."
"D - A really well made beer and very pleasing to drink. A touch boozy."
"Alcohol is well masked and no issues with drinkability here. I was expecting a little more on the hop profile and was disappointed from that aspect, but overall a very decent beer."
"The alcohol is pretty well-hidden on the palate but seems to show through in the head. Perhaps a bit of exhaustion is helping it along, though. Either way, this is one of those beers that I will very happily enjoy, but not more than once in a sitting. Delicious, but a bit of a palate-destroyer, for sure."
"D - This is a very interesting and though provoking beer all the way around from the fine folks at Victory... I would gladly welcome again, but I'm not sure I could handle more than one of these in a single sitting given its overall aggressiveness..."
"D-This is certainly a well made beer but the flavors just didn't come together for me. I found it to be too harsh and raw. Not a beer I will seek out. The cask version I had when it was first made was MUCH better."
"Many thanks to Victory brewing co for a another tasty beer."
"The ABV hits me with this brew. I've tried it several times, each time I felt this rather quickly. Might be hard to do more than 2 of these."
"Doesn't disappoint but a little age on this might do some wonders to it. Tried it on draft (missed the cask by 10 minutes) at Victory as well and I don't remember the finish being quite this hot."
"D: A wonderfully tasty strong ale. As always, Victory doesn't disappoint."
"Drinkability: Not too bad -- I would gladly sip through a couple in a night; glad i got a few of these though as I'm going to throw them in the closet and forget about them and see if the hops fade out a bit and give the malts more of a chance to develop in the flavor and potentially smooth out some of the alcohol in it."
"Very drinkable to be so dark"
"Drinkability: A very tasty offering from Victory. Very easy to drink with plenty of hops and a nice Belgian quality to it. Complex enough to make you think, yet not overdone making this beer one that you can enjoy all night long. I will definitely be picking up more of this."
"D: An extremely drinkable American Strong Ale."
"Pours a clear amber/dark red color with a finger of very yellow stained head. There are faint particles of yeast stuck in suspension despite a very careful pour. Nose reeks of spice and pine hops. In the background of the nose there is a bit of grain and alcohol. Taste is spiced hop bitterness upfront with a bit of toasted grain about the profile as well. Lingering oil like hop bitterness is left in the mouth. Yeast and warming alcohol notes play quite a part in the flavor as well. It is a medium feel beer with mild carbination. Drinkability is fair for a beer that is still quite fresh and ""hot."" I will gladly enjoy a few more before setting some in the cellar to see what some time does to these."
"A: A solid two inches of frothy head on a hard pour, tons of lacing down the sides of the glass as the beer settles to a meringue-like top , the color reminds me of a dark iced tea - 4.00, S: Nose is much more subdued than I expected though as the beer warms it becomes more prevalent, some faint sweetness and earthy grain, almost a hint of mint and/or grass coupled with some orange aromas - 3.00, T: The palate packs a solid punch of bitter hops and specialty malts, the hops are green and with a prominent grassy finish, I get a good deal of coffee, caramel and nuts along with a slight warming from the alcohol, there is also a soft sweetness that reminds me of raisins, the hops seem to provide some pine sap to the mix- 4.25, M: Smooth and quite creamy - 4.25, D: A very enjoyable and drinkable beer, interesting union of hop bitterness with a specialty malts, one I would gladly enjoy again - 4.00"
"The brew's flavor has quite a levels of complexities to it. A molasses & perhaps cardamon flavor steps up first with some toasted bread right behind it. Very piney hops quickly follow it pushing the OOMPH factor up a bit more. It's almost along the lines of an IPA but there's a dark fruit thing instead of grapefruit and pine that those usually carry. I can't quite put my finger on what I am tasting but it is tasting very interesting and quite good. The finish then throws in another curveball in the taste with a ginger hotness chocolate notes and rye. The mouthfeel is full yet bubbly and has quite a chewiness to it."
"D - This is a very good beer that I'm really enjoying it's easy to drink this one too fast if you like hops this a beer to look for"
"D - This is a great beer. Reminds me of an IPA and more specifically Hop Devil but with darker, more prominent malts. Until I saw the classification on this site, I thought this WAS an IPA. Drinks really well and balanced, but watch that ABV."
"it is very drinkable for a 9ish% beer"
"Yakima Twilight was jumped to the top of my favorites from Victory. While a bit to strong to be sessionable, I would not mind have a few in a sitting. Outstanding balance with strong pleasant flavors. Highly recommended."
"Not too bad, but not as good as Victory's other hop bombs. The crazy foaming and malt base that doesn't add much hurt this one in my eyes. Oh well - I still love HopDevil."
"The drink is full-bodied with fine and proportional carbonation. A high-quality sipper from Victory."
"d - the intense bitterness limits the drinkability and the flavor, though nice, is not all that interesting or complex"
"Cheers!"
"D - Pretty good overall beer. Could probably use a little bit more body - seems a little thin for the strength it is. Good overall flavors, almost and imperial brown ale. Alcohol shows its presence, but this doesn't feel like an 8.7% beer. Pretty smooth for what it is - a couple in a session is quite possible. Thought I mised out on this one, glad to come across this accidentally at the local beer store."
"The beer has a moderate body, perhaps a bit light for it's high strength and sweetness. The moderate level of carbonation might help with that. This beer really grew on me. It wasn't what I was expecting, but by the second glass I really liked it. I'd recommend it, but don't expect it to be as hop forward as the name and label suggest."
"I like Victory brewing. Prima Pils, Storm King, Whirlwind... they're all great, however I am disappointed in this brew. I taste a giant load of Centennial with too much 300+ Lovibond malt. (I want to say roasted barley, but Chocolate surprises me sometimes at the roastiness, parhaps sopme black patent. Anyways, a miss for my palate, but others seem to like it and I would say that a little less roasty, more toasty, with a better hop bill would make this beer an ""A" for me. I love the concept, not crazy about the product."
"D: Maybe I don't understand this style of beer.  When I'm drinking a beer, I either want it hoppy or I want it toasty and malty, not both.  With that said, this beer doesn't taste bad, it's just not what I look for in beer."
" D- This beer has the taste of a fresh hop pellet that is full and earthy. The hops are good and has some nice unique depth although malt is hidden under the hops."
"The alcohol is hidden at the back end with its dry finish hiding the burn, but is still a damn good beer to enjoy. It's really hard to pick up the 8.7% ABV."
"D - Enjoyable overall. Harder to find and a little pricey compared to other beers I enjoy. Still, I would buy again when available. If you get a chance - try this and see for yourself."
"Pours gorgeously - a dark clear amber with a nice frothy almost root beer-like head. The smell, although not very prominent is malty with a floral hint. The taste is hoppy - floral and citrusy alongside a toasted malt which is bready at times. There is a touch of grapefuit in there as well. It's at times similar to a hoppy barleywine. It's a medium-bodied brew, although with an 8.7% ABV - still I can put down several of these."
"D: The big ABV of a strong ale and DIPA rolled into the fruity ale complexity and strong hop backbone and finish as, well, a strong ale and DIPA. At 8.9%, quaff one back or age to see where the flavors lean towards in terms of malty ale qualities."
"Crystal clear mahogany. Thick crop of yellow tinted beige. Great staying power and lace properties. Aroma is toasty and piney. Some fruitiness to it as well. The flavor of this beer is very well balanced. There's a nice toasted malt base with some cinnamon bread attributes to it as well. But also some tropical fruit nuances and hoppiness. Pineapples are duly noted as are tangerines. There's a lingering hop bitterness that is pleasant and just a touch of warmth and heat from EtOH. Nicely done Victory."
"New beer from Victory in CT.. had to try it, love all of their other offerings. This one is no different... an absolute delicious beer. A little too hoppy and bitter to have a few in a night but as a sipper and/or a nightcap it's perfect. Nice mouthfeel and great body to it along with quite a flavor punch to your taste buds. I recommend trying this one if you can get your hands on it and you love super hoppy beers."
"mahogany with a pillowy white head, lots of lacing. Smells like pine, spice, damp forest floor, with some herbatious citrus to it. delicious! Lush malts with a sharp but ballanced hop bitterness give way to a creamy caramel candy middleground, and is spicey and warm in the finish. Has a lingering bitterness. Full bodied, dancing carbonation and a well rounded flavor profile. Didn't like how it finished a little sticky, but overall a wonderful beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and with good levels of carbonation. Very drinkable, even if its a strong ale."
"D- Easy drinking SA. 2.00 a bottle. Not bad!"
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a HUGE stiff tan head that decomposes in 3D, leaving a good amount of lacing behind. The smell is a balanced mix of sweet malted goodness and piny hops. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and sharply tangy hop bomb yet it cleans up, almost dry...it's into vapor before you know it. A reasonable remnant of grassy pine lingers lightly coaxing on the next sample. Full flavored, malty sweet, hop monster pineapple grassy pine resin. Way too easy to drink...8.7% ABV is well integrated. A lot to consider...sooo not your average fizzy yellow brethren."
"Seems like the brewers at Victory let themselves go for an experiment - and it paid off."
"This is an interesting beer, with a lot going on aroma and taste-wise. It's fairly heavy though and a bit filling. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a slight burn at the end from carbonation."
"Damn fine brew, at $2ish a bottle, a steal."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Reminds me a bit of Great Lakes Nosferatu, but with a bigger hop presence. This is one serious beer, and it is among my favorites."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Steady carbonation throughout. Not overly heavy but viscous enough to grab hold of the palate. Overall, I find myself really enjoying this new Victory brew and it's a nice tribute to Yakima hops! Give this one a go if it's available to you. Thanks to kmpitz2 for the hand off of this one."
"D: I just can't get into this beer. It's all over the place and I don't like it."
"Drink it fresh, and I hope this becomes a yearly staple for Victory."
"What a fantastic brew! This is like a smooth IPA and is very tasty. I got this in a beer of the month pack and will definitely be purchasing 6-packs in the future."
"Nice pine, spice and sitrus on the nose, the palate follows quite well with agressive floral notes and a big hop finish. Goes down very smooth in the end and has great drinkabilty. Worth the 12 dollar 6 pack tag, id say yes."
"Full-bodied crisp beer here. Carbonation level is moderate. Very bitter at the onset. Strong hop tones, with some sugary malts on the middle. Finish is bitter. Slight drying mouth aftertaste. This was really good. Wasn't entirely what I expected, but it was a treat to drink."
"Had a dry mouth feel, but I really enjoyed it. Great drinkability. You can really notice the alcohol."
"Pours a clear, translucent, dark mahogany. Aroma is spicy and hoppy and just a little malty. The richly hoppy flavor has a spicy undertone and an interesting metallic taste that complements the rest of the body rather than being unpleasant. The sharp, edgy texture has some tingle and a firm alcoholic bite."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. This, to me, is much more like a DIPA than a strong ale. I realize that the strong ale category is somewhat of a catch-all, but this one lacked the complexity that characterizes most strong ales. That said, it was very enjoyable. The aroma was complex and unique, but in the end, the taste was good, but not great."
"I am not really sure if I will end up being a fan of the black IPA, but as with most other Victory beers it is well brewed and will likely appeal to those with different preferences."
"Good drinkability despite the higher abv, a very tasty brew."
"Overall: Great beer, I would definitely go and try to find this in the bottle for home consumption. I'll be returning to the pub to try again. Would recommend trying. The bartenders said they loved this beer, and now I understand why. Great beer, try it."
"Overall: Good overall. Would recommend trying. I could see where some people would fall in love w/a beer like this."
"Is this an old Bert Grant recipe or something?Poured into a standard pint glass a deep amber/brown with a large blooming two finger crown that stuck like glue to the glass and never fully settled.Pine resin and more pine resin in the nose,the citrus is there but takes a back seat to the pine resin,honestly thats all,I pick up no malt profile.Flavors remind me of old school Pacific northwest in the fact the hops in pine and citric form are the lead component and the caramel/bicuit malt is there to show its not 100% percent hops.This is a great beer, more of what an American DIPA should be than what many are,its old school in my mind.Paging MR. Grant...."
"Tastes to me like crumb cake and honey. The medicinal hoppiness strands it's way across my tongue and gains traction, opening into a wild bitterness that harmonizes with the the intense maltiness. By the finish, the hop has *almost* taken charge... super piney but still sweet. Silky comes to mind again. Freaky finish.. minty, bitter and sweet all together. One of the great attributes of this beer is the fact that it is packaged cleanly- it never becomes sloppy despite the big malt bill. Maybe the secret is the insane mouthfeel. Very well carbonated, with a medium body that fills the mouth but never lingers or drags. My throat is hot when its over, and the mouth does have a bitter pucker. What a freaking interesting beer."
"D: Great and mellow for such a hop bomb. I read a review here that mentioned the malts balancing out the hops in a brilliant way and I agree. A smooth, mellow double. Enjoying another right when I finish typing this ..."
"A fine beer, very easy and dangerous to pound. Fresh, i prefer it over Hop Wollop. Cheers!"
"CHEERS!!"
"Flavor and mouthful is creamy...full of spices and hops. Flavor isn't bad, but I'm not a fan of it as it warms up. It gets a bit too bitter. A decent beer, but not one I care to have again."
"D: Good, a well crafted beer. I love when great beer comes in a 12 ounce bottle."
"D - This is a decent beer but the flavors just didn't come together for me."
"I saved a bottle and it has held up wonderfully. The hops have faded a bit. This is still big and bold. Maybe darkened a bit with some slight caramelization and a darker color than originally reviewed. I wish I had another bottle."
"D - The beer certainly displays its strength through the alcohol in the back. You know it's going to pack a punch so you need to show some respect."
"Yakima Twilight is another wonderful brew from the good folks at Victory. It should appeal to wide range of craft beer aficionados, especially those who like their warming winter seasonals to be both malty and hoppy. Love the name. Love the label. Love the beer."
"**Had on cask 2/23/10"
"D - Looks wonderful and feels wonderful in the mouth but the raw bitterness doesn't match the elegance in it's framework."
"Clean finish on this one, abv is not huge and fairly hidden."
"A brew of note, though I think one of these bad boys is just right."
"Drinkability: Not a black IPA, but ... a brown IPA? A deep red IPA? A blackened Imperial Amber? Alright ... it's an American strong ale. Whatever. This is definitely a beer that defies easy categorization, and though it's not an instant classic, it is an interesting amalgamation that pushes the envelope just a little on what American brewers have been doing as of late. At 8.9%, one of the tendencies of what American brewers have been doing as of late does detract from the drinkability a little, but other than that, it was very enjoyable."
"This is not bad, just a little odd. The malt and hops do not mesh well IMO. Worth a try though."
"This is a complex character, very good & tasty but challenging, too. Had no idea the ABV was as high as it is, I'd probably stick with the one."
"Poured cold into a pint glass this DIPA looks dark and brown with orange edges and a full oatmeal colored head that settles to a solid cover with excellent lacing. This brew smells a bit sour with malty peat and cider/orange bite. Very alluring. The first mouthful says piny/grapefruit hops and jumps all over the tip of your tongue with tangy bitterness. There's a slight charcoal dryness which is bathed in this creamy malted hop milk shake goody. It's very smooth yet keeps a steady tingling carbonation throughout. I pick up a near licorice quaity that adds some complexity. This is on the edge of being full bodied but is undoubtedly one Hell of a good beer. Hop heads should be very pleased but there is much more here, particularly the malt sweetness. Very drinkable for such a full flavored beer. Another VICTORY!"
"Overall, this is just a big ol' hoppy beer. I like it, but I don't love it. I'd drink it again if it was offered me, but nothing I would go crazy to find."
"It hits the tongue light with the harsh bitterness of the hops and then feels heaveier by the aftertaste. Drinkability is OK, but more than one would be a bit too much IMHO."
"8.7% abv doesn't even make an impression. Also gets bonus points for character and personality. Not a typical hop bomb."
"Dark brown body, light tan head, good retention. The aroma is all about hops, plenty of pine and citrus, grapefruit in particular. The flavor is where this beer really comes into its own. The darker malt provides a flavor a cocoa powder and caramel front, though hops promptly sweep in. Grapefruit and pine again here. The hop flavor is intense, like I tore open a bag of hop pellets and started gnawing down on them. Plenty of bitterness, some astringency too. These black IPAs sure are trendy. Between Stone, BrewDog, Victory, Odell and Beer Here plus upcoming offerings from Alaskan and others, I expect Dark IPAs will make there mark all across the craft beer industry. Power to them."
"overall a hit for victory...i do not like all of their beers but every once in a while the knock one out and this is it.."
"A huge creamy head with good lacing. The color is a deep amber brown. It has a good roasted malt aroma with a bit of chocolate. The bitter hops kick in early but the sweet malt is also there around the edges of the tongue. Lots of roasted flavors throughout. Under it is a bit of floral notes and a hint of grapefruit. The alcohol (8.7%) kicks in mid-tongue through the back. It leaves an oily coating in the mouth with residual flavors of the roasted malt and hops. Lots of flavor and very well crafted. An excellent big beer."
"Pours dark, almost maple syrup in color. Good head that retains and laces nicely. The smell is reminiscent of Christmas trees. Might be the same smell/taste experienced by Clark Griswald in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as he opens the family tree. Lots of sap in here! Anyhow, aftertaste is a little harsh at first but smoothes out nicely as it goes down. I like this better than many of the hoppy pale ales out there since the dark malts help to smooth it out a bit. Recommended if you want a hoppy adventure from Victory."
"drinkability: fine"
"D: A good brew overall but comes off as a bit harsh. Still, it's good to see Victory trying some new stuff as their lineup prior to 2009 was pretty traditional. Wih their Wild Ale and now Yakima Twilight, they are plowing new ground with their brews which will be a good thing. Yakima Twilight isn't a home run but is at least a double and signals a more exploratory nature to Victory's future endeavors."
"I first had this on cask at Victory at the end of November. Bought a case upon arriving home for Winter break between semesters, and poured a beer for my dad and me. Color is a dark ruby red when held up to a light source. The head bubbly and forms quickly into a rather robust topping. Smell is of fresh, clean cascade hops with a subtle hint of malt -- I suppose this is to be expected. Very drinkable if you like IPA's."
"Pours a brownish color, maybe a deep red, with bright ruby highlights. The beer is crystal clear, and the head pours to be enormous, I was barely able to fit a 12 oz bottle into a 20oz glass because of the head. The bubbles are clingy, but still a little loose, and they are quite cavernous as the head starts to fall back. Really, a brilliant looking beer. Smells like citrusy hops, with some grapefruit and orange notes, but with more sweetness and less rindy smells than an IPA, but similar hop profile. There's a nutty, raisiny note in the background, with a hint of caramel/cola. Nice balance, overall, good smells. The bitterness really comes through in the flavor, resinous bitterness. Really polleny and leafy, which I kind of expected - but it's not quite what I was wanting to taste. Raisins and toffee come through in the taste, with some esters, and a hint of peachy alcohol. It comes across as a sharp, almost astringent, tea. I'm somewhat interested in the taste, but it just isn't doing it for me overall. The carbonation is moderate, not sharp, there's no sting, but it's present. The body is kind of medium, maybe thinned out by the alcohol. Still, I could be happy with this. But the drinkability is not incredible. I think the alcohol is a little too much at this point, though I would guess that the somewhat interesting hoppiness would fade as well as the peachy alcohol faded. I think this is a decent beer, but probably not one I would go to again."
"I've been on the fence about buying this because I've never really been impressed with anything from Victory except for fresh Hop Wallop. This beer isn't bad, but it's not really tipping my interest. With that in mind I will have a few more tonight because I have nothing else I want to crack open."
"D - i really love the taste of this, but its certainly not subtle at all and is actually a bit hindering to the drinkability."
"Victory for Victory! A wonderment of scrumptious hops and a wet dream for hopheads. Yum!"
"Scary how hidden the alcohol is in this guy. I really liked this beer and therefore found it very easy to drink. I'd like to think this is more of a DIPA than anything else. Think Hop Wallop's more balanced younger brother."
"It's kind of like Hop Devil's bigger brother: more malt & hop character, darker, stronger, etc. I've had this quite a number of times on draft and in a take-home six-pack. While this is a really good beer, the more I try it I seem to find that it greatly resembles the Victory IPA family (Hop Devil, Wild Devil). I guess I wished it had a little more character of its own, but it's still a completely satisfying beer I would seek out more often than not."
"Huge three finger head that can easily our over if you don't watch it, very delicate tan foam, airy and dissipates at a steady clip, plenty of sticky lacing left behind above the dimpled surface. Clear brownish amber color, very consistent until a slight fade to orange at the rims, transparent with a flurry of bubbles visible within. Extremely hoppy nose of grains, unprocessed wheat and meadow grasses, not much citrus or pine, any softness comes from molasses brittle, cocoa powder and a touch of apricot, peach, pear fruit, this as much pit and skin as pulp. Medium-bodied, the carbonation very strong and churns inside your mouth like a commercial grade fan. Borderline bitter, here you get mandarin orange and white grapefruit through the attack, some pine and lots of herbaceousness and cereal grains. At the same time, the molasses, honey and caramel recede in the face of the relentless hoppiness. By the finish a pepperiness comes through and, at times, it feels hot. For all of this, it doesn't seem unbalanced per se, more so an expression of a tightly focused concept. If you're down with the message, impressive."
"D: This is an aggressively hoppy strong ale from Victory. Like many of their other offerings, this comes across as unbalanced/unrestrained, which I suppose is kind of what they're aiming for. Still, a beer this hoppy and evidently alcoholic could use a more complementary malt presence. This has good potential, but the combination of the booze and the unbalanced hoppiness leaves its potential somewhat untapped."
"Give it time to rest and really enjoy."
"Had a bottle for $3.50 at Liberty St. Tavern. On one hand, this is a well-balanced DIPA. I don't mean there's a balancing share of malts, but rather that's it's a nice, dry DIPA that let's the hops standout. That said, I wanted more complexity from the hops. It tasted like an over-hopped cascade beer. The flavor is just too much and subtler flavors are lost behind huge, catty grapefruit and pine notes."
"These hoppy/bitter beers just aren't my thing. I like stouts. Keep that in mind when reading this review. Peace in the hood."
"Pours a clear dark mahogany with a huge foamy tan head. The head is gigantic with great lacing. The smell is pretty strong with roasted malt,citrus hops,cinnamon,and bread yeast. The taste is strong with bitter hops,bread yeast,roasted malt,and alcohol. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. All in all this is a good quality beer with a great bitter hop bite."
"Huge thanks go out to SpeedwayJim for this extra! Pours a dark amber, nearly brown color with a large tan head in the tulip glass that fell very slowly leaving some very nice lacing. Can't get much better looking than this! Oh yeah, delicious hop aroma on this one, lots of pine and citrus, with lightly bready and caramel malt background. Flavor starts out bitter, plenty of pine flavors coming through, backed up with a decent amount of caramel malt, and light chocolate in there somewhere. Definitely a big, hoppy brew, but would have liked to have seen just a touch more balance. They must have used and an enormous amouont of hops in this thing, because the mouthfeel is nearly full-bodied, slick and coating. With this body, I would expect more malt to be at play, but the bitter, citrus hops outweigh all else. Nice beer to be sure. It really tastes like a mishmash of DIPA and Old Ale, so I can't complain about that. Thanks again, Jim!"
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Best by Nov. 2010 indicated on the bottle. Poured with a vigorous, creamy and cascading, 4 inch, tan-colored head (almost looks like a nitro pour) - excellent retention. Appearance was just shy of mahogany and semi-translucent. Some, textured fluffs of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals citrusy hops and perhaps a light, roasted quality. Taste follows nose; however, there is clearly some dark malt action and some piny bitterness that comes out in the mix - interesting complexity and character that changes slightly as the brew warms. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive background carbonation (not prickly), and a touch of oiliness on the tongue. This is a really interesting beer. Had the opportunity to try this one at Beervana Providence, and I was really impressed. Abv is well-hidden at 8.9%. Even though American Strong is a catch-all style, I would say that this is closer to a DIPA/Strong hyrbid. Really interesting and tasty; however, at $10.69 a sixer, I won't be picking it up too often."
"Neat beer, couldn't drink too much of it though, seems a little disjointed especially when following it with something like Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous (which I did) which was much more in sync. Big and slightly brutish, it's worth a try though,"
"d- great drinkability here, i wonder why they catagorize this as an american strong ale - victory calls it a dark ipa, none the less this is a killer beer, it's got all the highlights of a great ipa (bordering on dipa) and malty brown ale, i could knock back several easily, i only got a single to try this but will definately be picking up at least a sixer more before this disappears for the rest of the year."
"Burnt copper pour, very dark. Head is fizzy, foamy and is lasting a while. Getting some smokey wood on the nose with some sweet malts and agressive hops of course...Victory. Orange and caramel also come through. A little off balance. Flavor is a tad off balance as the aroma suggests. Aggressive on both the malts and hops and no sign of them agreeing to cooperate. Crisp and clean mouthfeel with the hops dominating the forefront and the end. Relatively drinkable, yet there is something that throws me off with this beer. A tad too bitter perhaps?"
"Drinkability is above average but not incredibly high. Overall very good, but didn't quite live up to the high expectations I had for it."
"3.5 D: The meshing of dark flavors with IPA hoppiness is good, but not necessarily better than one or the other."
"drinkability: very sessionable. no heat and definately full of a unique flavor."
"12 ounce bottles, best before dating of Nov 16 2010, nice looking spacey, tripped out hop cone artwork on the label. Pours dark maple amber, darker khaki head, nice and puffy, leaving a lush thick film and plenty of splattered bits of sticky lacing. Fragrant, hopped up nose. Full flavor and aggressive brew, definitely reminds me of Arrogant Bastard, which is a real good thing. Luxurious mouth feel. Dangerously drinkable and tasty. Notes of waves of dark malts, rich hoppy assault to counterbalance. Thoroughly enjoyable quaffer. Are your pork tenderloins ready for their 2 day soaking? This will go into the regular rotation, another good sign."
"Poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep brown with a slight red hue. There was about a finger and a half of off white head that retains itself fairly well. It has a clean hop aroma with small amount of malty sweetness present. The front of the sip has a nice piney hop present similar to an IPA which is quite enjoyable. The finish lends some nice roasted malt characteristics. This is an excellent beer. It combines some great aspects I love in beers. Definitely one of the best beers I have tried this year."
"Interesting beer, but the difference between bitter and sweet has no harmony in my opinion."
"Had no idea what style this was before opening so I was pleasantly surprised with the copper/brown color and the full 1"" head. Strong caramel malt smell but tons of west coast hops too. Full malty taste but a strong bitter finish. Piney hops are stong and the evergreen taste holds on through the finish. Full bodied and heavy. Totally not what I was expecting from this one but a pleasant surprise in every way. Nice job Victory."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is nearing full. Light carbonation works well for me on this beer. The mouth isnt hot with alcohol. Very enjoyable beer drinking experience."
"Had this on tap at Scooter's in Lititz, PA. Deep scarlet in color with a bronze glow and light tan foamy head with significant lacing. Smells is of sweet caramel, roasted malt and big hops and maybe a hint of apple. Taste is a mix of chocolate,caramel and citrusy hops. Full mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Only a bit of warmth is noticeable. This a is a nicely balanced beer. I really enjoyed this."
"D: I enjoyed it, but I'm not a huge fan of the sticky mouthfeel. I think I'd go with Hop Wallop instead."
"Plenty of hops here - along with dark-ish malt. Rough, but nice."
"D: Good drink, high level of enjoyment but give your tongue a break, 2-3 of these should be plenty to handle. Six pack worthy."
"Pours a mahogany color with fluffy off white head, good retention and lacing. Smell is of earthy, grassy, floral and piney hops with a good fresh dried grain background. Taste brings the delicious fresh earthy, grassy, grapefruity, piney and floral hops. A definitely solid fresh bread like background with some nice roasted grain, granola and fresh bread tastes. Great medium body with perfect carbonation... crisp and resfreshing feel, semi-dry finnish. Excellent beer that takes a multitude of fresh ingredients and combines them into a bold, flavorful and fresh brew."
"The taste is very good. Make no mistake, this is a strong beer that doesn't hide its ABV. The beer is quite full bodied, full palated, with lots of piney, orangey, estery, and grapefruit hop. The hop is spot on in that there is a nice balance between tanginess, bittering qualities, orange and fruit burst, and tight drying qualities. There is a malty base underneath, with some charring notes that play off well with the bittering hop qualities. There is some crystal malts going on in the beer, some bready qualities, but some of that gets lost in the ABV. This is more of a sipping beer. There is a bit of ABV throatiness to the beer. It is very good. L'Chaim."
"D: Could probably have another bottle and definitely would have it again"
"D - This is a dangerously drinkable high octane winter seasonal. I only had a single beer in my fridge but if there were more available I would have been cracking them open. Be aware of the high 8.9% abv. I absolutely love this beer and will be adding it to my winter seasonal lineup. This is one of the best new winter seasonal offerings that I have had in a long time."
"I've had this one on tap twice now at both the Big Pour in the Burgh and at Piper's Pub both excellent adventures in beerdom. Appears a deep rustic caramel amber not quite a black IPA but deep crimson red for sure, a nice thicket of head forms with khaki tan pigments cookin'. Head is dwindling nicely with speckled sporadic lacing. Aromatics offer up a minty, citrus, and piney, earthy mix of hops absolutely amazing with the dark malts. This really blends well some cocoa and dark chocolate edges with those hops and a touch of hidden alcohol come through. Flavors bring pure hoppiness about on the palate, strong lingering bitterness almost a perfume like herbal quality, strong astringent black tea, citrus mint and pine tip accented hops. Mild cocoa, and watered down astringent coffee accents actually blend nicely with an air of brown sugar added to the malt combination. Mouthfeel is slightly oily with ample carbonation medium to bigger bodied a touch of heat from the well hidden alcohol. Drinkability I love this brew, I can't help but appreciate the effort to do something more extreme from their pretty traditional lineup, I dug the first year of the Hop Wallop after that the beer's initial premise has been lost this is what Victory needed to keep us hopheads praising."
"When the beer was set down, I noticed it was a bit dark, but no darker than the DFH my buddy was drinking. Naturally I thought nothing of it... The smell was my first indicator that i didnt know what I was messing with. smell was stale and dry. Taste... also stale and dry. very dry. I handed it to my friend. He tried and also made a face of a baby being spoon fed gerber spinach... This is all I have to go on here but I vow to change my review if I somehow stumble upon one of these and it doesnt suck ass"
"This is another winner from Victory. A perfect balance between IPA-like hops and strong malt profile. Pretty sessionable at almost 9%ABV as well. One of Victory's best."
"D- easy to finish. more of a DIPA than a strong ale. i found it to be mediocre overall."
"Pretty strong in alcohol and especially in the hop department. I'm a hop head, but one of these is enough. I think some age on this will be very positive. Unique beer that's worth a try."
"This is a helluva brew. To me, it's one of the best of it's type. My oly complaint is a bit too much grapefruit flavor, butI will definitely grab a sixer of these in the near future."
"D: This was an interesting beer. I'm glad that I only bought a single instead of a sixer. It's a nice strong ale, but it seems as though the beer can't decide whether it wants to be a hop-bomb or a sweet malty beverage."
"D - A different take on the style for me. I like it a lot but wouldn't partake in its uniqueness all that often if given the chance."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a very good beer to drink for a long time, however I couldn't stop thinking that it seemed like a clone of Arrogant Bastard."
"D: The drinkability isn't that high. I do get a little taste of alcohal, about what you expext for almost 9%. The hops are beautifally harsh, but they limit the drinkability a little."
"For an 8.7% abv brew, the alcohol stays pretty well hidden amongst the hops and malts so it's easy to drink one or two at a sitting, but any more than that and your head will be spinning."
"It masks alcohol well, but it never quite coalesces into anything particularly remarkable."
"At The Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell, NJ: poured dark amber/near-brown, into an American pint glass, with one finger of white head and great lacing. Smelled of earthiness, pine, grapefruit, and orange. The taste yielded more in the way of maltiness, mixed with the aforementioned flavors, and then dissolves to some slight burnt flavor, and then finishes on a woody dry note. A little thicker than expected, but smooth, with only a hint of carbonation. Not a slam-dunk session beer (too heavy and strong for that), but a great beer nonetheless."
"D- I could have a few of these and be happy, not too heavy on the stomach but strong enough that I will be feeling good. Definitely a beer which I will be happy coming back to."
"Drinkability suffers only from the hardcore aspect of the flavors."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $2. Poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a clear deep golden copper with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. The nose and flavors consist of sweet malts, light molasses, citrus-y hops and a lot of em', some resinous pine, mild perfume, white grapefruit, earthy, pleasantly bitter, and not much alcohol heat to speak of. The ale is medium bodied and amply carbonated. pretty nice overall, something I'd come back to each winter."
"My esophagus is warm."
"Very interesting beer- I love the blast of bitterness coupled with the deep, dry malt. Pours very drk brown with excellent clarity, but a short head. Big citrus and strong, dry malt aromas with a pine backbone and some alcohol heat. Almost treacly, but more in that heavy carmelized way rather than overly sweet. This is a big flavored beer- lots of hops and big almost oxidised malt flavors. Deep pine and earth with a long almost tannic bitterness and hefty malt background but never becomes sweet overall. Big andnot thick, but with a punch. Quite a good beer."
"The alcohol is well-hidden for a beer of its strength, which makes the drinkability good as well. A pretty average IIPA, but a decent offering and worth trying."
"Drinkability: this is an extremely easy to drink beer but the alcohol is dangerously hidden here. One of the better offerings from Victory IMHO."
"Good and fresh piney on the nose. Fragrant spruce tips. Rich malt presence of sourdough pretzel. Extremely aromatic and beautifully hopped. Creamy, spruce tip sappy mouthfeel. Excellent offering by Victory."
"such a fine subtle balance worthy of another dip."
"I have not had anything from Victory for a while. Good to see them come out with something new. This beer pours a rustic ruby color, with a good two inches worth of heading. Lots of chunky yeast can be seen floating around in this brew. I am not getting a whole hell of a lot from the smell, but the subtleties of the hops and malt make it pretty decent. Taste is much hoppier than I was expecting. Really earthy, well rounded hops mix with the dark malt really well. Extremely well balanced as well, everything plays well together. It does not come off hot at any point in spite of a pretty high ABV. Black IPAs seem like a sort of trendy new style, but if this one were to fall within that category, it would be a standout. This beer further solidifies Victory Brewing's reputation for being one of the most solid out there. Cheers"
"Full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, finishes crisp. Very tasty and drinkable beer."
"D - good. despite the 8.7% (not 8.9% as indicated above). could manage 3-4"
"This certainly cuts down on the drinkability for me."
"D: I love this beer. The hops are off the charts and the dark malt are a match in heaven. Too bad this beer is already gone. Drink them ASAP. Cannot wait to get this next year."
"D: Looks and feels like a strong ale. Smells and tastes like a harvest ale. Unique, but not worth visiting over and over again."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a well balanced attack of crystal and roasted malts along with a stiff, bitter hop aroma. The citrus character overwhelms the warm malt scent. The taste is decent. It's damn hoppy which is good for me, but the balance is lost and the malt backbone is really playing second fiddle to the hops. It's goes down easy with a powerful citrus hop blast all the way through to the finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an interesting beer. I love hops, but I prefer more of a balance when dealing with strong ales."
"--Retrying on 4/15/2010-- have to say this beer was still extremely stellar and very much enjoyable beer, this was really adjusted up the drinkability higher and smell down tad, overall though this is a really really really solid hop bomb of a beer with great enjoyability"
"The beer sort of exploded when poured into the glass, filling it full of foam and overflowing. Once things settled down the beer had a dark orange/brown color. The head is off-white and had good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Big hoppy aroma. Hints of citrus, pine, and manure. Odd thing to pick up, probably most people would say it smells of compost. The flavor is very hoppy and bitter. I think this beer was once listed as a DIPA, and that is what it tastes like to me. All hops. Hints of citrus and hay with a little earthiness. Alcohol is well hidden and not detectable. Has a large body and nice carbonation. Enough body to carry the bitterness. Another beer for hopheads. I enjoyed it but only one beer a night."
"Quite possibly my new favorite beer. It's basically a winter version of - to borrow a phrase from Sierra - an Extra IPA. Drinks like an IPA with a dark color and a winter warmer feel to it. I'm going out this week to buy a kegerator so I can have this at home all the time - the cases don't last a week and are getting expensive! I'm a big Hop Devil fan but this just adds a whole new dimension that gives it a leg up - at least until summer comes."
"the drinkability is pretty damn good for a beer that's almost 9%. the booze is present, but pretty mellow. this beer has a bit of a split personality... one part double IPA, the other part barleywine/scotch ale... or maybe thats three parts... well whatever, it's a bit confused, but a tasty beer. it's arrogant bastard-esque for a good reference beer, albeit with a little different hop profile."
"I'm not Victory hater, not by far, but why the hype on this one? Tastes sloppily hopped and simplistic to me, but I may be missing something."
"Taste is awesome! Very nice and rich with a nice hoppy and malty backbone. Very rich finish with some light astringent bitterness. Very good brew!"
"Very very solid beer. Right up there with Hop Devil in my book, but maybe even more dynamic in its flavor profile."
"D - It has grown on me as it warmed, but the strong bite of the high ABV limits the drinkability."
"D: Considering this is closer to 9%, fantastic drinkability. I find this very similar to a standard IPA. Another great beer from Victory"
"D: A good beer, it isn't exactly what I was expecting. In the end above average, though I found it monotonous at times, hence the 3. A sipper for sure."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like oranges and pineapple hops and caramel malt, with earthy roasted barley. It tasted like orange and pineapple and copper hops, with some caramel malt and roasted barley. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer had a good clean flavor with nice hops and malt, but it seemed to suffer from an identity crisis. Is it a double IPA? A black IPA? Something in between? The tropical hops seemed great for the summer, and the roasty malts seemed great for the fall or winter. Together they were confusing. I would prefer a straight double IPA followed by a straight scotch ale or doppelbock. It was still easy enough to drink, but didn't end up being as enjoyable or special as I hoped."
"Quality. Nicely balanced. But, my heart will go on."
"D - The only complaint I could see people having about this beer would be the big burn (*whine, this beer isn't ""smooth...""*) in the finish. I love the hugeness of this beer, and applaud the spicy, rum-like character in this big American-style beast. At a pretty reasonable price for a sixer, sounds like a great way for me to drink away my sorrows after watching my Illini crush my hopes at a special season these last two games... D*mnit..."
"Overall, another solid brew from Victory. I haven't been disappointed with any of their brews yet, and this one is no exception."
"Recommended...."
"The clear and deep burnt umber body, and a dense three finger thick head, gave this beer a dignified appearance. The aroma was quite mild for a beer featuring a hop cone on the artwork so prominently. The hops that were present were earthy and spicy, and backed by caramel malts. The taste was toasty with a large helping of spicy and herbal hops. Some pine and citric hop presence, but not as much as most others of the style. Somewhat sticky in the mouth, although the body was not as thick as most other DIPAs. Aftertaste was mouth tingling but short. Enjoyable DIPA, but there are many others that are more remarkable."
"A fine ale that's nice to have locally available. This experience with the bottled version definitely exceeded by previous tap samplings. But I'm not ready to go all up in arms about this one - not by any stretch. It's a solid local brew and nice to have around."
"I wasn't sure if this was a fresh hop or DIPA beer but managed to get a sample before buying. Excellent stuff, kind of right on the borderline between DIPA and barleywine, plenty of malt behind the hops. The roasted flavors are a first in my experience too. Highly recommended."
"This beer drinks and feels very smooth with a nice mouthfeel."
"D: Excellent. Goes down real easily if you like big hoppy bitterness."
"Pours a crystal clear ruby brown color with a big tan head that left a sheet of lacing as it dissipated. Big aroma of citrus hop; nice juicy grapefruit profile with a touch of a toasted malt. The taste is of resiny, piney hops with some citrus notes. A toasted bready malt supports the big bitter hop profile. There are some hints of chocolate in the malt as well. The brew has a moderate body with fairly soft carbonation that leads to a silky feel; finishes with quite a bitter asprin blast which is a little rough for my liking. A tasty DIPA for sure, big hop profile. To me the malt was there for color as it didn't really help smooth out the hoppy bitterness. Most will like this but the finish hurts the drinkability for me."
"D: This beer has an in your face hop profile, as is standard with double IPAs, and it also has a nice malty backbone to balance everything out. This beer is very drinkable considering its high ABV. It is nice to see beers this big in 6 packs. One of the reasons I like Victory so much!"
"A very hoppy, resinous IPA with enough malts to balance things out. I really enjoyed this one."
"Nice crystal malt flavor initially. Dry. Strong bittering hop takes over quickly. Rich body with a good balancing carbonation. The aftertaste is loooong lasting, like sucking a hop pellet. A hop head's beer."
"No doubt this is strong and one in a session is probably the right number. I heard that Victory will no long be brewing the Prima Pils but take solace in this - this is great beer that goes beyond the bounds that I'm accustomed to. For this time of the year of mild days and cool nights, this fits in perfectly. Without a doubt the most unique beer I've had this year."
"Just grabbed this one from the local bottle shop in a mix and match deal. Poured so pretty brown with tan fluffy head, and smelled so damn good I had to log in and tell the BA how good it is.This ale is a deep brown with thick and fluffy head. The taste and smell hold nothing back hops hops hops hops.. welll it is a DIPA so the grain and booze sneak in a little. This brew goes down so smooth and rich. The after taste is not strong for the style and the mouthfeel is not as thick as one expects. Victory has done it again, damn proud to live in PA. I may have found my Christmas brew."
"Yakima Twilight has solid drinkability for a IIPA and is yet another good beer from Victory."
"I expected so much more from this beer, and it has flaws that could be easily corrected. This is sold as a Dark Double IPA, but the flavor of the dark malts is almost completely overwhelmed. More aroma hops, a little less on the bittering end, a chance for the roaster's art to shine; this has potential, and I hope to see a more balanced formulation should they brew it again next year. Sadly, this time around, it seems to have missed the mark."
"I've been looking forward to trying this and was thrilled to see it in the beer store. I picked up a six pack. This tasting was a bottle poured into an Allagash chalice. It's a very dark double IPA...a dark brown with amber hues. Thick frothy head that never fully goes away. Lots of lacing on the glass. Interesting that there is a fair amount of sediment floating around. The sediment isn't moving, either...it's just sort of suspended there. Honestly, I wasn't sure what style this was (IPA vs DIPA), but I knew with the first whiff. Big hop presence in the nose. Kind of sweet, too (caramel?). A hint of citrus. The taste follows the nose. Lots of bitter hops. The bitterness certainly lingers. I'd prefer if the bitterness was toned down just a bit. The citrus in the mouth is more noticeable than in the nose. The grapefruit also has me chomping my teeth. It's got a pretty heavy mouthfeel for a DIPA. Leaves lots of stick. It's definitely a sipper. All in all, I like this beer and another double IPA available in a six pack is never a bad thing."
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable. Probably a bit too drinkable considering the alc./vol. I would have never guessed that it is 8.7% alc./vol. This brew could catch up on you easily."
"I think this is a great beer, and a bit unique. There are not too many beers this big, with this much character and balance that are this easy to drink and not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: A very solid Double IPA, or is this almost a Black IPA? Glad I got to try it. It may almost be too much for people, and though I don't consider myself an exclusive hophead, I do love hops, and this is a brew for those that do. Another solid effort from Victory."
"M:"
"Would I buy more of it? - Absolutely. Tell me where and I'll be there. I am told that this may not be widely available up here in New England despite Victory's distribution being quite good in this area. Hopefully that is not the reality as this is a great beer."
"Medium bodied and very hop forward with a lot of earthy, dry piney hop bitterness that is countered by a strong malt back bone with hints of sweet caramel and biscuit. Slightly toasty with hints of hazlenut. The bitterness and dry palate remain prominent throughout even though the malt character is a bit too strong. All of the pleasant dry bitter hops are half cut down halfway through. This beer started off amazing but like most IPAs from around here the malt backbon balances things out a bit too much for me. Still, this is a pretty comex and the high ABV is excellently masked, making this very easy to drink."
"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA pint glass. It pours a deep caramel color with a mamoth, sticky white head. The aroma is sweetened pine potpouri, IMO a good thing. The beer is sweet pine and citrus, it has a ridiculous malty body to go with the huge amount of hops. The 9% abv is well hidden. The brew is full bodied and has a sticky mouthfeel. It is very easy to drink this down, a real winner."
"Notes: I am beginning to think that cask is simply the only true way to experience a beer. I never had the regular tap version but I don't think that it would carry the same look, feel as this one."
"D- Deceptively drinkable for a nearly 9% beer. The oiliness of the hop finish definitely slows one down a little, but not hard to drink at all. A very interesting beer."
"Very flowery pungent aroma, almost lush like a greenhouse. Very hoppy Pours a medium dark brown with a thin white head that's gone quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Very floral hoppiness up front. Some malt bitterness in the back. Lots of anise on the finish that becomes more pronounced the more you drink. Very nice palette, like a DFH 90. Great beer, I like this very much. Great cost/ABV ratio too."
"D: As far as DIPAs go, thi one is very drinkable - the bitterness and alcohol are not at all overwhelming. Way to go Victory :)"
"The palate isn't half as good, though. This is an explosion of pine up front, with nowhere near as much malt complexity as I got on the nose. Some dark caramel is apparent, but the pine bitterness is quite overpowering, along with grapefruit pith. The pine resin really takes over the finish, leaving a mildly astringent character. A rye-like spiciness is noticeable mid-palate. Whiffs of alcohol are also present. Medium in body with medium carbonation, the palate is OK, but the excessively bitter character of the finish really makes this difficult to appreciate, and enjoy in large amounts. An interesting beer, nonetheless"
"D: The flavors don't work well together for me here but its still very drinkable and rather complex for an IPA though not as malty as I would like for an imperial."
"very interesting... dark brown, almost ruby, with a big tan head that holds and nice, webby lace. milk chocolate, cooked caramel, tons of piney, fruity hop all come together to create an almost jammy scent. it's not stout meets wcipa, it's like scwharz vs dipa. taste is hop all the way, and the malty backbone is filled with goodness carrying it all. a touch out of balance for someone who isn't a total hop head. super long, dry, bitter finish. for me, it would be hard to have more than one of these in a row without some food to tone it down a bit, but also think it could really work with cheese or carrot cake or a ton of ther things. fantastic effort from victory."
"D - Very drinkable but not in big quantities."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to one who enjoys a simple citrus/ piney opens which fluctuate between the two as a bittering hop takes over the two. Speedwayjim needs to try this. Lol"
"Pours a deep ruby, nearly brown ale color, with a fluffy tan head. Piney, earthy, biscuity, and sweet aromas dominate. The flavor starts with a big chunk of sweet malts, and fades into the piney, abrasive ipa hops we all know and love. It has a full and chewy mouthfeel, and the finish is a clinging strong bitterness combined with the hefty malt presence. This is a big beer, but it's not overly sweet, and is quite drinkable. Much darker and a touch roastier than I'd expect from a DIPA, but delicious and well made. I'm curious what a few months of aging would do to this beer. It seems like it could do very well in the cellar."
"Overall I really liked this beer and will pick it up again. Not the most traditional DIPA, but definitely worth trying again."
"Overall I find this beer to be certainly interesting, but nothing earth shattering. I enjoyed my 16oz. pour, but was ready to move on from there. Worth a look."
"Overall: Very pleased with this new offering from VBC. Disappointed in price - $11.99 per sixer in NJ. Anxious to try it on tap at the brewpub or otherwise. Looking forward to sharing with fellow geeks over the holidays. Would love to see in 750ml bottles like the Monkey."
"Pours a ruby brown color that shines brightly in the light, a strong sticky tan head rests atop the brew. Grapefruit and pine resiny fresh hop aroma in the nose, YT shows its great balance right from the get go. Obviously hop dominated a rich, caramel/chocolate malt body lay beneath. Medium bodied, great carbonation, dangerously drinkable. Victory has got itself a winner here."
"Moderately sweet up front. Lots of malt character, high bitterness in the back, pine based bitterness. Finishes nicely without an aftertaste. Full bodied beer, completely nearly thick. Drinkability high, I would order it again for sure. A really good DIPA."
"D - The bitterness is just too unbalanced, with the sweet malts imparting a twangy flavor that just isn't appealing to me. Will not seek out another."
"Overall: Should be labeled as a winter warmer because I will surely be seeking this out as the snow drops. Nicely combines two massive worlds of beer being hops and malt in such a way that its chaotic chemistry is awarded. I am not a huge fan of comparing beers but really reminds me some of the Indian brown ale from DFH in that it is a hybrid of two very different styles that is finely tuned."
"D - One bottle is fine, but I don't think I'd want another right after. I haven't had any terribly drinkable DIPAs, so I won't knock it too much for that."
"Overall- Boy, this is good. a 6er of this would be quite an evening!"
"The beer wasn't anything like I anticipated and this is one I wanted to get last year to try and discovered it after the it was all sold out for the season. I've been waiting an entire year to try this beer and it was worth the wait, a very distinct Victory beer. One of the maltiest IPA's I've had."
"Top notch beer that I would definitely buy again . . . I am not surprised given it is made by Victory."
"The mouthfeel is excellent as the first sips really prime the taste buds, not destroy them with a single flavor profile. This is a nice drinkable session beer, but it did cloy during my second 10oz pour."
"Overall drinkability is good for an 8.7% abv. This will make a great ""winter warmer"" for me. A very nice sipper. Not the hop bomb that i look for in my DIPA's but a pleasantly different take on the style."
"Excellent. Recently had the bottle as well, was a bit nervous that it wouldn't be smooth, boy was I wrong! Nice work VBC!"
"Overall I was left pretty impressed with this one. A dark double IPA ? Unique and delicious."
"Drink is good. Although it is 8% ABV it's very sessionable and drinkable."
"D - If it weren't for the higher ABV this would be a little higher...but the combination of the taste (roasted malts and earthy hops) and the creamy mouthfeel make this beer stand out"
"Overall, think of this as Hop Wallop DARK - another great example of why Victory is a great brewery."
"I really enjoyed this on cask last year at the brewery and I think that I liked even more this go around. It's great that this is going to be the new winter seasonal, as the dark feel and festive tasting hop profile on this really fits the season. Plus the drinkibility on this is just KILLER! I'm going out out to find a sixer of this pronto!"
"Overall this was a solid beer, but I liken it to HopDevil on steroids. I was hoping Victory would go a little different direction with this rather than their traditional earthy spicy flavors, but alas they did not. Still a good beer I will seek out on tap."
"Don't drink and review."
"T- Very bitter aftertaste. It has a fruity, pearish taste to it, perhaps apple. Strange hop taste that just throws me off a little. Quality, but not in love with it."
"0.4 litre pour at the brewpub"
"Poured a very nice dark brown color with some nice head and a tiny bit of lacing. Excellent scent, very hoppy (very much Yakima) with a nice citrus/floral nose. Excellent taste, a very nice pale ale with great hop attributes, but with nice and interesting malt characteristics: thick and deep with a little extra flavor from the dark grains used. Goes down very well with a wonderfully hoppy/bitter aftertaste on the tongue."
"Definitly an interesting beer, a dark-DIPA. I would probably get this again the next time its available if nothing new strikes my fancy."
"Honestly, I enjoy this much more than wild devil and is definetely an exciting offering from Victory."
"A delicious dark IPA. Deep brown in color, small head. Not especially hoppy, as the chocolate and malt flavors are very strong. I enjoyed this beer and could have had a few if not for the incredible selection that made my try others. Enjoyed at Novare Res in Portland Maine."
"D- This might be my favorite Victory brewed beer ever. I dont know, I just gravitated towards it and order it every time I see it. Granted the ABV is a little high and this is draft only so I have to hold back otherwise goodbye clean driving record. Victory please bottle this. Maybe it's the appeal of a dark IPA, either way I love it."
"While still a solid beer, this doesn't hold a candle to the other black IPAs I've had so far - the balance between the traditional IPA flavours and the roasted notes is just a little skewed. I'd like to see more brewers take a run at this style because I think it has massive promise."
"drinkability is good. good balance. a bit wacky, but really nice."
"Pours a pretty clear dark reddish brown, nice ruby hue in the corners, very thick light tan head forms, drops a lot of lacing, good retention, looks pretty nice. Smell is neat, dark roast, some honey/caramel sweetness, brown sugar, lots of pine and floral hops, grapefruit, touch of chocolate, quite nice and the malts and hops go together pretty well. Taste is good, chocolate and dark roast up front, strawberry candies, some pine and grapefruit, roast and sweet fruit finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very drinkable. Wow, gotta bump my drinkability up a bit, never would have guessed this was 9%. Hides the alcohol really well and is a nice take on the style."
"M/D: low carbonation with a medium texture. alcohol is felt, not taste. You could have a couple of these but not too many."
"(3.3/5"
"Very nice."
"D: An ok combination of mouthfeel and taste that yielded a pretty easy drinking beer. The thickness of the beer got to be later and helped fill me up pretty good. Overall, a nice drinking beer and a pretty good Real ale."
"Clear, very dark reddish brown with a thick tan cap. Great head retention with lots of sticky lace. Very hoppy aroma, lots of pine and orange zest, sweet tarts, caramel and malt, nuts, brown sugar, very floral. Solid bitterness that lingered into the finish. Big maltiness, lots of caramel. Plenty of hoppy pine and citrus with alcohol in the finish. Medium plus body with smooth, creamy carbonation. Nice texture with a bit of warmth. Very good overall. I really liked what the addition of some darker malts did for this beer."
"d: I did like this a lot, but I wanted to like it more. As others have mentioned, this does walk the line between American b-wine and DIPA. It looks like a b-wine, but I think it is more of a DIPA. Interesting stuff from Victory."
"This should replace (yes, blasphemy to some) should replace the Wallop as their seasonal. Superb beer."
"I hope Victory decides to make it again, it has great marketing value in my opinion"
"Poured a muddy chestnut color with 1 finger of creamy tan/creme colored head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing blotches. Smells of floral hops, pine resin, chocolate, dark fruits, and rye bread. Tastes of pine, chocolate, roasted malt, rye, caramel, raisins, and a combination of citrus, mint, and earthy hops with a nice warmth of alcohol to finish. Medium-fullish in body, though a little watery with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a good hop bite right from the start, but also a nice balance with the rye and roasted malt. Kind of hard to distinguish what style this beer is, definitely middle ground between a double IPA and a barleywine with even some candidacy for Black IPA. A good brew but hard to classify and therefore hard to determine when I would want to drink it."
"Poured a darker brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of pine, earhty, roasty, floral, toasted malts, and some citrus. Tastes of pine, roasted malts, earthy, citrus, and lighter caramel. Alcohol content well hidden. Lacing left on the glass. More on the hoppy side vs. a balanced IIPA. If I had to choose, I would list this under and IPA, although if a Black IPA were a style, this would fit that."
"D - Hard to wrap my head arond this one. There's a lot going on with this one. It's almost more like an American barleywine than a DIPA, but there is also a dark malt aspect with this brew, giving it yet another interesting twist."
"I'm not sure I'd classify this as a Double IPA. It reminds me a little bit of a beer my good friend, Shaun Hill brewed a few years back called Isabella(named after my daughter). This one has a unique hoppiness and a distinct dryness to it that gives me a ""rye"" impression. The lack of a malty backbone is the only thing that seems to be suffering in this beer. I'd be curious to try it on cask at some point."
