4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Let me preface this review by saying this is one of those beers not for everyone. If you don't like hops, or at least these ""Black IPAs"" real hoppy and prefer a more balanced, malty beer, then skip this. Pour a black body with one finger almost tan head that died down leaving some lace. The hops are the star in the aroma as I get earthy, piney hops and just touches of any type of malt (mostly sweet). The beer is smooth, light to medium bodied, taste is mostly fresh, earthy hops but the beer is a little bigger/thicker than average IPA and the malts do come out as there is a residual sweetness that hits me on the backend. To poorly summarize this beer, it's an IPA with a larger chunk of bready and sweet caramel and chocolate malts. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would welcome more sweet Black IPAs like it.","clayrock81","Feb 28, 2014"

3.85,-2.8,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass with a fine two finger light brown head with great retention and lots of thick lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops, orange and grapefruit citrus, and hint of tropical fruit. Flavor is mixed citrus with citrus and grassy hops, mild fruit esters and light toasted malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess; despite the beautiful head, a surprising lack of carbonation in the mouth feel. An interesting take on the black ale style, well hopped, but with a European flavor profile. More dominated by citrus hops and flavor than toasted malt, which takes a third row back seat. I'm baffled by the weak showing of the carbonation in the feel, but it was a distraction. Perhaps the carbonation was all used up in the nice foam? Interesting but not going to be my go-to black ale.","LiquidAmber","0"

3.42,-13.6,4.25,2.75,3.5,4,3.5,"On the fuller end of medium body with subtle earthy hop bitterness countered by very strong malt flavors. There's a bit of earthy pine and resinous oils but like the aroma, the hop character is overpowered by the prominent malt bill. Slightly smokey with robust, roasted coffee bean flavor along with hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, charcoal and bittersweet dark chocolate. Dry and bitter but not harsh, acrid or overwhelming. The bitter roast is cut mid-palate by lighter malt sweetness with hints of silky chocolate, caramel and toffee. The ABV is well masked and it's light enough to drink easily, I just wish that it had more of a hop presence to balance out the malt flavors. It drinks more like a slightly bitter porter than an American Black Ale. Not bad, but not what I'm looking for in this style.","corby112","Beers"
