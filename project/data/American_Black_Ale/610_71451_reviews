"Overall, I'm not sure what to think. Racer 5 IPA is one of my favorite IPAs out there, and had high expectations for this beer. I was planning on doing a taste test between this and Sublimely Self-Righteous, but think i'm gonna save that one for tomorrow. Maybe this beer had a different, and maybe better profile a year ago. I will have to try a fresher bottle and maybe re-review at a later date."
"A hop heads delight who looks for some balance to their brew with a malt backbone."

"Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, sticky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA! All around great balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Quite a unique beer to me. I don't think I've had a black ale that was also an IPA, though I'm not really a fan of the latter. Nonetheless, this was quite an enjoyable beer, it was well balanced and robust. I'd have it again and I'd recommend."

"I give up on the style. I can't get used to it. It just doesn't work."
""

"The feel of this beer is medium bodied with a nice easy drinking feel which is a slight surprise since it is an 8.1% ABV beer. Itâ€™s smooth with a nice aftertaste that hangs but does not linger. This beer has been better than I expected."
"Pours a gorgeous deep black with a thin off-white head. It looks quite nice and true to its style. Scents of licorice, caramel malt, molasses, some smokey aromas, some faint muted pine and notes of citrus. A muted aroma compared to many hop forward beers but quite nice, very unique and enticing and quite different from other black IPAs I've tried. Flavor begins fairly sweet, with big hits of caramel and some chocolate. Moves into slight pine and citrusy hop flavors with a moderate level of bitterness, IPA level, alongside roasted malt and more chocolate. The hop presence is largest at this point. The finish is pine resin bitterness, with some chocolate, roast malt and black coffee. Aftertaste is pine resin, roast malt and black coffee bitterness mingling nicely. A good flavor profile, combining the roasted, chocolate and coffee flavors of porters/stouts with the caramel malt and intense hops of an IPA and doing so in fantastic fashion. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous and sticky with a semi-drying feel and a moderate level of prickly carbonation. A very nice feel that aids the drinking experience nicely. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. It combines the best aspects of IPAs and the porter/stout family into a very flavorful, uniquely aromatic and drinkable experience."

"Look pitch black minimal ruby highlights peaking through when held toward the light, mocha tan head forms thick and lasts quite awhile, fine even lacing strung around my chalice as it dwindles. Aroma has dark chocolate notes, herbal earthy hops, along with some anise notes. Flavor has a milk chocolate, dark herbal notes, bitter baker's chocolate mild coffee roasts in the dark malt notes. Very strange mix going on here bitter baker's chocolate again, roasted malts nearly burnt marshmallows, herbal tea like bitterness dank earthy character from the hops seeping through the dark malted IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly resinous dry finish from the dark malts and bitter hops. Overall very easy to consume a great Black IPA compared to most versions out there I'm usually telling myself this just tastes like a hoppy porter."
""
""

""

"Overall - Very tasty and easy to drink. Has a unique flavor that other black ipa's don't have. The smoked malts and cocoa are a dominate flavor with strong citric fruits at the backbone. A nice, pleasurable drink that im glad I got to try. Bear republic keeps its rolling..."

"overall 4.0"
"I didn't love this beer. It was quite good enough to keep sipping but yet I never stopped and said ""that pops"" (you know, like buddy christ), so... I prefer this style to have a deeper flavor. This is not a bad beer by any stretch so I recommend trying it as it's take on the style might be more up your alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting balance and interplay between the sweetness of the cocoa and bitterness of the hops and the char. This is an interesting diversion from some of the more common styles, but nothing compelling."
""
""
""
""
"O: The Black IPA/Black ale, whatever you want to call it, is my favorite style of hoppy beer. An excellent example of the style. I've never had a hoppy beer I like more than this one. That said, I had this on tap at the brewery, from the batches they were going to send to the great american beer festival."

"Black, nearly opaque, but faintly clear with purple/ruby highlights. It had a thin skim and collar of tan foam that produced long lasting lace and showed good head retention. The aroma was full of roast, caramel, citrus, chocolate, and toffee -- very nice. Citrus bitterness cut through the malt, but notes of caramel and toffee, with a roasty finish, were still evident. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation and faint alcohol warmth, plus slight astringency/dryness from the dark malts. Very tasty. It had a bigger malt profile than I expected, but this matched well with the hops."
""
""
""
""
"Very dark, light tan head settles down quickly to a light lace. Intriguing aroma notes of caramel and hops, taste has a bold bitterness, caramel, burnt sugar, herbs and roasted grains. Mouthfeel is sharp and cleanly wet. Overall, a nice mix of hop bitterness with both highly roasted and some sweeter dark crystal notes. I'm good with the 70 IBU bitterness, the hop flavor is indistinctly herbal and not really engaging me. Aroma just keeps getting better as the beer warms. Not typically my favorite style, but well crafted enough I will certainly try it again."
""
""

"Pours from the growler into an imperial nonic a deep garnet color with a blooming lighter beige head atop,aromas are full on pine and citrus over top of roast and bitter chocolatet,the way it should be in my opinion.Sharp and pickly pine hops on the palate with some dryer earthy tone,some roast and bitter chocolate comes into play as well but he pine resin wins out.This is what I want and expect for the style and the left coast once again brings it,love this beer."
""
""
"The palate opens with a moderate sweetness, grainy, caramel-like and unmistakably so, with a mild bitterness and moderate hop flavor. The juiciness from the hops coupled with the chocolatey sweetness from the grain really does bring to mind a stout with citrus peel. Coffee and cream are prominent, especially on the mid-palate. A little bit of a cola-like sweetness is present on the finish. Mildly sweet and with a moderate pine bitterness on the finish, this medium-light bodied beer has a fantastic creamy carbonation. Unfortunately, though, the palate is just a hair watery. While the alcohol is higher than it needs to be, it is not particularly noticeable. A solid effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As one who has come to enjoy this style, I found this one to be exquisite, cripsy and light with some hoppy chalkiness on the mouthfeel. Great quaff from the West Coast to be sure. As a bear might agree"" Grrrr...! Now Boo-Boo let's go get that Pik-a-nik basket."
"I may have some harsh words here but keep in mind, anything that's hoppy by nature should always be consumed as fresh as possible. I had a chance weeks ago to pick this up. That's my fault. It shouldn't deter you from enjoying this beer though."
""
""
"O: Good, but not one of the better Racers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very distinct, especially with the pine. If I didn't see the color I would almost peg this as a full-bodied DIPA. I like it"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall another great beer from Bear Republic. It reminds me a lot of Big Bear Black Stout though, they are already very hop forward with their beers. They really should have hopped the shit out of this one so it could be on it's own level. A good beer worth drinking though!"
""
""
""
" The flavor has a mild pine tinge with slight hint of char in the background with moderatly citrus flavored hops with a slight yeast fruitiness and light raisiny element but pine and grapefruit outweighs the malt strongly with some pithy flavor which makes the finish seem bitter toward the end with mild alcohol warmth. Overall I like this a lot, pretty great example of the style and I was pleased it met my expectations considering I think highly of the original Racer 5 IPA. I recommend this to those who like hop forward black IPA's"
""
"Overall this is a delicious beer. I will need to try this earlier next year to see how the hops truly are. Delicious beer nonetheless...rates up there with Odell, Stone, Uinta, and Firestone Walker's versions. Recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After I poured this into a glass I checked to make sure it was an IPA. Yep...First thought after the first taste was chocolate. Very satisfying after taste pleasantly lingers. This one I will keep to myself unless it is a special occasion. Perfect beer to drink when the Longhorns are winning...gotta love it!"
"Overall - I'll need to revisit this when it's fresh. Not bad, but certainly not what it should be, I'd hope."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/30/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers.

"Solid black in appearance with a fair tan head that breaks up to a firm ring leaving a solid trail of lace. The aroma brings out intense brown bread charcoal malt and vegetable pine hops with a minty grass edge. Nutty and leafy malt and hops jump out on the flavor. These a sharp pine idea here so the hops definitely come forward. It seems a touch astringent in a sort of chemical sense after a while but generally it holds up well. The body is medium or better and the feel is fairly chalky dry with tiny bubble providing an effective carbonation. This was enjoyable although it faded on me a bit with the hop recipe here."
"O: Excellent brew â€“ complex flavors and aromas and enough alcohol to make it interesting."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"o: A style I tend to avoid, but I really took to this one. I think this drinks more like a hoppy syout than other Cascadian Black whatever whatevers I've tried. Regardless of why I liked it so much, the point is that I did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad to spot it and give it a try. Well worth seeking out."
""
"O: This beer doesn't seem to be as roasty and bitter compared to other beers in the style but is pleasant to drink in its own regard and has good drinkability."
""
""
""

""

"Tan single finger head without much retention on a nice red tinged deep black body. Very nice actually. Coffee, roasted malts, earthy hops and orange citrus for the aroma. Flavor of earthy hops nicely balanced with roasted malts although neither is especially memorable but the combination is excellent. Medium body, moderate carbonation and semi dry finish related to the coffee."

"4.5/5"
""
""

"The flavor mimics the positive aroma. The malt is dark in flavor, but without any burnt elements. I'm reminded of unsweetened cocoa (no milk). The bitterness is more pronounced in the swallow and lasts a while in the aftertaste, but it isn't overbearing. The body leans to the thin side, but the carbonation is appropriate. Overall, this is an extremely well-crafted, well-balanced beer. It would be very easy to keep drinking this one all afternoon."

"O - Chocolate up front then a hop punch in the finish. Not my favorite style, but I enjoyed this one."

"Black Racer is good beer. Itâ€™s one hell of a bitter, hoppy Black IPAâ€¦thatâ€™s for sure. If youâ€™re looking for balance here, keep looking. Having said that, it is tasty beer. Really tasty. Easy recommendation."
""
""
""
"My pour netted a dense finger of light-brown head with good retention as the light faded in the gloaming. Color was cola-brown with light penetration only at the edges. Nose was roasty and smoky with an underlying mintiness from the hops. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was liquid Andes chocolate-mint candy! Finish was liquid York Peppermint Patty. Taste the sensation while it is still available in limited release. This was probably one of the best of this style, IMHO."
""
""
"Had it again at the first ABS meeting (second season) bottled, man this beer is awesome. I can tell my palate continues to evolve, I love this one even more the second time around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is another good offering from Bear Republic. It falls short of the best Black IPAs around, but I'm glad to see it on the shelves here."
""
""
"Overall - I was really excited for this one.. but I expected more juiciness/hops/west coast flavour. These flavours are there, just not all that pungent. It seems more balanced towards the malty/roasted side flavour wise. Still good, just no Wookey Jack."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: It is difficult now to avoid comparing new black IPA recipes to Firestone Walker's outstanding Wookey Jack--and in this case, the comparison is not a favorable one. Black Racer underwhelms the senses for such a strong beer at 8.1% abv. It is not a matter of errors, but rather a misbegotten role of easy-drinker being forced upon it. Racer 5 may be able to pull off such a role, but this beer seems caught in no-man's land."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. A lot to offer the senses and up there with the best of its counterparts."
""
""
""
"Overall a really enjoyable dark IPA. I figured if it was based on Racer 5 it had to be good."
"Overall - excellent black ipa, glad to have picked this up."
"C-"
"Overall: Pretty nice black ale. Another one to add to the lineup."
""
""
""
""
""

"Black Racer has a beautiful pour - it pours a very deep crown with a massive mocha head that retains very well. The aroma is strong on the grapefruit hops, and the taste delivers on that strong at first, but also provides a nice chocolate and roasted malt finish. Very well balanced and composed. The mouthfeel is great, it's big and smooth, and the drinkability is fantastic. Yet another winner from Bear Republic. Their hoppy beers are truly some of the best on the planet. This beer is maybe a little more malt-forward than expected, but when the flavors work so well, I can't complain."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, opaque in the glass, with two finger thick tan head, spray of lace down the glass. Smell: not much going on... rye-ish graininess, chocolate and grapefruit note. Taste: pine, lemon peel, milk chocolate note. Lighter medium bodied, creamy, lower carbonation, but nice. Nothing special going on, but was enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine Black IPA on the top of my list if it weren't for Wookie Jack."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I find myself enjoying this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent. I've had plenty that are better in this style - which I'm quite fond of - which makes this a bit of a disappointment from a brewery that usually impresses."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent Black IPA, and very different than other IPAs. It's underrated and mellower than most IPAs. I especially like the balance of hops, bitterness, and aroma."
""
""
""
"O-I continue to have a hard time getting into Bear Republic beers. This is an assertive, full-flavored black ale, but something about this beer is off-putting to me. Perhaps it is the hops they use, which are impressive in strength, but balance strangely against the malts, in my opinion? Or perhaps it is the slightly heavy feel? Whatever it is, this beer (like Racer X) just doesn't turn my screws."
""
"Overall, a decent black IPA."
""
""
"Black as night body, tan head, good lacing. Citrusy nose, minimal roast aroma. Taste is on the sweet citrus side, once again not a lot of roast, close to style. Medium mouthfeel, good effervescence. I like how they minimized the roast, too many breweries are a bit heavy handed. Easy drinking, I wonder how this is a bit fresher..."
""
""
"Poured at The Top in Gainesville. Black pour with super thin white head. Aroma of dark roasted malt and pine hops. Pretty straight forward aroma. Flavor follows aroma exactly, buy with a thickness to the beer I was not expecting. Hops cut through the thick, somewhat chocolatey, malt making it pretty easy drinking. Nicely done black ipa, but outside of Wookey Jack this style can only excite me so much."
""
""
"O: Obsessed with the IPA, the west coast continues to spew out variations to keep the public interested. This Black IPA lacks malt complexity and sports an average hop profile. Overall, a lackluster offering from Bear Republic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a pretty good black IPA, I guess. I'd like a more hoppy nose, and a more hoppy taste. Basically I would like a little more IPA in this blend, but it's pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a solid black IPA. The scent was good, the taste was better, and the body was great. The finish was smooth with well hidden alcohol, so it was easy to drink. Yum."
"O - It's really hard to go wrong with this style."
""
""
"22oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of khaki head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is roasted malts, sweet grapefruit, pine, some chocolate and earth notes. The taste is more of that sweet grapefruit and citrus along with roasty chocolate. Slightly bitter pine along with dark chocolate towards the end. Smokey, roasted malts at the finish. Mild alcohol presence. Somewhat of a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is a nice balance of hops and the chocolatey, roasted malts. Overall, a well crafted Black IPA worth seeking out."
"O- A unique take on the Black IPA. Not as amazing as Bear Republic's other offerings but still quite tasty."
"This is an above average black IPA. It's not the best in its category, but it's interesting. I would have expected a more intense hoppy presence from Bear Republic. But the hops here are pretty good. My only complaint with this beer is the weird, vegetal, burnt popcorn-like aroma (which slightly impacts the taste). Regardless, this is definitely worth a try. I'd be surprised if this is a limited, brewed-once beer."
""
""
""

""
""

""

"O: A wonderful beer that comes highly recommended. Interesting, drinkable, and -- most importantly -- tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Super enjoyable brew, maybe not the best hot weather beer, but enjoyable."
""
""
"O: Really nice and hope to see this one more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It seems this is a style that will promise forever, and never deliver. I'm always looking for that strong hop punch combined with a solid, well developed roasted malt backbone. I've yet to find it, and frankly I don't know that I ever will. I don't know that it's possible for those two extremes to cohabitate in the same beer. This one had the right balance, but missed the ideal strength of either end. It's not bad, but it's fairly muddled. I don't know that I'd give this one another go."
""
"O: as far as ""American Black Ale""s go, this is one of the more enjoyable I've had... much more malt-forward (which I love) but with more than enough hops to balance yet not go overboard"
""
""
""
"O: One of the best most hop forward black ipas I've had. Could hardly tell this wasn't a normal dipa."
""
"Overall it's a shame this is a limited thing it's a very smooth IPA with some roasty compliment taste. Nothing offense, or light about it just a damn good beer."
"22oz bottle $6.99? Dark brown that is almost black but not quite. Aroma of dark malts, bit of citrus. Flavor is more dark malts and slight bit of orange, hops, meh. This sort of reminds me of the collaboration they did with Stone. I honestly expect more considering this is themed like Racer 5. Racer 5 is much better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a decent beer, really. But I was expecting something so much better from Bear Republic. Really, this should be setting the standard for a West Coast IBA, but it really feels like this is a phoned-in effort, and much more of a follower than a leader."
""
"O: looks good, tastes good and smells good. this beer is a real winner with a lot of hop flavor but the dark malts could have stood to bring more flavor into the mix than just performing a color shift."
""
""
"Overall a good enough beer but not in the same league with some of the better American black ales out there."
""
"Thanks Alex!"
""
""
"Offers a nice deep hop aroma but is profundly lacking in bitterness in my view. A hoppy black ale indeed nonetheless. Quite solid and worth a visit,"
"Overall: I bought this on chance and definitely money well spent. Thank you Mike at Superstar Beers, until next time. Salud!"
"D: very tasty Black IPA. get it fresh."
""
""
""

""
"A surprisingly malt-forward example of an ABA, especially coming from this brewery. Not a bad thing per se, but I was kind of hoping to see how these guys approach this hybrid style with their usual arsenal of hopitude. In the end, a decent, mildly hoppy dark ale, with a boozy punch that you sure don't see coming."
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of a black ipa. Reminds me of some great porter qualities mixed with that hop sweet bitterness we all love. The blend of qualities is very well balanced."
""
"A well made well balanced beer thats easy to drink."
"Quite dark, of course, with a handsome beige head. Pleasantly sudsy in the mouth. A little sharp and slightly slick. Huge nose of flowery and piney hops. Somewhat fruity, but no single flavor stands out. A little on the dank side but a more open and clean flavor for the most part. The touches of toffee, charred grain, and pineapple upside-down cake add to the complexity. Substantial bitter aftertaste, finally. From the 22 oz bottle for $6.59 at Baron's Marketplace, Point Loma Blvd."
""
"Overall, this is an OK representation of the style. Its good, but so many better examples of better American Black Ales out there."
""
"O: Nice black IPA. A lot more balanced than your average Racer 5 or Racer X but still the roasted malt barely has a chance to get going. At the same time, doesn't have quite the sharpness and quality of flavors that I get from something like a Racer 5. Not very bitter either. Good but not great. Feel like it's missing something. I still enjoyed it plenty, it's just hard to follow up the act of their other hoppy beers I think."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, almost black coloring with ruby highlights around the very edges and a thin, filmy, light tan coating of surface head. Aromas of roasted hops, resiny and slightly charred, and a touch of tropical fruit sweetness. Flavors of dark, sweet malt in the backbone, both fruity and a touch of molasses, with a resiny, bitter, slightly fruity hops overlay and a kiss of smoke and roast. Very balanced, on a full, smooth body. Tasty brew. The aftertaste has smoke, bitter hops, and roast, as well as a touch of chocolate. Very layered and dynamic. Slightly bitter, roasty finish that lingers long enough to entice more drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty nice Cascadian Ale, but I'd like too see more hop flavors. Good beer, but second tier compared to others in the style."
""
"Overall and OK beer, Onion flavor doesn't belong in this style though."
""
"O: pretty good. Not great though. Friend of mine plugged it as better than Woo key Jack. He lied through. Won't seek out, but would order again."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid BIPA that I would love to be year round. Doesn't have the hop bit bitterness that racer 5 has, but this is a solid/fantastic BIPA offering."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, burnt cocoa, and subdued hop aromas. Taste is much the same with char and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark ruddy brown with a fine one finger light tan head with great retention and lacing. Nice lightly herbal, piney hops, hints of malt and citrus. Flavor follows, with piney, citrus hops, light and toasted malt very well balanced and integrated. Lingering citrus hop and light toasted malt finish. Medium body with light creaminess. A somewhat understated black ale, but the mellow balance of the hops and toasted malt is very nicely done. A great tasting alternative from some of the more assertive hop-forward black ales. The hops are pleasantly fresh tasting. I like the mouth scourging hop bombs, but I will definitely buy this again too."
""
""
""
""
"Totally black color. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Slighlty pungent citrus hop aroma with graint, charred dark malt and coffee aromas in the backgrond. Truly amazing that these two aromas can shine through in the same ale. Pungent citrus hops up front with dark malts beneath. Flavor quickly rolls to ripe grapfruit only to transition to charred malt and coffee flavors toward the end. Finishes with a bitter, black malt and citrus hop aftertaste. An overwhelming ride for the taste buds."

"O: I love Racer 5 and I really enjoy a wellmade CDA. This is not one of them. The hops seem to have been muted, the roast was moderate but this beer seemed to be sloppy in a way and there was a weird, musty graininess that really had no pop or freshness."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed on tap at the Tap Room. A story of Cascade, emphasizing the hop as opposed to roast. A sipper, as alcohol warming. Piney aroma. Some toothpaste taste, also apple cidery in the finish. 75 IBU Black with lace and some head. Not bad, worth a try, however not the best of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Too highly carbonated for this kind of beer."
""
""
""
""
"Yet another good variation of Racer 5, though I'm not a huge fan of black IPAs so it's not one of my favorites. For the style it's good though, nice elements from stouts/IPAs."

""
""
""

"Finish follows flavor profile to just make this a wonderfully appealing and nice drinking beer."

"O: A rather good Black IPA. A style I'm not the greatest fan of but I enjoyed this effort, not surprising since I enjoy Racer 5."
"O: Not my favorite Black IPA or Black Ale, but one I did enjoy. I was glad to see Bear Republic come out with something new like this. I would definitely order it again."
