"Pours a deep black with a tan head, about what I expected for this style. Smell is.....MANGO and pineapple, wow I wasnt expecting that. Flavor is malty beer with citrus and pine, fucking fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So, it's certainly a good reminder: when a brew is delicate, and full of very deliberate effort, the smallest perturbations can truly create very different end-products."
""
""
""
"Pours a cola brown with an inch and a half of a creamy wood colored head. It smells of delicious hoppy raisins. The taste is of a hoppy chocolate mixed with slight fruitiness and finishes with a not over powering bitterness. It feels like your sucking on a delightfully moist cloud. An awesome beer."
"I like this because the juxtaposition of two differing styles in one beer to me is amazing.  Hoppy and yet stoutish!   Blows my mind in a good way."

""
""
"Great Imperial Black Ale, a burst of flavors and hop bitterness. It has an interesting diverse complexity: earthy, perfumy, citrusy, roasty, floral, chocolaty, and fruity. Simply incredible. And I love the style."

"Had it on tap yesterday and now I’m drinking a can. This beer is very good. Dark black pour. Good amount of carbonation. Fruity roasted aroma. Taste is very hoppy citrus, with some roasted flavors. Very interesting, but very good. Best black IPA I've had."

"O:  Fantastic beer and a great example of the style."

"pours black as night, with a thick, surprisingly light colored, thick head. Despite the dark color the beer is not exactly opaque. The beer has malty flavors of coffee and burned sugar, as well as crisp hoppy flavors of pine and mild citrus peel. A complex and satisfying beer, if i had access to it i would buy it every now and then fore sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"I believe this is the first black IPA I have had. It was interesting. It had a nice hoppy flavor and aroma but with a maltier backbone  than I am used to in a traditional pale ale."

"its almost too much, this insanely dark and hoppy collaboration. jet black on the pour with an obsidian luster and a mocha colored half inch of steady head. the nose is hops, bitter and vegetal, even through the tremendously robust roasty grain bill, i get the hops first. in terms of taste, this is pretty two dimensional. extremely dark roasty barley and chocolate malt make up the front end. its bakers chocolate and tobacco, pavement, and licorice, while the back end is all hops. not particularly flavorful either, just bitter and intense. its almost bitter double jeopardy from the hops and the roast, but the enormous rich body cuts some of that, or at least spreads it out over a longer taste experience. carbonation is about average, but no amount of bubbles could lighten this one to drinkable, and i was certainly thankful to be sharing a pint can. very intense beer, taking black ipa to a whole new level. in the way that i dont need to drink more than one 120 minute ipa, this has similar properties. its a palate bomb too, so finish rather than start your session with blakkr."

"A nice black IPA and among the better ones I've had. It's no Wookey Jack (the best black IPA ever) but it's not far behind. Tasty brew."

"Overall - good beer and I enjoyed it more than the 3 Floyds bottled version."
""

""
""
""

"Rich and flavorful! This is my second out of the four pack from the Surly release. It gets better with every can! The smell, taste, and overall appearance in the glass is great! For an Imperial high in alcohol this beer is well balanced and full bodied at the same time. Never had anything from Real Ale and I am guessing the love of metal music is why the collaboration happened."

"Just when I think I'm justified in staying away from Black IPAs, this one comes along and sparks my interest. Excellent beer. I hope the brewers make it again. Anyone fond of espresso and lemon should try this."
"A fabulous beer and an interesting take on the so-called black IPA. This is as dark as a porter or stout. The nose is a bit of roasted coffee and chocolate, with a hint of pine. The taste is the same. This is a much maltier black IPA than others, but there's still a piney quality that marks as an IPA. Mouthfeel is medium with some creaminess. Very smooth. Quite different from others of its kind like Sublimely Self-Righteous but a great beer."

"It took me a fair amount of time to get into hoppy Black ales but I think I am finally a huge fan of this style. Beelzebub is back from Alchemist and this actually reminds me of that somewhat. Roast and cocoa from the malts compliment the citrus, fruity hops."

"D: A very solid offering...not quite top tier but close. I typically don't like to comment on price, but will here...not quite sure the end result can justify the $20 for a 4-pack."

""
""
""
"I'm not going to do a full review, but wanted to say, as others have, that this is a very balanced version of a black IPA. It's a good beer, and the strong hoppy taste (you get a LOT on the nose) blends well with the smoky malt, but at $18.99 a 4-pack, it's just too expensive. I purchased once because I was curious (it's gotten good reviews and I love both FFF and Surly), but I can't see myself dropping another $20 on a 4-pack of this. For fans of black IPAs, I'd assume this'll be a real hit, though."

"This is pretty good. The front of this is a phenomenal balance of hoppiness and toasted malt. If this could be the balance and complexity of the front, I'd love it to death. This is easily one of the better black IPA's I've had, but it would be perfect if the toasted malt were more prevalent throughout."

"Blakkr pours black with a nice lacing tan head. There is a very bold and prominent hoppy aroma, with hints of burntness. The taste is very strong, rich burnt malty flavors, with a nice bold hoppy flavors, and good hints of a sweet pineapples. Good bold flavors, nice feel, good aftertaste. Overall very good, the only knock is it may be just a tad too sweet."
""
"Overall: Surprised by the high ABV here and the flavors create a quite challenging blend; still, as ABAs go, this is a good one"
""
"I'm sure they would say that the ingredients used cost more and that sticker price is what it takes to produce the beer and make a small profit. That's all fine and good and I'm happy I tried it, but I won't have it again... unless someone else is buying..."

"They scorched the crap out of me with this one, it tasted quite good nonetheless."
"So after the third or fourth sip, I HAD to look it up online on my Phone and when I saw the ABV of 9.99% I could not believe it!! NO WAY this beer’s ABV is 9.99%!! I sure could not taste the alcohol, so it must be very well hidden. Anyway, very yummy stuff, and I did feel tipsy after one snifter - I'll be buying more of this..."

"O - This hoppy black ale is delicious with a coffee and creaminess that is hopped up in a big way. Different from other hoppy black ales and damn good!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge contrast between what's on the nose and the flavors presented on first sip. Really unexpected and quite a surprise. Really impressed by this one and a real unique beer in the black IPA realm."
"O-Overall oh my gosh this was an impressive black IPA so smooth love the cask"
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, great cross between a Imperial Stout an a DIPA, one of the better ones I have had that is for sure."
"The beer is dark brown with a mild haze and a quarter inch of tan head. The aroma offers roast, smoke, charred malt, a hint of chocolate, resinous hops. Nice flavor, with everything flowing harmoniously. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Lingering hops with a light bitterness in the finish. While I'm not typically a big fan of this style, I found this beer unique and enjoyable."

"O) This is a really good brew... Right up there with Black Top from New Glarus as far as I'm concerned. Glad to recommend."
""
""

"Edit: tried another can and it was a much hoppier brew the second time. Not sure what happened to the first can butt his one is much, much better. Grade upped from a 3.66."

"Superb offering of this particular style. Blakkr is Bawesome!"
""

"Overall I REALLY like this beer as I love Abrasive and it has many of the same charactoristics. This is not usually a style I like but I really love it as it reminds me of Abrasive."

"The pour is densely black with a strong 3 finger head. Aroma is ripe grapefruit mixed with a rich, roasted aroma, bit of chocolate also. Flavor and feel is smoother than expected, juicy hops that segues into creamy coffee. Goes from bitter to a creamy sweetness."
"Overall - Black IPAs need to be very good. This is good, but doesn't stand out."
""
"In a lot of ways, this beer is very similar to Surly's Abrasive Ale, which is a 100 beer rated beer, hence, my lack of understanding for the low ratings. With all said, it's basically Abrasive Ale, with some roastiness to it, and a slight hint of stout qualities... just very very good. I know there's a Surly Overrated IPA, I'd call this Surly's UNDERrated IPA!"
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a light tan head, light lace. Nose of pine and grapefruit, char and roast malt, bitter chocolate. Flavor is more straight forward IPA like with piles of pine and citrus bitterness, very light dark chocolate and a bitter pine and mild ash finish. Medium thick, high carbonation, chewy finish."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A good hop bomb for sure, but it's all IPA. There was really no need to make this beer dark brown, as any kind of roasted or chocolate flavors that would be produced by these dark grains were not allowed to come out and play anyways. The trick with a hoppy black ale is to hop it up, but show just the right amount of restraint so the character of the dark grains can play a role in the flavor profile as well. That didn't happen here. Might as well just make a regular hop bomb DPA and call it Ornggr. A good beer that we enjoyed, but not representative of the style."

"Overall, I'm glad I got to try it, but I doubt I'd be able to drink it all the time. Of course, making a big bruiser of a beer seems like what they were going for (the can calls it ""crushing""), so I'll give it a little extra in the score. Thanks to roostor07 for the can!"
""
"O- I didn't love this, I graded to the style; only having maybe 5 or so Black IPA in the past. This was by far the best one that I have had though. Big thanks to Mike for this one! Great experience!"
""
""
""
""
""
"There are very few offerings in this style that do it for me and even though I love Surly, Blakkr is not one of them. Just too aggressive and bold with too much happening. Certainly representative of the style but I'm just not a big fan."
"O- much better execution of what I imagine a double black IPA to taste like. Far better than Three Floyds' take on this beer."

"On tap at Denver Bicycle Cafe. Was very excited to try this beer. I don't usually go for black IPA's, but having heard such good things about this one I decided that I had to get some. Very well balanced. The hops are out front but not offensive. Roasted coffee flavors from malt worked well with the hop profile. Very dry. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good Black IPA. Hop notes are what I prefer, more citrus-forward with pine backing that up. Maltiness is nice as well, not overbearing but still present with flavors of cocoa and coffee and roast. Overall well-executed and fairly unique."

"This is very good beer from three very good breweries. I tried a can cold and tried one warm. Cold it is a good beer but at room temp this beer shines. You get more flavor at room temp and I think that is the way to drink it, let it warm up a little bit and the flavors meld a lot better. Either way its a good beer but so good letting it breathe and warm up a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good. Super thick body is cut with mild carbonation. Lots of sticky hop oils and resin along with an aggressive bitterness."

"O: i'm pretty happy and excited that this collab happened specially here in Texas where so many collabs are occuring right now and the craft beer scene is growing like never before. This is an incredibly enjoyable black ale, since it feels more like it than an IPA, it takes the roastiness from the ABA and the hop power from the IIPA to make a great showcase for the beer style and the hops used in it. Loved the huge hop aroma that emanates from it, but not so much the dryness of the beer. It's a definite repeat, but one for the night seems like enough."
""
""
""
"Coming together from three different locations has got to make it a little difficult to put together a masterpiece I'm sure. But this beer is a very solid Black IPA. Glad to finally see a Surly and a Three Floyds brew in Texas"
""
""
""
"A very nice dark IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As stated above, I'm not the biggest fan of this style, but it's up there as far as the ones I've had. Not on par with wookie jack or Stone's 15th anni, but solid."
""
"The flavor is just as intense with soapy resinous bitterness up front, chocolate follows and is killed off completely by grapefruit citrus wall of hops. This is a nice medium to full bodies roasty, super bitter beer with medium carbonation. Definitely lives up to the name, and the mental hype I have it as soon as I heard they were doing a black metal collab. This is insanely good and tops Wookey jack as my favorite black ipa."
"O- Another great DIPA from breweries known for great DIPA's. But not too different and innovative."
""
"Final Thoughts: Wow, was skeptical going in but definitely an amazing beer. My favorite beer is Abrasive and Blakkr could easily be its cousin. The nearly $18 price point may seem steep but this beer is worth it. This should definitely be a yearly release. Phenomenal. Would I drink it again? Duh."
""
""
""
"O: solid black IPA. Great collaboration effort."
"Really good for the style, but in my opinion, not on the level of, say, Stone's versions. The hops don't blend quite as well as they could, and the flavor is fairly simple. It's like a toned-down black version of Abrasive. That could be amazing, but it's merely good."
""
""
"If you can find any version of this get it. Surly, FFF and Real Ale in Blanco, TX have the same recipe."
"O- A great black IPA that is both smoky and hoppy."

"Great Black Ale. The bottle was 12.99 i believe. I definitely enjoyed it and would drink again. if you get a chance to pick this up, do it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not completely sold on the black IPA's yet. I thought this was a good example of the style, but at the end of the day I'd sooner just grab an abrasive!"

"Pours nearly pitch black capped by an off white one and half finger head. Average retention, fairly significant splotchy lacing. Light wisps of citrus, hints of espresso and roast, touches of burnt chocolate malt, and perhaps even a bit of toffee on the nose. Opens with light caramel notes and light cocoa powder. Tropical fruit accents join in including pineapple and mango. Caramel and toffee accented maltiness is joined by bold passionfruit. Transitions into bitter citrus rind which give way to espresso-tinged bitterness and clean alcohol. Well carbonated, lighter to average medium body that is smooth with a touch of creaminess here and there. One of the better brews in the style. Having enjoyed Three Floyds version previously, I actually prefer Surly's version just a bit more."

"Overall, a hypnotic collaborative from three heavily-hyped breweries. Love the can art. Love the tart fruit on the front end. Love the complexity and long, steady finish that dissipates into a wine-like dry-roast acidity. The aftertaste is the lingering aftermath of a rich brunch washed down by the last sip of orange juice (mixed 50/50 with Cava?). Blakkr is the best Black IPA I've tasted to the date of this review. I feel bettr about the future of this hybrid category after having drank this beer."
"When I popped the top I was wondering if Blakkr would be revelatory or disappointing, & at the Final Countdown, it was neither. I do really like the hoppy twist on the style; a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad at all. Black IPA's, Cascadaian Dark Ale's, whatever you want to call them, normally don't overly excite me, but this is a solid American Black Ale. The combo between IPA and Dark Ale works well, and neither component overpowers the other. Good, but not worth the price of admission ($19 a four pack? Ouch!)."
"Overall: Lots and lots of hops, flavor and aroma. The strongest smelling beer I've had in a long time. I'm not a big black IPA/black ale/hoppy dark fan, but this tastes pretty good to me. I suppose the hops are just overwhelming everything."
""
""
"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good imperial Black Ale. Good mix of citrus and piney hop flavors with a good balance of dark malt. A pretty cool collaboration from Surly, Three Floyds, and Real Ale."
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with modest carbonation. Somewhat creamy. The alcohol is very well disguised, which is always a sign of a well made beer. Worth trying if you get the chance."
"O - this is a beast! But I do have a love-hate for it. Great complexity, great flavors but I think it's too over the top pungent. It takes away from what it could have been. Still really like it and glad I had the chance to get a bottle."

"I am a Minnesotan that won't automatically give a Surly beer a high score. I think Blakkr failed as a Imperial Black Ale, but it has outstanding hop aroma and flavor and is immensely complimented by its body. But this is not the next greatest thing."
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic collaboration here. I can't believe this is 10%. Even though the taste is decadent enough for the abv, it is also fairly easy to drink. I hope this somehow is not just a one and done release."
"This reminds me of about 80 percent Abrasive blended with 10 percent Darkness and 10 percent Smoke. Probably inspired by those, but damn, the hop profile is so Abrasive like. Drinks very easy for the abv. A great take on the style, but does carry a hefty price tag at nearly $5 a can."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a big fan of this style, but had to try since I am a huge fan of Three Floyds and Surly. Kinda reminds me of an IPA mixed with a Stout. Can't really put a finger on it, but I like it. Might work good in some trades too. Cheers!!"

"Bitterness lingers throughout the finish as the pine, citrus and tropical notes are fading slowly into the more roasty toasty blackened malt elements ultimately leaving an almost an espresso coffee like aftertaste. Delicious beer, black malts and all and with a 10% ABV it packs a pleasant punch.. I don't believe I've ever tried anything from Real Ale, but with plenty of experience of the other two breweries I get a sense of the 3 Floyds and Surly DNA in every sip. And now the glass is empty..time for another. Even with -17-d F expected tonight and who knows 9.99 feet of snow on the ground at the end of February, it's good to live in Minnesota!"
""
"O- Not bad. Im typically not a fan of black ales, but really enjoyed the big hop profile in this one. Gets better as it warms up a bit."
""
""
"O- Not a fan of Black IPA'S but this is an exception a great brew with which leans more toward the 2IPA side but has plenty of porter qualities"
""
""
"2/17/14 can date. Beer pours super black, nice three-finger head. Hop aroma is like a subdued Abrasive. Taste is fairly flat, one-note, but has a very pleasant roasty, hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol is virtually undetectable, but sneaks up quickly on you. Hard to justify this over other great options at this price-point, but will gladly drink the remainder of the 4-pack."
""
"Shits good. I like it a lot. Black ipa had a kid with imperial porter and they smoked while pregnant. Here is the result."
