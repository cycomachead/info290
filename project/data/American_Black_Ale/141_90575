Pours moderately murky nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, pine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice malt driven black IPA. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

It settled into a finger of dense, light-tan/mocha-colored head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) and I have to ask if anyone really registers any beer as ""black"". Although it was dense enough to prevent any light penetration in the glass, I could see what it looked like during the pour. Nose had the dark, deep-roasted, burnt/smoky scent that I dislike in this style. I got a faint grassy mintiness from the hops, but the malts were getting in the way. Bah! Let nothing stand between a hophead and tasting his/her hops. Mouthfeel was dense, thick, especially for an IPA of any stripe. Nice. The taste, however, was a different story, or better put, it was more of the same. Man, I just cannot get past the roasty malt characteristic that defines this style. I kept tasting charcoal and not in what I would define as a pleasant way. Finish was dry, smoky, almost stout-like, but where were the hops? I weep for the hops that go into these recipes as they have given their all for naught. Nice lacing, by the way. Next!","woodychandler","Jun 29, 2014"

4.01,5.8,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pours a big, frothy brown head, close to three fingers as it crests, full-on mix of bubble sizes, from huge to tiny, dimpled all over, the lacing is thin but forms broad sheets which cover close to half the available glass space. Black liquid yet has a shiny brightness to it, this in spite of the chunky floaties inside the glass, hard to visually gauge the carbonation, shifts to a yellow hue along the rims. The nose is sweetly roasty, oodles of chocolate, coffee, hard toffee with even more malt after that, it’s hoppy in a mellow fashion, more cleansing than herbaceous, subtle floral lift, not much fruit but maybe a little earthiness. Full-bodied, thicker and denser than expected, the carbonation is slow to unwind but it does not feel flatfooted. Here too there’s a strong emphasis on roast although it does adroitly avoid bitterness. Coffee beans, cocoa, mocha more than milkiness, although there’s moments of root beer and vanilla. Mutter of quinine. The mouth feel is grippy and dry, more pine and cut grass than flowers or citrus. Again, hard to discern clear fruit presence, more apricot, maybe cherry. Because it starts with such intent and energy, it’s hard for it not to finish likewise. Sticks to the basics, does them well enough.","farrago","Apr 09, 2014"

It’s something you don’t come across with every hoppy black ale you try, or sometimes it’s there but it just doesn’t work; here, though, the transition to a brisk, hoppy pale is so stark and refreshing that you can’t help but enjoy it.

Taste is sweet caramel and a bit roasty and chocolaty behind lots of earthy pine and citrus. Medium body and carbonation level with a resinous and slightly chalky mouthfeel.

Solid cling all over the glass as you drink. Aromas of dark roast coffee on a subtle backbone with a heavy dose of floral and fruity hops. Grapefruit and mango blend for the fruity highlight, with a resiny ribbon throughout. Flavors are very bitter and in your face initially. Hop heads rejoice. Resiny and sharp on the forward tongue, with a bitter blast that dries and slightly puckers. The heavy roast and coffee characteristics creep in on the backside of the palate, but the middle of the tongue is locked in to the resiny, fresh hops characteristics completely. The coffee roast flows into the aftertaste, bringing a bit more balance than the palate had during the initial tasting. Floral highlights dance throughout, giving a lightness to the heavy bitterness your mouth is getting hit with. Dry, bitter finish that lingers for a second and then completely vanishes, leaving the palate clean and clear for another flurry of punches from this robust beer. A bit unbalanced, but a tasty brew. Definitely not for those unlearned in the ways of the hops, but as I said before, hop heads rejoice...this one certainly is!","GarthDanielson","Apr 07, 2013"

4.02,6.1,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,"O: I don't understand kids today and I still think these Black IPA are just a well hopped, unbalanced Robust Porter. That being said I like the blend of citrus and chocolate/coffee malt with the agressive hops bitterness going on here. The hops get just a tad harsh on the finish which could be reduced by the use of higher alpha hops, not that I'm complaining.","MadScientist","Mar 24, 2013"
4.24,11.9,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"12oz bottle. Pours black with a rich and creamy mocha head. Robust sticky lace soaps the sides of the glass. This smells of a rich blend of chocolate, caramel, coffee and ripe citrus. A floral and lightly spicy feel hangs on the edges of the nose. The taste is similar, with a robust yet smooth mix of chocolate and caramel malts, a firm leafy and spicy green bitterness and coffee flavor throughout that leaves this burnt and roasted in the finish. The feel is medium with soft creaminess that spreads out and prickles the tongue a bit. Nice smooth feel here to this. This was a really nice take on a Black IPA, with a well balanced mix of flavors and a super drinkable body. A well done tribute beer for sure.","Kegatron","Mar 23, 2013"

3.86,1.8,4,3.5,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours black (more of a dull dark brown held to the light) with 1/2 an inch of a creamy looking tan head that fades quickly while lacing. The nose is that mocha milk stout-ish upfront followed by some subtle hops...hops which are present only after sniffing this brew harder than you'd have to sniff glue sticks just to get a decent buzz going. More citrusy/floral hop profile, which isn't my favorite mix for the style. Word of advice, let this guy warm a tad before drinking. The taste brings that neglected bitterness to the center stage bumpin disco on my taste buds and just as that glue buzz is fading the big carob/chocolate malt base is there to catch you. This beer works its cascade-y bitterness hard on my unsuspecting palate, front to back, working for dollars, but lacks the generally expected roast/toast/caramel sweetness component. It still drinks smooth and all harshness is derived from the hops. Good black IPA, distinct in its ability to slap your mouth in its face with hops no apologies, but I would have liked a bit more backbone.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 15, 2013"

A double-whammy of bitterness offered by each as well. An even more enticing buy at the affordable six pack price.","ryan1788a5","Mar 08, 2013"
