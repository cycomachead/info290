The smell is a bit loamy and damp with some spicy grapefruit on top. And what a fantastic flavor (which is what matters, right?) Very different profile than others on the head, the smell, and look which may be chalked up to the hemp seeds, but I don't care. Fun beer...Will drink again and again. Then sleep and drink some more.","amorpork","Mar 26, 2015"

Smells of slight floral hops, strong piney hops, resin, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, alcohol, caramel malt, and strong wood.  Fits the style of an American Black Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of alcohol, strong wood, piney hops, resin, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, and caramel malt.  Overall, good appearance, strong aroma, strong body, decent blend (alcohol and wood dominate), and average mouth feel.","Tone","Mar 26, 2015"

Aroma is fresh hops with a bit of a doobie character, roast malt, Flavor's somewhat similar to nose, plus quite dry (except in finish - then a hint of sweet comes out), very bitter, some tang. Body is good though the extreme bitter coupled with alcohol warmth yields a strange tingle, while still being oddly smooth. Big beer.","drpimento","Mar 20, 2015"

I don't think this is a beer that I would drink more than 1-2 of in a sitting.  Also I liked the flavors a bit more when it was colder.  The warmth brought out a bit more of the earthy and bitter tones (and subdued the chocolate).","fscottkey","Sep 29, 2014"

I did not know what to expect from this brewery in Salt Lake City Utah, but I like Imperial IPA's a lot and always willing to take the gamble. Jackpot! Pours rich and creamy into a tulip glass. A nice slim head and very rich lacing stays until the the last drop. This is a somewhat boozy, total black beer. It starts out malty sweet with chocolate and coffee overtones, but quickly surrenders to the Hops and 109 IBU's at the finish. This is a very complex beer. Not the best BLACK IPA that I have ever had, but definitely in my top 5. I am now going to include Uinta Brewing Company on my search list when looking for something unique to share with my friends.","Robert_Ray","Sep 06, 2014"

Aromas of earthy pine dominate with bits of caramel and chocolate in supporting roles. The flavor is rich chocolate and caramel malt with lots of earthy pine and citrus hop flavor. Moderate to high level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. I enjoyed this brew. It's just at is expiration date which I didn't notice at the store, but its still drinking really well. I'd like to revisit this with a fresher bottle as this one has lots of porter like qualities to it at this time.","johnnnniee","Apr 17, 2014"

Malt is not balanced on the nose as in some other beers. Excellent taste, hop forward with very balanced malt on the palate as well as some caramel and roasted notes. Very nice.

I bought this in my local grocery store as part of a ""pick your 6"" pack. Admittedly, I thought the bottle looked different and I hadn't had it so I grabbed it. Lucky me, this is one hell of a beer. Nice dark stouty feel with the thickness and hop of a double IPA. I don't know all the technical terms, but this beer is complex and delicious.

Bought it in a 4 pack for $10 (perfect!), this is a fantastic, boozy black IPA. The hop aroma is overpowered by the alcohol fumes, but you won't mind once it starts to warm your belly! The bitter chocolate of the malt and grapefruit of the hops are the most prominent flavors.","EmpiricalBill","Sep 25, 2013"

Smells like fig, raisin, soy sauce, and pine. Taste is dark fruit, smoke, and hop bitters. No detectable alcohol to me, but there are some really strong elements contending here. Overall, a nice stoutish-IPA with huge ABV. Couldn't see drinking more than one of these, but I'd probably get another single again.","BeerWizard","Sep 01, 2013"

These notes all made their way to the flavoring but were pushed a bit too far to the side by the boisterous booze that seemed to invade each aspect of the sip. Thus, at times, it was rather harsh, but enough room was left for the nicer, thicker qualities of the hops and grain to poke through. On another positive note, the label is one of the simplest, most elegant we’ve seen in recent memory, which is partly why we were so excited for this one. Expect a strong beer from the get go, but don’t be surprised if it isn’t as balanced as you would have liked.","TheBrewo","Aug 03, 2013"

Nose is understated and a graceful blending of chocolate and piney hops. The fruit was there but not as prominent as it could have been. Chocolate was strong but not bitter on the nose, looks and smells like candy. Spice character is very faint and the malt opens up with the chocolate as it warms and some caramel and sugar. Taste is round and roasted. Hops are bitter but not aggressive. Drinks dry and doesn’t have a lot of aftertaste. Pine needles and a touch of cocoa on the back palate. Finishes with a bitterness that stops just short of harsh. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a little unbalanced as the roasted malt left a little sour like coffee that had sat in the pot too long. The alcohol really came through as this warmed and left a little burn going down. It was more carbonated than it looked. This was a vigorous imperial black ipa that really gets your attention.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

I figure it should have much more in the way of hop flavor if it has the IPA badge on it, and not just flavorless bitterness. Way too roasty, little hop character (other than bitterness). Even if the hops were more present, the flavor combination of roasted malt and pine/citrus hops just isn't going to work for me. Not gettin' this one again.","garuda","Jun 11, 2013"

Makes me wonder if the brewers are just saying Eff You to the stereotypical Utahian. Yeah, I pretty sure that's what you call someone from Utah. This beer was so tempting sitting on the shelf, I had to give it try. Very cool labeling, ""imperial black", hemp seed, 9.2% alcohol, its motto ""earth, wind, and beer", who wouldn't want to give it a go? The beer pours a very dark golden brown, but if you can get light through it, its golden orange color is very appealing. Very very light aroma to the point I had to almost dip the tip of my nose in the beer to smell it. Not that I really care about the smell though so I in fact liked that fact. I also worked to pour the beer with a head but this beer does not foam. Virtually no head although again, I don't really care much for head (well, on my beer I don't)! One sip of this beer and it seems to figure out how to coat your mouth in a nice thin layer of yum! While I am not the world's biggest IPA fan, I really like this beer for its drinkability. Not an overwhelming bitterness, despite its 109 EBU rating. Has a hint of licorice and chocolate but with a strong grapefruity profile. Definitely worth another go, but next time with a steak and not chips and salsa!","faulkster4","Apr 27, 2013"

4.25,2.9,,,,,,"My pour was a little heavy-handed at first and I got some overflow as a result. Once things settled, I had two rocky fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention. It looked like meringue sitting there, defying me to mess with it. Color was actually garnet-red, believe it or don't. Nice clarity, allowing for light penetration when held up to strong light. Nose was when thinngs began to head south for me. It was minty, but with an odd smokiness overpowering the mintiness. Mouthfeel was medium and while I have had some instances where this style put me in mind of Girl Scout Thin Mints, this was not one of them. Instead, the malt lent it a burnt bitterness rather than a chocolatiness. The hops were definitely minty, but they were losing the battle. Finish was smoky, burnt and simply not to my liking.","Giantspace","Apr 27, 2013"

It pours a luscious dark-chocolate brown that lets light in only at the edges and has a thick, fluffy, light tan head that likes to hang around. Flavor has a roast malt overtone with nutty, molasses, earthy and caramel notes plus hints of hops and licorice. Absolutely lip-smacking! Smooth, firm texture has plenty of fizz and life.

I get the feeling this is going to be brutally bitter in taste. Some sweet chocolate notes and slight caramel from the hops. Baker's chocolate and caramel malt start the flavor, yielding to bitter root, almost licorice. The hop bitterness is barkish, earthy, and is accompanied by strong alcohol presence. Beneath everything is some nectar or sweet honey from one of the hop varieties. Finish is balanced, leaving you with dark chocolate and licorice. Definitely a fan of this, but it is very strong, both in flavor and ABV. ","Philousa","Dec 05, 2012"

4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this beer was excellent. It's great to see Utah brewers trying new things. The hemp seeds provided a nice touch. It is nice to see the crazy Utah theocratic lawmakers allow brewers to make proper ABV beer that can only be sold in state run stores (pain in the booty when visiting). Unfortunately, any beer above 4 % ABV is only available in a state run liquor store. You can buy beer in supermarkets at 4% and below only. If you ever go to Utah (I seldomly do), find out where the liquor stores are and buy a pack of Dubhe! It goes well with beef and nacho chips,w/salsa, and spicy guacamole. I recommend this ale.

The aroma is quite evident and brings deep earthy malt with tropical fruit and citrus hop highlights. Woodsy and herbal and a bit of licorice. This gets the digestive juices going, very edible. The taste buds pick up on near peaty earthiness with more of a hint of chocolate-licorice and the hops take on more of the herbal/seaweed side for a pungent, somewhat swamp-funk. It mostly comes down to a herbal-grassy sort of hop bite that is somewhat mellowed by the root beer malt. It takes a little getting used to the flavors but they settle down and it’s definitely a goody. It’s a medium-plus bodied brew with modest carbonation for a satiny smooth feel.

Smell is primarily of herbal and citrus zest hops with some roasted malt and cocoa powder aromas as the beer warms. Taste is of citrus zest and spicy herbal hops up front with dark roasted malt and cocoa flavors coming in with the aftertaste. A mild hop bitterness lingers on the tongue after each sip.

3.73,-9.7,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Uinta Dubhe pours a nearly solid black. When properly backlit, the very edge of the beer lightens to mahogany. There's a full three fingers of caramel head that just sits there for a minute before beginning it's slow decline, and it leaves more than enough lacing against the inside of the glass. The nose quickly indicates that this is a black IPA that takes some flavor from dark malts, as opposed to just color, as there are definitely notes of coffee and chocolate present in the aroma. The hops show themselves as well, citrus and earthy. A mild coffee and chocolate maltiness leads of each sip. The mid palate bitterness is way too mild. It doesn't effectively knock back the malty opening, and the sweetness dampens the opening of the hoppy back end (citrus and earth in a fairly even blend). The body has a littel bit of heft to it, which in and of itself is just fine, but that ends up overwhelming a carbonation level that's just totally inadequate. Dubhe isn't a bad beer, but the lck of bitterness and dull carbonation make it not nearly as crisp as most IPAs, black or otherwise.","axeman9182","Oct 19, 2011"

Smells grainy roasty with some small storm king like hop scents with a touch of the 9.2% coming out. This comes off like a hoppy porter with some tropics of a IPA without exibiting the bitterness of one. Feel is a nice healthy medium with a nice carb but goes down smooth and not bitter.

Bitter pine resin and heavy roasted grains mix and mingle to create a smooth and balanced flavor profile. Notes of citrus, cocoa, coffee and earth present in some form, light fruityness on back end.

Thick resin of citric hop and hemp in the nose, a bit piney with mild chicory and cocoa powder from the malt, and ripe fruit from the alcohol. Pungent hop smack tackles the palate hard, sticky resin with evergreen and mixed citric flavors. Malt sweetness and the blackness behind it break through just enough to keep the beer in balance. Alcohol is a bit amped up, but not hot. Hop and hemp flavors stay for a while during a semi-roasted bittersweet finish. Wow, a lot to take in. But in the end, this ale works, as all flavors meld well together.","BeerAdvocate","Jun 28, 2011"
4.03,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A good beer which brings an interesting flavor to the table. Maybe a bit less roast and the hops would shine through a bit nicer.","cbutova","Jun 27, 2011"
4.03,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Smooth, soft, subtle and tasty, with the 9.2% way in the back ground, creamy chocolate all through this one, drying herbal and again earthy hops in the rear to add the balance, bite and intrigue. Quality dark/black DIPA...well worth giving this one a try....","Billolick","Jun 23, 2011"

4.32,4.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Until now, I was not really sold on the ""black IPA"" trend we seem to be seeing in many American craft brewers. I am very happy with this beer. Overall definitely worth the try, especially if you like the style.","Schreibeers","Jun 21, 2011"
3.61,-12.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - Overall, this isnt a bad black IPA. The appearance is great, but thats pretty much it. Everything else is fairly standard. This needs more of that chocolate roasty malt quality that one expected with a black IPA.","rudzud","Jun 21, 2011"
3.98,-3.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a stemmed glass a near jet black except for some ruby tinge when held in some light,a blooming light mocha colored head atop.Big roast in the nose along with some raw earthiness,the piney hops are there but a little subdued.The hops are much bigger on the palate,resiny and citrusy along with dark bread and coffee roast.A real good black ale but the alcohol sweetness does creep a little so its not something I could drink alot of.","oberon","Jun 21, 2011"
3.48,-15.7,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"overall, its not bad, but not great. I'm not sure what the hemp seed did for this beer, but it didn't make this beer become overly unique. I'd drink it again, but there are many others I'd choose before this one.","silentjay","Jun 18, 2011"
4.23,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I've been waiting for a beer like this. Good interpretation of style. Made me want a Zoe....","Sensaray","Jun 16, 2011"
3.31,-19.9,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a dark orangey-brown but sits nearly black in the glass. Tan head takes a while to develop through the thick liquid but it puffs up to a solid three fingers before melting away to leave thick fine-bubbled lacing. First impression is that this smells like a hoppy barleywine. Lots of grapefruity hops and a toasty caramel maltiness. As it warms, more chocolate comes through, but this is a hoppy beast, even at three months old. Flavor has some smooth dark-but-not-super-dark chocolate and pineapple hops to go with a very bitter finish. Ashy tobacco notes recall cheap cigars and there's a big fusel presence. The label says the malts ""align"" with the hops but I find the flavor profile to be discordant. Palate is nice and silky while the beer is cool, but some warmth thins it out and shows more alcohol. Couldn't finish the 12 oz bottle.","illidurit","Jun 10, 2011"
4.88,18.2,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall fantastic showing!! I will definitely Pick up more of this. I hope this becomes a regular offering at my local packy. I could definitely put this in the regular rotation","mikekeastie","Jun 07, 2011"
4.62,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Overall: This is a really complex beer, and a nice interpretation of the CDA style. The flavor goes on and on. I can only recommend this for the adventurous sort as the flavors are really intense. Those that can handle it will be rewarded. I also suggest trying it fresh.","kagent777","Jun 06, 2011"
4.08,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O/D - A good imperial black IPA that seems to be able to strongly deliver both the interesting malts of a black IPA as well as the potent hopping.","katan","Jun 04, 2011"

4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Finally rating this! A new Black IIPA from Uinta brewed with Hemp seeds, named after the Utah State Star- no association with doobies I’m sure. Pours a pure black color with a medium beige head. The aroma is massive floral and pine hops, really dank. The flavor is a very hoppy brew; high bitterness, a massive peppery spiciness- could this be in part the hemp seed?- a rich roast and chocolate. Very damn good. Aggressive, certainly a huge beer. Lots to like here.","Douglas88","Jun 02, 2011"
2.32,-43.8,4,2,2,4,2,"Overall, it's just not pleasant.It's almost all charred bitterness that just sits in your mouth.","Beaver13","Jun 01, 2011"
3.16,-23.5,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Overall, I'm complacent with the four pack that I picked up. I can't say that I'm going to get many more bottles of this. The price is pretty damned great though, $1.80something per bottle. I like Black IPAs plenty, I'm just not fully into this one.","rickyhansing","Jun 01, 2011"
4.29,3.9,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Perhaps the best BDIPA/BIPA I have ever enjoyed. I bought a single bottle of it for like $2.19 making a 6er probably about 12. A good deal!","flannelman808","May 27, 2011"
4.88,18.2,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Hell with all of you over analyzing beer yuppies, this actions is the goods!!! It's like an imperial stout got together with a double ipa, did meth and went on a 10 hr. love making marathon. Balanced yet aggressive with equally distinct flavors. Amazing as it warms, sweet yet hoppy. Not overly muted taste. THE GOODS! ORALE!","QueSonHops","May 26, 2011"
3.91,-5.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O: I seem to like the Double Black IPA style than the regular Black IPAs. At this alcohol level the flavours get much more integrated; there's better structure and balance. Really it's comparable to very hoppy stouts. Uinta's done a good job here, check it out.","Halcyondays","May 24, 2011"

3.49,-15.5,4,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours jet black with a almost no head retention. Light cream color on the little lacing that is there. Aroma is mild, but does have some hint of roasty malts and some hops. the flavor blends the roasty malts well with the dry hoppy bitterness. decent finish to the beer, some what residual bitterness. Not a bad beer, but not something i would seek out.","Kshock","May 21, 2011"
3.98,-3.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Picked up a four pack of this one this afternoon (kind of on a black ale kick for some reason). Poured a nice, rich dark brown color, with some reddish highlights and a big light brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, earthy hops and light coffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of milk and dark chocolate, vanilla and earthy hops, with a lingering bitter finish.","emmasdad","May 15, 2011"
2.79,-32.4,4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"ETA: Tried it again. Less goldfish-tank-y but a really one-dimensional grain bill and, well, I don't know, at least when it tasted like a fish tank it had some personality...","lisomiso","May 14, 2011"

3.68,-10.9,4,3.5,4,4,3,"D/O: Note to self: You still need to review Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous. Every black IPA seems to tie back into that seminal anniversary beer from Stone in some way, and such is doubly true for those that stray over the 7% mark. This beer from Uinta, newly arrived in the Southern California market, is no exception, falling very close to the stylistic origin. Dubh does not attempt to pull any punches; it is in the face of the drinker from start to finish, taunting the palate with dark grain, American hops, and astringency, served in aggressive and palate-choking abundance. It is beautiful in its intensity, but hard to finish--wearing out the palate about half-way through the serving. The brewer is kind not to package this in a larger-format bottle. Twelve ounces is plenty of food for thought.","beagle75","Apr 28, 2011"
4.2,1.7,4,4,4,5,4.5,"the best part of this beer is the aftertaste. perhaps it's the marketing (brewed with hemp seed, and a name pronounced ""doobie""), but the aftertaste is distinctly similar to... well.... you get the idea.","russj117","Mar 26, 2011"
