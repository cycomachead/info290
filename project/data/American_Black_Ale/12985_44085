3.91,16.4,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"I think everyone is rating this as an IPA. It definitely isn't that. It tastes more like a light stout. Pours dark. Not quit pitch black, but very dark brown. No clarity at all. Small head that doesn't really last. Virtually no lacing. Has a roasted almost sweet smell. Maybe chocolate? Maybe caramel? The smell is the best quality. Dark, malty up front taste with a moderately bitter roasted aftertaste. Again, maybe chocolate? Sweet. Could be raisins? There a dark fruity taste. Virtually no bitterness from hops. It is lacking balance. Not bad but would buy many other beers before this one. Wouldn't ever turn it down, though.","jngrizzaffi","May 04, 2014"

3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"I was really looking forward to opening this, got to say I'm a little let down by it on a few levels. Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a stemmed glass, wonderful dark brown but with no head...only clear bubbles around the glass. Smell of rum soaked raisins and a faint chemical hint...possibly the sweet smell of anti-freeze (smell NOT taste!) was present. The taste started out bitter and flat...bitter is fine but the flat was like a true old style Porter...this is not a Porter so it didn't settle well, alcohol and some hops bitterness are about the only flavors..mouthfeel is medium but seems to start out thin and then settles medium on the tongue. As a side note as you drink this the hops come out in the aftertaste...I've had a few Black IPA's and this is not among the good ones. Overall I think maybe this might be infected because I've read reviews about massive foam...and some with the clear bubbles that I had...either way it's not what I want in a Black IPA...or any beer for that matter...might try it again if the price is right.","Bear1964","Feb 25, 2014"

3.77,12.2,4.25,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"22 ounce bottle killer label of the Dogzilla attacking the town, simcoe and cascade in a black IPA from Idaho man are we getting progressive, did I mention I purchased this in West Virginia, holy shit what's going on? The body is pitch Black with a light beige head almost white, I've never seen a head this light in a beer this dark. Aromatics are giving off citrus and spicy notes almost a cinnamon like character if I had to describe it any further. The first sips carries that black roast blended with high alpha acid hops rather nicely, drinks like a highly carbonated schwarzbier with more hop pellet kick than most of them out there, the spicy characteristic is nice and would blend great with the Kristoff Sumatran wrapped cigar I'm about to light up. Light dark chocolate herbal mint, spicy hops, mild citrus twang but really ends up as a nice spicy schwarzbier more than a black IPA. Mouthfeel is medium at best with ample flowing carbonation a layer of spice and hop bitterness is left on the palate between sips. Overall a beer that I will drink sparingly not the one I wanted compared to other big dark beers out there, I'm glad the alcohol is not over the top it's well hidden and barely a factor in this big beast of a 22 ounce beer.","WVbeergeek","May 07, 2013"
2.83,-15.8,3.5,3,2.5,4,2.5,"Oh, no, they say he's got to go... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear midnight garnet topped by over a finger of wan off-cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, anise, pine needles, spearmint, and cinnamon. Odd as it may sound, this thing smells like certain Christmas cookies I've had in my day, almost like a gingerbread man with peppermint buttons who happened to have been left on the baking pan a bit too long, blackening the backside a bit. Here, it's not quite what I'm looking for, and luckily not entirely offensive, especially considering that the mint gets stronger as time progresses. The taste brings in more of the same, though that minty character is now nearly absent until the finish, the roast is darker and more bitter, and the pine asserts itself a great deal more. Unfortunately, everything is in competition with everything else, precluding any chance of flavor harmony. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a fairly smooth feel, and a drying finish. Overall, this black IPA just didn't sit right with me, what with the chaotic nature of the flavors.","TMoney2591","May 06, 2013"

Honestly, I should've just taken a picture of the bottle, because it was all downhill once I opened it. First of all, the head was HUGE! It would almost be more appropriate to measure it in hands instead of fingers. The color was almost jet black and the smell was floral and hoppy, but smelled oddly dank (for lack of a better term). The taste was NOT GOOD. Burnt, but not roasty like you expect from dark malts, and although it smelled floral, it tasted really bitter (not floral) and finished even worse. Also, it was too dry and reminded me of a really cheap cabernet. Stay away, there are better BIPAs out there.","babbules","Aug 18, 2012"

Color is a lovely, clear shad of red brown with some nicely flowing bubble trails. Aroma is an interesting blend of roast, malt, dark ripe fruit, licorice, toffee, citrus, lumber. Flavor is very similar to nose, almost brut dry, with hops against the dark malts and a little carbonic tang. Body is odd as there is plenty of carbonation, it still feels soft in the mouth and has lots of hop high points that don't work so well for me. Almost chewy but not quite.

Rich caramel and earthy grains lie underneath a bouquet of pine like hops. Quite light and very complex. I was extremely open to this one. First sip is smooth, creamy malts that wash across the tongue. Great complexity here now as well.

The beginning has a sharp hop bite, followed by a bit of soft caramel sweetness (though not much), and the finish is a long, strong bitterness that borders on astringent. There are a lot of IBUs grinding away at my tongue. There is just a slight roast quality to it, but not a lot. I need to try more black IPAs to try and understand their purpose (if there is one). The body is about right and thankfully not too heavy. My biggest complaint is that the bittering hops are too heavy-handed for my liking. Otherwise, it's a tasty beer and a pretty good deal at $4/22 oz. bottle.","JEdmund","Jan 02, 2011"

The flavor is similar with big citrusy and piney hop notes upfront, along with some cocoa and orange zest, burnt bread and espresso, dark fruits, a slight chalkiness and some alcohol.

Pours a deep dark reddish brown, not truly a ""black"" IPA - to me this would be what I would call a ""Cascadian Dark Ale"" - though that style name is somewhat pretentious. This beer is pretty to look at, with a billowing and sticky two finger light tan head, with lacing clinging to the glass. Massive hop aroma hits the nose first, with loads of pine and grass up front. Malt aroma there as well, somewhat crackery, though faint. Mouthfeel is mildly carbonated, and a little bit thin. You don't have time to really notice this though, as tons and tons of fresh hop flavor hijack the taste. This is clearly a West Coast style brew, right up there with the big boys in terms of hop presence. Atypical to style, the taste is fleeting - rather than slamming the tongue with waves of lingering bitterness the brew instead finishes very dry, with crackery malt hitting all the right notes. Overall this is a very nice take on the CDA / Black IPA / IBA style, as the mild bitterness and great hop character makes for an easy drinking beer.","eclaycamp","Dec 05, 2010"

4.19,24.7,4,5,4,3.5,4,"D - This is a unique and delicious IPA. It almost tastes like a strong Baltic Porter mixed with a West Coast IPA. Very cool and different.","zeff80","Nov 03, 2008"
3.45,2.7,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinks okay. Not sessionable for me. Would have this again. Interesting.","bbothen","Nov 02, 2008"
4.27,27.1,4.5,5,4,4,4,"pours a thin redish black color with a small white head that disapers to a light lacing around the entire rim. the sent of hops rushes out at you at the crack of the cap. this is one of the best smelling ipa's ever. the taste is bitter all the way through, hints of coffiee and biscuts, caremel, yard trimings, sweet tobaco and strong alchoal. this is a beer i will seek out agan for sure","orcasteve","Oct 20, 2008"
3.05,-9.2,4,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,"D - Not a terrible beer but not a good one either. I'll bet they're good on tap but based on my experiences, the bottles seem to be off.","GJ40","Oct 19, 2008"
2.61,-22.3,4,3,2,3.5,2.5,"it is really smooth, and has a nice darker aftertaste. the aftertaste exceeds the taste, but the drinkability is low. (I can only hope this is a bad keg or a dirty line.)","henrysunset","Oct 15, 2008"
3.11,-7.4,4.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"A cutting pine needle and citrus in the aroma. But the quaff puts me off a bit, too much woody resin in the finish and aftertaste. I luv a good IPA, but the harshness of this one doesn't set well. I didn't taste any smoke as previous reviewers, and certainly don't think this is an ""A" beer.","Vancer","Oct 01, 2008"
3.75,11.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A curious IPA and a nice twist with the dark malts, it's like smoked porter versus India Pale Ale on this one, some sort of hybrid like the name Dogzilla tends to imply, and it works.","IronDjinn","Sep 30, 2008"
3.26,-3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"overall pretty good, not a session beer, this one went down slow.","Hollenbeck2","Sep 28, 2008"
4.32,28.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinks well, a little filling mainly due to the dark colour and caramel ending making it feel more like a porter","Chelsea1905","Sep 28, 2008"
4.2,25,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Good interesting beer. Acidity from the dark malts works well with the hops.","Beerzebub","Sep 28, 2008"
4.03,19.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"An unusual tasting beer, but I enjoyed it. I'm not sure I'd want to session it, but one bomber hit the spot after getting off work today, and I'll definitely have it again. If my friends tried this version of this beer and didn't like it, I have to respectfully disagree with them. If this is a re-worked version of what they drank, then I'd say the fine tuning was worth it.","woemad","Sep 28, 2008"
4.35,29.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Well the very fact that they pay homage to the Blue Öyster Cult tune Godzilla (from their '77 album Spectres) on the bottle is a good sign. Plus, this does go well while jamming BOC and probably while watching the cinematic masterpiece The Stöned Age. I thought this beer was unique, innovative, and delicious. Highly recommended to everyone.","erikm25","Sep 03, 2008"
4,19,4,4,4,4,4,"The black IPA is a sub-style that I would like to see being made more often. They're interesting to a hop head, like me, with the new malt additions. Dogzilla brings to mind the freshest of Founder's Black Rye unfortunately I can't drink them side by side. Thanks for the bottles Toby, I thoroughly enjoyed them both.","joe1510","Aug 24, 2008"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice dark brown color, not much carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, sour/tangy, metalic, very slight roastyness, with some citrus/grapefruit. The taste is hoppy, with some malts, sour/tangy, metalic, some roastyness, and some citrus/grapefruit. Medium body. Drinkable, but there is a strange sourness/metalic taste to this brew.","Wasatch","Aug 11, 2008"
4.03,19.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The aroma is cascade like with a spicy citrus and pine smell. The taste is initially hoppy then fades into a roasted malt backbone. It leaves a little bit of an abrasive hop bitterness on the finish and stay with you in the mouth for quite awhile. You really need to be a hop head to enjoy this beer fully. Overall it is a interesting American IPA and definitely worth a shot. It was priced right as well.","cswhitehorse","Aug 10, 2008"
4.42,31.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - I enjoyed this one quite a bit. The dark malts balanced well with the hoppiness, and I could certainly drink this one again and again.","thethrone","Aug 08, 2008"
4.3,28,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Very drinkable. I hope this one sticks around for a little bit. This is an IPA for any season!","travisd13","Aug 04, 2008"

4.42,31.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really hope Laughing Dog makes this part of the litter. No doubt I will be buying this again... I know it is drinking very fresh right now... but it is such a good value, I can see picking up a bunch and throwing them in the fridge so anytime I want something a little different I have a good goto brew. Fantastic.","JohnGalt1","0"
4.47,33,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Coffee and roasty malt is subtle, but there tucked behind the big american hop profile. Ever so drinkable and a really really nice IPA. This deserves to be a fulltime brew if it isnt. Smooth and with a nice dry aftertaste that makes me want to keep drinking.","SurlyDuff","0"
