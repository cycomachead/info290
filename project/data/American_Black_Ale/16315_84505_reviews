"I really tried to like this, but it just wouldn't happen. Too bad too, as I have liked many brews from BrewDog. Just had some off-putting flavor to me. Maybe an old bottle? Oh well, going to try their Cocoa Psycho next."

"Draft. Dark nearly black with thin brown head. Piney roast malt aroma. Slightly chocolaty and sweet up front. Finish is piney hop."

"Purchased in Mullingar Ireland. A black Brew Dog ale. Highly hopped.  Great beer."

"awsome, tnx MAS PLENUM, NICE"

"Quite good, lot of beer here, great taste, lots of hops, but rich and smooth"
"Ordered a Hardcore IPA. Tap changed. This came. Thought it was the wife's stout. They said it was Libertine. Absolutely pitch black with a chocolate milk head... stout. Aromas were big, citrus and tropical notes. Balanced tastes. Period. Great match of malt, hop flavor, bitterness, and smooth mouthfeel. This was sent home run. I don't normally try Brew Dog too often as it is really pricey here, but this was excellent."

"O: Great brew.  I expect this one came a long way to Thailand, so likely the hops have fallen off some.  Still a treat, having it with Aussie steak in Kunming, China, Jan 11, 2015."

"•	Almost got some fruity and sweet Belgiany taste toward the end – really nice ending to a great beer!"
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly good considering it's a month and a half past due. Libertine beautifully integrates a massive PacNW hop character with classic porter/stout flavours. Worth buying."

"O - very good mix of an IPA and stout.  It brings out the best of both - the brillant floral bitterness with the roasted malts and choc.  Yet neither is too strong.  Give it a crack!"
"Single hopped simcoe black ale, rich and full of flavour. I had this in Brewdog Camden several times, one beer i would travel out of my way to find."

"Nice and piney/resinous ale with a touch of citrus.  Very smooth and tasty.  Really great example of the style."

"Taste-Dark roasted malt, oily resinous hops, caramel, faint smoke, tobacco leaf. Well-balanced and complex in flavor and character. A bit pricey but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is good. it has an even balance of sweet and dry and is very bright, lots of crispness without taking from the smoothness and flowing nicely on the tongue while remaining at a solid medium body, maybe a hair on the lighter side of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The mouthfeel and texture really help to bring this one together. This black ale manages to stay very balanced and drinkable, which is a challenge within the style as the double dose of bitterness and astringency from both hops and roasted malts often makes for a rougher experience. One of the more cohesive Brew Dog beers I've had to date."
""
""
"O: I'm really starting to enjoy black IPA's. And this odd hybrid goes down easy. Cheers to the boys from Scotland."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - pleasant surpise and return of fresh Brewdog shows they can still make some Good Beer. Surprised I had not reviewed before."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this style, and Brewdog has put their salty, peaty, roasty, charry stamp on it. This is a favorite of the style and a favorite beer."
""
""
""
"I get what this is supposed to be, but the hops have faded (assuming they were ever there/being fair to the brewery), some of the extreme bitterness remains but the nose and taste are quite medicinal, old licorice comes to mind - though I doubt I've ever had any. I'll give it another shot - and as low as this review is, realize I could go much lower. I lean towards the overall good reviews and assume something is wrong here."

"330ml bottle. Goblet glass @Tot Begut (Sant Boí –Barcelona). Very dark brown color. Beige foam shows fairly good retention. Intense aromas of caramel malts, resins & pine. Creamy upfront & roasted malt flavor. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Viscous texture & malty dried sensation. Sharp bitterness but solid caramelized malty backbone are touched by subtle spicy & dark cocoa hues. Long bitter finish. Slight wood on the aftertaste. Refreshing & nice spot of the Style."

"Could happily drink this all night, but then I'd be a mess."

"Overall: I oscillated between rating this a 3.75 or 4.00. Think the appearance was okay but the taste pushed me to a 4. Took me awhile to figure out what the flavors were and it was pretty unique although I haven't had a ton of black ales."
""
"O - very easy drinking, not at all hot like many Brewdog beers can be, very sessionable, very good tasting"
""
""
"Let me preface this review by saying this is one of those beers not for everyone. If you don't like hops, or at least these ""Black IPAs"" real hoppy and prefer a more balanced, malty beer, then skip this. Pour a black body with one finger almost tan head that died down leaving some lace. The hops are the star in the aroma as I get earthy, piney hops and just touches of any type of malt (mostly sweet). The beer is smooth, light to medium bodied, taste is mostly fresh, earthy hops but the beer is a little bigger/thicker than average IPA and the malts do come out as there is a residual sweetness that hits me on the backend. To poorly summarize this beer, it's an IPA with a larger chunk of bready and sweet caramel and chocolate malts. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would welcome more sweet Black IPAs like it."
""
""
""
"O- One of the better ""Black IPAs"" I've had. Definitely done in an American style and isn't incredibly complex but I could definitely knock back a few of these happily. Now if only the price could be lower..."

"O - A really nice black IPA, with a strong hops presence, both in smell and taste, but not overwhelmingly bitter. Definitely recommendable and worth repeating"

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass with a fine two finger light brown head with great retention and lots of thick lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops, orange and grapefruit citrus, and hint of tropical fruit. Flavor is mixed citrus with citrus and grassy hops, mild fruit esters and light toasted malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess; despite the beautiful head, a surprising lack of carbonation in the mouth feel. An interesting take on the black ale style, well hopped, but with a European flavor profile. More dominated by citrus hops and flavor than toasted malt, which takes a third row back seat. I'm baffled by the weak showing of the carbonation in the feel, but it was a distraction. Perhaps the carbonation was all used up in the nice foam? Interesting but not going to be my go-to black ale."

"Overall- Between a good beer and a pretty good beer. Nothing amazing but different enough to warrant attention. I would definitely give this a try and I will be on the lookout for more BrewDog beers."

"Overall: Libertine is a decent beer, but it certainly needs a lot more oomph (either that or it needs to be a lot fresher)."
""
""
"There is nothing wrong with this beer, I just don’t get it."
"Pours into a standard pint nearly pitch black except for some redish brown highlights when held to the light,a thinner quick to fade beige head atop.A good burst of resinous hops in the nose along with a little grassiness to go along with deep chocolate notes.Piney hops stand out at first sip along with nutty malts,more ""greeness""comes into play from the hops providing grassy tones,malt driven sweetness becomes bigger as I drink more providing some molasses and caramel flavors to go along with bitter choccolate.This is how a ABA should taste in my mind,big hops but good dark malty sweetness,good job here from the Scottish guys."

"The main reason for the high scores is the fact it makes me want to take another sip. It has a good hop taste, which I am looking for, and the dark malty flavors are great for the cold weather. There is a lot of good happening in this beer and I keep going back for more. It is a very smooth beer which makes this, in my opinion, to be a great beer for someone just venturing into the darker beer universe."
"Light body, quite drinkable, long and bitter aftertaste, even bitter root."

"A very strong beer, with a bit too much bitterness in the taste for me."
"On the fuller end of medium body with subtle earthy hop bitterness countered by very strong malt flavors. There's a bit of earthy pine and resinous oils but like the aroma, the hop character is overpowered by the prominent malt bill. Slightly smokey with robust, roasted coffee bean flavor along with hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, charcoal and bittersweet dark chocolate. Dry and bitter but not harsh, acrid or overwhelming. The bitter roast is cut mid-palate by lighter malt sweetness with hints of silky chocolate, caramel and toffee. The ABV is well masked and it's light enough to drink easily, I just wish that it had more of a hop presence to balance out the malt flavors. It drinks more like a slightly bitter porter than an American Black Ale. Not bad, but not what I'm looking for in this style."

"O - One more good ale from Brewdog."
""
""

"Overall: the confusing flavors detract me from enjoying it fully. I like the complexity and feel as if I had a gastronomic, ""foam of carrot"" experience; however I could get this easily from a solid Belgian beer and would prefer to do so. I'm glad I tried it, I would recommend it, but I doubt I would immediately jump to drink it again."

"O: It's a really nice black ale, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again given its inflated price. Actually, it isn't that hideously expensive by import/BrewDog standards, so actually, it's more a freshness thing that makes me hesitate a future purchase. I'd definitely give it a second chance on tap, though."
"Nice black colour, with a touch of red. Smell of citrusy hops, dark chocolate, coffee and some sour dark fruits. Taste: same as smell, bit of grapefruit. Medium body, medium bitterness, touch of sourness. I'd give this beer 5.0, but I'm saving it for perfect black IPA, although it's hard to imagine better than this one."

"Overall - Another winner from this brewer. This would be one of my go to beers if it was available locally. Worth buying for sure."

"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney notes with light fruity touch is great with some dry roasted malt notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by medium dry roasted malt notes with a decent dose of Simcoe citrus and piney hops. Body is about average with good carbonation. Solid rendition of the style thought a fuller body would have been even better."
"Overall: The first Black Ale I can really get behind of. It has great complexity and drinkibility value - it drinks like a session ale. One of my instant favourites from Brewdog."

"M&O: softly refreshing on the palate, medium-bodied, at the same time very smooth, this Black IPA or “Twenty First Century Black Ale” has delivered a fairly satisfying result overall. The alc. content is also well hidden, increasing the drinkability by a very good margin. Highly recommended."

""

"Really lovely IBA. Superb example of the style, just artistically put together. You've surprised me with this one, BrewDog. There's almost a subtlety here with the amount of finesse used. Love it."
"The rare Black IPA that's black more than IPA without being a porter. And probably the best of those."
""
"A solid black IPA with great aroma and flavour. Plenty of pine and hints of citrus, along with a large dose of dark malt. I've had this for a while so the hops may have faded a little - I suspect the fresh aroma was even more intense. My only minor complaint is that the body could be slightly thicker, but this is trivial. A tasty brew; if you like dark, hoppy beers then seek this one out. Worth sampling."
""
""
"A really intense, quite bitter black ipa. If thats your thing you'll probably love this beer. Quite herbal and slick, malt roastiness is slight, a lot of intensity here. I quite like it here, strong, rich and dark, but the intricacies and subtle balance really make it work."
""

"Decent if not mind-blowing."
"Could use a bit more carbonation."

"Extreme beer, lots of flavors and lots of hops, making ends meet."

"This poured out as a nice deep brown colored beer with a dejection light brown colored head. The lacing and retention are both pretty good here. The smell is really nice, it's hoppy and sweet smelling. Very impressive nose. The taste is also really nice, hoppy but it's also rich and sweet... It's great in my opinion. The mouthfeel is smooth it's almost creamy. Lightly carbonated and very drinkable. Overall this is one of the best Black IPA's I've had. Very good brew all around. I would love having this again."
"O: A nice black IPA, balanced, refreshing."
"A decent Black Ale. Nice balance of hop and roasted malts."
"Overall - An excellent example of a black IPA... recommended"
"This one was a beer that I really enjoyed, very much like an IPA but not quite as bitter and with a good alcohol content that was well hidden but the excellent blend of fruits in both the smell and the taste."
