3.79,2.7,5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Pretty good. Aroma's mainly hop with a hint of malt. Appearance is excellent with a huge, long lasting, tan head, lots of lace, and a clear dark garnet color. Taste is similar to nose, good balance between malt sweet, hop bitter, & carbonic tang. Good body. Finish falls fast at first and then tapers very slow at the last. Fairly drinkable beer; wouldn't mind another.","drpimento","Mar 28, 2015"

The malt is as light as it could possibly be and still be roasted almost black. Light and drinks lightly I love it!","utopiajane","Jul 10, 2014"

The aroma is very roasted, much more reminiscent of a schwarzbier, with only a hint of hops. Its a nice aroma, but not very IPA-ish. The taste is equally close to a schwarzbier. Delicious, but not really an IPA. There's a nice feel to the body and it's nice a smooth. If this weren't billed as an IPA, I think it would get a much higher rating. It has a great flavor but it doesn't even closely resemble one.","delta490","Jun 09, 2014"

Nice restaurants really need to start figuring this beer things out, not really acceptable for an IPA, black or not. Anyway, pours dark brown to black with a little purple hue, small off white head. Smells like lemon pinesol and some sweet chocolate in the background. The flavor follows the aroma rather closely, with much more malt sweetness. Chocolate, lemon, pine, old hops I guess. Medium mouthfeel, a bit creamy, with medium level carbonation. Would like to try fresh but as is it wasn't bad. With that said, plenty of better things to reach for.","BMMillsy","Mar 05, 2014"

I think it is a good alternative for a hop head that likes a little more toasted flavor of a dark malty beer for a change. This offers a good in between balance. I would buy it again.","cottonkoozie","Oct 03, 2013"

Roasty up front with hints of black licorice, mocha, and soy sauce with a touch of citrus and pine emerging as well as a touch of smoke. The taste is a bit more bold with roasty coffee and chocolate complemented nicely with citrusy, piney hop notes with some cola on the finish. The mouthfeel is a tad bit fizzy and a little thin, but has a nice finish. Overall a solid Black IPA, but not quite up there with Sublimely. Very sessionable though...","beerdrifter","Nov 19, 2012"

4.13,11.9,3.5,3,5,4,4,"Had on tap at Golden West in Baltimore. Appearance was nothing special. Must not have gotten a good pour out of the tap because I had no head at all. Color was a dark dark brown with hints of red around the edges. Slightest touch of caramel colored suds on the top. Looks like a stout but definitely drinks like an IPA. Lots of rich scents on the nose - coffee, buttercream, chocolate, and a touch of smoke. The taste closely mimics the nose - definitely can taste the hops. Not citrusy but robust which gives me the impression that they are extremely well-balanced with the grains. Malty character but not too sweet - toasty and roasty. Dark flavors - bittersweet chocolate and toast with a hint of strong coffee at the finish. Mouthfeel was extremely pleasant. Not too crisp but not as flat as other dark beers can be. Overall an extemely tasty beer. Great take on the black IPA , but this is certainly open to interpretation - some my call it a stout m, some a brown ale. A great beer to kick off a session and enjoy when the weather is turning from cold to colder. Cheers!","bensbeers","Nov 16, 2012"

3.98,7.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours an opaque, very dark brown with a huge, fluffy dark taupe head. Average head retention. Cola-ruby glints are noted around the bottom edges. Aroma is characterized by chocolate, roasted malt, and cherry. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout style, but they call this a black IPA, in which case it is more true to style. Carbonation is a bit on the low average side. Very mild flavors, given the appearance, of chocolate covered cherries and some coffee acidity late. There's a mild sweetness throughout. Some of its hop character expresses itself about midway. It still drinks a bit more like an English stout. The 65 IBUs likely put it in an IPA category. Otherwise, it should be in an English stout category.","DocJitsu","Oct 26, 2012"

3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew poured with a two finger fluffy tan head. It looks almost exactly like a stout. The body was a dark brown, almost black. As a result, there is no visible carbonation. The head takes awhile to dissipate and leaves significant lacing on the glass. The nose has a hint of smoke or toastiness (maybe a little nuttiness?) and some hops. This is different from a normal IPA. There is definite hoppy bitterness on the taste, but there is almost a roasted nutty taste to it. This isn’t what I expected at all, but then again, I never had a black IPA. The finish lingers with a lot of nuttiness, moreso than the hops. I would have this again, probably after I had another black IPA to compare it to.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

Taste of grapefruit, pine, roasted malt, caramel, toast, chocolate, floral, and herbal spiciness.

Aroma is lightly roasty but led by grapefruit hop notes. The flavor is a bit more balanced and less aggressively citrusy than I remember the can being. Definite grapefruit hoppiness with some piney notes but there is a higher degree of roastiness here than in many other black IPAs or “Cascadian Ales” or what-have-you.

Severely lacks in any kind of 'roasted' malt character. Very, very middle of the road with both the hops and malt flavors. It's at least drinkable.

Taste matches rather well, and there's nice play between sweet and bitter. The texture reminds me of melted chocolate. I like the residual bitter hop dryness that lingers after the finish.

I had no problem drinking it all but when it was over I didn’t have much in the way of strong impressions. What I have to balance that against is the fact that the last black IPA I had was Stone’s 2011 SSR a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed it. I think the fact that SSR really sang made Back in Black’s lack of wow stand out more. I can’t know what my thoughts on Back in Black would be had I not tried SSR beforehand. Since black IPAs are a style where my samples have been pretty limited it’s hard to get around the fact that SSR is a home run and everything else I’ve tried so far just…isn’t.

4.12,11.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Yields a big three finger head of deep tan color, quite airy, little dimpling, almost entirely microbubbles, the lacing is noticeably thick and sticks excellently. Not quite fully black liquid, more like brackish, muddy water, lots of brown with some yellow touches, plenty of floaties inside too. The nose has a gentle roast to it, coffee, cocoa, mocha and malted milk balls, brings some raisin to plum fruit too, nice floral dew, macadamia nuts, dried orange peel, requires concentration to register its complexity but it is there for the taking. Medium-bodied, at times a touch too foamy but calms down quickly, this added creamy texture helps reign in the hoppiness albeit it by no stretch gets close to greenness or bitter puckering. More dark chocolate and coffee bean than sweeter caramel or toffee, some milkiness though. The nuttiness higher here, that macadamia plus pecan and Brazil nuts. Conversely the citrus recedes yet you get more pine. Not sweet enough for raisin, stays in the plum, peach, cherry and apple range. Clings to your mouth pores, borderline oily. A very interesting as well as chuggable beer that is not worth getting pedantic about in terms of general categorization.","farrago","Jan 29, 2012"

This will find its way back to my fridge for sure...","wedge","Jan 03, 2012"

Bitter first sip. Not citrusy, not piney, more astringent than anything else. I cannot get a bead on any hop character, just a bitter flavor. The bitterness dissipates and gets overwhelmed by candy sweetness, which is just inconsistent with the style attempt. The fizzy thin mouth feel finishes a pretty unpleasant drinking experience. Good thing that I bought the can as a single. Don't think I'll be going back for this one. I have not had great experience with 21st Amend. but I really enjoyed their Fire Side Chat and Monks Blood.

Aroma is hoppy at first with pineapple at the fore and some grapefruit and leafy notes as well. The smell turns roasty after a few whiffs, with chocolate wafers and a bit of burnt character. Flavor puts this strictly in the 'hoppy dark beer' camp, as opposed to the 'dark hoppy beer' one. Mainly a roasty chocolatey profile with toasted bread, ash, and dark caramel to go with a dusting of citrus hops. Even the bitterness, which is moderate, seems to derive from the dark malts and not from the hops. Overall this is one of the better 'black ipa' type beers I've had.

The head quickly settles into a thin film, and coats the entire glass while you drink. Nose is all cedar and pine, with resinous wet hops aromas and a slight, sweet, molasses background. Flavors are darkly sweet in the background, with the molasses making the foundation of the flavor palate, followed quickly by a grapefruit highlight and some mid-bodied hops spicing. Some light floral notes dance around in the mouth, also. The aftertaste is cloying and hoppy, making an interesting balance. The hops presence provides a good drying end-feel to the beer, making a nice, surprisingly clean finish despite all the resiny flavors and slick, cloying mouthfeel.

Hints of cocoa and black coffee with a little bit of toffee on it as well. Doesn't stick around too long on the finish though. Not an A+ but good for what it is.

Aromas are more subdued than those of other Black IPA, and fairly straightforward: I get notes of charred pinewood that full of resin, with a distant hint cocoa nibs. Flavorwise, the char comes out with guns blazing. I was initially taken aback by its intense smokiness. Except for rauchbiers, this is as close as beer gets to tasting like the aftermath of a forest fire. Fortunately there's a lot more happening here. A pine needle bitterness is strong on the mid-palate and chocolaty sweetness comes out on the finish. This is tasty, indeed, but the strength of the charred flavors make me reluctant to follow one with another. I think this would work well with Southern BBQ or as a last beer with a chocolate or chocolate and berry dessert.","droomyster","Sep 06, 2011"

3.88,5.1,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a nice creamy looking head that just fills up the glass perfectly, the head is about a finger and a half in width and it slightly off white. I can already tell it's leaving good lacing, and it seems to be hanging around for quite some time as well. The body is pitch black with hues of brown and perhaps some red, no visibility through this beer at all. Really I'm shocked at how amazing this beer looks, the head is really kicking ass and the body back it up nicely. On the nose this beer is really nice, dark malts and perhaps a coffee smell, then in there somewhere is a nice hop aroma. It's clearly well balanced and well crafted, and maybe even complex. Is it the best smelling black IPA I've ever smelled? No, but it's pretty damn close. Overall I'm really surprised at how good this smells and tastes, I wasn't expecting this at all, lets see how it tastes. For sure not the taste I was hoping for, it's a good beer, and it has nice levels of complexity to it, it's just kinda all over the place and gross in some areas. The one offensive flavor I get it sourness, not a hop sourness or anything, just sour, its weird, and not pleasant, especially in a smoother style like a black IPA. I would actually say that the sourness is the most dominant flavor, then comes a little dark malt, a little coffee, and way too little hops. Everything is there for this beer to be really good, it just doesn't all come together. Overall I would also say that this beer is too light, you really gotta make a hell of a beer to make a good black IPA, and they skimped out on flavor. I mean you can detect all the individual flavors easily, you know they are there, but it's all just a bit watered down. Overall the taste is good, just all over the place and not as big as it should be. As for mouthfeel, the mouthfeel is actually really nice, it's got a nice thick bready feel to it, it kind of just expands in your mouth when your drinking it, the carbonation is also very very good on this beer. As for drinkability, it's good, better than it should be for the style, because it's a little watered down. Overall a great beer in every category other than taste, in taste it's good, and very tasty really, just too chaotic and watery.","MaltsOfGlory","May 15, 2011"

The nose has a distinctly chocolate graham cracker aroma with a touch of resinous and grapefruit hops. The beer is has a definitely dark chocolate and roasted grain taste, which is a bit more than expect for a beer of this style, which tends to be more restrained in its roasted profile. The beer is slightly sweet with a good bitter kick in the finish. The hops are restrained but in balance with this beer. This is definitely a more malt-forward and chocolately black ale, but still delicious. A different interpretation of the style, more like DFH India Brown Ale than Stone SSR.","Soonami","May 02, 2011"

The hops are doing their job, but the malt just lets go. This brew has a semidry finish with some faint roast and hop bitterness flavors to deal with. It seems a bit confused.

Poured a massively dark brown almost black with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight bitter hop, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight bitter hop, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was not awe-inspiring by any means, but still good. If this one had a little bit more of a hop profile going on it would have been quite good. As it was more toward the roasted side of things for the most part.

Looks good, but not quite black. Pretty interesting aroma. Very sour smelling, not citrus, like you'd think of most hoppy beers. It doesn't smell like a wild ale. This is a different kind of sour. Smells almost like lemon rinds. There's a kind of dark malt thing in there, but not really. The overall aroma seems complex, but pretty hard to pick apart. First sip is a doozey. The dark malt and hops come at you simultaneously. They create their own flavor. It's kind of an earthy, pine off-citrus flavor. At first it hits you and you think you're drinking something thats suppose to be kind of sour, but then you realize it's the hops. Then the hops and malt coalesce to create a truly unique flavor combination that I've never tasted before. At some points it aint bad, but other times I don't even want it. The finish gives off a strong lemon juice flavor. This beer is certainly a good test for the pallet, and definitely a unique experience. It is, however, probably not the best choice for a go to, casual beer.","100floods","Dec 31, 2010"

The pour left a rather magnanimous 2+ inch head, khaki-colored, breaking up in a most unique way - from within - leaving a dense, spider-web formation and somewhat generous lacing. The liquid shows dark brown initially but later reveals a deep ruby color. Very porteresque qualities burst forth in the aroma - mild sourness, light acidic pungency. The hops start to come through after a minute or so - piney and flowery - a strange contrast against the slowly increasing rounded bitter roast aromas emanating with time. That not-quite-sharp sour bite maintains a lead role in the taste throughout, poking out through a thin, depth-deprived porter flavor (a porter profile which reminded me of Yuengling Porter - which I dig). An intriguing fruitiness and Belgian dubbel characteristics show up after about 5 minutes and fill in nicely what starts off as a fairly tasty yet somewhat two-dimensional beer. It drinks equal parts light/smooth and biting and the fruitiness lingers for quite sometime. Overall, worth trying. Not sure if I'd session this, however.","Bouleboubier","Nov 11, 2010"

And I figured the can would be a big help for freshness. The beer poured a rich brown to black in the glass with a decent tan head and nice lacing throughout. Initial stout-like roasted malt in the nose, but the hops were immediately evident in the first taste. Unlike the Belgian Penombre and it's distinct hop bitterness, however, the hops here were a tad more fruity and bright. Coupled with the rich roasted flavor of the beer, it tasted a bit sour and a couple of times I checked the can to see if perhaps it was outdated. I definitely see the attraction and I did enjoy the drink, but it wasn't quite up to my expectations. Thus the less than perfect rating.","tugdriver7","Nov 01, 2010"

A little fruity in the mid-palate before a long finish with a roasted bitterness and a mild creaminess.

There is the obviously citrus and floral notes from the hops that comprise an IPA, but it's mixed with (and to a lesser degree in this instance) roasted caramel malts to give the beer a different dimension on the nose. The taste is of a pretty hoppy IPA. The main flavor is citrus specifically lemon. This causes the brunt of the bitterness that is experienced. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for what the beer actually is, and it does a service to the beer in my opinion. If you like the hops, this is highly drinkable.

It fairly successfully marries most of the flavors I like in a stout or porter with the hoppy and citrus flavors I appreciate in an IPA. Maybe I should change my favorite sort of beer to black IPA.

Color was NOT black, as a previous reviewer noted, but instead a deep, dark-brown with cola highlights. Nose was rich with piney hops. I have missed drinking IPAs with the preponderance of CANned beers coming in the form of AALs. I don't get a hop jones like I used to, but neither have I kicked the hop habit. Thank Bob that the chattering monkey on my back has gone away, though. Mouthfeel was medium with a solid hop bite initially followed by a roastiness in the mouth. Wow! What a brilliant way to play with the style. Finish was dry with a magnificent interplay between the hops and dark malts mentioned on the CAN. I am not sure that it would be terribly refreshing on the beach, but it definitely merits inclusion in the cooler in a limited quantity.

Roasted malts, piney hops, and a hint of chocolate take the main stage on the nose. Taste is the same--bright kick of resinous hops on the start, quickly overwhelmed by some dark roast malts with dark chocolate underneath. Bitterness re-emerges on the finish, which is lingering.

Some orange slices and pine sap find their way in there as well, and I assume that's some light caramel that's trying to evade me in the back. Honestly, this smells kinda weird. Hard to explain, just doesn't seem quite right. The taste is pretty hop-forward, with plenty o' citrus hops flying at me, grapefruit, orange, and lime flavors resulting. Instead of straight caramel, though, some light roasted malts make their way into town, blowin' in like the fools who always fuck with Clint Eastwood (much to their ultimate dismay). The two competing sides continue fighting throughout the tasting, making for quite a pleasant feel, all while Chubby Checker's ""Limbo Rock"" makes me wanna dance a little. Still, something's missing, leaving me ultimately unsatisfied as a whole. The body is a heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel.

This beer drink very well at cooler temps: the bright citrus hop flavors are there in the front to welcome you in while the roasted malts bring you home on the back of the palate, along with hints of caramel. Could use for a bit extra punch in the way of bittering hops. A bit thin in the body despite a nice initial creaminess.

It does smell a little bit cakey but that not necessarily bad. Has a malty flavor to it, almost to the point of tasting a little bit like whoppers. Its certainly not bad, just not really what I expected. The mouthfeel is alright. For such a dark beer it didn't seem terribly smooth. It was drinkable and if I were to drink a dark beer on a hot day, this wouldn't be a bad one to start with. All in all an enjoyable drink.","404UGA","Jul 28, 2010"

3.78,2.4,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Not quite black in color so the name is misleading. Dark brown with a large tan head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is really weak. I just pick up some citrus hops. Sufficiently hoppy flavor giving citrus hints. The dark malt is used more than just color. I do get some roasted malt in the flavor. Bitterness is moderate and at 65 IBUs, well represented. The body is a little more thick and chewy than most IPAs and I credit that to the dark malts. Nice carbonation. Available in cans so the drinkability automatically goes up. Has a couple of weaknesses but otherwise a solid IPA.","morimech","Jul 24, 2010"

Chocolate notes, some brown sugar, slight alcohol. Sharp, piney bitterness, juicy grapefruit flavour, malty sweetness and cocoa towards the end. Very creamy texture with fine carbonation, but the body felt a bit light. I liked it and I'm glad I picked up a six-pack.","DrJay","Jul 22, 2010"

3.23,-12.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Had this on tap at Stub n Herb's. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Aroma is like a little baby Darkness. Nice roastiness with huge hop presence, but on a lighter scale. Hops are nicely balanced with the roasted malts when it's cold, but becomes overly hoppy as it warms, which throws it out of balance. The last few swigs of the goblet yielded a bitter, minty, herbal hop flavor that just didn't mesh well with the dull roastiness. I would have liked more sweetness in this beer accentuate the hops, but it wasn't bad when it was cold.","KeefD","Jan 31, 2010"

Thin creamy head, disappears quickly but leaves lots of lacing. Taste: lots of grapefruit but some pine. Thick mouthfeel, almost like a Russian imperial. Bizarre (and has some palette dissonance) to have this palette with the hop profile. Back end has a peculiar combo of hop bitterness and stout bitterness. I love this beer. Well balanced.

It tastes excellent as it has a nice coffee and roasted taste which compliment that big hops very well, this beer is very drinkable as it doesnt have that ""back of your throat dryness"" that some IPAs tend to exhibit.

Anyway, the beer pours an opaque dark brown with purplish highlights and a good creamy mocha head that leaves excellent lacing. I'm not really sure how to rate the appearance of an intentionally dark IPA, which was certainly not to style, but I like how it looked. The aroma was very close to the IPA, strong, rich hop aromas of pine and spruce with a tinge of citrus and herbs. The flavor brings the dark malt into play with subtle roasted notes underlying the strong hop flavors. I've only had one other dark IPA that I can think of, Stone's 11th/Sublimely Self Righteous, and while they have different hop bills, they're similarly delicious. It's a great variant on the style but oddly rare among commercial brewers, although the homebrew community seems to have embraced it.","popery","May 30, 2009"
