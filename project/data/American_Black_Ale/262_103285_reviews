"Look is dark and creamy, but the feel is not creamy. Not a whole lot as far as smell goes. Expected more hoppiness. Smooth, bitter taste as expected. Overall a good Ipa!"
""
"Strong aroma hops with hints of roasted malts. Dry on the palate with strong smokey toasted malts, almost on the verge of ashy flavors from off roasting temps."
""
"Black draft pour, beige head with great lacing. Hop nose. Smooth malt foundation balances hops. Medium lite mouthfeel with bitter tongue coating. Tasty black IPA."

"22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A great black IPA flavor that I've come to known and enjoy.  This one boasts 7 malts, 7 hops, and 7%.  One delicious balanced beer worth getting."

"Not quite black, dark but reddish hues when held up to light.  Small tan head, little lacing.  Smells of hops and malt giving IPA moniker credence.  Taste, bittered hops, somewhat like it might have rye.  Mouthfeel is not on par with an American IPA but carbonation is present."
""
""
"I have enjoyed the entire holiday pack, it was a treat I will repeat next year"
"Mouthfeel was on the light and mild side with an average body, average carbonation and a slight bitterness that trailed off dry with hop sweetness and burnt malt smokiness. Gotta get up to Clifton Park soon and drink at the brewery, this was a damn tasty beer and one I will seek out again if they keep making it."
"It's good.   Holy crap the rating system is ridiculous!"

"First of all, what the hell is a black IPA?  Definitely not pale. This is disappointing. Too smoky, no floral notes. Blah"
"This one tastes quite bland to me. Not really bad just nothing special."

"16 oz. bottle. Nice Black IPA."

""
"Overall:  There is a lot of interesting malt complexity in this beer and I find that I prefer sorting through that aspect of the beer rather than thinking about the hop bill, which though bitter, is more one dimensional"

"Deep black coffee blended wonderfully with sweet chocolate malt in a smooth brew with substantial feel. Piny hops are just right in this equation."
""
"Poured a deep brown, almost impervious to light. A hint of light that sneaks in illuminates a ruby hue. The head is light tan and creamy, leaving stick lacing and holding on well in to the beer. The aroma is lighter with hints of dark sweet fruit and pine. The taste is unique, but hard to describe.  Robust roast malts, light hops, hints of sweetness are all present. The body has a nice silkiness to it with just a little bite from the hops and a light amount of carbonation. A unique brew."

"Had this at the pre opening of the new yard house ."

"Overall, this was a surprise.  I've not yet embraced the Black IPA style, but this really opened my eyes to the possibilities of this style.  Definitely worth a try."

"D: This was a below average black IPA, with scent and taste that were more malty than hoppy. The body wasn't right either, but the finish was smooth, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Not worth trying more than once."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid American black ale. It does not really offer anything new, but it is doubtful that it would disappoint fans of the style."
""
""
"Overall this is a well crafted brew, a nice use of divergent ingredients to make a cohesive brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This Black IPA has nice flavors of burnt and roasted malts but seemed like it could have had a little more in the way of bitterness and crispness from the hops."

"Not my cup of tea. This is a well-brewed beer, but it's the least enjoyable beer I think I've had from Shmaltz. I wouldn't recommend it, nor would I ever want to buy this again."

"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Very dark, brownish-black with the odd reddish glint, topped by a rich creamy tan head around an inch high. Features a massive hop aroma, mainly canned mandarin with some grapefruit and pine, along with charred grain, chocolate, and raisin. Fantastic aroma that contrasts with the palate, not necessarily in a negative way. This one favors the dark malts, some charred grain as on the nose, dark roast coffee, and dry cacao powder with the citrus and tropical hop flavors in the background. Some dark cherry and peach flavors peeking through. Eventually the malts recede a little and a hop spice supplants to an extent, dried citrus rind and pepper along with something quite floral. Fairly thick but certainly not particularly sweet, moderately carbonated and with a bold, oily, spicy, slightly singed finish that goes for miles. If you focus you can still taste the orchard fruit in there amongst the roasted malts and bitter citrus/pine. More roasted that some of the other black IPAs I've tried of late but the bitter, spicy hops do reveal themselves over the course of a pint, blossoming into something rather intense. As usual, this brewery wins with an amusing name and great look on top of the layers of flavor."

"This is just a really really good beer. Solid effort all around from the folks at Schmaltz. Clever name, fun label, delicious beer. I would revisit this in the future without hesitation. Cheers."
""
"Overall - a good bipa, though I was hoping for a little more citrus presence."

"This might be one of the best (if not the best) black IPA I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Easy to drink and enjoy, and welcoming to those who would rather not drink a hoppy beer. This is a must have and will hopefully become a regular in the He'Brew stable!"

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and pretty good example of a Black IPA, it had just about all the aspects that I look for in the style and the balance seemed to be pretty good with neither the hops or malts being too overpowering. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little sticky, slightly crisp, a little rich, slightly filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, but I don't think it would be a chore for me to drink a full bottle by myself and I think this is a nice beer to enjoy on the cooler days of spring. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this is pretty much a text book example of the style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the citrus hop aspect that I got in the aroma didn't stick out more in the taste, I think that held this beer back just a little. I would probably buy another bottle of this, but I don't know if I would get more than that and I would recommend it as good Black IPA. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and it did a good just at satisfying my craving for a good Black IPA. This isn't my favorite Black IPA, but i think it's close to some of the better one I've had and so far it's one of the better beers I have tried from Shmaltz. Good job guys, this was a pretty good Black IPA, keep up the good work."
"Quite delicious. Do love that Smaltz."

"hands down the best schmalz brew I've had, its fantastic, and a pleasant surprise for me. jet black in color, really really dark, with over an inch of tannish head, frothy and unfading. it has a nose nowhere near as hoppy as i expected, and its got more pine resin than bitterness to it, which is also a welcomed surprise. the malt is dominant though, dark like a stout, but with a lightness to the feel by both a softer body and upbeat carbonation. there is a nice char coffee bitterness on the front end, and the christmas tree type hops on the finish, with only moderate bitterness. its clean finishing for its size, i think the grain bill is really awesome on it, 7 malts, they don't tell you which, but its done right. i have yet to really be impressed with anything from these guys, but this to me is an overwhelming success, and one of the best black india pale ales in recent memory for me. its super dark and chalky textured, and its not over hopped. rock solid."

"Overall - Shmaltz delivers a black IPA with a well-rounded roasted malt/cocoa flavour. Citrus hops are present in taste, though would be nice to pick it up more strongly in the aroma as well. Otherwise, an enjoyable black IPA."

"Pours a rich coffee brown with a thick and rather fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some good lacing. Smoky aroma has a strong hoppy overtone and subtle notes of chocolate, coffee and molasses. Flavor blends elements of a good IPA with those of a good stout: woody, hoppy, chocolate, coffee, brown sugar all make their appearances on the palate. Firm, smooth texture has some good fizz. A wonderful tribute."

"This is the perfect ale for turning a corner- it formally buries the limitations of yesterday and signaling a new step toward promise, dedication and the impossible. Well done Shmaltz Brewing Company!"

"Taste-Dark, toasted malt, piney hops, white grapefruit rind bitterness that rides to the finish. A nicely hoppy black ale that drinks like a black IPA. Hopheads, enjoy!"

"A thorough enough version of this hybrid American style, the blackened malt and peppy hops playing well together, with a perhaps game-saving cocoa essence that has the good sense to not really let go of my palate. As always, He'Brew comes through, and this time, wholly on their own terms. Congrats!"

"This is a very easy to drink beer. I don't need blustering beers anymore. Something well rounded and even-keeled will do just fine."
""
"O: Great brew."
""
"Pours a deep cola color with a thick light beige head atop that settles ever so slowly into a frothy mass.Dark bread and earth stand out in the nose,very mild sweetness going on here.Dry and roasted on the palate,actually very dry with even a hint of smoke,although no big citrusy or piney hops the dryness stands out.There is almost a ""meatiness"" to this beer like an old school English porter wich is pretty cool but nothing like alot of the hoppy black ales you see right now.I like it but was taken back by the flavor profile."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with slightly acrid roast and hop qualities in the flavor."
""
"Death of a Contract Brewer is a bombastic black IPA that makes no apologies for not only being a very bitter beer, but also having an insanely roasted malt bill. This combo makes for a trying beer experience. Even beer drinkers that enjoy smoked malts with a meaty edge may find this one hard to put down."
""
""
""
"Really a very drinkable black IPA. Remarkable deep dark taste that is nearly bottomless. Hints of licorice and a touch of incinerated toast. Plenty of bitterness with drinkability unimpaired. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
""
"Overall: One of the more enjoyable beers of this style I have had, namely because it tastes like a separate style for once as opposed to an IPA that happens to be a different color. I'd be more than happy to drink this one again and again. Cheers to Schmaltz for no longer being contracted and opening their own facilities!"
"Well now. I didn't expect such a smooth and tasty treat, yet this beer delivers, no question. It combines the hop nose and flavor like a well-hopped west coast IPA with the tasty, smooth maltiness of a classic English porter. Supposedly just a one-time collaboration, but I'd like to see this one brewed by someone, somewhere, with a wide distribution. This probably won't happen, but this initial experience leave me wanting more."

"Bottom Line: One of the best Black IPAs on the market, available in variety pack and 22oz both at good price points. Worth your time just to expand your palate"

"Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, nearly opaque with a one finger tan head with great retention and lacing. Nice aroma of toasted malt, citrus hops, chocolate and coffee, lightly piney and floral; a lot going on there. Flavor begins with medium dark malt, citrus hops, citrus rind and then develops more intense citrus rind and grapefruit hoppiness. Finishes with hoppy bitterness and hints of roasted malt and char and pleasant faint coffee and chocolate. Medium bodied with good carbonation. The flavor does not follow up on the superb aroma that alternately smells like a choclate stout and then a citrus IPA; the flavor leans more towards the IPA side with toasted malt and chocolate and coffee elements as suggestions on the side. The toasty elements are quite good, but I'm left wishing for a bit more robustness. Still a very nicely made and balanced IPA style black ale that could pass for an imperial for the flavor robustness. Contratulations to Shmaltz on their new brewery; I'm happy to drink this to that!"

"overall - just okay compared to many of Schmaltz's other brews."

"Overall: A pretty solid take on a black ale. Good balance between the spicy hops and roasty malt."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours clear nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, tangerine, cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, cocoa, roasted malt, chocolate, toast, light char, floral, grass, pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest/rind, cocoa, roast, chocolate, toast, light char, pine, floral, and grass on the finish for a good bit. Very nice compexity and balance of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately crisp, sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Black IPA style. All around good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O-First, let me say what a good-looking black ale this is! Moving on...this is a decent example of a black ale with a good balance between citrus-forward hops and dark, chocolatey malt flavors. I could use more oomph on the nose, and the feel was strange, but the flavor is pretty solid. The hops may have faded a bit in this bottle, but I still detect a decent bit of citrus up front, which provides a nice contrast the cocoa-flavored finish. Not bad."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good smoky representation of style, it’s a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for something a bit different."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, hops. Taste is citrus hops up front, a bit of roasted malts kicking in later, well balanced and enjoyable. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a tasty and quality beer."
"O: Not bad, not great. I was hoping for better - I love this style when done right - but I'm not entirely disappointed and am having no problem putting down this bomber."
