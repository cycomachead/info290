"Dark copper color, almost completely opaque. Clean sharp mouthfeel with a subtle hoppy aftertaste. Taste is deep and complex with strong coffee notes and hints of caramel and plum."
""
""
""
""
"Very strong liquorice smell, taste was more bitter than I'm used to (first double IPA I've ever had, so that should have been expected) but it definitely improved as I got further down the glass. Was very nice to finish."
""
"This one pours black with red highlights and a mocha head. The smell is malty and hoppy, sweet with a hint of smoke.  The taste is malty with a hop finish that is a bit bitter, and you can't really tell its high ABV. Medium mouthfeel, nice big flavors, a very hearty beer. Overall good flavors, if it were a bit more smooth it would be amazing."
"I like many quite bitter beers but this one is not entirely pleasing to my palate. Not a fan of the charred flavor mingling with the hop notes."

"Lame what do I need this for beer, love founders, but this beer belongs in the toilet. Flavor is almost zero. No one is perfect.."
"My second favorite black ale. That taste is that of dark Belgian chocolate, Nicaraguan tobacco, sweet cherries, and a nice malt backbone."
""
""
""
""
"Highly hoppy to begin with a sweeter aftertaste, the hops don't smell as strong, it's a beer for the IPA crowd, the less IPA centered crowd won't appreciate this as much...it's more a sipping beer, something to be enjoyed in a more lengthy fashion"

"3.78/5.00"

"This was a good IPA overall. I was a big fan of the color and the mouthfeel. The taste however which is the most important aspect, was only okay."
"This beer is a monster. Did you read the official style? Imperial Black India Pale Ale. This one has a huge presence without being overdone in any sense. It's probably the most well-balanced BIPA I've ever had. I've yet to try a Founder's beer I didn't like, but this one might be my new favorite (well, second only to FBS, of course)."

"O: Very good. More complexity than most black IPAs and it has a nice malty character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good for the style. I prefer a sweeter beer like black perle - the bitter hops dominate in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"On the palette extremely rich and complex. Initially sweet chocolate gives way to burnt coffee bean, dark bitter chocolate, black licorice, hints of smoke with lots of piney-soapy-resiny hops. The finish is long lasting."

""
""
""
""
""
"Just too much hops and bitterness for me."
""
"taste: Seems tamer up front with a more subtle blend of malty and hoppy. The finish is out of this world, lasts forever with the dry hoppy bitter and light malty blooming and blooming."

"First, I was relieved it was not a rye IPA (don't shoot, but rye isn't my thing). I've had it bottled and draft and both left a gorgeous lace. The aroma isn't anythjng to write home about and the feel is a little lighter than what it looks like (but for a black IPA its on point). I really enjoyed the flavor and the bitter ending to each sip. It's my latest crush and I am excited to drink it while this winter apocalypse continues."
"I really don't enjoy imperial blacks or pale ales and yet, this beer is very, very good. The look is muddy, but it smells great; great!!!  surprisingly smooth and not as bitter as a lot of pales"
""

"From a hophead pov, I am caught in between saying nice, dark IPA or noting a clash of malt vs hop. I enjoyed this beer, but the high ABV will be noticeable by the less experienced. I think the sweeter malt taste was more present, but understand those noting the hop bitterness. For all that is going on, I thought it was fairly drinkable. Founders has the right idea here, just needs a little more tweaking. Not many of this style are better, though. Good flavors yet still crispy, clean in some aspects. Worth a try or a couple, I'll bet this steps ip a notch on draft."
""
""
"The head is about a half finger but it looks super dense and mainly mid-sized bubbles which lends visual texture without sacrificing retention, the lacing is a bit wispy but spreads over a wide area of the available glass sides. The liquid is not quite opaque and up close you really see how clear it is, basic brown color, no bubbles to be seen except a few here and there near the surface, actually looks like a “tweener.” In the nose the roast comes through like a bell, coffee and mocha, behind that is caramel, butterscotch and coconut, at turns gets close to being peaty, mild apricot and cherry fruit scents, with all of that maltiness the burst of herbaceousness is a jolting reminder that technically it is an IPA. Medium-bodied, lacking in the carbonation department which saps some of the life which would truly make this a superlative beer. Dark chocolate, coffee beans, toasted coconut shake hands with pine sap, leafy matter, and white grapefruit zest. While bitter you easily adjust to it. Nothing about this is shy nor retiring, it is not an easy sipper. For as much zigging and zagging as you get, it still manages to hold it together. Vibrant, good naturedly argumentative."

"For me one of the definitive beers of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured almost a thick pitch black, and the smell was dominated by malt and alcohol; almost no hop presence. Tasted very similar to the smell with some added sweetness. Overall, too sweet, boozy, thick, and malty to be associated with IPAs."
""
""
""
"355ml bottle. Best By 17/07/2015. Pours a very dark mahogany colour with a creamy tan head which left some excellent lacing. Initial aroma of pine and tropical fruit before some roasted notes are detected also some dark chocolate. Medium to high bitterness and light sweetness. Medium to full bodied, smooth sticky texture and a long, dry, complex bitter finish with some alcohol warmth. Another nice drop from founders. 8."
""
""
"On draft at a local bar.  Quite foamy, poured dark red.  Initial taste was malty but overcome with bitter pine.  Too bitter for me."
""
""
""
""
"This has a mellowed hop presence. The roasty coffee-dark chocolate notes dominate, although they’re backed with a touch of green-grapefruit citrusy hops. The flavor has a pleasing, pungent bitterness up front and a tapered bitter-roast that lingers. More green grapefruit hop character and a bit of chocolate-coffee roast play nicely together. Enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"Pours very dark reddish amber. Big pine nose, floral and roasted malts. Tastes of dry pine, roasted malts, chocolate, floral and some wheat. Medium body, pine resin on the lips and palate as well as dark malts."
"A very strong imperial black IPA. Biting alcohol feel, but very nice hops. Malts are sweet and raisiny."

"All said, really enjoying it sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold February afternoon!"

"Just because you are SUPPOSED to like something, doesn't mean you should."

"On tap at WOB Easton"
"I'm enjoying this beer quite a bit, but more as a novelty of what beer can be than as something I find genuinely delicious. I imagine it'd pair VERY well with syrupy-sweet barbecue or bulgolgi, and just might make a second review for that pairing."
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit too bitter for me.  Can't say I'm a fan of the style."
""
""
""
"O- The booziness is a bit annoying, but as far as black IPAs go, this is a fairly balanced and tasty one. It's not particularly special though, I would really rather have Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous over this one."
""
""
""

"The flavor is darker than the smell--more burnt elements.  The hop bitterness is also stronger--very much a black IPA.  A bit harsh, the aftertaste goes on seemingly forever.  Full bodied with a low level of carbonation, this is a rich beer.  The flavor is equally complex--slightly sweet, but more bitter.  Chewy."
"Overall:  I could smell the beer all day but the balance I picked up in the aroma is not what arrives on the palate; sadly, the clash of the flavors on my palate really limited my enjoyment of this beer - often a problem with the American Black style"
"wanted just a bit more"
"This is a great, utterly dark, nearly black beer.  The head is a creamy tan.  The smell is malty, with some chocolate and dark fruit notes...Spicy hops as well.  Intense flavor...lots of sweetness, malt, and highly roasted flavors, combined with a serious hop bitterness. Hefty body and very satisfying."
""
"A bit too hoppy for a black ale for my taste."
""
""
"O: Overall not usually a fan of the style with a great deal of samples being homogeneously the same, this one for sure stands out with a bold roasted character and a hop bitterness that sets it apart."
""
""
""
""
"-- Whoa - *way* over on the hoppy end of the Black IPA scale. IBUs are big and the aroma is lean old school citrus-and-pine (Chinook and Centennial, as it turns out). A hit of roasty sweetness in the form of burnt sugar is about the only nod to blackness. That keeps it from getting sticky, and it’s somehow not hot, which adds up to it being super drinkable. Overall, colossal. 4.25"

"This is truly a nasty brew and a well made one. My sample was bottled in October and drank in January and it was fine - it had a major edge to it still."
""
"Overall: Definitely a powerful brew with big delicious flavors and an uncompromisingly bitter finish. Glad I tried it but probably won't get it again. Generally I prefer more subtlety and balance in my IPAs."
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on January 24, 2015."
"Pours a very dark brown (bordering on black until you shine a light into it) with ruby hints when held to the light,  producing 3+ fingers of frothy, moderately lasting, khaki head that leaves a collar ring & patches of chunky lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, earthy floral & a little pine, with roasted notes of chocolate intermingled with hints of anise, molasses & very faint coffee. Taste is grapefruit hoppy-roast fronted but by mid-sip is citrus, Hershey's chocolate syrup & semisweet chocolate with caramel, molasses & a little coffee, in the finish it transitions to more bitter pine dominant hops backed up by citrus, smoke, & burnt malts, becoming a hop bitter/burnt chocolate malt aftertaste. There is a plastic/phenolic presence briefly, but definitely on my palate, in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden in both the nose and mouth for an 8.9 ABV; very little warmth but some alcohol bitterness and perhaps spice in the mouth. There is dark wheat malt in this but I do not pick it up in either the nose or mouth. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, creamy & mildly chewy with a little prickle in the finish. I agree (as I often do) with Jweave, WOW & well done Founders!!!"

"Pours a near pitch black with a little more than lace of head. Smells a little sweet with hints of roasted malt. Tastes a little bourbon like but with roasted malts. goes down smooth initially and then a bitterness at the end. After a few sips you can really sense the alcohol. Overall it's very drinkable."

"Overall, very enjoyable, and a nice deviation from the standard IPA formula"

"12 oz bottled on 09/10/2014, still fresh with a nice light tan head.  Great roasted malt up front with plenty of bitterness with the 100 IBUs to finish it off.  Very drinkable beer to enjoy."

"Pretty smooth for 100 IBU's...another great beer from Founders, good job guys!"
""
""

"O-Alcohol well hidden, well balanced"

"Nice stout mildly thick with decent flavor and nice aroma"
""
""

"Got this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised.  Really liked it and would try again.  Very  easy to drink.  Not boozy and enjoyed the roasty aspects of it.  Well done and not over the top."
""
""
""
""
"A very fine dark IPA."
""
"Pours an opaque black, almost seems to absorb the light around it.  Aroma is dark fruit, bread and booze.  Taste is dark fruit, rye bread, grass, earth and bitterness.  Overall, I like the balance of hop bitterness and dark roasted malts.  A very good double version of my favorite ipa style."

"Picked a single 12 oz. bottle out of a line up to-go at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. Carefully poured at home in to a IPA glass, giving ample time to let the experience unfold. The beer is a translucent, chestnut brown during the pour, but black and foreboding when it collects in the glass. Completely opaque. Slow rising carbonation yields a single finger of beige foam. In time the foam dissolves leaving some oily hop residue on the surface. No lacing. A burnt caramel aroma mingles with some minty pine hops, underscored by freshly baked dark breads. Altogether, it yields a feigned impression of rye with some nice floral hops. A complex and inviting nose. The initial sip is dominated by tart citrus bitterness with thin cocoa in the background. There's faint smoke with an earthy, herbal flavor throughout.  The finish is relatively dry. The aftertaste is where this beer shines, with a dark chocolate citrus flavor reminiscent of an orange truffle. The mouthfeel is medium-full with soft prickly carbonation. Quite nice. The alcohol in this beer is incredibly well hidden. In fact, it wasn't until I sensed a small buzz that I checked the label. I was shocked to see 8.9% ABV. Of course that is not unreasonable in the world of double IPA's, but it never occurred to me that this one was in that league. That's a testament to the quality of this brew. I would have preferred a bit more sweetness and balance but there's little to complain about here.  What you'll find is a fine example of assertive hops with a little chocolate & roast to add complexity. Another solid Founders creation. Would you expect anything less?"

"Overall- Nothing special, but a solid black ipa.  Too much pine for me and I wish the ""black"" portion of this was emphasized more, especially with chocolate.  Probably wouldn't bother trying to pick this up again."

""
""
"I prefer New Glarus Blacktop, Southern Tier Iniquity, and Lake Louie Radio Free IBA."
""
"A world class Black IPA from Founders. Dark as night with a ruby red undertone on the color. Roasted notes and vibrant grassy hops on the nose. This somehow melds a dark roasty malt backend with an aggressive hop profile yet remains balanced. The alcohol content is high - this is a sipper that opens up new notes when it warms. Lots of complexity here with a slight anise and licorice feel that comes in near the end. Pleasantly bitter with a smooth mouthfeel."
"This beer was poured from a 12oz bottle into a Blind Pig mug and enjoyed at apx 55F."
"As it warms it takes on some less favorable hop flavors with lowers it's enjoyment value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For someone who isn't a fan of the style, I've found a Black IPA in my fridge more often than I've thought. This one has been the best of the bunch."
"Solid, but very bitter. Little sweet on the first sip, can't quite figure out what hops the notes are, slightly piny tho. Good but not great"
""
"Pours a black color.  1/4 inch head of an off-tan color.  Decent retention and decent lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, sight roasted malt, hops, pine, and alcohol.  Fits the style of an American Black Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  There are also noticeable levels of dryness and bitterness.  Tastes of slight roasted malt, hops, sweet malt, slight pine, and alcohol.  Overall, weak appearance, strong aroma and body, and a good blend."
""
"o: honestly, not my favorite beer of the style.  there are nice flavors in here, however they're not harmonized in the best of ways, and i would like a little bit more citrusy-sweetness in here.  also,  a bit of harshness in here, but not so much off-putting that i would say its awful.  there are definitely better examples of the style out there though"

"O: good brew from founders and the 100ibus kick it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this pairing of conventional IPA bitterness with darker malt offers little more than the sum of its parts.  It's a fair foray on the part of Founders, but it falls short of their finer offerings (though I give them props for the sweet label art)."
""
"This is a big beer done well.  Lots of bold flavors that meld together nicely."
""
"I think I have come to the conclusion that the Black IPA is simply not my style. While I don't find any true flaws, and there's nothing bad or offensive about it, I just dont think I'll spend the money on this one again. Looks like a stout. Tastes like an IPA with a burnt malt flavor on the tail end. Not very drinkable. Overall, give me a Centennial IPA, and I'll be happy."
""
""
""
"D: This was an ok black IPA, with scent mostly just like an IPA. The taste wasn't as good, although the finish was smooth enough. The body was nice, and the alcohol was fairly well hidden, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Average brew for the style, but I expect better from Founders."
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer, but I was expecting more from them..bottled on 9/10/2014, that might have something to do with it.."
""
""
""
""
"I have to say, this is much better with about 3 months on it. The first time I had it fresh it was just bitter and did not have allot of character.  Now that it hung  around in the fridge for a few months  it has developed nice citrus fruit notes that were masked in bitterness when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A smooth IPA for someone who does not usually like IPAs"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty much exactly what I expected an Imperial Black Ipa to be. The nice part about it is that the added malt heft sweetens things a bit and tempers that expected double dose of bitterness. If you like the style, you will want to try this."
""
""
""
"Overall I know this is a pretty rough style of beer for most palates but i really enjoy it as it combines my favorite two styles.  Definitely recommend if you want a rough and tumble roasty hoppy brew that is blended very nicely!"
""

""
""
""

"It's a Founders IPA gone dark. Follows their pattern of deeply roasted malts and hits a particular hop profile. It's good but not strong for their lineup."
"Not what I'd expected from Founder's. Very bitter and lacking of complexity. Maybe my bottle was past it's prime (bottled 10-2014). 2.8"

"3.03/5: Founders makes some fantastic brews...this isn't one of them"

"Pours nearly black with a medium beige head. Aroma is a sweet pine citrus, almost some lemon notes, dark mildly roasted dark malt. Taste the same, as aroma with a good amount of hops bitterness. A medium bodied, slightly oily mouth feel with good carbonation on the palate. The finish is sweet pine, citrus notes with a nice wallop of bitter hops and slightly dry ending. Ending is good dry hoppy but very palatable. Overall a very good tasty brew."

""
""
""
""
"I usually write a more in-depth ""overall"" summary, but let's just say that beers like this are the reason why Founders continues to take so much of my money."

"The body is medium-full and very bright, moderate in both crispness and smoothness but very consistent from front to finish."
"Great black IPA, smooth finish"
"O: Another fantastic beer from Founders, they never seem to let us down, one of the best black IPA's I have ever had hands down, lots of great IPA notes on this one."

"This is a good beer, but it isn’t anything particularly different from what I’ve had before, and certainly not befitting a new style designation.  It’s just a hoppy imperial stout.  If that’s what you’re looking for, then give it a try.  But it’s a bit of a stretch calling it an ""Imperial Black India Pale Ale."""

"Overall - I haven't had many imperial black ales, but this one is excellent and memorable. Delicious, deep, complex, bold, and balanced nicely. And a perfect transition that begs the next sip. A must try in my opinion, and quite possibly sets the bar for the style. Another great Founders offering."

"O: Not my favorite style (though one I still drink pretty frequently)  but from a brewery I really respect so I felt obligated to try this one...and I'm glad that I did because I really enjoyed it (sometimes the combination of roasted malts and hop profiles do not match on my palate). Easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am very glad that I had not decided to write this review until the fourth time that I had tried this beer. At first the bitterness completely overpowers the rest of the beer, but, as I've found more and more with Founder's beers and I can't help but be redundant, the more you try it, it's almost as if it has such a perfect medley of flavors that you can choose the characteristics that you want from it, it can either be a bitter, crisp, hoppy pale ale or a smooth, malty sweet dark beer with beautiful undertones of pine and roasted chestnut. By meditation one can transcend the bitterness. A definite addition to my regular rotation of craft brews when it's available."

"The palate is where the 100 IBUs are noticeable. Plenty of bitterness, earthy, minty, pine like with some grapefruit rind, this is a heck of bitter beer. This is followed by a moderate hop flavor with pine and some malt - dark caramel,  cocoa, a little toffee bitterness. Drying and bitter on the finish with lingering pine and grapefruit, this beer is medium in body and moderately carbonated. Very nice."

"Pours a three finger, very light tan head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Deep brown/ruby color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Citrus hop nose and flavor is grapefruit with good malts balancing the 100 IBUs. The higher ABV is hidden. $3.99 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."

"Yes, this was strong but the balance and nice meld of flavors was what did it for me, when it came to masking the presence of this beer's strength. There wasn't a lot of lacing in my glass as there was just a hint of a few rings along the back side after each sip. No matter - this had a nice warming effect on me and went down easily given its potency. The slight amount of resin to the mouthfeel combined with the lingering roasted nature of this led to the nice balance that I enjoyed, and I look forward to having another one of these come the dead of winter!"
"Cheers!"

"Overall, well let's just say that toothpaste is great, and orange juice is also great, but when you blend them they suck. Same with these flavor profiles."
""
""
"Overall:  Very nice and typical of the better versions of Black IPA.  Founders is living up to its reputation of producing enjoyable and solid brews.  It is very drinkable, well balanced and covers the alcohol content well with taste and feel.  Great beer for cold evenings!   Will certainly add this to my favorites list."
""
""

"What you get is a dark, almost black, citrusy IPA that's given a bit more depth of character through dark malts. That's not to say that other black IPAs don't have the same roastiness and bittersweet chocolate characteristics, but they're a little bit fuller here. It seems to teeter, in fact, sometimes displaying more of the citrusy hops, and other times offering more of the toastiness, roastiness, nuttiness, deep caramel, and dark/bittersweet chocolate notes. Somehow the alcohol never really shows itself, although there are suggestions of it in the splash of dryness that hits you at the finish. But again, where this beer could have hit you with a long-lingering bitter and roasty finish, there's none of that... instead, it somehow manages to squeeze out a bit of sweetness that seems like a combination of very light creamy caramel and burnt (or nearly burnt) sugar. In that way Founders has done an excellent job in formulating an almost compellingly drinkable ""Imperial Black India Pale Ale"". Well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A very hop-forward brew, but with roasted malts as a backbone.  The experience is solid, the brew an interesting mingling of styles that works.  Not an everyday brew, and one to select with care, because this will trash your palate."

"BOD 9/10/14  Clear, almost black pour, that under strong light appears as a very deep dark ruby.  Normal head volume, above average retention and lacing.  Nice nose of blended hops (citrus, rind and pine) over a slight biscuit/caramel  sweetness with a spicy note. As it warms, alcohol and char notes are present.  Almost medium body with a bit of slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is a bit intense, yet well balanced with subtle complexities, for this hop forward ale.  It begins with pine and grapefruit rind hop flavors that slowly yield to a medium bitterness.  As the bitterness fades in the middle, caramel sweetness comes forward providing a well constructed balance.  As this fades, tropical hop notes, a bit of char and peppery spice notes come forward.  The finish is long and leaves you with a strong alcohol note and back of the throat burn. A sweet bitterness lingers."

"mouthfeel was smooth and overall a darn good bolder of a black ipa."
"Dark Penance is something I could have before, during, or after a meal (depending on what's being served). Its combination of peach, caramel, coffee, and pine flavours affords it tremendous versatility. It's equally suitable as a little, late evening sip as it is a sociable, semi-sessionable quaffer. A more easy-going offering than it lets on, don't be at all afraid to pick up a full four pack."
""
"O: this is an interesting beer I've never been crazy about black IPAs because usually the roast taste over powers the beer but this is very smooth and the fruit taste is dynamite it just doesn't linger like a regular IPA the malts just cut it short. it's a pretty good beer. Worth grabbing if you don't even like the style."
"Finishing off my drinking day with my least favorite style done my one of my favorite brewers.  Gotta love conflict, right?  This stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of dark khaki foam.  Hm, you'd think darkness was a theme here...  The nose comprises pine resin, mixed greens, and light dry maple syrup.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of treacly roasted malts.  A good amount of bitterness pervades.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather drying finish.  Overall, though my opinion on the style has not changed, Founders has made a black IPA that I don't hate.  I'll likely not have another, but the balance between the bittering agents (the hops and the roast) assures that at least I won't be looking back at this beer in anger (so no worries, Gallagher Brothers...)."

"Overall: I think this one is what it is. If you are looking for more in your face flavors then this is the one you need to go for. If you are looking for a more refined and polished beer. WJ is it. I found WJ to be really a lot more balanced when trying them side by side. Now, on a different night this one may taste different to me. But I felt like Wookey Jack was the better of the two. I am a big fan of Founder's but this one is not among my favorites from them."

"Great Beer!"

""
"Got to hand it to Founders, not only do they brew a Black IPA, but its Imperial strength and 100 IBUS!  With that this beer was not very fun to drink.  Over the top bitter and the alcohol burn at the end made me question whether this was beer or a gin mixed with a black ipa.  Founders is about pushing boundaries and brewing beers for rebels and renegades so props for staying true to philosophy.  However this was a miss fire by Founders"

"Boldly black and relatively well balanced, once it is malty but doesn't strike sweet given its generous hops counterbalancing it."

"Dark malt start then slight ipa finish"

"Overall, it is hard to find a Founders release that disappoints.  With this one we found a hugely surprising degree of bittering char and leathery bite from the massive malt character.  Unlike your typical black IPA, however, we missed that overly sweetened hop profile to bring you into that beautiful blend that you look for.  With that said, this was a very simple beer.  To compare, last years “Inspired Artist” took on that fantastic balance, with fruitiness of hops big enough to meet the dark malt profile.  Here, with a presumably imperial version of that recipe, the char takes us to a whole new level of darkness that lets little escape beyond it.  We have been sitting on this one a couple weeks longer than most everyone else, but we don’t feel that the hops would fade much in that time to allow for such a presentation."

"Overall: I treated it like a DIPA, just the way it tasted. True hoppy taste with the right touch of bitter fruit."

"Pours an extraordinarily deep brown, with a thin tan head that just won't give up. The head has nice soapy lacing. The aroma I get is big pine and floral hops. The taste is equally huge in the hops department, with the malt backbone subtly holding the whole thing up, adding just enough sweetness and smoothing out what could be an overwhelming hops assault. The body is nicely weighted and smooth on the palate. This is a delicious hop bomb."

""
""
"Black in color and yet it does show some transparency when held up to light.  A trace of head is just detectable on the majority of the beer and is more apparent around the rim.  Brussels lacing.  Aggressive aroma of piny hops with dark malt as a background note.  That piny hop flavor starts off very boldly and then is slowly tempered by sweet dark malt.  The fade again features the piny hops and the finish is sweet and dry.  The mouth is also sticky from the abundant pine like hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts out with a roasty toasty malt backing which quickly gives way to a strong pine hop bitterness, a good balance between the two with the hops taking the lasting edge, nice soft yet ample carbonation, finishes slightly dry and makes you wanting another sip, alcohol is well hidden."
"This Black IPA is very smooth and balanced.. Almost to a fault. I just got done drinking a 'Black Rajah' and while that had a much lower ABV It had a much higher 'Hop Profile' this is a much smoother well rounded IPA."

""
""

""
""
"O- There is a great Black IPA in my glass, but it is overwhelmed by far too much bitterness to elevate it to that level.  You get touches of all the great flavors you want in a Black IPA in this beer,  but the bitterness obstructs it a little too much."
"I like dry IPAs, but this was arid. If I wasn't such a fan of hoppy, dry beers, this could be a disaster. I liked it but wasn't in love with it. A bit of chewiness and malt would help this tremendously. The alcohol is well hidden, so I could drink a lot of them: I just don't think I would."

"Of all the black IPAs I've had, this stands squarely among the best of the best. Wow. Leave it to Founders to make short work of even the most troublesome styles."
"The beer taste while maintaining the same notes is a bit stronger in the hops department. The beer is most certainly hoppy and citrus but the roast does dial it back a little bit and adds a stronger chocolaty flavor with a slightly roasted aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy bodied with biting carbonation. Overall, a fantastic American Black Ale and most certainly worth getting."

"Pours a solid black color with a quickly fleeting tan head that leaves some stickies on the way down. Dank resinous pine with a hint of citrus, caramel and bitter chocolate bring up the maltiness. Hides the alcohol quite well. Very nice black IPA."

"Overall a decent but a bit one dimensional and centennial is not my favorite strand of hops. If you love Black IPA's check it out but not one I'd seek out too often."

"Founders Dark Penance is an opaque, midnight black with a thin white cap atop this mighty looking brew! The aroma of citrusy hops is so fresh and bright, one might think some sort of witchcraft was involved in it's creation. Now, as for the flavor, the hops come through with more of a 'resinous' piny taste, finishing very dry and coarsely bitter, just as a devoted hop-head would desire. There's a touch of molasses, but not much roasted malt... In the case of this Black IPA, the malts sort of give the beer a backbone and they add mostly to full out the body and mouth feel. Overall, not what I typically expect to find in a Black IPA, but that's not a bad thing at all."
""
""
"Reddish brown body with a small head atop.  The look was closer to a darker barleywine than a stout.  The aroma was a lovely mix of citrus from the hops, a hefty dose of pine, and then some cherry from the dark malt.  The taste was very dry from the bitter hops, which tasted like pine and grapefruit, with some astringency from the roasted malt.  There was a hint of toffee and vanilla in the finish.  The body was quite thick for the style, and mouthfeel full of burnt malt astringency but with a soft texture.  This was much more of a sipper than most DIPA beers."
"like the most bitter-dark chocolate i've ever tasted. they nailed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was really damn fresh (2 weeks in the bottle)... poured into the Spiegelau glass. Deep, dark. Showed a hint of ruby when held in the light. Very little head. Aromas were juicy, with citrus, some mango, clean and bitter notes, probably the best smelling BIPA I have seen (and right up there with some of the best smelling IPA/DIPAs for me). Nice bitterness up front. The juicy nose was alive on the tongue... maybe needed a bit more of the malt presence (but overall good balance). Great IPA mouthfeel, a little heavier, but not syrupy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good representation for the style. The alcohol is well hidden and the feel of this one is perfectly smooth while yet retaining the bitterness of the hops. Really another great brew from my favorite overall brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is lights out black IPA. It's why lighter in the roast than others, getting its dark died not so much from roasted barley, but from a dark wheat malt, less intense darkness, and nowhere near the bitterness double jeopardy that sometimes results. It still feels delicate despite being enormous, well bubbly and not real thick or heavy in body or texture. The hops are very obviously centennial focused, which works great with the grain, super hoppy this one, but not overdone. The alcohol is invisible in the drinking experience until the buzz is considered, which is substantial even after just a bit of this. Heady hops here. Super dank and jazzy, long finishing. One of the better black IPA types going right now, just lovely from the tap. A hint of pepper in the finish with the hops, so dynamic and well made."

"To my tastes, this is bracingly bitter to the point of being overwhelming.  I love hop flavor and this has tons of it, but the bitterness is just to much.  Finishing one bottle is a struggle.  If you really love bitter hop bomb black IPA's you'll enjoy this."
""
""
"Solid black ale, but missing a little something... a tad too much pine, needs some more ""black"" characteristics; toffee, cocoa, maybe even some oat or sweetness would be appreciated to balance this out."

"A fingers worth of ultra rich, ultra dense and ultra creamy light khaki colored froth...  At first glance this one appears mostly still, but under closer examination this one is bursting with quick carbonation throughout...  The color walks a fine line between dark brown and black...  It is also fairly translucent, especially when back lit...  A good bit of froth clings to the sides of the glass...  A fairly subdued but pleasant aroma of lightly roasted malt and faint piney hop resins...  The aroma is a perfect predictor of the palate...  The lightly roasted malt and piney hop presence compete for prominence and partake in an enjoyable dance...  The mouthfeel is utterly exquisite and outstanding...  Medium bodied...  Insanely rich...  Insanely smooth...  A bit chewy...  Lit carbonation...  This one is a world class American Black Ale...  It hides its 8.9% ABV...  When Founders decided to add a Black IPA to their year-round line-up, you would expect it to be excellent, but this one exceeds those lofty expectations..."

"This has a more lemony, citrus tone; sweet and sour fruits with an orchard like flavor. The hops continue in a grapefruit rind, pine resin, floral and herbaceous tone. The backdrop is a light charred malt but the hop profile is more dominant. This has a dry yet bitter finish but drinks with ease and heft. This isn't Wookey Jack but it's a good rendition of the style."
"O- Just another really good beer from Founders, absolutely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: It really isn't a beer that really elevates or showcases hop flavor with dark roasted malts. It just gives you a bitter dark beer without a lot of flavor components or complexity. Pretty average fare, take it or leave it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very bitter for the style and abv.  While this is primarily an IPA, the malts do push this toward Imperial Red and Black territory."
"Overall: A very well done black IPA from the look of it I didn't see that big smack of hops coming but it delivers on the IPA front. The body is a bit boozy compared to other bigger ipas but it balances with the bitter and Roasty notes. It's pretty  bitter but not overly so. A solid representation of the style and a beer Id pick up in the season"

"O - Black IPAs are a hard sell for me, and I tend not to try them unless they're from a brewery that a trust to always pull through. Founders is one of those breweries. With as many flavors at play here, they're walking a veritable tightrope. The Dark Penance never feels cobbled together, but somehow feels as though heavy citrus hops and dark bitter malts were meant to be together - something that I rarely feel with other beers in the style. It paired beautifully some musky blue stilton cheese and made a perfect nightcap. Bravo!"

"O - It is a good beer. It leans too much towards the citrus for my liking in this style. I prefer a balance of roasted malt and bitter hops more like a hoppy porter or stout. The bitterness overwhelms the roasted malt creating a grapefruit dominant flavor profile. I love the fell of this beer."

"Overall, my impression was of a tropical blackberry hop profile in a charred stout that feels more toward a DIPA. Different to me, and it's hard not to get a muddled impression. I don't usually go for black ales unless they're Imperial Stouts, but I can tell this is well-crafted for what it's set to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most bitter beers I can think of.  I'm a hophead, but IMO the bitterness is overwhelming coming from two different directions.  Roasted malt bitterness and obviously hop.  Up front is citrusy/light tropical hops, then it's all over.  The roasted malt takes over with bitter chocolate and bitter coffee.  Then a long dry hop bitter finish.  Did I say bitter yet?  This beer is well made for the style, but I'd back off the IBU's a touch, and let some of the other players get in the game..."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic looking fellow here.  Dismal darkness that swallows light and class, only to give up all that bad ass with a whimsical little beige lacy top piece. Dark, fancy and fun all at once. Little bit of earthiness in an otherwise sharp nose of hop dances. Bitter as all hell at first, well throughout actually. A little citrus at first, touch of old fashioned licorice on the finish and finally a velvety sheet on the tongue.  Dsrn fun this fellow."
""
"O - a new set in stone seasonal from Founders? I sure hope so. This is an amazing black ale and an instant favorite in the style for me. It has the class of a great brewery and the depth of an always growing style. I say, bring on some Dark Penance every Fall!! It's grand stuff."

""
"Overall - I like this beer, but was still disappointed. Maybe Founder's reputation came into play a little, but I try to call 'em as I taste 'em. I was expecting a Lagunitas Nighttime. This one is just too unbalanced for me. I feel that a black IPA should have distinct, noticeable porter qualities. Maybe I am wrong. Certainly worthy of the 100 ibu label. If you are looking for something more toward the IPA end of the spectrum, this won't disappoint you."
""

""
"Overall - It's good, but nothing really unique. If I were blindfolded, I wonder if I would pick out that it was a black IPA until the very finish."
"O: a really good beer. im not generally a big black IPA fan, id much rather have a stout or an ipa. but this is good. much more toward the ""IPA"" side than the ""black"" side."

"Hugely impressive but the beer is a real sledgehammer and is just a little bit out of control.  It's a true hop bomb, but I would want some balance on this.  It is though extremely grand, and very fun, but if this was rounded out a bit with some malt depth and character it might very well have been the best Black IPA I have ever had."
"Overall: In all honesty I have been uniformly disappointed by black IPAs. Until now. It's an extremely difficult style to get right, but Founders really hit it out of the park. Phenomenal balance, vibrant hops, and the perfect amount of roasted malt presence."
""
""
"Not one of Founders' better hoppy beers, but it seems to just be my opinion on it, as most people seem to like it so far."
""
""
""
""
"This is a follow-up after Black Rajah. Not an intentional ""tasting"" of styles, but a nice coincidence. Nice profile. Kind of tangy. More so than I would hope for as it robs it of any firm smooth characteristics. It's decent, but not really on the level of others in it's style. An okay black ale that gains nothing being an ""imperial"" version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer that I think is well balanced between the hops and the malts.  Well worth a second purchase."
"This is a nice offering from Founders, although I would not say they really knocked this out of the park. The notion of an imperial black IPA hardly makes sense, as that basically translates to a super-hoppy stout. And that is what this tastes like. Both hops and malts really shine, but overall it still tastes a bit muddled, with a little too much booze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an amazing example of a style that I don't really like.  Even though I won't drink it often, they do actually pull off a style that I think is awful in most of the examples I've had.  Both the hops and the malts contribute notable characteristics, and they all actually do work together.  I think the intense bitterness, as absurd as it is, does help boost the hops above the malts, so at least it serves a purpose."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
"Overall - I don't know black IPAs very well at all, but this is one of the more balanced ones I've had. It tastes like an IPA with a malt body and some subtle chocolate tones, which is pretty much all I want from the style."

"Big oily bitter sharp black ipa. More alcohol burn than sweet for me but has an intense flavor that begs another sip. Wish it had a smoother finish but I guess this is a 9% black ale. You get what you'd expect. Nice sipper for those that like their black ipas big bold and bitter."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good for a black IPA, probably one of the better ones I have had thus far. black IPAs are not usually my thing versus normal IPAs. But, this was pretty good and makes for a pretty good fall feeling brew.  BUT, you definitely need to be able to handle bitter to drink this. If bitter is not your thing, then this is probably not your beer."
""
""
""
"Ontap:  Pours dark brown, almost black.  Opaque in its darkness but free from sediment.  The beer smells like pine and roasted malts, with noticeable strength behind it.  The taste has more of the roasted malts, strong bitter hops, ctirus, and big time fusel alcohol.  Reminds me of a big Baltic porter.  Intense, and if I had this in bottles I would set them down for a while."

"Pours a dark black with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of malt and then a grapefruit scent from the hops. The taste was heavy bitter citrus flavors in the beginning which then led to a semi-sweet finish from the malt. Made for a very refreshing finish and overall taste. Would highly recommend for people who enjoy black ales and IPA's."

"A nice offering by Founders into the realm of black IPAs."

"O) very very good founders has been kicking butt the last few years and this beer is no exception!"

"Bottle. Pours quite dark. Initially didn't think it was going to but once all the liquid settles in the glass, it's hard to find much light entering this beer. Light tan head. Stringy lacing. Aroma is interesting. Huge grapefruit presence. The dark malts are also important. I get subtle whiffs of smoke and anise. Heavily hoppy but still dependent upon its rich dark maltiness. The bitterness crashes upon the tongue. The hops are piney and coercive. They don't have much flavor depth; mostly just pure buttering effect. The sweetness brings forth more complexity. Rock candy, brown sugar, roast. Finishes with some wheat character. This beer is beyond bitter. Aspirin-like bitterness. I can't recall a more bitter beer in recent memory. Body isn't overly heavy; I was expecting more and I am actually happy with its forgiving heftiness. If there is any alcohol in the flavor it's hidden behind he fact that my tongue is absolutely blown out by the bitterness. Well carbonated. Well made, caustic bitterness, has its intricacies. May take a while to get through this 4 pack. The combo of roast and nearly toxic bitterness has me down on this beer. Probably a brew I would have liked more early on in my craft beer voyage."

"Overall – A very delicious and nicely hopped black IPA with a very nice balance between hop, roast, dark flavors, and sweeter tastes.  This is a very enjoyable brew!!  Founders makes yet another fantastic one here."

"the definition of black ale.  black, coca cola in the light.  aroma fresh floral and citrus hops.  taste of orange peel, clementine, a sweetness deep down.  roasty/ashy dry chalky quality.  floral bouquet throughout.  aftertaste of really dark, bitter caocao lingers"

"Overall / Drinkability:  I think the name is very fitting.  You need to be a hop lover for this beer to begin with, and then you will still do some penance for drinking the beer.  It's a strangely pleasurable pain with the hop bitterness.  I like bitterness and it comes through in this beer in spades.  The alcohol is dangerously well hidden; I did not detect it or start to feel it until the end of the 1st glass.  And since I was staying for awhile and having a pizza as well, a second one was a welcome event, even though it dealt out additional penance to my tongue.  A very good beer and I'm glad I had two over a long meal with friends.  Good to look at and strong in flavor.  I've done my penance and don't mind."

"Overall - Hop bomb-black IPA rather than a stoutish-black IPA, I would've liked to see more of a balance personally but it's good as is. Good hop profile and pretty solid all around."
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has a tangy yeast flavor with light pine and citrus hop qualities in the initial taste with a slight malt roastiness slinking in with a semi-sweet coffee-like roast in the middle with a hint of pepper and dry toast in the background as it finishes dry. Overall I loved this it hovers on the line of black ipa with enough dark malt to be enjoyable yet not over the line, could be one of the best in this style in my opinion -great Black IPA in that the hops are the star, wonderful taste"

"O: [3.50] This is a 8.9% beer the alcohol is present.  Overall I felt this was not up to my expectation.  Black IPAs are something I have really been into lately and Founders makes great brews.  This one didn't have the ""spicy"" taste I expect on a Black IPA.  After it warmed the bitterness faded - but so did the chocolate and dark fruits.  I won't buy another - there are Black IPAs that are cheaper and I enjoy much more"

"Pours a beautiful midnight black with a deep purple hue.  Creamy, one finger head which settles to a lingering frothy cap.  Leaves a good layer of lace around the glass after each sip.  Smells fantastic.  Hint of alcohol, a bit of citrus from the hops, and a slight aroma similar to a RIS.  The bitterness is perfect and well balanced by its hop character.  Very pleasant with a slight smokey flavor as it goes down.  This is right up there with Surly Blakkr, which I love.  Seriously considering letting it in my top 10 brews list...  A very good beer.  I recommend trying it for anyone who likes hops, bitterness, stouts, and medium to full-bodied beers.  Founders does a fine job yet again."

"Bottled 9/25.  Solid brew. Pours opaque black with one finger tan head.  Lingers a bit with good lacing.  Smells of citrus, caramel malt and booze.  Mouth feel is good with moderate carbonation.  Taste is initially citrusy grapefruit and booze, quickly replaced by dark malt, sweet caramel and booze.  Smooth finish.  Overall, quite good but would've liked more bitterness.  Good mix of IPA and black malty ale."

"Very dark, nearly black color – some deep red highlights shining through towards the bottom of the glass.  The head is small and sticky, leaving nice clusters of lace on the glass.  Aroma is chocolaty, developing a fruity greenness as it warms.  Instantly chocolaty in the mouth and surprisingly light on the hops.  I was expecting bold, spicy pine and floral/citrus battling it out with the malt, but what I got was lots of cocoa and a mild leafy citrus presence. Every one of the 100 IBU seems to be in full effect however, giving some edge to an otherwise creamy, medium-plus body.  Despite the lack of hops, I actually enjoyed this as more of a bitter chocolaty malty beer.  Easy drinking for its strength too.  I think I’ll need to try one from the bottle to see how it compares."

"Medium to full bodied with modest carbonation. Has a hop forward citrus aftertaste. Well worth trying if you get the chance."
"First sip, I get a gritty, sand like texture. Big malt body. Mildly roasted. Make way for the hop bomb that just exploded in my mouth. Pine, resin, soil, grapefruit and detergent flavors. Bitterness is not only dominating, it's overwhelming. Dense body. Solid bubbles. Ultra dry finish. Not a huge fan of this. Unbalanced and too hop forward, even for the style."
""
"O - This is a damn fine addition to Founder's lineup. Very smooth and drinkable despite the 8.90% ABV."

"I'm always happy to try a new beer from Founders. I picked up a bottle of this one after trying it at my weekly beer tasting. Black IPAs are not my favorite style, and this one lacks the complexity of Stone's SSRA (or that 15th Anniversary beer Stone made that was simply divine - anyone else remember that one?). Nevertheless, I really like the balance between roast and hops that Founders has struck here. It's like the Roast Party holds 58 Senate seats, the Hops Party holds 36, and the Malt Party holds the other 6. However, as we all know, these parties somehow work together just fine."

"after that.  What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile it was nice and it worked really well with this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, it wasn't bad, but I wish those nice roasted malts came through a little more.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I thought Founders did a good job with this style, sometimes Black IPA's can be hit or miss for me but when it comes to Founders they are always a hit.  This wasn't my favorite Founders beer, but it is one of the better Black IPA's I've had.  Good job guys, this was a tasty Black IPA, keep up the good work."

"12 ounce bottle, bottled 9/10/2014.  Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch light tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  The brew smells like roasted malt, pine hops and citrusy hops.  It tastes like citrusy (citrus peel, grapefruit) and pine hops, roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some earthiness.  Nice bitter finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.  It's also easy enough and enjoyable to drink.  Overall I liked this, but for whatever reason I expected it to be better.  Maybe I just expect more out of Founders than I do most other breweries.  And at $13.99 a 4-pack, to me it seems pricey.  Still, it's certainly worth trying if you've never had it before."

"Beer pours a dark black with less than one finger head.  as it settles the head disappears, less for some bubble clumps floating on the top.  The beer settles to a brown and later a reddish brown color.  Lacing is good.  Smell of pine on pine.  Taste:  Some sweet malt and citrusy grapefruit on front, quickly turning to a bitter, overpowering pine explosion that puckers the tongue and top of the mouth.  Too much for my liking.  Found it hard to grade the taste, toying between 3.5 and 3.75, but felt that the nice front end has to be rewarded.  Mouthfeel was not great if you do not like the bitter."
""
"Overall- Nicely balanced despite being very hop forward, intensely bitter. Roasted malts work well with the citrus notes in the hops. In terms of style, one of the better Black IPAs i've had, but not the best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on an Imperial Black ale. Big aggressive floral and citrus hops with enough dark malt to give some nice roasty notes."
"O: A very solid imperial black IPA with a great balance between the hops and malts. Very drinkable for being nearly 9% and 100 IBUs. Definitely worth checking out if you're into the style"
""
"o: A powerful black IPA presenting all of 100 IBUs.  Pleasantly different at first but grates somewhat in the middle to end with unrelenting IBUs.  Pretty much an autumn hophead's dream come true.  I just found it too unpleasantly bitter with not enough redeeming and alcohol-covering flavor."

"Second review, poured into a pint glass: pours so dark brown that it looks black, like a stout with a 2 finger foamy tan head that was full of tiny bubble and faded very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lacing and rings as it went down, plus a nice layer on top. Smell from the glass has more herbal notes like mint and tea leaf mixed with the roasted/burnt malt and rich coffee notes. The charred grains and hoppy sweetness make for a wonderful smelling nose. Tastes great, and certainly not less filling; the chocolate, burnt malt, coffee and smoky bitterness merge and balance quite well with the bitter piney hop and grapefruit flavors. The alcohol is caught up in the cyclone of flavors and has no bearing on the overall appeal of this brew, which has a kick that sneaks up on you. I’ve had several of these over the past 2 weeks and this is another great beer from Founders that I highly recommend. It's another great Black IPA that was released this year and worthy of mention within the class of Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale."

"Taste was dry and bitter and lacked depth of flavor. Basically it was bitter with an alcohol burn."

"O - This is more than just a black IPA (CDA). The alcohol is well hidden and the malt/hops ratio is well balanced. The wheat lends an interesting characteristic that I didn't  quite expect."

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours very dark brown with ruby around the edges when the light shows through, and a one finger creamy light khaki head. Aroma of bitter pine, some grapefruit, almost a spicy rye character. Flavor is very chocolatey and smooth sweetness balanced by a huge hit of bitter pine, super dry, spicy roasty notes. Beautifully silky body, medium plus carbonation, dry finish. This exceeded my expectations. Very nice."

"O: great black ale along the lines of Dark Element, Dubhe, Wookey Jack, 'Self-Righteous, and Dark Horse's Special Reserve - nothing innovative, but everything exceptional. Must try, 'specially for fans of hoppy black ales."
"Poured a rich black body with brown highlights on the edge of the glass and a thin film of tan off-white head. Very nice looking and true to form for a dark ale. Scents of grapefruit, grapefruit peel, orange peel and flesh, and tropical fruit, light notes of pine resin, very light notes of chocolate and roast malt in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice, hop-forward black ale with just enough depth from the malt coming through. Very nice and quite appealing. Flavor begins hoppy, with notes of grapefruit peel and pith, orange zest, light tropical fruit, moderate-light pine resin and hints of roasted malt. Middle opens up to be more bitter with strong notes of grapefruit and pomelo peel and pith, more abundant pine resin and medium levels of roast malt. Finish is dry with strong notes of grapefruit and pomelo peel and pith, pine resin, orange zest and medium-strong levels of roast malt with light alcohol in the background. Aftertaste is roast malt bitter pine resin and grapefruit peel and pith. Overall impression of flavor is of an excellent dark ale that is wonderfully hoppy, but still has a very good roast malt presence. Nice and drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-light carbonation and a resinous feel upfront with a slick finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice dark ale that is true to form, very similar to other hoppy beers. Easy drinking despite the body and quite pleasant. Overall this is a fantastic dark ale. Like many others it leans towards hops, but the overall profile is so well done that it compares quite well to Mountain Standard and Wookey Jack. Highly recommended."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, with mahogany highlights, and a fluffy, light, foamy, light tan colored head that quickly settles out into a filmy surface coating. Aromas of resinous pitch, bitter hops, sweet citrus, wood and pepper spice, and a hint of roast and smoke in the backbone. Very hop heavy nose. Flavors are extremely resinous and heavy grapefruit forward, providing an absolute blast of tart and bitter on the palate. Wow! Solid roast backbone, with some hints of coffee and chocolate, but it's all about the resin, grapefruit, pine, citrus, and bitterness in this one. Hopheads rejoice! The body is soft, mid-range, but supports the palate perfectly. Very bitter, citrus heavy aftertaste, with lingering resinous notes. The finish is smooth, slightly dry, and light, and the drying bitterness lingers on for a bit. This is a beast. A fun hopped exercise for your palate."

"Verdict: I really enjoyed this black IPA from Founders, perhaps a bit straightforward and simple, but balanced really nicely while remaining super bitter and hoppy.

"t/m/o - as advertised, a hopped up black IPA.  The hops are definitely the highlight over the roasted malt, but not as balanced as a wookey jack. Not a huge fan of this style, but this was a good one.  A bit chewy."
""
"O - Founders' Dark Penance has a wonderfully balanced aroma and flavor of dark malt and American piney hops, teetering between the two; it's in the feel where it's imbalance shines. Huge bitterness slays the tongue with gripping and sharp dryness that lingers for some time. Deceptively drinkable considering its hidden alcohol content, this imperial black IPA gets the job done well in every regard."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/10/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, light coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and light-moderate roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a deep walnut brown with a frothy light tannish colored head atop,full on pine and sharp grapefruit in the nose with only minimal ""dark"" attributes,the hops are big!Minimal roast and char wich I like,to many of the style get carried away with it's porter-like flavors than the IPA aspect.There is roast and earthiness but the pine is the biggest flavor component,a smooth medium to fuller feel.This is top notch,Iam not a huge fan of the style but more like this would make me one,a great beer from GR."

"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 09/23/14. Pours a pitch black color with purple hues. No lacing. The aroma is chocolate syrup, citrus hops, and roasted malts.

"Big hop and dark roasted aroma. Plentiful char and lots of hop and roasted bitterness that lasts long into the finish.  A black IPA, which isn't my favorite style but this is well done."
"A good beer for the hop heads, but I would have preferred a lower IBU.  One of the trial versions available in the tap room during the summer was smoother."
"O - A really great take on a black IPA. Definitely the most bitter of the style I've tried, but still manages to balance the roast and hops quite well. A good effort from founders. It reminds me a bit of my favorite black ale; Stone's SSR. I'll have to do a side by side sometime in the near future!"
"Founders really did a fantastic job with Dark Penance. It may not be perfect but it may just set a new standard that I will use in evaluating American black ales henseforth. I'm glad this is year-round because I'll be enjoying this a great deal."
""
""
""
""
"With the long bitterness and roastiness extending long in aftertaste, the ale remains remarkably hoppy and bitter; offering a sane closure of sweetness and creaminess in body. There's moments when a hoppy and full-bodied porter is tasted and felt, however its hop-forward flavor reigns supreme and keeps the beer both American and imperial."
""
""
""
"O- I really think Founders knows how to do dark beers of all styles. This is a welcomed addition to the line up and I prefer this to Double Trouble to be honest. Will definitely be picking up more. I'm interested to find out what this will taste like at 6 to 8 weeks though as dark roasts of any sort tend to overtake hops quickly I have found."
