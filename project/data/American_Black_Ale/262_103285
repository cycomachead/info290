The head is light tan and creamy, leaving stick lacing and holding on well in to the beer. The aroma is lighter with hints of dark sweet fruit and pine. The taste is unique, but hard to describe.  Robust roast malts, light hops, hints of sweetness are all present. The body has a nice silkiness to it with just a little bite from the hops and a light amount of carbonation. A unique brew.","delta490","Sep 01, 2014"

4.02,4.7,4,4.5,3.75,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Very dark, brownish-black with the odd reddish glint, topped by a rich creamy tan head around an inch high. Features a massive hop aroma, mainly canned mandarin with some grapefruit and pine, along with charred grain, chocolate, and raisin. Fantastic aroma that contrasts with the palate, not necessarily in a negative way. This one favors the dark malts, some charred grain as on the nose, dark roast coffee, and dry cacao powder with the citrus and tropical hop flavors in the background. Some dark cherry and peach flavors peeking through. Eventually the malts recede a little and a hop spice supplants to an extent, dried citrus rind and pepper along with something quite floral. Fairly thick but certainly not particularly sweet, moderately carbonated and with a bold, oily, spicy, slightly singed finish that goes for miles. If you focus you can still taste the orchard fruit in there amongst the roasted malts and bitter citrus/pine. More roasted that some of the other black IPAs I've tried of late but the bitter, spicy hops do reveal themselves over the course of a pint, blossoming into something rather intense. As usual, this brewery wins with an amusing name and great look on top of the layers of flavor.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 15, 2014"

4.02,4.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and pretty good example of a Black IPA, it had just about all the aspects that I look for in the style and the balance seemed to be pretty good with neither the hops or malts being too overpowering. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little sticky, slightly crisp, a little rich, slightly filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, but I don't think it would be a chore for me to drink a full bottle by myself and I think this is a nice beer to enjoy on the cooler days of spring. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this is pretty much a text book example of the style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the citrus hop aspect that I got in the aroma didn't stick out more in the taste, I think that held this beer back just a little. I would probably buy another bottle of this, but I don't know if I would get more than that and I would recommend it as good Black IPA. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and it did a good just at satisfying my craving for a good Black IPA. This isn't my favorite Black IPA, but i think it's close to some of the better one I've had and so far it's one of the better beers I have tried from Shmaltz. Good job guys, this was a pretty good Black IPA, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Apr 27, 2014"

4,4.2,4,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, nearly opaque with a one finger tan head with great retention and lacing. Nice aroma of toasted malt, citrus hops, chocolate and coffee, lightly piney and floral; a lot going on there. Flavor begins with medium dark malt, citrus hops, citrus rind and then develops more intense citrus rind and grapefruit hoppiness. Finishes with hoppy bitterness and hints of roasted malt and char and pleasant faint coffee and chocolate. Medium bodied with good carbonation. The flavor does not follow up on the superb aroma that alternately smells like a choclate stout and then a citrus IPA; the flavor leans more towards the IPA side with toasted malt and chocolate and coffee elements as suggestions on the side. The toasty elements are quite good, but I'm left wishing for a bit more robustness. Still a very nicely made and balanced IPA style black ale that could pass for an imperial for the flavor robustness. Contratulations to Shmaltz on their new brewery; I'm happy to drink this to that!","LiquidAmber","Dec 17, 2013"

3.9,1.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours clear nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, tangerine, cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, cocoa, roasted malt, chocolate, toast, light char, floral, grass, pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest/rind, cocoa, roast, chocolate, toast, light char, pine, floral, and grass on the finish for a good bit. Very nice compexity and balance of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately crisp, sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Black IPA style. All around good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Moving on...this is a decent example of a black ale with a good balance between citrus-forward hops and dark, chocolatey malt flavors. I could use more oomph on the nose, and the feel was strange, but the flavor is pretty solid. The hops may have faded a bit in this bottle, but I still detect a decent bit of citrus up front, which provides a nice contrast the cocoa-flavored finish. Not bad.","spoony","Nov 19, 2013"
