3.25,-14.2,,,,,,"Unfortunately, I had this after a 97 BA Imperial Black IPA from Uinta. Maybe that  is just unfair. I mean it is okay, but nothing special.  Flat. No malty sweetness. No Hops to speak of. Minimal head and lacing. Kind of bland. Not saying it is not a drinker. It does go down rather smooth with no noticeable characteristics. That's the problem, it is just too middle of the road, which should appeal to those who like bland beers. Just won't be on my buy list again.","Robert_Ray","Sep 06, 2014"

3.49,-7.9,4,3.75,3.5,3,3.25,"22oz bottle dated Jun 03 13. Served in pint glass. Beer pours actually more brown than black, though totally opaque in the glass, with a medium foamy chestnut head. Aroma is decent, but more big malt brew than IPA, like a brown ale or even a coffee stout. Flavor confirms it: roasty, nutty flavors, with a strong mocha flavor. Like an overly fizzy chocolate stout. Besides the fizziness it has the thinner mouthfeel of an IPA, too. But -- not to say that this brew is too sweet -- I really don't get any particular hop character. To call this an IPA is a sham. Beeradvocate calls it American Black Ale, but this is no CDA either. Still, it's decently enjoyable for what it is, even if it misses the style guidelines.","hreb","Nov 01, 2013"

3.97,4.7,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Well, not quite pitch-black but fairly close. Some ruby highlights, and a tan head that's quite sizable and holds its own. Very nice lacing. Not too much on the nose - some malty pine, woodsy charcoal, a bit of grapefruit. For a black IPA it is very drinkable. More pine and citrus, some smokiness and malt. There's a bit of an oily feel, mild carbonation, heavier than I anticipated. Very reasonable price for a bomber at $4.99, and one I'd gladly get again if for anything to look at the great designs in the lacing: a cat, a whale, three cyclopes dancing arm-in-arm.","kaufmaal","Sep 09, 2013"

Aroma was a roasted grain, with a bit of brown sugar in the back. Bits of lactose alternated with a bitter smell. Flavor was roasted grain with a bit of burnt lactose. As time went on, the burnt got a bit stronger. Felt good in the mouth, coated very well without being overly sticky. Overall not bad, but nothing special.","mountdew1","Feb 04, 2013"

Nice to see a blac IPA that looks more like an IPA as opposed to a stout that happens to be hoppy. The aroma is like chocolate covered hops; rich ganache with a hint of coffee, citrus, honey, and lavender. A touch of dark raisiny fruit is there as well, making this a nice balancing act between the malts and the hops. A nice sprightly carbonation keeps this pretty easy to drink in spite of its rich flavours, as does an overall dryness. The general impression is one of balance; there are some good juicy citric-tropical hop flavours here, but they share the stage with the chocolatey, kind of licoricey flavours of the malts. This isn't a beer that has me totally engrossed in its nuance, but it is a damn tasty sipper and a great example of the style.","soulgrowl","Aug 19, 2012"

Creamy, khaki head with decent lacing overall. The nose was light on hops, mostly pine and lemons, and heavy on the roasted malt. The tast was full of oily hops, very pine driven and low key on the malt; more the opposite of the nose, which was a little off for me.

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Out of a bottle this beer was a nearly opaque, dark brown color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The retention was good and it left lacing in chunks and then, later, bands. The aroma was of toasted and roasted malt, anise, molasses balanced with pine, grass and resiny hops. The flavors were quite enjoyable and appropriate for the style. I tasted all the elements from the aroma with the roasted malt and sweet notes being in harmony with the bitter elements of the piney hops. Well balanced and I really enjoyed the light chocolate and coffee notes that ‘filled out’ and added to the traditional IPA flavor profile. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation soft. A very good example of an American Black Ale/Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale and if you’ve never tried one (though it is a little more pricey) I’d recommend picking up a four-pack.","thekevlarkid","Mar 25, 2012"

The smell of the beer gave off some lively hops on the nose with a bit of roasted malts underneath that. The taste was fairly well balanced I thought between the citrusy hops with the roasted malts. The mouthfeel of the beer was sharp and yet smooth at the same time. Overall I thought that this beer was pretty good and wouldn't mind drinking it again someday.","Knapp85","Mar 12, 2012"

Great creamy head, lacing and dark brown color looks like a stout. Then wait give it a whiff and it's an IPA. A magical IPA! Mellow easy on the nose aromas of hops, nuts, and coffee. The taste is light and complex of hops, coal, metallic and a citrus nut after taste. One of the best and strangest beers I have ever had. Love these outside the box beers.

Tan head on top that fell with a nice lace. Big hop off the top--Cascade hops, from smell and according to the website. Some malt in the nose underneath, but mostly the hop. Not overly complex hop continues in the mouth with a clean, solid bite. Tastes like the hop addition was fairly early--or at least fairly big for the early hops. Nice roast taste without an bitter or coffee taste. Debittered black malt can account for the lack of bite from the malt--lets the hops stand out from the base of the beer. Grass and roast off the back, dry and clean. Not a bad beer, and, depending where I was, would have another if I wasn't distracted by other choices.

Flavors are smooth dark chocolate and roasted coffee, with a dark, wet, resinous hop profile that balances, but doesn't overpower.

Not much of a malt/chocolate smell at all, but I did smell a little bit as it warms up. Taste is just like the nose, with the chocolate malts showing up more on the finish but dominated by the big hop flavor. This is a very hop forward black IPA. If that's how you like them, then this one is a damn good example. Body is on the lighter side, and also more reminiscent of an IPA.

3.53,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pretty standard one finger head, I poured it pretty aggressively, it was fighting me, trying to not give me very much in the way of head. The head is just slightly off white, and is now almost gone, not surprising, considering it didn't give me much head. Decent lacing throughout, the body is black, that's for sure, but pitch black? No. There is clearly hints of red and brown in this beer, even when not directly held up to the light. Overall the beer looks ok-good, I have a problem with the seriously small head retention and the fact that it's not pitch black, but it's got a good look overall, nice lacing, plenty of bubbles still sticking around the rim and middle of the beer. The smell is very nice, it's got a very nice roasty smell to it, nice malt note, and a little hops. I've had an excellent black IPA before (Otter Creeks Alpine Black IPA), and I doubt this will be an excellent black IPA, it smells good and all, and it has all the necessary components for a good black IPA, it just doesn't seem as well balanced as the Otter Creek, and it's probably lacking in hops. We will see, it's a good smell, but comparing it to the other black IPA's I've had, it's only ok-good. Yeah the taste is exactly what I thought it would be, it's a really solid beer, but not as good as the other black IPA's I've had. It's not as smooth as some, and it doesn't have as much flavor. It's got a nice hop and malt flavor, but it's not as bold as it should be, and the taste is a little rough going down, like I said, not as smooth as the Otter Creek. I think the mouthfeel is what's making it not as smooth, too much carbonation. The balance on this beer isn't too bad, it's got a nice hop to malt ratio, which is critical in this style, it's just not enough flavor. If the balance is right it doesn't really matter if there isn't enough flavor. Overall a good beer, just not a great black IPA. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer at all, just not if I was presented with some of the other black IPA's I've had instead.","MaltsOfGlory","May 07, 2011"

That is what you can expect with this beer, and I like it. Some people may be turned off by the malty balance in the finish, so it may be reminiscent of some American Brown Ales in that respect.

The malt is a touch more noticeable in the flavor than it was in the nose; this has a smooth malty finish with some dark grain notes and perhaps even a touch of cocoa. It is interesting how the dark malt plays up the herbal and hop pine flavors (at least compared to a standard IPA). The body has a certain creamy quality to it, but this is definitely a beer with a good quaffability quotient.

After the pour I was excited that I might be drinking something similar to 1554, but upon first taste, you know that within the dark liquid an IPA definitely lies. The hops are in certain balance with the malt which one can only dream tastes delightful. however it was more confusing to my palate than anything. The finish was both clean and dirty. I had this beer last night, and can still not put my finger on whether I liked it or not.","flynnc","Mar 25, 2010"
3.85,1.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown opaque body, one finger off-white head, medium dissipation with some lacing present. The nose is roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, with grassy hops. Taste replicates the nose, but I picked up more roasted malts and esp. chocolate than I did in the bottled version. A bit of bitter hops on the backend, but fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel was full and surprising dry finish.Not a great session beer, a bit heavy to do 3 or 4. I prefer this to the bottled version, FWTW.","jdense","Mar 23, 2010"

I was hoping that you would be able to taste the roasted malts more. Others that I've had only have the cascade hop show up in the finish so that you get a nice coffee malt flavor before the hop kicks in.","Kromes","Mar 20, 2010"

Balance seems good, though, I was expecting a little more of an appearane from the roasted malts. You get a little hint of them in the aroma and with the dry grainy finish, but I wouldn't call them a significant player in this beer. The subtlety is probably a good thing, though, because if they were a lot stronger it would be two strong flavors battling for attention. Good beer, certainly could be a session candidate.","briman","Mar 12, 2010"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pitch black IPA is not pitch black. That's really disappointing. When held up to my 450 Watt Light Source, I can see bloody red streaking. Nice aroma though. Mix of dark malts and resiny hops. Upon tasting I realize at once, this is no Alpha Klaus. But then again, not many reach that standard of Black IPA. This is actually quite good tough. Nice roasted, chocolatey tones. IPA traits are actully fairly muted, but citrusy in nature. Medium bodied and really quite flavorful and drinkable. Give me some roast suckling pig and a pint or two of this and I'm good to go.","Bighuge","Mar 01, 2010"

3.86,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Notes - By far the best beer I've had from Widmer to date. It's the only black IPA I've had, so it's unique as far as I'm concerned. It's somewhat like Arrogant Bastard, but with a more porter-like malt profile. I wouldn't recommend it for a hardcore hophead, it's more for someone who likes balance but wants to get into hoppier beers.","Fnord","Feb 27, 2010"
3.81,0.5,4,3,4,4.5,4,"This beer definitely keeps you guessing and is a very good value. In the end, I would have preferred a more hoppy concentration in a black IPA but I can understand why this would have won a gold medal.","Bfarr","Feb 25, 2010"
3.95,4.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D - Very drinkable IPA. Nothing spectacular, but good nonetheless. The roasted malts add a nice demension of flavor to an otherwise ordinary IPA. The alcohol is hidden, and the abv isn't so high that you can only have one in a night.","Genghis22","Feb 22, 2010"
4.5,18.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ive been really diggin this beer. Black pale ale, hilarious! Pretty much what I would expect. Very hoppy in the nose, with some roast malt character.

4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I would imagine this would be tough to nail as it needs the juicy hoppiness of a west coast IPA without a whole lot of specialty malt influence. It does just that as this is a hop-forward beer with a thin enough body to not jump into the realm of hoppy porter or stout. There is some roasty, toasty malt presence and amazingly does not get in the way of the lupulin. There is also a nice mix of flavoring and bittering hops that are an influence from start to finish. Not the best IPA out there for sure, but it is fun to drink and tastes nice and fresh. I will definitely buy at least one more sixer of this. Good job Widmer brothers!","twiggamortis420","Feb 16, 2010"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This was a pleasant surprise from Widmer. I'm not a big fan of all of the new black (D)IPAs and still found this beer quite enjoyable. There's a healthy if restrained roasted/chocolate malt note. The hops are floral and piney, strong but not harsh. It's quite dry, which is very good for this sub-style. It's a creamy, rich beer that drinks bigger than its abv. I assume this beer is a limited edition, which is really a shame as it's quite good.","popery","Jan 30, 2010"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice smell to it with citrus dominating. Initially I wasn't sold on this but as it warmed over the 15-20 minutes that I drank it, it really grew on me.

4.18,10.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark brown-black color. Good thick coffee colored head. It dissipates quickly, but it leaves a good lace. Smells of floral hops, a bit of citrus. The malt sneaks in a bit on the finish of the smell, with a roasty smell. The taste is where this gets interesting. Starts off with the hoppy bitterness. Floral mostly. A bit of citrus, but not much. Then the malt kicks in with authority. Lots of roasty, toasty goodness. None of the flavors ever become overwhelming, they balance out relatively well. The main detraction from this one is it is a bit thin on the mouthfeel. One would expect a bit of a fuller beer. But its quite drinkable.","patobandito","Jan 26, 2010"

4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"It took me a few bottles into my sixer to come to appreciate this beer, but I'm liking it more and more.

Aroma is mainlly of hops though the malt breadiness is there in the back. Taste well this is somthing quite unique, actually quite stong hopping as expected from a PNW IPA, then the hop biterness is somehow accented by bitter -sweet roasted maltiness with a slight hint of bread. Very nice on the palte thick and intrest holding..very bitter aftertaste lingers for some time. Overall an excellent beer from the brothers.

4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Very solid flavor profile on this Black IPA, with a touch of black patent malts adding some roast and dark chocolate notes. The hops steam-roll in for the finish to add a piny bitterness that smacks with resin and grapefruit peel. Slight warmth from the alcohol, too. Great mouthfeel, with a medium body and a well-designed, low carbonation level that adds just enough bubbliness to liven up the back of the palate. W'10 is one of the better releases from Widmer as of late, and I very much look forward to the rest of my six-pack.","wagenvolks","Jan 06, 2010"
4.23,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,3,4.5,"Overall: An easy drinking IPA that helps define this seemingly new style of IPA. The body is what I find most lacking with this brew, I'd like to see more richness here. It's worthy to a hop lover but don't expect to be bowled over by this one. That being said, the more I drink this beer the more I like it. It's very well rounded and while the mouthfeel isn't the biggest it's an IPA that doesn't disappoint on the hops. If I didn't hate the word ""drinkability"" so much, I'd say this W'10 rates high on that list.","DanOLeary","Jan 02, 2010"
