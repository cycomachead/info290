"TASTE: Smooth, almost silky, creamy, fullish body, dark chocolate, faint burnt sugar, hop bitterness, herbal, vague citrus, hint of alcohol, dank, semidry hoppy finish"

"Beer poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours pitch black with a light brown head that disappears quickly. Smells of coffee and some hops, but weak. Tastes of some flowery hops and coffee, nice combination. Beer is light bodied, nicely carbonated, good finish. Overall, an above average beer."

"O/D - Meh. Plain overall. I wouldn't revisit this. Seemed really tame and not too drinkable b/c it was fairly boring. A fairly uninteresting beer."

"Pours black, true to its name. No light gets through. There's a short lasting head that lasts a bit around the circumference and leaves some lacing. The aroma is rich and intriguing, with both a strong citrus hops aroma and big dark roast malts. The taste matches quite closely. The feel is a little thinner, leaning towards the Schwartz-bier side of the house. All in all, though, this is a great black IPA."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roast earthiness. Very nice complexity of bright hop and roasted malt flavors; with a great hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Quite good for a dark IPA. I'm glad I found this on cask. I'm thinking the cask toned it down. Overall a good drink."

"O: This beer is rather easy to drink—neither the roasted flavors nor the bitterness are overpowering in any ways."
""
""
""

"12oz bottle expiration date 7/13. Pours into a glass, dark black no light getting through. Dark tan frothy head that sticks around a while. Strong hop presence upfront with hints of chocolate on the back end. Some nice lacing left on the glass. An enjoyable brew for sure."

"Overall-I've heard this one is hit or miss and I could see liking this more on a another day, but today it's just not to my liking. All of the flavors are rather light. If it had more if a hop feel I think I would like it a bit more. Even so, its not a total waste of time and I would love to revisit it in the future. 3.25"

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its nose and flavoring. These were both surprisingly robust, zesty, hoppy, and well-balanced, helping to keep things fresh and drinkable. The nose especially held a bright zestiness that really reminded us of Lagunitas Sucks, in the sense that it was fruity, hoppy, and cleanly blended. The grain bill is obviously much darker, but this only contributed to the intrigue and depth of the taste. The feel was creamy and smooth, with soft finish. This brew exhibits the premiere blending of styles into the American Black Ale, and is our favorite to date from the brewery, and perhaps even a rival to the illustrious Sublimely Self-Righteous."

"Overall – A tasty and drinkable brew overall, although it was not really all that hoppy tasting as a IBA would be expected to be. It drinks nice and is rather enjoyable, but don’t expect a hop powerhouse here."

"Overall this beer is very unique. A dark and sweet and smooth IPA...pretty cool. Worth a try if you want a unique taste that is well balanced and not too strong at 7.25%."
"The taste has many of the dark lager characteristics I expect including dark malts and moderate bitterness. Actually fairly easy to drink."

"O - A good beer, but I think the Avery New World Porter is more tasty for this style."

"To the Point: a nice Black IPA; worthy to try"
"Overall: Pretty solid ABA here. I have enjoyed this before and look forward to more in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a good addition to the heavy seas lineup a nice add on to the Loose Cannon. More complex but it retains the drinkability."
""
""
"Overall, a solid, but different black IPA. The chewing tobacco flavor is unique. I like this one, and when I'm in the mood for a black IPA, this is an affordable option."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A big black ale that I wouldn't mind having another bottle of - simple as that. This is not an overly complex beer, but it is one I definitely enjoyed."
""
""
"This tastes more like a stout than Heavy Seas' imperial stout (Peg Leg). It's very, very burnt. So burnt, in fact, that the hoppiness is overshadowed. This is not a terrible thing, but I think this could use some balance. In its present state, this is good, but not fantastic."
"Not as strong an offering as the Loose Cannon, but still an interesting brew, particularly for the nose."
""
""
"Overall- Doesn’t leave much an impression for me. Was hoping for a maltier beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite local beers. It deserves higher praise."
""
"O - Drinkable and something that falls short of the Loose Cannon in almost every category. Lacking the complexity and boldness I enjoy in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh...not one I'd buy again. I guess my standards are just too high for Black IPA's."
""
""
""
"O: This works MUCH better if you go into this expecting a well-hopped stout instead of a proper black ale. When looked at as the former, it's really damn good. I'd buy it again, that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a light tan colored head on top. The lacing is decent as well as the retention. The smell of the beer is hoppy and also gives off some molasses-like aromas. The taste of the beer is kind of bland... there isn't a big hop punch and I think the dark malts mute the ""IPA"" essence that this should have. The mouthfeel is good, it's lighter than expected, not much depth here. Overall this beer is average for the style I feel."

"cheers"
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice offering. It pours up an opaque black, nice medium tan head, good retention, and lots of lacing. Smell is hops, roasted malt, and coffee. Mouthfeel is nice and strong. Taste is maybe some fruit and malt on the front giving way to a assertive, powerful, and pleasing bitterness with a coffee, dark chocolate, hops flavor at the finish. Better enjoyed slowly than guzzled, this is a nice offering which I would drink again!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer, one I like to savor slowly: one of my all-time favorites."
""
""
"This isn't quite in line with what I like in CDAs, but it has some good qualities in terms of roastiness. I'd like more potent hops. Overall, it's not bad, but I'm not going to go looking for it."
""
""
"This is a decent black ipa. A bit too tangy at times. But it pulls some nice hoppy tones on the body I'd expect for the style. Consistent flavor delivery. This is a pretty nice beer. Probably one of the better from this brewery, straight off of memory."
""
""
"This was a pretty decent beer, nothing outstanding but an overall solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color with brownish hues on the edges of the glass. Poured with a thin beige foam that slowly reduced to a soapy cap leaving sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Citrus hop and roasted malt aromas upfront with a hint of pine hops in the back. On the thicker side of medium bodied with a rich smooth feel. Dark roasted malt flavors up front competing with pine hop bitterness. Dark flavors intensify thru the middle introducing a more burnt malt characteristic. Hop flavors allow a flash of citrus hop characteristic toward the end. Finishes with roasted malt and coffee flavors with pine and citrus hop bitterness beneath. I would characterize this as a malt forward black IPA."
""
"Mouthfeel: The is mouthfeel of this beer is just like a IPA but it is hard on the eyes seeing a black beer and your palate is expecting a thick and oily feel to it and it is blasted with a medium bodied beer that flows quite nicely in and around the mouth. This is a great representation of this style of beer even though this tends to be the new and up coming style so many lack the flavor of the dark malts, but this is one that is better than most probably one of the best representations of the style I have drank."
"Drinkability - an excellent brew. Dry hopping would put this over the top. Probably my favorite 'hybrid' style. Good tasty beer for anytime."
""
""
""
"O: Not terrible, but not a dark IPA that should be a go-to. The aroma is quite nice, but it just doesnt follow through."
""
""
"Does not have an average IPA taste. More of a Porter to me. Goes down smooth with not a huge after taste, but definitely coats the tongue. It is a good beer but just not what I expected. I would drink two of these in one sitting and would buy it again. A must try for a beer fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: with the complexity of the flavor and remarkable texture, this is a beer I will definitely have again if given the opportunity."
""
"O- Nothing I would go out of my way for, but in a flight with some other cannons it would make a cool tasting."
""
""
"I still can't understand how these heavy seas beers get ratings above 3. This one was awful. Pours black with small slightly off white head. Smells of stale burnt grain, dirt, muddled mess of roasted grains and sweetness. No hop presence that I can tell. The flavor follows with some roasted grain that is both watery and overly sweet at the same time. There is no trace of hop bite or balance here, and this really comes off as just a heavy muddled mess. Lowish carbonation. Have yet to find anything worth drinking from these guys."
""
"D: This was a nice black IPA, but didn't have the most unique or delicious scent and taste. The body was mediocre, and the finish was a bit harsh. So it wasn't the easiest to drink. Enjoyable brew, but clearly lacked refinement and great appeal."
""
"INTERESTING, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"Overall, this one of the better Black Ales I've had. I wouldn't call it a Black IPA as styled on the label. Nor does it stray into the charred stout territory. Whatever it is, it's tops for drinkability. 12 oz bottle from Food and Friends in Philadelphia."
""
"The feel is nice, a medium body with plenty of crispness to it remains semi-dry all the way."
"Highly approachable, especially if new to Black IPAs."
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty nice beer, more American stout than black IPA. I'll drink more of this."
""
"Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Not the best balance of malts and hops. Definitely leans towards the malty side of things. But not a bad one to try. It's something a little different, if that's what you're looking for."
""
""
"Fuller side of medium bodied, great carbonation with an awesome malt character that holds everything together. Taste is much like the nose with great complexity yet amazing drinkability. Jesus Christ this beer is good. Subtle notes of candy and licorice. Simply put this beer has amazingly blended flavors. Quite a surprise in a world of mediocre black ales. This thing really shines. I love it."
""
""
"Overall, a fairly even balance of malt and hop, perhaps leaning more to the malty side. Good beer, but not a standout."
""
"Pours black with moderate cap of khaki froth, nice streaky lacing. Scent was nearly non existent with hints of orange blossom, lightly citrus and floral, light roast. Taste brings a little more hop character, orange, flowers and grass, dark malts faintly roasted and toasted. Dry on the palate, faintly chalky. In a style with many interpretations, this one is meek and mild."
"3.55/5.00"
"Overall a nice enjoyable balanced beer, a very good black ale."
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer with wonderful smoked flavoring. While the smoked malts seem to be covering up the hops bitter bite, but it still ends with a nice IPA bite. I’d call it more of a smoked ale than an IPA but is fantastic in its uniqueness and full flavored taste. Great beer."
""
""
"O: I think this is your average Black IPA. In the past these beers have stood out because of the hoppy finish, but not really getting that here. The only thing that pushes this beer above average is I think the alcohol is very well managed. The 7.5% indicates there should be some booziness, but there's none -- so Bravo there."
""
""
"O- An great Black IPA, been wanting it for a while, just now found it. Its not the best of the style I have had but its a good one and well represents what a black IPA is."
""
""
"Pretty average mouthfeel. The carbonation level and body are each fine. Overall, this is a weak attempt. A failure, even. Compare this to, say, Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale and the difference will be STARK. Heavy Seas Black Cannon is a beer whose flavor components just don't work together."
""
"Appearance, dark and mysterious, lacing is nice. Smell is hoppy lager. Full bodied, nice hop with a dry finish in taste. The mouthfeel is very dry and swallows nice. Overall this is a good dark IPA. One worth of the fridge. Great with swiss cheese..."
"Overall this brew underwhelms. It does not appear that the mix of malt, chocolate and hops is quite right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very solid brew, clean flavors/tastes with a nice bitterness coming through. Would really like to try this one on tap."
"Enjoyable, flavorful and nicely crafted, but a bit on the underwhelming side"
"D- This beer goes down dangerously well for its 7.25% abv. The balance is a bit more towards the malty side than one might expect from an ""IPA"" but it definitely works. One of the best beers I've ever had from a great brewery."
""
""
"O- A decent B-IPA, good dark chocolate/coffee balance with a citrus hop feel."
""
"Best Black IPA I've had, pretty well balanced although it leans towards the IPA hops. Something I would certainly get again. Tangerine hops are the most stand out part of this brew."
"Pours black with a 1/4 inch brown head and lacing to the end. It's aroma is a curious mix of grapefruit and coffee. The flavor leads with a quick grapefruit tang followed through by coffee and a note of anise. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and full. Clipper City Heavy Seas Black Cannon is and interesting beer. Slightly recommended."
"O- Just like with Dubbel Cannon and Belgian yeast, they took Loose Cannon and instead introduced a high malt bill...I'm down. I especially dig the aroma."
""
""
"This dark, dark beer has a hoppy scent and a generous finger of cafe au lait head that's fairly persistent. Had to look a bit for the smell of the roasted malts, but its in there too. Taste has espresso and chocolate from the roasted malts with some balancing bitter. The mouth feel isn't as heavy as i was expecting, which i actually like. Overall, a very nice, drinkable beer. Didn't think i would like the style, but i do."
"A nice treat and a fair representation of the BIPA family. Definitely enjoyable and worth a try."
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer. The flavor is good but so odd on the palate that it's hard to have more than one. It was worth trying once."
"Black opaque body, one finger off-white head, small bubbles. Nose is more roast than citrus. Taste is opposite the nose, citrus over roast, no resin. Mouthfeel is light for style, medium dry finish. OK but not that great, I guess having drank Barley Brown's Turmoil you can call me jaded."
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of garnet highlights when held to light. Smallish off white head rises and falls quickly leaving a moderate amount of lace. Smells of grapefruit and pine with hints of bread and caramel. Taste follows the aroma fairly well but adds a small bit of chocolate and roasted grain. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Decent beer, quite drinkable if not a little simple."
""
""
""
"Still, it's a good beer."
""
"Overall, not doing it for me for this style, malt angle and sweetness doesn't jive and the hop angle is totaly non existent."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a Magic Hat snifter. Pours pitch black with a nice frothy head. Really nice body and tons of malt up front. Finish is amazing with hoppy notes that linger nicely. Truly a quality beer. Well-balanced and highly recomended. Cheers to the brewery!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good ""Black IPA"" that exemplifies the style well--decent malt flavors and decent hops."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer to keep on hand. Tasty, interesting, and refreshing."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Overall impression: Seems like a hopped up Robust American Porter. I don't know that I taste a lot of ""Loose Cannon"" in here as the brewer suggests. However, this is a very interesting beer that takes the best of a Robust Porter and an American IPA and blends for an enjoyable finished product. Will have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O= not quite. I'll keep trying and revise my review as necessary."
""
""
"A case worthy brew here, perfect balance of roasted dark malts and lots of sticky oily hops. Awesome stuff here."
""
""
""
"O: I like a wee bit more chocolate malt in my American Black Ales, but the roasted barley and charcoal provides a nice enough contrast to the hops that it's a fairly minor quibble. Good stuff, and highly drinkable."
""
"A robust look and easy drinking body were about the highlights here for me, as this came off as overly leafy and spicy feeling and just not as overall flavorful as I was expecting it to be. There is enough potential here to maybe try a bottle yourself though and make up your own mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Having enjoyed Loose Cannon in the past, I was excited to see this beer and give it a try. This beer might be based on the Loose Cannon recipe, but it tastes like a totally different beer to me. I thought it was fairly tasty with its coffee, earthy, and smoky flavors, but I was hoping for a bigger showing of hops in the taste like I detected in the nose. That said, I still enjoyed this beer and wouldn't mind having some more."
""
""
"D- pretty good stuff. i love black ipas to begin with so i could drink it all day. not a personal favorite of mine but would definately buy again."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried it and it makes a solid opening drink before a nice steak at Fleming's. I probably won't revisit it for a while though."
"O: a very balanced ale not quite enough hops to be considered an IPA i think i prefer the standered loose cannon but all in all another solid brew from clipper city"
"o. one of my favorite black IPAs (Note this was the first time I tried it), and I want more! I had it right after a work out at the gym, and it put my in a happy place."
""
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black in color. Off white head. Aroma of citrusy hops, roasted malt, smoke, and a mild fruityness. In the taste, roasted malts with coffee, chocolate and faint anise. Lots of bright hop flavor, grapefruit, pine and rind. Bitterness from the roasted malt and hop is pretty well balanced with some sugary sweetness and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a good Black IPA or American Black Ale or Cascadian Dark Ale, or whatever you want to call it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, rich, opaque sable with a fairly substantial tan head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Strong aroma is quite hoppy and evergreen with an undertone of sour citrus, mainly grapefruit with a touch of tangerine. Hoppy, smoky flavor has grapefruit, tangerine and roast coffee notes - like a good IPA, yet clearly the ""black"" variety. I love this style! Smooth, firm texture has a good fizz and leaves a smoky, hoppy tingle."
""
""
"Pours black with brown highlights and a mocha head that fades quickly. Smell is a nice hop bouquet, malt notes in the background. The taste is hop up front, subtly sweet, with a hoppy and malt finish with some roasted characteristics. A medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation, a bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but a nice depth of flavor. Overall an enjoyable beer, good flavors, worth checking out."
""
"Overall - Because I couldn't tell this beer apart from Loose Cannon, I'm knocking it down a little. I don't really understand making the same beer but different appearance. Anyway, love to drink it."
"O - I really loved the beer, but don't think it was much of a Black IPA. There really aren't many hops and the toasty, smokey flavors remind me more of a smoked porter than a Black IPA. Still, a very good beer that I would get again. I would like to taste this side by side with Heavy Seas Smoke on the Water, which I had about a month ago, for a bit of perspective."
""
""
"Had this on cask at Max's in Baltimore. Have only tried cask beers a few times before, but this was definitely a great beer. Nice jet black color, roasted malt and hoppy aroma. Medium bodied, great mouthfeel, great balance between roasted malts and hoppiness with the smoothness of the cask giving it the perfect touch. Awesome beer, but still not as good as the Siren Noir on cask which was like a liquid Hershey's bar. Totally glad I got try this on cask and I would definitely pick up a sixer of it in the store."
""
""
"I think, more than anything, the Black Cannon has great drinkability. It's a relatively mild example of a black ipa, and that's exactly why I like it. I think this is a great beer to switch some of your friends to craft beer. You know who I mean, those buddies that think they're drinking good beer when they come home with Heini, Amstel, or Corona."

"O: Not the best I've had for this style but I wouldn't refuse it if offered. Besides that orange peel finish, it's not too bad. I should probably have a fresh bottle and revisit the review."
"Similar flavors, mild bitterness, coffee and cocoa, roasted malts, a mellow hoppiness. Enough balance here to keep things interesting, some depth from the earthy roast malt and residual hoppy bitterness. Nothing crazy, just well put together. Going to revisit Heavy Seas after this one..."
"D- Overall, a good example of the BIPA category. It leans towards the malt more than usual, but it works out alright."
"O: Interesting beer; worthwhile drink. Would have again, but probably prefer the original Loose Cannon recipe."
"Overall it was a decent dark IPA but nothing to special"
"Overall a good beer that tastes like a IPA/Stout combo."
"From notes: 12 oz bottle - Pours black with a medium-sized foamy tan head. Aroma has lots of floral hops, smokiness and some caramel malts. The first sip of this brew was much smokier than I was expecting - but I quickly adjusted to it and enjoyed it - also had lots of floral hoppiness and piney resin with some vanilla flavors on the back end. Very well balanced. Finish is slightly sweet and hoppy."
"A pretty decent black IPA. The flavors are nice; however, they are a bit segmented and don't quite meld together."
"I think it is a great beer and would definitely try again."
"Taste is well balanced, like a regular Loose Cannon IPA, with the addition of the roasted malts around the edges. A pleasant combination, and a worthy treat."
"O: Not a great black IPA. 3"
"O: An interesting beer and style. This was my first black ipa and I was impressed. Could have been a little bit more balanced with the malts and hops but overall a decent beer."
"near perfect balance of rich roasted malts, smoked notes, dark earthy, and piney hops. warming only brings the hops to the front even more and allows them to steal the show. quick hitting and bitter as the first sip hits your palate it was amazing how smooth and easy this one went down. nice long finish initially was wrapped in hoppy dryness and twang but melted into molasses and rich caramel malts that left a light sweet flavor"
"Deep black in color, it has rich notes of caramel and citrus fruit such as grapefruit, balanced by roasted malt and hints of piny hops with a smoky backbone. The smokiness of Black Cannon gives this ale more of a Rauchbier or porter character, than that of a black IPA. Nevertheless, Black Cannon is a smooth, full-bodied beer that’s quite enjoyable."
"O - A pretty nice take on the ""Black IPA", but not as hoppy as the best examples I've had (Sublimely Self-Righteous and Event Horizon). Not bad."
"I had this on tap not long ago and really liked it. From the bottle this black IPA shows a pitch black color with a decent light-tan colored head that fades to a more wispy film and lots of lacing. My smeller picks up a mild malty swamp hop. Not real strong but pleasant. The taste buds finds a near stout-like malt with more swampy, herbal hops. It’s got an almost grassy touch in a medium bodied brew with fine carbonation. Plenty drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"Poured it pretty cold so that may have something to do with the extremely thin head. A bit of lacing. Pretty black. A little light coming through at the edges. I'm smelling more dark fruit than anything. Smallest bit of toasted barley in the nose. Maybe a very small hint of hops but I really have to try to find it. Already this reminds me more of a Porter than a Black IPA. The hops are a bit more noticeable in the taste. The malts win out though. I suppose it's a hard balance to find when crafting Black IPAs. Mouthfeel is as expected, right in the middle. Tasty beer overall. ABV is not noticeable. Very drinkable."
"Not a bad brew, tasted with 21st Amendments Black & Tan, not as balanced as that brew, somewhat like on the malts."
"Overall: I would call this more of a porter than a Black IPA I guess that the lines are drawn somewhere and can see this either way. I guess I am not a fan of the style."
"This is a black IPA, or is it a hoppy porter? This one utilizes a little more dark malt than other black IPAs I've had, and hits you with the roasty character earlier in the taste. It pours a surprisely dark color with a tan frothy head that lasted a good amount of time. The aroma is heavy on american hops: citrus, mostly grapefruit, and hints of pine. The mouthfeel is medium to full with medium carbonation. The flavor is hops up front with bitter, roasty malt in the middle and in the finish. Its a nice marriage of hops and dark malt while the beer sits in your mouth but the after taste is all dark malt with bitter coffee coming through. This is a tough style to approach because it is so new so there is nothing to compare it to. I've had a few other examples which were IPAs first with hints of dark malt. This beer pumps up the dark malts and that sets it apart."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly bitter but rounded from the caramel/cocoa notes. I would love to watch them brew this beer just for educational purposes. Sweet, mildly bitter, and ultra smooth. I could easily go through a case in a weekend during a heat spell. Probably a great beer to refresh after the lawnmower duties, or on the golf course too. Interesting, intriguing, and insightful. Well done Ernesto, Hugh, and crew!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer is nice and balanced just like Loose Cannon. I think that Heavy Seas is an underrated brewery. Would definitely drink again."
"Overall, an easy drinker. Hides the abv extremely well."
"One of the better (more drinkable) of the style. No over-hopped, but well balanced. Glad I tried this."
"The taste is closer to a hoppy stout--it's a little more dry than the smell. The dark malts give the brew most of the bitterness. Good hop finish. The swallow is chocolatey. The body is as expected."
"Pours dark black, thick head that stays a while with nice lacing. Hop forward with a malty finish, very balanced and smooth. I thouroughly enjoyed this beer and would love to try it on cask. I had bought a mixed 12 pack and this was the mystery beer thrown in, a real treat."
"Though Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale seems to be the opidome of this style, I'm happy to see an example that's not overwhelmingly aggressive or intense. But the slight lack of malt support and lack of quality finishing hops leaves the beer increasingly lacking further into the finish we go."
"Take an average IPA-- the kind that smells like raw citrus and rope, tastes like grapefruit rind and soap, and has a zippy, dry feel-- and add black food coloring (or make your own); shake thoroughly (careful!) and pour. Voila! Black Cannon. That about says it all."
"Overall a tasty beer, nice hop additions, decent malts, maybe could have been a bit heavier but otherwise good, and heavier is subjective, no briny taste either which often shows up in black ipas."
"O-A nice solid brew that's very unique, I've had a couple black IPAs and this one stacks up well against them."
"Overall I could see buying it again. A nice break from stouts and hoppy IPA's its a great even ground. One of the Best Black IPA's I ever had."
"Really like this beer. It was my first black ipa and I was really impressed. Smooth and black, with a great blend of hops and malt. Being an offshoot of an ipa, the hops still stood out, though. Overall a real joy of a beer. Definitely worth the money."
"This is a very pleasant surprise; one of the best Black IPAs I've had and one of the hoppiest. Lots of juicy citrus flavor. As Black IPAs go this one is not overly roasty at all and it's pretty light bodied. I'm actually surprised they got this to be so nearly black without more black malt and roasted flavor. This is probably one of the most drinkable black IPAs I've had. I wish I'd gotten a 6 pack."
"Very drinkable beer. For sure will I buy this one again. Great job."
"Has a porter malt feel and a lighter end IPA hop profile. They blend pretty well and end up creating a fruity-cocoa feel that drinks easily."
"Coffee black with orange along the edges. Smell is all pine. Tastes roasty and sweet, very sweet and chocolaty. I went into this not sure what to expect as this is my first of this style. Concept reminds me of when Pepsi came out with that clear colored ""Crystal Pepsi"" in the early 90's (it tastes different then your mind thinks it should). I think this would be great for the winter months if you stouted or portered yourself out and were looking for something different. I'll probably try it once more to satisfy my curiosity but probably won't get it again."
"Pours an almost completely black. Small, dark-tan head, but it laces the glass really well! Smell is delicious, floral hops. Wow, this is unlike any beer I have tasted before. Big, juicy and citrusy hops mixing with medium-roasted coffee and dark chocolate. My palette is left scratching its imaginary head. Finishes dry, the two bitternesses sorta contrasting at this point. But ultimately melding into an appreciable taste. Not a sessionable beer, for me, but it's got big potential. Pairing this with food will be a treat if you want the best of both IPA and black ale worlds."
"I've not been the biggest fan of Heavy Seas, but I find myself really liking this one, and am sad I've got but one to drink. Back to the store I go, I guess!"
"0 - I like the Clipper City beers I've had. The first one, Loose Cannon, I discovered in small bottle shop in the middle of nowhere Michigan...and have since made it apoint to pick someup when I get the chance.."
"O - I've been wanting to try this one and I finally had the chance...it was a good Black IPA...there are others out there that I have enjoyed more...this one needs to bring more of the ""black"" components into the flavor...I would go out and have this again though!"
"This beer pours a dark mahogany almost black with tan head and decent retention leaving good lacing. Smell is a bit weak, coffee, roasted malt and very subdued hops. Taste translate the smells pretty well; black coffee, toasted grain, bitter grapefruit hop flavor. Mouthfeel was juicy and dry but a little thin/watery overall. Pretty decent for this budding style but overall this beer leaves a lot to be desired."
"Love the idea of the black IPA, this one is definitely my favorite so far"
"A decent beer to try, not nealy as good as the loose cannon by the same brewery."
"D - It was smooth and good. I could down a few of these easily."
"D - Something in this beer has set off an attack of sneezing! Not sure what! Maybe unknown allergy?"
"Overall this is a great beer that I'd love to try on tap, but for me, Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale and Lonerider's Graveroober are the standard-bearers for this style, both of which are much more aggressively hopped than this one."
"Overall, a good beer from the smell and taste perspective. If they could round it out with a better mouthfeel this could be better."
"A solid, good beer but not the best of the Heavy Seas line. If you haven't tried the predecessor, Loose Cannon, do so -- it is a great interpretation of an American IPA. At the same time, for comparison, this is much more focused and flavorful than ""Back in Black"" by 21st Amendment."
"Appears more brown than black with no head and thin lace that stays with it. Wow, this is a pungent beer. Slight malt but overpowering artificial fruit with a very strong, concentrated rubbing alcohol scent. Mouth is thin but the licorice explodes and leaves the bitter ends of mouth with that hop burn. It's a very fruity licorice flavor, but they seem to always be separate. There is only a slight malt overtone but it hit me as an overpowering glass of underwhelm. I love the Loose Cannon series, but this one misses the mark for me. I would enjoy a black lager or a super IPA, this one seems to mix the two with mixed results."
"Overall - this was the first time I've tried this style and I was very impressed. it was basically two of my favorite styles combined. I'm looking forward to trying this again."
"Well, this tastes and smells like a black IPA, let's unwrap it and find out... Clipped City Black Canyon Black IPA. Yep!"
"This is a very tasty beer. Plenty of roast and a very nice hoppy beer with plenty of depth and character. Delicious and another black ipa that won me over."
"O: A pretty nice black ale, a nice balance of hops and darker, roasted malts combined with a nice mouthfeel."
"Honestly, one of the nicer black ales I've had - nicely balanced, pleasantly sweet but really tempered by the hops, no one aspect overpowers the other. The booze is well-concealed, too. Nothing wowing here, just good."
"O: what a great beer! I can't wait to grab this one up again."
"Smooth and slightly refreshing mouthfeel."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before date Notched at May 2011. Pours a black color with brown hues and very minimal head. Some lacing. Aroma is of citrusy and tropical hops. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is more of piney hops rather than citrus like the aroma lede me to think. A bit chocolatey. Bitter chocolate aftertaste. Overall it was pretty decent and worth another look."
"Some want these things to be hop bombs with black food coloring added or something, I for one am glad they are not."
"Clipper City's Black Cannon, from a 12oz bottle into 16oz standard pint. Pours a very dark ruby with lighter ruby highlights around the edge's. Thin 1/2"" light tan head disappears quickly leaving slight lace. Smells lightly roasted with a bit of cascade dominance. Tastes the same as the nose indicates. Not too much hops present for me for this brew to stand out in the cascadian category, but none the less an excellent beer to have along side venison tenderloin pan seared in garlic butter. I was just hoping that this would have been a bit bigger in the hop department. Cheers!"
"drinkability is solid - this beer is more on the ipa side which is what i want out of this style"
"O: Sure, I could drink a couple of these, but I hope it's only a one time release."
"Pours a four finger khaki head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is grapefruit hops, flavor is same, almost sweet grapefruit hops. Semi-dry finish. Best before Jun 2011. $2.29 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Perhaps the best heavy seas I have had. Quite nice."
"Bit over half a finger of tan foam, the base of denser bubbles undone by larger bubbles which dissolve things down to thin surface coating at best, the lacing sticks around better albeit you will not need to wash it off the glass. Impenetrable black liquid, a deep metallic orange accumulates at the glass bottom for color. The nose is hoppy and herbaceous enough to earn the title of ""IPA," pine and grapefruit to tangerine citrus shine through clearly, mixed flowers as well if to a lower degree, the roast is high-toned and focused, expresses itself as coffee bean and cocoa, nothing soft, as a result its briskness close to its finest attribute. Medium-bodied with good activity in the carbonation, the tingle helps to play up the hoppy bite and grass to lemon, white grapefruit citrus. Much higher roast here with big time coffee, dark chocolate and mocha flavors, nothing shy nor that sweet about it. So, it covers the hops and malts both, if blending them into a flatter whole. The peach, apple fruit shows a more tropical pineapple, nectarine stripe. Too aggressive to put down more than a couple in a row."
"the CPJ"
"HV"
"On tap at the Rattle 'N' Hum. I like black IPAs, this one had an above average mouthfeel, and some orange taste in addition to the cascadian hop that lends itself a grapefruit edge.A little chocolate and roast. A good bitterness.Black colour with some lace dots."
"Very worth trying. Not everyday you get to have a black IPA"
"This was kind of a miss for me. Nothing too bad--I definitely wouldn't turn one down if offered to me--but this really didn't strike me as a Black IPA (as it's supposed to be). I know the category is ""American Black Ale," but I still think of them as black IPAs--this one kind of falls into the ""APA"" equivalent of black IPA--a black american pale ale, if you will. The hops are a bit subdued, as is the nose, and a bit of a more assertive malt presence was noted. Not a better malt presence, just more aggressive--dark, a bit smokey too. Feel was pretty watery--needs a lot more body, in my opinion."
"(fresh date: by May)."
"Drinkability: Overall one of the top 3 black IPA's I've had since they've become a household name. I like that Heavy Sea's made the malt notes stand out more than the actual citrus notes from the hops. Usually with black IPA's all I see is brewers making a regular IPA ""black"" without adding any elements to make it stand out and live up to it's name. Very sessionable at 7.5% ABV and a interesting beer with every new sip. A job well done!"
"D: This is a solid black IPA with a nice dose of chocolate malt to give it a unique side. A really enjoyable beer that I could have several off in a session."
"D: Great great brew, definitely was impressed with this one!"
"Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: All in all, this is an amazingly drinkable beer. Many Black IPAs seem to have some identity issues with whether they should be more like American IPAs or more like ""toasted"" Barleywines. This one finds a nice happy medium in the middle, and I really enjoy the crisp light mouthfeel combined with the very present citrus hops in the nose and on the palate."
"D: Aside from the 7.25% ABV, this is a surprisingly enjoyable beer."
"Inviting aroma of tangerine hops and subtle lightly roasted malt. Rich flavor of dark malts and citrusy hops upfront. Subtle notes of smoke and leather, good balance with hops. Finishes slightly tannic. Tasty beer, but not overly complex."
"D- pretty good stuff. i love black ipas to begin with so i could drink it all day. not a personal favorite of mine but would definately buy again."
"The mouthfeel is great, it's not too thick for a proper hoppy brew, but still has some weight to it. It's also quite creamy. The drinkability is also great, I just want to keep drinking this due to the exceptional flavor profile. This is just a very, very good black IPA (or American Black Ale if I'm going to start being ""proper""), one of the best I've had of the style yet. Doesn't hurt that this is super fresh, of course. And it's available for quite a good price for a style that still seems to command a price premium. Needless to say, I'll be going back for a six-pack of this awesome brew. Drink it."
"A wonderful brew. Well worth the price of admission. I would buy it again, and recommend it. Almost, but not quite as good as Founder Black Rye-PA, which is VERY similar. Delicious!"
"Poured into a standard pint glass a dark cola color with a creamy tannish colored head,it lasted well with a nice ring to it.Fruit and spicy/piney hops really stand out most,there is a hint of chocolate malt as well.A full creamy feel its almost lush,very nice.A well rounded mix of resiny hop,dark bread,and chocolate going on in the palate,the hops hit pretty hard but level out.A real nice ABA,better than most I have had to date,well done."
"D- Was pretty surprised by this one. I really enjoyed this one and will have this one again for sure."
"Taste-Citrussy hop character, roasted malt, chocolate. Lingering hop bitterness nicely balanced by roasty, chocolate flavors mingled well. Very tasty and guplably good for the strength! Would pair very nicely with grilled meats or smothered burritos."
"The drinkability is good. This is a tasty beer but it would thrive on a bit more roasty black patent and chocolate malt tones to really bang the hops out and blacken this baby proper like. Beef it. Very nice. Worth a spot in your build your own sixer."
"Well worth it."
"Looks a brown color with an offwhite head on the surface. The smell is of both hops and roast, which I know is the point, but the piny hops mixed with the charish notes is not my kettle of tea. The taste is a combo of chocolate roast and a piny hop bitterness. It's not my favorite mouthfeel, I respect the attempt of it being made. My palate does not accept what has been given to me. This drinks okay, but it's not the kind of beer for me. I respect it but don't like it."
"Clipper City Brewing Co. is one of those hit and miss breweries for me. Black Cannon is in the former category. Overall, I think it's pretty good beer. It definitely has an intense coffee or espresso flavor from the dark malt presence. As a coffee fan, I'm okay with it, but I can easily see where some wouldn't be. It probably wouldn't hurt to tone that down a little and maybe beef up the body a little. It's not bad though. Not at all."
"12 ounce bottle, best before June 2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly. There is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is nice, it smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. The brew tastes like pine and citrusy hops, coffee, roasted malt and some bittersweet chocolate. Great balance between the malt and hops in the flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, I'm glad I picked up a six pack of this today."
"Good lacing and well hidden alcohol."
"D: I like this beer a lot. As an ipa fan I would have liked more bitterness; it feels more like a hoppy brown ale. Still very nice though."
"D:Very easy drinking beer. It would be easy to forget the 7.25 abv on this beer. it is smooth and has a great aftertaste."
"Drinkability (4.5): This is very easy drinking for being over 7%. It is very smooth while having some big flavors that linger. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- My first black ale and I have to say this beer is confused. It's not sure if it wants to be an IPA or a porter. It's still pretty decent though."
"I would definitely try this again, and a little bit cooler as I basically had it at room temp"
"This might disappoint hop heads expecting a super bitter IPA, but I think it's a great blend of two differing styles."
"drinkable - yep."
"An excellent Black IPA, nice balance of hops and malts, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- A decent pint, the alcohol wasn't noticed."
"First off, I love Heavy Seas beer. They have seldom disappointed and I feel this is true of this one as well. I love the toasty malt flavor combined with the hops. It probably won't satisfy a true hop head, but as someone who appreciates most styles...I really like this one. I would say it's a porter with a hop attitude. Or maybe an IPA that loves malt? Either way, it's a good solid beer I could drink quite a few of."
"Everybody is doing the Black IPA, why isn't this listed as a Cascadian Black Ale or a Black IPA? Decent pricing as always with Heavy Seas brews, this one pours beautifully with pitch black dark roasted malts and a thicket of khaki tan head forming large bubbled head clinging sporadically to the sides of my chalice. Aroma has a strong herbal tea/citri component from the hop department that works well amongst the dark roasted barley just hints of dark chocolate and mild coffee amongst the back drop of dark roasts. Flavor isn't as hoppy as the nose would entail, definitely hop flavors citrus/herbal/hints of pine with dark black roasted malt character going on. Finishes with a touch of cocoa and creamed coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is sturdy throughout letting the flavors collide and blend effortlessly. Some of the best versions so far have been the most affordable versions, including this one and the Otter Creek BIPA...hop burps are welcome very nice presence and feel there's reasonable six packs down the street I better go grab one before they sell out of this stuff."
"Nice, jet black color with a tan head on top. Moderate floral and somewhat grapefruit aroma. Solid hop bitterness with a whisper of roasted grains. Lingering, somewhat mild burnt flavor leaves a nice edge to it. Good mouthfeel-I think it could be a tad fuller but it does not detract at all. Nice black ale all in. I like Clipper City and most of what they do-another hit in my book."
"Very tasty beer. Wish this were around all the time."
"Ebony with a thick sand colored head of different sized bubbles that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Dank hops and charred malt in the aroma. Citrusy and piney hops with a touch of charcoal malt flavors. One of the better ""black IPA"" beers I've had. On the leaner side of medium bodied, a little more heft would certainly help. Another decent brew from an under-rated brewery."
"Drinkability: A simple case of charry malts overshadowing the hops keeps this from being anything more than a run-of-the-mill BIPA."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time."
"Black colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is grassy hops.Taste is hops,sugar cane and a touch of coffee.Alcohol is very well hidden.Goes down relatively smooth.Overall a decent beer that is probably worth trying at least trying once.I probably would buy again sometime down the road."
"This one falls squarely into my ""meh"" category of Black IPA's. The hops aren't star, the roast malt is odd, and the aroma is just a ""What hops are these? Okay, I will remember never to use them in homebrew."" moment for me. Overall, this is an interesting beer, but even if my score seems decent, I won't be revisiting it anytime soon."
"Overall, I liked the beer, but from the bottle label notation and other reviews I was expecting more. I love Loose Cannon and get it in these parts a lot, I just wish this one was more like that."
"I suppose I had higher expectation since Loose Cannon is one of my favorite IPAs. Black Cannon is a solid Black IPA but not ahead of the pack. I was hoping for this to be more tropical and hop forward. I feel they focused more on the roasty characteristics. Bottom line is it's a great effort and enjoyable beer that's worth trying."
"Pours a dark brown with red highlights. The head is thick and foamy to start then settles to a thin layer with lots of lace. The smell is of west coast hops and chocolate malt so like an imperial stout but without any bitter roasted character. The taste is of floral hop with a significant citrus note up front. Beyond the hops is just enough malt balance to keep this beer under control. It looks like a brown ale but is all IPA in taste. This beer is an almost unbalanced, IPA in disguise. The taste is clean with a finish of hop bitterness and a touch of malt sweetness but just a touch. Overall I'd say the drinkability is a bit less than good. This beer seems to be mostly chocolate malt with less of the caramel character of a classic IPA. The caramel character, in my opinion, makes a more drinkable beer as this seems to be lacking some of the sweetness required to balance the hops. This was my first Black IPA and I think it has made me interested in finding more of this style."
"D: Not knowing what to expect with this style from this brewer i was pretty pleased. Very drinkable at a nice price point. I bought a case of this among other beer and my guests really enjoyed this as much as i did. At the 7.2% abv. its a beer you could drink for a while and not tire of."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a frothy cola colored head that retains well. The aroma is very green, with big and juicy citrus hops upfront, along with some dark chocolate and coffee notes, a bit of tobacco, some molasses, dark fruits, burnt bread and alcohol...a bit raw but very complex and inviting. The flavor starts off with citrusy and piney hops, along with some chocolate and coffee, molasses and burnt bread, dark fruits, chalk and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is very good for the style. Really tasty example of a black IPA, somewhat balanced and pretty complex...a real winner."
"I'd been hearing about ""black ipas"" for awhile and wanted to see what the hype was about and I found a pack of this while at the liquor store the other night. I saw it described as loose cannon based so I thought since I liked that this would be worth a go. It is interesting. It pours black with a tan head. It smells very simillar to loose cannon. Taste begins the same as loose cannon with alot of hoppyness but then there is this interesting taste I can't quite put my hand on in the finish. This flavor doesn't really help the drinkability any and kind of hurts it a little bit. Not bad but it's not as good as loose cannon because of whatever that little flavor change is."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good, I actually enjoyed it more then I expected I would. Typically I find that too much roasty flavors clash with the hops for me. Judging by the aroma I thought that this was going to fall into this category as well, but I was pretty happy with the way they integrated in the taste. It was definitely smoother then I anticipated and was a pretty good beer overall. A pretty nice twist on Loose Cannon for the winter months."
"The palate opens with quite a bit of leafy bitterness along with orange and floral hop flavor. Again, I don't get much of the malt character, there is no roast at all! There is some caramel, and maybe some chocolate, but I think this captures the style perfectly - it's a gimmick. Black like a stout or porter, hopped like an IPA, and like the best of them, not much malt character. One can argue that there's a touch of malt acridity, but really, with the hop profile here, there's a lot that can be hidden. Hoppier than I remember Loose Cannon being, this finishes dry and resiny with a bitter orange peel character. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this is solid stuff. Close to the base beer, but not quite there."
"Notes: great style that opens up the eyes and the possibilities for food parings."
"Drinkability: I'm not too sure about this one. The hops dominate too much for my taste, there needs to be more roast to balance things out. I don't think I'd have this one again."
"I think this beer kinda represents what's wrong with the CDA/Black IPA style. Too many strong porters with the roast played down and the hops played up. Still good, but not what I had in mind."
"Missed the various releases of this on tap/cask. Was somewhat excited about since I first heard about it. I'm a long time IPA fan and have been making a point to try as many black IPAs as I can find. None have blown me away yet. I drink it and think, ""that's cool they can do that with an IPA"". This is a very nice clean representation of the style, or what we're identifying as a style recently. It doesn't push the envelope too much from that perspective."
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Drinkability is very good...beware the 7.25 abv, it is not noticeable. This is a catch-all style, but if it contains beers like this...it is ok by me."
