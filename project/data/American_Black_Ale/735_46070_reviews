"I thought this ale was a mess. It looked good in the glass and that was about it. Medicinal taste, off-putting.  And I really like black IPAs.  Maybe I got a bad batch."

"Pretty good. Aroma's mainly hop with a hint of malt. Appearance is excellent with a huge, long lasting, tan head, lots of lace, and a clear dark garnet color. Taste is similar to nose, good balance between malt sweet, hop bitter, & carbonic tang. Good body. Finish falls fast at first and then tapers very slow at the last. Fairly drinkable beer; wouldn't mind another."

"Not a full bodied as expected."
"Always if in liquor store, grab this BIPA.  Just wonderful, fruity, caramel, toffee, chocolate, bitter, plenty of carbonation, dark dry finish.  Thumbs up."

"Can into pint at Rocklands. Pours cola dark with tan foam that dissipates quickly. Smells of roasty malts and piney hops. Flavor is bitter, smokey, sweet malty. Thin body, dry finish, porter-esque."

"I really like Hop Crisis and other offerings from 21st Amendment, but this one was underwhelming."

"Love the IPA's from 21st, but didn't care for this one to much."
""
""
"Great dark hue with deep amber tinge and a slick vanishing porter-like head. Cola-ish scent. A bit dull on the way in, but carries nice carbonation across the middle of the tongue, and leaves a malty trail down the back of the pallet as it deposits slight tones of tobacco and vanilla. Not all its hyped to be, but would order one at a bar on a crisp winter evening."

"Wow. This looks like a stout but is all west coast style IPA.  Very piney aroma folllows into the flavor with a medium-strong hippy bitterness that is very refreshing. Pleasantly surprised."
"Its dark...to malty for me ."

""
""
""

"Overall, a pleasant enough ale, with a lot going for it at the start, it finished a little bitter for me, but nothing to bad.   Not my favorite, but a solid decent ale."

"O: A very drinkable and enjoyable black IPA. Not over the top with bitterness or hops, it is extremely well balanced and does a great job getting the most out of both malt and hops. A nice surprise"

"More delicious than I remember. Plenty of juicy, piney hops, but not too bitter. Nice smooth brown/black ale backdrop that's moderately dry and chocolatey with some toffee notes. Not overly roasty like some black IPAs/porters. Malt backbone complements the juicy hops; doesn't clash with them."

"O: [4.25] Normally I rate Appearance, Smell then taste.  But on the first sip I was struck by the velvety mouthfeel.  I really like this beer.  21st Amendment puts everything you need on the can.  Then they put everything I like in the can.  Great Black IPA.  It is not too bitter but still has some hoppiness."
""
""
"Pours a nice deep chocolate-reddish brown letting a little light in barely. Aroma is of pine resin, beautiful. Taste is hops, some citrus and bitterness. I am a hop fan, but this bitterness is kinda weird and slightly metallic. Feels ok"

"I always liked black IPA's, and this one solidified that.  Just a great brew.  Straight outta the can is quite nice.  Good amount of hop flavor (65ibus) but great balance.  This is one of the most drinkable black IPA's you'll find.  Sits light on the stomach, and goes great with chicken and spicy peppers."

"The fear for any brewer with this up-and-coming style to to make an IPA first and allow the dark grain to complement. But most attempts carelessly revert to simply a hoppy porter. Riding that line dangerously close, Back In Black edges out the porter and sides with IPA, but only slightly."
"I really liked this one and this style can be somewhat elusive for me. I usually find that the stout like qualities of the malt clash and are too heavy alongside the citrusy IPA flavors. Not so in this beer. The malt is as light as it could possibly be and still be roasted almost black. Light and drinks lightly I love it!"

"Smells of hops and slight roasted malt. Tastes pretty much like the aroma. A little bit of hops up front with some nice balance from the roasted malt. It is pretty thin and easy drinking. Not real hoppy and not a ton of flavor, but nicely balanced and well done. I would call it a slightly hoppy, light bodied Schwartz. At 6.8%, you could get in trouble with these! Overall, a good beer that I would buy again and would be a nice offering for non IPA people."
""
""
""
"O: I like it for what it is, a very smooth, quaffable brew that is kind of true to the style, which I consider an ANTI IPA style. Like ""hey, we're calling this IPA but really is a hoppy Schwarz"". Regardless I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark clear brown with a light tan head. The head has moderate retention but leaves some soapy lacing on the glass. The aroma is very roasted, much more reminiscent of a schwarzbier, with only a hint of hops. Its a nice aroma, but not very IPA-ish. The taste is equally close to a schwarzbier. Delicious, but not really an IPA. There's a nice feel to the body and it's nice a smooth. If this weren't billed as an IPA, I think it would get a much higher rating. It has a great flavor but it doesn't even closely resemble one."

"O - I don't like this style of beer in most situations, this brew is no exception. I feel that it brings out the least pleasant characteristics of stouts and IPAs without show casing either's redeeming qualities."

"First off, I'm loving this trend of craft beers being available in cans. But as for this Black IPA, it's pretty darn tasty. It's not as bitter or hoppy as other IPA's I have had, but still has good flavor. There's a nice malt and heaviness to the beer without being cloying or filling."

"Can poured to tall glass at Mustard's in Napa Valley. Noticed the beer was canned on May 20, 2013 and I had it March 5, 2014. Nice restaurants really need to start figuring this beer things out, not really acceptable for an IPA, black or not. Anyway, pours dark brown to black with a little purple hue, small off white head. Smells like lemon pinesol and some sweet chocolate in the background. The flavor follows the aroma rather closely, with much more malt sweetness. Chocolate, lemon, pine, old hops I guess. Medium mouthfeel, a bit creamy, with medium level carbonation. Would like to try fresh but as is it wasn't bad. With that said, plenty of better things to reach for."
""
"I had this on tap at Taco Mac, my first offering from these guys. Stronger roasted malt flavor than I'm accustomed to for black IPAs, could've used a bit more hops. Definitely more black than IPA. Deep brownish black color as you'd expect, lighter head than I'd have expected give the flavor. Somewhat flat aroma."
""
""
""
""
"Malty and hoppy, near black body with creamy. silky beige head. Nice dark roast grain flavor comes through to accent the hops, elements of burnt toast, wood. Hops add more bitterness to the roast flavor, but still smooth on the finish. Some lingering bitterness on the palate."
"Good malty and balanced black IPA, probably hoppier than it feels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Back in...not quite black. Dark red highlights around the edges, decent head retention with larger air bubbles suspended. Some roast, some hop citrus in the aroma, but not much else. Kinda generic. The flavor is more lively, but still muddled. Again, the citrus/roast thing with bitterness. The aftertaste is kinda nice..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the best of the style and, given how good the brewery is, a bit of a disappointment for someone like me (who loves the style). Recommended."

"O: This beer has a nice balance between the roasty malts and hoppy flavors as well as well hidden alcohol. Another nice brew from 21st Amendment and available in a can!"
""
"O - Decent Black IPA, could back down from the bitterness and hopefully remove that soapy taste, but I'd have this one again, though there's a plethora of better options."
"Certainly can taste the bittering hops, but has a nice malty taste to it. Almost like a chocolate/coffee taste but not quite there. Very easy to drink and I would recommend it. Smooth"
""
"12 oz can. Pours brown with fluffy, beige, never ending head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, toasted malt and some dark fruit. Body is full and tangy. Taste is of citrusy hops, toffee, coffee, vanilla and dark fruit. Finish is medium and not too hoppy. I was not a fan of the style, but after this brew I might start liking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer. One of my favorite, easily-accessible black IPAs."
""
""
""
"Overall a very good black IPA. Not overly malty, nor sweet. The roasted malt compliments the hops quite well. I'd even say well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had this a few times without reviewing and without any memorable moments, but this time revealed a decent roast & malt-heavy black IPA, if you lean that way. Pleasant drinker for me."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Leaves a decent residue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I never was a fan of black IPA's until this one.... Had almost the body of a porter, and was so drinkable. its just a big malt like coffee bomb and then hops slide by in the end for a mildly bitter and smooth finish. This beer is sessionable to me. Very drinkable. I loved this."

"Back in Black pours a black color with a frothy large and lacing head. There is a tiny metal like aroma. The has a nice burnt like malty backbone, with hints of a floral hop near the end. Body is a bit watery, but flavors are present. Overall a nice mellow and drinkable Black Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. Like I mentioned before I am getting a slightly metallic aftertaste, but otherwise this is a good beer. I think it is a good alternative for a hop head that likes a little more toasted flavor of a dark malty beer for a change. This offers a good in between balance. I would buy it again."
""
""
"O - nice offering. I would not turn one of these down."
""
""
"O - A very enjoyable IPA that is unique. Wonderful flavor. Would say that it could be a little more bitter. Overall its a very smooth beer with a knockout flavor. Would def pick it up again"

"Mouthfeel - carbonation is lasting across the full depth of the tongue. A bit syrupy and fitting for a heavier IPA that makes you want another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not great, but not bad by any means. It's a satisfying beer if you come across some, however there are many other beers I'd rather buy than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Utterly black, this beer is presented in an artistically motifedd black can. The aroma is grainy and a little smokey. Charcoal and a touch of wood and background hops. The taste is dry, with a heavily roasted, and almost char quality. Full in body. Easy to drink and moderately full of flavor. Like a highly hopped dry stout. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a beer that tries to do the impossible. Heavy roast and lotta hop attack. succeeds better than most, and gotta give em credit. Like strong flavors and a strong herbal dry finish? This is your brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very piney with dark roastiness to balance. A creamy mouthfeel gives this beer a nice texture that helps to curb some of the bitterness. Strong flavor with a long finish that leave you feeling quite satisfied. This beer would be great with smoked pork or beef."
""
""
"I'm surprised this rating is so ""low"". Maybe it's because it was my first 21A beer, but I thought it was great. I rarely write full reviews, but I felt compelled to say something. Appearance/aroma/taste were what I have come to expect from a cascadian dark ale. It was a little too ""smooth"" but that's not a bad thing... Notes of pine, oak, and grapefruit all came out in the nose and taste. As its not the best CDA I've ever had, it's far from the worst. Keep up the good work 21A!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Decent stab at the style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice black with lots if brown head that lingers with nice lacing. Smells a bit of burnt chocolate, burnt caramel and hop resin. Taste isn't bad but thin and not too compkex, slightly too malty with a bitterness that hangs around for too long."
""
"This is a uniquely mellow, unexpectedly drinkable black IPA. Balancing the bitter, burnt flavors with bitter, fruity hop flavors is always a challenge. This beer isn't aggressive in either regard, which is not particularly exciting, but it is nicely charming."

"O: A pleasant beer, nothing wrong or great. It has a nice aroma and the flavor is a good combination of some grapefruit hops quickly overshadowed by malt. The finish is bitter and dry like espresso beans. It works well with a beef stock based soup."
""
""
"Verdict: Decent at best. It has all the hallmarks of a good Black IPA, but the balance of flavors really poor and the malt and roast really dominate what could be a nice earthy hop forward beer."
"Definitely not the best example when rated to style, but this is still a good beer with a decent hop profile, despite muted roasted flavors. I do think it's the most balanced and drinkable offering by 21st Amendment that I've had so far, and would definitely have another if offered one. I'm still on the road to finding the ultimate black IPAs, however, so it may be later than sooner."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But to be fair, it has a tasty quality to it, but it's definitely nothing too special."
"O: Not great...I'm a little disappointed. It was canned five months ago, so not at the peak of freshness. Still though - not particularly old, and not particularly good."

"21st Amendment Black Ale is black in color like the name states. The smell is malt and some citrus. A roast malt character smokey and coffee. Then it finishes like an an IPA with a bitter and lingering feel. This is an interesting brew. Its well worth a try."

"another solid offering from 21st Amendment!"

"Dark brown, nearly black pour with a two finger beige head with good retention and great lacing. The nose was a bit subdued for the style. Roasty up front with hints of black licorice, mocha, and soy sauce with a touch of citrus and pine emerging as well as a touch of smoke. The taste is a bit more bold with roasty coffee and chocolate complemented nicely with citrusy, piney hop notes with some cola on the finish. The mouthfeel is a tad bit fizzy and a little thin, but has a nice finish. Overall a solid Black IPA, but not quite up there with Sublimely. Very sessionable though..."
""
""

"Had on tap at Golden West in Baltimore. Appearance was nothing special. Must not have gotten a good pour out of the tap because I had no head at all. Color was a dark dark brown with hints of red around the edges. Slightest touch of caramel colored suds on the top. Looks like a stout but definitely drinks like an IPA. Lots of rich scents on the nose - coffee, buttercream, chocolate, and a touch of smoke. The taste closely mimics the nose - definitely can taste the hops. Not citrusy but robust which gives me the impression that they are extremely well-balanced with the grains. Malty character but not too sweet - toasty and roasty. Dark flavors - bittersweet chocolate and toast with a hint of strong coffee at the finish. Mouthfeel was extremely pleasant. Not too crisp but not as flat as other dark beers can be. Overall an extemely tasty beer. Great take on the black IPA , but this is certainly open to interpretation - some my call it a stout m, some a brown ale. A great beer to kick off a session and enjoy when the weather is turning from cold to colder. Cheers!"

"Pours an opaque, very dark brown with a huge, fluffy dark taupe head. Average head retention. Cola-ruby glints are noted around the bottom edges. Aroma is characterized by chocolate, roasted malt, and cherry. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout style, but they call this a black IPA, in which case it is more true to style. Carbonation is a bit on the low average side. Very mild flavors, given the appearance, of chocolate covered cherries and some coffee acidity late. There's a mild sweetness throughout. Some of its hop character expresses itself about midway. It still drinks a bit more like an English stout. The 65 IBUs likely put it in an IPA category. Otherwise, it should be in an English stout category."

"I'm a pretty big fan of 21st Amendment in general but Back in Black is one of my favorite beers they put out. Black as night is a pretty adept description of the color this beer takes when poured into a glass. The taste is both smoky and bold, and the high ABV will have you feeling these pretty quickly. Highly recommend."
""
""
"O: This just tastes old. The hops have faded, the malt feel a bit plain and the coffee notes are stale."
""
""
""
"Drink- Tasty, but not in the top tier yet of the black IPAs. Glad I got a single can because I dont think I want 6 cans and because I cant get this in So. Cal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is only ok, I can tell mine isn't fresh and I think that may have a lot to do with it"
""
""
"This brew poured with a two finger fluffy tan head. It looks almost exactly like a stout. The body was a dark brown, almost black. As a result, there is no visible carbonation. The head takes awhile to dissipate and leaves significant lacing on the glass. The nose has a hint of smoke or toastiness (maybe a little nuttiness?) and some hops. This is different from a normal IPA. There is definite hoppy bitterness on the taste, but there is almost a roasted nutty taste to it. This isn’t what I expected at all, but then again, I never had a black IPA. The finish lingers with a lot of nuttiness, moreso than the hops. I would have this again, probably after I had another black IPA to compare it to."
"Overall: Personally, I could see this being a good session beer. While dark in nature, it is not heavy whatsoever, and malts/hops accentuate each other very well. Nothing too fancy, but definitely worth a shot!"
""
"O: I was happy to try this as black IPAs seem to be a bit hard to find in my area. This one had a very prominent malt taste to it. Overall, it was good, but average in every aspect. This would be good as a beginners black IPA."
""

"Probably wouldnt chase this one down again."

"O) I would definitely drink this again as it was enjoyable without requiring too much thought and sometimes that's exactly what I want. However it cost ten bucks a six pack, and at that price I want something earth shattering, and that this is not. But if you threw a can at me, I would gratefully drink it."
""
"O: Me likey. Solid & complex without being complicated or straying from the style."

"Back in Black pours a deep brown color with two fingers of mocha head. The aroma is excellent, it's got a big amount of piney hops over roasted malts. The taste follows the nose, striking the formula for a black IPA right on the nose. Piney hops, roasty malts, that's all you need. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is great. It's not particularly jaw-dropping, but a perfectly tasty beer. It gets the balance just right."

"Overall: Without a strong hop profile, this beer doesn't come near what I am looking for in an ABA, particularly since I didn't particularly like the indistinctly flavored malt bill, either"
""

""
"O - Low end of the hop spectrum for the style, but still a great offering."
"O- I like this beer less and less the more I have it."
"Final Thoughts: An upgrade from their IPA, but could use some work in the hop department. Either use some different kinds or tone it down and just make a great Porter. It seemed like every time I took a sip the sweet aroma stopped me from completely enjoying it. It's pretty good, above average."

"Nice mix of bitter and a slightly bread or chocolate taste. It pours dark, but not black, is medium in feel, and leaves a decent, lasting lattice. It tastes like a session beer, but the low alcohol content leads to quicker enjoyment. I like the roasted taste of this one."
"Mouthfeel: Surprisingly soft and IPA like feel really was mind boggling given the texture of the head and very dark appearance. Again, there is nothing about it that makes the feel ""pop," but overall the flow is smooth and almost creamy with an subtle IPA like finish."

"I think the thing that really strikes me on this beer is that there is so much caramel and maltyness to it. If this is a black ale, I would think there would be much more hop presence. There is a spice tone from hops, but I think the issue is that the caramel malt character is equal or greater to it, which doesn't work so well. And that sums it up for the beer: doesn't work so well."
"This beer has a darkly toasted rye bread backbone with grapefruit zest and grassy hops that give way to a dry, bitter finish. I enjoyed the first few sips, but this beer is not very drinkable, nor exceptionally complex. I find the hop flavor here is noticeable but a bit overwhelmed by the tobacco and burnt toast flavors of the malt, and overall it just does not deliver the type of tropical or resinous hoppy aromas that would make it brighter or deeper. I would not buy it again."

"Pours a dark brown with dark amber highlights, generous light tan head, great retention. Generous hopping in the nose, citrus, with resin and pine, with some dark roasted malt in the backseat. Taste follows with malts moving taking a step towards the front seat. Hops are still mainly citrus, resin and pine. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, but nice bitterness. Overall a fine cascadian dark ale, but not my favorite exable of the style."

"O: A malt forward ABA... not exactly what I was expecting but generally I like it. Far from the best of the style in my opinion but I do enjoy it."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it's a decent beer for the style but the darker, roasted malts overshadowed the hops a little too much for me. The flavors are bold, but also pretty good."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 8/15/2011(oh well, lets give it a shot). Pours a clear extremely dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, caramel, roasted malt, toast, pine, herbal, floral, and light chocolate. Aromas are pretty malty sweet smelling, with moderate roast character. Taste of grapefruit, pine, roasted malt, caramel, toast, chocolate, floral, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, roasted malt, toast, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice balance flavors; with a good hop/roasted character balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good black IPA. Nice roasted character to hop balance, and very smooth to drink. No idea what to expect from a fresher can, perhaps better aromas."

"Poured into a Duvel tulip with a nice long-lasting light tan head that leaves a nice pattern on the sides of the glass as it settles out. Very dark damn near black liquid goodness in the glass, fresh hoppy and bitter aromas with subtle roasted malts. Good mouthfeel and wonderful hop bitterness mingles with that roasted malt, giving a touch of bitterness as well. Finishes long and bitter with again that little roasted malt snap. Interesting and quite drinkable twist on 'ye olde I.P.A.'. Not too strong yet makes a nice 'gonna have a few of these'-type beers."
"O - I consider this one ""old reliable"" for the style. Has enough hops to keep me satisfied combined with mellow malt. Makes for a very drinkable, tasty, canned brew."
""
""
""
""

"Very drinkable and also very easy to enjoy with food."
""
""
"Overall: I didn’t like Back in Black and I wouldn’t buy it again. BIPA/CDAs seem like a very “hit or miss” style and, for me, HUB’s Secession or Firestone Walker’s Wookey Jack are significantly better ales."
"Cheers!"
"O: For people who tend not to go for full IPAs, Back in Black offers a good sharp drinking experience with a bit more depth to balance out the bitterness. The roasted malts still make this a powerful beer in terms of flavor, and the extra richness they provide will satisfy those who don’t like drinking a glass of hops. Overall, Back in Black is nothing to write home about, but if you’re new to this hybrid style, this is a very good representative."
"12oz can. Pours a rich deep black with a lasting tan head, good lacing. Aroma and Taste of rich lightly roasted dark malts, yeast, with some floral piney hops bitterness. Palate is a medium to full body with mild carbonation. Finish is sweet roasted dark chocolate malts, some light dark fruity notes ending is a sweet malty floral piney hops flavor. This brew was not overly hopped ( bitter ) but more dark malts. Overall it was a good drinking and tasty brew, enjoyable to drink."
"A high quality black IPA with a smoother, softer overall feel on draft than in the can. Carbonation is rounded off a bit, there’s some stickiness, and the body is very much right down the middle. Black and opaque with a small tan head that settles down slowly, leaving nice lacing. Aroma is lightly roasty but led by grapefruit hop notes. The flavor is a bit more balanced and less aggressively citrusy than I remember the can being. Definite grapefruit hoppiness with some piney notes but there is a higher degree of roastiness here than in many other black IPAs or “Cascadian Ales” or what-have-you. Finishes fairly dry with a bit of lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. If you like this style this is a solid example."

""
""
"Poured out from a can a dark brown beer with a fluffy 2 finger head. Has a light cascade hop smell, some malt is evident. Taste is also fairly subdued, hops are fairly noticeable, some slight roasted notes show themselves towards the end. Mouthfeel is nothing special. Overall a drinkable brew,nothing special."
"For a black hops, this is my fav so far. They call this a hybrid of beers (subtle chocolate, coffee and hops). It's hoppy but a little thicker, deeper, darker and richer than the usual hop beers. Reminds me of a Guinness but you'll be surprised after the hops hit you. 6.8 etoh and 65 IBU's. Good job on diversifying the hop beers, 21st Amend!"
" Original: I liked this better than any of the other Black IPAs I’ve had lately. Very session-able, balanced, roasty and toasty. Med bodied, carmel malty, good hops (but not really IPA level) and a cleanish bitter finish. Check it!"
""

"D - Peculiar. Very malt-forward for the black IPA designation but decent contrasting notes of a more mild, sweeter IPA and a lighter, coffee-highlighted stout. Props for creativity."

"This is a decent beer, but I have had much better that represent this style."
"Overall - Disappointing. Has the look and smell of a top notch Cascadian, but it doesn't pass the taste test. Closer to a ""Black Pale Ale"" than a ""Black IPA"". Thin. Severely lacks in any kind of 'roasted' malt character. Very, very middle of the road with both the hops and malt flavors. It's at least drinkable. Might be an occasional purchase if I'm in the mood for a CDA and there aren't better options, or any options like the last time I bought it, for that matter."

"Just to the right of light, enough carbonation. A little watery, the balanced flavors don't help that. Could be a session ale, but at 6.8? Worth trying though."
"While not a standout it is a solid offering that makes for a good winter IPA."

"Black clean looking with some surface foam, leaving really no lace. Smells of sweet leather, tobacco and some smoky malts. Some sharp hops in there as well. Medium bitterness and good dry malt flavor with nuts and toast. Some slight piny, resiny hops. The body is medium with moderate carb. The finsh is surprisingly wet compared to others in the style I've tried. Decent enough beer, drinkable over and over. Easy to approach."

""
""
""

"Taste has an interesting mix of earthy hops and smoky malts - a good balance, but lacking in anything that really stands out. Medium body is ideal for this beer, nice and smooth without too much lingering aftertaste. Overall a good beer for the style, but maybe lacks something that stands out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Above average Black IPA"
"D ~ Was very very very happy to try this (a want for a long while) but to me it is more of a Hoppy brown ale than a black IPA. The roast just isn't very strong. I'm left wanting more in the end, it's very ho-hum. Thanks for the opportunity Crabbicus!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not what I expected at all. It is much more reminiscent of an English Old Ale (say, Theakston Old Peculiar). Not a bad beer at all, but strays quite far from style. I may give this a second go if I can find a fresher can, but I still prefer the Otter Creek interpretation of the Black IPA."
"The Alstrom Brothers state that ""You know a beer style has made it when it has been canned."" I could not agree more, however don't think that it is a knock. The fact that we can get a quality Black IPA canned is a greajt thing. Back in Black pours opaque and has light malt notes in the nose. Plenty of nice hop flavor throughout each sip. It's very smooth and a dry finish. It is a decent quality canned option."

"Enjoyed from a Dogfish Head snifter with salty snacks. This would be a fine beer for casual conversation as it is much more subdued than other examples of this style."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The feel was just right and the alcohol was fairly well integrated. I am not the biggest fan of the style but this offering was pretty decent. I dont know if I would have liked it any more or less if it was more fresh. As-is I might try it again but it wouldn't be my top pick if I had other choices."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice body, good head, and some decent lacing. Nose is earthy and pungent. Taste follows suit with a grainy, pungent tone. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""

""

"Overall – My first sip made me think cough medicine. The more I drank, the better it gets. The odd thing is that it seems like I get different flavors with each sip. One sip will be overwhelming, and then the next will be relatively soft. Black IPAs are the new vogue beer style, and that is certainly a good thing. The problem for this beer is that there are so many brewers doing it well it is overshadowed by better competitors despite throwing a ton of flavor."
"O - A very good beer, but not amazing like some of the other 21st Amendment brews I have enjoyed."
"Attractive beer...close to black with an inch high pile of dense foamy goodness on top. Looking carefully I see little bits of sediment around the bottom edge of my glass. Good lacing as the head fades too. Aroma is a pleasant mix of dark, caramelly malt and pine/citrus hops. Toasty bread, cocoa, vanilla, and a minty kind of pine. Taste matches rather well, and there's nice play between sweet and bitter. The texture reminds me of melted chocolate. I like the residual bitter hop dryness that lingers after the finish. This is a very likable beer."

"I am somewhat conflicted on this one. The flavor was okay but I expected more. It just didn’t ring out in any way to me. I had no problem drinking it all but when it was over I didn’t have much in the way of strong impressions. What I have to balance that against is the fact that the last black IPA I had was Stone’s 2011 SSR a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed it. I think the fact that SSR really sang made Back in Black’s lack of wow stand out more. I can’t know what my thoughts on Back in Black would be had I not tried SSR beforehand. Since black IPAs are a style where my samples have been pretty limited it’s hard to get around the fact that SSR is a home run and everything else I’ve tried so far just…isn’t. I feel like I should come back to this beer again sometime for another go and see if it strikes me the same way or not."

"D: This was a very nice black IPA, almost bordering porter with more prominent roast character. Still very nice scent and taste, with ok body. Finish was so smooth it was tough not to chug. Not the best of the style, but very enjoyable and session-able."
"O: typically im not big on black IPAs but this one was positively fantastic, so well balanced and just wonderfully drinkable, well done!"
""
"Tasty, but the hops are definitely more powerful than the ""black"". Not particularly complex."
"D- In almost all respects this one just feels like a lazy attempt at an over hopped brown. By no stretch of the imagination would I call this a black IPA as it isn't black, it isn't dry and there's practically no hop flavor. The thick layer of yeast sediment was also offputting in the glass and really uncalled for in a can. It was hard for me to give this brewery another try with how much I hated the watermelon wheat, now I know to stay away for good."

"Yields a big three finger head of deep tan color, quite airy, little dimpling, almost entirely microbubbles, the lacing is noticeably thick and sticks excellently. Not quite fully black liquid, more like brackish, muddy water, lots of brown with some yellow touches, plenty of floaties inside too. The nose has a gentle roast to it, coffee, cocoa, mocha and malted milk balls, brings some raisin to plum fruit too, nice floral dew, macadamia nuts, dried orange peel, requires concentration to register its complexity but it is there for the taking. Medium-bodied, at times a touch too foamy but calms down quickly, this added creamy texture helps reign in the hoppiness albeit it by no stretch gets close to greenness or bitter puckering. More dark chocolate and coffee bean than sweeter caramel or toffee, some milkiness though. The nuttiness higher here, that macadamia plus pecan and Brazil nuts. Conversely the citrus recedes yet you get more pine. Not sweet enough for raisin, stays in the plum, peach, cherry and apple range. Clings to your mouth pores, borderline oily. A very interesting as well as chuggable beer that is not worth getting pedantic about in terms of general categorization."

"Overall: A good Black Ale or IPA, and very good for a canned beer. I would drink this again, especially in a situation that called for canned beer (camping, fishing, etc.). A good beer, and one that has convinced me to try some of the other 21st Amendment canned beers."

""
""
""
"O: Overall the alcohol seems to both contribute some uniqueness while distracts at times. Strong scotch alcohol notes, good level of bitterness and a wet, oily coffee roast backing makes for a good pairing. Big alcohol flavor though may limit drinkability taking a back seat for multiples."

"O- I did enjoy drinking this, it was certainly a nice change and a style I have only had a couple times. I think I have a bit of the problem of expecting an aroma, taste and mouthfeel from what I see, but then getting something completely different. Nice for a bit of a change from the ubiquitous American IPAs I drink too many of these days, I probably will try it again."
""
"Overall: Not nearly as hop-forward as a black ale should be. It seems more like a watered down version of a russian imperial stout. Not a bad brew but not one i would try again."
""
""
""
"If a weird, though well-done, love child between an American IPA and an Imperial Stout sounds interesting to you, give this one a try. Prepare for some stylistic confusion. Overall, though, from what I understand the producer was going for, this is a well-balanced and compelling black IPA."
""
""
"Very dark, opaque brown with a big, fat head of off-white foam that slowly deflates to a lumpy covering. Sticky rings of lace. Bright hoppy aroma over a nutty, cocoa malt base. Sticky pine and fruit with some caramel, sweet coffee, and brown sugar. A bit roastier in the mouth with chocolate malt giving way to a hefty dose of grapefruit and lemon. Medium bodied and dry, yet pretty slick and smooth with a lingering bitterness. This will find its way back to my fridge for sure..."
"O: This is not what I was expecting, not enough hop presence here. I like it, but it doesn't seem to match the style."
""
"- A good dark brew.. but doesn't flirt with the IPA style enough for me. It could almost pass as an American sweet stout. Certainly smooth and balanced, and reassures my opinion of this being my favored beer from the brewer. Worth having a few cans kicking around."

"O: Black IPAs are my favorite beers but this one is not. It is better then an average beer but this beer is not good for an average beer."

"My first taste from this brewery and it's a pretty good taste. Hop character is bright and vibrant at first that finishes in roasted flavor, resinous slow burn. The body feels a little bit thin on the palate but that seems to lend to a higher drinkability factor. Eyes closed I'd mostly think American IPA with roasted malt flavor pulses. When craving hops I might prefer a more traditional IPA but this definitely scratches an itch. I'd get this again."
""
"Jet black pour into a Brooklyn Pils glass with a slight fizzy cap that quickly deteriorates. Sweet malt aroma, a surprise after having read the label ""Black IPA"". Bitter first sip. Not citrusy, not piney, more astringent than anything else. I cannot get a bead on any hop character, just a bitter flavor. The bitterness dissipates and gets overwhelmed by candy sweetness, which is just inconsistent with the style attempt. The fizzy thin mouth feel finishes a pretty unpleasant drinking experience. Good thing that I bought the can as a single. Don't think I'll be going back for this one. I have not had great experience with 21st Amend. but I really enjoyed their Fire Side Chat and Monks Blood. Those two successes will keep me trying their new projects in the future; this effort was simply not their finest effort."

"Basic black with a finger of head that left behind some nice lacing. There is a light roasty nose to this beer. There is a pretty robust blend of malt and hops upfront and a solid hop bite in the finish. This was my first offering from 21st Amendment and I was reasonably impressed."
""

"Twelve ounce can poured into a pint glass. The liquid is chiefly black with slight cola accents around the edges. Thick tan head puffs up before receding to a swirly froth. Aroma is hoppy at first with pineapple at the fore and some grapefruit and leafy notes as well. The smell turns roasty after a few whiffs, with chocolate wafers and a bit of burnt character. Flavor puts this strictly in the 'hoppy dark beer' camp, as opposed to the 'dark hoppy beer' one. Mainly a roasty chocolatey profile with toasted bread, ash, and dark caramel to go with a dusting of citrus hops. Even the bitterness, which is moderate, seems to derive from the dark malts and not from the hops. Overall this is one of the better 'black ipa' type beers I've had. The only faults are that it's a little light in body, leading to a watery, Guinness-like finish."
"O: Have had this a few times now. Haven't cared for it any of the times."

"Medium body with some good smooth carbonation that helps contribute to a creamy mouthfeel. While the flavors are one dimensional, the beer was pretty tasty.

"Overall: This is a solid IPA but it could of tasted more black. Dark malts are too subtle and tend to get lost in the hops. Still a good tasting IPA."
"To go along with some MNF and NBA Jam, my cousin brought over a fantastic beer-in-a-can, Back in Black from 21st Amendment. I love black IPAs for many reasons, and this particular beer is no exception. A quick look and you'll expect a big robust stout, but as soon as you drink it's totally different. This beer has a great sweetness that's cut perfectly with a punch of hops, and it does so in a way where it's not overpowering."
"Pours a dark mahogany with a fluffy khaki cap that rises to fill the glass. Some delicate lacing left behind. The aroma is of pine needles, orange rind and cocoa nibs. The flavor profile follows the nose. Fresh cut pine off the bat before a rush of chocolate and a slight bitter finish. The feel is a little thin and very undercarbonated. This has some good qualities but falls short in some of the finer points. Above average."
"3.5 D: Not bad for the style, but not that great overall."
"An enjoyable beer, but not really an IPA, I hardly taste any hops."
"Pretty straightforward taste: hops linger over a roasted malt backbone. Lags noticeably behind its peers in both execution and complexity. Not a bad beer, but there are many better Black IPAs on the market today."
"Overall: pretty MUCH 21ST amendment needs to tweak this recipe if it's going to served in a can...I am fiending to find this on tap or bottle. The metallic taste is what is the worst just leaves you with an after taste wishing you could taste before you buy."
"Poured from a can , very dark, stout like with a coffee colored head. Smelled strongly of roasted malts, hops scent is present as well. Taste was more hoppy than expected, but a nice balance of the both. Some nice bitterness and a creamy mouthfeel with some bite. Overall, an enjoyable offering."
"Overall, I thought this was a great example of the style. Will definitely buy again."
"Overall I can dig this black IPA. Solid hop profile as expected from an IPA with a supportive malt background."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer is an almost black, muddled, brown color with a huge two inch, foamy, off-white head that is creamy and small bubbled. The head quickly settles into a thin film, and coats the entire glass while you drink. Nose is all cedar and pine, with resinous wet hops aromas and a slight, sweet, molasses background. Flavors are darkly sweet in the background, with the molasses making the foundation of the flavor palate, followed quickly by a grapefruit highlight and some mid-bodied hops spicing. Some light floral notes dance around in the mouth, also. The aftertaste is cloying and hoppy, making an interesting balance. The hops presence provides a good drying end-feel to the beer, making a nice, surprisingly clean finish despite all the resiny flavors and slick, cloying mouthfeel. Decent brew, but I also am a fan of most of 21st beers."
"Interesting, not sure i like the hop combo in this beer, doesn't work with the roast. Great body though."
"M: nice roasted up front but too unbalanced with medicinal hops"
"Pour was deep brown and porter-like, with a moderate mocha head. Up front well-roasted malt notes are prominent, with malt caramelization and some background grain flavor. Hopping is substantial, and moves in quickly with an overall blunt bittering note. Finish picks up some roasted grain sweetness. Not sure what to make of this one, a bit heavy on the roasted malt aspect and not well balanced with the hops."
"Overall, this is good beer in terms of flavor, the hops and malts each bringing a good series of tastes, and all of which meld together fairly well. At times the ash and tobacco flavors can slightly outshine the rest of the beer, and the medium-light mouthfeel is strange, given the potency of the flavors. Still, this is a far better-than-average Black IPA, and worth trying."
"A disappointment if you expecting a dark IPA, but not bad if you think of it as a hoppy porter."
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Overall this is a beer that I could have a few of in one sitting, but nothing that really jumps out at me. I do like it better than the other offerings that I have tried from this brewery."
"Overall: A hoppy drinkable beer. Mouthfeel and appearance is right on but flavor and aroma are lacking. Malt profile is one-dimensional. Higher dry-hopping levels could help aroma. Pitching more yeast and/or reducing fermentation temps could help with the alcohol thing."
"More roasty porter notes in the flavor, a little bit of pine and citrus intertwined in there also. Dry with a moderately bitter finish. Light green hop aftertaste lingers. Pretty easy drinking, not bad."
"I'd say this isn't too bad, especially as compared to the other 12A beers I've had. I'd drink this again in a pinch, I suppose."
"This poured out as a nice black looking brew, the head was tan in color and leaves a little bit of lacing behind. The smell of the beer was hoppy and had plenty of roasted malt aromas in there too. The taste of the beer kinda of fell off the radar for me... The hops that were used or the malts they used seems to be a little on the gross side in my opinion. Whatever it was, I felt like it just wasn't working for me. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good, but still nothing special really. Overall this brew had a good look, but flavor wise it just wasn't for me."
"O- Not too bad but nothing to write home about."
"Got this in a 6pk of 12oz cans poured into my Sam Adams 20oz glass... Pours a decent 1/2 in head great dark black color... Smell is of bitter hops love it... hop bitterness is present followed by roast dark malt flavor exactly what I'm looking for in this style of beer... leaves just a little bitterness on the tongue aftertaste of hops sticks with you which is a plus in my book... mouthfeel is smooth, easily drinkable goes down again and again... I will buy this beer any time I'm looking for a black IPA"
"Indeed, this is good beer when you just want to sit back and relax...."
"Thanks Ben.."
"D: This one goes down very easy considering the ABV."
"This was my first review as well!"
"O: This isn't the best American Black Ale that I've ever had, but it's pretty good. I would encourage anyone who is a fan of the style to pick this up and give it a shot."
"Nice little daily drinker from 21st Amendment. Comes off a little like a baby stout. Not super hopped and syrupy but does have a touch of hop on the nose and mid. Hints of cocoa and black coffee with a little bit of toffee on it as well. Doesn't stick around too long on the finish though. Not an A+ but good for what it is. And the can art is pretty slick as well. As a Black IPA goes, its not the craziest, certainly more subdued than some of the Black IPA's out there but worth the money."
"Pours, well, black, with thick, silky, foamy tan head that sticks around but doesn't lace as well. Resinous hops aroma; earthy pine and floral notes. Some roasted aroma lurks but is well-covered by the hops. The flavor comes on as intensely hoppy quite resinous but lacking in much depth. Some roasted malt adds dark chocolate and coffee notes. Unfortunately, the beer almost completely lacks any body. There seems to not be enough malt there to balance the resinous hops amount."
"O: I enjoy this more than their IPA. I'd probably pick up another sometime."
"O: Interesting, recommended, and more worth your time than the Brew Free or Die IPA. Would drink again."
"A very drinkable, rich, dark beer. Very good take on the style."
"Pours a black body with two fingers of tan, super-sticky, ultra-glass-lacing foam. Aromas are more subdued than those of other Black IPA, and fairly straightforward: I get notes of charred pinewood that full of resin, with a distant hint cocoa nibs. Flavorwise, the char comes out with guns blazing. I was initially taken aback by its intense smokiness. Except for rauchbiers, this is as close as beer gets to tasting like the aftermath of a forest fire. Fortunately there's a lot more happening here. A pine needle bitterness is strong on the mid-palate and chocolaty sweetness comes out on the finish. This is tasty, indeed, but the strength of the charred flavors make me reluctant to follow one with another. I think this would work well with Southern BBQ or as a last beer with a chocolate or chocolate and berry dessert."
"T- This was a mixed bag for me. On one hand I liked that they found a good balance that is otherwise missing from the style. On the other, it just didn't have any body."
"Didn't like it at first but it proved a worthwhile drink. Maybe it's balance is it's strong suit -- I'm too used to drinking aggressive beers..."
"On tap at City Beer in SF. Nearly black in color with a beige head. Aroma is roasted malt and piney hops. A little smokiness that’s reminiscent of bacon even, which sounds a little weird but it works. Same on the flavor, a little citrusy. Mouthfeel is more or less IPA-like, maybe a little drier."
"I'm aware that 21st Amendment have had some issues with their canning facilities in the past - that, to me, seems the only thing that might explain why this beer hasn't a higher rating. I may have been more favorable to other CDAs but I struggle to think of many others that I'd rather have locally available to buy frequently. This is one of my favourite 21A brew."
"D - Very drinkable. Well balanced overall. Could have used just a bit more punch in the flavor somewhere."
"Overall: I drank this beer at boise beer festival and it didn't live up to the other black ipa's there."
"Dark black colour with a decent little tan head. A touch average as an appearance. The aroma is mildly roasted with some acrid malt and some decent hopping. Balanced and dry. A medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation which worked reasonably well with the beer. On the whole, this was a solid Black IPA with a decent hop character and no over the top malt other than a touch of roast. Good."
"This is definitely my least favorite black IPA so far. From some of the other comments, it seems like maybe the can is the problem. Unfortunately, this beer is sold in a can, so that's how I drank it. I've had plenty of good canned beers, so if that's the problem, I suppose the canning of this beer was just not handled properly."
"O - Overall a disappointing beer. The aroma and look were not followed by excellent flavor or mouthfeel. I've been to the brewpub and enjoyed their beers on tap. Too bad this one doesn't fare so well in canning."
"DO DRINK this if it's on tap. One of the best black IPA's I've tried. I don't understand the problems with the cans, led to major disappointment, but I will continue to look for this on tap."
"O - Overall a bit of a letdown after the initial burst of hoppy citrus attacking my nose. Still a solid offering from 21st Amendment though!"
"Dark brown pour from can into pint glass. Two inch creamy tan head with moderate lacing. Roasted malt aroma and hops in surprisingly medium-bodied beer (for its color). I certainly expected it to be heavier and bit on the head fake thrown by its appearance. Ver nice mouthfeel with little if any aftertaste. A clean finish. Moderate carbonation. Overall, a very tasty brew."
"O: Pretty good, but I think there are a few other black ales out there I've enjoyed a touch more. I'm glad I was able to drink one..."
"Prost!!!"
"The beer starts off promising with some roasted malty sweetness and the first kick of oily resigny hops but the malt dies about mid way through and you're left wanting more. The finish is dry and thin. It begins round and balanced but ends acrid with the strong taste of charcoal and soot. Not very pleasant. The mouthfeel isn't remarkable either and falls somewhere between watery and oily. Also I thinks its slightly over-carbonated for the style. Overall not terrible beer but would I buy it again? No."
"Drinkability - a workable aba, I like the can format for this tasty brew. Not the session brew for me, but worth a try."
"D - This beer is great. Light enough in body, not too spicy or bitter to be a single-order beer, but flavorful enough to slow you down and make you appreciate it."
"For some reason I was expecting more from the IPA side of things. Pours a fantastic brown foamy head that dwindled into a nice layer of foam to the bottom of the glass. The taste is like a smoky, chocolate and roasted malt flavor -- like a true porter actually. Where's the hop burst of an IPA? Overall though, not that bad."
"Overall, it could use a punch of bitterness or a touch more malt flavor, a somewhat mild rendition of this style."
"I am really falling in love with the American Black Ale style...and this beer seems to be helping me get there. I have had this beer several times in the past, and never felt that impressed by it. However, recently (maybe they tweaked the recipe), I have been picking up on the bourbon/oak notes and found myself loving this beer and the great complexity complexity it has to offer! It is a bit more malt forward than most Black IPA, but it does it right, so that is all I am concerned with."
"If I'd reviewed this on draft a few months ago, I'd have given it great reviews - probably an 'A'"
"O-this is almost an even mix of IPA and porter, but i find it leans more towards the more bitter porters that i've had.the flavors themselves are of medium quality. this really isn't all that enjoyable."
"O"
"O: Slowly trying Amer. Black Ales and this is a good one. Probably not a beer id want to drink often but is a good change of pace."
"O: It's not a good ipa. I don't know if black ipa's are supposed to have a slight roastiness or not but I so get a little bit of a coffeeish vibe. IDK it's something different just not all that great. Everything seems forced and unbalanced."
"pours nearly black, reasonable off-white head. nose a bit malt-forward, but the hops are at least passable for an IPA. close your eyes and it's a middle-of-the-road IPA. a little more burnt taste/aroma, on par with a middling stout, but nothing too exciting."
"This was a drainpour after it got passed around 4 people."
"O: A great brew from 21st Amendment. Very nice hop character with a wonderful maltyness. This is a beer that will be a regular in my fridge."
"I really enjoyed this as it was my first Black IPA. Very different from any IPA that I have ever had. I would recommend trying this."
"D: a really pleasent black IPA that was really easy to drink and was more on the sweet side but I didn't mind it at all."
"O- Great flavor here but the mouthfeel really brings down the quality here. Still, if you like BLack IPAs this is a pretty cool one."
"6 pack cans from Roth’s Sunnyside Store.S.Salem. $7.99. Very dark mahogany almost black ale with a tremendous frothy billowy tan head. Suprising ly hoppy i dunno why i was but it surprised me more than any other CDA i have had,]floral.citrisy style hops.,slight malty nuttiness in the back. The taste swings back to the malts..were dark coffee, roasted barley malts predeminate..the citric hops come back at the end. I liked the feel of this in the mouth..not thin but substantial while still very quaffable. Overall a good enjoyable beer..cans tilt the balance in its favor."
"Its got a creaminess up front but finished a bit thin and dry. Overall it is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"part of the high rating may be due to my shock at the novelty of an american black ale in a can. B+ may be more apt. it's really roasty for an american black ale, but i'd drink a few. they're very drinkable, and to be able to knock back a 6 pack or something in such a convenient form would be just delightful!"
"O- I liked it. It was a nice twist on an IPA. The color was nice with a good sweetness to go with the hopiness. I would buy it again"
"Overall - A nice change from a ipa or porter. Only drawback is it could use some more hops to break up the bold coffee porter taste. Soild and easy to drink none the less."
"O: It's not that I dislike it just has to much of the toasted (burnt) taste for me. Not something I would buy at the store, would give it another go on draft however."
"Overall: Good for something different in a can, and good overall, but nothing compells me to buy it again. Which isn't a problem because the CANquest seems like a losing battle (a delicious one though!) Not as good as Southern Tier Iniquity or Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale, but those are hard to compete with."
"Pours a deep charcoal color, big poof of lightly khaki head, good retention and tons of sticky lacing. Scent is dominated by the malts - only lightly sweet, decent roast qualities with some char. The hops are quite muted in the nose, i pick up some citrus, but not much. Taste is malt forward, dry roastyness and lacking too much sweetness. The hops have gone missing as only a faint touch of citrus and grass can be found, and only if you think really hard. Maybe its like when you tell a lie so many times you being to believe it... hops are there, right? Medium bodied, quite high in carbonation and dry. Disapointing due to the lack of hop charachter."
" Lots of carbonation which always helps in these situations, now the other side to this was that it was jet black."
"Overall, I wouldn't call this a Black IPA at all. The hops are there with some noticeable bitterness, but piney, citrus hop flavor and aromas that are associated with IPAs are nowhere to be found. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't buy this again."
"Not the most hoppy of the CDAs but rather a beer that tastes a little like the Session Dark Lager but with an ale base rather than a lager. The finish is not harsh but rather nicely melds the hops with the dark malts. Very drinkable though I have had better more complex examples of the style"
"Pours a dark black that has a medium off-white/tan head that diminishes quickly. Scent is slightly hoppy with a lot of roasted aromas. Hints of chocolate and vanilla, as well. Taste is initially roasted chocolate, immediately followed by some hoppiness. Taste is somewhat watered down. Burnt toast flavors finish with bitter dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is not the best example of a Black IPA, but it is still pretty tasty. Could use some more body."
"Pours a deep brown to black color with a one finger tan head that is very dense and had good retention. Smell is of grassy hops ad a touch of chocolate malt. Taste is disappointing, I get a bit of raisin or something in the beginning, and a touch of chocolate malt, but no hop presence. Overall, pretty watery taste. The mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation is lacking. Overall, I've had much better CDAs and I expected a better showing from 21A."
"D - fairly good for a canned /portable beer and that is pretty much the point of the thing."
"O: Think of this as a royal wedding, despite its American roots. You have a tall dark and handsome Baltic Porter, meeting a fresh, albeit bitter young English IPA. They really work well together for me, and I enjoy this brew (in the can and in a glass)."
"O: This was the first of this style that I've reviewed, and the other two of this style that I've ever had, were both over a year ago, so I don't have much to judge it against in that regard. Although I do remember really liking Stone's SSRA. ANYWAY, I liked this beer, but I don't think I'd buy it, it's almost too much of a hybrid for me."
"Cheers!"
"D: Perplexing at first and pleasantly different. The dark sweetness of a porter in the hoppy ale. Worth a try for sure. Only complaint is that I wish there were more hops in the nose."
"its a pretty hoppy beer. guessing blind it seems like about 80 IBUs, the the alcohol is not really apparent at all, you just kind of know that a beer the big has to have a high ABV."
"Food Pairing: Meat, Sausage, Grilled Items, Smoked Items, Medium Cheeses, Ham, Lamb."
"O: No problem here. This is a great beer!"
"Dark brown with frothy off white head that lasts. Roasted malts, earth, hop spice in the nose. Tastes of cocoa, earth, hop spice, roast, slight medicinal, hop bitterness and a echo of citrus. Medium body with medium carbonation. Roast and hop bitterness lasts in the palate. Well balanced between hops and roast.  "
"I would defo do this again. I know I have seen reviews of 21a go one way or the other but I am pretty impressed tbh."
"D - Good Black IPA, nicely balanced"
"Notes: It has been a while since I had this one, and previously it was a fresh tap version where the IPA edge shined the most. Here sometimes roasted notes seem to take over the hop profile even with a passing memory of a dry stout. Still worth the try but not too memorable. While I would not put this one down, having the choice I might go after other more stimulating black IPAs."
"I was not a fan of this one. The first sip I though it was weird, the second I thought it was OK because I liked the smokey character, but after a few more sips I was ready to be finished."
"Overall, interesting brew. Im not sure how to classify it but it was quite a treat."
"Back in Black poured a very dark brown color with the smallest of head. In terms of the smell, I think there are hints of caramel, some bits of citrus, and obviously some chocolate. Can easily taste the dark malts, and obviously there is some bitterness to it. Overall I think the flavor is pretty well balanced. Not the best, but certainly a decent American Black Ale."
"O - The drinkability was alright, seeing as how its goes down quite easily. Overall though, this beer just doesn't stand out amongst other beers of this style that I've had so far. I would drink it again, but I wouldn't pay for it."
"One of the tastiest brews I've had in a while. Smooth, tasty, unique, bitter, sweet. I think I might have found a staple in my beer rotation. Why just the B Rating? I don't know. Maybe I'm bias because I love dark beers and IPA's. Give it a shot despite the B rating, really worth it."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall: This won't be my last one."
"Pours a nice creamy looking head that just fills up the glass perfectly, the head is about a finger and a half in width and it slightly off white. I can already tell it's leaving good lacing, and it seems to be hanging around for quite some time as well. The body is pitch black with hues of brown and perhaps some red, no visibility through this beer at all. Really I'm shocked at how amazing this beer looks, the head is really kicking ass and the body back it up nicely. On the nose this beer is really nice, dark malts and perhaps a coffee smell, then in there somewhere is a nice hop aroma. It's clearly well balanced and well crafted, and maybe even complex. Is it the best smelling black IPA I've ever smelled? No, but it's pretty damn close. Overall I'm really surprised at how good this smells and tastes, I wasn't expecting this at all, lets see how it tastes. For sure not the taste I was hoping for, it's a good beer, and it has nice levels of complexity to it, it's just kinda all over the place and gross in some areas. The one offensive flavor I get it sourness, not a hop sourness or anything, just sour, its weird, and not pleasant, especially in a smoother style like a black IPA. I would actually say that the sourness is the most dominant flavor, then comes a little dark malt, a little coffee, and way too little hops. Everything is there for this beer to be really good, it just doesn't all come together. Overall I would also say that this beer is too light, you really gotta make a hell of a beer to make a good black IPA, and they skimped out on flavor. I mean you can detect all the individual flavors easily, you know they are there, but it's all just a bit watered down. Overall the taste is good, just all over the place and not as big as it should be. As for mouthfeel, the mouthfeel is actually really nice, it's got a nice thick bready feel to it, it kind of just expands in your mouth when your drinking it, the carbonation is also very very good on this beer. As for drinkability, it's good, better than it should be for the style, because it's a little watered down. Overall a great beer in every category other than taste, in taste it's good, and very tasty really, just too chaotic and watery."
"O: This one's OK. Not worth the $12.99 I paid for the sixer, and not one I will get again. For another couple bucks, I could've had my favorite in the style: Victory Yakima Glory. That's a beer that gets the style right. . . ."
"I enjoyed the beer and will have it again (hopefully on tap). I just didn’t think it had enough characteristics to be called a Black IPA. It’s more of a creamy porter to me."
"D: I really didn't love this beer and feel that 21st amendment is slightly more hit or miss on their beers than I would like. I love the can portability and they are covering some cool styles, like with this beer; however, they have a serious execution problem."
"Surprisingly creamy smooth mouthfeel on this black IPA. Not too bitter. Nice roasted malt flavor is not overwhelmed by the hops. So well-balanced hops and malt, which I think is essential for a good black IPA. Easy drinking...I could drink several of these, despite the 6.8abv. Black IPAs seem to be trendy now and this example is a good one. I'll be drinking this long after any trend fades as long as 21st A is willing to brew it!"
"Oh, I forgot to mention that it is very cool looking for whatever it is. And it has a terrific aftertaste. It's different, and well crafted."
"The reviews for 21st Amendment Back in Black seem surprisingly low for what I thought of it. The beer is definitely not black, but a very dark brown. There is fantastic lacing and a head that stays almost full for the entire lifespan of this beer. The nose has a distinctly chocolate graham cracker aroma with a touch of resinous and grapefruit hops. The beer is has a definitely dark chocolate and roasted grain taste, which is a bit more than expect for a beer of this style, which tends to be more restrained in its roasted profile. The beer is slightly sweet with a good bitter kick in the finish. The hops are restrained but in balance with this beer. This is definitely a more malt-forward and chocolately black ale, but still delicious. A different interpretation of the style, more like DFH India Brown Ale than Stone SSR."
"This comes from a can? That's awesome especially when you realize how good this beer is. As it warms the earthy roasted bitterness comes out more and it ends dry as well. Get this if you want a perfect combination of hops and rich stout like malts. My first 21st Amendment beer and definitely not my last by any means."
"One of my first Cascadian dark ales aka American black ales. Great ""new"" style. All the hoppiness of an IPA, but in a beer that could--colorwise--pass off as a porter or schwarzbier. Aroma is full of resinous hops and dark roasty malts. The taste follows the aroma well, with a definite roasty malt base that is dominated by a storm of piney hops. Medium mouthfeel, resinous, strong in flavor, a good introduction to the style."
"Overall: This is a decent black hop IPA. I would buy this one agian, but I enjoyed it more when it was on tap."
"Over all a good beer to try. Right in the middle of hoppiness. It's there but your not chewing your beer, not that it's a bad thing."
"Overall it's a nice beer that I'd like to drink again. It's in cans too, which is a plus."
"Very smooth and medium bodied, but a touch lighter than I expected from the looks of the beer. The flavor has a faint roasted character but it quickly gives way to the earthy, bitter hops that carry the flavor into a semi-dry finish. A decent beer, but not a medal winner."
"To name a beer after a famous ACDC song....it better be awesome! Unfortunately 21st Century Back In Black Black IPA is not....however, it is solid. I just don't think it hit the mark. I use the Stone Self Righteous as my barometer. The B in B from 21st was a very dark ruby amber with a thin white head. The scent was most dissappointing, maybe some subtle malt...but not any hop. The taste follows the smell, subtle roast and malt, a lil hint of hop. I do like how it comes off the pallete clean...not lingering. The beer is easy on the mouth and could drink my weight."
"O-Overall this is decent."
"average: Love trying new brews and bravo for the creative spirit. Won't be going back for seconds."
"O- This is not a bad beer, but nothing really popped for me with this one. I tasted a woodlike or sawdust kind of flavor and aroma that was a little unique and overall it is a solid beer with balance."
"I had the Oscar Blues Ten Fidy from the can, and I am starting to be a believer."
"I bought this 6-pack at Blacklick Liquor in Columbus, OH."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer worth drinking for a long time."
"Pours a semi-opaque dark crimson brown with a 1 inch beige head that lasts. Good distinct rings of lace adorn the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts and floral/citrus hops. There is also a very faint smell of watered down coffee. Taste follows the smell and is of roasted malts, slight coffee, and citrus zest hops. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. The beer is lightly carbonated and goes down smoothly. Overall, a good beer in the black IPA style but nothing mind blowing."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. Overall a pretty good experience. If I was looking to bring canned beer to an event, my 21st Amendment choice would be Bitter American, but I still think this beer is ok."
"D - decent ale. Black IPA, American black ale, whatever you want to call it, it fit its style guidelines and was easy drinking but not something I'd probably seek out again."
"Overall, Back in Black is not the best representation of the style. I wish I hadn't drank Sublimely Self-Righteous prior to trying to drinking Back in Black. There's no comparison between the two."
"Poured into a sampler glass at a beer festival. From notes: Aroma: Very interesting--roasted chocolate and caramel malts, but with floral hops underneath. Lots of things happening in the nose of this one. Appearance: Clear black with a thick tan head that dissipated too quickly. Taste: Medium-heavy sweetness with a light bitterness in the finish. Palate: Medium body, slick texture, average carbonation, with a decent finish. Overall: It's drinkable, and it's not something I'd snub my noise at were it served to me at a party, but I'm not overly blown away by this beer."
"O- Completely surprised in a bad way. It actually got worse as it warmed. A def drain pour. I had really hoped for at least good, but this was unbearable. More like old radiator water then beer. Maybe this had gone bad some how. I would like to give it another try on tap though."
"Overall: A decent beer and worth your time but not something I'd put in my rotation or buy more than a six-pack. I liked the picture of Paul Revere on a Harley but the beer was just average if you ask me. I think that 21st Amendment could have been a little bit bolder in the hops. Rather, Back in Black tastes like a slightly watered down stout. Although, I am in favor in rewriting the history books saying that Paul Revere rode on a Harley instead of a horse."
"D - Not a bad offering, though it may miss the mark for the style by just a bit... A solid offering in a very cool-ly designed can... Overly bland in terms of appearance, smell, and taste... Redeems itself with very solid mouthfeel and overall drinkability..."
"This is not a particularly memorable beer, nor a very good one. Mediocre in just about every regard. Bland on the nose, bland on the palate. Only plus is that it comes in a can."
"O: I'm no big fan of 'Black Ales' [see previous], but I try to never let that bias enter into my reviews. I've had some of the style that I thought were pretty good, and this is among them. Not too burnt/roasted, nor too bitter/hoppy - both of which are reasons to NOT dismiss this entirely. Alcohol level seems pretty well enveloped, which helps overall likability."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, resulting in a large amount of slowly fading creamy tan head. I had to pause my pour in order for it to settle. This beer is a deep mohogany/black brew. Decent lacing. Aroma is light on the hops, slightly peppery. Somehow there seems to be a slight scent of citrus. Tastes malty, slightly spicy, lightly hoppy. Hints of caramel are detected. There is a slight metallic taste. Mouthfeel is of a medium body. This is not a great black IPA, but pretty decent."
"O (D) - not that great, but still very enjoyable."
"D - it is a pretty nice beer overall, right the aroma seems a but off. I get some strange fruit amf spice notes in the aroma that just seem out of place. This throws off the flavor at first as well, but it recovers in the middle and develops into a nice example of the style. Definitely a drinkable beer, this seems like one of the ones that is a but better when you don't think about it too much."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a good beer but not an excellent beer. There is a lot of room for improvement from this beer. I hope the brewery will pay more attention to the hops and the aroma of the beer."
"when i think BLACK IPA -- i think an IPA that is richer in mouthfeel with more malt presence and earthiness. maybe... a black lager with extra hop bite. regardless, this was disappointing."
"Pours a black cola like color with a tan two finger head which gives way to some okay lace. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate with a very faint whiff of hops. The taste is of a coffee and chocolate malt, there is a very slight earthy hop bite which is only at the very end. The mouthfeel is creamy and moderately carbonated. The drinkability is okay the taste and aroma is a little flat and leaves you wanting more flavor."
"It is my firm belief that packaging beer in a can protects its flavor better than a bottle. That being said, this is a great example of a black IPA. The smell is of coffee and caramel. It is an extremely drinkable beer that doesn't overload you with hops."
"A decent brew,but nothing I would purchase again."
"O- Overall this beer drinks well. I was more than happy with it. The alcohol after a little while might take a zapping out of my palate so I would take it easy on this. Flavors seemed to be balanced overall more so than other Black IPA's I have had."
"Nice black color with some faint brown hues around the edge. Big frothy root beer float looking head that leaves sticky lace. Smell of toasty black malt. Taste is sweet up front with a font smoothness to the finish. Sweetness is somewhat unbalanced and overpowering. Overall an ok brew and the cans are convienent but lacks much of a punch. Somewhat dissapointing."
"Would not go for this one again. Just not impressed and not what I expected. Had many better examples of this evolving style."
"A decent example that strives to find balance, since a lot of American Black Ales are hop bombs or lean too much into dark ale/stout territory."
"Pours black with with a light brown two-finger head. Good lacing and retention in this one. Aroma leaves a lot to be desired. A bit metallic and yeast. Weird. Didn't carry over into the flavor profile thankfully. The hops are a little off in this one. A bit of a yeasty kick to start off the beer, followed by some weak pine hops. A bit of acidic and not too pleasant citrus hops weaved in there as well. Luckily, the back end of this beer saves it. Nice mellow roasted notes, coffee and unsweetened chocolate and a bit of toffee on the finish round out the beer."
"12oz can. Pours a dark, dark brown with a very thin layer of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is piney and chocolatey. A bit of coffee as well as. Taste is mostly coffee, toffee and chocolate. More flavor of malts rather than hops. A bit of pine bitterness at the end. Hints of citrus. This one seems more like a porter than anything else to me. Not much carbonation. Overall it is a decent brew and I always appreciate a canned brew, but there are better Black Ipas/ales/whatever they are called out there."
"Thanks to uclabrewN84 for the nice extra"
"Very drinkable, nicely balanced CDA/ABA, or whatever we are calling them now."
"Just had one tonight, First out of the can then poured it into a glass. Pours out very dark brown. Smells sweet like orange or something. Tastes a bit metallic, sweet almost like a brown sugar taste, malty, a bit hoppy with a bit of an aftertaste at the back of my mouth, not sure if it is metallic or the citrus. Still,nice drinker, im not sure if i would be able to drink this all day though."
"Pours a coffee-colored translucent dk. brown. Finger sized beige head thins out pretty quickly. Smell is of caramel maltiness and piney hops. Taste is much the same with the piney hops lingering after the initial malt taste. Overall this is a nice beer, very refreshing, but a bit too thin for what I was expecting. It lacked the umph I was looking for."
"Overall: This is a pretty easy way to get used to the idea of an American Black Ale. It hits a solid compromise between hops and malts without leaning too far one way or another."
"D - This is a good balance of hops and roasted malt. This is a characteristic I prefer in this style"
"A thick black-ish brown color with a healthy light brown head and a nice network of lacing. The aroma is a dark molasses malt and creamy nut with just a hint of can in there. Decent. The flavor is charcoal licorice malt with a bright herbal hop. It's very smooth, almost creamy with light carbonation, medium bodied and very drinkable. Lots of near chocolate malt and a pleasant hop overtone. At first I thought I detected some metal but that disappears quickly. I enjoyed this. Could drink quite a few and quite flavorful with stout and ipa ideas nicely blended."
"D - I went out on a limb when I got this one, and I think one was enough."
"m/d - Full sticky body. Drinkable, not sure I love it although I'm not sure if it's the style or the interpretation."
"Pours cola brown (without the carbonation) with a big taupe head that diminishes in a few minutes. Aroma is of grapefruit plus floral plus a bit of a sharp metallic tang. Tastes a nice dark roast malt and chocolate up front fading to grapefruit then burnt grapefruit rind. Combined taste is a bit nasty for me. One is plenty. Not something to impress friends with."
"This did seem like a solid beer from the start,the look,the aroma it was all there but just lost something in the taste for me."
"A decent, not earth shattering beer. I'm still somewhat on the fence when it comes to this style of beer, and this one isn't helping to push me in either direction."
"OVERALL: A lot of times something as unusual and different as a black IPA is can be too difficult for your palate to understand at first, making it tough to drink. That is not the case with the Back in Black. It is a very drinkable beer that tastes like a nice, bitter IPA and a smooth and smoky porter had a baby."
"A likeable beer all and all."
"D- Drinks like a soda... I guess its very drinkable in that regard, but if you want a beer, look elsewhere."
"Sweet and with less roast character than most beers of this style but I like it. More of a IPA that happens to be black."
"21st Amendment Brewery	BACK in BLACK Black IPA--American IPA Brewed With Rich Dark Malts--2010 12 oz. MicroCan. 6.80% ABV. 65 IBU's. (2.5 / 5.0) Cascadian Dark Ale. Thickish pour. Big dense thick tan head with mild lace. Dark ruby edged black color. Fruity herbal mild floral hop front. Minimal black malt toast notes. Mild sweet toasted dry textured slightly fruity roasted black cherry body. Dry mild hop spice end. Confused Brew!! Hops there but not. Dark malts taste fruity without roastiness. Easy to drink with clean crisp mild citrus hop end. Sampled 2/7/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $9.00 at PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 7/29/2010."
"Black colored beer with a slowly fading huge creamy head.Aroma is dominated by hops.Taste is coffee,hops and sweet cream.Very sweet yet smooth goes down very easy.Overall a good beer that is best suited for winter days.I would recommend and would purchase again."
"Color was dark brown--not quite black. It had a tan colored head with good retention. Aroma was mostly hops, along the lines of grapefruit. After it warmed up, I could smell the malts. The first flavors I noticed were some roasted malts and coffee. Then the taste of the hops came through and left a slightly bitter aftertaste, which was pleasant. There was a touch of sweetness, that I could have done without. Body was light. Carbonation level was nice. Very drinkable."
"So excited to try this beer and out of the gate it looks promising with a opaque black appearance and strong head. Aroma is of vending machine hot chocolate, very faint. From here the beer heads down very fast. Taste of sour milk from a metal canteen and virtually no hopfeel on the tongue. My cheapness prevents the drinkability of this one taking a ride out to the town sewer. Can't get over how bad this one is from a brewery that I've had some luck with. It's a huge step forward that craft beer is turning to cans but it's still what is inside that counts and this one fails miserably."
"D: Drinkability is alright. The alcohol is hidden well. It's just a little too sweet for me, so I don't think I'd want more than one."
"Multiple tastes come through in phases. The malts overcome the hops with only a slight bitter sharp edge. Flavors resemble stout, brown ale, a low hop ipa, and even lager. Strange. The waves of flavor pass too quickly to hang on or enjoy them. Seems like it was brewed as a crap shoot beer. Throw a bunch of ingredients in and see how they interact."
"D: Could definately drink a few of these under the right circumstances."
"Mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation, a body that leans towards heavy for an ""IPA", and a slick feel on the tongue. Good drinkability, this goes down easy, hides the alcohol well and was overall quite enjoyable. A recommendation, as I would have this again."
"D- Very drinkable, not heavy, refreshing for a dark beer."
"Overall, disappointing brew. All around. Sorry 21st Amendment, probably won't try others from you line."
"Cheers"
"21st Amendment's Back In Black is not a raucous, rowdy, rock-and-rollin' roof-raiser that would do the AC/DC song of the same name proud. It's a black IPA that is a little bit too fruit juicy to compete with the best versions of this style."
"D: This is solid but not great."
"This doesn't measure up to others in the style, however, it is a pleasantly sessionable take on the style so it has that going for itself."
"I do like it but think it is a bit odd for a Black IPA. A good burger with lots of fresh toppings will compensate for the oddness."
"For a beer I was so excited to try (and such a beauty to look at!) this beer is pretty disappointing. In comparison to other IBAs I've had I have to rate this at the mid-bottom."
"Overall, it was an OK ""black"" ipa. A better mouthfeel and working on that nuttiness with some more chocolate would have helped out a lot."
"Highly drinkable - I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would."
"Again, not bad overall, but there are definitely bad *parts* in there. The smell was so great, I thought I'd be in for something exceptional, but that harsh roast just took hold & would not let go. I have to say, I might try this again just to get that smell, but I might be well-advised to split it with someone."
"This beer is an interesting experiment, but for me, there's too much of a malt presence for it to be a good hop based beer(IPA, Cascade Dark Ale, Black IPA, American Dark Ale, whatever you want to call it) and too hoppy to be a malt based beer. It's not bad really just kind of all over the place with it's flavor profile."
"Big fan of the Back in Black... this is the beer that got me into 21st Amendment. I prefer this Black IPA to both the Sublimely Self-Righteous from Stone and the Imperial Iniquity from Southern Tier. The nose on the Back in Black is superb , hops hit you quick , and the tast and mouthfeel are malty and full of smoke. Great can as well."
"Would like to re-review fresh on tap... Until then this was pretty bad."
"D: I wish I really liked this beer since I am being a big fan of the Black IPA style, but this just didn't live up to my standards or any of the other BIPA's that I had. It's a pretty decent beer but not something I would go out of my way for."
"D: This beer presents an array of flavors for the drinker to sort through, with the hope that they will find one that they like. The end result is not necessarily an extreme version of the style, but just one that struggles to be successful. Malt and yeast qualities seem the most off-center, being a bit too smoky but also bordering on being indicative of autolysis. Flavors are best early, when citrusy aromatics fill the senses aside the smoky malt. Reminiscent of Pizza Port's Warrior black IPA, although not as smoothly malt-forward as that other beer."
"I really like the can too - pretty cool!"
"Easy drinking beer, not too far to one extreme or the other."
"Had this my last trip down to Maryland (haven't seen it around CT yet). Really liking this new hybrid style, the hoppiness of IPA's combined with tasty dark malts. Pours a deep mahogany color, nice cream colored fluffy head do it. Nice roasty aroma, taste is bitter and hoppy but nicely balanced by some caramel tasting malts. Great beer, would definitely purchase again and hope this style keeps growing and growing."
"This is a newer style, but based on what I have sampled this seems to miss the mark for the style with more roasted malt than I care for, and less of the earthy or floral hops I am accustomed to. Certainly not a bad beer, but there are better examples."
"You know a beer style has made it when it has been canned. This beer has excellent lacing but is not as black as expected. It has a sweet, hoppy resin and malt sweetness in the nose. It's very smooth, with a faint roasted maltiness and some char when the beer lingers on the palate. The hops are doing their job, but the malt just lets go. This brew has a semidry finish with some faint roast and hop bitterness flavors to deal with. It seems a bit confused. Perhaps the contract brewer lost touch with the end goal here? It's decent at best, though a good pick if cans are your only option."
"A friend got this from his local place in Boonton and recommended it so I tried one of his. Like it says it is a Black IPA that pours like a normal IPA. Nice lacing on the glass. It has the hoppy notes in the nose and in the taste which was a nice surprise considering the appearance. This beer is extremely drinkable and a highly recommended IPA if you are in the mood for something slightly different and a little harder to find."
"It's one of only a few Black IPAs I've had, but I would definitely get it again! I got a single at Beer Run in Charlottesville VA, but wish I had got a six pack. I haven't seen too many black IPAs around, but try to get one whenever I see it. Go get some!"
"Overall, this is not exactly an amazing black ipa, but definitely a drinkable brew."
"D: A very nice IPA that's incredibly easy to put down. Thumbs up."
"D: I never would've guessed this was right around 7%. Pretty good beer. I could probably have a second one of these but might stop there. The roastiness is a bit much for a few IPAs."
"Good beer thats out of a can. Love that unexpectedness. Love it when craft breweries do that."
"Enjoyed in the company of mikesgroove. Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a massively dark brown almost black with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight bitter hop, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight bitter hop, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was not awe-inspiring by any means, but still good. If this one had a little bit more of a hop profile going on it would have been quite good. As it was more toward the roasted side of things for the most part. A must try Black IPA."
"first off, the label on this beer is super fucking awesome. Dare I say epic? Yes. Pours a deep, near dark brown. Huge tan head. Pretty fizzy, at least it sounds fizzy. Looks good, but not quite black. Pretty interesting aroma. Very sour smelling, not citrus, like you'd think of most hoppy beers. It doesn't smell like a wild ale. This is a different kind of sour. Smells almost like lemon rinds. There's a kind of dark malt thing in there, but not really. The overall aroma seems complex, but pretty hard to pick apart. First sip is a doozey. The dark malt and hops come at you simultaneously. They create their own flavor. It's kind of an earthy, pine off-citrus flavor. At first it hits you and you think you're drinking something thats suppose to be kind of sour, but then you realize it's the hops. Then the hops and malt coalesce to create a truly unique flavor combination that I've never tasted before. At some points it aint bad, but other times I don't even want it. The finish gives off a strong lemon juice flavor. This beer is certainly a good test for the pallet, and definitely a unique experience. It is, however, probably not the best choice for a go to, casual beer."
"D- one of the easiest-drinking CDA's I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, and even though some may want more roasted or bitter tones, it was one of the best canned beers I have ever had"
"Overall: An ok ""black"" ipa. A better mouthfeel and replacing the nuttiness with some chocolate and more roasted coffee would have helped things a lot."
"On tap at the 21st Amendment brewpub in San Francisco. Pours a bitch black colour with a finger or 2 of head, with nice retention. Lots of lacing down the glass. Smells of nice roasted malt and citrus hops. Good blend of bitterness and sweetness of the malt in the flavour. Creamy mouthfeel. Certainly one of the better CDA's I've had."
"I would really like to dry this from the tap in SF to see if those odd flavors are always present. Something tells me this one got a little lost in translation on its way to the contract brewer's cannery."
"Big thanks to Santa Adam for sending along this treat. I poured the can into a Sam Adams pint glass and was greeted with a good two finger worth of tan colored head on top of a nice brownish black colored bodied brew. The aroma of fresh hops filled my nostrils. I also got a good amount coffee and a light touch of chocolate. The flavors mimicked the nose it was hop forward with a little bit of roast coming thru as well. It had a medium feel to it with ample carbonation. I think I liked Sublimely Self-Righteous a little more than this one but I would drink it again"
"Easy sipper in cans, and solid addition to the style."
"D-Drinkabiity is high but the mouth is a little watery and the falvor profile is a little underwhelming."
"There is nice balance in this beer. I like the mix of chocolate malts and lots of hops. The style is interesting, visually ironic. Back in Black is a good, drinkable beer that has some interesting characteristics within the can."
"The feel of this beer is pretty easy and it goes down with a bitterenss that is not too crazy. There is a nice drinkable feel since there is a leash on the IBUs."
"A great representation of this style. A hoppy porter/black ipa."
"As to drinkability, I think it's quite accessible. If you've enjoyed a strong porter and you enjoy hops, this has got you covered. It could probably be more focused, but it's still very nicely done."
"Drinkability: If I was blindfolded, I might just think this was a standard IPA, and might fool myself into thinking the light coffee and roasted profile wasn't really there. A pretty good beer overall, but too bitter considering the lack of roasted flavor. Even the actual hop flavor seems secondary to the bitterness."
"21st A: please check out that strange taste; drinkers: enjoy with the above proviso"
"Perfect amount of carbonation, and a smooth mouthfeel. This goes down easy with no hint of the higher than average %ABV which keeps the drinkability high."
"Finally a beer from 21st Amendment I'd come back to! Pretty good example of the style. This beer isn't too far off from being something really special."
"It's a pretty good beer, but that nose set me up just for the palate to completely miss the mark. A shame."
"A pleasant surprise. Tasty and highly drinkable."
"D: Pretty easy to drink really, I could definitely have a few of these in a night. Nothing extraordinary, just a well made beer that is fairly easy to drink. Very enjoyable. If the nose didn't have the soapy smell I think it would work a lot better for me."
"Serving type: can"
"Drink: I've gone back for seconds and thirds since the review. I recommend grabbing a sixer, they'll disappear."
"D- Not too bad just a bit more hops and it would be much better. I could drink this one again with no problems."
"Cheers Shawn!"
"Beer had promise coming out of the can but fell on it's face when it hit the palate."
"A lot more black than ipa, as much hoppy porter as black ipa. Worth a try, but not a ""big wow""."
"UPDATE: I had this on tap and is MUCH better. Just stay clear of the cans."
"D- Interesting brew. I like the hops upfront with a nice sweet finish."
"M/D: The mouthfeel and drinkability reflects the flavor. I was expecting much more from this brewery I've heard so much about and a beer with a kick ass name. I hope I either got a bad batch or an old showing because this is one of the least impressive ""Black IPAs"" I've ever experienced."
"music: mindfunk - self titled debut"
"Overall: Swing and a miss. This beer wants to be great, and I like it on uniqueness, it just misses the mark on taste. Something about it just doesn't translate."
"It's a nice brew, but I've had better examples of the style. This one falls flat in a number of areas, and while it still yields a nice package, it's far from the pinnacle of the style."
"I had to review a beer named after my favorite AC/DC album and while it's not a bad beer, it's pretty underwhelming. Taste is a bit on the quiet side and while I'm not a big fan of big hops and bitterness, this definitely could have done well with a bit more character to it."
"Drinkability is moderate. Something about this one leaves me ready for a change after one or two."
"D: Probably wouldn't drink this a ton but it's a pretty good beer"
"D - I honestly could finish the entire 6er in one sitting. Good thing I didn't."
"D: Like I said, I remember liking it okay when I had it on tap a while ago. But this was muddled and a mess. Too bad, since I like their IPA a lot."
"D: Not exactly what you think of in terms of the black IPA, but still a good beer."
"Overall, this has got to be one of my favorite IPA's yet. I am absolutely blown away by the appearance and flavors of this beer. Additionally, this is the first canned beer that I have been drawn to and I have to say that I am impressed. I definitely need to seek out more beers by this brewery. I would also like to add that this brewery is wonderfully creative with their can designs, as well as the box that this 6er came in."
"D= Excuse me sir...but can I have another....Loved it and could drking all night"
"Pours a blackish body with good head that receeds on the quick and leaves lace patches down glass. A mix of citric hops and some roasted malts, hint of sweetness...nothing stands out. A little sticky w/ a medium-to-heavy body and the roasted malts are prevelant as beer has a dryish edge. Soapy, citric hops w/ a little spice perk up and poke on the tongue for some good ol' IPA hops taste. The balance is OK but not perfect as I find the hops are muddled and not much sweet malt...just dry and touch of blandness as I drink. This is a good beer but a tad funky aftertaste and overall w/ beer I'm just left with an alright feeling."
"This is very drinkable and rather tasty too. The creaminess of the very long lasting head adds a very pleasing quality."
"Sampled this one not too long ago at The Blind Tiger, NYC. Poured black, with less than a finger of off-white head; average retention and lacing, and modestly visible carbonation. Smelled of citrus hops; piney and bitter peel, though not overly pungent. The taste was surprisingly thin in flavor, starting on a citrus note, and then devolving to a thin, modestly dry finish. Very thin texture in general too, with a hint of carbonation. Aside from the well-hidden nature of the alcohol content, I found this to be a lackluster example of the style."
"D: A good beer from 21st ammendment, Very refreshing and very well balanced as well."
" Body is nice and creamy, with a bit of a dry finish. An enjoyable beer, for sure, but maybe just not up to the spec of a Cascadian dark ale."
"The mouthfeel is very good. Well balanced, and certainly full bodied. This is the best part of the beer in my opinion. What these beers are supposed to consist of. A full well balanced flavor that maintains strong aspects of both the hop and malts. This beer equally has very good drinkability. Could easily be a year round beer for all occasions."
"D: A decent enough beer but the nose was a mess. The taste was decent and the citrus in it was nice. Better examples of the style out there though."
"I have only had a few Black IPAs before, but I think this one really nails the style. A perfect balance of roasted malt and bitter American citrus hops. I'm still thrown back and forth since this is a new style, but I can dig it (a reference to that fact that I'm watching ""The Warriors"" right now)."
"Overall, I find this to be a most enjoyable beer. It brings a new perspective to how widely variable a style of beer can be and offers to blur the stylistic lines even more. If I were to describe this in terms of style, I would say that it's 80% citrusy IPA blended with 20% English porter. Thanks again, BJ!"
"12 oz can from D's six pax and dogz $2.00. Pours extremely dark brown. Healthy white brown head, but quickly dissipating. Coffee toffee and american hop smell. Roasted malt taste balanced well by those wonderful citrusy hops. Neither the hops nor the roast of the malt is too bitter. It's made even more drinkable by a slight appealing sourness . Definitely true to its label. Good job."
"Notes: A really solid brew. It's got a great balance between the hops and the roasted malts that shows they really know what they're doing. Nothing was ever over-powering."
"D - it was ok but I'm glad I only got a single."
"I haven't tasted very many black IPA's, this seemed a little lite on the hops and a would almost classif this beer as a weak stout."
"Tastes darker than the smell. The hop is milder than most IPA's, but the combination is appealing. The body is thinnish, the carbonation is good."
"This ale, at first, drank like a mix between a porter and an IPA - or a hoppy porter. I'd say this one worked. I enjoyed it for what I suppose it is. The pour left a rather magnanimous 2+ inch head, khaki-colored, breaking up in a most unique way - from within - leaving a dense, spider-web formation and somewhat generous lacing. The liquid shows dark brown initially but later reveals a deep ruby color. Very porteresque qualities burst forth in the aroma - mild sourness, light acidic pungency. The hops start to come through after a minute or so - piney and flowery - a strange contrast against the slowly increasing rounded bitter roast aromas emanating with time. That not-quite-sharp sour bite maintains a lead role in the taste throughout, poking out through a thin, depth-deprived porter flavor (a porter profile which reminded me of Yuengling Porter - which I dig). An intriguing fruitiness and Belgian dubbel characteristics show up after about 5 minutes and fill in nicely what starts off as a fairly tasty yet somewhat two-dimensional beer. It drinks equal parts light/smooth and biting and the fruitiness lingers for quite sometime. Overall, worth trying. Not sure if I'd session this, however."
"The mouthfeel is nice & creamy. Will definitely drink this baby again. Gets better as it warms."
"This is an interesting version of a black IPA. Lots of hops that are balanced by a fair amount of malt. It's quite drinkable and refreshing."
"All in all, a pretty good black IPA. Would have liked to see some more chocolate and creamy smoothness out of it though. Or maybe just more hops? This was a tough one to put the numbers to. May need to tweek them if needed as I drink more of it?"
"This beer is interesting. Upfront it tastes like a porter. I get the coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a slight burnt toast flavor. The back is a slight bitter finish. I suppose that's the IPA finish. I think I would not call this a black IPA. The hops, besides the bitter finish, just aren't there for me. The grade is probably too high for thus style, but I happen to like porters so it was still ok with me."
"D - I wouldn't buy it again. On the other hand, if it was present in someone's fridge and the only other offering was Fizzy Yellow, I would choose Black."
"I think this beer is a great effort from 21st Amendment and I look forward to seeing how this style continues to develop. This one can be enjoyed as a sessional and equally as much in almost any climate/temperature situation."
"If they could get rid of the dish soap notes, this beer would be outstanding. Still an enjoyable brew, only the second one that I can say that about for 21st. Something is just off in most of their beers. Not sure if it's because of where it's contract brewed or what. Give this one a shot though."
"Dark chocolate ruby body. Tight froth chocolate brown head. Nice retention and lace properties. Nice mix of chocolate malts and vibrant, citric hops. Very nice aroma. Flavor is solid, but would better with even a bigger hop presence and bite. The chocolate, roasted malt flavor wins the battle in this beer with the piney, citric hops coming in second. Even keeled mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated and medium full body. Enjoyable."
"Overall Impression: The taste that washes back of the palate lingers and lingers. Very intense hops characteristics and the complex malts will lead me to be intrigued of what else that they have brewed. I can't wait to try what other treats that they have!"
"Linger: 4"
"Earlier this year, I tasted a Caserne 30, a gold-colored smoked ald at Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel in Montreal. It was a sensory mixed message, in terms of what a pale beer should taste like and I found it unpleasant and relatively difficult to drink. Conversely the Black IPA (Penombre) at the same establishment was surprisingly tasty and I had high hopes for this Black IPA from 21st Amendment--in spite of the mixed messages of taste and color. And I figured the can would be a big help for freshness. The beer poured a rich brown to black in the glass with a decent tan head and nice lacing throughout. Initial stout-like roasted malt in the nose, but the hops were immediately evident in the first taste. Unlike the Belgian Penombre and it's distinct hop bitterness, however, the hops here were a tad more fruity and bright. Coupled with the rich roasted flavor of the beer, it tasted a bit sour and a couple of times I checked the can to see if perhaps it was outdated. I definitely see the attraction and I did enjoy the drink, but it wasn't quite up to my expectations. Thus the less than perfect rating."
"Overall I find this to be a very nice beer, and I find that I am enjoying this emerging style. This is a very good example. It is great to see the packaging; cans make more sense than bottles."
"This was a pretty good beer, the flavor and scent could have been stronger, but it was well balanced and very drinkable."
"D) A decent brew, but not a standout for me."
"Pretty average beer overall. Nothing spectacular but nothing really wrong with it either. Just average."
"The palate opens with a rather big roasted malt bitterness with char, bitter chocolate and then followed by some simpler sweetness, almost like caramel and sugar. The hops are secondary here, a little pine and some bitterness, both of which are overshadowed by the malt character. A little fruity in the mid-palate before a long finish with a roasted bitterness and a mild creaminess. Medium in body, the mid-palate is rather watery, and the creaminess makes this feel like it's on nitro. Solid stuff, this really is more of a stout than a black IPA, the big difference is the sweetness that's mildly pale malt -like"
"D: Pretty interesting beer. I would drink it again, but it's not something I would seek out, or even choose at a store."
"The body was typical for this new style, Cascadia Dark Ale(Black IPA), not really thin or full and much like most IPA's. Drinkability was OK but not special. Overall, a decent but not noticeable take on the style. Worth trying if you see it."
"Black with two fingers of tan head. At more than half way gone still has a bit of head. Well laced. Aroma is a bit of pine. Taste is fruity piney hops with plenty of malt backing. There is a slight hint of coffee or roasted malts but not a lot. Mouthfeel is right on the money for an IPA. Nice dry bitter finish. Falls toward the middle of the Cascadian IPA spectrum. Awesome for a canned beer."
"Drinkability: A well balanced dark IPA."
"Not feeling any of the 21st Amendment beers I've had so far."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable and sessionable IPA. Nothing outstanding, but still very solid all-round. This is a beer I would enjoy drinking again and would recommend to others readily."
"D- This was my first Black IPA and I was very impressed. I found it to be quite drinkable. I will definitely have it again and I look forward to exploring others in this style."
"Drinkability - not too fond of the grass notes or the high carbonation, not a great example of the style"
"D/M: My eyes say porter but my head says IPA. This is just a cool beer style overall. Very innovative and brings some great crisp flavors together that I wouldn't have expected. I highly recommend this for someone who has not tried the style."
"Thin, watery mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Spicy hops continue their theme in the taste. Malts are crisp and lightly chocolate-coated, but the finish has a hint of metallic copper and other mineral notes. Still, the tight carbonation and creamy mouthfeel are a delight as Back in Black tacks on a snappy zest as the hoppiness lingers after each sip. All in all, a very solid Black IPA that drinks easily for the style. The mineral note is a bit of a distraction, but everything else melds harmoniously. Recommended."
"D - This was a nice black IPA...the nose was very hop forward, but the flavors were malt forward with a nice hop finish...I would drink this again"
"Future outlook: An interesting beer....a pretty decent experience, but probably not one that has moved me to buy again."
"Not my favorite style of beer but a decent enough effort. Worth checking out."
"D. Drinkable. Black IPA's are somewhat new to me. Don't know if it is one of my preferred styles. As for this beer it is pretty good. Nothing exceptional in the aroma or flavor department but good."
"SkÅL!"
"D: A good beer, though not the best. Too heavy on the roasted malts for my preference, but the lightness of the beer does lend to an easier drinkability."
"Overall- Mind bender of a beer because it feels like an IPA, with little other than color contribution from the dark specialty malt. I expected a lot more malt complexity/body out of this just eyeing it up! Well done black IPA and quite fun to drink!"
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Beautiful thick head that just creeps towards the top of the glass. This has a real nice dark brown almost black color. A great blend of stoutiness and ipa. Smells very floral with a chocolatey feel. Tastes like caramel and grass. Interestingly enough an amazing combination. The only thing that this beer really loses points on is that I can still kind of taste can. I could drink this beer forever and it is quite cheap."
"21st Amendment Back In Black is a clear, dim red-brown-black ale with a dense khaki head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a fruity and roasty aroma. It's pretty light bodied; a little watery and metallic with a pretty clean finish. It's quite bitter and dry; sharp and green. It's not very well balanced and not good for more than a pint."
"Hopefully the new brewer can put his stamp on this one. Or maybe this is his.."
"Nearly black in color with a deep brown hue around the edge of the glass. Pours with a thick beige head that leaves lots of wet sticky lacings on the glass. Looks like it would be thick and chewy, but is surprisingly medium bodied with lively carbonation. Roasted malt and coffee aromas with a faint hint of citrus and dark fruit. Flavors are similar to aromas, with roasted malt and coffee flavors in the front, a bit of tangy citrus in the middle, and a dry finish with a slight piney hop finish. Pretty unique combination of flavors. Although I enjoyed it, I probably wouldn't be having 3 or 4 of these at one sitting."
"D - Medium to low. The ABV coupled with the palate confusion makes me think again."
"Drinkability: A mild black IPA that's unassuming, finishes clean, and is easy to drink."
"This beer is fairly drinkable, but is one of those beers that I drink slowly just to appreciate all that is going on. The India black ale is still a young style, and the different interpretations I have had are all quite different, but one thing is for sure, this is one of the better examples I have tried thus far."
"This is my third can of this in as many days, and the first time I wasn't totally feeling it...the second go-around I started feeling more clued in to its secrets...and this third time I just totally get it. It helps that I really like this emerging style, and while this is no Iniquity, it can definitely stand as a good representation of the style."
"drinkable ?"
"D: Love this beer. Easy to drink, good price, great taste... all around- a must try."
"Overall, pretty flavorful, if a bit thin-bodied, but not bad at all, especially out of a can."
"Poured into a glass, this is a very dark IPA with a thick topping of light brown head. You get mostly sweet malts with some slight roasted aromas on the nose. The sweet malts come through first, I noticed some earthy undertones before the hops come through. There is a lingering bitterness that interplays with the malts as you continue to drink this one. The head faded rather quickly but left some considerable lacing on the glass. Another decent addition to the ""Black IPA"" family that seems to be quite popular right now. Very smooth and drinkable with an enjoyable little hop-bite."
"the pour of a nice porter without any cloudy body. Nice mocha head. Simple lemon zest nose and floral soapiness. Brisk feel but rather simple but mild malt notes. Seems like color and not reinforcing the bright hop. Very subtle earth bitter and a hope for dimension. Simplistic jean backbone."
"Good drinkability. A decent black ipa."
"D - I'll pass on this one."
"Drinkability: This beer has it all, but at what cost? It's so confusing and clashing that I don't really enjoy it very much. I understand the attempt being made, but don't agree with the overall result of the flavors. I would leave this one."
"O: The blend of a stout and IPA will either please people, or offend two different expectations. Interesting beer none-the-less."
"All in all, this is a solid brew. Glad to get to try it. Definitely good if you're looking for an interesting take on an IPA or if you're a fan of Black & Tan's. If you're looking for the straight and narrow though, don't worry about this one."
"Wow, taste is something different, I'm not sure if I like it. It's a bit metallic (I don't attribute that to the can), and has a somewhat sharp tang. It's fairly acidic and harsh, a bit grainy as well. There are some hops because I do get bitterness on this but it seems more like bitterness from roasted malt. Mouthfeel is fairly watery, with very light but sharp carbonation. It's not so easy drinking and it leaves a bit of an off flavor in your mouth. Honestly I'm a bit disappointed in this."
"Beer pours a very dark, almost opaque brown. A nice billow of tan head sticks to the glass. Smell is unique, high-pitched malts combined with an herbal hops. All-in-all sharp, but very nice. Taste is nicely complex as well. Dark, toasty, campfire malts meld into a pleasantly bitter finish. Feel is nicely carbonated, and deceivingly dry and thin at the end. The only drawback is that this beer is so ""varied"" that I could only have a few at one sitting. For that though, a good beer, and a great introduction to craft beer in a can."
"Nice beer. Worth a glass or two."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation is a touch high. Drinkability is very good. Overall, a very solid beer."
"The brew is thin enough to session like crazy. I bought a case and I am very pleased. This will be gobbled up for a nice session, at 6.8% it will catch up with you. Very good stuff. My first from 21st Amendment, certainly impressed."
"An easy drinking brew that definitely doesn't let you forget that this is an IPA. Would easily buy a case of this stuff. This is a very sessionable brew."
"12oz can purchased at Beverage World in Ft. Oglethorpe, GA $2. Dark black color, decent lace, short head. Smells roasty, like a porter. Tastes very much like a porter and nothing like an IPA, it wasn't even hoppy. I have no idea how old this was but I am really starting to doubt the whole black IPA phenomenon. Its like most of them are just porters and the really hoppy ones still don't make me think IPA. Hoppy black ale would be a better moniker for these shits."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice black and roasted malt scent along with a refreshingly bitter, citrus hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a killer, citrus hop bite up front laid over a bed of black and roasted malt flavors. It's dry and roasted with a fresh hop character that resinates in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking black IPA. The hop character is outstanding; very fresh and flavorful."
"d: These aren't bad, but I won't in a hurry to buy more without freshness dates."
"My first of the style, unlike any other ""IPA"" I've had. This is not only due to the roasted malt character, but the utter lack of sweetness to the ale. I like."
"Back in Black has drinkability that belies it's look. It's smooth and thirst-quenching and is suitable for drinking more than one on a hot afternoon. The flavor and feel are like flat cola or root beer; however, with nothing lasting."
"Moderate carbonation and a full, creamy mouthfeel. Roasty chocolate and toast up front followed by creamy notes and some bitter lemon on the finish. Not my favorite example of the black IPA style, but still very nice. Light overall feel and quite refreshing, even if all the flavors don't quite gel together."
"D= Not a bad beer but I would venture out to say that it doesn't fit the style very well."
"I am reviewing this beer as a porter because I really like it but just don't see the black IPA it is suposed to be."
"This one pours a nice blackness with ruby shades when penetrated by light. There is a nice white frothy head upon it which is interesting to me for usually beers this dark produce a tan or brown head. The smells are intriguing as well. There is the obviously citrus and floral notes from the hops that comprise an IPA, but it's mixed with (and to a lesser degree in this instance) roasted caramel malts to give the beer a different dimension on the nose. The taste is of a pretty hoppy IPA. The main flavor is citrus specifically lemon. This causes the brunt of the bitterness that is experienced. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for what the beer actually is, and it does a service to the beer in my opinion. If you like the hops, this is highly drinkable. If you're like me and are indifferent, it's still a pleasant brew."
"Drinkability: not bad at all. The sourness does keep me coming back and I find this beer refreshing for all its weirdness. Made a pretty good tailgating beer yesterday as well."
"Will definitely get another case of this and I highly reccommend to other IPA drinkers who havent tried the Black IPA style yet."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked."
"D- beer has come a long way/full circle. Drinking a black IPA out of can...cool. Drinking good beer, very cool. I enjoy this style, and this is a good example"
"An intriguing take on a black IPA but the hops were not as present as Is usual and the sour taste dominated the palate to produce a balanced yet offstyle beer. Worth giving a try if you like sour beer but not to my liking for a black IPA."
"D - A decent Cascadian Ale. There are others that I like more in this category, but it is worth a try."
"Overall, a rather good IBA!"
"Not bad. Liked what it was, which was a watery porter mixed with a splash of IPA, with a squeeze of lemon. Unique and decent."
"Drinkability is good, not heavy like a porter, and not overly enamel stripping of an IPA. Good balance. 1-2 in a night would not be asking too much I think."
"12oz can poured into a pint glass. Appears black with a nice creamy head that takes forever to go away. It smells good, nothing offensive here. The taste is a nice balance between the hops and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is like a less creamy guiness which feels very nice. The alcohol is hidden well. I could drink a whole 6 pack easy and i rarely drink more then two. This will be a new staple for me and one of the better beers i have had this year."
"Medium body, slightly creamy. Alcohol is hidden well. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is good."
"Thanks to bauermj for this one. Jet black in color with a slight white head. The aroma and flavor are full of sweet pine. The beer finishes with a moderate amount of bitterness. It has a mild body and lots of carbonation. The beer has very clean, crisp flavors. A great cascadian ale."
"Feel is mediumish and amply carbed up, the head last forever and this is some active beer here. Goes down smooth and citrusy and not very bitter as the darks really take away from that aspect. Very drinkable beer here and I would go for another in a second."
"Drinkability: Delicious. One of my favorites from the brewery. There is a nice mix of malts and hops in this one. I am glad I picked up a six."
"Body is spot on, bitterness and roasted qualities are in check, but the flavor is missing to make this a true IPA-style beer."
"This is one of the 3 canned 21st Amendment beers available in my area now. It pours a dark murky brown colorm fairly opaque, with a thick light tan head that laces in dried chunks on the glass. It smells like wet resiny hops and roasted malts, and the taste is no different. I'm not the biggest fan of black IPAs in general but this one is pretty good. The hops take enough of a lead to keep me happy. The body's kind of light but this beer goes down easy. This beer will work in a pinch."
"Pours dark brown with a swirly head. Smells pretty light with some light citrusy hops, some light roastiness, and a touch of sweetness. The taste is a good deal more pronounced- this isn't a blow you away beer, but something about the nicely balanced creaminess, dry stout-like roastiness and gentle citrusy bitterness really works for me. I'm at the end of this six-pack, and this beer has really grown on me. Nicely creamy in the mouth and quite tasty. I like this better than I though I would."
"D - For almost 7% and dark, this beer drinks extremely well. It goes down easy due to the coffee/buttery finish. I like."
"D - A queer blend of flavors w/ black malt and bitter hops to me it is not the best of an emerging style, but I enjoyed for what it is"
"D/M: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Really hard to rate drinkability. I like this beer, but don't know how many I would want to drink. It is really different, and something worth trying, but probably not a beer I am going to stock my fridge with."
"Drinkability -- Not too shabby. Hop-forwardness + big roast flavor is a pretty interesting combination. Don't think this one was my cup of tea; the berry-like sweet/tart thing threw me off a bit. This 'Black IPA' avoids the pitfalls of many of its contemporaries by showcasing bitter roast malt character instead of using debittered malt as essentially food coloring. Good on 'ya, 21st!"
"D - Meh I didn't really love it to throw down 10.50 for a sixer but it was cool to try it. And it defiantly better than that horrid excuse for a watermelon beer."
"Drinkability- I thought this was really good. First Black IPA. I enjoyed it thoroughly.Definitely recommend this one"
"D- Nothing too special here. Certainly not a bad beer, but I have had better black I.P.A.'s and if I am in the mood for an I.P.A. I think I would reach for something else."
"Taste is simultaneously sweet, refreshing, and bitter. Subtle toasty notes, but also a solid hop bitterness (along with floral and grapefruit) all the way through. High on alcohol, but in no way out of balance with the malt and (for an American IPA) hops. Bonus: the carbonation is surprisingly light, leaving for a creamy mouthfeel that works really well with the burnt barley."
"Overall, not a very good beer, at all. It is actually quite terrible. Doesn't taste anything like a bipa. Hardy any fresh hops. Pretty much a drainpour."
"Drinkability is good and enjoyable black IPA, perfect balance going on with out either side dominating."
"Overall impression: An easy drinking American Ale. Love this interpretation. Very glad we can get 21A in Central OH now."
"Pours an opaque warm sable with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Strong aroma is fairly hoppy with a firm undertone of citrus, mainly orange and a bit of grapefruit. Strong, hoppy flavor has smoky and nutty undertones and hints of chocolate and licorice. It fairly successfully marries most of the flavors I like in a stout or porter with the hoppy and citrus flavors I appreciate in an IPA. Maybe I should change my favorite sort of beer to black IPA. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy with a slight tinny undertone."
"Drinkability: It's black, it's bitter, but the hop profile, while certainly present, wasn't (thankfully) abrasive and as such, it kind of reminded me of Avery's New World Porter."
"Overall, its pretty decent. I don't think I'd have again but I'm glad i had it once. Definitely worth a try."
"The taste picks up on the smell but adds some coffee and brown sugar, and the mouthfeel is a little on the light side but still very wonderfully drinkable. It's one of the lighter, more approachable dark IPAs I've had, and I would definitely drink it again."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. This is the kind of beer I find myself gulping, however I try not to. This is the first beer I've had from 21st Amendment, and I'm impressed. Check it out."
"The ol' Crack & Glug produced a solid two-fingers of deep-tan foam with excellent retention. It looked like the top of a root beer float. Color was NOT black, as a previous reviewer noted, but instead a deep, dark-brown with cola highlights. Nose was rich with piney hops. I have missed drinking IPAs with the preponderance of CANned beers coming in the form of AALs. I don't get a hop jones like I used to, but neither have I kicked the hop habit. Thank Bob that the chattering monkey on my back has gone away, though. Mouthfeel was medium with a solid hop bite initially followed by a roastiness in the mouth. Wow! What a brilliant way to play with the style. Finish was dry with a magnificent interplay between the hops and dark malts mentioned on the CAN. I am not sure that it would be terribly refreshing on the beach, but it definitely merits inclusion in the cooler in a limited quantity. Put it towards the back, on the bottom, next to the Ten Fidy for the end of the day. Great lacing throughout!"
"Nice and black, decent lace, this beer smells of aggressive hops (Columbus or something similar) that are not as pleasant - floral/cirtrussy - as some. Plenty of pine notes. Bitter but drinkable this is a beer that I wouldn't mind several of, but the malt doesn't play much more of a role other than color-indicator. Some caramel malt in the nose and slight burnt bread on the finish. Dry aftertaste."
"Overall a nice black IPA. Could use a bit more hop presence."
"D: After taste ruins any flavor that comes before."
"Taste: This is an IPA worth trying, mostly due to the heavy and sweet presence of toasted malts. The bitterer hop presence follows up, along with a bitter cocoa taste. The feel in the mouth is thickish and full. Overall, immensely drinkable, but perhaps not quite as nicely complex as some other options...like Dogfish Head's 190minute IPA."
"D: I'm not a fan at all, if this were my beer I would tweak a little bit and make something more like a Schwarzbier out of it."
"A very nice change up for the hopheads out there (me included). As the leaves start to fall, I can see myself putting a few of these down. In tne end it is a nice, ballanced beer."
"This is decent enough, but it almost feels like a cross between multiple styles (porter, ipa, stout) which can confuse the palate."
"D: I'd love to have this beer when everyone else is drinking Bud light...or maybe I need new friends."
"Taste comes in a little soapy, after a few sips, it acts as better friends w yr palate, the bitterness melds with the hops, just takes some time to get it all together. Leads to a good mouthfeel, a dank dark resonance on the tongue. This one seems to be a bit of a palate wrecker."
"I like it when canned beers are tasty. Pours a dark brown-black, nearly opaque, with some chocolatey head. Smell is pretty typical of a black IPA, though I would love it to be a bit more hop-forward like fresh Iniquity or Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous. Roasted malts, piney hops, and a hint of chocolate take the main stage on the nose. Taste is the same--bright kick of resinous hops on the start, quickly overwhelmed by some dark roast malts with dark chocolate underneath. Bitterness re-emerges on the finish, which is lingering. MF is pretty good, standard for the style except that it might be a little thin. Smooth though. Drinkability is really good. I could make a quick session out of this stuff, well done."
"All in all I wouldn't buy again(maybe) but if it was bought for me I couldn't complain"
"Overall: Classifications aside, this is a pretty good stout and one I will have again. Just don't call it a Black IPA....not even close."
"Drinkability is good. The roasted flavor is bit drying but I think I could drink a few of these."
"Overall I loved the smooth taste; wouldn't drink a whole 6 pack of this but a few could be in order. I really enjoy this new Cascadian Black IPA style, not the best one I've had but still good."
"Got a 6 pack from WholeFoods and I never even finished a can. Tried pouring into a glass, drinking it out of the can, either way it was terrible. Resiny hop bitterness, dingy malt character, and an unpleasent sweetness from underattenuation. All in all this is in my top 5 worst beers in the bay area."
"Pours a deep copper color to black with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty coffee and a small hop presence. In the taste, just like the aroma, roasty coffee and a small pine like hop. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, roasty, coffee aftertaste. Kind of like a hoppy porter."
"I have to say this tastes more like a stout with a hop backbone.. compared to Deschutes Hop in the Dark and Stone's black IPA(no clue was it's called as I got it on tap mysteriously @ a buffalo wild wings and the waitress was clueless other than that it was from Stone) which tasted more like a good, solid IPA with a heavy malt backbone. I'd liken this to Troegs Dead Reckoning Porter! Some sawdust aroma but predominately malt.. Heavy lacing. This is an alright IPA I guess but where are the hops?"
"Mini growler pour from the good folks at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours black, medium tan/slate head, frothy and lasting forever at the very thick film stage. Leaves a collar as well and bits of fine lacing. Musty, caramel and winter spice in the nose. Chalky, hoppy, malty. Not much fruit or complexity, mostly I get a quite dry and yes again a chalky note. As it warms, dark malts, and mildly gritty hops come to the fore. Nothing overly impressive going on here. Decent IPA not much beyond that."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head, considerable lacing throughout. Smell is dominated by hops, some citrus present. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts,a bit of citrus to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality brew."
"The mouthfeel is excellent; there is a wonderful balance between hop and malt, all in a creamy smooth froth. There is the obvious alcohol that one expects in a beer of this type. I found it interesting; unique and highly quaffable. Try it if you can obtain it."
"Quite drinkable, too. Yum, I have to say, yum, I am compelled to report."
"D- A drinkable beer yes. A new innovative black IPA novelty beer style yes. This beer falls short on balance. The hops in this beer were just not a big player in the flavor. More hops please!"
"D: Actually drinks well, a new style that certainly needs to be refined. Malty IPA's won't work for me."
"HV"
"Overall an ok example of a black IPA but not that impressive."
"A little off-tasting but I liked it."
"D: Overall, this was a great beer. I've been a little down on this style until now. Most of the beers I've had like this seemed like they were just dark IPAs, without much character from the malt. Or they were on the other end of the spectrum with too much roasted malts, making the beer more like a stout than an IPA. This beer had nice balance and great flavors. I hope to have more like this in the future."
"I enjoy other 21st Amendment beers and canned craft beers in general. I actually had a 12 pack of Dale's Pale in my hand before seeing Back in Black at my local store. I hope this was a problem with a particular can or of bad transit."
"Drinkability: Interesting, but a one at a time beer for me. I've had it by itself and also with a meal...but I don't think I've found the right food to go with it yet."
"This was a pretty decent beer. Basically it seems like an overhopped porter to me--roasted malt flavors with more citrus bitterness than the porter. Interesting beer to try."
"D: Easy enough drinking but not very interesting."
"D - I'm really enjoying this so far. I had sort of gotten the notion that black IPAs(or IBAs, whatever) weren't my favorite, as the grain bill and hops always seemed to clash. I love this combination, though, which is probably because it uses two of my absolute favorite hops(Columbus and Centennial)."
"Pous like a stout , light cream head that decides to coat the sides of my pint glass with each sip. Aroma had dark roasted malts with herbal hops going on more like a hoppy porter or a stout than other black IPAs I've come across. This is the popular style of the moment everybody is making a dark hoppy beer nice to see some variation, not overly bitter in anyway. Flavor was creamy dark roasts a mix of dark chocolate and light coffee tones with blasts of herbal slightly citric hops, goes together ncely a good balanced blend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is smooth and easy going I can't complain it's actally silky texture. Drinkability overall a nice blalanced hoppy dark beer I can't really call it a BIPA compared to other more aggressive versions but it was enjoyable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is weak but certainly a beer that you don't mind keeping in your mouth to enjoy the different flavors. As for drinkability, I doubt that this would be a go-to for any single style lover, but it is an interesting an complex beer to try once."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head above the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Dense head lasts nicely, with sporadic chunky lacing. Aroma is grapefruity hops. Taste is sweet through to the middle, then citrus and grapefruit hops come on, lasting through the close. Mouthfeel is uber-smooth, and drinkability is superb. Another great beer to get for when cans are better than glass, or anytime."
"i loved the smooth taste it had and polished off the 6er pretty quickly. its definitely something i would want to sit and drink on a cool autumn night."
"d - A pretty good black IPA, but seemed much mroe malty to me than hoppy. Would try again."
"D - eh, decent...just missing either some complexity or grace of others like it. I was ready to move on about halfway through this glass."
"D: If your in the mood for a porter, this would be very drinkable. If you looking to enjoy a hoppy IPA then this ale probably won't cut it for you."
"T: Luckily the off smell didn't make it into the taste. It has a straight forward Black IPA taste that I am used to in others I have tried. It has a nice dark malt presence on the front of the palate and then rolls into a nice balanced hop finish with very little bitterness. Overall a good example of this new style. The drinkability on this beer is great. I am about half way done with the first and feel like I could easily go through a six pack."
"D - Pretty easy drinking. This beer is decent but it doesn't blow me away like I was hoping. Could go for some more hop flavor. That being said this being in a can really helps it stick out. I would like having this available to me locally just for the convenience of it coming in a can. I would consider picking this up again if I was in the mood."
"I'd like to see some more reviews to see if anyone else gets the metallic flavors."
"pours a black semi-thick color with a tan staying 1 finger head..looks good..smell is subdued with hops and malt some toffee and burnt toast or caramel,with some chocolate..flavor is similar its light on the porter flavors and light on the ipa flavors,,pine and citrus are there so is toffee and roasted malts,,but its all so light..mouth feel is light in relation to the style it has subdued flavors..21st just does not do it for me as a brewery..however out of the 3 ive tried i did like this one the best,,my recommendation? buy a single"
"Wasnt please with this one. It looked great in the glass but fell apart upon tasting. Both of the 21st Ammendment beers were big misses for me."
"I'm not sure if the previously mentioned stout flavors are influencing my perception here but the feel seems very watery. Easy drinking but I'm ready for something more engaging and I'm less than one quarter done with this pint."
"DB- Like others mention, there doesn't seem to be a good balance here between the malt and hop profiles. The weak mouthfeel certainly doesn't help either. Why fix something that isn't broken, Black IPA's just dont really do it for me. That being said, i think this is a good effort from a brewery that i usually really love. Stick to what you guys to best!"
"D- Very drinkable, like I said before I only attended to have one, and ended up drinking three, very refreshing and satisfying which surprised me cause it only comes in cans which you expect that metallic taste which it didn't have at all, with that said two big thumbs up to the 25th Admendment brewing company for a very enjoyable American style IPA."
"mouthfeel is kinda thin. drinkability is average at best. good to try but this isn't something im going back to."
"addendum: awesome can and carry case."
"DB- I just don't think there is a good balance between the decent malt and hop profiles. The weak mouthfeel certainly doesn't help either. Seems like the Black IPA is one of the new trends that might not make it very far, just feels a bit... off."
"single from River City Cellars, Richmond, VA"
"Drinkability: Hell yea! Fond of this one for sure, a nice hybrid of styles but still maintains the IPA feel."
"This was decent enough I guess but I've certainly had better Black IPAs recently. Probably the lack of body hurt this the most but a little more depth to the flavors would have been welcome as well. I think one can here was good enough for me."
"Another decision made for me by my boy Mike in IL, with Jethro Tull's ""Windup"" rockin' in the background. It pours a barely transulcent, very dark ruby brown topped by a steadfast finger of ecru foam. The nose is odd, kinda like a ruby red grapefruit drizzled with lemon juice. Some orange slices and pine sap find their way in there as well, and I assume that's some light caramel that's trying to evade me in the back. Honestly, this smells kinda weird. Hard to explain, just doesn't seem quite right. The taste is pretty hop-forward, with plenty o' citrus hops flying at me, grapefruit, orange, and lime flavors resulting. Instead of straight caramel, though, some light roasted malts make their way into town, blowin' in like the fools who always fuck with Clint Eastwood (much to their ultimate dismay). The two competing sides continue fighting throughout the tasting, making for quite a pleasant feel, all while Chubby Checker's ""Limbo Rock"" makes me wanna dance a little. Still, something's missing, leaving me ultimately unsatisfied as a whole. The body is a heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a nice BIPA (or CDA, whichever you prefer), definitely worth a taste."
"D - Definitely not one of my favorite beers out there...and I am generall a big fan of 21st Ammendment stuff. This has a funny aroma/flavor that disagreed with me from the start...glad I only bought a single instead of the 4pk(6pk?)...based on others reviews, maybe I got an off can, but I have to say I'm just not getting what others are saying about this one."
"D- although it looks and tastes like a hopped up porter, in truth it's more like a hopped up schwarzbier. seriously hopped up to the point where any and all malt sweetness is pretty much eradicated. hoppy and earthy, easily drinkable and handsome. black ipa is an interesting style and i have a feeling that sooner or later most breweries will take a stab at it."
"Just popped a can of this the other night; also had the pleasure of tasting it on tap at CBS. The nose is full of bright citrus hop qualities with lingering charcoal and cocoa bitterness in the background. This beer drink very well at cooler temps: the bright citrus hop flavors are there in the front to welcome you in while the roasted malts bring you home on the back of the palate, along with hints of caramel. Could use for a bit extra punch in the way of bittering hops. A bit thin in the body despite a nice initial creaminess. As the beer warms the big hop presence fades and gives way to burned coffee and roasted malts. All-in-all a very tasty drop and decent example of style (if you can call it that)."
"Poured from can into a pint glass the beer was pitch black. At first it was a lovely pairing that came off like dry Irish stout with dry cocoa malts and classic American citrus hops. Unfortunately, as it warmed up during diner a less pleasant (though not bad) molasses flavor came forward. I'm digging the style, and it's worth checking out if you are too."
"D: A good black IPA with a more heavy hand with the hops needed mainly to better balance the roasted malty char flavor that pervades this brew. A slight change to the recipe to put a more citrus hoppy signature on this brew will push this beer higher and make it a big winner I think."
"F: Still pretty bitter as it finishes. Some grassy hops come out at this point, and bring more slight citrus and pine but very light. A slight sticky syrupy finish but no real sweetness as it dries to a somewhat dry finish. Some lingering earthy and spicy hop pellet flavors, with late hop addition flavors. Not bad for a black IPA, doesn't go overboard in any category, and is pretty clean and tasty. Going on trips with this would be great, cause taking it in the can always works better."
"This beer pours a black color. The head is a mammoth two inches in height, and recedes slowly into a thick cap of foam. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine resin and citrus. It is completely dominated by hops without even a trace of darker malt aromas. The taste is still very hoppy, but there is a solid malt profile too. The grapefruit, pine, and citrus from the aroma are still present with the addition of of nice roasted malt notes. The malt and the hops are well integrated within this beers taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will certainly drink again."
"12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy hops (grapefruit) along with a bit of sweet malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pine and citrusy (mostly grapefruit, some tropical fruit) hops, bready malt, and some coffee and roasted malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and very smooth. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a pretty good IPA, I'd definitely buy this again. Thanks to Joe at Blacklick Wine and Spirits for recommending this to me earlier today!"
"Great brew in a can from 21st Amendment. Dark brown to black color with a ruddy tan head. Subtly malty aroma with a titch of herbal hoppiness. Medium body, almost light but with a good presence of flavor, nothing sticks out or overwhelms. Well balanced and eminently drinkable!"
"Overall, not too shabby. I enjoyed it both cold and warm. My big complaint is the lingering flavors it leaves on your palate. It tastes like the bitterness and acidity have mixed together and glued themselves to my palate."
"D-Got a sixer, drank four..."
"Quite drinkable, this is definitely a showcase of the style that just happens to be available in a stylish package. No complaints here."
"Drinkability: it wasn't my favorite but if you like lighter beers maybe it's for you."
"M&D: While lighter than other black IPAs that I have tried, BiB still has some structure. It's silky mouthfeel also makes it a clean, easy drinking brew. It's a solid effort by 21st Amendment, and definitely wrth trying."
"A very complex beer in my opinion. Again, more stout than other BIPA's I've had, but very much an IPA at the same time as well. Very nice can as well. As far as I'm concerned, another solid showing from 21st Amendment (on a tangent, what a great name for a brewery!)."
"D - Tasty brew with a reasonable ABV. Decent balance, and easy on the palate."
"D: Meh.. Not amazing, not terrible."
"The beer looks really nice, its very dark with a thick brown head. A but of it seems to linger over the course of the beer. It does smell a little bit cakey but that not necessarily bad. Has a malty flavor to it, almost to the point of tasting a little bit like whoppers. Its certainly not bad, just not really what I expected. The mouthfeel is alright. For such a dark beer it didn't seem terribly smooth. It was drinkable and if I were to drink a dark beer on a hot day, this wouldn't be a bad one to start with. All in all an enjoyable drink."
"Definatly a good beer all around, except for the husky grains. Does not seem to follow the style it is listed under here on BA, of an american ipa. But for a black ipa it does the trick. However, hop aroma does suffer. An interesting brew, but not somthing I could see myself drinking again."
"Notes: This beer is kind of all over the map. The appearance is definitely its best best attribute. It looks amazing. The color is as black as I expected and the head is crazy big. The aroma is pretty bland, but a little better than average. Overall it ends up making a good beer, but nothing earth changing."
"pours a dark, cola-like brown with 2 fingers of head, noteworthy lacing. settled in the glass it has a look reminiscent of a stout, so it's funny to take in the citrus and pine evident in the nose. taste is, as you would expect, more malty than a traditional ipa but the citrus and pine notes are certainly present. quite tasty, actually. medium to highly carbonated with a velvety sort of mouthfeel. 6.8 ABV is a bit high for a session beer, but i could see having a few of these without much trouble. not un upper eschelon beer but definitely a keeper."
"This is my first beer from 21st Amendment Brewing, and I must say I'm quite impressed. Back in Black certainly has no shortage of flavor and is a very enjoyable beer. I'll nitpick and say it would be a little better with more hop bitterness. It's very good stuff as it is though. Cool can, too. Definitely recommended."
"D/O- Standard American IPA, but wait, this one's black. It looks great and feel great, but other than that, this one's not worth seeking out. Get in your car/truck/bike, pick a direction, drive 45-60 minutes, and there's a good chance you'll find a better IPA at one of your local breweries/brewpubs. Cheers."
"Not quite black in color so the name is misleading. Dark brown with a large tan head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is really weak. I just pick up some citrus hops. Sufficiently hoppy flavor giving citrus hints. The dark malt is used more than just color. I do get some roasted malt in the flavor. Bitterness is moderate and at 65 IBUs, well represented. The body is a little more thick and chewy than most IPAs and I credit that to the dark malts. Nice carbonation. Available in cans so the drinkability automatically goes up. Has a couple of weaknesses but otherwise a solid IPA."
"D: Goes down easily, well blended, really enjoyed the malt/hop blend on this. Mild kick, nice representation of the Black IPA style. Definitely worth sitting with for a while."
"Seems more like a hoppy porter than a Cascadian Dark Ale. It's definitely a hoppy Porter, though it's pretty decent. Nothing spectacular though. I'll just stick with Edmund Fitzgerald."
"D - It's good and if you really like the roast/hops thing of DIPA's or CDA's (take your pick), this one one is definitely a sessionable one"
"Very dark with clear, coppery brown edges and a fluffy tan cap. Good head retention with spotty, clumpy lace. Hoppy aroma, lots of grapefruit and citrus pith. Chocolate notes, some brown sugar, slight alcohol. Sharp, piney bitterness, juicy grapefruit flavour, malty sweetness and cocoa towards the end. Very creamy texture with fine carbonation, but the body felt a bit light. I liked it and I'm glad I picked up a six-pack."
"The flavor is burnt caramel and coffee flavored malt with a juicy ride like hop profile on top. The prominent flavors are bittersweet grapefruit and a sharp herbal flavor to the hoppiness as well. Overall this beer is a well balanced and excellent example of a black IPA and also would serve as a good introduction to this style for those more tuning off by the idea of hops and roasty malts."
"D: easy to drink, flavors are good and last. brings me to like 21stAB more."
"eh. the off-flavor in this one ruins its drinkability for me. I bought the six pack, but I wish I had tried a single first. I probably wouldn't have purchased it again. I hope it grows on me. It's not terrible, but not pleasing either."
"Not the best of black IPAs but pretty good. I definitely like seeing new craft beer in a can and this is no exception."
"Ahhh man what a nice Black IPA. Not as HUGE as Sublimely Self Righteous, but right there with Yakima Twilight tied for my 2nd favorite of the style that I've had so far, and it is a great value to boot. Will buy again (and again and again...)"
"Cracked this can into a Sierra 30th snifter. Root beer black with a cappuccino light brown froth. Bubbles on the ring, wavy froth in the middle leaving excellent webbed lacing. Big aroma of piney hops. Dry and roasty right off the bat. Dry, bitter hoppy mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Black IPA? Not as good as the Stone version but better than the Deschutes one."
"Would I buy more of it? - yep. As soon as this glass is empty another can will be opened and it will be refilled."
"D - Somewhat drinkable. I'd give it a 3.0 normally, because it's so far off from an IPA, but I appreciate the creativity here that 21st Amendment is trying to introduce...there is nothing in the book that says IPAs must not include chocaltey flavors. It does need work."
"D: Ok"
"D - Very good drinkability. I would have probably liked a little more bitterness in the taste, but that's just me, overall a very good Black IPA, or CDA, whichever you choose to call it. Will definitely be getting again."
"Mouthfeel is nice, decent light refreshing body and nice lower carb gives a slightly creamy feel. Drinkable but just lacking that bit of personality I'd like to see. This was good, but a bit amateurish IMO."
"Drinkability is very good. Nice black IPA, flavorful, with a nice balance of sweet and bitter notes."
"Good carbonation. Good malt to hop balance. Wondering if they actually brewed this baby or if they had a guest brewer do it because it's a great beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp from the carbonation, and semi-dry in the finish."
"I had a couple of these the other night and really enjoyed it. Not too hoppy, like many west coast ipas, and it was quite drinkable. Dark in color, very smooth drinker, easy to drink a lot of. I suspect it won't be here on the east coast enough to be a great bar favorite but if you can get this on a regular basis you should."
"Had this on tap at Stub n Herb's. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Aroma is like a little baby Darkness. Nice roastiness with huge hop presence, but on a lighter scale. Hops are nicely balanced with the roasted malts when it's cold, but becomes overly hoppy as it warms, which throws it out of balance. The last few swigs of the goblet yielded a bitter, minty, herbal hop flavor that just didn't mesh well with the dull roastiness. I would have liked more sweetness in this beer accentuate the hops, but it wasn't bad when it was cold."
"D: This particular batch does the black IPA justice, but not a style that I particularly love."
"drinkability: good"
"Up there with Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous (/11th Anniversary Ale), imho."
"Reviewed on 11/21/2009. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a dark dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of citrus, roasted malt.. Flavor is sweet initiaaly with orangey, citrus notes and a crackery malt finish. Very enjoyable! Not as roasty as some of the other black IPAs with a prominent hop presence. Well done!"
"Can't say I'd go back for more."
"Mehhh... While certainly not wretched, can't see any reason why I'd want to try this again."
"Overall this I find this to be a wonderful Black IPA and another strong offering from 21st Amendment. Recommended"
"Beer is a little thin IMO. And here is the roast. It mixes in the back of the mouth with the hop bitterness. Its not a terrible mix but it does seem a little out of place. Beer is a little harsh with all that back of the mouth bitterness with very little in the other parts of the palate to connect them. Drinkability and mouthfeel suffers."
"This is my first black IPA for what it's worth. Pours opaque black. Overwhelming grapefruit in the aroma. So much so that I can't get anything else. Thin creamy head, disappears quickly but leaves lots of lacing. Taste: lots of grapefruit but some pine. Thick mouthfeel, almost like a Russian imperial. Bizarre (and has some palette dissonance) to have this palette with the hop profile. Back end has a peculiar combo of hop bitterness and stout bitterness. I love this beer. Well balanced. I would drink this any time. Awesome."
"I had this in growler, The color is really awesome for an IPA, it truly is black, and I have never seen a Black IPA before. I have been impressed with 21st AMDT Brewery since trying their Watermelon and Regular IPA. THis beer smells of dark roasted malt and some nice hops. It tastes excellent as it has a nice coffee and roasted taste which compliment that big hops very well, this beer is very drinkable as it doesnt have that ""back of your throat dryness"" that some IPAs tend to exhibit. You could drink this all night if you were an IPA fan. great job again to 21st amendment who is really establishing themselves as a top 10 brewer."
"Overall- Solid throughout. Sessionable and hopefully will become more plentiful in my area."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, it goes down smooth"
"Overall this is a very solid dark IPA and one that's well worth seeking out if you like the style."
"Drinkability: this beer had a nice overall flavor and qas considerably easy to quaff."
"Drinkability is usually an issue with this style for me, but this one doesn't come off too heavy. Alcohol plays no role in the flavor profile and this is a very tasty example of a great up and coming style."
"""... kind of a sinkwater smell."""
"D: An excellent beer. A great IPA kicked up a notch with some light roasted malt."
"It's not on the 21st Amendment website and I trust my fellow BAs, but I thought that I should mention that the abv was listed as 7.2% at the store, which would make sense as Back in Black is brewed along the same lines as the IPA (who cares, really). Anyway, the beer pours an opaque dark brown with purplish highlights and a good creamy mocha head that leaves excellent lacing. I'm not really sure how to rate the appearance of an intentionally dark IPA, which was certainly not to style, but I like how it looked. The aroma was very close to the IPA, strong, rich hop aromas of pine and spruce with a tinge of citrus and herbs. The flavor brings the dark malt into play with subtle roasted notes underlying the strong hop flavors. I've only had one other dark IPA that I can think of, Stone's 11th/Sublimely Self Righteous, and while they have different hop bills, they're similarly delicious. It's a great variant on the style but oddly rare among commercial brewers, although the homebrew community seems to have embraced it."
"Drinkability is high, this is damn tasty. Really easy to loose the roast in the pungency of the hops, but it's there no doubt, and isn't overly chocolatey or sweet like of the other black IPAs I've had. Wow, super impressed with 21A, each beer is better then the next."
"D: Very, I really like the dark IPA's and this one is one of the better examples."
