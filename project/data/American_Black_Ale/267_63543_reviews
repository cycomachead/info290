"Overall:  A fantastic Black IPA.  Impressive considering I am enjoying this past the best by date.  The high ABV provides some warmth but does not overpower.  All of the components are balanced  very well."
""
""
""
"People tend to get intimidated with the name (Double Black IPA). However the black part of this beer tones down the hoppiness allowing this beer to be very drinkable. Lots of flavor and lots of alcohol (9.5% ABV) makes this among the top of my list."
"Pours a dark brown, black. Smells of dark roast malts, some char, pine and some citrus. Tastes of roast malts, caramel, pine, citrus and floral hops.  Medium body and carbonation. Citrus and pine resin, sweet malts."
""

"Very good example of the style. Certainly a sipper though   ;)"
"Another great brew from this brewery.  It could just use a bit more bitter taste as it leaves a bit quickly"

"I am still trying to get over the oxymoron of a black IPA but here goes: Grassy hops, light roast, hints of chocolate very faint spice suggesting anise on the nose. Pours brilliant black to dark brown under a 3” tan cap. It is very creamy with an underlying sweetness with light roast – but no burnt flavors, dark sugars suggestive of light chocolate, faint fruit and spice on the palate. Less hop bitterness than expected. Medium body and a little more than medium on the carbonation. Not as hot or warming as your would expect for 9.5% abv. Very drinkable."

"Dark. Heavy. Flavorful. Malty. Alcohol."

"The beer poured a pitch black with slight ruby highlights when held up to the light a and a slight tan head that left sufficient lacing.  The aroma was slightly piney but more resinous and citrus notes with sweet roasted malt backup as to be expected in a Black IPA. The taste exceptionally glided between dark roasty bitterness and piney, resinous hop bitterness that played off each other and kept my deeply coated palate guessing as to where all the flavors were coming from.  The citrus hop flavors peaked their head out from time to time as well and really accentuated the interplay between the dark roasted malts and hop bite.  There is almost a rye or roasted coffee tone deep in this monstrous beauty of a beer.  A really superb Black IPA that manages the line between roasty malts and bitter hoppiness with finesse, if you can say that about such a high abv brew.  Another great one from Odell."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown to black coloring, with a thick, foamy, tan head. Nose of grapefruit, smoke, roasted coffee, pine resin, and subtle chocolate notes. Flavors are grapefruit forward, with a decent smoke overlay, subtle tropical fruit sweetness, and a bitter resinous hops highlight throughout. Smooth, light bodied, with a smoky, roasted, and extremely bitter aftertaste. The finish is dry, slightly frothy, with a resinous, bitter linger. Good beer."

"A beast of a beer, but so much good flavor, if there's a flaw it is drowned out by the intensity of what's going on. This is like getting two beers, a roasted barleywine, and a super fresh IPA. If you like the style, this is a much try."
""
""
""
"Near black opaque body with a filmy beige head. Aromas of pine, chocolate, roast. Lovely balance. I'm not typically a of fan of black IPAs, but this is certainly noteworthy. Bitter chocolates and resinous hops. Silky mid palate finishing with some bitter chocolate and hop notes. Well done."

"Overall - I love the Black IPA (Black Ale) style, in fact, possibly my favorite style. This is a brilliant representation! Complex, balanced and tasty...very well done!"

"Pours a dark brown color with a good sized brown head with pretty good retention. Definitely resembles a Stout. Good deal of lacing. Smells of lightly roasted chocolate and coffee, as well as sweet, dark fruit and light citrus hops The alcohol is definitely there. The taste reveals some slightly more tamely roasted malts (as compared to the aroma). Licorice and sweet molasses go along with the chocolate as it warms. The taste is harder to completely pinpoint than I had expected. A good amount of bitterness, but this is one beer that I would say could benefit from even more bitterness, which would've complimented (in my opinion) some of the fruit, molasses, and overall sweetness. Incredibly easy to drink- I could probably down 3-4 of these in an hour, which is impressive considering the ABV (second straight time I've had that sentiment regarding a beer from Odell). Overall, a little bit less than what I was hoping for, but if you're looking for a balanced taste, with high ABV and drinkability, this one is a good bet."

"Overall: This a spectacular beer that mixes the best of the imperial IPA world with the Russian/imperial stout world. Extremely dark with only the hint of hops that one would expect. This is like a mix of Odell's Myrcenary with Lugene's. I feel like Odell should advertise this as some imperial stout IPA as that is the best description I can think of. The best food pairing I can imagine is some barbecued brisket. Fantastic beer that merged my friend's favorite flavor with mine. Highly recommend for a stout lover trying to get into IPAs."
"Appearance: Near perfect for me. I enjoy milk/imperial stouts, and I was not expecting to like this beer. The color is very dark and the head is quite nice. Smell: Notes of chocolate and milk. Again, not what I expected, but I loved it. As the beer warms to room temperature, the hoppiness of the IPA comes to the forefront. Taste/mouthfeel: This is a unique beer. At the pour, the beer was chilled and I very much enjoyed the stout-eske characteristics of malt and body. As the beer rose in temperature, I both smelled and tasted more hops, which I personally did not care for as much. My first sip was perhaps the best; the flavors all came at me in progression for a hell of a ride, finishing with the signature hoppiness of an IPA that I expected. Overall, this beer intrigued me. It strikes me as a hybrid of a stout and an IPA. I will likely try it again just for another chance to decipher all that is going on in its taste."

"I figured that I'd finally pull this out of my refrigerator and review it after a hard weekend of working on the house and selling some car parts. The fact that today we switched back to Mountain Standard Time from daylight savings is only icing on the cake! This is a fantastically complex and rich beer that blends the attributes of two of my favorite styles: hardy stouts and IPAs. It is really just absolutely delicious and I could see myself drinking a couple of these in an evening if only I could erase from my memory the disaster resulting from $2 a pint Old Rasputin...."
""

"O - Definitely worth trying and I'm not a fan at all of Black IPA's."
"Pours a deep black with dense creamy tan head. Heavy lacing left behind and great head retention. Nose starts with some nice herbal hops along with some bright fruity notes. This is paired with a nice robust roasted barley note. Taste is herbal up front with plenty of roasted notes and piney hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the black IPA since they often seem gimmicky. This one melds the dark malts nicely with the hop profile and makes for a delicious beer."
"I don't drink Black IPAs very often, but I always appreciate a good one. The blend of light roastiness and lemony hoppiness makes for an interesting, complex flavor. This one is a good one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good example of a black IPA, the body of the beer is solid, and the hops gives a well rounded performance. I really enjoyed drinking this beer."
"O - A nice black ale that does a good job melding the roasted malts and bitter hops together. The alcohol is not present and it is quite nice."
"Poured into a Maui Brewing Company pint glass. Super dark, almost pure black. Smell is wonderful. Malt, Chocolate, hop, a little mint as well. Taste is, well, sip, sip, sip. You feel the alcohol more than you can taste it. I'm sure it could creep up on you pretty quick. Taste is malty goodness, chocolate, hop and more hop. Great beer from a world class brewery. Cheers!"

"Wow, I thought New Glarus Black Top had its self together as far as the blending of the styles goes. This is quite a bit bigger beer, but it is in perfect harmony between hops, malt, alcohol presence and feel. Really good stuff. I am trying this for the first time and it is 5 days before its best by date, I know it is not that old but I do wonder if I would like it as much fresh with more of a hop bite, either way I am glad I was able to get some for 6.50 a 4 pack!"
""

"Overall, this is a fun and complex beer. The hops balance well against the chocolate maltiness."

"I generally don't like stouts. They're too much of everything, and very little balance. But Mountain Standard made a believer out of me. It's strong, and hella spicy. And then the alcohol hits you. If a beer could be exciting, this is it for me. The taste will distract you from whatever else you're doing; you can't ignore it."

"O-This is a hop-heavy example of the style that drinks much like a IIPA, so props to Odell for truth in advertising this Double Black IPA. This tasty beer that hides its alcohol well and provides a nice balance between citrus hops and chocolate-forward malts. A nice hoppy beer for this brisk winter evening and a good break from my stout binge of the past few weeks."
""
""
""
""
"By far the best black IPA I have had as it should be since it is the most expensive. More flavorful with the hops and the malt over any other I have tried. Odell brewing does it again. WOW just a fantastic ""black IPA"" that blows any others that I have tried out of the water. Don't really have any complaints about this beer."
""
""
"Overall, a decent take on the black ale style. I wish there was a bit more hop presence, as the crazy blend of floral, herbal hops and earthy, roasty malts is what I love about the ""black IPA"" style in the first place. I also think the ABV level on this one gets a bit away from them, imparting more heat than I would expect, even of an imperial version of the style. Trust me, however, when I say I won't mind finishing the 4-pack."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Smooth and soft. Heavy and approaching a syrupy lingering sweetness usually associated with stouts."
""

"As I said up top, I am a fan of well done Cascadian Darks. This is one of the best I've had. This continues the trend I've noticed since moving to the midwest: I'd never had their product before, but holy shit those folks at Odells know what they're doing. This is an outstanding beer from an amazing brewery. I don't think it's hyperbole to say I'd put it among my favourite beers I've had. Period."
"Overall: I liked the beer. I'm unfamiliar with the style, but it seems a little more hop American hops character would have made it great."
""
"O - 4.5 - Nice. I liked this the first time I had it, and I like it again now. Great beer."

"The hops definitly dig deep right from the start all the way to a pithy finish, there is a ton of hops in here. The malts are thankfully not as roasty as some of these Black IPAs can get. Hops are lush, fruity and bright, also fairly unique in this style. Excellent beverage, Odell can make some damn fine hoppy beers."
""
""
"Poured a deep coffee black with a one finger off-white head. Quite stout like in appearance, but very nice. Scents of peat moss, pine, roast malt and black coffee. True to style, the earthy qualities and hops shine through, backed by a nice roast and black malt scent. Very well done. Taste is roast malt, a bit of alcohol mingling in the background and finish, an ample level of piney hops, citrus pith and grapefruit, some very faint hints of coffee and sweetness and a nice earthiness in the background. It's a very good set of flavors, hoppy yet roasty, bitter with an earthy hint. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation and some alcohol burn with an oily-slick finish. Very good, quite nice to drink. Overall this is a good black IPA. It's got the hops, it's got the earthiness and it's got the roastiness to compete with others in it's class."

"Overall: Delicious as a sipper. Quite strong though."
"O: Great beer. Classic Colorado brew! A legend!!"

"Poured from a bottle with a Best By date of 1/8/13. Pours an incredibly dark black with a light tan head with great lacing. The aroma the brown sugar and coffee, clearly the age on this beer has dulled the hop character of the DIPA, but what remains is an intriguing beer. The flavor mirrors the aroma, lots of dark roast coffee and big malty sweetness. The end still has a good hop bitterness but very little other hop characteristics, and the finish is slightly sweet with an alcohol warming. Overall, I am very impressed with this beer's aging ability."
""

""
""
""

""
""

"O - fairly unassuming at first but the flavours build along with the drinkability making for an outstanding example of a style that I hope grows in popularity"
""
""
""
"O: A really impressive high-ABV CDA that is smooth, flavorful, and balanced with hops and maltiness both making bold statements. A really impressive beer that I think should be a standard-bearer for, dare I say it, imperial American Black Ale or CDA."
"Pours a very dark brown with moderate tan head. Good retention and moderate lacing. Moderate aroma of citrus and floral hops with a hint of roast. Flavor is a nice balance--bitter chocolate and toasted grains are there, but just enough to contrast with the nice hop profile. Not as much black patent bitterness as many black IPAs and a nice mix of citrus and piney hops. Medium mouthfeel and a clean finish. Very nice."
""
""
""
"O. Mountain Standard is an outstanding balanced IPA. Smooth and tasty - almost too much so for the 9.5 ABV. Will be back for more."

"Appearance is a dark brown in a red-orange hue. Nice 2 finger frothy head. The aroma gives off the smokyness hinting at the hoppiness to come. The smoky flavor is a little overpowering which is expected from a black ipa. Wish it was a little more subtle. Taste also hangs out a bit in the back of your pallet. A good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"M- Goes down very very very smooth. Not a black ipa because of the lack of hops but a great overall beer"
""
"Overall, this is almost exactly what I expect a Black IPA to be. Sweet and thick like a porter with a very well balanced hoppy bitterness"
""
""
"O - Grab a 4 pack at any cost"
"Overall- This is what a black IPA should be like. Beautiful cross between a porter and an IPA."
""
"Pours a dark cola-brown with a fluffy dark khaki head that settles to a thick cap. Nice and resinous, with the standard grapefruit, espresso, and dark chocolate aromas of a ""Black IPA"". Taste is similar, perhaps a bit closer to a hoppy stout then a""Black IPA"". Chocolate, dark malt, espresso, grapefruit rind, and resinous hops. Nice. Mouthfeel is pretty full, with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Pretty decent beer, surprised to see the ABV on this, as it's surprisingly drinkable."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium-low intensity, creating a very smooth mouthfeel that foams up only slightly upon the palate. The result is a very pleasant, sippable beer that features a dry close with mild stickiness lingering along the palate. Despite being able to taste the ethanol slightly, I feel little to none in the nostrils or across the palate, but a slight burn on the back of the throat that's almost negligible. The heavy smoothness of this beer is excellent."

"Really nice brew...well balanced and super tasty. Awesome."
""

"Overall pretty good but a bit too much hops to give it any interesting difference from an IPA."

""
""
""
""
"Overall - After having ""Hop in the Dark"" by Deschutes, I didn't think I'd ever find a Black IPA I liked more, but Mountain Standard has proven me wrong. This is an absolutely amazing brew for those who love hops! 5/5"
"Overall this is one of the better ABAs out there. Great roasted notes with an awesome piney and resinous hop profile balancing things out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good Imperial Black Pale Ale and one that should definitely be tried by anyone who is a fan of the style. I sort of put this on par with Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, but for different reasons. The malt profile is better here, and has a lot of depth, where as SSR is hoppier. Wookey Jack is still the standard but this is quite nice indeed. Odell delivers again."
""
""
"A phenomenal, slightly different beer: Starts with a light brown sugar sweetness. There's a toasty flavor as well. Slowly, the bittering hop takes over; peppery and spicy. Warm alcohol in the swallow. Long, well-balanced aftertaste. The body is neutral/ the carbonation high."
""
""
""
""
"Mountain Standard time is one of my favorite beers. It isn't shockingly complex, just damn good. I wish I had access to it more often. If there was an imperial American black ale style, this would be its captain."
"For thinking I hated American Black Ales, this one has also changed my mind. Highly recommended, and very nicely flavored. My only complaint is MS drinks a bit too much like a Porter.."
""
"Pours a nice brown, cola color with a nice beige head and decent lacing. A bready, chocolatey, and slightly herby aroma. Flavor followed suits; started off malty and doughy then some some chocolate, and some herbal and twiggy hops kick in and close things out, giving it some bitterness. A nice full, creamy and active mouthfeel. Overall, fresh of the tap in their taproom I quite enjoyed this one. Its probably just me but this felt more like a brown IPA than a black IPA and I actually enjoyed that. I'd happily drink this again."
"Overall, this beer is just so well done. Balanced flavor and mouthfeel makes this one special beer that is cheap (relatively) and easy to drink. The sum is greater than the parts."
"Overall- A solid brew, wish I had the chance to try it fresh but, a few years has mad this a well balanced brew thats really easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting brew, I was expecting a black ipa or a black anything but it's a nice medium brown, funnily enough. Tastes like a cross between a black IPA and a barleywine. I would probably classify it more as an american strong ale than anything. Taste is well balanced, smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very high as a result. Gotta find a fresh one of these sometime to compare."
"Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed this double black IPA because I found it to be perfectly balanced without one aspect overpowering. It is too bad Odell does not distribute to my state because this is one I'd seek out on a regular basis."
""
"Final Thoughts: This is the first Double Black IPA I've ever had. Though, the name may sound daunting, it's actually one of the more interesting styles I've tasted. Pairs very nicely with a chocolate dessert. But I imagine it would also go well with any well seasoned steak. It's also great on it's own. A very versatile beer."
""
""
""
"A+, and one of Odell's finest."
"Overall: About a month past the ""best by"" date, the hops have lost some of their assertiveness, but this is still a nice beer; I'll have to try a fresher example next time I am in Odell territory"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one goes in to the category of Black Ales/ IBAs that I actually like. Although it's ease of drinking belies it's alcoholic strength. Have to put a stop after one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a huge tan head. The aroma has a lot of pine and resin notes, with some darker malt thrown in. The flavor is very similar, with the strong pine and resin notes from the hops really coming through strong. There is also some chocolate and lightly roasted malt, as well as some cream and a low amount of bitterness. There is also a slight medicinal flavor, but I can't pick out what it is caused by. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I love black DIPA's and this is a very good one from Odells!"
""
""
""
""
"Beer is much better than the aroma. Medium body. Nice pine hops. Good finish. Clean and nice with moderate bitterness but no real roast. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Odell - is there anything they don't do well???"
""
""
""
""
"O - Well it is called a Double Black IPA, so I guess it should be no surprise that the dark roasted malts are in the front. A very good and unique brew for sure. Glad I got my hands on this one, thank you again Todd!"
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew in the Black IPA category, which happens to be one of my favorite styles. And this one ranks right up there with the best of this style."
"Had on tap at Bitter Creek in Boise. Dark coffee in color with a small mocha head that did not lace the glass much. Low in carbination, but a nice hop burst and with eyes closed it is easy to imagine the beer as an amber color. With eyes open you can taste a little coffee bitterness. The alcohol is well hidden, and the hops are relatively mild- I really enjoyed this- as did my wife who is not much for hoppy beer."
""
""
"Body is medium, not too thin, carbonation just a touch below medium, with nice life on the tongue and a smooth, slightly creamy feel. Lingering aftertaste is bitter but not over long or aggressive; the roastiness, grapefruit peel, and pine resins dissipate slowly, giving you something to remember as they fade. The alcohol, while packing a punch, isn’t noticed in the taste much, if at all."
""
"Very good ""double"" BIPA. Plenty of hop character and plenty of stout character. Neither one overwhelming."
"Overall - I haven't been disappointed with O'Dell yet, and this is yet another notch in their belt. Along with Myrcenary, they brew 2 of my all-time favorite beers. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall: Maybe the best example of a black IPA I've ever had. Not the most intense beers ever made, just extremely well crafted."
"O - One of the better beers I've had recently and certainly a top contender for the Odell brews. I bought this because I've always been happy with the Odell stuff and this certainly has not let me down. This is the first I've tried Double Black IPA and I hope all other examples are equally delicious in this style."
""
""
"Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. The alcohol is well disguised. I never would have guessed this has an abv of 9.5%. If you haven't tried this beer yet, please go purchase some. You won't be sorry that you did."
""
"A well done beer that shows quality and depth. Well balanced and highlights a very bright hop profile while featuring Colorado grown products. Glad this is now available in 12oz."
""
""
"Overall, this is actually a solid black ipa. Very hoppy. The malt and roast is minimal so it doesn't take away from the hops. I like it."
""
""
""
""
"While I really couldn't imagine saying a negative word about Odell, this beer does not compare to Sublimely Self Righteous. There, that is as negative as I can get. What a lovely, deliciously hoppy brew! Another wonderful job by our friends up in Fort Collins!"
"Pours like the blackest of coffee with a finger of tan head and indiscernible beading. Nice lacing. This beer is extremely well balanced, atypical of the style. Roasted black malts are blanketed with an understated mix of hops. Nose caries through to the tongue. Comes across more as a ""hoppy something darker"" than a ""darker something hoppy"" - quite tasty though. The feel is suitable, as is the carbonation. Overall, a well-balanced Cascadian Dark Ale ;)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic brew. I would've expected it to be a tad bit thicker, but this worked just fine."
"Overall, possibly my favorite beer from Odell so far… they hit the jackpot with this one, despite the $11 4-pack I will be buying more of this in the future."
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Black Ale. Very big and robust flavors but well balanced."

"Overall a bold and hoppy Black IPA with just the right amount of sweetness, thus creating the perfect balance of flavor in this exceptional brew."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style. The juicy, fruity hops mixed pretty well with the chocolaty, darker malts. Too often I find that the bitter hops clash with the bitter roastedness of the dark malts in this style of beer. This one however really avoids that pretty well and I really appreciated that in it. Very drinkable and flavorful beer overall."

"O - One of the best Black IPAs I've had. Again, very well balanced and tasty. Very good drinkability. Odell make some great beers, and they don't disappoint with this one."
"O: I'm sure glad a few of these made it through my checked luggage. This is a wonderful example of the style, puts its own stamp on the style with a nice smoky and woody quality balanced with a slight bready sweetness. The closest comparison I can think of is New Glarus' Black Top– also a great offering. However, it is unique and a pleasure to drink."
"Overall: If you want a hop forward black IPA then you absolutely must try Mountain Standard by Odell. In fact, if you are a fan of IPAs in general you should give this one a shot. Those guys at Odell, they know how to make an IPA."
""
"Somebody should blind taste this with Lagunitas Sucks. Well, duh, one's black and one's golden, but that malty/piney sharpish flavor seems to be a winner. These guys are making some great beers and I have not stumbled on enough of them."
"Smells piney and a bit resinous with notes of roastiness. Up front theres a dark creaminess, almost chocolatey followed right on the heels by piney hops and it closes with roasted malts that tie the taste up. You get a little bit of leftover bitterness but not as strong as would usually occur with an American DIPA. This is a real nice example of a black IPA done well."

"o. the best black ipa i've ever had. being from colorado, i love a good colorado brew, and this one is exceptional. reminds me of the moutains with snow falling with the smell of pine needles permeating even the cold. a wonderful beverage."

"Overall a strong example of a black IPA, with really great balance between the malt and hops. Happy to have a chance to try this one!"

"O: Best Black IPA I have had. Lots of porter qualities, bittering hops, and an amazingly creamy mouthfeel. This is the first Odell beer I have had, and I am very excited to drink through the rest of their line up. Mountain Standard is world class stuff. Find it and enjoy it."
"Slainte."
"O – A solid black IPA with a strong flavor profile that was not too large to really turn-up the drinkability 4.5"
""
"Odell Mountain Standard Double Black IPA: I am a fan of Odell products, especially if they come in a four pack. The Mountain Standard does not disappoint. As the name implies, no light shines through this black brew. The head is tan and thick, lasting for the whole experience and leaving a beautiful lacing. The aroma is very pleasant, with lots of hop complexity. The Mountain Standard is very balanced in the flavor department. It has good malt flavor, but is not too sweet or too big. The hops are well refined, adding to the flavor, but not overpowering it. In a time where brewers push beers into a statement category with big abrasive brews, the Mountain Standard is a great beer that impresses you rather than overwhelms you. A must try."

"I can't put my finger on where this went wrong, but it did. This beer doesn't stack up with any other so-called Black IPA's I've tried, and perhaps because it seems quite different. Maybe the hop variety doesn't mesh well with these malts? Perhaps it needs to be more roasty/stout-like and less nutty sweet? Either way I can't recommend it."
""
"Overall – very nice, good-tasting brew. Not terribly intriguing to think about while tasting, but not boring either."
""
"O: I really enjoy this one.  It's right up there.  Solid A for me. Top 3 Black IPA versions I have tried."
"Overall I am not in love with this but do really like it. I really like having an IPA in between Stouts and this one does it all in one beer. The dark roasted flavors and the bright hop flavors are all there but I think I'll stick to my current combination. Obsidian to (insert West Coast IPA)."

"Light roasted bitterness up front. Rich malty palate, with notes of dark chocolate, caramel, and molasses. This is balanced, and then overshadowed by, evergreen, roasted coffee, citrus, and Scotch tape bitterness. Interesting mix of citrus/evergreen, dark fruit, and roasted malts. Medium-full body, with a creamy feel. Not too shabby!"
"On tap at 1702 Speedway. Was not a fan of Black IPA until I tried this one. Pours dark brown with a khaki head lacing that lasts throughout. Aroma is a little piney with hint of citrus and some sweetness from the grains. The taste is smooth a fairly light, a bit different than the nose. The grain is stronger than the hops and has a moderately strong roast. The hop flavor is mostly in the finish with a bitterness that competes with the grains and a light pine and citrus that lets it be smooth a malty but just enough bite to be an IPA. It is a clean beer with no off or extremely strong stand out flavors, just nice and mellow throughout. For the strength it does not show it. Overall a solid black IPA."

"Overall a very nice, I would easily place this as my favorite black IPA to date."
"o - Overall a really nice Black IPA. Al the roasted characteristics and hops meld together nicely. The nose is a little more hoppier than the taste, which is in turn more roasted and chocolatey. Would like to have it again sometime."
""
""
"O- Really good beer, just drinking it knowing it is pure quality. After Mycenary and now this I gotta say Odell is on my radar big time."
"O-Top notch effort. Wouldn't expect anything else..."
"Overall, really enjoying this, an extremely unique beer, rich and distinct, have never had anything like it. Man I really like this brewery."

"Overall: Bottle is dated 2/16/12A. With a 9.5% ABV, this is still an easy drinking beer. Nice touch with the Colorado-grown hops. I would have expected more over-the-top hop aroma and flavor for something labeled ""double", but despite its high ABV, this beer comes across as very well-balanced and superbly drinkable. For lovers of roasted flavored dark beers with a bit of a hidden kick."
"Overall, enjoyable but lacking in depth. One sided, not balanced."
""
""
"Dark, coffee colored with a creamy tan head that leaves sheets of sticky film on the glass. The nose is pretty amazing, roasty coffee-like notes with toffee, mint and fruity hop aromas. Delicious and hoppy with enough roastiness to separate it from regular DIPA flavors. Chicory, leafy hop flavors and plenty of malty beefiness to back it up. Full bodied and creamy with no noticeable alcohol heat and a touch of chalkiness in the finish. One of the best Black Ales I've tried."
""
""
"Overall an excellent DIPA that is extremely drinkable at 9.5%. Could easily have a few of these with the excellent balance between bitterness and maltiness."
"O: I'm really enjoying this brew. I don't think I could have more than one in a sitting, but I'd seek it out at a bar if I were in the mood."
"For the style, I don't think it stands up to it's counterparts on the West Coast. Yet, it's a style that lacks concrete ground rules, so difference of opinion should be vast. For me, I just don't think the flavor is as perfected as it could be from a quality brewery like Odell. A bit too messy IMO."
"O- For a style that I am extremely apprehensive towards, this is a winner, no doubt!!"
"This pretty darn good, but very dangerous. It goes down remarkable easily."
""
"Opaque black body with crimson hues on the edges. Thin light brown head leaves a nice amount of lace. Great aroma of pine cones, hop resin and citric juices mixed with thick black,chocolatey, smoky malts. Great flavor to this Double Black IPA. First of all, wouldn't guess this is 9.5%. Alcohol is very nicely hidden. Flavors run the gamut...chocolatey maltiness, hop resin and tropical fruit tones, and a nice rounded bitterness (both hop and roasted malt blend of bitterness). This is quite good. Wouldn't expect much less from this quality brewery."
""
"Overall: This is a very good representation of the style. The flavors blend quite well and the alcohol isn't very obvious. I would definitely have another."
"O- Its easy drinking especially for being 9.5% abv, the hoppy characteristics balanced out with the roasted notes come together nicely. Not amazing but enjoyable"
"I really like everything about this beer, except for the taste. It's just too much bitter and char and too little anything else. But the look, the feel, the smell are all so good! Is this really 9.5%? Yikes. Better stop at one. Not sure whether I want another one, anyway."
"Odell is serious when the said ""Double", the hops are amped with a level of alcohol is tells you that you better be sipping and of course the malt to back everything up is just enough. I really love where Odell is taking this style."
""
"Everything about this beer gets better as it warms. Give it time and your patience will pay off!"
"O - First of all, this beer is dangerous. Has 9.5% abv, but drinks like 6% - proceed cautiously. It's also supremely drinkable; the bitterness is almost too low with very little aftertaste. At the risk of Ding rolling over in his early BA grave, this is sessionable."
""
"O: This beer has some good darker notes but its mostly about the hops...dank, astringent, hoppy...and good."
"Medium mouthfeel that tends to finish thicker than it begins. Another good brew from Odell."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid black ale from Odell. The flavors are bold, but not fatigue-inducing. This, along with the hidden abv could be dangerous, as I could easily have 2-3 of these."
"O: Not my favorite black IPA. Not bad by any means, just wasn't doing much for me. ABV is pretty well hidden though. But I don't think I would drink this again."
""
"O - This beer is like riding a roller coaster. First it's malty, then it's hoppy, then it's malty again. I love it. Like a stout and IPA rolled into one. The 9.5 abv is not apparent. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Another great brew from Odell."
""
""
"Pours a nice deep dark brown, some wispy head that fades to a scattering of clouds on the surface. Smells like roast and citrus in harmony, with a bit of pine. The taste is not a balance, citrus forward with a bitter backbone that enhances the bitters in the roast. Roast flavor is mild, subdued, abd overall this seems to disappear from the palate with a wink. Mouth is right, and this drinks easy, just lacking in the lasting department."
"Overall - a really balanced Black IPA but imo not big enough to boast double in the title. None the less this is a very solid beer and a great example of the style."
""
"Overall this is a well balanced and drinkable, strong, Black Ale. It lacks the complexity and sheer amount of flavor for me to justify it being a ""Double", but it is damn smooth for the level of flavor and alcohol. A solid example of the style. Cheers!"
""
"O- I love this beer. so happy odell put this into four packs this year. you would never know this beer is 9.5% ABV by drinking it! possibly deadly in the wrong hands (mine included lol)"

"Overall – A decent black ale, though not my first choice. Glad I was able to try it."
"O - Glad I picked some up, but it's gonna be hard to pass up their other offerings for this."
"D/O: This high-test black IPA from O'Dell's is tolerable but not really noteworthy.Hops are one-note pine delivered at the starting gun, while rampant acidity represents the single greatest detriment. In a field of hoppy offerings from this brewery, it would be difficult to return to this one any time soon--the IPA and (especially) Myrcenary are both so much better."
""

""
"Overall a little too much on the sweet side for a black IPA. Plenty of chocolate sweetness."
"Strange Black IPA, drinks more like a slightly hoppy big porter."

"nice dark coloration which glows a deep brown on the edges when held to light...light toffee one finger head - smell is lightly roasty and nutty, but you have to work your sniffer pretty hard to discern anything - flavors of sweetness, bitterness, hops, and roasted malt are well balanced - mouthfeel is a bit light and lacks some of that enamel ripping hoppiness that I like, but not too light - overall, a solid brew...this is a tought style to nail, but when done right, can be a beautiful thing. an excellent offering from Odell!"
"4/4.5/4/4/4.5"
"This could very well be my favorite beer for the style. Tons of flavor from hops to malt. A nice balance of both in fact. Great beer."
"O-tasty double very fresh loads of hops and malts"
"12oz bottle from a four-pack that cost $10.49. Black color, mocha head, looks good. Smell is hoppy citrus but I was disappointed after hearing this compared to Pliny (lies). Flavor is decently hoppy but again not on the level of Stone 15th. The roast flavor really conflicted with the citrus, like oranges dunked in bitter coffee. I would have preferred chocolate covered oranges but oh we'll. Still, this is a decent beer and a much better value than when it was in 750's."
"Chewy smooth body. Nice carbonaton with the alcohol very well hidden behind very solid flavors. No complaints with this one for me. Odell keeps em' coming."
"mouthfeel - bitterness sticks around a bit which is funny cause it didnt seem bitter upfront. sugary and bitter, eh. good body and great carbonation...this is also really fresh."
"O-A seriously worthwhile ABA/Black DIPA.I will definitely be purchasing more."
"O/D - A good BIPA. I think its a bit of a IPA that just happens to be black colored, but I certainly see the aim of trying to bring in more roast balance. Well worth a shot."
"I like this beer alot. I wouldn't want more than one a night, but it's tasty. I was completely shocked to see this was 9.5 % alcohol. This style of beer still kind of eludes me, but it's growing on me - many thanks to this brew."
"O: Great great beer by some really great brewers up at Odell. I had this one on tap a couple weeks ago and I gotta say it's almost as good from a bottle. Love that these came in 4 packs his year, gonna buy a lot of it."
"pours an obsidian black, shiny almost, and solid, with a 2 inch creamy head. smells like huge hops, and rich slow roasted chocolate malts. sensational presentation, same as all the others in odell's 4 pack series. taste is immediately hoppy and strong, imperial in nature. the ""black"" part kicks in in the middle, smoothing out the bitter hops with a certain patience that really accentuates the local colorado hops. seasonally appropriate and fairly crisp in the finish, this is a really exceptional beer. that is becoming a pattern for odell. huge abv makes this 4 pack a really nice warm buzz!"
"Cheers"
"8.7/10"
"This is one solid Black IPA and very Odell! Yum!"
"The Mountain Standard from Odell's was a nice treat...brought back from Colorado by a good friend. The beer is good...has a complex, creamy flavor, and, for the style, does a great job."
"Pours dark brown, almost opaque, one finger tan head, no visible carbonation due to hue, minimal lacing. There's not much going on in the nose, waited for the brew to warm up when it took on a mild roast and grassy note character, some vanilla notes from the barrel aging. Pretty smooth, some mild bitterness once it warmed, floral and grassy hops, I picked up some caramel, fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel a bit on the thin side, good effervescence,alcohol is still pretty prominent, sticky. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed, I'd been setting on this for a couple of months which may have led to the hops fading a bit. But we ended up doing a side by side with Turmoil, and this beer ended up far short of that world class CDA. Worth a try, but at this price point I won't be buying another."
"Drink- A very good brown ale albeit a little off from center of the style. Hoppy, soft, bubbly. If I didnt have to trade for it, I would get it again."
"The alcohol loweres the drinkability. MST is exactly what it claims to be, a hoppy, dark beer with a high ABV."
"Overall a great example of the style and a nice way to start off the day!"
"Consumed during Hobo Tasting #4 with mikesgroove (as always) at RJ Rockers Brewery during a Thursday Taste & Tour session. Massive thanks goes out to jmkratt for sending me this bottle! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight roasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Probably the standout of Hobo Tasting #4 in my opinion (not sure about what Mike thinks). Had a great balanced flavor going on here as well as a great aroma to back it up. We even let the owner/brewmaster of RJ Rockers sample a little bit of this one and he agreed that it was a damn fine beer. This one had all the citrus I could ask for in an IPA as well as the roastiness you would get in a nice Porter. Not much more you can ask for in my opinion. This was probably one of the best examples of a Black IPA (Black Ale, whatever...) that I have had to-date. An absolute must try for anyone, fan of the style or not."
"D - Average beer, average drinkability, alcohol does come through a little bit, wouldn't drink again."
"D: A nice hopped up brown ale here. Maybe a bit too strong to drink that much of, but it tasted quite good."
"While this has a slight hint of warmth to it, it certainly drinks a lot easier than 8.50%abv should drink. It's also filled with flavors that compliment each other very well, making it a fairly easy drinker."
"D: drank good but was just a decent brown ale gotta say it was pretty smooth though."
"Gorgeous beer! Meringue-like creamy head, beautiful lace, and deep mahogany color. Nose is a delight with some enticing chocolate, mixed fruit, and soft herbal notes. On the palate there's a well orchestrated balance of roasty and hoppy flavors, with the citrus hops carrying into the finish nicely."
"Not a big fan, I'd pass in the future."
"D - I finished my pour, but I wasn't all that impressed with this one. It's a decent Black DIPA that isn't as palate-raping as Sublimely Self-Righteous, and doesn't have the unpleasant burnt malt quality of Iniquity. I'd try it again if fresh on-tap, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"Drinkability is near perfect, the balance of flavors and the satisfaction from the fullness is amazing. ABV is very well hidden but is making its presence known with each sip. Part of ths single serve series, it is very pricey but i am glad i gave it a try!"
"I drank the first glass pretty fresh out of the fridge, I should of let it warm a little, because the second glass was amazing."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a massive tan head of at least 3 fingers that is very slow to recede. The head is a little annoying as I can't take a sip for quite a while. Head leaves lace as it settles. Hoppy aroma of slight citrus with a little hint of booze. Medium mouthfeel. The hops have a decent profile from start to finish. I'm surprised how present the alcohol is in this. Some roast as well. Decent flavors."
"Close your eyes and drink it, very drinkable, hides the alcohol extremely well. Got this from koufax21 for xmas, a great gift indeed."
"D: This is why I drink beer. Though they are hands down my favorite brewery, Odell has really outdone themselves with this one. I've never tasted anything like it and yet it is unbelievably drinkable. I'm just sad that it's over."
"The drinkability could be higher, but I paid $13.65, which is just a lot higher than comparable beers."
"D-For the ABV the drinkability is unbelievable. This is a great beer that I could enjoy a few of in a sitting."
"Black pour with a big, foamy, white head. There's lots of floral and citrusy hops with a touch of pine. The roasted malts add a bit of chocolate and roast but without the usual chalkiness that I don't like in most black IPA's. The body is creamy, medium-full with soft carbonation."
"D: Simply a tremendous brew and hands down my favorite DBIPA. Seek it out! Very interesting and good complexity. Very drinkable (esp for ABV). Wish I had another bottle."
"Quite a bit of carbonation, pretty smooth, but as mentioned a bit fuller than other so-called Black IPAs. I enjoyed the attenuation, less so the light touch used with the hop cones. No matter; still a fine ale."
"Overall- Very outstanding. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone. Rich, complex, balanced and easy on lots of palates."
"Drinkability: Wo. It's easy drink and very enjoyable. Hardly notice the high ABV..until it's too late to turn back."
"D: Pretty strong alcohol presence; this beer is good but it's a bit too much at times"
"Drinkability - This is one of the better black ipa's I have tried, and could drink a few of these. About as good as a black dipa gets."
"D: Good hop and malt character; suggest warming to mid 40's. ABV a bit daunting."
"Flavor is well integrated too, the fresh hoppiness takes centerstage, dried orange rind citrus and pine. Medium bodied, feels like a porter, with the hop content of a balanced IPA. Some malt complexity lends notes of tobacco leaf and dry roast coffee. Supple feel, despite the initial foaminess, the carbonation was fine. Substantial and a nice sipper. Good stuff..."
"Drinkability: Delicious - great melding of Porter and IPA, imperialized. Would love to have this again - I split the 750 and was jealous of the other 375."
"Shared by a kind soul at a Christmas party last night, and enjoyed by me very much. Poured a deep black color, with a good light brown head. Aromas of grapefruit, floral hops and roasted malt. Medium bodied, the roasted malt and citrusy hops work very well together here. A very nice beer."
"D- A good offering, if it were less expensive ($15 is a little steep) I would gladly pick up another."
"D - This is really good. One of the best black IPAs that I've had so far."
"Drinkability? For the abv, I'm finding it very easy to drink. One bottle at a sitting. A very nice brew by Odell! I'll buy more."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, this is one for the hopheads!"
"D-- Not a hop bomb at all, quite different. Really liked how it started as chocolate and then went to IPA flavors. Thought the nose could be better though, or bigger. Got a bit sour in the end but very enjoyable and excellent hidden ABV."
"Very drinkable, insanely drinkable is maybe more an appropriate description actually. Terrific beer"
"As soon as I saw this I wondered what ""double black"" implied and I found my answer as soon as I started to pour this one. Pours impressively black for the style, looks more like an RIS, with some dark garnet tones around the edges when held up to the light. Pour produces a HUGE, foamy, tan head that recedes slowly and leaves a wall of lacing down the side of the glass. Nose is surprising considering how it looks as there's a potent citrusy, resiny, hop aroma front and center with some roasty maltiness in the background. Taste is equally surprising. Definitely as there are plenty of pine and citrus hop flavors with a hint of mint as well. The roasted malts hang out in the background to provide some pleasant balance to a very hop-centric brew. Mouthfeel again proves that looks can be deceiving. Clean crisp finish and nicely carbonated. I actually expected this to be a bit overcarbonated given the crazy head on this one. Incredibally easy drinking for 9.5%. Really my only complaint with this is it is a bit on the pricey side. However, I decided to treat myself with this one and I am glad I did as it went perfectly with a Thanksgiving feast."
"Darn good stuff, grab one if you can."
"D - Much too easy for the ABV! I really must buy more of this before it's gone. I really like that this style is coming up in popularity. I'm really enjoying it!"
"Overall, a very solid, well balanced, brew. Nothing over the top, but very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden but the warming sneaks up on you."
"Edit: now available in 4 packs and much more reasonably priced."
"My rating is for a fresh bottle - and FYI, I wouldn't hang on to this one for too long."
"Solid bubbly head with a deep brown color. Heavy carbonation, reminded me of a Belgium when poured. Heavy malt presence, including some fig, chocolate, and bready flavors. Alcohol is very apparent, even though it has a fairly low abv. There is a citrus hop flavor, but it seems to me that perhaps the hoppiness has faded somewhat, resulting in malt-driven flavor. Solid Brown ale."
"D: A so so brew, nothing too special for the limited format and price."
"Very good sipper and indulger. This beer was awesome squandering to just myself over almost and hour and a half."
"D. This is definitely drinkable. The nose is of the best hop aromas I have smelled in a while. The flavor was well balanced and good. This is an interesting brown ale, and definitely the best brown I have had so far."
"Poured into a chalice a dark brown color, nice carbonation, HUGE foamy three-finger plus off-white head, with tons of thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, some toffee notes, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some toffee/caramel notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty ABA, worth checking out."
"I would prefer this to be a bit less malty, but the balance was dead on. The hop and malt melded nicely making this a very drinkable beer. It was like drinking a big brown ale."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - nice beer, but probably a bit over priced. Odell does need to do something about the corks they use, they are consistently a pain."
"Pours a hazy, brown color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of floral hops, sweet malt, slight alcohol, dark citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Black Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, citrus, yeast, hint of roasted malt, and slight dough. Overall, good appearance, great aroma, good body, and good blend."
"Overall - Great balance of malts and hops."
"My second pour nets me almost three-fingers of beer, but at the expense of having the beer foam over the sides of my glass (luckily the sink was nearby). When drunk quickly after pouring the beer it is excessively foamy and the texture manages to accentuate some hot alcohol notes as well. This beer has some potential, and I really like the idea of Colorado grown hops, but the execution comes off a touch more lackluster than I was hoping. This is certainly by no means bad, in fact it is quite drinkable, it just needs a little work."
"Pours a deep ruby red... or mahogany as the label calls it, with a huge 2 finger light tan head. Head recedes but leaves excellent lacing. A huge sweet citrus aroma conflicts with the dark appearance of the beer, but smells delicious. I love the cascade and chinook hops, and come out beautifully in the nose of this. The aroma is so strong, that I am surprised by the flavor, very much in line with the aroma, but not as intense as it had suggested. Luckily the malt backbone is strong enough for the intense usage of hops, it makes the beer taste like a citrus candy! There is little complexity there beyond the hops, so I would say this one is best as fresh as possible. This beer rests a bit tart in your mouth, and this tartness impacts its drinkability. In the end, another uniquely hopped up style from Odell, much like the India Barleywine and Red Ale. I like the hops they use, so its another winner for me."
"Very well balanced and clean on the palate. Earthy molasses and sweet caramel, a touch of vanilla, and a nice bouquet of hops (citrus, resin, leaves). Full bodied and moderately firm, with a lasting finish. A clean, well-made, tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel is a lot thicker than what I was expecting. Very chewy texture, like a melting toffee. Carbonation is mild in the mouthfeel compared to the visible activity. Must be the heavier body keeping the bubbles checked. Very interesting beer that defies category."
"I don't know how I would categorize this beer except that it's got a lot of hops in it. The underlying beer is just hefty enough to support the hops, but I doubt it's big enough to stand up to time. I'd say drink this one fresh and enjoy the hops, but don't expect a ton of complexity."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Pretty easy to drink, but not nearly as exciting as I'd hoped for. Decent flavors, and fair drinkability. A little disappointing though. Definitely not a $16 beer, and definitely not a beer to age, I don't know why this is caged and corked. Would make a much better six pack beer. Overall a decent beer. Just not quite at that next level."
"D - A nicely done beer with good flavor, balance, and mouthfeel. Goes a bit off the beaten path style wise. The only real drawback is the price-tag, which does seem a bit steep. Worth a try though."
"D=good feel, and taste, good even tasting beer."
"A deep chestnut color in the pour. Asked the gentlemen pouring (at Wynkoop private pouring) what style this might be he said probably a brown IPA. Ok, I'm not a huge fan of nailing down the style, but as a reviewer it's hard to mark. Head was fluffy and white, good retention. A nice whaff of floral hops in the nose undercut a bit by some caramel maltiness. First sip is crisp, floral. A nice malt backbone, caramel and sticky bread. Malty finish. Residual hops gives a clean overtone. This is a good beer. Not sure why it's corked. Not sure if this will stand up to any aging."
