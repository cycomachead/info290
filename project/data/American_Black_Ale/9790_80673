As the beer warmed up, the foretaste seemed more and more ""stouty"" while the aftertaste developed a hoppier tone. Nice roasted malts up front. Smooth on the tongue. And very pleasant hops in the gullet. Don't confuse this with an Imperial Black but do give it a try... just let it sit a while before you make up your mind.","TheRaven","Oct 21, 2014"

3.96,2.9,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability: American Black Ales are all over the place on style, and I've had some very hoppy American stouts cross over into this flavor range that I get with this. In fact, if someone hadn't told me this was an ABA, I would have thought it was a hoppy stout. All that being said, good appearance, flavor and mouthfeel with this beer and I could easily have another one although at that point I could kiss the rest of my evening away for any sort of productivity. Part of me wondered if the hops should have been stronger, and yet if they were too strong I think the two flavors of hops and malts would have been in conflict, so I think this one was just right, even if the two flavors were simple and deep in flavor. Sometimes too much complexity becomes a muddled mess - so the lack of complexity I think makes for a better beer. I'll have to revisit this beer sometime.","damndirtyape","Jul 12, 2014"

Flavors are roast forward, with mocha notes throughout, creamy highlights, and a solid, dry, bitter backbone. Easy to drink. Light, smooth, crisp body.

3.71,-3.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall, this is a reasonably drinkable beer. However, I must confess to being irritated by two things. One, the lack of hops in a beer called ""hoppy"" Bunny (I guess ""Malty"" Bunny wouldn't sell as well) Also, and this isn't just Duck Rabbit, I'm beginning to wonder if Black IPA's are worthwhile. There are certainly tons of better IPA's out there, and tons of better Porters/Stouts. If you want to combine the two, both elements need to come through. This just doesn't cut it. It's more of a porter/stout. Not unpleasant, just not as advertised.","MikeWard","Aug 07, 2013"

The overall enjoyment of this is good, but I am not exactly pleased with the hop level. I think for this brewery the focus is expected to be on dark malt however for this style and with a name like 'hoppy bunny' I expect more hop flavor and aroma, I would probably pass unless I was in the mood for a robust porter.","Slatetank","Jul 21, 2013"

Battle of hops and malts in the aroma, the hops bringing in citrus and pine elements, with a defined dark chocolate roast on the malt side. The roasty malts come out first on the palate for sure, with a dark chocolate taste that is actually quite smooth and sweet; mid-palate bringing in grapefruit zest and orange blossom that mixed quite well with the chocolate malts; lesser notes of coffee and pumpernickel with a hint of indistinct spice. Medium body, and quite enjoyable overall. I'd get it again.","Rifugium","Jul 08, 2012"

This is a smooth, medium bodied beer that could pass as an American stout or porter. It's plenty hoppy, but there isn't a clean upfront blast of hop oils to separate this beer from the other dark ales.","tempest","0"

4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Easily over two fingers of dark brown foam, good mixture of bubble sizes which causes some dimpling, takes some time sizzling down to the surface, solid ring of lacing around most of the glass, tenacious grip. The liquid is black and opaque but not quite so dense that you can’t see the tiny bubbles rise, thin ring of orange at the glass bottom. Real roasty, toasty nose of cocoa powder, ground coffee, vanilla bean, oats and unprocessed grains, the interplay between malts and the hoppier pine, white citrus notes quite pleasing, really stiffens in your nostrils without seeming heavy, very longlasting. Medium-bodied plus, carbonation at first gives it a fluffy mouth feel, however, overall dryness wins out. Licorice, more of that mocha to cocoa powder and roasted coffee, nutty at turns. The orange to grapefruit citrus has a harder time finding its voice here. More floral than grassy, hops add more texture than flavor. Minor notes of peach, cherry, black grape fruit. Smoky like a wood grill. There’s a lot of energy here which may now and then mask some of its complexity. Real intense, need a glass of water to rinse the flavors out.","farrago","Jun 11, 2012"

3.7,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 08/12 notched on the side. Pours a deep black with an inch-thick mocha head. Nose is sharp with pine needles, mild citrus, and a semi-sweet roasted char. Smooth hefty body. Creamy finish. The hops in this one add a pleasant bitterness, but they fall a bit short on the flavor. They taste muted and lacking in juicy freshness. The roasted aspect comes forward more, adding a warming coffee-like finish. This is a good beer, but not my favorite of the style for sure.","Onenote81","Jun 07, 2012"

3.9,1.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Black with a line of chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass and a hefty, persistent tan head of foam. Fresh hoppy aromas over a nice roasty base of dark malt. Lime, grass, pine, chocolate, and coffee along with a slight buttery note that actually somehow seems to tie the malts and hops together. While I would say the aroma is ever-so-slightly hop-forward, the flavor is certainly more aggressive with the roasted malts. That's not to say the hops aren't there - they are - but in a more leafy/earthy/oily sort of way, leaving a trail of bitterness behind. The roast and bitter qualities make for a pretty astringent beer. Chocolate, light smoke, pine resin, fruit. I wish the malty flavors cut through the brashness a little more, but maybe it will all smooth out with future batches. Hoppier as it warms. Medium bodied and actually quite smooth and almost chewy before assaulting the palate. I'll be getting this again.","wedge","May 27, 2012"
