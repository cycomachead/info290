All roasted malt and little to nothing else. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and smooth and creamy. The flavor is much better than the nose with some hops, chocolate, coffee, and dried fruit added to the roasted malt character. It is still quite sweet for the style. I'm not sure if I just have a bottle that is slightly past its prime or if this is what the brewer was going for. It is far maltier than most of the American black ales I've had; more reminiscent of a dopplebock or a belgian dark ale. I'd really like to try a bottle of this that I knew was fresh to see if this was the intention or just a victim of time. Good none the less.","lochef81","May 06, 2014"

The pepper and alcohol were the first things to come to mind, but it's not as if they dominated the taste. I couldn't quite place much more. I noticed a sweet vanilla hint in the smell, and it seems like there was a grape taste present. Of course, I didn't want to get totally lost in figuring out what the smells and tastes were and forget to enjoy it. The sum of the parts make this a great brew.

Nose is muted dark fruits, citrus hops and roasted malt that’s a little burnt. The forward hop nose is contrast to the dark color. As it warms the malt comes forward even more, a little coffee, more earthy hops and slightly boozy. First taste is a surprise. I expected very sweet but what I got was smooth, burned toast and bitter. The chocolate comes out a little and the alcohol is warming. It finishes big and heavy, bittersweet and smoky.

I should have had this a little fresher, but it should hold up well given the thick malts and high ABV. However, the earthy flavors are a plus here, and it's all owed to the dank yet vibrant hop profile. Can't wait to try more beers from these guys!","magictacosinus","May 16, 2013"

4.73,14.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a deep, dark color of charred wood and allowing just the faintest amount of light through its belly. The head is big, two to three fingers high and cloud-like. There is lacing all over the glass as the beer disappears. The nose is a huge citrus hop blossom. There are all the usual offenders of bright oranges, grapefruit, lime and citrus zest. The black malts impart the very faintest of a Hersey chocolate bar, but gives much ground to the dry hop additions. The taste is incredibly smooth. The hops take all of the glory of this show and have all the fresh orange zest, fresh oranges...just a lot of orange flavor all over the place. There is a good bitter profile to the beer, but in no way astringent or overbearing. The malt gives good backbone to the beer and the creamy and roasty characteristics of a good black malt without any of the sometimes bitter component that comes across unnatural to some black IPAs. The mouthfeel shows none of the 9% abv and has good body. My only complaint would be a little bit of a syrupy feel at times. Notwithstanding, this beer is a fabulous black IPA that really features the late hop additions and pulls off a wonderfully balanced beer.","estlinska","May 11, 2013"

The color is a rich brown color, very deep, with a thin tan head. The aroma is intense...brown sugar, molasses, burnt grain husks, toasted bread crust, malt, and booze. Not much hop aroma, although there is a bitterness and and a hop bite in the taste. Smooth and warming. Some fruit in the flavor. Lingering, boozy sensation on the tongue. Balanced, drinkable, dangerous, and brilliant.","Suds","Nov 18, 2012"

Taste is hops at first, but the expected bitter finish is obliterated by malt and sweet chocolate. Finishes wet and sweet and delicious. Alcohol is hidden entirely by the sweetness, as is the hop bitterness that would normally come at the end of a beer that smells like this one. Mouthfeel is creamy without being too heavy. Overall, this beer is a couple different styles, and no style at all. A delicious abomination, as many have said.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Nov 14, 2012"

But this beer reminded me of some great IPAs that can feature a great malt bill inside a hoppy beer. Malt stood up in the smell, in the flavor and in it's mouthfeel. In its flavor it might have been a little to malt forward. Little bit of sweetness was a negative but all around a cool black IPA and an imperial one at that.","Jparker37","Nov 05, 2012"

Not a bad beer by any means, and probably above average, but if I'm spending $7 on a bomber I want superb taste with complexity and balance... and I didn't feel I got that with this one... also, too much of a boozy aftertaste, even for the high ABV.","oriolesfan4","Aug 06, 2012"

This dance could have gone so wrong in so many ways, but it works.

Pours fairly clear very dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, dark chocolate, roasted malt, herbal, orange, biscuit, floral, pine, light coffee, and earthiness. Some really nice and well balanced aromas here, with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, dark chocolate, roasted malt, biscuit, floral, pine, light coffee, orange, toast, and earthy spiciness. Moderate amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, citrus, roasted malt, pine, light coffee, and toasted biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, with plenty of roasted malt sweetness balancing out the hops perfectly. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic black IPA. Plenty of roasted malt sweetness balancing out the hop flavors; which is what I really like in the style. Very smooth and easy to sip on.","superspak","May 13, 2012"

Dark caramel malt, toasty wood, tobacco, and a smooth booziness hits the nostrils first...orange and citrus blossom hoppiness meets some pine and light lemon. The flavor is good balance between dark malts and sticky hops. Chocolate, spruce, sweet black tea, raisin, and some trailing citrus and mint. Not quite full bodied, but creamy and fairly well carbonated. Pretty good all around, the hops are still tasty and the balance is nice, but something makes me question the freshness of this bottle. It should be fresh, considering it came from a fairly new store, but I detect a certain "aged" quality. Worthy of a revisit in the near future...","wedge","Dec 06, 2011"

4.33,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Well not quite black but close. A dark clear cola with a dark off white head that does not want to go away. Scads of lace and just a joy to behold. Nose is full of roasted grains. Light chocolate and coffee notes waft back and forth with a lovely caramel sweetness. This is so good. Taste is much like the nose with a brown bread malt core that envelopes a yeasty fruitiness bringing forth some faint plum and figs. No trace of the alcohol anywhere. Wow. Finish is crisp with a good earthy hops that has a firm but mild grapefruit bitterness. Feel is supple and medium-ish with a touch of light syrup. Carbonation is lightly creamy and super fine. This stuff goes down like a lager and is so delicious that you need a plate of good food too keep you from getting in trouble. A stupendous beer.","scootny","Nov 09, 2011"

But the hops are very subdued and someone looking for a more hopped up black ale may be disappointed. I like it and think it's really good.","sprucetip","Oct 30, 2011"
3.9,-5.6,4,4,4,3,4,"O: It really is the antithesis of Unearthly. This beer is a complete mess, but in a good way. It's even weirder than other Black IPAs I've had. It's not as well balanced, yet it's still enjoyable. It's really hard to grade this brew. Technically it isn't a well done beer, but I like it.

It is notably similar to Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous ale, a beer that arguably founded the imperial black IPA sub-style.","beagle75","Oct 12, 2011"
4.05,-1.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a super dark black into my snifter glass. Decent carbonation, and excellent lacing. A little thinner looking than I would expect for the style, but the color is right on. Head was half a finger cocoa in color- it quickly disappears. Nose is really nice, bordering on fantastic. The 'C' hops are here, as well as malt, grapefruit, and caramel. Very smooth and balanced nose. Taste is really nice as well- nice malt/hops/caramel/chocolate/fruit vibe. Definitely balanced and a smooth, easy drinker. The feel on this beer is excellent- very creamy, smooth and somewhat dry. Just about perfect for the style. The 9% ABV is completely absent from this beer as well- I'm not sure where they hid it, but I don't even get a whiff or taste of alcohol at all. Totally stealth. Overall, this is a nice brew that deserves a pick up if you haven't had it. I enjoyed it- Cheers.","jayhawk73","Oct 09, 2011"

These beers are sure to please the maltier crowd just as much as the hop-heads. The balance on this beer in incredible, every ingredient is used just above its status quo.

3.83,-7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Iniquity pours pitch black with two fingers of beige foam on top. Head recedes leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee and a bit of chocolate. Taste follows with big roasted coffee notes up front. Coffee is followed by a sweet malt backbone and a mild hoppy bitterness. The finish is dry and roasty, with a lingering bitterness which is quite nice. Feel is thick and chewy with a medium to low level of carbonation. Alcohol is exceedingly well hidden making the beer extremely drinkable. Overall, Iniquity is a very solid offering from Southern Tier in the somewhat ambiguous American Black Ale style. I'd say it nearly qualifies as a stout, given the flavor profile. Regardless of style, it is a tasty brew which I'm glad to have had the opportunity to sample.","Sideswipe","Jul 03, 2011"

The liquid is black but without the über-density of so many, allows you to get a sense for its innate clarity, this more so as there’s a wide burnt amber coloration at the glass bottom, quite attractive overall. Thick, close to dewy nose of warm milk chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, licorice, candied orange peels, cashews, all this tends to cloak the plum, cherry, apple fruit, too soft to be really roasty, the florality the most pronounced signature of any hops, nothing close to herbaceousness. Full-bodied, the carbonation builds quickly, possesses a tight enough weave to keep the mouth feel firm. Layers of chocolate, coffee, caramel, butterscotch, for all of its sweetness stays in balance, especially with a mineral water, earth element in play. More green grass and a touch of pine here, the orange citrus met equally by white grapefruit. Has a tingle to it but has a “wet” and clingy feel and does not ever take on a powdery texture. To me, drinks like a chocolate infused porter but, hey, I am unsure if anyone knows what an “American Black Ale” is supposed to taste like. Just tastes good tonight.","farrago","Jun 10, 2011"

The color was...black with creamy white head. The nose had a subtle hop and definite roast/coffee.

Flavor is rich and mouth-filling, mainly like semi-sweet chocolate with hints of smoke, molasses, caramel, toffee and licorice. Texture is slick and smooth with a subtle alcohol bite and a firm fizz so it leaves a strong, persistent tingle behind. Overall, this is more like a stout or porter than a strong ale.

The nose is in your face with a strong attack of citrus and pine hops atop a good amount of strongly-roasted malt. The taste is pretty good in its balance, though it lacks the depth and interactions of the nose. The roast comes through a bit more here. The dry roast and hop bitterness combine well in the feel. Quite a drinkable brew and one of the first Black IPAs I ever came across.","Thorpe429","Oct 26, 2010"

Mellow sweet aroma-somewhat piney and resiny. A trace of licorice in there. Very nice, caramel like sweetness with some very nice roasted grain flavors. Good dose of hops going on. The caramel/toffeeish flavors are great. really balances well against the hops. Soft, almost creamy like body to it. Really goes down easy-almost too much so!

Kind of expected some hoppy bittnerness but it actually smells closer to a stout than anything. But no, no bitterness in the nose. Hmmm tastes more like a hoppy Imperial Stout than anything. I am not really too keen on the taste. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish but mostly bitter chocolate. Second Black IPA for me. Cap'n Krunkles although I didn't care for it either was closer to IPA tastes than this. I take it I just care for the style although I say this is well done.","generalnotsew","Sep 01, 2010"
4.17,1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I poured the Iniquity into a snifter, which resulted in a rather minimal head -- just enough to patch over the top, and create a bit of subtle lacing. The brew, true to the bottle label, is nigh pitch black, though does show hints of brown and amber throughout. The scent is of sweet syrup and citrus, a bit more dessert-like than my pre-conception was for this brew. The hops come out more in the taste, however, starting with a jolt of lemon and pine, followed by a maltiness oddly reminiscent of sweet Japanese milk coffee, only for the tang of hops to rise once more again in the lingering aftertaste. Overall, the mouthfeel is appealing, though I would have appreciated a touch more carbonation to keep the brew from feeling quite so weighty upon the tongue. All in all, quite a tasty find, and I do hope to have more in the future.","sdawson","Sep 01, 2010"

A touch of vanilla. Flavor is sweet and smooth. Medium bodied with notes of brown sugar, molasses, candy, vanilla. Finishes with smoky Red Man chewing tobacco. The hops are more spicy than bitter in this brew and they are very understated until the very end. A rich beer. The complexity on the finish saves it from being too rich. A good brew.

One of the better smelling Cascadian Dark Ales (I like this name the best), as it seems to be really well balanced between the hops and the roasted malt. However, the flavour I'm not as impressed with. It just seems a bit too much like a sweet syrup then the bitter roasted flavour the smell would suggest.

Scent is a mild and subdued combinaton of dark roasted grain, faintest hints of roasted coffee and cocoa beans. A slight herbal, earthy and piney hop quality is there. Taste again brings a relatively mild and subdued quality - the roasted grains are present, backed by a noticibly unbitter presence of earhty, floral and piney hops. Tastes of dark fruit, coffee and chocolate barely touch the palate. Medium bodied, mildly carbonated.

Nice off-tan colored head that disappears quickly. Insane taste on this beer, the carbonation dances on your tongue, nice roasted malt on the attack with a slam of smoke on the back end. There is a bit of hop bittnerness to this beer, but it sneaks up on you. Sorta like your little cousin that thinks its "cute" to scare you, the hop comes up and slaps you subtly across the face.

The nose centers on a big malt hit, caramel, chocolate, roast, with flowery hops pretty well hidden by the malt, though after warming the hops became more prevalent in the nose, I'd recommend letting this beer warm up a bit before serving. The taste is chocolaty goodness up front with some roast leading to a hop-filled bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full and sticky. Warming alcohol glow cuts into drinkablility, but overall a fine tasting brew. I'll be checking out more beers from Southern Tier in the near future.","jdense","Feb 25, 2010"

A dark bread aroma hits the nose, bringing dried fruit fragrance as well. A malty scent lingers in the nose for some time. The malt attacks the palate with bread, biscuit, and touches of coffee and chocolate flavors. The taste finishes with a grassy, pine, and earthy bitterness to balance it all out. A thin feel at the front then moving towards a heavy water feel gaining weight to become more of the texture of skim milk. The back of the palate is left with a mild dryness. This beer is malt strong, that dominates the aroma and taste. The color is dark and inviting, the texture is the touch that makes it a great beer.","cameraman","Jan 09, 2010"

With the first sip I'm assaulted by loads of citrus hoppiness, but right behind there's sweet malt, chocolate, licorice and a slight smokiness. Great balance.

Roasted malt flavors with hints of coffee flow through the light body and high carbonation levels and then are overwhelmed by a sudden explosion of citrus hop bitterness. The combination of dark malts, light body, and outrageous hoppyness is new to me and to be honest, I wasn't ready for it.

Pine, citrus, dark fruit, rasins, bread, and chocolate. It seemed like each time I smelled it I found something new. The taste was much the same as the nose. Very unique style that seemed like a cross between a German Schwarzbier, a Porter and an Imperial IPA. Really complex, well balanced and surprising. Not at all what I had expected. Dark fruit, rasins, chocolate, oak, citrus, and a touch of vanilla. Chewy, but not as much as I expected. Really nice mothfeel, not so syrupy and sweet like a few of their offerings have been as of late. It's actually quite drinkable for a big beer, but that's what Southern Tier does best.

The flavor reflects the nose- espresso, mocha, with molasses notes balanced with herbal/piney west coast hops. What to call this- a black IPA, maybe? In any case, there's a very fine balancing act here- the burnt espresso and hop notes never really overshadow the sweeter aspects of the malts here- the overall effect is smooth, yet assertive. Mouthfeel is round, drying a bit in a hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol is 9% ABV, which is only apparent in the nose and as a warming sensation- share, or take it easy.

The aroma is nothing like I expected in a dark beer. They used dark malt but there is no roasted charactor to this beer. I smell chocolate, citrus, and dark fruit. You can definately taste the C-hops in this beer but bitterness stays at the moderate level. There are hints of dark fruit and dark chocolate as well. Alcohol is well hidden. Again this is nothing like a hopped up porter or stout. The malt profile is more like a Schwarzbier. Has a substantial body with a wonderful creamy, soft texture. It is a pleasure to drink.

Esters from the yeast and the black patent flavor last long on the palate. Carbonation is somewhat prickly but works with the beer, I think something softer would be even better but, hey, that's just me. This is a good beer, but for the price I'd rather be drinking Sublimely Self Righteous. No qualms with the feel, not really.

The pour yields very little head. I poured my allotment into a pint glass, but since my roommate bought the beer he got the tulip and that didn't have much head either. There's very, very little lacing on the glass as you drink it. The smell is something you wouldn't expect from the look of the beer out all. Depending on your experience with IPA's or beer in general, it can be a real mindfuck. You really, really expect a stout when looking at this, however your nose picks up a bit of grapefruit and hops. Then once you taste it, oooh. Wow. Your mouth does not expect this at all! While it may be a very straight forward IPA, cascade hops and grapefruit charactersitcs, the true joy of this comes from the look. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great tasting IPA it's just the look! Crazy. The novelty of this beer makes it a definite purchase (if you like IPA's) if you've never had it before, after that is left up to your discretion! It drinks well, the mouthfeel is thick enough and it's very drinkable - not too bitter.","FernMaster","Oct 17, 2009"

The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Light carbonation. The drinkability is very high. 9% abv? I think not! Couldn't even taste the alcohol.

This one pours a deep cola brown if held to the light other wise it looks like a huge dark black schwarzbier. Head is light beige tan and rises well above the rim of my glass, looks like bready rising, lacing is streaked evenly with each sip and makes the beer look very appetizing. Aromatics have deep herbal and pine like hop cone action going on amongst deep dark roasty malts, and a touch of mellow alcohol in the background. I'm getting some herbal mint like qualities amongst the dark bitter chocolate roasts. Flavor is fantastic, one of the dark semi sweet chocolates with a dry finish, enough malts give it a caramel roasted malt flavor but overall very hoppy expressive flavor that includes more herbal and aggressive pine hop action to the enjoyable Imperial Black Ale I have in front of me. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a touch of cloying milk chocolate syrup notes, carbonation level is carried well here nothing that makes me want to pour it out, very enjoyable in fact. Much more so than other hopped up dark ales with the higher alcohol contents. I split this with my wife, who typically enjoys darker offerings, I ended up finishing more of this than she could handle. I think the hop forward approach in this dark caught her off guard.","WVbeergeek","Aug 19, 2009"

Nose is somewhat muted, but there's that tell-tale cascade aroma sitting on top of some black malt/burnt malt aromas. Palate is crisp and flavors are complex and mingling. Crisp hoppiness up front is quickly tallywhacked black chocolate malt which is supported by a net of alpha-acid and lemon zest. Medium- to light-bodied (esp. for the style) and crisp like any great black lager (I know it's an ale). Does well as my first "Imperial Black Ale."

The aroma is good - a mix of chocolate and coffee with some lovely c-hops. The flavour is not quite as hoppy as I expected, and shows more balance than usually found in southern tier's big beers, while also dropping the booziness that they tend to have. Chocolate and lightly roast coffee mix in with some smoke before hitting a good splash of grapefruit and some pine in the finish. Simple, but good. Medium body and carbonation.

Smells like sweet hops basically, except unlike a busy malty IPA like DFH 90, they really blend together quite well. Mostly earthy, a bit of pine, not much citrus. Taste is great - the flavors compliment each other. It's like drinking a real earthy IPA, except without the huge pine sensations, the malt sweetness drives it. Almost like a real hoppy brown or some such. If you're looking for a real strong DIPA, this isn't it. If you're looking for a great balance between malt and hop, this is the target.

Imperial Blacl Ale fits better. But whatever you call it, I'm drinking it! The darkened malt and citrus-pine hops just go together so well, and despite its strength it's oh so drinkable! Additionally, althought it's not really complex (...a couple of malt notes here, some yeasty fruit there, a few shining hop flavors, and some bitterness...), it's actually very unique.

I suggest smelling/tasting this beer with your eyes closed; the color plays tricks with your mind, as you're expecting a roasty porter smell. Instead you're met with an IPAish aroma, but it seems muted. Inhale deeply, and the hops start to fill up your nose but stop short.

Poured near black with hues of chestnut at the edges of the glass when held to the light. Beige head is thin, but still respectable and it leaves a decent lacing on the glass. Aromas are of floral hops, citrusy grapefruit, and pine. A blind sniff would reveal an IPA or Imperial IPA - smells pretty good. Initial tastes are completely different than aroma - we've got roasted malts with slight hints of molasses and chocolate. These notes don't last long and are quickly taken over by a nice hop character - citrus with some pine notes, which really brings this all together to be an incredibly balanced ale.

I thought the malt profile landed it more in the neighborhood of an imperial brown ale. There's some dark roast in the flavor, but also toffee and caramel. And like a lot of imperial malty beers that try to be DIPA's in some sort, the hops don't quite dominate like they do in a regular IPA. Still, very tasty and enjoyable.

The aroma is of a light citrus hop, some pine, and a bready honey malt. Kind of a funky hop aroma, not much in roasted malt. The taste is malty sweet (honey) like a traditional DIPA, some tin like hops with perhaps a touch of pine. There is a touch of roasted malt in the end. To me has very much the DIPA flavors, malty sweet though not very hoppy. No real roasted malt characteristics like a traditional black ale. Seems the color is the only true characteristic of a black ale. A nice moderate feel with prickly carbonation; finishes sweet but not cloying, nice balancing bitter hop. Just ok for me. Not a big fan of the flavors, too much of a honey malt DIPA quality. I was looking for a nice roasted malt but only got a bit. It does drink fairly easy as there are no dominate flavors and not too sweet or bitter.","Gmann","May 22, 2009"

Big citrus aroma, tangerine and grapefruit, more rind and pith than flesh, plus a little pineapple. Malt was present, but far in the background, with some caramel and molasses. Sturdy bitterness, but really just enough to overcome the malt presence. Malty caramel and brown sugar sweetness were complemented by dried fruits (prunes, raisins) and a bit of roast. Toasty and a bit doughy with a pleasant fruitiness. Hops were in the grapefruit to pine range, but were balanced nicely with the malts. Medium+ bodied with carbonation a little less than average.

The head is formed with loose bubbles, which leave just little bits of lacing and kind of stays around for most of the drink. The smell is very nice, fruity, piney, resinous hops are sitting on top. There's a tiny bit of lemony citrus peel underneath, with a big chocolatey back. There's also a fruity, raisiny note underneath. I love the smell of dark, hoppy beers, so much complexity. The taste is really great too. There's a good hoppiness, but actually a very well hidden bitterness, with lots of flavor. I get so much orangey, lemony hop flavor, with a bit of tropical fruitiness, and some resinous flavors. Then the maltiness really kicks in, coffee, dark chocolate, a good bit of sweetness, like raisins of plums. No dryness, just very full flavor. I like it. It feels just a bit watery. At least more watery than I would've expected, very little alcohol presence (a good thing), a bit syrupy, kind of prickly carbonation. A pleasant drink. Easy to go down, and it won't hit you too fast, but I can already feel it about half way through. I would recommend it for the pure enjoyment.","taylorhamrick","May 13, 2009"

I've picked up on that common thread with the last couple of beers that ST has rolled out. It dominated the oak-aged unearthly; its as if there were leftovers from the brulee. Full flavored, the taste is a balance of extremes; big tangy grassy lemon minty hops married with an overly stated sweetness. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel almost burns from the hop and alcohol combo. That hoppy business is all up in the front and on the tip of the tongue while the back of the mouth bathes in sweetness. It gives the impression of being lighter in body. The taste and spicy burn lingers significantly. A really interesting beverage!! I hope my tastes aren't changing that drastically...i wasn't looking for that much sweetness.

The "blackness" of the beer and the "hopness" off the beer blend really nicely. Roasted and chocolate notes are form the malt base with gooey, resiny, sticky hop traits adding great character. The body is about medium or so and the carbonation is fairly restrained. VERY easy drinking. Alcohol damn near absent in this. Quite an accomplishment here.","Bighuge","Apr 20, 2009"

Let's stop calling these beers, along with Stone's 11th Anniversary Ale as a Black IPA. First off, it's black, not pale. Also there is no history in this beer that has to do with India. Therefore, we drop the I and the P. So that leaves us with Black A, or Black Ale. Strictly and American style. It perfectly fits what's a porter that's basically highly hopped. We can put this beer, Stone 11th, and Flying Dog's Gonzo Porter in this area. You can have a Black Ale and and Imperial Black Ale (which would fit this one better. Everything makes sense, I know.

Taste was pretty subdued for the style - much more sweet malt comes out than hops. None of the sweet grapefruit that you get with Unearthly or other DIPAs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium-bodied with a consistent level of background carbonation, and finished fairly cleanly. Alcohol was well-hidden for a 9% abv and went back pretty easily.

The darker malts never fully come together with the hops in the aroma, and even with the taste they don't fully complement each other. I think it's dry hopped a bit too much, resulting in the leafy and chalky aftertaste. Overall I think they need to try to marry the components together a bit better, and if they succeed they'll have a real winner.

Maybe some coffee aroma there but I am having a difficult time getting past the hops as mentioned above. The flavor, real nice! Again the hops are at the front with the coffee making a clearer appearance here than was in the nose. Never really sense an alcohol feel to this one.

3.81,-7.7,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Another new beer from Southern Tier, a dark DIPA. It would not surprise me if this becomes a popular style soon. Fast pour reveals a solid looking black beer, with about a finger of slightly tanned white heading. Despite its blackness, there seems to be a clarity about it in color if that makes any sense. Pretty decent smell. I get from it some mild chocolate, little metallic twang, and some alcohol bitterness. Taste is more centered in hop flavor, but for an Imperial IPA (Sorry, IBA) there is a very good level of balance. The dark malt manages to stay behind the hops, but still smooth things out. Alcohol is hardly present in this one. Had somebody told me it was 9% I might not have believed them. Like I said, the well hidden alcohol and balance between malt and hops both combine to make this an easy drinking ale. This is a very respectable effort from Southern Tier. I liked the fact that it was balanced as opposed to hop overkill. Please continue to experiment.","jamie2dope","Mar 31, 2009"

The beer is dark brown with red highlights along the border, some wet off-white foam that laces all over the glass. The beer smells like a strongly hopped schwarz bier, citrus + pine over a roasted malt body. The taste is really good, much better than Stone 11th in my opinion, more than just a dark IPA, this was tasty in a complex way that included roasted malts and chocolate to offset the citrus character of the hops. Very nice, this is the kind of beer that keeps me coming back to Southern Tier.","TurdFurgison","Mar 31, 2009"
4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. I can smell a lot of citrusy and piney hops. There's also some sweet malt and a bit of dark fruit noticable. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the citrus and pine hop flavors being strongest. I can also taste some bready and roasted malt, and a bit of coffee and dark chocolate, too. The malty flavors get stronger as the beer warms, but there's still a lingering hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol isn't very noticable at all. This is a very unique brew, and I liked it a lot. To me I think this brew is a great mix between a Schwarzbier, a stout and an Imperial IPA, but that's just my opinion. It really is a hard to describe beer, you just have to try it for yourself. It's one of the best beers I've had lately.","bluejacket74","Mar 28, 2009"

Iniquity is injustice or an immoral act. Perhaps suppressing that really nice citrus hop flavor is Southern Tier's poetic (in)justice. All kidding aside, Iniquity is a nice beer.
