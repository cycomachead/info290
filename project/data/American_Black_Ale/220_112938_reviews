"To much pine for me. It sure looks pretty, but it's to bitter for my taste. Grapefruit and pine, little peach. What a nice thick head. Mine only alc. 7.9% by Vol."
""
""
"Very good black ipa but very similar hop profile to other lagunitas beers so not so exciting"
""
""
""
"Overall: A big black ale with a nice balance between sweet malt and fresh citrus hops. Thick body and lovely presentation round out this delicious and very drinkable brew."
"Best black IPA I've had--amazing peach notes."
"Taste is more like the sole of a rubber shoe... But still rather sweet."
""
""
"Sweet, very hoppy grapefruit  after taste"
""
"Freakin great. Just drink it!"
"I would consider it to be a black IPA, regardless very enjoyable"

"Dark brown to almost black appearance with a big, light tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Smells of dark roasted grain, peat and earthy pine. On the palate the initial attack is roasted malts, a hint of chocolate followed by a nice lingering, piney hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy - carbonation is mild but adequate. This is without a doubt the best black ale I've had to date. This style of beer usually tastes disjointed to me but not NightTime. Lagunitas has done a great job of creating a balanced and full flavored black ale. Not to be missed."

"Overall: Cannot explain how well balanced this is. Hoppy, yet enough roast and coffee/chocolate."
""
""
""
"Wow im glad I grabbed this best black s le ive had yet dark fruit with citrus smooth with a slight tingle going down"
""
"A wonderfully dank, hop forward Black IPA with great balance. Fantastic brew!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a super solid Black IPA. super balanced and drinkable. I would defiantly buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As good as it gets. Love this brew."
""
""
""

"Poured it into a pint glass straight down and watched in pleasure. Couldn't pour it all as the head was at least 3"" even after 2-3 minutes. Still some head after several sips. And nice lacing as well. Nice hop flavor and some maltiness as well. @ 7.9% it's a easy drinking with a nice mouth feel."
"Nice smokey flavor. Would sleep with this beer if I could. Instead I drink it, like the dirty whore it is."
"Just an outstanding example of Black IPA.   Probably my favorite of this style.  This has a deep brown color, beautiful aroma of citric and tropical hops and a great flavor blend of hops and roasted malt. It's really, really good."
""
""
""
""
"As a reviewer asked: ""Is this the best American Black Ale?""  It might be."
""
""
""
"The smell had fruity hints. The taste was a little more bitter than expected. Tasted like an above average dark IPA."
""
"Overall, a great ale, big flavors and unique profile with a heavy hop aroma and stronger roast taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I was hoping this beer to be more hop heavy coming from lagunitas but it should satisfy the more malt heavy fans wanting to dip their toes in the hop pool. this beer has some hoppiness to it but it's really chained up. all bark and no bite if you say... this isn't a black ipa in my book. maybe a pale black ale or just a slight hoppier stout? not a huge roasted malt fan so my rating might be bias."
"Fruity hop Nose with slight roast. Nearly pitch black. Nice roasted yet fruity hop light pine finish. Mouthfeel is awesome. No alcohol present in this which will creep upon you. At first I get the feeling that this beer isn't aware of what it really is but then I realize it's the mixture that hits on all points and no where in here does it seem to fall flat or awkward. Excellent beer all around. I think it has one of the best mouthfeel/taste combo out there."

"this is every bit of a refreshing IPA that you could think of, except it looks dark, that's the only thing it just looks dark, tastes fantastic"
""
""
""
"Not much going for it"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, citrus and pine. Taste is also a bit hoppy, mostly citrus, some pine, roasted malts are present but in the background. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a tasty beer worth a shot."
"I wouldn't drink too many as the odd flavor combo is heavy on the palate."
""
"Extremely citrusy hops for how dark the beer is."
"O: Take this review with grain of salt; this is not my favorite style, to say the least. This offering specifically, however, seemed especially disjointed and at times outright offensive to the senses. Beneath the already questionable combination of burnt malt and piney hops (not that there's anything wrong with that...) was a note of 'chemical'. I don't think I was poisoned, but this off-flavor was prominent enough to deduct significantly from otherwise wholesome flavors. But I can say this: it was not a pussy beer. It put its flavors out there for all to see, and if you didn't like it, then to hell with you. ;)"
""
""
""
""
"Too smokey (burnt) and the flavors aren't balanced in a way that makes any sense. It looks great and smells great and is definitely interesting, but needs more malt and less smoke. Just OK."
""
""
"Overall a great representation of style. Hops and roasted malt that get better with each sip. The smokiness sets it apart from other black IPAs, but I think it gets in the way of the great hops and roasted malt. Still a great beer and worth enjoying!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I usually prefer darker heavier brews from the tap but this was absolutely delicious in a bottle."
""
""
"Overall:  Picked up a single to try since black ales can be hit or miss with me.  This is pretty good, but actually seems more like a regular IPA than black IPA.  The roasted malts don't make much of an impression.  It's fine, but don't expect a lot of roast mixed with your citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer looked and smelled magnificent. It tasted very good."
"Dark brown in color.  Hoppy nose.  The malt profile is certainly there but it is not as well-represented as it should be in this style.  The hoppy finish is the feature here - which is not really a surprise."
"piney, hoppy.  Not really my type of beer.  Sorry"
"Overall a nice beer. Plenty of flavor.  Hop forward without being too bitter which is definitely a plus for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great Black IPA.  Nothing to complain about.  Really enjoy this one."
""
""
""
"You get some grapefruit hops aroma but I caught a lot more burnt malt than a most reviewers seem to be getting.  It tastes like charred bbq, with the hops as way more of a background flavor.  Definitely smokier & darker than a lot of the reviews led me to believe, but that is just what I tasted."
""
"Had this last year in a 22 bomber. Excited that it's released in sixer this year. A very hoppy flavorful dark ale with hints of roasted chocolate.  This is up there with shorts good nite bodacious and stones subliminal self rightious."
"Very balanced BIPA. Not one of my favorite styles, but this one is well done. I'd take a regular IPA or DIPA over this any day, but this beer didn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought it was okay, just seemed a bit over roasted for my taste"
""
"Great beer, but I feel that Dubhe takes the competition by storm, as I feel Dubhe has more complexities, character and flavor to it."
"A great IPA, but right off the bat, this thing doesn't taste nearly as 'black' as it looks. This beer has a serious 'west coast' style hop profile, to use cliches, but lacks the roasted malt backbone its color and style suggest. I may be fixating on the trivia, but I guess it's just leaving me a little confused since it tastes like it's golden in color, but boasts its 'darkness.' A drinkable, enjoyable ale none the less, though. Would be happy to have this anomaly at my disposal at all times! Mouthfeel and finish are prime."
"This black IPA brings an intense hop profile that is well complemented by the dark malt. I wouldn't call it ""balanced", but I also wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone looking for something balanced. The dank, grassy, piney hops dominate in both the nose and palate. The smooth dark roasted malt is just along for the ride. Just a bit on the thin side, but far from watery. Medium carbonation suits it well. Overall, a fairly refreshing IPA with a nice hop punch. Tends to ruin the palate for subsequent beers, so I prefer this on nights where I'm only going to drink one."
""
""
"Very nice black IPA would have to say it's the best one I've had so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great black ipa! I feel in love with this beer after one bottle! Hoppy, just enough malt to balance it out! Just like to see a better dating process on their beers."
""
""
""
"An enjoyable black IPA.  realized I hadn't reviewed this one yet.  Nice blend of roasted malt and hoppy IPA.  Not a style that I will seek out, but good for a change of pace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Love it.  Pairs nicely with the melting snow and sunny weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gave it a chance because I was looking for something new. Admittedly not a fan of Lagunitas in general but it being dark prompted me to try it. It tasted a lot like everything else Lagunitas puts out."
"This is an excellent ale that is always consistent. The aroma is off the chart with hop and molasses. The mouth feel is medium heavy with good balance taste of malt and sweetness. I stock up on this whenever it is available since Lagunitas rotates this beer."
"Served in a standard pint glass, very nice head and good lacing. Definitely smell the hops but not overwhelming in the scent nor the flavor. Very well balanced for an IPA, especially a black one. While a bit thin in the mouth, almost lager like, this wasn't detrimental to it. Really enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For those special nights... Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer comes close to those beers, but does fall a little short for my palate. A little bit too roasty for me, but that's just me. Still a really good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm liking this years version better than last year.  Less sweet with more going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good dark ale.  Another winner from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
"O: Balanced, smooth dark/hoppy ale.   Well worth drinking, especially if you like IPAs and stouts.  A great brew from Lagunitas!"
""
""
""
"Flavors out of this world, with a faint reminiscence of dark lagers."

"Glass- Perfect Pint"

"really nice beer reminds me of a brown ale"

"Taste: Rich and decadent melding of roasty malts and twangy bittering hops. The pair duke it out on the palate, with neither coming out ahead. Operative word here is balanced. Tons of flavor from both sides, with chocolatey malt goodness mixing it up with lovely hoppiness. This heavy brew (at 7.9%) is so easy to drink, I could easily enjoy another right away. Delicious? You bet. A real winner here from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
"Great Black IPA! Good floral aroma, excellent color. A bit lighter feel than expected, overall great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect combination of crisp hoppy start, malty sweet and residing subtle bitterness. Excellent and will seek this out again for sure."
""
""
"Great look, fantastic hoppy smell. The taste was a little underwhelming to me in comparison to the smell, but good nonetheless. Thin mouth feel."
""
"Solid black ipa. Would buy again"
""
""
"Wasn't quite expecting the taste of this one."
""
"Bottle of night time drank."
"Good dark ale.  Complicated flavors yet smooth."
""
"Drinks more like a Black IPA than a Black Ale. Lovely hop biterness throughout. Love everything about this beer. Recently started delving into Lagunitas repertoire, and this is the best I've tasted so far."

"Mmmm, tropical fruit goodness with a slight suggestion of roast on the finish. Fantastic, especially coming in a six pack."
"This is my favorite Lagunitas Seasonal brew. Picked up a sixer last night. I've been looking forward to its release since the last time I had some was straight out of the tap in the employee lounge at the Lagunitas Chicago location (my son in law had a part time summer job there).  I'm not much of a dark beer guy but this tastes like a bold IPA with a slight sweet stout flavor. There seems to be 5 or 6 flavors going on while I drink this that I can't quite describe other than an overall heavenly taste."
""
""
"Sorta Sucks, but dark. Need to find more."
"Very flowery, very dark, very different"
"Not really similar to many other beers I've had. Was expecting more of a pungent hop but this is a mellow, smooth 71 ibu. Sweet and smoky nose. I'll definitely get this again"
"Definitely makes me want to check out more of this style.....absolutely amazing!"
""
"Creamy feel. Otherwise Ok but nothing special."
""
"O - Strong, tough hop-forward beer."
"Picked up a 6er today, limited release, my distributor had one case.  Bottled on ""42", so by Lagunitas's way of thinking this is the 42nd day of 2015, which would be within the past week+ by my estimation.  So, super fresh.  Poured into snifter.  Looks awesome - about a finger head, laces very well.  Smells like a Lagunitas beer, lots of hops in the nose.  Taste is hop forward with the roasty malts that the style needs.  I am a big fan of the black ales/IPAs and Nighttime doesn't disappoint.  It's a toss up between this and Maine's Weez as the best in style I have had."
""
"Overall, this is tasty and worth checking out."
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, long lasting, fluffy beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and toasted malt.  Body is full and tangy.  Citrusy hops dominate the palate while dark fruit, toasted malt and coffee linger in the background.  Finish is long, and dry.  I’m not a fan of the style, but this is one tasty brew."
""
""
"Tons of head and lacing. Smells of delicious grapefuity pale ale but flavor has tons of roasted malts combined with citrus. Almost like an orange flavored dark chocolate. Despite the high gravity also highly drinkable. My new favorite Lagunitas beer."
"Yummy. Perfect for a cold night."
""
"This is one of my first of the style, but really surprised at how well the subtle taste of the roasted malts blend with the grapefruit heavy flavors.  This does smell similar to Daytime, which for me is a good thing,  this is a really great brew, one that I didn't think I'd like.  Makes me want to check out more if this style."
""
"Highly drinkable and mouthfeel wise it's pretty nice. The initial citrus astringency gives way to a malt sweetness that coats the tongue nicely. I was surprised somewhat at the roast and light chocolate qualities given the initial hop bite and aroma. That said, I kind of feel like there are better options in either direction depending on what your persuasion might be, whether you stay with Lagunitas or change brands. At any rate, it's worth drinking for a change of pace."
""
""
""
"Sweet with cloying sweet finish."
""
""
""
"That said, if you like fruity, hoppy brews, this is probably a good one.  At 7.9% ABV, it's really strong compared to what it tastes like."

"As always lagunitas impresses.  Nite in a tulip,  light head, beautiful dark color.  Definitely a black ipa.  Perfect"
""
"Very solid Black Ale, If you are a fan of IPA's definitely worthy of trying. Another great beer from Lagunitas ."
"Hoppy hint of bo well balanced good finish"
"Great toasty flavor. Great for a cold day or night."
"O- Very, very nice grapefruit juice aroma. The flavour is a bit messy, but otherwise it's a very good CDA."
"O: This sets the standard for black IPAs. Probably the best of the style I've had. Really glad to see it's not a 'limited release' as my bottle states and is now a seasonal 12oz 6-pack"
""
""
"O - 4.5 - One of the best black IPAs I've ever had, HIGHLY recommended for fans of the style!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  nice piney black ale."
""
""
"O:  Good beer, a little strong for my liking, though."
""
""
""
""

"Amazing offering from Lagunitas...  I love a well done Black IPA and they have really nailed it with this....  Smoky and hoppy with a beautiful balance between the two...  Rich and creamy...  Smooth and smoky...  Pungent and hoppy..  Cool evening beer...  Loaded with flavor...  Paired with some smoky Bentons bacon and scrambled eggs filled with Gouda....  Sublime..."
""
""
"Just released, so the hops are there but most remarkable to me is the smoky kick. I don't typically like smoky beers, but this one strikes a good balance. The smokiness is detectable but not overbearing and balanced by the strong hop presence. A good, affordable beer worth sipping."
""
"The finish aftertaste was deep and very enjoyable"
""
"All around great beer smell taste very smooth"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I will absolutely pick up another 6er for $10.99 and look forward to the next time this is released!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing! My new favorite black ipa"
""
"O: Not what I expected at all...in a good way. The hop presence is surely on top and on point, but the malty subtance gives it a good backbone to ride on. Very nice balance. An early summer in a bottle. Definite buy, just don;t e tit warm up too long...which shouldn't really be a problem."
""
"All around wonderful brew, hits every sense perfectly."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice treat, but be ready for loads of flavor hitting you broadside."
""
""
"Initially drank at 38 degrees, but overtime warmed up to about 45 degrees which was very refreshing. Slightly strange sweet smell, but the taste well makes up for it. Very slight licorice overtones in the aftertaste  that reminded me of a more full bodied Goose Island Muddy. Very highly recommended"
"O - Another winner from Lagunitas! 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color with a thick light-brown head.  The beer has an earthy scent, with notable pine-like hops as well.  The taste has an immediate sharp bitterness, followed by a roasted malt flavor.  Very smooth in body....almost creamy.  The piney hops follow through in the finish.  Nice brew."
""
"O - It is a good and unique hoppy black ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Night time pours a black color with a big fluffy creamy head.  There is a strong earthy aroma, smokey, with some hop notes.  Taste is also earthy, big burnt hoppy flavors.  Big flavors, good body.  Overall its not bad, a bit too burnt with a sticky aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When poured, the color was of a very dark brown with a little tan foam with a little lace left on the side of the glass.  After pouring this dark, medium thick brew, the smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma.  The taste was a pleasant surpise that it wasn't over powering taste of bitter hops.  Nice and smooth, and a very appealing flavor and aftertaste."
""
""
"Drink it soon and enjoy what I consider to be one of the best DIPAs out there, easily up there with Sucks, Pliny and Enjoy By."
""
""
""

"A smooth, big, malty Black IPA. Brings together a solid hoppy feel with the roasted chocolate notes. Really well made. A typically robust yet easy drinking beer from Lagunitas."
""
"It's good but the bitter after taste got to me after awhile. A little too hoppy for a dark beer"
""
""
"O: with milder hop flavor than most Amer. Black IPAs, this is more of a Black APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer!"
""
"Yes this is a great beer.  Definitely comparable to the SSRA from Stone.....and perhaps a bit easier drinking.....touch more hops and less abv.  The color is nearly opaque with think ecru head that is lacing nicely.  The scent carries citrusy like hop.  The taste is evenly balanced with a mouthfeel that is fuller in body with subtle carbonation.  Great beer....nice job Lagunitas."
""
""
"Not one to ""Fear the Dark"" I picked this up on a whim.  After a bit of chilling to about 50 degrees F,  I poured a nice pint which showed a brownish red, not black but not translucent either.  One inch head lingered for quite a while and left heavy lacing.  Aroma is sweet, malty, and nutty with a bit of funk.  Taste is similar but lacking funk, the sweetness is well balanced with a bit of bitters and maltiness, some fruit qualities, although a coffee aftertaste presents.  Mouth feel starts creamy but quickly changes to a slight carbonated bite."

"Dark with delightfully contrasting light citrus. Has a surprising twang, a spicy almost-sour bend at the middle of the flavor. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a damned fine beer and a massive experience of flavors, nose and mouthfeel that combine to be greater than the sum.  I cannot recommend this one highly enough. It is a superb beer and one that everyone should experience.  I will absolutely be drinking this one again."
""
"The dudes (and dudettes) at Lagunitas come across as the coolest, chillest people in the business - and they have the portfolio to match. Night Time is just another in a long list of super approachable, crazy agreeable examples of its style (the 65 IBU and 8.2% alcohol notwithstanding). As if there was ever any uncertainty about a Laguintas product... common!"
""
""
"Dark black and stout like appearance with a big light khaki colored head that has great retention and leaves chunky lacing down the glass.  Nose is of dark chocolate, coffee, sweet orange and light pine.  Hop forward nature catches you off guard with bright citrusy hop character.  Light char notes, dark chocolate and coffee mix with the citrus by mid palate.  Finish brings a light pine touch.  Hops definetly shine and more than stand up to the malt.  Well carbonated with a medium body and a slightly off feeling chalkiness in the finish.  This isn't my favorite style, but this one is very enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Solid black IPA. Nice finish without the bitter punch in the mouth."
""
""
""

"BOD 114/14. Pours almost as dark as a stout with an exceptional head, lacing and retention. Nice nose of sweet tropical citrus (orange, pineapple), pine, chocolate/toffee and a touch of roast over a slight alcohol note. Almost light medium bodied with a just a touch of slick texture. Above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent middle and finish. The flavor profile is complex, well balanced and does a stellar job of hiding the alcohol. It begins with the sweet tropical, then flows to pine as the mild bitterness begins. The middle is where this beer excels. As the bitterness equilibrates, the coffee/toffee, roast and sweet chocolate come to the forefront in an effervescent flash. The finish is somewhat dry and leaves a nice lingering light bitterness on the tongue with a light toffee and chocolate flavored sweetness coupled with a hint of grapefruit rind tartness."
""
""
""
"The more I drink this the more I think it is sucks with some roasted hops....the more I drink it the more I love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid black ipa, nice and dry finish with a very pronounced hop character. They definitely use rye in the malt. The malt base is  flavorful and complex yet very clean and not underwhelming the prominent hop kick. Definitely just as solid as lots of other great black ipas which are double the price! My new go to, for the style!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A damn good black IPA, this was unusually dynamic as each sip was different and yet balanced at the same time. This brew hid the alcohol completely and was easy to drink, another great beer from Lagunitas that I highly recommend."

"Rating: A-"

"Poured a lighter black with a huge head. Aroma of malt and lots of hops. Tastes interesting. I get lots of hops with sweet malt and tons of pepper flavor. Not to big on the pepper flavor. This one is ok."

"Overall, an excellent beer.  I really like this one.  I have never had a black ale and this one is on the money.  I have always heard good things about lagunitas but had not tried any of their beers.  You can bet I will be trying more of their stuff after this one."
""

"Really good for putting you to sleep...har har har.  Strong flavor and bitterness, great when chilled.  It's dark and it definitely has a punch compared to lagunita's other offerings.  Malty and black, great as a night cap."

"22oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a frothy, one inch, khaki-colored head.  Nose is piney in the foreground with a slight roasted quality in the back.  Taste consistent with nose with the addition of baker's chocolate and a light, slightly medicinal bitterness lingering between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and a slight acidity.  For me, this beer didn't capitalize on the roasty/malty goodness I've come to associate with the style.  All and all, not really my thing."

"I don't know why I even go after these black IPAs...  This one pours a sleek black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises coffee, cocoa powder, grapefruit zest, and a touch of treacle.  The taste is a straight blast of cocoa- and coffee-covered grapefruit (ruby red and yellow, baby), the two factions putting on a great performance of West Side Story: what seems like fighting is actually tightly-choreographed and highly cooperative dancing.  There's also a nice underlying current of molasses throughout.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this is one of the best black IPAs I've had lately, one I might actually look forward to enjoying again at a later date.  Well done, Lagunitas."

""
""
"O: [3.50] This is a 8.2% beer but there is no taste or sense of alcohol.  The 65 IBUs gives a little bitter on the tip of the tongue - but doesn't make the beer harsh.  The smell and taste are nice.  This is not just a dark colored IPA.  There are some stout-esque characters on the finish like the hint of sweet coffee."

"Overall mixed bag and kinda meh, hard to drink this for sure, between the huge bitterness of the astringent rindy hops and the acrid roasted malt (which isn't very strong but it's there), and the phenolic booze kick in the pants, and the thin feel, those unhappy flavors way outnumber the decent ones. Nose was pretty nice though."

"O- This is a great beer. I found a bottle at fresh market for 5$ and had a feeling I needed to scoop it. I was right. I have turned into somewhat of a hop head, but this was a very refreshing outstanding brew. Why don't they ever put great beers like this in a six pack?...."

"A good strong black ale with robust flavor and inviting mouthfeel."
"22 oz bomber pours a root beer color with sufficient head and lacing. Nice pine and floral nose, with subdued roasted malt. Really like the clean biting taste of this one - a bit like a floor cleanser - but in a good way. I taste pine, apricot, dark fruits, and a light smokey backbone. Like the way this beer sticks to the back of the tongue as it goes down, begging for another sip. Overall a really nice black ale and at $4.99 a bomber (in North Texas) a real value."
""
"A very nice Black IPA. Pours a very dark brown to blackish color with a medium tan head that dies down to light pools of tan foam and great lacing. Nose of grapefruit like hops, deeply roasted grains, a earthy goodness. Nice taste profile going on here, grapefruit and citrus hops up front mingling nicely with sweet roasted malts on the back and sides. Herbal like quality with a roasted grains and syrupy sweet malts dripping down a cascade of citrus hops. It is not what I expected, nor what I was really after in a dark brew. That said, it is a hop heads delight and a foray into the darker side of ale without leaving the realm of overly hopped beers. Excellent, but still---can we tame some of the hops so I can taste something other than grapefruit citrus hops?"

"In the absence of light this has a deep, dark brown appearance. With bright light this has a deep ruby red color that darkens on the edges. Poured with a short, light beige foam that reduced to a thin cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Dank, ripe citrus hop aromas along with earthy, grainy, roasted malt and fresh, resinous pine hop notes at the end. Full bodied, smooth creamy body up front that, resinous feel through the middle, and tangy, tight, carbonation from the middle to the end. Roasted malt and tropical citrus hop flavors up front with the hop flavor expanding into the middle. Pine hop flavors are introduced in the middle overtop the sturdy roasted malt backbone and slowly expand from the middle to the end. Finished cleanly with a lingering roasted malt and bitter hop aftertaste. Complex and enjoyable."

"Appearance of very dark brown but not quite black with a nice creamy colored head. The smell was full of hops and bitter fruit like lemon and grapefruit. The taste was similar with a lot of hops making a grapefruit taste, but also a nice lingering sour taste, not bad, just like a sour pink grapefruit flavor. Very interesting. The mouthfeel was also nice as it was not overly thick like I thought it might be. Overall very good."

"O - Lagunitas delivered on this brew and then some. One of the best black IPAs out there. The bursting citrus hop flavor tastes remarkably fresh and pungent. A steal at less than $5 a bomber."
""
""
"Found a bomber for just under $5. Poured into a 16 oz. glass last night. It had about a finger and a half of head that held quite well. Right when I cracked open the bottle I could smell it. It was delicious. Since I'm still new to craft beer I usually can't pick out individual fruits that hops give off, but right away I got mangoes. The taste didn't disappoint either. The malts balanced the hops so that it was easy to drink for such a big ABV. And of course the mangoes... I honestly can't rave about this enough. To date it's probably the best beer I've had (but I'm still new to craft beer). I'm definitely gonna buy another one or two"

"O - I think this is the first beer of this style that I've had. I would have classified this as a black IIPA based on flavor/taste profile. A good balance between bitterness and sweetness, which seems to be hard to accomplish with black IPAs or similar beer styles. I'd drink this again. Prost!"
"There is an assertive dark malt and hop flavor but decently balanced with the hops lingering at the finish. It gets good grades and with good reason."
""
"O: very interesting; the hop aroma took me by surprise for a black ale and the smokiness of the flavor was also surprising since I didn't get any of that in the aroma;"
""
""
"O: Judging by this beer's appearance, you wouldn't assume that it would be packed with aromas and flavors of citrusy hops. The taste has a very nice balance between the citrus and the roasted malts that makes it almost taste like a hybrid between a typical IPA and a Black IPA. It is very easy to drink and no traces of alcohol are perceptible."

"Poured this out of a 22oz bomber into a chalice. The beer poured a nice pitch-black color with a finger-width, creamy head, providing plenty of lacing along the way. The aroma is a combo of toasted malt and piney hops. The taste follows the nose with the toasted malt character upfront followed shortly by a piney hop flavor. A resinous hop bitterness lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, but with a noticeable carbonation bite. Overall, the beer is not too complex, but is nevertheless delicious and thoroughly enjoyable. Will definitely grab this one again."

"Overall I give this fine ale, black IPA, or black ale, what have you, 4.5, with a strong, non drunk opinion. This is the first time I have had this beer, and compared to others of its caliber, like sublimely self righteous, it really does hold its own, and also stand apart in terms of drinkability and taste. This is one of lagunitas' better offerings. CHEERS!"

"Light black in color with and I can just see through it when I hold it up to light. A half inch thick tightly knit beige head sits on top. Brussels lacing.Light aroma of piney hops is present,but is definitely on the fainter end compared to other black IPAs. The flavor is strongly of piney hops and that very familiar hop flavor common to Lagunitas. The mouth is silky smooth and light considering the ABV."

"O-liked the taste of this black ale, alcohol well-integrated making this beer easy to drink"

"Black pour with a sisal cap of persistent creamy foam. Heavy lacing. Smells of grapefruit and roasted malt. Tastes of grapefruit pith, citrus rind, pine, roasted malt, chocolate. Moderately bitter. Creamy and medium bodied. Lingering bitter citrus and roast malt finish. A good classic black IPA."
""
"O - Definetly the best black IPA I've had. The flavors are very well balanced. This is another winner from Lagunitas."

"In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with this beer. It has nice dark hue with a decent tan head leaving some light lacing. The aroma is pine resin. The taste is hoppy, with the pine and citrus bouncing off each other. There is a nice weight to the body and a smooth mouthfeel. My only complaint, really, is that this isn't what I was expecting. It pretty much tastes like Latunitas IPA with a different malt bill. Which is what it is. Dialing up the ABV doesn't make it something else. Strong Ale means something, in beer terms. And this isn't it. So enjoy the beer, because it IS well made. Just know this isn't a strong ale."

"Overall: When I think Lagunitas I think lots of hops, lots of body, and perhaps a distinct strain of yeast. This beer has all that and is a great example of an American Black IPA."

"Overall: I've had a fair amount of black ipas in my day, and this is probably one of my favorites so far. Great nose and good balance between hops and dark malts in the flavor. I rarely say anything negative about Lagunitas, and this is very much the same. The only gripe I have is that it's too carbonated, but that's a small one. Great brew and highly recommended for the style. Cheers!"

"Not everyone enjoys Cascadian Darks, and I can respect that, but this is a fantastic beer. I happen to enjoy well made CDAs, and this certainly fits that bill. I encourage even those who are typically a little more skeptical of the style to give this one a try. I think Lagunitas once again demonstrated their brewing prowess with this one."

"Overall: Great black ale. Very smooth for such a hoppy brew. Recommended for all hop heads."

"O: Awesome American Dark Ale or whatever the hell the style is called. Does a stellar job of blending the best aspects of hoppy and dark. Not quite as nuanced as Wookey Jack, but it's also 30% cheaper in my area. Seriously. This bomber cost me less then 5 bucks. Such a steal. Pick this up if you find it."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""

"D: A solid rendition of the style although not particularly stand out from the rest of the pack. Surprised Lags took this long to come out with a Black IPA. Does have some nice juicy hop flavors and it is definitely hard to beat at the Lagunitas price point. Not my favorite Black IPA but will be revisiting this one over and over I am sure of it."

"O: An exceptionally solid and well made beer. Easy to drink."

"Still, I find myself enjoying it and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. If I could get it fresh all the time, it would be a go-to."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy but not sticky or oppressive. This is a pretty darn special beer. Now I wish I'd gotten more than one."
""
"O - Easily a top 3 black ipa for me. A lot of times i feel the ipa qualities are trying to be ""louder"" than the porter like qualities, that is not the case here. Wish i had this blind for the first time. Mouthfeel is amazing"
""
""
""
"O - A stellar american dark ale. Roast-forward, well balanced, complex, and delicious."

"Pours a hazy dark brown, two fingers thick creamy tan colored foam, spray of lace down the glass. Smell: light roast and brown sugar, lots of grapefruit, mildly resinous, soft papaya. Taste: grapefruit, pine, dried tropical fruit. Light roast and toffee notes in the finish. Very nice."

"Overall a wonderful beer and extension of IPA hop profiles to different malts."

"M: Perfect amount of carbonation - medium bodied, but on the lighter side especially when cold. The carbonation bubbles burst pleasantly, rather than flowed smoothly, and the experience was delightfully full of flavor explosions that clung to the inside of my mouth. So enjoyable!"
""
""
"Overall - Blindfolded you'd be very hard pressed to pick up the ""black"" characteristics of this fine black ale - I would guess this was a DIPA personally. But knowing that this is a black ale you search for the slight roast and licorice - and you find it, and rather than thinking of this as a black ale I find his to be an even more complex DIPA - just great stuff here and a must try if you find it."

"The beer poured a deep brown to black with slight ruby highlights and loads of fluffy tan head. The nose is very hop forward with grapefruit rind being the predominant aroma with slight hints of pine and mango. There was very little roast on the nose and it only revealed itself as it warmed. If I wasn’t looking at this dark as night brew I would swear it was an IPA on aroma alone. The taste followed with strong grapefruit rind and a little more of the pine and mango notes than the aroma. As it warmed the dark roasted malts came through at the end and mingled with the hops to create a beautiful bitterness on my palate. This was an outstanding Black IPA and Lagunitas handled the hops expertly."
"O: Better than expected because it wasn't overly malty or roasted. Definitely a hop bomb of a black ipa. Could have been richer, but really good overall."

"Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Somewhat creamy, smooth, and very easy to drink. A very nice American Black Ale, which I would drink again."
""
""
""
"Pours a black body with two finger head that died quick and left some sticky lace patches around glass. First thing that hits me in the aroma is wet, citric hops and then a burst roasted malts, even a little bready, with some minor chocolaty sweetness. The sweetness seems to disappear in the taste as this medium-bodied and smooth beer (slightly filling with a little breadlike note) is mostly roasted malts and citric hops. Finishes dry and a little boozy. The balance is there but it's more roasted malts and hops than anything else and not too much else in the flavor department. Not bad but just wish for a little bit more."
"Pours a very nice dark brown/black color, very nice carbonation, with a nice thick creamy one-finger light tan head, which leaves some islands and sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty with some very nice hop notes, slight licorice. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy. Medium body, with a slight dry/bitter finish, ABV hidden very well. Overall another very tasty brew from Lagunitas, well done, would recommend."
""
""
"O - Very unique and not in the bad way that beers can be unique. Very straightforward flavors of roast and hops that are well blended. Too bad all black IPAs can't be this good. Between this and Wookey Jack we have some benchmarks, but with the $4.59 pricetag for a bomber we have a winner."

"Lean and clean in its hopping – definitely of the “Black in color only” school of Black IPAs. Distinguished by its soft texture, but not sure this is doing much that, say, Black’s of Kinsale don’t do. Very nice, if not very innovative – and not as craveable as other Lagunitas beers."
"Nice head on this one, poured it into an english pub glass very slowly and the nice thin creamy head is staying consistent with every sip."

"Peach, citrus, piney aromas. Coffee, some roasted nuttiness, hops-pine flavors. A nice lingering hops bitterness. The beer screams hopz, and they are definitely there. A well balanced beer that finishes somewhat dry with slight booziness at the end. A very nice offering."

"Heavy 4 finger-head. Dark nearly pitch black. Khaki head. Smells fresh fruit, chocolate and plum. Taste is nice, effervescent pine, apricot, milk chocolate, slightly dry finish. Medium body.

"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass showed a pitch black brew with a thick tan 2 finger head, the aroma was simple and a little hops forward so it covered most anything else which was a little offsetting. With the first taste the hops jump up and show a strong dominance which last throughout the tasting, most of the roasted notes appear in the aftertaste between sips and still becomes mixed into the hops...still it has something that really works as a Black Ale...Mouthfeel is medium/Heavy...more to the point it starts Heavy and goes to Medium...hops..roasted notes..roasted hops notes. All in all I really enjoyed this brew and would grab it again if I see it."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass, with a one finger khaki head with great retention and lots of lacing. Great aroma dominated by citrus hops, light tropical and orange family fruit, lighter toasted malt. Flavor is mellow dark, lightly toasted malt, dank citrus and piney hops, cocoa, finishes with a lingering piney hop bitterness. Excellent creamy body and mouth feel. A stellar Cascadian Dark Ale, with a well selected hop mix and very sturdy, but not invasive dark toasted malt body. Lots of flavors and hard to slowly sip. I expect the best from Lagunitas and they delivered again. Very poor distribution; one of the best bottle shops in Seattle told me this wasn't bottled, only on tap. I believed that until I found this lone bottle on a shelf in a grocery store. Haven't seen or heard of a bottle before or since. Weirdly hard to find for this brewery. Glad I lucked out."

"22 oz bomber from Winco mega grocery store in S.Salem of all places. $3.49 Pours a murky ,turbid mahogany colour with a great thick, frothy sea foam head that is light tan in colour. loads of spicy, citric and resinous hop aromas. This has to one of the hoppiest aromas from a BIPA I have had!Getting a small amount of nuttiness also. Nice. The taste is more balanced with a semi-sweet coffee mellowing out the hops and a great liquorice after taste. Great mouth feel..thick and smooth yet very drinkable and no sign of the alcohol strength. Very nice BIPA but very dangerous as this drinks like something 5% alc."

"O: Good stuff. Would love to see this in 6-packs at a typically reasonable Lagunitas price point; I'd buy plenty."

"Incredible beer. If you closed your eyes and just took an initial smell and taste, you would swear this is just another Lagunitas IPA. But then, Night Time takes over with fresh hops, warm and creamy aroma and a perfect finish. Somehow you feel like you're drinking hops and a cafe latte, together. Sounds weird, tastes amazing! Everything about this beer works."

"O- love the brewery, don't care for the beer. Definitely better American black ales/black IPA's out there in my opinion."

"Overall – The brew looks and smells fantastic, but the beginning of the taste and the mouthfeel were kind of off at times. A decent brew, but really not all that outstanding overall."

"New Lagunitas brew and fortunately it doesn't take long to hit the Alberta market. Hey, we grow much of their barley (look it up). Glad we get to partake of the finished product. I have been anticipating this one and it does not disappoint. Surprisingly dark and opaque, pitch brownish black with no real color halo and a rich, creamy tan head. Massive fresh hop aroma greets the drinker, big tangerine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit (mango, pineapple) notes. Notably subdued malt aroma although one does get some roast. Shockingly bitter yet juicy at the same time, mixed citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, lime), pineapple, guava, unripe peach, marijuana resin, and carrot all join a hop flavor blitz that rides atop some instant coffee and licorice candy. There is a lot of pine here as well, wet needles and an almost ammonia-like Buckley's mixture cough syrup vibe that builds and builds but fails to entirely overpower a sweet tropical fruit leather note in the background. Strong floral hop aromas and flavors arrive late. This thing is heady and potent yet complex enough to keep one interested for the duration of an entire bomber. Moderate of body and low in carbonation to my palate, with tons of oily resins in the bitter yet fruity finish. Unique black IPA in its strong emphasis on dank and powerful resinous hops that are somehow delivered in a fashion that does not completely squash more subtle fruit and dark malt flavors. Wonderful."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/24/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with bright citrus/grassy hops and moderate roasted malt presence; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine and moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/grassy hops with moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly sticky/creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/grassy hops and moderate roasted malt flavor; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

" I've been falling more towards the Lagunitas brews and this is one more reason why."

"Overall - Really tasty. Very smooth, flavorful and easy to enjoy. This is how a black ipa should taste. Tropical fruity hops, with the malts and cocoa coffee backbone. Balance is amazing, as is the really affordable price. This is a new beer of the year candidate so far."

""
"O - Being a relatively new style, I imagine we will see more exploration in this area moving forward. While this did not impress me as much as SSR (not quite as sweet), it is a solid offering, especially for those who like hop forward efforts."
""
""
"Overall this is a great representation of the style. Hoppy up front with a great dark malt backbone that gives the brew a nice mix of Porter notes with some good strong hop kicks."
""
""
""

"Pours dark, but not opaque. Nice lacing. Nose was very strong fruits at first, but as usual, calms down fairly soon. Flavor brings mild fruit with some hop spice. The sweet edge that I find a lot of black ales have is also here. Nothing obnoxious, but it is clearly defined. I would hope that at this point in the game Lagunitas knows how to deliver I this style. And they have with this one."
"O- I'm not usually a fan of this style because most of the time they are roast first and hops second. What I've come to realize is that the key to this style is to drink them as fresh as possible. This is almost a month old and has kept it's hop character nicely. My favorite of the style has been Founders Inspired Artist and the roast in that started to take over more quickly than this one. Really happy with this beer and hope Lagunitas releases it a couple of times a year because great black IPAs are hard to find."

"Overall an excellent black IPA. I hope to see it in six packs some day."
"Overall, it is hard to express how excited we were for this beer. Lagunitas produces some of our all-time favorite hoppy beers, and as big fans of black IPAs/ales, we couldn’t hardly wait. The result is a wonderful black ale, with nearly superfluous hoppiness. At certain points, and especially with warmth, the hop profile actually reminded us somewhat of Heady, in all of the fruitiness and cloying sweetness, with bitterness only developing on the deep aftertaste. That said, there is not really much bitterness to speak of, and the beer develops and warms to fit your palate and your taste buds. The “black” part of the beer is there as well, giving smoke and a pseudo meatiness to it, helping to quell the frank sweetness it’s up against. We urge Lagunitas to make this year round, as it is premier for its style."

"O: This is just a great beer and phenomenal for the price."

"Nailed the style down. It might not be the best Black IPA I've ever had, but it might certainly be my favorite. A choice Cascadian Black Ale. Highly recommended."
"A nice black IPA but a touch on the bitter side. This is a good beer, but when it comes to black IPA's, I would rather go with Founders or Heavy Seas."

"Dark chestnut brown with a deep red tint. Translucent when held to the light. Pours with a gigantic 2-3 inch tan head that lasts and lasts; close to a 1 finger uneven head lasted most of the time I was drinking this beer with lots of rich foam sticking to the sides of the glass. Wonderful sweet, hoppy aroma that persisted and made me want to drink the contents of my glass. Smooth start with hints of grain, ever so slightly sweet progressing to a just-right hoppy flavor with a slight dry finish. I found the flavor somewhat complex, delicious and thirst-quenching. Smooth, velvety and a medium body. Overall I loved this beer. I could drink this over and over."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm happy I've still got half a bottle to kill :)"
"The taste is slightly more balanced than the smell, but this is still a hop heavy beer. Surprisingly, the near-burnt malts show up in the swallow, which creates a reasonably well-balanced aftertaste. The body is slightly rich and the effervescence is elevated. An interesting beer that will make the treasure seekers drool, but might not be a go to beer for many."
"Overall: an easy drinking flavorful beer. Another quality beer from Lagunitas that you should seek out and try."
"Poured on-tap into a snifter. Pours reddish black with a small off white head. Smells of piney and citrus hops. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, not much malt. Beer starts light bodied but finishes a bit thicker, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."

"Very good flavorful ale with an excellent hop profile. One of my favorites from Lagunitas already. Definitely worth trying."

"This is exactly what I like in a black IPA: hop-forward in both aroma and flavor, really highlighting the hop blend, but with a smooth, creamy, chocolatey malt backbone to give it just a little something different. Exceptionally well made ale."
""
""
""
""
"A decent enough rendition of an ABA, the biggish ABV quite well integrated, and the expected char kept on the down-low for the most part. So, what are we then left with? Oh, I dunno - just that typical Lagunitas hop and malt braggadocio? You bet your ass, and it's absolutely fine by this sports fan, so keep 'em coming, is all I can ask."

"Better served at colder temps as recommended."
"Overall I love this beer, right there with Sublimely and Wookie, maybe even better?"

"Overall it is certainly a solid double black IPA at an exceptional price. Not sure if its the licorice like flavor but something holds it back from being phenomenal."
"O: something fans of the style would really dig. As a casual drinker of black ales, it was an enjoyable ale but didn't do anything to pull ahead of my top ales in the style; that said, for fans or the average BA, I'd recommend a buy. Has a lot of quality ""American"" black ale characteristics."

"Overall: Pretty awesome black ale. Even though their hop flavors seem the same or slightly different from beer to beer, the use of different malts sets them apart. I still drink them all and love the short availability of each style."
""
"O: When you hear ""black ale", you may immediately assume that it will have a lot of roasted, peaty, or earthy tones. But I was quite blindsided by this one. It was quite hoppy and well balanced. This is my first time trying a black ale so I really don't know what I should be looking for the style. To me, it's good. If you're expecting some porter-or-stout-like ale, this isn't for you. However, if you are a fan of Lagunitas' hoppier beers like Little Sumpin', then this is right up your alley."

"Dark brown , basically opaque beer with a a creamy medium sized tan colored head. Lace is spotty. Aroma is a plethora of fruity grapefruit, juicy citrus, resinous pine, and malty meaty, roasty aromas. Meaty onion forward steak matinade meets tropical and juicy graefruit. Very interesting, unusual, and fun. Taste is ripe indeed with piles of grapefruit and roasty toasty malts. Brisk, spicy, juicy, and roasty. Mouthfeel is medium dry, slightly syrupy, slick and fullish in body."
"Very dark brown, just some deep chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass, covered with a slab of tight-bubbled creaminess. Resinous oily hops dominate the aroma, not much from the malt. Juicy, pulpy grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and sprucy, herbal dankness. Flavor is a blast of fruit and pine: pineapple, ripe mango, grapefruit. A bit more malt in the mouth, a subtle coffee presence in the finish, but unlike many examples of the style, the hops are very much in charge here. Oily, resinous, dank...maybe a slight sweet nutty quality. Creamy, plush feel that dries out in the end. Delicious!"
"O: I'd expect Lagunitas to pull off a black IPA well...and indeed they have. I'd even reckon this is the second best black IPA I've had, only behind Wookey Jack. Not surprisingly, the two taste similar. I'll try to return to this one semi-regularly."

"Lagunitas rocks it out again! This black ipa pours a near black brown color with an ample tan head that lasts well into the pour and leaves nice foamy lacing. The nose is a very fresh, very dank blend of west coast hops. Lots of pine, weed, and citrus. There is also a nice roasted malt undertone; with hints of coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and yet sticky with hop resin. The flavor is quite hop forward for the style, but I expect that from Lagunitas. The roasted malt is present but subtle. Very well done hop forward black ipa. And given the price, well worth picking up a couple bombers of."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good West Coast take on a Black Ale. Huge juicy hop presence with a solid kick of dark malt. Hop forward for sure but the dark roast doesn't go unnoticed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a solid, drinkable beer. It's meant to be a foil to daytime: bigger, darker, and stronger. It really doesn't drink any less easily though. A very easy beer to just pick up and drink."

""

"I enjoyed this beer as it combines my favorite aspects of IPAs, Stouts, & lagers."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable beer, overall, and at a good price point as well. It combines the roasted malt and hop characters well, not getting too malty or hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste has more malt than the aroma would let on, more of a cocoa dust than chocolate bar. Hop flavor up front with a fair bite on the back end. Clean beer, very little yeast presence and the alcohol is well integrated. Mouthfeel is bubbly and on the thinner side of medium. Pretty good Black Ale, a little smoother than most but I feel like Lagunitas is a little late to the party on this one."
"Pours into an imperial pint glass a deep cola color with a half finger beige head that leaves a nice full ring of lace as it settles into a frothy mass.Some pine resin and earthiness in the nose,not much sweetness to be had.Pretty dry on the palate with mild roast and earthy with some pine and grapefruit hops lingering in the finish,I like the dryness.A good example of the style not uber hopped but hopped enough.Iam still warming up to the style,I like robust porters and I love IPA's but still have not found an ABA that I go crazy for ...yet."

"O: Great! Yeah, I recommend this one. DayTime/NightTime are both worthy drinks. Will have again."

" Overall this is a pretty good black ipa. Deceptively strong and quite tasty. Definitely fits the style. Worthy!"
""
"only loosely a black ipa, this beer is awesome, and the abv to price ratio could not be more favorable! dark brown pour, a little haze, but not super dark or thick. thin tan head rests on top. the smell is intriguing here, the hops are very tropical, mosaic or something, new zealand style fruitiness to it, not a whole lot of bitter. the grain is interesting too, medium roast, chocolate, and a touch of smoke to it. the flavor is the opposite of the norm. instead of being in the finish, the hops are all in the front end. definitely a bright fruity galaxy type thing going on, zesty and super intense, but they fade into a grainy finish thats a mix of char and smoke, honestly tastes like good beef jerky that spent all kinds of time on the smoker. its meaty for sure, just very cool order of tastes to this beer. fuller bodied but the alcohol is well hidden, a bomber is a big dose of this. carbonation is a little soft for me, just a tad underdone and giving a little heaviness to this, but its well named, this will put you to bed. love the hint of smoke and the big juicy hops all up front, very unique."
"O- Another job well done by Lagunitas. Being that Dubhe from Uinta stands to be one of my all-time favorite Black IPA's, NightTime is very reminiscent of it (a beer which boasts a 9.2% ABV and 109 IBU's) in every single category: Appearance, Aroma, Flavor and Mouthfeel. The only reason I would choose Dubhe over NightTime is the fact that 1) it is a year-round offering and 2) is available in 12oz bottles. (4.50)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great IPA and could be even better if they upped the malt bill. As it is, a lot of the malt character is lost in the mire of overhopping. Regardless, if you need a hop fix, look no further."

"Clouded head forms a khaki head with flowing texture and deep ruby amber body nearly black in presentation. Aroma has herbal notes, citric dank dark Black IPA notes, fruity curves makes this beer waiver in particularly...wow. It's a big beer in America...I love this game. Pitch black body forms as it settles that maybe a mix of socks. Aroma dark chocolate, herbal notes. not overly hoppy but it's nice wow what a beer. Overall medium to full bodied I like it."
""
""
"Overall not something I will buy again. Lagunitas finally made a beer I do NOT like."
""
""
"Overall: As usual, Lagunitas puts out a beer at half the price of competitors, while delivering more solidly crafted flavor. Not as much malty greatness as Sublimely Self-Righteous, but better hop flavor than most breweries' best IPA. I continue to love Lagunitas."

"Lagunitas NightTime ---4/5."
"This pours a great looking coffee-cola color with creamy foaming. There’s a wonderful, big aroma on it, with a bit of grapefruit peel and freshly squeezed grapefruit and a touch of dark roasted malt on it. The flavor has a wonderful grapefruit citrus character with a hint of dankness and some of that great roasted malt for contrast. This was delicious."

""
""
""
"O - A real mixed bag of a review I know. Taste and mouthfeel are what truly make a beer so despite this beers poor appearance and smell I still rate it moderate-good and recommend a try. Not a go to for me but I wouldn't turn down another."
""
""
"O - it's another great offering from Lagunitas. I wanted a little more of the dark flavors to play out rather than just the hops I know so well with Lagunitas."
"Pours nearly black, though a little light gets through. Big stanky head. Scent is pine and almost grassy to me. Hops in the taste are a bit grassy too and I like that. The malt has a bit of chocolate and even a touch of root beer. I like this a lot and find it really drinkable yet I don't think it's as well-balanced as it could be. But at $4.99/bomber I'm ready to head out to grab another,"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this, as I do most of Lagunitas' offerings. I will confess that I generally steer clear of black IPA's, and aside from Wookey Jack (which I think this just about surpasses), this is something I would go back for. While it is probably more in the mold of an IPA than a black IPA which is why I like it, it is very well constructed and there is certainly enough to keep fans of either style interested here."
""
"Overall this definitely plays like a Lagunitas beer. Hoppy to let you know where it came from, but blends nicely to the style. Great cost, great beer and good ABV. Will definitely be seeking this out....before NightTime. Sleeping is overrated anyways."
""
"This tastes even bigger than it is. Substantial biter brew that is quite sippable but very bitter. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Olive Tree Market in San Diego."
"Overall a great beer from Lagunitas. Fuck I love black ipas, it'd be nice to see this become full time"
"O: Extremely well balanced between the roastiness and hoppiness. Much too easy to drink given the 8.2% abv, although the restrained 65 IBUs helps with that. Some really good hop flavors without being overly bitter. Definitely worth giving a try, even you aren't a huge fan of the style"
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a brown-edged black coloring with a tall, dense, foamy, clingy, off-white head that coats the glass as you drink. Aromas of dank and resinous hops forward, roasted notes in the backbone, hints of coffee, and citrus highlights throughout. Very balanced for such an aromatic nose. Flavors are roasted and bitter forward, with a blast of cut grass, pine resin, and tart grapefruit notes. Very balanced, with hints of char and roast throughout. The body is full and robust, but fairly light, too, keeping the drinkability up. Roasted and bitter aftertaste, with lingering citrus notes in there as well. Solid, balanced brew. The finish is smooth and slick, with a roasted and slightly bitter linger. The slightly elevated ABV is completely masked with the smooth body and full palate. Great brew!"

"Pours dark brownish black with tan head. Nose is pine forward with deep resinous notes and nothing in the way of roasted malts present. Taste features heavy pine with a twinge of onion/garlic hop character. High level of bitterness with a stuff malt profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick with mild to high carbonation. Overall, the color makes no difference in this brew, if blind folded id have no idea it's a black ale."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of cocoa and citrus zest characteristics."

"Delicious offering from Lagunitas. I poured this black ale into a pint glass from a 22 oz bomber. Huge notes of pine into the nostrils. This beer leaves a light foam lacing as it dwindles down the glass. This beer has a nice hoppy flavor and a subtle creamy after taste. Very well done. It is a special beer that may be my new favorite from Lagunitas. I will be buying this again. Cheers."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark brownish black with over an inch of frothy light brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is citrus andr piney hops along with some roasted malts. Hints of chocolate. The taste is lots of the citrus and pine hops followed up by the roasted malts with some charcoal. Some chocolate towards the end but with more of the citrus and piney hops. Roasty finish. Slick mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Has that typical Lagunitas hop profile that I love. This is probably one of the better Black IPAs out there and the price is fantastic. Overall, I will be buying more of this."

"overall: Quite a nice brew. This is much like an IPA but has a creamy extra something. Surprised at how good this is. Delish."
""
"Even with the ale's darker color and luscious column of foam, there's definitely something off-porter here. Something that only the indigenous taste of the Pacific Northwest can provide. It's an IPA at heart!"
""
"Interesting contrast of flavors. I'm tired of black ipas that pit roast malt against hops. This is hop dominant, with non-bittered chocolate malt adding complexity."
"As expected, solid work from Lagunitas and a notch above most other black ales out there. I get much more citrus here than I typically get from the style within Nighttime's successful marriage of hops and dark malts. Despite it's heft I'd like this in 4 or 6 packs to enjoy more frequently. Certainly worth a try, particularly if you enjoy the style."
"It looks like a stout with a deep black hue and a thick khaki head but it smells like an IPA. Grapefruit, lemon, pine, caramel, chive, cannabis and Bit O Honey candies all meet the nose. The flavor has so much going on with a prominent hop face but a real strong malt backdrop. The hops come through with grapefruit rind, lemon, tropical fruit and honey while the flavor then turns to a molasses, charred ember, and malted barley. This drinks very easy, with a touch of bitterness, but a smooth drinkability. Lagunitas rocks another one and this time it's a bit different from the rest."

"and dark roasted malts. Flavor is dark malts and citrus, bitterness, definitely a black IPA style or hoppy porter depending on how you're feeling. Overall? A hoppy black beer, high alcohol, low price. Typical Lagunitas but nothing I'd drink twice."

""
""
"D- this was a decent brew but overall, it was a little too much for me."
""
""
""

"Overall - Another Lagunitas release, another beer that tastes nearly identical to their core line-up. Sure, there are minor differences in each, but the dominant hop profiles are all basically the same. This beer is good, just don't expect anything innovative. In that respect, it's a disappointment."
