APPEARANCE: jet black body with gray uneven head that simmers to a marshy top; post-trailing is tangible... AROMA: extremely floral with vanilla, citrus and bubblegum; complex... PALATE: immediately effervescent, with bubbles coalescing on the tongue; warming, stoking at the throat; at 9.5% ABV, devilishly subtle...TASTE: intense hops blunt  slightly sweet, almost milky hints; malts lend a smoky appeal to the chunky dark body; coffee is secondary, but smoothly infused... OVERALL: a BIG beer that requires sipping for appreciation; in the Box o' Hops, a third to the Creeker and Flower Power, but that is not an insult, but that's the company it keeps...","dacrza1","Jan 10, 2015"

Resinous oils, dank buds, pine needle and spruce tip followed by hints of burnt toast, bittersweet dark chocolate, used coffee grounds, oatmeal, ash, caramel and toffee. Pretty robust but never approaches being acrid, harsh or overly roasted. Complex, well balanced and very easy to drink with a well masked ABV.

3.86,-1.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,4," The taste of Dark Vine has a mild pine hop flavor with some dark roasted keeping up and slight brown sugar element of crystal malt toward the middle. There is a mild citrus tinge from the hops which have good flavor and dominate the malt, however there is enough to soften the flavor and give a more balanced flavor of burnt malt with the juicy hops trailing toward the end. Overall I enjoyed this a lot more than most of the style even though it is a bit more malty than I expected considering the bitterness level of some of the other hoppy beers in the repertoire however the alcohol is pretty well hidden making for a drinkable hoppy black ale","Slatetank","Beers"

The least desirable part of the beer to me is the taste, where the hop flavors are overpowered by the maltiness, but the hop flavor does not pair well with the malts.","T-34-85","Nov 16, 2013"

Speaking of which, I'm not a fan of the style and I didn't enjoy this at all in the beginning but several sips in it started to grow on me with some really tasty hop resin which I never expected. I purposely avoided this one in the Box of Hops and it turned out to be way better than I anticipated - don't care for the aroma but the taste makes up for it.","jzeilinger","Nov 13, 2013"

This is a great smelling beer, herbal hops hints of pine, mild citric notes amongst a dark roasted malt backbone, the beer really works better than most failed attempts at Black IPAs. Flavor brings big hop bitterness hints of dark chocolate and herbal mint character from the hops mild citrus hop accents. Overall you have to think of one of the Andes mint chocolate when you drink this beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied moderate natural carbonation slightly oily resinous hop components glide across the palate. Nice dry finish keeps this beer drinking great with every sip, I need some more of this stuff.","WVbeergeek","Nov 08, 2013"

Black in color down the middle with dark brown shades on the edges. Dark roasted malt, floral and light citrus aromas with occasional pine hop and a light medicinal, band-aid smell at the back end. Medium bodied with assertive, but delicate carbonation. Burnt malt flavor up front followed by citrus hop bitterness into the middle. Pine hop bitterness and espresso flavors from the middle to the end. Finishes with a lingering pine hop and charred malt bite along with boozy notes as this warmed up.","IronLover","Nov 05, 2013"

There's a certain sweetness at its center, with an appropriate--though unchallenging--bitter finish. The hops are there, but comprise a sedate, dignified presence. The beer's texture is mellow and smooth. I'm not sure what Ithaca has in mind for its ""Box of Hops"" selections, but this is one I wouldn't mind returning to.","Altrurian","Oct 29, 2013"

Hops are exactly where I want them, though, so the next sips I mash around in my mouth more before swallowing. As I get over the surprise of the first few sips I start to find the missing center to a fine dry hoppy mouthfeel that makes my mouth water after each swallow. The only piece missing to this great puzzling black beer is a bit more roasty dark malt flavor, but maybe that's just a problem with my expectation from such a stout-looking brew.","jameswaldo","Oct 28, 2013"

That being said, it's a style that is still young and developing constantly. This particular beer could be a fine example of the style with a bit of tweaking. It's the first Black IPA I've tasted from Ithaca, so perhaps they're still experimenting, but it's a strong start to an exciting style.","TangTKE402","Oct 21, 2013"
