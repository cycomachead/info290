"Looks like a thin black lager, smells like a double IPA and tastes like a pure black IPA. It is a keeper for me."

"Best Black IPA anywhere...! Absolutely my favorite beer of all time, like taking a great Black Lager and blending it perfectly with an extremely high quality IPA...Awesome!"

"one of those that got me moving away from 40's a few years ago.  hi-grav, flavorful, with rich suggestions of chocolatey biscuit behind a pleasantly bittering hop profile.  I wonder what it would be like within a week of bottling - it can in some locations have a low turnover on the shelves."

"22oz bomber: this one pours a dark chocolate brown color. There was about a finger of a tan head on it that didn’t linger long. It has a surprisingly lighter nose. Malts, but not much sweetness at all. Perhaps a bit of chocolate roast and pine. It tastes OK, but I’m not sure why they call it a black IPA. Almost no bitterness to it. There is a good malt body, with some chocolate and roasted notes trying to peak thru but no real sweetness either. It needs a whole lot more hops to be in an IPA category. Let’s just call it a very good strong porter."

"Overall a pleasant sweetness balanced by a touch of smoke and slightly burnt malts, light in general but good and refreshing dark IPA."

"Supposedly a black IPA, but I wouldn't even call it a CDA... this is more like a Baltic Porter. Lot's of tar & piny bitterness, soya sauce, black strap molasses and hints of bitter orange rind. Old Rasputin comes to mind. Along with the tan head, I'd say there's more than just carafa here... probably some black patent malt. It really misses the style, and would probably benefit from some age."
""
"A decent ABA, one led by the malt, and feeding us the neutered hops in small doses here and there. Not my favorite style, but this certainly hits the spot after more than 4 hours on snowy, icy roads."

"O: I like porters and i like Pale Ales that aren't too bitter so this is a nice interplay. The bitterness def tastes like a chinnock or centennial so it is pretty strong, but the malt balances it out. I would buy a 6 pack of this next time both because of the complexity mixed with high ABV and I like that it is organic."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent beer that packs in the key elements of the ABA style"

"O - Not a bad beer and it makes for a perfect transition into the fall season. I have found beers by Peak to be a bit thin and lacking flavor in the past. But that can hardly be a complaint for Hop Noir. I look forward to enjoying this some night under the stars with friends around a fire and a bite in the air."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Poured a dark black with a small brown head. Smells of dark malt and coffee and raisins. Tastes of earthy hops and coffee. Beer is medium bodied, carbonated nicely, great finish. Overall, a pretty good beer."

"O - not the best bipa ive had, but a good beer anyway."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and candied citrus zest. Taste is much the same with cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: A solid, easy drinking Black IPA."
""
""
""
"O: I now know what Peak beer to get when in doubt. I have been underwhelmed by them in the past, but this one is certainly something to brag about. Find it and enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not what I was expecting. It doesn't seem to fit the style. Very sweet and not much bitterness for an IPA but still drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer. It wasn't perfect, but it was complex and well put together. The hoppyness wasn't overbearing nor did it fatigue the palate but it had depth and was multi-layered. Much the same can be said about the malt. I was impressed also with how drinkable such a complex offering could be. Any fan of Black IPAs should definitely give this a try."
"O-A well balanced black IPA with heavy roasted and pine flavor. Not my favor version of the style, but not a bad brew"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better versions of the style. I am not a big fan of his style because they tend to be so far out of balance. A brewer who shows restraint and creativity and purpose with their recipe. Nice brew -- I'll have this again."
"High quality black IPA, definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer. The ""dark"" aspects come out a lot more than the IPA. I would've liked to see a little bit more complex IPA character in this one."
"Overall quite a step up from their regular IPA it seems more balanced with a black malt profile. Worth checking out."
"O- This beer improves as it warms, but a good hoppy ale doesn't run from the cold."
""
"O: Pretty plain and somewhat bland black ale. Very little hoppiness, I blame the possible age on the bottle. Having said that, they didn't bother to bottle date so there's no way to know anyway. I will give it the benefit of the doubt but regardless, it's pretty middle-of-the-road."
"D - a solid offering. Will be exploring this brewery further."
""
""
"Best at a warmer temp."
""
""
"Very disappointed in this one. I like Peak's other beers, and I love the black IPA style. This tasted like a stout, or maybe a coffee stout. No cascade finish, no crispness despite the dark color, nothing. If it had been labelled correctly as a stout, I still wouldn't have been that impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of dark toasted malt flavor up front. There's a decent hop kicker. This creates a very good balance. Rich body with a high carbonation that tantalizes. Long dark aftertaste of strongly caramelized sugars and puckering bitter hop."
""
""
""
"O: Too one-dimensional and leaning towards the heavily roasted/charred malt flavors. Not undrinkable for me (I like a nice roasty porter, for instance), but I could see how others may feel differently."
""
"Overall: this is an interesting beer; I'm glad I picked this up. I don't know if it's an everyday drinker, but it's definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh."
"Dark, nearly black color topped by a creamy tan ring of a head. Fruity hop stickiness in the nose with some sweet coffee and resin. Juicy citrus and pine hop flavor upfront followed by moderate sweet, roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. Fruity and bitter - not a tremendous amount of malt character, but enough to just hit the style. Medium bodied. I was surprised to see this listed at 8.2% as it felt ""smaller"" than that. Pretty good stuff..."
"O: incredibly well balanced between the bitterness and the hop notes, great depth, i feel as though peak has really been stepping up their game lately and theyve really mastered the use of hops across the board"

"This is my second go round with a Black IPA, also known as an American Black Ale, and also known as a Cascadian Dark Ale. Pours a dark brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. It smells good. A shot in the dark I would say that there are either chinook or amarillo hops, I cannot distinguish between the two, perhaps both. There is some hop funk, resin, and maybe some grapefruit. I am getting some roasted barley. Wow that is exactly what I imagined a black ipa to tastee like. Thhere is a lot of chocolate and a lot of hop flavor. The last black ipa I tried tried tasted like a moderately hopped porter. A lot of grapefruit and resinous flavors. It does finish a bit hot but I do not mind that quality. Seeing as though I can taste both the dark elements of this beer; the dark fruit, the chocolate; and the IPA qualities of this beer, distinctly, I consider this beer a success. And I am quite sure I used those semi-colons incorrectly. I have been quite happy with the two beer I have tried from this brewery."
"This one was a wild, wonderful ride. The appearance is PITCH black. Almost intimidating. A really intriguiging citrus character shines in the nose. I love Citra hops. Hops hit the palate first, followed by a mix of smoke, black and malt sweetness. This is a very unique malt profile in that the dark roasted flavors and the sweet malt flavors combine for a wonderful experience. The citra hops ride on top the entire time. Bitter, but the right amount to stand up to the malt. Yum."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed Hop Noir! Great beer!"
"O- I would try a bottle but skip a 6-pack. I wouldn't be surprised if this one didn't return to the shelves next year. Maybe they'll keep the name but ditch the mediocre recipe, I've seen Peak shine before."
"3.13/5.00"
""
"Single finger head and nice lacing on a jet black body. Aroma is nice resin, pine, licorice, mint and earthy hop notes. Flavor is very grassy and floral hop notes. Chocolate and roasted malts cone in at the finish. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall a very nice beer for the style. Nice hop character and strength."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a head that quickly drops. The aroma is fairly big, it’s got some syrupy, roasted malts and strong citrus and tropical hops. The big aromas from the nose kinda cancel each other out when it comes to the tasting, making this just a bitter, hoppy black ale as opposed to the separation of flavors I got on the nose. It tastes good, but it’s really a one-note kind of thing. The mouthfeel is a bit rocky, but it works, and the drinkability is good. It’s a bit of a strange black ale, but I think it works."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine example of this newer style of beer. I'm glad it's brewed localy, which is the main reason I purchased it, but I didn't enjoy it as much as Peak's regular IPA."
""
"Don't try downing it in large quantities, your tastebuds will get rocked. This feels like a sipping beer, and that 8.2% ABV is no joke."
"O: A pretty good black IPA. It balances the flavor well, and the hops are nice. I'm not blown away, but it's tasty."
"O: The alcohol which is no lightweight by any stretch is very well hidden making this beer quite easy to drink. A little too high in alcohol for me to claim as a sessionable beer, it is certainly a delicious and refreshing beer that I enjoyed. I would also like to enjoy this one again."
""
"""Noir"" would best describe the blackness that lurks beneath a tan head. Pine hops assault my nasal passage in an aroma that most reminds me of a freshly roasted and slightly burnt smore. A big dose of pungent herbal pine flavored hop bitterness works its way around the palate with a solid roasted malt body to complement."
"O: A very solid black IPA, it would be right up there with Blue Point Toxic Sludge and Stone Self-Righteous if the mouthfeel was imporved. Good beer nonetheless, and had a bit of chocolate towards the end of the glass which was very complimentary."
"Props to breakfast on the front and back ends, but that bitterness in the middle is simply too much."
"The body is nice and light with good carbonation. Overall a solid brew here. Not sure how fresh it is right now but pretty tasty either way."
""
""
"Does organic mean diacetyl? i'm not up on the hippy lingo of politically correct eating. This beer tastes like buttered popcorn. I didn't even finish my sampler. I'd rather have more of that horrible DIPA from Lost Rhino than this disaster any longer. NEXT."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm not sure about this beer, I like what it was trying to do but not sure if it's for me."
"Overall: A little funky in the aroma, but overall a tasty, assertive black IPA. I think its better than my numbers will indicate."
""
""
""
"O: its a good brew for the most part, probably come back to"
""
"O - The flavor isn't without its flaws--it's burnt coffee flavor was a bit heavy--but over all quite tasty. I enjoyed it, and it's pine scent is seductive."
"Not sure I'd buy another 6er, maybe just another to see if it is any different. Boo."
""
""
""
"On tap. Pours a dark brown/black color with an inch of frothy light brown head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is chocolatey and hoppy. Sweet floral and citrus hop aromas. Some caramel. Taste is of chocolate and floral hops. Nicely bitter. Sweet. Not really much citrus like in the nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Floral hop finish. This is a pretty solid Black Ipa. Worth having again for certain."
""
""
"O: Good Black IPA. Still hoppy after 6+ months. Pretty tasty."
"Overall a better flavor than aroma. Pretty nice, and the alcohol is well hidden. Not bad, but could use more malt body. The hops are good and vibrant."
"Overall: Not remotely enjoyable. Avoid. But at least it's organic, right?"
""

"An interesting beer but not very robust flavor or nose, makes it easy to drink, but bordering on uninteresting."
"O- a very good example of the style and I really enjoy this. The strong malt presence is great!"
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler, the beer is jet black, with a strong, thick, dense, one inch milk chocolate colored head. Looks intense, with a great cling on the glass. Aromas of molasses sweetness, coffee bitter and roast, and wet, resinous hops. Good, strong nose. Flavors are very strong and forward on the tongue with a dark fruit sweetness and molasses robustness. The hops presence follows quickly, cleaning everything up with a drying and pungent bitterness, with lots of wet, green characters. The aftertaste is almost all coffee, both in roast and bitterness. There is a resiny and mid-linger finish to the brew that slowly dries in mouth until it is clean and clear. Very strong flavors, and a hint of alcohol presence throughout, make this a sipper, but a good one. Very tasty brew."
"Would like to see it in six packs instead of just bombers."
"Tasting more and more Black IPA's these days and would have to say this is a pretty good one. Walks that fine line of too much going on...too many bitter acrid flavors but this one was very enjoyable. Glad to have the chance to try."
"Peak Organic Hop Noir is a brownish black ale with a brown sugar colored head that's smooth and dense, lasts forever and covers the glass with solid sheets of foam. It has a bold citrus aroma that is a lot like mandarin orange or tangerine. There is a hint of roast to it, like coffee. It's pretty full bodied, smooth and foamy. The finish is pretty dry and a little acidic. It leaves the teeth feeling a little gritty. It has a pretty bold flavor that's quite bitter and a little sweet. Flavors of mandarin orange, toffee, dark chocolate and pine resin mingle through the taste. Both the citrus flavor and the roasty, almost ashy, flavor linger well after the swallow. This is pretty richly flavored, so it's not really for chugging, but I don't let that stop me. I'm a big fan of this style and these guys did a good job with it. It's a little palette blowing, so don't have it before dinner."
"Pours three finger tan head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose and flavor is burnt coffee with a long, lingering burnt coffee after taste. $5.49 for a 22 oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Reasonably dry for such a roasty beer. I wouldn't have minded a bit more body, but I suppose that would have made it more of a porter."
"A little malt sweetness showed up, though light, with some bitter, roasty dark malts being more dominant. A pleasant, rindy, dose of piney hops show up, leaving a resiny coating in the mouth. I enjoyed the balance of roasty malts and rindy hops here. Prosit!!"
"1358"
"O: A great black IPA, all of the flavors are balanced well, a definite must have."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but a bit too dry to drink for a long time."
"Taste is very... GOOD. I taste dark roasted coffee, almost burnt, with a sweetness I still can't articulate (maybe a dunks dark roast with extra extra?). Its very malty, with a hop flower bitter finish."
"For over 8% abv this beer hides the alcohol well. It's easy to drink, packed with flavor and has a great price for 22oz. One of the better black IPA's I've had."
"Overall: Those black malts sure can be a harsh mistress. The bottle immodestly described it as being ""delectable," though I found it hardly even drinkable."
"Overall, this is a fantastic Black IPA: a double-barreled mouthblast of all that is good about both black malts and hops, and sure to please any fan of the style. My only big qualm was with the bottle, as the gold foil was heavily glued on, and rather irritating to deal with."
"With its off-smelling nose and too roasted taste, it’s safe to say that this wasn’t the best example of the style that I’ve had lately. The taste did bring some decent hop flavors to the table though and the body was at least pretty smooth for a big beer. I mean it's drinkable if you find yourself with a bottle but there are definitely better options out there on the market right now. Hopefully Peak will continue to work with this one."
"Taste starts with roasty malts, but then goes lightly sour in the middle, that carries through even under the hoppy close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are alright, but less of the sour would certainly make this a more enjoyable brew."
"I did not like this beer. The smell and aftertaste are too off for me. I am having trouble explaining this beer because it does strange things on the palate. I have enjoyed every black IPA I have tried up to this point, especially the Portsmouth Brewery Black IPA."
"22oz bomber purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours an opaque black body with a good dense half-inch of tan head. Smells amazing - espresso and dark chocolate vie for dominance against citrussy grassy hops with a generous butterscotch flavor. Intense dark chocolate and espresso clobbers the palate, with grapefruit playing more of a supporting role and butterscotch and nut rounding out the finish. Boozy not in flavor as such, but more in the mouthfeel. Light on the carbonation. Definitely a sipper. Pretty good overall. A little more carbonation would help the flavors mesh better I think."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid roasted and black malt scent along with a nice piney hop nose. The black malt bitterness and the hops compliment each other. The taste is great! It has a bitter hop bite that jumps up and grabs you. It's followed by an excellent malt base that's adds balance and complexity. The black malts provide their own bitterness as well as a roasted/earthy feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious black IPA. It's complex while maintaining a high drinkability."
"As it warms, the coffee and pine sap bitters hit evenly and at the same time. Very unique. Not my first Black IPA, or American Black Ale, but the first time the two have had such a mirrored effect. Both flavors I equally enjoy, not sure if I love them at the same time, but it's still great. An amazing example of the style! You everything all at once. I think I still prefer one or the other, but this is fun. 8.2% is hitting a bit on the second vigorous pour."
"D: This had a pretty nice scent and taste with good body, but the finish was a bit rough with noticeable alcohol. So it wasn't super easy to drink, but it was otherwise enjoyable."
"Pours a dark charcoal color with minimal spots making up the only hints at a head. Scent is quite pungently hopy - citrusy and herbal - before a charred and smokey roasted grain profile comes through. Taste begins hoppy and herbal before the char takes over, roasted grains dominate and the finnish has an odd charred leather like taste. Medium bodied, moderate carbonated and quite dry and chalky on the palate. Some decent points with the strong hoppyness and roast but the herbal and leather qualities dont agree with my palate."
"Bottle from Zyn's in Calgary. After having had the BC Collaboration Black IPA the day before, I was underwhelmed. Thick roast, but this is on the mildly astringent side. Above average bodied, very black. Not as integrated with the hops and roast that I would like.Not tremendously drinkable, and strong carbonation."
"O - I hope these reviews helps to knock it off the buzz list, as people really shouldn't be seeking it out. Pass."
"Pours a thick black with some mocha colored head that leaves some spotting. Nose is rather off-putting and smells like soap. Palate is pleasantly bitter, but the combination of green, grassy hops and black malt is strange in this brew. I like black IPAs generally, but this is pretty weird. Reminds me a lot of herbal soap."
"D - I didn't care for this one very much, and found Black Raven to be superior where it counted."
"Thanks to Alex for this, the king of Buzzed beers, tasted with Olde Hickory Black Raven, this was the consensus loser... Pours a nice black color, a decent light tan head... The nose is a little light, cascade, lots of hop, a bit of ash... Soapy but has a nice malt balance, too bitter and charred overall"
"A good blend of hops and dark malts, a style that seems to be growing on me lately, although I still would say Nightstalker is the only great hoppy dark ale I have had."
"D: just not overly impressive, pretty on par for the style. great chocolate/roasted flavors, but i need more hops in the nose and on the palate. definitely surprised considering the ABV."
"overall this was a love it or hate it beer, for me i loved it and thought it was a brilliant beer, but then again i love the style."
"Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one with myself, beeruser, and funkydelic at one of our weekly tastings. Served from growler into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a minimal cream colored head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, orange peel, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, orange, orange peel, citrus, citrus hop, and orange rine. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Based on the flavor description I just gave, if you don't like ALL aspects of oranges this brew is not for you. Just overwhelming with orange. A few of our guests at the tasting could not choke this one down due to this fact. So be forewarned about this... Worth trying at least once, but I would leave it at that."
"Sampled from the gold foil topped 22 ouncer on June 25, 2011. It pours black with a silky, soft light brown head that eventually settles to a ring and leaves clinging lacing along the way. The aroma emits a topnotch earth and pine hopped character with some rich, chocolate malts balancing it all off. I wouldn't make the body bold but it has a decent medium texture. The taste has a vague chocolate note with a 50-50 balance of dry hops and sweet malts. Just well-balance in the end."
"Every time I have a peak I am surprised. The beer starts with a mouth full of carbonation. As it dissipatesa creamy chocolate malts and spicy hops come in. As the taste becomes roasted a bitter hop lingers very well done."
"O- solid black ipa. Probably one of the smoothest especially at 8%. A good mix between porter and ipa."
"O - This isnt a bad black IPA, there are better ones out there. Still though, another solid offering from Peak Organic."
"HV"
"Overall this is a good beer. I've had some hoppy, fresh stouts before(something from Troegs, can't recall) and this ABA is in that vein."
"Black with faint reddish edges and a frothy light tan cap. Good head retention and a bit of clumpy, spotty lacing clung to the glass. Nice hop aroma, fruity citrus along with grapefruit pith, pine resin, herbal and earthy -- but nothing overpowering and everything in balance. Good malt nose as well, notes of caramel and chocolate, a bit of roast. Solid bitterness throughout, slightly sharp in the finish, pine and spicy hops, toffee sweetness, mild citrus, light alcohol. Medium bodied with medium plus carbonation, light in texture, mild astringency, a bit spicy in the finish. I liked this quite a bit, really balanced overall with plenty of character."
"Good beer and recommended."
"Full flavor, musty, earthy, roasty,hoppy brew. Dark roasted grains, milk chocolate, some coffee grinds, some hoppy grapefuit notes. Tasty stuff, no doubt. Complex offering from P.O. Worth a try."
"Aroma is decently hoppy with floral and fruity hints, not strong but still pleasing. It pours a dark muddy brown that is opaque save at the edges, and the pale tan head is thick, frothy and persistent. Flavor is quite hoppy and somewhat bitter, and has grassy, woody and nutty hints, plus a fair but not fierce alcohol nip. Texture is smooth and fizzy, leaving a tingly and woody finish."
"I like this one, but it's really nothing special at this point. Just a nice bitter strong porter."
"o: with the fair warning that i've been a big fan of black IPAs / cascadian IPAs ever since I first had Wailing Wench 5-6 years ago -- Peak gets the style right with this one. a beer that tastes even better than it looks. if the ABV% were dialed down a notch, i could see myself having 2-3 of these."
"Grabbed a bottle at a great price and shared with some friends. Poured out a pitch black with a tan, more on the brown side, two finger head. Nose is a balance of fruity citrus with an earthy background. Fresh hop flowers. The malt background was very faint For the flavor. Hops are right up front. Very crisp with a balanced bite of citrus. The hops quickly transition to a very dry black malt finish. The bitterness/dryness linger for a while. The dry hopping is definitely apparent and the balance of dark malts to hop characteristics. Great timing with hop additions."
"O-A very good representation of the style and one of the better ones I've had. I'll buy this again for sure."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink but isn’t that sessionable due to its high alcohol content and the strong amount of dryness."
"I think I've reviewed enough black ales recently to say I really enjoy this one and it's a great example of a great style. Organic? Yeah that's awesome, too!"
"I should say more than just ""piney hops"" but I can't help it. Regardless, this example reminds me of the Otter Creek and Rock Art offerings. It doesn't hit you with hops and as much as I hate to say it (much to the chagrin of session ale advocates), it's one of Peak's better offerings."
"D: This is a very well balanced beer. The hops mesh well with the malts making it an extremely smooth beer to drink. The ""Black IPA"" style is one of my new favorites and this is a great example of the style."
"Pours a clearish very dark brown with two finger thick, creamy tan head, fades over a couple of minutes, leaving chunky rings of lace behind. Smell: pine and pink grapefruit, roasted and burnt bread notes. Taste: grapefruit segments, piney, herbal, more than just a touch of alcohol, but it works here. Mild roasted and burnt flavors with a hint of high cocoa chocolate. A mouthful of C-hops, juicy and bitter with a drying semi-sweet finish. More than the usual black malt flavors. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Tasty, and organic to boot."
"I thought the hops dominated this beer, and not in a good way. I love hops, but this beer was way too aggressive for me."
"O) Not a gateway beer. Definitely for Hopheads but porter and stout lovers might find some favor in the taste profile."
"D - Very nice, the hop aroma is spectacular and it works well with the dark malt. The bitterness is very strong and it lingers on the tongue to such a degree that it is almost overwhelming. This is a really nice beer, and it shows that organic beers can be excellent on their own merits when they don't rely on the organic label as their only selling point."
"Pours a pretty solid black color with a creamy frothy khaki head that just wont quit. Spicy resinous pine mixed with hints of roast and a slight mineral/earthiness. This on fills my taste buds with and enormous resinous hop bite. Hints of roasty coffee break through and mix with the resinous hops, like drinking coffee out of the bong pipe. Bone dry finish with long lingering hoppy roasty aftertaste. Medium level of carbonation, medium body, slick resinous mouthfeel. I enjoyed this. This is another solid brew from a brewery that seems to be finding ways to get out from under the radar."
"Pours a dark brown, finger of light khaki head. Nose is pleasant citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, light roast. Taste is loads of fresh hops, feels like I am breathing hops after each drink! Fresh pine, loads of bitterness, grapefruit, coffee and roast, could use a bit more sweetness and body to balance all the hops, though I love the hop presence. Lower astringency than some black IPAs, pretty enjoyable. Thanks Rob!"
"O- A really good ABA. I was impressed by this offering from peak organic. The hops could have actually mellowed over time and still been great."
"Wow this is one black beer,many of the style pour more of a deep chocolate color but this is impy stout ink black here,a fluffy one finger tan colored head atop.Spicy and resiny hop hit ya in the nose along with a little brown sugar and raw earthiness,hops command the aromas.Earthy and very dry on the palate,a little dark bread and very light molasses notes as well,it becomes really spicy after a few sips.Iam gonna say this is what this style is supposed to be,its spicy and hoppy with a real dark bread element to it,this is a damn fine beer,for me its a standard for the style."
"O: great beer - I'd have it again. Good balance between an IPA and a black lager without losing any flavor"
"Overall not bad, a bit astringent and light on the overall malts, nice fresh hops."
"overall a decent take at the style, but the tobacco qualities are the most dominant. not my favorite, but an excellent value, and one I could see picking up on occasion."
"Y for the rice. I am going to try to stock up on this."
"I am not the biggest fan of the Black IPA but this is really good, I think those that like the style will like this it is worth giving a try."
"O - One of the better Black IPA/CDA/ADA that I have tried."
