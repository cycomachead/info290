"O - A fantastic beer.  Stellar balance of roast, sweetness, and bitters for a style that all too often goes roasty for roasty sake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drying wonderfully, only the shell of malt leaves its starchy substrate behind which supports the earthen rye bite, the acute pine bitterness and roasted acidity extremely well. Pretending to be ""imperial", the body suggests something bigger, but its dryness refutes it all and promotes a more drinkable palate."

"Quite drinkable and interesting. A dark brew with a more distinct flavor. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach. They should put this in cans and lose the stupid cork nonsense."

"Pours a dark brown that is close to black and has a massive offwhite head that dies slow and leaves lace patches down glass. A strong bit of citric hops are in the aroma along with hints of rye and roasted malts. Roasted malts and rye are prevalent and the wheat gives the beer both a fuller body and smoothness that is second to none. There are hints of sweetness (chocolate or caramel is my guess) as well as a good amount of citric hops on the backend. Well balanced beer and one of the few ""black IPAs"" that is able to draw out all the characteristics of both styles."
"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, spicy rye, cocoa, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt, rye, citrus zest, and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great balance of roast, citrus zest, and rye aspects all around."

"Be careful with the pour or it will fill half the glass, otherwise it’s a few fingers of light tan, very uniform microfoam, looks like it was intentionally whipped up, very good retention, the lacing is pretty much a solid sheet down the glass side, rarely breaks into streaks. The liquid is a kind of muddy brown like pond water, semi-opaque, displays a yellow cast near the surface, through it all you can easily see the hyperactive bubbles bursting upwards. The nose is all but totally grapefruit citrus, the rye is consistent but not showy, well cooked country bread notes, light pepper spice, same for the nectarine to peach fruit scents, very smooth and focused, all about that citrus. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and the carbonation really gets it churning, overaggressive. When it does settle into the palate, the grapefruit leads again however the raw graininess is assertive. Some cocoa, the roast is not high-toned, more baked, bready. Pine adds to overall bitterness rather than sweetness, the fruit also tart, a mix of pineapple, nectarine and apple more than peach or apricot. Not trying to hard, that said, the finish while clean could use more flavor, quibbling. Hard not to consume happily."
"Overall this is very enjoyable, plenty of hops for the hopheads but not so overpowering that you can't enjoy the malt background as well. Another really nice brew from boulevard."

"First Boulevard beer I've had, and I like it. I like it a lot Jerry. Am glad to get the happiness in the nose yet a great balance in the flavor. Very well done."

"Overall, a nice black IPA with lots of piney hops, roast and some rye."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this isn't like a lot of examples I've had in the style, but I personally think it sets it apart in a good way. Much less rich and overbearing than some of it's black rye IPA counterparts, it's a fitting spring take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not a bad beer, but not a good one and very unexpected coming from Boulevard. With some balance it could have been fantastic. I will purchase again and update review if I just happened to buy a bad bottle."

"Very enjoyable. The malt takes a front seat to the hops."
""
"O-This is a nice, but not amazing, take on a black ale. I know my bottle was probably beyond its prime by a few months, but the hops are still up front and provide a nice citrus-peel bite that offsets the barley and wheat flavors. It lacks the cocoa that many black ales rely on, and instead, relies on rye spice and roasted barley, which mostly works, but this beer gets a bit grainy at times. A solid effort in an increasingly crowded style."
""
""
""

"750mL bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours with a brownish tinge into opaque blackness, with a massive dingy head. Aroma suggests Cascade-y IPA. Flavor is similarly C-hop forward, with a little bit of roasted malt, and just a hint of rye grainy goodness on the back of the palate. Flavors are good but not all that complex -- a little disappointing given black rye IPA/CDAs have so much to offer. Still a really good beer...but 10 out of 10 times I'd rather have a Wookey Jack :) Carbonation is a little bit too strong. Bonus points for the massive head though."

"To be fair this bottle is 1 month expired and the hops may have lost some of their pungency. However, according to the bottle date, they gave this beer a 17 month shelf life. Overall, pretty average for a black IPA."
""
"Fabulous beer? mmmm the penultimate fab beer. Whatever; pretty friggin good brew. In most of my scores it was just a hair under the next up rating. Anyway, poured at a great temperature with giant, foamy, frothy, medium tan head that never settles and a bit'o lace. Aroma is slightly gamey, hops, dark roast malt, weed, dry forest, mustiness. Appearance is a very dark but clear cherry garnet with a few bubble trails. Flavor's a slightly sweet acid at the very first and quickly followed by bitter and the resin & citrus flavors . Roast is also predominate and include dark ripe fruit. Finish is like flavor, tapers slow, and is fairly drinkable."

"Overall: Another very good Smokestack beer from Boulevard."
""
""
""
"The body was the typical medium of the style. Drinkability was pretty good, we didn't struggle in the least with the bottle. Overall, a nice pleasant CDA, not among the elite of the style, but worth a shot if you see it."
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a beer that is slightly fizzy, foamy, and finds an equilibrium somewhere in-between: in general, too much carbonation. Ethanol is lightly felt on the tongue and in the nostrils, a bit strange for a 7.7% ABV beer. Closes dry, leaving substantial stickiness coating the lips and tongue after each sip."

"Big thanks to Cameron (TheBishopCo) for this bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, dark malts don't get to roasty or contrast to the hops too much, quite a bit going on but doesn't seem like it when you actually smell and taste it."
""
"O - Easily a top 5 black IPA for me"
""
""
"O - dear God I would love to get this fresh. The only fault is the smell, and I think if it were fresh, it'd be perfect. Very good representation of this style, but I'm totally biased toward citrus anything."
"O- lots of leafy, dank, herbal and earthy hops. Not as much maltiness as I was expecting but overall worth a try"
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic entry into the Black IPA world. Damn this brew is delicious. Pours a surprisingly light body, but has the appearance of burnt caramel. Wonderful hoppy smell, surprisingly light on the grain. Taste really evolves over the course of a drink. Starts of with pretty mild bitter hops and toasted malt. Evolved quickly into... well... I guess a Grainstorm. Plenty of hops to balance. Light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Tall, foamy head. Very much enjoyed this beer. This Smokestack series can going as long as Boulevard would like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer. It's much more pleasant than other Black IPAs. I'm happy to have tried this beer, but I don't think I'd want to drink more of it. This style just isn't my bag."
""
"O: I would order this again if I saw it on tap. I probably would not buy a six pact as this isn't my favorite style. But, again, I liked this more than most of the black IPAs I've tried."

"O- There are lots of dark bittern notes in this beer that overpower any malt or hop flavor and not much other character. The big bitterness makes it a bit hard to get through a full bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting a bit more from Boulevard as I am quite a fan but the lack of balance and the overcarbonation left me a little bit disappointed; still a pretty good beer but not quite what I was expecting"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with above average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. A very well made beer, which I would gladly buy gain. I continue to be impressed by the beers in the Smokestack Series. Keep them coming."
""
""
"O - One of the better black IPA's I've had. Just needs a bit more nose to add to the character of the beer. To me, it's like a porter knocked up a by an ipa, good combo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A delicious Black IPA/Cascadian pale ale. I'll be finishing the bottle."
""
""
"Overall this is a great Black Rye IPA. I would love to see it in four or six packs, and would be excited to try an imperial take on the same beer. Aroma is really the only thing holding it back, which is a pretty big component of my appreaciation of IPAs."
""
"O: A nice beer, definitely enjoyable, not quite to the same level as what I've come to expect from Boulevard. I would buy it again, but only if I was jonesing for a Black IPA for some reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better Black IPAs/American Black Ales I have tried. It stays hoppy without throwing in a ton of huge roasted notes and the rye gives it some nice complexity. If you're usually turned off of these beers because of the huge Stout notes, try this one."
"Maybe medium body, ample carbonation. Fills and coats the mouth nicely. Drinks very well. Would gladly have again. Can satisfy the roasty dark fans and the hop heads alike."
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2013. Pours clear very dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, floral, pine, grass, toast, spicy rye, light roasted malt, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with big presence of citrus hop notes with some moderate malt presence. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pine, grass, toast, roasted malt, spicy rye, and floral earthiness. Moderate floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, floral, toast, spicy rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus hop flavors; with a moderate roast/rye malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice black IPA. Nice balance of hop complexity and malt; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"O-An interesting take on Rye IPA and the Black IPA, still not sure if the flavors mesh well together."
"Americo’s bottle. Brown with a big head, lacy, and a hoppy aroma. meets the style with emphasis on hops rather than roastiness. Tasty and good drinkability. Satisfying. This brewery continues to bring out quality new releases. A tad above average mouthfeel."
"O: I am not overly familiar with the black rye IPA style but came away thinking this was a great take. Complex, smooth, well-balanced, and unique. Not sesssionable but good beer to split a 750 with. Dad enjoyed it too!"

"Very enjoyable beer. Very easy to sip through an entire bottle without realizing it."
""
""

""
""
""

"D: This was a nice IPA, but not so much black (aside from the looks) or rye. The scent and taste were good but simple. The body was excellent, and the finish was pretty smooth, so it was easy to drink. Nice brew, but not as unique as I wished."
""
"The beer pours a rich mahogoney with a tan head. The atoma is the expected strong mixture of rye and hops. The taste is a combination of the two bitters at work there is an undercurrent of mslt in the closr thst lingers nicely the feelvis medium and oily a very interesting rye and a bit different. All in all a solid and enjoyable beer."
"The cork pops loudly as it's removed. A near-black colored ale is revealed with a towering, beige head that holds excellent retention, that leaves tons of lacing as it eventually fades. Aromas are earthy, spicy rye malt, roasted barley, dank piny hops, grapefruity citrus comes through more as it warms. Bold notes of spicy rye, roasted barley, sweet caramel, and earthy, dank, bitter, piny hops battle on the palate, creating a nice meld of flavors with excellent complexity and balance. Mouth-feel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, while being full bodied. Overall, I really enjoyed this, but in my opinion it falls short in comparison to another beer similar to this one (FWWJ)."

"Served in a tulip at The Saucer on 4/3/13. Pours a deep, light devouring black into the glass with not many other hues to it. It has a good tannish head with tons of tiny bubbles that leaves good, sticky, thick lacing all over the glass. The smell was full of powerful hops. There was tons of oily, resinous citrus on the nose, which I absolutely love, but I felt like the malt was a little overpowered. I pick up a bit of roasted coffee and maybe some charred cookie in the background, but it is totally eaten alive by the hops. As I taste the beer it starts with the bitter malt and some roasted coffee and brown sugar. This flavor flows seemlessly into the spicy character of the rye malt. Then at the peak of the performance is the flavorful hops: there is mango and oranges especially there. It's a very fluid expression of several very good flavors that just work well together. Mouthfeel is characterized by good carbonation levels and a nice body overall. As usual, I am very impressed overall with the quality of the Smokestack series by Boulevard, even while largely disliking most of their regular offerings. This beer was a good strong offering. The only detriment I placed was in the nose because I feel like a Black IPA should have a little more of the dark malts present (as this is what ""separates"" it from a regular IPA/DIPA). That is simply a ""style"" thing, but overall I loved this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I simply love what Boulevard does with the Smokestack Series. I have yet to be disappointed. Grainstorm is another successful brew that i cant get enough of. A complex grain forward creation that is equally balanced. Surprisingly smooth and easy drinking. This is a beer to enjoy by the multiples. Cheers!"
""
"Overall: I really like what rye does to BIPAs and this beer is no exception. The spicy rye is balanced with earthy hops and a huge grain bill for a really enjoyable brew. I like how this beer doesn't overpower you with roasted flavors and doesn't shove hops in your face. A strong, balanced offering from Boulevard."
""

""

"Wow....one of the best beers I've had...very happy to have had the chance to have it on tap. The beer poured an opaque black with thick ecru head that laced like a vicki secret catalog all the way down the brady sniffer glass. The scent was fresh hop with pine being a bit most potent than the citrus which tied in nicely with the burnt malt backdrop. The taste was a beautiful balance between the hops and roasty rye with kept the pallat clear after the pull. The mouthfeel was medium to full in body with smooth carbonation. The best thing about this beer was that it was under 8%...making it sessionable!!! I could have sat at that table all night long!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow and a half. The hallmark of great beer is the ability to be a dynamo! Every sniff and every single sip is different because this beer offers so many different flavors. A roasty bitter and a hoppy bitter, a rye spice and the right amount of creaminess in the body to balance. Filled with malt or quenched by hops? Spicy hops or spicy rye? The grassy, fresh hops flavors of a hop forward IPA and the caramely, roasted backbone of a porter proves why black IPA can be a ground breaking style. Rye, beautiful rye. Need I say more?"
"O - I dont want to give anyone a bad impression of this beer. It may just not be my style. The beer was quite complex in taste although the smells were a tad bit faint. I'll need to buy a couple more black rye IPAs to compare this one to and maybe review again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good Boulevard beer – Boulevard, though, has the proven capability to put out some of the best beers on the planet. I think the malts went a little far in this beer, really; complexity is alright, but it’s even better to accentuate the best from a certain style of grain or two. I feel like the brewers tried to include EVERYTHING a grain bill could offer, which ends up being too complicated to truly enjoy."
""
""
"This beer has the privilege of being so well balanced that it almost turns invisible. It's like bland without being bland. Pretty good beer."
""
"O/D-Boulevard made this assortment of flavors come together with fluidity. I thought this was a pretty fun BRIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep roasted chesnut brown with a large blooming light beige colored head atop that takes forever to settle leaving a nice full ring behind.Resiny hops stand out most in the nose along with a shot of spicy rye,not much roast.Quite dry on the palate with a healthy dose of citric/resiny hops,there is a sharpness from the rye but it's not in your face,somewhat grainy and earthy but not a whole lot of roast.A well hopped ABA that doesn't have alot of the ""black"" components,still a nice beer."
"O: My first quality issue I have experienced with a Smokestack series beer. I did not finish, just passed it around the bar and let the uneducated palates delight in their ignorant bliss."
"O: Excellent Black Rye IPA - smooth and well balanced towards the hops."
"O= This is a solid Black ale. I personally find the style to be a little goofy. There is just so much flavor packed into a beer that it all just sort of falls together. I don't know if it's just me but they seem a little muddled. They still taste good but they all sort of taste the same to me. It's taken a few to understand it but I think for me most part it's hard to make a Black Ale that is different."
"This is one of the better black iPa's I've had, on par with wookie jack."
""
"o - terrific black ipa and i loved the rye take on this. another smokestack series winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really nice rye IPA. Worth getting and probably more than once."
"I am not a fan of the ""Black IPA"" style. If any brewery and beer series could change my mind it would be Boulevard Smokestack. While not bad by any means. I have just never been a fan of how the hops and malts intermingle. This one is particularly resinous and oily for my tastes with a bready, burnt toast flavor that does not mesh for me."
""
"Very focused flavors here. It's not overly roasted and the rye seems to be well incorporated. The aroma was a little weak but all in all a solid Black."
"What a smooth easy drinker. The price is right and provides good comfort anytime of the year or time of day. Tame enough for your non-craft friends to try or stash up for yourself-in saying that I believe best when fresh and icy cold. Couldn't stop myself from rifling this down. Kudos to the smokestack series--again!"

"$8.99 for bomber bottle"

"Beer is medium to light in body, hoppy, mildly to moderately bitter on the finish, I dn't get a lot of rye in there but it is a nice beer overall. Probably not a repeat but there's nothing wrong with it, it is a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love Boulevard and the style, but this one just did not do it for me. The char is heavy on this one and sometimes the rye added a slightly medicinal quality to it. Not a horrible beer by any stretch but there are several others in the style I would go to first. This one was a miss for me."
""
""
"O: Wow, this beer is great. The chocolate, rye and hops really meld together nicely. Well balanced, mellow, smooth and very tasty. Outstanding really. Not a huge in-your-face hoppiness like some - wookey jack is definitely a hoppier version of this for example. This one is more easy drinking and balanced but doesn't have as sharp of flavors. Awesome job, Boulevard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is perfect. Light-medium bodied and drinks extremely smoothly. It probably drinks like it is less than 7% ABV. Overall, a nice black IPA. This is a pretty hit and miss style for me, but I enjoyed this one."
""
""
"O: This is totally not a style I'm fond of overall, but this is not the standard Black IPA fare. Will have again."
""
"O: while this beer is complex, it is still very refreshing and enjoyable. I had no problem finishing a bomber quickly by myself, and could have had more. I would consider this one of my favorite black ipa's, and the rye didn't overpower the beer which is what I was hoping for. Another great one from the smokestack series."
"O- good beer, more of a rye pa than a black rye pa. Lots of citrus with less chocolate or roast then a wookie jack or something similar."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a very dark, opaque brown with a massive light brown half glass head that slowly dissipates to a half finger head with pillowy lacing. Aroma of light toasted malt, citrus hops and slight rye sourness. Unusual flavor of toasted and caramel malt, some nuttiness; transitions to dark malt and sweet fruit juice then finishes with piney, citrus hops and slight rye sourness. A fun roller coaster of a flavor progression, with the sweet fruit part a unique component. Medium bodied. This is an unusual, but completely enjoyable rye / black ale; IPA hoppiness is subdued, but the balanced, interesting flavors more than hold interest. Hope to see this one again."
"O- This is pretty badass beer. A different beer and very well done. Definitely worth a try."
"O/D - An interesting and very hoppy black ale/rye IPA. A little bit filling from all the carbonation. ABV is moderately reasonable. A bit of a palette smasher."
""
"750ml bottle: This one pours a fairly opaque, dark brown color. There was about a finger of fairly dense tan head on it. It leaves a bit of lacing. Nice nose to this one. Pine, some citrus and rye are predominate. Getting some other fruits hiding in the background. Nice taste. A good citrus and pine bitter bite to it, followed by some roasted malt. Some rye, maybe some of the fruits hiding in there. Very nicely balance body. This is very good and worth searching out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry roasted malt backbone, hops are subdued but lend some dry bitterness in the aftertaste and some vague dried citrus peel in the middle. Slightly watery feel. Not one of the more successful beers in the smokestack series, but not bad overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown capped by a fluffy light beige two finger head. Excellent retention and gobs of lacing left behind on the glass. Roasted grain, citrus, and light white pepper on the nose. Roasted malt, light caramel notes, pineapple, mandarin orange, and tangerine. Finishes fairly dry with very evident rye spiciness combined with citrus rind bitterness. Smooth, creamy medium body; lively carbonation. Really tasty brew that balances many different elements and bring them together into a cohesive whole. A worthy addition to the almost always impressive Smokestack Series."
""
"Overall - Excellent beer, I would highly recommend it not only for just the straight up qualities but also for the uniqueness of the brew. A black rye IPA. A lot of these I have had are kinda sub-par, but this one is excellent. I hope it continues to get brewed, highly recommended, CONDOR approved."
"Overall: very nice IPA. Never had a black rye IPA and was very impressed. A flawless execution by Boulevard. Hope this one sticks around."
"Something tells me a grainstorm would be terrible to try to live through... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brown-garnet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light roasted malts, light toasted rye bread, and mild grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the greens coming in all salad strong and whatnot. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a good black rye IPA, one that certainly is a black rye IPA, but nothing exciting."
"Exactly where I like my Black IPAs/CDAs - aggressive hops, minimal malt and roast. The hop combo is one of my favorites (Simcoe, Amarillo, and Citra) and the brewers should be applauded for not going overboard with the specialty malts, with the rye addition being a unique twist to the style. Grainstorm keeps up the tradition of excellence I've come to expect from the Smokestack Series. Simply a great American craft beer here."
""
"When you open a bottle of beer, and the smell of the hops hits you before you pour the beer, you know that a treat to the senses is coming. This was one of those times. The smell of grapefruit became stronger with beer having been liberated from the bomber, but oddly did not get much more intense while nosing the glass. The look was as dark as a stout, but the head formation was much more massive, at three plus fingers thick. The head did not seem to go anywhere at all till I typed all this. The taste was very complex, with a constant interplay of light and dark malts and hops. There were notes of licorice, banana, coffee, dark toasted bread, grapefruit, and iced tea flying across the tongue in rapid succession. There was not a lot of heft to the body though, and the finish was a little watered down. I also did not notice much of a rye influence, as the dark malt seemed a lot more assertive. Boulevard produces another winner. What a surprise..not."
"A nicely done black IPA that utilizes the addition of rye to create a zesty twist on what is now becoming a US mainstay (i.e., the DIPA). Boulevard did a nice job in creating a well-balanced, subtle, and nicely complex take on this style."
""
"This is a really nice beer. It's very intricate and showcases each and every flavor well. This is a really solid black IPA but the rye is a tremendous compliment to the superb hop character. This is has good drinkibility and flavor profile. One of the better black IPAs that I've had."
"O - I had high expectations for this beer based on other Boulevard beers. I was disappointed. I would not turn down a glass but it would not be my first choice when looking for a black rye IPA. Wookey Jack has spoiled me."
"This is another great one from the Boulevard Smokestack series. A well-balanced combo of roasted grain, and a lot of hops. Get this one while you can, it's a limited release."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well made brew, I'm definitely going to try more smokestack brews."
"O - This is yet another fine Smokestack beer from Boulevard."
"Overall: It is definitetly an IPA but is tempered by the rye. I have never personally had a rye beer but this seems to be a good hybrid between the two. I think this could be a good hybrid of the two styles. This is a seasonal beer but will surely buy a couple of bottles every year."

"Overall. This style is quickly becoming one of may favorites and brewers are doing a great job with it. This is a great example of the style."

"Once again, another smokestack series beer that is top notch."

"maybe the most appropriately named beer to come out in awhile. the malt bill on this is colossal, and the rye malt is so intense, huge body, super yum. the pour is thick and dark. milkshakey with a deep fain red brown depth, pushing up on black, with a mocha colored soft head maybe four inches high and long lasting. amazing. the nose is grainy as hell, spicy roasty rye and barley, a good alcohol kick, and tons of hops. pine and straight English bitter varieties, just a massive nose. the taste is really heavy malt with very little sweetness. some german and English doughy flavors, but mostly just roasted American two row and brutally intense rye, black as black can be. hopped well, bitter in the finish but bittersweet cocoay throughout. long finish of beautiful complexity and some surly attitude. a well hidden abv, but you could hide anthrax, your girlfriend's rolodex, and a shorty of cheap vodka in this one without affecting the flavor. no joke. full as a body can be, but made mild my the carbonation which is really active and creamy, almost akin to a nitro dispense. drinkable on your own, but a good bottle to share too. overall an impressive beer, the smokestack series kills it. I also found this on my roof after an enjoyable scavenger hunt for valentines day, which only sweetened the pot..."

"O: Another good entry in the Smokestack Series. Very nuanced and complex for a rye beer. They got the rye right in this one, the complex flavors are balanced and let the rye shine through. Well done."
"Overall: great beer. Complex, malty, hop forward. Buy fresh and drink now."
"Overall I cannot believe how much I like this beer. Very similar to Mountain Stardard in that I just like it."

"Smooth and dry, the taste starts with a darkly toasted malt (and just a hint of bitter chocolate). The body is modestly rich. The carbonation is below average. The finish is black pepper bitterness. The aftertaste of dark cocoa and hop is quite short for what one would expect."
"Overall- While I am not a fan of IPAs, I am starting to develop an appreciation for some ""Black IPAs."" This is one of the better ones that I have tried. Well balanced with the rye adding a nice twist."
""
"Overall- A real interesting black rye ipa. The rye isn't too sharp and the hops are not too aggressive. well balanced and quite tasty, I would recommend giving this one a try"
""
"Another outstanding delivery from the folks at Boulevard - really proud to call them a KC brewery."

"The spicy rye character adds an interesting twist to the American black ale. A nice hop profile with spicy rye taking the place of the expected roasty malts. A oleasant experience overall but a little more roast and dialing back the carbonation by 30-40% would really help this stand out in my opinion."
"Very drinkable, no mattter how you slice it. I like this one a lot"

"91 = A-"
"An easy drinker, yet I've had better Black IPAs, but this is a nice transitional BIPA for a new comer to IPAs... Recommended for an easy price of ~$10/750ml"
"Tastes of dark roasted sweet malts, caramel, minerals, peppers. Overall delicious, rich and yummy. There's a tongue piercing mouthfeel even after 10 minutes but the delicious dark sweet roasted malts remain prominent and tasty."
""
"O- A great beer though the look and feel outweighs the taste."

"I may rate this higher in the future, I just need to try a couple more bottles, because it's such an interesting beer."

"Boulevard has a hit on their hands."
