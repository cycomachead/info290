"Cloyingly bitter for a beer by this brewery. Not an enjoyable drinking experience."
"Least impressive mouthfeel I've ever had from HF, as well.  The 9.5% is not particularly well hidden at all; you can feel every bit of it. Detracts from that normal creaminess HF has mastered."
""
"Pour is black, faintly lighter on the edges, lots of tan head and leaves a huge lace.  Nose has a light roast, hint of sweetness, loads of citrusy and peachy hops.  Taste follows suit, roast is light, faint touch of chocolate, load of hops, citrus and peach flavors.  Moderate bitterness, creamy light body, soft carbonation."

"God damn this is a good beer and I don't even like black ipas. So much better than James. Perfectly balanced roasted malt and hops."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste, which was just no-nonsense amazing. It was unbeatably smooth, freshly hopped, and as deep, and as dark as night, with enough residual sweetness and booze to perfectly round out the flavoring. The aroma speaks much to the same note, but is comparably subdued in robustness, but to no real detriment. The sip is silky, creamy, velvety slick, causing the mouth to writhe in ecstasy, waiting for the next installment. Looking from a distance at the entire project, it is hard to find cracks. This is one of the best Hill Farmstead beers we’ve had to date, and one of the most exquisite representations of the style we…have…ever…had."

"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."

"O- This was a fantastic black IPA that easily lives up with the other beers in the Society & Solitude series. There was a ton of flavors that came out and was perfectly balanced with an incredible smoothness at a staggering 9.5%. This was easily one of the better black IPAs I've had but still doesn't even come close to Jimmy (one of HF's Barrel-Aged Black IPAs)."

"Overall - It's a very good black IPA, which isn't an easy style. Even the best aren't great."

"Verdict: Yet another quality brew from Hill Farmstead. While rather tame at times, this beer is quite balanced and showcases the full range of flavors a well made Black IPA has to offer."
""
""
"O- This is the framework for a black IPA. Perfect balance between roasted dark malts and sticky citrus hops. Its not going to blow you away with any flavor in particular, but that is what makes it so good."

"Black IPAs aren't my thing, but from the ones I've had...this is a stellar example. Certainly worth a try either way, but if you dig on Black IPAs...it's a MUST try"
""
"O~ i'm very impressed by this black IPA, its one of my favorite styles and not too many brewers do them... right! super well balanced, the coffee aspect seems to push this one over the top for me. definitely one of those must try HF's!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easily the best Black DIPA I've ever had. Drinks almost like a very hoppy stout, and I really enjoy that. Awesome."
""
""
""
"O. Solid for the style. A tad heavy on the bitter black malt, and could use a touch more hop aroma. I guess I'm being picky, but this is Hill Farmstead! It's got a reputation and a standard."

"Medium bodied with an explosion of dank, piney hops that linger over the sweet and roasted malt notes into a dry finish.  Finally a black ipa that's hoppy enough.  Dry, dank and bitter with subtle citrus sweetness cutting through.  Underneath, there is some roasted dark malt for balance with sweet and dark chocolate, oatmeal, caramel and toffee.  Really nice beer."
"750 growler, drank one week after purchase and on tap at the Ann release. Appearance: Beautiful black pour with thick moka head. Aroma is roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, burnt toast but also incredibly hoppy and resinous. So resinous, it smells like weed. Taste: Lots of coffee and dark malts and also very hoppy and resinous. Full bodied and lively carbonation. Didn’t suffer at all from the wait unlike Double Galaxy. I’m not a big fan of Black IPAs but I absolutely loved this."

"The beer is near black with a thick, brown head. The aroma offers the best balance of pine and roast I have yet encountered in a beer of this ilk. The flavor is fabulous. A beautiful marriage of pine and roast. Additional notes of chocolate and citrus. Lovely malt body. Medium bodied and easy to drink too quickly. Alcohol content gracefully hidden. Typically not my favorite style, hut this one delivered. Another terrific beer from Shaun and Hill Farmstead."

"Either way this one is black with a nice amount of firm dark tan head gracing the top and leaving some notches on the way down. The nose smells great, rich and fresh with big pine bursting, nice grapefruit notes with some florals poking out with warming. A nice roast lingers in the background, where it's usually the other way around. Society two tastes like it should, hoppy, malty, roasty and flavorful with a nearing ten percent ABV. A nice mix of pine with some grapefruit and other light tropics. The maltiness increases as the temp does so cold is the way to go, if your looking for the hops. Hits of roast with light tootsie roll and cocco. Feel is a strong medium with a big bitter hit followed by some soothing malt. It's big beer, I am not going to lie. A lot going on at once. If you close your eyes, you would think this is an DIPA up front, but that black ale portion comes through just as quick and turns the table. A glass will do for me."

"O - Not my favorite style but I enjoyed this one,"
""
""

"Thanks again, Adam. I'm all out of Hill Farmstead. Can I have some more, please?"
"Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler or $18 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit)."

"Pours a delightful dark deep black with a finger and a half of brown-white head. It smells intensely of roasted malt with a healthy dose of hops. The hop presence is more floral and less fruity than other HF brews. The first sip is quite good, the richness of the malt doesn't overpower the hops as is the case with many black IPA's/American Black Ales. For an almost 10% beer, it goes down easy. Overall, a very nice brew. Second in my mind only to Stone's Escondidian Black IPA in the style."
"O - A stellar beer. I am confident in saying that this is the best black IPA I have ever had. Another beautiful beer by Shaun."
"Their self-capping bottle, re: half a growler. Very floral.A big roast, and also big citrus hops. The two are too much. Less hop kick may have been better and improved drinkability. Looks great at black body.Fuller mouthfeel.Suitable carbonation.Some burnt bits."
"Overall: Not what I was expecting, but really enjoyable. Something of an imperial stout/DIPA hybrid."
""
"This is a beer packed with flavor. Mostly hops, but enough malt to make this an easy drinking beer. A great black IPA that I wish was easier to obtain."
""
"Dark brown pour with a rocky off-white head that receded to a wispy layer of bubbles. Aroma thick with resin and hops, roasty malts and cocoa also detectable. Taste followed the aroma well, with the piney and citrusy hop profile typical of the style, in a great balance with dark chocolaty malts, caramel, charred wood. One of the better balanced CDAs I've had. Oily mouthfeel, can be a bit astringent and bitter in the aftertaste, but nothing too overbearing...a palate-wrecker for sure though, so make sure you do this either at the end of a session, or followed by a good water-cleansing."
"D - Very drinkable. The mix of roasted chocolate malts and hop flavors is incredible in this one. The balance here is just perfect."
"Another beer from Shaun that asks us to reflect on its art, and the source of our pleasure. I'm not sure you could ask more from a Black IPA."
"O: This is an odd beer that balances stout-like roastiness and dark chocolate with lots of piney hoppiness. Very nice. Hard to describe as it's not just a stout that is very hoppy, it's got a great balance between some stout-like characteristics while still keeping the beer very drinkable."
""
"A generous pour into a snifter generated a finger of mocha colored head. The beer was a very dark brown, reminiscent of a heavy porter. The smell is where this beer lives. Smells like the best DIPA you've ever put your nose to. Not sure of the hop variety, but there's a bunch of it. Close your eyes and remember the most outstanding citrus fruit dry hopped DIPA you've ever had. The mouthfeel is smooth and well textured, not heavy like the color suggests, but more silky than the standard IPA. Flavor is crossed between nuts, toffee, pine and malts. Finishes as bitter as a big IPA should. I'm not a hop-head or a DIPA apologist, but this beer rocks. This beer is 9.5% ABV? Drank the 750, no problem."

"4, 4.5, 4, 4.5, 4"

""
"Overall - Whoa.. one of the best beers I've ever had. The hops are very potent and the beer basically smells like a DIPA. I'd be more than happy if I could drink a beer like this for the rest of my life. Worth seeking out."

"Overall I could live exclusively on Shaun's beers. With his many successful varying styles let's add this one to the ever growing list. Brewed once but should be a regular in the lineup it's that good. Way to drinkable @ 9.5% (no booziness taste at all) which puts this in my dangerous category. Oh yeah!!"
""
"O - I don't really like the style but this is probably the best black ale I have ever had. The huge amount of hops really held up well with all that darkness surrounding it. Awesome stuff yet again from HF."
""
"Pours a dark mocha brown, near black with a thick, dense dark tan head. Long lasting retention and thick sheets of lace. Deep, complex aroma of roast malt, caramel, dark fruit and pine hops. Minimal traces of alcohol and great balance. Smooth, medium thick body with light carbonation and a sweet, sticky finish. Strong roast malt presence with some dark chocolate sweetness balanced by a strong pine and resin hop presence. Delicous. So, I normally don't like Black IPAs, but... I liked this. Thanks to me for opening this."
"O: a great beer with lots of wonderful hop notes. The roasted malt characters could be more present, but the hop flavors and aromas are so great that it makes up for it."
"Beer is medium to light in body, a good beer overall I thoroughly enjoy it. It has a moderate but smooth bitterness to it on the backend, a good beer, one of my favorite black ales for sure. I""d have this again."
"O - I was really impressed by this one. I don't think I've ever had an Imperial Black IPA that this kind of notes and flavors mixed together. There's no harsh char from the malts and it's not overly hopped...it's exactly what I would want from this type of beer. Simply a must-try."
"o - Overall a very good beer. Loved the nose as I thought the hops and roasted qualities mixed together very well. Would like to have it again."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice tan head and plenty of spotty lacing on the way down. The dose has a good dose of roast along with a bit of pine. Very complex and integrated. Flavor has great roasted malt and a nice hop complexity. Some pine and resin and slightly dank. Medium body with a dry, bitter finish. Really great."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Satchboogie grabbed this for me last Saturday, that was really cool to bring me back some beers. Pours a slick black with an amazing 2 inch light brown head with lots of sticky lacing. Smell is citrus, pine, chocolate, and grass. Taste is more chocolate than the nose would have you expect, a nice amount of citrus hops to go along. Body is large, good amount of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is a very nice beer, I am so impressed with this brewery so far. Lives up to all the hype."
"D - This is a really good beer. It's got the exact flavor profile I want from this style of beer, and none of the char or astringency that plagues other beers of this ilk. Would definitely get this one again - hopefully Shaun gets this into the regular rotation."
"another tremendous beer from Shaun, would have maybe liked to see a bit more malt presence, but the hop flavors alone make this beer as tasty as they come."
"O Nice ABA that hits everything I'm looking for. Very bitter but still a noticeable roast. Citrusy hops make for a tasty drink."
"Thanks also to Shaun and the Hill Farmstead crew, for obvious reasons."
""
""
""
"Taste is well balanced, bitter but it doesn't have that astringency I often find in black IPAs, really rich and it has a nice dry finish. Overall it's really good!"
"I have never had James, but I have to say this is delicious. Smooth, fresh hop bite, mild bitterness. The abv is extremely well-hidden. I had no idea this was 9.5%."
""
""
"Overall pretty friggen good. I haven't had the earthy piney hops for a while that was done as well as this. the hops, bitterness, piney earthy flavors, malts and chocolate all blend well together, and smoothly for a tasty delicious beer."
"O - Overall this was a very enjoyable beer. Good ipa notes with like chocolate and roast malts. Super crisp and refreshing."
"Wow, this might be the best Black Ale I’ve ever had, Imperial style or not! There is just a ton of robust and intense flavor here from the hops, malt, and alcohol but it’s all in harmony with each other with a finesse that I wasn’t expecting and helps make this super drinkable for the size! This is another stellar effort from Hill Farmstead."
"Big body, mouth-filling but smooth. Considering the flavor and abv, this beer actually shows quite a bit of finesse. Very drinkable for what it is. Hard to believe it is a double version of James, in terms of how it drinks."
"This is great. There is great hoppy bitterness and lots of hop flavor."
"Medium body here with sharp carbonation. Lingering sharp carbonation. Real tasty stuff here. Nice balance between roasty malts and fresh hops here. You really can't beat the freshness here."
