4.74,9.5,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste, which was just no-nonsense amazing. It was unbeatably smooth, freshly hopped, and as deep, and as dark as night, with enough residual sweetness and booze to perfectly round out the flavoring. The aroma speaks much to the same note, but is comparably subdued in robustness, but to no real detriment. The sip is silky, creamy, velvety slick, causing the mouth to writhe in ecstasy, waiting for the next installment. Looking from a distance at the entire project, it is hard to find cracks. This is one of the best Hill Farmstead beers we’ve had to date, and one of the most exquisite representations of the style we…have…ever…had.","TheBrewo","Jul 30, 2013"

4.62,6.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 growler, drank one week after purchase and on tap at the Ann release. Appearance: Beautiful black pour with thick moka head. Aroma is roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, burnt toast but also incredibly hoppy and resinous. So resinous, it smells like weed. Taste: Lots of coffee and dark malts and also very hoppy and resinous. Full bodied and lively carbonation. Didn’t suffer at all from the wait unlike Double Galaxy. I’m not a big fan of Black IPAs but I absolutely loved this.","Luk13","Jul 16, 2012"

A beautiful marriage of pine and roast. Additional notes of chocolate and citrus. Lovely malt body. Medium bodied and easy to drink too quickly. Alcohol content gracefully hidden. Typically not my favorite style, hut this one delivered. Another terrific beer from Shaun and Hill Farmstead.","Huhzubendah","Jun 11, 2012"

4.05,-6.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Either way this one is black with a nice amount of firm dark tan head gracing the top and leaving some notches on the way down. The nose smells great, rich and fresh with big pine bursting, nice grapefruit notes with some florals poking out with warming. A nice roast lingers in the background, where it's usually the other way around. Society two tastes like it should, hoppy, malty, roasty and flavorful with a nearing ten percent ABV. A nice mix of pine with some grapefruit and other light tropics. The maltiness increases as the temp does so cold is the way to go, if your looking for the hops. Hits of roast with light tootsie roll and cocco. Feel is a strong medium with a big bitter hit followed by some soothing malt. It's big beer, I am not going to lie. A lot going on at once. If you close your eyes, you would think this is an DIPA up front, but that black ale portion comes through just as quick and turns the table. A glass will do for me.","BARFLYB","Jun 10, 2012"

The hop presence is more floral and less fruity than other HF brews. The first sip is quite good, the richness of the malt doesn't overpower the hops as is the case with many black IPA's/American Black Ales. For an almost 10% beer, it goes down easy. Overall, a very nice brew. Second in my mind only to Stone's Escondidian Black IPA in the style.","vonnegut21","May 03, 2012"

Taste followed the aroma well, with the piney and citrusy hop profile typical of the style, in a great balance with dark chocolaty malts, caramel, charred wood. One of the better balanced CDAs I've had. Oily mouthfeel, can be a bit astringent and bitter in the aftertaste, but nothing too overbearing...a palate-wrecker for sure though, so make sure you do this either at the end of a session, or followed by a good water-cleansing.","Rifugium","Apr 13, 2012"

Smells like the best DIPA you've ever put your nose to. Not sure of the hop variety, but there's a bunch of it. Close your eyes and remember the most outstanding citrus fruit dry hopped DIPA you've ever had. The mouthfeel is smooth and well textured, not heavy like the color suggests, but more silky than the standard IPA. Flavor is crossed between nuts, toffee, pine and malts. Finishes as bitter as a big IPA should. I'm not a hop-head or a DIPA apologist, but this beer rocks. This beer is 9.5% ABV? Drank the 750, no problem.","wchollif","Apr 11, 2012"

Deep, complex aroma of roast malt, caramel, dark fruit and pine hops. Minimal traces of alcohol and great balance. Smooth, medium thick body with light carbonation and a sweet, sticky finish. Strong roast malt presence with some dark chocolate sweetness balanced by a strong pine and resin hop presence. Delicous. So, I normally don't like Black IPAs, but... I liked this.

Taste is more chocolate than the nose would have you expect, a nice amount of citrus hops to go along. Body is large, good amount of life, a little dry, and very drinkable.
