"Pored this out almost black and produced a nice two finger dark tan frothy head that has super small tight bubbles.   The nose is interesting.  A sweet candy cherry, slight roast, earthy, caramel, and some pine.  The taste has all hops in the front then you get the slight roast character in the finish along with a bitterness.  I get pine, earthiness, slight cherry sweetness, then the roasted coffee character comes in with a dry finish.  The bitterness builds and takes over the flavor (malts and hops could be slightly more balanced.)  Definitely a unique flavor for this style with a lot going on.  This one is worth a try if you like the style but be ready for a beer that has a strong pronounced flavor and bitterness, cheers!"

"BA lists Black Ale, but Greenbush lists as a Black IPA. Regardless, I much prefer it on tap at their brew pub to the bottle."
"Darker black body. Looks kind of like a cola. Big hop aroma with some sweetness. Lots of chocolate taste. Good amount of hop flavor. Mouthfeel similar to coke."

"SOLID; NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A pretty good black IPA, malts could be backed down a touch and hops up a bit to make it better. Fermentation could be a touch cleaner as well. But pretty solid, I enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This bipa pours a very dark mahogany body with a short lasting tan head and just a slight film lace. The nose is subtle and a little funky. Slightly hoppy but also roasty and dark. The mouthfeel is smooth and rather light. It could actually use s little more body. The flavor is not particularly hoppy mostly just light coffee notes and a little citrus. Almost closer to a light porter than a bipa. Not a bad beer but nothing to hunt down."
""
""
""
"overall, a very decent brew but not sure which way they are trying to go with it. very good brew, but more of a porter, no? black IPA works too, I suppose but either way it tastes very good. a little thicker than I was expecting, cheers!"

"A really good beer but a definite near-miss. It is gorgeous for a black IPA. As dark as a porter and the mouthfeel is comparable to porters - thick and creamy and very appealing. The taste is solid but not outstanding for a black IPA. Everything is good but nothing stands out. Roasted malt, a bit of coffee, a strong but not particularly distinct hop presence in the taste and in the nose. It is a well balanced beer for this style, which is nice - many are not - but black IPAs - to me - should be bold and distinct. I like this beer a lot and think it would be a great summer beer when you're looking for something a bit heavier. It almost but doesn't quite blow me away. But the price is right: $9.99/six. This will make it a more likely choice for me."

"O-solid black IPA, good flavors and enjoyable drinking"
""
"Pour is dark brown, fairly right tan colored head. Nose has a decent amount of roast and some black licorice notes. Light char and a bit of citrus orange. Taste is even more char, heavy and dark roast, black malts, citrus and hops behind, lingering bitterness with strong lingering char. Strong carbonation on a light body, a bit slick on the back of the throat."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""

"This pours a dark cola-caramel in color. The aroma is piney, dank, and slightly earthy with the grapefruit that I’ve come to expect in a black IPA. There’s a sticky, piney bitterness on the palate, with a grapefruitty dankness and a resiny finish contrasting a hint of roast. More, please."
"Anger is nothing unconventional - it's a dark, hoppy beer led by strong forest-like resins that are chased by a gentle roastiness - but it's a Black IPA with a personality of its own. Greenbush is the newest in a long line of Michigan microbreweries to impress the heck out of me - as if that state didn't have enough good beer already. I'm angry they didn't set-up shop where I live!"

"Not my favorite but a decent offering from Greenbush."
""
"Overall a great offering from Greenbush and enjoyable. Perfect for the cold weather season here in the Midwest when you still crave the hops but want something a little more robust."
"Overall, I'd have this again in a heartbeat. Such a great beer for this time of year, when you don't want the total stout."
""
""

""
""

""

""
""
""

"O - Overall this is a very straightforward, well executed black IPA. The appearance needs some work as the head is simply unruly."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: After tasting the Founders Black IPA, I was ready to write this style off entirely. I'm glad I didn't. I'm headed back to the store for a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is probably my favorite black IPA to date. I love the balance between the hops and the roasted malt. Most black IPA's are hop bombs with roasted malt. This is more like a hoppy stout. The hops compliment this beer perfectly. It pairs well with Metallica's St. Anger (song or the album)."

"I liked the aroma the most and the taste was good. I think this one was meant to be abrasive (hence the name) so I guess they hit the target. Pretty good heavy hitting black IPA. My first sample of Greenbush just a stones throw from Warren Dunes...heaven on earth."
""

""

"Greenbush is new to my market. I have tried three of their beers, and would recommend each of them. The Anger is one of the best dark ales i've had."

"Poured into Half Acre snifter. Pour dark cola brown with generous brown head with nice retention and plenty of lacing. Nose is hop forward with pine being the main note. Notes of roasted barley, caramel, and pine hops come through. The taste is mildly roasty up front and turns into a nice hop forward IPA towards the end. This isn't quite as bitter as other Black IPA, it seems as if the bitterness from the roast is well balanced against the hop profile. Some bright citrus notes towards the end. Nice flavorful Black IPA. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. I think this is very successful for the style. It doesn't seem gimicky as the roast actually benefits the hop profile. I'd drink this again."

"A solid black brown colored ale poured cold from the 12 ounce bottle. It carries a hefty tan layer of frothy bubbles on top and leaves a serious blanket of lacing. The nose picks up an abundance of deep roasted coffee chocolate malt and sea foam piney hops. Scrumptious! The flavor delivers a unique seaweed malt and light coffee with creamy milk chocolate. It has a slight mineral water quality mixed in as well. Quite unusual but it includes a solid pine bite that's a tad funky. The body is medium at least but it has a fairly quiet, almost aqueous feel with a very delicate/ gentle carbonation. One of my favorite styles and a more than solid entry here."
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a finger length mocha colored head that went away fairly slowly and left a thin ring of lacing. Nice balance in the aroma for a black ipa, but not overpowering at all. Get floral and faint pine notes from the hops, while also getting lots of roasted malts, licorice, and some dark chocolate notes. Nice balance in the taste as well. Starts with floral notes, some orange, pine. Then a burst of roasted malts come through and mix with the hop flavors. Start to get dark chocolate notes as well. The finish is a great balance of hoppy and roasty flavors. More of the floral, orange, and pine along with roasted malts and creamy dark chocolate. Get some ashy/smokey flavors as well. Do get that belgian flavor from the malts, but it is minimal and adds to the complexity of the beer. High medium body with a really nice creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat clean on the finish too: no resinous hop oils left behind. I thought this was an outstanding example of what a black ipa should be. Definitely hoppy, but incorporated with a hefty dose of roasted, dark malts nicely. Greenbush continues to impress."

"(O)- A pretty solid Black IPA. Often times I feel some of this are just too much like a hoppy porter or stout, but this one is well balanced and well-made enough to fit the style."
""

""

"Poured into becker pint glass; jet black with a huge tan fluffy head that leaves amazing lacing. Smell is bitter coffee and chocolate roasted malt, blending equally with sweet floral, fruity and piney hops. Smell is really hitting all the big notes, let's see if the taste does the same. Yes...yes it does. Starts off with sweet, smooth malt and slight citrusey hops, then suddenly smashes headlong into huge crashing waves of bitter coffee, chocolate, and hops. Finishes wet and bitter, with lingering flavors of coffee and bitterness. An excellent black ipa (or cascadian dark ale)."

"A great example of the style. Black IPA fans will not be disappointed. This is only my 4th beer from Greenbush, but thus far I have been impressed. Would buy again."
""

""

"O: I feel that what I wrote above may sound slightly more critical than I actually feel about this beer, as I believe it solid. However, it would not be my first choice in the Black IPA variety."

"Greenbush Anger ---4/5."
""

"Anger is one of the top American Black Ales out there, no question. This is a great beer that straddles two categories rather nicely. I order this regularly."

"12oz bottle, pours black with slight mahogany hues when held to a light, huge foamy tan head, excellent retention, some lacing.  Fresh, dank, citric and floral hops - mainly grapefruit, with some dark malts on the nose.  Tastes include an excellent meld of roasted malts, chocolate, biscuity grain, caramel, grapefruit rind, and pine.  Very creamy mouth-feel, bitterness lingers with roastiness in there as well. Overall, I really enjoyed this offering from Greenbush. I look forward to trying more of their beers."

"Verdict: A nice take on the black IPA, the flavors are balanced nicely, but don't really dazzle. It's a safe bet for anyone who likes hops or wants to find a happy medium between an IPA and a Stout/Porter."
"Not my favorite black ale - New Glarus's Black Top takes top prize for that, but those who like it on the hoopy side may enjoy this one."

"How appropriate that I'm drinking this while watching an AVGN episode. This stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by a solid finger of soft khaki foam. The nose comprises miscellaneous greens, light pine needle, and some very light roasted malts in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger sense of pine and a more robust roastiness, providing the balance so sorely missed in the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly silky feel. Overall, a nice little black IPA. 'Nuff said."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would go back to this one. Above average but not wow and fairly priced. Greenbush you have my attention."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the best black IPAs I've had. Unique, complex, flavorful, and perfectly balanced, this is a beer lover's beer."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/4/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, passionfruit, tangerine, caramel, toast, floral, light roast, and floral earthiness. Nice and interesting aromas with huge tropical hop presence and minimal malts. Taste of mango, passionfruit, tangerine, orange zest, roasted malt, light char, toast, coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical, roasted malt, light char, toast, and floral on the finish for a bit. Good complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; with a good malt/hop balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good black IPA. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; and smooth to sip on. An enjoyable offering."
"To the Point: I have had several black IPAs and this one does have a little attitude with the bitterness compared to the other ones. If you like to have an IPA with a little black lager – this is it"
""
""
"I don't know why, but I wasn't feeling the vibe on this one quite like everyone else. It was okay, but not something I would seek out or pick up again, unless I had a super-huge craving for a black IPA and there were no other one's available. I'd take both Shorts' black IPAs over this one (Bludgeon Yer Eye and Goodnight Bodacious). I guess my main complaint with this is that the citrus profile of the hops didn't mesh too favorably with the malt bill. I would have rather seen more herbal, ashy, spicy hops. Wish in one hand, I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, not wild about this style less a few examples. just had a short's double black ipa (goodnight bodacious) and feel that this is pretty similar except the shorts had a bit more heat and the hopping on the shorts was a bit more present and gave the beer a bit more character. this one is not bad, and worth checking if you dig the style, but for me, this was just pretty good."

"great beer, i'd give this one another go."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer. Solid! Has everything you could want from a Black IPA. Greenbush is coming. Look out!"
""
""
"I like the beer, but it didn't blow me away. It's a fun drinking beer with a really pleasant flavor. It's also an exceptionally good-looking beer. My favorite feature by far."
""
""
""
"I thought this was a good beer and a good and unique example of a Black IPA, it was nicely balanced with neither the hops or the malts being too overpowering and it wasn't overly bitter. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavor did a good job at holding my attention, but I couldn't see myself drinking more than two of these, this seems like a nice fall time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was enjoyable and pretty unique, I liked it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I don't think that there's anything that I would change with this beer, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy this bee again when in the mood for a nice and unique Black IPA and I think it's priced well, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Black IPA's. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it did remind me a lot of Rage, but much less intense which made it much more enjoyable. I thought this was a good Black IPA, I still think that Arcadia's B Craft is still my favorite Black IPA, but this beer isn't that far behind. I've been pretty impressed with these new Greenbush beers, it seems like all the beers I have had from them haven't tasted like anything I have had before and I really like that, Keep up the good work guys."

"O. The charred lack licorice taste left a bad aftertaste and a lot to be desired. I will not be having this again."
""
""
"O: This is my second offering from Greenbush, and never has a newer brewery impressed me like they have. I love everything they've done with this one, the maltiness, the hoppyness, watch out for Greenbush Brewing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It isn't my favorite of the style, but it has a unique taste to it... it had me thinking, and it really changes quite a lot the more it warms up. Wouldn't be my go-to black ale, but it's a very nice offering from a brewery that I have never heard of. Good going, Greenbush."
""
""
""
"I was able to try Anger from Green BUSH at a local tavern that just recently opened. The beer poured a dark nearly opaque amber with thin slightly off-whote head that left spotty lacing. The smell included piney hops and subtle roast. The taste started just as most IPAs ....a nice piney citrus that was quickly replaced with roast and then bittering hops that helped to cleanse the pallet. The mouthfeel was a medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall the beer was decent....but comapred to the Stone SSRIPA it was not as good. I would definitely have it again....and again....and again....if I see it in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Half finger head with nice lacing on a jet black body. Aroma is balanced with roasted malts, earthy hops, with light coffee and vanilla. Flavor is also fairly well balanced for the style with roasted malts and dark chocolate mingling well throughout with the earthy and slightly floral/grassy hops. Medium body and light to moderate carbonation. So many of these aren't very well balanced and either are more of a stout or an IPA but the balance here makes this a nice black IPA it's jut not complex enough to make it the best but still one to try while at the brewery."
"o - an interesting take on the style. not quite like any other beer i have tried. memorable, but maybe just shy of greatness. worth trying if you come across it."

"Black ales are often an explosion, like every member of a band playing their loudest note at the same time. Anger allows the individual notes of a black ale to stand out."
"O: It's about a B. Not the best BIPA around."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I want to say that this is my favorite Black IPA that I've had. Although, I really liked Stone's as well. I'd have to try them side by side to compare. If you prefer a hops-forward profile over roasted malts in your Black IPAs, then you'll enjoy ANGER. I do, so this beer is solid in my opinion. Well done Greenbush!"
""
""
"O: Very solid. Really well done with the green hops lingering in the background while the roasted malts and chocolate flavors were upfront. Nicely done Greenbush."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For a style I don't normally reach for, Greenbush has put together a killer ABA with their Anger. The hops are the first, last and everything in this beer, yet the dark malt really adds a killer complexity to it. Recommended."
""
"O: A nice Black IPA, better than most I have had. Neither the roast nor the hops dominate the flavor profile as it does on many others in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $7 or $8 for a pint."
""
"O- Great beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try this...really makes me want to get my hands on some more Greenbush brews. My buddy Matt clued me in on the great things that this brewery is putting out, and he's definitely right. If Greenbush isn't on your radar now, it will be soon."
"O- This has got to be one of the best Black IPA's I have had. One of my favorite beers from Greenbush and a style they do well. The balance between roast and hop without overdoing either or is something a lot of brewers could take a lesson on. Fantastic beer"
"O - A really nice beer. Easy to drink, and has great flavors. I really liked this beer a lot and find it a great example of the style."
""
"O - A really great Black IPA that I would keep drinking over and over. I knew nothings about Greenbush before drinking this beer and now I'm inclined to try some of their other offerings. This one is a winner!"
"D - A very enjoyable Black IPA, and much better than almost all of the ones available in the Chicago area. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Greenbush sends a few kegs of this one our way, as I'd love to revisit it without having to make the long trek to Sawyer. My second experience with this brewery, and they're two for two."
"I am a satisfied customer. Greenbush really impresses me. Looking forward to a Labor Day weekend beer stop."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer. Could use a little more carbonation, but loved the full bodiedness of the beer. Hops weren't over the top like in other american black ales. They stuck out for sure, but complemented the beer rather than overtook it."
"O: originally rated from notes on 7/18/11 at Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, additional notes and rating from bottle bought at Spartan Spirits 2/23/13"
