A sweet candy cherry, slight roast, earthy, caramel, and some pine.  The taste has all hops in the front then you get the slight roast character in the finish along with a bitterness.  I get pine, earthiness, slight cherry sweetness, then the roasted coffee character comes in with a dry finish.  The bitterness builds and takes over the flavor (malts and hops could be slightly more balanced.)  Definitely a unique flavor for this style with a lot going on.  This one is worth a try if you like the style but be ready for a beer that has a strong pronounced flavor and bitterness, cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","Feb 08, 2015"

As dark as a porter and the mouthfeel is comparable to porters - thick and creamy and very appealing. The taste is solid but not outstanding for a black IPA. Everything is good but nothing stands out. Roasted malt, a bit of coffee, a strong but not particularly distinct hop presence in the taste and in the nose. It is a well balanced beer for this style, which is nice - many are not - but black IPAs - to me - should be bold and distinct. I like this beer a lot and think it would be a great summer beer when you're looking for something a bit heavier. It almost but doesn't quite blow me away. But the price is right: $9.99/six. This will make it a more likely choice for me.","Qbdoo","Mar 01, 2014"

Notes of roasted barley, caramel, and pine hops come through. The taste is mildly roasty up front and turns into a nice hop forward IPA towards the end. This isn't quite as bitter as other Black IPA, it seems as if the bitterness from the roast is well balanced against the hop profile. Some bright citrus notes towards the end. Nice flavorful Black IPA. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. I think this is very successful for the style. It doesn't seem gimicky as the roast actually benefits the hop profile. I'd drink this again.","homebrew311","Sep 05, 2013"

3.99,1.3,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"A solid black brown colored ale poured cold from the 12 ounce bottle. It carries a hefty tan layer of frothy bubbles on top and leaves a serious blanket of lacing. The nose picks up an abundance of deep roasted coffee chocolate malt and sea foam piney hops. Scrumptious! The flavor delivers a unique seaweed malt and light coffee with creamy milk chocolate. It has a slight mineral water quality mixed in as well. Quite unusual but it includes a solid pine bite that's a tad funky. The body is medium at least but it has a fairly quiet, almost aqueous feel with a very delicate/ gentle carbonation. One of my favorite styles and a more than solid entry here.","Durge","Aug 17, 2013"

Nice balance in the aroma for a black ipa, but not overpowering at all. Get floral and faint pine notes from the hops, while also getting lots of roasted malts, licorice, and some dark chocolate notes. Nice balance in the taste as well. Starts with floral notes, some orange, pine. Then a burst of roasted malts come through and mix with the hop flavors. Start to get dark chocolate notes as well. The finish is a great balance of hoppy and roasty flavors. More of the floral, orange, and pine along with roasted malts and creamy dark chocolate. Get some ashy/smokey flavors as well. Do get that belgian flavor from the malts, but it is minimal and adds to the complexity of the beer. High medium body with a really nice creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat clean on the finish too: no resinous hop oils left behind. I thought this was an outstanding example of what a black ipa should be. Definitely hoppy, but incorporated with a hefty dose of roasted, dark malts nicely. Greenbush continues to impress.","brewskis","Aug 15, 2013"

Yes...yes it does. Starts off with sweet, smooth malt and slight citrusey hops, then suddenly smashes headlong into huge crashing waves of bitter coffee, chocolate, and hops. Finishes wet and bitter, with lingering flavors of coffee and bitterness. An excellent black ipa (or cascadian dark ale).","BurgeoningBrewhead","Beers"

Taste of mango, passionfruit, tangerine, orange zest, roasted malt, light char, toast, coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical, roasted malt, light char, toast, and floral on the finish for a bit. Good complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; with a good malt/hop balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavor did a good job at holding my attention, but I couldn't see myself drinking more than two of these, this seems like a nice fall time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was enjoyable and pretty unique, I liked it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I don't think that there's anything that I would change with this beer, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy this bee again when in the mood for a nice and unique Black IPA and I think it's priced well, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Black IPA's. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it did remind me a lot of Rage, but much less intense which made it much more enjoyable. I thought this was a good Black IPA, I still think that Arcadia's B Craft is still my favorite Black IPA, but this beer isn't that far behind. I've been pretty impressed with these new Greenbush beers, it seems like all the beers I have had from them haven't tasted like anything I have had before and I really like that, Keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 11, 2013"

4.06,3,3,4.5,4,4,4,"I was able to try Anger from Green BUSH at a local tavern that just recently opened. The beer poured a dark nearly opaque amber with thin slightly off-whote head that left spotty lacing. The smell included piney hops and subtle roast. The taste started just as most IPAs ....a nice piney citrus that was quickly replaced with roast and then bittering hops that helped to cleanse the pallet. The mouthfeel was a medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall the beer was decent....but comapred to the Stone SSRIPA it was not as good. I would definitely have it again....and again....and again....if I see it in the future.","WoodBrew","Dec 14, 2012"

4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Half finger head with nice lacing on a jet black body. Aroma is balanced with roasted malts, earthy hops, with light coffee and vanilla. Flavor is also fairly well balanced for the style with roasted malts and dark chocolate mingling well throughout with the earthy and slightly floral/grassy hops. Medium body and light to moderate carbonation. So many of these aren't very well balanced and either are more of a stout or an IPA but the balance here makes this a nice black IPA it's jut not complex enough to make it the best but still one to try while at the brewery.","kylehay2004","Nov 07, 2012"

If you prefer a hops-forward profile over roasted malts in your Black IPAs, then you'll enjoy ANGER. I do, so this beer is solid in my opinion. Well done Greenbush!","genuinedisciple","Jun 23, 2012"
