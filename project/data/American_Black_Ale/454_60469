I get an upfront roasty malt profile with a pronounced roast on the palate cut by some bitterness and a touch of piney grapefruit hops. It’s malty and more sweet than dry, with enough going on to place it in my mind as more ‘hoppy porter’ than ‘black IPA.’ Tasty and enjoyable even as it warms.","elNopalero","Jan 20, 2015"

There are also detectable notes of dark fruit and leather, even some peat, which goes way against this one being a “black IPA”. But that’s splitting hairs. This is a bold and boozy brew (at 8.5%) and not one I’d care to revisit.","secondtooth","Dec 02, 2014"

When all is said and done, this comes across as more of a lighter stout--high in coffee flavors, low in body, high in carbonation--than anything like a DIPA. I don't worry too much about styles but when drinking this one, it's obvious that they were going for something that didn't quite happen. Still a tasty beverage that just falls short a bit.","krustster","Dec 02, 2013"

Scents of chocolately malt are balanced with a more delicate smelling hop profile. Taste is of dark, thick, almost lactic malts very well balanced with a lighter hop component - very un-IPA like. But I love it for that, its quite well balanced. Mouthfeel is where it really shines though, very smooth, thick and creamy like that of a milk stout. Well recommended, a surprising brew and very well put together, likely my favorite from Arcadia yet.","srv33","Aug 13, 2013"

This stuff pours a deep, dark sienna topped by a finger of tan-cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light blackened pretzel, dry pine resin, and a touch of straight booze tossed in for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, softening the resin, getting rid of the booze entirely, and adding a faint hint of hickory smoke. Nice. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice black IPA, one that lived up to my pleasant memories in every way save the smell (which, to be fair, was probably getting pretty weak by the time I got to this one last year...).","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2013"

I am not the biggest licorice fan (but have grown to appreciate it in other beers), so this still may be one for you to seek out. Despite the slightly below average rating in taste (made with style heavily in mind), I think this is a slightly above average beer overall.

Wild ride, but comes together nicely collectively. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and resinous, finishes bitter, but rather refreshing. Alcohol is well concealed.

Moderate citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange rind, pine, chocolate, roasted malt, and herbal on the finish for a while.

This beer had great drinkability it was very smooth and hardly had any bitterness which I wasn't expecting, this beer went down way faster and if I had another one I would for sure drink it, the alcohol was hidden very well also, there's no doubt that a couple of these would for sure hit the spot. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I can't think of anything I would want to change, it's great just the way it is. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I wish it was just a little cheaper, but with a limited release I can't really complain. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I will be getting more in day or two and I highly recommend this beer to just about anyone, it's just that damn good. Arcadia did an awesome job with this beer, I have found that they can be hit or miss sometimes, but in this case it was a huge hit, I am now a big fan of this beer, and I think it's pretty safe to say that this is now my favorite American Black Ale, and one of my favorite beers from Arcadia, North Peak's Furry used to be my favorite but this beer is better in almost every aspect, I am glad they bottled this beer, I can see a lot more of this beer in my future.","StoutHunter","May 15, 2012"
