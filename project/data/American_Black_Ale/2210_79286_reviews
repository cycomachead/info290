"This is another delicious beer by Firestone Walker.  A darker style IPA, with some subtle Rye ""pepperiness""...but candidly, in a blind taste test, I think most would just call it a near perfect IPA.  I love the look in the glass, and even better in my mouth!  These Brewers have established themselves as a personal favorite of mine, and I can't wait to try all their beers.  Check the dates and get them as fresh as possible.  Credit to the Brewers for making the dating so clear and straightforward...it makes a difference, IMO."

"Was a bit harsh to me"
"This isn't a hoppy beer, but you can still tell it's an IPA. Drinks like a stout with the bittered finish of an IPA. These black IPA's aren't one of my favorite styles, because I feel like so many breweries try to lean to one side; this one is a perfect blend of hops/pine/fruit and malt/chocolate."

"Overall: This is the second FW beer iv had, the first being Union Jack, both being around 8 months since bottling. Of course the hops in union Jack had already fallen off and ended up with a malty mess, but i thought Wookey would hold up a little better. I suppose the hops in here fell off too and was left with a semi hoppy black ipa. As it warms i get little hints of what i imagine it is like fresh. I like how the flavors linger on the pallet for a while. As is, i enjoyed Lagunitas NightTime much more than this. Ill seek out a not so hoppy FW beer next time since i can't get their beers fresh."
""
"Lots of hop aroma, with a well balanced hop&roasted malt taste...outstanding"
""
""
"I really liked this beer.  Nice dark chocolate color and a 2 finger head with staying power and minimal lacing.  Taste was surprisingly smooth considering the 8.3 ABV.  I'm not a big fan of smokiness but felt they hit it just right.  Not too bitter of a bite so I came back for more quickly and polished the bomber off in 20-25 mins.  Purchased at Costco for $5.99 and well worth it."

"Feel: medium plus body,  big head retention pours a thick creamy head, has a creamy mouth feel. Overall I would like to try this beer fresher I am drinking it on the last day of its best by date , I wonder if that has something to do with the muted taste. It is not my favorite beer but it is a well done beer."
""
""
""
"I'm not that big of a fan of black or rye IPAs that I've tried but Wookey Jack is making me reconsider that belief."
""
"Smells great good citrus hops. Tastes great good hoppy taste needing just a bit more rye for my taste leaves a slight after taste but not an offensive one.. Overall out of ten i give it a solid  9.5 with the lack of rye being the main reason it isn't higher."
""

"This is a big well balanced smooth beer. Smells of hops, pine and chocolate.  nice butter mouth feel. Tastes like a hoppy chocolate porter."
"A great beer. Definitely an acquired taste. I usually don't enjoy these types of beers but this one was so smooth and tasty. Has a very robust flavor."
""
""
"Black, only letting a little redness show through. Smells overwhelmingly like an IPA.  Citrusy, piney notes with a little roastiness behind it. This tastes good.  Floral and pine like hops leave a medium bitterness and then there is kind of a roasted aftertaste.  Nice mouthfeel on this.  Very good black IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you believe that some is good and more is better, you're going to love this beer. Firestone tells us that Wookey Jack is a Black Rye IPA. I would have guessed a hoppy California Porter. Regardless, this is one big, tasty ale."

"Opaque black pour from large format bottle - fantastic mixture of rye sourness & hops on both the aroma & taste - not a very heavy mouthfeel but really smooth. I would have wished for a tiny bit more bitterness, but I'm not complaining, this is fine beer."

"O: Fantastic stuff. Similar, but completely different then the other black IPAs. Unique and worth exploring... begins to blur the line between IPAs and Porters."
"Pours a dark black with hints of red and brown with a creamy coffee color head that has great lacing and retention.  Aroma is amazing, packed with citrus fruit and hops.  Taste is great with the citrus fruit being balanced by roasted malts and a quick hit of spice from the rye.  Overall one of the best black ipas I've had, although I would like a little more bitterness, which is why it isn't rated a 5."
""
""
"Great beer, Love this stuff"
"Color is dark brown with a two finger tan head.  Good retention and creamy semi-sticky lacing.  Aroma is good, lots of roasted malt, citrus and some rye. Flavor follows the nose, along with some coffee notes.  Finish is mildly bitter and dry.  Body is medium with a creamy mouthfeel that makes it easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really rich and chewy, every sip feels almost like a bite, actually. Rye shines, hops are rough, but with that nice crisp citrus edge, even extra fruity goodness. One of the best black IPAs i've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall -  really good very different black ipa.  Love the rye in it."

""
"O: wow, is this good!"
""
"This one is definitely one of my favorites!"
""
"Good black rye IPA. Buy again"
"Overall:  I typically do not like dark ipa.  This is an exception.  Not a lot of roast.  No harsh bitterness from the dark grain.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown/black with light tan head.  Smells mostly of  pine and roast malt with some light citrus.  The taste is dominated by pine, roasted malts, a little mocha, rye.  Medium body and med carbonation.  Aftertaste is dominated by piny hop resin."
""
""
""
"very tasty, has the nose of stone ipa for me"
""
""
"2 months or younger, sublime.  Older than 3 months great ipa. Younger is definitely much better."

"One of my most favorite black ipas. So smooth."
"Just a great Black IPA.  All the Jack line from FW is great"
""
""
"Great black rye ipa. Hop aroma up front followed by great coffee taste that ends with the dryness of rye. The blend of dry, from hops and rye, with the sensuousness of the coffee/malt in the middle make this top of the charts in this category. Imbibed at Burger Bar in Las Vegas."

"O- Very nice Black IPA. I'm not a huge fan of the style of beer in general, but so far this one has done what I feel is a good representation of the style as a discrete entity."

"o: there are a number things going on here and they all seem perfectly balanced. an inviting smell, some pretty disparate tastes that somehow pull together wonderfully, and a pleasing look. this one is a winner for sure."

"Pours black with a decent tan head and minimal lacing clinging for dear life. Aroma is of roast chocolate. Taste is ok, but I expected a little more for all the hype and high scores that I see for this beer. Flavors of roasted caramel and coffee, some malt sweetnessw and some hops come through. For the most part, the beer is pretty well balanced, but the hops add an odd bitterness that doesn't balance well with the rest of the brew. A little off balanced and also not as bold as I was anticipating, slightly weak and some of the complexity that should be there is gone......."

"22 into a simple pint. Black with coppery tones and a tan head. Aroma gives the spiciness with a little hop and malt for backing. The flavor is a bigger version of the aroma. The spiciness of the rye gets in first, followed by some of the hop profiles that are less easy for me to peg down (can't claim citrus or pine as dominant, definitely not floral in my bottle) - perhaps rye interference? Maltiness in the back gives it a balance for these medium-to-big flavors. Alcohol at the finish is subdued, which I did not expect in an 8. A solid Black IPA effort, well balanced for the genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is easier drinking than I thought it would be, I was expecting something like Union Jack, that I think is hoppier and has more bitterness. This is very smooth, a nice citrusy bitterness up front, a little roasted character on the back end, but surprisingly very drinkable. I think I need to try more black ales IPAs to get a better understanding of where this fits in the style, definitely worth drinking again and worth trying."
""
""
"Yet another Firestone masterpiece. Never had a rye IPA this good (and I have had some really amazing ones). Never had a black IPA this good either. This beer is the best of both worlds. Good job Firestone, yet another reason you are my favorite brewing company!"
""
""
"Overall: Nice beer. I do like this black ale, black IPA, whatever they want to call it style. It blends the best of two worlds, for me anyway. I have drank a few but kind of backed away while summer was here. Now that we are in a transitional season and I want more stouts this is a good beer to bring me up to speed. I recommend it if you can find it. Its a good price and a very solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That is a superb Black Rye IPA. Original, bold in flavors and hops (80 IBUs) and still very drinkable. My taste buds are completely soaked. Recommendable."

"Notes of grapefruit, mango, papaya, resin, and fresh cut grass are countered by roasty, chocolatey malt in the aroma. Fruity hops dominate. Flavor is citrusy initially, with grassy and earthy undertones, becoming roasty mid palate, which carries into a dark chocolate and coffee grounds bitterness in the finish. Again, flavoring hops, especially grapefruit, dominate, but the roast bitterness adds an interesting contrast. Excellent beer, especially for 6 bucks a bomber. Notes of fresh cut grass and pine serve in the aftertaste for even more hop character."

"Overall / Drinkability:  A slow sipping beer.  To my surprise I only wanted one of these and I was done.  Perhaps too intense in bitterness.  Very good, but I think it wrecked my palate for the evening.  Went well enough with pulled pork BBQ, but wasn’t a perfect food match.  Certainly a very good savoring beer, just not a beer that goes well with smoked BBQ.  Perhaps better with something else, but I’m not sure what.  4"

"Overall - For my first offering from Firestone, they deliver a solid Cascadian. The aroma could of been a little more pronounced with the hops as I found it to be more malt dominated. Other than that, a solid Cascadian and am glad to have finally tried a Firestone offering."

"O- classy and delicious. Great pairing with roasted chicken"

"Dark almost black color from a draft pour.  3 fingers of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Strong hop aroma.  Mild and balanced in the mouth.  Loads of roasted malts, citrus, some rye definitely.  Little bitterness but hidden.  Very complex and well done.  Very different.  If you like ipa and stout, this tastes like a good marriage of both."

"Perfect black IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Overally this is a nicely drinkable beer and one that has a great deal of balance from the ingredients playing together nicely.  The malt could taste burnt but does not, the hops could have a stronger catty character but don't linger long enough to become unpleasant.  On the this is a good example of the style which I'll be happy to have again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"While the hops and rye were muted, this was the smoothest ale I have had in a great long time and it did live up to the expectations. Next time, check the date and seek a fresh one."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O – Black IPA has a lot of room for interpretation, and I feel like this is a solid example of the style. Malty, fruity, bitter, and complex. Very enjoyable."
""
"Pours a near-black, with just a hint of brown showing where light manages to get through. A big creamy tan head hangs on a long time, eventually settling down in to a nice disk, leaving tight soapy lacing. The aroma is lighter, with light roasted malt and pine hops. The taste, though, kicks it into a higher gear with roasted malt, burnt sugar, and floral and fruit hops adding to the pine. The body is nice and smooth, with just a little bite from the hops on the finish. A great black ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color with almost no head.  Smell is malty and grassy hops.  Thinner mouth feel with moderate carbonation.  Taste is boozy, hoppy/piney bitterness with hints of caramel malt, rye spice and chocolate.  Good overall but was hoping for more based on reviews and my own enjoyment of both union jack and double jack."
"Overall, solid black ale, but Baranof's is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Starts with a peppery, woody note; moves to hops, pine, grapefruit in the middle along with something like whole grain bread crust; finishes with a coffee-like bitterness. Roasted-ness and mossy-ness throughout."

"Excellent Ale"

"An amazing creation.  Better on draft than a bottle, as it looses a bit of texture.  This one spoiled me for other ryes, and I've yet to find its equal.  Tons of flavor.  Not one for the novice beer drinker."

"My favorite dark IPA so far."
"Perhaps the best Black IPA I've yet to have this has all the elements for the style. The nose is very fruity with tangerines, grapefruit, mangoes, oranges and lemon but a light char and piney resin all come together. The flavor is fruity as well with tangerines and grapefruit juice, oranges and lemon. The backbone is a sizeable structure of malty char that is balanced and  hefty. This drinks very easy for its ABV and  is intensely flavorful."

"Overall, just an excellent take on the style, and while I wouldn't say it's my favorite, it's one of the better ones out there. My favorite part about it is the way it's a very good beer when it's a little older and the hops have faded, but it's just a fabulous beer when the hops are still the primary element of the beer. The best beers all do this--change over time without becoming something uninteresting."
""
""
"O: seems to divide opinion... it mirrors many of the same characteristics as a few other marquee examples of the style I've tried (Yakima Glory, for one)... I suppose what makes this stand out is how delicate and drop-off dry it becomes merely halfway through each sip - maybe a little too... kinda like the PtE of ABAs?"

"I`ve had the Double Barrel ale,the double Jack and now the Wookey Jack and this is by far the best of the three.With a nice 8.30 ABV this will get the job done.Very good Black Ale.I have liked all the Firestone ale`s I have tried.Nice color and very nice smell too it.I will be buying more of these in the future.Keep on pounding the brews,Motley Drunk."

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. There is a grapefruit and roasted malt aftertaste. A nicely made American Black Ale. Worth trying for sure."
"Nice IBA. Good hops and nice roasty characters as well. Could up the roast on the nose and the hops on the front palate, but plenty to like nonetheless. I'm nit-picking, really."

"O - one of the best black ipa's I've had with all the great qualities of the style but also hitting the mark of differences as well with the rye and spice. This is probably the most drinkable black ipa I've had and one ill trade for again when its time. It actually saddens me I can't have this at my fingertips whenever I want it. The FW quality is there, the west coast style as well, but the roasted rich malt and rye characters throw you for a one of a kind experience. It's as perfect as the style can get."

"Other than Heddy Topper, which I've the privelege of getting my hands on, occasionally, Wookey Jack is, to me, the best beer in the world. I'll keep searching and I've got a long journey ahead, but my Chewy beer has set the bar high, for me."

""
""
""
"O: Never been a fan of black IPAs/American black ales. Honestly this is one of the better representatives of the style. To me it just seems that this beer can’t make up its mind, although that creates an interesting experience. The overall experience is a Potpourri of flavors that play on the palate like a hybrid brown ale/porter and an IPA. Pretty good, pretty interesting."

"Perfectly black with a full creamy two finger head, took,about three minutes for the head to fade to a persistent corona ring. Excellent balance of rye and hops bitterness with a tad of lingering rye aftertaste, less so on he hops. Smooth mouth feel with mild carbonation. Excellent aroma. Higher gravity takes this out if session beer status"
""
""
""
"Wookey Jack is a delicious beer that I am just trying today for the first time. I expected this beer would be good because, well, it is a Firestone Walker product. But it turned out even better than my already high expectations would have dreamed and I can see why others have stated that this beer is a benchmark for the black IPA style. Its beautiful appearance, rocky head of foam, full bodied complex taste, and just about everything else point to a beer made for victory in a critics taste competition. It’s one of the best I have ever tried of this style and I highly recommend it to everyone."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is a great beer. Black IPAs are getting a bad rap lately on this site, but this is an example of the craftsmanship that can really elevate the style to something elegant. All around great beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is a well crafted black IPA and deserved the praise that it receives. The flavors balance perfectly with a full mouthfeel of a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A great benchmark for the Black Ale/IPA category. A big bad beast of a beer but has so much integrity you simply can't deny it. This beer reminds me of myself in some ways."
"The hops are more pungent in the taste but not to the point of being too bitter. They are the leading characteristic on first sip to the lingering bitter finish, yet at he same time it has a milder dose of dark malts, rye, and creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
" Altogether this is a near perfect blend of all the good things we want in a brew, excellent."

"Firestone Walker describes this beer as an IPA for dark beer fans, and I completey agree. I tend to prefer maltier beers in general, but I found this brew to be a nice balance of hops and malts for a fairly smooth, easy drinking choice. The pepper was noticeable, as was the hint of rye -- neither were overwhelming, but made for a unique taste."

"Pours dark black .. Looks like a Russian imperial save for the off white (not brown) head. Light foam, nothing notable. Smell is a hoppy, but not at first. Sneaks up on you with a smell of wood and cigar to a light citrus..floral maybe..aroma. Hard to detect, subtle but really unique smell. Taste follows up with the aroma..definitely tastes smoky and stout-like when it first hits the lips, but as it moves through the palate I get flavors of maple, pine, mild citrus and honestly..cough syrup. Not in a bad way, just the easiest way to describe this fruity flavor I get that's hard to detect. Mouthfeel is thick, love the unfiltered style for an IPA. Definitely digging this style more and more with every beer I try..once again fsw fails to disappoint. Ps..paired this with locally smoked bratwurst..a win there too."

"O: excellent brew. Many different favors that work together. Better than mist regular IPA or DIPA. Rye comes through in a way similar to Sucks but that burnt taste really caps it off."
"Overall- Really perfect for a CDA. I mean, I don't really have any faults with this beer. You can tell it is made of good stuff and it isn't so lopsided with either the malt/alcohol or hop bitterness. I could see anyone who enjoys bitter beers but isn't a total hophead convert to like this treat."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and is very enjoyable. I highly recommend this one."
""
""
"A good drinking draft and spot on black IPA solid offering. Very good, another solid Firestone Walker offering. Black bodied, assertive carbonation. Average mouthfeel. Solid hops, solid roast,anise. Rye spice adds some edge. Roast aroma. Significant grapefruit."
""
"Appearance is a very dark brown, almost black, unfiltered, nice lacing. Aroma is hops, grapefruit, pine, a bit of caramel, very nice. Flavor is okey, piney, dark roasted malt, a bit of coffee and caramel. I feel like I'm in the lumber yard and inhaling deeply with my mouth open. Mouthfeel is medium thick, not quite chewy. Overall the is an outstanding black IPA, a style I am not familiar with."

"Firestone's Wookey Jack came in 8th in my recent 8 beer tasting of Firestone Walker's top beers. Out of the seven BA guys we had at the tasting; Wookey Jack got the poorest reviews with an average review score of 3.78. Unfortunately this beer was about 2 years old and was too old to properly judge. It should have been a lot fresher in all fairness."

"O- i was not expecting this beer to beat out double jack but everytjing about this is good. Haven't had very many rye ipa but i will definitely have to try more of these."
"O: A good beer, but confusing. It seems to fall a bit short of what the concept and appearance promises. Very drinkable though!"
"Overall: A great DIPA that would be hard to pick out as a black IPA if not for looking at it. Hides the alcohol well and the bitterness level is pleasant."

"Very dark black in color but you can still see just a slight bit of light gets through when held up to a light. Brussels lacing. A thin layer of khaki colored foam covers the top, perhaps not quite a quarter of an inch. Aroma of rye and pine like hops is very prevalent and beckons for a sip. The flavor is initially very bitter from the pine like Northwest hops, but then quickly segues into the spicy, earthy rye flavor. The mouth is silky and deceptively smooth."
""
"This is a hard review to write. I keep trying this cause I want to like it. Though I keep being let down. Certainly a standard for this style, if that is your thing. I have never been a fan with the clash of hops and big malts. After many tries, this is obviously not for me."

"Poured from bottle into snifter. Three finger tan head slowly faded to a thin rim. Nose is a blend of hops, roasted malts and rye. First taste is very roasty with a decent hoppy bitterness towards the end that lingers. It has a medium mouth feel and the rye is present throughout with a solid amount of rye hanging around after every sip. Very drinkable. Hardly notice the 8.3%."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first black ale which really appeals to me as it combines the flavor profiles of two of my favorites styles. The finish on this beer is amazing. I find myself savoring both flavors of a stout and IPA well after I've finish the swig. If you are a fan of both IPAs and Stouts, get this. Don't procrastinate like I did. Just get it and dwell in it's tastiness."

"O- This was one of those I know is a well crafted beer, but I just can't dig it. The aromas were heavenly, but the taste ended far too burned and bitter for my palate. I don't think I can recall a beer's taste deviating so drastically from its smell, which is really an accomplishment, I suppose. Huge flavors, nice complexity, just not my style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Black IPAs are not a popular choice for me, but I certainly have tried a fair amount of them. This one stands out for its balance and integration of flavors. When you have dark malt, big hoppy aromas and bitterness, as well as some dry, spicy rye it can be difficult to keep everything in check. You can see how this could become a ""tug o' war"" event on your palate with each flavor fighting to overpower the others. However, this beer was not the case. Everyone played well in the sandbox."

"The beer pours a foamy head head that is a milk chocolate brown that leaves quite a bit of lacing. The beer itself appears to be a jet black but under further inspection is actually a very dark brown. The beer smell is a mix between the hops, rye, and malt. The rye is the strongest of the three and is bolstered by the hops. The malts give a hint of roastness to the smell but is very small. The beer taste is pretty good with a nice balance between the rye spice, malt, and hops. The hops have a bitter citrus taste while the malts provide a nice roasted flavor to the mix. After the beer warms up a bit, the beer also has a slight caramel flavor. The rye spice mixes very well and its funk compliments the hops but does not overcome it. The mouthfeel is interesting. The beer is medium-bodied and thicker than an average IPA. The feel is slightly creamy. Biting carbonation. Overall, this is a great Rye IPA and worth getting. I can certainly see why it's high on most people's list."

"This brew pours jet black with a small tan head. Nice aroma dominated by american hops with a burnt malty backdrop. The taste on this beer is unbelievable. The burnt malt and hop characteristics blend perfectly and the result is a stunningly balanced brew. This is by far the best Black American Ale / Black IPA i've had to date. Another winner from Firestone Walker!"

"O- overall I didn't know what to expect from this, I didn't look up any reviews before I cracked it open and it blow me away, great black IPA, very complex brew and I love what they did with the rye also, I'm picking up different flavors every sip, overall they nailed it."

"Aroma: Not a whole lot on the nose, faint notes of dry roast, coffee and extremely weak resinous hops. Appearance: Black in color with fair lacing against the glass and a thin foam rim. Taste: Very strong bitter hops upfront with an extremely pleasing dark chocolate/fudge overtone the the middle of the mouth. The rye is definitely noticeable and it seems to be playing off the chocolate notes extremely well. There's some definite tropical fruit in here; possibly some mango/pineapple notes, not really getting grapefruit notes as you do in typical IPA's. Some more stout characteristics are here throughout the palate. Notes of deep, rich chocolate, dry coffee, super dry finish with roasted caramel and biscuit. Overall, this is really just fantastic. Super bitter, noticeable fruity flavors and dry stout notes. A+"

"O: amazing offering from Firestone and not what I anticipated. The focus on hoppy IPA and foundational support of sweet malts and dry rye makes this a perfect balance."

"Another new brew for me don't mind these guys but usually only see the small bottles and even though its not barrel aged ill take it and pours a solid dark brown with the creamiest three finger head that settles in for the long haul and ain't going nowhere with off white lacing everywhere this beautiful looking head touches on looks it looks very approachable,the smell is strong piney hops and I mean strong they really dominate with an underlining of black peppercorns,sour lollies and passionfruit,the mouthfeel is just under full bodied,moderately carbonated and addictive with a beautiful harmony of those strong piney hops encountered on smell layered with a sweet molasses maltiness,sherbet and finished with a calming passionfruit bittersweetness and when I say calming it just really levels out the bitterness you anticipate on finish from this hop bomb and overall what a treat such a nice balance not seen enough these days and just reminds me of how tasty this style can be also great endorsement for the dark side as I know ill be back cheers."

This is a great beer for a cool fall evening on its own, but would also make a great partner for a nice blue cheese or beef stew. Might go great with fried chicken as well. Good stuff."

"The best combo of roast and hoppy I have had to this day. Something about it is just so fresh and smooth, the flavors contrast but blend so well here at the same time. Bonus points for this general stylistic dominance."

"IPA...? Really, I'm thinking Stout but whatever, this is a fine beer! I have the fireplace going and Firestone fits right into this chilly night. The Rye is fine, why not Rye Stout?, don't worry, I'm going on a three brewery, three hour tour soon so perhaps I can figure this out?"
"Medium body, a bit slick and oily on the tongue with some light carbonation. Very much a DIPA, with just a roasted malt accent on it. Pretty tasty overall."

"The rye really shows up in the taste. Astringent, with the black patent contributing to this as well. It's not coffee enough to be a dark porter or stout. Also, the pronounced hop really makes this a great hybrid of IPA and a Black Ale. Moderate aftertaste of bitter hop and burnt grains. Thick body but this may be more notable due to the very low level of carbonation. Still, the whole package works very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like any situation where promoting the best qualities of a product where one's bias towards the perceived inherent flaws make said description pointless, I shall slog through and endeavor. So, this is indeed what it claims to be - black (i.e. 'burnt'), big and hoppy (the base IPA), and rye-offset (the use of additional rye malts). Oh, and approaching Imperial in alcohol strength - the integration there is something I can duly sign off on."
""

"22oz bottle dated 9/20/13 $5.99. Dark black with a ridiculous head, I had to wait on it. Aroma was piney and had notes of orange and spice, super fresh hoppiness. Flavor was spicy, pine, citrus. Very well done for the style and the price is super reasonable."
""

"Edit: Had it on tap at Firestone Taproom and while the oak flavors are more hidden the freshness is incredible! Outstanding both ways! My taste buds would melt if I could find this one on cask!"

"Overall, one of the best American Black Ales I have ever had. Some people feel this style is just a novelty, but beers like this and Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous go to prove that they are every bit as delicious as any style out there. Every time I open a bottle of this I am amazed at how well balanced and delicious it is. Drink Fresh."

""
"Make no mistake about it, Firestone Walker has worked really hard to ensure that Wookey Jack wouldn't succumb to just a hoppy Porter, they go in with a dedication to it being an IPA first and allowing the complex char to complement the grilled fruit aromas, heightened bitterness and roasty dryness with pin-point precision."

""
"O - A really fantastic beer from FW. Huge complexity of aroma and flavor, nothing overpowering."
""
"This is a complex and very tasty beer from Firestone Walker. All Black IPAs should be this good."
""
"Overall: I very seldom write full reviews, unless the beer has never been rated here, but I thought this deserved a write up and a straight 5/5. I don't get this enthusiastic about a beer often. Stouts are usually my thing and their heaviness often helps with the sophistication, but this IPA is complex enough in flavor without making any mistakes. It's something I'd reach for before my favorite Rogue beers, and while Lagunitas, Samuel Smith, and Speakeasy very seldom disappoint, I'm excited to try more from Firestone. This is a new favorite."
"This brew seems lighter than an 8+ percent, but it does in fact warm the drinker a bit moments after a few good sips. Overall, my expectations were fulfilled - this beer did satisfy me on multiple levels. I love big, complex beers and I like the delay effect the taste had on me. To get a perfect score I would probably have liked the roast turned up a hair. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who appreciates extremely hoppy beer with a twist."

"Pours out black with a thin, frothy milk head. Big PNW hops with somewhat clean, fruity US yeast in the nose with a hint of dark malts. Little booze in the smell as well. Taste is very hoppy. Lots of pine sap and citrus peel. Roast isn't that strong, but it's present. A bit too sweet for me. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is a tasty beer, but the sweetness makes it less than ideal."

"Poured into a glass a very very nice black color, with some awesome carbonation, there is a very nice one-finger plus thick, creamy, off-white head, with some very nice thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very malty, with notes of chocolate, licorice, toffee, coffee, and some vanilla. The taste is also very very nice, malty, with a nice little hop note, lots dark stuff. Medium body, with a very slight bitter/dry finish. Overall a very very nice brew, glad to have picked up a bottle in LV. To date the best ABA I've had. Highly Recommended!"

"I am not very good at the standard review so I will give my overall impression This is a great black ale from Firestone. Pours a dark amber and looks inviting. Tastes wonderful! Well balanced with a bit of warmth at the end. This is my first time trying and I will certainly have again."

"Pours black with a thick head of beige foam that fell slowly. Left some lace. Nose is not loud. Piney hops, a smidgen of chocolate, coffee, toasted malt. Grapefruit. Earthy, spicy and a touch of caramel malt. Taste is dark roasted malt. Gentle grapefruit that was a little sourish with some hop bitter. It's smooth and a little heavy not really crisp or biting from the rye. In fact the rye is mellow and not at all bold and has a mellow spice to it. Light resin, a little oily. Moderate carbonation and finishes dry and a bit muddled. Lingering bitter in the after taste with a touch of that grapefruit. I thought this was dull and could have used more pep and more spice."

"A: Thick head with staying power, significant lace, brown to black with a tinge of maroon – 4.00, S: Amazing nose, hops dominant the nose emphasizing the IPA part of the Black IPA, lots of grapefruit and some chocolate malts – 4.75, T: Hops jump to the front of the beer followed by a nice specialty grain charring, pink grapefruit and pineapple sweetness, mild espresso, amazing flavor profile – 4.75, M: Smooth and creamy, faintest hint of grittiness – 4.50, This is what a Black IPA should be, dangerously drinkable, all around a wonderful beer – 4.50"

"I really enjoyed this beer. Kudos to Firestone Walker for brewing a unique beer without taking it too far. It's not every day that I runn across an unfilter black rye IPA. I'd definitely recommed this beer."
"o - will def buy this again. quite a unique taste and one of the few black ipas i've found on the shelf."

"Poured into 34oz mug; jet black with a huge thick fluffy tan head that sticks around forever and leaves tons of awesome lacing. Looks awesome, and as a member of one of my favorite styles, I'm excited. Smell is piney hops, some rye, and slight chocolate/coffee from the darker malts. Taste is just awesome...smooth chocolatey malts with a perfect amount of piney hop bitterness and rye spiciness. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth...this is a nearly perfect beer. Alcohol is hidden entirely for 8.5%."

"Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, foamy head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is bready with some savory spice. Peaty and roasted malt, with some sweet and bitter notes. Great combination and balance. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
" The flavor hits the palate with lots of tropical fruitiness of grapefruit with a mild pineapple and tangerine effect from the hops with mild spice and some more citrus flavor as the dark rye moves in the fruitiness and slight caramel and dark fruit notes with a luscious lasting hop flavor which blends well with the rye foundation. Overall this is a great Imperial black rye the hop flavor is consistent with other FW beers -lots of flavor without overdoing the bitterness -I love that -a true pleasure to drink."
""
"Pours very dark with an outstanding head that disapates like a stout. Very nice look but the smell is kind of weak for an IPA. The taste is nice. I think I'm enjoying the rye, hop blend of this style. While I've only had two of this style with Terrapin Rye PA the other, I feel there is a trade off. Maybe the rye downplays certain aspect like smell and downplays the hoppiness but it does blend well overall. It's fairly smooth and drinkable. Because the hop presence is a tad lower I think the tongue burn out is less which makes this a very easy beer to drink. I enjoy this, but wish I could get it in a six pack rather than a bomber. I would get this again however."

"Neighbor bought a bottle of Wookey Jack from downstate Illinois. The beer was excellent. It poured a dark chocolate with slightly off-white/tan head that left a very nice lace. The scent included some hops, but was prominently roast. The taste was a roast chocolatety goodness that I didnt want to stop. There was enough hops to smooth the astringent coffee undertones. The mouthfeel was a medium to full bodied beer with smooth carbonation. Overall...one of my favorites!!!"

"Nice carmel red color full head with a dirty cream color there is light lacing on the glass. Mouth feel is smooth carmel with a nice bitter bite. Taste of carmel malts, biscuits dark fruits and full of great hops. Over all a full body easy drinking brew."

"Firestone Walker did a great job with Wookey Jack. Its greatest assets is its ability to showcase delicious hop flavors and spicy rye at the same great. The dark malt flavors complement those flavors extremely well. If you haven’t tried, seek a bottle out. You’ll be glad you did."

"This sets the bar for how these beers should be made. Nothing too roasted or malty and not a hop bomb by any means. Everything melds together and does so without weighing you down. I wouldn't expect anything lesser from these guys. If you aren't so much into black IPAs, give this a whirl. The caramel melds so well with the pine and orange peel, and its complexity yet ability to shift flavors over the course of time makes it easy to drink. At less than $6 a bottle, I will definitely be buying the next one that I find fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting a lot more here, but perhaps I waited too long to try this (4 months). I really like black IPAs and this one didn't do it for me. It was bland and a sub-par black IPA. I will try again with a fresh one later but this is a miss from FW for me."

"Pours jet black with a nice rush of creamy cocoa bubbles forming a strong, lasting lace ring. On the nose is piney, coriander hops and rye malt sweetness, hint of smoke. Taste is an excellent blend of bitter and malty flavors, complexity is high. Dark chocolate, juniper berries, grill smoke, rye bread come to mind. Mouthfeel is among the best i've had, begins so soft and creamy then the flavors run wild on the palate, finishing with a sudden perfectly bitter dry finish. Extremely well crafted!"

"Overall, this is an excellent black rye IPA, and one of the few on the market where the black, ashy notes mix well with the hops; too often they clash horribly. Well worth trying."

"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of spicy rye malt notes with some dry hoppy notes with light resinous notes. Taste is also dominated by spicy rye notes with some resinous dry hoppy notes with light dry bitter notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Really nice mix between some spicy rye malt with solid hops punch."

"O: this is a great beer overall. Big complex flavor profile but not aggressive, still easy to drink. The only knock for me is the smokey flavor as I am not a fan of smokey beers. But otherwise I was glad I tried this, good big complex brew."
"Deep mahogany colored and opaque. A beige thick head settles out quickly. Low aroma of citrusy hops. Flavors of citrusy hops, morphing to orange rind pith, mix of pine and rye spice. Good balance of hops and malt, leaning more towards the hops, but good presence for the roasty dark malt. Rich and full mouthfeel, creamy, finishes a bit tannic. Good beer overall."

"O- This is by far the best Black IPA I have had to memory because there is evidence that it is, in actuality is an IPA. I have become quite sick of ale claiming to be BIPAs and are really just black ale with no hops detectable in the nose or the palate. Would buy again. Cheers."
""
"A near pitch-black brew with a fantastic, rich, dark brown head. The herbal hops flow freely out of this one. Some dark fruity notes and faint caramel are noticed. Nothing out of the ordinary or complex with the aroma, just right on target. Caramel and bitter chocolates to the tongue and this one goes down smooth as hell. An herbal hop envelope helps provide a pleasant and non-threatening counterpoint to the sweetness. Some rye graniness and plum is noticed later. Medium-bodied at the most and the alcohol provides warmth but no harshness. Fabulous is end of the story."

"Quite a complex beer, but not too far from a Double IPA. I’ve only had this with Sublimely Self Righteous, which I really did not like at all. This on the other hand is a really complex and delicious. For a rye beer, I think I like Hop Rod Rye more, but just slightly. This really is an impressive beer. Not shockingly different enough from a Double IPA for me to really go crazy for it about the style however."
"This American black ale leans much more in the direction of an IPA than a dark ale of any type. While it lacked some complexity, it was flavorful and quite drinkable. All in all, a respectable offering from Firestone Walker."

"O-I never know what to expect from black IPAs, but this was a good one for the sort-of spicy meal I had. Anyway, this good-looking brew leans heavily toward the hop end of things and fans of rye spice should enjoy. On the other hand, if you like a little more chocolate/malty flavor in your black ale, you might be better served elsewhere. Final note, for an ABV of 8.3% the alcohol remains well hidden."

Got this in a trade and really wish I had access to get this again."

"O- very good black ipa. Great balance of chocolate, roast and pine."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, chocolate color with a one-finger beige head. Nice lacing. The strong hops and rye smells hit hard like fresh pine needles; citrus overtones. The taste follows the smell up front but it is remarkably smooth. A robust, full hops burst but not at all harsh; becomes bitter as expected at the end. Medium mouth feel, like a porter more than a dark IPA. This one goes on the favorite list as one to always have at the ready!"

"O: Amazing beer, pure and simple. I feel lucky to live so close to this amazing brewery. While some of their beers are uninspired (looking at you, 805), Firestone proves time and time again that they are simply one of the best breweries in the world."
""
""
"Nice brew from this brewer. This is a style that is tough to do right. They hit this just right, and are hop-strong. The off-balance here is actually appropriate and works well. Not overly boozy, and no off flavors. Well structured beer."

""
""

"O:This is definitely one of the best black ipa's I've had the rye definitely helps this beer stand out as difference but I am happy to say I liked this after being somewhat underwhelming by union and double jack. I highly recommend this beer a quality offering from firestone walker"
""
""
"22oz bottle with ""12/14/12 09:20"" printed on the bottom left. Highly recommended. Among the best rye IPAs I've ever had. Must try side by side with Lenny's some time. (interesting side note: though this is 83% as alcoholic as Lenny's, it's about a third as viscous.)"
""
"Thanks to this beer, I'm starting to like the American Black Ale style. The malted rye in this beer mixes well with the citrus hops, grapefruit, and pine. It was also nice that its not an expensive beer. You don't need to break the bank for this beer. Would I drink another one? I could go for another fresh bottle in the near future."
""
""
"Really a fantastic beer. Bold and intense with a lot going on yet the end result is very satisfying and drinkable. This here is a great big smelly hairy wookey of an ale and I like it."

"Nice pungent hop aroma with a nice roasty background. The rye really shined here and mix well with the hop profile. Good stuff. I did a blind taste test with another Black Rye IPA and the Wookey was the better of the two."

""
""
""
"22oz bottle with 01/25/13 on the bottom of the label. Pours a black color with a medium brown head. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is citrus hops, pine, earth and some malts. The taste is piney hops and hints of sweet citrus and roasted malts. Earthy. Nice alcohol presence. Bitter and chocolatey at the finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Tastes boozier as it warms. This is a well crafted Black Ipa for sure. Overall, damn good and worth having again."

"This poured a black coffee color with a thick cocoa-colored head. The aroma has a fantastic subdued grapefruit characteristic from the hops, coupled with a pleasing roast note. It plays well together with a balance I have found in all too few of the style. The flavor is likewise expertly balanced, with a pleasing bitterness from the grapefruit & pine notes the hops lend to the brew which is balanced by a light yet sharp roast character, all wrapped up with a delicate dry finish. Simply fantastic and I couldn’t be more pleased with this brew. Excellent job, gentlemen."

"Overall: This is a fantastic beer…I’ve been loving the rye’d upped ales lately and this one’s up there with the best of them…I’m not usually in love with black IPA’s, but creamy and flavorful with peppery rye backbone, this brew is outstanding…super drinkable, there’s not too much sign of the higher ABV…I had heard that this was good and it’s actually great…I’m definitely gonna get a couple of these for the closet to share with friends abroad…for me, this is “world class” and should be tried by any beer aficionado…there’s born on dates, so pick it up fresh (their website says within 120 days) and enjoy!

"Appearance is dark brown to black with less than a finger of tan head. There is good retention to the head, however and it leaves rings on the glass that are almost as thick as those left by a nitro-tapped beer. There are certainly hops present in the nose, but there are also roasty notes that make for a complex olfactory experience. The flavor includes roasted malts combined with some decent hoppiness and accentuated well with a touch of smoke (a pleasant surprise). The finish is not super hoppy, but the bitterness is enough to round out an exceptional drinking experience."

"Picked up a bomber of this bad boy on recent trip to CA. Bottled on 1/25/13. Poured into a pint glass I can smell the hops a mile away...wow what an aromatic brew! Very heady, bubbly and dense with a light tan color. The liquid is black with a garnet hue and clear when held up to light. The whiffs of aromatic citra and amarillo hops. That characteristic rye spice is also quite pronounced but takes a back seat to the juicy citrus (apricot) aroma. Taste is indeed hoppy but there is a big malt bill here. Nice roasted notes with a rye spicy zing. Plenty of carbonation and medium bodied the high alcohol content is definitely not obtrusive and hidden well beneath the ample hops and malt. Their is a slight bitter bite in the aftertaste but it cleans up very nicely. While enjoying the first pint there is some beautiful lacing present and a chunk of head remains. This is a good looking, unbelievably aromatic, well done brew. I've only had a few of the offerings from FW but am really impressed! Superb. The best black IPA I've tasted."
"This is good but not upper ecehelon, give me a Stone's itteration on this style any day, but pretty nice & very drinkable; the abv is well disguised. Will try this again if I can find a super fresh bottle. Had this on tap & this compares favorably to that if memory serves me..."

"D: This was a very nice rye IPA with a strong scent and taste, and a solid body. The finish was a bit harsh, but it was not difficult to drink. Yum."

"From growler. Dark brown clear pour. Nice citrusy aroma, grapefruity in essence but not a totally generic C-hop profile at all. Flavor is citric up front with a malty finish that screams ’rye.’ Not very roasty. It’s a nice idea -- many black IPAs have a hollow roastiness that doesn’t mesh with the hops, but Wookey Jack’s main malt note in the flavor is rye, a tried and true hop complement. Well done."

"22 oz. bottle from Yosemite Valley's Village Store. Wookey Jack is the best Black IPA I've ever had. The aroma is an amazing blend of pine and roasted malt. Taste is perfect balance between malt and hops. Slight chocolate flavours with hops coming out in sweet lingering bitterness. 8.3% abv is well hidden, you'll have a hard time putting down this beer!"
""
""
"a nice rye-pa from firestone and worthy of trying"
""
"O- I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this was quite excellent. I usually feel that the abundant amount of hops and dark malt don't go well, but this is the contrary. The hops and malt compliment each other to make a very drinkable beer. However, I feel like it's lacking some complexity."
""
"O: 4.5 - I know that many beer nerds including me aren't crazy about the lack of commitment from black IPA/CDAs but this one might have changed my mind; the hop character ~six months after brewing really impressed me and makes me eager to try a fresh bottle or on tap; although to my buds it's the best of the style on the market, it's really an imperial rye black IPA; makes me want to try to brew one just like this; Prosit!"

"O: This was a really excellent Black IPA."
"Oh, man I wish that this beer was a little cleaned up in the flavor. The rye gives it a spiciness, the hops are packed in there and very dank. Really liked this beer and would put this at #2 for American Black Ale's for me."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottle on 12/14/12 finally fairly fresh. Side note when they first released it to New Hampshire it was already 4 months and it did blow me away. Pours a really dark brown, with a one inch head, that leaves nice webs if lace. Smell is pine, hints of chocolate, some coffee notes, some citrus, and some cut grass. Taste is very similar lots citrus and chocolate, blended well. Body is medium, plenty of life, not dry, and easy drinking. This is really solid, especially when the hops are fresh and the center of attention. Going to have a Sublimely Self Righteous after and see which is better."

""
"Poured a pitch black with thick tan head and lace ring. Citric, almost grapelike hop aroma with some hints of roasted malt. Real smooth, easy to drink, caught me by surprise on that, not a hop bomb but the piney, citrusy even grapefruit hops reall kick in and are balanced by some roasted malts and a touch of sweetness that I can only describe as bitter chocolate. The malts lead to a pleasant dry finish, not overly crisp or bitter and this is a very quality sipper and great example of this style (as this style seems easy to botch, apparently)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Right off the bat, this is a beautiful beer. It's dark as night, and effortlessly produces a rich head that sticks around for a bit. Aromas are spot on for a CDA -- tropical fruit, pine, and tons of roast. It tastes every bit as great as it smells, and the bomber is gone before I know it. Another quality beer from FW."

"Re-review update (10-06-2013): had another bottle and found the body to be much better, more fitting for a dark ale. Also, the taste seemed better, more malty. Hop aroma and flavor characteristics remain strong per my initial review. So, I've bumped up both taste and mouthfeel by .50 from my previous rating and bumped up my overall by .50."

"Wookey Jack is awesome. Who would have thought that Firestone would produce such a legit beer. This is very well one of the to Firestone beers around and worth trying. The flavor is bold and hardcore. A very rich and complex beer as well and good on tap as well in the bottle."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beverage was its boldness, and nice mix of flavoring. The nose painted the picture of something curiously sweet and fruity, which was nicely intriguing. The flavoring, however, was a departure from this, with big hoppy bitterness, and drying pucker by the end of the sip. This made for a nice contrast, and kept you guessing throughout. This bitterness might get to some who may not be expecting such a bite on such a sweet-seeming beer, but this guy remains drinkable, and is a tasty treat."
""
""
"Pours blacl with nice beige head. Took an aggressive pour. Aroma of pine and citrus, pretty much all hops. Mouthfeel is thicker than I expected from the nose. Flavor of pine, toasted or burnt wood, smokey roasted malt. Sime spice on the end I assume from the rye. Bitter finish with the strong hops lasting. One of my favorite for the style."
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty beer with lots of rich flavor. Nicely balanced and easy to drink."
"The beer pours nice and dark and it has a very nice smell to it. All that aside the taste is great, I haven't had a bunch of rye beers but out of all the ones I have had so far this one is the best."
""
""
""
"O. It is very well balanced and nicely spiced and flavorful."
""
"O – Can’t stop thinking about the huge bouquet of an aroma this beer presents from start to finish. This beer has made me reconsider my tendency to avoid rye beers."
""
""
"D - Oh yeah, that's good... On of the best American Black Ales that I've encountered... I have nothing bad to say about this brew which is another outstanding example of Firestone Walker craftsmanship... All that, but I love the name..."
""
""
"Very sad to only have one bottle. Highly, highly recommend!"
""
"That's a great beer - there are a lot of new rye-based and black IPAs coming out on the market, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one this good. Oddly though, my affection for it may not mirror that of other beers I've ranked this highly - can't tell you why. The brewery? The style? No telling, just don't feel it."

"O: I'm really impressed both by the overall balance of this beer, as well as by the way in which the taste evolves over the course of a pint."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The big hops flavor is dark and pungent with some nice malt support. This beer is full of flavor but is very drinkable and the lack of bitterness in the finish is really nice."
"Overall - This is a spectacular beer, not for the faint of heart as it is very hoppy, and very complex, although in my opinion well balanced as are most Firestone Walker beers. This is a beer that will impress you with the pour, impress you with the aroma, and impress you with the taste. This beer will make you go out and find another. Try this, you will be pleased."

"Overall next to RyePA from Founders this one takes a pretty good take on a dry rye beer. I think if it was just a Black IPA I would love it more but don't take my review too harshly since I hate rye beers in general."
"a beautiful black pour with 2 fingers of off white head and excellent lacing. smells of pine trees, caramel, roasted grains. lots of hoppy scent. the flavor is piney bitterness up front, a slight sweet ruby grapefruiness, despite being a dark ale, it is very very sweet and hoppy. the rye just adds to an exquisitely sweet flavor profile. medium body, high carbonation with a nice stickyness and creamy feel on the lips. this is an excellent beer of any profile.. whether you stick it in as an ipa, a rye ale, a black ale.. it is fantastic for all of the above."

"One of the best American black ales I've ever had. Fantastically balanced, keeping both hops and dark malts in the spotlight equally. Dangerously quaffable for over 8% abv, I had no problems drinking an entire 22oz."
""
""
"Overall - My second pass at this beer, and I'm enjoying it more so than the first attempt. Not quite the ideal amount of roasted malt character I look for in what, in my mind, is needed for the perfect black IPA, but it's a marvelous brew nonetheless; one that continues to grow on me the more I have it."

"Overall: 4/5 Awesome beer from FW, Flavors balance out and the citrus from the hops is a really delicious treat."

"Overall a great beer. I think it's an outstanding example of an American black ale."
"The body is medium and lingers on the pallet. Soft carbonation. Overall this one is enjoyable. Would like a bit more of a hop presence on the pallet but this one is sound."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is spicy rye to start, citrus in the middle, and dominant pine bitterness through the close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is okay. Wish there was a bit more maltiness to support all the bitter."
""
""
"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a mini snifter. Pours dark brown with an off-white head. Nose carries a nice bit of roast and chocolate malt along with a bit of rye and some nice citrus and earthy-pine hop notes. Flavor is hoppy with a nice underlying bitterness and moderate malt sweetness. Good rye component as well as dark malt sweetness. Medium-full body with medium bitterness. Quite smooth. Very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the best example of a dark hoppy ale that I have had so far. Call it what you want, Cascadian Dark Ale, Black IPA, or American Black Ale...who cares, it's damn tasty!"
"O-Possibly the best black ale I have ever had. It has great balance while still being full of contrasting flavors that are right up front. Look forward to trying more of their beers."
""
""
""
"Medium body and average carbonation serves this beer well. Easily the best Black IPA ive had, although do I have to consider it in its own category- Black Rye IPAs? For now, until somebody does it even close to as well, this is the Black IPA."
""
""
""
"Wookey Jack is the first offering I’ve had from Firestone Walker and I can begin to understand why they are regarded so highly on this site. The fresh green pepper hop character reminded me of Hill Farmstead’s Society and Solitude #2 that I was lucky enough to sample. A very well crafted beer in my opinion which leaves me looking forward to the next offering I have from them."
"My initial disappointment quickly turned into satisfaction. Exactly what I was hoping for from this beer. More subtle than a Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous, which is a good thing. Recommend this one for sure."
""
"Overall a tasty and exceptionally toasty black IPA."

"Sadly I have only the one bottle. Right up there for black ales and another winner from FW."

"Overall, this is a really well designed beer. I'm newish to black ipas/cascadian dark ales/etc but I'm constantly amazed at the things that various brewers are able to pull off within the style, and this one is no exception. Firestone has a great brewmaster on their roster and it shows."

"Pours very black with hints of brown on the edges. Half a finger of a khaki head that leaves good lacing. The Aroma has big citrus notes along with some roasted malt. The taste has similar characteristics as the aroma but with some spiciness as well. Very complex body with a medium mouth feel."
""
"VERY GOOD, TREAT YOURSELF!"
""
""
"A wonderful beer! Perfect dark black pour with a nice thick head. Huge amounts of lacing on my glass. Nice toasted malt aroma with the piney/spruce smell of hops. Really nice blend of roasted malt to go along with the bitterness from the hops. Firestone Walker is making some great beers."
""
""
""
"O- this is an awesome beer, and rather affordable too. But what else would you really expect from Firestone?"
""
""
""
"Overall: These black IPA's play to my palate perfectly in that they bring together the best of a stout/porter and an IPA. When I'm neither in the mood for a stout or an IPA this fits the bill to perfection and this one with the rye adds another intriguing layer to consider and keep it interesting."

"O: Obviously this is a really great beer, and it is perfect for those who enjoy drinking IPAs of every variation. I can not stress enough, that a person should not view the color as anything other than color! It has barely any malt character. People who don't like stouts or porters, will have no problem drinking this whatsoever. On a personal note, I really wish that the malts would come through a little more. However, that doesn't change the fact that this is a really great beer and that ABAs are really open to personal interpretation."
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-bodied, with medium-low levels of carbonation. Resultant mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat thick, and creamy, with slight traces of carbonation. Finishes dry on the palate, as expected from hops."
""
""
""
""
"This is an intense, hoppy, complex beer. The rye is forward and peppery. The hops are spicy and herbl. There's a nice earthiness that settles the roasted malts. There's some woodiness as well that isn't as pleasant. Overall, a really good, complex Black IPA that's worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"First sip yields a nicely balanced brew, with a refreshing burst of hop flavor. Rye spiciness is present as well. Bitterness is quite mild and fades quickly into the malty body of this brew. This is a really flavorful, easy drinking beer that doesn't fit a set style. I'm really digging the hop flavors."
"O: A great tasting black rye IPA (as identified on the label) with a distinct and flavorful profile. Nice touches of dryness and bitterness. The tastes are quite bold on the palate. More high quality from Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a very dark brown, the head was a light tan color with a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer is nicely balanced with the roasted malts and the hops. The taste of the beer has a great flavor to it. The malts are there and slightly roasted but not chocolaty at all, the rye gives of some light spice and the hops come in and bitter the beer nicely but not overwhelmingly. The mouthfeel is great, it's medium bodied with generous carbonation with a nice smooth feel to it. Overall it's damn good brew. Highly impressed, would totally drink this one again."
"This seems to hit the bullseye for this sort-of style, it's black and it's totally hops. Not getting a repeat visit from me. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's in San Diego."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 7/6/2012. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, pine, orange rind, toast, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, chocolate, floral, and piney spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, roasted malt, dark chocolate, spicy rye, toast, orange rind, light char, floral, herbal, and piney spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus rind, pine, roasted malt, toast, dark chocolate, rye, light char, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity and balance of flavors; with a very nice roasted/hop flavor balance; nice bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic black IPA. Great hop flavor profile with nice balance of roasted flavors; very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable stuff as expected."

"Overall: An nice take on a rye IPA. Would consider drinking again, although I feel Firestone-Walker has better offerings (such as double jack)."
"Overall, this is a great take on the Black Ale style. Very good hop profile matched up nearly perfectly with the great rye malt profile and the awesome roasted notes."
"O - A fantastic beer. One of the best CDAs/BIPAs I have had, up there with Deschutes and Stone offerings. Really great combination of flavors, and the addition of rye to this style was an inspired and excellent decision."
"Even a slow, measured pour yields half a glass full of deep tan foam, decent density with an island of bigger bubbles remaining at the pour point, retention is very high, to the point it annoys as you can’t get at the liquid to sip it, the lacing is haphazard but what’s there is thick splotches. Dark, opaque brown hued liquid, slice of zinc orange at the glass bottom, few if any bubbles visible inside the glass. The rye is indeed present in the nose, however, on the whole it is sweet in a clean manner, pine, grapefruit, caramel, chocolate, scone crumbs wrapped around a core of apricot, peach, pineapple scents, fresh hops give it penetrating punch without unnecessary bite, admirable for its sinewy linger which never seems forced. Medium-bodied, the carbonation creates a tight weave but its active and keeps things bubbling along. Some rye, pumpernickel notes yet not very bready, once more relies on grapefruit, orange citrus, pine and flowers for most of its initial effect. Chocolate, molasses, anise only bring mild softness, instead it wants to stay erect as the leafy herbaceousness dries out the mid-palate. The roast mostly present as aftertaste. That pineapple, nectarine, apricot to papaya fruit drier here and thus further into the background. Taste-wise not boozy but there is a certain headiness to it. It crackles with the kind of energy and verve which makes you want to gulp as much as sip."

"Pours a pitch black with a finger of light mocha foam. Good lacing and retention. Aroma is of very strong hops, pine, coffee, chocolate, tropical fruit, with malt and some alcohol. Taste follows the smell quite well, fruity hop bomb laced with coffee and some other earthy floral tastes. Malt is most interesting coming from the rye, leaving a bitter after taste much different from that of the initial taste of the beer, which is one of the few flaws I find with it. Mouth is creamy, sticky and dry. Over all a good black ipa, not my favorite but deserves an honorable mention. The rye isn't something I much care for"
""

"O: Fantastic beer. I'm a sucker for Black IPAs and this delivers. The rye just adds to it."

"Overall - American black ales are my favorite style of beer. This is another excellent example of a ABA and something I will buy again for sure. It tastes like more powerful Stone SSR."

"Overall, very good. A nice hoppy Black Ale, well crafted."
"O- A very nice black IPA, very drinkable and balanced."
""
""
""
"Figured I'd give this guy a try alongside some other tastiness at Fountainhead. It pours a dark ruby-highlighted black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, pine resin, grapefruit rind, and a kiss of molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit really coming in stronger and being joined by what seems to be some lime zest. The result, though, comes across as clashing, with the roasty and hoppy factions unwilling to give ground or work together. It's not an altogether awful clash, but it's certainly bloody enough. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a generally solid black IPA, but one whose clashing flavors just don't fully do it for me."

"O-A great, great beer, if you can, go out and get it..."
"D: Very tasty. Nicely balanced. I would buy again, and despite it's variance, I'll still put it in the top 25% of ABAs for it's drinkability."
""
"D/O: A really accomplished black IPA, with a hops-focused profile that, while not exotic, is brutally-awesomely honest in the nose. One might argue that it lacks representation of dark malt, but that person must not like hops."
"Overall it's good. I like the way the roasted malts were sutle and complementory and understated, not overpowering. Some BIPA's are borderline porters and stoudts in my opinion, not that that,s a bad thing."
""
"Completely black in color. Poured with a thick beige foam that reduced to a soapy cap and left ample sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrussy hop aromas with roasted malt and coffee aromas fighting through in the background. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with dense, rich carbonation. Pungent citrus hop flavors up front and into the middle with a tangy hop bite. Dark and burnt roasted malt flavors emerge below the citrus hop intensity to the end. Finishes with a combination bitter hop and burnt malt aftertaste. The intense hop and dark roasted malt aromas and flavors are in competition here. The bitter hoppiness shows through more but the roaated malt character seems to intensify the hop character even more. An exceptional black IPA."

"D - A sneakygood beer. I've never had a beer from this brewing company, but this first showing from them is nothing short of excellent. This is a GOOD beer and I would absolutely recommend it."

"O - This is a really tasty rye black IPA. Another delicious offering from Firestone Walker."
"O - One of the more harmonious black ales I've had. Nice flavor and aromas. Would definitely have again."

""
"O - This is one of those beers that should be a standard. If you want to make a black IPA, Cascadian ale, American Black ale...whatever you want to call it, this is it. There are lots of black IPAs out there since it became ""the thing"" to do, but this one does it right."
"Overall: An excellent beer- one of the better ones I have had of this style."
""
"O: A really smooth and tasty black IPA."
"Pours out like a cola with a full finger light tan collar. Big tropical hops from this one....pineapple nose and flavors...as opposed to a piney variety. There's a little roastiness in the nose and aftertaste too but that's an artifact of the process to achieve the color...(dark but translucent). I don't get the classic grainy character of a rye ale...until the end. Overall...the entire experience is on the 'lighter side'..with a hint of rye grain..another example that color is not the cover to judge this book...or something like that. It finishes pretty clean...a tad dry, with a fairly intense grassiness that lingers nicely. At 8.3%...it'll sneak up on you. REALLY nice drinker...especially if you're a hophead."
"O: This beer is pretty good. It is unique, but I definitely couldn't have more than one. The hops are really intense and it is really sweet to try and balance out those hops. I'm a hophead but this put me over my limit for hops."
"Wookey Jack is good stuff, and definitely one to try if your into IPAs or Black Ales. I personally prefer its lighter cousin Double Jack, but this is a fine beer."
""
"O: Standout beer. One of the best black ales I have had. The flavor for this style is superb along with a perfect mouthfeel jets this one to the top. FW keeps the good times coming."
"Overall: A good not great Black IPA. I like the way the pine and cream interact. That said, I have been blown away by just about every other beer I have had from Firestone Walker and this beer, while good did not do that."
"O: A good but not spectacular that reminds me why I don't often drink the black IPA style -- flavors and aromas too often cover rather than accentuate each other and it can leave a nondescript product."
"o - first try, and an excellent one at that. this'll be a repeat performer i'm sure. If you haven't, pick one up!"
"Nitro growler from the Beer Boutique in Brooklyn. Like a take home cask. This is a black-brown viscous fluid that hits the glass and slowly foams into a somewhat dense, creamy, two finger head. Fade is gentle and leaves some nice lacing. No light getting through this one and as a consequence I have no idea of what the carbonation is doing. Smell is sweet and piney with a lots of roasted malt and a light banana like fruitiness. Toffee and scorched caramel flow into some fresh, yeasty brown sweet bread and hints of coffee and cocoa. Taste is so close to perfect it is killing me not to give it. Sweet and roasted malt front moves to a heavy dose of sweet pine hops that leave grapefruit skin and hop oil. Finish is quite clean and dry with a sweet dark malt syrup flavor and a healthy hop blossoming in the swallow. Feel is velvety and almost cask like with a superfine carbonation that while gentle is quite active somehow. Creamy too. Weight is surprisingly light and supple. Don't get me wrong, it is sticky and has some syrup to it but it drinks like nobody's business and you can quickly find yourself at the bottom of the glass. This is a superb version of an ABA, it hides the abv like a double agent, drinks like a session ale and has a perfect balance of taste with big sweet roasted malt and a pine dominant hop signature. Wow."

"D: this stuff rocks. the rye adds a whole new dimension of flavor that works great with the extreme amount of hops used. the nose is still super hoppy but it is not a complaint for me. great brew."
""
"Overall: Probably the best black IPA out there."
"O - This is what a black IPA is supposed to be. The rye adds a restrained spicy note, and the hop bitterness balances perfectly with the roast, making it a continuum of bitterness. My favorite part of this beer is the initial aroma hit - unmistakably american."
""
""
"Overall - alcohol starts to catch up. This is a beautiful sipper. From the 22 oz bottle, pour it twice into your glass, enjoy the early fall fire pit, and go to sleep. Nice and easy."
"Pours a black color with a finger or two worth of head with good retention. Smell is of medium roast coffee and citrus. Coffee grounds and a blast of hops dominate the palate, complexities come through as it warms. Fans of this style will no doubt enjoy this one."
""
""
""
"Wondrous beer! Incredibly light in body with just the right amount of carbonation to make this easily quaffable. Dangerous though, it's over 8% ABV, and while I get some alcohol burn, it's hard to care because it's masked by these wonderful citrusy and tropical fruits. A nice spicy note brings this beer to a finish and leaves me wanting more."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a deep cola color with one finger beige colored head atop.Great aromas of roast,earth,and pine resin,a littlbitter chocolate is there as well as the beer warmed a little.Big roast up front on the palate with earthiness and bitter chocolate,the piney hops hit hard in the finish.This is a big brash ABA,maybe the best I have had.Awesome"
""
"O: A decent Black Ale, but certainly not my favorite. Not sure I cared much for the interplay between the rye and the heavily roasted malts as each seemed to bring out the worst in the other."
""
"O: Love it."
""

""
""
"Poured into New Holland glass. Appearance is jet black with brown at the edges. Tan head with great retention and lots of lacing. The nose features lots of rye up front followed by subtle bitter chocolate and a nice bouquet of herbal hops. The rye is king here, very forward and present with notes of caramel hanging underneath. The taste matches the nose well with more of a roasty emphasis. The hops are also more present on the flavor as well as there is quite a bitter punch to finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a creamy somewhat hefty body. Overall, this is one of the best American Black Ales I have experienced. The rye works really well with the whole profile. Alcohol is nearly undetectable, definitely worth a try."
"O-Really enjoyed this black ale from F-W, a nice balance of flavors"
""
""

"O: Overall exceptionally smooth drinkability, big time rye flavor with a perfect balance of cascadian ale balance of piney hops. Honestly few reviews could do this justice with words alone, trust the overall rating. Wookey Jack is all that."

"O: Another excellent beer from FW."
""
""
"(O)- A solid to great black IPA; a solid example of the style."
"D: I enjoyed this brew very much, very unique. A great tasting beer with hops and thickness made the perfect combination."
""
"D - Really like this beer. The best black IPA I have tasted, I'd put it above SSR by Stone. I might even put it above Double Jack; what it loses in drinkability, it more than makes up for in complexity."
""
"D - More memorable than you'd think. Hits the nail on the head for the style."
"Overall nice, a lot going on with nice hops, dark malts, not too roasty or astringent, decent hops typical for the style, but no matter how good they are, all those flavors just don't seem like they should."
""
""
""
"O: You gotta try this brew. The hops are really killer. I'm not a huge Black IPA guy, but this blew my mind. Not much more to say -- it's all above. Great overall beer."
"O: Great example of the style (American Black Ale/Black IPA) with only the subtle notes of the roasted malts and the stronger presence of hops flavors and aromas. Very enjoyable, glad I finally got the chance to try this one after the fiasco of this being distributed in NJ."
"A very nice brew from FW, I will definitely be going back for more of this beer at the store!"
""
"O: While this beer is dark, it seems to taste more like an spicy IPA with rye because the roasted flavors are not that prominent. Nonetheless, it is rather easy to drink."

"O- After drinking many of this brew, I review as I enjoy. Rarely is my beer fridge w/o a bottle of Wookey Jack, a solid Black IPA."

"I really like this beer. Black IPA's really excel with a fresh grass/pine profile and a smooth feel. Throw a decent amount of rye in there and this is right in my wheelhouse. Well-crafted, and easily enjoyed."
"O - Not my favorite style, but I did appreciate this beer. Another nice offering from Firestone Walker, and for the brand alone I wanted to try this one. Lovers of black IPA's should enjoy this."
""
""
""
"Nice brew from FW, wouldn't mind finding some more of this."
"O: Having only had a few Black IPA's and a few Ryes I can safely say this is an interesting blend of both styles. I expected it to be more like a BIPA, and forgot about the rye until realizing how dry it was. It's definitely worth a try."
""
""

"O - My new favorite black IPA. This stuff is delicious. The hop profile reminds me of Heady Topper, which is definitely a good thing. The rye malt blends in perfectly. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty solid good black hoppy ale, worthy of another drink!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer was definitely good. I just feel that it missed more of the roasty and darker qualities in the flavor profile. It walked the walk, but didn't talk the talk. It still has a good taste, but gets docked some points for the imbalance."
""
""
"O: Highly enjoyable brew but I really wish that some more darker notes came out. Other than that, I find this one highly drinkable and the rye notes really shine though and are well complemented by the bitter piney hops. Overall, this one is well balanced, I just don’t find much complexity."
""
""
"O: I had a conversation with a friend tonight about this style and he said, ""I'm still looking for that Black IPA to change my mind about the style."" I'm thinking this might be the one..."
"Poured an opaque black color with a creamy tan head that retained well and left thick lacing on the glass. An attractive brew for sure. Aroma was a bit muted, but contained scents of piney and floral hops and chocolaty malts. I usually brace myself when I take the first sip of an ABA, but this one was surprisingly mellow and well-balanced. Roasty dark malts with a sensation of bakers' chocolate, countered by citrus and pine hops, that weren't too potent or resinous, as with some other beers of the style. I think brewers are finally starting to nail the ABA. Medium body, smooth and fairly dry in the finish, quite drinkable overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really great beer at a good price, I will probably have to pick up another bomber while it's around. The use of rye I think really wraps this all together nicely and makes it something special. Flavorful, smooth, complex and unique, definitely a standout black IPA."
"Coffee-colored brown nearing black with a thick, rocky ecru head. Pungent pine with a rough citrus rind edge juxtaposed against brown sugar and coffee grounds. Hops soften as it warms - grapefruit zest, green tea, and new evergreen growth. Dry and clean - goes down in gulps. Another great hoppy beer from FW."
""
"D - Very, very nice. The combination of pungent hops and distinctly dark malt is superior to the anemic black ipas that only look dark."
"Overall: I like the hop character in combination with the malts. Neither dominate, both contribute nicely."
"Served in a FW pint glass because apparently that's the en vogue thing to do these days. The beer is opaque and black, displaying a mountainous beige head that completely coats the glass with sticky lacing. The aroma offers roast, pine, and rye. Nicely done. The flavor brings piney hops with a slightly roasted malt bill. Alcohol presence is non-obtrusive. Beautiful chocolate notes linger in the finish. Without question one of the best examples of the style I have had. Recommended."
"Pours a solid black color with a huge creamy tan head that persists forever before impaling itself to the sides of the glass. Smells of hops, no really, piney citrus and resin with a hint of green onion. There's a faint roasty bready malt aroma that attempts to provide some balance but is really only there for show. The flavor hits with a hint of malt first. Caramel, bread, and chocolate are quickly pushed aside by a solid hit of citrus and resinous hop flavor. The chocolate comes back and lingers a bit in a sweet resinous finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice India dark ale ale or hoppy porter, very tasty with great aroma I really enjoyed this!"

"O: It's a safe bet that anything Firestone Walker is going to be very good. This one doesn't deviate from that thought. Typically not a fan of Rye beers, but this one has a really good balance of Rye, hops, and everything else."

"Immediate hop whiff after popping the top is very appetizing. Pours a dark cola brown/red settling to a very dark brown with a sizzling one-finger head....love the energy of this head. Initial smell is citrus hops with a bit of pine and a good dose of rye malt. Taste is more of the same, with a sharp carbonation attacking the front of the tongue while the hops, a bit of coffee, and caramel sweetness caress and soothe the rest of the mouth. Some chocolatey goodness coupled with rye on the back end. Carbonation is nicely done on this one, with a medium body rounding out a really nice mouthfeel. Overall, very well done, I will be trying this again in the future very soon."

"I normally dont like rye beer but this one uses other flavors to compliment the spicy notes of the rye rather than just let the rye be the only star of the show."

"Sweet orange and ruby red grapefruit up front balanced by bitter herb & grapefruit in the back. It all hangs on a heavy malt backbone with barley wine notes. As it warms dark fruit notes can be detected - currants."
""
"Overall, this is exceptional. Definitely better than Sublimely in my opinion. Must try if you haven't."
"The beer pours like a lovely French roast coffee with a white sand head with big rocky bubbles. This beer is opaque and has velvet midnight black in the glass with an ever so slight hint of brown to suggest very dark chocolate, though there are some light carbonation bubbles working their ways up the sides. Lacing is thin but sticky and gorgeous like a complicated root system splaying out beneath a lovely fat ring of soil that surrounds the glass. The beer smells dank and tremendously fruity with fat mango, orange, pineapple and even some slight pine. This is the best fruity smell I can remember getting from any beer in a long time; it’s like a fruit salad in the hops aroma and I am absolutely digging it. Further whiffs suggest the tantalizing roasted coffee malts and dark chocolate below the hops. All the smells come together to overall remind me of a fruit salad lathered in dark chocolate and coffee. The smell alone has me salivating for this beer and upping my expectations tremendously. The beer’s taste loses a lot of that fruit and coffee, but that is not an entirely bad thing. Mango hops are still the dominant flavor for me with some nice side character fruit hops. The dark malts are very sideshow in the flavor, appearing mainly in the middle to provide some lovely creamy roasted flavoring before being flushed away by bitter, less-ripe fruit in the back and aftertaste. A ghost of the roasted chocolate flavor does dance on the fringes, in between the undulations of the fruit hops, but it is quite light. The rye spice is also a ghost in this taste, only slightly suggesting itself as the beer moves over the tongue and lingering a little to meld a spicy burn with the bitter burn. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and almost a touch watery. I kind of want a thicker beer too help bring more of the roasted malt flavor. The mouth is left with a good glaze of saliva and a fizzy, bitter-bitten tongue that is ready for more, if only in moderation. This beer is in between a sipper and a chugger, but I would suggest a more leisurely sip personally. Alcohol is hidden wonderfully for its 8%, with only the suggestion of a bite and burn hidden beneath the bitters. Overall this is a very nice example of the black ale style. Personally, I would love to see a little more malt action in a black ale, but this is very nice more IPA-based black. I also would have loved to see more rye action in this beer, but again the beer worked very well for what the brewer was going for. The smell of this beer is one of the best I have ever smelled, and has me dreaming of big hops and malts. This beer is definitely worthy of a sip and is quite enjoyable."

"Wookey jack pours almost a solid black, with.just faint mahogany highlights shining through. Almost two fingers of bone colored head crown the beer. Retention is good and there's a fair bit og lacing left in its wake. The nose has a bit of dry coffee to it, and that's joined by a juicy pine and citrus aroma. The rye, which was undetectable in the nose, shows up in the flavor profile. It lends a spicy edge to the upfront coffee taste. The mid palate bitterness is fairly noticeable, and provides a nice transition into the finish. That close features a similar pine heavy/citrus light balance to the nose. It's just a little muted though. The body isn't quite bone dry, but it's definitely on the light side. The carbonation though could stand to be just a little more energetic. I've been conditioned to expect great beer from Firestone Walker, and Wookey Jack is no exception."

"at less than 6 bucks for a bomber and at over 8% abv, this is by far the best deal in the store, nevermind that its a fantastic beer! pours beautiful silky black color with a tall and lasting off white head. it lets zero light through and is shining like obsidian. the smell is a whole lot of west coast hops and some burnt malt. there is no chocolate or coffee in the smell or the taste, which i can usually find in a beer this black. just a nice smokey black ipa here, with the alcohol only becoming present when it warms up a little. it is smooth and warming in the mouth, full bodied, with average carbonation. it has a great bitter finish that plays counterpoint to the rich malt profile. this is a great beer and a great price, will definitely do this one again."
"Pours a very dark brown with a two finger fluffy beige head. Significant splotchy lacing as the head recedes. Some roastiness and chocolate on the nose in addition to orange peel and some grapefruit notes. Dark chocolate covered orange, citrus and mild roasty notes, finishes dry with some white pepper spice and mild alcohol. Medium bodied with abundant carbonation, and a slick and creamy mouthfeel. The addition of rye adds a bit of spice that adds to Wookey Jack's complexity. Certainly one of the better Black IPA's/American Black Ales available."
"o: excellent beer. Rye is nuanced very well. Highly enjoyable black ipa. Well balanced. Glad to hear this will be a year round offering from FW."
"It would be odd for these steady brewers to release a sloppy or thoughtless beer, and they have not done so here. It bears the Firestone mark of quality well."
""
"It's a damn fine black ipa."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a rather enjoyable Black ale. great appearance and mouthfeel really is what makes this go from a ""not bad"" to a ""would buy again""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was really, really nice. Lots of hop flavor, though the ""black"" part of the Black Ale, namely the dark malts and light roasted flavors, didn't quite come through. A better feel would have helped showcase what was there a little better as well. Nevertheless, I""m very glad I had a chance to try this enjoyable beer, or Doopie would have held it over my head for months. Cheers!"
""

""

"What a great beer. Very very hard to find any faults in Wookey Jack. From the appearance to the mouthfeel, near perfection. Best FW I've had yet."
"I'm very impressed with this beer. Highly drinkable and balanced. The rye malts are a key component. (4.5)"
""
""
""
"This greatly exceeded expectations. As much as I love Firestone Walker, I am not particularly enamored with some of their hoppy beers; I usually find them too herbal/spicy/earthy. Yet somehow, despite the fact that this involves rye, the hop profile is juicy, which nicely balances with the roasty malts. This is one of the best black IPAs I have encountered."
"O- What is there to say? Phenomenal black ale and a treat at any time"
""
""
""
""
"Edit: make sure it's as fresh as possible. I bought a 5mo old bomber at a very discounted price of $2.29 and it wasn't as good."
""
"Overall, a very good black IPA. Quite enjoyable."
"Overall: A damn fine take on the style. Loaded with the right balance of black and IPA. Huge citrus. Even at 2 months old it's got great depth. Rye is deftly handled and adds a nice element."
"Nearly jet black in colour, 1.5 fingers of tan head, good retention and lots of tight lacing on the glass. Smell is initially citrus and fruity hops with a secondary of roasted malt, a little bit of smoke and some spicy rye malts, as it warms and settles there is also a bit of pine but a nice mix of hops and spicy malts. Taste is spicy rye malts followed by pine and citrus, grapefruit and even a bit of melon, moderate bitterness mid palate with a bit of roast and smoke flavours. Light-medium carbonation, full body and lightly oily. A great black IPA that is spicy, complex and hoppy, perfect bomber to sit down and sip for an hour or so, will certainly revisit this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent black IPA. The rye really adds a nice level of complexity that compliments the flavors. The roasted malt is largely overshadowed, I think it could be even better if it were stronger but it's still great. I really enjoyed this one, pretty much has some of my most favorite elements all in one beer. I love IPAs, rye beers and stouts/porters so this was a guaranteed hit for me."

"Overall, this beer is tasty for the price, but I'll probably only have it once."
"Medium body with ample carbonation. Very slight warmth from alcohol. The combination is interesting and goes well together. Nice beer."
"O/D-Not in love with this one. Was expecting to enjoy this more. The flavors aren't my favorite, and they seem to clash with one another. Worth a try but I am left a bit disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black with a hint of dark brown around the edges of the glass. Good head, retention and lacing on the glass. The nose is a piney hop with a hint of smoked malt. Flavor doesn't disappoint with fresh pine hop flavor and with the malt brings out some candy or bit of chocolate. Sweet."
""
""
"O: An interesting combination of flavors. Roasted malt, rye spice and IPA fruit. They sound sort of dissonant but come together nicely."
""
""
"O: An amazing and really well-balanced beer with a ton of flavor and complexity."
""
""
""
""
" Flavor does not disappoint: bitter and lively with hints of pine resin and biscuit. Carrying with it some nice toast and slight porter qualities. The body is silky smooth mediated with tight sharp Carb. A nice beer."
"This is easily the best Black IPAs that I've ever had. Huge tropical citrus, spicy rye and balanced caramel malts. Only a touch of roasted malts on the finish which is slightly deceptive judging by the color. Well done!"
""
"Overall: Solid black ale to me. Never seen it, so figured I try it out on draft before it hits the shelves. Will have to say it is an interesting beer."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a nice balance of resinous, earthy hops, sweet and roasted malt and spicy rye.  Again, the rye adds complexity with level of spicy swetness that counters the piny hops and roasted notes. Grassy and piny hops followed by spicy rye with roasted and sweet malts underneath.  Hints of chocolate, toast, coffee and oatmeal lingering into a dry finish with subtle heat."

"O: this is a great brew.... I love rye ipa and black ipa's and this is a beautiful marrage of both.... Anothe great brew from Firestone walker... Loved it."
""
"O - I have been anticipating this beer since I heard about this year's release. My local store ifnally got it in this past week and I was not disappointed. Great citrus, pine, and malt flavors and aromas. Complex and balanced. This may supplant Sublimely Self Righteous and Yakima Glory as my favorite of the style. I highly recommend this beer if you can get it."
"O- This has to be my new favorite black IPA. The style is really hard to pull off, and Firestone does it with grace. Cheers to good beer!"
"A good drinking bomber, spot on black IPA solid offering. Very good, another solid FW offering. Black bodied, assertive carbonation. Above average mouthfeel. Solid hops, solid roast,anise. Rye spice adds some edge. Roast aroma.Significant grapefruit."

"This was a great pour. Pure black with some of the best retention and lacing I've seen. Taste profile is wonderfully complex. Very good mix of traditional black ale burnt flavors with a fairly hop forward taste too. Burnt malts transition smoothly into a subdued, yet up front hop profile that ends the drink with a clean bite. Creamy and not overly carbonated. Hides 8.3% ABV well, and is a tremendously sessionable beer."
""
""
"O- A solid beer worth the price tag. I will definitely pick this up again given the chance. I really like the rye thrown into the mix."

"O- This is definitely one of the best black ales I've ever had (2nd only to HF Jimmy). Nice citrusy aromas/tastes mixed with light chocolate and dark malts all balanced with a nice lightly creamy easy to drink mouthfeel. Definitely very fresh and I'm very glad we finally got this in. I definitely recommend picking this one up- it's a great beer for the price ($7/22oz bomber)."

"o- a real winner. i love this beer! arguably one of the best ryepa's out there right now for sure. beautiful balance. what a wookie!!!"

"Overall: I like it. I've had better and not much worse. It lacks a palate balancing malt sweetness to offset the bitter hoppiness. I would have it again though"

"4.0 D: Good beer among a wretched style. I don't think I would have given such high scores if this was any other style, but so it is. Making a black IPA that is even drinkable is already above average and this is one of the better ones."
"There are so many incredible beers out there, but Firestone Walker continues to impress me with every new addition to their line. I have never had a black rye IPA before but this one has set an incredibly high standard for me."

"Black IPA is starting to become a vague and broad beer varietal. You could label this a dark ale, black ale or black ipa very easily. Tastes like a rye ipa stout hybrid. The alcohol is noticeable but this is a relatively smooth 8.3%. One of the most unique beers I've enjoyed in 2012. Big fan of Firestone Walker and this does not disappoint."
"bottle"
"Almost black with a very dense, thick, khaki head. Really nice fruity hops to this. Lots of grapefruit and pineapple with a touch of pine. Some roast, but it’s restrained and luckily not really any chocolate. Mildly sweet on the palate, but a nice pine bitterness and plenty of fresh grapefruit flavor. There is some pineapple, but it’s not as intense as on the nose. A touch of roasted malt flavor to it, too."

"Final thoughts - At $5 a pop and a nice 8+% abv, this is one to add to your reviewed section and cellar. Yum"

Overall. not a Black IPA fan at all but I love this one. The balance and smoothness to this was very impressive."
""
"O- Awesome. Straight up."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark ruby-brown coloring with a thin, filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of rich, sugary caramel, with a smokey highlight and a tangy, resiny presence. Smells interesting and tasty. Flavors are a darker and heavier roasted sweetness in the backbone, with some plum and date characteristics blending with a roasted coffee bitterness. The hops bitterness then chimes in, with resiny and floral components. Very dark and well blended, presenting with a meatier and smoother feel than most Ryes. Smooth aftertaste of roasted grain and mildly bitter hops. Clean, slightly sweet lingering finish. The beer is easy to drink, and the hops flavors build a bit while you make your way through multiple servings, but overall it avoids being overpowering. Very tasty."

"Overall, excellent and one of the best beers I've had in awhile. Did I mention it's easy drinking and smooth - could get into a lot of trouble with this one. Most highly recommend.

"Picked this up in a trade with bfg75! Dark brown, almost black pour with a big two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. Glorious nose with loads of piney, resiny hops to complement the rye, which was a little more subdued than I would have expected. Roasty malt with hints of cocoa balance it out nicely. The taste is just as bold as the nose. Tons of resiny, piney, citrus hops are balanced perfectly with a solid roasty malt backbone with hints of caramel and cocoa. The rye is once again subdued, but definitely adds a unique twist to your typical Black IPA. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a nice bitter hop finish. Drinkability is off the charts on this one! Probably the most balanced Black IPA I've tasted to date, maybe even the best overall. Another amazing beer from one of my favorite breweries! Thanks to Ben for hooking me up with this one!!!"
""
"Overall a very fine example of the style."
"O- Most hop-forward black IPA I have had. The hop profile and aroma is makes you think you are drinking a regular IPA or an imperial amber, but the slight roasty finish lets you know the dark malt is there."
""
""
"Overall a good beer but not an outstanding one."
""
"O- Another winner from Firestone Walker. It's the best black rye IPA I've ever had, the only one so far... I like the combination and can imagine some pastrami on pumpernickle going well with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a big hop flavor, a blend of citrus, tropical fruit and pine. There's some papaya and pineapple to complement the citrus as well. This is followed by a blend of roast, light caramel and unsweetened cocoa. Cocoa and citrus is a favorite combination of mine, especially when done right, and this beer does just that. The rye does add another dimension, a wholesome, spicy grain flavor that matches well with the pine. The bitterness lasts on the finish, not as resiny as I'd like. Light in body with moderate carbonation, and the alcohol is very well hidden, all of which make this beer very drinkable. While the finish also doesn't have quite enough roast for my liking (and is even a tad watery at times), but it further aids the drinkability of this beer, which is through the roof IMO."
"This was a very good entry into the Black IPA category from Firestone that really packs a fierce nature on the palate thanks to that assertive mix of American hops, rye, and high ABV. This was just balanced enough to stay drinkable but I still enjoyed it very much. Sometimes it’s fun to just brutalize your mouth with flavor!"
""
"Overall another really excellent Firestone Walker beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was an impressive beer I would recommend in a second. Have always liked black IPA's and adding rye makes perfect sense."
"Pick this stuff up if you have the chance. If you are an IPA guy, this is an absolute amazing change of pace for you. If you are a porter/stout guy, give this a shot and try to enjoy this hopped up dark brew!"
""
"O: I can't believe this is my first review of a Firestone beer. It's kind of shameful being that I lived in SLO for 5 years. That being said, this one is very tasty. Just solid all around. I'm usually not a big fan of Black IPA's or Rye beers, but this one might have made me change my mind."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is at the top of the food chain when it comes to Black Ales and Black IPA's, flavor so complex and intrciate that it blasts your palates. I will buy it again as long as it is in stock (hopefully), Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Having tasted some of the other Firestone Walker offerings, this was just okay for them. I'm glad I tried it, and it stands as a solid sampling of a Rye IPA, but not my beer of choice for Firestone Walker or the style. It's worth a try, but I don't think I'd grab it again, particularly if the Double Jack is available."
"o: really enjoy this beer. wish there was more rye presence, but none the less very solid offering."
"Drinks easy for the ABV -- balanced and tasty with nicely balanced rye character."
""
""
"O - It's a great rye IPA but not in my top 5. Still, worth trying & seeing for yourself."
""
""
"O: This was my first black IPA, and I can't say I'm a fan. Not bad, just not what I'm in the mood for on a summer night. The nose on this is really awesome and it looks beautiful. Sadly it goes downhill after that. Not much downhill, but still enough to not be my cup of tea."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorites within the style. I love this stuff."
"Upfront is that same juicy pineapple hops hit. Then as the spicy rye and roasted barley roll in, so does a spicier citrus hops mix. Damn that's tasty. The body is a little lighter for an 8%+ beer and the semi-dry peppery finish, makes this almost too drinkable. Find this beer."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small carbonation bubbles rise up in the beer during the entire drink down. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, citrus zest, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a roasty and hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer with a very nice balance between roast and hop aromas and flavors."
""
"Wookie came to me looking to me black in the glass, saying drink me. The liquid is a deep black with small brown edges on the edge. A nice cream colored head that is a nice inch with nice retentionand stick, clings down the glass. Smell is very bright with citrus hop scent, a nice dose of chocolate, some roast and a bit of perfume. The hops do shine with vigor, with a nice floral/tropic display. Taste is tropic up front swindled by the chocolate malt. There is a nice rye component here that strays this from the big black IPA pack. I don't know, im not a big fan of the style, but this seems a bit different and flavorful. A nice build with not a heaping of alcohol, 10oz's is plenty for me though."
""
""
"Great balance of flavors. First black IPA that wasn’t over roasty. A fantastic blend of flavors that’s more subdued than other pioneers of the style. However, I would call it a more refined flavor with the rye and complex flavors."

""
""
"Hops: German Magnum (bittering), Citra & Amarillo (flavor/aroma and double dry-hopped)"
""
""
""
"O - FW is really becoming my go-to brewer lately and Wookey only furthers that path. Ideally balanced beer (as are most of theirs), refreshing, complex and just DAMN good. Find it, trade for it, just get it. Move over Stone, FW now has the best black IPA."
"O- Very good, the bitterness is there but I've had much more potent ABA's. The rye adds a lot of character which is always a plus."
"The smell is terrific...skunky pine heaven into my nostrils. The taste follows suit with as juxtaposition of dark toffee malts against bright lemon-lime pine. Some rye spice rounds out the deal. Medium in the mouth with moderate drying. This is a very unusual black ale due to the interesting hop varietals."
""
""
""
"I believe that this recipe may have changed a bit since I reviewed the growler a couple months back. The rye seems much more evident now, which is both good and bad. The hop aromas are slightly muted as a result, but it is fun to have the spice of the rye show through a tad more. Well done to FWBC!"
""
"Notes: Overall a nicely balanced brew that, for me, doesn't quite coordinate the roast and hoppiness but is very drinkable, reasonably refined, and nicely hoppy."
"O - a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff. Closer to the ""hoppy Porter"" territory than most ABAs, but I'm good with that."
""
"Dark brown in body, almost black with a dirty tan head. Good lacing and retention. Nose has some notable citrus hop aromas and pine, some sweetness, but spicy rye and roast notes are notable. Great interplay of dark malts, rye, roast, chocolate and citrus hops on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium full, roasty and moderately bitter. A really solid rye black IPA."
"Wish I had another one right now actually."
""
"O - Extremely solid brew from FW, once again. This one sits behind Stone Escondidian in the category, but not by much. And that's saying a lot, as Stone's was a truly remarkable brew. Firestone does good once again."
""
""
"M - Medium body with a good chew. Creamy. Light to moderate carbonatoin."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the finish, it is only mildly bitter and has this nutty roasty bitterness at the backend. It is pretty enjoyable but I was hoping for more hops based on the description."
""
"Wow. Just wow. This is a phenomenally good beer. Exciting, complex, rich, but for all that balanced and exceptionally drinkable. Gorgeous stuff. Just gorgeous."
""
""
"Picked this up in Buffalo. Been lucky enough to try the Union and Double Jack, and now the Wookey Jack. Pours a jet black with creamy white head. Smells very floral and hoppy, just lovely. Tastes of slight citrus with some rye malt coming through in the finish. Nice hop presence and good crisp finish. Very smooth mouthfeel and its quite easy to drink."
"Overall, it's very good, not the best, double jack is a better bang for the buck."
""
""
""
""
"O: Cold, this leans more toward an IPA with a richer, creamier, roasty backbone. Warm, it shows more of the rye. By no means my favorite style, but this is pretty good stuff."
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer that definitely stands out. There is as much rye in this one as any beer I've had. I would have another."
"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium bodied, a little hop resin, a little chewy, and moderately carbonated. Good stuff- get it!"
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. I'm not the biggest fan of black IPAs but this was really tasty - possibly one of the better examples of the style I've had in recent memory."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great Black IPA; one of the best I've had probably. The nose is balanced really well between hops and malts, and it is very easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
""
"Overall this is an outstanding beer. ABV is well hidden, the multiple flavors are well blended. Another outstanding effort by Firestone Walker!"
"o- another great beer from FW. wish we got distribution in georgia!"
"My favorite of the style is Stone's SSR becuase it leans more toward the citrussy DIPA style before it does the ""Black."" That ""out of Balance"" is what makes Stone's my favorite, whereas Wookey Jack blends the two in perfect harmony. I'd say Firestone NAILED IT! Great Job again from a GREAT brewery."
"Overall: a good brew which is balanced but expected more stout flavour and a heavier body, rather than a simply a grainy malty IPA"
""
"O: a detailed craftsmanship and rich, smoothness - full of deep and semisweet roasted character. Another great Firestone Walker beer."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall I thought it was a great beer. The hoppiness was very juicy and fresh, and the touch of chocolate didn't clash with the hops as a lot of ABA's do for me. Very enjoyable beer overall."
""
"Well worth seeking out and enjoying."
""
"Overall another great beer from FW. Great balance anf flavors. Glad I bought more."
"O - I'm no fan of Black IPA's, Black Rye IPA's, Rye-PA's, etc, etc, ... I pretty much can live without these beers because they confuse my palette too much and I almost never enjoy them. In this particular case, Firestone Walker has done a superb job of blending everything and I have to say I would buy more of this beer. It's drinking very well right now and is not one I would let sit in the bottle too long. If my choice would boil down to a Black/Black Rye IPA and a regular IPA of similar hoppiness, I'll pick the regular IPA almost EVERY time and this is a rare exception that peaks my interest. Worth a try but get it now before the hops start to fade unless you prefer otherwise."
""
"Bright hops are the center piece of this beer adding aroma and bitterness. Smooth even mouthfeel with a well hidden alcohol shows the FW craft. I didn't get much of the dark malt and felt it was rather pointless to brew this as a black ipa if the malt just gets buried under."
""
""
""
"You need to seek this beer out. I believe it to be up in the world class category. Amazingly complex and delicious."
"O: Not sure I care for this one, the hop profile doesn't really do it for me. Seems pretty one-dimensional."
"D - Other than the mildly flaccid feel and harsh carbonation this beer is quite excellent. Perhaps bottle conditioning will fix these issues. In any case, I would definitely seek this out again, and would happily have multiple glasses in an evening."
"O: smells like a hop bomb but drinks very balanced. I must say that I'm impressed and this beer is finely crafted and not something thrown together to capitalize on the popularity of the style. Probably one of my favorite examples of the style"
"Overall hoppy but not, malty but not. So I guess that's good for a Black Pale Ale. Auto logged off again a minute ago and data lost. Why do I review live??"
"The look and smell of this beer have a huge ""wow"" factor, and even the initial sip is pretty tasty. It becomes apparent rather quickly though that this is not something I could drink alot of. Definitely worth a try though, but split this bomber with a friend."
"Reeeeally enjoying my bomber of Wookey Jack. You would, too. Boom-shaka-laka."
"O My favorite black IPa I've had so far. Really inpressed. FW IPAs seem to be top notch in every way. 5"
"Pours a dark greyish brown, moderate cap of dense brown froth, great retention and lacing. Scent of strong pine, grapefruit, lightly sweet malt with faint faint toast - no heavy char or roast found in others of the style. Smooth and bitter, grapefruit and pine, uniquely light malt presence - was told the dark grains for color only, not scent or flavor. Medium bodied, oily, lingering bitterness. Perhaps the best black IPA around, the black is for show and the hops still star."

"O-One of the better Black IPAs I've had the balance is amazing."
""
""
"overall: really outstanding"
""
"O: Overall, this is an excellent black ale. The color and smell throw you off, in a good way."
"I'm generally not a huge fan of the black IPA (or cascadian dark) style, but this is pretty excellent. Hopefully we'll see this down in Baltimore at some point, as I'd love to be able to order this from time to time."
"This is a big beer and is considerable. I've had imperial stouts which gave me less pause on first taste. Like everything Firestone does, though, this turned out near the top of the heap for the style. Another winner."

"Roasted malts have been applied with a deft hand in this brew. There's just enough to round out the edges of the flavor, but not so much that the hops are interrupted. The flavor doesn't pull your arms out of their sockets, but rather caresses you with a Wookiee-like growl. Ghaaa."
"Overall: a very enjoyable black IPA. Easy to quaff an somewhat refreshing."
"O- Really nice, but thats what I've come to expect from F.W. The thick chewiness of the rye adds a really nice balance between the burnt charred malt and the citrus punch! Not my favorite style, but this one ranks near the top of it."
"Overall: I gotta say before wookey jack I thought that New Gluarus Black Top was the best Black IPA that I have ever drank. I also thought that it would be difficult to find a better Black IPA; Firestone Walker proved me wrong. The X factor for wookey jack that makes it better is the RYE. The rye adds this spiciness and great complexity that just works so well. Let not forget this is a very affordable bomber costing around 6 to 8 dollars."
""
"O: Disappointed to be honest. Burnt malt + spicy rye + bitter hops is just too much for my taste. It did grow on me and become less abrasive as I went on, but still not one of my favorite FW brews."

"O: The flavors come together well to make this an awesome example of a unique version of the style. With so many Black Ales out there, this is different enough to merit high marks."
"A winner all the way by Firestone. Definitely worth a try and is highly, highly recommended."
"Cost: $8 for a 12 oz tulip."
"Dark brown with garnet edges. Big think head leaves moderate, irregular lacing. Piney hops mix with toasty dark malt aromas. Medium heavy body with high carbonation. Dark burnt malts dominate the taste with a grassy hop finish. Mild sweetness. A pleasant enough beer, but not a standout."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
""
"O - I think that porters are my favorite style to drink (especially with a meal) and black ipas are a close second. Really liked this version and will seek it out in bottles when it comes to Chicago!"
"What a weird beer; only Firestone Walker. It did grow on me as it warmed, & I have to say that this is a very good beer, & keeps me hopeful that this style doesn't entirely suck. Arrr-rrrr."
"650 ml bottle. Pours a very dark brown with a decent sized tan head that has good retention and leaves a large amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is grapefruit, pine, tobacco, light roastiness, some tangerine, and a bit of rye. The taste has some sweetness with tangerines, a rye twang, some grapefruit, and a bit of pine. The finish has a decent bitterness with some lingering rye spiciness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Quite enjoyable. Certainly one of the better black IPAs that I've had. I liked that it didn't have a lot of roastiness and enjoyed the rye. Perhaps a touch too sweet."

"A- "

"Very drinkable example of the style - uniquely crafted and startlingly fresh-tasting. Stone's DDH Sumblimely Self Righteous Ale bests it, but FW has produced a solid contender for top-of-the-pack for the style."
""
"Overall I think the crew hit this right on the head. The rye and citrus combo really worked here. Firestone deserves the accolades they receive and I can't wait for the next new batch from these winners."
""
""
""
"This is still a great beer."
"O – No doubt one of the finest examples of the style. Personally, I have never found black IPA’s to my liking, and I've always found the charred grain + super piney hops flavor combination to be a little abrasive. Personal tastes aside, a quality brew."
"Overall, this is an interesting take on a black IPA and certainly worth a taste."
"O: The hops overshadow everything just like a good black ipa should. Roasted malts are just barely detectable in the finish. This beer is awesome because it is an ipa first and a dark, roasted beer second, and not just a hoppy stout."

"A great black IPA. A great American dark ale? Yeah."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours very dark brown, fine two finger light brown head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma is fantastic, light roasted malt and nice herbal and piney hops. Flavor is complex, herbal hops, citrus, roasted malt, tropical fruit. The hops are not intense, but very fresh tasting. An unusually well balanced ale between hops and malt. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess. This is an excellent black ale that leans more towards an IPA although the roasted malt is still present."
"O- Very solid beer. Best thing I've tried from firestone"
"Some real good stuff here, really didn't want to let my last bottle go as an extra in the last trade, but spread the wealth, that's what I always say, when its a choice at least, not when its being forced upon you!"
"The body was just a touch fuller than is typical for the style and the beer benefited greatly. Drinkability was excellent, I finished the 22 and found myself wanting another. Overall, an excellent brew. Easily the best CDA I've yet had. This is a must try beer, but make sure you buy a couple bottles, you ARE going to want them."

"Overall, this is pretty damn good and crushable. I'm not sure I like it better than Black Top, but I'm a little giddy school girl for that little minx. Firestone Walker remains in my wheelhouse of good times."
""
""
""
"Taste & mouthfeel: Very tropical, citrusy, completely hop-forward. A touch of sweetness up-front, but ultimately dry and light-bodied. The finish brings out the roasted malt and earthy rye, along with a sticky resinous bitterness. The contrast between sweeter tropical fruit flavors, black malt and rye is unusual but works very well."
""
"Overall: I tried this for the first time last year and was utterly blown away by the rough around the edges, yet truly balanced flavor profile of this complex and interesting brew. I would love to see Firestone put this beer on oak for a couple of weeks. Highly recommended to any beer lover."
""
"O - A really good good black IPA that leaves a nice taste in your mouth and for 5.99 well worth it. I support this beer as a top tier black ipa."
"Overall: this is a well-balanced American black ale. I could quaff tons of it!"
"very intense beer. not smooth, intense. maybe after this mellows, it could be an overall 4.5. but a little too harsh right now."
""
""
""
"O: Most excellent!"
"Overall, I really wanted to like this beer, but it just did not mesh at all. It did mellow a bit as I drank it, but still was overly abrasive and unbalanced with off-notes"
"Good tasting beer overall, which is what I’d expect from Firestone. Would definitely try it again."
"O - A roasted hoppy delight."
"Overall: This is the first good beer I have had since I cam back form Afghanistan, and I am glad that it was. I cant think of a better way to welcome myself back into the world of amazing beer than with a beer like this."
""
""
""
""
"O - I've really been looking forward to this one being released, and I was not disappointed. A very easy drinking black IPA. No hint of alcohol, great hop character, and the rye compliments it very nicely. I've had a lot of rye ales where the rye is just too over powering. IMO, Firestone has found a perfect balance. Cheers!"
""
"D - Glad to try."
""
"Overall this was excellent. I think I have new clear favorite black IPA. I would expect nothing less from Firestone"
"The taste is not at all what i expected. The carbonation intially fills my mouth. as it dissipates the spicy hops and rye flavor take over. there are other hops but they definitly take the back. the flavor finishes with a smooth bitter and dryness on the tongue that is almost smoky. Nice."

"Again, FW puts out a top-notch, world-class American beer."
"Pours a very dark brownish black color which appears to have a ruby hue when held up to the light. Large cream colored head. Scent is nice and roasty. Some roasted malt with burnt toast aromas and a nice little hop profile going on. A bit of citrus with more roasted malt. Taste is initially hoppy with more of an IPA side than a stout side. Definitely makes you wonder how they can make something so hoppy...so DARK. Just hints of roasted malt and grain with a tiny bit of char...but other than that, it's citrusy, hoppy, and bitter. Maybe a bit of dark chocolate, but you really have to hunt for it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, crisp, bitter finish. Drinkability is high. ABV is not noticeable at all. Overall, a solid beer from an awesome brewery that never really seems to fail."

"Quite unique! A rather delightful BIPA, they're not my favorite, but if they were all like Wookey, BIPAs would grow on me, rapidly. Recommended."
""
""
"o-great addition to the FW line up. This beers really does it for me, and will be a regular in the FW rotation. Well done."
"Overall, quite nice if you like the style. I'd have it again."
""
"I really like how the spice in the hop and malt character is balanced by the fruit and pine characteristics of the hops. It is a fantastic brew that almost perfectly balances all elements. My favorite American Black Ale."
"Drink- It was good but I wanted more. I wanted to be blown away. Had some good flavors but was a bit bigger than I anticipated it being. I did like the Rye forward approach but just needed to be a bit better."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, I wasn't expecting to like it nearly this much. The beer is decadent and definitely hop forward. That instantly makes the case that half of people will like it and half won't. I know lots of people that don't like hop forward ABAs so they probably won't like this showing. But perhaps the solid rye presence will win you over like it won me over."
""
"T: Starts soft and sweet with mango and honey and some faint citrus hop notes. Finish brings darker flavors of roasted malt, anise, coffee and char. There's a lingering sweetness throughout that isn't helped by the seeming lack of carbonation. It's not a bad beer, but it's not my thing."
""
"DOA"
""
"My only complaint is that the head was rather thin and dissipated quickly, leaving little lacing along the sides."
""
"Verdict: Fantastic Black IPA, especially for being their first widely available beer of this style. The flavors are dank, bitter and balanced well, with a great body which makes for a great drinking experience, this is definitely one of the better black IPAs out there."
""

"Hit the shelves today, had to buy one, poured to pint glass the beer arrives a deep dark black color with dark brown mahagoney edges in the light. A nice 2 finger mocha head with excellent retention and leaves gobs of lacing throughout. The nose is big with citrus hops, rye spice, and a hint of roasted malts. Inviting. Similarly, the taste starts off with a big citrus hops flavor that blends to a medium bitterness, rye spice, and roasted malt. The rye and citrus work very well together and the hint of roast finishes everything off well. Good. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a great beer. I could drink it all day!"
"A very well done ABA, and one I would look forward to enjoying again. Definitely a more hop-forward example of this style, with the rye being a pleasant compliment and just enough roast to make it fit the style."
"O- I was hoping for more, but this was not a bad beer at all."
"Overall. Nice beer but I like a little more roasty malts like others of the style."
"Overall, I will be drinking this beer again. I won't be buying other Firestone-Walker beers, since I find them to be a bit weak, but hopefully this is a trend that they will keep going with their upcoming brews."
"Poured a dark porter like thickness with limited light coming through. I was very impressed with it's dark reddish brown color. The lacing wasn't much to look at, neither was the head. The smell was that of an imperial ipa, hops, citrus, floral, not so much rye though. Very attractive smell though... The taste was incredible, normaly rye beers for me aren't as big a hit for me but this one hit home. The taste is that of caramel, hops, floral citrus notes with a bit of burnt aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't anything special but it doesn't detract, just something I wouldn't say adds. Overall I would definitely pick this beer up again, and if I ever saw it on tap somewhere, it would be the first beer I tried there."

"O - Yet another winner from Firestone Walker. Good beer, and one that I'm hoping becomes a year-round offering. Great compliment to Double Jack, and a very good Rye / Black IPA."
"Well worth the effort to seek out. A fun beer. Can't wait to find it in bottles."
"O: Fresh on tap is good. Would like to see how this is from the bottle. Should be a year-round offering. Pretty darn good."

"I had this beer at the SLO Xtreme beerfest. It pours a dark brown--almost black, with glints of red in the light. A tan/taupe head. No head retention, which is not unusual for Firestone Walker creations. The color is misleading as the bouquet has a resiny hop character. Perfectly carbonated. In fact, the ties the resiny hop with the rye flavor with a very smooth transition. Not sure if that was intended or if it occurred serendipitously. Either way, it works."
