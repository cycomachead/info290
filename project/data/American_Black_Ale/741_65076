Some hop-like aromas up front, but with a definite malty character.  The flavor is a near perfect balance of malt and hops.  The carbonation and body are ideal.  Feels great going down.  I've had much of the catalogue produced by Lakefront, but my first time trying this one.  They do a great job with a lot of different recipes and didn't disappoint on this one.

The hop character is definitely old-school pine and grapefruit, which isn't a bad thing and is actually kind of refreshing these days. However, the body isn't robust enough to give balance to the hops. While certainly worth a go, IBA is noticeably inferior to Lakefront's wonderful IPA.","hail_seitan","Apr 11, 2014"

Smells of lighter roasted malts and piney hops. Taste is big on roasted malts, sweet caramel and bittersweet chocolate, with hops coming in towards the end for a bitter and dryer than expected finish, but it's still wet and a bit sticky at the end.

Lakefront's IBA is no hop bomb but a delicious balance of subtle hops and approachable black malt. At 6.5% it is still sessionable enough to consume on a hot hot day. At the same time it leaves a hoppy resin on the back of the palate. Will buy again. Cheers Lakefront.","TSJ4000","Jun 19, 2012"

The aroma is highly hoppy -- mainly citrus, pine, and floral. The flavor is much like the aroma, strong hop flavor--pine and citrus zest with solid hop bitterness. The malt presence is detectable, mainly bittersweet and very subtle roast, but certainly is second fiddle to the hops. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and the beer finishes with lingering nutty malt and citrusy/piny hop flavor, especially as it warms. The carbonation and body are both moderate.

Pours a nice deep brown color with two fingers of off-white head. Aroma is full of citrus hops, with a bit of roasted malts in the back. The taste is very good, it's got a very strong hop presence that separates this from the ""hoppy porters"" of the world, with some highly roasted malts and coffee providing a bitter supporting role. The mouthfeel is very IPA-like, with just a bit more body than the average one would have, and the drinkability is very good. Another great one from Lakefront. If they keep putting out great new beers, they are going to go places in the craft world.","shand","Jan 24, 2012"

3.86,0.3,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Perhaps the fastest-growing beer style to date, the American Black Ale. Lakefront did not play around—black as black, with a killer lacing. Slight roast in the nose with a thick blanket of soft hop resin and faint ripe fruit. Minty and tobacco aroma. Moderate-sized body, more than enough smoothness to go around. Smacks of hops, but with a smat- tering of roasted grain and ripe fruit, this beer is more complex than just darkness and hops. The hops do, however, provide a pretty intense trail for the taste buds to follow. Minty hop finish with some lingering roastiness. The brewer definitely has a firm grasp on this style.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 15, 2011"

3.28,-14.8,4.5,4,3,2.5,3,"I really like this style, whatever they decide the name will be, and I had really high hopes for this. Unfortunately this is lacking the complexity the style requires to pull it off. You need an IPA and a dark flavor component to both present themselves in time, but this was one dimensional throughout. It was drinkable, but the flavors seemed muddled and muted to me.","Strix","Jul 13, 2011"
3.85,0,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Lakefront IBA (India-Style Black Ale) combines smoky, chocolaty porter qualities with a wet, autumn leafs-like hoppiness to make for a beer that is as multi-faceted as it is drinkable. It combines the most agreeable aspects of dark beers and hoppy beers into a one lip-smacking ale. If the style is new to you, this Wisconsin offering is a good place to start out.","biegaman","Jul 12, 2011"
3.41,-11.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured out like a porter almost. The head was creamy tan in color and the beer itself was a dark brown. The head on the beer leaves a pretty good lacing down the glass. The smell isn't overly hoppy or anything. It's got some roasted malts in the back ground. The taste is nice, it's got a pretty decent amount of hops and malts working together. The mouthfeel was nicely carbonated and had a good drinkability for the most part. Overall this beer was pretty good, not the best black IPA out there but worth checking out.","Knapp85","Jul 09, 2011"
4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"One very solid IBA(ABA) by Lakefront. This is something they should be doing more often with their future brews and this ""IBA"" is exactly where one opens doors for such a thing to happen...","tavernjef","Jul 04, 2011"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: This is a good beer. I've been on a bit of a black ale kick lately, and the coincidence of the style showing up in this variety pack is a welcome thing for a Monday.

3.83,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a black body with a nice tan, rocky head that was well retained and dissipated into a small cap that lasted throughout the beer. The beer gave off a nice pine hop aroma. The beer had a nice, more of a roasted malty taste than expected, but with citrus hops to note. Seemed pretty straight forward. The beer had a medium feel to it with a nice dry, somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall, a very drinkable beer and one that I will probably buy again.","PhillyStyle","Jun 14, 2011"

3.51,-8.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Aroma is rather hoppy and has a yeasty undertone. It pours a barely transparent chocolate brown with a respectable, if not persistent, beige head.

3.59,-6.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Stouty impression at first, dominant black roasted malt, with lingering herbal bitterness and citrus rind. The dark roastiness and citrus peel bitterness mesh well, finishing clean and dry. The hop bitterness lingers momentarily in the aftertaste, as do the roasty elements. Best at room temperature. The body is lighter, yet the stouty roast malts give it some heft. I'd really like to try a fresher bottle of this, as it has potential, though falls a bit short of the ""genius"" claimed on the label...","emerge077","May 04, 2011"

3.63,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Picked up a bomber from Abe's for $4.50 and split it with a fellow hophead. Gotta say, while this is a fine example of the style, it doesn't stand out. I feel like I've had this beer before from other brewers. The beer is dominated by a dry, spicy cocoa malt and citrus hops mixture that's satisfying, but could be deeper. It comes in a big flavor hit instead of slowly developing from start to finish.","tempest","Apr 12, 2011"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours brilliantly clear very dark brown with a mahogany glow when held to a light and a sticky, thick off-white head. The aroma is highly hoppy -- mainly citrus, pine, and floral. The flavor is much like the aroma, strong hop flavor--pine and citrus zest with solid hop bitterness. The malt presence is detectable, mainly bittersweet and very subtle roast, but certainly is second fiddle to the hops. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and the beer finishes with lingering nutty malt and citrusy/piny hop flavor, especially as it warms. The carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a solid offering, could there be tweaks to make it incredible, like a tad more body, sure, but I won't complain!","uwmgdman","Feb 19, 2011"

3.86,0.3,4,3,4,4,4.5,"D. Sky high in drinkability. Goes down easily and is very satisfying. I could see myself finishing off two bombers without a problem.

Well done - up there with IPA in terms of flavor and drinkability.","bound4er","Jan 30, 2011"
3.93,2.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel has an overall airiness, but gains enough traction in the mouth to give itself substance and definition. It's on the low side, alcohol-wise, of the style, and drinkability is, without a doubt, its strong suit. It's assertive in its flavor, but not aggressive. Hoppy, but balanced. Basically its a hopped-up brown ale even though that's not the trendy way to label it. Regardless, it's got some charm and it's damn drinkable. I'd like to see this in sixpacks, as it demands that sort of mass consumption.","cokes","Jan 28, 2011"
