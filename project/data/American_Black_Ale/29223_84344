3.7,-6.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, we would be hard pressed to call this one a “black IPA”.  Judging by the nose alone you would be more apt to think this was a clean stout, or even the darkest of brown ales.  Actually, it’s quite nice.  The taste comes across like the most bitter coffee stout, but again, with almost no hop component whatsoever.  Regardless, we were very happy to find Indeed’s beers on tap here.  This brewing company was on “must visit” lists of several of our locals, but since we couldn’t fit it in, this worked well in absentia.  According to the bartender at Republic, this was the only place in the city we could actually find this beer on nitro.  While we feel it didn’t necessarily do the beer justice in the hop department, it was tasty and exciting nonetheless.","TheBrewo","Feb 02, 2015"

I did enjoy the art on the can. It looks like Teddy Roosevelt riding a bear drinking coffee from a mug. Classic! Some minor teaks to this beer and it would be world class. Better than average example for this beer style. If you love resinous pine hops this is a must try beer, but I prefer balance and complexity for a beer in this beer style.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Apr 22, 2013"

This is a touch more bitter, with a big dry cocoa and grapefruit finish. To back up, the aroma brings an herbal citrus hops hit with dark bread crust. The malts bring an extra-dark chocolate flavor that ties into the bitter citrus hops with a slight burnt edge. This is a great example of the style, go find yourself a can.","tempest","Nov 20, 2012"

The head is one inch of dense tan foam that doesn't really recede, but leaves a nice coating of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is quite malty with a ton of roasted malt, some chocolate, hints of maple syrup, and grapefruity hops. The taste is similar to the aroma. It leans toward the maltier side for an American Black Ale, but the hops are still an integral component of the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and soft carbonation.

Black in color, but not deep, with brownish edges and a beige cap of foam. Above average.","sacrelicio","0"
