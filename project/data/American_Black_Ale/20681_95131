3.96,0.8,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"From bottle dated 1/27/15. Second tasting of a MBC beer. This is a black IPA and the bottle should state it that way, it was described to me as such before purchase. Dark pour with a thicker viscosity, 2 finger tab foam, laced and held the glass throughout. Very nice caramelly, smoky hop smell. A piney hop flavor hits the mouth up front and the rich malt settles in the back followed by a little bitter bite. A few seconds later the rich, woody malt flavor lingers. Overall a very good, not great, offering for a dark IPA, would purchase again without a doubt but want to try the other Maine beers first.","hotpauko","Thursday at 05:26 PM"

When first gazing upon its black body and creamy frothy head I thought ""how nice, a black ale"" which wasn't to far off. It goes down like combination of a hazelnut brown ale and a traditional black ale so it gives you the best of both worlds.  It's yet another example of how MBC has staked its claim as one of New England's best brewers.","Stevecarini","Feb 15, 2015"

Rock solid retention...  The color walks a fine line between dark brown and flat black...   Largely still with just a stray carbonation bubble or two seen towards the top of the glass...  The nice is quite whimsical...  Equal parts piney and juicy hop resins...  There are some faint roasted malt tones beneath the surface...  Just the slightest whiff of vanilla as well...  The nose was a good indication of what to expect on the palate...  There is no vanilla sweetness, but everything else is spot on...  The roasted malts and hops ebb and flow while competing for prominence...  The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium bodied...  A slightly surprising bite of prickly carbonation...  A touch of dryness throughout before finishing with a bit of a chalky presence...  Loaded with character...  Maine Brewing turns out another winner with Weez...  A very well rounded American Black Ale iwth lots of depth and complexity...  A terrific brew all the way around...","philbe311","Jan 07, 2015"

4.25,8.1,,,,,,"Huge, frothy head, easy three fingers, very dark brown with an unusual amount of larger bubbles present, lots of craters across the surface, excellent retention, the lacing likewise thick and chunky and not easily washed away. The liquid is a pure black, while opaque in no way cloudy, can’t discern any visible bubbles. Early appearance in the nose of white grapefruit and orange citrus, this succumbs to cocoa, coffee roast notes, pleasingly strong floral component too, something medicinal, like witch hazel, the plum, cherry fruit scents a touch muted, never turns all that complex but what is there lingers powerfully. Medium-bodied, the creamy mouthfeel helps to delay the arrival of the roastiness and dark chocolate, moments of chicory like bitterness. In the end the citrus adds more sweetness than tartness, still not getting much more than a vestige of mixed black fruits. Carbonation assists in breaking up its inclinations towards heaviness. Pine resin, tar and campfire smoke contribute to the inner mouth perfume through the finish. Thankfully not over roasted so ends up with a clean ending rather than too astringent or bitter.","farrago","Sep 13, 2014"

3.92,-0.3,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a shaker pint glass. Dark chocolate brown to black brew with a very large, rich tan head. Aroma of melon and tropical fruit (mango? faint lychee?), grapefruit, molasses, dry chocolate wafers, and a little pine needle. Nice freshness and complexity on the nose, hop forward yet mildly roasted. The palate largely follows suit, although there is more dry roast coffee and cacao powder that threatens to engulf the pine needle, orange and grapefruit rind, Earl Gray tea, canned peach, and lime juice hops flavors ... Perhaps I spoke too soon, the hops are beginning to shine through as I type this. A pleasant lemon pepper spice is revealing itself late along with a touch of garlic. Mouthfeel is a selling point, quite thick and chewy for the style and with a moderate degree of carbonation. Finishes quite bitter, with more citrus and steak spice plus a little ash. Perhaps the weakest of the four Maine Beers I've sampled to date but still pretty freaking good. The cause described on the bottle is even better (as my rescue cat nods her assent).","CalgaryFMC","May 25, 2014"

Very dry and bitter up front with the earthy hops and charred malt flavors playing off of each other. Strong sticky, resinous hop flavor up front with grass, pine and spruce tip but it's missing the subtle citrus presence found in the nose. The hops are countered by a deeply roasted dark malt backbone that is somewhat acrid and nearly burnt tasting. The smoke presence is a bit stronger than in the aroma with hints of ash, charcoal and burnt toast along with used coffee grinds, oatmeal and dark chocolate. This beer has a decent balance of hops and malt but tastes very one dimensional with a ton of tongue scraping, dry bitterness and overwhelming roast. Needs a lot more sweetness to balance things out. Overall, this isn't a terrible beer but it's boring, a bit harsh and tough to drink.","corby112","Jan 28, 2014"

There is a thin, creamy mocha colored head that hangs around all day. The nose is a nice mixture of aromatic hops and dark malty notes. The taste prevails in the hop direction initially with a sweet piney, resinous hop flavor and then shifts back to a bready, burnt chocolate, semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected and goes down easy, mild but adequate carbonation helps too. Overall, a great beer and a great representative for the state of Maine!","gmfessen","Nov 10, 2013"

The hops are much more prominent here from the get go, but the flavoring does catch up more and more as it warms, with oily resins working their way in between the dense layers of chocolate, malts, and char. This beer does just the right amount of blending, with that unique black ale oily sweetness of hops that marries so, so well with the darkness of the grain bill. The product works to somehow lighten and denude the malts a bit, and is a quality that we’ve appreciated in the best beers of the style. This beer has been a long time coming, and again, and with a new style to their lineup nonetheless, continued to impress us with their versatility and general prowess.","TheBrewo","Nov 04, 2013"

Two different beers, same hops, different malts, the wheat and light malt beer in the Another One was awesome and the hops brought resin, tropical fruit, juicy generic fruit, floral aroma, very nice hop character. The dark malts drown out the nice part of the hops, and contrast what comes through from the nice hops, and brings out the less interesting parts of the hops, just not nearly as tasty.","jlindros","Oct 02, 2013"

Aromas of sweet grapefruit, citrus hops, smoke and chocolate. The taste is more of the chocolate and smoke than the citrus hops, which is the exact opposite of the aroma. Earthy with lots of dark chocolate bitterness. Some grapefruit sprinkled in here and there. Dark roast black coffee and espresso at the finish. Lots of malt flavor. Heavily carbonated. Most of the bitterness here doesn't come from the citrus hops but rather the dark chocolate and espresso. The smell made me believe this was going to be a lot hoppier than it was.

That said it's still better then almost anything readily available at my local liquor store. I was tricked by the label claiming that it had the same hops as ""Another One", which is one of my personal favorites. The change to the malts, which result in the vastly darker coloring really change the taste and give it a much more subdued flavor that can almost (almost) be described as burnt. The change in malts also apparently results in the lack of delicious aroma that it's brother from another mother(Another One) boasts. Cheers.","mjstacker","0"

Very balanced smell, with a dark, richly sweet ribbon tucked away in there as well. Flavors are hop forward, bitter and resiny, with a blast of citrus tart and sweet, also. Roasty and tangy sweet backbone. Hints of smoke throughout. The body is light and smooth, doing a good job supporting the robust flavors. Decent lacing left on the glass.

4.36,10.9,4.5,4.75,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours like black mocha coffee with a beautiful head of medium sized, khaki colored, medium sized bubbles that sit above two finger widths in the glass and take their time in calming down. The head leaves a lacing of fat, thick bubbles that fluff out into the glass. In body the beer is impenetrable the eye. On the nose the beer smells gorgeously fruity with citric tangerine and nectarine with a touch of pine. In the roast, the beer is light with caramel and a faint touch of roasted chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes of citric bitter with a light sweet roast that draws a little bitterness from it and builds in the mouth. The beer also has a light acidic pop, presumably from the hops, which leaves the mouth with a wet scrim of saliva. This beer begins as sweet, however, and slowly works towards a more bitter palate, which is wonderfully encouraging of future sips. In flavor, the beer begins as fruity hops, with sweet orange and grapefruit citrus touching the tongue before a healthy roast of coffee and light char moves in and overrides those flavors. Chocolate and light metallic flavors also tingle on the tongue with the roast. The finish returns to fresh citric juice with a touch of roasted malts, and the aftertaste is of lightly roasted malts with a soft touch of metallic flavoring. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a little bit of weight. The carbonation is creamy and smooth, providing just a kiss of fierceness making the beer wonderfully clean and crisp on the mouth. The mouth is left with a nice bit of saliva to cancel out the acids, and a slight bitter bite on the tongue. Overall, this is a beautifully complex beer. It sits somewhere between a hoppy porter and an India Black Ale, with a beautiful nose of citric hops and tastes nicely roasty with a good juicy bite from the hops. Color me impressed by this beer. It is sweet on the front and bitter on the end. I wouldn’t call it a “Black IPA” by any stretch of the imagination, and I will continue arguing for some differentiation between India Dark Ales and their roastier cousins (Weez sides more on the roasty cousin side). This beer is great though, and is another success from the MBC. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Jun 23, 2013"

4.09,4.1,4.5,4.25,4,4,4,"O: Definitely a well constructed black IPA which can be a hit or miss style with me - I like how the nose makes the beer seem like it will be extremely hoppy but the flavor is much more roasty. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is relatively easy to drink. Enjoyable and definitely one to grab.","dbrauneis","Jun 23, 2013"
3.93,0,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours a solid black color with a huge tan head that persists forever. Earthy hoppy aroma with a roasty chocolate some dark fruit and a hint of cardboard. The flavor is earthy and citrus hoppy with a fair amount of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick roasty gritty mouthfeel. Nice hoppy porter very tasty.","johnnnniee","Jun 22, 2013"

4.24,7.9,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"O: Definitely on the malty side with the big roasted malts. The hops take a back seat in this beer, but provide quite the bitterness. You can tell it has the same hops as Another One, but the roasted malts really dominate this beer. Both great beers, and it's nice to compare the two","BEERMILER12","Jun 17, 2013"

4.06,3.3,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Dark brown beer, with a huge fluffy brown head. Big aroma dominated by sour, citrusy hops. The taste is a really interesting mixture of dark, roasted malts and sour hops. In the end though, the roasted flavors win out and this is what lingers on the tongue more, with a background of hops. Overall, I really enjoyable beer.","jtladner","Jun 14, 2013"
