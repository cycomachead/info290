"nice color nothing special in this beer."

"I've had some great black ipa's this however was not one of them drinks ok but one and done for me"
"Dark, brown pour edged with a little tannish foam. Not a heavy head nor super hoppy smell as you'd expect with a double so I think that brings down its score a bit. The smell is a bit loamy and damp with some spicy grapefruit on top. And what a fantastic flavor (which is what matters, right?) Very different profile than others on the head, the smell, and look which may be chalked up to the hemp seeds, but I don't care. Fun beer...Will drink again and again. Then sleep and drink some more."
"Pours a dark brown, color.  One inch head, of an off-tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of slight floral hops, strong piney hops, resin, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, alcohol, caramel malt, and strong wood.  Fits the style of an American Black Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of alcohol, strong wood, piney hops, resin, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, and caramel malt.  Overall, good appearance, strong aroma, strong body, decent blend (alcohol and wood dominate), and average mouth feel."

"Huge hops with bitter chocolate and roasted malt notes. Like a thin hoppy stout. Big beer, but if there was any drawbacks I got a slight tinny flavor initially."
""
""
"Bottle best by early August, poured into snifter.  Dark dark color, one finger head, some lacing.  I am a big fan of the black IPA style and this is a fine representation of the style, more on the roasty side than hoppy.  Very solid brew, would have again."
""
"Outstanding! Appearance is a huge foamy, thick, light tan long lasting head, with plenty of lace, and an opaque brown black color. Aroma is fresh hops with a bit of a doobie character, roast malt, Flavor's somewhat similar to nose, plus quite dry (except in finish - then a hint of sweet comes out), very bitter, some tang. Body is good though the extreme bitter coupled with alcohol warmth yields a strange tingle, while still being oddly smooth. Big beer."
""
"O: Really nice black IPA:"
"Top of the line black Imperial ipa, hoppy as hell with notes of coffee! I will make this a regular'"

"Only thing I have to note is that i am usually not a fan of Black IPA but, you see a new beer in your liquor store (one made with hemp seed at that) you give it a whirl. Not at all what i expected from this, a rather approachable Black IPA. For all that is in it it is well rounded not a beer for everyday, however one i will take a second gander at."
"- Great beer from my home town, a great company and nailed it with this beer"

"Pours a dark, almost black, deep brown producing a huge 2+ finger, mocha, somewhat lasting head that leaves webby sheets of lace. Aroma dark malt, Hershey\'s & semisweet chocolate, toffee & faint smoke forward backed by citrus & pine hops. Taste dry & astringent, bitter chocolate, burnt, bitter coffee, phenolic, resinous hops. Finish is a continuation of the drying & astringent bitterness that intensifies & lingers long into the aftertaste."

"Bottom line, this is super hoppy and super tasty. The abv is hidden well too. Worthy of repurchases."
""
""
""
""
"The beer smells like metal."
""
""
"Black IPA not really my thing and this was bottled June 2014. That said not bad.. I kinda like the malty undertone.."
""
""
""
""
"In my experience, it's much better on tap than bottled. The tap version would be a solid .5 higher, but the bottled version needs to be accounted for, too. Even when bottled, it's not bad at all, but rather just... unremarkable to me. In both versions, the 9.2% ABV is definitely something you can taste, though that's not necessarily good or bad."
""
"Pours a dark brown/red. Smells of pine spice, roast malts and coffee. Taste is dominated by pine resin and roasted malts. Pine resin and roast malt aftertaste with a little chocolate. Very tasty but I was expecting a little more flavor diversity especially considering it is a black IPA."
"I've got to find this more regularly so's I remember it's A DOOBIE."
""
""
"Beautiful tan head over the clear, black liquid looks so wonderful. Great lacing on the glass too! The smell has a clean roasted barley character with a massive floral, piney hop bouquet. Taste is superior to most black ales with a chocolatey and porter like roastedness coming through the many layers of fresh hops. This beer was pleasing sip after sip! Great clean, fresh taste! Must have again!"
""
"Purchased one bottle from total wine and more. I typically like black IPA's and brew my one once in a while as a nice change in pace to traditional. Although this delivered nice malty back bone, good hoppiness, nice feel I found a weird presence of a metallic like taste. Made the spot between my cheek and ear twinge. I want to like this beer but its just OK for me. Then I realized, im drinking 20 days past best buy date. Ill blame the wife for rushing me through the bottle shop and force her to drink it and crack open a fresher beer for now. But I will definitely wish to try this one again only fresher. Will update then"

"if you have a clean pallet, you can taste the slightest hint of hemp by 5/6 way through the beer. Beat nose of any dark IPA ive had. Probably best dark IPA ive had."
"One of the better black IPAs I've tried. Hoppier than most and the hop flavor holds out longer in this beer than it does in many of its peers. Midway through, however, I feel like I'm having a porter, not an IPA. (8.0)"
"A new favorite beer. Brilliantly blends malty sweetness with hop bitterness. Initial tastes are of chocolate and caramel but finished strong with a large dose of traditional IPA hops but enough of the malts remain to keep it balanced."
"It's an alright black ipa. I can really taste the alcohol also, I can barely taste the coffee, but I can smell it. Black ipas are not my thing"
""
""
"*I qualify the above with the fact that this beer is brewed with hemp seed, so the entire experience may have been a hallucination on my part :-) ."

"This beer has a dark amber color. Initially chocolate, hemp and roasted malts smell. Tastes much like it smells; the chocolate and roasted malts flavors does a great job masking the the eventual hoppy bitterness. This is a nice representation of the style. The flavors mask the ABV quite well."

"12 oz bottle from Utah L-store. Pours black with 1-2 finger off white head. Aroma of hops and chocolate. Bit of anise/licorice. Taste is complex. Layers of roasted malt with a bitter hop finish. Medium body and mouthfeel. Highly recommended. A shelf beer that is better than most premium special releases."
""

""
""
"Tap at Lazy Dog Macon. Aroma of hops, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste of roasted malts, licorice, and chocolate. Bitter hops aftertaste. Very good and flavorful"

"While I've enjoyed this beer it is definitely a one a night beer and while I could drink more of them in the future I'm increasingly finding that my tastes are shifting from high ABV intensely flavored beers towards more subtle beers where the hops and malt play together nicely with some sweetness, some earthy bitterness, and a nice dryness at the end that invites another sip."
""
""
"O: [4.00] I really like this beer.  The appearance, smell and tastes are all hitting.  There is a slight sense of alcohol - but not bad for a 9.2% ABV.  I don't think this is a beer that I would drink more than 1-2 of in a sitting.  Also I liked the flavors a bit more when it was colder.  The warmth brought out a bit more of the earthy and bitter tones (and subdued the chocolate)."

"Picked up this little 12 oz bottle at Total Wine last night. I did not know what to expect from this brewery in Salt Lake City Utah, but I like Imperial IPA's a lot and always willing to take the gamble. Jackpot! Pours rich and creamy into a tulip glass. A nice slim head and very rich lacing stays until the the last drop. This is a somewhat boozy, total black beer. It starts out malty sweet with chocolate and coffee overtones, but quickly surrenders to the Hops and 109 IBU's at the finish. This is a very complex beer. Not the best BLACK IPA that I have ever had, but definitely in my top 5. I am now going to include Uinta Brewing Company on my search list when looking for something unique to share with my friends."

"This beer reminds me of Myrcenary Double IPA , by Odell Brewing Co.   These two are tied for first place .  They both have an awesome robust flavor and a wonderful aftertaste .  Great sipping beers .  Unita's  Hopnosh is a close second ......"

"Overall (4.50/5): This is easily one of the best Black IPAs on the market and the best one that I have had, beating the exceptional Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous out with the extraordinary mouthfeel. Way to go, Uinta. You have my attention."

"Nice. It's dark and has a really high IBU ,makes a good combination for me. Higher alcohol but does not taste it, quite smooth. Bought this in Cleveland somehow. Kind of reminds me of some Stone IPA product. Very good overall. Would buy it again if I see it- ever."

"A good black IPA, peaks early with the aroma but can't quite follow up with such promise. Balanced malt and hops it just need more carbonation and a brighter hops to pop the way some others are able to do,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark oily brown with a tan head and plenty of lace. Aroma has herbal hops, citrus and some roasted malt. In the taste, more unsweetened dark chocolate and coffee like malt flavor that has good hop balance. Some earthy bitters and dirty citrus round out the flavor. Full bodied and relatively smooth. Overall, you can't complain about a big balanced hoppy black ale. It does not suck at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The common flaw in ""black"" IPA is that they usually result in a hoppy porter and resemble American IPA in no way. However, the imperialized porter supports in Dubhe gives this dark beer a roundness that's even still commanded by hops."

"O- If my memory serves me correctly, this beer tasted almost identical to Wookey Jack. The aromas were heavenly, but the taste ended far too burned and bitter for my palate. Huge flavors, nice complexity, just not my style."
"O: Very interesting black IPA. The aroma was pretty standard but the flavor is full of hop character. This would be almost unbearably bitter and hoppy if not for the strong roasted malt. As-is, it is extremely strong and bitter (and I love big bigger IPAs). It would just be over the top, instead it is just extremely strong :)"

"Overall: A big, bitter imperial black ale. Lingering bitterness. The hemp seeds set this black ""IPA"" apart from the rest. Well done Uinta."

"Pours a clear dark brown with garnet highlights at the edges and a huge bubbly tan head that persists forever. Aromas of earthy pine dominate with bits of caramel and chocolate in supporting roles. The flavor is rich chocolate and caramel malt with lots of earthy pine and citrus hop flavor. Moderate to high level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. I enjoyed this brew. It's just at is expiration date which I didn't notice at the store, but its still drinking really well. I'd like to revisit this with a fresher bottle as this one has lots of porter like qualities to it at this time."

"O: definitely a hopped-out stout - how could you argue?.... love the mint chocolate element... not too much different than the lion's share of black ales, but all the flavors are potent and matched... easy sell"
""
"Overall a pretty decent beer for the style."
"Overall- This is such a great CDA (sorry, but I call 'em CDA's). It's very dark, yet aromatic as can be with that enormous amount of hops. It's sweet yet balanced. Maybe not as dry as some others but it is still my favorite Black IPA/CDA by far. It really can't get better and this beer has a serious punch. For me on this review I was one and done."

"Pours a mostly clear dark brown with thick very dense light brown head... settles slowly leaving rings of thick lace down the glass. Smell: lots of pine, some herbal and spicy pops, beneath is ripe plum and notes of dark bread, dark chocolate, anise. Taste: loads of pine, a little hot, sugary dark fruit, citrus peel, notes of anise(-ish) and chocolate towards the finish. Full bodied, very creamy and luxurious feel that slowly fades out into a hop drenched finish. Very enjoyable. Best by 7/28/14."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights all around the glass. The thin head is like frothed, whipped milk. The smell is very much like a cross between imperial stout and IPA. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts along with piney hops. Taste leans a lot more towards imperial stout. This actually reminds me of yeti a lot, but with a slightly higher hit of hops. Hop bitterness isn't overbearing. Mild acidity in the finish. Lots of roast in the body. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, but not overly heavy. Delicious."
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with two finger head and lace patches. A nice blended aroma of citric, piney hops and roasted malts with a hint of dark chocolate. I found this beer to be what I prefer for a ""Black IPA"" as the body is thick, almost chewey, has a strong malt base with roasted malts and some sweet chocolate yet the balance is great b/c of a very strong bitter citric hop presence that gives off hoppy goodness on each sip and leads to a crisp and filling finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great beer, near perfect roast/caramel balance in the nose and taste, but it seems to be malt heavy in the mouthfeel. Great tasting and would look for it again."

"O - definitely one of the top 3 American Black IPA's I've had. Not sure it quite takes the top spot, but it has the quality to put it very close. This is a great Black IPA and one I will pick up again soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my first brew from Uinta. I do believe they've just recently added the bluegrass state to their dist. list. I'm glad they did. Not as much roasted malt flavor as other black ales I've had but a very tasty beer nonetheless."
""
""
""

"O: Delicious! I love the pineapple, and the combination of fruity hop character and the chocolate/coffee flavor of the roasted malt is amazing."
"O- I wish this beer came as a 6 pack and at a slightly lower ABV but if you can't love the beer you want then love the beer you're with. This beer is a real pleasure, I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black color with a thick, light brown foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Aroma of licorice, dark chocolate and slight coffee.  A more roasted malty taste with a licorice/dark chocolate aftertaste.  Big hoppy burst.  Somewhat astringent, soapy aftertaste.  Has long been one of my favorite beers.  It still is."

"O: Great brew. Nothing really stands out. Not nearly as bitter as the 109 IBU's. The dark malts help to accentuate the fruitiness of the hops. While it doesn't meld perfectly, it's still damn tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with a 2 inch head that lasts. Excellent lacing. Smells of hop with some apple and fruit in the background. Malt is not balanced on the nose as in some other beers. Excellent taste, hop forward with very balanced malt on the palate as well as some caramel and roasted notes. Very nice. The mouthfeel is great as well medium bodied with small bubbles. Overall a great beer. Excellent with cheese too by the way."
""
"What a beer! Jet black color... the nose wasn't that great but that's the ONLY weakness... Let me tell u what, this is one bad-ass beer. I bought this in my local grocery store as part of a ""pick your 6"" pack. Admittedly, I thought the bottle looked different and I hadn't had it so I grabbed it. Lucky me, this is one hell of a beer. Nice dark stouty feel with the thickness and hop of a double IPA. I don't know all the technical terms, but this beer is complex and delicious. Oh by the way, at 9%+, it's gonna knock u on your hiney. One of my new favs, headed back to buy more!"
""
""
"O- A nice surprise from a brewery I've never tried before. I hope to try some more Uinta stuff soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of only a few very successful marriages of an imperial stout malt bill with a big IPA hop profile. It's certainly reminiscent of good, sticky marijuana, and as one who has been known to indulge, this is an almost addictive brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent black IIPA, highlighting the hop profile but still allowing the malts to come through."
"O- a really good black IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It is a great black IPA, it has the best of both worlds. You get the great strong hop taste coming from it and then the stout/porter roast notes and dark chocolate."
"This is a gem!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - 4.25 - This is a good beer. It's an economical one too, just like Hop Notch. Thanks Uinta!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark reddish-brown with a half a finger head. A bit boozy to the nose with a bit of grain and malt. WOW. Extremely smooth. Goes down extremely easy for such a high ABV beer. The booziness comes through a bit in the aftertaste but it's not overwhelming. This is a high quality IPA. I would absolutely recommend it to a friend."
""
""
"o: this is really nice, and completely different from other black IPAs I've tried, which tend to be like a normal IPA plus dark malt. I'm intrigued now to find out if there are other beers called ""imperial IPAs", and if they taste like this, or if this is something completely unique."
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft aromas of herbs, grains, cocoa, and barley. Black appearance with a tan foam line. Smooth flavors of herbs, roasted caramel, juicy grapefruit and citrus overtones. Other subtle notes of coffee beans, molasses, chocolate and hop resin. Overall, a very nice black IPA. smooth and flavorful. very noticeable alcohol finish."
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty. Consistently good all the way through. A highlight from this brewery."
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good black IPA. I especially like the 9.2% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this was a good DIPA. It was interesting with the earthy aroma and flavor. It was a little bitter for my preference. I wouldn't buy again, but I would drink it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is great black ipa. It has a solid bite of hops, not overly sweet malt base, and best of all a huge ABV. Definitely a great beer for the fall season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty awesome black ale and the alcohol is merely noticeable. Porter, stout, nope. It's a delicious black ale."
"O: Nicely done black IPA. Very similar to others I have had (21st amendment)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"TOTAL = 40/50"
""
"The beer is a black imperial IPA brewed with hemp seed so the interest factor goes up by a whole lot. The beer is dark with a strong hop taste. This beer would rate up there with the best of any black IPA I have ever tried. I also thought that the name was creative! The ABV on this beer is 9.20% which is up there but it does not deter from the taste of this beer at all."
"Bottle in a tumbler. Pours a dark, coffee black with a good amount of foam. Not much aroma. Taste is dark, roasty, and bitter. It is described as being brewed with hemp seed, but I'm not sure what that contributes as I don't know what hemp seed tastes like. Overall, it is quite complex but still drinkable even with the high ABV."
""
"This is the best Uinta I've had; it also fares very well as a black IPA. Cheers!"

"Overall: I have had this beer a number of times and I struggle with it each time; while it has its merits, the flavors just don't blend together very well so I find the beer quite unbalanced"
"It's pronounced ""doo-bee"". Don't ask me how to pronounce Uinta. Love this beer though. Bought it in a 4 pack for $10 (perfect!), this is a fantastic, boozy black IPA. The hop aroma is overpowered by the alcohol fumes, but you won't mind once it starts to warm your belly! The bitter chocolate of the malt and grapefruit of the hops are the most prominent flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an absolutely fantastic example of a cascadian dark ale. The mouthfeel is phenomenal and each sip is an absolute pleasure. I personally can't tell if the hemp seeds are adding to the earthiness of the flavor, but regardless, it's nice to see some experimenting with hemp seeds. Highly recommended for those who are fans of dark and hoppy ales."
""
""
"Overall - very good high ABV black IPA; a bit heavy, somewhat syrupy, but well done. I'll come back to this on a cold day!"
"o: Wow! This beer means business! Makes a great nightcap. Hops tend to dominate, but not to the detriment of the flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"Poured this from a bottle into a snifter. It was black with a tan head and tons of lacing. The nose was awesome- lots of hops and very malty. I loved the taste- very nice imperial IPA with loads of hops and a malty backbone. I was (pleasantly) surprised that a rauch taste didn't present itself. The mouthfeel was great- nice n thick with good carbonation. Not sure how a an Imperial Black IPA should be scored in terms of overall score, since it was my first, so I gave it a 4.5. Would I have it again? HELL YES!"

"If you're meandering through the great state of Utah, order a round of this fine ale. Grab a few bottles to take home. Bring a couple for me."
""
""
""
"A huge beer. Says it is brewed with hemp seed. Not sure why or what that is adding, but OK. Poured into a large goblet from a 12oz bottle, not quite black, more mahogany, with a very thin head that I didn't think would ever show up despite my increasingly aggressive pour. Smells like fig, raisin, soy sauce, and pine. Taste is dark fruit, smoke, and hop bitters. No detectable alcohol to me, but there are some really strong elements contending here. Overall, a nice stoutish-IPA with huge ABV. Couldn't see drinking more than one of these, but I'd probably get another single again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A big, enjoyable black IPA. Seemed a little disjointed but hits all the characteristics you would expect given the brewer's label of this one. For the price, it's tough to beat. Well done."

"Beautiful Black Imperial IPA, full of flavors with strong character in all three key ingredients. I loved the constant interchanging taste feature. A must try beer."
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its inclusive aroma. Here we met nice fruitiness, solid hoppiness, creaminess, and hearty, grainy grit. These notes all made their way to the flavoring but were pushed a bit too far to the side by the boisterous booze that seemed to invade each aspect of the sip. Thus, at times, it was rather harsh, but enough room was left for the nicer, thicker qualities of the hops and grain to poke through. On another positive note, the label is one of the simplest, most elegant we’ve seen in recent memory, which is partly why we were so excited for this one. Expect a strong beer from the get go, but don’t be surprised if it isn’t as balanced as you would have liked."
"Heavier bodied and a piney finish. Long after taste, leaves the mouth feel a big slick. Run of the mill black ipa, the imperial might hurt it a bit."
""
"O: The taste is good - not great - the aroma is not very good at all. This is an okay beer. It has some complexity, is not terribly drinkable (which is okay). Worth trying one, not something you'd necessarily actively seek out."

"O: This is an extremely enjoyable imperial black IPA. In all aspects, this beer is pleasing, balanced, simple, and still interesting. I really have zero complaints. Must try!!"
"The complete experience of this brew is very positive. I must say that the only part I don't truly love is the scent right at the point of each sip. But the changing nature of each taste and balance of different stylistic elements make this a great craft. I'd say this is a must-have in the class of Black IPAs."
"O- The good blend of hops and roasted malt make this a pleasure to drink. Its even balance makes this not quite a stout and note quite an IPA but it has a perfect medium."
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that has great flavor but goes down rather smooth for an Imperial Black IPA."

"One of the better black IPAs I've had and its really a style I'm not super fond of, but I'd buy this again."

"Wonderful beer. So much character and depth. This would appeal to anyone into big stouts and porters, but with an equal affinity for hops. Just hits the hops and malt flavors in a big way. So happy to have tried this."
""
""
""
"This was probably the best Black IPA I’ve had to date. Very complex and interesting. Not just a porter with some extra hops."

"Poured into becker pint glass; pours jet black with a huge fluffy tan head that fades slowly leaving tons of rocky lacing. Smell is huge citrusey and piney hops with a strong malt backbone; some alcohol present in the nose too. Taste is a perfect blend of huge bitter piney hops and bittersweet chocolate malts, with a full body. A delicious black ale, one of my favorite styles; and I love it in an ""imperial"" version."

"Pours black with red highlights around the edges. Mocha colored head of creamy foam that fell off to a rocky cap and clinging lace. Nose is understated and a graceful blending of chocolate and piney hops. The fruit was there but not as prominent as it could have been. Chocolate was strong but not bitter on the nose, looks and smells like candy. Spice character is very faint and the malt opens up with the chocolate as it warms and some caramel and sugar. Taste is round and roasted. Hops are bitter but not aggressive. Drinks dry and doesn’t have a lot of aftertaste. Pine needles and a touch of cocoa on the back palate. Finishes with a bitterness that stops just short of harsh. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a little unbalanced as the roasted malt left a little sour like coffee that had sat in the pot too long. The alcohol really came through as this warmed and left a little burn going down. It was more carbonated than it looked. This was a vigorous imperial black ipa that really gets your attention."
""
""
""
"O - Maybe I just don't get the style, I don't know. I figure it should have much more in the way of hop flavor if it has the IPA badge on it, and not just flavorless bitterness. Way too roasty, little hop character (other than bitterness). Even if the hops were more present, the flavor combination of roasted malt and pine/citrus hops just isn't going to work for me. Not gettin' this one again."
""
""
""
"O-I have been looking for a great Black IPA and this one is it. The aroma and flavor are what you are looking for with this style. The hop and malt bill balance each other out very well and works perfectly in the smell/taste of the beer."

"O - Probably the best thing Uinta brews for sure. Great Black IPA"
""
""

"This is a pretty tasty example of a Black Imperial IPA. The hops and malts are balanced well and complement one another. No sign of the high alcohol content, so beware! I would definitely buy this again."

"Taste starts with citrusy and floral hops along with roasty malts, the roasty malts quickly overpower the hops then comes a strong chocolate taste (more than smell) along with a bit of hemp seed in the finish. Has a crisp, but very roasted finished. Has a medium body with a bit of a buttery/creamy feel, low carbonation. Black IPA's arent my favorite, but this one has a good name, and is a very good beer."
"Had on tap at the Sierra Grille. Drink was poured in a tulip glassware. Drink looked beautiful. Jet black with a brown, frothy head. The aromas were rich and malty, with a burnt cocoa mixed with citrus hints. Just loved smelling the drink from the glassware. Delicious drink with alcohol hints with creamy toffee and hops. Mouthfeel was great; helped the drink have a frappe-y, creamy texture with little carbonation. Overall, this was fantastic."

"4.01/5.00"

"Overall: This beer was bought on me being random on my last trip to Pennsylvania. Stayed in my fridge for about a week and absolutely awesome. I honestly think I found my favorite ""black ipa"". Thank you Uinta for making a classic. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"Not as thick or heavy as a stout but with a bit more body than a typical IPA, though it falls within the medium-bodied range, this beer drinks more to that end. It has a solid cripness and flows smoothly."

"Beer brewed with hemp seed from Utah! Just that is worth a point or two, or a pint or two, or a pour or two. Makes me wonder if the brewers are just saying Eff You to the stereotypical Utahian. Yeah, I pretty sure that's what you call someone from Utah. This beer was so tempting sitting on the shelf, I had to give it try. Very cool labeling, ""imperial black", hemp seed, 9.2% alcohol, its motto ""earth, wind, and beer", who wouldn't want to give it a go? The beer pours a very dark golden brown, but if you can get light through it, its golden orange color is very appealing. Very very light aroma to the point I had to almost dip the tip of my nose in the beer to smell it. Not that I really care about the smell though so I in fact liked that fact. I also worked to pour the beer with a head but this beer does not foam. Virtually no head although again, I don't really care much for head (well, on my beer I don't)! One sip of this beer and it seems to figure out how to coat your mouth in a nice thin layer of yum! While I am not the world's biggest IPA fan, I really like this beer for its drinkability. Not an overwhelming bitterness, despite its 109 EBU rating. Has a hint of licorice and chocolate but with a strong grapefruity profile. Definitely worth another go, but next time with a steak and not chips and salsa!"

"My pour was a little heavy-handed at first and I got some overflow as a result. Once things settled, I had two rocky fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention. It looked like meringue sitting there, defying me to mess with it. Color was actually garnet-red, believe it or don't. Nice clarity, allowing for light penetration when held up to strong light. Nose was when thinngs began to head south for me. It was minty, but with an odd smokiness overpowering the mintiness. Mouthfeel was medium and while I have had some instances where this style put me in mind of Girl Scout Thin Mints, this was not one of them. Instead, the malt lent it a burnt bitterness rather than a chocolatiness. The hops were definitely minty, but they were losing the battle. Finish was smoky, burnt and simply not to my liking."

"On tap at the Malted Barley. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of light tan head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of sweet citrus and pine hops with some chocolate and hints of roasted malts. The taste is more creamy chocolate, sweet citrus and pine. Roasted, smokey malts. Some burnt coffee and hops at the end. Creamy mouth feel. Nice alcohol presence. Overall, damn good and worth having again."

"12 oz 4 pack. Pours a pitch black with a quickly dissipating beige head. Aroma is of roasted malt with a hint of grassy hops. Taste is a nice balance between the roasted caramel and chocolate malts with a good hop bitterness. Average imperial abv that is surprisingly easy to drink and finishes clean. Overall this is a very nice representation of a black IPA."

"Overall, this is a good Black IPA, but nothing earth-shattering. I would love to try it again on tap to see if it adds anything to it (I'm a sucker for beer on tap)."

" This has a very pleasant pine flavor right off from the hops which cooperates well with the mild roastiness and subtle cocoa like element with a mild caramel body and light citrus element in the hop flavor with subtle coffee nuttiness and semi sweet finish with the hops pretty constant throughout. Overall a very quality Imperial IPA with a little black malt flavor - a great beer for it has a lot of flavor and lots of hops with a nice mild sweetness to balance and relatively low alcohol on the palate for the strength."

"I really love this ice-cold and it is super easy to put away. Love and appreciate the fact I can get this in 12 oz. bottle vs the 22 oz. bombers--thanks Uinta!

""
""
""
"Overall – The aroma of the beer and the flavors up to the very end of the taste were fantastic. The weaker mouthfeel and somewhat unbalanced end/aftertaste of the brew hinder it from being a truly great brew though. Regardless of this it is a tasty beer and well worth a try."
"Overall Drinkability: I will not only be having this again, I will be seeking it out. So glad it's now on tap in the Chicago area."
"Pours dark dark brown with a nice off white head that laces very nicely. Smell of hops, smoke, earthy. Taste starts with a fresh hop bite that opens to some chocolate, smoke, dark chocolate, but finishes again with a bitter hop aftertaste. This is extremely balanced and very enjoyable."
"O: This is one style that is really starting to grow on me. I used to absolutely hate it, but in this instance, Uinta really nailed it. Kudos!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer reminds me why black ipas are one of my favorite styles. The only thing I don't think would improve with more freshness with this beer is the color which is close to being a solid black, but might clear up my other problems, which were visible yeast and a weak smell. Were this available to me regularly I'd get it frequently"
""

"overall... i really like hoppy beers, but this seems to be lacking something that I can't put my finger on. Generally, i prefer hoppy beers with a smooth clean finish, but this is definitely not the case here. i could live without this beer."

"Love this beer. Love the politics behind this beer and its company. Poured into a tumbler. Good color, dark with a light coffee head and lacing. This is a great one and done beer, at 9.2 abv, one beer and I'm usually feeling like it is much higher than 9.2. The taste is distinct from other black IPAs. Has to be the hemp."

"Aroma is richly hoppy and grassy, with a smoky undertone and a hint of molasses - hard to beat that, at least in my mind that loves black IPAs (um, if you think about it, that’s an oxymoron) because I love dark beers and hoppy beers. It pours a luscious dark-chocolate brown that lets light in only at the edges and has a thick, fluffy, light tan head that likes to hang around. Flavor has a roast malt overtone with nutty, molasses, earthy and caramel notes plus hints of hops and licorice. Absolutely lip-smacking! Smooth, firm texture has plenty of fizz and life. I love black ""pale"" ales (personally, I prefer the term CBA, or Cascadian Black Ale) and this is one of the best I’ve had."

"A nice example of the style , that hides its ABV very well, another winner from Uinita!"

"O: Overall I thought it was a really good tasting ABA. I would drink it again. I'm not sure what the whole ""brewed with hemp seed"" thing is about, because I didn't notice anything particular about it in the beer. Anyway, the beer has a lot of pine character to it, so if you enjoy those hop flavors you will most likely enjoy this beer. The malt roasted presence is also there, without being overdone."

"O. 4.5. I have had my fair share of these in the last few years. An exceptional black IPA and the price point is great. I readily recommend if you like dark hoppy beers. It holds it's own. As far as the hemp seed oil.. I better not fail a drug test from drinking this! Drink responsibly!"
"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are several others in the style that I would pick first."

"The body on this beer was great, largely due to the increased abv no doubt, which made it an ideal beer to be enjoyed slowly. NIce bitterness, but again not as biting as I might expect from this style. Pleased overall, will seek out again."
"Pours an abysmal black, opaque against the light. Head is tan, a quarter finger that settles to nearly cover the top. Grassy, astringent, barkish, earthy hops. I get the feeling this is going to be brutally bitter in taste. Some sweet chocolate notes and slight caramel from the hops. Baker's chocolate and caramel malt start the flavor, yielding to bitter root, almost licorice. The hop bitterness is barkish, earthy, and is accompanied by strong alcohol presence. Beneath everything is some nectar or sweet honey from one of the hop varieties. Finish is balanced, leaving you with dark chocolate and licorice. Definitely a fan of this, but it is very strong, both in flavor and ABV. "
"everyone i know raves about it, as the name suggests, its brewed with hemp seed, and it tastes like they tried to cram every kind of flavor into the bottle. Sickly sweet and overly bitter,and it smells like old pineapple mixed with moldy hops, i really don't see how anyone can enjoy this hodgepodge of flavors."
""
"This is really tasty. I'm glad to have this available here in Maine."
"Overall, one of the better black ipas I've had. The roast malt and hops play well together, with the hops taking center stage. Very interesting brew! Tried a year later, and the roast malt and chocolate stand out more, and citrus notes are tamer than I recall. Still a great beer."

"O: What a great example of what a Black IPA should be. Very nice balance, easy to drink, and plenty of alcohol. I like it a lot!"
"O - A solid black DIPA that delivers. It's worth a buy."
""
"Black in color with mahogany tones on the edges of the glass. Poured with a short beige foam that reduced to a nice cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent pine and citrus hop aromas with grainy dark roasted malt aromas beneath. Thick, oily feel up front that transitioned to a grainy, reisnous feel at the end. Pungent pine and citrus, mostly pine, that ride over dark roasted malts. The hop and dark malts ceate an intense but flavorful bitterness. Finishes cleanly with a dark roasted malt, roasted coffee and pine hop aftertaste."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied with a good dose of carbonation that is a nice contrast to the smooth sweet feel of the grains. Hops are present and nicely acidic but could always be more for my taste. A solid brew that's worth checking out."
""
"O: I'm usually not very fond of this beer style but this one is an exception. A must try!"

"imperial black ipa with hemp seeds. this is a really unique brew. pours a nice dark brown smooth looking color with a very excited tan head on top that stays for awhile, leaving lots of lacing on the glass. the nose is not hops right away, but a complex combination of malts, chocolate and toast come up first, and maybe even some oats or something. there is a gentle sweetness too, followed by a growing bitterness. the whole thing culminates in a powerfully delicious brew. notes of coffee and burnt bagel at the end with the bitter hops, and a scarily well hidden alcohol potency that makes a 4 pack tough to get through without being dickered. velvet gentle mouthfeel, just enough bubbles for it to not be heavy, full body but not weighty at all. overall a sensational beer, one of the best ive had from uinta."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a very good beer that i would do again. As good as any black ipa i have had to date. Very easy drinking despite the high abv. Love the hop blast paired with chocolate malt - almost could be considered an imperial stout."

""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Great interpretation of a Black IPA. The mouthfeel I expect, not as thick or bitter as a stout, with a hop presence that is richly bitter but not over-top-taste that sits on pallet taking away from the malts."
""
""
""
""
"O: A bottle was gifted to me and I'm sad I haven't been able to find it on my own. This is a great brew. Not popping with flavor but a real easy drinker for an imperial. Plus, the creaminess is something I don't usually see in black IPAs and it is a great fit."

"O- A great black IPA, very hop. This is the second beer I have tried from Uinta and this is much better than the first. Will pick this up again."
"Bitter, herbal, minty hops up front. Wallop of sweetish, roasty, caramel-y malt barrels in. Hops turn more citrusy, but with plenty of resinous pine in tow. Finish is a mix of coffee and hop bitterness. Some lingering sticky malt. Medium-full body with a very creamy feel. Very well done!"
"O: a pretty good black ipa, again I'd say this one ends up a bit more on the ipa side of the spectrum, nice hop flavor here."
"Decent. Not mind-blowing. A good balance of malt and hops. I enjoy how the roast plays a role in flavor, rather than simply adding color."
""
""

""
""
"Well, I can see why people talk this beer up. It's nice to see beers that really go all the way out and exceed all others, but it's also nice to see beers that can match style parameters without having to be showy or out there to prove a point. I can definitely suggest this one."

"Overall, this an amazing ABA. Probably the best one I have ever had. The alcohol is barely present and the roasted character shines through remarkably. Something I will have to pick up again whenever I can find it."
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff. I like it really roasty like this. Very close to being exactly what I look for in an American Black Ale, though I have to say the claimed 109 IBUs really make this a palate-shredder. Tempted to lower the score here to 4.0 based on drinkability concerns, but I think I'll leave it at 4.5 for an ""overall"" positive impression."
""
""
""
""
"D - pretty well done, the hop character is nice with a pine character that works well with the roast. The malt character is, if anything too roasty, which is the opposite of the problem most black ipa seem to suffer from."
""
""
""
"O. Nice ABA. I like t how you can actually taste the pronounced roast unlike many ABAs that are to hop centric."
""
"Drinkability: This is a palate-wrecker of a brew, and one to take on, most likely, at the end of a sampling, or as the last pint at a bar. Though this isn't my favorite style, Uinta's doing a lot of great things here, and this is the kind I'd go back to: complex, nuanced, and strong. A good balance that, if done right, can be a kind of weird but very pleasurable experience for the palate, and I'm looking forward to trying more across the board in the future."
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a lighter roast and some pine hops. In the taste, a small hop and a small caramel like roast. A hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry pine hop and caramel maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice roast and big pine hops, hides the alcohol, and pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured hard from bottle into a Founders pint glass. Loads of light tan head with considerable lacing. Dark, dark brown, almost black coloring, with hints of deep red. From a distance, this would appear to be a stout. Look is fantastic. Smell is great too. Hints of smoke, but mostly I get sweet floral hops with some malt and maybe a bit of caramel. It smells nothing like it looks, I suppose overall smell is typical of an imperial IPA. Taste is similar -- like a smokey IIPA, and incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with little bite and carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, I wish I had picked up more than one bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Dubhe poured a deep black color, with a nice sized creamy tan head. Their was a nice strong smokey burnt floral aroma. The taste had strong bold hop flavors, with a strong smokey malty undertone, that finished bitter and dry. Nice strong flavors, and could drink a few of these easily. Overall a fantastic black ale."
"Overall this has been great every time I've had it, a standout for the style at a pretty good price. The hops are the showcase but good flavor all around."
"Smoothe, easily drinkable, if you don't mind the bitter hops on the end. If I look for it I can tell that there's a strong booze presence, but it's not readily apparent. Brewed with hemp seeds, huh?"
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 5/14/2012. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pine, orange rind, herbal, floral, roasted malt, chocolate, grass, and earthy spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance; very inviting and hoppy. Taste of pine, grapefruit, chocolate, roasted malt, herbal, floral, char, grass, citrus rind, and piny spiciness. Nice amount of piny bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, chocolate, roasted malt, char, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Nice balance of roasted malt flavors with pine and citrus hop flavors; long resinous hop finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. Very nice hop flavor profile with a good balance of roasted malt. Very enjoyable offering."
""
"O: I love DIPAs and I love stouts, but hybridize the two into a black ale and the results can be questionable at times (see: Stone SSR). This, on the other hand, is an example of the style done right. VERY well priced for what it is, and highly recommended. Even at three months old, this is damn good stuff."

"Overall I highly recommend trying this!"

"O: I would consider this a highly hopped robust porter as opposed to Black IPA but whatever.

"O: This might just be the best Cascadian Dark I've had. I love this beer, as it's much more hop forward then many in-style. I'd have this one tap, in the bottle, or drizzled into my mouth by a gorgeous (female) porn star. A delicious beer I'd ask for in my five-star suite."
"overall this is a great beer. not very familiar with the style, i think i only had 21st amendment back in black and wasn't a fan so i've avoided them. this is definitely better than what i remember the back in black to be. anyway, i really am enjoying the warmth from this one, even though it's the hottest day of the summer - it rained and cooled off a bit ... this is kind of what this beer feels like.. a summer night that turned on you, for the better."
"A good beer, yet a bit too strong in the overall bitterness and alcohol heat for me."
"O- Excellent black IPA. Extremely hoppy dark ale."

"Overall this a very tasty and exceedingly well balanced Black IPA, and one of the better ""Imperial"" versions of the style. Complex in flavor and drinkable for the ABV. This beer reminds me why I love this style. Recommended to any fan of the style or any BA looking to get into the gray area that is the American Black Ale. Cheers!"

"Beer is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate, but very ""soft"" carbonation, creating an overall smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Ethanol is rather prevalent, from mid-palate through the aftertaste, in the nostrils and throat, in the form of heat and slight burning. Nothing over-the-top, and well hidden for a 9.2% beer, but it still detracts somewhat from experiencing the other flavors, scents, and feel of the beer. Finish is dry, with a slight stickiness across the palate."
""
"O - Just the second Uinta brew I have had, but so far I am impressed. At three months old, the hops were not as prominent as I assume they intended (119 IBU?). However, the malt flavors carried this one and made for a brilliantly balanced beer. I look forward to trying a fresher one, but this was very good."

"Overall a nice hoppy black IPA very well done, not sure if hemp is noticed as hops smell like nice kind bud anyway but very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: earth, wind, and beer. Very cool. Hemp seed makes an interesting addition."
"O: I'm on and off with American black ales - never sure what I'll like, but this was a winner - perfectly melds the citrus pine hoppiness of a DIPA with the bitter espresso dryness of an American black ale"
""
""
"Overall: Though the hemp seed is an appreciated added ingredient, it's, for me, completely lost amidst the hard roastiness and heavy hoppiness. It's black, it's high on the alcohol scale, and it's bitter -- that's IN these days, right?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Finally a good black IPA. So many arent hoppy, some are just IPAs and you arent sure how it is a ""black IPA"". Perhaps you need an imperial IPA to create the right balance. Whatever the formula, this one has characteristics of both."
""
""
""
""
"Fresh from Chicago trip. Pours black with generous foam, resulting in 3/4"" offwhite topping on a black body. Roasty aroma. The hemp lends it a little ""roap"" and dryness, otherwise a black ipa all the way, just a higher abv route getting there. Above average mouthfeel, good drinkability."
""

""

"Overall - The strawberry(?) fruit note doesn't work all that well with the other black ipa flavours for me. It's still a fantastic beer, I just expected more due to how much I enjoyed their 'Hop Notch'."
"A dark amber in to my glass capped by an off white head.nose is piney, toasty, and chocolate. Taste is intense bitterness of pine, citrus, and earth with in a caramel, chocolate, and toasty back bone. Wish it were a bit more balanced. This beer epitomizes the notion of a sipper. I would say it was enjoyable but would seek something else if I were looking for a sipper."
"This beer is black as midnight with a thin head that leaves just a touch of lacing down the glass. The nose is malt forward with tones of alcohol and some hops although they are not the headliner. The flavor starts with malt, moves to a little heat from the alcohol with a nice balanced bitterness. After the bitterness subsides you get a great nutty/coffee flavor, really nice. You can tell that this was well brewed and precisely attenuated, the mouthfeel is just rich enough without being sweet and syrupy-eee. Overall a very enjoyable balanced entry into the black ipa or cascadian dark ale series... whatever you want to call it. Cheers!"
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark brown, almost black, with a fluffy, light, small bubbled off-white head. Aromas are subtle, with a slight chocolate and floral hops presence. Flavors are dark and dynamic, with a roasted chocolate and coffee backbone carrying the wet, resiny hops presence. The citrus highlights are there, but overpowered by the dark and roasty characteristics. Smooth bodied with a enough carbonation to avoid overpowering. The aftertaste is hoppy and roasted, both balanced to remain smooth. Slight sweet and hoppy finish, with a bitterness that draws you back in to drink more. At 9.2%, this is far too easy to drink."
""
"O: I'm a bit perplexed by my initial impression and the subsequent changes. Still, for the majority of the beer this is an enjoyable, quality example of a style that's rapidly becoming one of my favorites."
"Overall a very impressive dank-style IPA, reminds me of Resin or Dale's Deviant. Not quite as sticky but the dry clean finish is very welcome."
""
""
"O: A really nice black IPA; satisfying; hoppy yet out of balance; interesting with the hemp; and the label art is pretty cool."

"Not an everyday drinker, but lots of intrigue and quite pleasant. Could see beers like this acting as gateways for people who already like beer but not dark beer."

"Dark brown with some ruby highlights, beige head with dense lace but light retention. Hops are first to appear in the nose, citrus, clementine and some pine with a big cocoa and dark chocolate base. Says this was made with hemp seeds, and some herbal/seedy notes are present as well. Pine, berries and some tropical notes in terms of hopping with some dark fruits, chocolate, roast and a bitter piney/herbal finish. Medium full feel, sticky and bitter with a low carb. Sweeter than some Black IPAs, but fairly tasty."
""
""
"Really tasty Black IPA. Tons of flavor and balances the hops and dark malts very well. One of the best I’ve had in the style."
"Drinkability: Uinta did a good job on this with the excellent color and great balance. It's just like an earthy stout mixed with a well balance strong IPA. It's up there with Stone's sublimely self righteous."
"Overall, this beer was excellent. It's great to see Utah brewers trying new things. The hemp seeds provided a nice touch. It is nice to see the crazy Utah theocratic lawmakers allow brewers to make proper ABV beer that can only be sold in state run stores (pain in the booty when visiting). Unfortunately, any beer above 4 % ABV is only available in a state run liquor store. You can buy beer in supermarkets at 4% and below only. If you ever go to Utah (I seldomly do), find out where the liquor stores are and buy a pack of Dubhe! It goes well with beef and nacho chips,w/salsa, and spicy guacamole. I recommend this ale. Cheers!"

"O: a terrific black IPA; a style where brewers often flop IMO. I'll seek this out again in the future!"
"O - This was my first imperial black IPA and I can say I definitely appreciate the style. It's much more than (as some people say) just an imperial IPA with dark coloring. The toastiness adds a nice touch. I can see myself drinking this on a cool fall evening, although the sweetness makes me want to only have one. I personally would like a little thinner body."

"A well done American Black Ale, the hop character blends nicely into the malt notes."
"Overall, this is my first ever Uinta offering, and after having my doubts being that I'm not a huge fan of this style, I rather enjoyed this beer alot, and would definately both have again and recommend."

"O: I wouldn't say that the beer is balanced but it is good. I like the bold hops, bitterness and the rich malt flavor. I need to drink sublimely self-righteous again and to review it to see how it holds up."
"On tap at Slater's 50/50 in San Diego. Pours a dark black with adequate head and lacing. Aroma is a nice oily, piney, roasted malty, sensory boost. Taste is a little more hoppy than most I've had from this style, with pine and citrus dominating the roasted coffee and subtle cocoa malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit boozy and warming. Liked this one - would have it again."
"O: Pretty decent brew. Its a little on the hot and bitter side, but good overall."
""
"A solid black-brown colored DIPA with a decent chocolatey-tan head that settles to a respectae foam cap with a nice chunky lace in retreat. The aroma is quite evident and brings deep earthy malt with tropical fruit and citrus hop highlights. Woodsy and herbal and a bit of licorice. This gets the digestive juices going, very edible. The taste buds pick up on near peaty earthiness with more of a hint of chocolate-licorice and the hops take on more of the herbal/seaweed side for a pungent, somewhat swamp-funk. It mostly comes down to a herbal-grassy sort of hop bite that is somewhat mellowed by the root beer malt. It takes a little getting used to the flavors but they settle down and it’s definitely a goody. It’s a medium-plus bodied brew with modest carbonation for a satiny smooth feel. Very enjoyable!"
""
""
""
"After taking in the aroma, I wasn't sure I would enjoy this more so than other abas I've had. The hops were overly dominant and I thought it wouldn't have enough malt to stand up to the hops. Upon tasting it though, it proved me wrong. A great black ale overall."
"The dry, yet smooth palate. Helps lubricate the palate for a long slow sip of bitter pleasure."
""
""
"It was very enjoyable, but it kinda felt like something was missing too. I'm not sure what, but I would like to pick this up again."
""
"Overall - What a fantastic beer, I am contemplative after every sip. There is so much depth and complexity here, but so completely well balanced. I would not recommend having weaker styles after one of these, as it will dominate your palate - but in a most wonderful way. My favorite style is a nice DIPA, and this has some nice similarities. Hop lovers take note, this is a must try!"

"Overall a very good black ale. Probably second to Odell Mountain Standard but both are worth a try if you have them in your area."

"6/25/2014-had it on tap and it looked amazing, smelled of roasted malt, coffee and citrus hops, and tasted of fresh citrus and floral hops mixed with cocoa powder, burnt coffee, brown sugar, charcoal and toffee. Damn tasty black IPA that had perfect mix of hops and malts along with perfect balance."
""
""
"Overall. Nice beer to satisfy your hop craving."
"O: Aggressive Black IPA but really enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"The big full body of the beer is necessary to contain all the complexities within it. Quite a tongue slapper. Some of the flavors play off eachother in a unique way while others are just bizarre. Not exactly a layered taste experience but not a well blended one either. Overall good and incredibly unique but not something I'd buy again. This one space visit was strange enough."
""
""
"Overall I would totally consider it again but it's one of those ""Halftime beverage"" beers so I will have to pick up a few when they have another free shipping offer."
"O: This beer is a very nice representation of the style and hides its alcohol quite well."
""
""
"O: a nice double black IPA and my first for the style, i found it to be a bit strong on the carbonation and the alcohol was slightly unmasked but overall it was good"
""
"Perhaps my only critique of this offering is that the harshness of the alcohol on the finish was a bit overdone."
"Overall it was very good. Nice amount of strong bitterness but a mild sweetness that complemented the flavor."
"Overall, this is fantastic beer, and should be on any hop head's must try list. Perhaps more brewers should consider using hemp seed, because this beer is so well blended that the massive IBUs come across cleanly, even if a little bite-y. Well worth seeking out."
"Picked this up on a whim even though I'm not a fan of black IPA's. $9 for a four pack and it was bottled 12/22/11 so it was about seven weeks old at the point I drank it. Dark black color which is no surprise, decent head. Smells slightly hoppy, roasted malt, not bad at all. I like it already. Taste is oily citrus, kind of sweet, not bad and exactly what I like from a strong black IPA. Overall, I'll buy this again once in a while."

"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, faint mahogany highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Grapefruit nose, flavor is grapefruit hops, lingering bitter aftertaste, the high ABV is hidden. Bottled Jan 2012, $3.45 for a 12oz bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown appearing black with red highlights at the edges. One finger light tan head continually renewed by carbonation and nice lacing. Aroma of herbal hops, light malt with faint chocolate and roasted elements, smells good. Flavor is mellow dark malt, herbal and citrus hops, hint of chocolate, finishing quickly with a lingering hop bitterness with just a hint of earthiness, probably from the hemp seed. Medium body with a hint of creaminess. Dark malt body not as assertive as some black IPAs, but enough to balance the flavor and support the hops. A tasty, well made IPA"
""
""
"Overall: A nice and piney black ale. The aftertaste is a bit different/odd but that is the only thing holding this one back...and even that is not enough to offset the rest of this great tasting beer. A solid beer that I will get again."
"12oz bottle, pours dark brown-black with some mahogany hues when held to the light. Nice fluffy head that sticks around for awhile, and leaves a sticky lacing on the glass. Aromas are floral hops and roasted malts with some hemp - but I feel it's my head playing tricks on me because I know it's in there. Tastes are nice and full with a rich complexity of roasted malt, loads of pungent pine and grapefruity hops, with some notes of baker's chocolate, and hemp with a hint of white pepper. Mouth-feel is full-bodied, creamy and smooth with an oily and astringent finish. Overall, I'm very impressed with this Uinta offering. I haven't been to thrilled with some of their other stuff I've tried and was ready give up on them, but this is a definite must-try!"
""
"remarkable finish this beer is better on tap than I remember the bottle to be. Gooey resin like presence of sweet and tart combined There is a competition between the chocolate bittersweet and the hop citrus. that is at the same time piney a lingering finish"
""
"Amazing beer. Pours a really dark red, just enough color to see through. The scent has a bit of malt and some liquor. For having a liquor scent this is a really smooth drink. Creamy texture. Something you could sip on, but at the ABV it's at, it'll sneak up and kill you. Recommended for anyone that can get one."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a tan head on top. The lacing was decent along with the retention. The smell of the beer gave of some hoppy notes along with a good amount of coffee/chocolate aromas. The taste of the beer was well balanced with the bitterness and the rich roasted sweetness. The mouthfeel of the beer was slightly creamy, had a light carbonation to it. Overall this beer was pretty good. I would drink it again. I wasn't able to really find what Hemp Seed tastes like though from it."

"This took a while to down because it was so strong but this grew on my quickly. I love how this style has taken off and anyone looking for a good representation would not need to look any further than here. Boldness works with this brew and the outside clearly matches what's on the inside of the bottle: beautiful and certainly not to be missed."
""
"O- This is another solid offering from Unita at a very affordable price. Very easy to drink. Try this one of you are into ABAs."
""
"Poured a black color, this IEP have an inch of head in the appropriate glassware. The citrusy aroma was quite pontent, with definitive scents of grapefruit and a mild burnt/nutty type scent. The initial taste was biscuity, but that taste quickly melted into more potent tastes. Chocolate and citrus hops were dominant with a reasonably smooth mouthfeel. It was a little like one of those chocolate orange slice things, except the flavor of this IPA screams for your attention. Dark chocolate haunts the aftertaste with hints of the hops still hanging around. In this sense, the chocolately flavors overpowered the hops too much."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, decent example of a black ale...I tend not to be a huge fan of the style - burnt flavors interfere a bit too much with my American hop flavors! I would call this a well made, but fairly typical example of the style. If you enjoy black ales definitely give this one a chance."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a murky dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, roasted malt, citrus hop, and pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, pine, pine hop, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one was what one would expect from this style with a nice hoppiness and a nice roastiness on top of that. The flavor on this one was pretty nice and hoppy with a touch of alcohol on the followthrough. Worth trying if you get the chance or are a curious hop-head."
"pours black, good head, lace. not blown away by the smell, but this beer opens up with tasty, roast, black, and chocolate malts followed by a nice hoppy, earthy, very dank with biting bitterness. impressive, had 3 could have had another. very reasonable value $10 4 pak, would purchase again."
""
"Most ""balanced"" IPAs start with hops and finish with malt but this seems to be the opposite. The toasted and chocolate are first out of the box and the pine and grapefruit come in the finish and aftertaste. Considering this sucker clocks in at 9.2, it holds up quite well, which is a credit to the mouthfeel. My brother was right on. I could easily get into trouble with this beer, as it isn't harsh or withering, and is immensely smooth and sessionable for the octane."
"O: It's ok but there s better BIPAs out there. Odell Mountain Standard and Loose Cannon come to mind."
"Notes: Very solid all the way through the fruitiness is well paired with the sweetness a nice drinkable beer. Cheers."

"Taste: Reminiscent of a Russian Imperial Stout or something similar to Nightstalker by Goose Island. Due to its enormity, the beer has a slightly elevated roast/chocolate/acrid note. The beer is amazing though. A big malt profile mingles with spicy, piney, resinous hops; finishes dry with the roast and resin hanging around on the palette. Yum - a nice winter beer worth seeking out again."

"pitch black body with some lighter bown around the edges. a half finger of off white head settles down to a thin skin on top with some lacing, but not much. big pine aromas are the first to greet the nose. after it opens up i can detect some citrus hops, cocoa, smoked malts and hemp. all these things blend well to create an outstanding flavor. sticky hemp and oily hops create a full bodied feel with good carbonation. has a dry smokey finish with a pine after taste. this is a really good beer. big thanks to vegasbeerman for sending this as an extra!"
"Cheers to Uinta for their craft!"
"upping the taste to 4.5, and the overall as well... my taste has come around to this a little more -- and throw it up against STONE sublimely self righteous and i think this comes out on top --- the abv is a little high, but this is the best black ipa out there."

"A black beer with red highlights and a very short head. This one ended up being a lot more enjoyable than it appeared on the pour. The aroma is hoppy, with a roasted malt quality. Cereal and bread-crust, malt, grapefruit and pine cones. Nice. There's not as much alcohol in the aroma as I expected, given the ABV. The taste, however, has a serious kick. Lots of bitterness, booze, and highly roasted/burnt flavors. Warming. The beer is substantial, and has a massively intense back-taste. Very enjoyable."
"O-an interesting black IPA with nice balance"
"Overall - great flavor profile, big brew"
"Overall not bad but too many different flavors that don't mesh well at all. The hemp seeds are weird on their own, and the piney hops as well as citrus and want to be grapefruit hops curdle the creamy dark malt almost porter like background that don't blend nearly as well as other ABAs. then theres the super bitter astringent finish..."
"Dark unsweetened chocolate, bitter and resiny, leafy greens, pine, underlying toasty malt sweetness that tempers the bitterness a little. Very smooth and supple feel, lightly sticky on the lips, medium to full bodied. Alcohol is hidden, sipping is easy. The full flavors encourage slow savoring. This is a really nice Black IPA, it's very cohesive with equally vibrant hop greenery and deep roasted malt complexity. Will look for more of this before it's gone."

"12 oz. bottle served in tulip glass. Pours a mostly opaque, dark brown color with a decent, light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is dark, roasted malts, hints of alcohol, citrus and resiny hops. Flavor is roasted malts, spicy (almost like a rye malt spicy), resiny and citrus (grapefruit) hops, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium, oily, and bitter. Good beer."
"This one of the better takes on the Black IPA style that I’ve had in a while, with those fresh hops right at the front and center (this was a pretty fresh bottle and it showed), while those darker malts sitting along the back and compliment them, just as they should be. If they would dial the ABV back a bit, this may well could be one of the best that I’ve had. I really enjoyed it."
""
"O - A good beer, but as mentioned in the taste critique, slightly less roast character and more hops would align more closely with my definition of Imperial Black IPA."
"Pours a dark black liquid with a frothy beige head and slight lacing. Barleywine anyone? Totally has the aroma and whiffs of a barleywine with some dark malts in the mix. Slight candy, figs and wood also abundent. The taste is very nice. Smokey taste with some hearty roasted malts, some leather and a nice coffee bean/espresso swallow and aftertaste. The hoppiness is there if you need it. Pretty chewy mouthfeel. Overall I was again impressed with another Uinta brew. I had no clue about this brewery until a little over a year ago but I am a fan. Good stuff here. And it has hemp seed. +1."

"Overall, another great brew from the State of Utah. This is a very nice black ipa."
"D- Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this beer. If you like black IPAs, this is a must-have. Unique, complex, full of character, and fun to drink."

"It's an opaque black with a dark brown head and smells like pine and roast. Depth of earthy, nutty, and chicory flavor from the dark malt and then the citrus hops offer an amazing brightness and bitterness... it's all kind of hot, but comes together well, with a sticky but well-carbonated mouthfeel. Every flavor is in excess but somehow this is an awesome beer! Melds together amazingly."
""
""
"Notes: Well worth the recommendation and the repeat if one is into this range. Not too complex or hefty, but in this case that might like the asset. It is very well balanced without loosing any of the expected assertiveness of the style. The hemp is there but very softy, blending well with the herbal hop range."
""
""
"D: good nose and flavors, but definitely a sipper. wouldnt exactly call this super drinkable considering i feel like this is more of a nightcap. overall worth grabbing if you can find it."
""
"Pours pretty damn black under a lovely, soapy tan head that leaves behind abundant drippy lacing. Deep, dark malty aroma with pine and alcohol...sweet chocolate and light citrus. Coffee and chocolate upfront in the flavor, followed by a solid, resinous wall of hoppy bitterness. It's seeming hoppier with each sip; grapefruit and sticky pine along with some charred maltiness. Smooth, medium-full body with an oily slickness. I like it...this bottle is a few months old, so I'll likely get a super-fresh one (with the fancy new label) and see how it compares."
"Pour is solid black. Head was a creamy light brown with super lacing. Aroma had tons of floral notes, crisp pine, roast and bits of chocolate. Taste was nicely bold, with plenty bitterness, pine and floral hop notes, but a much stronger ""stout"" characters: chocolate, roast, slight coffee. Body was full, and almost chewy."
"Overall, a fantastic excursion from the ordinary. At over $10 for a 4-pack it's not for everyday drinking but I will be bringing this to the next poker game."
"Solid medium body, almost creamy. Just a little warming. Drinks pretty well. Solid from Uinta."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is primarily of herbal and citrus zest hops with some roasted malt and cocoa powder aromas as the beer warms. Taste is of citrus zest and spicy herbal hops up front with dark roasted malt and cocoa flavors coming in with the aftertaste. A mild hop bitterness lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good black ale with some nice hop and roasty flavors."
"Uinta Dubhe pours a nearly solid black. When properly backlit, the very edge of the beer lightens to mahogany. There's a full three fingers of caramel head that just sits there for a minute before beginning it's slow decline, and it leaves more than enough lacing against the inside of the glass. The nose quickly indicates that this is a black IPA that takes some flavor from dark malts, as opposed to just color, as there are definitely notes of coffee and chocolate present in the aroma. The hops show themselves as well, citrus and earthy. A mild coffee and chocolate maltiness leads of each sip. The mid palate bitterness is way too mild. It doesn't effectively knock back the malty opening, and the sweetness dampens the opening of the hoppy back end (citrus and earth in a fairly even blend). The body has a littel bit of heft to it, which in and of itself is just fine, but that ends up overwhelming a carbonation level that's just totally inadequate. Dubhe isn't a bad beer, but the lck of bitterness and dull carbonation make it not nearly as crisp as most IPAs, black or otherwise."
"Overall this is just a fantastic, complex beer. I've never been big on black IPAs but they don't all taste this good. That's two I've had from Uinta, and I am impressed so far."
"I live in Northern California and this is the first time I have had access to Uinta beer. I can’t wait to try more!"
"Overall a real strange smelling beer, but makes up for it considerably in appearance and taste. It's like a good mix of hoppy IPA and stout like roast and chocolate all together, but considerably hop forward."
"This is an absolutely cracking brew. Rich and smooth, but bright and crisp as well. Truly this is a hallmark of the style. I'm shocked I gave away my first bottle."
"DUBHE pours into the glass a dark brown color with some black in there as well, a mix of the two leaning towards black. A nice loose bubbled dark tan foam rose up and retreated after some minutes, okay retention, weak lacing. Off the bat, this does not smell like a IPA, black ale is a good term for this beer. Smells grainy roasty with some small storm king like hop scents with a touch of the 9.2% coming out. This comes off like a hoppy porter with some tropics of a IPA without exibiting the bitterness of one. Feel is a nice healthy medium with a nice carb but goes down smooth and not bitter. Im glad I got this on happy hour the because this is not a good example of a black IPA, whatever that is."
"Overall: a nice Black IPA. I knew I would not be disappointed picking up a four pack, but I am disappointed I did not pick up more. I will hunt for it if I have to, Great Job by Uinta again!"
"Had this in a snifter at TJ's. Poured red-black with a smallish mocha head which dissipated to a coating. Lacing was ample and marked every sip. Nose was citrus, some sweetness of caramel and some roasted coffee. Taste was grapefruit, pine, some dark chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium, dry and creamy with a strong bitterness in the finish. Carbonation seemed perfect for the style. Some booziness but pleasant. This is a very nice black ipa that I will go back to again."
"O: I like this beer and would love to have it again, but their are a few other Black IPAs that I'd prefer over this beer."
"Overall, this may be my favorite American Black Ale to date. Really well done!"
"Slainte."
"Strong and flavorful with a nice boozy warmth. Very solid overall."
"overall, a great beer"
"O - A complex beer with a lot of interesting aromas and flavors. Well worth checking out."
"Wow, a pretty darn punchy Black IPA, I would say. Everything kind of comes back to that point, the roasted malt, the booze (which is very well integrated), and the big boy IPA hop craziness. Nice to see this kind of hedonism from the center of Mormonia."
"Pours a chalky black color with some red highlights, thin cap of greyish brown head, nice sticky lacing. Scent is near balanced between piney hops and roasted grain, with either being too powerful on the nose. Taste follows suit, again balanced between the hops and the roast. Bitter pine resin and heavy roasted grains mix and mingle to create a smooth and balanced flavor profile. Notes of citrus, cocoa, coffee and earth present in some form, light fruityness on back end. Dry, perfect carbonation, medium bodied. One of the better and more highly drinkable Black IPAs on the market."
"Overall: This is in my top 3 black IPA's I have had. Just a wonderful beer and highly recommended"
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pitch black, a very nice two inch sticky light tan head. Smell is pine, carmel, and some breadyness. Taste all that, with a slight roastyness. Plenty of carbonation and body. Wish I had it a little younger, it was bottled on 6/23/11. I am sure the hops were a little more pronounced two months ago, but a winner either way."
"This beer is amazing. Very little in the way of flaws. For hop heads this is a must. Probably one of the best black IPAs out there."
"A good, simple, well-balanced black IPA."
"A very good beer. The 9.2% is no doubt in there - tasted and felt. For hop lovers that are enjoying this black/cascadian IPA movement, this is a must try."
"Overall this is a kick ass beer. I like hops and I like dark beer and this blends them really nice. I really didn't know what to expect with this beer. I was hoping for good but was cautious of anyone seeming to use hemp as a selling point. I always feel brewers that use marijuana leaves on the packaging are hoping for a certain demographic to just by their beer based on that fact alone, feeling that making an actual quality beer is not important. This thankfully was not the case."
"This is just another example of a superbly well-crafted beer from Uinta. They are rising up the ranks on my list of favorite breweries."
"3.0 D: Despite my efforts, I've only found one black IPA that integrates the roast and the hops well. This isn't it, unfortunately. Flavors fighting each other is too dangerous for this to continue."
"O- One of the best I've had! Really savored this beer and I look forward to enjoying another soon."
"I also like the name of this beer, named for a star in Ursa Major, cool! And I also like that it was available in a 4-pack, because I rarely want to commit to a 6-pack, and sometimes a single just isn't enough to give the full impression the beer deserves. But now that I'm 3/4 the way through the 4-pack, I think I've got the idea. Well done!"
"Black with about an inch of off-white head which stuck around for about a quarter of the glass. Aroma is a ton of dark chocolate that seems slightly burnt. Some piney hops floating in the back but nothing standing out. Flavor is a milky dark chocolate at first but transitions quickly to a bitter chocolate backed by a earthy dry finish.The middle gave way to some sweeter, dark flavors with some smokey tobacco. I like how the aroma was misleading to the hop character."
"I'm ok with this one, but it is another example where I'm getting increasingly critical of how this style is made. This black imperial IPA is well made but over the top in hop application. I liked it but I also know I'd be reluctant to reach for #2 right away."
"Not bad, not great, but worth a try."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, a bit rough on the palate though, lingering and dry. I find black IPAs to be very hit or miss, but I was into this one. Definitely more on the aggressive side, which is typically how I like it."
"I love this beer. This my fourth Black IPA that I've tried. It takes the cake for sure."
"O: This beer was intense, but it is definitely the best black ipa i've had thus far."
"O- Again, my first Black IPA, certainly will not be the last. I like it a lot."
"This is my first review of a black IPA and although it was very good Sublimely Self-Righteous still holds the title, in my opinion."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this and will pick up some more next time i see it. This is on par with Sublimely Self-Righteous, perhaps better. A lot of the black IPAs I've tried seem to be little more than heavily hopped porters, but this one is definitely crafted a lot more deliberately."
"O: good beer, love the hops and the bitter. Both the sweetness and hops balance well together."
"Overall the different elements of this brew are holding onto each other for dear life, without ever letting go. I dig it, and I envisioned having this by a campfire. I hope to make that come true some day."
"Smooth and with a light bitterness, this may be Imperial and it may be Black. But an IPA it is not in my view. A decent brew nonetheless."
"Exagerated pour yielded a huge head of mocha colored foam that permanently laced the glass. Dark Mahogany with a slight red tint. Smells of bread and plum/prune. Coffee beans, yeast, slightly bitter at the end. Not too hoppy, and the alcohol is not overpowering. Interesting beer, reminds me more of an Russian Imperial Stout."
"Smooth beginning to the taste, then the black patent malts show up. After that is the alcohol warmth. The swallow is more of the burnt malts with a light hop in the background. Comes across as an Imperial Stout and less as an IIPA, although the body is thinner than an I.S."
"D-Overall i was exspecting more from this. After reading all the good reviews and having a nice Local black Ipa the day before this one was very drinkable but not much flavor really. Kinda bland and just ok. Will not search out again."
"Fitting name for this black, oily, sticky-smelling hemp seed-infused Black Ale—or, as they call it, an Imperial Black IPA. By far one of the most epic heads; the black color of this brew is inviting, too. Thick resin of citric hop and hemp in the nose, a bit piney with mild chicory and cocoa powder from the malt, and ripe fruit from the alcohol. Pungent hop smack tackles the palate hard, sticky resin with evergreen and mixed citric flavors. Malt sweetness and the blackness behind it break through just enough to keep the beer in balance. Alcohol is a bit amped up, but not hot. Hop and hemp flavors stay for a while during a semi-roasted bittersweet finish. Wow, a lot to take in. But in the end, this ale works, as all flavors meld well together."
"A good beer which brings an interesting flavor to the table. Maybe a bit less roast and the hops would shine through a bit nicer."
"Smooth, soft, subtle and tasty, with the 9.2% way in the back ground, creamy chocolate all through this one, drying herbal and again earthy hops in the rear to add the balance, bite and intrigue. Quality dark/black DIPA...well worth giving this one a try...."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Until now, I was not really sold on the ""black IPA"" trend we seem to be seeing in many American craft brewers. I am very happy with this beer. Overall definitely worth the try, especially if you like the style."
"O - Overall, this isnt a bad black IPA. The appearance is great, but thats pretty much it. Everything else is fairly standard. This needs more of that chocolate roasty malt quality that one expected with a black IPA."
"Poured into a stemmed glass a near jet black except for some ruby tinge when held in some light,a blooming light mocha colored head atop.Big roast in the nose along with some raw earthiness,the piney hops are there but a little subdued.The hops are much bigger on the palate,resiny and citrusy along with dark bread and coffee roast.A real good black ale but the alcohol sweetness does creep a little so its not something I could drink alot of."
"overall, its not bad, but not great. I'm not sure what the hemp seed did for this beer, but it didn't make this beer become overly unique. I'd drink it again, but there are many others I'd choose before this one."
"I've been waiting for a beer like this. Good interpretation of style. Made me want a Zoe...."
"Pours a dark orangey-brown but sits nearly black in the glass. Tan head takes a while to develop through the thick liquid but it puffs up to a solid three fingers before melting away to leave thick fine-bubbled lacing. First impression is that this smells like a hoppy barleywine. Lots of grapefruity hops and a toasty caramel maltiness. As it warms, more chocolate comes through, but this is a hoppy beast, even at three months old. Flavor has some smooth dark-but-not-super-dark chocolate and pineapple hops to go with a very bitter finish. Ashy tobacco notes recall cheap cigars and there's a big fusel presence. The label says the malts ""align"" with the hops but I find the flavor profile to be discordant. Palate is nice and silky while the beer is cool, but some warmth thins it out and shows more alcohol. Couldn't finish the 12 oz bottle."
"Overall fantastic showing!! I will definitely Pick up more of this. I hope this becomes a regular offering at my local packy. I could definitely put this in the regular rotation"
"Overall: This is a really complex beer, and a nice interpretation of the CDA style. The flavor goes on and on. I can only recommend this for the adventurous sort as the flavors are really intense. Those that can handle it will be rewarded. I also suggest trying it fresh."
"O/D - A good imperial black IPA that seems to be able to strongly deliver both the interesting malts of a black IPA as well as the potent hopping."
"Not sure what to make of this in terms of style, but it is a well crafted delicious ale in any case."
"Finally rating this! A new Black IIPA from Uinta brewed with Hemp seeds, named after the Utah State Star- no association with doobies I’m sure. Pours a pure black color with a medium beige head. The aroma is massive floral and pine hops, really dank. The flavor is a very hoppy brew; high bitterness, a massive peppery spiciness- could this be in part the hemp seed?- a rich roast and chocolate. Very damn good. Aggressive, certainly a huge beer. Lots to like here."
"Overall, it's just not pleasant.It's almost all charred bitterness that just sits in your mouth."
"Overall, I'm complacent with the four pack that I picked up. I can't say that I'm going to get many more bottles of this. The price is pretty damned great though, $1.80something per bottle. I like Black IPAs plenty, I'm just not fully into this one."
"O: Perhaps the best BDIPA/BIPA I have ever enjoyed. I bought a single bottle of it for like $2.19 making a 6er probably about 12. A good deal!"
"Hell with all of you over analyzing beer yuppies, this actions is the goods!!! It's like an imperial stout got together with a double ipa, did meth and went on a 10 hr. love making marathon. Balanced yet aggressive with equally distinct flavors. Amazing as it warms, sweet yet hoppy. Not overly muted taste. THE GOODS! ORALE!"
"O: I seem to like the Double Black IPA style than the regular Black IPAs. At this alcohol level the flavours get much more integrated; there's better structure and balance. Really it's comparable to very hoppy stouts. Uinta's done a good job here, check it out."
"P.S. I did grab a four pack... and I don't regret it all."
"Pours jet black with a almost no head retention. Light cream color on the little lacing that is there. Aroma is mild, but does have some hint of roasty malts and some hops. the flavor blends the roasty malts well with the dry hoppy bitterness. decent finish to the beer, some what residual bitterness. Not a bad beer, but not something i would seek out."
"Picked up a four pack of this one this afternoon (kind of on a black ale kick for some reason). Poured a nice, rich dark brown color, with some reddish highlights and a big light brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, earthy hops and light coffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of milk and dark chocolate, vanilla and earthy hops, with a lingering bitter finish."
"ETA: Tried it again. Less goldfish-tank-y but a really one-dimensional grain bill and, well, I don't know, at least when it tasted like a fish tank it had some personality..."
"O-Not that great. I like the concept, but it's not well executed."
"D/O: Note to self: You still need to review Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous. Every black IPA seems to tie back into that seminal anniversary beer from Stone in some way, and such is doubly true for those that stray over the 7% mark. This beer from Uinta, newly arrived in the Southern California market, is no exception, falling very close to the stylistic origin. Dubh does not attempt to pull any punches; it is in the face of the drinker from start to finish, taunting the palate with dark grain, American hops, and astringency, served in aggressive and palate-choking abundance. It is beautiful in its intensity, but hard to finish--wearing out the palate about half-way through the serving. The brewer is kind not to package this in a larger-format bottle. Twelve ounces is plenty of food for thought."
"the best part of this beer is the aftertaste. perhaps it's the marketing (brewed with hemp seed, and a name pronounced ""doobie""), but the aftertaste is distinctly similar to... well.... you get the idea."
"Good beer that I highly recommend if you are looking for a black IPA. Cheers mates."
