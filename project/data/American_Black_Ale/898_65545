4.04,6.9,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pours black, true to its name. No light gets through. There's a short lasting head that lasts a bit around the circumference and leaves some lacing. The aroma is rich and intriguing, with both a strong citrus hops aroma and big dark roast malts. The taste matches quite closely. The feel is a little thinner, leaning towards the Schwartz-bier side of the house. All in all, though, this is a great black IPA.","delta490","Mar 17, 2014"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, peach, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roast earthiness. Very nice complexity of bright hop and roasted malt flavors; with a great hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 15, 2014"

These were both surprisingly robust, zesty, hoppy, and well-balanced, helping to keep things fresh and drinkable. The nose especially held a bright zestiness that really reminded us of Lagunitas Sucks, in the sense that it was fruity, hoppy, and cleanly blended. The grain bill is obviously much darker, but this only contributed to the intrigue and depth of the taste. The feel was creamy and smooth, with soft finish. This brew exhibits the premiere blending of styles into the American Black Ale, and is our favorite to date from the brewery, and perhaps even a rival to the illustrious Sublimely Self-Righteous.","TheBrewo","Jun 13, 2013"

Citrus hop and roasted malt aromas upfront with a hint of pine hops in the back. On the thicker side of medium bodied with a rich smooth feel. Dark roasted malt flavors up front competing with pine hop bitterness. Dark flavors intensify thru the middle introducing a more burnt malt characteristic. Hop flavors allow a flash of citrus hop characteristic toward the end. Finishes with roasted malt and coffee flavors with pine and citrus hop bitterness beneath.

Not real strong but pleasant. The taste buds finds a near stout-like malt with more swampy, herbal hops. Itâs got an almost grassy touch in a medium bodied brew with fine carbonation. Plenty drinkable and highly enjoyable.","Durge","Jun 06, 2011"

I'm smelling more dark fruit than anything. Smallest bit of toasted barley in the nose. Maybe a very small hint of hops but I really have to try to find it. Already this reminds me more of a Porter than a Black IPA. The hops are a bit more noticeable in the taste. The malts win out though. I suppose it's a hard balance to find when crafting Black IPAs.

4.02,6.3,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This is a black IPA, or is it a hoppy porter? This one utilizes a little more dark malt than other black IPAs I've had, and hits you with the roasty character earlier in the taste. It pours a surprisely dark color with a tan frothy head that lasted a good amount of time. The aroma is heavy on american hops: citrus, mostly grapefruit, and hints of pine. The mouthfeel is medium to full with medium carbonation. The flavor is hops up front with bitter, roasty malt in the middle and in the finish. Its a nice marriage of hops and dark malt while the beer sits in your mouth but the after taste is all dark malt with bitter coffee coming through. This is a tough style to approach because it is so new so there is nothing to compare it to. I've had a few other examples which were IPAs first with hints of dark malt. This beer pumps up the dark malts and that sets it apart.","alexkeil","May 19, 2011"

It's a very fruity licorice flavor, but they seem to always be separate. There is only a slight malt overtone but it hit me as an overpowering glass of underwhelm.

The nose is hoppy and herbaceous enough to earn the title of ""IPA," pine and grapefruit to tangerine citrus shine through clearly, mixed flowers as well if to a lower degree, the roast is high-toned and focused, expresses itself as coffee bean and cocoa, nothing soft, as a result its briskness close to its finest attribute. Medium-bodied with good activity in the carbonation, the tingle helps to play up the hoppy bite and grass to lemon, white grapefruit citrus. Much higher roast here with big time coffee, dark chocolate and mocha flavors, nothing shy nor that sweet about it. So, it covers the hops and malts both, if blending them into a flatter whole. The peach, apple fruit shows a more tropical pineapple, nectarine stripe. Too aggressive to put down more than a couple in a row.","farrago","Mar 13, 2011"

Flavor isn't as hoppy as the nose would entail, definitely hop flavors citrus/herbal/hints of pine with dark black roasted malt character going on. Finishes with a touch of cocoa and creamed coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is sturdy throughout letting the flavors collide and blend effortlessly. Some of the best versions so far have been the most affordable versions, including this one and the Otter Creek BIPA...hop burps are welcome very nice presence and feel there's reasonable six packs down the street I better go grab one before they sell out of this stuff.","WVbeergeek","Feb 12, 2011"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice, jet black color with a tan head on top. Moderate floral and somewhat grapefruit aroma. Solid hop bitterness with a whisper of roasted grains. Lingering, somewhat mild burnt flavor leaves a nice edge to it. Good mouthfeel-I think it could be a tad fuller but it does not detract at all. Nice black ale all in. I like Clipper City and most of what they do-another hit in my book.","lackenhauser","Feb 11, 2011"

3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Ebony with a thick sand colored head of different sized bubbles that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Dank hops and charred malt in the aroma. Citrusy and piney hops with a touch of charcoal malt flavors. One of the better ""black IPA"" beers I've had. On the leaner side of medium bodied, a little more heft would certainly help. Another decent brew from an under-rated brewery.","biggred1","Feb 10, 2011"
3.06,-19,4,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability: A simple case of charry malts overshadowing the hops keeps this from being anything more than a run-of-the-mill BIPA.","ChainGangGuy","Feb 10, 2011"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time.","TheManiacalOne","Feb 08, 2011"
3.41,-9.8,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Black colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is grassy hops.Taste is hops,sugar cane and a touch of coffee.Alcohol is very well hidden.Goes down relatively smooth.Overall a decent beer that is probably worth trying at least trying once.I probably would buy again sometime down the road.","matty","Feb 07, 2011"
3.32,-12.2,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This one falls squarely into my ""meh"" category of Black IPA's. The hops aren't star, the roast malt is odd, and the aroma is just a ""What hops are these? Okay, I will remember never to use them in homebrew."" moment for me. Overall, this is an interesting beer, but even if my score seems decent, I won't be revisiting it anytime soon.","Keffa","Feb 06, 2011"
3.63,-4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, I liked the beer, but from the bottle label notation and other reviews I was expecting more. I love Loose Cannon and get it in these parts a lot, I just wish this one was more like that.","inlimbo77","Feb 06, 2011"
3.48,-7.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I suppose I had higher expectation since Loose Cannon is one of my favorite IPAs. Black Cannon is a solid Black IPA but not ahead of the pack. I was hoping for this to be more tropical and hop forward. I feel they focused more on the roasty characteristics. Bottom line is it's a great effort and enjoyable beer that's worth trying.","BB1313","Feb 05, 2011"
3.78,0,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark brown with red highlights. The head is thick and foamy to start then settles to a thin layer with lots of lace. The smell is of west coast hops and chocolate malt so like an imperial stout but without any bitter roasted character. The taste is of floral hop with a significant citrus note up front. Beyond the hops is just enough malt balance to keep this beer under control. It looks like a brown ale but is all IPA in taste. This beer is an almost unbalanced, IPA in disguise. The taste is clean with a finish of hop bitterness and a touch of malt sweetness but just a touch. Overall I'd say the drinkability is a bit less than good. This beer seems to be mostly chocolate malt with less of the caramel character of a classic IPA. The caramel character, in my opinion, makes a more drinkable beer as this seems to be lacking some of the sweetness required to balance the hops. This was my first Black IPA and I think it has made me interested in finding more of this style.","fank2788","Feb 04, 2011"
3.83,1.3,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"D: Not knowing what to expect with this style from this brewer i was pretty pleased. Very drinkable at a nice price point. I bought a case of this among other beer and my guests really enjoyed this as much as i did. At the 7.2% abv. its a beer you could drink for a while and not tire of.","ajaxivan","Feb 02, 2011"
4.22,11.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown, with a frothy cola colored head that retains well. The aroma is very green, with big and juicy citrus hops upfront, along with some dark chocolate and coffee notes, a bit of tobacco, some molasses, dark fruits, burnt bread and alcohol...a bit raw but very complex and inviting. The flavor starts off with citrusy and piney hops, along with some chocolate and coffee, molasses and burnt bread, dark fruits, chalk and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is very good for the style. Really tasty example of a black IPA, somewhat balanced and pretty complex...a real winner.","silver0rlead","Feb 01, 2011"
4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I'd been hearing about ""black ipas"" for awhile and wanted to see what the hype was about and I found a pack of this while at the liquor store the other night. I saw it described as loose cannon based so I thought since I liked that this would be worth a go. It is interesting. It pours black with a tan head. It smells very simillar to loose cannon. Taste begins the same as loose cannon with alot of hoppyness but then there is this interesting taste I can't quite put my hand on in the finish. This flavor doesn't really help the drinkability any and kind of hurts it a little bit. Not bad but it's not as good as loose cannon because of whatever that little flavor change is.","hdofu","Jan 30, 2011"
3.71,-1.9,4,3,4,3.5,4,"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good, I actually enjoyed it more then I expected I would. Typically I find that too much roasty flavors clash with the hops for me. Judging by the aroma I thought that this was going to fall into this category as well, but I was pretty happy with the way they integrated in the taste. It was definitely smoother then I anticipated and was a pretty good beer overall. A pretty nice twist on Loose Cannon for the winter months.","billab914","Jan 30, 2011"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The palate opens with quite a bit of leafy bitterness along with orange and floral hop flavor. Again, I don't get much of the malt character, there is no roast at all! There is some caramel, and maybe some chocolate, but I think this captures the style perfectly - it's a gimmick. Black like a stout or porter, hopped like an IPA, and like the best of them, not much malt character. One can argue that there's a touch of malt acridity, but really, with the hop profile here, there's a lot that can be hidden. Hoppier than I remember Loose Cannon being, this finishes dry and resiny with a bitter orange peel character. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this is solid stuff. Close to the base beer, but not quite there.","DefenCorps","Jan 29, 2011"
4.03,6.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: great style that opens up the eyes and the possibilities for food parings.","Frosty80","Jan 27, 2011"
2.96,-21.7,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Drinkability: I'm not too sure about this one. The hops dominate too much for my taste, there needs to be more roast to balance things out. I don't think I'd have this one again.","oline73","Jan 24, 2011"
2.83,-25.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"I think this beer kinda represents what's wrong with the CDA/Black IPA style. Too many strong porters with the roast played down and the hops played up. Still good, but not what I had in mind.","MrOH","Jan 24, 2011"
4.33,14.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Missed the various releases of this on tap/cask. Was somewhat excited about since I first heard about it. I'm a long time IPA fan and have been making a point to try as many black IPAs as I can find. None have blown me away yet. I drink it and think, ""that's cool they can do that with an IPA"". This is a very nice clean representation of the style, or what we're identifying as a style recently. It doesn't push the envelope too much from that perspective.","tbrown4","Jan 23, 2011"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Drinkability is very good...beware the 7.25 abv, it is not noticeable. This is a catch-all style, but if it contains beers like this...it is ok by me.","JayQue","Jan 23, 2011"
