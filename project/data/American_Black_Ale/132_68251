I am barely able to taste anything in the beer but this licorice taste. This is without a doubt due to my absolute hate for black licorice. Otherwise, I think this could be a good beer. It's a shame I wasn't able to enjoy the other flavours. Worth a try for sure if you think you'll enjoy that taste.","Devon_","Oct 18, 2014"

Actually, this is pretty much a very, very hoppy stout with more than enough bitterness to satisfy any craving. Something I was very happy to drink and would gladly drink again if the LCBO gets more next year. Recommended.","Jeffo","Oct 01, 2014"
3.37,-8.4,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall – A rather decent black IPA, but nothing all that exceptional overall.  A nice one to try, but really not worth the added price of the bomber or on tap in comparison to some of the other black IPA’s out there in 12 oz-ers","Darkmagus82","Beers"

Despite being quite bitter, the hops don't really seem to contribute many other flavours to this one, which is a little disappointing for a black IPA from the West coast. This would make a good introduction to the style, and there's no disputing that it's a well-made beer, but aspects of this one still leave me wanting. Worth a shot, but not a world-beater.","thehyperduck","Jul 17, 2014"

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The beer needs some stronger flavors to pair with in regards to food. I tried chicken schnitzel but it clashed a bit - I think the recommendation on the bottle of beef or lamb would have been right. The beer definitely needs to warm up a bit before drinking though. When first poured and still fairly cold, it's more bitter than anything else and the other flavors get lost. After warming up all of the flavors come out and that chlorine smell goes away. In the end, a good beer, but not sure I'd buy again. As for drinkability, I found that I drank it up fairly quickly, but I was sated after completing the whole bottle - I did not want another.","damndirtyape","Jun 21, 2013"

Fat chunky lacing spans the sides of my chalice. Aroma herbal earthy with a kick of resinous pine. The Chinooks really do complement the dark Black IPA quite well it's in line with the Troeg's Porter that packs loads of Chinook. Flavors are dark bitterness from the roasted barley and massive hop additions, I get bitter dark chcocolate and loads of pine sap and other assorted hop resins at 92 IBUs this is definitely an IPA...coats the palate with the bitterness aspects of the hop. Mouthfeel finishes each sip with a lingering bitterness medium bodied smooth natural carbonation, going strong keeps each sip worthy of the next.

The generic cocoa flavored malt profile underwhelmed me, odd considering the use of 5 different malts, and though a bit of redemption was found in the strong citrus hop finish, the general impression I have of this beer leaves me wanting. Simply, the malt is too sweet and a roast touch non-existent. The flavor, especially that sweet cocoa, reminds me a quite bit of Moylan's Orange and Black Congrats, except this finds balance in the bitter hop back end. For the price, I think I'll pass on giving this another go.","TheSixthRing","May 08, 2013"

Flavors are much more hop prevalent, and hop forward at that, with a resiny, bitter, very tangy hops profile followed directly by a strong roast and char characteristic with kills the bitterness, as well as highlights a subtle malt profile that is underlying on the palate.

Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, biscuit, herbal, floral, earth, coffee, pine, and slight citrus. Some decent aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, earth, pine, floral, grapefruit, toast, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, earth, pine, citrus, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bitterness with roasted malt flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly chalky mouthfeel that isn’t detrimental. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a really nice black IPA. This has a good balance between the roasted malt and hop flavors, which I tend to prefer in the style. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","May 15, 2012"

Rich caramel and earthy grains lie underneath a bouquet of pine like hops. Quite light and very complex. I was extremely open to this one. First sip is smooth, creamy malts that wash across the tongue. Great complexity here now as well.

Starts off with a light milk chocolate flavor that carries through to the end but takes a backseat to all of the other dominant malts and hops. Dark roasted malt flavors come next that transition to coffee into the middle. Then the hops take over. Pine hops with a hint of citrus with the pine slowly intensifying to the finish.

Lacing is left in a web pattern along the glass. The nose is burnt, roasty grains first, and some earthy and piney hops second. I'd really prefer to see the two switch places in terms of relative potency. The flavor maintains that same (unfortunte) balance, and the roasty malt character crosses the line a little bit into an acrid, burnt flavor. That's only accentuated by the mid palate bitterness. The earthy-herbal and pine hop notes do their best to soften everything that came before, but it's not enough. Body is about as mid-sized as I'd expect for a 7% beer, and carbonation is a little bit less than I'd expect, but still works well. To me, Black IPAs are a tough style to get right, the specialty grain to hops balance can be very sensitive, and ultimately Dad's Little Helper doesn't quite work out.","axeman9182","Jun 18, 2011"

I get dry, roasted, bready malts and some sweetness as well in a fuller than regular IPA body, but I'm not getting much hop action at all.

It has an outstanding bitter hop bite up front along with a solid malt base that boasts of pale, roasted, and patent malts. The mouthfeel is fine.

4.23,14.9,4.5,4,4.5,3,4.5,"Pours a deep burnt brown color with a half inch creamy tan head and good retention of lacing. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate and vanilla, and burnt bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is of burnt nuts, earthy, some coffee, malty, dry with some hops. Slightly smokiness is detected. Finishes with a very earthy coffee taste. For a black IPA, this is pretty tasty. I dig.","surprenant1138","May 24, 2011"

2.61,-29.1,3.5,2.5,2,4,3,"Medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is rather sippable and close to thirst-quenching. The carbonation helps to move the beer along, but also allows the flavors to persist just a bit too long.","output01x","May 23, 2011"

2.42,-34.2,4,2,2,4,2.5,"O: Had I been drinking this blind, there is no way I would have ever guessed it a American Black Ale, there was no evidence of hops in either the aroma or flavor profile. The smell and taste aren't bad...just not to style.","mdaschaf","May 22, 2011"
2.73,-25.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"D - This is pretty bad - it was a struggle to work through my pint even for the discounted price of $4. My liver has better things to do.","MasterSki","May 22, 2011"
3.58,-2.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"D - Very representative of Rogue with their standard dry malt profile and a balance that favors harshly bitter hops. It works well up until the finish, but the hop bitterness and dry, burnt toast malt character both amplify one another in the aftertaste and become unpleasant and acrid. The price on this bottle was more reasonable that what I have come to expect from Rogue in recent years, but it still reminds me why I no longer drink a lot of their beer; they have made some classics, but they have also made a lot of beer that tastes like burnt toast.","nickfl","May 22, 2011"
2.81,-23.6,2,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"O - In the bottle, this is a great ABA, but the cask was largely unbalanced and off. I wish it had melded more completely...","EgadBananas","May 21, 2011"

3.47,-5.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is medium in body and REALLY BITTER. Aside from this beer being probably 70-75 IBU, it is not an IBU. It is a really bitter brown porter from what I can tell. It is not a black ale in the sense that you can taste all those chinook hops. Overall it was fine but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that likes IPAs but if you want an interesting porter, knock yourself out.","drabmuh","May 17, 2011"
4.83,31.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Rogue always gets a fantastic malt taste in my opinion. Always getting that sweet thick and robust malt taste. You can definitely tell they put a lot of different types of malts in here. Since its so highly roasty and sweet the hop flavors just mix in with that sweetness and try to push through the malts with a citrus graepfruity taste. Like I said though it ultimately ends with a pine/coffee roasted taste. Definitely a ridiculously top notch beer. This is my 2nd favorite Black IPA of all time right behind Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale.This definitely comes well recommended.","thebrood1987","May 17, 2011"

3.36,-8.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a good beer that I will try again but I won't go out of my way to have it. I feel that Back In Black and Alpine Black IPA are better choices.","buyBinboaVodka","May 16, 2011"
4.08,10.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"On tap last week at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass near pitch black with a thin light tannish colored head atop.Roast and dark stone fruit aromas slightly overtop of piney hops,the hops were not quite as assertive as I thought they would be coming from Rogue.Piney hops are more assertive on the palate really providing a good punch,the dark malt and slight roastiness provides good balance.A solid ABA,good hops and a good dark malt profile.","oberon","May 13, 2011"
4.03,9.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O - This is a pretty good take on the style; more hoppy, less malty, and a bit lighter overall than the (fledgling) style norm.","ktrillionaire","May 11, 2011"
3.18,-13.6,4,3.5,3,3,3,"O: Not a winner. It looks good, smells OK, but goes downhill from there. Could use more balance: some sweet malt to offset that harsh roasted bitterness.","Kendo","May 10, 2011"
3.81,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Dad’s Little Helper tastes almost like a black English IPA — nearly roasty enough to be considered a porter, but with the subdued and earthy hops that exemplify British styles.","Phelps","May 09, 2011"
3.98,8.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"With the (haltingly welcome) preponderance of Black IPAs hitting the market as of late, it's nice to see this big West Coast player jumping into the fray. And jump do they ever - the formula ain't complicated and Rogue pretty much nails it. Roasted and hoppy. Get used to it, I guess, at least for the time being.","biboergosum","May 08, 2011"
3.71,0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall. It's probably not a real close 'black ipa' more of a very hoppy stout. But being that this style is still new and argued over it's still a very good brew.","Elimination","May 07, 2011"
3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Very tasty take on the style. Opaque body with significant lace, small white head. Complex inviting aromas of hops and some roast. Above average mouthfeel.

3.68,0,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"I am guessing but this alcohol here couldn’t be very high. As a result this beer doesn’t really seem to be a substituted for something like Avery’s 17th or Stone Sublimely Self Righteous. It also seems to be needing that extra push to have a thicker body and perhaps a bit more malt flavor to work here. A decent beer, but not one I’d seek out again.","bobhits","Beers"
3.78,2.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a very nice beer, but the dominace of roast and sharp piney bitterness creates some astringency and sharpness that prevents the beer from the pleasant dryness that other examples of the style exhibit. It's just a hair off of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale.","BEERchitect","0"
