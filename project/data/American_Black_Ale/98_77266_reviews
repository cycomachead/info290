"Very tasty. Tastes like a lighter beer even in the IPA Adventure pack."

"Mouthfeel medium bodied slick mouthfeel, bitter dry finish, yet maintains that smooth crisp drinkability found in most of the Harpoon offerings. Overall nothing incredibly mind blowing but definitely a well made version of an often times poor style from most of the major brewers versions I've tried in the last year."

"O) A good ""cascading pale ale"". I'd definitely have another one."

"The taste is also malty, slightly sweet and more more modestly bitter with a lingering finish. I think this aged well considering it was probably not meant to be aged."
""
"Excellent black IPA, one of the first i have ever tried. The taste is slightly spicy with smokey undertones and a hint of sweetness. Has a strong aftertaste with excellent hoppiness. The balance between spicy, sweet, and smokey adds a nice quality and makes this a unique beer experience. Surprisingly smooth with a nice drinkable taste. Would totally drink again."
"Overall a really good black IPA. When I poured it into my mug I took a few minutes to just admire the look and smell of this. Poured a dark brown color with a nice, frothy, tan/khaki color head. The smell is several different aromas. Sorta citrusy, sorta earthy. The taste relatively matched that. It was a little heavy, but went down smooth nonetheless. Very enjoyable. I recommend trying it, especially if you like black IPAs. I would pay for this again, and probably will."
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. After being disappointed by other black IPAs, I almost gave up on the style. Seems like not many brewers can nail the balance just right and Harpoon did that, pushing it out of the category of a porter without blasting you with hops. Great beer, highly recommended."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A nice black ipa that I would drink again and im not the biggest fan of this style. Well done, worth trying. Thanks again Matt."

"I would enjoy this in the summer or winter."
"This is a really nice black IPA. It has an amazingly forward hop character that should please any hop head. It also has a nice, well rounded malt character that balances nicely. It's also a very easy to drink beer that refreshes. It's definitely worth a try."
""
" This hop taste is familiar but not quite sharp with some citrus and tropcical fruit with mostly pine taste in the first sips with some caramel in the malt coming through after the swallow and light tannic roasted almost char taste in the malt giving an acrid flavor in the finish with subtle alcohol influence. Overall a not bad example, a decent ale and has enough hop flavor to accept the bitter roasted taste, pretty drinkable in general."
""
""
"Less bitter than most IPAs, but that may be from the stronger roasted malts. Full bodied with an above average carbonation level. Overall, less IPA and more deeply roasted Porter."
""
""
""

"O- I love Black IPA's. This one is a nice example with bitterness coming from both the roasted malts as well as the hops. The body seems a bit light and may not be as balanced as others I've tried, but a nice drinking BIPA none the less."
""
""
""
""

"Bitter roasted coffee up front. Smoother dark chocolate and roasted barley follow through. Hints of dark fruitiness. A little smoke and peat as well. Hop bitterness comes out in the latter half of the palate. Nice blend of leafy, piny, and citrus. Earthy tobacco shows up in the finish, along with some cocoa. Dries out a little. Medium-full body with a slightly syrupy feel. Nicely done!"
""
"O- very drinkable for 7.0% ABV, I could have a few more. In fact I will."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great black IPA, should try this one. The strong hop presence is what makes it stand out above other overly sweet black IPAs."
"O: A nice black IPA without too much roast character but enough of a dark malt presence to make it into a good ABA. After the nose, this definitely leans more towards the IPA side which is a good thing. Solid brew, glad they brought it back"
"I am not a lover of this brewery, mainly because of too many disappointments vs. successes. So, coming from a real skeptic -- they nailed this one. Hops are perfectly balanced with the malt, and even a hop-head would feel satisfied. Malt isn't overdone with raw bitterness. Instead, the stuff you want in this style shines. Good job fellas."

"O - Nice roast character and an interesting bitterness. The profile isn't common, but not necessarily complex."
""
""
"Black body with some reddish brown hues. Beige head, good lace and a film of retention. Nose has tropical fruits, orange, a bit soapy and some darker malt notes. Taste is really roasty, dark malts, burnt bread, bitter hopping in the form of pine and some mild citrus. Roast dominates. Medium feel, medium high carbonation. A really roasty American Black Ale, hops are lost in the mix."
""
""
"A head of mold spore look on a black body. Subdued aromas, both the roast and the hop. Lacey. Big roast flavour (some ash sediment) with a citrus hop finish, odd but interesting that they used a German hop.Thanks for bringing John. Average for the style."
""
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 5/15/2012. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange, pine, herbal, citrus rind, roasted malt, biscuit, toast, and earthy spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, orange, herbal, floral, grass, dark roasted malt, char, citrus rind, chocolate, and earthy spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, toast, grass, roasted malt, chocolate, char, and earthy spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted malt with hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a really nice and quite robust Black IPA. Nice balance of citrus and piny hop flavors; with a very nice and prominent roasted malt backbone. Really well done, and very enjoyable."

"Pretty tame nose for a CDA, chocolate roast with earthy undertones. A punch of earthy hop flavor somewhat ups the 'oomph' factor, but the limp finish and bland malt profile fall flat. On the positive side, there's a hefty dose of bitterness. A blast of bitterness without any other flavors really being fleshed out any other fully developed flavors doesn't have much appeal, though. I love the CDA style, but this particular example misses the mark."

"D - It isn't bad. It isn't terribly good though."

"No Harpoon product I've had belonged in a higher class than the average beer drinker's table, but Black IPA is a very strong example of its style and certainly warrants as much respect as many of those higher rated than it. I would have been very upset if this bomber were only 12 ounces and even after 22 ounces I would have enjoyed a little more."
"O: Easily drinkable. Good but not great black IPA. Smells and tastes really seem to change from sip to sip with some complex and some very plain - not sure why - would have rated higher if more consistent"
""
""
""
"Taste-Medium roast coffee, chocolate, some citrussy hops thrash about. Nothing super-complex here, but a pretty tasty offering that would pair well with some grilled fajitas or a thick cheesburger."
""

"Harpoon Black IPA is a very dim reddish brown, almost black beer with a lumpy beige foam on top. The retention and lacing are outstanding. It has a bold, fresh aroma of pine and grapefruit with a hint of sweetness. It has a very smooth medium body with a slightly astringent finish. It's well balanced with nice grapefruit peel and pine resin bitterness along with roasted astringency and smooth, mellow, caramelly malt. It's tasty and very easy to drink."
"Harpoon...please brew this one again!"
"Overall: I'm not too pleased with this one. It's fairly one-note and weak in the malt and hop department, making for a beer that's actually less than the some of its part."
""

"Poured into an imperial pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown color a nice tight one finger beige colored head atop that lasted in a pillow state for quite awhile.Piney hops stood nicely over top of roast and unsweetened chocolate malt notes,the flavors don't really pack any op punch honestly to me it's like a earthy porter with its light bitter chocolate and raw earthy finish,it lacks really any hop character.The beer started out promising but the lack of hop depth on the palate really brought the score down for me,it's not true to style flavor wise."
""
"A beer worth trying but not my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is a pleasant ale and worth drinking. But it is no ""knock your socks off"" representative of a new style."
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, best before 5/15/12. This pours a light black color with a little red hues around the edges, along with a nice tan colored head which quickly dissipates. The smells are full of pine hops along with dark roasted malts. The feel is medium and full of bitter hop resin. The taste is pretty good, it follows the more stout ipa hybrid of this style, the hop presence is there full of that bitterness along with a nice roasted malt bitterness for extra goodness. Love it."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm happy to have grabbed a bottle of this during my visit. A very drinkable, uniquely hopped take on the style."
"O- I've only had a few black IPAs and this probably ranks around the middle of them. It wasn't overly flavorful, but had a typical Black IPA taste- sort of a not overly hoppy IPA with the sweet characteristic taste similar to other darker beers such as stouts. Definitely could have used a little bit more flavor (preferred if it was a little bit sweeter + maybe a little bit more hops). Not a bad beer (goes down easy), but definitely room for improvement. Would drink again, but probably wouldn't spend the money to buy a bottle."
""
"The mouth is creamy as well, but with a crisp carbonation bite at each sip. Wonderful citrus in this one. Bitterness is moderate, but man does it keep me sipping. Mild roasted characteristics, but this is mostly bitter and citrusy-sweet. The ""black"" in this one, is relegated mainly to the color, rather than the flavor profile. Still, this is one I would have time and again. Good beer."
""
""
"O: A nice pleasant brew, I enjoyed this brew right next to the fire at the stirling hotel in NJ."
""
"Pours a dark brown bordering black color, off white, khaki colored head and solid lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, citrusy, floral hops and pine. In the flavor, pine, grapefruit, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and a small anise note. Mild alcohol flavor, strong bitterness. Medium bodied feel with a low carbonation, loose and creamy. Overall, a pretty decent brew, went down smooth and quickly, not too shabby."
"Overall- This is a fine black ipa. It lacks some of the roasted notes that make an excellent black ipa. In that way, it falls into the category of black ipa’s that are black because of their color and not as much based on flavor. If you gave me this on a blind taste test, I would not necessary think it was a black ipa. That said, I would still consider it to be a perfectly acceptable ipa. In our little mini-tour of black ipa’s over the last 3 weeks, I would consider this one a solid second, which is a fine place to be when one of the other beers is Otter Creek’s black ipa."
""
"Had this as the 100 Barrel Series #40 in a large format bottle. An underrated black ale. Love the Harpoon Barrel Series labels. Pours opaque black with small lightly tan head. Aroma of both strong bitter pine and some light earthy roasted coffee. Flavor follows complexity in the aroma with hints of roasty malts between the pine hop bite throughout. Full bodied brew with medium carbonation. Relatively easy drinking. Pretty solid."
"Overall quite enjoyable. Could have this again no problem."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer but there are better options in the style."
"Overall: This one is ok to good, but definitely finished behind Uinta in my Black Ale night. I would pick this up again as it is enjoyable, but there are others in the style I would choose first."
"O - Just on ok beer. Slightly above average, gotta give it that. Nothing too special though. Worth the try but I doubt I would drop 8 dollars on the bomber again."
"Dark brown with clear, ruby highlights and a fluffy light brown cap. Fair head retention with sticky lacing. Powdery citrus, caramel, grassy hops and roast in the aroma. Bitterness was dominated by sweet malts up front (chocolate, toffee, and roast) and never really took charge once they started to fade towards the finish. Citrus and grassy hops mid-palate with a bit of alcohol following. Creamy carbonation with medium plus body, nice texture, slight warmth. Overall, I liked it, but didn't think it was a great example of the style. Hop bitterness was overshadowed by sweetness, which made it more balanced but neutered the beer. It kind of made me think of a slightly hopped up American Brown Ale rather than an IPA of any stripe."
"Not a bad beer, two things though: the heavy ash taste and lack of hop flavor, could use work there."
"O: Another good black IPA, nothing earth shattering, but well-worth the money. Might buy again."
""
""
""
"D: Overall a really nice beer, nice mix of flavors, and it was quite drinkable."
""
"Pours a three finger tan head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Grapefruit and grass nose, flavor is grapefruit, some malt. You notice the 67 IBUs at the finish. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Concord Coop Concord, NH."
""
"Overall, pretty average/slightly above average offering from Harpoon Brewery."
"Overall a nice black IPA, would like a little more dark malt up front, the strong bitterness at the end dominates."
""
"Flavor is all IPA, and only in the very end is there any hint of roasted malt. I do feel like the beer might be excessively dry, given the relatively high IBUs and ABVs. This beer really showcases just two things: loads of hops and a contrasting black body. But other than that it's just an average, if high alcohol, CDA."
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is dark brown-black in color with a hefty tan head and big bubbled lacing. The aroma brings herbal swamp hops and skunky wheat. Not bad. The flavor brings much the same with weak herbal hops over somewhat watery malt. Medium-light bodied with a somewhat aqueous feel, medium carbonation. Good but underwhelming. Not the best of the 100 barrel series but definitely a good value."
""
""
""
"Taste is dark malts to start, moderate citrus in the middle, and comes on pine bitterness galore through to the close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is okay as well. Seems somewhat scattered, like a Black IPA with ADD, almost no aroma, then hops everywhere in my mouth? Wish it was a bit more consistent."
"Creamy and full mouthfeel, slight suggestion of tannins. Overall a tasty and enjoyable beer."
""
""
"O: OK. I prefer a bit more body and some chocolate malt character in my ABAs, but if you go into this thinking you're going to be drinking a hoppy porter, you would likely be less disappointed than I was."
""
"$6.99 for the bomber makes this a decent value."
"O: This is not one of the better examples of an ABA. It does not have nearly the power or complexity of other beers of the style."
"It's pretty much an acceptable IPA with a touch of the black. This is often what black IPA's turn out to be for me."
""
""
""
"Not a favorite for the style or Harpoon. Despite the aforementioned flaws it does come together fairly nicely."
""
"A decent example that I feel is lacking in hoppiness. It's still balanced enough to where you can enjoy it."
""
"Overall: A tasty beer, but a little modest for the category. Malt seems a bit weak, the hops don't punch, the roasted malt seems just for color. Almost sessionable where I expected a bit more of a celebration beer. Still, a pleasant flavorful beer that I'll enjoy."
"As I make my way through the bottle, there is a metallic astringency that becomes fairly unpleasant. It's not awful, but after a while it's all I can focus on. A disappointing end to a beer I'd been looking forward to trying."
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good stuff. Personally, I'd like to see it ramped up a bit (a la hoppy shoes 1.5) and be rolled in to the Leviathan series. As it stands it's good but nothing special."
""
"22oz bottle with a Best By Date of 5/15/12. Pours a black color with ruby hues. Small amount of head with some lacing. Aroma is of sweet citrus. Maybe some caramel and a bit of chocolate. Flavor is of grains, some citrus and somewhat earthy. Some floral flavor towards the end. Kind of a metallic aftertaste. Light mouthfeel. This isn't all that great. Pretty light and watery for the style and there is an odd metallic floral aftertaste. Overall, ""meh""."
"A lot of hop in this bad boy with a malt profile simply to carry the hops. Tasty but could use a semblance of malt flavor. Still very nice"
""
""
""
"Instead of picking up the aromas of chocolate and coffee from most stouts, this Black IPA gave you an complete overload of HOPS... but not overdone. Instead it was really balanced. The fullness of the black beer combined with the hops and malt made this one very good interesting beer."
"Pour produces an almost opaque colored body, with a small amount of tan head on top. Aroma contains notes of floral hops with a trailing roastyness of grain. Flavor contains a center of flowery and citrisy hop bitterness, caramel malt mingles well with the hop flavoring. Tobacco mixes in. Finish provides increased spice on the palate, increased carbonation bite, and black patent malt roast that lingers into the aftertaste. Aftertaste also leaves plenty an abundance of spicey hop flavor on the palate. Overall, quite a solid brew from Harpoon's 100 barrel series."
"Very delicious. Drink this one now."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is black, with ruby highlights when held up to light. A thick, frothy, foamy, one inch head that is off-white and big bubbled. The head clings all over the glass as you move the beer around a bit. Aromas are rich cedar and pine, with a slight roasting and a decent resiny presence. The beer's flavors are dry, with a hoppy blast of pine tree and earthy notes, as well as a steady tang of citrus throughout. The beer has a roasting character throughout it, and that transitions directly into the aftertaste, along with an earthy and grainy profile. The finish is quick, with only a slight linger to it. A bit astringent at the end from the hops, cleaning the palate. Good beer."
"The appearance is a nice opaque black, the nose is a dominant pine and the taste follows up on that with some slight cocoa and coffe. Very easy drinking!"
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slick black, with a fluffy 3 inch cream colored head, with lots of lace, and nice retention. Smell is piny hops, citrus, hints of chocolate, and some bread. Taste is all of that with citrus and chocolate the dominant flavors, with a burst of pine in the finish. Body is medium, very easy drinking, plenty of life, and really lush for the style. I was really excited to find this today and be the first to review. A very nice version of a style I love."
