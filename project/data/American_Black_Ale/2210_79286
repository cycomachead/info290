A darker style IPA, with some subtle Rye ""pepperiness""...but candidly, in a blind taste test, I think most would just call it a near perfect IPA.  I love the look in the glass, and even better in my mouth!  These Brewers have established themselves as a personal favorite of mine, and I can't wait to try all their beers.  Check the dates and get them as fresh as possible.  Credit to the Brewers for making the dating so clear and straightforward...it makes a difference, IMO.","Jmc181","Saturday at 04:44 PM"

These black IPA's aren't one of my favorite styles, because I feel like so many breweries try to lean to one side; this one is a perfect blend of hops/pine/fruit and malt/chocolate.","do_ob","Friday at 04:13 PM"

3.97,-6.8,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Overall: This is the second FW beer iv had, the first being Union Jack, both being around 8 months since bottling. Of course the hops in union Jack had already fallen off and ended up with a malty mess, but i thought Wookey would hold up a little better. I suppose the hops in here fell off too and was left with a semi hoppy black ipa. As it warms i get little hints of what i imagine it is like fresh. I like how the flavors linger on the pallet for a while. As is, i enjoyed Lagunitas NightTime much more than this. Ill seek out a not so hoppy FW beer next time since i can't get their beers fresh.","Bone53","Mar 19, 2015"

Taste was surprisingly smooth considering the 8.3 ABV.  I'm not a big fan of smokiness but felt they hit it just right.  Not too bitter of a bite so I came back for more quickly and polished the bomber off in 20-25 mins.  Purchased at Costco for $5.99 and well worth it.","RossiDaMan","Mar 15, 2015"

Taste is ok, but I expected a little more for all the hype and high scores that I see for this beer. Flavors of roasted caramel and coffee, some malt sweetnessw and some hops come through. For the most part, the beer is pretty well balanced, but the hops add an odd bitterness that doesn't balance well with the rest of the brew. A little off balanced and also not as bold as I was anticipating, slightly weak and some of the complexity that should be there is gone.......","hophugger","Dec 02, 2014"

4.5,5.6,,,,,,"22 into a simple pint. Black with coppery tones and a tan head. Aroma gives the spiciness with a little hop and malt for backing. The flavor is a bigger version of the aroma. The spiciness of the rye gets in first, followed by some of the hop profiles that are less easy for me to peg down (can't claim citrus or pine as dominant, definitely not floral in my bottle) - perhaps rye interference? Maltiness in the back gives it a balance for these medium-to-big flavors. Alcohol at the finish is subdued, which I did not expect in an 8. A solid Black IPA effort, well balanced for the genre.","MisterGone","Nov 26, 2014"

This is very smooth, a nice citrusy bitterness up front, a little roasted character on the back end, but surprisingly very drinkable. I think I need to try more black ales IPAs to get a better understanding of where this fits in the style, definitely worth drinking again and worth trying.","Catracho5","Nov 23, 2014"

I have drank a few but kind of backed away while summer was here. Now that we are in a transitional season and I want more stouts this is a good beer to bring me up to speed.

4.2,-1.4,,,,,,"Notes of grapefruit, mango, papaya, resin, and fresh cut grass are countered by roasty, chocolatey malt in the aroma. Fruity hops dominate. Flavor is citrusy initially, with grassy and earthy undertones, becoming roasty mid palate, which carries into a dark chocolate and coffee grounds bitterness in the finish. Again, flavoring hops, especially grapefruit, dominate, but the roast bitterness adds an interesting contrast. Excellent beer, especially for 6 bucks a bomber. Notes of fresh cut grass and pine serve in the aftertaste for even more hop character.","barczar","Nov 07, 2014"

A big creamy tan head hangs on a long time, eventually settling down in to a nice disk, leaving tight soapy lacing. The aroma is lighter, with light roasted malt and pine hops. The taste, though, kicks it into a higher gear with roasted malt, burnt sugar, and floral and fruit hops adding to the pine. The body is nice and smooth, with just a little bite from the hops on the finish. A great black ale.","delta490","Sep 26, 2014"

This is probably the most drinkable black ipa I've had and one ill trade for again when its time. It actually saddens me I can't have this at my fingertips whenever I want it. The FW quality is there, the west coast style as well, but the roasted rich malt and rye characters throw you for a one of a kind experience. It's as perfect as the style can get.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 21, 2014"

Its beautiful appearance, rocky head of foam, full bodied complex taste, and just about everything else point to a beer made for victory in a critics taste competition.

Sneaks up on you with a smell of wood and cigar to a light citrus..floral maybe..aroma. Hard to detect, subtle but really unique smell. Taste follows up with the aroma..definitely tastes smoky and stout-like when it first hits the lips, but as it moves through the palate I get flavors of maple, pine, mild citrus and honestly..cough syrup. Not in a bad way, just the easiest way to describe this fruity flavor I get that's hard to detect. Mouthfeel is thick, love the unfiltered style for an IPA. Definitely digging this style more and more with every beer I try..once again fsw fails to disappoint. Ps..paired this with locally smoked bratwurst..a win there too.","fgmiele","May 12, 2014"

A thin layer of khaki colored foam covers the top, perhaps not quite a quarter of an inch. Aroma of rye and pine like hops is very prevalent and beckons for a sip. The flavor is initially very bitter from the pine like Northwest hops, but then quickly segues into the spicy, earthy rye flavor.

4.53,6.3,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a foamy head head that is a milk chocolate brown that leaves quite a bit of lacing. The beer itself appears to be a jet black but under further inspection is actually a very dark brown. The beer smell is a mix between the hops, rye, and malt. The rye is the strongest of the three and is bolstered by the hops. The malts give a hint of roastness to the smell but is very small. The beer taste is pretty good with a nice balance between the rye spice, malt, and hops. The hops have a bitter citrus taste while the malts provide a nice roasted flavor to the mix. After the beer warms up a bit, the beer also has a slight caramel flavor. The rye spice mixes very well and its funk compliments the hops but does not overcome it. The mouthfeel is interesting. The beer is medium-bodied and thicker than an average IPA. The feel is slightly creamy. Biting carbonation. Overall, this is a great Rye IPA and worth getting. I can certainly see why it's high on most people's list.","HattedClassic","Jan 03, 2014"

The burnt malt and hop characteristics blend perfectly and the result is a stunningly balanced brew. This is by far the best Black American Ale / Black IPA i've had to date. Another winner from Firestone Walker!","CA_brewster","Jan 02, 2014"

Appearance: Black in color with fair lacing against the glass and a thin foam rim. Taste: Very strong bitter hops upfront with an extremely pleasing dark chocolate/fudge overtone the the middle of the mouth. The rye is definitely noticeable and it seems to be playing off the chocolate notes extremely well. There's some definite tropical fruit in here; possibly some mango/pineapple notes, not really getting grapefruit notes as you do in typical IPA's. Some more stout characteristics are here throughout the palate. Notes of deep, rich chocolate, dry coffee, super dry finish with roasted caramel and biscuit. Overall, this is really just fantastic.

Also, the pronounced hop really makes this a great hybrid of IPA and a Black Ale. Moderate aftertaste of bitter hop and burnt grains. Thick body but this may be more notable due to the very low level of carbonation. Still, the whole package works very well.","smcolw","Oct 12, 2013"

Overall, my expectations were fulfilled - this beer did satisfy me on multiple levels. I love big, complex beers and I like the delay effect the taste had on me. To get a perfect score I would probably have liked the roast turned up a hair. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who appreciates extremely hoppy beer with a twist.","Neorebel","Sep 13, 2013"

The nose is very malty, with notes of chocolate, licorice, toffee, coffee, and some vanilla. The taste is also very very nice, malty, with a nice little hop note, lots dark stuff.

Grapefruit. Earthy, spicy and a touch of caramel malt. Taste is dark roasted malt. Gentle grapefruit that was a little sourish with some hop bitter. It's smooth and a little heavy not really crisp or biting from the rye. In fact the rye is mellow and not at all bold and has a mellow spice to it. Light resin, a little oily. Moderate carbonation and finishes dry and a bit muddled. Lingering bitter in the after taste with a touch of that grapefruit.

Looks awesome, and as a member of one of my favorite styles, I'm excited. Smell is piney hops, some rye, and slight chocolate/coffee from the darker malts. Taste is just awesome...smooth chocolatey malts with a perfect amount of piney hop bitterness and rye spiciness. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth...this is a nearly perfect beer.

Overall this is a great Imperial black rye the hop flavor is consistent with other FW beers -lots of flavor without overdoing the bitterness -I love that -a true pleasure to drink.","Slatetank","Jul 18, 2013"

I think I'm enjoying the rye, hop blend of this style. While I've only had two of this style with Terrapin Rye PA the other, I feel there is a trade off. Maybe the rye downplays certain aspect like smell and downplays the hoppiness but it does blend well overall. It's fairly smooth and drinkable. Because the hop presence is a tad lower I think the tongue burn out is less which makes this a very easy beer to drink. I enjoy this, but wish I could get it in a six pack rather than a bomber. I would get this again however.","sjones5045","Jul 18, 2013"

The taste was a roast chocolatety goodness that I didnt want to stop. There was enough hops to smooth the astringent coffee undertones.

The caramel melds so well with the pine and orange peel, and its complexity yet ability to shift flavors over the course of time makes it easy to drink.

Nothing out of the ordinary or complex with the aroma, just right on target. Caramel and bitter chocolates to the tongue and this one goes down smooth as hell. An herbal hop envelope helps provide a pleasant and non-threatening counterpoint to the sweetness. Some rye graniness and plum is noticed later. Medium-bodied at the most and the alcohol provides warmth but no harshness. Fabulous is end of the story.","stephens101","May 20, 2013"

There is good retention to the head, however and it leaves rings on the glass that are almost as thick as those left by a nitro-tapped beer. There are certainly hops present in the nose, but there are also roasty notes that make for a complex olfactory experience. The flavor includes roasted malts combined with some decent hoppiness and accentuated well with a touch of smoke (a pleasant surprise). The finish is not super hoppy, but the bitterness is enough to round out an exceptional drinking experience.","57md","Feb 26, 2013"

4.41,3.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Picked up a bomber of this bad boy on recent trip to CA. Bottled on 1/25/13. Poured into a pint glass I can smell the hops a mile away...wow what an aromatic brew! Very heady, bubbly and dense with a light tan color. The liquid is black with a garnet hue and clear when held up to light. The whiffs of aromatic citra and amarillo hops. That characteristic rye spice is also quite pronounced but takes a back seat to the juicy citrus (apricot) aroma. Taste is indeed hoppy but there is a big malt bill here. Nice roasted notes with a rye spicy zing. Plenty of carbonation and medium bodied the high alcohol content is definitely not obtrusive and hidden well beneath the ample hops and malt. Their is a slight bitter bite in the aftertaste but it cleans up very nicely. While enjoying the first pint there is some beautiful lacing present and a chunk of head remains. This is a good looking, unbelievably aromatic, well done brew. I've only had a few of the offerings from FW but am really impressed! Superb. The best black IPA I've tasted.","deebo","Feb 25, 2013"

Flavor is citric up front with a malty finish that screams ’rye.’ Not very roasty. It’s a nice idea -- many black IPAs have a hollow roastiness that doesn’t mesh with the hops, but Wookey Jack’s main malt note in the flavor is rye, a tried and true hop complement. Well done.","illidurit","Feb 20, 2013"

Smell is pine, hints of chocolate, some coffee notes, some citrus, and some cut grass. Taste is very similar lots citrus and chocolate, blended well. Body is medium, plenty of life, not dry, and easy drinking. This is really solid, especially when the hops are fresh and the center of attention.

The nose painted the picture of something curiously sweet and fruity, which was nicely intriguing. The flavoring, however, was a departure from this, with big hoppy bitterness, and drying pucker by the end of the sip. This made for a nice contrast, and kept you guessing throughout. This bitterness might get to some who may not be expecting such a bite on such a sweet-seeming beer, but this guy remains drinkable, and is a tasty treat.","TheBrewo","Jan 16, 2013"

Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, pine, orange rind, toast, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, chocolate, floral, and piney spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, roasted malt, dark chocolate, spicy rye, toast, orange rind, light char, floral, herbal, and piney spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus rind, pine, roasted malt, toast, dark chocolate, rye, light char, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity and balance of flavors; with a very nice roasted/hop flavor balance; nice bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.

4.59,7.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Even a slow, measured pour yields half a glass full of deep tan foam, decent density with an island of bigger bubbles remaining at the pour point, retention is very high, to the point it annoys as you can’t get at the liquid to sip it, the lacing is haphazard but what’s there is thick splotches. Dark, opaque brown hued liquid, slice of zinc orange at the glass bottom, few if any bubbles visible inside the glass. The rye is indeed present in the nose, however, on the whole it is sweet in a clean manner, pine, grapefruit, caramel, chocolate, scone crumbs wrapped around a core of apricot, peach, pineapple scents, fresh hops give it penetrating punch without unnecessary bite, admirable for its sinewy linger which never seems forced. Medium-bodied, the carbonation creates a tight weave but its active and keeps things bubbling along. Some rye, pumpernickel notes yet not very bready, once more relies on grapefruit, orange citrus, pine and flowers for most of its initial effect. Chocolate, molasses, anise only bring mild softness, instead it wants to stay erect as the leafy herbaceousness dries out the mid-palate. The roast mostly present as aftertaste. That pineapple, nectarine, apricot to papaya fruit drier here and thus further into the background. Taste-wise not boozy but there is a certain headiness to it. It crackles with the kind of energy and verve which makes you want to gulp as much as sip.","farrago","Oct 24, 2012"

Malt is most interesting coming from the rye, leaving a bitter after taste much different from that of the initial taste of the beer, which is one of the few flaws I find with it.

The nose comprises roasted malts, pine resin, grapefruit rind, and a kiss of molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit really coming in stronger and being joined by what seems to be some lime zest. The result, though, comes across as clashing, with the roasty and hoppy factions unwilling to give ground or work together. It's not an altogether awful clash, but it's certainly bloody enough. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a generally solid black IPA, but one whose clashing flavors just don't fully do it for me.","TMoney2591","Oct 16, 2012"

4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nitro growler from the Beer Boutique in Brooklyn. Like a take home cask. This is a black-brown viscous fluid that hits the glass and slowly foams into a somewhat dense, creamy, two finger head. Fade is gentle and leaves some nice lacing. No light getting through this one and as a consequence I have no idea of what the carbonation is doing. Smell is sweet and piney with a lots of roasted malt and a light banana like fruitiness. Toffee and scorched caramel flow into some fresh, yeasty brown sweet bread and hints of coffee and cocoa. Taste is so close to perfect it is killing me not to give it. Sweet and roasted malt front moves to a heavy dose of sweet pine hops that leave grapefruit skin and hop oil. Finish is quite clean and dry with a sweet dark malt syrup flavor and a healthy hop blossoming in the swallow. Feel is velvety and almost cask like with a superfine carbonation that while gentle is quite active somehow. Creamy too. Weight is surprisingly light and supple. Don't get me wrong, it is sticky and has some syrup to it but it drinks like nobody's business and you can quickly find yourself at the bottom of the glass. This is a superb version of an ABA, it hides the abv like a double agent, drinks like a session ale and has a perfect balance of taste with big sweet roasted malt and a pine dominant hop signature. Wow.","scootny","Oct 07, 2012"

The nose features lots of rye up front followed by subtle bitter chocolate and a nice bouquet of herbal hops. The rye is king here, very forward and present with notes of caramel hanging underneath. The taste matches the nose well with more of a roasty emphasis. The hops are also more present on the flavor as well as there is quite a bitter punch to finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a creamy somewhat hefty body. Overall, this is one of the best American Black Ales I have experienced. The rye works really well with the whole profile.

Aroma was a bit muted, but contained scents of piney and floral hops and chocolaty malts. I usually brace myself when I take the first sip of an ABA, but this one was surprisingly mellow and well-balanced. Roasty dark malts with a sensation of bakers' chocolate, countered by citrus and pine hops, that weren't too potent or resinous, as with some other beers of the style. I think brewers are finally starting to nail the ABA. Medium body, smooth and fairly dry in the finish, quite drinkable overall.","Rifugium","Sep 14, 2012"

Smells of hops, no really, piney citrus and resin with a hint of green onion. There's a faint roasty bready malt aroma that attempts to provide some balance but is really only there for show. The flavor hits with a hint of malt first. Caramel, bread, and chocolate are quickly pushed aside by a solid hit of citrus and resinous hop flavor. The chocolate comes back and lingers a bit in a sweet resinous finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel.

3.99,-6.3,4,5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours like a lovely French roast coffee with a white sand head with big rocky bubbles. This beer is opaque and has velvet midnight black in the glass with an ever so slight hint of brown to suggest very dark chocolate, though there are some light carbonation bubbles working their ways up the sides. Lacing is thin but sticky and gorgeous like a complicated root system splaying out beneath a lovely fat ring of soil that surrounds the glass. The beer smells dank and tremendously fruity with fat mango, orange, pineapple and even some slight pine. This is the best fruity smell I can remember getting from any beer in a long time; it’s like a fruit salad in the hops aroma and I am absolutely digging it. Further whiffs suggest the tantalizing roasted coffee malts and dark chocolate below the hops. All the smells come together to overall remind me of a fruit salad lathered in dark chocolate and coffee. The smell alone has me salivating for this beer and upping my expectations tremendously. The beer’s taste loses a lot of that fruit and coffee, but that is not an entirely bad thing. Mango hops are still the dominant flavor for me with some nice side character fruit hops. The dark malts are very sideshow in the flavor, appearing mainly in the middle to provide some lovely creamy roasted flavoring before being flushed away by bitter, less-ripe fruit in the back and aftertaste. A ghost of the roasted chocolate flavor does dance on the fringes, in between the undulations of the fruit hops, but it is quite light. The rye spice is also a ghost in this taste, only slightly suggesting itself as the beer moves over the tongue and lingering a little to meld a spicy burn with the bitter burn. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and almost a touch watery. I kind of want a thicker beer too help bring more of the roasted malt flavor. The mouth is left with a good glaze of saliva and a fizzy, bitter-bitten tongue that is ready for more, if only in moderation. This beer is in between a sipper and a chugger, but I would suggest a more leisurely sip personally. Alcohol is hidden wonderfully for its 8%, with only the suggestion of a bite and burn hidden beneath the bitters. Overall this is a very nice example of the black ale style. Personally, I would love to see a little more malt action in a black ale, but this is very nice more IPA-based black. I also would have loved to see more rye action in this beer, but again the beer worked very well for what the brewer was going for. The smell of this beer is one of the best I have ever smelled, and has me dreaming of big hops and malts. This beer is definitely worthy of a sip and is quite enjoyable.","Maxwell","Aug 30, 2012"

3.95,-7.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Wookey jack pours almost a solid black, with.just faint mahogany highlights shining through. Almost two fingers of bone colored head crown the beer. Retention is good and there's a fair bit og lacing left in its wake. The nose has a bit of dry coffee to it, and that's joined by a juicy pine and citrus aroma. The rye, which was undetectable in the nose, shows up in the flavor profile. It lends a spicy edge to the upfront coffee taste. The mid palate bitterness is fairly noticeable, and provides a nice transition into the finish. That close features a similar pine heavy/citrus light balance to the nose. It's just a little muted though. The body isn't quite bone dry, but it's definitely on the light side. The carbonation though could stand to be just a little more energetic. I've been conditioned to expect great beer from Firestone Walker, and Wookey Jack is no exception.","axeman9182","Aug 30, 2012"

Some roastiness and chocolate on the nose in addition to orange peel and some grapefruit notes. Dark chocolate covered orange, citrus and mild roasty notes, finishes dry with some white pepper spice and mild alcohol. Medium bodied with abundant carbonation, and a slick and creamy mouthfeel.

Aromas of rich, sugary caramel, with a smokey highlight and a tangy, resiny presence. Smells interesting and tasty. Flavors are a darker and heavier roasted sweetness in the backbone, with some plum and date characteristics blending with a roasted coffee bitterness. The hops bitterness then chimes in, with resiny and floral components. Very dark and well blended, presenting with a meatier and smoother feel than most Ryes. Smooth aftertaste of roasted grain and mildly bitter hops. Clean, slightly sweet lingering finish. The beer is easy to drink, and the hops flavors build a bit while you make your way through multiple servings, but overall it avoids being overpowering. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jul 25, 2012"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked this up in a trade with bfg75! Dark brown, almost black pour with a big two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. Glorious nose with loads of piney, resiny hops to complement the rye, which was a little more subdued than I would have expected. Roasty malt with hints of cocoa balance it out nicely. The taste is just as bold as the nose. Tons of resiny, piney, citrus hops are balanced perfectly with a solid roasty malt backbone with hints of caramel and cocoa. The rye is once again subdued, but definitely adds a unique twist to your typical Black IPA. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a nice bitter hop finish. Drinkability is off the charts on this one! Probably the most balanced Black IPA I've tasted to date, maybe even the best overall. Another amazing beer from one of my favorite breweries!

4.4,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The palate opens with a big hop flavor, a blend of citrus, tropical fruit and pine. There's some papaya and pineapple to complement the citrus as well. This is followed by a blend of roast, light caramel and unsweetened cocoa. Cocoa and citrus is a favorite combination of mine, especially when done right, and this beer does just that. The rye does add another dimension, a wholesome, spicy grain flavor that matches well with the pine. The bitterness lasts on the finish, not as resiny as I'd like. Light in body with moderate carbonation, and the alcohol is very well hidden, all of which make this beer very drinkable. While the finish also doesn't have quite enough roast for my liking (and is even a tad watery at times), but it further aids the drinkability of this beer, which is through the roof IMO.","DefenCorps","Jul 17, 2012"

A nice 2 finger mocha head with excellent retention and leaves gobs of lacing throughout. The nose is big with citrus hops, rye spice, and a hint of roasted malts. Inviting. Similarly, the taste starts off with a big citrus hops flavor that blends to a medium bitterness, rye spice, and roasted malt. The rye and citrus work very well together and the hint of roast finishes everything off well. Good. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a great beer. I could drink it all day!","hopfacebrew","Apr 23, 2012"
4.27,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"A very well done ABA, and one I would look forward to enjoying again. Definitely a more hop-forward example of this style, with the rye being a pleasant compliment and just enough roast to make it fit the style.","vkv822","Apr 22, 2012"

4.25,-0.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Poured a dark porter like thickness with limited light coming through. I was very impressed with it's dark reddish brown color. The lacing wasn't much to look at, neither was the head. The smell was that of an imperial ipa, hops, citrus, floral, not so much rye though. Very attractive smell though... The taste was incredible, normaly rye beers for me aren't as big a hit for me but this one hit home. The taste is that of caramel, hops, floral citrus notes with a bit of burnt aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't anything special but it doesn't detract, just something I wouldn't say adds. Overall I would definitely pick this beer up again, and if I ever saw it on tap somewhere, it would be the first beer I tried there.","lsummers","Apr 22, 2012"

4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I had this beer at the SLO Xtreme beerfest. It pours a dark brown--almost black, with glints of red in the light. A tan/taupe head. No head retention, which is not unusual for Firestone Walker creations. The color is misleading as the bouquet has a resiny hop character. Perfectly carbonated. In fact, the ties the resiny hop with the rye flavor with a very smooth transition. Not sure if that was intended or if it occurred serendipitously. Either way, it works.","DocJitsu","Mar 11, 2012"
