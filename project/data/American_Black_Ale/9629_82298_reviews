"Overall-  I was honestly expecting more hop action coming from this brew. it's bitter and has a slightly floral/citrusy hop presence but it's pounded by the malt. this beer reminds me of I think it's anger by greenbush brewery and nighttime by lagunitas. it's playyyyyed! maybe it's the style TO ME but all these black ipa's seem the same. drinkable but nothing special. if you're looking for more of a dark malt driven showcase with some slight hop action this is a beer for you. I just prefer hop explosion."

"Not really a big fan of this one. Pours jet black and almost looks like a stout, but drinks like a normal IPA."

"one of the better shorts beers i have had, these guys are so hit or miss, so its nice to find a hit this strong, thanks to thebrewo for this one. everything you want in a black ipa here, piney bitter hops, literally like a forest in the night, its malt base is bitter too, tons of roast, bitter coffee grinds with the hops, but lots of body too, rich but dry, insanely flavorful, and honestly one of the best examples of the style i have had this year. it seems like the good ones they do never make it to colorado, but the hype around them is real. this has a cocoa layer in it, and some oily properties despite its seeming duality between hops and gain, these elements make it less bitter double jeopardy, and more approachable. it is different in its dry finish though, and in its well hidden abv. these black ipas often come across hot, and this one doesnt at all. palate coating but not super heavy, which is nice. i would imagine big C strain hops, although i cant be sure. not overly complex, but it doesnt need to be. a very easy drinking big beer, and frankly one of the more memorable ones from these guys. excellent late winter early spring seasonality as well."

"Oh, and the title is a Primus reference. Excellence all around. So far, Short's limited releases this year have been killing it over last year's."
"Looks black as it claims to with a tiny ,mocha head. Smell is of hops, malt, caught a whiff of lemon. Each sip starts out like an IPA, mouth full of hops, but with a creamy aftertaste. Truly succeeds in being a creamy IPA unlike a hoppy porter, like some other black IPAs I've had. Damn good."

"Dark Ale with distinct hop aroma, getting the Apollo scent but I'm not quite sure. Hops and coffee on the nose. Mouth feel is wet, malty and delicious. Great lacing, let it sit as it just gets better. i get black patent malts heavy with no smoke but a coffee grind palette and a slight sweet maltiness. IBU's are there but not a dominant hop finish but very crisp, fast finish. FINAL WORD:   Shorts did it again, this beer is very good for the style, very nice for its style. I'd buy it again. cheers"

"Pretty good, but not one of my favorite black ales."

"O - Good beer and one of the better black IPAs I've had. Nice combination of roated malts and piney hop. Recommended."
"Black IPAs and hoppy stouts can fall into a gray area where what they're really trying to achieve can be a bit muddled. I think this one hits the target pretty well. The focus, from the aroma through the finish, is on the hops, although the dark roasty malts are very present."

"O- From a brewery I haven't been overly impressed with so far, this was definitely a quality black IPA and one of their better offerings that I've had. It had a nice balance, was flavorful, and very drinkable for the abv. One of the better black IPAs I've had and definitely worth trying."
"O - Shorts has been hit or miss lately. I worry that they're doing too much by putting out so many different styles all the time. This, however, is not one of those misses. I picked this up as part of a mixed 6-pack, really enjoyed it, and could definitely go for another."
""
""
"Overall- Very interesting smelling Black DIPA that kind of gets muddled on the palate. Perhaps there's too much clashing with each other in terms of the citrusy hop flavours and strong dark malts. Still, I enjoyed this beer and would enjoy it again if presented with the opportunity."
"Overall, shes a keeper in my book. A different take on something that is a staple now in most fridges. Prost to Shorts on this one!"

"I've long been a doubter of Shorts Brewing but having tried this offering, I'm a step closer to being a believer. This ale pours a deep rich black (almost stout like) with a very slight tan head and substantial lacing. The nose is perplexing. There are substantial hop notes with a good deal of pine and grass along side those of coffee and carmely roasted malts. Unfortunately there is also something slightly off and skunky in nature. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. Medium bodied with a nice coating feel. It is actually lighter than I would have guessed it to be. The flavors mirror the nose. With a bitter piney hoppiness upfront followed by a deep coffee/chocolaty malty sweetness. This is damn good and one of the best black ipas I've had. Maybe there is hope for Shorts yet."

"Overall - Good beer. Unique style of beer. You feel as if your drinking two styles of beer at once. On one hand you have all of the citrusy goodness of an IPA, and on the other roasty characteristics that closely resemble a stout especially upon smell. Not dissipointed, glad I tried it."

"Short's: Purveyor of the Gangrenously Whack. This is one of few black ales that doesn't disappoint, perhaps because it goes right up to the edge of too much, then hits the accelerator. Strange, & very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes- I think the hops/malt combo might have contributed to the fruity notes, but it's also possible the hops have faded a bit. If Short's release calendar is accurate, this was released in February. My friend and I both enjoyed it more than Rage though, which is interesting."

"O - This is the last of the six pack that was given to me as a B-Day present from a buddy of mine. All I can say is this is my all time favorite Black IPA and the best offering I have tried from shorts.! If you want an awesome black IPA this is a must try. Its to bad this is a seasonal beer, and I will have to wait almost another whole year to get some more. This beer is best fresh but with some age on it it smooths out considerably. Get this one Cheers!"

"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and full on the tongue. Black IPAs are hit or miss for me sometimes but this was really delicious, especially with the soft, pillowy mouthfeel and high-torque hop profiles."

"Pours a dark brown... basically black with a medium tan head that goes down quickly. Scent is that of a roasty porter or coffee stout. A ton of roasted malt and some dark malt with roasted hop aromas. Very interesting beer here. This has some hoppy notes, but drinks like a well-crafted, roasty porter. The hops are just a plus. Taste is just as it smell. Roasted malt and hops with some chocolate and coffee. Espresso with coffee grounds and hops. This beer is fantastic! One of the best ""black ipas"" and one of the best ""american black ales"" I've ever had. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Drinkability is high."
""
""
"Overall: A very very solid beer. I would say a close second among Black IPA (just trailing Stone's 15th anniversary). I would recommend drinking one at a time, not only for the ABV but also just to spread the wealth."
""
"Highly Recommended!!! Drinks a lot like a RIS... Thanks, Adam."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a tasty American black ale. It is too much for me right now however. Maybe its spring however I am just not a fan of this right now. As fate would have it, I dumped 3/4 of this beer on my rug. Oops. Maybe it was predetermined as I wasnt particularly interested...."

"Overall this is one bad mofo! Not quite the palate wrecker one might fear by being a double (black) IPA. Shorts def puts their skillful hallmark on the deeep daaaarrrk malt bill on this one, but never letting you forget they're the maestros of hop manipulation either. It's kinda like looking up at the hugest, most scary roller coaster in the park. Getting strapped in. And getting the ride you expected, but you didn't die. You didn't even shit yourself. You loved it so much, you got back in line and took it for another ride. Then you gleefully dreamt about it that night, while unknowingly grew a bigger pair."
"I'm usually not a fan of black IPA's but I'm willing to try anything once. This beer is SURPRISINGLY good. Shorts Brewing has been hit or miss IMO but this one is excellent! A nice solid fairly malty backbone to complement the flavorful hops. Not too overwhelming on either the malt or the well rounded hop profile, I would love to have more than one of these, although I would feel much better about drinking it pretty fresh (as I just did). Good choice and thanks again, my favorite black IPA to date!"

"The beer pours jet black with 1/2 an inch if tan head that laces. The nose is citrusy/floral hoppiness forward that transitions into chocolate. The taste is a good balance of hops & chocolate/carob followed by a slightly lingering hoppy bitterness. It's solidly medium bodied smooth, sweet followed by a lingering bitterness and great drinkability for black IPA. This was pretty tasty that I'd drink again in the future."

"O. Very interesting concoction from shorts that is a must try if you can get your Hands on one."
""
"Big flavors of blackened malt and piney hops. Extremely smooth and silky with a nice lingering resiny hop flavor, green and coniferous. Slight malt sweetness, creamy and smooth feel, light carbonation. Damn this is good."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 1/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pine, orange zest, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, orange rind, and floral hops. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, orange rind, cocoa, light char, floral, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, pine, citrus zest, cocoa, char, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Black IPA. Great balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected."
"O - Overall, It was definitely good, although it was far more like a stout than an IPA. Needs more balance."

""
""
"O- Another great ""outside the box"" beer from Short's. It's difficult for me to wrap my head around the whole black IPA thing. To go and imperialize it just leaves me more confused. All I know is I like this beer."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a good example of the style, but there's no confusing this with any other American Black Ale, it's a completely different animal, it's very unique. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, but it's a little too intense to drink multiples of, so I think one bottle is enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and taste, they were really nice, intense yet balanced, I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't say that there's anything that I didn't like or would want to change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again if they release it again, it's already all gone in my area, so I'm glad I picked up a few of these, I recommend this to anyone whole loves Black IPA's and all around intense beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I always expect good things from short's, it's what they do, but I didn't expect to like this beer as much as I did, it really won me over. Short's shows you can take some robust malts and combine them with some intense hops and bitterness and get a great tasting yet well balanced beer that isn't dull in the slightest. Great job Short's, you guys continue to impress me with your awesome and unique brews and this one is no exception, I can't wait to see what other new and crazy beers you have waiting to be unveiled."

"After plowing through my own six pack, I realized I like this even more than I originally thought. Hops had faded a little bit, leaving the beer more ""stout"" like, but it was still delicious. I got more bitter cocoa notes this time that I wasn't getting before. Very roasted, tasty, and unique - like a stout that has been overhopped to oblivion."
""
"A very interesting and well made beer and the first time I've had a Black DIPA. The bitterness is a bit over the top and as a result, one is plenty, but it's still worth a try. I just couldn't see myself buying a 6-pack of this."
""
"Appearance is a dark black color with light head and medium carbonation. Smells are heavy on citrus, with some sweeter malt smells like molasses and raisin mixed in. Taste is that of a very balanced malty IPA with a crisp bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick for an IPA. This is very drinkable and tasty."
""
""
"Completely opaque, black and with a small tan head that sticks mostly to the side of the glass. Color reminds me a of a stout or porter. Smells of roasted barley and citrusy hops. Some coffee and chocolate notes in there as well. Taste has the roastiness somewhat subdued and well-balanced with the bitterness and flavoring of the hops. Finishes dry with the alcohol well-hidden. It teeters on the edge of being a stout, but not quite there. The hops are definitely in the spotlight here. The mouthfeel is moderate and lightly carbonated. Overall, I like these black barleywines. This is a style that I would like to see more. Maybe I'll brew up a batch of my own, and use this as a standard. This is a good brew!"
