"Not a bad black IPA, but not the best I've had either."
""
""
""
"Otter Creek has made it's final run of Black IPA and Copper Ale"
""
""
"Black pour with small tan head. Aroma of citrus, malt, and some alcohol. Initial sweet and malty flavor yields to a hoppy, yet smooth and clean finish. Pleasant aftertaste of roast."
""
""
"Not as complex as some of the others I've tried...however, it is a decent beer..."
"Interesting. Dark amber black when held to light, tan head about 1.5 inches poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pub glass.  Moderate lacing on glass.  Herbal pine and smoked nutty nose.  Smoky nutty malt flavor dominates hoppy bitterness creating an interesting and surprising contrast.  Not unpleasant but to me, it looks and smells better than it tastes.  Mouthfeel is muddled, somewhat soft for an IPA but the bite seems to come from the carbonation and smokiness of the dark roast malt than from the hop bitters."

"Great beer!  Started this snowy night with a taste of this thick, dark IPA.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Smooth, but just enough flavor.  Nice aroma.  Looks good enough to drink poured in a clear pint glass.  Overall, I would easily recommend this beer to others and drink it again."

"This is a very good beer.  Not the biggest fan of Otter Creek in general, but the Black IPA, which drinks more like a black ale - not as hoppy as typical IPAs - was very good."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into snifter, pours a dark brown color with almost no head, good lacing 5 minutes after the pour. Smell is typical of a black IPA, though less inviting than most I've had. Smells of the dark malts used and of hops (thats all I got anyways). Taste is of pine and smokiness, again typical of a black IPA. Mouthfeel is light and watery, Carbonation is just right (a hint more could even be taken). Overall, nothing great, but with a limited craft beer selection at the local gas station it'll do."

"Poured from bottle. Aroma of coffee. Almost completely black, with minimal head. Mild taste. Full bodied, creamy texture. Overall a really great brew. I was tasting other IPA’s while drinking this so it tasted very much like a stout to me. I would be curious to try this with other stouts to make that comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good color, almost black. Head was about 2 fingers, maybe a little more. Head developed quickly and held for a decent amount of time. Flavor is malty with a little amount of hop bitterness to balance it out. Just a tad too sweet for me as far as IPA's go, but overall, a very nice, drinkable beer......."
"-Overall- my introduction to black ipa's, different for sure, not unpleasant but different. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick up this style again but it's good, -BMFR-"

"O: After the disaster of a pour I expected things to continue to be bad for this one. However, everything is in balance. Nice balance of hops, low bitter, some smoky cocoa on the finish and really smooth mouth feel. I would like to drink this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - excellent session beer, lots of flavor in an all-season style."
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint garnet highlights at the edges and a decent sized creamy beige head that persists for a good long time before sticking lots of lace to the sides. Aromas of roasted coffee with a hint of caramel and some light earth and citrus notes. The flavor follows the aroma to a T. Roast and light chocolate and caramel with a light earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost gritty mouthfeel. Virtually non existent hop aroma makes me want to call this a porter or dry stout. The flavor has some hop to it, but the beer in this bottle is either old or there aren't enough hops in here to call this an IPA. MEH!"

"A deep brown almost black pour with 2 fingers of fluffy tan head, great lacing and slow dissipation. The aroma is a bit off putting - rust, coconut, soap, coffee.. Definitely intriguing. The flavor is much better thankfully. A mellow arrangement of chocolate, roasted grains and grassy hops. Medium in body with a good amount of carbonation to distinguish it from a stout. A bit too herbal for my preference, but not a bad example of the style by any means."
""
""
"I think my tastes either changed over time or I grew tired of this newer style. This bottle came out of a mixed 12 pack bottled in early January. Either way, don't let my opinion stop you from trying this beer. It's a great start for those who wish to explore American Black Ales."

"This beer sits somewhere between a porter and a black IPA, but finds a way to work. It's certainly challenging enough to take your time with, yet drinkable enough to put several away. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A really solid beer that stands out more with food. Paired it with shepherd's pie on a second tasting and it matched up well on a cold, rainy New England night with comfort food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Average at best in terms of both style and overall beerdom... Not a bad beer, but it's just kind of there... I would have never known this was an American Black Ale if it weren't listed on the able... Seems to closer resemble either a Milk Stout or Foreign / Export Stout... I would neither recommend nor revisit..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the better black IPAs for sure. Easy to put down several of these, but of course with such drinkability often comes a lack of richness, body, and flavor. Still a solid brew though."
""
"O- It was fresh, but the hops don't make it to IPA grade for me. Pale ale, perhaps. Still a decent drink."

"this is better than most, a rich and decadent brew, now available year-round. it has a nice chalky dark brown color to it with a fluffy lighter brown head and a nose of chocolate malts, cocoa, bitter hops, and oatmeal. the hops balance but do not dominate as they usually do in this style, and I find this to be a real nicely put together beer, very approachable. my palate is greeted by warming chocolate notes from the malt long before I get any hops, which in the end turn out to be more bitter than flavorful, which I think works well with the dark roasted barley. full bodied creamy feel to this, thick and delicious, down easy for what it is. one of otter creeks better beers, I was impressed by this one from the first sip."
""
""
""

"None of the tropical fruit tones which I typically associate with ""Cascadian"" and this style, but enough going on that I'll definitely buy it again."

"More of a hoppy porter, I'd like more hop flavour in a black IPA."
""
"It's not a bad beer, but it is no Black IPA. The fact that Black IPAs are put under the style American Black Ale on here muddies the waters even further. I'm wary of falling into the trend of calling every hoppy beer ""India ___," but there really needs to be two separate styles; if it were up to me, I'd call any regular black ale an ABA, and call hoppy black ales Cascadian Dark Ales."

"3.0 D: I guess I was wrong about the black IPA thing just being a fad. It pains me to see ""now year round!"" on this label, but that's okay, I'll just pass over it year round at the beer store."

"O: Much more malt forward, featuring all the aspects of a dark, malty beer. There are lots of bittering hops, but very low for an IPA. I love big malty beers so this is OK, but seems to miss the mark stylistically. To me, this beer drinks more like a porter, and a very good one at that."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice Black IPA. Nothing ""swept me off my feet", but, it was still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad black IPA"
"O: A tasty black IPA featuring more darkly roasted malts, yet with only a limited and quite acceptable burnt quality. Rich and moderately complex, this is a very big beer for 6% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great blend for a Black IPA, while this could use more hops, its one of the better Black IPA's I've had. This is extremely drinkable, and full of good flavors."

"Dead black IPA. One of the darkest IPAs we've reviewed. Decent head. Hoppy IPA aroma. Hoppy, chocolate, toasted caramel notes in taste. Mix a porter and an IPA. If you love IPA and wish it was darker this is the beer for you. Really strikes as a dark pale ale or IPA. Would go great with a cannoli or a sweet dessert. Would definitely not work historically, however is a great dark variety."
""
""

"Overall: Pretty nice black ale. Will look for more of this in the future."

"O: Not bad at all. It's a little less complex than the Black IPA's I really like, but I'm very glad I tried this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- this was enjoyable but bit super complex you decide whether that's good or bad but I liked it. Definately worth a try, but not the BIPA I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark amber-brown into black coloring with a frothy, filmy, low profile, light tan head that quickly disipates across the surface. Aromas of roasted grains, citrus highlights of grapefruit and tangerine, and a resiny, rich hops presence. Not overpowering on the nose, and very well balanced. Flavors of roast and hops hit the palate at the same time, with a bitter campfire balancing the bitter, floral, and tree sap punch of the hops. Some of the citrus shines through on the mid-tongue, allowing a break from the more intense flavors you get on the first sip. The aftertaste is more bitter, and slightly tangy, with the citrus and hops now taking the driver's seat. Smooth bodied, with a clean, slightly drying finish. Very tasty brew!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this, as it was almost two beers in one as the hop flavor melted into more of a brown ale. I do not like overhopped ales, and this one had a quick-hitting hop flavor that dissipated pretty quick. I found this very drinkable, and yet another smooth offering from Otter Creek. I will definitely try again. 4/5"
""
""
""
"O: While the taste is not quite as complex as the smell, this is a very enjoyable beer - nice roasty malts with not overpowering IPA hops. Relatively easy to drink and a great deal considering how inexpensive it was..."
""
""
"O- This is a touch roastier and a touch lower in hop aroma and flavor than I would have liked but all around this is a nice black IPA. A style I enjoy and one of the better ones in the style that I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels medium in body, and dry to the palate."
"O: A very good and affordable black IPA. It's not the best, but for the price it is a steal. This has the potential to be a ""go-to"" beer or something that can be drank for an entire evening, not just one or two."
"This is my new go-to beer. Very reasonable at $8.50 per six-pack. It is as black as a trojan horse at midnight, with a beautiful coffee colored head. Malty attack, with a nice dry hoppy finish. Wonderfully balanced, with enough intrigue to keep you coming back for more. In an age of extreme beers, this one has just the right blend of restraint vs. excitment. I could drink this beer everyday (and I just might)."
""
"O: This beer was OK, nothing to brag about. It tasted good but was very watery and not to hoppy."
""
"O - Really solid black IPA, well thought out and with an excellent drinkability. Seek it out! 4/5"
""
""
""
""
"O-Highly enjoyable and drinkable beer. Fuses two of my favorite styles, Ipa's and Stouts into one great beer. Would get a higher rating if the IPA part of the name would come through more in the overall aroma and taste. Great beer none the less."
""
""
"This had a slight kick to it but nothing that would knock anyone over. Even though I only bought one bottle, I could probably down a few of these at once, since this was quite drinkable. I like beers of this style to be a bit more bold since this is a groundbreaking category of sorts but anyone who has never tried something of this nature before would be well versed to start with this beer."
""
""
""
"The nose on this one really struck me as more malty and chocolate-y than I would expect from this style. The flavor is a bit different than what I'm usually getting from the black ales. But this is an okay version of the style. Perhaps it's an issue of preference. This one works and is certainly no trainwreck, but the finer points of others win me over just a bit more."
""
""
"O: Never had a Black IPA before but it seems to blend well the characters of an IPA with a dark porter or a light stout. Very pleasant surprise from such an underrated brewer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent Black IPA. It's malt forward but there's an obviously heavy hop presence. The hops are a bit at odds with the malt however. The malt is bitter and roasty and the hops are citrusy. A bit of balance would be nice. I wouldn't turn this down. but I won't seek it out again."
"This is a good, but not great version of a black ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall nice beer not as good as other black ipa's. The taste is a little off for the style more stout or porter like. Still a good beer though."
""
""
"Just to the right if light bodied. Drinks easy enough. I'd call this a pretty good middle of the road for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Having a small yet growing appreciation for the Black IPA's, I came across the Otter Creek Brewing (OCB) edition while ""making"" a six-pack for the weekend. First taste was actually a little rough as the hops actually flew out of the bottle and assaulted my poor taste buds. Drinking straight from the bottle, about a quarter of the way in, the taste softened a bit (or my tongue was numbed) either way, the OCB was evolving into a very drinkable beverage. Not quite sure what the aftertaste reminds me of but it is pleasant and does not leave the harsh wash some IPAs do. I imagine it would go well with a peppered cheese snack if you’re into that kind of thing. Overall, an above-average entry and one I wouldn’t hesitate to enjoy again!"
""
""
"Where this beer tends to fall in the average category is the nose and appearance - nothing wrong it just doesn't really stand out enough to pour it out into a glass. It's the balance and tempered nature of the brew that keeps it in my rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a decent drinking beer, but needs better balance asmalt dominates more than I would like"
"In conclusion this is a solid Black Ale. There were many similarities to the 2011 Sierra Nevada Beer Camp#16 Juniper Black Ale which was almost a 4.0 rating in my opinion."
""
""
"Brew is one of the best black IPA's I have had. The lower ABV makes this one you can drink all night. Great stuff here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable enough, pleasing balance, but more a lighter-bodied porter than anything else. Would buy again if I was in the mood for a darker session beer."
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body, kinda thick, moderate carbonation. Definitely would get again- but again tastes more like a porter."
"Overall an interesting beer,to me tasted more like a porter than an ipa but this is probably the best black ipa I've had so far."
""
"O: I'm usually not a big BIPA fan, but I dug this one quite a bit. The best in the Otter Creek snack pack IMO."
""
""
"D - Really well done Black IPA that avoids the major pitfalls inherent to the style. Maybe not at the sublime level of Hill Farmstead's offerings, but pretty excellent for a beer available in six-packs at the local store. Would happily drink this one again."
"Overall this is a good tasting IPA; very good for those who would like to try an IPA but might be put off by the bitterness of some IPA's. Well flavored and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a black body with slight ruby-red highlights and and an impressive inch or so of khaki-colored head with some decent lacing. Espresso bean and grapefruit share the aroma fairly equally. Espresso hits the palate first with grapefruit and lemon hitting soon thereafter to balance. Medium in body and carbonation. A bit more malt-forward than other examples of the style I've had, but it's good. The roasty malt and citrissy hops compliment each other quite nicely. Terrific."
""
"I just love this beer. It’s a great departure from a standard IPA and/or Stout. Not sure what you’re in the mood for? This fits the bill. I will get this whenever I can."
""
""
""
"Nice blend of hops, roasted malt, malty sweetness, and hints of toffee. Medium bodied, mildly bitter finish. Glad they finally decided to brew this one year-round."
""
""
""
"The malt body is prominent enough to present some bold flavors while holding everything together just long enough to give the hops a moment to shine as well. Really gets your tongue thinking. Coffee, roasted barley, burnt toast, citric and flowery hops with a touch of pine. It's all there in one deep swell of a sip. Interesting and enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel: The carbonation and thickness of the liquid is well balanced. This feature is a plus for drinkability. The lack of bitterness would make this IPA along with its texture a good match for a lighter flavored food pairing than the usual IPA recommendations."
""
"Overall- This is the gold standard of black ipa’s as far as I am concerned. If you have never had a black ipa, this one will tell you what they are supposed to taste like. It is not merely an ipa in dark clothing. Instead it takes the hop and malt notes of a good ipa and combines them with the roasted notes of a good porter."
""
""
"D - The hoppy nose was rather deceiving, as the roasted malt was dominant all the way through. But it's still an enjoyable brew, and highly drinkable. I haven't tried many black IPAs but this one leaves a good impression of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: I loved this black IPA. Really enjoyed the combination of hops and malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its not bad at all, but I'm not jumping out of my seat."
"Overall- solid beer, not the best black ipa but worth a taste. I would seek out again."
""
"This is a worthy addition to the style, but not my favorite."
""
""
"Overall I was impressed with this beer, given my first foray into the style. I look forward to enjoying this again in the near future."
""
"Unlike some brews of this genre, this beer actually fits the style. It has good balance in the palate and doesn't seem like a hoppy stout or an IPA with added color. The nose is hop forward with subtle chocolate notes. The piney hops are countered with lighty roasted grain and really seems to all come together on the tongue. A nice suprise from OCB in a style that I typically shy away from. Cheers!"
""
"O: this is a very good Dark IPA. The only other I've had is Hop in the Dark by Deschutes and this one is way better. Highly recommend."
"D: Not as much hop brightness & vividness, but it does have bitterness and character. Similarly, it nails the roasty, but without the malty depth & roundness of some others. Hint more than enough of the right notes to be well within style. And it is rather tasty and drinkable. Good, but not special."
"O: i was really impressed by this one, i find most black IPAs lack the IPA and are just focused on the deep malts, this one has a really nice balance and is really drinkable"
""
""
""
" the tast has a mild bitter taste with slight pine accent up front and mild toasted grain which has low roast notes and slight peppery quality. The actual hop flavor is pretty nice with kind of comes off as grassyy with mild flavor of stone fruit from the yeast adding to the overall sweetness and the finish is somewhat dry. Overall a pretty solid beer with no lack of hop flavor. This beer doesn't stand out in the style for me it is a good choice but still just above average."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slick black, with a one inch light tan head, with beautiful lace, and good retention. Smell is, citrus, pine, chocolate, and toffee. Taste is very big, a big hit of coffee to go with all the flavors in the nose. Body is large for the ABV, lots of life, medium dry, and easy drinking. This is a very nice beer and $7.99 a six pack it is the best black Ila for the dollar I have seen."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. For 6% the alcohol is well integrated. For a style I normally dont totally get, this one was pretty enjoyable because of the balance of flavors and uniqueness. If I had to drink this style, I wouldn't mind having this again. If you really dig this style though, this is one to seek out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one good beer. The best of anything I have tried with Wolvers/otter creek and a beer that is excellent as a standard go to."
""
""
"Eric"
""
"O: this is good for its style and great to me."
""
""
""
"O: Not a style I love, but this is pretty good as they go."
""
"Not a bad little beer. It isn't intense by any stretch, but it has a nice balanced feel to it without forgetting its an IPA, making for a nice drinkability. I wouldn't turn one down."
""
"M: The mouthfeel is quite good, bringing both flavors im more-than-ample proportions. Well-roasted and super-citrusy. I ended up having two glasses."
""
"O - Well, I'll re-review if I ever get a better bottle. The infection kills this one. It tastes bad, and that's why."
""
"Overall this beer is delicious. The flavors are mild and well blended but the citrus and bitter hop bite is certainly not covered up or overly subdued. A good beer and I would like to try more of this style."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little creamy. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style. The hops definitely stood out in it, but the roasted malts definitely were evident as well."
""
""
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, nice kick, very good representation of style."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to admit I don't get the Black IPA style, the hops and the roasted flavors seem to be struggling against each other. In most other Black IPAs I've tried this contrast of flavors doesn't really work well for me, but Otter Creek seems to get the balance right. If you want some roasted flavor to back up your IPA then this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
""
"It is a bit more smokey tasting than roasty. It looks good in a glass, with nice lacing, but pitch black. It has a unique but appropriate taste."
""
""
""
"O - decent, wonder why they call it an IPA - I expected more hops. Instead it's closer to a porter, I think."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good body and mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Recommended."

"bottled 10-11-11, so just about 1.5mos. old. black (of course) with a tan head. attractive enough, but on to the good part... nose is a blast of pine that seems to mingle very well with dark chocolate, roasted malt and some sweet caramel/brown sugar notes. some citrus folded in as well. very nice. actually had the first one from the bottle at thanksgiving dinner, and the aromas were coming out of the neck something fierce. smuggled two home and tried again with a glass. taste exudes really good balance, and pulls off exactly what they were going for. a piney snow coating over dark malty flavors to create a new landscape. nicely intertwined citrusy fruit peeking out here and there as well. medium body with a slick and almost wet (if that makes sense) feel. no bad aftertastes, barely any heat, and pretty well defined (not muddy). not a hops smack, but a well-balanced and well done, easy drinking brew. choco-roasty-pine-fruit sends an impressive message from otter creek. more good things in store?"
""
""

""

"Final Thoughts: Probably the best black IPA I've had so far. It's a simple black ipa, but its done totally right. Worth a buy for sure, I only got a single in a pick-a-six but I could get a full sixer and not be bored with this one. Very well put together, very nicely done. Will surely keep an eye out for Otter Creek in the future."

"O: I nice little black ale here. Nothing out of this world (though I am yet to have a beer in this style that is), but gets the job done."
""
""
""
""
"Even though a Black IPA is an oxymoron, I still like this beer. It's very well balanced with a number a flavor profiles that complement each other. It contains the right amount of hops to be considered an IPA, but not too many which would take away from the roasted malt profile. I've seen a number of reviewers saying the roasted malt in this beer left a burnt taste in there mouth. This didn't occur to me, maybe they changed their recipe recently. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is craving a roasted malt beer and IPA at the same time."
"Overall, I must admit to being pleasantly surprised. I thought the label art to be rather cheesy, and inferred that the brewing process was similary shortcutted. Instead, I find this to be an aromatic, tasty beer, which I would definitley have again. Still, thought, they've got to change this label, it looks like it was created with on-line clip art."
"overall = my favorite beer. If you drank this blind folded, you wouldn't know it was a black beer. This beer is the perfect example of how people generally move from lighter to darker beers as their palette becomes knowledgeable. To be honest, this is my first and only beer of this style (american black ale), and there may be others out there by different breweries that I would actually like more."
"D - The flavor starts out good but finishes somewhere I don't want to go. It just has a charred flavor."
"o-overall it's a very solid beer that I will come back for. One of my first few black ipas that I have tried so I'm not as up on the style as I am with others."
"Good mouthfeel with medium carbonation and a touchy of creaminess/tongue coating oils. Very drinkable. Lingering bitterness in the finish, but not overly long. If you enjoy this style this is certainly one to try."
"o - Overall a nice Black IPA. I liked the nose a lot, though I thought the taste was a little bit one dimensional being very roasted. Would give it another shot."
"Overall, we say get it, drink it and enjoy it. Will go well with a cheese, swiss, blu, or sharp.. Oh.. try it with a good hotdog... really!"
"It's only the second black IPA I've tried, and for the second time I'm not overly impressed. A fine beer I suppose, but I don't think its particularly brilliant. It kicks around some hops here and there, and is a little more strong on the roasted malts. This is also my first time with Otter Creek, I think. I got it pretty cheap at Trader Joe's, so not the massive investment that comes occasionally with some others. In general I'd say it more or less met my expectations, but I'd have been a little happier with something a little stronger and a little bolder. It's now advertised as year round; I'll probably look elsewhere though for some variety."
"O: Very drinkable, reminds me of a sam adams in a way that things are nicely balanced, solid flavor and makes for a very smooth drinking experience. While others strive for brute force this finds a good niche among the crowd who enjoy balance and smooth drinkability. A few of these can definitely go down no problem at all."
"O - a good Black IPA that begins to lean towards hoppy porter but stays well shy; well done"
"O'all - A big flavorful beer, but too roasty and without a big, bright hop presence as would like to see in the style. Fans of big porters likely would like this one as well."
"O/D: Really solid offering, a beer much better on tap. A style I'm really starting to enjoy, and you should start here."
"Cheers!"
"A nice smooth medium bodied beer, nice carb level and just a great tasting easy-drinking beer."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this was an enjoyable version."
"This is one of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen. It pours a nearly impenetrable black with a big brown head that is at first billowing and frumpy and then settles into a thumb-thick layer with outstanding retention. Aromas are delightfully hopping, with lots of citrusy and evergreen needle notes, with a good amount of charred character. Good flavors that consistent with the those but more complex due to a sweeter, toffee taste on the mid-palate. Lingering notes of coffee and orange zest. A very tasty beer. Almost as good as Black IPAs that cost 3 or 4 times as much, making this an excellent value."
"OVerall: The taste of this beer is quite interesting to say the least. It's kinda funky and kinda sweet at the same time just like a hippie from Oregon"
"Overall, not bad and probably decent for the style."
"Not overwhelmingly amazing, although enjoyable enough if you like this style."
"To be truthful, I did not enjoy this brew the first two times I had it. This third time, though, I really appreciated the equally considered malt and hop characters."
"Came in a summer sampler 12 pack. Poured dark with a good about of head. The color was near pitch black and the head was a brownish color. As a black IPA the IPA taste came first, hoppy, but a stout-coffee-type taste came after and lingered much longer. Never seen this style before so was curious but a very good choice and glad that I got it."
"While this is not particularly exciting, it's not bad. It's definitely worth a try. Very drinkable, and it's kind of sad that it is only available in the winter."
"the appeal of a good porter with a over hopped fruit to it. there is some back note of chocolate and coffee that are blended with the front of mouth hop dryness. not tannin sticky. sort of has a quick finish with some porter notes that fade faster than a porter. a hint of grass. a hint of chocolate."
"It was better fresh on draft when I had it a few months ago. Now, just kinda ""meh""."
"This is a stout beer with some extra hop kick. This is not an IPA. Let's stick to stouts being stout and IPAs being IPAs. Please don't try to mix -- each is terrific in its own right, but they aren't made to be married. The flavor just isn't doing it for me."
"This is a tasty brew from Otter Creek. One of the better offerings that I've had from them in recent memory."
"Overall i really like this brew, the roasted malts and the strong amount of hops play well together. This is not for every palate but give it a shot if you like the above qualities!"
"Overall, tasty brew; I am really becoming a fan American Black Ales, Black IPA's, whatever you want to call them. It doesn't appear many BA's seem to favor this style. I love Porters, Stouts and IPA's and what's better than a beer that represents all those styles? I get a very nice balance of those styles in this brew; I have had better of course but certainly worth checking out this Black IPA."
"D. I thought it was very good overall. I would drink this again..and again. :)"
"D - Pretty good, other than a few flaws. Nothing that would prevent me from having another though. I like this emerging style we have here."
"A very good Black IPA and not to intense or high in ABV to where you couldn't have a few!"
"I wonder why these black beers have such a propensity to created such a big, dense head. Here, it was two rocky fingers of deep-mocha head with enviable retention. Color was ... talk about truth in advertising ... jet black. There was no light penetration whatsoever. That's OK since some of my friendliest beers are Black. They CAN come over to my house any time. In fact, some of them are really liked by my sister. She's into Black. Nose was initially bursting with piney hops, but a second whiff gave me smoke and dark chocolate. This is what bothers me about the style - it is like the old Reese's commercial - ""Hey, you got your chocolate in my peanut butter! No, man, you got my peanut butter on your chocolate!"" with the tag line being ""Two great tastes that taste great together."" Yeah, well, keep your roasted malts OUT of my AmeriCAN IPAs, dang it. Mouthfeel was medium but there was a fistfight on my tongue. Smoke then bitter then chocolate then more bitter until the melange tasted like a hangover morning. This is NOT my bag, baby! What happened - some genius got bored and thought that this would be a good idea? Epic fail! The finish left me gasping for breath and not in a good way. It tasted like the fire in the hops plant that caused the dry spell a few years back. Jeez-O, man. Color me not a fan."
"Pours black-hole black and hazy, with a nice off-white head that recedes to just a thin layer. Big pine hop scent up front, with roasty malts in the background. Taste of bitter, piney hops up front...if you weren't expecting such a dark ale to be hoppy, you will be surprised. Mild essence of citrus zest just noticeable, pine resin, grass, and a good malt roastiness to follow, but with the hops ever-present throughout. Rich and flavorful, medium mouthfeel, and very drinkable, mainly if you like your hops, which I do."
"Mouthfeel is very good, obviously full bodied. Smooth beer, with a great carbonation level. It has a strong earthy finish from the hops at the end. Very drinkable, easy going down. Very good for the style and a great new addition to the Otter Creek lineup in my opinion."
"O - Don't know what I was expecting with this, but I was thoroughly impressed. Nice big, citrus-y Black IPA. Will definitely seek this out in the future."
"This is a well done Black IPA and definitely one of the most reasonably priced. Glad to see this is year round as it's definitely something I could see myself buying again. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and oily slick, with light carbonation, a medium body and a light and almost watery feel. Highly drinkable, this was very good and a very tasty beer."
"Very dark brown, nearly aque with just a hint of lit making it through the beer. Fine, dark tan bubbles coated the top of the beer, leaving solid sheets of lacing on the glass. Good head retention. Nice aroma, caramel and chocolate underneath grapefruit and citrus pith. Solid bitterness, nicely balanced with the malt sweetness and citrusy hop character. Caramel, chocolate, creamy texture, medium bodied, slightly dry with a bit of spiciness in the finish. A good take on the style, well balanced and quite drinkable."
"Solid offering - pretty straight forward and approachable for the odd style. Perhaps a little too smooth a mouthfeel - I think it could be a little more prickly."
"Great beer, only the second of two BIPAs that i've tried and this was pretty dern good."
"A touch shy of ink black with a foamy cola colored cap that rose two fingers before falling slowly. A soft aroma of roast pokes through first before spruce tips and mint take over. Not an overwhelming aroma, but soft and pleasing. The flavor profile is very similar to the nose. A light roast that has a touch of char to it with some cocoa powder leads off with a minty, spruce, herbal hop profile taking over down the homestretch. The finish is minty with a touch of lingering char. Overall I found this to do everything pretty good, but nothing great. A solid example of the style that I would seek out again."
"Overall a very nice, balanced black ale. Not a homerun, but that may be due to age. Hops were a little subdued for my liking."
"Pours a dark brown colour with some hints of amber. Thick tan head that takes a while to dissipate, some streaks of mild lacing on the glass. Smells of roasted coffee with citrus hops and roasted malt. Nice bitter flavour, lots of sweetness as well. Some chocolate in the aftertaste I think. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Quite a nice Black IPA."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. For my first beer in the style, I have to say it came off a bit better than I was expecting. Smelling a dark beer and getting crisp hops is definitely a strange feeling, but I just see it as taking the hoppy stout to the next level. I will definitely be seeking out some other Black IPAs now!"
"Big, close to three finger head, rich mix of varied bubble sizes, even dissolve without much dimpling, dark tan in color, lacing more along the lines of broad splotches than streaks, very good stick, barely moves long after the head settles. Liquid color certainly lives up to its billing, black and opaque, even if not “dense” in appearance, thin orange rust influence at the glass bottom. The nose is a pleasing mélange of malts and hops with cocoa powder, mocha, ginger snaps, walnuts and then tangerine zest, green hay and grass, wildflowers and a glance of apricot, red apple, cherry fruit scents, good stiffness and length. Medium-bodied, too tightly woven to be heavier, plus the carbonation has a steady, lifting quality which prevents too much soaking in. More overt roast here, at once plays up its overall bitterness while emphasizing mocha, cocoa, molasses, dark chocolate. That tangerine to white grapefruit element keeps the energy high while adding a bit of needed sweetness. Pepper and clove spice keep it lively, the herbaceousness stays in check. Not as floral here, however, the apricot, peach, apple fruit a tick higher. Dry finish with good grip and palate coverage. Excellent example of a category growing in popularity."
"This fine brew pours a solid black with big frothy head, this looks very delicious and tempting, has the look of a big time stout. The distinct smell of fresh bittering hops blasts through the nose and teases the brain with delight. Very sweet and mild malts mixed with a bit of roasted malts. Taste big citrus hops with a big toasted malty over tone that ends with a nutty and/or chocolate finish. Lite to medium mouth feel, watery, a tad bitter. Overall, this is a really nice black ipa, a nice mix of almost a porter/stout and a ipa. A fine blend."
"I do not work for Otter Creek or its affiliates :)"
"Perfect example, don't judge a book by its cover. Tastes nothing like it looks."
"This style is fast becoming a favorite of mine and this is a solid example. Low on the alcohol but rich in the flavor. Dare I say almost sessionable ;)"
"M&D - Creamyish and very smooth, light bodied, and strong carbonation. Not exactly what you'd expect, but it's decent. I'd order it again. Not a style I have a lot of experience with, but something I think I'd like with a bigger hop bite."
"Overall a good solid beer. Very drinkable with a big flavor. A bit high octane for a session beer, but I could see myself drinking a few of these. This is a really good every-day type of beer."
"Pours a nice one finger head. The colors are very interesting, because the body is not black (like the bottle indicated it would be), it's like a dark dark dark brown, it's very close to being black, but it is brown. I say the color is weird because the head is pretty dark, I usually only notice dark heads in pitch black beers, oh well. The head has faded a little bit now, it looks like it's leaving good lacing though. It looks like a very yummy beer, I would like a bigger head, but whatever. Man, I love black IPA'S, this beer smells like it has just a perfect balance of hops and malts, as perfect as you can get, they smell just so well blended together, no aroma dominates. On some sniffs you get that chocolate malt smell, and on other sniffs you get that crisp hop smell. I'm excited to taste this because it smells so good, but then again, most black IPA's smell good. The only thing not great about the smell is that it's not too complex, but who cares? It smells great. The first thing I notice is a nice big mouthfeel on this, I love it when my beers have a big body and mouthfeel on them. Is it the biggest mouthfeel ever? No, but it's an IPA, so a good mouthfeel, however big it is, is impressive. I then notice the taste, which is just like the smell, perfectly blended hops and malts, really really tasty. I mean it's very simple, but it's just really well done. I can't give it style points, but I can give it plenty of brew points! There is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, at all. If it were a little more complex, I would consider giving it a few 5's. As it is though, great beer, great flavor, super well done!"
"The beer poured black with a tan head. The aroma was of sharp floral hops, while simple it was very enticing. The taste is of lightly toasted malt with a nice floral hop overtone. The feel is medium and wet. This was a most pleasant beer, and one I will seek out in the future."
"Overall I thought this was a really good beer."
"Iam 50/50 on American black ales,some I have really liked,some didnt work very well for me,this was great.Poured into a stansard pint glass a deep cola color with a thinner but retentive beige colored head.Aromas of black malt and a big grapefruit rind shot,not much sweetness was detected.A real nice mix of in your face citric hops and unsweetened bitter chocolate,I was surprised at how well the dry chocolate held up to the hops,the malt profile is quite dry.With the big hops and sweetness in check this a very drinkable and very well made beer,I really liked this one."
"Pours a dark ruby color with a tan, mocha colored head that did last along the edges. The aroma is a muted American hop bouquet. It seems like the roasted malts keep the aroma down a tad. The longer the beer sits the more the roasted malt comes through. The inital taste is the American hops: slightly piney, some grapefruit. The finish turns to the roasty malt and chewy sweetness much like a porter. The mouthfeel is medium with too much carbonation and too much alcohol warmth. I love the idea of this style but I haven't had one yet that I thought really brought everything together with the IPA hoppiness and roastly malt finish. I think this would be improved with English hops and a less attenuating yeast."
"Overall an awesome black IPA. I personally like regular and double IPA's but this black one is pretty good."
"overall a very solid beer, great for the style and one of the best i have had."
"Edit: I was a bit too harsh."
"This is a very nice Black IPA and one of the better ones I've tried recently. Lots of resin and oily hop characters to add to the mocha, chicory and and almost licorice taste from the malts. Just a very nice and complex beer. I could easily drink a couple of these."
"Overall: Very good and not overly bitter American Black Ale. I could have several of these and this is one of the better examples in the style I have found so far. I like the pine flavors."
"Cheers."
"D- Moderately high. I'd blow through a few of these in a row. Pretty tasty and drinkable. Worth trying, at least. Would think that this could use an increase in the malt bill to beef it up a bit flavor-wise, but it's pretty drinkable as-is. Just doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd."
"D - This is a nice Black Ale and I'm happy to see one in a 12 oz. bottle...if you want to get the real feel for this beer let it warm up...if not, drink it cold and get the full hop effect"
"The cpj"
"Cask at Rattle 'N' Hum second day. Medium mouthfeel. Hoppy dark cascadian hop.Also Apollo and other hops. Unfiltered, Good drinkability, though a tad of stringency. A little chocolate and roast. Dark coloured body.Another good one recently from Otter Creek."
"The taste is similarly front loaded with hop flavors but the malt kicks in later. Roasted and coffee and baker's chocolate versus citrus and pine oil. I'd like to say it's well balanced but it sometimes seems as if the flavors are fighting each other instead of cooperating. Mouthfeel is adequately stiff and a touch overcarbonated. Smooth in texture as expected. Not my speed I guess but you could certainly do much worse."
"D: Pretty good but for some reason I just don't want to drink too much of this. Maybe I'm not a fan of the style."
"Overall a bit schizophrenic, but tasty nonetheless - not just a ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter," but actually like alternating different beers. Good stuff."
"This beer reminds me of Dogfish Head Chicory Stout but obviously with more hops and more of a bitter bite which it should because that's just a stout and they claim this to be an IPA.... which it is. First beer from Otter Creek and it stands up with the best of the craft breweries yet only 7.99 a 6 pack."
"Poured into my beer glass. Looks like a thin black. Poured a nice head that dissipated but leaves patches of lingering lacieness. Mostly hops in the aroma. I didn't think I was going to like this but I do. I find a sweet maltiness up front with a bitter finish. It's a decent beer. Probably won't buy it again though. Would be good with some stinky cheese."
"Hopped up ale, plenty of dark malts, dark chocolate, and some smoke. Hops dry things out, but dont leap out all over the malts. Balance is the deal here and I'm liking it. Nice job here by the Otter Creek crew."
"This is a good beer and a good take on the style. It's a relatively light, easy drinking brew that sells for a very affordable $8 a sixer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with a thick, creamy, long lasting head and much lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops with some hints of milk chocolate. Medium, tangy body. Citrus fruit and peppery hops dominate the palate with chocolate, roasted malt and hints of vanilla and cocoa provide some balance. Not a bad brew at all."
"D - I would consider getting a six pack. Otter creek has earned my respect on this since it is a fairly good black IPA. Roasty and piney good!"
"Pours a three finger khaki head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Totally black color, no highlights. Light medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hop nose and flavor is resin/pine hops that the malts almost balance, ends with a slight bitter aftertaste. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"Overall this is a good brew. I think there is too much hop on the initial nose and palate. The flavors seem slightly off balance by coming in contact with two extremes of hops and then malt. There doesn't really seem to be much middle ground there. However, given that this is a progressing style, it is an interesting take on it."
"Based on taste alone I might've taken this to be a regular IPA. The hops mostly cover up the dark stuff."
"Pourede from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops, some hints of citrus. Taste is also very hoppy, some citrus notes. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty solid brew."
"Impression: Value isn't supposed to enter here, but for the money this is the best Black IPA out there. I wish I could get more. Wait. I can. I will. Suggest you do the same."
"D - One of my favorite beers."
"Unfortunately, though I love the smell, I don't think I would really have another one. I liked it when I was drinking it, but I have found other beers far more memorable, and I think I will just keep looking for better Black IPA's out there. I'm sorry....American Black Ales."
"Feels more like a porter than a BIPA, but who am I to judge. Hmm, looks like BA is too judge, as I just noticed this is listed as a Black Ale. Wish i had more than just one, seek this one out if you can."
"D. I am glad i picked up two of these beers to try. I am totally into this beer. Otter Creek surprises me again!! I'm really starting to like there brews."
"A good run at this new-ish style, slightly above the middle of the pack IMO and I am glad I tried it."
"A little thin in the mouth, but still an enjoyable beer."
"D - For a bolder beer, totally drinkable."
"D: This beer smells much more hoppy than it tastes, so I was surprised by that. The roasted malt character is more prevalent, so balance leans much more this way. If I saw it again on tap or in the bottle, I'd have another for sure."
"Tastes like a thin stout with an extra dollop of hop oils. The taste is a continuation of the burnt flavor. Close to being a one-trick pony due to the large amount of black patent malt. There may be hop but it is lost. The flavor is short-lived after the swallow."
"D: Solid. Goes down pretty quickly."
"D: Really nice drinker and it cannot be beaten for the price. Probably the most balanced example of the style out there."
"Pours black with a finger of quickly dying head. Aroma is hop forward with a citrus and floral mix. The flavor is toasted malt and a strong pine/floral hoppiness. A bit of a clash in flavors. The body is light and carbonation is a bit too high. Overall this is a decent offering in the style, meaning an average beer overall."
"A very drinkable black IPA served from the bottle into a pint glass, not too hoppy, not to roasty, not too strong and not too malty. It's aroma is of pine and citrus, and the appearance is black. Moderate carbonation, and good balance. Very easy drinking beer."
"Drink is decent, not quite sessionable with the bitterness and coffee flavors lingering, but a decent dry finish and goes down well."
"Great drinkability. Smooth, great taste. Otter Creek isn't always the easiest to find, or cheapest to buy though."
"Great beer."
"This is a very flavorful and easy drinking beer at 6% abv. This is a very good Black IPA.. recommended."
"Overall, I like this style and I think it has a lot to offer. It doesn't compare to the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, or the Back in Black by 21st Amendment, both of which I was crazy about -- but it's a strong beer and one I'd buy again, especially to try on tap."
"Pours a beautiful ebony deep black body with no ruby highlights seen through the glas, solid even coating of tan head lacing as it dwindles down. Aromatics are nice, a combo of dark chocolate and subtle herbal/citric hop attacks colliding into an almost chocolate mint/pine combination. Mike the brewmaster formerly of DFH Rehoboth location, knows how to combine the dark malts in the hops this version is really nice. Strong bitter dark chocolate with herbal/mint/citric/pine flavored hops going on, finishes nice and dry a very well meshed combination of different flavors. The best Otter Creek offering I've had in quite some time, I'm looking forward to trying their Kolsch this spring. Medium bodied smooth carbonation, I noticed a good amount of yeast sediment. Natural bottle conditioned beer gives this beer an edge. Drinkability is very nice a sessionable hop head satisfying, cool weather dark beer that I really enjoyed. Will get a whole sixer if I see it out and about."
"This was a decent beer, nothing too impressive but the flavor was good and was relatively easy to drink."
"Drinkability is good, enjoying this one bunches. Haven't been overly impressed with this brewery before but find this brew very enjoyable. Light easy drinking plus roasted malty and hoppy all at the same time."
"Always loved this local brewery but the release of this one slipped right past me, time to buy a case and catch up! Pours a very dark brown (not quite black) with great head to it. Tons of lacing left on the glass.. glorious. Nice roasty/hoppy aroma to it. Taste is medium bodied and full of flavor, but is well balanced and smooth. This beer goes down way too easy and combined the best parts of an IPA and a brown ale. Super drinkable, delicious, and only $13.99 for a 12 pack? How can you go wrong, pick some up you won't be disappointed"
"Drinkability- i could drink this all night. hoppy enough to satisfy my IPA need and warm and malty to keep me intrigued and wanting more."
"D - Dangerously drinkable but flavorful enough that I made sure to enjoy each sip."
"This is a good beer. Again, I'm not sure how everyone's getting such a great pour, but for me everything else is solid."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, pine like hops and roasty coffee, quite porter like. In the taste, pine hops and coffee like roast in the end. A small hop bit e and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, fresh hop and small roast in the aftertaste. Nice, but it is like a hoppy porter. I would consider it more a porter across the board, although, I enjoy it."
"More, please."
"Drinkability is fairly high for a black IPA, as this is a nice balance between malty and hoppy, giving it a even-keeled presence. One could easily see oneself imbibing a few after a nice winter activity like snowshoeing or skiing."
"Notes: This beer has totally changed my perception of what the new Black IPA style can be. It isn't just another insanely hoppy porter, like most breweries are churning out these days. It seems more in the vein of a tasty, drinkable IPA that makes good use of some subtle roasted malt flavors. A very good beer. This will become a regular in my fridge."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Darkest of browns with an off white head and some lacework gracing the glass. Aroma is certainly hoppy, with floral, pine and citrus notes. In the flavor department, this is a hop forward ale. Nice bitterness, and the dark roasted malt is a bit overpowered by the hops. Some char in the background even alittle peaty. I enjoy this semi-new style of beer, and Alpine Black is a good example of such. If you closed your eyes and drank this you would almost assume its a standard IPA, but then the roasted flavor comes in. Good stuff."
"Very nice beer but nothing to write home about. I would work on the hop profile primarily - this pales (hah) in comparison to the Hill Farmstead James for example..."
"Taste-Roasted mallt, citrus zest, coffee, nice lingering hop bite. Decently balanced and pretty drinkable. a nice example of the style."
"the ABV is just right. Very, very drinkable."
"this doesn't touch Sublimely Self Righteous, which is still the high water mark for the style imo, but its a quality offering from the sometimes overlooked Otter Creek"
"What a pleasant surprise. Picked up a 6 pack to try something new and have since purchased every time I needed to replenish the fridge. Pours a dark almost Stoutlike color with a fantastic aroma. Nice citrus/piney scent with a finger width mocha head. Very pleasant taste and hop linger. Could have slightly more ABV but that is the only complaint. A great seasonal beer which I would love to see sold year round! Congrats Otter Creek!"
"M - Medium body. Somewhat silky and smooth. Lightly carbonated."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 337111710. Sampled on December 27, 2010. It pours a handsome dark brown with mahogany hues when held to the light and a long-lasting half-inch foamy beige head. There is a notable pine sap hoppiness in the aroma. The texture is medium to heavy and on the chewy side. There are many wonderful hoppy sensations mingling together in the taste but never too overpowering. This is very nice."
"O: Not bad, but nothing to write home about. This doesn't do it for me as a black IPA however, and I'd seek others out before this. Just OK."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted malt scent along with a bitter, citrus hop nose. It's unlike most black IPA's that are just black in color. This actually has an authentic roasted/black malt character. The taste is good as well. It has a fresh citrus hop flavor that melds well with black and roasted malts. The hop flavor is really well pronounced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a damn good black IPA. It's bitter and roasted with lots of both malt and hop character."
"Drinkability....way up there. It brings that refreshing hops zip,some sense of substance,some complexity,yet is not overbearing or boozy. Black IPA is a format where a brewer can add dimensions to a hop forward beer and Otter Creek did so rather neatly. Compared to some one-trick grapefruit bombs,here's big hops in a context,and it keeps it's identity as beer."
" Seems just right for the holiday season and 'ol Black Peter."
"This is a good one for sure. Very nice."
"Smell has dark malt, some hops. Alpine BIPAs taste contains coffee, more dark malt, hops and pine. Its MF and carbonation level is medium. Drinkability is pretty good for the style. This is a solid beer from Otter Creek."
"This is the best Otter Creek I have tried."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body feel to it with a crisp but smooth presence. Overall, this beer, IMO, has really hit the nail on the head with what this style is all about."
"Very easy to drink. The roasted character in the nose and taste may tell your brain that this one is heavier than it is but it ends up being pretty light. That being said the flavors seem to fade pretty quickly. With each successive sip they run together and nothing ends up standing out."
"A dark opaque black color with a solid tan colored head with plenty of lacing. The aroma says skunk cabbage herbal hops and yeast. The flavor brings a beautiful blend of charred oak and lemon hop malt. It's medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and brings the same skunky ale sort of flavor that seemed evident in the aroma. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Good stuff."
"lightly carbonated, somewhat thick in the mouth but easy to drink"
"1292"
"Medium body with decent carbonation. I liked this as it wasn't extreme. Some simplicity aided in drinkability. A harder style to session, in my opinion, but this would be the one to buy if that were the case."
"D-- extremely easy to drink. As I hemmed and hawed I didn't realize I sucked it down quick."
"Drinkability is good for the taste to price ratio. 8.99 a sixer, and still pretty good taste. Low abv allows more consumption if you feel like it."
"Low hop bitterness considering (60 ibu's) well balanced sweetness in the middle and a very earthy, roasty finish."
"D - fantastic blend of strong flavors, yet absurdly easy to drink. Not to mention affordable. Might be my new favorite session beer...and I don't even like IPAs."
"It's a drinkable beer a nice twist on an IPA I'm impressed with it I'd buy it again."
"Its body is mild but the mouth is smooth and its taste is full of flavor making it easy to drink"
"This was nice and I think that Otter Creek really hit the nail on the head for this style, with the roast and sweetness taking the more aggressive edges off the hop profile and really melding this into a flavorful and mellow affair. Really well done new seasonal here that I will continue to come back to. Kudos to Otter Creek!"
"Drink it extremely fresh or you will lose out on the hop character is my guess."
"Worth a try."
"D - I could drink these all night. A good take on the style. At around $1.30 per bottle, this is a boon to the relatively young Black IPA market, which is usually fairly expensive and exclusive."
"Good stuff. When I think of Otter Creek hops don't immediately come to mind but they did a good job with this one."
"D: Highly drinkable, the ABV is on the lower range and this Black IPA goes down nice and smooth. This is a great beer from a great brewery. If you ever find yourself in VT definitely make a stop at Otter Creek!"
"D: The beer is very drinkable; I could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"Pretty good overall but since it's more of a hoppy porter, it doesn't quite whet my appetite for a CDA/Black IPA. Not bad for what it is but I have to dock it a bit for style."
"Strong hop, but very smooth and really drinkable. Quite tasty to boot."
"D-well its not that bad but i kinda want it be gone already. its just not a beer i can drink a lot of. as i will put it...it tastes weird..."
"Taste was also quite hoppy and a bit grainy but nice. Lots of that pine resin flavor along with a good malty backbone. Really solid and very drinkable."
"Nice and smooth a good beer to drink anytime"
"Homerun!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, dark brown as it pours, once in the glass it is pitch black. Weak head but it sticks around, the aroma is all hops and pine. Good lacing, taste is an unique blend of malts and hops. I expected the taste to be more on the hoppy side considering the aroma was full of pine/hops, but it is a smooth blend with the malty flavor. Nice lacing and mouthfeel is very silky and smooth. Delicious and unique beer. Definitely worth trying... one of the better brews from Otter Creek."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer with great play between the malts and hops. It also seems appropriate as a winter release."
"Black body with deep red edges when held up to the light. Off white two finger frothy fluffy head. This fades to a nice white cap, big and small bubbles. Smells of one or two American citrus hops, chinook and maybe Columbus but it's just a guess. Taste is quite complex. Citrus, clean hop bitterness, roasted malt, piney notes,'tobacco, leather, black tea. Quite bubbly and prickly going down. Very balanced even though it feels thin bodied. I'd definitely pick this up again. Give it a try."
"D - very good drinkability, all around very good as well."
"Relatively light drinking, as are most Otter Creek beers. I like this quite a bit, and it's far easier to drink than a lot of other examples of black IPAs. Nothing to intense here, and not a crazy ABV."
"D: Out of the blue comes another American black IPA, this time from Otter Creek. Thankfully, it's well-balanced, smooth and tasty. At 6% ABV, this is a good, cold weather IPA with the hybrid, bitter malt roast to satisfy those searching for the warmth of their porters and stouts. Well executed and I'd grab it up again this season."
"D- surprised by how much it seemed like an IPA other than appearance and finish. An enjoyable beer and I would buy more."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time."
"The jury's still out on the Black IPA style, not sure I even like it myself. Still, there's no denying this is a wonderfully crafted version; the best of the style I've had yet."
"D - Again, my first endeavor into the black IPA world, small as it may be, and I am very impressed. Only have one bottle of this as a sample from my favorite beer store, but after this one I am thinking I should have just bought a sixer..."
"Final Thoughts- An interesting combination of styles that I believe deserves a spot in the winter lineup."
"12oz bottle no visible Freshness Date. This is my first Black IPA and I'm not quite sure what I'm in store for. Pours a nice black color with a medium sized head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing. Nice piney hop aroma. Some mocha as well. The taste is a nice blend of mocha and the pine flavor of the hops. Not as big a hop flavor as indicated by the smell. Roasted malts flavors at the end. A good introduction into this style of beer. I'm hoping this shows up in one of their mix 12 packs. Might seek out a 6 pack of it on it's own though."
"Pours a black color, not opaque by any means, a good sized brownish head sits atop. Hop forward nose, roasty malt takes a back seat. Big hop driven flavor, excellent balance. Medium bodied, well carbonated and very easy to drink. Otter Creek continues to impress with their new offerings."
"Melange of dark malt, orangy, and herbal aroma is nice but could use more hop aroma to move it into the IPA realm. Sweet up front with chocolate, prune, orange, and cattail like herbal flavor that yeilds to elongated piney hop flavor and some bitterness. Well crafted and way too easy to drink. Like a winter warmer but uses hops instead of spices - although I would like to see it tipped more to the IPA side with more hop aroma and flavor - I like it and will buy more."
"Drinkability: Very surprised by this offering, coming out of the gate and being a seasonal, Otter Creek did a splendid job of blending together a perfectly flavorful IPA with the big malt properties that alot of us crave during the colder months. Black IPA's are getting pretty popular in the past year and OC nailed this one pretty nicely. At 6% ABV, this one is a fairly easy sipper and pretty interesting to keep around on a colder night. A great attempt at a style that will get more popular as the years go by."
"D - Reasonably drinkable. Enjoyed it, but nothing I will be craving in the future."
"Mouthfeel is full and rich and creamy, very satisfying. Overall seems more IPA than black, but a very tasty and drinkable beer. Seems like most Cascadian Darks are big and robust, whereas this one is a more quaffable version."
"My overall impression with Otter Creek is mixed. Like other Vermont based breweries it's either hit or miss. This is a hit for sure. The flavor is complex but not so much so you can't hone in. The biggest compliment I can give is that you can have several servings in a sitting and it doesn't become too much, as is the case with a lot of ipa's. I am interested in trying out some more black ipa's to see how this compares but I was indeed pleasantly suprised!"
