"one of my favorite holiday ales. loses the overwhelming spice of others, and instead it's hoppy and toasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hoppy smell explodes onto the scene, and then is followed by a roasted character of coffee and chocolate; in the very least a roasted something. The hops are bright and add that great citrus and bitterness to the mix. I really like this style. I would get this again."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Snow Day is a very deep brown-red color with a thick, light mocha colored, pillowy head. The nose is a mixture of citrusy, spicy hops and a toasty malty profile. Flavor is what you might expect based on the smell; west coast hops - grapefruit and pine resin - melded with a roasty, toasty, slightly nutty, biscuity malt taste. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an inactive, slightly creamy carbonation. Overall, definitely a beer I could curl up with on a cold winter's night, or anytime for that matter - good one by NB"

""

"O - Overall, This was probably the only good beer that I drank last night. If New Belgium could fix the odd off-putting watery flavor and up the body, This would be a real winner in a lot of people's eyes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a decent black ale but I will stick with others I enjoy more."
""
"Not particularly smooth but not a rough beer to drink by any means. Drying throughout. Watery feel with a soft effervescence. You could easily partake of several of these without incident but it isn't compelling with this weak body."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall: a pleasantly hoppy black PA. More drinkable than it might be if it were actually an IPA."
""

"Love this beer!! Really sad that soon it won't be available. Nice spicy hops in the nose. Hops up front in the flavor as well, that give way to the dark malts. What is that ""Midnight Wheat""? Need to find another beer with that to help nail down the flavor. The body is not heavy, good mouth feel. Looks like a ""Coke"" with much smaller bubbles. Nice Lace. For me, it's a perfect balance. Just the right amount of assertive hops, and a good combination, the Centennial/Cascade and Styrian Goldings and dark malts. Finish is dry and crispy. I think I would drink this in the summer too. Never reviewed a beer before. Hope I don't sound noobish."

"Appearance is opaque black, cola colored against the light. Head is decent in size with small bubbles, grey in color. It really looks like a well carbed Old Ale. Lacing is good. Aroma has slight Belgian malt sweetness with floral, somewhat grassy hops, and some baker's chocolate. The chocolate comes through in flavor right away, slightly bitter, followed by earthy barkish metal. The bitter hoppiness is earthy as well. I'm guessing English hops such as fuggles are used for bitterness. Feel tends slightly toward watery and finishes dry. I would never put this in the same category as Sublimely Self Righteous or other Black IPAs, but its definitely not a winter warmer, considering its formidable use of hops. This reminded me a bit of 1554 but a bit brighter. I'd have one again. Which is good considering I got a variety 12 pack with three more left."
"Overall: This is a very drinkable beer, with some good winter flavors, being mainly the evergreen aroma and taste. I enjoy this beer when outside in the winter or sitting next to a fire with the Christmas tree providing the ambiance to go with the taste."
"The body is moderate but well carbonated. Not overly but does enhance the astringent characters. Overall more of a different style of beer, but as a black IPA it doesnt quite fit."
"Dark brown, creamy khaki head - beautiful looking beer. Big hop-derived spiciness on the nose transitioning to a more malt-centric body. Roasted nuts, cola, carob, toffee, weak diner coffee, sourdough. Hop bitterness is balanced evenly. Pithy citrus with a punch of earthy spice describes the hop flavor. A nice beer to throw back on a late winter afternoon (with snow in the forecast). I was expecting something more akin to a Black IPA/CDA, instead this is more like a well-hopped American Brown."

"O – This is a decent black ale. It’s pretty tasty but the flavors seem a bit weak (as in neither strongly malty or hoppy) and not very well-blended. The malty and the hoppy parts just seem sort of separated. Nevertheless, this is an easy drinker and a nice, different winter beer."
"Our overall impression is that it's very pungent and overcooked."

"Mouthfeel - Astringent. Somewhat thin mouthfinish, but a light creaminess in the front. Sharp."
""
""
""
""
"O=An enjoyable beer that I might try again...I would never have guessed that this was supposed to be similar to an IPA, as the hops were relatively minimal. More similar to a red ale than a black ale."
""
""
"O: Overall, another good beer from New Belgium, a great package of flavors with a relatively decent price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: Pleasant and a good shot at a hoppy winter brown/black IPA."
""
"Has somewhat of a burnt taste to begin, but after a few more sips the flavour does set it i get the pine taste a hint of bitter, do not taste any cocoa flavor. Nice head, poured into tall glass traps a lot of smell in and makes taste stand out. Very easy to drink, was not used to the taste to start, but does grow on you very well."
""
""
""
""
"A very well done ABA. While there are definitely more bold, flavorful examples of the style, this has a complex, really enjoyable flavor profile while still being easy drinking."

"Frist love the picture on the bottle, it just sets up wat the beer is all about. The beer is black/dark brown with ruby light through the bottem and a nice foam white maybe off white head. The smell is of hops and coco maybe fruit of some kind, smells really good. The taste is even better u get the hops for sure but not crazy u get a little roasted choclate really kind of simple but the beer just taste so good. The mouthfeel is maybe the only weak point of the beer it has a thin body with a medium body on the swallow, but im not gonna fault this beer at all for a small thing to me like mouthfeel. Overall all this beer is great I would deff say try this if u like hops but like somthing a little darker for the winter. Every beer i have had from there winter folly pack has been awsome go get one."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably."
"Overall, it's not awful, and it's closer to good than it is to bad. I think black ales are an acquired taste and feel and all I can say is I'm working on it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured out clear black, with a slight brownish off white frothy pillowy head. Smells toasted with a sweat caramel aroma with some hops in the background. Taste follows the nose with more hops present (citrus flavored) but they still follow the nice toasted flavor. It drinks crisp with a medium soft pillowy mouth feel. This is nice and refreshing on a cold winters day. Its a little different then the norm and makes me think twice every time I take a sip. Lovely if you want to try something different, so if your in the mood try one, cheers!"
"First thing I noticed was the aroma. Sweet and citrusy, not sure what this finishing hop is but I like the fragrance alot. Dark clear garnet color, fluffy tan head that sustains. Woodsy, pine, bitter aftertaste. Decent hop punch. Slight citrus background. Sort of a dry sweetness too. Smooth, low carbonation. Not what I was expecting, taste or style wise. Quite good and an interesting change of pace for a winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer. I wasn't even sure of what this style was, but that's okay. I approached this one with no misconceptions or prejudices. I'd gladly have this again."
""
"Quite tasty, nice complexity, could be bigger in body and flavour but a really nice drinkable winter ale. A bit on the bitter side."
"Overall - There are some good flavors here, but at times the combination almost gives a cough syrup kind of flavor, including the slight alcohol warmth - sorta nyquil-ish. I like alot of the flavors I've mentioned above but here they don't seem to mesh all that well. Try this one for yourself, it's just not my cup of tea...er uh glass of beer."
""
"A boatload of hops to go along with the chocolate caramel malt flavors. Has a nice roasted taste and a good balance."
""
""
"overall- good beer but nothing special. worth the $8.50 i paid for the six pack to try but don't think i will be revisiting it anytime soon"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Snowday pours a black color with a nice frothy head. There was smokey malty aroma. The taste had a mellow smokey malty backbone, with hints of hops near the end of each sip. Good full flavor, and great to drink on a winters night. Overall a solid, and enjoyable good quality beer."
""
"overall, this is very decent, particularly for a six pack one can find at the local 7-11. reminds me of my now-gone christmas tree. not my preferred, but for the selection available at the store, it was probably the best pick."
""
"Not what I expected from a winter brew. First taste caught me off guard. This beer at first sort of seems like a wheat beer, there's that classic wheat flavor and a sort of earthy spiciness. The beer follows up with a nice roasted caramel malt and even a touch of a roasted flavor. But the focus of the beer is the hops. It drinks closer to IPA then anything. A ton of floral notes and a nice fresh citrus. A really choppy aftertaste and feel. Not bitter for a hopped up beer. I found the feel to be a tad thin and sort of spicy. A great winter beer that I think is closest to SN celebration ale."

"Overall- lives up to it's name, this robust brew is meant for staying indoors when the snow is out"
""
"Overall - A good little beer that in my opinion, is a few tweaks away from being very, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass the color is nearly black with almost no light penetration. Head was about a finger of beige with fairly nice lacing as it dissipated slowly. The smell was not what I expected. Very hoppy but lacking the maltiness portrayed by the color and head. The beer has a nice feel in the mouth with a crisp hoppy finish. Leaves a slightly flowery citric aftertaste. Almost like grapefruit. The beer is surprisingly light and drinkable considering its dark color. Overall another excellent product by New Belgium."
"Taste-Dark toasted wheat or malt, citric piney hops, subtle caramel, and a soft underlying roastiness that melds well with the hops all the wat to the finish. Subtle, tasty, and well-balanced. Good for after snow-shoveling, or just watching the snow fall."
""
""
""

""

""

"A nice surprise in a winter ale. Nice malty flavor with plenty of hop finish for balance. Very drinkable. I would like to have seen a little more body in the head. My only complaint is the smell was a little metallic. Overall this is a great beer to drink while grilling on the deck on a cold day."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, with a big frothy head, and some nice lacing. Nose is roasted malt tones with nuts, sweet and savory. Roasted malt with bitter notes and bittersweet components enhanced with a bit of spice. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown amber with a finger of light tan head with great retention and lacing. Nice aroma of piney hops, roasted malt, somewhat earthy with a hint of holiday spices. Interesting, unexpected flavor dominated by piney and grassy hops, light toasted malt. Flavor is deceptively light, but displays a fairly complex range of herbal and grassy hop flavors with a light sweet malt base. Medium bodied with a decent creaminess. This is a different approach to an winter ale leaning towards herbal hop flavors. I liked this quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
"Pours pitch black, white foam, little bubbles. Strong pine aroma. Tree like. Rich malt open then a pleasant light layer of hops. Smooth finish. The bittering contributes but in a nice supporting way. Some coffee chocolate malt taste. Very nicely balanced and behaved black ale."

"This is one of the better winter ales I've had recently, and it is easy to drink, but it is lacking on characteristics that could otherwise truly excite me about it. The coffee/pepper combo is a neat twist on the style, but I do wish it would be thicker, as I find no characteristic in a beer more comforting. Worth a try, especially with the holidays up and coming."
"A snow day on a day where I'm literally staying home because of a blizzard. I find the beer very enjoyable, the lightness and bitter flavors make it a great, ""sessionable"" beer. Will definitely have more often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A decent winter beer, the only real detraction is the lack of balance."
""
""
""
""
"O: kind of a unique brew, smoke flavor well balanced by hop profile, worth trying if you are into those tastes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"It still was not an over the top American style, but it was a lot closer, and the balance was very nice. I could have had a few, but they were a little pricey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not bad at all. Not quite as expected. At purchase I thought it would be more of a traditional winter warmer. After research I was expecting something a little hoppier. Maybe it suffered from travel/shelf time? Solid beer, just doesn't set itself apart from the recent glut of top tier black ales."
"O: A good beer overall and one of the better winter seasonals out there. It seems more like a hoppy brown ale than black ale, though. A nice beer to pick up in cheap 12-packs for the winter."
""
""
""
"Good brew overall. Try once."
""
"overall: Its pretty good, nothing that I would say go out and find, but one of New Belgium's better beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a beer I would purchase again if I can find a fresh(er) bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant seasonal brew. The ginger adds some holiday spice."
""
""
""
""
"O-for an black ale...its just okay. admittedly its not a style i love, but i still appreciate a good one when i experience it. the flavors here are all just pretty faint. there are no off flavors though. its at least one of the more drinkable black ales i've had. its just seems to lack really with the dark flavors or the hops. its boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A black ale trying to be an IPA, I'm not sure. And darker than black, which doesn't actually give any idea of snow, and but looks like beer, so that's ok. Smells dark, malty, sweet, and slightly floral, although not nose forward, that's for sure. Taste is malt sweet and light but clear hops and caramel and some chocolate and late coffee. Mouthfeel is busy and foamy and creamy and really quite good here. I don't drink much in the dark beer category, but this isn't too bad all considering. Although, at the end, I always want a clear, very bitter ale to follow."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: medium bodied, and well carbonated"
""
"The color when poured was a very dark amber with a reddish hue, on the verge of dark brown. There was very little foam, but, a lot of lace of the side of the glass. The smell had the aroma of mild piney hops and not much else. The taste and flavor was of piney hops and nothing else that I could taste. This ale just reminded me of another, mild, IPA. Not impressed with this ale. Just a palate full hops and bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"O:Smells rich and bold. Taste is good but plain. A blend with other malts would be better for the body and a balanced taste and finish."
""
"It's flat SNPA with roasted malt, sounds good but it's just not a winter beer. Bright hops, dark malt and wheat provide a twist to lighten it up and there's not enough bitterness to judge it as a black ipa. This is New Belgium stepping out of it's comfort zone, daring but this seasonal missed the mark."
""
"O: For the style, it feels like there is too light an amount of hop flavors. Enjoyable but nothing really stands out with this beer."
""
"Plentiful floral hop notes. Though cascade is noted on the label (in addition to other hops), this beer is pleasantly free of the sometimes overpowering grapefruit character that comes with it. The pleasant level of hop bitterness is balanced nicely with the rich-wheaty malt character. The nose is probably my favorite part of this beer and the taste has a tough time keeping up with it."
""
""
""
"It's pretty good, but I won't get a new 6-pack"
""
"Overall I thought that this was good beer and it was pretty good example of the style, it had very good balance all the way through that made this beer not overwhelming at any end of the spectrum. It had decent drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the flavors held my attention but one is good for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about the beer was the balance it really highlighted the flavor of this beer and it looked very good. What I liked the least about this beer was how similar it was to their Red Hoptober, the malt base tasted pretty much the same. but this one tasted a little less hoppier, but it smells just about the same. I would buy this beer when in the mood for the style, but as far as winter seasonal beers go I would rather have Sierra Nevada Celebration, I do recommend giving it a try though. All in all this beer was pretty solid with it's biggest strength being it's balance, good work guys, you sure know how to make some solid beers."
""
"A nice beer for a sunny winter day. Easy drinking and good bright and warm flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent, but I won't be seeking it out next Winter. There are plenty more seasonal releases from New Belgium that will end up in my stock though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While roasty & smooth with rough edges that have that characteristic wheated sweetness it just didn’t come together. Unfortunately, the flavor collapses as it warms. I went from liking this brew to disliking it to finding it ok. But it’s not one I’d have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a decent winter warmer selection, but not much bite or any characteristics that actually stand out. Even with all the different flavors, it is seemingly one note. Meh. I'm one and done with this one."
"O: Full bodied. Much better than other New Belgium beers."
"O - The new midnight wheat ingredient is intriguing. If the rest of New Belgium's stuff is this good, I'm excited."
""
""
"After earlier disappointments with some of New Belgium's seasonal ales, I wasn't expecting much out of this beer - but it is actually well crafted and a solid version of the style, though the roastiness I've come to expect is almost completely sacrificed to make way for the more subtle notes from the hops (which are show-cased very well I'll admit). Maybe more of an Autumn than a Winter ale, but tasty none-the-less."
""
""
"T: A moderate earthy hop bite upfront followed by some rye tasting malts and black pepper. A touch of malt sweetness towards the end with some earthy spice. An interesting beer but probably not something I'd do again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: New Belgium just keeps getting better. My first experience with Ranger and Fat Tire fell flat, but it’s been good ever since then – great, even. This is a lovely winter beer, one I couldn’t see myself getting tired of by the end of the six-pack."
""
"This is dark and almost porter-like. If you're a porter lover, this is a quality winter ale. I like it, but wish it were a bit more robust either in the sweet malts or the piney hops."
""
""
""
"This Black ale poured beautifully with a nice stout head and tons of lacing. Dark ruby to black it resembled a Porter in appearance. It smelled of hops which was not quite expected from the appearance, but the hops were slightly metallic. The taste was subtle, slight hops, slight chocolate malt but not as robust as other New Belgiums. Overall it was nice but not as good as anticipated."

"Poured this American Black Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a dark black color, produced an off white head, decent retention and left behind above average lacing. The aroma of this ale consisted of malted grain, caramel, and spicy hops. Medium in body, a foundation of toasted grain, floral hops, raisin and spices. Smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry. Nice session beer- Wouldnt mind having it around on a Snow Day."
"Overall – A solid beer. The dark coloring fools you into thinking about the normal chocolate/coffee note normally associated with a beer this dark. Due to the midnight wheat, these flavors are down played while the caramel notes come through. The hops are present but not overpowering. This is defiantly not a dark IPA which is a good thing."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. This beer should not be served cold. The flavors don't really come out when it is cold (even though it is for ""snow days""...). Nice pour with a decent amount of sandy colored head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves a thin film of head and Brussels lace up the side of the glass. Very malty aroma, some floral notes from the hops, but not very much. Root beer aroma, some coffee from the roasting and some grass from the hops. Tastes predominantly sweet with some bitterness on the back end, but not much. Definitely more of a dark ale than a winter IPA like some of the Pac NW winter beers. Well-carbonated and nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a very enjoyable beer and glad I got a sixer of it."

"The body was good, for a Winter warmer, far too full for a CDA. Drinkability was OK, I didn't mind the beer while I was having it, but it was forgotten as soon as it was finished. Overall, an OK beer, but not really one worth seeking out."

"Really great brew. I bet this would be fantastic as a double recipe and barell aged!"
""
""
""
""
"O - A really solid brew. The hop character and carbonation add a nice lightness to the heavy malt and dark fruit flavors."
""
""
"Nothing like dedicating a beer to getting 3 feet of snow: Fort Collins 2003, 37 inches. Here's to being snowed in and hopefully having enough beer to survive! Snow Day pulls it off with its inviting Winter Warmer toastiness and a slight warmth from the alcohol."
"While this did not strike me as the usual ""holiday"" beer, it was a pleasant one and good enought to drink year round. Maybe the mountain air of Ft. Collins has something to do with it. Or not..."
""
""
""
"O- This beer surprised me. A past its prime winter seasonal seemed worth a try, didn't realize it was a hoppy black ale. Even with the age the hops are still refreshing and the overall impression comes through. Looking forward to trying it fresh next winter."

"Notes: Not a huge fan of the style (I enjoy it now and then but I never really search them out). Decent but there are just points where I don't think all the flavors meld well. The fruity hops just don't come out as much in the taste."
""
"This is a delicious winter beer, perfectly balanced. I wish this was a year round serving."
"This is a good brew. It has strong hop cone flavor. It is fairly malty, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a very nice black color with a bit of nice head and a bit of nice lacing throughout. Nice deep roasted malt scents and a nice roasted malt flavor, with a nice bitter slight-citrus hop finish at the end. Goes down quite smoothly, a nice roasty winter ale to keep you warm."
""
"Black ales are the new winter ales?? Hey, you know, I can deal with that. Love the nose on this one. Flavor is bringing the black ale characteristics, but in what I would genuinely have to classify as a mass produced kind of way. But that doesn't really matter. This is something you could drink and enjoy en masse or just to try it. I wouldn't mind a few more of these."
""
""
""
"O- The great fresh NW coast hops are big and dark but this beer is still very sessionable, even at over 6 %."
""
"O: Really good Winter Ale – but more like a mild black IPA."
"Beer is medium in body and the flavor disappoints mildly. It is a fine beer but not my favorite. The hops are piny and earthy with an odd finish. Oh well it is fine but not my thing."
"Despite the somewhat harsh burn, I liked this beer. It's tasty, and very aromatic."
""
"4.15/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just something not right about the taste that kind of ruins it for me. Still a very good beer, just needs some tinkering to be excellent."
"Cheers to Illudium for the sample!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A strange winter ale, with hops being the primary focus. The hop/malt combination is an odd one, almost polar opposites in a way, with bright citrus hoppiness intermixed with roasty malt flavorings. It's interesting, to say the least, even if it doesn't necessarily makes it case into 'great beer' territory."
"Very interresting taste, and the beer grows on you as more you drink."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid ABA to drink for a whole evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Overall, its almost past its expiration but still nice and creamy with some roasty chocolate and more malty notes. Dont really get the wheat base."
""
""
"A very easy drinking black American pale ale. I would quaff this on the beach at A-basin during a break from skiing. An enjoyable seasonal release from my friends at New Belgium!"

"Single finger head with tons of lace on a clear, very deep amber body. The aroma is very hoppy, surprisingly so, witha light roasted malt background. Strong musty and earthy hop flavor. Roasted malt and light coffee notes as well. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. One of the hopper and darker winter ales I have had. Almost light a light thin black IPA."

"Deep dark brown with a nice beige head.aroma is pine and citrus hops with a little bit of an herbal note.Flavor is chocolate, grainy malt, sweet dark caramel, some interesting grainy roast notes, citrus, planty and spicy hops. Palate is light to medium bodied."
"A nice winter brew. Easy drinking despite the alcohol that warms the belly against the cold."

"Overall I guess it's a pretty decent beer, I don't know what makes it specifically winter here. A pretty easy drinking darker ale in my opinion."

"Taste follows the aroma with a smooth and easy drinking delivery. Bit of caramel and chocolate up front and with a moderate feel, finishing with some hop spice but without any real bitterness. Rather light on the palate for a Black IPA but then I find it more balanced than most of the ilk. Hoppy enough in the aroma but not overly bitter, and yet not too malty either making for a quaffable drink."
""
"Winter seasonals are not my favourite of the seasonal varietals, so I won't let that bias me TOO much. This is a well made beer. I would say it's better as a winter seasonal than as a black ale (in my imaginings of the respective categories, anyway). Certainly check it out if you like winter brews or if it happens to be cheap, but don't go out of your way."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a dark brown color. There was a bit of a frothy tan head on it that lasts a little while and leaves some lacing. The nose is good. Some roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Maybe some piney hops also. The taste is good. Some roasted coffee, chocolate and caramel. Balanced with some piney hops. No real sweetness, and just a bit bitter. Pretty decent winter beer."
""
"D ~ Between a Brown Ale & an ABA, this is A nice addition to the NB seasonal lineup. Difficult to categorize, but tasty on cold nights."
""
"Overall: This is not a particularly warming beer, despite the reasonable ABV. I think that they could’ve safely pushed the ABV even up to 9% or so without doing any harm to the characteristics of the beer. Sipping it further, the hops start to dominate a bit, so perhaps the malt could’ve been left a bit more room to breathe. Anyway, it’s an interesting enough take on a Winter Ale, with clear influences both from Belgium and the hop-friendly US brewing scene."

"This beer is a bit stronger than I expected, because it drinks so light and quaffable. It reminds me of a little, black IPA, so really a black Pale Ale , though really it reminds me of a hoppy Porter; it sort of reminds me of Avery New World Porter, though this isn’t quite as roasted as that beer. The burnt note that this beer has seems quite distinct compared to what is usually found in a roasted beer and it has me wondering if the distinctness is because this beer’s roast character comes from the roasted Midnight wheat. Not a bad beer, I think I prefer 2° Below Winter Ale quite a bit more than this one though; Snow day has the roast and hop character clashing enough in the finish to add a touch of harshness (and this is accentuated a bit by some warmth from the alcohol."

"This is a big heavy beer and just tastes great."
"I enjoyed this. I would have liked to have ultimately felt a bit more of a malt presence in the aroma (despite how much I liked those hops in the nose) but this was well balanced flavor-wise and the easygoing body just added to my overall enjoyment of this. I’m not sure that I would automatically associate Black Ales with a wintertime seasonal, but it had enough of a dark roasty presence to keep this in line with cold temperature drinking."

"D: Not a bad winter ale. Little more hoppy than I was expecting. Not my favorite from New Belgium but not bad."
"D: A bit of a mutt in terms of style, but it's an enjoyable beer that brings a little of everything to the table. A pleasant drinking winter seasonal from New Belgium."
"Another nice experimental ale from a good brewery, though I am not familiar with the ""American Black ale"" style. I'll have to try a few others before I pass judgement on the style."

"D: This was a nice hoppy beer with great grapefruit character in the scent and taste. The body was good too, and the alcohol wasn't noticeable, so it was easy to drink. Not a revolutionary brew, but it was fully enjoyable and a good change of pace from most holiday beers."

"Pours a deep brown with a small tan head. Pours like cola. Smells of caramel, roasted malts, and some hops. Toffee, roasted malts, some spice, and hops are on the palate. Very session able dark ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is a solid one."

"Thanks to John my brother in law for the sample."

"Overall eh not bad but not what I was expecting I guess and the fact good is gone guess I will be rating more stuff average. Which is what this is really an average brew, not something I would choose to be snowed in with give me a big brew for the snow."

"Up until tonight, I thought the concept of an American Black was weird and awkward. Too much one way or the other and you get ""just awkward"" My few bad experiences with this style reinforced that opinion. I honestly think this is what the style was meant to be. New Belgium has achieved the tricky balance that this style requires. I will definitely be getting this again in two years (N.B. rotates their seasonals every other year)"

"D: not a year round beer by any chance. But a welcome friend on these ""cold"" South Carolina nights."
"The winter seasonal from New Belgium and I absolutely love this beer. Bought a 12 pack for about $13.99. Pours a jet black with a slightly reddish tinge to it, nice fluffy white head. Taste is medium bodied, malts hit you upfront, some caramel and smokiness, followed by a nick smack of hops on the finish. Pretty complex flavors but it goes together well. I was really impressed by this beer and makes for a great winter beer, highly recommended."
"Snow day has to be one of the most amazing winter ales. This beer can be described as a black IPA. It has a dark characteristics similar to a stout but nowhere near the thickness. The head to this brew is a nice off white color. it floats lightly on top and makes for an amazing lacing.Due to the lacin you can see every sip you take on the side of the glass. The beer brings forth tastes of coffee, with an IPA hoppy slap to the face at the end. delicious... and the winter flavors are almost perfectly balanced with the hops in the after taste."
""
""
"O: Ok but a bit too toasted for me, strange combo/blend."
""
""
"Fruity, citrusy, aroma. Definitely had that hops bitter bite to it, but pretty mild overall. Average mouth feel. I just had Widmer's BRRR a week before this and I thought of Snow Day as a milder 'not quite as good BRRR'."
"Me, I just like it. This 6-pack went down with no problem. I'll probably do some more before it's gone. But, it won't make me miss the snow."
"Overall a solid black IPA but not exceptional."

"Clean, dry, nice malt presence with a noticeably hoppy finish. Probably gonna be revisiting this."

"Poured this brew from a 12 oz bottle into my tulip glass. A dense, foamy head exudes hops, cocoa and spices. The first sip is a huge surprise, as it tastes like a combination of a brown IPA mixed with an old style black ale. Of all of the winter warmers I've tried, this would have to be my favorite. The smell and taste alone vault this beer into the above average category, and the added touches of spicy carbonation and a non-invasive head push it even higher in my book. I reserve my 5 star ratings for the best of the best (quality quads, trippels and imperial stouts) but as far as ordinary beer goes... this is a REAL winner."
""
""
"I prefer my winter beer to have more malt, but I like it."
""
"A very drinkable winter ale. I would have this again, and I hope itis around next winter as well."
"Pours out an impressive dark mahogany color with a tan head. There was something on the bottle about, midnight wheat malts. I have to say it looks pretty cool. Anyway, big bold hoppy smell, with a hint of sweet toasty malts. Also getting some big coriander like smells, I believe from some of the those hops. Almost a peppery, coriander-like smell, but not in a white ale sort of of way. It's weird. I have smelled it in other hoppy beers, is it the Goldings? Anyway, the taste is actually pretty toasty at first, some faint dark chocolate taste, followed up with a citric hop twang, and some of those spicey, coriander style hops. I mean, maybe it is their strain of yeast, they do call themselves New Belgium Brewing. The mouthfeel is fairly carbonated and not extremely smooth. I have had other beers I would put in the American Black Ale category but this one reminds me more of a dark, hoppy wheat beer. Overall a nice brew and I will try to grab another six pack this season."

"Flavorful and interesting session Winter Ale."

"New Belgium Brewing Company seems to be with us on this, with the newest release in a cycling seasonal line up, Snow Day. This brew pours a very deep, dark brown, with flashes of ruby, all contained under a thin, small-bubbled head which provides a good lacing throughout. Always adventurous, New Belgium incorporates a new brewing malt, Midnight Wheat, which leads to some caramel and chocolate in the nose, as well as less than subtle hop tones. A medium to light body is rounded out with average carbonation. A roasty-toasty flavor meets the pallet, with the chocolate again appearing before hops come in to steal the show and linger in the finish. At a less than modest 6.2%, this American Black Ale is tasty as a winter warmer, and even better on a cold snowy day."
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable. A ""light"" and hoppy dark beer that is pretty well balanced, excellent for drinking a few in the winter. I'm usually not too crazy about extremely roasty beers so this was perfect for me."
""
"Pours a dark brown that looks almost black when not held up to the light. Head is off white, thick, and leaves lots of lacing. Nose is deceptively full of hops. Taste is grassy and citrusy hops up front with a prevalent roasty and chocolaty backbone. Mouthfeel is lighter than one would think but fits the style. Ironically I was in the mood for something hoppy but decided to go with a seasonal since there's a limited window, I was pleasantly surprised to find I had gotten the best of both worlds."
""
""
""
"Notes: While I enjoyed this beer, I'm a bit ambivalent about my overall impression. It's kind of watery, but I found myself quaffing this with continued interest. It's bitter, but malty flavors seem almost non-existent. It's certainly worth a try. Who knows? You might find yourself wondering, and drinking, and wondering some more..."
"O- Good winter ale. This one is a perfect beer for a hophead or for someone that is building up their hop palate. Great balance of flavors and very enjoyable."
""
"O-nice flavors come through with a smell that changes over time leading to a little complexity in this that I didn't expect"
"But it's solid, and given its decent ABV, more than likely a fine, warming beer on those snowy days. I doubt I'd ever turn one down."
"Having grown up in Las Vegas and Phoenix, I’ve never experienced a snow day, but this’ll do just fine. A bold, hoppy dark ale that’s almost roasty enough to be a black IPA."
""
""

"O- Very impressive. Tastes like chewing on fresh hops. Props to New Belgium for a nice holiday surprise."
""
""
""
"note: I dont find any 2 below this year, I pray this is not the replacment!?"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 02/26/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a huge 2-3 finger dense light khaki head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap eventually. Some nice thick lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, grapefruit, pine, and spiciness. Damn nice balanced aromas here; definitely hoppy, but they have a nice roasted malt backbone as well. Taste of big orange rind, grapefruit, pine, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, and light chocolate. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, pine, caramel, and spices on the finish for a bit. Super hoppy in the taste, making the roasted malts a bit invisible. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily at 6.2%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish present. Overall this is a damn nice black IPA. I was hoping for more roasted malt presence in the taste. I would have this again."

"overall...i could see where this might be easily disliked, or easily admired. i lean strongly toward the latter just for the fact that i've been running into this style a lot as of late and this one rubs me the right way for some reason. it has that ""drink me by the fire and watch some bowl games"" aura to it. ok i will then..."
""
"This is an excellent take on a Black Ale. Well balanced yet has some exceptional complexity."
""
"No coffee flavors, but I can pick up some roasted malt flavors."
"Thick head, dark red, slight bitter taste with a hoppy after taste. Find it has a piney smell, a little burn, but over all desert winter beer. Half way thru my beer, the head was still present. After taste is bitter in the mouth, smooth yet dry. Its a cold night here so it went well with dinner. The caramel hint has a unique catch while sitting back."
""
"I am not the biggest fan of the black/cascadian/american black ales or whatever you want to call them. But I approach them with an open mind. The aroma of this brew fails in all departments whether you consider it a winter ale/warmer or a black ale. The nose is quite unpleasant and unfitting of any style of beer. The taste is somewhat fitting for the black ale style but doesnt fully come together for me. This brew is medium to light bodied, favoring a bit to the medium side and it has a moderate level of carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well integrated but overall this is not something I would enjoy having more than a sample of. Heath, I appreciate of the opportunity to try this but it just wasnt for me."

"Overall (3.5): A decent black IPA when I was expecting a winter warmer. Spicy enough to be mistaken for a warmer if it weren't for the resinous hops. A decent winter beer, but that's not a high standard outside of Belgium imo."
""
""
""
"12 oz single from Fred Meyer, N.Salem store. $1.75 Dark smokey brown beer with a nice sized creamy thick tan head. Nice hoppy aromas..citric/resiny..seems fresh..some coffee/chocolate in the background Taste is somewhat more balanced towards the caramel maltiness than the aroma..but the hops are certainlly alive! Good solid beer on the palate..semi dry finish. Overall a nice CDA but not top notch"
"edit: Tempted to up the overall score to 3.5, but I wont, due to a lack of 'winter' spices. Not too into spiced brews unless they're tasty belgians or something worth adding an extra dimension to."
""
""
""
"Very nice job!"
""
"O: Easy drinker, a very nice winter warmer."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a big cloudy head that lingers and laces quite well. The aroma is strong with roasted malt and light chocolate and toffee hints. Taste is ok but surprisingly bland, with the stronger aroma one would think that the flavor would be more pronounced. Mouthfeel is decent and overall its a fine beer."

"Mouthfeel is dry and smooth. Overall, not too bad."
"Taste is piney hops followed buy some dark malt and coffee flavors. A bit of dark chocolate as well. However, still get an overwhelming taste of tea with high tannins."
"Very bizarre first smell. Can't really even describe it. Under a half=inch head. Hard to distinguish which hop actually smells/tastes okay. Very strange mixture. It does taste better than it originally smells I will give it that. Otherwise, happy I purchased this with a mixer pack and will not get any more."
""
"Heavy side of light, this drinks easy. Nothing offensive or amazing, like many a New Belgium brew. So not terribly interesting and a bit thin, but worth trying. Glad I tried on draft."
""
"Have been testing the New Belgium line-up now that it is available in VA. The dense flavors makes this one to sip and enjoy over the holidays. A black ale for snow day? Ironic - yes, but boy this is good."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. It does not stack up all that well compared to others in its style, however; there are several other beers in this category that I find to be much more complex and rich. Although I like this beer, I think it could be much more rich and a little bit less watery."
""
"Texture is nicely smooth and creamy but also feels slightly under-carbonated. Not a bad black ale, but I still prefer Black Top over this one any day. Why? Because this brew doesn't really come across as memorable or distinctive... It's just not complex enough to impress, nor is it simple enough to sell the minimalism approach... so I end up with mediocrity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark, chocolate brown with thick, off-white to tan colored head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is smooth, mild roasted malts offering hints of caramel and chocolate, mixing with a bit of grapefruit and planty, pine-y hops. A smooth flavor of chocolate roast malts with sweet caramel and a touch of grapefruit bitterness. Ends with a hint of some darker roast malts, leaving a nice aftertaste of dark chocolate and bread. Medium body with a chewy and silky mouthfeel. This one hits pretty well above its weight with complexity and a good punch of flavor."
"O - Screw the hot chocolate, give me some Snow Day! Winter Warmer it's not, this American Black Ale features great hop and roasted malt balance with a clean hop finish that begs for another sip...and a day off with 5 more bottles in the fridge!"
"Taste is bigger on the flavoring hops than the bittering, and they seem to meld nicely into a moderate malty middle and is finished off by a clean snap of roasty wheat and zesty hop bite. I really like this one, It first I was sad to see that was replacing (I think) 2-Below...which I looked forward to every winter. But Snow Day is as fine a replacement as I could ask for. Im on my second sixer already."
"Dr: Quite drinkable, but also unremarkable. I'd try it on-draught. It's pleasant, but they'd do well to increase the impact of the toasted malt."
"Not necessarily a bad brew for those cold winter nights, but definitely not the first one I'd turn to. With a creamier body and a heavier flavor, this would be a really good one. For shame."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with mild but smooth carbonation."
"Looks good, smells amazing, but the taste is very underwhelming. The end flavor is good, but it's a watery mess up front. Hops are really really nice however"

"An almost rich body and taste without a lot of definition which leaves to the conclusion that its very drinkable but why, if I'm going to drink a full bodied heavy beer I would like to have some richer tastes."

"The smell was the best part to this beer. Maybe the surprising good smell made me want to like it that much more, but it didn’t live up to my expectations."
"Makes me think of Sierra Nevada Celebration, only the NB is better with the less intense hops that give you a chance to enjoy the rich dark flavors. One of their better efforts if you like the hoppiness."

""
"O - I expected more malt character in the flavor profile, but it just wasn't there. In fact the drown out citrusy, and tart hop flavors seemed to throw it out of balance, and mask the soft malts. The aroma was great to me, very inviting, and the mouthfeel was nice as well. The flavor could use some balancing to me though. Overall I think it's still worth a try but I wouldn't pick it up again any time soon."
""

"D - Overall not bad; it could use more hop flavor and a deeper malt body; it's a unique and fun drink for the holidays"
"I like this beer a lot. Smokey taste but not too much. Not enough carbination, I know that's how it's supposed to be, but I still wish it had more.Tastes better when it's not so cold. Wish those Dallas Cowboys could do better. The Texas Rangers didn't do their part!!!"
"Overall: Not bad. Not Great. Probably a one six-pack a year affair."
""
""
"O: An interesting mix between an IPA and a winter warmer. It's not quite a black IPA like some have said, but it's a much better beer than most winter seasonals."
""
""
""
"O-An interesting beer-I'd consider it to be more of a black IPA than a winter warmer. To me the hops dominant and gives an unbalanced taste. I like the nice fresh hop aroma and taste but I tend to prefer a beer more on the malty/sweet side vs. hoppy."
"overall a great new hoppy winter beer"

"This isn't a bad beer, but I would not have guessed it's a winter warmer. Seems more like a wimpy black ale. Nice enough to try, but I wouldn't be inclined to buy it again."
"O- the hop profile of this beer works really well with the midnight wheat. I was a huge fan of 2 below, but this beer has won me over."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 2 inch foamy beige head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, chocolate, herbal/citrus zest hops, and some subtle spice aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, earthy spices, and herbal and citrus zest hops. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer but it seems like it could be integrated a bit better with the different flavors."
""
"Quite a few beers get jumbled in the ""winter warmer"" category, but this beer deserves the designation. Deep roasted malt notes with hints of chocolate malt. Nicely assertive hopping, akin to perhaps a double brown ale, if there is such a thing. Finish is malty competing for attention against the bittering echo."
""
"Served with a nice, light tan, thick, foamy, slightly frothy head that slowly settled out and lots o lace. Color is a clear garnet. Aroma is hop, malt, roast. Flavor is similar to nose plus toffee, bare sweetness, and some carbonic tang. Body is good, ditto carbonation. Finish is decent, a little short, balanced. Easy to have another."
"O- I thoroughly enjoy New Belgium beer and this one is no exception. A very good winter beer that I will definately drink again."
"O: Enjoyable, but not sure I'll buy this one again. Bordering on Black IPA."
""
"O - Not outstanding, but still not a bad beer. If you like hoppy black ales, I would definitely recommend this beer, although a full six pack might be a little much for one setting."
""
""
"Overall: Winter warmer. Lives up to the hype and gives a satisfying taste. Lacked on the foam for me. Perhaps it was just a bad pour on my part. It was smooth and then it was bitter and then it was smooth again. Complex, thick, and warming. Perfect companion on a cold winter night."
"Fairly disappointing ""winter"" beer from New Belgium - honestly, much closer to a black IPA, and not a particularly good one at that."

"Pours a clear brown color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight citrus, hint of spice, slight earthy malt, hint of floral/grass. Fits the style of an American Black Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy malt, floral/grass, hops, and slight citrus. Overall, good appearance and feel. Body and aroma are dominated by the floral/grass aspect."
""
"Pours near black with a decent head and retention and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some good American hops along with a bit of roast. Flavor is roast with a bit of resin and bitterness. Medium body with good carbonation and a semi-dry, roasty finish. Pretty good take on the style, but nothing too fantastic."
"O - not a bad winter ale, but not my favorite"

"Full bodied but easy to drink on a cold evening. Why rush it with a great beer anyways. Plenty strong and very tasty to get you warmed up from the weather. I will look for this ale every fall."
"Pretty good."
"O: I think the name certainly describes this beer. It tastes like snowfall in a pine forest. The clean finish makes it feel crisp, and easy drinking. Quite enjoyable, although I could perceive others as describing it as watered down."
"Its got enough hoppiness for hopheads to be satisfied, as well as enough complexity in the malt bill to satisfy stout and porter drinkers. I really enjoyed sipping on this one, and welcome it to any snow days we might have in the future. Good beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before 11 Mar 12. This pours a dark brown color with a nice foamy tan head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of hops, floral and pine mostly ipa like. The feel is medium and the taste is full of a bitter hop bite which coats the mouth and leaves a bitterness on the way down, it also has a nice roasted malt yet almost sweet taste in the middle, good stuff one of the better new Belgium beers."

"O: Big hops profile could have used a bit more balanced. Still it tastes good and is easy to drink."
"It's funny to have a beer where the aroma and flavor are so different. You get hops in your face in the aroma. And heavy on the crisp malty side in the flavor."
"A very enjoyable brew, and an excellent winter brew, this beer again shows that New Belgium just can't make a bad beer. Roasted, hoppy and crisp, this beer personifies a cozy winter day by the fire. Enjoy!"

"This might be my new favorite Black IPA. Really makes me want to get some midnight wheat to try out at home."
""
""
"For what it is, this is fine. To me, its not really a winter beer. Worth trying."
""
""
""
"This is basically a solid APA mixed with a solid warmer. Great seasonal session."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid black ale. Hops are vibrant and the dark malts provide some nice toasty flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's bitter. Who cares. I wouldn't buy a six pack as there are better winter beers."
""
""
"To start off, I do not believe this should be considered a winter ale. It tastes more like an IPA to me, but do not let this discourage you winter ale lovers. It pours a very dark brown, almost black with nice amber tones. It has a nice cream colored light head; very atypical of a dark beer and contrasts beautifully. It smells of fresh hops with a little bit of chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is good and the carbonation is balanced. If you like IPA's or even pale ales, go for one of these babies."
""
"Overall – Honestly, an odd beer. Not my favorite black ale."
""
""
""
"O - Don't know if this is a Black Ale or a hopped brown ale, tough to judge the category. Either way it's an enjoyable beer that makes a great beer for the winter months."
""
""
""
"So glad this beer is what it is...a nice warm surprise for me...this should be called a Winter IPA...It's a nice twist of styles..."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very drinkable and tasty beer. If I had known this was a Black IPA, I would have purchased this sooner. Will buy again."
""
""
"O: Interesting beer from NB, I'll probably drink the rest of the 6er without much trouble, but I would like a bit more body and a bit more malt depth to help it out. It's by no means a hop onslaught and insanely one dimensional, its just watered down is all. If they keep this around for next year I hope they make it a little thicker and a little richer."
"I enjoyed it, but I don't think that I would get it again."
""
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Quickly dissapating head but reasonable lacing. Pours a root beer color. Subtle pine and grapefruit aroma with caramel and slight chocolate. Taste of dark malts and citrus hop blend with very subtle spice in the background. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but nice dry finish. Overall I'm pleased with this one - it's like a black ale session beer. Not outstanding but certainly not offensive, I could imagine taking this to a Christmas party and enjoying it over a long evening."
""
""
"The seal brown colored body was nearly opaque, and the head atop was two fingers thick. The aroma was a mix of well toasted malts and citric hops. The taste provided flavors of anise, pumpernickel bread and light toffee. The taste was bit less flavorful than I had hoped it would be. The body was light to medium dense, and the finish astringent and abrupt. This beer started out very well., but didn't quite deliver what it promised."
"Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: Good, not great."
"Decent beer. I do fear NB is getting a bit away from their original Belgian tilt, but this is a decent winter beer, certainly more interesting than the 2 Below, which was little more than a strong Fat Tire."
"Nicely made and flavorful. Works for me as a ""winter warmer"" due to the significant alcohol warming (of the pleasant variety) I get as it goes down."
"Bring home a growler of this ale. It's going great with Sunday football. I think I need some some super nachos to go with it, maybe even some hot wings."
"Big off-white head on black coffee with bubbles. Dry, ever so slightly toasted malt backdrop and leafy hop flavor with a touch of citrus in the nose. Almost a chewy mouth-feel but a touch too watery. Solid winter beer with a neat hop thing going on. Easy and worth getting again."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. New Belgium is a very respectable brewery but I do feel like their six packs are mainly average at best. This was a solid Black IPA in my opinion and more than likely will be taking up so real estate in my fridge through out the colder months."
""
""
"I kind of expected a Winter Warmer so I was surprised to try it and find out is was a hoppy ""Black Ale"". Not a bad beer and super easy to drink. Probably wouldn't buy it again but no regrets here."
""
"I would drink this while listening to some electronic music. Some mellow post rock experimental stuff like Bill Laswell, Radiohead, Mogwai or one of my favorites the cd Init Ding by Microstoria! Mostly relaxin' for a snow day!"
"A good beer as it stands, and a surprisingly good beer from the folks at New Belgium."
"This is in now way a Winter Warmer. It's way too hoppy and I like hoppy beers. Big disappointment by all aspects for me. I have the remaining 5 beers I can't drink."

"During my tenure at Purdue, we got one snow day, despite ridiculous (and possibly record-breaking) snowfall; my one year at Georgetown, on the other hand, saw nearly two weeks of snow days, thanks to Snowmageddon. None of this is relevant, just thought it interesting... Anyway, this beer pours a clear dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of glowing off-grey foam. The nose comprises light mandarin orange flesh, light vinyl, very light roasted malts, pine sap, and light lemon rind. The taste holds brings in more of the same, though the vinyl is gone, replaced by a touch more roast than before. The orange is more prominent, but doesn't stand too far out from the darkness behind it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty dern solid CDA (still can't bring myself to use the term ""Black Ale""), one that drinks very easily and stands up there amongst the top tier examples of the style."
"I like New Belgium, but this is a miss for me. It lacks in complexity and really doesn't have much of an identity at all. One and done."
"Overall this is an okay beer. I do not really like the blend of dark malts with so much hops."
"Beautiful hop aroma, foamy white head, pours a dark brown almost black color. Smells of piney hops. Taste is medium mouthfeel, not heavy. Good cascade hop flavor and caramel/chocolate flavor. No roast, no burnt acrid taste. Very nice beer. When you drink it expect an American black pale ale made with low lovibond crystal malts, maybe a little chocolate malt and medium-high level of American cascade/centenial/or columbus hops."
""
"Overall this beer seemed one-dimensional and not very interesting. Not one I'd likely buy again."
"First had this beer on draft, and at first it almost reminded me of arrogant bastard, but i had several beers before hand and I think that skewed my thought. It seems to have the same biscuit backbone that fat tire has, although this is a bit more hoppy and way more darker. I do get a malt nose also. Overall I really dig this beer, and am sure I will but several more six pack to get me through some of the long cold snow days here in Montana."
"Overall, a nice, slightly mellow, black IPA."
""
""
"O: This is the first beer in quite some time I've purchased and consumed over and over. I like it."
""
"I was bummed they decided to postpone brewing of 2 Below for a few years but this is very good. I will definately enjoy this again and again this holiday season! I can't wait to try it on tap."
""
"like everything new belgium does, this is a bit more hoppy than its counterparts. pours a deep dark mahogany brown/red with almost no head (bottle might be different). smells woody, boozy, hoppy, smokey. a sort of tart wine like vibe in the begining turns into a pleasant chocolate hops fusion with a nice winter warmer type sweet slow strong finish. the mouth feel is bizarre, not being very carbonated but kind of heavy makes it a weird one to drink a lot of (again, at least on tap). overall it isnt my favority new belgium offering, but as usual i appreciate their take on the style."
"Overall- This is not what I expect from a winter ale, the hop presence is overpowering. I did not enjoy this beer."
""
""
"Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a fairly thick and persistent light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Malty aroma has sweet chocolate and subtle spicy notes, just a hint of molasses. Flavor has a malty core with woody, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and molasses notes. Smooth texture is just a teensy thin but still good, and quite tingly. Finish is woody and malty with a hint of caramel."
"Drinkability: It is a nice brew, but I think it is a little overhopped for the holiday season. I prefer my holiday spice to be holiday spice."
"I liked this one quite a bit... hops are present but the malt is so unique it almost feels like a porter... this beer is way too easy to drink..."
""
""
"O: This is one of the better winter beers I have ever had. I enjoy the easiness of drinking this beer and how smooth it goes down. Cant beat that for how cheap it is."
"Not a fan of this. It seems like they were going for a sweet Black IPA, but the flavor and feel are a bit off. To a friend with a limited beer budget, I would suggest they pass this up."
"However, this is nonetheless quite good and well worth enjoying. New Belgium has done a fine job of rounding out its base into new, often terrific flavors--Ranger IPA, Abbey, Trippel, 2 Below, and now Snow Day."
"O: A solid beer, I like it a bit better than 2 Below. Why they suggest to serve this at 37F is beyond me, take my advice don't. A new enjoyable winter seasonal."
"O - The mouthfeel could use a little work. Other than that with is a very good beer. You get a good amount of citrus and floral hops and some awesome toasted malts as well. Just an all around good beer. Nothing mind blowing but everything is present an well accounted for."
"O: I prefer 2 below to this, it has a lot of flavor but not the best balance or drinkability"
"Snow Day is a nice beer overall. It doesn't strike me as a Winter Warmer all that much, but I'm glad I grabbed a sixer."
"O: When the housewife in front of me at the market grabbed a sixer of this I should have known better."
"Quite note what I expected, but still very palatable and actually enjoyable, once I threw my expectations aside (for that hoppy, spicy, red-almost-celebration-type-ale)."
"I find it enjoyable and while not one I will seek out...one I would drink again for sure."
"This beer pours a clear brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and grapefruit with a hint of pine resin. There is a very significant hoppiness to the aroma. The taste has a similar hoppiness, but with a more pronounced maltiness. There are toffee and caramel notes underneath the grapefruity hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a watery texture, and annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this is a beer that I will pass on next time. The hop and malt really clash with each other in a negative way."
"O: Solid beer, in my opinion"
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown with a one finger clingy light beige colored head that really stuck like glue as it settled very slowly into a frothy mass.Chocolate malts and piney hops in the nose,a nice mix.A little ""fizzy"" in the mouth,outside of that little sharpness it was ok,light to medium feel.Quite dry on the palate with unsweetened chocolate and some earthy notes,the piney hops come into the finish along with a tinge of sourness wich I dont really know where it came from,that light sour bite kept the taste score down a little for me.Its not your typical winter ale wich is good and it has a nice hop bite,its missing a biggermore smooth feel,and the sour shot I got I didnt care for,in saying that its a pretty good beer."
"Overall: Gee, it looks like everyone's having trouble categorizing this one. I'm seeing suggestions of Black IPA, Dunkel, Winter Warmer, and even Dark Wheat. Me, I'd lean more towards Black IPA, though, even in that category, it's not as hard-hitting as others in that grouping, but it'd be one of the more easy-drinking."
"O- Great winter warmer. New Belgium always treats me right, and this hoppy but gentle darker beer doesn't change that."
"Not the classic winter warmer but a nice beer on a cool night. The 6.2% alcohol is actually well-hidden because I could drink several of these."
"O - This is a really good brew. It really tasted more like a Black IPA than a Winter Warmer."
"O- Eh, an OK beer. I wasn't a huge fan of the ESB winter seasonal either, but like it, this is OK, but nothing too special"
"The best quality of this beer is it fills you up, but the complexity promised from the bottle's label left me wanting more. Not a bad beer; I'd drink it if it was offered to me. But this isn't a beer I'd anticipate every winter."
"Mouthfeel isn't rich or full, but it isnt turning anything about this off."
"D: Drinks rather smoothly and nicely. Defiantly one of my favorite winter seasonals now."
"I'd love to see two bomber releases jump from Snow Day. First, an imperial black IPA with both the hops and ABV dialed up. Second, a traditional brown focused on that new Midnight Wheat, perhaps unfiltered, with low alpha-acid hops."
"New Belgium Snow Day Winter ale: At a work social function there was a good selection of bottled beer for the sampling. I chose a New Belgium Snow Day, looking forward to something new. And it was an entirely different experience. I did not expect the nearly black color and thin off white head. This beer has the look of a black ale, rather than that of a winter warmer. Great aromas come off of this brew, lots of malty sweet smell and a big dose of coffee. Was it the look that made me smell the coffee? A roasty malt flavor greets you on the first sip, and there is some subtle bitterness to the finish. The Snow Day has a big body to it. Very good special or dessert beer, you will not down a six of these in an evening."
"Pours a very dark brown w/ a soapy one finger cocoa head. Excellent lacing on the sides of my snifter glass. Very dark- impossible to see anything when held to the light. Nose is mainly piney hops, wheat, and slight bit of malt. Very crisp and refreshing smelling brew. The taste is interesting.. It's very crisp- and the hops are definitely out front. Malt makes it's way into the picture in the aftertaste- but not much of it there. This beer almost makes me pucker the way eating a lemon does. It's not bad... just not as balanced as I'd like. Feel is carbonated/fizzy and light for what I'd expect. Very dry as well. Overall, this is an interesting brew- but not my favorite from this brewery. There are better Winter beers out there. Cheers."
"Snow Day isn't a classic Winter Warmer. It's not heavy or rich enough, but it sure is enjoyable: tasty and juicy. More suited to after a cold-weather activity, or during a spicy meal, than as an after dinner or late evening sipper."
"I poured into a small glass and was surprised by the dark color. When held up to the light, it had a dark ruby red note to the blackness. The head was thin with creme color and light lacing. The aromas was nice and hoppy, not quite as hoppy as New Belgium's Hoptober ale but still strong. A nice subtle caramel malt note crept in behind the hops. The taste started off as citrus and pine from the hops and faded to the caramel of the roasted malt in the after taste. The feel was full of carbonation and tickled the palate. Overall this was a better balanced beer than Hoptober. The roasted wheat malt made more of a nice compliment to the hops. While the use of only three hops, versus five in Hoptober, didn't over whelm the malt. New Belgium did good on this beer."
"Overall - This is my first Winter Warmer brew and I loved it. For me, it's a rather odd brew; It looks like a traditional stout beer, but it's actually got the flavor like an IPA with some characteristics of a stout beer, namely the burnt caramel and malt flavor. New Belgium is known for making solid beers and this is no exception, pick this up if it's available in your area!"
"My neighbor brought over a Snow Day from New Belgium. It was quite tasty. The beer poured a deep rich clear brown into my pint glass. The off-white head was big at the start and about a 1/2 finger at the end and laced throughout the drink. The smell included hops and roast....with a bit of sweet caramel. The first few sips of the beer the malt, roast, caramel, and slight coffee grounds were present. As I continued to drink the beer the centinnial hops on the front and casscade on the back began to take over. The mouthfeel was great....medium body and decent carbonation. Overall a great beer."
"Pours a cola brown with generous creamy/silky smooth head. Very appetizing appearance. Nose has a toasted pine quality, with some holiday spice candy in the background. Palate offers a rather assertive and playful mixture of caramel with the fruity hops, with yet again more toasty pine. High, tingly carbonation is noted. Finishes with a toasted to maybe burnt sugary pine as well."
"I like this. Good character and refreshing. I would classify it as a black ipa but it works well as a winter warmer also. If you like hops, you will probably like this."
"O - The Snow Day Winter Ale may be my favorite beer from New Belgium. Not to repeat others, but it's really a Black IPA, not a Winter Warmer. It's tasty and very hop forward. While it is very dark, the malts manage to stay in the background and provide a nice counter to the hop forwardness of the beer. Highly recommended and I hope the Snow Day becomes an annual tradition."
"O: This is a pretty sweat little beer, but I don't think it's a winter warmer. Nothing extreme but hitting all the right notes, and lots of pretty lace. Nice job, New Belgium."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a pretty decent beer. The hoppiness mixed pretty well with the toasty, sweet caramel malts. A pretty drinkable and flavorful beer of the season."
"Overall I don't feel like this is a winter warmer at all and is definitely a black IPA or American black ale or whatever its called. Approaching this beer with that in mind I think it's an average beer for the style."
"While nothing extraordinairy, this is a fairly tasty, easy to appreciate effort from New Belgium."
"Overall this is a great change-up from New Belgium."
"O- a drinkable winter warmer but a couple will do it for me, many better and tasty WW out there"
"Overall: Obviously Winter Warmer is not really the appropriate description. This is a nice Black IPA / American Black Ale that could use a titch more flavor and body. Otherwise, quite enjoyable and better than 2 Below."
"O: Ah winter seasonal beers are here again; it is time to spend a lot of my money. I have never had this before, and I decided to pick up a bottle. Sadly, this was not the best ""winter"" beer to begin with. If I were to grade this beer simply by how it tastes, it would be an average to decent black IPA. However, I am supposed to review it to the style it claims to be, and, in that, this beer has failed. While the appearance has a nice head and deeper color, the aroma is consumed by hops. The flavor of the beer tastes like a black IPA, not a winter warmer. The mouthfeel is not heavy enough, and the warmth from the alcohol is not really there. The flavor profile is missing the malt, fruit, and sweetness of a winter warmer. It is not a bad tasting beer, but if you are looking for a winter warmer, look somewhere else."
"O: Mix between a Pale Ale, Lager, Dark Wheat? Does anyone else find it annoying that a ""Seasonal"" has no correlation to the season it's sold in? Not bad overall but probably won't purchase again."
"Pours a dark opaque brown. Team head with good lacing. Smells of bread dough and a hint of chocolate. Good carbonation on the palate. Taste is where it loses me. Shoe leather, leaves, earthy. Some strange herbs that I’m not sure how to describe. Not very hoppy for a black IPA."
"Pine and bitter citrus peel, spruce, fir, or other coniferous descriptor. Flash of bittersweet cocoa, dark roast in the background to compliment. Smooth and fairly light bodied, medium level of carbonation. Spices? Nope. Hops? Yes, definitely. Dry hoppy aftertaste lingers around nicely. A pint or two would be no problem."
"O: A nice winter offering from New Belgium. The heavy dose of hops is rather refreshing for a winter brew. It doesn't come off as especially heavy or sweet, but still fits in well as a cold-weather beer."
"Would recommend."
"Poured an almost black/dark brown with one finger fizzy offwhite head that died slow w/ lace patches in top of a slightly floral hop aroma with muted spices and malts. I think I would consider this more of alright IPA than a winter warmer as that balance of sweet and roasted malts and spices is usurped by a earthy hop presence. This beer goes down smooth and easy and has some balance and finishes with a somewhat spicy edge, but overall the hops are too strong for my liking for this style."
"Overall Impression- Will definitely be enjoying more of this all Fall/Winter! Would suggest you get yourself a single bottle or 6-pack of this too. Not sure about the Taste and Mouthfeel yet but could definitely be changing this review the next time I get this beer. My first winter warmer this season. Enjoy!"
"The first Winter release for me this year. Like most New Belgium products, easy to drink and simple. Maybe not something I will reach for all the time, but certainly enjoyable."
"Overall: Another decent beer from New Belgium. Not their best offering but good nonetheless."
"O - Good tasting but not a great example of the style."
"I want my 2 below."
"It's a pretty little beer this, and my favorite New Belgium seasonal so far. It does occupy a place between an IPA or strong APA and a Black IPA. The hops please so many of us and it fits the season with some comforting, interesting malt notes."
"Taste is complex, beginning with a mild roasty malt, followed by a subtle citrus/pine bite in the middle. The finish brought a slightly bitter hops character, though by no means a hop bomb. Balanced well, this enjoyable ale really impressed me."
"Pours nice amber color. Nice crisp mouthfeel like an APA. The body is lacking for a winter warmer. Good value beer though. Above average with a nice hoppy zing. Another beer worth buying from New Belgium, just wish it had a little more oomph and body to it."
"O- Not bad, but I have had better, the feel of the beer is the best part. I might pick it up again, but I drinking it reminds me of Fat Tire with how underwhelmed I am by this beer."
"Overall though, this is not what I look for in this style at all, where is the warming malt body on this? Sounds like they went for hop heads, not what I want in a winter warmer, I need my spices, sweetness, and my malt, not a hop blast. I am going to pass on this one. (EDIT, someone had updated the notes on this from Winter Warmer to Black Ale since I wrote this review, which makes more sense now)."
"Appearance is a dark brown color with a healthy retaining head leaving nice lace. Smell has a big hit of fresh hops with malt in the background. Taste again has that big hit of hops that pulls thoughout leaving the malt in the background making it more of a winter IPA. Mouthfeel is a little light for the style, but has good carbonation. Not bad, needs to be more balanced with malt to bring out more flavor and body."
"Overall mild and not overly spiced. Drink this and expect an Oatmeal Stout and you will be happy."
"overall: a good beer, but i prefer 2 below to this beer. although its a nice medium bodied dark beer from new belgium. tastes are underwhelming, but the smell is great"
"Very dark reddish-brown with a thick, creamy off-white head that leaves behind plentiful lace as it recedes. Spicy, herbal, oily hop greenness over pine, berries, and a whiff of dark coffee. Piney hops upfront...pale fruit and a bit of char. Lightly sweet through the middle before succumbing to the dark bitterness. There's more of a perception of roastiness than an outright malty flavor element. If I had to categorize, I'd call this more of an Amber, though a dark and hoppy one at that. Regardless, I enjoyed this one, even though there's nothing particularly ""wintery"" about it."
"Pours cola brown with a fluffy light tan head. Get some serious hop notes on the nose. Roasted malts come through with an assertive hop kick on the finish. Similar to Arrogant Bastard but far less aggressive. Flavorful but not overwhelming. Better than 2 below."
"Overall a great little brew."
"This is an unexpected winter warmer. It's far hoppier than I had anticipated. The label boasts ""dark caramel Midnight Wheat"" as the malt base. It gives a surprisingly solid malt base that meshes well with the immense hops."
"Pours to a thick, rocky buff head and very good lacing. Mahogany color and brilliant clarity. Aroma is of spicy and piney hops and hints of caramel and citrus. Flavor is a funky mixture of spicy hops, dill, pine straw, black malt, and harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium. Overall, I was impressed by the distinctive aroma and the inviting appearance. The flavor was just weird to me and it felt too dry and chalky. I'll try it again later and re-review just in case my palate was off, which does happen depending on what I ate or how much gum I chewed during the day. It has got to be better than this."
"This is my idea of a winter ale/winter warmer. Nicely balanced malt and hops in the nose and on the palate. Decent lacing on the side of the glass along with a gorgeous deep ruby color. The hops predominate without muscling the malt character aside. It's in the ballpark of Sierra Nevada Celebration and Rogue Santa's Little Helper. Good stuff!"
"This would be a daytime snow day beer for me, especially if I was having beef fajitas."
"Upper end of light/lower end of medium bodied, the carbonation is medium and fits the beer well. Very nice mouthfeel. It's pretty easy to drink as well. I like this newbie from New Belgium."
"My new favorite session beer. I'd categorize this as more of an IPA/Dark Wheat hybrid. The only tie it has to the winter warmer style is that it's a winter seasonal."
"NB has really been surprising me lately. I was starting to put them behind in the ""interesting beers"" race, yet everything I've tried recently is nice and impressive."
"O - what can I say? I really enjoyed this beer. Of the few winter seasonals I've had so far, this is far and away my favorite. I do have to say that I enjoy this more than I recall enjoying the Two Below (not that it was bad at all). I didn't realized how hoppy this brew was going to be when I purchased it; if I had known, I might have shied away, but I'm glad I didn't. I nice hoppy beer hit the spot on a cool late fall day."
"O - A very good brew from NB, hopefully they're able to continue down this path! This is definitely not a winter warmer... Recommended."
"The hops dominate the aftertaste, but it's ok. It's not annoying; I rather like it."
"Overall - I enjoyed the every process of drinking this winter seasonal beer by New Belgium. From the pour to the last sip. I bought a variety of the winter beers that just arrived on the shelves and this was by far the most unique and pleasurable to drink. I can’t wait to get another six pack come the first snow fall."
"Feels medium in body, briskly carbonated, and actually wetting to the palate. Not a bad go to winter warmer."
"A fine winter warmer and a big departure from Two Below. Could be classified as a black IPA."
