"O- a very well balanced cascadian dark ipa. I really enjoyed this one"
""
""
""
""
""

"Bomber poured into a shaker pint glass. Extremely dark brown opaque brew with a frothy, creamy sponge toffee-like head three fingers high. Rich aroma of dark chocolate/cacao powder, white grapes, pine needles, grapefruit rind, this morning's coffee left out on the counter top all day, guava, warm orange juice, gummy worms ... This could be one of the best Cascadian darks/black IPAs I've yet to sample with the possible exception of the slightly more tropical Lagunitas Night Time. The balance between dark roast and fruity, spicy hops is nigh perfect, no mean feat even for some pretty reputable craft brewers. An initial flood of burnt chocolate pudding, raisins, and wood char is quickly supplanted (or perhaps complemented is the better word) by grapefruit, orange, mango, grape, and lime, without any appreciable flavor clash or other unpleasantness. Somehow starts roasted and dry while finishing sweet and fruity, with a pine note lurking throughout. Gets spicier and more resinous over time but clean and without any harshness. Just enough green flavor. Medium heavy body with ample chew and nice middle of the road carbonation. This changes my general level of enthusiasm for this style from lukewarm but open-minded to keen on further exploration. Gotta love these paradigm shifts that occasionally strike the ticker like lightning."

"O - It is good. I liked the initial taste more than the last. The grapefruit bitterness builds over the course of the beer, virtually eliminating any traces of the mild roasted malt."

"Very dark very good, smoky and smooth, smells like pale ale, creeper strong"
""
"Overall - An excellent Cascadian dark ale by Deschutes Brewery. Hits all the marks in terms of style with roasted malts and an earthy/citrus hop profile. I like the the hops held off until the finish, allowing the malts to showcase their roasted flavour. A real hit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  very unique dark roasts hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Pretty good. Smells like an IPA, tastes like dark beer at first. As it warms the malts smooth out and the hop character comes out more. Nicely done, nicely balanced."

"Pours black with hint of ruby with about a half finger of head. Smells of smokey with citrusy hops. First taste is of citrusy hops followed by the earthy smokey stout flavors finishes very dry with long lingering citrus hops bitternes. Mouthfeel is creamy smokey coating of a stout but lighter like a porter."
"Pours out a deep dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights and a thin khaki head. Smells of ash, toasted and burnt grain along with resinous and citrusy hops. Flavor has a caramel malt backbone with tinges of roasted malts. Fruity esters are present. Hops are big on citrus peel and have an earthy character. Finishes bone dry with a balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, with a soft and lightly tingly carbonation. This is a fine example of a black IPA."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very solid and affordable black IPA. Admittedly, the style is one of my favorites, but this beer is just done right. It isn't groundbreaking, but it is very good."
""
""
"This beer is a solid execution of the style. The nose gives it away as being dark with its roasted appeal but based on flavor alone, it would be very difficult to guess this is a dark ale. It is medium in body with ample carbonation level. Pretty decent per style and very aggressively hopped. If I had to drink a black ipa, id reach for this one."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/21/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, light coffee, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - This is a very well-made, Black IPA! This style has been growing on me in the past year and would put this up there against MBC's Weez in my top five. I hope that VA can get Deschutes one of these days. Until then, I'll keep ordering and enjoying!"
""
""
"Overall a solid CDA. Pretty balanced, pretty delish, it'd be nice to have a fresher one to compare with. Why the hell isn't it available in Nevada?"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Drinks more like a hoppy porter than a strong black IPA, but very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As it were I happen to have on Queensryche' Jet City Women which paired quite nice."
""
"D - A stellar American Black Ale that lags the best in class by just the slightest of margins... A bit more aroma and a bit more of a well rounded taste and mouthfeel would elevate this one to epic... Regardless this is a rock solid offering from the fine folks from Deschutes who continue to impress me since entered the PA market... I can easily recommend without hesitation..."

"Pours a dark brown, almost black. Thick fluffy head with pretty good retention--left a nice ring of foam and good amount of lacing. Nose is a nice combination of pine and malt, some coffee and chocolate hidden in there as well. Balanced taste of the malt and hops, you get the hops initially with a malt backbone. Bitterness hits the tongue first and the sweetness flushes in before ending with hops again, dry finish. Mouthfeel is moderate and right in the middle, not too light and not too heavy. Well-balanced and nice carbonation, which makes it easy to drink. Overall, a solid black IPA. I like stouts and IPAs separately, not a huge fan of this style, but Deschutes makes this well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste gives you some hops up front, then slightly sweet, faint chocolate and roasted beans in a nice malt that is thin and easy to drink. The aftertaste is just slightly bitter combination of the hops and subtle coffee, but smooth. This beer keeps hinting hoppy porter, but has enough of a touch of sweetness to make it a dark ale. I would compare it to a hoppy, sweet, Black Butte. Very good"
""
""
""
""
"Black ipas are always a toss up. This one is not offensive. The malt and hops don't clash. But, for me, they don't really improve each other, either. Seems a touch disjointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice black IPA. Similar in a lot of respects to Lagintas Nighttime."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my second example of this particular style this evening, and this Deschutes version is superior to the one I drank earlier (Lagunitas). An excellent brew with a complex and satisfying flavor."
""
""
"While the classic Oregonian Willamette valley is well represented with acute citrus bittering, I expect more tropical, orchard and citrus variety to allow the hops to take better command if its malty rival."
""
""

"Final Verdict: Good smooth balance on coco and hops. Very smooth me drinkable~"
"Overall, this is more of a “serious” take on your black ale. Where many black ales will meet the dark smokiness of the malts, and any bitterness of the hops, with a sugary sweetness of inclusions, or more commonly of a secondary fruity hoppiness, here you get the unabashed raw side. While we prefer our black ales to have more of that sweeter balance, this brew works well with the chord it has struck. We do lose a fair amount of pointage on the nose, which comes across dull, and dry. Warmth does help it along a bit, as it does with the thick creaminess of the feel, but it doesn’t quite eradicate those initial misgivings. This is a very nice black ale (C.D.A. if you will), but we don’t feel it entirely and adequately represents the bulk of what you should expect from the style."
""
""
"D: overall a fairly hopped ale that is well represented from the darker grains out there. not earth shattering, but certainly a well made American black ale. as with anything hoppy, drink it now!"

"o: by far my favorite black ale/cascadian dark ale. great balance, easily drinkable, and full of great flavors"
""
""
""
"Overall - a lot like their Obsidian Stout, which I love, this beer has some very fine qualities!"
""
""
""
"O-Overall a fantastic Black IPA or what they like to call it a Cascadian Dark Ale. Worth picking up and enjoying. Deschutes is a great brewery and this beer does not disappoint like many of their beers."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid take on the style. The craftsmanship really sells this beer for me and makes it enjoyable. It smells a little better than it tastes. It's a nice value in the world of bombers."
""
""
"O - I was very impressed by this. It was darker and fuller than most black IPAs I've had, with a great roasted coffee character that made this seem like a stout, combined with the fuller mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - nice flavors, nice balance, very drinkable, but missing a wow factor. I also prefer this style to have a more prominent roastiness. Either way, still worth the try and still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty little hoppy dark ale, but it doesn't quite stand up to my favorite two or three in the same style range. That said, I would encourage anyone who likes the interplay between bitter, roasty malt and citrusy, herbal hops to check this one out."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice drinker; I would like to see stronger hop flavors and aroma in a CDA, they seem to be a bit buried by a slight over-application of dark roasted malt."
"Overall Deschutes continues to deliver with this offering."
""
""
"Overall, very enjoyable, especially if you like both stouts and IPAs."
"Cheers to Deschutes again....and again...and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good black ale. Very bold taste but the hops are balanced well by the dark malt notes."

"O - An enjoyable black IPA. Nice roast character with a solid bitter backbone."
""
""
""
""
"Happy Holidays...at my bro in laws and he brought back a lil' piece of heaven from Oregon. The Hop In The Dark is a dark ale that hopped with cascade hops. The appearance is a opaque dark with a off-white head that is lacing nicely. The smell is big piney hops. The taste is hop/pine leaning dark ale. There isnt as much roast as I would prefer but it is still very good. The mouthfeel medium to full body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good, solid CDA, though a little too piney in the hops for my liking. Not quite as complex and harmonious as some of the better CDA's I've had. Still, it's nothing to scoff at, and it's certainly a brew I'd love to try from the bottle."
""
"O- I don't see this beer as an IPA. The 70 ibus are lost in there. The chocolate and coffee win the flavor race and will not give up. It is not bad, but when I drank this, I'd had enough."

"D: A solid, but not special BIPA. A nicely drinkable offering from Deschutes. Would go best with a meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an interesting beer that if we widely available, I may consider picking up again. Granted I had to order this and have it shipped into the state, I doubt I'll ever have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fun to drink, certainly is more right than wrong. A good representation of an India Black Ale, but still enough there to please a dark beer drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Love the chocolate and hop balance. This is one easily consumed beer due to the awesome balance of this beer. Again the dark IPA impresses me as a lover of both stouts and IPA's since it brings them together and Deschutes of course doesn't disappoint. The only thing that leaves me wondering is what did the almost one month past best by date do to this beer?"
""
"The best CDA I've had so far. This one blends the bitter and sweet like none I've had before and shows just how brilliant this style can be when pulled of well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - yeah, this is amazing stuff. I love the black IPAs as a nice segue from IPAs, which are my preferred beers by far, to stouts/porters, which I'm too nancy to try. BPA from Lakefront, Black Top from New Glarus, and others are making the transition quite easy. A fantastic beer, and for the price, you might as well get a ton of it."
"O: Great beer. We're heading down towards the ""best by date"" so I'm not sure if the hops would have been more vibrant a few months ago. I might have liked it a tad more then. Either way I wouldn't hesitate to have this again."
"o: too good to be true. really like this beer and would not be upset to have to drink more than one."
""
""
"O: Best of both worlds. Dry roastiness of a stout with up front, delicious hops. Rare to drink Deschutes and extremely satisfied."
"Overall--This beer is almost too balanced to be memorable. Everything works so well together and toward the same goal, and I have to remember that this isn't an IPA or a porter, but those conflicting signals make it its own class. I've had this style a few times (Cascadian Dark Ale is apparently the name they're pushing for black IPA, I love it) and this is a prototype for the group. Not as stunning as Mountain Standard was to me the first time, but as solid as Deschutes always does."
""
""
"I love all things Deschutes, but this seems to be falling short a bit. It carries the required black ale character, but it isn't blowing me away; or even keeping it interesting really. It's kind of a mundane brew that isn't really memorable. Unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Super great beer with a mass appeal. As usual, Deschutes packs a great punch with a beer I could drink every day."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is pretty good but just missing on great. The nose is nice but not very strong, and the taste is very nice but the aftertaste is a bit to bitter and the feel is carbonated but too light and thin. I think if they did one more iteration on this, it could be really great."
"O: Worthwhile and pretty good. I'd recommend one, but I probably wouldn't jump at the chance to buy another."
""
""
""
""
""
"While not a huge fan of the black ale/ black IPA genre, I thought this was an overall decent beer. Nice to have a Deschutes beer since it's not available around here."
""
""
""
"Pours out a very black color, you can’t even see the reddish hues in the outer edges and you can’t see the carbonation, but it certainly looks like there’s plenty. The head is thick , dark tan and very soft, bubby and looks just like heaven should. I got a two finger thick head and it just won’t leave your side! It’s got a rather thin aroma, some roasted malts, mild dark fruits, very sweet overall, raisins, figs and prunes all come through. Pouring more into it, the beer cuts right through the head like an all too tight pair of jeans on an all to fat ass…it leave an mark to say the least. Its rather light and crisp on the tip of your tongue, and rather light bodied, but as it travels towards the back of your mouth it feels more like a medium bodied beer and then slightly heavier as it hits the back of your throat. The roasted malts re strong, the fig and raisin come through pretty well too. Its slightly bitter overall and the hops are well hidden until you get to the aftertaste…then it sort of kicks you in the tongue. Overall I really like this beer, I would categorize this beer's badassedness right up there with a Remington 870 Police Magnum with a 14 inch barrel. A damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
"By and large a great beer, with the looks of a classic porter."
""
"Another pleasant surprise from Deshutes! Looks like a porter, smells like an IPA, tastes like both. I'd say it's closer to an IPA, but the dark malts are noticeably different than, say, their Inversion IPA. It's a winning combo, even if it isn't one you'll reach for every time. Good thing it's a special release beer so it's nice to see it turn up when it does."
""
""
""
"Overall - Absolutely a brew worth your time. Buy it, try it, it is very unique. I certainly will. And if you don't like it, send it my way, because I'll drink it anytime."
"O - Hit the nail on the head! Well put together beer here."
""
""
""
"Palate: Pine alongside orange-like citrus. There's plenty of roastiness, a hint of dark chocolate and a big resinous kick in the finish. Acidic and slightly ashy. Carbonation feels too high at first, but it settles out quickly. This is hugely flavorful and quite bitter, perhaps a bit too sharp for its own good. The mouthfeel is light and dry, a touch thin toward the finish."
""
""
"Overall- Mixed feelings here; it's good, but feels like it fell just shy of being great. Decently priced, definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoy this beer. It is a great dark beer, could use a little more thickness on the mouth feel."
"O- One of my favorite styles and very well done, great balance but each component of the flavor is strong on its own as well. I grab a bomber every time I see it, highly recommended"
""
"Overall Impression- And the winner of this years Black IPA goes to... Deschutes! A fantastic example of the style and hope to go back to this one on draft or even bottle again. Once again, I haven't seen this one hit the MO market yet, so had to go to it."
""
""
"A real interesting take, with a mellow hop profile for this style. Nothing better from Deschutes as always, I dig it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine beer. I'm not sure I'll drink much more of this during the hot Texas summer months, but I can see revisiting this in the fall or winter many times over. A tasty, serviceable here, like I've become accustomed to from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good brew. I was excited to try it and it didn't disappoint. Yumy hop notes with a nice grassy notes balanced by some good burnt malt notes."
""
""
""
"Smooth texture from the black malt. Not particularly sharp, sculpted more like a porter in regard to carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a blend of moderate bitterness and a low-level but sharp grainy bitterness, mildly acidic as well. Pine, grapefruit and a little bit of orange are all noticeable in the hop bitterness. The grainy bitterness does mask some of the hop flavor, and the light unsweetened cocoa character does enhance the sense that this really is a hoppy porter. The mid-palate is just a touch watery. Light in body with a moderate, creamy carbonation, this beer finishes with an aggressive pine bitterness, a little bit of roast and some citrus. Excellent stuff, this."
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty damn good stuff. Probably would be a regular if it was year round."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent brew. It seems like it's missing something, as I prefer Stone's SSR better."
""
""
""
"O: A tad hoppy for my taste but really good. I would drink this one again for sure. Another winner for Deschutes (but everyone know they don't fail)"
""
""
"Pours hazy black with a thumbs width bubbly mocha head. Nice lacing. A sharp earthiness/pineness alongside a touch of some citric rind starts things off supported by some coffee and chocolate and even some bread. Smell dulls out a little as it warms. Flavor offers some chocolate, coffee, pepper, pine with a mild to moderate bitterness developing throughout the sip and climaxing in the finish. A nice creamy and silky active mouthfeel. Overall, Deschutes made me enjoy a black ale, though still not a style I find myself too fond of. Most Black IPA's that I have tried seem to have a strong infusion of citric fruit which this one doesn't, something that I think helped me enjoy this one more than others. Probably not a beer I will rush to have again, but still one I am glad to have tried and have enjoyed trying."
""
"O - Nothing memorable. For my palate, I'll take Stone's SSR over this one all day, everyday. But hey, that's for me and this one might be for others."
""
""
"Not the best of this style, but right up there nipping at their heels, Drinks sooo easy"
"O- Another solid hit from Deschutes. Enjoyable, and refreshing. Deschutes combined the best of both worlds. The chocolatey smokey roasty flavors of dark malts with the piney, grapefruity, hoppy flavors. Seek this one out."
""
"I've had better Black IPAs...this ones a bit of a mess. There's a lot left to be desired with this brew, less chocolate and more delicate hops, to start. Semi-recommended."
"an excellent black ipa. pours very rich looking, thicker and an aggressive fizz happening. 2 inch tan head with nice rentention, dark brown liquid. smells like bitter pine family hops, and chocolatey roasty earthy malts. balanced but hop forward. flavor follows suit, great interplay between the rich velvet of the malt and the puckery punch of the hops. feel is lovely as well, very creamy in the mouth with a fuller body and good carbonation. overall a damn good brew, which ive now come to expect regularly from deschutes. they never ever disappoint"
""
"Amazing. Definitely a must try for hop lovers, CDA lovers, and even IPA lovers."
""
""
""
"O: This thankfully was not old/no hop degradation is apparent. One of the best CDAs I've had. Maybe Stone 11th was better. I love the hop bite dominates with the roast playing second fiddle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the better black ipas I've had, super glad the safeway down the street has it at 5 a bomber, will seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown with a root beer head. Aromas of malted milk balls and cascade hops. The mouthfeel is soft and wet, but less viscous than the eyes would lead one to expect. A delightful mild carbonation scrub on the finish. Flavors are characterized by chocolate and tart citrus. Some floral essence as the olfactory becomes more involved in the taste. Lastly, a little smokiness that the hop bitterness tends to perpetuate. I've never been remarkably impressed with this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's better than average, but by Deschuttes standards, it is nothing about which to get too excited. Especially for the price."

"Overall, it is a strong-flavored beer that gets old, to me. It starts with an interesting flavor and gets more bitter, more grapefruity. The 2011 batch from the 22 oz bottle."

"A friend picked this one up for me. Dark brown, almost black pour with nice tan two finger head with good retention and great lacing. Earthy, roasty, slightly subdued nose with hints of citrus, dark chocolate, coffee, and just a touch of pine and nuts. The taste is noticeably more bold with a nice roasted malt profile up front, meshing nicely with a tangy, fresh hop bitterness on the finish. Lots of dark chocolate and espresso, and as it warms, the citrus comes alive with a touch of pine as well. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and a bit oily, with a really bitter finish. Most of the Black IPA's I've had are more of a stout/IPA cross, where this was more of a porter/IPA. Definitely a unique interpretation of the style, and one that I will revisit. A solid offering from Deschutes."

"O: I would love to have this fresh on tap. A very solid and well-balanced Dark Ale. The lack of coffee or cocoa notes keeps it from being confused for a Porter hybrid. The flavor profile is diverse and quite fresh-tasting, considering the date on the beer. B+"

"O: Drinks like a Black IPA should. I actually think this tasted like a very enjoyable dark session beer, but I know the ABV is a bit too high for that category. Well done Deschutes; can’t wait to visit Bend one of these days!"
""
"Mouthfeel is good, but caught me off guard. The body was much lighter than I expected, this being much like your standard quality IPA. Light bodied with full flavor which creats a dangerously drinkable combination. A solid beer from a brewery that I more and more wish distributed to my area. Thanks Geoff for putting this one in the box!"
""
"O-An ok beer, nothing big here. I think i let this one sit for a little too long. Decent flavors but a little flat also. Would have liked to see more hops and a higher IBU."
""
""
"overall, i would say that the sum of all the parts melds pretty well here. balance and integration is probably not a goal for this style, but should be kept in mind. hop in the dark provides some direction as far this is concerned. definitely recommended!"

"O: One of my favorite finds of 2011 to be honest. I wasn't expecting as much as it gave me, especially since I've only seen this in 1 single spot (the place I picked up from tonight). It's a very complete Half-IPA, Half-DarkAle style brew that is bound to leave recepients tastefully filled and content. Highly recommended to absolutely anyone. A."

""
""
""
""
"Being a fairly new style, I've only had a few Black Ales. I like this one, although it's a little more malt-forward than the others I've tried."
"Overall – This is one of my favourite styles of beer and Deschutes has a done a fantastic job with it. It has a great diverse/interesting taste and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire bottle. I wish this one was available to me locally."

"O: Very good beer. Nothing less is expected for a black ale coming from the Deschutes Brewery. This is a must try."

"overall very well balanced beer!"
"The mouthfeel develops well - creamy and full, backed by a snappy hop bittering. Quite spicey and complex. Excellent craft at work here - not my favorite style, but this a well crafted beer."
"Interesting brew I'm greatful for the opportunity to taste."
"Overall, this is a really good beer. Pretty straightforward. It's not trying to be anything that it isn't. It doesn't really do anything make itself stand out against the best beers of the style but it does put itself in the conversation."
"A very nice beer for the changing of season here in AZ."
"It has a nice mouth that is slightly oily and coating."
"O: This beer shines much brighter on draft, where it is much more citrus forward. Just above average otherwise."
"O: Unlike many other black IPAs I've had, this one isn't very good with some age on it. I should probably try this fresh."
"O: Another delightful offering from Deschutes"
"Overall I must say this is a fantastic beer in a fantastic style. This was the one that started my love of the style but I don't believe it is the pinnacle of the category. A must try!!!"
"Pours a thick beautiful two-toned orange and tan head. Jet black color. Aroma is a pleasant coffee and hops smell. Flavor is like a chocolate covered coffee bean with a grassy bitterness. Thin and slick with a dry, bitter finish. Overall it is very drinkable for a Dark Ipa (a black ale or black ipa?) but tasty nonetheless."
"Beer is medium in body with a mild bitterness at the back, there is a hop palate but this beer is mostly a sweet porter wtih some hops in it. I'm a little let down. There is close to no bitterness from the hops or the roast. This beer could have done a lot of great things, but mostly it is sweet with some hops in it. Oh well."
"Nothing too exciting for me on this one, would probably be better with a little more dark malt."
"O - Great all around. The style isn't made to produce session beers though. For me the high point was the smell."
"A solid drink overall. Temp is an issue as it was better as it warmed."
"Verdict: One damn good black IPA. It mixes some great flavors in proper balance and with a milder 6.9% ABV it makes for great drinking."
"Certainly worth seeking out and I would buy again (if I ever find myself on the West Coast)."
"I picked this up in the tickers bif, jet black pour, medium white head. Big pine notes backed with some citrus and roasted malt notes on the nose. The first sip is nice and hoppy, lots of pine. It finishes with roasted malt, some bitterness. The body is medium, no alcohol notes, easy drinking. A very good black ale, not a big fan of the style, but this one is very good."
"O- A really great aroma, but once you drink it, I feel like the hops take over too much."
"I think I've finally been converted to the BIPA style. This is a very tasty beer, and I'd drink it again in a heartbeat."
"Cheers!"
"This was a treat to try... definitely something I've been looking forward to having for a while. Opaque black with moderate tan head. Nose is citrusy with a moderate hop presence on top of a bit of coffee--a little weak for what I want, but not bad at all! Flavor is really nice with a big blast of citrus hops on top of an assertive coffee/roasted bitterness. Feel is light and drinkable, overall a good example of the style, worth a try."
"Dr: It's easy to drink for its relatively high ABV, but it does suffer from some problems with the hop balance. The price is a bit too high, but then it is an import. Dissenters may argue that it's brewed ""to style", but there's certainly room for improvement."
"O - This is my first experience with this style, and I must say that I am quite impressed. Not my favorite beer, but definitely something I enjoyed immensely... for encroaching a new horizon of flavors, if nothing else"
"o - Overall I really liked this one; one of the better black IPA's I've had. I loved that the hops really came through in the nose and taste, and really enjoyed the chocolate in the nose. Would like to have it again."
"O- Delightfully well rounded beer. This is my first cascadian dark ale, I will have to try more. I'm impressed and really enjoyed this beer, and would highly recommend it."
"overall: this really is just a solid beer. I would have to say that I like the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous more because it is simply more assertive. This beer is well-done, without a doubt, but just not overly memorable yet not completely unforgettable. Good, but just not exciting."
"This is the best “black IPA” I’ve tasted. I enjoy this new style because of its uniqueness and clever mix of black coffee, rye, and hops, although most other attempts overdue it with the rye malts, etc. Hop in the Dark is complex and different while still maintaining the qualities we’ve all come to love ( and are taken aback as if personally affronted if they aren’t present) in an IPA. The best black IPA--I’m sorry--Cascadian Dark Ale yet. Hands down."
"O: A nice black ale. Some of the coffee and fruit characteristics of some stouts, but a generous dose of hops as well."
"Cheers"
"O- Black IPAs are quickly becoming one of my very favorite styles. This is very indicative of the style, and I was quite impressed."
"Nice solid ABA. I've had this on my wants before, but I gave up... thanks Andrea for the past want!"
"Cheers!"
"Intriquing integration, a wholly unique hybrid of dark malt, and pungent hops, well played. Delicious, honestly, seriously."
"O: Probably one of the best Cascadian Dark Ales I've experienced. Complex, yet balanced, with lots of conflicting flavors that actually blend well together. A very nice and quite enjoyable beer."
"A nice dark IPA here. Very approachable and tasty with a nice play in balance of hop tones and a darker underbelly of malts."
"This is a very drinkable black IPA. The time of the year I tried it makes me wish I had it months before for freshness; it definitely would have benefited from it. Maybe I would have had some head after a stiff pour... Very solid black IPA, one of my favorites so far."
"O: Better than most in the style but not as enjoyable as the imperial version, the Deschutes Hop in the Dark CDA is a good sipper. I find that the drinkability is better than most American Black Ales, and that the beer becomes more drinkable as it warms. For that reason, I suggest letting it sit out and warm up for at least 10 minutes before opening the bottle."
"O: One of the better in a style that I am not really huge on. A nice, balanced blend of the black and the IPA here."
"O= Overall great beer glad I had this one one this tops any other of this style it was really good."
"Another great beer from sweetwillyrolbar. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This pours with a nice fingers width crown. Dark, as you can imagine. Light has no chance of passing through. The nose is malty. Lots of coffee and toffee. This is a sublime beer. Truly top notch. This is so smooth and drinkable. The taste mirrors the nose. Did I mention how smooth this is? I would love to have more of this."
"This was my first beer from Deschutes; I've liked all since. Poured from a 22 oz bomber into my trusty nonic. Dark, aggressive head that kept rising. Thick as hell, with nice sticky lacing. Smell was hoppy upfront but you could tell there was some nice dark malt behind it. This might be my new favorite style. I love me some hops but the addition of good amounts of dark malt is something wonderful. It's like a stout and IPA combined. Thick yet drinkable, not too syrupy from the malt, and not too resinous from the hops. Proper bitter finish rounds off this exceptional beer...Cheers!"
"This is a tasty beer. Slightly filling but still crisp and enjoyable. Another reason I wish Deschutes was local to us."
"The CPJ"
"This is a nice, big hoppy ale which I really enjoy. Great flavour."
"Overall, this is a refreshing new sort of beer, and one that would be worth picking up a second time."
"O - Very good, it is the first of the style for me and I was a bit spectacle at first but this one is very good and I'm going to have to try more"
"Enjoyed this one quite a bit. I would put this as one of the top examples for the style. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"O: This is what I think of when I want an American black ale. Little roasted quality with a hop character that works well with the roasted malt and chocolate/coffee flavors. The negatives are that it isn't overly aggressive, not with the hop profile nor malt base. It does make it a lot easier to drink. A solid example of what I expect from the style."
"Very dark with faint brown edges. Dense tan cap with tons of thick, clumpy lacing, good head retention. Nice aroma, a combination of grapefruit and dark malts, a bit of roast and chocolate, oranges, malt. Solid bitterness from the hops as well as the dark malts with a sturdy malt backbone that was semisweet, notes of dark chocolate and roast, caramel, citrus and a hint of pine. It finished with some lingering malt sweetness and lemony citrus. Medium bodied with average carbonation level, a bit of dark grain astringency, relatively creamy texture. Overall, one of the better beers I've had in this style - packed full of flavour while still maintaining some balance."
"O- Not bad for the style. Wish it was a little more hoppy. I guess i feel that way about most black IPAs but i felt this one was just fine."
"D - This is one of the better Cascadian dark ales available IMO. It represents everything that the style should be. Highly recommended!"
"overall a pretty fantastic beer. really wish i had more than 1 bottle of this. doesn't seem to be a candidate for aging, but i bet it would still be great after the hops die down a bit. cheers to deschutes for pushing the style limits (or inventing one altogether?)."
"Overall - A mix of a porter and an IPA, definitely with more dark malt character than some examples. Too roasty and bitter for my taste, but a well made beer (just not my favorite interpretation of the style)."
"Not bad, but a little too bitter and rough around the edges for my preferences. Admittedly, I’m not a fan of this style, but liked the Alaskan version much better."
"This is a decent beer, but I could imagine a much better version in the style. Not bad, but I'll be honest-- even the best beer I could possibly imagine for the style would still be a beer I would rarely buy."
"O- this is a very good beer. Definately worth trying."
"O: Overall, I love this beer! It involves everything I enjoy about beer. I love darker porter/stouts and my favorite is a good hoppy beer. I would get this beer on a regular basis."
"O - Overall this is one of the best Black IPA style brews I have had to date, the balance of both style's lingers in your mouth and you cant decide what you like better... Bitter hops... or malty toasty porter. I like both so this brew wins!"
"I liked this beer a lot. I’d have to give this another try, though, since we were closing down the place and I had to finish up. Just a smooth, good dark beer."
"O-I got this beer in a trade and I am glad I did. Really need to start having more American Black Ales, CDAs, Black IPAs or whatever you want to call them, so far this one is the best of the the limited amount I've tried. Looking forward to more from Deschutes."
"I'm impressed."
"have again."
"No need to worry; Hop in the Dark is up to the challenge. Plentiful juicy citrus to be sure, but there's a huge roasted malt profile with no small amount of burnt flavors. Some semisweet chocolate appears while savoring this smooth and thickish brew. I wouldn't put this at the top of the CDA heap- in my mind, that territory is reserved for drier, stickier, usually piney versions- but it's very good."
"O- Really interesting brew. Awesome mix of a good porter and an IPA. I'll be seeking more of this out next year when it is released."
"M&O: The mouthfeel of this is smooth and easygoing. It's not overly or under carbonated. A nice medium body that makes it warming, yet refreshing, and perfect for any weather. The finish is drier, which just makes you want to keep sipping on it. I am in love with this beer! I am sad that it is seasonal. I'm also sad that my glass is almost empty...time for another!"
"Even as the very first of many Cascadian Dark Ales that I would try, this beer struck me as special the first time I tasted it. it ventures into a degree of variety of dark malt flavors and roastiness that hardly have been conceived, or at least demonstrated in any other beer of this style. So many others are clearly afraid of their attempt resulting in a hoppy stout or porter, limiting the variety of dark malts to those that are only meant to affect color. This beer has set a standard for the style that outght not to be taken lightly. The progression of lingering hop flavors and terminal bitterness is nothing short of complimentary brilliance to the initial silky smooth and dark malt character."
"Beautifully served to me in a tulip glass. Black body with a creamy tan head. Lets very little to no light through. Lots of malts and lots of hops is how this beer could be easily described. It has a great taste, very malty with an element that tasted just like a ""malt"" (like Guinness' non-alcoholic ""Malta"" or similar drinks). The malty feel is very sticky as well and leaves a unique and possibly overwhelming residual on your tongue as this is also a very hoppy beer. It's something to get used to, however, I don't know if I would. I didn't find it to be very drinkable for this reason. This beer is one to remember and may fit a incredibly unique niche of my personal beer taste, but not something that I would continually drink. For that reason, it is simultaneously mediocre but great."
"O: One of the best of the Black IPAs. Highly recommended."
"This hops/malt juxtaposition is really interesting - although I'm not sure I like it that much. This tastes like an overhopped stout."
"Notes: Damn this is good."
"Overall this beer is amazing for the style and as a beer overall. I love Sublimely Self Rightous and this is even better due to the perfect balance. There is a best by date of 11/28/11 and I just think this beer is prime right now."
"I was happy to pick this one up at Firefly. Fresh bottle good through 2011. Roasty aroma.Dark with large soapy head. Coffee, chocolate,a little anise that makes it really tasty and inetresting. Above average mouthfeel. To me a 1.5X stout with great hopiness. Good drinkability."
"Black coffee color with a decent brown head, that continues to cover beer surface even though most of the head laces and sticks to the glass. Light hop aroma, that goes down easily. Bitter dark chocolate with coffee undertones on the back of the taste- with a delayed bitter hop ending. If you like hops, black IPAs and Imperial stouts, you will probably like this beer."
"Poured in to a snifter, a crystalline, dark mahogany, somewhere between a dunkel and a porter in color; a small tan head left some moderate lacing. Aroma of roasty malts, citrus and earthy hops, slightly phenolic. Not as pronounced in flavor as other CDAs I've had, but still pretty good: toasted bread, sweet malts, resin, citrus, leafy. Medium body, a little on the thin side, relatively, for the style. Still nice and enjoyable for a session."
"Mouthfeel is in line with most black IPA's. Fairly thin body with good carbonation. This one reminded me a lot of Stone SSR. Overall a very good one."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 3/5; Overall 4/5"
"Overall Drinkability - Slow drinking beer. Enjoyable but maybe a little too much bitterness in the aftertaste. Might numb your gums."
"O: I wasn't expecting this to, but it really did blow me away. This was a genre bending balanced backyard vegetarian bbq in a glass. Fantastic depth of flavor, a cuisine of a dark hoppy beer. I love how the hops are treated as an unusual flavoring ingredient. There's no citrus, there's no tropical fruit, there is just an accentuated roasting that really reinforce veggie bbq notes. I love this, I'd drink another one immediately if I had it. This would pair so amazingly with so many dishes, I say just improvise. Dark earthy salads, and mushroom burgers would make for a memorable pairing. A fine cuisine beer with all the refinement of a master chef."
"O: This is easily one of the best things I've had from deschutes. Different, tons of complexity and a mega-skillful artisan craft of a beer that brings light and dark together and gives you some of the best of both without making either worse. Awesome. This really impressed me. Go deschutes!"
"Very good nice chocolate notes with the pine/mint. Another solid Deschutes offering."
"Overall: I absolutely love this style and this is my favorite of the style. This beer has wonderful balance and taste"
"A pretty good beer and a solid example of this style to say the least."
"Deschutes makes an incredible porter and they have a few solid hoppy brands too; this beer, which combines the two, seems like an offering they've made just to stroke their ego. Indeed, it's a fantastic combination of both worlds: clean but burnt grain maltiness and candied fruit hoppiness, satisfying but easily quaffable. It's a beer for amateurs and connoisseurs alike."
"If this was an easier beer to obtain for me my cellar would be stocked!"
"O- A really great beer, this is one of the only Cascadian Dark Ales I've ever had and is definitely an impressive brew. I love IPAs and heavily roasted stouts, and this beer really borrows the things that are great about both."
"It's a very dark beer with porter/stout color. A nice half inch head releases some hoppy smell. I'm getting hints of black licorice and brown sugar, but I’m getting very little else. I'm picking up very little hops. It goes down nice and easy with a touch of oily feel. The aftertaste is a little sour and unexpected (not in a good way). Overall it’s a nice beer, but I didn’t get knocked off my feet as I expected I would. The bottle didn't get the best travel conditions, so I'm going to have to try it again soon. The 21st Amendment ""Black in Back"" is a better Black IPA."
"A great beer. I actually think the name does this beer a disservice. When I hear the name, I'm thinking a beer along the lines of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous, but this is much maltier, more chocolatey, and chewier than that beer. Both are good; as strange as it sounds, I think a name change would be good for this beer...something I never thought I'd say."
"This is a great brew. The flavor is well balanced and appetizing. It is full flavored but not powerful."
"O-This baby hit it out of the park...Delicious and dry at the same time, very impressed on my first CDA. Definitely going to pick up another one of these and would highly recommend this...I love deschutes"
"Cheers..."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer, and a pretty good representation of the style. This is a new style, but one that seems to be taking off quickly. I am happy with it, and wouldn't mind drinking this beer again sometime. Give it a shot if you get the chance...especially if you are a hop-head. You won't be disappointed."
"O- I really wanted to like this beer. The combo of dark and hops is awesome, but it just wasn't there. Still, Deschutes is a solid outfit and the Bond Street Series is amazing, so I can't rate this down too far."
"Black with a hint of light passing through. Decent head retention and great lace. Piney hops dominate the aroma, although some roasted malt is also present. Soft mouthfeel and big rich body. Perfect balance in the middle with a bit of acidity. Strong bittersweet chocolate finish."
"O: A very good beer. I don't think I would expect anything less from Deschutes. Tried many by them and haven't been disappointed yet."
"O- a great black ipa ,top notch for the style very tasty and smooth"
"highly recommend, will gladly drink again."
"Overall and excellent Cascadian Dark..this one at least is not your typical IPA coloured black."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color, a little light get through the edges but its basically black anywhere else, this has a large light brown head. The initial smell is mostly Cascadian hops, but underneath you get some nice roasted / caramel malts. Medium mouth feel. The taste is fantastic the immediate taste is the bitter hops but on the way down there is a nice combination of roasted malts and hoppy bitterness. Overall a fantastic beer, I consider myself a Stone fan boy, but I actually think this just might be better than the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale."
"Overview:Excellent beer!! I would rate it right up there with the Stone Sublimely-Self Righteous. Having tried many Black IPA style beers as of late, this one for sure rates at the top with the best! You can't go wrong with this one!"
"This CDA is surprisingly refreshing on a warm summer night, but also something I could drink a bit more chilled during the day, despite its misleading name."
"Overall this is an excellent example of a black ale. The 22 oz bomber was empty way before it had any right to be."
"This is in my top five CDA."
"Beautiful head. Great nose of chocolate but you can tell the hops are comin'. The flavor is perfectly balanced between hops and malt character. The IBU's are high but it is expected. I will have to try another one of these in a couple months to see what the hops do. They should mellow out a bit and really show of this brew. Highly recommended, dare I compare to Surly Bender. Yes, I shall."
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry bitter hops that linger throughout but are countered by sweet citrus and slightly roasted malt.  Dry resinous pine with subtle citrus rind as well as some toasted malt, choclate, toffee and coffee bean.  Good balance of roast, sweet, bitter and dry.   Well balanced with a dry finish."
"Final thought - at almost 7% and only $4 something a bottle, this beer is great now and will be enjoyed as the fall begins"
"O- I love this beer, the best black IPA i have had to Date. Definatly something to buy again. If you like smokey IPA's try to find this one Highly recommened."
"O: Overall I really enjoyed this beer, I'm looking forward to opening up a bottle of Mirror, Mirror that I have more now that I've tasted what this Brewery can do."
"O: Great black ale, it would probably be amazing if the hops were just a little stronger and could stand on their own. Regardless it's nicely balanced and easily drinkable. To be honest it almost tastes like a thicker but hoppy guinness."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O - very good example of the style done right."
"O: Yet another SOLID brew from Deschutes, they definitely know what they are doing out there, very impressed with this one, best black IPA I have had I think, two thumbs UP!"
"Dark brown to black in color with a murky appearance. Poured with a stiff beige foam that slowly reduces leaving thick sheets of lacings on the glass. Creamy mouth feel up front, but finishes with a more resinous feel. Robust carbonation. Citrus hop aromas with very subdued hints of dark roasted malt. Mostly citrus hop flavors up front with dark rosted malt flavors beneath. Roasty malt flavors slowly intensify in the middle, taking over the flavor profile and ushering in a roasted coffee flavor that carries to the end. Finishes with an interesting combination of black coffee and hop bitterness that lingers for a while. Lots of interesting textures and flavors."
"O- Wow. Well Done. This is one of the best ABA's I've had. Must buy more now."
"Overall this is a pretty good example of an American black ale. It has a nice hop taste that is balanced out with a roasted malt backbone. This one is another win for Deschutes and shows why they are one of the best breweries in America today."
"Pours deep black - think a rich porter - with a fluffy, sticky white head. The aroma is the standout - hoppy and clean, indeed like a malt-forward IPA. Only as it warms does the roasted edge come through. The flavor is much more porter-like, with the dark roasted chocolate malt, toast, a little smoke, and cherry, but still with the sparkly hops. It's a little hard to tune into what sort of hops you're experiencing, but their presence is clear. The mouthfeel is surprisingly clean, with a muted, woody bitterness on the finish and a lingering citrus hop character back there somewhere."
"Definitely worth trying out, not really a session beer though"
"I APPROVE!"
"it was bad at doing both things: it wasn't very hoppy or bitter, but the roasty/malty notes didn't exist either. it seemed like kind of a generic weak IPA that was strangely colored."
"7.9/10"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is between light and medium and fairly smooth with medium carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. As I said before I really appreciate the lack of roasted malts which tend to make this style into a bit of a mess."
"O- Have had several black IPA's and this is one of the better one's I have had. Could use a little more citrus hops for me."
"My Beer Rating: 3"
"O - Close your eyes and you might think this was a week IPA. If you haven't already, you should try it."
"Tastes are roasty/roasted hops/fruity hops, a fire, marsh water, rosemary, molasses, herbs, oolong tea(s), Californian/American yeast, pickled plums, earth, dollars, fabric, newspaper, fries, cranberries and mustiness and spiced omelets and tomatoes."
"Another great Deschutes offering as they continue to deliver at a high click. One of the best black IPAs I've ever had and great value at 5.99 a bomber."
"Silky smooth mouth feel because of the medium body and proper carbonation, I find this super easy to drink. I'm glad Hop in The Dark finally showed up!"
"O: A lovely addition to the hop arsenal. I'd recommend this to Stout & Porter drinkers who want to amp their hop RDA."
"O: I was worried I wouldn't get any of this year's release because I'm headed out of the area for the month, and anticipate this will be gone once I return. But alas, the wife sent me to my local for some last minute whatever, and I just so happened to swing by the beer (and by that I mean, I looked at the beer, then had to call my wife to see what she wanted again :). With all the inconsistencies in ABV, Release dates, batches, IBU's, I'm a bit concerned this will not be a consistent recipe. They have recently touched on the fact that each batch of their Bond Series IS different, so I have no reason to believe otherwise. Oh well, I'm gonna enjoy this one!"
"I, The Friend, find a beautiful bitter at the bottom, good stuff sits deep. I have turned on his player piano in his drawing room. The power goes out. I realize there are three HITD left. It should be a good morning. Woodberries for life."
"As I drank more and more the bug flavor petered out a little bit and the alcohol was dramatically less prominent. Out of all my reviews that I have later came back to, this is the closest I have gotten to changing my taste score, but still, this beer just isn't hitting on all cylinders for me."
"Overall. Great stuff. Good hop punch with a nice roasty malt base. What more could a guy want?"
"Overall: this beer was very easy to consume and more than one was had in the session. Nice balanced flavor."
"O- I enjoyed this brew. Very solid."
"The pour was wonderful, black as night with a light colored head that rose up about an inch and a half before settling down into a nice broken crown that stayed throughout the session. The aroma was very bright, lots of citrus here, orange and tangerine mostly and a wonderfully bright lemon like aroma that rose up, not at all what you would have expected from something that looked so fark. Nice medium body with a smooth and mellow carbonation and a lightness to it that again was outside what I was expecting. Smooth flavor, clean, crisp, loaded with bitter citrus hops. Lots of grapefruit and pineapple here. Such a tight and very hoppy big IPA. I was very pleased with this one for sure. The alcohol was very well hidden I have to say and I was quite impressed with how smooth it came across."
"Overall a good beer from a brewery I like very much. I would recommend it but not if you're really in the mood for an IPA."
"T: Superb mixing of roast malts and hop bitterness to create a complex set of flavors that isn't too bitter overall. Fresh coffee up front, very smooth and delicate. Goes well with a hint of pine and resin that are fairly refreshing. Shortly thereafter becomes bitter with higher apparent carbonation. Rich, dark espresso bean with heavily caramelized notes. Right on the edge of burnt but not quite there. Fairly dry from the middle through the finish and it dries out fast with over the top resiny/oily grapefruit and pine as a second, pleasantly bitter wave crashing into the mix. The grapefruit plays off the coffee nicely. Brown sugar, which starts out fairly subtle, becomes full blown but doesn't add much, if any, sweetness. Finish is only faintly bitter but oily and resiny with grapeskin, rather than roasty, bitterness which heavily coats the tongue and a hint of spice at the edge."
"Nicely done as expected from Deschutes. Surprisingly less hop forward for them but still well made and enjoyable."
"D- Overall, incredibly tasty. Perfect combination of malt and hop varieties create complimentary and contrasting flavors that sit in balance. A classic CDA."
"Drinkability - a real sessioner for lovers of the PACNW hop scene. Thanks to BGThang for this one, it went well with the bitterness of this year's tax preparation, but tasted far better. Doh!"
"Overall pretty good but not their best (then again they set the bar very high for themselves), but a definite tasty beer."
"D - This is a refreshing beverage that I think would do better in the 12oz format than the bomber-only, limited release."
"This beer is very interesting, one of the most interesting beers I've tried, and therefore I highly recommend it. I think it has some room for improvement in terms of being more FULL of flavor, less watery, but if we're talking about flavors here, there aren't many beers I'd say come close to having the variety of flavors. Go try it!"
"T: Fair amount of hops, roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Very strange blend, but I liked it."
"Coal black colorwise. Small, tight head on top-leaves some very nice cocoa lacing as it descends. Decent amount of cocoa and mild coffee aroma mixed with a floral presence. Faint citrus. Loads of hop flavor with a very pronounced bitterness. Lingering bite to it. Sharp, black maltiness to finish. Enough malt to hold onto the backbone but it is all about the hops here. Solid mouthfeel. I really like the grain flavors and body here. Plenty of hops to go around. Great dark Cascadian ale all in."
"D- A good beer. Lots of porter qualities to this but with a bigger hop bitterness to it. Easy to drink but still a complex beer."
"m/d - smooth and creamy with a bit of a bittery but cooling bite. A touch watery which gives it a silky feel. the vanilla in the flavor really calms things down and gives it a dessert like quality and makes it easier to drink. Deschutes makes some world class beers."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Easy to drink all night with its 6.5% ABV. My vote for the best American Black Ale that I have tried so far. I wish I got more when I had the chance."
"D - I liked this quite a bit. I would definitely drink this in the transition from ""cold"" to ""hot"" months - transitioning from winter to summer beers. Or when I couldn't choose between wanting a stout/porter or an IPA/DIPA/Pale Ale. Was $6.99 at my local shop, which is a little more than this brewery usually costs per bottle - but likely the bottle shop on that one - definitely would buy it again at this range of price."
"Deschutes Hop in the Dark CDA (""Cascadian Dark Ale"") pours a dense puck of beige foam over a deep black brew. Carbonation? Maybe, but this inky liquid makes it hard to tell. The nose is predominantly the now-customary west coast grapefruit hop aroma, but with tantalizing notes of apricot and a bit of ale yeast funk. The flavor, too will be familiar to IPA drinkers- hop forward, of course, but with notes of mocha as well. Mouth feel is light- surprisingly light considering how dark this stuff is, with a long, dry hoppy, grapefruit rind finish. A decent enough IPA, but the puzzling dark color isn't enough to break it out of the pack- I really want to see a little more malt here..."
"Picked up a bomber, and pouring into a pint glass. The beer pours a dark, dark brown with amber highlights at the edges when held up to the light. The beer had an initial thick, foamy, 2-finger head that was a tan coloring, but dissipated over time. The beer has a hoppy aroma, with toffe and caramel notes, as well as fruity hints. The flavor is a bit complex, so bear with me. I'm getting a lot of different flavors, well blended, that attack the tastebuds. Bits of hops on a slightly sour malt backbone, with characteristics of molasses, bubble gum, and roasted coffee. It is full in mouth, but still remains light and crisp. The finish smooth and a little dry, and there is a bitter and hint of coffee aftertaste. The beer is extremely drinkable, and with the low ABV it is an easy going brew for the evening. Very tasty."
"Except for the odd slight whiff of soapiness, nicely done."
"D: Would make a great winter session beer if the ABV were a tad lower. Very easy drinking."
"Overall, my favorite... I guess they're calling it an American Black Ale now, but whatever it is I like it a lot!"
"The Cascadian Dark Ale, also called India Black Ale, style is taking the country by storm! Very impressed with the head, nearly black all the way through. Pleasing spicy citric hop nose cradled by a solid malt base. Smoothness digs deep. Well-rounded malt character provides a good, balanced wall for the hops to play off of; an inkling of alcohol is clean. Hops grow after each sip; finish is semidry with a linger of hops and faint dark malt. Nailed it, guys!"
"Bomber sample- very dark black coffee in appearance. One finger mocha head, minor sticky lacing. Nose- light roast, muted piney hops. Taste- milk chocolate, roast, citrus, herbal and pine hops in the back end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a substantial amount of carbonation. Dry toasty finish."
"I think that the MSBC Specialty XXX is better, but this is a good one too. Complex, and pretty smooth and balanced. Well done and certainly worth a try. .... I'd like to see them amp up the malt and the gravity and see what happens."
"D - Good beer, very solid, could drink this on a fairly regular occasion. Sweetness and depth of it make it a little hard to session at 6.5%."
"Medium bodied, a little chewy and dry, higher carbonation. Tasty profile and an interesting integration of the flavors, although I'm not exactly in love with black IPAs - glad I got to try this one either way though"
"The mouthfeel is nice despite the heavy bitterness. Smooth, mildly carbonated with a medium body. This brew is not bad. It's a little to much bitterness with not enough of the malt flavor coming through but it's still worth trying out. Not bad."
"D- This beer was damn good. I thought the flavor for the style has been the best I have had so far. Deschutes knows how to brew damn good beer and this one is no short order. Great job guys!"
"Do yourself a favor and give this one a try. Cheers!"
"Pours dark as porter. Nice head to it, pale mocha color. Smells somewhat like a cream stout and IPA combined. I guess its appropriate for the style. Tastes like a very balanced beer, robust with lots of malt and hop easily discerned. As an emerging style, reference points are few and far between, but this one is pretty awesome."
"Frankly, I am not the biggest Black IPA fan, but I really did enjoy this beer."
"D. This will not be a go-to beer for me, but it is an excellent change of pace beer for when you want something out of the ordinary."
"This beer pours a light black with brownish edging. I has a decent off-white to tan head and minimal lacing. The smell is hoppy with some roastiness to it. The initial sip is a blast of piney hops and after that you pick up some of the roastiness. It is more of a grainy roast than say, a coffee or chocolate. The body is medium, a bit thin in the mouth and a touch over carbed but nothing out of the ordinary. I like this roasty IPA, very good!"
"Drinkability: Goes down easier than any other black IPA I have tried; probably the best of this style I have tried thus far."
"One of the better examples of this relatively new style I've sampled so far. A nice interplay between the roasted malt flavors and the sharp hopping, melding into a cohesive flavor profile, rather than seeming like a blended beer, as some come across as."
"Drinkability: Just making a beer that fits in this category does not drop my jaw. There is more that could be done, especially considering Deschutes can make some great brews."
"the carbonation combined with the hops yield a nice sharp mouthfeel and the finish of tasty mocha is undeniably pleasant. this is certainly delicious, as i hoped it would be as soon as i poured it into the glass and saw what i was about to enjoy."
"This was good. I probably should have gotten into it back in August, when I bought the bottle, but it was refrigerated the whole time and seemed to have held up pretty darn well. The hops definitely still packed a punch and brought some earthy tones to the show that matched up well with the smokiness of those roasted malts. Nice easy body on this as well. I'll be seeking some bottles of this again next summer."
" ~ The time and place for this brew is after a long stressful day. This is a brew with which to unwind. Grab a pint, pop the bomber and kick back without distraction. With this brew comes a sigh of relief."
"Taste has the same juicy hop character, but toned down a tiny bit. Added to the mix is some nice roasted grains, that show some coffee flavoring. Accents the hop profile nicely. Beer was very impressive."
"A very pleasant flavour harmony here struck between light and dark shades. The flavours of dark-bitter from the roasted malt and fresh-bitter from the hops just work together nicely. The resultant beer is very enjoyable, and an indictment of why the India Black Ale (that's my preferred terminology; sue me) is the style of the moment."
"D- I am a huge fan. This beer is delicious. I was skeptical about a dark IPA, but I'm impressed. Deschutes has hit the nail on the head."
"This is a very complex and deep beer; one that requires respect and recognition. While, unsurprisingly, the dark and the hoppy characters jangle against each other uncomfortably, they also create a kind of harmony that is hard to ignore, and which demands recognition as a unique style. A fascinating brew."
"D: Awesome. This is an excellent example of the style; much better than Sublimely Self-Righteous."
"3.5 D: I like hoppy stouts if the stout flavors are still dominant. Black IPAs don't meet this qualification. I don't think the style is bad, but I prefer regular IPAs or regular stouts. The integration of hops and dark flavors just doesn't work out that well. Anyway, this is a good one to taste, but not drink all the time."
"D - Not something I'd drink heaps of but well worth trying."
"Sampled this during my recent visit to the Deschutes brewery. Dark pour with a thick head, looks like a porter but smells hoppier. Well balanced bitterness and sweetness, detected coffee and chocolate with hints of citrus. This was my first Cascadian Black IPA and as such it was enlightening! Waiting for more widespread distribution for this excellent style!"
"D- Really good example for the style, pretty solid. Bomber was easy to finish off. Another well done brew from Deschutes!"
"If you can get past the deceptiveness associated with the hops/malts characters within, it's pretty easy to down a bottle."
"Pours very dark, bordering on black, with a thin off-white to tan head and some good lacing. The nose is a bit muted, but brings some characteristic pine and, to a lesser extent, citrus hops. A bit of roasted character, but not too much. The taste adds a bit more roasted malt and calls back the hop profile a bit. Feel is really nice with dry roast and bitterness interacting well. Drinks well and is a nice example of the style."
"OVERALL: A good beer for sure. The palate could use a little more weight, which would help support the flavors a little more, and it could be a little roastier too, but this one is flavorful and enjoyable non-the-less. Drinks away easily as well. Recommended."
"A very sessionable dark beer."
"T/M: Robust, smoky coffee with a note of coco powder in the forefront. Dry but oily feel. Very drinkable and smooth with slight bitterness most likely attributable to the hops. Overall a very tasty beer, but i expected a little bit more hop forwardness."
"I love this style and I hope it's not a fad. I've yet to have a bad brew from Deschutes."
"Dark cola pour with a nice beige foamy head. Reminds me of a porter. The aroma starts off fruity (orange/grapefruit) but as I whiff more intensely, there is some chocolate hints and roastiness. The taste is very interesting. There is the grapefruit kick on the front followed by some coffee/roasty characteristics on the swallow and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The two come together nicely. Chewy mouthfeel. I was expecting a lot from this beer based on the brewery and the sweet label. It did not disappoint. I will definitely be looking for this each year and will try to cellar this bad boy for longer than four months to see what is created."
"Taste has plenty of hops, both bittering and flavoring, citric and floral. Malts play nicely with a mild coffee roastiness and less sweetness than the nose indicated. Drinkability is awesome, as this goes down uber-smooth. I like this one quite a bit, borders on being a great beer."
"Edit as it opens up a little more its a total pine forest on the nose! Wooo!"
"D - If you love hops then this is a great beer for you. One of the most hopped black IPA's I have ever had!"
"D: Solid example of the style, but the strange qualities to the taste make it hard to have much of this beer."
"Very drinkable. Nice roastiness with a great hop blast."
"I really prefer Weyerbacher Lima's more aggressive pine hop taste vs. this ones flavor profile."
"Drinkability is good, naturally. I would love to see this become a regular brew, heck even in a six pack would be good too"
"Overall not for the meek beer drinker. More suited to those who like a porter from time to time, but would like a big hops kick in their porter."
"D-"
"Very high drinkability. Very good smoothness with that awesome hop finish."
"Cheers!"
"Interestingly enough, given how it started, the aroma ends up being the highlight of this beer for me; the flavor is certainly not bad, but the integration of dark malt and hop character just seems to work quite a bit better in the nose than it does in the mouth."
"D: A very drinkable beer that goes down smoothly. While nothing exceptional, I'd have no issues drinking it again."
"D: I definitely want to try this one again, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this one is killer on tap. However, the beer I just tasted was okay but not great."
"D: An excellent example of the style, very drinkable."
"Flavor and feel are quite like a porter at first and when consumed through the foam. This segues to a dark and dense lager feel with warming and exposure as the body thins and the hop character comes forward. Still this brew is never hop forward and the malt character remains dominant. An enjoyable brew with decent depth of character yet not something that really grabs you."
"M/D: Feels great smooth and decently carbonated. The body is really well balanced. At 6.5 the alcohol is really not noticeable. This is one of the best beers I have ever had!"
"D- Seems like an IPA that got a little too much specialty malt. Pretty good, though."
"D-One bomber of this was plenty. I really had high hopes for this, but I was disappointed. I didn't feel that this beer differentiated itself from any number of hoppy porters I've had. Also, I think Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous is more drinkable despite the disadvantage in ABV."
"Decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Disclosure - I'm not too much a fan of hops, but this is very unique."
"Muddled red with some brown and black mixed in as well, looks kinda sludgey. Ring around the glass. Semi slight dots of lace, nothing extraordinary. Smell is piney, grapefruit that's sharp, semi boozy even with the low ABV, malty but not really. Taste is a black IPA alright sharp taste of grapefruit and oily hops, resonous. Some malt in the back, not terribly complex. Medium bodied, highly carbed, kinda prickly on the tounge there, bitterness is noted. I liked this stuff, it did not blow me away, but I will look for it again when Deschutes comes to Philly in 2011!! Yep, they are finally making it out east and what a better place to start than good ol Philly."
"Pours an opaque black with a tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Smell is malty with definite citrusy hops and some piney bitterness. Taste is wonderfully citrusy with a great malty balance. Feels good with some body to the beer but a nice crispness as well. Overall a very drinkable beer that I will be looking for in the future."
"Each sip will have you torn between what your drinking even with your eyes closed, as far as I'm concerned Deschutes has created a unique style successfully."
"Drinkability: This one goes down way too easy. Deschutes knows how to do dark beers and this is no exception. One of my favorites in the style and from them. I would buy this regularly if it was around here."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable. I feel the balance is a little better before it warms, but it is not overly roasty tasting so it would be easy to enjoy another of these when cold and it's not a palate destroyer either."
"Verdict: I'm loving this new Black IPA style and Hop in the Dark is a brilliant example. Full of character, easily drinkable, and not just the same old IPA, I just wish this came in six-packs."
"Drinkability - Very much would have this again. I enjoy a good combination of malts and hops that is showcased in this style of beer. 4.0/5.0"
"Drinkability- very good, I really loved this one and I will need to get more."
"Does it taste good? Yes it does. Would I want 2 in a row? Absolutely not. Is it a good beer? I think it is."
"Drinkability is just OK. This is an OK beer if you just want lots of bitterness and no nuanced hop flavors. For me I need the many different flavors and aroma of the Hop, and this beer doesn't have it."
"Bomber from Whole Foods in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Clear dark brown with a decent khaki-colored suds. Aroma is of chocolate graham crackers mixed with candied orange and tea leaves. Smooth dark chocolaty flavor with citrusy hop notes and a tannic finish. There's a lasting roastiness in the finish that pairs well with the piney hop bitterness. A little light in body, and too short in the finish, but quite drinkable and tasty."
"D - So smooth and easy to drink. The variety and complexity of this style keeps you both thinking and enjoying with every sip."
"D-I think that the lower ABV% (for the style) makes this the most drinkable of all of the BIPA's I have tried."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for sending this one my way! 22oz bomber into a Hopus tulip pours an almost opaque black with a decent dark khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a mild blend of dark malts and citrus hops with some cocoa present as well. The taste is a nice amount of citrus hops with a nice backbone of smooth dark malts that gives way to a very nice balance of crisp citrus hops and cocoa in the lingering finish, very tasty the whole way through. The beer is quite light, smooth, and refreshing with great smooth carbonation. This is a truly a delicious beer, one I would certainly have again if I could get it in my area."
"Despite this, this is still a good beer and very enjoyable."
"Pretty straight forward beer here. Pours black with a tan head that leaves substantial lacing as the beer disappears. Aroma is piney, resinous, and lightly citrusy. Also a little chocolate. First flavors are hop centric, again pine, resin, citrus at the front of the palate and than followed by some chocolate and coffee type dark roasty malt flavors. Drinks like an ipa, just a bit richer, not to bad but can be a bit unbalanced after a while."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Dark, roasted malts take the forefront, followed by citrusy hops. The beer tastes piney and rich, malty and hoppy....has some hints of burnt chocolate and coffee beans at the end.... Very interesting combination. Mouthfeel is medium with nice carbonation. Mouthfeel fits the taste well."
"D: This beer represents a good effort on the part of Deschutes to marry dark and hoppy qualities in one drinkable package. If anything, better balance could be achieved by adding emphasis to the hop bill--while certainly detectable, the aromatic hops seem one-note and not particularly characterful. The up side to this restrained hoppiness is that Hop in the Dark pairs wonderfully with savory food (such as the smoked sausage sandwich at Beachwood BBQ, on one outing). While the lion's share of recent dark IPA hybrids seem overdone, here Deschutes could give it another 10% and still be close to the mean (if that was indeed their goal)."
"I'd definitely like to see Deschutes make a 'big' beer out of this. I had an momentary criticism when I first sipped that it wasn't hoppy or pronounced as I would like, but then I remembered it's only 6.5%, and for that ABV, Deschutes really nailed it (I think there's a Freudian thing about drinking from bombers and expecting 'big' beer)"
"D - Goes down easy with tons of flavor. I absolutely love the CDA/Black IPA style and this is easily near the top of its class. Only other of this style that I enjoy as much is Krunkles. I will certainly be seeking this out again in the future."
"D: A beautiful, hoppy, malty delight"
"Drinkability: This was my first IBA. I would like to try more examples of this new style and would also hit this one up again."
"Cheers"
"Very drinkable beer and not heavy on the palate and the ABV is in check. I could drink several of these on a hot Texas day!"
"Delicious and well made."
"Its not overly hoppy or bitter, for those who are concerned. It does bring a great pine hop presence and a slight bitter coffee flavor, but it is well done."
"Too hoppy to be a porter, too roasty to be a regular IPA - it is very well balanced however you wish to categorize it. Another success from Deschutes, backed by their signature malt profile. Lovely."
"D: A good taste and but all I could think about was ""what is this?"" The color and the thinness of the beer didn't match what my taste buds wanted. Is an enjoyable beer."
"M&D: very smoothly carbonated, medium-bodied, well-balanced dark hoppy ale - a supremely drinkable ale IMO!"
"m/d-IT is a slow drinker. It has a nice body and a nice bitter bite at the end of the drink that sticks around i nthe mouth for a while."
"Drinkable> very."
"Overall does not excite me too much. It's a hop in the dark, but it is so dry that I want something sweet to go with it, like ice cream, or maybe a pecan pie."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has some very good flavors to it and they mesh pretty well for the style. One of the better Cascadian Dark Ale's I've had."
"D: well balanced mix of hops and roasted malts, something like a hoppy porter"
"Of all the Cascadian Ales I have tried this one hits the mark for me the best. Lots of dark malt and lots of hops but a smooth mouthfeel and pleasant finish. A few of the IDPA's I have tried have a dry bitterness on the finish that kinda kills the drinkability. This is close to a hoppy porter in taste but the hops really show up in the midbody to satisfy the IPA craving"
"I'm not a fan of the CDA appellation, but whatever. This guy pours a slightly translucent black-brown, highlighted in dark garnet, topped by about a finger or so of ecru foam. The nose comprises pine, maple syrup, milk chocolate, and caramel. The taste mostly eschews the darker elements in favor of the pine, but a firm amount of the caramel makes it through as well. It's almost as though this was only an IPA in a porter's clothing... This isn't to say it's bad, just not what was expected from the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a solid IPA, but I was kinda hoping the darker notes would persist on the tongue. Regardless, it is a fine IPA."
"This one has an average mouthfeel, smooth but not thin. I found this very drinkable, although the flavors are fairly subtle and probably easy to miss if consumed too quickly."
"I'm going to be sad if this becomes unavailable soon, so I'll likely stock up, and it's a great bargain. It's a refreshing brew, complex if you think about it, but you don't need to analyze this beer at all to enjoy it. It's just a really well made beer that I'll reach for quite a bit until I can't get it anymore."
"* Despite the BA label this beer is considered to be a ""Cascadian Dark Ale"""
"Out at the Grand Canyon I was finally able to get my east coast hands on some Deschutes. This one was my favorite, along with the Inversion IPA. Beautiful mix of stouty roasted malt and IPA-ish hops, but definitely lighter and more drinkable than your heavier brews. Got a fair bit tastier as I let it warm up, as well. Would definitely grab this again if the opportunity presented itself."
"D- given it's modest abv, overall smoothness, and unique flavor profile, I could finish a few of these in a session... i really enjoy this new take on a classic style and hope more brewers start delivering beers of this type"
"Drinkability: Solid, as I would expect from Deschutes -- the smell of this beer as amazing though and it's something I would just enjoy smelling for a while too. ABV is dramatically high either, so getting through all 22 oz. wasn't really a problem."
"D - I use this category to distinguish a rating based on my opinion of a good tasting beer vs. rating the beer for it's class. This isn't a session beer for me. I would definitely have another but I wouldn't drink more than 1 in a session. It's a good complex beer with a twist thats well balanced."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy light tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malt notes, chocolate/toffee. The taste is hoppy, slightly bitter, nice malt blend, a good dose of chocolate/toffee upfront. Medium body. Very Drinkable, not a hop bomb, but it sure is tasty. Well done Deschutes."
"Final Notes: A very, very interesting beer. Would go well with a wide variety of foods given that it has characteristics of more than one style. Would appeal to both dark beer and hop lovers."
"On a side note, I think this is a slightly better beer than Widmer's Pitch Black IPA. As I try more of those type of IPAs, my opinion on this beer probably will change to some degree."
"Palate offers the same as the nose, with pine being up front and then throughout, whereas the coffee and chocolate seem to come and go as one swirls the beer in the mouth. Coffee is more of a cold, crappy robusta coffee flavor though, which isn't too appealing."
"A pretty tasty beer it is a very straightforward, balanced attempt at the new style. It wasn't enough to make me drool for another one but I certainly wouldn't mind another one at some point in the future, preferably warmed to nearly room temp for the added sweetness."
"D- Very interesting take on an IPA. I dig the light stout characteristics."
"Very good beer. Great balance between roast and hop bitterness"
"D- Like I said I found myself questioning this beer at firsy but man what a delight. Could drink these all night, IMO a very clever, delicious beer"
"This is a nice beer, with an interesting combination of the dark roast and hops."
"Drinkability- So I'm not really the hugest Dark IPA (Cascadian Dark Ale...) fan but I really did enjoy this one. It seemed to be a bit more balanced and scaled back compared to others. Again, Deschutes makes another winner. Surprise, surpise."
"D: This is a very drinkable and refreshing brew."
"D - Pretty nice sipping brew, especially for those who like porters and stouts but don't want to go with anything quite so heavy."
"Dark bodied beer. Nearly opaque. Moderate sized creamy brown head. Lacing is quite full. Awesome aroma. Great blend of roasted and chocolate malt aromas with piney hope notes. Dusty and chalky cocoa powder flavor mixes with straightforward hop bitterness. Resiny and piney hop flavors come through as well. Moderate body and carbonated appropriately. Well done."
"Drink: The only metric holding Hop in the Dark back from greatness is potentially my own fault. It's too chaotic, there's too much going on at the same time. That HitD manages a 4 instead of a 3 is a construct of how fun it is to try and make sense of all the individual tastes before you're done with a full pour. However I'm not sure if I could drink more than 1-2 without sensory overload setting in."
"D= A great beer. Like I mentioned this is my first venture into the style. Really different. I've heard a lot of mixed opinions on the style and what it actually is. It's all the rage and I dunno if it fits the ""style hype"" but it's very good. I'll be exploring the style more for sure and prolly drinking a few more of these along the way."
"Drinkability: Kind of a busy beer. Lots of flavors packed in one beer."
"Drinkability is very good, very tasty, not too heavy or overly strong, this one is a definite keeper."
"overall, this is good, very good. drinks very easy. not overly heavy, pretty perfect. the hops really come out and bring this out of the dark."
"D: I could drink this all day. Great beer and I assume it is good and true to style from what I've read. I hope to try more like this. Or just drink this and nothing else."
"D - A good sipping brew, similar to Founder's El Diablo Del Noche, which I prefer."
"A pretty tasty dark hoppy ale - the Republic of Cascadia has another hefty contender for its namesake ale..."
"Now, having reconnected with reality, I understand that this is probably not something I could drink more than one of in a sitting. It is a big beer with lots of powerful and exotic flavors, but it is not overpowering; that's a noble character."
"Wonderful beer. One of the few dark beers I expect I'll buy again, while it lasts."
"overall - very good and interesting/unique. not sure I could drink too much in one sitting."
"D - Very deserving of high marks, definitely will buy again - especially since it was only $4 or so on sale!"
"D - A little heavy for an IPA, but melds the styles nicely"
"Once again, I feel this type of beer is just a gimmick and a bad trend. It just does not work, for me anyway. I have never been impressed with the ""Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale"" and this is no exception. I love Deschutes, but for once they are following instead of leading. Not something I would recommend."
"Very drinkable ale. Nice hop component but a little lacking on the malt end. I'd prefer some more dominant flavors from the malt."
"Overall a good beer. Thanks for the recommendation from Freddy."
"I liked this beer quite a bit, but it didn't blow me away. It's well done but not as memorable as I'd hoped."
"Thanks to wnoble for the chance to try this. 22 oz. bomber into a Duvel tulip. Poured a opaque black with a generous three-finger mocha head which settled to a coating. Lacing was almost non-existent as it warmed. Nose was pine and floral hops, some chocolate, and a little roasted grain. Taste was awesome - well-blalanced but hop-forward. Like most things I enjoy, there was an interesting interplay, in this case between the sweetness of the malt (chocolate and toasted grain) and the great hop prescence - tropical fruits, bitterness, etc. There were some spice notes as well. Mouthfeel was medium with moderate carbonation. All-in-all, this was a VERY nice offering I would have again - if I only could..."
"D: This isn't bad at all, fantastic IPA with a twist, nice color, nice flavors, but the mouthfeel is incredibly thin and watery, and I can see where they were going, a thin, yet black beer, but it's just a little too thin and overcarbonated for me. All in all, still a damn flavorful beer, I love the nose in this thing. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary."
"Drink: Pick one up if you get a chance, expect something different and enjoy it. I can't wait for my paycheck so I can grab a few more."
"D - This is a good black IPA. Love the west coast pine aromas and flavor."
"Opinion: This beer really works well. Floral, citrus aroma with bready, roasted malt subtlety on the taste. Great finish with no harshness; superbly drinkable."
"Pours a deep black with a thick tan head that recedes slowly leaving a little lacing. Smell defies the appearance. Malty and chocolaty, as would be expected, but also strong hop aromas, which are not. Taste continues to be in opposition to appearance. Very chocolaty and roasty flavors with very assertive hop flavors as well. I can honestly say I have never had a beer where flavors from opposite ends of the spectrum are so prominent but so well balanced at the same time. Mouthfeel was where this kind of fell short for me. Felt a little too light and watery. Overall a great brew I would definitely have again. In my opinion only an IPA in the very loosest sense of the term; however, can't really think of a category that would fit better."
"This beer pours a brown color. The head is light tan in color, and one inch in height. It recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. The aroma is of chocolate covered hops. There is some nice roasted malt character, and a lot of piney, citrusy hops. The taste is much like the aroma. The hops are aggressive, yet they are still very well integrated into the large malt profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one fine beer. I'm usually not a fan a beers that try to be both malty and hoppy at the same time as they usually turn out to be a complete mess. This beer, however, is a great mixture of malt and hop. I will certainly drink this again in the near future."
"and drinkability is good, but certainly not a session beer for a 6.5%er - well nice though."
"Overall, an interesting ""black IPA"" with good bitterness. I didn't really care for the burnt/tar notes or the cola."
"Notes: I would seek this out. Price is moderately high from Deschutes for a bomber. Six packs would be great and I would be happy to purchase a pallet to get them started. Winner."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is strong pine and resiny hops. If I didn't look at the beer, I would think this is a standard orange American IPA. The flavor is pine, resin and just the slightest bit of dark malts. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkable enough, especially at ABV 6.5%. I might not be my first choice for a warm summer afternoon, but ti wasn't terrible in that setting either. I'll probably look for this again in the winter months."
"This is an awesome beer. It's a hundred degrees in my apartment right now and usually a darker beer style would be killing me but damn this beer just has so much going on I don't care."
"Being the cascade junky that I am, this was overall a pretty dang good beer. I was a little put off at first, but the beer was just too cold. I think it needs to warm up substantially to reach its full potential. While not my favorite beer, I'd probably pick up another bottle of this in the future."
"D: The bottle calls this a Cascadian Dark Ale, which I have never had before. Didn't really know what to expect, but I can say the experience was positive. Not sure I'd go for this again, but I enjoyed the bottle I drank"
"Closest porter to this beer is the Anderson Valley Porter. Good stuff here"
"I've had lots of dark hoppy beers, but this one is truly outstanding. The alcohol is perfect for the brewer's intent, the body is full and creamy like a dark ale, but the overall impression is definitely IPA. Interesting hybrid, well done, and extremely drinkable."
"a dark coca cola pour of malt with a decent head of porter style. it has a centennial nose that is subdued that is mellowed floral soapy. the palate is bitter smokey. astringent even. has the quality of a burnt schwarzbier after it settles. chocolaty and creamy at first. but floral and acidic after a bit. i could see this being nice after some storage. had some malt issues but otherwise a consistent beer."
"D - Very good beer! If I saw this in the store for under $10 I would drink it regularly! Sweet, smooth and still gives you the hops your looking for in an IPA."
"Deliciousness ensues. Hoppy, hoppy spices and gummy tropical fruits are instantly balanced by a rich note of toasted chocolate malts and rye bread. A bit nutty, too, and the bitter hop finish lingers with ease. Mouthfeel is a tad too highly carbonated for my liking, but the crisp, dry finish fits the medium body quite well. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Deschutes does not make a bad beer. Chalk up CDA to solidifying this brewery as #1 on my list (although, honestly, they didn't need it)."
"Drinkability: A mixture of the best elements from a stout and an IPA. Delicious and surprisingly drinkable."
"D: very drinkable dark hoppy brew that is pretty well balanced between the hops and roasted malts."
"Appears suitably dark for a Black IPA. A nice tan head forms and holds for a long time before eventually settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Mostly citrus hops in the aroma. Just a faint hint of the dark malt lingering underneath the citrus. The flavor starts off with a citrus burst of hop flavors. Then the dark malt makes an appearance with some cocoa and coffee notes. Finally the hops makes a reappearance in the finish with more citrus and bitterness. Medium body and nicely carbonated. Pleasant beer to drink. A nice beer that has nice hop flavors with a slight twist of the dark malts. One of the better examples of this develping style."
"Drinkability:This cascade dark ale is an interesting blend of stout and IPA. I like this beer a lot, but I'm not sure I could drink more than one bomber in a single sitting."
"M/D- medium-ful bodied with lower carbonation. very interesting beer and drinks very well. i hope to see more beers like this hit the market. best of both worlds - stout & IPA"
"-despite the weirdness and the mouth battle going on, it became more and more drinkable as it neared the bottom of my glass"
"D: Great hoppy flavor and ample malt charachteristics yet a good balance. There's a lot to like about; I feel myself rating it higher than most...oh well."
"drinkability: just fine"
"The beer's high point is in the glass not, unfortunately, in my nose & mouth."
"Beer poured black with a large brown head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is citrusy hops with a hint of roasted malt in the background. Taste is roasted malts meets the citrus and pine hops and the hops win out in the balance department. Mouthfeel is very smooth, it has that velvety oatmeal stout consistency to it. Drinkability is good, the roasted element is there, very smooth, but in the end in drinks like an ipa! Nice innovative effort from Deschutes!"
"The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly dry, with a moderate level of carbonation. Very nice. This is a subtle beer, rewarding the drinker with each sip. I am the drinker."
"Strong hoppy aroma with prominent grapefruit and just a hint of caramel malts. Fairly high carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Intense flavor of pine and citrus followed by a touch of sour lemon. A surprisingly complex finish of light coffee, toast, and sweet caramel malts followed by more hoppy bitterness. I don't know whether I'd call this one ""balanced", but it's nicely complex and fun to drink. Very tasty!"
"Overall, another great one from Deschutes and glad to see them continuing to push the envelope. One of my favorite breweries. Highly recommend to at least once try this new style and see if it pleases ya. May to September seasonal and available in TX. Rotation - worthy of a couple bombers or so during the season. Need to hit the G-man or Saucer and get on-tap as well. [O;Y]"
"Hop In The Dark is a tasty brew. While definitely a hop heads brew, this shouldn't deter the rest. The brass hop-centric citrus quality makes a porter-esque beer into a very bright, refreshing brew. Its rare that a brew the color of used motor oil manages to be this refreshing. The Cascadian dark ale/Black IPA/Whatever seems to be here to stay. With brews like this I am glad its here to stay."
"D: I was fairly impressed with this beer. Great hop flavor with a wonderful smell, yet it looks like a stout. Pick one up if you like IPA's."
"Appearance is a darker IPA with mellow off tan head leaving good lace. Smell has a good combonation of roasted malts and floral citric hops. Taste of roasted malt with a grapefruit hoppy zing with a bit of pine thrown in. mouthfeel is medium with a good spike of carbonation going down. I'm personally not a big roasted fan, but a good IPA for those who do."
"Flavor follows nose in hoppiness yet more subtle. Moderate bitterness. Some dry roasty malt. Soft nuttiness. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"taste is hop forward, with a bit of a citrus and smoke flavor to it, and your typical black IPA slight ash flavor. Not as hoppy as the smell would indicate, but not too bad..."
"Drinkability: I find this beer rather drinkable. I like the dark IPA style, though, so that shouldn't be a surprise. Though this beer isn't perfect, it is a relatively well-executed example of the style."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. Did not know what to expect with this beer (I've had other Black IPA's and didn't really care for them) but I am glad I picked it up. A very drinkable and complex beer that was very easy for me to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor profile. Not your typical IPA, obviously, but quite good."
"Pours almost black, with mahogany tinges and a frothy tan head. Roasty, coffee-like aroma, freshened by leafy/earthy hops. Coffee flavors, slightly burnt and edgy, come through first, with a generous hop bitterness. Fairly thin body for the amount of roasty flavors, but the frothy head and excellent condition of the beer gives it a nice buoyant mouthfeel. The finish is dominated by earthy, leafy PNW hops, which leave a quenching bitterness. Toasty coffee flavors linger. A very nice beer, whatever the style-- I might call it an American porter. It strikes me as quintessentially Oregonian, and it reminds me of the dark winters I spent up there."
"I'm about to refill my glass and polish 'er off. Try this beer if you IPA's are your thing. I want to try more of these CDA's...."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"More of a hoppy porter to me, but they can call it whatever they want to."
"Interesting CDA or Dark IPA. Not nearly as big as Stone's SSR, but hoppier than Capt'n Krunkles & maltier than Yakima Twilight."
"I'll most likely buy at least one more of these while it's around but would go with a Stong Sublimely over this any day."
"Impression: Were it possible to do so without a plane ticket I would get another of these right now."
"M/D: Medium to light body. Very smooth. Goes down incredible easy. Low carbonation, what is there is really soft. Good drinkability, nice roasted malt character, some hops. A good in between stout/porter-ipa. I could see myself drinking a lot of this."
"D: Not one of Deschutes better efforts. The beer is kind of all over the place, the overall flavour isn't up my alley. I finished the bomber fine, but it sure took me a while, not something I'd realistically want more than 10 oz. of."
"D: Considering this is a Bond Street Series, and only comes in bombers, I could see myself putting a couple of these down in a sitting without too much ill effect. It goes down very easily, and is pretty refreshing on a warm summer evening."
"D: One of the few (only?) disappointing efforts from Deschutes. I really liked Stone 11/SSR, so I thought this one would be right up my alley, but it falls short."
"Good drinkability, definitely worth a try."
"I would definitely get this again, one of the best beers I have had in recent memory."
"Pours a matte black color with a foamy tan head having decent retention. The aroma and taste very much go hand-in-hand. Citrus with spicy hops up front, with a hint of roasted malt. The malt comes out more with the finish. Medium-bodied and relatively smooth. Perhaps my favorite black IPA (that doesn't have a crazy ABV). Very drinkable and enjoyable. Wish this could be more widely available, as I'd surely get it more often."
"I'm not entirely on board the CDA train, yet, but I still think this is a pretty good beer. As for the style, this seems like a strong, hoppy porter to me. There's some chocolate and caramel, but it's mostly the tangy, ashy roast flavor that I associate with porters. Hops are medium to strong for a 6.5% abv IPA and show up more in the flavor than aroma. The aroma is actually a bit milder than I expected. On the other hand, the beer is chock full of flavor. It's quite bitter with spicy pine resin and pungent grapefruit rind. The roasted malt adds further bitterness or, at least, accentuates the hops. Both taste and aroma are balanced between strong malt and hop flavors. The mouthfeel is a tad rough. I could see this beer and CDAs, generally, growing on me, but I'm not quite there yet. Still, it's a good beer, and I'll come back to it, one day."
"Pours a light black color. When held up to the light you can see a rusty/amber-brown color in the beer. Has a beautiful 1 1/2 inch tan head on this bad boy. This beer has a very interesting smell for an IPA. This is not my first ""black ipa," but this one stands out a bit. You can smell a bit of ""roastiness"" to it along with a mild hop profile. I want to say that I'm also getting hints of dark fruit and coffee. Very interesting. Wow, the taste is extremely unique. I must have been right about the coffee smell because it totally comes out on my palate, especially in the aftertaste. The unique thing about this beer is that you get the hops right up front rather than after the usual citrus fruits. This beer has a strong coffee/espresso backbone. I'm really enjoying this. You also get hit with some nice grapefruit notes that seem to be enhanced by the bitterness of the coffee. This one has a very light mouthfeel for what I'm tasting on my palate. Drinkability is fairly high. This a great version of a black ipa. Very uniquely set apart from Sublimely Self-Ritious and Bashah IMO."
"This beer totally shocked me. I didn't expect much for some reason, although I love Deschutes. I guess I couldn't picture a black IPA. The appearance was as dark brown or nearly black. Nice thick foamy head which laced down the glass. The smell was of coffee and great maltiness and a little hops, but not much. The taste is just unbelievable. It's almost like a light porter with a real bitter finish. And it sits light in my stomach. It's not heavy. I've had nothing like it and I can't get enough. It's so smooth, too. I drank a bomber and could keep going. I've got another bomber in the fridge, but I'm going to hang onto it....for a day...maybe."
"Have noticed the bottles aren't as good, but it does have a relatively decent shelf life before the hops fade. I dunno, is there some reason why the hops in a black ipa would be more resistant to aging?"
"I always expect good things from Deschutes, but this one surprised me. I've enjoyed beers like ST Iniquity, Victory Yakima Twilight, and Stone SSR, but Hop in the Dark was an absolute revelation. I found it to be far superior to any other CDA/BlackIPA/Whatever that I've ever had. I really wish I had a case of this instead of just a bottle. I'll be trying to get my hands on some more of this very soon."
"Pours dark brown with a tan head. Lots of thick, sticky lacing. The nose is packed with piney, bitter hops. Hints of caramel and coffee, with pleasant roasted malts. The flavor follows suit, with roasted malts and bold, piney hops. Moderately sweet, with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and dry, due in part to the bittering hops. Another standout beer from Deschutes!"
"I like this beer. Definitely curious to see what else Deschutes is capable of in this vein."
"Good mouthfeel, it's full and dark ale/porter-like, I compare this beer to the new belgium 1554 but combined with a mellow smooth floral hopping that just makes this an extremely drinkable dark ale. It's got a lot of flavor with not many spice notes which is cool. I think mostly roasted malt, chocolate malt, crystal as well with some combination of very earthy hops, probably cascade and maybe some amarillo as well."
"Well, this is a nice beer. Can't say I've had another 'CDA', but if this is a typical offering, I cannot see it supplanting the trusty IPA anytime soon. Good change of pace beer."
"Drinkability: Great example of the CDA style; this one (which was pretty fresh) packs everything together; highly recommended"
"overall: its very unusual I am glad I tried it. hops and roasted malt clash a bit too much for my taste."
"Overall, this beer just isn't for me. I have had much better black ipas before. It was tough drinking a bomber, but I got through it."
"Possible food pairings: I want something tart... Like a fresh raspberries and a homemade vanilla ice cream (with a dark caramel hard sugar candy... like a hard toffee topping)"
"EDIT- Bottle consumed 10.8.11. There's certainly been some adjustments to recipe, roast has been rolled back a bit which lets the citrus notes of hop shine through more clearly, taste score upped to 4.0"
"O- Very enjoyable beer, would buy again."
"Overall I like idea of this beer and deschutes executed it very well. I would drink this again....if I could ever find it that is."
"d:"
"An interesting style, indeed. What would happen if a brewery combined the hoppy pungency of an I.P.A. with the bottom-end of a stout? In Deschutes' Hop in the Dark, we have that answer. I'm not sure this is a beer that succeeds in either style, but as a hybrid, it's pretty satisfying, and definitely unique..."
"Overall really tasty. I have to wonder why they don't do it in 6-packs. If they did, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again but, at $5 a bomber, a little too pricy for a black IPA."
"Light bodied, decent carbonation, finishes dry. A decent beer, but not one I would hurry to seek out again."
"Overall a very solid Black IPA, and another winner of a beer from Deschutes, seemingly the company that can't make a disappointing beer. I think I prefer Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, mostly because of the hop profile difference, but to each their own!"
"Overall: The incredible amount of roasted presence in the flavor is very surprising when you nearly can't find it at all in the aroma. This is definitely a hop forward ale both in aroma and bitterness, but there is room left for the ""dark"" portion of this emerging style to show a presence. Sweet chocolate aromatics are a pleasing blend to the citrus hop in the nose. Roasted dryness is pushing the palate to be overly stimulated and causes a great deal of drying."
"I've had quite a few black IPAs now and this is one of the better ones. It's very well balanced in that the hops aren't overpowering the malts and there is a definite roasted character to the whole thing."
"This beer was deemed ""homebrewy"" by more than a few in the room. I like Deschutes, but this isn't one of their stronger offerings."
"This is the first black IPA that I really love! Lots of resinous and citric (grapefruity) hops, and a near perfect balance of intense roasted malt (but not burnt) with a solid background of toffee, figs, and dates. The carbonation is smooth with only a slight tingle, and the body is velvety and creamy. The finish maintains the balance, and is of lengthy duration. Highly recommended."
"Overall a great beer period. The price (4.99 bomber) makes it even more attractive."
"- Overall very tasty and is different from a lot of other Cascadian Dark Ales... overall very balanced but with a huge bitter hop presence which I like, being a hop head."
"D: Very good and def worth a try"
"We just received the new release of the Bond Street Series from Deschutes Brewery last week, and you know I had to take one home and try it the second I laid my eyes upon this tasty treat. This beer is great combination of roasted malts and intense hops. Pours an extremely dark chocolate brown with a slight bit a maroon showing up on the edges with a thin light tan head. The aromas scream IPA with intense citrus notes like grapefruit and fresh sliced oranges. You do pick up slight notes of roasted malts on the nose but it is tough to get through all the citrus. At first sip I really noticed the hops but as time progressed and the beer warmed the sweet and toasty flavors grain began to come through and actually becomes extremely well balanced. Overall this is a great beer for IPA lovers or anybody that wants to try something new."
"D: I'm very impressed by this one. It makes Sublimely Self Righteous feel rough by comparison, though both are excellent beers."
"This beer seemed a little strange to me. Like a friend that you hadnt seen in 20 years and were looking forward to seeing. But then you realise you really have nothing to talk about and cant wait for them to go back home and leave."
"Drinks: like ebony and ivory. While the name Cascadian Dark Ale is a little polysyllabic for my tastes, Deschutes has themselves a beer here that could rightly be called emblematic of the hoppy dark ale style. There can be beauty in contradiction."
"Poured into tulip from bomber. Pours dark as can be with a mahogany edge. Thick, tan head with great retention and lacing. Smell is of dark malt, piney hops, and almost a vanilla cream sort of smell to it. Very nice. Taste was superb I thought. Very rich and dark. At first you get the dark malt, almost a light taste of coffee and chocolate. Next you get the sprucey/piney hops with a bit of a grapefruit aftertaste. Very complex. The mouth feel was good, perhaps slightly light but overall fine. Very smooth and velvety with an oily aftertaste. Overall a great beer and another home run from Deschutes."
"D: All in all a pretty decent beer. I wasn't a fan of the bittering hops used due to some harshness to my palate. This may not be an issue for others. The positives are the nice citrus and pine notes that blend well with the complexity from the malts. Definitely worth a try. I may revisit this one again in the future to see if my opinion changes."
"Pours a near black, letting some light through, foamy cap of off-white head that doesnt linger long. Scent is of muted citrus, tropical and piney hops with a slightly brown sugar sweet malt backbone. Taste is a little more aggressive, a well blended concoction of the fruity hop notes and lightly roasted and freshly dried grains, neither overpowers the other. Lighter side of medium bodied, moderate carbonation, very little lingering aftertaste, slightly dry. A decent offering, well blended ingredients."
"A good mouthfeel, but expected a bit more as it warmed. I hate to say it's weak, but something is missing here. It's a darn fine beer, and easy drinking. Not sure what separates it from IPA, other than the color. Does color really separate us? :)"
"22oz bottle $5. Dark black color with a mocha head. Smells slightly hoppy but a lot more malty. Tastes like black butte porter with a bit of orange from the hops. Overall this just wasn't hoppy enough for me like most of Deschute's IPA's and pale ales. For hoppy dark ales I would much rather have a Stone self-righteous ale."
"Finally found this one in Denver. Pours a very dark brown, almost black color (looks like a porter) with a nice, bubbly light brown head. Nice aromas of roasted malt, along with piney hops, bubblegum and citrus. The aromas translate well to the palate, with a good roasted malt background, complemented nicely by the piney/citrusy hops. Although I much prefer the oxymoronic black IPA moniker, this beer was still quite enjoyable."
"Overall, a decent example of a style that's still finding out what it's about. If you live in Deschutes distribution area, you'll be seeing this soon and can decide for your self."
"O-This very drinkable. A good beer, and nice interpretation of the style. I wish this were a year round beer."
"The mouthfeel feels a bit light for such a dark brew, but the style has to be remembered. Still, a little more viscosity would be appreciated."
"Worth a try - just didn't come across as great to me."
"Drinkability is very good. For a dark beer, this one is quite refreshing."
" OK I lied, Its a hoppy porter, I don't care what the brewer says."
"D: For as complex this beer is, it's very easy to drink, even on a hot Summer day. Could easily be one of my favorite offerings from Deschutes. Well worth trying."
"Other comments: This is one of my top 5 favorite beer styles at the moment and I'm proud to live in the Pacific NW, where it originated. And I firmly support the CDA naming convention as opposed to ""Black IPA""."
"taste is smooth, chocolate, a touch of coffee, roasted malt, some smoke, and a little dark fruit, ends creamy and nicely bitter."
"drinkability - well crafted and balanced, big flavor for an IPA"
"Hop In The Dark C. D. A.--Cascadian Dark Ale--Bond Street Series--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 70 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Thin mild lace tan head. No sediment. Clear dark black bronze pour color. Aromatic pine grass floral hop light roast front. Mild sweet resinous hop debittered light roast dark malt IPA body. Rich balanced hop spice mild citrus end with dark chocolate hint. Very tasty but hard to describe. Sampled. 5/29/2010. 2 @ $4.79 Each."
"It has a pleasant medium body with strong carbonation, but does not become over bearing. This is a very drinkable brew, and I do plan on picking it up again soon as I have yet to find such a well balanced mix of hops and malt."
"D - This is very good. The PNW really has been putting out the dark IPA recently, I always really enjoy them, but too often they are so hoppy you never get the flavor of the dark malts. This brew is perfectly balanced, its floral and sweet. Great beer!"
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
