"The Black IPA from Green Flash is a good easy drinking Black IPA.  The beer poured a nearly opaque with thick white head that left a very nice lace.  The scent and taste carry a roast and pine flare.  The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall this is a good Black IPA."

"Overall: I am drinking this beer about 10 days after the best by date so the hop flavors are not likely what the brewer intended; still, I find the malts here just a bit too charred and, when compared to the Lagunitas NightTime I had just a few days ago, this beer comes up short"
""
""
""
"This has proven to be one of my least favorite styles, but this brew is better than most. Appearance is great, black beer with thick off-white creamy head and lacing. The nose is straight up hops, but the taste does have some malt supporting the hops. Oily mouthfeel. Very good beer."
""
"O - Still not a style I regularly grab for, but this was a great attempt."
""
"Roasty, with fruity specialty malt character. Floral hop flavor, with an almost buttery toffee backbone. The finish is lightly charred and fairly bitter. Citrusy hops accent the buttery sweetness well. It's a bit of an odd combo. Roast overwhelms hops."

"Generally not a huge fan of black IPAs, but this is a home run. Fruity, malty, hoppy... Jesus, what more could you want. Green Flash Black IPA converted me into a believer. A well-balanced attack on the senses. Love it. (Granted, it's a sipping beer -- you really don't want to have more than one or, well, two.)"
""
""
"O - nice black IPA. I'd try it again if I could get it on tap or get a fresher bottle. Regardless, it's still really solid."
""

""
""
"Overall this is one tasty brew; definitely give it a shot if you come across it!"
""
"O-Not as complex on the nose as some, but very enjoyable example of black IPA that isn't too far on either end of the malt/hop spectrum. Would buy again."
"O: Easy drinking basic black IPA."
""
"overall a solid black ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A thick tan head atop a dark brown and cherry red brew. Has an aroma of subtle, earthy hops that are superseded by a wallop of roasted malts. Tastes of spent grain, blackcurrant, caramel and oily hops. Medium bodied, well-balanced and smooth, but falls slightly short in the flavor category."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Probably the least of my favorite in the Odyssey lineup. A well made brew no doubt but I guess I just expect better from Green Flash. This comes off a little uninpsired and a bit thrown together to me. Any notes of bright citrusy hops here are washed out by the darker roast. There are much better offerings of the style available. I just wish they would have made a black West Coast IPA. Seems like a no brainer to me."
""
""
"O: An unbalanced beer. Certainly has its charms, but there was something left to be desired."
"O: A rock solid black ale. I would have no difficulty recommending this beer to any fan of hoppy ales."
""
"Light black in color and it will allow some like to make it through if held up to light. Easily an inch thick tightly knit light beige colored head. Brussels lacing. Wonderful aroma of piney hops and dark malt. The hop taste actually seems pretty tame compared to what I'm getting from the aroma. This is still fairly bitter with piney hops,but that dark malt backbone is very apparent. Mouth is a bit thinner than I would have imagined. The flip side of course is that it's not as filling as a typical IPA at that ABV."
""
"Deep and serious BIPA. Makes 21A Back in Black – which is not a bad beer – drink like Grape Fanta. Nuanced and technically superior."
""
""
""
""
""
"All those hops jump out in the flavor to overtake my taste buds while the dark, sweet, licorice malts remain low but balanced. Lingering bitterness at the finish. A good hoppy black IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An awesome black IPA. What can I say..these guys know how to brew some amazing beer. Well done!"
"Light to medium bodied with modest carbonation for the style. Not much aftertaste. A decent beer, but not as good as the best in the class."
""
"Overall a very hoppy and delicious, but somewhat stouty, black IPA."
"O - impressed to say the least. Recommend any day. Cheers Green Flash!"
""
"This is probably the best Black IPA I've ever had. Hop-forward and delicious. Nice job, Green Flash!"
""
""
"Overall - love the style, so I'm not surprised that I like this so much, but This was better than expected!"

"A very balanced and full flavored black IPA with a creamy mouthfeel but a nicely lingering bitter pine finish. It really held up nicely for several days in the growler and I loved the combo of bitter pine and toasty malt on the finish. A very solid effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I love it. What I would expect from one of my favorite brewers of hoppy goodness."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Pores a pretty much black body with one finger tan head and left lace patches. The aroma is mostly piney, citric hops with minor roasted malt notes in the background. Full bodied and slightly chewy, the hops are strong and this beer is more hoppy than malty, not that the balance is totally askew. The roasted malts are evident and there is a slight biscuit feeling along with sweetness, but mostly I get the strong hop presence in this beer. I really like this ale as I prefer black ipas that are hoppier than what is usual of style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyway, this one pours a mostly clear dark orange edged dark brown with billowing tan colored head. Big pillows of foam clinging to the glass, with a half inch of head staying for the remainder. Smell: pine, grapefruit peel, dried apricot, toffee note. Taste: sugary into roasty and caraway notes quickly overtaken by pine and grapefruit peel. It's over quickly. Nice example but not a standout for me. Best by 7/21/14."

"Body is medium but drinkability is pretty high. Finish is smooth roastiness with a bitter tinge. Overall it's Green Flash, which is about all that needs to be said."
"Not a great black IPA, low hop presence and overly charred malt. Decent enough. The fruity esters from the yeast are also bothersome. I prefer a bold citrus hop profile to stand out from the dark malt, here is just blends and falls flat. See FW Wookey Jack, Deschutes Hop in the Dark and Knee Deep Midnight Hoppiness for better representations."
"Overall - A nice black ipa. The citric hop kick gives this a west coast style ipa flavor that works nicely with the malts and coffee aspect. Smooth, balance is good and full of flavor. One of the better black ipa's out there."
""

""
" Overall I love it. What I would expect from one of my favorite brewers of hoppy goodness."

"Very enjoyable beer here. Easy to drink considering its bite. Worth consideration!"
"I would love to see this enter the lineup."

"O - Very good Black IPA, the aroma is great, but the flavor dips down to more of just straight hop flavor, which is disappointing."
"Drinks easy, a nice Black IPA; not the best but one I might revisit"
""
""
""
"Two thumbs up. A black IPA that I can enjoy again."

"M: Medium bodied. Thinner than expected from the appearance."
"O - 4.25 - This is a great black IPA, and at 6 dollars a bomber it's a good deal. I wouldn't be suprised if it has magnum and simcoe in it, it tastes very similar to a black IPA I homebrewed a while ago."

"As a fan of black ipas and Green Flash, I was quite excited to see this on my store's shelves. It pours a deep black with a generous off-white head that gives way to a nice film but little lacing. The nose is a beautiful balance of citrus and pine hops and roasty coffee and caramel malt aromas. It sips quite light and very clean and crisp. I actually had hoped this would have a little more body to it. The flavor, while delicious, is not as good as the aroma. The hits with a very west coast hop bite, lots of citrus and pine. Then comes on with the roasted malts. The finish and aftertaste is coffee and bitter chocolate. There is a nice balance but I almost feel it could use just a touch more sweetness. It is definitely one if the hoppier black ipas that I have tried. Not my favorite black ipa or Green Flash offering but damn good."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 7/21/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings aruound the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, orange zest, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, pineapple, mango, orange zest, grapefruit, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange zest, cocoa, toast, light roast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with light-moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice black IPA. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Flavorful, citric, hoppy with dark malts. Fine stuff. Hops keep flowing in wave after wave, continuing citric notes, more and more orange on the palate. Perhaps a bit thin mouth feel wise. But its a minor point, as this is super tasty, and west coast hop forward goodness. Highly enjoyable and a must try."
"O- nothing special here. Flavor was a bit muddled and refrained."

"O: A very nice example of the style. Nicely balanced between the roast and hoppy notes, with neither really dominating. The bitterness is nice and restrained but definitely present. Quite easy to drink as well. Definitely worth trying"

"Green Flash is a top ten brewery for me no doubt about it, this one just didn't work."
"Overall: Nice Black Ale that I would certainly have again, but while the breadth of flavors is impressive, some others examples of the style have greater depth."

"Raw hop character in a black IPA format, the appearance is cola brown with ruby highlights, big tan head forms thick, rocky texture. Aroma has pungent citrus peel and dark roasted malt layers combined into one, goes great with food. But my ideal IPA is citrus fruit grassy and clean the muddled alpha acids with dark roasts just don't work as well as your typical IPA without the dark roasted malts. Flavors have the dark chocolate notes with herbal, herbaceous dank weed, and grapefruit peel bitterness heavy in the backend finishes dry without much finesse. It's just hops and dark bitter roasted malt without much poetry between the two, gimme a porter or an hoppy IPA in place of the hybrid any day. Mouthfeel is resinous with hop oils it even makes your nares burn with the combination. Overall I can't wait to try something more approachable in the Black IPA department, this is good but I know there could be better versions out there."

"I had high hopes for this beer and it really on delivered for the aroma and smell. I wouldn’t have it again"
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Black IPA. Pretty hop forward with a nice juicy and oily bitterness. The dark malt presence is good as well."
"pours black, minimal head on a medium pour. looks like iced coffee pouring out. aromas of hops very light, with some smoke(?) in the background. taste is very bitter, much more pronounced than the smell, with a gritty hop bitterness that is very piney and resin-y. maybe a little coffee in the flavor also? for the 7.2% abv, this is extremely bitter. not a great brew, but drinkable once to try. I wouldn't purchase this one again. I suppose some like this this, but i'm not a fan.... definitely would prefer a Wookey Jack over this."

"Interesting herbal flavor. Bitter with leafy hops, something like arugula. Very bitter aftertaste compromises the pleasure. A lot of scorched malt flavor. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach."
"22oz bottle $6.99. Looks like a stout, maybe a bit brown at the edges. Aroma is roasted malts and oranges. Flavor is exactly the same with maybe a touch of chocolate in there. Personally I find this style one that us rarely executed well and this is no exception. I would not purchase this again, it would be much better to save a buck and buy a Firestone Walker Wookey Jack."

"Overall, this is a great take on a black IPA and it is worth a try."

"Overall one of the more solid cda's I've had. Glad to finally do a proper review finally, glad to see this gem in a bottle"
"Unfortunately, it's not as complex as the nose suggests.  Lots of dry bitterness but this comes more from slightly acrid and roasted dark malt.  Tropical/citrus notes from the aroma aren't really showing up on the palate.  Sticky and resinous hops with grassy pine needle followed roasted chocolate malt, oatmeal, coffee bean and burnt toast.  "

"Had this on tap in Arlington, VA. Pours a nice golden color with minimal carbonation at the head. Smells of pine and grapefruit. There's not much there in terms of the taste. You have the pines and grapefruit, but it's not as clean and there is no hoppy bite on the back end."
"Overall, a really good black IPA. There are so many different variations on this style but Green Flash has really nailed it with this one."
""
""
""
"O: Real good stuff; I like an American Black Ale like this, with nice roasty notes and then big time hop bitterness. For perfection, it could use more chocolatey malty notes, but overall this is good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite black ipa's. Roasted grains and a sharp hop bitterness really lends itself nicely."
""
"On tap at The Malted Barley. Pours a dark brownish black with over an inch of frothy tan head. Some lacing. Great piney aroma with some roasted malts, floral hop notes, and pine oil. The taste is more of the piney hops along with roasted malts and some dark chocolate. Floral and pine bitterness at the finish. Oily mouthfeel. Bitter chocolate aftertaste along with pine. Roasty flavor throughout. Overall, fantastic Black Ipa That reminds me of their West Coast IPA . Most I have encountered have more of a citrus hop flavor but this is a great piney Black IPA that I'd seek out for sure."

"Overall - Classic West Coast hop profile. It's quite similar, in fact, to their West Coast IPA except with the addition of roasted malt, and while I'd prefer a stronger roast malt presence, that's not typical of the style. What's there is solid. One I'd certainly give another go with, especially if Green Flash decides to bottle this in the future."
""
"O - A solid beer, but the only thing that makes this a ""black IPA"" is the color (and slightly fuller mouthfeel). In other words, if I was blindfolded, I would think it was a full-bodied ""standard"" IPA."
""
""
"O: This beer is very interesting as it has a nice mix of citrusy and piney hops combined with hop bitterness. It's definitely a West Coast Black IPA."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light beige head, good retention on a black body. Sticky, soapy lacing. Aroma dominated by piney, resinous hops, some faint roast flavor in the back but clearly way hopped. Taste follows suit with strong bitterness, grassy, dominating. Some coffee and some roasted malt flavors but really hop showcase. This has Green Flash written all over it and its awesome."
""
"Scored the growler at DeCicco's (Brewster, NY) last weekend and poured into the pint glass chilled this shows a very dark ruby edges mahogany color. The head is thick and light tan in color, leaving a substantial layer of lacing. The nose hit is full of bright citrus, grapefruit and orange with a twisted pine quality in there for good hop measure. Just a vague malt complement comes through as well. Very nice. The first taste sensation brings brilliant citrus but blends nicely with a brown bread cereal malt. The dominating theme remains the rather sharp hop flavors but there is a clearer note of some malt and even a licorice nuance with a sort of minty outcome. Just delicious if you favor hop character in your IPA's. This brew is easily medium bodied with a smooth, somewhat luscious feel. Carbonation is a bit dainty but provides an effective tingly sensation on the tongue. Great results here for Green Flash!"

"Pours a clear super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, citrus zest, and slight cocoa. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with more of an emphasis on hoppy versus roasty aromas and flavors."
