The nose is a mixture of citrusy, spicy hops and a toasty malty profile. Flavor is what you might expect based on the smell; west coast hops - grapefruit and pine resin - melded with a roasty, toasty, slightly nutty, biscuity malt taste. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an inactive, slightly creamy carbonation. Overall, definitely a beer I could curl up with on a cold winter's night, or anytime for that matter - good one by NB","gmfessen","Apr 18, 2013"

What is that ""Midnight Wheat""? Need to find another beer with that to help nail down the flavor. The body is not heavy, good mouth feel. Looks like a ""Coke"" with much smaller bubbles. Nice Lace. For me, it's a perfect balance. Just the right amount of assertive hops, and a good combination, the Centennial/Cascade and Styrian Goldings and dark malts. Finish is dry and crispy. I think I would drink this in the summer too. Never reviewed a beer before. Hope I don't sound noobish.","artk321go","Mar 04, 2013"

Lacing is good. Aroma has slight Belgian malt sweetness with floral, somewhat grassy hops, and some baker's chocolate. The chocolate comes through in flavor right away, slightly bitter, followed by earthy barkish metal. The bitter hoppiness is earthy as well. I'm guessing English hops such as fuggles are used for bitterness. Feel tends slightly toward watery and finishes dry. I would never put this in the same category as Sublimely Self Righteous or other Black IPAs, but its definitely not a winter warmer, considering its formidable use of hops. This reminded me a bit of 1554 but a bit brighter. I'd have one again. Which is good considering I got a variety 12 pack with three more left.","Philousa","Feb 27, 2013"

Roasted nuts, cola, carob, toffee, weak diner coffee, sourdough. Hop bitterness is balanced evenly. Pithy citrus with a punch of earthy spice describes the hop flavor. A nice beer to throw back on a late winter afternoon (with snow in the forecast). I was expecting something more akin to a Black IPA/CDA, instead this is more like a well-hopped American Brown.","bump8628","Feb 24, 2013"

The mouthfeel is maybe the only weak point of the beer it has a thin body with a medium body on the swallow, but im not gonna fault this beer at all for a small thing to me like mouthfeel.

A ton of floral notes and a nice fresh citrus. A really choppy aftertaste and feel. Not bitter for a hopped up beer. I found the feel to be a tad thin and sort of spicy.

3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass the color is nearly black with almost no light penetration. Head was about a finger of beige with fairly nice lacing as it dissipated slowly. The smell was not what I expected. Very hoppy but lacking the maltiness portrayed by the color and head. The beer has a nice feel in the mouth with a crisp hoppy finish. Leaves a slightly flowery citric aftertaste. Almost like grapefruit. The beer is surprisingly light and drinkable considering its dark color. Overall another excellent product by New Belgium.","Donnelj","Jan 01, 2013"

Nice aroma of piney hops, roasted malt, somewhat earthy with a hint of holiday spices. Interesting, unexpected flavor dominated by piney and grassy hops, light toasted malt. Flavor is deceptively light, but displays a fairly complex range of herbal and grassy hop flavors with a light sweet malt base. Medium bodied with a decent creaminess. This is a different approach to an winter ale leaning towards herbal hop flavors. I liked this quite a bit.","LiquidAmber","Dec 28, 2012"

What I liked the most about the beer was the balance it really highlighted the flavor of this beer and it looked very good. What I liked the least about this beer was how similar it was to their Red Hoptober, the malt base tasted pretty much the same. but this one tasted a little less hoppier, but it smells just about the same. I would buy this beer when in the mood for the style, but as far as winter seasonal beers go I would rather have Sierra Nevada Celebration, I do recommend giving it a try though.

This ale poured a dark black color, produced an off white head, decent retention and left behind above average lacing. The aroma of this ale consisted of malted grain, caramel, and spicy hops. Medium in body, a foundation of toasted grain, floral hops, raisin and spices. Smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry. Nice session beer- Wouldnt mind having it around on a Snow Day.","GossageBrewery","Nov 07, 2012"
4.33,18.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall – A solid beer. The dark coloring fools you into thinking about the normal chocolate/coffee note normally associated with a beer this dark. Due to the midnight wheat, these flavors are down played while the caramel notes come through. The hops are present but not overpowering. This is defiantly not a dark IPA which is a good thing.","pb9613","Nov 06, 2012"

Nice pour with a decent amount of sandy colored head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves a thin film of head and Brussels lace up the side of the glass. Very malty aroma, some floral notes from the hops, but not very much. Root beer aroma, some coffee from the roasting and some grass from the hops. Tastes predominantly sweet with some bitterness on the back end, but not much. Definitely more of a dark ale than a winter IPA like some of the Pac NW winter beers. Well-carbonated and nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a very enjoyable beer and glad I got a sixer of it.","PacNWDad","Nov 05, 2012"

I think that they could’ve safely pushed the ABV even up to 9% or so without doing any harm to the characteristics of the beer. Sipping it further, the hops start to dominate a bit, so perhaps the malt could’ve been left a bit more room to breathe. Anyway, it’s an interesting enough take on a Winter Ale, with clear influences both from Belgium and the hop-friendly US brewing scene.","Arborescence","Feb 16, 2012"

It reminds me of a little, black IPA, so really a black Pale Ale , though really it reminds me of a hoppy Porter; it sort of reminds me of Avery New World Porter, though this isn’t quite as roasted as that beer. The burnt note that this beer has seems quite distinct compared to what is usually found in a roasted beer and it has me wondering if the distinctness is because this beer’s roast character comes from the roasted Midnight wheat. Not a bad beer, I think I prefer 2° Below Winter Ale quite a bit more than this one though; Snow day has the roast and hop character clashing enough in the finish to add a touch of harshness (and this is accentuated a bit by some warmth from the alcohol.","Gueuzedude","Feb 14, 2012"

The smell and taste alone vault this beer into the above average category, and the added touches of spicy carbonation and a non-invasive head push it even higher in my book.

Almost a peppery, coriander-like smell, but not in a white ale sort of of way. It's weird. I have smelled it in other hoppy beers, is it the Goldings? Anyway, the taste is actually pretty toasty at first, some faint dark chocolate taste, followed up with a citric hop twang, and some of those spicey, coriander style hops. I mean, maybe it is their strain of yeast, they do call themselves New Belgium Brewing. The mouthfeel is fairly carbonated and not extremely smooth.

3.43,-6,3.5,3,4,3,3,"New Belgium Brewing Company seems to be with us on this, with the newest release in a cycling seasonal line up, Snow Day. This brew pours a very deep, dark brown, with flashes of ruby, all contained under a thin, small-bubbled head which provides a good lacing throughout. Always adventurous, New Belgium incorporates a new brewing malt, Midnight Wheat, which leads to some caramel and chocolate in the nose, as well as less than subtle hop tones. A medium to light body is rounded out with average carbonation. A roasty-toasty flavor meets the pallet, with the chocolate again appearing before hops come in to steal the show and linger in the finish. At a less than modest 6.2%, this American Black Ale is tasty as a winter warmer, and even better on a cold snowy day.","phishsihq","Jan 07, 2012"

Taste is grassy and citrusy hops up front with a prevalent roasty and chocolaty backbone. Mouthfeel is lighter than one would think but fits the style. Ironically I was in the mood for something hoppy but decided to go with a seasonal since there's a limited window, I was pleasantly surprised to find I had gotten the best of both worlds.","alli4051","Jan 05, 2012"

Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a huge 2-3 finger dense light khaki head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap eventually. Some nice thick lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, grapefruit, pine, and spiciness. Damn nice balanced aromas here; definitely hoppy, but they have a nice roasted malt backbone as well. Taste of big orange rind, grapefruit, pine, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, and light chocolate. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, pine, caramel, and spices on the finish for a bit. Super hoppy in the taste, making the roasted malts a bit invisible. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily at 6.2%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish present. Overall this is a damn nice black IPA. I was hoping for more roasted malt presence in the taste. I would have this again.","superspak","Jan 01, 2012"

The aroma of this brew fails in all departments whether you consider it a winter ale/warmer or a black ale. The nose is quite unpleasant and unfitting of any style of beer. The taste is somewhat fitting for the black ale style but doesnt fully come together for me. This brew is medium to light bodied, favoring a bit to the medium side and it has a moderate level of carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well integrated but overall this is not something I would enjoy having more than a sample of.

The nose comprises light mandarin orange flesh, light vinyl, very light roasted malts, pine sap, and light lemon rind. The taste holds brings in more of the same, though the vinyl is gone, replaced by a touch more roast than before. The orange is more prominent, but doesn't stand too far out from the darkness behind it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

I chose a New Belgium Snow Day, looking forward to something new. And it was an entirely different experience. I did not expect the nearly black color and thin off white head. This beer has the look of a black ale, rather than that of a winter warmer. Great aromas come off of this brew, lots of malty sweet smell and a big dose of coffee. Was it the look that made me smell the coffee? A roasty malt flavor greets you on the first sip, and there is some subtle bitterness to the finish. The Snow Day has a big body to it. Very good special or dessert beer, you will not down a six of these in an evening.","iSip","Nov 07, 2011"

Malt makes it's way into the picture in the aftertaste- but not much of it there. This beer almost makes me pucker the way eating a lemon does. It's not bad... just not as balanced as I'd like.

The head was thin with creme color and light lacing. The aromas was nice and hoppy, not quite as hoppy as New Belgium's Hoptober ale but still strong. A nice subtle caramel malt note crept in behind the hops. The taste started off as citrus and pine from the hops and faded to the caramel of the roasted malt in the after taste. The feel was full of carbonation and tickled the palate. Overall this was a better balanced beer than Hoptober. The roasted wheat malt made more of a nice compliment to the hops. While the use of only three hops, versus five in Hoptober, didn't over whelm the malt. New Belgium did good on this beer.","Rantingfury","Nov 06, 2011"

The first few sips of the beer the malt, roast, caramel, and slight coffee grounds were present. As I continued to drink the beer the centinnial hops on the front and casscade on the back began to take over. The mouthfeel was great....medium body and decent carbonation.

Sadly, this was not the best ""winter"" beer to begin with. If I were to grade this beer simply by how it tastes, it would be an average to decent black IPA. However, I am supposed to review it to the style it claims to be, and, in that, this beer has failed. While the appearance has a nice head and deeper color, the aroma is consumed by hops. The flavor of the beer tastes like a black IPA, not a winter warmer. The mouthfeel is not heavy enough, and the warmth from the alcohol is not really there.

Spicy, herbal, oily hop greenness over pine, berries, and a whiff of dark coffee. Piney hops upfront...pale fruit and a bit of char.

The flavor was just weird to me and it felt too dry and chalky.

4.28,17.3,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"My new favorite session beer. I'd categorize this as more of an IPA/Dark Wheat hybrid. The only tie it has to the winter warmer style is that it's a winter seasonal.","UnionMade","Oct 24, 2011"
3.91,7.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"NB has really been surprising me lately. I was starting to put them behind in the ""interesting beers"" race, yet everything I've tried recently is nice and impressive.","JoeAmerican77","Oct 24, 2011"
4.47,22.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - what can I say? I really enjoyed this beer. Of the few winter seasonals I've had so far, this is far and away my favorite. I do have to say that I enjoy this more than I recall enjoying the Two Below (not that it was bad at all). I didn't realized how hoppy this brew was going to be when I purchased it; if I had known, I might have shied away, but I'm glad I didn't. I nice hoppy beer hit the spot on a cool late fall day.","lawlerj","Oct 22, 2011"
3.85,5.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O - A very good brew from NB, hopefully they're able to continue down this path! This is definitely not a winter warmer... Recommended.","chugalug06","Oct 21, 2011"
3.7,1.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The hops dominate the aftertaste, but it's ok. It's not annoying; I rather like it.","VncentLIFE","Oct 21, 2011"
4.12,12.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall - I enjoyed the every process of drinking this winter seasonal beer by New Belgium. From the pour to the last sip. I bought a variety of the winter beers that just arrived on the shelves and this was by far the most unique and pleasurable to drink. I can’t wait to get another six pack come the first snow fall.","mkruz","Oct 21, 2011"
3.71,1.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Feels medium in body, briskly carbonated, and actually wetting to the palate. Not a bad go to winter warmer.","TheSarge","Oct 20, 2011"
4.06,11.2,3,4.5,4,4,4,"A fine winter warmer and a big departure from Two Below. Could be classified as a black IPA.","NStLincoln","Oct 14, 2011"
