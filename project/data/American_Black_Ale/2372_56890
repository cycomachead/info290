Beautiful jet black body with a inger or so of off white head. Not a big nose on this one, but some bitter chocolate, and dark malt, and a hint of licorice were there. Not a big hop nose at all, and it would seem as though this was v. fresh (11/14/14 enjoy by date). Nice flavors of coffee up front, with a nice bitter middle note, as well as a nit of a floral hoppy taste as it warmed up. For a Black IPA, maybe just a bit lagging on the flavor complexity... wanted a bit more hop flavor to balance the nice maltiness and appropriate amount of bittering. Great mouthfeel, reminiscent of a nice porter or BIPA. Overall, a decent beer, but I would likely chase down a Self-Righteous or NightTime if the options were available. Decent grade for the style.","Mikus","Jul 23, 2014"

4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"22oz bomber shared with mrmanning, StephenRich, Chris, and Erin. Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black, with a thin cap of beige froth and strings of lacing on the tulip. Complex nose is chocolate, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, perfume, floral hops, baking sugar, and coffee grounds. Quite appealing. Taste is roasted malt, burnt toast, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, grassy and leafy hops with a lingering, citric bitterness. High IBUs are evident on the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy-foamy upfront, fuller than medium bodied, bitter hop bite precedes a drying finish with some roast, cocoa, and flaked oats on the cough. A satisfying Black IPA, balanced compared to others that I've tried but no less enjoyable.","cratez","Feb 08, 2011"

3.9,3.2,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Split a bottle with my boy Kolby whilst chilling at the Library in da Burgh. Did I mention the Library has a rockin' happy hour twice a day. This big bottle poured with a pitch black dark cola vibe, forming a big tan head fill the glass with lacing spread fine and evenly between sips. Aromatics offer up dark roasts with a creamy malt accent, herbal green undertones a touch of pine and citrus as well. Flavor has herbal tea tannins buring dark ale with hopped up bitterness in the backend. Strong alcohol finish for the 7.5% alcohol, I was a bit confused with this aspect. Assertively hoppy a bit hop but nice dark roasted malts work oaky with the combination of the two. Mouthfeel was medium bodied healthy dose of carbonation carried things across the palate a touch cloying at times but this beer had no time getting down our gullets. Solid drinkability, I was hoping to find this on tap, but never did catch it flowing in the Burgh.","WVbeergeek","Nov 28, 2010"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D - Enjoyable, but not particularly complex. The malt is kind of one dimensional with some notes of caramel and moderate roasted notes. The malt is subdued enough to the hops shine through, but it does impart a bit of dark flavor that brings out the pine and creates notes of blue cheese and mustard. This is a nice example of the style with a particularly pleasant hop character.","nickfl","Nov 15, 2010"

3.67,-2.9,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Sampled this at Savor 2010. Poured black, slight mahogany when held up to light, with a thin off-white head, less-than-stellar retention, and average lacing. Smelled heavily of roasted malt, as well as some cocoa powder, sweet orange, and modest lemon/orange zest. The taste revealed lots of orange/apricot citrus, evolving to balance out with some caramel/chocolate/roasty malt, and then finishing on a sweet orange note, with only a modest note of dry peel. Not much carbonation, and medium-bodied. A little too sweet for my taste; it would benefit greatly from some more bitter/dry balance like some other black ipa's I have tried.","donniecuffs","Jul 28, 2010"

It pours a pretty much opaque black-brown topped by a couple o' fingers o' healthy tan foam. The nose comprises a nice bushel o' fruity hop aromas, with ruby red grapefruit leading the way, and some smooth, semi-toasted caramel coming through as well. The taste begins heavily in favor of the grapefruity hops; as the hops fade into the background, the caramel steps in, along with a touch of light coffee. The finish has all of these elements take a bow as the music slowly dies away and the lights gradually come down. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and rather creamy feel.

This one is pretty heavy on the roast, while the hops are here in full force, they seem one-note in comparison to the vastness of the malt.

There was hint of chocolate, but I had to inhale pretty deeply to detect it. The dark malts definitely were present in the taste in the form of a coffee like bitterness, which supplemented the already bitter grapefruit peel hop presence. There was little bit of toffee flavor, but this did not provide enough of a counter balance. The finish was spicy and slightly astringent. This felt edgy and lacked a lot of the smoothness in the mouthfeel. I prefer some sweetness to go with the IPA bitter flavors, and sadly this lacked it.","rajendra82","Mar 27, 2010"
4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I am not a big fan of the Hop Karma (India Brown), and I am in the minority apparently. But this is good stuff. Just the right added dimension to the hop-bomb formula. This has one of the biggest hop profiles of any Terrapin beer, yet it is quite drinkable and even pairs well with a spicy Mexican meal. Well done.","firkinhophead","Mar 26, 2010"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours very dark brown with a decent head that fades to a thick swirl atop the brew. Smells of spicy hops and some sharp malt- almost like there is some rye in there. The taste also seems like it has some nutty, grainy, sharp rye notes as well as some black patent malt dryness and light roastiness along with bitter chocolate notes. Nice hop accents of pine and citrus peel. Firm, bitter, and full, but dry mouthfeel. I had a Brooklyn cocktail earlier in the evening made with a particularly earthy rye. This bears more than a passing resemblance to that. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I like the dry richness and bracing bitterness.","Georgiabeer","Mar 24, 2010"
4.3,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The 10th installment in Terrapin's Side Project program pours a deep, opaque mahogany with a big and fluffy beige head with great retention and lacing. The aroma starts with some light fruity citrus, oranges and lemons maybe, and some resinous pine. There is a nice backbone of dark roasted malts to help balance out the hops, but the citrus is still fairly prominent. The taste follows the aroma pretty well , but there is a bit more balancing of the orange and grassy hops by the backbone that the aroma suggested. The dry roasted character of the malts balance the hop bitterness of the finish.","JMC_TM","Mar 21, 2010"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall this was an above average beer not because of the flavors but because of the way they played off of each other. This may be the most well-balanced Black IPA I've had (though there aren't all that many). Worth a shot.","glid02","Mar 19, 2010"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"6.99 @ Green's....no abc listed on label. Dark brown pour into a Duvel glass. Light sandy brown froth, quarter inch. Bright aroma of navel orange, roasted malt with subtle whiffs of nestle quik powder & black licorice. Very balanced up front, with zesty citrus meeting creamy roasty malt. Hops really kick in a few seconds later...minty orange zinger. Comes back to malty & citric bitter with a chalky mouthfeel. Dry bitter finish with pretty nice drinkability.","RustyDiamond","Mar 18, 2010"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The only other dark IPA I can compare this to is Yakima Twilight which has a bigger hop presence, but I also really like the chocolate in the Capt'n Krunkles.","elgiacomo","Mar 18, 2010"
4.07,7.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D:its a slightly higher than sessionable beer to me only because its quite bitter and my mouth cant take more than one bomber of that. its flavor has a lot going on considering you can taste the "dark" and the unusual hoppy together. I dont know what the percentage is but if it were a bit fuller body i would enjoy it more but still a tasty side project","chefmikeanderson","Beers"
4.23,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I enjoyed this one a lot and I'm glad I got to try it super fresh as the hops are the dominant player now. Honestly, I'm intrigued to see what happens as the hops die down as I bet this turns into a completely different beer. Not sure if it'll be this good, but I look forward to finding out.","gford217","0"
