"Pours to a black color with brownish-red tints when viewed against light.  The head is a pale cream color with minimal retention.  Delicate lacing left on the glass.  Some hop-like aromas up front, but with a definite malty character.  The flavor is a near perfect balance of malt and hops.  The carbonation and body are ideal.  Feels great going down.  I've had much of the catalogue produced by Lakefront, but my first time trying this one.  They do a great job with a lot of different recipes and didn't disappoint on this one.  Reasonable price too, 6-pack for $7.99"

"O - Not a bad take on the black IPA style, but certainly not the best. The hop character is definitely old-school pine and grapefruit, which isn't a bad thing and is actually kind of refreshing these days. However, the body isn't robust enough to give balance to the hops. While certainly worth a go, IBA is noticeably inferior to Lakefront's wonderful IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Could be a bit bigger, but it's a beer i want to turn my friends and local brewer (CARTON) on to. Good sign. Must try."

"Quite good. An excellent everyday brew. Priced just right at $9/6-pack (way overpriced at $5 for the bomber). Too bad it's not available year-round, as it would be a welcome hit of sweet roastiness in summer, while still refreshing with its lighter body and crisp carbonation. Another very good Wisconsin black ale. Nearly as good as New Glarus Black Top and Radio Free IBA (Lake Louie), but those two are a cut above this one."
"Recommendation - An excellent, easy to find IBA in either 12 or 22oz options."

"Overall: This is a very easy drinking ABA, with a very nice flavor profile; could be a bit bigger and would love to see Lakefront brew an imperial version of this beer"

"Complex, rich and delicious! I've found that sometimes there's a clash between hop bitterness and roast here - not with this one, though both are present. Great choice of hops and malts here! Very well-done! Great example of the style!"
""
""
""
""
"Nice moderate carbonation and body."
""
""
"O - Spice up your American IPA with a little dark malt for a pine-and-chocolate beer that finishes with just enough bitterness to add bite but not control all the other flavors."

"Overall this is a pretty good black ipa. Relatively mild for the style but it has a nice balance. Very drinkable."

"Poured bomber into 34oz mug. Jet black in the mug, showing dark brown in light. Thick, tight fluffy white head that isn't huge but is really beautiful. Smells of lighter roasted malts and piney hops. Taste is big on roasted malts, sweet caramel and bittersweet chocolate, with hops coming in towards the end for a bitter and dryer than expected finish, but it's still wet and a bit sticky at the end. A great black ale, although I'd like it hoppier. Mouthfeel is amazing though, creamy perfection."
"Man, this is a great brew. My favorite Black IPA to date. Smooth, hoppy, bursting with flavor, but not overwhelming."
""
""

"Black, and topped with a medium-sized tan head. The beer is enticing, and the smell is of slightly roasted grain, some malt, and medium-strength herbal hops. The taste is more intense than the aroma. Powerful, balanced, and dark. The beer has a great roasted, dark malt flavor, backed by hop flavor and bitterness, both are proportional, and the result is excellent. The body is full and creamy. This is a very enjoyable brew."
"giving this the benefit of the doubt slightly, because I've had it before and it was much better."

"O - A black IPA that definitely leans more on the hoppy side, but still manages to bring along some black ale malts. A solid brew that I'm glad I picked up, and one that certainly will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - definitely please with this, the dominant flavors of piney hops and nutty malt are contrasting yet well balanced, props to andrenaline for sending this out"
""
""
"O: one of the best black IPAs I've had. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would happily add this to my regular rotation."
""
"This is a nice and easy to drink black ale. The hop tones are there and stay pretty smooth. It's not all up in your face. Could have a few less wrinkles in the profile, but no matter. This is a nice drinker. Always happy to try something by Lakefront."
""
"Overall- A pleasantly light and crisp ale, more balanced than expected. Stays away from the treacly sweetness many dark American ales suffer from. Well balanced, and each element has its turn to shine. Recommended."

"I poured the Lakefront IBA into a wine glass because that was all that was available to me at the time. The result was a new-found love. The manilla colored head poured perfectly and the glass allowed for a wonderful bouquet to emit from the glass. Lakefront's IBA is no hop bomb but a delicious balance of subtle hops and approachable black malt. At 6.5% it is still sessionable enough to consume on a hot hot day. At the same time it leaves a hoppy resin on the back of the palate. Will buy again. Cheers Lakefront."

"Overall, probably not one I'd get again."

"This beer pours brilliantly clear very dark brown with a mahogany glow when held to a light and a sticky, thick off-white head. The aroma is highly hoppy -- mainly citrus, pine, and floral. The flavor is much like the aroma, strong hop flavor--pine and citrus zest with solid hop bitterness. The malt presence is detectable, mainly bittersweet and very subtle roast, but certainly is second fiddle to the hops. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and the beer finishes with lingering nutty malt and citrusy/piny hop flavor, especially as it warms. The carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a solid offering, could there be tweaks to make it incredible, like a tad more body, sure, but I won't complain!"
""
"Not bad. Poured at a good temperature with a decent tan head that lasts a little whie and good lace. Color is perhaps clear to slightly hazy depending on the width of the glass and a dark garnet. Aroma is hop, malt, dark ripe fruit, roast. Flavor's somewhat like nose where I pick up those qualities, but also a whole set of complementary characteristics as well - a bit smoke, fairly dry, good carbonic tang, earth. Body is odd but good and carbonation is spot on. Finishis is like flavor, a little long and astringent."
"Really wish they sold this beer in 6 packs, I absolutely love their take on the IBA. This beer hit the spot, I will definitely be on the lookout for more of this beer. They are definitely one of the leaders of the pack in this style in my book."

"Black with some visible light passing through. Small head, but decent lacing. Aroma is a combination of piney hops and licorice. Decent amount of carbonation gives it a lively mouthfeel. Flavor is a good balance between the spicy/citrusy hops and the molasses tinged sweetness. Nice bittersweet finish."
"O-Very drinkable and refreshing. For the style, I take it almost as a Lite beer in as nice a way as possible."
""
""
"It could have gone farther, which might mean more ABV. Feels like they were trying to make sure the combined beer style would go together very well. This beer is very easy to drink given the profile and flavor. They did a great job with this one. Definitely worth trying but don't expect an aggressive approach. The more I got through the bomber, the more I started to enjoy it and the flavors and aroma started to show. LFB is in my back yard and reasonably priced, will be having some more."

"O: A bit uneven in spots, but still worth a look. Drinkable."
"Hoping this will keep up the streak of Lakefront's 22oz bottles being far better than their core lineup (minus the IPA and Fixed Gear, which they just [deservedly] started putting in sixers). Pours a nice deep brown color with two fingers of off-white head. Aroma is full of citrus hops, with a bit of roasted malts in the back. The taste is very good, it's got a very strong hop presence that separates this from the ""hoppy porters"" of the world, with some highly roasted malts and coffee providing a bitter supporting role. The mouthfeel is very IPA-like, with just a bit more body than the average one would have, and the drinkability is very good. Another great one from Lakefront. If they keep putting out great new beers, they are going to go places in the craft world."

"O: very nice beer. Good example of the black bitter beer, whatever you want to name it. Tasted in series with my homebrewed BIPA and this is the beer I'd like mine to be."
""
"O - A really good black IPA, and an exquisitely balanced one at that."
""

"Perhaps the fastest-growing beer style to date, the American Black Ale. Lakefront did not play around—black as black, with a killer lacing. Slight roast in the nose with a thick blanket of soft hop resin and faint ripe fruit. Minty and tobacco aroma. Moderate-sized body, more than enough smoothness to go around. Smacks of hops, but with a smat- tering of roasted grain and ripe fruit, this beer is more complex than just darkness and hops. The hops do, however, provide a pretty intense trail for the taste buds to follow. Minty hop finish with some lingering roastiness. The brewer definitely has a firm grasp on this style."

"Overall: A very solid beer. Wonderful balance of floral hops and coffee grounds. I didn't think those two flavors would be compatible, but Lakefront Brewery seems to have mastered it. A unique and Outstanding beer!"
"Have to admit I was ready to jump on the oxymoron bandwagon. Didn't think I was gonna like this but I do I do."
" ~ This is a very drinkable beer. I would certainly recommend it to friends, and for the price ($5/bomber) you can't beat it."
"overall, one of the better examples of this ""new style"" that I've had."
"Drinkable, crisp the hops brighten it but the flavor are a little muddied giving a sense that this was close to being a top tier beer but just missed"
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin."
"Overall, this is pretty good and worth trying. There is something about the flavor that is odd that I can't put my finger on though. Maybe it's the spiciness... Still pretty tasty though."
"It is not bad but feels like something is missing, perhaps a bit more malts and hops as it all feels a little watered down."
"Finally got the chance to try this one. Very dark pour, with a good, creamy head to finish it off. The malty aroma and taste kept the hops from becoming overpowering. This was a very smooth beer. The hops/malt combination in this beer made for a very pleasant offering from Lakefront."
"Mouth and Taste: This beer has a crisp mouth feel to it. The smokiness of the beer comes trough with the taste, as well as the mild hoppiness."
"D - A decent nose to it, but light on the flavor intensity, though the sweet light toastiness with hints of molasses and pine is a great flavor profile. Very good, and very drinkable."
"Overall- I am glad I tried it. I do love black IPAs and wasn't disappointed to say the least! Cheers"
"o- would make a great morning beer. I am going to buy a six pack. Wonderful"
"Maybe these beers are available in smaller bottles but I've only ever been able to find the large 650 ml bottles. This is a beer I would rather take in 12 oz. increments."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"I really like this style, whatever they decide the name will be, and I had really high hopes for this. Unfortunately this is lacking the complexity the style requires to pull it off. You need an IPA and a dark flavor component to both present themselves in time, but this was one dimensional throughout. It was drinkable, but the flavors seemed muddled and muted to me."
"Lakefront IBA (India-Style Black Ale) combines smoky, chocolaty porter qualities with a wet, autumn leafs-like hoppiness to make for a beer that is as multi-faceted as it is drinkable. It combines the most agreeable aspects of dark beers and hoppy beers into a one lip-smacking ale. If the style is new to you, this Wisconsin offering is a good place to start out."
"Poured out like a porter almost. The head was creamy tan in color and the beer itself was a dark brown. The head on the beer leaves a pretty good lacing down the glass. The smell isn't overly hoppy or anything. It's got some roasted malts in the back ground. The taste is nice, it's got a pretty decent amount of hops and malts working together. The mouthfeel was nicely carbonated and had a good drinkability for the most part. Overall this beer was pretty good, not the best black IPA out there but worth checking out."
"One very solid IBA(ABA) by Lakefront. This is something they should be doing more often with their future brews and this ""IBA"" is exactly where one opens doors for such a thing to happen..."
"Overall: For me, it seemed a bit muted, a bit muffled, and just held back from its potential, in terms of malts, the hop flavor, and even the body."
"The flavor actually brings the black malt out finally. Good balance and drinkability although not terribly adventurous. A bit light, although the ease of enjoyment is quite high. Herbal hops include notes of citrus and menthol. Patent malt finish is nice, with a slight cola note."
"O - Tasty IPA with a roasty twist, high drinkability due to the balanced sweet malts and bittering hops. recommended. B+"
"O: This is a good beer. I've been on a bit of a black ale kick lately, and the coincidence of the style showing up in this variety pack is a welcome thing for a Monday. This is the third of the four that I've had from the ""88"" sampler pack, and no disappointments yet. Better pick up another before they are gone."
"Poured a black body with a nice tan, rocky head that was well retained and dissipated into a small cap that lasted throughout the beer. The beer gave off a nice pine hop aroma. The beer had a nice, more of a roasted malty taste than expected, but with citrus hops to note. Seemed pretty straight forward. The beer had a medium feel to it with a nice dry, somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall, a very drinkable beer and one that I will probably buy again."
"Drinkability was good. Not overly bitter. Good blend of flavors with no signs of ABV."
"Overall, really bland flavors that don't do anything for me. Weird annoying aftertaste, with mediocre flavors, makes this nothing more than average. What a shame, I was really looking forward to this, too."
"Spot on Black IPA good aroma, the ast, the hops. Cascadian. Above average mouthfeel. Black body with foamy bubly white had. Orange and hoppy an roast flavours. Citus, malty, chocolate. Bit burnt, bit acidic.Very kosher inspected beer.Thanks for sharing Ken."
"Cheers!"
"This is a pretty good beer. I'm happy to have tried it. I wouldn't say that it is one of the greats, but it was a good deal when the four pack was only $16."
"Aroma is rather hoppy and has a yeasty undertone. It pours a barely transparent chocolate brown with a respectable, if not persistent, beige head. Flavor is hoppy, slightly bitter, slightly honey-sweet, with a smoky hint. Texture is fairly smooth, a teensy thin and only a little bit fizzy. Overall, nothing special, but not too shabby and worth a try."
"D: Solid by example, hoppy, fairly smooth."
"Stouty impression at first, dominant black roasted malt, with lingering herbal bitterness and citrus rind. The dark roastiness and citrus peel bitterness mesh well, finishing clean and dry. The hop bitterness lingers momentarily in the aftertaste, as do the roasty elements. Best at room temperature. The body is lighter, yet the stouty roast malts give it some heft. I'd really like to try a fresher bottle of this, as it has potential, though falls a bit short of the ""genius"" claimed on the label..."
"O: Nice offering. Can't say that I'm wowed by this one but I like it. I'm excited to try some more Black IPAs in the future."
"D - This is a well crafted and very well balanced brew. I think this could very easily be a daily drinker...I would stock it as such in my fridge anyways. Worth a shot if you can get your hands on it!"
"O – Drinkability is very good, hops and malts balanced well and both in play nicely, the musty/earthy factor is not appealing to me. 3.5"
"Like many craft breweries, Lakefront is all over the map when it comes to quality. Holiday Spice Lager, Riverwest Stein Beer and IPA on the top end. Pumpkin Ale and Cherry Lager on the bottom end. IBA is almost as good as IPA, which makes me glad that it's available locally."
"Picked up a bomber from Abe's for $4.50 and split it with a fellow hophead. Gotta say, while this is a fine example of the style, it doesn't stand out. I feel like I've had this beer before from other brewers. The beer is dominated by a dry, spicy cocoa malt and citrus hops mixture that's satisfying, but could be deeper. It comes in a big flavor hit instead of slowly developing from start to finish."
"The mouthfeel was thinner than expected but it had adequate carbonation. Just a bit hollow."
"Another impressive beer from Lakefront. In fact, this is one of the few black IPAs to successfully marry the elements of a good porter and a good IPA together. Well done."
"D - Not bad. I like the mouthfeel and there's little ABV presence. The smell and taste are a bit straightfoward and basic."
"D: Very drinkable, perhaps dangerously so a 6.5% ABV"
"Drinkability: 50 IBUs, a medium body, and tons of hops make this brew a great way to end the night."
"I'm a big fan of Lakefront and the beers don't come any fresher than here in Milwaukee, but this one leaves something to be desired. I'll say again that by no means is IBA a style I'm an expert in--on the contrary this is my first--but it seems to me to be a little counterproductive. Maybe it's an aquired taste? I'll just have one more bottle..."
"Finish: Malty hops stick around for a bit"
"Not sure if I've had any Lakefront beers in the past, but this one caught my eye at Argonaut Liquors the other night (maybe the $5 price tag?) Poured a deep mahogany color with a good three fingers of khaki head on top. Good hoppy aromas up front (grapefruit, orange, pine) followed by some roasted malt. Medium bodied, with flavors of roasted malt, chocolate and earthy hops."
"D: Easy and satisfying drinker. No problem grabbing more of this around town."
"This beer pours brilliantly clear very dark brown with a mahogany glow when held to a light and a sticky, thick off-white head. The aroma is highly hoppy -- mainly citrus, pine, and floral. The flavor is much like the aroma, strong hop flavor--pine and citrus zest with solid hop bitterness. The malt presence is detectable, mainly bittersweet and very subtle roast, but certainly is second fiddle to the hops. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and the beer finishes with lingering nutty malt and citrusy/piny hop flavor, especially as it warms. The carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a solid offering, could there be tweaks to make it incredible, like a tad more body, sure, but I won't complain!"
"The Pure Milwaukee Genius of Lakefront Brewery strikes again...A very pleasant Black IPA with great drinkability. This brew is a very nice balance of hops, citrus, earthy, and is lead by some outstanding roast dark malts. Unique and adventerous good brew from Lakefront!"
"D. Sky high in drinkability. Goes down easily and is very satisfying. I could see myself finishing off two bombers without a problem. This is a beer that would work well year round - not overly heavy for summer drinking but still packs enough body and flavor to work in cold weather. Well done - up there with IPA in terms of flavor and drinkability."
"The mouthfeel has an overall airiness, but gains enough traction in the mouth to give itself substance and definition. It's on the low side, alcohol-wise, of the style, and drinkability is, without a doubt, its strong suit. It's assertive in its flavor, but not aggressive. Hoppy, but balanced. Basically its a hopped-up brown ale even though that's not the trendy way to label it. Regardless, it's got some charm and it's damn drinkable. I'd like to see this in sixpacks, as it demands that sort of mass consumption."
"Taste: Roasty malt and hops. Simple flavors but it's tasty stuff. I could drink glass after glass of this all night long."
"(D)- Definitely a solid black IPA. Not overly bitter or hopped; has a nice feel and smoothness to it. Well done Lakefront!"
"I am keeping in mind that this is inaugural release. I am confident that by this time next year Lakefront will have worked out the kinks in this recipe and I will be editing this review to reflect a beer that I can enjoy with pride."
