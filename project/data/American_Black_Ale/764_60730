The smell was okay with a bit of yeast on the nose and a bit of the hops. The taste was okay with a bit of pine and then a clean finish. I found this beer to be a bit forgettable to be honest. For a black IPA it's very good, but then again it's not a style I point out to others that often. If you're a fan of the style, give it a try and you might be surprised, others may want to try something else first.","WhiteHillsStore","Feb 24, 2014"

3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a slightly above average example of a Black IPA, it wasn't bad at all, but I found myself wishing that the malts were more rich, bolder and roasty and I thought the hop profile could have been a little more complex and impart more hoppy flavors, but it's far from the worst Black IPA and I would say that as a whole it's pretty solid. What I liked the most about this beer was that it was fairly true to style and it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the hops and malts weren't bolder, I think they were both a little weaker then they should be. I might buy a can of this when I'm in the mood for a Black IPA and I would for sure buy another one if I knew it was really fresh. I would recommend giving this a try if you like Black IPAs, but I don't think it's a stand out in the style. All in all I thought this beer was solid, it wasn't the best or the worse of the style, but it didn't have any off flavors or anything that was too far off for the style. Nice job guys, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Feb 02, 2014"

The hops are primarily of the floral, grassy, leafy variety...the more it warms, the more bittersweet, dark chocolate takes over. Tastes of grassy, dried fruit, earthiness, cocoa, and molasses. The malt seems thinner here and there's not enough hop flavor to justify the bitterness. The cryptic code on the bottom of the can isn't a clear date, so I have no idea how fresh this is.

There's also a substantial amount of hops that balance everything out. The strong pine flavors are very well integrated. The mouthfeel is fairly highly carbonated and medium bodied, and the drinkability is fantastic. Overall, Toxic Sludge is one of the better balanced Black IPAs I've had.

Pours a solid dark brown color with ruby highlights and a huge creamy tan head that persists forever leaving lots of stickiness to the glass. Smells slightly ashy with a hint of wet cardboard on top of light chocolate and earthy floral hops. The nose is kind of disappointing for a black IPA really. The flavor is a bit better with a solid malty chocolate mixed with an earthy spicy hop flavor. Firm but pleasant hop bitterness rounds out a caramel butterscotch malt sweetness quite well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy mouthfeel. Decent beer that I could drink, but middle of the road and honestly not worth purchasing again.","johnnnniee","Feb 22, 2013"

3.68,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/15/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense light tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, floral, grass, light pine, toast, and brown bread. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; much weaker than I expected for the style. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, cocoa, roasted malt, pine, toast, brown bread, light char, floral, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, roasted malt, chocolate, pine, brown bread, light char, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of flavors with a nice malt/hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Black IPA offering. Good complexity and balance of flavors, and very smooth to drink. This was not as robust as I expected for the style, but it was still a pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

The inverted Glug revealed a highly suspicious viscous liquid and I had to wait for it to settle before proceeding. I had a dense finger of light-brown foam that seemed destined not to go away until I deployed my flame thrower and burned it off. Color was a deep ruby-red with NE-quality clarity, enabling me to see all manner of mutant creatures swimming around in it. I began to wonder - if Minhas products have turned me into a Cyberman in the past, what effect was Toxic Sludge going to have on me? There was only one way to find out and so I charged ahead, taking my first sip of the day. Mouthfeel was medium and I could feel the creatures tugging on my tongue as they tried to get purchase, but to no avail. They slid right down my gullet and into my stomach where my mutant stomach acid instantly dissolved them. My Minhas-mutated bodily systems were too much for Toxic Sludge! I had a feeling that such might be the case, but now, I am sure of it. I laugh in the face of The Toxic Avenger! Bring on Godzilla! I liked how the minty hops really held their own on the nose. One of my principal complaints about the style is that it seems to negate the best of both worlds with the malt overtaking the hops and the hops dumbing down the malt. Not so here. This was quite drinkable and I got plenty enough hoppy bitterness to keep me happy. The dark roasted malt added a charcoal bitterness that enhanced, rather than overwhelmed, the hops. The finish was quite dry and if I had to drink a Black/Cascadian IPA, this is the one that I would prefer. Remember, kids, get it in the CAN!","woodychandler","Jan 10, 2013"

Aromas of roast, slightly charred malts with a spiced, cedar hops profile. Flavors of char on the forward tongue, with rich, resiny hops following quickly behind it. Peppery and oregano spiced, with a cedar and pine pitch overtone. Very spiced aftertaste, with a resiny linger. The body is surprisingly light, but not crisp, which felt odd for the style. Roasty, mildly resiny linger in the finish, which is carbonated bubbly and short-lived.","GarthDanielson","Dec 25, 2012"

Not much in the way of hops which are mosty earthy. Although the flavor is very well balanced I feel both the malts and hops are understated. Hops are earthy, caramels dn hint if chocolate for sweetness on a roasted malt base. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, nicely balanced just feel the malts and hops are a bit weak with too simple a hop profile to be considered one of the better of this genre.","kylehay2004","Dec 25, 2012"

The taste followed along with the nose, it wasn't overly complex but still had a good flavor to it. The mouthfeel of this beer was a little light, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was a little more like the oil that they're trying to stop from harming these animals.

Not a big fan of the hop profile, doesn't seem to be the same as hoptical illusion. The roasted malt comes through more as the beer warms and helps the flavor out.

The taste was much different...very caramel toffee coffee flavor with a semi-sweet finish, and coffee aftertaste. Medium thickness, and no carbonation. I wasn't expecting as much coffee and sweetness in this 'black ipa' specimen; I'm more accustomed to the earliest progenitors' examples of this style, which are much more citrus in nature.

A huge roasted malt backbone is checked by a subtle but equally large and complex hop signature. Roasted coffee and yeast rich bread give a touch of chewiness. The hops blossom from the super velvety and somewhat creamy carbonation that is integrally bound to the flavor profile. They start earthy, moving to pine and finishing with grapefruit. The roasted malt and burnt caramel envelope a yeasty breadiness that has a touch of english fruitiness. No alcohol at all. Finish is dry and short with a grapefruit and hop oil flourish lingering gently. Getting back to feel, there is a softness that reminds me of the Hoptical Illusion from a cask with nice heft and girth to this one that give a satisfying richness to the drinking experience.
