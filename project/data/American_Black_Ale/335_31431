4.06,9.7,5,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, 2014 bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice crisp bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 20, 2014"

And indeed they should (especially at $4.99/bomber). That said, it does lack the rich mocha notes and muscularity of the style's best examples which makes it a somewhat incomplete example. Still, I definitely enjoyed it.","biegaman","Oct 28, 2013"

The head is at least a finger thick and is leaving a lace. The smell has very fine hoppy with pine leaning tones. There is not much in the form of roast or malt. The taste is a bit bitter than I would prefer from a black ipa....would like a bit more roast and malt to start and then let the hops clean the pallete. The beer has a light to moderate body with smooth carbonation. Overall it isnt bad....but definitely not the best. I like the flavor with the lower abv which makes this a potential session brew.","WoodBrew","Oct 31, 2012"

These are good on a pizza, but bad in a beer. This was accompanied by the sensation of a strong licorice taste. For an IPA, the hops were rather mild. If it did not say IPA on the bottle, I might not have guessed the style. The mouthfeel was thin, making the experience end quickly. This was help along by the blast of carbonation which probably caused the bottle to foam over in the first place. Obviously, this was not a well balanced beer.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 11, 2012"

The taste Is similar with some lightly roasted malts, grapefruit, and a mild acidic quality that seems very out of place. Not a whole lot of hops or roasted malts or coffee for that matter.

Nose is, err, off to say the least, latex band aids, significant dose of roasted malt, hops negligible in the nose. Taste is fairly roasty, hard to get by the aroma, but there's a pronounced lack of Cascadia hops, the label mentions Centennial but having a hard time detecting much else.

There’s a blast of bitter earthy hops up front with hints of soil and pine which is countered by some sweet citrus. The citrus character isn’t as strong as the nose suggests with faint hints of grapefruit and citrus rind. The dryness from the hops is complimented by the deep roasted malt flavor. Hints of coffee bean, dark chocolate, burnt toast and licorice. Overall this was okay but not the best of the style.

A very interesting think here, hard to classify but certainly worth looking at. Big thanks to BAs macallister and pixel for sharing this with me!","Bierguy5","Jun 30, 2006"
3.68,-0.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A smokey dark chocolate roasted malt quality. Hints of caramel help balance the rough edges of the chewy hops. The beer drinks more like a hopped up porter than an american stout. The rough tannins of the hops do hurt the mouthfeel somewhat.","mcallister","Beers"
4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Deep mohagany pour with black in the middle. Medium but durable tan head atop. Smells really roasty and sweet with a nice hop twinge in there as well. Roasted chocolate flavor with some herbal qualities. I really liked it. Tasted similar but wasn't quite as enjoyable. This still was quite good. Stronger roasted flavors, almost smoky at times, but they are tempered by the piney flavor of the hops. I always thought Hatter would be solid with a more stouty profile and I was right. Give it a try if you're at the pub.","granger10","0"
