"Pretty nice beer. I have been overlooking Rogue entirely too much."

"I really liked the smell. I couldn't stop sniffing it. To be honest, this tastes very much like Guinness without the hydrogen. It's a thirst quencher, with maybe a bit more to it. I liked it a lot. I would get it again if I got it for the same, overstocked price."

"Good pairing with grilled flesh."
"O: quite distinct, very interesting and well-crafted, with a good sweet/bitter balance, However, neither the aroma nor the flavor profiles were entirely to my liking. As intended, I guess, excellent with Asian cuisine. From memory, more interesting but not quite as enjoyable as Rogue Morimoto Soba Ale. Not a fruit/vegetable beer!"
""
"Overall- Well, I haven't had the other Rogue Soba ales, but this is making me think I should have. Pricey, but worth trying, particularly if one is interested by beers that are whole or in part brewed with gluten-free grains."

"I thought rogue was through making these, so I was super excited to see this on the shelf. the pour is jet black, inky and thicker, with a hard to control rising off white head that has a mind of its own. it smells like burnt toast and a really weird malt profile. had to google it to learn soba is Japanese buckwheat, which definitely provides some interesting smells and tastes here. its sort of like rye in terms of smell, bold and fully rich, but the flavor is much more mild, without the spice and with a starchy sort of feel. with the other black roasty malts and bittering hops, I think it works great in this beer. there is also a new yeast going on that's foreign to my palate, or maybe its just the buckwheat again, hard to tell, but its pasty in texture and bitterly bland in a good way of that's possible. a complex brew with an exceptional mouthfeel. huge body and plenty of carbonation, it really shocks the palate as something different and well done. I like this better than the imperial pils, and fully support anything involving chef morimoto, his work in the kitchen is unrivaled."

"Overall: an interestingly different but ultimately disappointing beer, especially considering it came at a cost of AU$15 a bottle (2013). I simply can't justify the cost for a beer that is alright."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
""

""
""
"This beer was a bit off for me. It had a nice flavor, similar to a brown ale, but it wasn't full flavored enough for me. I wish it had been a bit more assertive. It may be worth a try, but I won't be trying it again."
""
"Morimoto Black Obi Soba Ale version. Poured a dark brown with an averaged sized tan head. Aromas of light roast, nuts, and caramel. Tastes of nuts, some dark fruits, and caramel. Nutty. Malty sweet with a very light bitter finish. Tastes and aromas were both on the subtle side. Body on the thinner side. Some lacing left on the glass."
""

""
""
""
"To be honest, I poured it out half-way through. Hopefully, we had an old bottle or something, because it was just not enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This tastes like no beer I've had, and if I was blindfolded, I'd be hardpressed to call it a beer. Doesn't really taste like me, provides no hint of alcohol. It's not bad, it's just not close to good. More or less a waste of $8.99."

"O: This is a pretty solid little ale, but one complaint that I have is that it really lacks any sort of recognizable buckwheat flavor until the finish. Even then, this flavor only comes across very briefly. To me, it makes no sense to make a buckwheat beer that neither smells nor tastes all that much like buckwheat. Still, this one doesn't taste bad and is solidly constructed, so I can't fault it too much."

"mouthfeel is lighter side of medium with firm carbonation."
"O: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s ok for something different but there are other similar beer I would choose first."
"D = This was ok. It is listed as a fruit/vegetable beer, but I can't place anything outside of a black ale, although I don't run across soba very often. I don't think I would seek this one out again specifically, but I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me."
"O - not sure what soba is, but this beer definitely has a unique flavour profile, complex yet easy to drink"
"For what it's worth."
"O - A tasty dark ale that's easily drinkable and offers some unique flavours. That being said, it's not something that would make an lasting impression."
"O- Great session beer."
"Not over the top in any aspects, just a decent easy drinking beer. Would probably be better sold in a cheaper six pack option."
"Not my type of beer. good in his way! different but good!"
"There's a stout element to the flavor of dark, unsweetened coffee. The body is very thin with a high carbonation. The aftertaste is all burnt malt flavors, no notable hop."
"O - Decent for 3.5% ABV but very plain."
"The aroma was pleasant, albeit a little lighter then I was expecting. Nice touches of molasses and maple syrup weighed in heavily, though the spices seemed to be all but covered up under a bit too hot alcohol profile. The flavor though started to redeem itself quite nicely. Rich notes of maple syrup and molasses washed over the tongue immediatly, falling into a spiced yam like flavor that was layered on top of a nice bready malt profile."
"This wasn't really all that I had hoped. A bit muddled and somewhat tough to drink."
"O- Good beer, I will have a gain. Well rounded and a nice sweet balance of flavor that does not get sugary or artificial tasting."
"Opinion: This beer had me going up to the first sip, and then it fell apart for me. I liked the look and aroma quite a bit, but the aggression that they used on the hopping really killed this beer. It is so light, however many IBUs they added was probably about double the amount necessary for this beer. This beer was delicate enough that they didn't need to do that to it...but whatever. It is what it is. An overly bittered beer with some interesting notes in the aroma that aren't able to shine through in the flavor. I won't need to go back to this one."
"Not the biggest fan of this one. I had this one right after the other Morimoto Ale and found this one to be a little awkward. The pour looked good, had a deep brown color similar to a black lager but with a super sized head on it that was tan in color. The lacing was pretty good too. The aromas were mixed on this it has grassy aromas and some herbal notes. The taste was a little strange. I'm can't really explain it. I just tasted gross to me. I was able to finish it but I won't being buying this again."
"D - Quite drinkable, would be more so if the carbonation was dialled back just a little."
"M/D: I like the melange of different flavors here using those specialty grains/malts. Complex tasting, but not heavy at all. A unique beer worth a try."
"This is a good brew and it does go well with pork as stated on the bottle."
"A highly drinkable, enjoyable brew. Another winner from Rogue."
"D: Great serious food beer. Could be served at fine dining establishments or just with great pub food."
"O - Definitely give this a try."
"D: I could probably drink a lot of it because it is a little watery, but I would not go out of my way to get another bottle."
"D: Quite unique, but I'm not sure that it really does it for me. I definitely like certain aspects of the beer, but I'm glad I'm splitting the bottle."
"D - Given the ingredients used this ale turned out well. A nice curiosity but nothing I'll be drinking again soon."
"This is a really complex beer, not sure if the other Soba ale from Rogue is at all similar but now I have to go try it to compare. This beer is many different styles combined at once, they clash, but not in a bad way. I have never been so intrigued and pleased at the same time, especially from a beer under 5% ABV."
"Flavour is the same with roast beef and molasses. Add some indistinct fruit and a fine carbonation. This is really enjoyable and complex. I found it hard to place but thoroughly liked it. A pity it's deer in Oz."
"M&D: quite clean on the palate, while the finish features a faintly powdery texture; med-bodied, reasonably flavoursome, this is a very drinkable brown ale that never goes quite thin or watery."
"D: great. A touch on the sweet side but could pound this all day."
"All in all, an interesting brew that lends itself well to light food and cheese pairings. Great with fresh chevre and pain au levain or cream cheese and a bagel."
"D - Not terribly drinkable. A little on the heavy side and the flavor doesn't lend itself well to drinking a lot or frequently."
"Was a decent pairing for sushi, but better for the octopus salad. Would definitely get again over the typical Sappro or Kirin."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable... the flavor is pretty unique, and with the low gravity it doesn't punch hard. Drinkablility is above average."
"This beer is smooth and nicely carbonated with a clean finish - medium bodied. I would definitely try it again."
"D - interesting brew that goes down easily. not totally sure how it all fits together but I wouldn't mind trying again."
"Overall Impression: It was impossible to pour this beer without excessive foaming, and since the head retention excellent, that was an issue. The high carbonation killed this beer in mouthfeel and drinkability as well. That sucks, because it had a pretty interesting flavor. I'm hoping this was an isolated incident."
"that said, it's a bit pricey...why?"
"I was very pleasantly surprised by the flavors I found in this beer, and quite enjoyed the nut flavors and it's over all drinkability."
"Drinkability: Not as impressed with this as the other Morimoto ale from them. I think the taste here seemed rather muted throughout. The smell is good but after that the ale is just ok. I will not be buying this again at the price."
"While this is replete with a flavour that I don't get much exposure to (the Yakisoba noodles that I indulge in frequently bear no relation to this), I still quite enjoyed the light, roasted, and nutty nature of this beer. Not quite sure what style of beer this is, as the vegetable/herb classification seems way too pithy and general for such an interesting offering."
"Tastes like buckwheat pancakes dipped in a so-so brown ale. Somewhat of a nutty complexity that I enjoy. Typical Pacman mouthfeel."
"OVERALL: Decent beer and drinkable enough, but I'm not sure what I think of it. I enjoyed it enough, and I get the feeling this beer is exactly what it was intended to be, but I'm not sure if I'd really want it again. Glad to have had it though."
"Beer poured a pretty dark brown but not too dark to see through with some light. Practically no head except when poured hard. Fairly smooth, not overly carbonated so pretty easy on the tongue. Nothing overwhelmingly present that really stands out but some mild fruit flavor, mild hops, and what seems a slight spice flavor. Low in alcohol so between that and the easy taste the drinkability stays at a decent level. Wouldn't be a problem to have a few. One of Rogue's better offerings I would say. I will be revisiting this brew and recommend it to anyone who likes slightly fruity beers."
"Just like the OG Morimoto Soba Ale, Black Obi is a wonderful and unique beer to enjoy, especially with food. Its definitely earned its black belt. Roasted buckwheat -- different but ultimately successful."
"This beer was poured into a mug and was pretty attractive. Dark brown with some red highlights, a thick tan head. Not much aroma, just some sweet fruit. The taste was an improvement,with some dark fruit, hazlenut, and a little late hops. I enjoyed it, but it is a different beer."
"This is a tasty brew but it lacks in overall complexity and fails to really show off the central ingredient. The mouthfeel isn't bad but the grip does make it a bit more difficult to drink."
"I'd pair this with a grilled sesame tuna or a wood-plank-grilled-salmon and you will not be disappointed."
"Another interesting Morimoto beer."
"D: Good variety of flavors to make this somewhat complex and not overpowering in any sense."
"Pours a semi-transparent mahogany with a fairly thick, fluffy, light dirty tan head that hangs around for a bit. Aroma is strong and malty with smoky and nutty hints. Flavor is malty with hints of hops, roast nuts and caramel and even a bit of oak. Texture is lively and tingly, sometimes just a wee bit wan but still good. It leaves a mysterious aftertaste a little like smoked wood."
"A caramel malt flavor and graininess in the mouth, with a syrupy finish. Certainly a nice finish, but not quite as well balanced as most stouts or porters (has the unequal finish similar to many smoked beers)."
"D- as interesting as the lighter version with perhaps a bit more depth. nice and hoppy, but i wouldn't have guessed there were any odd ingredients in here if i didn't know better. i can taste the buckwheat cuz i KNOW it's in there, but those flavors are similar to, and can be interpreted as, flavors that we get from different varieties of barley malt. especially when the whole shebang is roasted."
"CHEERS!"
"D - My first experience with a beer brewed with buckwheat, and overall a pleasurable quaff. Really unique stuff going on here which must be the buckwheat as this brew has (thankfully) escaped the ""sameness"" plaguing much of Rogue's line up. Interesting and notable hop bill as well spanning a wide range of flavors."
"A drinkable beer, this is another good offer from Rogue."
"D - Quite a flavourful beer & quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: Worth a try, though perhaps a more worthy of a try than their other soba-based brew. Quite quaffable all around though."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this Moromoto Black Obi Soba Ale. It's something different than the norm and was very tasty. Recommended!"
"Don't drink and review."
"Anyway, definitely glad I was able to try since I am a huge Rogue fan as well as a fan of Morimoto."
"Not high on my list for a return visit, yet not bad either. The soba just doesn't do anything for me."
"Worth a try if you can find it. Seems like the type of beer that would pair up nicely with food."
"Not a bad beer, but I wish it tasted as good as it looked."
"Morimoto Black Obi version. Pours clear brown with a medium tan head. Aroma is predominantly nuts and cocoa. Heavy black tea influence. Thin mouthfeel. Taste is weak coffee and cocoa with toasted buckwheat. Grainy, earthy, and veggie. Really felt like it was missing something. Lingering aftertaste of roasted malt and alcohol. Good, not great."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and different from what I have had lately. A good change of pace and a beer I would definitely have again."
"Pours a very dark brown-red body. Smallish tannish head, diminishing but lingering. Dark fruit aroma like raisin or plum. Maybe some coffee & purple grape juice. Plum, coffee, some chocolate aftertaste. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty tasty."
"d: I always love trying something new, and this certainly qualifies. I'm glad they made this, but this one bottle more than satisfies my curiosity."
"Drinkability- Although I don't remember drinking the regular Obi Soba Ale I do remember liking it and thinking it was fairly unique. I'm fairly sure I like this better. Like it's brother though its definitely unique. Good beer that if you happen to see it around or Rogue releases it again, give it a shot!"
"When you have this with omakase at the restaurant it is great. I don't know how it would stand up on it's own, but I feel like it would fall a bit short in the taste factor on it's own. Get the hazelnut, it is considerably better then this brew and matches better with the seafood heavy menu."
"The aroma was real nutty and soba smelling. The taste was malty and finished strong with a real noticeable soba flavor. It was nicely carbonated and left a good soba taste on the tongue. Overall it was a real solid fruit/vegetable brew."
"D- Drinks great for a darker beer. Compliments food well."
"Out of the brown bomber bottle this one poured a dark Coca Cola brown with a huge light brown head. Great retention and very sticky lacing. Roasted malt aroma with herbal hops in there too. The flavors were well balanced too. The roasted soba is apparent in the unusual flavor profile, woody and nutty with a pleasant hop kick of bitterness on the finish. Coffee and bakers chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel and full bodied without being heavy. Quite good but not as unique as all the ingredients suggest it should be."
"D- actually a pretty big fan of this beer, much better than the regular form. too bad its being phased out. cherry stout fans would def enjoy this"
"D - A pretty cool beer. Finishing the bomber is no problem. Like the lighter Morimoto ale, though, I'm left thinking that I really had to pair it with appropriate food to truly experience this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's excellent by itself, but it would really shine at the dinner table, probably with some Asian-fusion cuisine. Otherwise, if a dry, tangy dark beer sounds like your idea of a good time, definitely pick this one up."
"The flavor delivers initially, but seems to fall short of being truly full and robust. It's like a light version of a really good porter. A dark richness comes across, but I'm left wanting more. For so dark an ale it is quite crisp, as the label claims."
"It's unique, I'll give it that. Glad I tried it once, so drinkability's not awful. Neither is the flavor, but it's hardly refreshing or appealing. Just not sure why or when I'd ever want to drink this beer again. I like weird beer, but it's also got to taste good. Geez, that Bell's Third Coast Old Ale is looking pretty good about now..."
"If you are one of the folks that thinks that Morimoto gets no respect on Iron Chef America, at least he has two beers produced by Rogue. I don't know about those folks, but I'd consider having a beer named after me to be a huge sign of respect."
"D: This is a good beer that I enjoyed drinking, but one bomber is enough for a while. Morimoto is my favorite Chef, but I may have to wait to have another bomber of this until I dine at his restaurant in New York. Not only was this a good tasting beer, I think it would be awesome to cook with."
"Not sure why it's retired, they had plenty of it at R&P packie. Great appearance: solid dark black with some brown amber colors in the light. Creamy lacing with a thin head. Metallic aromas wrapped around weak hops are a little flavorless. But, there are some roasty smells especially from some simple malts. The taste has a fruity, almost roasted grape-like flavor, to the beverage with a dry finish. Good carbonation allows it to be crisp but really can't help the flavors. Overall, a rollercoaster beer in extremes."
"Definitely a different kind of beer worth picking up if you can find a bottle."
"This is an excellent version of an American Specialty Porter. I like most Rogue brews, and this was no exception."
"Ok, We just got this beer in Vancouver and now its retired? This is a much tastier darker brother to the regular Soba Ale. The beer looks like Coca-cola with a tan head. The nose is malty and kinda bready. That soba taste works really well with the dark malts kinda like Germany meets Japan ( I can see this being made in the Sapporo brewhouse). A very food friendly beer that has an unique taste."
"Quite drinkable, but nothing impressive."
"This poured a VERY dark amber-brown with red highlights. The thick foamy brown head that didn't stick around for long and the lacing was moderate to light. The rich aroma is fruity and malty at first. Next comes the chocolate and nut smell. I also picked up on a faint alcoholic smell but the abv isn't listed. The blend of flavors is very unique and rich. The maltiness is almost overbearing but the combination of nut, fruit and floral hops keeps the flavor rich and varied. The flavor of bitter chocolate is barely a hint in the taste and not as notable as in the aroma. The feel is crisp but smooth. This is drinkable but a bomber is plenty!"
"Drinkable considering over-charred/astringent character."
"Didn't know it was retired, and had I known, I might have saved the bottle a bit longer. But, It's been hanging around for a few months, so it was time. If you can get a hold of it, it's worth a try; if not, it's no big loss."
"D: Good drinkability with a nice roasted and fruity palate that kept things interesting throughout the drink."
"Drinkability: I guess this is retired? A nice brew overall, and something I enjoyed, but I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. I didn't know what I was getting into with buying this on a whim, but it was definitely an interesting experience."
"Overall, this beer was really interesting, and a work out for the tastebuds. Not bad, but I don't think I'd pick it up again..."
"overall i am having a hard time with this beer. its good, but im having trouble identifying and understanding it. its like a standalone beer that i could easily comeback to, but wouldn't think of when im in a ""insert style"" mood"
"This poured a clear dark brown with a slight amount of light tan head. It smelled very faintly of basic malt, with not much else noticeable in the scent. It tasted slightly bitter and very earthy, like oak and malt mixed with prunes. It was watery with slight carbonation, and it had a mildly bitter and moderately spicy aftertaste. Overall this was a very subtle and mild beer, without much to hold my attention."
"I'm really not sure where I stand with this one. As I had more, I got used to it, but it never completely grew on me. Overall, pretty good still, and very unique, which is a quality I always appreciate."
"Pours a great dark brown to black color with nice (fizzy) head and excellent lacing. It has a slightly burnt grain aroma, reminiscent of a stout, but that's as far as the stout comparison goes. Very nice flavor, but hard to pinpoint everything. There is a slight yeastiness about it, along with a general lager feel, and a nice tanginess (from the soba I'm guessing). Goes down very well."
"Unusual and well-executed, though not a new favorite for me."
"Certainly not Rogue's best brew, but an easily-drinkable, light, refreshing beer nonetheless..."
"Pours an almost opaque deep black with a thin off-white head. The aroma is some dried fruits and dark malt, but rather weak. Taste showed characteristics of both a porter and a nut brown, with a hint of wheat texture and some dried fruit. The beer is light bodied and crisp with low carbonation. This one is rather enjoyable, but nothing all that special."
"D: I recommend, as this was a great from first to last sip. A joy to drink and could have more than one at a sitting. Definite buy and try."
"Pours to a highly carbonated inch and a half of rich tan head sticking to the glass slightly as it fades. Body is a thin blackness that shows the carbonation on the body of the glass. Nose is attractive with roasty malt and hints of nutty toffee and minerals. You get a slight tangy sour on the tongue up front this is not harsh though. This quickly yeilds to a nutty malt that paints the mouth fully. Has a nice thickness due to the sour start and the malty balance. Extremely drinkable well balanced refresher."
"Very drinkable, drank my bottle and still wanted more"
"D - What is Black Obi Soba anyway? Is this really a fruit/vegetable beer? Rogue's website says Soba is buckwheat, which is really a fruit and not a grain. Hmm. It tastes and smells like a grain to me (at least in beer form), so don't go expecting a ""fruity"" beer for this one. Anyhow, this is not a favorite of mine, and I doubt I will be revisiting. Just a touch too roasted and dry without more redeeming qualities."
"from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass pours a very dark amber brown color with a fluffy tan head that sticks around for awhile. smells of roasted malts, slightly fruity and smells very good. taste is mainly of roasted malts, slightly nutty with a slight bitterness. mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied. this was a very good beer but rogue definitley has better offerings."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a strange beer because nothing stands out and its hard to put your thumb on why its good, but I like it and could definitely pound a few of these down in a session."
"D - a mellow easily quaffable brew. I appreciated the dark soba elements, but they don't really take the spotlight. A dry ale taste is the major factor with smooth creamy wheat tastes. I would give it another go."
"A decent beer. Nice head that stays around for a while. Nice chocolate malt and buckwheat smell. Taste is better than the regular obi. While, this beer is dark, it is very smooth and light (you know what I mean). Very easy beer to drink. A nice beer in the fall. Very light and thirst quenching. One of the few dark beers I can say that about."
"This beer poured a thick black with a nice light tan head  tight bubbles. The aroma is spicy and malty. It has a roasted taste that is balanced by a molasses like sweetness. There is a refreshing spice that adds a little extra in this ale. The mouthfeel is full, but short of chewy. This is an interesting beer which Id consider quite drinkable."
"It's not the most refreshing but it's certainly an interesting take. I would have to take this one over the signature buckwheat ale in most circumstances.It's unassertive enough to pair nicely with a lot of foods, just beware the aftertaste and keep around some water."
"This beer pours very dark with a slight brown tint and a light head the settles into a good lace. It has a toasted fruity smell that fills the senses. The beer has a smoky roasted coffee flavor that settles into a chocolate tone. It has a creamy fell what goes down smooth. It finishes heavy with a hops after taste. In all this is a very good beer with a smooth quality."
"Me likey - would buy it again to drink with a teriyaki steak or maybe some roast duck."
"Almost black with some ruby notes around the edge. Creamy head that dosn't hold as long as i would like. Smell of roasted malts but I also picked up some distinct cascade hops grapefruit in the first wiff. The roasted flavor takes over and pushes the hops out of the picture. Some chocolate and coffee tones in the taste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but that isn't exactly a bad thing. There is so much flavor in this beer that it stays interesting all the way through. Fruit/vegetable beer dosn't really give you a feel for what this beer is, I would describe it as a scotch ale. Nice beer that is worth seeking out to try."
"22 oz bottle into snifter. A: Very dark, a light head that died down fairly quick. S: Roasted malts, soy sauce, very light hops, hints of coffee. T: Surprisingly light, black tea mixed with buckwheat, bitter finish. M: Fairly thin and smooth, not much carbonation. D: Overall, it's a really interesting beer. Not my favorite Rogue offering, but unique enough that it's definitely worth a try."
"This one starts out complex but quickly fades in flavor. It's similar to a porter, but a little lighter. Worth a try."
"D-I could have alot of these. This is a well made beer and right up my alley. This makes a perfect pairing for a rich piece of meat."
"Pours out of a 22oz. bomber bottle into my Sly Fox pint glass a deep dark chestnut brown that allows very little light pass through. Head is about two fingers deep and light tan in color. Smells of roasted tree nuts, and sweet caramel. Tastes of roasted nuts, molasses and pungent, bitter citrus fruit. Quite rich in the mouth with a high level of carbonation. This was a really unique beer, for me at least, and one that I would re-visit on occasion."
"This brew pours quite nicely. There's a lot of CO2 here, which produces a nice light tan head that lasts almost to the end from a 22oz bomber. This is very dark and pretty much looks like a porter. It smells like one too. Roasted malts, but I detect a small grape like aroma. Tastes pretty much like a porter to me. This is full bodied, but is crisp and refreshing. It finishes a little powdery."
"D: Not bad, a fairly straight forward beer. Goes down really easy though."
"Very different for me to drink.But good,im glad i tried it.Good solid brew but from Rogue but not there best."
"Deep, deep brown color-just bordering on black. Nice thick tannish head on top. Low aroma-just a touch of maltiness to it. Good malty flavor. Just a hint of some roasted malt. Somewhat of a nutty flavor-very slight black pepper spice to it. Kind of earthy and musty flavored. Good body-crisp dry finish. Very drinkable beer. I did not know what to expect and am pleasantly suprised."
"The body is thick and creamy. Very good. Light carbonation. Has an odd, dry diacetyl finish with a lingering taste of buckwheat. Could be better, but I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed it compared to the Soba/Buckwheat ale."
"Drinkability- Not a beer I plan on buying again, but I wouldn't tell anybody not to buy it either."
"Mid orange tones with hazy clarity. Thin white head with lacing down the sides. Slight aroma, hard to describe. Mostly malt taste with little to no hop. Sweet notes. Very easy drinking. This would be a nice starter to the night. It's great after work..."
"Poured out a dark brown, near black, with a bubbly thick light caramel head. Nose is a bit sweet and fruity, soy sauce, and some slight metallic notes. Taste is a light malt, roasted coffee, tiny bit of bitter chocolate, very faint amount of hops. Finish is fairly big and bitter, lasts a long time."
"Overall, this beer is interesting, the taste is unique, as there is a sweet and lightly sour feel that clings all the way through the tasting session. The rest is kind of bland and usual though."
"Drinkability: Too busy for my palate, but intersting non-the-less. I won't have this again unless it's paired with the perfect food."
"very dark, near black with red highlights and a light tan head. decent retention and lacing. very strong roasted peanut aroma. flavor is nutty as well with a nice earthy hop character. finishes dry with the traditional pacman yeasty aftertaste. very smooth drinking beer with a zesty and crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. bomber is gone quickly. another excellent beer out of the morimoto line."
"Maybe more drinkable than the regular Soba Ale, because this one's more like beer. An interesting, light change of pace."
"D: An easy beer to drink due to its fairly low ABV and crisp character. I like this, but Rogue has done better. Worth a try."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Very flavorful, without being too filling."
"Reddish brown, dark mahogany pour. Huge, fluffy 3 finger head, tan color and holds up pretty well. Sweet malt, toffee nose. Toasted malts, coffee. Bitter presents from the hops, but hop flavor is very subtle. Dark chocolate and espresso. Thin body which thickens as it warms. Sticky mouth feel and lingering toasted malt finish will not let you forget what you're drinking. Becomes buttery and wheat, grass like towards the end. Good beer, but was expecting more."
"I picked this 15th Anniversary beer up at the Kclinger's Public House before it closed awhile back. The beer poured a deep dense brown, almost black color with a very thick and bubbly head that lasted for awhile and finally gave way to a tan swirly layer over the dense body and had good lacing. The aroma is toasted, has a touch of coffee maybe. The taste is a more intense toasted malt taste with a bit of hop bitterness on the backend to round things out nicely. The body is medium and there is a good lingering bitterness on the tough. Another solid Rogue brew."
"Drinkability - not so sessionable to me, but a cool one for a beer tasting."
"D-Was another good brew from Rogue. They have yet to let me down."
"Cheers!"
"Very dark, clear ruby/chestnut colour with a short cap of dark tan head. Decent retention with a bit of stickage as well. Aromas of light powdery hops and a nutty, chocolatey, caramel malt sweetness. Mild to moderate bitterness and hop flavour with a burnt malt character that's a little too strong. There's a bit of sweetness that's more prominent towards the finish, as is a hint of chocolate. The body is on the light side with a slightly creamy texture and plenty of roasted dryness. Interesting and well brewed, but just a little dull."
"Mouthfeel- Crisp as well as a little creamy and herbal. The soba brings new flavors to the table for what looks like an average German beer. But it's not!!!"
"Pours dull black/dark brown with a tan head. Smells basically just like a schwarzbier, but slightly more fruity in the yeast dept. Taste is pretty much similar, with some chocolate and roasted malts, but with a little somethinge extra that a schwarz wouldnt usually have, and that's most likely ale yeast. Mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side of medium. Overall I think I liked the regular Morimoto soba beer better, but this was fair as well. Sometime I'll breakdown and buy the imperial pilsner, because the rest of his line has turned out decent. On the other hand, now that I've had this one, I doubt I'll buy it again."
"($3.99 / 22 oz. lithographed bottle)"
"Overall: This beer is classified as a fruit/vegitable beer by BA, but it presents more like a moderate to mild stout. Definitely worth a try, and definitely a conversation-stimulating brew."
"Drinkability just isn't this beers strong suit. There is a harshness to the flavor from too much charred malt. This is distinctly burned in flavor and much closer to a porter or stout than anything else. A beer I can't recommend."
"I enjoyed this one and will definately pick it up again. In some ways it reminded me of a really good Black & Tan"
"Drinks okay, couldn't drink more than a few, not complex enough to hold my attention all night or day as the case may be. I enjoyed this more than the sobe ale I tried by far"
"Slick but not oily. Finishes clean and leaves nothing behind. This is almost like a porter. Save for the eathiness in the taste. Good beer but I doubt I'd buy it again."
"Drinkability- This is one of the few beers I have had that really didn't taste like anything. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was just there. Kinda like an Irish Dry Stout, except with out the minimal flavor. To this beer I say...huh? I guess that means it's kinda interesting in it's own sorta way. But then again this is me talkin' after three bombers."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but a little thin, and drinkability is high. Pretty good beer, but not one of the better rogue's that I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slick and wet. Barely watery, with a drying finish. Drinkable for the style to be sure- but you have to be in the mood for this one. A unique beer to be sure."
"D: This isn't a bad beer, but I'm not a big fan of the taste or mouthfeel. Others that have more of an appreciation for vegetables may enjoy this more."
"now that I think of it....it kinda reminds me of Abita Turbodog"
"A medium bodied brew, smooth but with a slightly watery and clean finish, sadly. Wanted this one to linger on the palate a bit. A good brew that at least gets better as it warms."
"Black Obi is dark brown, almost black with a large tan head. Head is fairly creamy and thick. Aroma is sweet and nutty, almost nutmeg-like actually, atop a roasted malt body. Flavor is dominated by a smoth nutty flavor, similar to hazelnut, with an edge of caramel. Malt base is sweet and lightly roasted with a vague chocolate flavor in the mix as well. Overall flavor is just a bit on the thin side for this to be truly great. Drinkability is very good, I could definently kick back with this again. I think Texas now has the entire Rogue Morimoto line, except for the imp pilsner, too bad that's the one I most want to try."
"Pours out a dark black with quite a lot of bubbles coating the side of the glass. Modest tan head that fades quickly. Good nutty, roasted, bread-like aroma. Very coffee-ish flavor, lots of roast grain, and a subtle sweetness offset by the roast malt and light bitterness. Finishes with a lingering toasty, lightly caramel flavor. The body seems a little thin and watery, though it has a bit of chewiness."
"This Rogue offering pours a dark ruby color with a meduim tan head. It smells nutty and grainy with just a bit of stinging acidity. The flavor is really strong on the nutty side, I don't know if its the yeast or the soba but it is quite nutty. Smooth but a bit watery and the body really doesn't help this beer at all. A slight dextrin like sweetness emerges on top of the nutty flavors. A bit of citrus come in along with some vegetal flavors. A spicy, high alpha acid finish cleans out this rather unremarkable Rogue offering. It's decent and drinkable but not worth the money imo."
"This is an interesting ale. Packed in a brown bomber with Japanese characters and named after a famous chef, Morimoto Black Obi Soba Ale pours nearly black with a medium sized off-white head that leaves some lacing on the side. The aroma is very grainy, like fresh baked multigrain bread, though a touch sweet. Very nutty flavor with sweetness at the start that moves to more savior notes with a touch of soy sauce in the middle and finishes dryer and with some spice. Light mouthfeel but perhaps lighter and less round than expected. The first sip or two might be a surprise as this is a unique beer, but it is very drinkable."
"This one is a bit of a letdown when you consider the brewery."
"22 oz bottle pours a dark red almost black color with a small light brown head that leaves little lacing in my glass. Light grain and wheat aromas, taste of wheat bread, not much flavor kind of bland. Light to medium bodied with a watery mouthfeel, finishes a bit sweet."
"I picked up a bomber of this not really knowing what to expect, and yet I was fairly surprised by this beer. It pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, it smells pretty good, but the taste really came as a surprise. It is not a typical rogue ale that is all about the hop, this tasted more like a traditional porter except rather than having a creamy consistency, it was more of a sparkling type of carbonation. I liked this beer,and I would say it is definitely worth a try, but not typical of the Rogue line."
"A pleasant and safe beer although the lable and packaging promised more. Smells mildly and sweetly roasty with a light, smooth roundness. Looks like Coca cola, perhaps a bit darker and with much better carbonation and head retention. Tastes pleasantly roasty, moderately sweet, and mildly spicy. Light alcohols persist into the finish. Feels smooth and refreshingly light to the palate. Finishes a bit airy for a dark, roasted beer. Though nice and without flaws, it falls a little lackluster."
"Drinkability: Overall a beer you need only to try once and that's it. This is something I wanted to try since I watch alot of Iron Chef and after drinking this, I was a bit disappointed. Sorry, this isn't one of Rogue's best products."
"I have to say this is uncharacteristic for rogue, who knows maybe Morimoto had to much input into this beer because when rogue makes their ""own"" beers they are phenominal. I'm going to blame this average offering on the chef and move on."
"Drinkability: Nice and flavorful, but very easy to drink. Perhaps a tad too sweet on its own, but great with a meal."
"Much better than the little-brother Morimoto Soba version. Poured black, with a mocha head. Roasted malt aroma - very stout-like up front with lots of roasted malt flavors. An interesting interplay of malts and the soba, producing an odd finish. I kept thinking that this reminded me very much of another beer, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Finally, it dawned on me how much this beer was like Anchor's Our Special Ale, without the spices or spruce. As with OSA, something interesting, but not something I want a lot of."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is not really a regular rotation kind of thing but I can see being in the mood for this. One of the more interesting concoctions I've come across in a while. Worth a try."
"Pours a deep, dark amber with a rocky, crackling, khaki head. Smells of mild hop spiciness, with roasted and slightly chocolatey malt. Initially hits with gentle hops followed by a dry roasted malt in the middle finishing with a nutty, hop crispness. Slightly astringent and almost salty. Medium body, drying mouthfeel. Not that impressive, but perhaps pairing it with the right foods will make it standout."
"An okay beer. I won't be returning unless it is free, yo!"
"Black Obi (the wide belt on a kimono) Soba Ale is a better beer than its lighter counterpart. The roasting of the buckwheat brings out flavors that are preferable to the unroasted fruit and the different malt and hop bills are more to my liking as well. It doesn't quite make it over the hump called 'recommended', but I'm still glad this is a bomber."
"Unusual beer. Very much brings rhubarb or chickory to my mind. An acidity and sourness remain, but it does ease as it warms. Find a bottle with a good price, then try some, but don't spend too much on this one."
"Bottle (courtesy of Okbeer): Poured a pitch-black ale with a medium head with average retention. Aroma of bitter hops with some strange spice that I dont think I have encountered in beer before. Taste is a mix between the roasted malt, bitter hops and this strange spice. Body is too thin and carbonation is very low. This is not bad but nothing extraordinary either; Id still go with the mocha porter any day thought."
"I quite liked this beer. One that grows on ya. A fine drinker and taster. Perhaps not the complete knock out that it could be, but for what it is, it's about right and pretty solid."
"Fairly complex brew but fairly easy to drink. I'd like another bottle to review it again I think."
"The beer pours into a pint glass leaving a small eggshell-colored head to contrast with the otherwise black body of the beer. This bad boy is almost opaque, but when held up to the flourescent light in my room, a dark maroon hint shines through. The beer smells bitter and sweet, which is not to be confused with bittersweet. That is something totally different. Burnt malts lay the ground work for the flavor, supporting the sugary beginning, bready buckwheat middle, and hoppy finish. The hops and the sugar stick on the toung for 5 or 8 seconds after the swallow. I don't know much about Soba's, but this beer is a bit thin for the flavor. That said, I think this is a well crafted beer, and a fitting addition to the Morimoto signiture series."
"A drinkable beer, but no much flavor really, a little thin in that area. Not one that particularly impressed me or will have me out searching for it again."
"Phreds Black Soba has a delightfully eccentric taste. It is sweet and strangely herbal as though spiced with licorice root with an undercurrent of dried fruits. The head fades quickly and the lace is infrequent. But it earns an enthusiastic recommendation to any adventuresome beer hunter."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a sweet crystal malt scent with a nutty accent. There are some hops present, but the overall aroma is dominated with nuts and chocolate. The taste is great as well. It has a roasted, coffee-like flavor that is sweet, but with an earthy, nutty edge. There is a bit of tanginess in the flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an outstanding beer. It has a delicious aroma followed by an enjoyable taste; a good drinker."
"A black pour, accentuated by red at the edges. Smells nutty, with a prominent roasted malt sweetness. Flavor is pretty mellow, hoppy bitterness edged by malt sweetness. There is an overall nuttiness that almost gives it a brown ale quality. Nothing fancy here, seems like just another oppurtunity for Rogue to push the ""gourmet"" Morimoto line. Worth a try."
"Beer pours a dark coffee color with a beautiful tan head that pours to a 2 inch thick head, lacing will coat the glass. The smell is mysterious, you will find the usuall hints of roasted malts and caramel hues found in darker beers, but the light berry fruit and citrus hop came as a pleasant suprise. The taste is light enough to still drink in the heat of summer. The roasted malts and perfectly blended with the light smooth side of this beer, perfect for your BBQ in the late summer evenings. Perfect."
"After getting through the initial slightly burnt taste, this is a very drinkable beer limited to the tolerance of the fading burnt aftertaste."
"The beer is smooth and somewhat creamy. Subtle is the best word I can use to describe this beer. Not overpowering and really not as flavorful as I had hoped."
"Light body with excessively large bubbles lending to a fuller mouthfeel. Watery palate. Almost as bad as the regular Soba alw. Does anyone actually like this? I can't see anyone buying this more than once."
"Pretty good, and quite interesting for something so straightforward."
"Pours a dark ruby color with a huge head, lots of longevity and tremendous lace. Smells of a rich medium roasted malt that has some slight butter and nutty smells. Taste is quite nice. A fine roasted malt flavor similar to a nice porter but nuttier and creamier. Give this one a try."
"Taste is nutty and rich, not unlike a nice full-bodied English nut brown ale. Sweetish brown malt. Buckwheat flavors take hold in the finish, lending a grainy bitterness to it. Some hops in there too to round it out. Rich and full-bodied yet crisp and kind of refreshing too. A beer in two parts, nut brown up front, soba going out. Better than anticipated and went well with my sushi. Recommended."
"Very dark black colored body, with a moderate head. Smell is very roasted and burnt with malt, nutty and rich. Flavor also reflects this, nutty, with lots of roasted and burnt malt, slight chocolate and acidic flavors are also present. Hops are perfect for the beer, they enhance and give it a nice bitter finish. Another very good morimoto rogue ale."
"Dark brown body with a tan pillowy tan head. Scattered bits of lace were left decorating the glass. Nice roasted malt presence with a light chocolate. Some nutty notes as well as caramel sweetness. Overall a solid aroma that had a bit of depth to it. Nutty roasted malt flavors started this one off with a mild dark chocolate in the background. Caramel sweetness and a light bitterness rounded out the flavor. Bitter sweet roasty finish. About medium and fairly smooth going down. Good drinkability as there is a bit of depth to both the taste and smell. Nice balance of sweet and roasty. Another good brew from Rogue."
"This beer pours a very dark red. It has a small brown head that fades very quickly, leaving very few laces. It has a malty sweet aroma to it. It smells coffee like, with a slightly nutty aroma also. It has very little hop aroma. It tastes malty, but not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. It has a chocolate taste to it. The hops make an appearance in the taste slightly. This beer is rather dry. It is sort of hard to drink because of how dry it is. It makes my mouth feel a little weird. I really cant explain how, just a little off. It is overcarbonated. It leaves a bitter aftertaste. This beer would probably make a bad session beer. Although it is low in alcohol, the aggressive, dry taste might be undesirable to some. I doubt I will have the desire to drink this one again. If you see it, maybe you should buy a different type. Like the Haselnut Brown Nector."
"Pretty complex aroma balanced between malt and a little floral/fruit nose. The taste is incredibly balanced between malt and hops, with a crisp citrus stampeding through at the finish. It's a very clean finish too, for a darker colored brew. Drinkability is good...of course, how many of these 22 oz. bottles can one realistically put away?"
"Poures a near pitch black but not for the ruby highlights when held up to the light with a big fluffy off white head that clings to the glass nicely,wow a real cascade presence in the aroma wich was entirely unexpected due to the fact well it is Rogue,a nice roastiness also shows itself nicely.Slick mouthfeel to this slides down with ease,interesting melding of flavors firmly nutty with some roasted malt as the core but there is very much a PW hop presence not so pronounced but it lets itself be known.Very interesting and flavorful ale I will be sure to grabe more."
"I've been intrigued with the Morimoto line of Rogue beers and buy them whenever I've come across them. I love a good gimic and good beer so walk away from the experience a winner."
"Mouthfeel is dry and smooth. The bitter chocolate tones linger into the aftertaste. Overall a different tasting brew, but one 22 oz. bottle was enough to enjoy."
"This is far and away the least distinguished Rogue brew I've had."
"Pours into the pint glass a dark dark ruby black. Big foamy head, lacing, and falls to a table of beige bubbles. Nose is toasted bread and malt, some alcohol soaked sugars. Taste is chocolate, hop bitterness and what must be the ""soba"" flavor, like a Japanese noodle bowl. Not my thing. The finish is an annoying bitterness that lingers far past its welcome. Other than that, this is relatively watery beer. It's ok."
"The beer emerges from the 22-ounce brown bottle a deep raspberry color with a stupendous frothy light tan head that linger long, after its eventual demise the resultant lace forms a thick and sticky skirt to surround the glass. Nose has a nice toasted grain aroma with a sweet nut-like tone, fresh and clean, a hint of caramel, start is somewhat sweet with a decent grain profile, top is light to medium in feel. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops spicy and the aftertaste somewhat dry with a bit of residual bitterness, a drinkable beer."
"Light bodied, good carbonation, with a very wet refreshing mouthfeel. The taste is a malt that is rich but isn't particularly toasty. Alot of hops flavors come across. This brew is nothing if not interesting. I'm sure I would drink it again, sometime."
"Dark clear ruby. One finger sized brown head. Very creamy looking and long lasting. Lace is better than average. Nice thick aroma. It's got chocolate, roast and char, but also fruit and hop tones like currants and peach. The mouthfeel is quite creamy and lends a good drinkability to the whole equation. Body is about medium. The flavor is chock full of goodies. Rich chocolate and coffee tones on the palate blend with the weird, but nice, soba accents. And a lingering hop bitterness adds the final punch. Nice combination and quite refreshing as well."
"Pours dark -- not quite black, but close. Dark roasty malts are the most notable elements of the aroma. Slightly nutty with hints of caramel. Flavor is nutty and malty as well, with just enough bitterness to balance. Roasty, toasty and yummy, with a nicely lingering aftertaste. Overall a drinkable beer but not enthralling by any means. Not Rogue's best offering."
"22 oz. served chilled. The beer pours a deep deep brown with tinges of red and has a 1 inch tan head that leaves nice lacing. Hops, nuts, licorice, and butter in the nose - the aroma could be stronger. The flavor is very nutty and roasted with notes of coffee, licorice, and butter. It is very crisp with a medium body and has a decent hop bitterness. Seems kinda like a brown ale with a twang. Initially the carbonation is tingly but becomes smoother by the end of the bomber. It's good, but for the money I'll go for something better."
"A unique style with a good delivery."
"I really liked this one, but I have always enjoyed the original Buckwheat Ale. This is very similar, but more brash, unrefined, and punchier. Good stuff."
"Overall: Hmmmm.listed as a Fruit/Vegetable beerbut I couldnt help feel that this tasted and drank a little like a below average Dark Mild. Not bad.but I think Ill pass on this one again if I see it. Very Average and bloody boring.Zzzz..yawn."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle a seemingly black hue, but deep brown highlights emerge when it is held up to the light. A half-inch, tan-colored head hangs around for a few minutes before retreating into a thin ring on top of the beer. Interesting aroma of roasted malt, caramel, and and a touch of dark fruit. The palate is strange - lightly sweet, with a touch of malt and no discernable hop presence up front. Notes of root vegetable, molasses, and buckwheat come through mid-palate, and a light hop bitterness emerges in the back of the mouth. Light body is a bit too thin. Interesting, to say the least, although I'm not sure I'd drink this very often."
"22 oz bomber purchased at Peabody's in Boone, NC, for $3.99. Pours a very dark chestnut brown, not quite opaque, with a large, creamy beige head that retains well. Lots of sticky patch lace all over the glass. Aroma is subdued, with roasty and grainy malts, a hint of cocoa powder, and a note of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light medium bodied. The flavor is unique, and difficult to describe. Earthy buckwheat nuttiness and some herbal tea notes. A hint of mild coffee, and a restrained hops bitterness. Finishes crisp and refreshing, with mild hops bitterness. Goes down smooth and easy, and is very drinkable. Very interesting!"
"I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys dark beer or beers that are bold and innovative."
"Quite tasty indeed. Big roasty presence keeps this going, especially when paired with the fine hop bitterness. A very easy drinker."
"This is a really interesting beer, reminding me at times of a mix between Guinness Export Stout & Rogue's Morimoto Soba Ale. It has that sharp burnt caramel bitterness of the Guinness and the medium body, hoppy intensity and residual sugars of the Soba. At any rate, this is a really good beer, but I think I could only finish one of these bombers at a time. Good stuff John!"
"i'd have this beer again, and if i can find it for the label price ($5.29/bomber), I will certainly go for it."
"Had this on tap at Rich O's Public house. Pours a dark brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma had hints of roasted malts, but it was very subdued. The flavor was a bit weak too. Reminded me a lot of the standard Buckwheat ale that Rogue makes, but with a bit more roastiness. A nice beer overall, but seemed a bit thin and weak in the flavor. Great flavor, but it could use more if it."
"Sampled at Rich-O's last night. The beer came off the tap a nice dark brown, with just some ruby hues at the edges to let me know its not black. One finger of tan head sat atop the beer throughout the drink. The nose was a little hard to dissect, being a touch weak, but I got a nice roasted character, with a slight coffee as well. The flavor was also only slightly roasty, wtih a really nice caramel sweet base and a touch of hops on the finish. The feel was a touch thin for my liking, but very smooth and easy to consume. This was another nice offerng from Rogue. A good way to start the night."
"Had this on-tap at the Public House in San Fran."
"another treat provided by my buddy tony from oregon...bringing back rogue treats as a wedding present."
"With warmth some doughiness comes out, but still that piercing black medicinal taste. Interestingly off."
"Drinkability  I enjoyed this offering from Rogue. I dont know what kind of vegetable it was supposed to be, though. I saw it as a nice, low-ABV, very drinkable dark ale."
"This is a very interesting ale, to say the least. I had this one with a few friends in Philadelphia. This ale was a dark black/brown colour with ruby edges. The aroma was interesting. Although it was reminiscent of the regular soba ale, it also had some roasted notes, and some chocolate tones. The smell also had an odd aroma that I can not describe. This particular aroma kind of ruined the smell of this beer for me. Although the smell was not my favorite, this beer tasted awesome. Fruity roasted, and very stout-like at times with plenty of fruit notes as well. The mouthfeel was pretty creamy and smooth, but perhaps a bit thin and the drinkability was nice. An interesting one from Rogue."
"A nice quaffable anniversary beer from Rogue will not be around again. I am looking forward to the next one though."
"A good session beer indeed..and I would have drank these all night, but I just had to have a few more pints of the ""smoke ale""."
"I said ""solid"" already, so...'nother good one, Rogue! Mmmmm!"
"It also had that almost complely unique Rogue hoppiness, which also rounded out the flavor. Overall, its pretty good, especially with desert."
