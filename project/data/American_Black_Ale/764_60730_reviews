"It was more of a dark reddish color than an IPA and the taste was not what you would expect from and IPA."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation style, it’s a good beer but it certainly does not seem like a “Black IPA”."

"Must try, original, if you like your beers masculine. One of the best in a favorite style."

"By and large the best thing is how it looks but that's really not a compliment. Dark with a nice light head. The smell was okay with a bit of yeast on the nose and a bit of the hops. The taste was okay with a bit of pine and then a clean finish. I found this beer to be a bit forgettable to be honest. For a black IPA it's very good, but then again it's not a style I point out to others that often. If you're a fan of the style, give it a try and you might be surprised, others may want to try something else first."

"I'm going to let this warm up, but as of now it leaves much to be desired. This is my issue with cans. It's too cold to taste!"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a slightly above average example of a Black IPA, it wasn't bad at all, but I found myself wishing that the malts were more rich, bolder and roasty and I thought the hop profile could have been a little more complex and impart more hoppy flavors, but it's far from the worst Black IPA and I would say that as a whole it's pretty solid. What I liked the most about this beer was that it was fairly true to style and it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the hops and malts weren't bolder, I think they were both a little weaker then they should be. I might buy a can of this when I'm in the mood for a Black IPA and I would for sure buy another one if I knew it was really fresh. I would recommend giving this a try if you like Black IPAs, but I don't think it's a stand out in the style. All in all I thought this beer was solid, it wasn't the best or the worse of the style, but it didn't have any off flavors or anything that was too far off for the style. Nice job guys, keep up the solid work."

"On the whole...this one was weird. Not bad, but not quite what I'd call an ""IPA", per se. Maybe I'm just biased by having gotten to try some phenomenal Cascadian Black Ales in the past (Founders' Inspired Artist comes to mind), but this one was just a little off for me. Still a respectable effort."

"O - 3.5 - It's alright, but it's missing the dark malt character in the aroma and taste. Hops are there but not very complex."

"O: Overall a decent black ipa with a warming toasted caramel hoppiness, fairly smooth to drink with an easy rate of consumption, much more so then a name like toxic sludge would let you believe. Wont knock you over with its hoppiness, but has some sweet malty nature to balance. Abv seems very relaxed for 7.00%. Recliner beer."
"An all around solid brew. I'd buy this again."

"A big thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cola color with a 1 inch head. Lots of thick lacing on this one. Smell is mostly of hops. Taste is roasted malts up front, bitter, hops kicking in at the finish. A good balance. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
"Flavor starts off with more choco/roasty action, plus some light malty sweetness. It has some mild , charred bitterness, then ides into some floral hoppiness. There's also a bit of rindy citrus thrown into the mix. Though I have had better BIPAs, this isn't bad... Prosit!!"

"A pretty tasty black IPA with a decent amount of interesting notes. The only shortfall for me is it's just a tad thin. But I enjoyed the taste regardless. Not my favorite black ale, but still a decent beer, with hints of black currant, tar, bitter chocolate. A pretty easy drinker too. Not bad."
""
"O: 4.25 - although I don't like the style very much, Toxic Sludge is one of the better black IPAs/CDAs on the market; even though my can is dated, this is one of the roastier/malt-forward black IPAs, so, if you're looking for a hop-forward example of the style, this is not the one to try (I would suggest Firestone Walker's Wookie Jack IPA for a hop-forward example of the style); nevertheless, I enjoy this beer and will continue to purchase on subsequent encounters"
""

"OV: A decent brew if you like roast and hops that are more Earthy/herbal than citrus."

"Poured a ruby-brown color into a pint glass with a three-quarter inch head. I smell hops! Wonderfully balanced hop to malt character. Roasted malt flavor, bitterness of some hops, tons of carbonation. Feels very crisp on the tongue and goes down easy like a coke on a hot summer day. This is a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an unbalanced beer with a harsh bitterness, but it drinks better when not too cold. It does have a lot of hops with some dark grain character but it just come together more so because of too much C hops. That being said I'd still try this beer if I found it on tap."
""
"M - Medium body with some sticky hop oils present. Light carbonation."
"Pours a dark chestnut with a large, slowly deflating head of dense foam. Vaguely hoppy aromas backed by some chocolaty roasted malt. The hops are primarily of the floral, grassy, leafy variety...the more it warms, the more bittersweet, dark chocolate takes over. Tastes of grassy, dried fruit, earthiness, cocoa, and molasses. The malt seems thinner here and there's not enough hop flavor to justify the bitterness. The cryptic code on the bottom of the can isn't a clear date, so I have no idea how fresh this is. There's something sort of amateur homebrew-ish about this that's pretty disappointing."
""
"Poured into a large wine glass. Color was a very dark reddish brown, that was almost black. It was fairly translucent, with a thick foamy dirty white head. Head left solid lacings on the sides of the glass. Aroma was malty, with a bit of sour hops, finishing up as a tad of floral sweet. Flavor was a watery grain, with a small touch of hoppy bite in the end. Came through watery in the mouth, didn't coat much at all. Overall not bad, but didn't stand out. Was a bit lacking in the flavor"
""

"Toxic Sludge is a fantastic looking black IPA, it pours out brown with high clarity and a large mocha head. The aroma is richly malty with a solid dose of citrus and pine hops. The taste is rather balanced, with a nice roastiness that reminds me of an Irish Dry Stout. There's also a substantial amount of hops that balance everything out. The strong pine flavors are very well integrated. The mouthfeel is fairly highly carbonated and medium bodied, and the drinkability is fantastic. Overall, Toxic Sludge is one of the better balanced Black IPAs I've had. It's very tasty without relying on the hops overpowering the dark malts."
""
"this beer is OK, not bad in any sense but nothing special. some nice hop punch and good ABV kick but it just seems to be missing an all around mission."
""
""
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a black colored body with a small mocha colored head that takes it time to lay down. The aroma has a hop aroma but not to strong. The taste a bitter hop flavor with some chocolate malt coming through. I also get a metal taste also. The mouth feel is smooth and overall this is a good beer, it doesn't impress me to much, I think the metal taste does it."
""
""
""
"O/D-Even before the metallic flavor, I was not enamored with this beer. The hops are bitter with no finesse; like a 7 foot basketball player without any touch on the ball. The label art on the can is supremely memorable."
""
""

""
""
"Odd but neat looking can reminds me more of an energy drink than a beer. Pours a solid dark brown color with ruby highlights and a huge creamy tan head that persists forever leaving lots of stickiness to the glass. Smells slightly ashy with a hint of wet cardboard on top of light chocolate and earthy floral hops. The nose is kind of disappointing for a black IPA really. The flavor is a bit better with a solid malty chocolate mixed with an earthy spicy hop flavor. Firm but pleasant hop bitterness rounds out a caramel butterscotch malt sweetness quite well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy mouthfeel. Decent beer that I could drink, but middle of the road and honestly not worth purchasing again."
""
"Overall with cleaver design (cool looking can) and a balanced taste it makes for a very above average Black IPA."
""
""
"Cheers!!"
"almost black, very dark brown with ruby highlights in the corners. nice off-white head, good lacing and retention. hoppy earthy aroma, a bit grassy, spicy. slight mild roasty flavor in the taste, a bit of bitterness and hop finish. medium body, medium to higher carbonation. overall - okay, but far from the best Black IPA I've had."
""
""
"but as it stands this beer is solid. I highly recommend it."
"Overall: Although the hop bill grew on me half way through, this is just a middling example of the style"
"i was a little bit let down by this one, was expecting lots more hop flavor from it. it does have a cool can design at least, though i think any graphic designer would disagree of their font selections, lol."
""
""

"O: This beer is very easy to drink with a pleasant flavor and aroma - there is a hop presence but it is not overly aggressive."
""
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/15/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense light tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, floral, grass, light pine, toast, and brown bread. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; much weaker than I expected for the style. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, cocoa, roasted malt, pine, toast, brown bread, light char, floral, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, roasted malt, chocolate, pine, brown bread, light char, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of flavors with a nice malt/hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Black IPA offering. Good complexity and balance of flavors, and very smooth to drink. This was not as robust as I expected for the style, but it was still a pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Pretty solid and drinkable black IPA. One of the more well made beers I've had from blue point."
""
""
"O. I would have to do an official tasting, but this might just be the best black IPA that I've ever had. Well balanced and flavorful, not overbearing."
"Finishs dry and bitter. This might not be the best buy it's easy drinking smooth and has all the characteristics of a fine BIPA being hoppy witha a tad of roast thrown in."
"The Crack released a noxious green cloud and I had to evacuate the house while Fire & Rescue did their thing. The inverted Glug revealed a highly suspicious viscous liquid and I had to wait for it to settle before proceeding. I had a dense finger of light-brown foam that seemed destined not to go away until I deployed my flame thrower and burned it off. Color was a deep ruby-red with NE-quality clarity, enabling me to see all manner of mutant creatures swimming around in it. I began to wonder - if Minhas products have turned me into a Cyberman in the past, what effect was Toxic Sludge going to have on me? There was only one way to find out and so I charged ahead, taking my first sip of the day. Mouthfeel was medium and I could feel the creatures tugging on my tongue as they tried to get purchase, but to no avail. They slid right down my gullet and into my stomach where my mutant stomach acid instantly dissolved them. My Minhas-mutated bodily systems were too much for Toxic Sludge! I had a feeling that such might be the case, but now, I am sure of it. I laugh in the face of The Toxic Avenger! Bring on Godzilla! I liked how the minty hops really held their own on the nose. One of my principal complaints about the style is that it seems to negate the best of both worlds with the malt overtaking the hops and the hops dumbing down the malt. Not so here. This was quite drinkable and I got plenty enough hoppy bitterness to keep me happy. The dark roasted malt added a charcoal bitterness that enhanced, rather than overwhelmed, the hops. The finish was quite dry and if I had to drink a Black/Cascadian IPA, this is the one that I would prefer. Remember, kids, get it in the CAN!"

"A hoppy Guinness? Light in body and light in the roasted malt flavor. Gets a LOT better as it warms up, Good to Very Good Black IPA. Not the greatest out there (Sublimely, Dubhe, etc), but in the ballpark of something like 21st Amendment’s Back in Black."
""

"The body resembles that of a cola, with a huge fluffy tan head. Aroma provides whiffs of licorice, pine, and sticky charred malt. The flavor profile hits with more of the same - bitter pine resin, smoke, char, malt. This doesn't hold up that well compared to some of the west coast staples. It's spicy and bitter but lacks a clean hop profile underneath all of the blackness. Worth a CAN purchase, but would be challenging to drink more than one."
""
""
"Overall this is a solid brew from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a tallboy into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, clear, auburn-caramel coloring with a thin, off-white, fluffy, foamy head of about a half an inch, with a slight cling along the glass. Aromas of roast, slightly charred malts with a spiced, cedar hops profile. Flavors of char on the forward tongue, with rich, resiny hops following quickly behind it. Peppery and oregano spiced, with a cedar and pine pitch overtone. Very spiced aftertaste, with a resiny linger. The body is surprisingly light, but not crisp, which felt odd for the style. Roasty, mildly resiny linger in the finish, which is carbonated bubbly and short-lived."
"Two finger off white head on a clear deep amber body, a very attractive beer. Nice lacing an excellent retention. Roasted malts, caramel ad burnt toast. Not much in the way of hops which are mosty earthy. Although the flavor is very well balanced I feel both the malts and hops are understated. Hops are earthy, caramels dn hint if chocolate for sweetness on a roasted malt base. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, nicely balanced just feel the malts and hops are a bit weak with too simple a hop profile to be considered one of the better of this genre."
""
"The hops have faded somewhat, yet the shwartzbier, roasted black beer aroma and flavour remain. And so I get a somewhat citrus integrated shwartz. Good aroma, good colour and off-white head and lace. Very drinkable. Pleasant, below average as a straight out black ipa.Can from Steve in Warren. Middling mouthfeel."
""
"Labeled a dark IPA, poured with a good sustained head that maintained a good lacing through the dring. Color was a dark deep brown with a clear look. Aroma was sweet and malty. Tast was just a bit sweet and malty with some coffee and citrus notes. Aftertast was dry and a bit hoppy. Overall a great drink, nice change from the usual IPA's and a cool name."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with two fingers of tan foam, settles to a half inch ring with spotty lace on the glass. Smell: orange, light pine, notes of cocoa and dark bread, toffee. Nice, understated. Taste: milk chocolate and toasted dark bread, grapefruit, earth and a little pine. Medium bodied, velvety feel. Relaxed, tasty. Canned on 320/365."
""
"I'm glad I only bought one can. It's interesting but I'm not convinced that it fulfills all the hallmarks of the style."
""

"o - overall, an old black ipa, but the hops held out and are actually the highlight of this brew. roastedness. pretty enjoyable and tasty albeit a bit thin and watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the wily fruity inclusion in the nose and taste. It really reminded us of Stone’s 15th Anniversary Escondidian Black IPA in its sweetness, but here we found much more plastic, leathery, and chalky cocoa bite. This beer was certainly intense, and it will probably take you by surprise, but not necessarily in a bad way."

"On tap at Gainesville House of Beer. Pours pitch black and smells like its name. Muddled boozy wet dog and burnt grain aroma. Taste follows with a lot going on, none of it which I like. Dirt and booze flavor, a little roast, rather bold, and then more booze. Slightly sweet, and very little balancing bitter. Medium to heavy bodied, low carbonation. Meh. I was disappointed with this one."
"What I really want to add to these reviews is this... a couple of days ago a opened a bottle that I have had sitting on a shelf for over a year which I purchased directly from the brewery (I live in the area). All I can say is WOW! I always enjoyed this beer but never realized how much it actually improved with age. It was creamier and brought out all of the best flavors in the beer. Really quite fantastic. If you have the means, pick up some 22 oz bottles, have patience, and let them sit for a minimum of a year. You won't be disappointed."

"O: An alright beer, overall, though nothing really special. I'd like more roasted and creamy malt characters along with a stronger hop presence."

"Medium body, smoother carbonation, very fluffy and creamy on the tongue. This drinks okay (thanks to the cask conditioning), although I there really wasn't an abundance of memorable flavor here."

"Overall- Unique beer, glad I tried it. It tastes like a very hoppy stout almost. I know that sounds like an oxymoron but thats the only way I can think of to sum it up."

"On tap at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured into a stanard pint a deep cola color with a 1/2 finger tannish colored head atop.Dark roast and earthy tones with mild bitter chocolate upfront in the nose,piney hops come into play late and linger well.Dry and roasty on the palate mixing with piney hops,light bitter chocolate as well,like others have said it seems more like a hopped up porter.It's not bad but again it seems more of a porter than a IA in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was just another average Black IPA...not too many can hit the nail on the head...this showed a hoppy nose, but more of the roast came in to play on the palate"
""
"I have been looking for this beer in my area for a while and then finally found it in an area. It's rich, delicious, smooth, but in my book not an IPA. Good nonetheless."
""

"Cheers."
"Picked up a $5 bomber at Euro Market in Queens. I thought it was a great example of the style. It wasn't too heavy, but I could still enjoy both the dark, dry cocoa malts and juicy, citrus hops. The barley is on par with schwarzbier, a little less roasty than a porter. The hops mostly in the aroma, and not much bigger than a good pale ale. I need to find more of this."
"Picked up a bomber of this at the Mondial Bier Fest in Strasbourg, France. Deep, dark mahogany, almost black pour with two finger head, with good retention and lacing. Roasty, herbal nose nicely balanced with hints of pine, caramel, espresso, and chocolate. The taste follows suit with with toasty, malty, toffee and resiny pine with hints of caramel, burnt espresso, molasses and a touch of chocolate. The mouthfeel is not as thick and chewy as most of the black IPA's I've had, but it's smooth with a nice bitter, dry finish. The drinkability is off the charts! I'm kicking myself for not buying more of these! This was my first experience with Blue Point, and I enjoyed everything from them that I tasted at the fest. Hopefully they'll be back next year so I can stock up!"
"Wow! One of the best tasting ""black IPA's"" I have ever tried and this beer genre is one of my favorites. Almost, perfect except for some minor flaws. This is a must pick-me-up if you see this. On top of this being incredibly tasty, you will be helping out a great cause."
"Would love to get this one again, maybe I'll even stumble on an old bottle one day, who knows... great beer nonetheless."
"O – Best example of the style I’ve had to date."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a roast of coffee and a mellow citrus. In the taste, coffee like roast to start with a mellow orange citrus in the end. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry citrus to pine hop in the aftertaste. Coffee roast big in the front and a nice citrus hop in the end, kind of like a El Camino!"
"Pours a dark brownish black color, with an off white foam collar and lace. In the aroma, piney hops and roasted malt. This follows through to the flavor, with piney bitterness, roasted malts, brown sugar, and faint coffee. There is a piney hop bite that lingers with bitterness as well. Medium bodied, crisp, and smooth. Overall, a nice American Black Ale, dig the hop presence and the toasted malt notes. Good."
"HV"
"D: I'm in the midst of completing this 22 oz. Ate it with a bowl of soup that I had made cheesy..yum! It's not too heavy so if this is your style then drink away, I'm pleased with the one bottle."
"Enjoyed this beer on tap at the Golden Rail Ale House in Newburgh, NY. This beer pours black with medium body consistency. An off-white to tan head which is roughly one finger with nice lacing all the way through. Definite floral and piney aroma up front with a hint of chocolate. Citric and Piney hop notes with a nice roasty, coffee malt balance. @ 7% this beer is nicely balanced and is an enjoyable Black IPA. I would definitely recommend this beer because its very drinkable and also helps a good cause."
"O: The beer is rather drinkable because it isn’t overly bitter or dry."
"Had this at the Easton Beerfest last fall. They had this one on tap and I heard people asking for it so I wanted to see what the hype was. This poured out as a dark muddy looking blackish brown brew. The head was thin and the lacing was weak. The aroma was nice though, plenty of hops and roasted malts on the nose. The taste followed along with the nose, it wasn't overly complex but still had a good flavor to it. The mouthfeel of this beer was a little light, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was a little more like the oil that they're trying to stop from harming these animals. Overall it's still a pretty good beer and worth a try."
"Toxic Sludge is a smooth, easy drinking ale. Mocha in color, it has appreciable notes of caramel malt and chocolate balanced by grassy hops with a slightly bitter finish. There’s a hint of citrus fruit in the backbone, such as grapefruit, that compliments the caramel and chocolate. Has a somewhat lighter feel to it compared to others in its style, but nevertheless is a enjoyable black ale."
"Poured into my dfh snifter. pours a pitch black color, medium body consistency. Crazy oatmeal color foam fills the top of the glass quickly, and hangs around forever. more than 10 minutes after the pour, it still holds about 1.5 fingers of cloudy head. superior head retention. Smell- chocolate, citrus bitterness, chalky milk chocolate. Pretty standard for the style. Taste- chalky bitterness, nice chocolate presence, roasty bitterness. One of my issues with this style has been that I can't really tell the difference between this and a stout/porter, but this one is uniquely an IPA that has a roasted malt backbone. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. Mouthfeel- nice and creamy, but at the same point not too thick."
"O: Excellent beer with very good drinkability! The taste is not what you would expect when you pour, drinks alot lighter than it looks. And above all, its for a good cause! Go find some and drink it!"
"o- a solid offering from Blue Point, just a well executed Black IPA, and a nice session beer. Drink black and go green."
"This was a decent take on the style from Blue Point with a well balanced and fairly easy drinking mix of flavors. I just wish that the overall profiles put a bit more out there for you to wrap your palate around. This seemed a bit muted. I’m not sure if this was because of the age of the bottle or not. I’d be willing to reinvestigate this one."
"Enjoyed this one, as I have nearly every Black Ale I've had to date. Just a really manageable style."
"M/T: You could drink this blindfolded and swear you're drinking a smooth golden amber American IPA. Bright complementary malt and upfront hop citrus juiciness blend well here for a solid session IPA...I am also very happy to have supported Blue Point with this cause..."
"Pretty good - and for a good cause."
"Not a huge fan of this style, but liked the name as well as the cause. Turns out it's a pretty good beer. Also, was surprised at how well the hops have held up on this so far. Thanks for including this one Dave!"
"Overall a very decent quality brew."
"M/D: Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. It is on the creamier side. Overall, not great and unbalanced. The nose seemed one sided, being mostly hop driven, and the flavor was malt driven. Too bad, because the appearance is amazing."
"This one pours a dark black/mahogany color into the pint glass with a decent tan head and plenty of lacing. The aroma reaches out with skunky roasted malt and a slightly chocolatey herbal hop. Edible and very pleasant. The flavor offers skunk cabbage and hickory roasted malt. It's medium bodied and offers spritely carbonation for a lively feel with a somewhat dry finish. Modestly drinkable."
"Drinks too easy, not a great example of the style, but session-worthy & one I will buy again if fresh & available"
"Pours an almost jet black with a hint of brown around the edges. The head starts out at about 3/4"" and whittled down to a light skin on the beer. The smell is amazing! There are so many different aromas that definitely work together. There is the initial hop aroma of citrus and pine but mixes very well with the slight coffee and chocolate from the dark malts. These two aromas work very well together. The taste starts out with the strong hop bite of an IPA but it mellows out in to a great mix of citrus and chocolate. There is a slight hint of coffee bitterness mixed with the sharp hop bitterness. Two different styles mixing perfectly. The mouthfeel is the perfect yin and yang as well. There is an easy drinking IPA melded perfectly a smooth, velvety oatmeal stout. I love this style and this is a great representation."
"I am not sure exactly where this fits into the style, but it is a good beer. Certainly worth a try."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a dark cola-like brown color with a flufy 2 finger head that slowly settles, leaving sticking lace as it goes down. Vanilla and caramel in the nose with a very slight hoppy character aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet start with a mix of roast and caramel that then transitions to a hop bitterness that lingers on. I love the fact that this beer is for a good cause but as a beer it is really not that memorable. The hop characteristic is pretty laid back and takes a back seat to the roastedness."
"I'd definitely drink this one again. And might do that tonight."
"As far as this relatively new style goes I'd say this is one of the examples I've liked the most."
"drinkability: nice beer... I love this style and they hit it. Not #1 by any means but very solid."
"Nothing like grabbing a bottle of Toxic Sludge to drink, am I right, folks? It pours a dark garnet-tinged black-brown. The nose is a straight yin-yang of roasted malts, cocoa, pine, and lettuce. The taste takes a similar tack, though the pine sap mixes with a roasted celery sort of character, along with a strangely bitter dark chocolate and mild coffee combination. It does not mix particularly well. The body is a strict medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, not the best black IPA I've had, but it has its moments."
"This one pours a rather dark brown with twinges of ruby that shines through. There is a head that is ecru on the surface. The smell is of slight citrus hops upfront followed by notes of black licorice and caramel. The flavor reminds mostly of roast with the bitterness of hops in the background. The bitterness really takes over on the flavors here. This oddly gets easier to drink as it goes along, which is something that I really don't think is all that common for things that I've had. This beer was better than I expected due to the believed age of this beer."
"Don't get me wrong solid, but disappointing."
"D - Very drinkable. There is a nice balance here of malt and hop. There is a slight alcohol presence, but nothing that gets in the way of the beer. Overall very smooth and crisp."
"Pours near black with a finger of head and wisps of lacing. Aroma is grassy and herbal with some crayon wax and bubblegum notes. The flavor is an improvement on the flavor with a light ashy malt and faint grassy hops. Not hugely hoppy which is good because I don't think that meshes well with the roasted malts. Just enough hops to satisfy the palate. A little watery in the flavor and mouthfeel, but overall a tasty beer that I would drink again."
"Good drink. One of the more solid BIPA's ive had!"
"A pleasingly bitter finish, but overall the flavours aren't as well balanced as I'd hoped. Regardless, an excellent cause and I'm glad to have purchased more than one."
"A terrific beer, though far more porter than black IPA to me. Either way, worth a try."
"The beer is well balanced and intersting. No hints of ABV and the smooth texture make this easy to drink. I would enjoy another bottle of this highly drinkable brew!"
"D - highly drinkable, though the dark malts & high bitterness make it savory, drinkable, but i prefer to savor each sip."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, and bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, bitter hops, and slight caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Pretty nicely balanced with a good flavor and aroma going on. This was a pretty nice representation of the style, but not the best of the style. Worth trying at least once if you can find it."
"Thanks again Joe. This isn't something I'll see every day."
"22oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep almost opaque black with a nice frothy off white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is dark malts with a hint of citrus hops. The taste is a nice amount of crisp citrus and pine hops in front of a nice dark malt backbone that produces nice cocoa and burnt caramel accents to the delicious hop profile. The beer is on the light side of medium with smooth carbonation. This is a very enjoyable Black IPA, one I would certainly have again."
"Drink is OK, some minerality with the dark malts and bitterness combined, and fairly bitter overall, but not bad."
"This is a very odd beer and sludge is an appropriate name for it. Confusing as hell, but it tastes decent and was drinkable. I'd like to try it again and see how it goes."
"Overall, very enjoyable and this bomber disappeared quickly for me. I'm not very experienced in the style but I'll be trying more soon."
"A good beer for a good cause."
"Impression: Another fine beer from a brewery that rarely hits a homerun, but always scores. If you like this style you will surely enjoy this. I do, and I did."
"22oz bottle. Pours a (big surprise) black color with a small frothy head. Some lacing. Aroma is hoppy upfront followed by some roasted malt and chooclate aromas. Piney. Taste isn't as flavorful as the smell. Pine hops and some roasted malts but its a bit thin. Flavor is more pine than anything else with just a hint of chocolate. This is a pretty good Black IPA that is easy to drink and worth a second look."
"D: Very interesting beer and one of the better black IPAs I've had. Not as heavy as the color would indicate. Definitely would have another."
"D: Don't get me wrong, this is a well done ale, but I can't imagine drinking more than a bomber in a single sitting."
"D - I am not a huge fan of IPA's but this one is decent. You could certainly have a few."
"Among the black IPAs I have had this is easily my least favorite. It's not terribly hoppy number one, and I'm not a big fan of the hop bill number two. Too roasty, not hoppy enough, and not something that I'd be eager to seek out again."
"Ruby brown with a half inch of tightly bubbled foam that lingers very very long. Very low aroma of faint hops. Initial flavor of dark malt, morphing quickly to grapefruit and orange rind. Very balanced, not too black and not too IPA. Could actually use a little more oomph on both ends of the spectrum. Full mouthfeel, a bit tannic, but satisfying. Drinkable beer, but could use more character for my tastes."
"D: Not what I was expecting but I would not mind drinking another. More on the porter side of things then an IPA but it does retaing some hop character to place it loosely in the BIPA IMO. Regardless, it is easy drinking and for a cause that is important. Even if you don't like it that much you should tell your friends to buy one to help the cause."
"Pours a deep brown color with a fantastic pillowy beige head that left a wall of sticky lacing on the glass. Settles into a rocky cap. The aroma is of muted tropical fruit hops, honey, perhaps some bread notes from the malt but nothing roasty. The taste is of a honey malt, a slight bitter roast flavor, muted tropical fruit hops which also has some resiny notes. Not a big fan of the hop profile, doesn't seem to be the same as hoptical illusion. The roasted malt comes through more as the beer warms and helps the flavor out. Moderate feel with tingly carbonation; finishes slight bitter from the roast and hops. An average black IPA. The hops should be the showcase and I didn't dig the profile. The roasted malt grew on me as I drank it and was quite nice. Not sure if I would purchase this again."
"Cheers!"
"At the brand-spankin' new Bentlee's Tavern in Mountain Lakes, NJ ...finally a decent bar in my town!!! Into a pint glass, it poured black, with no hints of carbonation, and two fingers of beige-colored head that retained and laced well. Smelled of orange peel and grapefruit, yet very herbal. The taste was much different...very caramel toffee coffee flavor with a semi-sweet finish, and coffee aftertaste. Medium thickness, and no carbonation. I wasn't expecting as much coffee and sweetness in this 'black ipa' specimen; I'm more accustomed to the earliest progenitors' examples of this style, which are much more citrus in nature. Since the nose hinted that this one would be as well, I was surprised to find that it was not. As such, I say that this is a decent beer, but a little disjointed in style."
"D - Misses the mark as an IPA, since it has little hop character in smell and taste. This came across more as a hoppy porter/stout, but still drinks fairly well."
"On the edge of being black-jet brown perhaps? Sizeable tan head. Decent floral and hoppy aroma. Good hop blast upfront flavor wise-nice blend of bitterness and hop flavor. Roasted grains are somewhat faint and in the backround. Very mild anise or licorice tinge. Good body. Very drinkable beer. My 2nd try at this style-works for me."
"It's smooth and easy-drinking. It's tasty. It's local, and it's for a good cause. So if you're looking to get into the Cascadian Dark Ale game, make sure to give Toxic Sludge a try."
"D: A pretty nice concept and a decent stab at a very trendy American style at the moment. The 7% ""black"" IPA from Blue Point may be thought of as more marketed than well-crafted, but I found it to be a satisfying, blended IPA with porter-like qualities throughout. I'd definitely try it again."
"Very happy with this beer. Could drink it all night. I do have to say seems more like an extra hoppy stout to me but enjoyable none the less!"
"Draught @ Cambridge House: This one poured a fairly opaque black color. The was a small amount of a tan head on it that left a bit of lacing. This has a nice nose to it. Lots of piney hops, with some grassiness, chocolate and roastiness to it also. The taste is also very good. Piney, chocolate, grassiness. Not quite as bitter as I would expect for an IPA, but still a fair amount of bite. Definitely worth checking out!"
"Do you hear me, Blue Point?! Make this a regular."
"Drinkability is good! I'm will definitely get another bottle if there is any still available."
"Drinkability: High. Easily sessionable. Not my favorite Black IPA, but a fine brew."
"FYI.... Blue Point will donate 100% of net proceeds from Toxic Sludge to Delaware-based Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research to fund their Spreading Our Wings Campaign and long term efforts to build a Wildlife Response Annex."
"Feel is dry and retains some of the dry texture of cocoa powder. Too dry and bitter to drink heavily, though it is alright. I am quite disappointed in this, especially for a bombered IPA from Blue Point."
"Overall this was certainly a more subtle CDA, I would actually almost consider it a hopped up porter if the roasted malt character were just a bit more robust. Not worth writing home about but it's a solid beer that's worth a shot."
"Poured into a pint glass black with a two finger off white head. Good lacing and retention. It's allergy season, so I can't smell much of anything but I can find hint of dark malts. The flavor has a nice bite of hops with dark carmeled malts Well balanced and medium bodied. Very nice black IPA."
"Pleasant enough take on a new and quickly becoming popular style. Everybody seems to be churning out a Dark IPA of some sort these days. This one was quite enjoyable and I'd give it another try, assuming its gonna be generally available, at least for a while."
"D- toxic sludge is fantastic. The flavor is outstanding and not too overwhelming. To be honest, it's incredibly drinkable as well. I highly recommend this brew... need more..."
"""SQUAWK!"""
"Pours deep purplish black with a giant dense fluffy head. The aroma is dark and sharp. The flavor is sharp and musky, with a sting of coffelike bitterness. There is currant and cherry and mesquite smoke. There is a sharp woody bitterness on the finish with a deep, enduring hop bitterness. Delicious."
"I had a draft of this at George Keeley's on the upper west side of manhattan and was told, correctly, that it was a black ipa. I was hoping to find out the abv but I guess it's not on here. Seemed a little light to me, both in alcohol and in taste and mouthfeel. The color was very dark. In general it was a decent beer just not as good as the look had seemed to promise. I'll try it again but I was not blown away by it for the first time."
"Overall a tasty and round BIPA. Nice and smooth."
"D: Very good. Not the best Black IPA I've ever had - in some ways this one is closer to an Imperial Red - but I like it all-in-all. . . ."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. It was almost refreshing. A really nice beer. If this were less than 6% I would like it even more. Good work."
"Cheers../"
"A super dark cola brown fluid with a light tan head that initially is quite large fades a little too quickly for my tastes but leaves nice amounts of lace and a thin wispy covering in my glass. Smell is dark and roasty with burnt caramel and pine. There is a deep earth behind the pine with a subtle yeast fruitiness. Taste is superb with balance being the main feature. A huge roasted malt backbone is checked by a subtle but equally large and complex hop signature. Roasted coffee and yeast rich bread give a touch of chewiness. The hops blossom from the super velvety and somewhat creamy carbonation that is integrally bound to the flavor profile. They start earthy, moving to pine and finishing with grapefruit. The roasted malt and burnt caramel envelope a yeasty breadiness that has a touch of english fruitiness. No alcohol at all. Finish is dry and short with a grapefruit and hop oil flourish lingering gently. Getting back to feel, there is a softness that reminds me of the Hoptical Illusion from a cask with nice heft and girth to this one that give a satisfying richness to the drinking experience. Having said that it still goes down easy and smoothly like a lighter beer and I would have no problem at all going through several bottles of this wonderful stuff."
"It turned out to be an interesting ale worthy of more bottles to discover it contents and the things it would go well with."
