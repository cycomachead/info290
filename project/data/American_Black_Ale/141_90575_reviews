"This beer has what I enjoy in a black IPA; crispness, slightly smoky but easy to drink without being overpowered with any of the malts or hops."
""
""
""
"So thin. No foreward taste of much. It all kinda blends. I do like the carbonation of it though- it's kinda like Sri Lanka: not as latent as a stout or porter, still stays in touch with India."
"Hop-forward, but balanced by firm, rich dark malt. Flavors blend well!"
""
"Pours a black color.  1/2 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of hops, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of oatmeal.  Fits the style of an American Black Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of hops, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of oatmeal.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body, but nothing extraordinary."

"The dark roasted malts created a taste that was a bit burnt and made the beer a little too bitter, but definitely a solid beer otherwise."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; best before 7/23/2014, 6.2%. Pours moderately murky nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, pine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice malt driven black IPA. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O-Although still within the best by date it was too malty, maybe fresh the beer would better. Then again it could just be too malty."
""
""

"My pour went off without a hitch and the resulting pseudo-cascade was a pleasure to watch. It settled into a finger of dense, light-tan/mocha-colored head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) and I have to ask if anyone really registers any beer as ""black"". Although it was dense enough to prevent any light penetration in the glass, I could see what it looked like during the pour. Nose had the dark, deep-roasted, burnt/smoky scent that I dislike in this style. I got a faint grassy mintiness from the hops, but the malts were getting in the way. Bah! Let nothing stand between a hophead and tasting his/her hops. Mouthfeel was dense, thick, especially for an IPA of any stripe. Nice. The taste, however, was a different story, or better put, it was more of the same. Man, I just cannot get past the roasty malt characteristic that defines this style. I kept tasting charcoal and not in what I would define as a pleasant way. Finish was dry, smoky, almost stout-like, but where were the hops? I weep for the hops that go into these recipes as they have given their all for naught. Nice lacing, by the way. Next!"
""
"O- Pretty good, just wish I had gotten to it when it was fresher. Even so, I feel like even at its freshest, it still wouldn't be a match for Durty."
"I don't think Smutty makes a bad beer. I've been brewing for over 15 years and I struggle to produce a beer like this. Nice hop character, great lasting dark (cholocate?) malt flavor. This is top notch stuff...and at 5.7 ABV you can have a couple and enjoy them without walking head first into the TV getting up to take a leak at halftime/end of quarter/end of peroid. If you like flavor and well crafted beer grab some of this and enjoy!"
""
""
"O: When this style first began hitting the shelves I loved it, but as more and more examples of the style came out I found myself shying away from them because they usually were underwhelming. This one is an exception. The big hop characters with only subtle ""dark"" flavors is IMO how the style should be done."

"Fresh tasting and well crafted tribute to a true Vermont craft beer pioneer"

"Pours a big, frothy brown head, close to three fingers as it crests, full-on mix of bubble sizes, from huge to tiny, dimpled all over, the lacing is thin but forms broad sheets which cover close to half the available glass space. Black liquid yet has a shiny brightness to it, this in spite of the chunky floaties inside the glass, hard to visually gauge the carbonation, shifts to a yellow hue along the rims. The nose is sweetly roasty, oodles of chocolate, coffee, hard toffee with even more malt after that, it’s hoppy in a mellow fashion, more cleansing than herbaceous, subtle floral lift, not much fruit but maybe a little earthiness. Full-bodied, thicker and denser than expected, the carbonation is slow to unwind but it does not feel flatfooted. Here too there’s a strong emphasis on roast although it does adroitly avoid bitterness. Coffee beans, cocoa, mocha more than milkiness, although there’s moments of root beer and vanilla. Mutter of quinine. The mouth feel is grippy and dry, more pine and cut grass than flowers or citrus. Again, hard to discern clear fruit presence, more apricot, maybe cherry. Because it starts with such intent and energy, it’s hard for it not to finish likewise. Sticks to the basics, does them well enough."
""
"O: Rather than punching me in the face with hop bitterness, the IPA portion of this beer integrates so well with the roasted malts, it makes me wonder if I'm really drinking a glass of cold espresso. I'd love to see this tribute become a year-round offering."

"Brewed in tribute to a late brewer and it cherishes his memory right."

"On tap at Ny Pizza. Pours black with an inch of khaki head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is a nice mix of hops and roasted malts. Hints of chocolate. The taste is chocolate and coffee with roasted malts. Less of a hop presence than I expected from the nose. Still there are some piney hop notes. Roasted malts and chocolate at the finish. Charcoal as well. Lots of carbonation. Overall, solid Black IPA but maybe a bit too roasty."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: A little thin feeling. Decent carbonation, but due to the roasty character of the beer a little more smoothness would be a nice improvement."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is definitely bitter and roast up front, with the bittersweet cocoa notes coming in around an astringent, acidic hops character. Solid and enjoyable, though not a favorite."
"Pours out thick, heavy and beastly. Yes, a beast of a beer. Many qualities of a good stout, as far as Black IPA's are concerned, this is way heavier and stronger. Aftertaste of bourbon. Heavy malt taste leaves the palate slightly dry. Nice glass lacing, The Noonan is a complex brew that gets better and takes over with every sip. I can't find any foods to pair it with yet, because this beer is almost like a meal in itself."

"A solid example of a Black IPA, although in my opinion way too close to a stout with its roast. Honestly, I would consider this beer basically a stout with a light body. While the hop character is present, it doesn't take the main stage as an IPA should. It is a good data point for this emerging style."
"O: This is the best blend of styles I’ve had in a long time, and that’s because you can taste the transformation from porter to IPA – experiencing that evolution on your palate is really interesting. It’s something you don’t come across with every hoppy black ale you try, or sometimes it’s there but it just doesn’t work; here, though, the transition to a brisk, hoppy pale is so stark and refreshing that you can’t help but enjoy it. Grab a six-pack if you can, because one won’t be enough."

"This is a rare black ale that accentuates roastiness over hoppiness. It is more closely related to a classic Baltic porter than an American Black “IPA.” I liked this beer more and more the further down the glass I got. An excellent, but definitely different kind of black ale."
""
""
"In general, the beer is roasty porter with heavy bitterness. It does not exactly hit where I want “black IPA,” although I prefer a bit more citrusy IPA than roasted malt quality. However, it still packs tons of flavor for 5.7% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Dunno who the Noonan guy is on the label and in the title but whatever he has to do with this brew he did ok. This might qualify as a Baltic or American porter. And a pretty good one."

"Overall, a very solid brew, great roasty flavor, cleaner hop profile and a creamy undertone form the nose and mouthfeel"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of coffee, roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, light hops, a touch of smokiness, mild and easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall, not a bad beer, but a little less hoppy than I would have liked for this style."

"(3.75) D: This is a solid and easy-drinking black IPA that I would gladly drink again."
""
""
"A nice black IPA that has some great roast and assertive fresh hop flavor. Good job Smuttynose!"
""
"Whereas the nose was more on the malty side, the flavor really kicks off with hoppiness. There is some semi-sweet choco here, plus some very roasty, almost burnt malt hitting the palate. But that is quickly overwhelmed by a pronounced florality, with some earthy notes mixed in as well. It is almost rindy, and that aspect lingers long in the aftertaste. Overall it is quite tasty and refreshing. A fitting tribute to an esteemed New England brewing pioneer. Prosit!"

"O: A pretty good American black ale -- definitely a sweeter take on the style and one tha I enjoyed more than most from this style. Pretty smooth with a good balance of roasted and chocolate character and a muted dark fruitiness to prevent it from being too sweet. Another solid brew from Smuttynose."
""
""

""

"Poured a clear very dark brown, opaque in the glass. Two fingers thick dense khaki colored foam, sheeting for a couple of inches down the glass. Smell: mild roast and chocolate, light berry fruitiness, pine. Taste: pine, grapefruit peel, dark but not high cocoa chocolate. Creamy upfront, prickly carbonation, medium bodied. Finish is piney and otherwise neutral (as in the abv's a little low but it's attenuated to the right spot). Straightforward but tasty and low-impact. Best by 9/13."
"Review from notes, on tap at the White Birch fest this past Aug. Pours a solid dark brown bordering on black with a smallish tan head that shows moderate retention and minimal lace. Smells of earth and pine, with a chocolate and caramel maltiness that does a fair job standing up to the hop onslaught. Taste is sweet caramel and a bit roasty and chocolaty behind lots of earthy pine and citrus. Medium body and carbonation level with a resinous and slightly chalky mouthfeel. I went back to this several times that night, this is a great brew, it should be a full time beer!"
""
""
""
""
"The biggest problem with this beer is the name. As Greg Noonan is often credited for inventing this style, a black IPA named after him should be very exceptional. This is good, but I wouldn't call it exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be a very nice beer if you are looking for lots of bitterness without the accompanying hop flavors. It's quite drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall very basic black IPA with citrus, pine, and roast and caramel, which IMO don't blend well, nothing special, very two poled beer and don't combine well. Not very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours a cola-like black with a frothy, tan head, excellent retention & lace. Piny hops, roasted malts, chocolate, and faint anise on the nose. Nice blend of roast, pine, dank citric grapefruity bitterness, faint chocolate, anise, and coffee on the palate with sharp, lingering bitterness, medium body. Overall, just what I expect from a well rounded American Black Ale."

"O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good hoppy dark beer to drink for long time."
""
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown with a half finger beige colored head atop that lasted for quite awhile.Aromas of earth,bitter chocolate,and citric hops,it does smell like a hopped up porter.Roast and earthy notes upfront with mild brown sugar-like sweetness,a shot of pin resin and sharp grapefruit in the finish.Not overly complex but flavorful,this seemed a bit more porter-like than many of the style i have had."
""
"This is full flavored and actually has some depth to it. Stout/porter/chocolate lovers will appreciate this one. It's not a mind blower, but it's well crafted. Solid brew."
""
""
""
"Fresh bottle from Premier Gourmet. Spot on black IPA, emphasizing the roast and yet still citrus hop supporting it. Above average mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Not the best black IPA I have had,owing to some burnt parts, still well crafted and worth trying. Dry finish."
"Solid Black IPA with a good orange peel and dark grain flavor."
""
"Overall a great black ale with some serious bitterness from start to finish."
"O - Smuttynose usually flies under the radar, but this is a stellar black IPA, and needs more credit, it is seriously aggressively like a good ipa, but definitely complex, and not too overwhelming. Definitely worth having again."
"A full flavored brew with great balance and taste. I bought a single, but I'd like to get more sometime this week. Good stuff!"
""
""
""
"Overall I was impressed with this one clashes the roast of a stout or porter with the bitterness of their finest kind IPA. A fairly great Black IPA overall."

"Pours black with an impressively thick head that very slowly recedes to a sustained milky covering. Initial dark chocolate and piney hop aromas becoming more grapefruity as it warms. A whiff of fresh dark malt. Roasted malt flavor met with a wall of hoppy bitterness. The malt flavor is bittersweet and charred and the hops are hard to categorize because they blend so well with the roast. It's leafy, spicy, and piney and comes across a little aggressive overall, but I'll allow it. Smooth, creamy body and fairly astringent. Solid all around, if not particularly memorable..."
"Overall, very decent for the style. Drinkable and not over done."
""
""
""
"O: Aroma lacks IPA hoppiness, but the taste is true to style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little too roasty for my liking. Burnt is not a flavor I enjoy. Would benefit from more base malt, less roast, and more hop character."
""
""
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Piny hop notes increase, along with mineral water bitterness. Light chocolate and caramel notes fill in. Hop and roasted malt bitterness take over the finish. Hints of earthy tobacco and licorice. Lingering piny, herbal hop bitterness and a little chocolate malt. Medium body with a dry feel. A very nice black IPA."
"A very solid black IPA with mild hop flavors and more roasty malt flavors like a stout. Yet, the dryness is there, which I'd prefer to be balanced by more sweetness. If there's one weakness, its that this is just a little thin in feel and taste, but not so much that it feels watery or bland. Would I like a little more body and spiciness or chocolate/coffee? Yes. But this is satisfying anyway. I could easily drink again."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the feel. Each sip is delightfully slurpable, with appropriate body, soft creaminess, and nice fizziness. The coloring is also robust for the style, and the aroma gives a good deal of complexity through its fusel qualities. The flavoring remains uniform throughout, keeping things smooth, predictable, and flowing. While some may see this as a bad thing, it actually remained easy going and very drinkable. This is a serious take stylistically and certainly in line with some of Smuttynose’s top beers."
"As a fan of Greg's writings, I get the sense that this is a forward-thinking ale that which he would have found great comfort."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice array of scents ranging from bitter black malts, roasted malts, and citrus hops. It's bone dry and inviting with lots of complexity. The taste is good as well. It's extremely balanced with excellent malt character and hop flavor. It's goes down silky smooth and finishes dry with a roasted/black malt feel. The hop character add a mild citrus flare and adds a mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer that's interesting and delicious."
"Overall: Pretty solid BIPA. I could definitely have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts off watery but this quickly yields to some strong burnt malt. The aftertaste is a lens of hop and malt bitterness. The body is thin and the carbonation high, but it doesn't detract from the strong finishing flavors."
""
""
"O: A pretty simple black IPA. Really nice bitterness but flavors are fairly soft, muted and simple. Pretty much expected given the ABV. Not bad though, I enjoyed it. On the bitter end of a black IPA for sure, not much roasted malt here."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, chestnut highlighted brown-to-black coloring with a frothy, filmy, clingy, light tan head that starts a solid inch, but settles quickly into a lingering surface coating. Solid cling all over the glass as you drink. Aromas of dark roast coffee on a subtle backbone with a heavy dose of floral and fruity hops. Grapefruit and mango blend for the fruity highlight, with a resiny ribbon throughout. Flavors are very bitter and in your face initially. Hop heads rejoice. Resiny and sharp on the forward tongue, with a bitter blast that dries and slightly puckers. The heavy roast and coffee characteristics creep in on the backside of the palate, but the middle of the tongue is locked in to the resiny, fresh hops characteristics completely. The coffee roast flows into the aftertaste, bringing a bit more balance than the palate had during the initial tasting. Floral highlights dance throughout, giving a lightness to the heavy bitterness your mouth is getting hit with. Dry, bitter finish that lingers for a second and then completely vanishes, leaving the palate clean and clear for another flurry of punches from this robust beer. A bit unbalanced, but a tasty brew. Definitely not for those unlearned in the ways of the hops, but as I said before, hop heads rejoice...this one certainly is!"
""
"Nice brew and while it may more closely resemble a porter than a Black IPA, it is just as advertised and when keeping in mind what this recipe was when originally brewed, this beer is delicious."
""
"It has a thick malty mouth that is pulled away from an elusive sweet caramel into burnt bitterness. It is very crisp and refreshing and has some good complexities in the interplay of sweet and bitter, but bitter definitely dominates almost to a fault. There is some nice bitter citrus and pine, but the burnt malt bitterness overshadows the rest. A very good beer none-the-less."
""
""
""
"O: A solid black IPA with a nice mix of hops and roasted malts. Balanced, smooth, and easy to drink. A good choice for their new spring seasonal"
"Overall a very solid offering in a style that varies greatly from beer to beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"[O] Either an aggressively hopped black ale or an overly roasted black IPA - neither of which suit my tastes too well but this is a good beer nonetheless."
"O: I don't understand kids today and I still think these Black IPA are just a well hopped, unbalanced Robust Porter. That being said I like the blend of citrus and chocolate/coffee malt with the agressive hops bitterness going on here. The hops get just a tad harsh on the finish which could be reduced by the use of higher alpha hops, not that I'm complaining."
"12oz bottle. Pours black with a rich and creamy mocha head. Robust sticky lace soaps the sides of the glass. This smells of a rich blend of chocolate, caramel, coffee and ripe citrus. A floral and lightly spicy feel hangs on the edges of the nose. The taste is similar, with a robust yet smooth mix of chocolate and caramel malts, a firm leafy and spicy green bitterness and coffee flavor throughout that leaves this burnt and roasted in the finish. The feel is medium with soft creaminess that spreads out and prickles the tongue a bit. Nice smooth feel here to this. This was a really nice take on a Black IPA, with a well balanced mix of flavors and a super drinkable body. A well done tribute beer for sure."
"An interesting tribute to Greg Noonan that if I'm correct, mimics VT Pub's own Blackwatch IPA, which is said to be the (or one of, depending on who you ask) prototype for the American Black Ale style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours black (more of a dull dark brown held to the light) with 1/2 an inch of a creamy looking tan head that fades quickly while lacing. The nose is that mocha milk stout-ish upfront followed by some subtle hops...hops which are present only after sniffing this brew harder than you'd have to sniff glue sticks just to get a decent buzz going. More citrusy/floral hop profile, which isn't my favorite mix for the style. Word of advice, let this guy warm a tad before drinking. The taste brings that neglected bitterness to the center stage bumpin disco on my taste buds and just as that glue buzz is fading the big carob/chocolate malt base is there to catch you. This beer works its cascade-y bitterness hard on my unsuspecting palate, front to back, working for dollars, but lacks the generally expected roast/toast/caramel sweetness component. It still drinks smooth and all harshness is derived from the hops. Good black IPA, distinct in its ability to slap your mouth in its face with hops no apologies, but I would have liked a bit more backbone."
""
"O: Tasty, very flavorful, kinda like a super robust porter. High bitterness especially for ABV. Worthy purchase and up to the smuttynose standard. Glad I bought it, but in the future I would probably tick something else."
""
""
"O/D-Pretty solid, minus the nose. I may need to come back to this one to makes sure my review is applicable."
""
"O: A fitting tribute to the man who may very well have invented the style as we know it. Great balance between the hops and the roasted malts. A double-whammy of bitterness offered by each as well. An even more enticing buy at the affordable six pack price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A really solid example of the style, very balanced and full-flavored. Nicely done, I think Mr. Noonan would be proud."
