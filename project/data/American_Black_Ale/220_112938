On the palate the initial attack is roasted malts, a hint of chocolate followed by a nice lingering, piney hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy - carbonation is mild but adequate. This is without a doubt the best black ale I've had to date. This style of beer usually tastes disjointed to me but not NightTime. Lagunitas has done a great job of creating a balanced and full flavored black ale. Not to be missed.","bound4er","Mar 30, 2015"

No alcohol present in this which will creep upon you. At first I get the feeling that this beer isn't aware of what it really is but then I realize it's the mixture that hits on all points and no where in here does it seem to fall flat or awkward. Excellent beer all around. I think it has one of the best mouthfeel/taste combo out there.","Chris585","Beers"

This offering specifically, however, seemed especially disjointed and at times outright offensive to the senses. Beneath the already questionable combination of burnt malt and piney hops (not that there's anything wrong with that...) was a note of 'chemical'. I don't think I was poisoned, but this off-flavor was prominent enough to deduct significantly from otherwise wholesome flavors. But I can say this: it was not a pussy beer. It put its flavors out there for all to see, and if you didn't like it, then to hell with you. ;)","1000lbgrizzly","Beers"

This beer has a serious 'west coast' style hop profile, to use cliches, but lacks the roasted malt backbone its color and style suggest. I may be fixating on the trivia, but I guess it's just leaving me a little confused since it tastes like it's golden in color, but boasts its 'darkness.' A drinkable, enjoyable ale none the less, though. Would be happy to have this anomaly at my disposal at all times! Mouthfeel and finish are prime.","DagenhamDavis","Mar 10, 2015"
4.07,-1,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"This black IPA brings an intense hop profile that is well complemented by the dark malt. I wouldn't call it ""balanced", but I also wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone looking for something balanced. The dank, grassy, piney hops dominate in both the nose and palate. The smooth dark roasted malt is just along for the ride. Just a bit on the thin side, but far from watery. Medium carbonation suits it well. Overall, a fairly refreshing IPA with a nice hop punch. Tends to ruin the palate for subsequent beers, so I prefer this on nights where I'm only going to drink one.","glass_house","Mar 10, 2015"

I've been looking forward to its release since the last time I had some was straight out of the tap in the employee lounge at the Lagunitas Chicago location (my son in law had a part time summer job there).  I'm not much of a dark beer guy but this tastes like a bold IPA with a slight sweet stout flavor. There seems to be 5 or 6 flavors going on while I drink this that I can't quite describe other than an overall heavenly taste.","RickW574","Feb 20, 2015"

Bottled on ""42", so by Lagunitas's way of thinking this is the 42nd day of 2015, which would be within the past week+ by my estimation.  So, super fresh.  Poured into snifter.  Looks awesome - about a finger head, laces very well.  Smells like a Lagunitas beer, lots of hops in the nose.  Taste is hop forward with the roasty malts that the style needs.  I am a big fan of the black ales/IPAs and Nighttime doesn't disappoint.  It's a toss up between this and Maine's Weez as the best in style I have had.","Jwburns75","Feb 19, 2015"

After a bit of chilling to about 50 degrees F,  I poured a nice pint which showed a brownish red, not black but not translucent either.  One inch head lingered for quite a while and left heavy lacing.  Aroma is sweet, malty, and nutty with a bit of funk.  Taste is similar but lacking funk, the sweetness is well balanced with a bit of bitters and maltiness, some fruit qualities, although a coffee aftertaste presents.  Mouth feel starts creamy but quickly changes to a slight carbonated bite.","MDHopster","Dec 13, 2014"

Nice nose of sweet tropical citrus (orange, pineapple), pine, chocolate/toffee and a touch of roast over a slight alcohol note. Almost light medium bodied with a just a touch of slick texture. Above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent middle and finish. The flavor profile is complex, well balanced and does a stellar job of hiding the alcohol. It begins with the sweet tropical, then flows to pine as the mild bitterness begins. The middle is where this beer excels. As the bitterness equilibrates, the coffee/toffee, roast and sweet chocolate come to the forefront in an effervescent flash. The finish is somewhat dry and leaves a nice lingering light bitterness on the tongue with a light toffee and chocolate flavored sweetness coupled with a hint of grapefruit rind tartness.","tillmac62","Oct 16, 2014"

Nose is piney in the foreground with a slight roasted quality in the back.  Taste consistent with nose with the addition of baker's chocolate and a light, slightly medicinal bitterness lingering between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and a slight acidity.  For me, this beer didn't capitalize on the roasty/malty goodness I've come to associate with the style.

The nose comprises coffee, cocoa powder, grapefruit zest, and a touch of treacle.  The taste is a straight blast of cocoa- and coffee-covered grapefruit (ruby red and yellow, baby), the two factions putting on a great performance of West Side Story: what seems like fighting is actually tightly-choreographed and highly cooperative dancing.  There's also a nice underlying current of molasses throughout.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this is one of the best black IPAs I've had lately, one I might actually look forward to enjoying again at a later date.  Well done, Lagunitas.","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2014"

Really like the clean biting taste of this one - a bit like a floor cleanser - but in a good way. I taste pine, apricot, dark fruits, and a light smokey backbone. Like the way this beer sticks to the back of the tongue as it goes down, begging for another sip. Overall a really nice black ale and at $4.99 a bomber (in North Texas) a real value.","coldriver","Aug 01, 2014"

Nose of grapefruit like hops, deeply roasted grains, a earthy goodness. Nice taste profile going on here, grapefruit and citrus hops up front mingling nicely with sweet roasted malts on the back and sides. Herbal like quality with a roasted grains and syrupy sweet malts dripping down a cascade of citrus hops. It is not what I expected, nor what I was really after in a dark brew. That said, it is a hop heads delight and a foray into the darker side of ale without leaving the realm of overly hopped beers. Excellent, but still---can we tame some of the hops so I can taste something other than grapefruit citrus hops?","Brutaltruth","Beers"

Poured with a short, light beige foam that reduced to a thin cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Dank, ripe citrus hop aromas along with earthy, grainy, roasted malt and fresh, resinous pine hop notes at the end. Full bodied, smooth creamy body up front that, resinous feel through the middle, and tangy, tight, carbonation from the middle to the end. Roasted malt and tropical citrus hop flavors up front with the hop flavor expanding into the middle. Pine hop flavors are introduced in the middle overtop the sturdy roasted malt backbone and slowly expand from the middle to the end. Finished cleanly with a lingering roasted malt and bitter hop aftertaste. Complex and enjoyable.","IronLover","Jul 29, 2014"

Right when I cracked open the bottle I could smell it. It was delicious. Since I'm still new to craft beer I usually can't pick out individual fruits that hops give off, but right away I got mangoes. The taste didn't disappoint either. The malts balanced the hops so that it was easy to drink for such a big ABV. And of course the mangoes... I honestly can't rave about this enough. To date it's probably the best beer I've had (but I'm still new to craft beer). I'm definitely gonna buy another one or two","nreed","Jul 19, 2014"

The aroma is a combo of toasted malt and piney hops. The taste follows the nose with the toasted malt character upfront followed shortly by a piney hop flavor. A resinous hop bitterness lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, but with a noticeable carbonation bite. Overall, the beer is not too complex, but is nevertheless delicious and thoroughly enjoyable. Will definitely grab this one again.","thomda11","Jul 15, 2014"

The taste is hoppy, with the pine and citrus bouncing off each other. There is a nice weight to the body and a smooth mouthfeel. My only complaint, really, is that this isn't what I was expecting. It pretty much tastes like Latunitas IPA with a different malt bill. Which is what it is. Dialing up the ABV doesn't make it something else. Strong Ale means something, in beer terms. And this isn't it. So enjoy the beer, because it IS well made. Just know this isn't a strong ale.","delta490","Jul 06, 2014"

The nose is very hop forward with grapefruit rind being the predominant aroma with slight hints of pine and mango. There was very little roast on the nose and it only revealed itself as it warmed. If I wasn’t looking at this dark as night brew I would swear it was an IPA on aroma alone. The taste followed with strong grapefruit rind and a little more of the pine and mango notes than the aroma. As it warmed the dark roasted malts came through at the end and mingled with the hops to create a beautiful bitterness on my palate.

First thing that hits me in the aroma is wet, citric hops and then a burst roasted malts, even a little bready, with some minor chocolaty sweetness. The sweetness seems to disappear in the taste as this medium-bodied and smooth beer (slightly filling with a little breadlike note) is mostly roasted malts and citric hops. Finishes dry and a little boozy. The balance is there but it's more roasted malts and hops than anything else and not too much else in the flavor department. Not bad but just wish for a little bit more.","clayrock81","Jun 21, 2014"

The nose is malty with some very nice hop notes, slight licorice. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy. Medium body, with a slight dry/bitter finish, ABV hidden very well. Overall another very tasty brew from Lagunitas, well done, would recommend.","Wasatch","Jun 21, 2014"

Great aroma dominated by citrus hops, light tropical and orange family fruit, lighter toasted malt. Flavor is mellow dark, lightly toasted malt, dank citrus and piney hops, cocoa, finishes with a lingering piney hop bitterness. Excellent creamy body and mouth feel. A stellar Cascadian Dark Ale, with a well selected hop mix and very sturdy, but not invasive dark toasted malt body. Lots of flavors and hard to slowly sip. I expect the best from Lagunitas and they delivered again. Very poor distribution; one of the best bottle shops in Seattle told me this wasn't bottled, only on tap. I believed that until I found this lone bottle on a shelf in a grocery store. Haven't seen or heard of a bottle before or since. Weirdly hard to find for this brewery.

Glad we get to partake of the finished product. I have been anticipating this one and it does not disappoint. Surprisingly dark and opaque, pitch brownish black with no real color halo and a rich, creamy tan head. Massive fresh hop aroma greets the drinker, big tangerine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit (mango, pineapple) notes. Notably subdued malt aroma although one does get some roast. Shockingly bitter yet juicy at the same time, mixed citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, lime), pineapple, guava, unripe peach, marijuana resin, and carrot all join a hop flavor blitz that rides atop some instant coffee and licorice candy. There is a lot of pine here as well, wet needles and an almost ammonia-like Buckley's mixture cough syrup vibe that builds and builds but fails to entirely overpower a sweet tropical fruit leather note in the background. Strong floral hop aromas and flavors arrive late. This thing is heady and potent yet complex enough to keep one interested for the duration of an entire bomber. Moderate of body and low in carbonation to my palate, with tons of oily resins in the bitter yet fruity finish. Unique black IPA in its strong emphasis on dank and powerful resinous hops that are somehow delivered in a fashion that does not completely squash more subtle fruit and dark malt flavors. Wonderful.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 11, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with bright citrus/grassy hops and moderate roasted malt presence; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine and moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/grassy hops with moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly sticky/creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/grassy hops and moderate roasted malt flavor; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

What I've come to realize is that the key to this style is to drink them as fresh as possible. This is almost a month old and has kept it's hop character nicely. My favorite of the style has been Founders Inspired Artist and the roast in that started to take over more quickly than this one. Really happy with this beer and hope Lagunitas releases it a couple of times a year because great black IPAs are hard to find.","PaulyB83","Jun 08, 2014"

4.3,4.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Overall, it is hard to express how excited we were for this beer. Lagunitas produces some of our all-time favorite hoppy beers, and as big fans of black IPAs/ales, we couldn’t hardly wait. The result is a wonderful black ale, with nearly superfluous hoppiness. At certain points, and especially with warmth, the hop profile actually reminded us somewhat of Heady, in all of the fruitiness and cloying sweetness, with bitterness only developing on the deep aftertaste. That said, there is not really much bitterness to speak of, and the beer develops and warms to fit your palate and your taste buds. The “black” part of the beer is there as well, giving smoke and a pseudo meatiness to it, helping to quell the frank sweetness it’s up against. We urge Lagunitas to make this year round, as it is premier for its style.","TheBrewo","Jun 07, 2014"

4.01,-2.4,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"Dark brown , basically opaque beer with a a creamy medium sized tan colored head. Lace is spotty. Aroma is a plethora of fruity grapefruit, juicy citrus, resinous pine, and malty meaty, roasty aromas. Meaty onion forward steak matinade meets tropical and juicy graefruit. Very interesting, unusual, and fun. Taste is ripe indeed with piles of grapefruit and roasty toasty malts. Brisk, spicy, juicy, and roasty. Mouthfeel is medium dry, slightly syrupy, slick and fullish in body.","tastybeer","May 30, 2014"
4.42,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very dark brown, just some deep chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass, covered with a slab of tight-bubbled creaminess. Resinous oily hops dominate the aroma, not much from the malt. Juicy, pulpy grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and sprucy, herbal dankness. Flavor is a blast of fruit and pine: pineapple, ripe mango, grapefruit. A bit more malt in the mouth, a subtle coffee presence in the finish, but unlike many examples of the style, the hops are very much in charge here. Oily, resinous, dank...maybe a slight sweet nutty quality. Creamy, plush feel that dries out in the end. Delicious!","wedge","May 30, 2014"

Not surprisingly, the two taste similar. I'll try to return to this one semi-regularly.","ThisWangsChung","May 30, 2014"

The nose is a very fresh, very dank blend of west coast hops. Lots of pine, weed, and citrus. There is also a nice roasted malt undertone; with hints of coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and yet sticky with hop resin. The flavor is quite hop forward for the style, but I expect that from Lagunitas. The roasted malt is present but subtle. Very well done hop forward black ipa. And given the price, well worth picking up a couple bombers of.","lochef81","May 30, 2014"

Aromas of dank and resinous hops forward, roasted notes in the backbone, hints of coffee, and citrus highlights throughout. Very balanced for such an aromatic nose. Flavors are roasted and bitter forward, with a blast of cut grass, pine resin, and tart grapefruit notes. Very balanced, with hints of char and roast throughout. The body is full and robust, but fairly light, too, keeping the drinkability up. Roasted and bitter aftertaste, with lingering citrus notes in there as well. Solid, balanced brew. The finish is smooth and slick, with a roasted and slightly bitter linger. The slightly elevated ABV is completely masked with the smooth body and full palate.

Taste features heavy pine with a twinge of onion/garlic hop character. High level of bitterness with a stuff malt profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick with mild to high carbonation. Overall, the color makes no difference in this brew, if blind folded id have no idea it's a black ale.","homebrew311","May 18, 2014"

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of cocoa and citrus zest characteristics.","UCLABrewN84","May 17, 2014"

This beer leaves a light foam lacing as it dwindles down the glass. This beer has a nice hoppy flavor and a subtle creamy after taste. Very well done. It is a special beer that may be my new favorite from Lagunitas. I will be buying this again. Cheers.","Screwz","May 14, 2014"
4.1,-0.2,3.75,4.25,4,4,4.25,"22oz bottle. Pours a dark brownish black with over an inch of frothy light brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is citrus andr piney hops along with some roasted malts. Hints of chocolate. The taste is lots of the citrus and pine hops followed up by the roasted malts with some charcoal. Some chocolate towards the end but with more of the citrus and piney hops. Roasty finish. Slick mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Has that typical Lagunitas hop profile that I love. This is probably one of the better Black IPAs out there and the price is fantastic. Overall, I will be buying more of this.","PicoPapa","May 14, 2014"

Despite it's heft I'd like this in 4 or 6 packs to enjoy more frequently. Certainly worth a try, particularly if you enjoy the style.","ThickNStout","May 09, 2014"
4.1,-0.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"It looks like a stout with a deep black hue and a thick khaki head but it smells like an IPA. Grapefruit, lemon, pine, caramel, chive, cannabis and Bit O Honey candies all meet the nose. The flavor has so much going on with a prominent hop face but a real strong malt backdrop. The hops come through with grapefruit rind, lemon, tropical fruit and honey while the flavor then turns to a molasses, charred ember, and malted barley. This drinks very easy, with a touch of bitterness, but a smooth drinkability. Lagunitas rocks another one and this time it's a bit different from the rest.","KYGunner","Beers"
