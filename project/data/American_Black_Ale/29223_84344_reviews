"Overall, we would be hard pressed to call this one a “black IPA”.  Judging by the nose alone you would be more apt to think this was a clean stout, or even the darkest of brown ales.  Actually, it’s quite nice.  The taste comes across like the most bitter coffee stout, but again, with almost no hop component whatsoever.  Regardless, we were very happy to find Indeed’s beers on tap here.  This brewing company was on “must visit” lists of several of our locals, but since we couldn’t fit it in, this worked well in absentia.  According to the bartender at Republic, this was the only place in the city we could actually find this beer on nitro.  While we feel it didn’t necessarily do the beer justice in the hop department, it was tasty and exciting nonetheless."

"O- This beer lives up to how awesome the can is.  A solid black ale with no flaws.  Would love to try other beers from Indeed."
"Looks like a Guinness, smells like an ipa. Malty and dry. Not a big fan of this style"
"The beer is pleasant and not too heavy. I like this beer and buy it occasionally, but I have to say, the resin/piney character gets to be a bit much for me."

"O: aggressively hopped black ale.  Would make a great transition from summer to fall.  A friend sent this my way and I'm glad he did."

"D: This black IPA drinks more like an IPA mixed with a black ale. The two parts seem to remain apart...not melding as much as one would like."

"Overall: I have tried many of the Indeed beers on tap or in cans, and this remains one of my favorites. I love that perfect mix of hops and dark roasted malts and could drink this one all day long...and I have! Another winner from Indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Indeed are making some very excellent brews. This is a surprising year round offering as well."
"Overall a really good example of the style and worth getting again."
""
"I prefer their pale ale personally for their regular beers but this is every bit as good per style."
""
""
""
"Recommendation - Since the brewery was so packed I couldn't get in, I was glad to bring this home and recommend you do as well."

"Whoa! I underestimated this beer! The hops and malt dance in perfect harmony here. Try this beer, please."
""
"this is how i like my black ales. big, bold, and hopped to high heaven. the can pours a matte dark brown color with a robust inch of tan head and leaves glorious ring lacing as it drinks, never losing its layer of froth. the nose is bitter hops and darkly roasted barley, a double dose of bitter that transfers well to the taste. layers of chocolate malt weave with layers of piney hops, an enjoyable back and forth as i sip. clean finishing with just bitterness left behind. it drinks full bodied and smooth like a big american porter, and is carbonated just right for it to be both lively and smooth at the same time. a very enjoyable beverage, my first from indeed."

"O- A good beer. Well balanced and flavorful. Doesn't strike me as hoppy as some may be looking for in the style, but very good."

"A nice, well crafted beer."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this one as well, and it seems this brewery's beers are best consumed fresh to get to the core of their nicely developed hoppy profiles. This one is a simple one indeed, but where it excels it is very flavorful. Not nearly as decadent or boozy as other good black IPAs available out there. If this was present where I lived I'd definitely get some again."
""
""
"Drinkability: Pretty good stuff. Very well-crafted and flavorful. I bet this can is on the older side, so I wonder what a fresher edition would taste like."
""
""
"Roasted barley and moderate coffee bitterness up front. Some charred, cindery notes. Piny, resinous bitterness increases through the palate. Slight dark fruit malt sweetness mid-palate. Great mix of roasted malt, coffee, and piny hops into the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Very nicely made black IPA."
""
"very nice offering"
""
"O: Midnight Ryder is far cry from Day Tripper which blew me away. This black IPA is too roasty which to my palate clashes with the resinous hoppiness. I qualify this review by saying I am not the biggest black IPA fan."

"Overall: Really enjoyable beer, I really like the American Black Ale style. I'm worried that the six pack I bought was not terribly fresh; hop flavors seemed a bit muted from I was expecting. Will try to find another, definitely fresh six pack and revisit my review at that time."
"O. This is unique brew. It's more bitter, not hoppier, but bitter than most IPAs yet it has a nice porter-like smoke to it. All in all, I enjoy this. Don't love it and can't have much more than one at a time."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice beer from a new-to-me brewery; it doesn't quite come together but it works out pretty well"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty darn good. A sixer would last me a while, but it'd be a treat when I broke one out. More assertive than your typical black ale, and does it well. Definitely recommended."

"like licking below mike piazza's eyelid, in a good way."
""
"Overall: This is a really really solid local beer. I still give the nod to New Glarus Blacktop because it has a better mouthfeel and is much more balanced than Midnight Ryder. I did enjoy the art on the can. It looks like Teddy Roosevelt riding a bear drinking coffee from a mug. Classic! Some minor teaks to this beer and it would be world class. Better than average example for this beer style. If you love resinous pine hops this is a must try beer, but I prefer balance and complexity for a beer in this beer style."
""
"Overall- A great beer as I expected. I really like what I have had from indeed. Plenty of substance to go with the taste."

"O: A solid ABA overall. It's a little on the bitter/charred side for me, but is still enjoyable and mixes the hop and roasted malt characters well."

"The alochol is hidden behind the bitter notes very well. Finishes cleaner than expected, almost like a lager than a ale. Would recommend and gladly drink again."
"Thanks for this one Eric!"
""
"Overall: I'm not the biggest black IPA fan but got a 6er to support this local brewery. Midnight Ryder is well made and pretty tasty even though it's not my favorite style. I prefer Day Tripper over this one."
""
"O - Great. Tastes fantastic, very drinkable for a solid black IPA, think your ends of the spectrum, basic hoppy v. sweet and amp up each end a dozen times, and you get this beer - it still balances each other but still very taste laden and full of flavor. Great example of the style, something the community should strive for. Out of a can nonetheless! Dispute solved!!"
""
"O - Third Indeed brew for me and another good beer. Must get more next time I'm in MN."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really very tasty. Not a style I reach out for very much anymore, but to me this is done to near perfection."
""

"On tap at the taproom. Dark brown and clear with good looks in every way. The hops are fresh, Indeed: smells almost like hop pellets with roast lurking in the background. Hard to decipher hop flavor in the taste though, but there's ample bitterness and roast. Medium mouthfeel, relatively clean finish and good drinkability."
""
"Medium bodied, smooth, with soft carbonation. Very easy to drink. I could drink this on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer, and easy drinking."
"overall: OK - dug the APA from these guys more"
"A very good beer, black with generous head. A substantive roast, yet takes an appropriate submissiveness to the hop story. Very smooth drinker, with a roast not a coffee bitterness in the finish. The aroma of roast, chocolate, spruce, pine combs. Thanks John"
""
""
"Picked up a can at Four Firkins. Tasty, reminds me of the Summit Black IPA they brewed a year or two back. This is a touch more bitter, with a big dry cocoa and grapefruit finish. To back up, the aroma brings an herbal citrus hops hit with dark bread crust. The malts bring an extra-dark chocolate flavor that ties into the bitter citrus hops with a slight burnt edge. This is a great example of the style, go find yourself a can."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied, leading to full with the malt. Good carbonation."
"This has that great combination of dark roast and hops, light body and dark flavor. Very nice. One of the better black IPAs I've had. It's simultaneously light, dark, rich, and hoppy. The bitter characters of the dark roasted malts and the hops blend together really nicely, and the aromatic hops lighten things up. Really tasty. An impressive first brew from Indeed; looking forward to trying more of their stuff."
""
"Overall a very nice black ale."
""
""
""
""
"D - Crushed a can no problem and would happily have another. Not quite as easy-drinking as Day Tripper, but a really excellent take on a style I don't always enjoy. If you like Black IPAs I'd highly recommend checking this one out."
""
""
"Overall: A very good Black Ale. Big hops and bitterness but it manages to be fairly balanced with a pretty good dark roast presence. Very nicely done."
""
"O= This baby is beautiful. I have high hopes for this brewery now. Two beers that are awesome this this one being world class. Keep an eye out for Indeed brewing because they are gonna be doing big things."
"Overall: This beer was awesome, and I went in with no idea what to expect. Definitely get this if you can. Haha, can. Punny."
""
"O: Pretty good, but room for improvement to me."
"Overall this is one of the best Black IPAs I've had."
"A awesome beer, I've been sampling some local stuff all day for darkness eve and this takes it so far."
""
"If the rest of this new breweries portfolio is as impressive as this beer, they are going to be a very big thing. Now I just wish their beer did not sell out so fast so I could try Day Tripper."
""
""
""
"Will buy again."
"A pleasant surprise overall, and combined with Day Tripper, quite a start for a young brewery."
"Overall: Other than some of the insane Imperial ones, this nails the American Black Ale style better than anything I have had. Between this and Day Tripper, Indeed is the most promising new brewery I have tried in years. I really want to see what they do next."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious beer. It's an amazingly drinkable beer considering the rich taste. Hats off to the brewer!"
""
"Enjoyed on tap at the 2012 ABR, from notes. Pour was black but not viscous kicking up a half finger of tan foam. The nose and flavor were very roasty, and the taste smokey. Underlying this was citric and resin hop flavor, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Mildly bitter. Medium body. The smoke tended to overpower the flavors in the samples we tried at the festival. Will try it again at some point no doubt."
""
""
"To reiterate: Tasty stuff. I like it. Rewarding, satisfying, and one to return to again and again, with many pleasures to return on each new trip. I'll be doing this one again and again."
"At the Indeed tap room. Solid black, dark khaki head and fair lacing. Smell of chocolate, coffee, light roasted malts and light citrus hops. The taste is more of the dark than the hops, but still tasty. Coffee and chocolate go all the way into the finish and aftertaste. The citrus hops are more underlying. Silky smooth feel with a medium full body. Overall a terrific example of the style. Can't wait for this to come out in cans as I will drink it pretty regularly."
"Only the second black ale or whatever you'd call it that I'd drink again. This is an excellent brew, & if it's any indication of what's going to be flowing out of Indeed, I'll be back. Bock. Yeah."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Great beer from a new brewery. A flagship American Black Ale is just what this Pale Ale, IPA and Wheat Beer saturated market needs! Will be buying this when it's available at in liquor stores."
"On cask at Town Hall Tap. This beer arrives a black color. The head is one inch of dense tan foam that doesn't really recede, but leaves a nice coating of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is quite malty with a ton of roasted malt, some chocolate, hints of maple syrup, and grapefruity hops. The taste is similar to the aroma. It leans toward the maltier side for an American Black Ale, but the hops are still an integral component of the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer that I will surely drink again."

"The second flagship of this newest of Minneapolis breweries, this beer was enjoyed both in its natural form, but also on cask with two versions, one dry hopped with CTZ and another with Cascade. Lighter than most American Black Ales, this beer strives for balance and drinkability, rather than heavily roasted or bracing citrus hop flavors. Black in color, but not deep, with brownish edges and a beige cap of foam. Above average."
