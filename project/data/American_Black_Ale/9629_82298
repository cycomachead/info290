3.51,-15,4,3,3.5,4,3.75,"Overall-  I was honestly expecting more hop action coming from this brew. it's bitter and has a slightly floral/citrusy hop presence but it's pounded by the malt. this beer reminds me of I think it's anger by greenbush brewery and nighttime by lagunitas. it's playyyyyed! maybe it's the style TO ME but all these black ipa's seem the same. drinkable but nothing special. if you're looking for more of a dark malt driven showcase with some slight hop action this is a beer for you. I just prefer hop explosion.","claminat420","Apr 01, 2015"

4.18,1.2,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"one of the better shorts beers i have had, these guys are so hit or miss, so its nice to find a hit this strong, thanks to thebrewo for this one. everything you want in a black ipa here, piney bitter hops, literally like a forest in the night, its malt base is bitter too, tons of roast, bitter coffee grinds with the hops, but lots of body too, rich but dry, insanely flavorful, and honestly one of the best examples of the style i have had this year. it seems like the good ones they do never make it to colorado, but the hype around them is real. this has a cocoa layer in it, and some oily properties despite its seeming duality between hops and gain, these elements make it less bitter double jeopardy, and more approachable. it is different in its dry finish though, and in its well hidden abv. these black ipas often come across hot, and this one doesnt at all. palate coating but not super heavy, which is nice. i would imagine big C strain hops, although i cant be sure. not overly complex, but it doesnt need to be. a very easy drinking big beer, and frankly one of the more memorable ones from these guys. excellent late winter early spring seasonality as well.","StonedTrippin","Mar 03, 2015"

Great lacing, let it sit as it just gets better. i get black patent malts heavy with no smoke but a coffee grind palette and a slight sweet maltiness.

This ale pours a deep rich black (almost stout like) with a very slight tan head and substantial lacing. The nose is perplexing. There are substantial hop notes with a good deal of pine and grass along side those of coffee and carmely roasted malts. Unfortunately there is also something slightly off and skunky in nature. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. Medium bodied with a nice coating feel. It is actually lighter than I would have guessed it to be. The flavors mirror the nose. With a bitter piney hoppiness upfront followed by a deep coffee/chocolaty malty sweetness. This is damn good and one of the best black ipas I've had. Maybe there is hope for Shorts yet.","lochef81","Mar 04, 2014"

Shorts def puts their skillful hallmark on the deeep daaaarrrk malt bill on this one, but never letting you forget they're the maestros of hop manipulation either. It's kinda like looking up at the hugest, most scary roller coaster in the park. Getting strapped in. And getting the ride you expected, but you didn't die. You didn't even shit yourself. You loved it so much, you got back in line and took it for another ride. Then you gleefully dreamt about it that night, while unknowingly grew a bigger pair.","malty","Apr 05, 2013"

Shorts Brewing has been hit or miss IMO but this one is excellent! A nice solid fairly malty backbone to complement the flavorful hops. Not too overwhelming on either the malt or the well rounded hop profile, I would love to have more than one of these, although I would feel much better about drinking it pretty fresh (as I just did). Good choice and thanks again, my favorite black IPA to date!","sendsilk","Apr 05, 2013"

It's solidly medium bodied smooth, sweet followed by a lingering bitterness and great drinkability for black IPA.

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 1/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pine, orange zest, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, orange rind, and floral hops. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, orange rind, cocoa, light char, floral, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, pine, citrus zest, cocoa, char, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Black IPA. Great balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Feb 24, 2013"

4.44,7.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a good example of the style, but there's no confusing this with any other American Black Ale, it's a completely different animal, it's very unique. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, but it's a little too intense to drink multiples of, so I think one bottle is enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and taste, they were really nice, intense yet balanced, I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't say that there's anything that I didn't like or would want to change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again if they release it again, it's already all gone in my area, so I'm glad I picked up a few of these, I recommend this to anyone whole loves Black IPA's and all around intense beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I always expect good things from short's, it's what they do, but I didn't expect to like this beer as much as I did, it really won me over. Short's shows you can take some robust malts and combine them with some intense hops and bitterness and get a great tasting yet well balanced beer that isn't dull in the slightest. Great job Short's, you guys continue to impress me with your awesome and unique brews and this one is no exception, I can't wait to see what other new and crazy beers you have waiting to be unveiled.","StoutHunter","Feb 12, 2013"

Smells of roasted barley and citrusy hops. Some coffee and chocolate notes in there as well. Taste has the roastiness somewhat subdued and well-balanced with the bitterness and flavoring of the hops. Finishes dry with the alcohol well-hidden. It teeters on the edge of being a stout, but not quite there. The hops are definitely in the spotlight here. The mouthfeel is moderate and lightly carbonated. Overall, I like these black barleywines. This is a style that I would like to see more. Maybe I'll brew up a batch of my own, and use this as a standard. This is a good brew!","33nickadams","Beers"
