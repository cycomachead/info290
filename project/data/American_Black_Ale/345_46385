And the grain bill offers burned caramel and milk chocolate, there's toffee and roasty notes too. The taste is much like the aroma with pine trees and caramel and chocolate. There's a huge resiny bitterness that lingers long into the finish. Silky and creamy body with a noticable hot alcohol that could be hidden a lot more.overall, this beer is pretty decent. Not really impressed though.","hoplover82","Dec 05, 2013"

4.09,3.3,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"From my tasting notes: the Yakima Glory poured a deep ruby brown with a full tan head and loads of hops on the nose. Below the hops there was a hint of sweet malt that subdued the hoppy aroma. The taste was a front load of big juicy hops that faded into a bitter burnt chocolate and sweet toasted malts. The two flavors played well with each other and brought out the shining attributes of each while not allowing the other to take over. There was loads of flavor and lots of dynamic tastes to be had. A delicious beer with plenty of flavor to spare.","brurevu","Sep 06, 2013"

However, regardless of some cosmetic issues (*ahem!*), this is a fine brew. Actually, it reminds me very much of Northern Brewer's "Black IPA" homebrew recipe that I brewed once. Big, malty middle and lots of excellent hop blending. Makes me wonder who influenced who. Long story short, I recommend this beer on its taste alone.","BeerDocT","Aug 14, 2013"

Smell is a nice mix of fruity and piney hops, and dark chocolate malts. Taste is absolutely delicious; the mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and full, with chocolate dark malts moving seamlessly into juicy fruity hops. It finishes sweet and bitter at the same time, and sticky. Awesome.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 21, 2013"

There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The nose is piney/hoppy with a slight bite from the alcohol and a touch of sweetness. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced in the beer's nose. When tasting the beer I'm a bit surprised as it lacks the roastiness I was expecting based on the beer's appearance and nose. It has a lot more resiny bitterness than I'd expected and a touch of caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is mild-medium bodied with a bit of caramel and a pronounced, residual, hoppy/bitter punch to the palate.

4.53,14.4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: I think this truly stays to the style of ABA/Black IPA as originally intended. Most beers of this style end up being IPA's that have some roasted malt thrown in. Not this one. The hops complement the malt flavors but not overpower or take center stage, which I really enjoy. This is top quality stuff and met my high expectations as I have been waiting to drink this beer for nearly a year after just missing last years release. With the high ABV, you also feel pretty good at the end of a 12oz. bottle. Well done, Victory!","Gatch","Dec 09, 2012"

Smell: lots of pine, slightly herbal, then plum skin, light caramel sweetness and toasted bread with faint char as it warms. Taste: pine with mild caramel and plum-ish sweetness upfront, then exclusively a butt-ton of pine, plus a little booze. Some citrus rind and tannin-ness in the finish. Medium+ bodied with creamy carbonation into prickly, relentless pine and booze bombardment, finishing dry with some residual sugar stickiness.

There's also a faint caramel component to the aroma. Taste is sweet up front, fading to an alcoholic flavor, and finishing with a long lasting bitterness. Sweetness reminds me of dark fruits, cherries and plums. Bitterness is very pine like and has resin like qualities to it. Medium carbonation, full bodied, with a rather thick, resiny mouthfeel to it. Overall, very interesting beer. Well done, however not necessarily a classic example stylistically. I'm definitely glad I tried it.","scvance","Oct 31, 2012"

Flavor is toasted malts, refined and soft bitterness and plenty of pine flavor. The malts are slightly spicy and a bit dry. Thin body with hi carb and a slick finish.

Decent head retention with great cling as you drink. Aromas of rich, roasted caramel balanced with wet, spicy hops. Some earthy and woody aromas blend in, also. Flavors are malty on the forward tongue, with resiny and bitter hops attaching to the mid and rear tongue once the sweet caramel and toffee lightens from its initial showing. Hops are peppery spiced, as well, and the malt backbone has some smokey and roasted qualities that highlight throughout. The aftertaste is slightly cloying sweet, but balanced well with a deep bitterness. The finish is rich and bitter, with a slight drying in the mouth. Decent brew, both tasty and unique. A little heavy to drink in quantity, but a good strong one to enjoy at leisure.","GarthDanielson","Aug 09, 2012"

Aromas of caramel, biscuit, pine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, herbal, toasted malt, and a touch of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas that are very citrus hop forward. Taste of big chocolate, pine, grapefruit, caramel, roasted malt, biscuit, herbal, orange peel, and a touch of coffee. Nice sized bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, pine, citrus, biscuit, roasted malt, and caramel on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop bitterness to roasted malt sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a very nice black IPA.

Nice spicy hops up front, with some citrus and light malts. Pleasant resiny, hoppy bitter finish. Quite a few flavor changes throughout the taste. A fairly complex, interesting hop forward ale. Apparently a renamed Yakima Twilight.","LiquidAmber","Apr 04, 2012"

The aroma is of caramel malt with a nice citrus smell. There is also an earthy nutiness to it. The taste follows suit with a caramel malt backbone up front then a nice citrus hop flavor along with a slight floral hop and a semi sweet dark fruit taste.

Poured with a dense, rocky beige foam with good staying power that also left sheets of thick sticky lacings on the glass. Complex combination of dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate malt aromas along with citrus, floral and and pine hops that intensify as this warms. Rich, smooth feel with aggressive carbonation. Dark roasted and lightly burnt malt flavors up front, floral and citrus hop bitterness from the middle thru to the end. A hint of dark chocolate flavor toward the end as the dark and burnt roasted malt flavor intensify at the finish in combination with a delayed bitter pine hop aftertaste. A multitude of aromas and flavors make this a beer to be sought out.","IronLover","Feb 04, 2012"

The smells are of pine hops, coffee, molasses and caramel. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty great, lots of spicy black pepper, some dark malts, a little more spice and it finishes with some hop bitterness and a little alcohol burn, dang good stuff.","DavidST","Dec 01, 2011"

4.35,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that leaves some decent retention and a beautiful ring of lacing around the beer. The smell is a nice combination of chocolate malts and citrus hops. The taste starts out with some hops followed by some chocolate malts and than more hops attack the palate followed by some sweet malts and the finish leaves some hops on the tongue. A very complex hoppy beer that has a nice smooth, easy to drink mouthfeel that leaves you dry and wanting more. With a beer this good all I can say is Victory Brewing is living up to its name.","DannyDan","Oct 01, 2011"
3.83,-3.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4," The taste is slightly roasted malt with piney hop backing in the swallow, there is a slight citrus edge, not quite what I would call grapefruit in the middle with the resinous element bringing out more spice with slight sweet nutty tinge from the malt with subtle dark toast and mild alcohol in the taste. There is more heat in the finish with sharpness from the hops lingering. Overall I feel this is good, but it straddles the fence between a hoppy Imperial brown and the black IPA which doesn't fit to me. There is a lot of roasted character which seems to cover some of the hops, but overall a nice American strong ale.","Slatetank","Sep 29, 2011"

4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On-tap at Ale+Witch. It pours a deep, dark mahogany-amber hue with a tawny head and sheets of lace. Not black, per se, it is more akin to a darkly-colored BW. The nose has a lot of piney and herbal dankness and is evocative of SN's premium brews' hop profile. There is also a slight vegetal and catty aroma. A piney, earthy, and woody hop profile sits upon an English-style malt (i.e. biscuity, buttery and unobtrusive) and the whole thing reminds me, again, of a top-shelf SN offering. Some tea like bitterness is observed after a while, too. The feel is fairly creamy for a beer in the IPA family; I like. Overall, a very good Black IPA / CDA / ABlkA; one of my favs of the fledgling style.","ktrillionaire","Jul 15, 2011"

It's medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a very dry finish. It tastes dry and well bittered with citrus peel and pine resin. There's a healthy dose of dark roast. The malt is sturdy and has a toffee-like quality. All of the flavors are in balance and they work well together. Great job, Victory. This beer is right up my alley.","yesyouam","Jul 12, 2011"

I won’t hesitate to treat myself to this one again. My over all impression is that this is a well made beer that works quite well as a cask offering. For me much of the difference between this one on cask and the bottled or tap versions lies basically in the mouth feel of the beer. Even though I thought the tap version to be smooth and creamy, this one tops it for creamy smoothness.","drtth","May 28, 2011"
3.38,-14.6,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Didn't quite understand this style the first time 'round, so let's see how one o' the first CDAs I've tried appears now. It pours a clear garnet-russet topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises toffee, light cocoa powder, grapefruit peel, light pine, and mint. The taste leans heavier on the hops, primarily with notes of orange peel, grapefruit rind, and pine. An undercurrent of toasted caramel flows nicely, though definitely hindered by the hops. Things clash a bit here, with balance a lost afterthought. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a decent CDA, but the flavor clash really makes this thing hard to drink with a smile.","TMoney2591","May 27, 2011"
4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: As the trend of Black IPA's has really taken hold in the US, Yakima Glory tends to get lumped in with them, though it's not at all black and not quite as roasty as it's newfound brothers. Still, a good option for the hopheads looking for something different, although...well, let's be honest, with SO MANY on the market nowadays, these dark IPA's are becoming rather commonplace.","ChainGangGuy","May 27, 2011"

3.83,-3.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Very dry, malty mouthful. It tastes like sweet yellow grapefruit but then very bitter on the back end. This beer tastes best when it is cold, because the high ABV (8.7) starts to present itself when on the warm side. In fact, I didn't even know it was that high in ABV until I looked on BA. Victory is slowly becoming one of my staple beers for cost and quality.","Seeker41184","May 08, 2011"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how well the roastiness and the flavoring hops blended together. For some reason we were expecting this one to be overwhelmingly hoppy, which could have possibly clashed with the otherwise darker aspects of the brew. When evaluating these “mixed” styles it can be easy to have one component outweigh another, but this brew sees a nice balance through to the end, with some admittedly robust flavorings.","TheBrewo","May 07, 2011"
3.8,-4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a pretty well designed beer, I laud victory for being bold in their delivery but the flavors aren't integrated well in my opinion, I'm finding that the burnt sourness on the end is overpowering any sort of hop bitterness that I should be tasting.

Wicked foamy head when poured. Smell is of hops and malt, with an earthiness. The taste is not overpowering with the hops. There's a toasted, sweet malty flavor that backs it up.

Here the dark malts add character and complexity, but in doing so detracts from the hops.","mpyle","Apr 08, 2011"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"This pours very dark purple with medium tan head. There is moderate retention and decent lacing. The smell is pungent dark fruits and hops. The flavor is robust raison and citrus hops. I like this because the complexity relies on fruit rather than spice. I'm most impressed with the amount of detectable hops and bitterness in the taste, and the lack over over-sweet syrup qualities that sometimes come with ABVs over 8%.

Balanced smell of malt and hops, with some citrus and dried fruit as well. With closed eyes, could almost mistake it for a double IPA, but the malts give it away. Hoppy, but not too bitter, and extremely well balanced. THe malts lead off, and the hops closes. I'm still working on evaluating mouthfeel in general, so unless I 'feel' something unusual, the rating will be a 4. This is a nice winter to summer transition beer. Pairs well with a good cheddar. Another good showing from Victory.","masstransplant","Mar 30, 2011"

Then again it doesn't say anything on the bottle about it being a black ale. Sure does smell like one though. Smells earthy and of citrus. A little woody. Crisp hop bite with a very complex finish. Several flavors pass through the pallet before ending. I'm getting a little coriander, almost like a belgian trippel or dark ale. The mouthfeel makes this one a bit harder to wrap my buds around. It's not violently bubbly, but it definitely keeps things from standing around. Notes of mint, tobacco (earthy). The buffet of flavors are definitely trying to gang up on the hop dominance.","100floods","Mar 22, 2011"

Finish is all juicy hops and caramel; where's the roast? I'd be scoring this significantly higher as a regular IPA, but as a CDA it falls flat.

The malt aromas are of charred chocolatey sweetness, and the hops are piney and resinous. The overall effect is that of a smore cooked on a sappy pine stick. Flavor-wise, complex hops actually dominate the front and mid-palates, before dark chocolate comes in on the finish. The taste of chocolate-covered orange peel lingers long. An intriguing beer.

Given my general dislike of brown ales, this is actually pretty good. Prominant malt from with some nutiness, a bit of bitter hops, and a visible alcohol spice. Fairly wet and medium bodied.

Taste is pretty sweet for style, cuts into impact of hops, caramel, some citrus, pretty well balanced but light on the hops. Mouthfeel is medium, pretty good effervescence.

There's enough malt balance that this doesn't come across as a super bitter beer, but the finish is dry and lingering, real nice. This contributes to the drinkability of this beer. Also, I was drinking this last weekend and now I realize why I got a little tipsy - 8.7%?? I was tossing em back, thinking it was a perfect session beer.

Smells very dank and fruity, like fresh hops, dark fruit, caramel and thick brown sugar in a glass. The nose and taste are both very sweet, very fruity and full of piney and citrus hops with a rich malty sweetness like molasses, syrup and fermented candied sugar. Not sure if it's the hops or the malt, but either way it's very sweet and potent which lets traces of the ABV come through like barrel aged booze.

What is interesting is the stylistic place from where this beer takes its inspiration. Whereas most black IPAs inherit their dark "genes" from a beer of porter or stout parentage, leading to a dominating black roast/coffee malt profile, this beer seems to have decidedly Belgian roots. Stylistically its dark qualities remind of a quad--albeit not a very refined one. With hop flavors that are mostly dark as well--nuanced, perhaps--there just isn't the expected clash that somehow ends up working in the best examples of this style. As a strong sipper this beer is not an unqualified mess, but Yakima Glory lags behind many other, worthier, examples of the style.","beagle75","Dec 30, 2010"

The herbal/earthy/citrus is there but not as prevalent and gets mixed with a bitter tea flavor. Some dark caramel, little bit of chocolate, and maybe a hint of dark fruits mixed with some warming alcohol round out the taste experience.

Whole flower resinous pine like grapefruit hops hit you right away with an amazing malt sweetness in the middle. The malts also contribute a cherry like character to it that mixes very well with the bitterness. This actually reminds me of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale but with more resinous hops.

Wow, the taste is actually very smooth for such a big beer, I can see these going down toooo easy. Big leafy hop grapefruit bite followed by some sweet malt, but not too sweet and pine finish. This beer is a bit hard to place, definitely a few shades darker than my other favorite hoppy beer Alpha King, more toastyness from the darker malts, perhaps some toffee. There is a lot going on here besides big hops...mouthfeel is quite smooth and this beer is extremely drinkable, little alcohol coming through in the taste.

It has the texture of a top-shelf gin: dry and smooth with a little grit at the finish. The perfect balance of hops and sweet malts really counterbalance each other perfectly, without muting any of their pronounced qualities. There is a little heat in the finish from the high alcohol, but the ultra dry hops disguise it masterfully. A beer I will definitely seek out this November.

A mix of very large hop base that is tied to a thick a malt base for a leafy, tea-like beer that is dry but unlike an IPA's overpowering hopiness this beer finishes muted and subtle with some sweet malts. A good beer that has a chewey feel along with a drying sensation for a beer that I didn't exactly think was so great but enjoyed drinking and would tell anyone to try once.","clayrock81","Apr 11, 2010"

The initial aroma is of bitter coffee along with dark chocolate, but maintaining a fresh hoppiness as well. The malts are very darkly roasted and smell a bit like oats. The palate begins with the same bitter notes as the aroma giving way to grapefruit, floral notes, and hops on the mid-palate, and ending again with the bitterness. The finish is reminiscent of an endive bitterness, slightly green, and slowly turning back into the familiar grapefruit flavor. This does not feel like a huge beer on the palate, but the carbonation causes a very round feel, due to larger bubbles. Overall, this is a good beer. The alcohol content is very well integrated, and the complexity is more than acceptable. I will gladly drink this beer again.","wedgie9","Mar 18, 2010"

The aroma is grapefruit, pine, with some malt underneath. It is rather underwhelming for a beer of its strength. Its real weakness is its lack of any sort of complexity. In fact, I think I would like it even less if it were stronger as its blandness would be more in my face. The taste is a mirror image of the aroma, and equally dull too. There is a noticeable bitterness in the finish, but that doesn't really improve anything. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a big disappointment. I could see how this beer might be enjoyed by the crowd who's only criteria for to be good is strength.

2.93,-26,4,3.5,3,2.5,2,"Rich and malty, I wanted more hops. It's got a picture of a hop on the bottle, for cyring-out-loud! I know it's not a DIPA, but there's a picture of a hop!! Isn't it?? It tastes like a regular strong ale, but a bit bland and new. At 8.7%, it's not really strong. With a one-year max freshness duration, it's blah. Shouldn't strong ales be ripe for cellaring? The carbonation is well-done (as I'd expect from Victory), but it's just a hop-influenced malt beer. Though I'll go with a relatively average rating, I must admit I'm disappointed. In fact, the feel is where I'll take it down a notch. Malt blahness, it's left begging for more hop influence. Kinda rich without significant backing, it feels like a miss. As for drinkability, I will not be seeking this one out again....","marvin213","Feb 14, 2010"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer is a shadowy ruby colored liquid, topped with a creamy off-white head. It's a pretty brew, but the appearance doesn't foreshadow that this is one powerful hop-bomb. The smell is all about hops....piny, resiny, citric, oily, sharp, and serious. It's like rubbing your nose in your homebrewing buddy's hop harvest. There is a little malt in the distance, but it's hard to discern a specific character behind all the hop scents. The taste is also hop-centric. It's bitterness has a no-nonsense intensity, and the resiny, tannic, slightly oily sensations are amazing. There is a little more malt in the taste....bread-crumbs and toasted crackers. The finish is long and bitter. Full body...warming. This is one adventurous beer!","Suds","Feb 13, 2010"

Also getting some notes of toffee, pineapple, scorched caramel, and peppery-fruity alcohol. Toasted malts and herbal hop bitterness up front. Bitterness becomes pinier, sappier, and gently numbing. Caramel cookie dough malt makes for some nice balance. Spicy, fruity alcohol follows, before the pinesap and resin hops take over the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. A very tasty, sappy-hoppy, American strong ale.","alexgash","Feb 12, 2010"

Flavor's dominated by the hops, but it works well with the roasty malts supporting and complimenting the hops nicely. Body is decent and so is carbonation.

Its a very interesting beer and seems to fall inbetween the style of iipa and strong ale. Interesting offering.","WeedKing4","Feb 02, 2010"
4.15,4.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark as night as the name implies with a big head of cream colored foam. Tons of lacing and great head retention. The aroma is very strong on the bitter hop notes with grapefruit and dried orange peel. These are both present in the flavor with the addition of a stronger malt characteristic. Caramel and particularly chocolate are present behind the hops. It's definitely heavy on the hops which is why it loses a point in my book. I could have used a little more balance but it's not bad. Medium body with good carbonation makes this one pretty drinkable and the hop finish is nice and super bitter. Overall it's a very good beer I think. I can see some people being put off by it's blend of massive hops and chocolaty flavors--in fact I don't really love this one personally--but I think it's very well made and definitely worth trying.","apbarwood","Feb 02, 2010"

First thing I notice from the flavor is that the hops are not as big as I thought based on the aroma, or at least give a different flavor than I was expecting ... still pretty big. Malt flavor seems to be a bit hard to pinpoint but give a caramel feel. Slight alcohol flavor is there but well hidden.

A continuation of balance in the flavor, a dark and bitter creation showcasing the resiny pine and grapefruit pucker of the hops as well as a rich and dark caramel malt base. The hops coat everything in the end, and I like that. It's fairly thick and a good blast of flavor, but I'm craving another so it's not too much to handle at all.

Lingering oil like hop bitterness is left in the mouth. Yeast and warming alcohol notes play quite a part in the flavor as well. It is a medium feel beer with mild carbination.

I can't quite put my finger on what I am tasting but it is tasting very interesting and quite good.

Way too easy to drink...8.7% ABV is well integrated. A lot to consider...sooo not your average fizzy yellow brethren.","jjayjaye","Jan 10, 2010"

There's a slight charcoal dryness which is bathed in this creamy malted hop milk shake goody. It's very smooth yet keeps a steady tingling carbonation throughout. I pick up a near licorice quaity that adds some complexity. This is on the edge of being full bodied but is undoubtedly one Hell of a good beer.

The hop flavor is intense, like I tore open a bag of hop pellets and started gnawing down on them. Plenty of bitterness, some astringency too. These black IPAs sure are trendy.

3.21,-18.9,5,4,3,3.5,2,"Pours a brownish color, maybe a deep red, with bright ruby highlights. The beer is crystal clear, and the head pours to be enormous, I was barely able to fit a 12 oz bottle into a 20oz glass because of the head. The bubbles are clingy, but still a little loose, and they are quite cavernous as the head starts to fall back. Really, a brilliant looking beer. Smells like citrusy hops, with some grapefruit and orange notes, but with more sweetness and less rindy smells than an IPA, but similar hop profile. There's a nutty, raisiny note in the background, with a hint of caramel/cola. Nice balance, overall, good smells. The bitterness really comes through in the flavor, resinous bitterness. Really polleny and leafy, which I kind of expected - but it's not quite what I was wanting to taste. Raisins and toffee come through in the taste, with some esters, and a hint of peachy alcohol. It comes across as a sharp, almost astringent, tea. I'm somewhat interested in the taste, but it just isn't doing it for me overall. The carbonation is moderate, not sharp, there's no sting, but it's present. The body is kind of medium, maybe thinned out by the alcohol. Still, I could be happy with this. But the drinkability is not incredible. I think the alcohol is a little too much at this point, though I would guess that the somewhat interesting hoppiness would fade as well as the peachy alcohol faded.

Clear brownish amber color, very consistent until a slight fade to orange at the rims, transparent with a flurry of bubbles visible within. Extremely hoppy nose of grains, unprocessed wheat and meadow grasses, not much citrus or pine, any softness comes from molasses brittle, cocoa powder and a touch of apricot, peach, pear fruit, this as much pit and skin as pulp. Medium-bodied, the carbonation very strong and churns inside your mouth like a commercial grade fan. Borderline bitter, here you get mandarin orange and white grapefruit through the attack, some pine and lots of herbaceousness and cereal grains. At the same time, the molasses, honey and caramel recede in the face of the relentless hoppiness. By the finish a pepperiness comes through and, at times, it feels hot. For all of this, it doesn't seem unbalanced per se, more so an expression of a tightly focused concept. If you're down with the message, impressive.","farrago","Dec 22, 2009"

Flavor starts out bitter, plenty of pine flavors coming through, backed up with a decent amount of caramel malt, and light chocolate in there somewhere. Definitely a big, hoppy brew, but would have liked to have seen just a touch more balance. They must have used and an enormous amouont of hops in this thing, because the mouthfeel is nearly full-bodied, slick and coating. With this body, I would expect more malt to be at play, but the bitter, citrus hops outweigh all else. Nice beer to be sure.

Poured with a vigorous, creamy and cascading, 4 inch, tan-colored head (almost looks like a nitro pour) - excellent retention. Appearance was just shy of mahogany and semi-translucent. Some, textured fluffs of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals citrusy hops and perhaps a light, roasted quality. Taste follows nose; however, there is clearly some dark malt action and some piny bitterness that comes out in the mix - interesting complexity and character that changes slightly as the brew warms. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive background carbonation (not prickly), and a touch of oiliness on the tongue. This is a really interesting beer. Had the opportunity to try this one at Beervana Providence, and I was really impressed. Abv is well-hidden at 8.9%. Even though American Strong is a catch-all style, I would say that this is closer to a DIPA/Strong hyrbid.

The beer is quite full bodied, full palated, with lots of piney, orangey, estery, and grapefruit hop. The hop is spot on in that there is a nice balance between tanginess, bittering qualities, orange and fruit burst, and tight drying qualities. There is a malty base underneath, with some charring notes that play off well with the bittering hop qualities. There is some crystal malts going on in the beer, some bready qualities, but some of that gets lost in the ABV. This is more of a sipping beer. There is a bit of ABV throatiness to the beer. It is very good. L'Chaim.","albern","Dec 13, 2009"

Appears a deep rustic caramel amber not quite a black IPA but deep crimson red for sure, a nice thicket of head forms with khaki tan pigments cookin'. Head is dwindling nicely with speckled sporadic lacing. Aromatics offer up a minty, citrus, and piney, earthy mix of hops absolutely amazing with the dark malts. This really blends well some cocoa and dark chocolate edges with those hops and a touch of hidden alcohol come through. Flavors bring pure hoppiness about on the palate, strong lingering bitterness almost a perfume like herbal quality, strong astringent black tea, citrus mint and pine tip accented hops. Mild cocoa, and watered down astringent coffee accents actually blend nicely with an air of brown sugar added to the malt combination. Mouthfeel is slightly oily with ample carbonation medium to bigger bodied a touch of heat from the well hidden alcohol. Drinkability I love this brew, I can't help but appreciate the effort to do something more extreme from their pretty traditional lineup, I dug the first year of the Hop Wallop after that the beer's initial premise has been lost this is what Victory needed to keep us hopheads praising.","WVbeergeek","Dec 12, 2009"

Taste is much hoppier than I was expecting. Really earthy, well rounded hops mix with the dark malt really well. Extremely well balanced as well, everything plays well together. It does not come off hot at any point in spite of a pretty high ABV. Black IPAs seem like a sort of trendy new style, but if this one were to fall within that category, it would be a standout.

It's damn hoppy which is good for me, but the balance is lost and the malt backbone is really playing second fiddle to the hops. It's goes down easy with a powerful citrus hop blast all the way through to the finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation.

Odd thing to pick up, probably most people would say it smells of compost. The flavor is very hoppy and bitter. I think this beer was once listed as a DIPA, and that is what it tastes like to me. All hops. Hints of citrus and hay with a little earthiness. Alcohol is well hidden and not detectable. Has a large body and nice carbonation. Enough body to carry the bitterness.

Overall this beer had a good clean flavor with nice hops and malt, but it seemed to suffer from an identity crisis. Is it a double IPA? A black IPA? Something in between? The tropical hops seemed great for the summer, and the roasty malts seemed great for the fall or winter. Together they were confusing.

A toasted bready malt supports the big bitter hop profile. There are some hints of chocolate in the malt as well. The brew has a moderate body with fairly soft carbonation that leads to a silky feel; finishes with quite a bitter asprin blast which is a little rough for my liking.

It's a very dark double IPA...a dark brown with amber hues. Thick frothy head that never fully goes away. Lots of lacing on the glass. Interesting that there is a fair amount of sediment floating around. The sediment isn't moving, either...it's just sort of suspended there. Honestly, I wasn't sure what style this was (IPA vs DIPA), but I knew with the first whiff. Big hop presence in the nose. Kind of sweet, too (caramel?). A hint of citrus. The taste follows the nose. Lots of bitter hops. The bitterness certainly lingers. I'd prefer if the bitterness was toned down just a bit. The citrus in the mouth is more noticeable than in the nose. The grapefruit also has me chomping my teeth. It's got a pretty heavy mouthfeel for a DIPA. Leaves lots of stick. It's definitely a sipper.

All of the pleasant dry bitter hops are half cut down halfway through. This beer started off amazing but like most IPAs from around here the malt backbon balances things out a bit too much for me.

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA pint glass. It pours a deep caramel color with a mamoth, sticky white head. The aroma is sweetened pine potpouri, IMO a good thing. The beer is sweet pine and citrus, it has a ridiculous malty body to go with the huge amount of hops. The 9% abv is well hidden. The brew is full bodied and has a sticky mouthfeel. It is very easy to drink this down, a real winner.","bonkers","Nov 17, 2009"

3.96,0,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D- Deceptively drinkable for a nearly 9% beer. The oiliness of the hop finish definitely slows one down a little, but not hard to drink at all. A very interesting beer.","mbudner","Nov 16, 2009"
4.16,5.1,3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Very flowery pungent aroma, almost lush like a greenhouse. Very hoppy Pours a medium dark brown with a thin white head that's gone quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Very floral hoppiness up front. Some malt bitterness in the back. Lots of anise on the finish that becomes more pronounced the more you drink. Very nice palette, like a DFH 90. Great beer, I like this very much. Great cost/ABV ratio too.","cynicgiraffe","Nov 15, 2009"
4.28,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D: As far as DIPAs go, thi one is very drinkable - the bitterness and alcohol are not at all overwhelming. Way to go Victory :)","Tromba","Nov 15, 2009"
3.45,-12.9,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"The palate isn't half as good, though. This is an explosion of pine up front, with nowhere near as much malt complexity as I got on the nose. Some dark caramel is apparent, but the pine bitterness is quite overpowering, along with grapefruit pith. The pine resin really takes over the finish, leaving a mildly astringent character. A rye-like spiciness is noticeable mid-palate. Whiffs of alcohol are also present. Medium in body with medium carbonation, the palate is OK, but the excessively bitter character of the finish really makes this difficult to appreciate, and enjoy in large amounts. An interesting beer, nonetheless","DefenCorps","Nov 14, 2009"
3.59,-9.3,4.5,3,4,3,3.5,"D: The flavors don't work well together for me here but its still very drinkable and rather complex for an IPA though not as malty as I would like for an imperial.","SpeedwayJim","Nov 13, 2009"
4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"very interesting... dark brown, almost ruby, with a big tan head that holds and nice, webby lace. milk chocolate, cooked caramel, tons of piney, fruity hop all come together to create an almost jammy scent. it's not stout meets wcipa, it's like scwharz vs dipa. taste is hop all the way, and the malty backbone is filled with goodness carrying it all. a touch out of balance for someone who isn't a total hop head. super long, dry, bitter finish. for me, it would be hard to have more than one of these in a row without some food to tone it down a bit, but also think it could really work with cheese or carrot cake or a ton of ther things. fantastic effort from victory.","timtim","Nov 13, 2009"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep ruby, nearly brown ale color, with a fluffy tan head. Piney, earthy, biscuity, and sweet aromas dominate. The flavor starts with a big chunk of sweet malts, and fades into the piney, abrasive ipa hops we all know and love. It has a full and chewy mouthfeel, and the finish is a clinging strong bitterness combined with the hefty malt presence. This is a big beer, but it's not overly sweet, and is quite drinkable. Much darker and a touch roastier than I'd expect from a DIPA, but delicious and well made. I'm curious what a few months of aging would do to this beer. It seems like it could do very well in the cellar.","Finn","Nov 09, 2009"

4.25,7.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a ruby brown color that shines brightly in the light, a strong sticky tan head rests atop the brew. Grapefruit and pine resiny fresh hop aroma in the nose, YT shows its great balance right from the get go. Obviously hop dominated a rich, caramel/chocolate malt body lay beneath. Medium bodied, great carbonation, dangerously drinkable. Victory has got itself a winner here.","ATPete","Nov 08, 2009"
4.18,5.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Moderately sweet up front. Lots of malt character, high bitterness in the back, pine based bitterness. Finishes nicely without an aftertaste.

2.91,-26.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"D - The bitterness is just too unbalanced, with the sweet malts imparting a twangy flavor that just isn't appealing to me. Will not seek out another.","FickleBeast","Nov 07, 2009"
3.96,0,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Should be labeled as a winter warmer because I will surely be seeking this out as the snow drops. Nicely combines two massive worlds of beer being hops and malt in such a way that its chaotic chemistry is awarded. I am not a huge fan of comparing beers but really reminds me some of the Indian brown ale from DFH in that it is a hybrid of two very different styles that is finely tuned.","craftaholic","Nov 06, 2009"
3.55,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - One bottle is fine, but I don't think I'd want another right after. I haven't had any terribly drinkable DIPAs, so I won't knock it too much for that.","HitokiriNate85","Nov 06, 2009"

4.15,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"The mouthfeel is excellent as the first sips really prime the taste buds, not destroy them with a single flavor profile. This is a nice drinkable session beer, but it did cloy during my second 10oz pour.","garcia2a","Nov 03, 2009"
4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall drinkability is good for an 8.7% abv. This will make a great "winter warmer" for me. A very nice sipper. Not the hop bomb that i look for in my DIPA's but a pleasantly different take on the style.","BigMike","Nov 02, 2009"

Smells of floral hops, pine resin, chocolate, dark fruits, and rye bread. Tastes of pine, chocolate, roasted malt, rye, caramel, raisins, and a combination of citrus, mint, and earthy hops with a nice warmth of alcohol to finish. Medium-fullish in body, though a little watery with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a good hop bite right from the start, but also a nice balance with the rye and roasted malt. Kind of hard to distinguish what style this beer is, definitely middle ground between a double IPA and a barleywine with even some candidacy for Black IPA. A good brew but hard to classify and therefore hard to determine when I would want to drink it.","HopDerek","Dec 17, 2008"

Tastes of pine, roasted malts, earthy, citrus, and lighter caramel. Alcohol content well hidden. Lacing left on the glass. More on the hoppy side vs. a balanced IIPA.
