Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, subtle resinous notes, licorice, some tropical fruit sweetness, and some pine notes. The chocolate and roast characters come up the most in the nose. Flavors are heavily roasted, and yet incredibly smooth. Chocolate and caramel blend on the forward tongue, with a rich, creamy backbone, some bitter and piney notes in the background, and a roasted, almost smoky highlight. Very well blended and balanced. The body is light and smooth, with a roasted, rich, and slightly bitter aftertaste. The finish has a bitter linger, both chocolate and hoppy. This is a solid, heavy, very tasty brew. Worth searching out.","GarthDanielson","Feb 25, 2014"

This offering pours a very deep black color with two fingers of tan head that gives way to a handsome light brown film and a significant amount of lacing. The nose on this one is light and unremarkable but carries notes of chocolate, coffee, lots of roasted malts and a little bit of hops. Honestly for a black ipa, I'd of expected more hops here. It seems closer to a porter than a black ipa. The flavor is rich and deep. Lots of coffee and chocolate notes with a very nice roasted malt presence and a touch of hoppy bitterness. This is a very well crafted ale. Possibly mislabeled, but very good and very drinkable. I look forward to my next beer from this brewer.","lochef81","Jan 29, 2014"

3.54,-7.3,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 9/23/2011 bottle code on the bottom. Pours pitch black color with a dense 2 finger tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big apple skin, roasted malt, chocolate, biscuit, and toast. Aromas are very off balanced, way too much apple aromas. Something went wrong here. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, char, coffee, herbal, pine, and earthy spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, char, pine, and herbal spiciness for a good bit. Nice balance of roasted flavors with hop bitterness; with a very robust amount of roasted flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9.5%; with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a nice black IPA that is quite robust with roasted flavors. Other than the obvious fermentation flaws in aromas with this particular bottle, it was still quite enjoyable. I will have to revisit this again and hope I get a better bottle.","superspak","Jun 09, 2012"

3.99,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"D-Not bad as it has the looks and smell of a hopped up west coast ale (which I enjoy) but is a bit more mellow without slacking on the flavor and subtlety. A pleasant drink.","mjgarrett2","Dec 07, 2009"
3.82,0,2.5,3,4.5,3.5,4,"I can see sediment though the bottle, even before I pour, it seems to be really loose, but I'm not too afraid of it. Pours nice and dark, though I almost expected it to be blacker. The head is kind of thin, not exiting, looks like an average kind of brown ale. The smell immediately makes me think something is burnt, not quite like ashes, but burnt. Then comes this overpowering caramellized sugar smell. The hops are not too present, some slightly herbal and leafy smells, but it seems kind of normal for a ""black ipa"". The taste is actually quite an improvement. There's a great roasty flavor layered with a nice hop bitterness. Those two flavors create a pleasant bitterness, balanced with a nice malty, caramelly sweetness. The hop flavor comes through with some astringent lemon peel and grapefruit rind, and finish a bit piney and fruity, like an underripe mango. Still the dark malts are present throughout. The only off flavor I notice is a slightly yeasty flavor, maybe some hot yeast flavors, kind of pasty, but not too noticable. The body is pretty nice, though a little more thin than I expected. Can't really compain, but nothing to be exited about. The drinkability is rather good - I enjoyed the beer quite a bit, but eventually started to fade into the background. I don't know if that makes it more or less drinkable, but overall, this is a pretty good beer.","taylorhamrick","Dec 02, 2009"
4.1,7.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Had the chance to try this at a recent tasting in Columbia, thanks to RJ Rockers for sending us such a nice gift. I can't remember ever trying a Black IPA. My initial thoughts were that it smelled and looked like a hopped up porter. The taste of the malty sweetness, coffee, and hops really seemed to work well together. Very unique, I would definitely recommend trying it and look forward to the Dark Side series coming to Columbia.","bobby8405","Dec 02, 2009"
4.52,18.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"My first Rockers review in a while after trying this on tap at The Tap Room beside the brewery. Poured into a pint glass, this one was an almost-black brown color and had a 1/2 inch tan head. The smell is a roasted-coffe-hoppy trio and quite nice. I was really surprised that this beer wasn't over-the-top hoppy in terms of taste. The sweetness of the malt really balances out this beer making it a fairly easy drinking beer. It is quite filling and I wasn't able to drink more than a pint of this, but it was a very tasty beer and I hope they brew it again next year!","southernbelle09","Nov 29, 2009"
4.48,17.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Served in a 22 oz bottle with blue wax sealing. A really cool looking bottle. Pours a thick, dark color with big, sticky tan/off-white head. Smells of malt, mild hops, and alcohol. With this being an imperial IPA I expected a stronger hop aroma. This is a full flavored beer with the sweetness of the malt dominating on the front end while the finish is predominatly a roasted, hoppy combo. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, it leaves a layer inside your mouth. Drinkability is the best thing about this beer. For such a big beer, it is an easy drink and one you have to be carful with. Outstanding!","woodjm","Nov 29, 2009"
