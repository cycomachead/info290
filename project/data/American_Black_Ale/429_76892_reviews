"Overall- An enjoyable Black IPA by Alaskan. There was a good amount of roasted malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good dark ale overall with a decent use of hops all around. There is a slight cola-like quality towards the finish, but the malt grain richness and hop bitterness win out overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"While most black IPAs come down on the side of light, this one comes down on the side of dark, and sort of comes off like a hoppy porter or stout. A different take on it, but a tasty one, I thought."
""
"O - Fairly pleasant beer and very easy drinking. Pretty complex also. I could see myself session this one. Especially at $6.99 for a 6 pack."
""
""

"From the bottle and into the double-walled Bodum glass it poured an almost-black dark brown, which looked deep red when held up to the light. It created nearly an inch of frothy tan head which left remarkable lacing as it went down the glass. The aroma of this beer is quite enjoyable: dark chocolate, raisins, caramel, pine, and moss all come through very well. The bitterness of the hops, however, is somewhat overwhelming in the taste. Behind the earthy, pine-y notes of the hops, there is a bit of vanilla and the impression that some of the complexity of the aroma is also in the taste. It's just a bit overpowered. I thought the beer had good carbonation and had a pleasant body but nevertheless felt a touch light on my tongue. Overall, I expected a bit more but I enjoyed every bottle in the pack. I will be trying other black IPAs, for sure, but I'll think twice about buying this one again unless there are no other options."
""
"Alaskan Black IPA is certainly a tasty beer and it rates a notch better than other black IPA I have tried. It is less balanced than others, with a greater reliance on the hops, but that fact should not dissuade anyone from sampling it, as its taste is still very good and memorable. The complexity and other factors make this ale one for the record and one everyone should add to their list of beers to try."
""
""
""
""
"O – Wow. I've had this one fresh, and it is great then, as a big hoppy dark ale. But now, once the hops have faded, the malt complexities are great. The sweet dark cherry and chocolate notes, to contrast the bright bitter coffee and light hop notes, are just great. This is truly underrated."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 5/4/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, char, light coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon zest, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; solid strength and very pleasant. Taste of dark chocolate, char, light coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, lemon zest, grass, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, char, citrus zest, floral, pine, and grass on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice black IPA. Nice complexity and good balance of hop/malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""

"Taste is big on the hop flavor and surprisingly low on bitterness, for me sometimes the roasty char and hop bitterness can be a bit much, but this one has a nice mellow bitterness. The malts actually have a touch of chocolate that is nice. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but it seems to work in the beer's favor for some reason. This Black IPA might be more simplistic than many of the style, but I find it to be quite enjoyable and manages something rarely accomplished for those of the Cascadian persuasion...it's refreshing! Id buy this again, yizeah."

"I would have this again."
""
"a nice offering from this brewery.. not sure if this is my first from them or not, but i've been meaning to try this one for a while. really do like it, but it's hard to distinguish from a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Bold smell doesn't quite translate to taste, still quite a good beer with easy session-ability"
""
"An enjoyable Black IPA, though overall it doesn't stand out for the style in any particular way."
""
""
""
"This is a very delicious well rounded brew. A session ipa. I like the darker malt quality of it."

"OK...dark amber head remains...slight aroma of dark roasted malts. Big carbonation remains, almost in the way of the dark roasted malts. I'll admit I like many black IPAs, like Hop Strike from Tommyknocker or Stones black IPA, and this one is darn tasty. Rich roasted malts, slight sweetness, robust hops in a nice balance. Like a export stout with extra west coast hops, like a burnt porter gone hoppy, like a beer I want to bring to my mouth again and again. In my mind a brilliant balance, not a giant in abv, which is fine, but big in flavor and richness. Heck, a good competitor with my current regular house brand, Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA...humm... I think I could say I like this more."
""
""
""
"Overall an OK Black IPA."
""
""
"On the spectrum this isn’t quite a red ale nor is it a hoppy porter, but it has aspects I like from both of the styles—some piney, dank notes; a light roast; malt that’s not overly sweet—which work for me. A mixed bag, to be sure, but one I’d grab again."
""
""
"O- the first black IPA i fell in love with. This is a 12-pack purchase once a season for sure. It's body and hop flavor are balanced and the pushed over with the hops and it's a great example of what this style shall develop into. Cheers to the alaskan brewery on this one."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer from these guys. Not their best in my opinion, but certainly one worth trying."
""
"It's a nice brew, I'm glad I took the chance on a sixer. I've had other Alaskan brews before tho and it's a good brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer, but would like a little roasted barley presence. For those that like a good hop character but have grown bored with obnoxiously hopped beers (""oh wow how original"") might give this one a shake."
"I would buy this again, especially since they are $6.99 a sixer. I usually buy just TX stuff, but there aren't really black IPAs available in bottles/cans at this time. Bottle was dated good until late April."
""
""
"O- Overall, I think this is a well done black ipa. I closed my eyes and took a drink and it really does taste like a pale ipa, yet it's black. This is how a black ipa ought to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A worthy and flavorful BIPA."
"Overall - A very underrated CDA from Alaskan here. Personally I'd like to see a bit more of the roasted character, but this is a fine example of the style, regardless. My only gripe is that this isn't a year-round release."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep black color with a nice looking mocha colored head on top. The head had a decent retention to it as well as a light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer had a really nice blend of roasted chocolate malt with piney hops on the nose. The taste was nicely balanced between the roasted notes as well as the hops that were used. The mouthfeel was a little thin but still kept me interested. Overall it's actually a pretty nice brew. I could see myself drinking it again."
""
""
""
""
"I’d say this was more of your average Black IPA, but I would have it again. That could be because I seem to love Black IPA’s, but still. Much better for me than the regular Alaskan IPA."
""
""
""
"Very dark brown in color, nearly black, with a light tan head. Nose is a bit sweet with licorice, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and very light hoppiness. There’s some caramel and molasses in there, maybe a bit of an earthy hop note. The flavor is quite sweet with lots of molasses and toffee. Decently roasty with a light hop bitterness on the finish as well as some chocolate. Not a huge fan of this kind of Black IPA."

"Overall this is a pretty good brew. Had it on tap at Old Chicago back in March and it was much better fresh. We'll see if Alaskan comes out with this in the future...if they do grab it fresh if you can!"
"Overall, I am quite happy. Wish I could find this one here in MI. Definitely a beer that I would have no problem spending the money on. Quite happily surprised. Would recommend."
""
""
""
"I had this once on tap, and found it very stout-like. Now that I have formally reviewed a bottle of it, I still agree with that assessment. This is a very tasty beer if you like stouts, porters, or beers with hops and lots of roasted dark malts. I would happily drink this again, especially at this price."
""
"I like this. It's beer and you can drink it."
""
"O - This is a very good dark ale. The appearance is stunning, the smell inviting, the taste delightful and well-balanced, and the mouthfeel smooth and pleasant despite having more of a bite than I would like."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Solid and easy drinking black ipa. Nice balance of roast and hops."
""
""
"Very good beer. Served at a good temperature with a nice sized, light tan, foamy, frothy head that settled slowly and loads of lace. Color is a very dark, clear mahoganey. Aroma is malt, roast, hop. Flavor is surpisingly mild yet fairly good balance and similar to nose with the usual hop, malt, tart characteristics standing out - in context with the body, which is full and has slight high points from the acid/bitter rounded peaks. Finish is like flavor, of average length and is easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall good but not sure how this fits into the profile of a black IPA. I do like it and would have it again."
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer, but not for me. Too much malts and hops going on at the same time."
""
"One finger creamy light tan head, slow dissipation with significant lacing over dark brown with red highlights opaque body. Citrusy hops dominate nose, roast malt not very noticeable until the beer fully warmed. Taste features good dose of coffeeish roast, citrus hops with a bit of floral overtones, certainly more roast than hops. Smooth medium mouthfeel, creamy, decent effervescence. Not quite hoppy enough for me, but one of the smoother CDAs I've had, worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"- A solid CDA/Black IPA. I think the taste is great, and even the look... but there is just something a little too thick about it that makes it hard to drink. I would love to be able to guzzle a few pints of a good CDA on occasion, but with this puppy, I may switch to another light drinker."
"As for the Alaskan version of this IPA-and-dark-beer-lover's treat, it gets a B. Where it has two great distinct flavors that mix well together, it lacks complexity beyond that. It's deepest flavor disappears all too quickly, leaving nothing but the hops to rest on the tounge."
""
""
""
"I’ve had a few black IPAs now, and I’m still convinced they’re a gimmick style. Alaskan Black IPA is a nice IPA that just happens to be black instead of yellow/orange. I’m not knocking the beer (it’s good), just the “style.”"
"Took me a while to find the description on the Alaskan website under spring release (that I drank in January). Alaskan emphasizes the high hops and citrus, though my draft was understated compared to the touting. However, my experience was significantly better than the reviews on BeerAdvocate. While there are those who reflect my high praise, we are in the minority. Maybe I need to try it again to confirm or deny my first draft."
""
"O: I remember it being much better out of the bottle. I pulled the glass straight out of the dishwasher, which is a rookie move, so I'm thinking that affected the taste. This is a good beer, just not good enough to buy another six pack to prove my theory incorrect. I'd try it again on draft, though."
"I always enjoy hitting the West Coast, since I almost always find something from Alaskan that I haven't tried yet. Very dark brown, but still clear with a deep ruby hue. A short cap of tan/brown bubbles capped the beer -- fair retention, quite sticky. This one's more roasty than hoppy, though there's some grassy character in the aroma. It smells kind of sweet though, a bit of cocoa and licorice. Same in the flavour, but with some pine mixing in with the licorice and sweetness. Bitterness was moderate -- a little less pronounced than I expected. Smooth, lowish carbonation, medium body, nice texture. It's quite drinkable, but maybe at the expense of blowing my socks off with ""character"". All kidding aside, it's an enjoyable beer."
""
"overall...those wanting something big, bodacious and obnoxious will be disappointed. what we have here is a sublimely balanced and delicately layered version of this hard to define style. i've had a hard time with this style, but i find this offering as something i wish i could have sampled earlier, because it's seemingly a solid base model for others to build and expand on. definitley recommended."
"O: It's a decent beer. Black IPA's, IMO, are hard to pull off. This sort of works. Easy drinking."
"O) Decent black IPA. Glad I got the chance to try it, but probably won't revisit. NG Black Top has perhaps spoiled me a bit."
""
"Pours a deep coffee hue with bits of burgundy. Finger of mocha head and very average lacing. On the nose I get some nuts, subtle chocolate, toasted grains, hops are pretty understated. The hops take on a stronger character on the tongue but lack direction - they fade into abstract bitterness before taking on much shape. The dark malts are nice though. I could be fooled into thinking that there’s a bit of coffee in this one. A decent brew."
"Poured cola brown with a nice cap of tan foam that laced up decently. Smell is pleasantly roasty, citric and a bit of pine resin. Taste is acerbic bitterness in a background of roasted malt. Once the initial hit of hop fades, the malt portion of the brew is quite nice and roasty with hints of coffee however the hop profile is a little discordant, especially on the first few sips. Mouthfeel is decently slick, medium bodied. The pith bitterness shows up again during the finish. Overall this one improves marginally About half way through the glass once the buds get accustomed ie desensitized to the hop profile."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some pine and herbal hops. Taste is of the pine/herbal hops up front with the dark roasted malt flavor coming through on the finish. There is also a slight metallic flavor that comes out as the beer warms. There is a medium roasty and hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation but the body is somewhat thin. Overall, this is a pretty good black IPA but it smells better than it tastes."
"I've had better Black IPAs with more complexity of flavor than this, but than again I've also had Black IPAs that were much worse than this. YMMV, as always."

"Mouthfeel-- Bitterness stays with you, too long for my taste."
""
""

"Overall: The person who referred this particular beer to me hyped it a lot so I went into it with heightened expectations. I must say that it lived up to his praise and I have found a solid black IPA to add to my library. Definitely worth the shade under $10 price tag for a 6-pack we paid at a local speciality beer store."
"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, and somewhat interesting, but not terribly intriguing."
""
""
"Overall, a decent Black IPA. Kind of reserved, but balanced."
"Part of gift six pack from Presario and a recent trip to Montana. Much like their regular IPA is not a assertive beer but like all Alaskan products is well made. Doesn't taste that much different than a stout and a little disappointing but easily could revisit this."
""
"Other comments: This is a beautiful Black IPA (or as I prefer to call them, Cascadian Dark Ale). Could drink a lot of these."
""
""
""
"Just a good first experience with a beer I have never had. It did not have any metallic or harsh notes that I was concerned about."
"I bought the sixer that Freddy's had but it turned out there was only 4 of these black ipa's in there. In pouring the CDA in the glass it was pitch black with a nice 2-3 finger head. The smell was citrusy and it had a solid bitterness to mouth. The Alpha's left on tongue lingered for a while. Not a bad example of the style and it has been a few months since I had one. Usually this is a summer beer for me."
"From the 12 oz twist-cap bottle."
""
"Cost: $6.00 for a 10 oz pour."
"I'm a big fan of Alaskan's IPA as a standard and cheap IPA, so when I noticed they had a Black IPA I had to give it a shot. It's an interesting mix. I've enjoyed many new black lagers lately and this is just the same...it's like a cross between a porter and an IPA, and I find it a tasty, very drinkable concoction. If you're a fan of either style, I definitely recommend!"
""
"Over all a very drinkable brew from Alaskan, and much much better than their regular IPA."
""
""
"Overall a nice beer, and a pretty good representation of the style, worth trying."
"Overall: Not really sure this should be called a Black IPA or even a catch-all American Black Ale. This is really a Porter with higher bitterness and some mild American-style hops. I enjoy it, but a little misleading."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. It's full of flavor and the hop characteristics come off very fresh. I think I would like a little less carbonation but that's about all I can complain about. If your a hop head, give this one a try! Cheers."
"o: A affordable alternative to Stone's black ipa offering, perfect."
""
"This is a pretty good brew that, I think, brings more to the table than Alaskan's regular IPA. Best by date of May 17, 2012."
"Herbal pine and spruce greenery mesh into soft, mellow roastiness of dark unsweetened chocolate and dark roast coffee. Medium bodied and fairly smooth. Lingering resinous hop bitterness that keeps interest nicely. A Black IPA i'd buy again, which is a fairly rare thing."
"O: Real easy to drink, leans more toward the roasted malt side but there is certainly a hops presense. overall a nice beer."
"12 oz single from Roth’s Vista Market. S.Salem. $1.75 Mahogany coloured beer with a small wispy tan head.Degenerates into lace within seconds. Almost no aroma..what there is is dusty chocolate malts vestiges of herbal hop Taste is also very weak..like a watered down porter..again just vestiges of any sort of hop. I guess its OK on the palate..just weak Overall one of the WORST CDAs i have had..come on Alaskan you can do much much better!!"
"O- lacks complexity and could use more roast and chocolate malts. Also hops could come through a bit more."
""
"O - A tasty black IPA, easily drinkable and nicely balanced. Certainly worthy and a good example of the style. Nicely hopped with a solid roasted malty backbone."
"Overall: tasty, but this beer needs some refinement in my opinion. It's just a bit messy, which limits how much of it I want to drink."
""
"I was excited to try this as I enjoyed the Black IPA from their Pilot Series last year. The beer is a nice black with red hues and a nice tan foam presence. Smells like a sweet porter mixed with grassy and resiny hops, maybe the slightest hint of peppery notes. The flavor follows through with a nice and complimentary style of east meets west kinda fusion. I dig the flavor profile in that neither the malts nor the hops dominate this one - it's well balanced in a classy and appropriate fashion. The mouthfeel is relatively full with some fine and soft carbonation. I like the beer, I like many of AK's beers and I'm happy to have this in the spring lineup. I'd drink this all night - easy and smooth."
""
""
"Very good beer. Incredibly drinkable. This is a cascadian dark ale that leans more toward the malty side of the equation with just enough hops to leave me completely unwanting. a delicious sweet treat."
"D - It's definitely an inspired beer, melding two styles. It suffers a bit from simplicity, but it's high quality and highly drinkable."
"I picked up a twelve pack of this beer for $12.49, very decent price. Dark black color, good tan head with a lot of lace on the glass. Smells a little grassy and a lot like a porter. The taste is cool, grassy hops and then a porter-like backbone. I find a lot of beers in this style have a huge clash between the hops and the malts, not the case here. This is very easy to drink and a nice beer. I would say it seems more like a hoppy porter but I will buy this again especially if I can get a good deal on a twelve pack again."
""
""
"Where were the hops? There's no way this passes at an ipa glad it is not catergorized as such. Interesting melody in the aroma but not much hop backing, very roasty but malt heavy and thin. Not bad but not memorable either."
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly thick. Overall, not too bad."
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a nice beer."
"Picked up a sixer of this the other day... pours a cola dark brown colour with a big three finger head... nice little hoppy aroma with mixed with malty roast. has almost a rootbeer/bubblegum taste to it.. slight roasty balance at the end. overall a nice black ipa I will be sure too try more of this style in the future."
""
"Not bad, Alaskan, though I liked your Pilot Series version of this beer much more. Drinkable and cheap, but not too memorable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep red-brown color with a 1"" tan head. Head leaves some lacing as it recedes to a thick film. Smell is roasty and citric. Tastes strongly of roasted malt, with citric and pine flavors coming in at the beginning and leaving a bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is medium-light with average carbonation. This is a good CDA, but I feel there are others that drink better."
"Enjoyable beer. Nothing to complain about here."
"Overall: A good tasting IPA. Could of been a little stronger with the dark roasty elements, but whats there tastes good."
""
""
"O: A well intentioned effort, but it's just middle of the road at best. At least it wasn't a new Black IPA that was priced through the roof which was refreshing."
"Poured from bottle, undated, to pint glass. The beer is a very solid black/brown color with a creamy 1 finger tan head with pleasant retention and lacing. The nose presents a good mix of citrusy hops and chocolately malt character. Hop forward but not over the top, quite nice. The flavor consists of very much the same powdery cocoa with mild bitterness and a good amount of citrus hop character. Mild toasty malt presence. Well balanced. Medium bodied with a mouthfeel of soft creaminess. Finishes with a slight chalky texture but is relatively smooth. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer, excellent representation of the style. Look forward to the next!"
"O - Falls short of a black IPA, let alone a regular IPA for sure. Maybe I'm spoiled by more expensive beers, but this one just didn't do it for me."
"Overall, I'm not that well versed on Black Ales, even less so with Black IPAs. From what I have had, though, this seems to be a very accessible representation of the style, which I have come to expect from Alaskan Brewing. As an early-spring seasonal, when its still really winter, I enjoy this beer as it approaches a porter but gives me some of the floral hops to remind me that spring is coming. A little tacky, sure, but I would buy this again."
"Really inoffensive and mild. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but there's just not much going on here."
""
""
"Overall- This is a decent Black IPA. I would like a little more depth to it. Maybe more coffee and chocolate notes. Maybe more of a hop presence. I know they can do it because their Double Black IPA (pilot series) is still one of my favorite Black IPAs to date. 3/5"
"O- A decent Black IPA, but not anything particularly amazing. Some people criticize this style for just being hoppy porters. That seems to be the case here."
"Taste, nice, good hop bitterness, a little less roast at this point. Missing the fruity hop character that makes the best black ales shine. This one leaned a little much on simple grassy bitterness. Sometimes the dehusked black malt just doesn't get enough of the acrid bitterness out of it, and as a result, covers up a little hop flavor. Because of that, this could just as much be called an American porter. Might not have the thickness you'd want, but in the more sesssionable porters, they tend to be weaker in mouthfeel, this is just fine for style."
"Has to be one of the most approachable for the style that I've had. Seems all of Alaskan's regular and seasonal beers are made this way though. I was pretty impressed with this one and would have it again."
"O - Great Black IPA. Def on the high end of bitterness.. could maybe use a bit more flavor to go with it though"
"(160th)"
"Alaskan Brewing Company is adding to their Winter and Summer seasonal line with the introduction of Alaskan Black IPA, a Spring seasonal. The beer pours a dark brown, porter-like, with a not quite tan head that leaves a decent lacing. Piney, resiny citrus hops aromas fill the nostrils with dark, coffee like scents poking through. Roasty malt flavors dominate the pallet at first, with lighter chocolate and citrus flavors balancing out the somewhat bitter finish. A somewhat lighter body is met with a medium amount of carbonation. A very well balanced version of a style that continues to get more and more entrants, and a great beer to sip on those ""Spring"" Alaskan nights."
""
"O - Not my favorite IBA so far but still good. I prefer this style to have loud hop presence with quite and gentle chocolate flavors. It just seemed a little to balanced for my liking."
"must be a newer one from these guys, only the tenth review... pours a nice brown ale/porter color with a 2 inch white head of tiny bubbles. smells less like an ipa and more like a black lager or something. tons of roast in the aroma, not as much hops as may beers in this genre. flavor too, plenty hoppy, but its not dominant. balanced by dark malt and a fairly light mouthfeel for the style. very approachable and drinkable, much more of a hoppy porter or something than a black ipa as i traditionally think of them as the hops just isnt the main focus for me. solid brew."
"O- good beer but not my favorite style of beer love the Alaskan brewery but there our others I would prefer If I had to drink a bipa"
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a pretty good ""BIPA"" Not the best and by far not the worst in the class. Worth a try."
"All 4's"
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid attempt at a black ale. The flavors are all there, but could maybe cleaned up a little."
"O- This is a nice Cascadian Dark/Black IPA. It doesn't overdo the roasted malts like some tend to. The piney, citrusy hops should shine in this style. Its not a hoppy porter. Alaskan kept this in mind when brewing this ale and turned out a sessionable, delicious beer. Not overly flavorful but a nice drinker."
"Drinkability was OK, but the lack of outstanding features makes me wonder why you'd want more than one. Overall, a below average example of what I generally find to a bastard of a style. If you like Cascadia Dark Ales, you'll probably be OK with this beer. Even if the lack of bold hop presence makes me wonder where the ""IPA"" is in this Black IPA."
"O- a good black ipa that was more bitter than robust for the style , recommended though"
"Somehow I'm second to strike on reviews of this very good black IPA. It's simple and creamy and satisfying."
"Overall a nice effort, and a well made beer. Not my favorite hop flavor compared to other black ipa's I have tried."
