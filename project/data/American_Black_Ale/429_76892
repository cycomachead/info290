It created nearly an inch of frothy tan head which left remarkable lacing as it went down the glass. The aroma of this beer is quite enjoyable: dark chocolate, raisins, caramel, pine, and moss all come through very well. The bitterness of the hops, however, is somewhat overwhelming in the taste. Behind the earthy, pine-y notes of the hops, there is a bit of vanilla and the impression that some of the complexity of the aroma is also in the taste. It's just a bit overpowered. I thought the beer had good carbonation and had a pleasant body but nevertheless felt a touch light on my tongue. Overall, I expected a bit more but I enjoyed every bottle in the pack. I will be trying other black IPAs, for sure, but I'll think twice about buying this one again unless there are no other options.","makersmarkers","May 19, 2013"

It is less balanced than others, with a greater reliance on the hops, but that fact should not dissuade anyone from sampling it, as its taste is still very good and memorable. The complexity and other factors make this ale one for the record and one everyone should add to their list of beers to try.","BryanCarey","May 16, 2013"

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, char, light coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon zest, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt notes; solid strength and very pleasant. Taste of dark chocolate, char, light coffee, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, floral, lemon zest, grass, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, char, citrus zest, floral, pine, and grass on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice black IPA. Nice complexity and good balance of hop/malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 10, 2013"

The malts actually have a touch of chocolate that is nice. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but it seems to work in the beer's favor for some reason. This Black IPA might be more simplistic than many of the style, but I find it to be quite enjoyable and manages something rarely accomplished for those of the Cascadian persuasion...it's refreshing!

I'll admit I like many black IPAs, like Hop Strike from Tommyknocker or Stones black IPA, and this one is darn tasty. Rich roasted malts, slight sweetness, robust hops in a nice balance. Like a export stout with extra west coast hops, like a burnt porter gone hoppy, like a beer I want to bring to my mouth again and again. In my mind a brilliant balance, not a giant in abv, which is fine, but big in flavor and richness. Heck, a good competitor with my current regular house brand, Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA...humm... I think I could say I like this more.","DenverLogan","Feb 11, 2013"

It smells kind of sweet though, a bit of cocoa and licorice. Same in the flavour, but with some pine mixing in with the licorice and sweetness. Bitterness was moderate -- a little less pronounced than I expected. Smooth, lowish carbonation, medium body, nice texture.

Smells like a sweet porter mixed with grassy and resiny hops, maybe the slightest hint of peppery notes. The flavor follows through with a nice and complimentary style of east meets west kinda fusion. I dig the flavor profile in that neither the malts nor the hops dominate this one - it's well balanced in a classy and appropriate fashion.

3.69,-0.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a deep red-brown color with a 1" tan head. Head leaves some lacing as it recedes to a thick film. Smell is roasty and citric. Tastes strongly of roasted malt, with citric and pine flavors coming in at the beginning and leaving a bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is medium-light with average carbonation. This is a good CDA, but I feel there are others that drink better.","gkunkle","Jan 21, 2012"

2.92,-21.3,4,2,3,4,3,"O: A well intentioned effort, but it's just middle of the road at best. At least it wasn't a new Black IPA that was priced through the roof which was refreshing.","Halcyondays","Jan 18, 2012"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from bottle, undated, to pint glass. The beer is a very solid black/brown color with a creamy 1 finger tan head with pleasant retention and lacing. The nose presents a good mix of citrusy hops and chocolately malt character. Hop forward but not over the top, quite nice. The flavor consists of very much the same powdery cocoa with mild bitterness and a good amount of citrus hop character. Mild toasty malt presence. Well balanced. Medium bodied with a mouthfeel of soft creaminess. Finishes with a slight chalky texture but is relatively smooth. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer, excellent representation of the style. Look forward to the next!","hopfacebrew","Jan 18, 2012"
3.05,-17.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"O - Falls short of a black IPA, let alone a regular IPA for sure. Maybe I'm spoiled by more expensive beers, but this one just didn't do it for me.","Rizalini","Jan 17, 2012"
3.72,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, I'm not that well versed on Black Ales, even less so with Black IPAs. From what I have had, though, this seems to be a very accessible representation of the style, which I have come to expect from Alaskan Brewing. As an early-spring seasonal, when its still really winter, I enjoy this beer as it approaches a porter but gives me some of the floral hops to remind me that spring is coming. A little tacky, sure, but I would buy this again.","freewheelinbob","Jan 16, 2012"

3.06,-17.5,4,3,3,3,3,"Overall- This is a decent Black IPA. I would like a little more depth to it. Maybe more coffee and chocolate notes. Maybe more of a hop presence. I know they can do it because their Double Black IPA (pilot series) is still one of my favorite Black IPAs to date. 3/5","MADhombrewer","Jan 14, 2012"
3.48,-6.2,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"O- A decent Black IPA, but not anything particularly amazing. Some people criticize this style for just being hoppy porters. That seems to be the case here.","jsprain1","Jan 14, 2012"
3.5,-5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste, nice, good hop bitterness, a little less roast at this point. Missing the fruity hop character that makes the best black ales shine. This one leaned a little much on simple grassy bitterness. Sometimes the dehusked black malt just doesn't get enough of the acrid bitterness out of it, and as a result, covers up a little hop flavor. Because of that, this could just as much be called an American porter. Might not have the thickness you'd want, but in the more sesssionable porters, they tend to be weaker in mouthfeel, this is just fine for style.","Beerandraiderfan","Jan 14, 2012"
3.93,5.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Has to be one of the most approachable for the style that I've had. Seems all of Alaskan's regular and seasonal beers are made this way though. I was pretty impressed with this one and would have it again.","jera1350","Jan 14, 2012"

3.51,-5.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Alaskan Brewing Company is adding to their Winter and Summer seasonal line with the introduction of Alaskan Black IPA, a Spring seasonal. The beer pours a dark brown, porter-like, with a not quite tan head that leaves a decent lacing. Piney, resiny citrus hops aromas fill the nostrils with dark, coffee like scents poking through. Roasty malt flavors dominate the pallet at first, with lighter chocolate and citrus flavors balancing out the somewhat bitter finish. A somewhat lighter body is met with a medium amount of carbonation. A very well balanced version of a style that continues to get more and more entrants, and a great beer to sip on those "Spring" Alaskan nights.","phishsihq","Jan 13, 2012"

3.75,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"must be a newer one from these guys, only the tenth review... pours a nice brown ale/porter color with a 2 inch white head of tiny bubbles. smells less like an ipa and more like a black lager or something. tons of roast in the aroma, not as much hops as may beers in this genre. flavor too, plenty hoppy, but its not dominant. balanced by dark malt and a fairly light mouthfeel for the style. very approachable and drinkable, much more of a hoppy porter or something than a black ipa as i traditionally think of them as the hops just isnt the main focus for me. solid brew.","StonedTrippin","Jan 10, 2012"

3.95,6.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O- This is a nice Cascadian Dark/Black IPA. It doesn't overdo the roasted malts like some tend to. The piney, citrusy hops should shine in this style. Its not a hoppy porter. Alaskan kept this in mind when brewing this ale and turned out a sessionable, delicious beer. Not overly flavorful but a nice drinker.","znichols","Jan 01, 2012"
2.6,-29.9,3,3,2,3,3,"Drinkability was OK, but the lack of outstanding features makes me wonder why you'd want more than one. Overall, a below average example of what I generally find to a bastard of a style. If you like Cascadia Dark Ales, you'll probably be OK with this beer. Even if the lack of bold hop presence makes me wonder where the "IPA" is in this Black IPA.","beertunes","Dec 31, 2011"
