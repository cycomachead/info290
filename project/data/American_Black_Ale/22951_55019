3.83,-0.8,,,,,,"Aroma is citrusy and extremely chocolatey. Notes of tangerine and mango are evident initially, with hints of resin and cannabis accompanying lightly roasted malt. Flavor reveals grapefruit and mango at the base, which is contrasted by lightly sweet chocolate malt, becoming roasty bitter and resiny in the finish. The sharp citrus notes clash with the roast malt bitterness, but the fruity character and chocolate are welcome sensations, in and of themselves. Black ipas can be hit or miss. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole, in this instance. It's more bitter than I prefer.","barczar","Nov 06, 2014"

3.8,-1.6,,,,,,"Single bottle from a 4-pack decanted into a tulip glass. Nearly pitch black with a copious quantity of thick, frothy beige head, great head retention here. Pungent hops on the nose, pine needles, grapefruit and orange rinds, fresh cut grass and parsley, along with a cola-like brown spice, licorice, light roast coffee, baker's cacao, and vanilla (!). Wonderful aroma. Palate might not quite reach these lofty heights but this is still a damn fine black IPA. Like this brewer's Galactica IPA, there are a few rough edges but the potent flavors nevertheless deliver the goods. Some wood char is apparent and serves to cut the sweetness on the nose. Decent balance between citrus/pine hops and dark malts ... Perhaps the latter have a slight edge although the hopping is far from subtle. Moderate carbonation, perhaps just on the low end, decent full body and a roasted yet green finish with a pleasing floral perfume. High price point for these 4-packs here and one can debate whether the execution justifies the price of acquisition. Probably.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 11, 2014"

While I am enjoying this glass of Hoppy Feet, the beer itself is pushing 7 months of age and I am inclined to believe that the hop profile has suffered as a result. Considering both of those facts, I'll more than likely revisit this one at some point when I find a younger bottle, and adjust the score accordingly.","thehyperduck","Jul 21, 2014"

The recessed dark fruit tones were enhanced licorice sweetness that tied everything together, without making this seem artificial or not true to style. There's a lot to like here and as this warmed up, it grew nicely on me. A good take on the style that's easy to enjoy year-round and possibly, the best current offering from Clown Shoes.","JerzDevl2000","Jun 08, 2014"

Predictably black liquid, impenetrable but not like a slab of onyx, same fade to a yellow tint near the surface, able to see some very tiny bubbles breaking the surface too. While the nose offers a zesty orange citrus spritz as well as damp earthiness, the cocoa, coffee bean, vanilla to toffee rule things, after that nutty and bready, any foundational grassiness cloaked, stays dry on the whole, tends to hover more than lift and dissipate. Full-bodied, layers nimbly on the tongue, even greater emphasis here on chocolate, cocoa, mocha with coffee and vanilla notes, all feels “powdered” and not sticky sweet. Able to show more greenness which helps it be fresher, seems to fit with the roast well, even touch of chicory at times. More lactose than spice. Minimal fruit, hard to tease out distinct flavors. The orange to grapefruit citrus rises through the finish. Nice how the palate weight remains after the flavors release. It’s very well made but not something many could pound all night.","farrago","May 10, 2014"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"My first experience with a Clown Shoes product and it was definitely a good one. This ale pours a hearty cola color with a thick tan head which lasts longer than most black ipas. There is substantial lacing and a nice mouth coating chewiness to this ale. The aroma is malty sweet and hoppy bitter with a blend of floral citrus notes and a deep smoky coffee smell. The flavor follows suit. A perfect blend of the hoppy bitterness of an ipa and the sweet smoky maltiness of a porter. This is everything I want and expect from a black ipa. May have even surpassed sublimely self righteous as my new favorite black ipa. Can't wait to try the bottle of Hoppy Feet 1.5 that I picked up at the same time.","lochef81","Jan 19, 2014"

Dark roasted and lightly charred malt aromas with citrus hops, and touch of sweet dark chocolate. Medium bodied with rich carbonation through the middle and slick oily feel at the end. Dark roasted and burnt malt flavors up front with a touch of chocolate sweetness.  Tangy pine hop bitterness builds through the middle with a hint of citrus hop underneath.

4.08,5.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"I'm really liking their labels and the concept, and the fact started on sort of a joke. Brewing this black IPA, sometimes you stumble onto something good. These guys are contract brewed at Mercury Brewing in Ipswich, MA. This pours pitch black, and meets the perfect mix of dark porter and hefty balls out IPA. Dark tan khaki head almost pitch black body except for some ruby highlights at the edges of the glass. Aroma has herbal, pine, and citric notes amongst a back drop of dark malts roasted dark coffee and chocolate notes I'm liking the marriage of the two. I know this style but it's been awhile since I've had a really well balanced version of the Cascadian Black Ale, or Black IPA. In the nose I'm even getting hints of licorice and salted caramel, don't call me crazy I'm seriously getting a mix of those aromas. Flavor is dry dark roasted malts, with hints of cocoa and nearly burnt espresso. Big vegetal bitter, earthy notes, reign supreme with citrus peel and pine cone needles kicking in, there's a bit of a hop assault here. However, the dark creamy chocolate notes take on some of the harshness and I'm left finishing this beer at a surprisingly quick rate. Carbonation is dead on mellow but carries the resinous hops quite well, medium to full bodied range leaves a lingering hop bitterness between sips, with hop burps to follow. Overall, quite an impressive beer that I can appreciate the complexity of all the elements that and the fact that it hit at exactly the right time around the height of the black IPA craze a couple years ago.","WVbeergeek","Oct 22, 2013"

Great cling along the glass. Aromas of roast and bitter coffee with an overlay of resin and piney hops, giving a pretty dynamic and layered nose. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a campfire char and smoke forward, bitter dark roasted coffee in the backbone, and a spiced and resiny hops presence that builds at the end of the palate. The aftertaste ends up being a balance of roast and smoke with bitter hops. Light, crisp body with a dry, clean, crisp finish. The beer does leave a slightly smoked linger as you continue to drink.

Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pine, floral, grass, light char, light nuttiness, and roasted/floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with nice complexity and very balanced hop and roasted notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, floral, light nuttiness, and roasted/floral earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, floral, light nuttiness, and roasted/floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance of hop and roasted malt flavors with good complexity; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black IPA. All around great balance of roasted malt and hop flavors with good complexity; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I feel no need to have another. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both nice, with the appearance being my favorite. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they were the weak point of this beer and they need some work. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there's many other Black IPA's I enjoy much more and I wouldn't recommend it. All in all I was let down with this beer, Clown Shoes seems to be pretty good with hoppy beers, but this one just didn't do it for me and I thought it was pretty damn rough around the edges. Better luck next time guys. So far this is my least favorite beer from Clown Shoes.","StoutHunter","Aug 23, 2013"

I can still tell it has quite a nice foam head, and a very dark color, precise analysis of shades and tints unnecessary. Whiff of both hops and malts, exactly what you want in a black IPA. Same goes for taste, both a nice malt flavor, not too choclatey closer to nutty, and the hops leave a citrus note and are not over powering. Not overpowering on either stout or IPA qualities, I'd say almost a 50/50 blend of a standard nutty stout and a citrusy IPA. It works well. This is a great black IPA! regularly available and is of high quality. If you are into black IPA's this is one you can put in the books as one you can rely on.","REIFICATION","Jan 02, 2012"

The taste was a good roasty malt which a bitter grapefruit that provides the nice after taste. The mouthfeel was a medium body with good carbontaion.

It pours a luscious dark chocolate brown with a fluffy and rather persistent light tan head that sticks around for a bit and leaves some good lacing. Flavor is hoppy and bitter with a hint of evergreen and a mocha undertone and a touch of licorice. Full-bodied texture is smooth yet edgy, and quite fizzy, leaving a hoppy and chocolaty finish.

A heavy hand of bitter and pine hops is counteracted by a cocoa powder-like backbone, which leaves the palate dry. A tinge of alcohol warmth signals the end of the experience.

The flavor is a perfect balance between soft roastiness and a botanical bitterness. There's just a touch of sweetness that is erased in the bitter finish. The aftertaste is kind of ashy.

The taste holds notes of coffee, darkly roasted malts, light leather, light char, sharp pine resin, and lime skin. Things come off decidedly bitter and acrid, to the point that my face evinces my body's inner wincing. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, what seems like a good beer decides to go all Mr. Hyde on my tongue, ruining everything.

The fruitiness dies down and blends into a hoppy bitterness that becomes a stale coffee that leaves lingering roasted and raw hop flavors. It has nice transitions and is well layered, but I'm not completely satisfied. It misses the raw, bold hoppiness of Stone's SSR and it's not as well rounded or clean as the SN Stout. This lies somewhere between the two, but I do wish it would pick more of a side (ideally more towards the rough and tumble SSR). This is a good beer, but it could be more assertive on one of two lines, either of which would make it a more impressive drink.","UTCengOwl","Sep 21, 2011"

The hops aren't detracting from the brew at all. The strong northwest hops are what the style is all about (there's a reason it was referred to as Cascadian Dark Ale at one time for the hops coming from the Cascade Mountain Range area in the NW), they're just a bit too strong for me in this beer. Or maybe the roast and dark malt isn't strong enough. The carbonation, though, is what does detract for the beer.

The brew has a very nice dark brownish black color with a pretty nice looking tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer has a big hop aroma on the nose which I found to be very nice. There is also some hints of chocolate in there as well. The taste had some lemony citrus to it along with a bitter dry aftertaste of chocolatey flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth and very drinkable.

Very dry, but also very little roastiness. That's fine by me, I'd rather this be a black ale than a mischaracterised porter. The taste is very, very dry- almost none of the malt shows through. Very attenuated, with almost beefy flavors, and a bitterness that approaches that of an Amaro. Pine and earth notes, along with some gentian tastes here. Very dry in the mouth, almost austere. An interesting beer, and a bit different than others I've had in the style. Wouldn't be confused with a porter, but also not with a juicy IPA. Nice.","Georgiabeer","Jul 16, 2011"

Nice medium body with a smooth and mellow carbonation and a lightness to it that again was outside what I was expecting. Smooth flavor, clean, crisp, loaded with bitter citrus hops.

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a three finger light tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, earth, and bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, citrus, citrus hop, and dark chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't too bad. It was very forward on the roastiness and dark chocolate flavors. Almost too much so... They kind of stole the show over the hops if one can believe such a thing.

I always think IBAs just taste like very bitter/hoppy porters. And get way better after aging, trying to tame the bitterness and flavor hops down, and bring out the maltiness.

Not sure exactly how this brewery(ies) works exactly but they all tend to make decent to great beers so I'm happy to see this distributed up to Maine as of late - I remember this coming out just as I moved from Boston. Anywho... a fresh sample (Feb '11) poured into my imperial Nerax pint. Brown with red tints, nice head receding to an espresso-esque foam, laces well. I smell chocolate, resiny west coast hops, and a nice earthy musty note. More hops up front at first gulp - nice and bitter, piney and sappy, a touch of citrus, finishes with a nice dusty chocolate malt backbone. I really like this beer - I have to admit to being a bit of a sucker for this style - I get a kick out the debate that the Black IPA seems to stir up, and I also get a kick out of drinking it. Hoppy, malty, and somehow balanced, and refreshing and drinkable and robust all at the same time. What's not to like?

Best looking black ipa I've seen... The aroma instantly makes me think of a west coast dipa with wonderful fruity grass hop notes, bet this is even better fresh on tap. Once you get past the hops on the front there is a caramel backbone with a hint of smoke. Really really solid. My only complaint is that wish it was a little stronger... Wow, this is strong, threw me off guard for sure. Tons of char, ash, alcohol, very bitter pine hops, and a hint of chocolate. At first I'm almost disgusted way too strong, the more I drink and the warms settles a bit, however wish this was a touch more subtle with a better mixture; balance...

Hoppiness is bold but not too aggressive, though the bit- terness does come on strong. Dark chocolate and toasted bread graininess displays a great base.

The taste follows along the same lines. There's some roast and there's some pine, but I don't really get anything coming together. The finish has something off with a very strange dryness.

More of the same in the flavour - pine and caramel dominating, but with some citrus, chocolate and a hint of licorice present as well. Strong bitterness more than balanced the other flavours. Medium bodied with a creamy texture from the well-integrated carbonation. A bit astringent though, giving it more dryness than it needs. Overall I liked this.

Taste was balanced for the style. Plenty of hops, but there was also a good amount of malt and just a bit of roasted coffee flavor.

Pours a jet black color, with a very thin tan head that quickly dissipates, without much lacing left behind. A nice citrus hop aroma, not overpowering as the roasted malts are also present. In the end, it is a pleasant aroma, but I really like more late addition hops in my IPAs (even black ones). Rather pronounced bitterness in the flavor, there are some citrus flavors there, but bitterness takes on a metallic characteristic and practically overwhelms the roasted malts. Rather thin body, with medium carbonation. I think this is a good start for this beer, as most of the negatives I found in it could be worked out with different hop usage/timing. Since it's a new brewery, I look forward to future batches to see if they balance out the hops a bit more.","bhalter8","Jun 15, 2010"

4.05,4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Very hop-forward on the tongue, citrusy and lightly herbal with a touch of bittersweet chocolate. Light and semi-crisp, the malt profile is pretty dry and subtle, taking a backseat to the big hop flavors. The finish is pleasantly bitter and biting with a touch of chocolate. Pretty damn good, thanks Arbi.","largadeer","May 06, 2010"

Pine dominates the smell as the label suggests. Taste is hoppy pine resin with hint of chocolate and coffee. Dry mouthfeel. Moderately warming but not overpowering.

Definitely enjoyed it, but if you aren't already a hophead who wants to appreciate the fade from one bitter flavor to the next, it might just taste overwhelmingly bitter.","vdoz3","Apr 13, 2010"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Never had a ""black IPA", so this is a first. Like the bottle, like the deep dark pour and creamy head. Smell was more malty than hoppy, mouthfeel was more creamy than citrusy. This is different from what I usually drink and I like it, very drinkable, almost too drinkable for the 7%. Big ups.","chickencoop","Apr 02, 2010"
4.72,22.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Had this on tap at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. Wow. I mean seriously. This was my first Black IPA and it rocked. Massive hops on the nose, pine, grapefruit, some flowers, basically what you want to smell in a great IPA. The flavor whacks you with bitter citrus and lots of pine, but then you get some nuances like in a stout: chocolate, smoke, roast. I loved this beer.","BeerMusketeer","Mar 31, 2010"

2.76,-28.5,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"A whopper of a head is probably the most notable thing about this beer-- it's tall, dark and thick, sinking at the edges and lasting forever in the center. With the deep dark color of the beer, it looks for all the world like a good stout. A somewhat toasted aroma is mixed with rubber and some tart citrus. Thick body, which goes well with the color and the head, but the taste was sadly overshadowed by vinyl and burned wheat toast. The hops tasted raw and dry and way too bitter, and the edges were quite sharp. Get rid of the sharpness and the vinyl and this could be a decent beer in an IPA style. For the time being, however, it's a pass.","gfreed","Feb 14, 2010"

3.85,-0.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I can't say I am that crazy about the Black IPA style, but since this one is local, and it has received some praise, I figured it was worth a try. Poured out a pretty much pitch black color, with a creamy looking white heading. Smell is a mix of chocolate and minty hops. Man, I was not expecting the hop assault from the taste. This stuff is pretty bitter and earthy. The malt really doesn't play too much of a part in the taste or body, as this one comes off between thin and medium. Drinkability is definitely nice, I could sip this one for a while. I highly recommend this beer to fans of the style. Mercury, keep experimenting.","jamie2dope","Jan 30, 2010"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A nice surprise. This is complex but still hits the hops I look for in an IPA very well. It has some dark malt which balance out the hops well. I like it and could have two or three.","tigg924","Jan 29, 2010"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Update November 2010: I'm less enamored of this beer than I was when I first reviewed it. The hops are just too biting, too leafy, and not estery enough to make this an interesting IPA, dark or otherwise. The drying leaf does sort of pull out some of the dark roasts and nutty flavors a bit more than otherwise, but it also brings to the fore too many burnt flavors too.","albern","Jan 03, 2010"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"F: Finishes pretty bitter as well, but not over the top. It's not as bitter as I would have expected at first, but as it dries off, which it does well, it gets more bitter and has quite a hop bite on the finish. More of the pine and dry bitterness seem to ramp up on the finish for a nice long bitter after taste. Not much on the malt or sweet character side lingering, but there is some more of that smoked malt flavor and hints of maple or brown sugar taste seem to linger. It's a pretty interesting dark IPA. I'm becoming a big fan of the black IPAs as it adds nice malty, dark, roasty, and sweet characters to a strong IPA beer. Best of both worlds, and if done right can be great. Although it can be done wrong, which I did on a homebrew, and it doesn't taste so good at that point. This one is done pretty well, but I think isn't quite a nice as Stone's.","jlindros","Dec 26, 2009"
