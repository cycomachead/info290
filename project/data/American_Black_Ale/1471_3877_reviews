"Overall, this is a beautiful and enticing brew whose presentation belies its aggressive, bitter taste.  If you’re into that sorta thing you may well enjoy this, but I was hoping for something more balanced."
""
""
"And im drinking the ashes taste lingers in mouth for long time mine had a date of 2/17/14 almost year old ? I poured out it was so bad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite a decent beer. The main think I love is the pitch black appearance. The main thing I would change would be to balance out the smokiness and the sweet malts a bit more."
""
"Dark full body with a thin tan head. Intense cocoa and slightly smoked malts. Smooth mouthfeel with a good amount of bitterness. Lots to like here."
""
""
""
"Not the greatest in my opinion. Just an average dark beer. I like the hops, which this one is missing."
""
""
"Very dark and bitter just what I like."

"Dark Horse says this has a hard time being called a porter or stout, and I agree. I'm sure this is spot-on for the emerging Black Ale category, as it is truly black. Looks pretty damn good, Imperial Stout-like with a thin brown head, but smells more like an IPA. I hoped for a more rounded malt and roast in the flavor profile, but mostly I just get west coast hops. Not my cup of brew."

"The feel is quite full but it still keeps an easy drinking presence. Very enjoyable yet nicely complex."

"Pours a pitch black body with a small tan head with okay retention. Aromas are very roasty, big on espresso, inky, with just a bit of cocoa nibs. Full bodied and loaded with bold flavors; a slow sipper for sure. Starts slightly sweet before the darkest of flavors, pure char, gasp-inspiring smokiness, burnt chocolate,black licorice (I get a distant whiff of a Sambuca burn) and cold coffee grounds take over at an intensity level that many might consider challenging. Not a beer for the newbies who prefer something ""light," but right up the alley for lovers of dark beers that explore all aspects of beery blackness. What an unexpected pleasure. Bravo!"
""
"I enjoyed this one - nice roasty flavors."
""
""
"Final Word: Dark Horse doesn’t disappoint with this one, and I highly recommend snagging a glass if possible. The coffee flavor is true and earthy, with a light texture and enough gentle sweetness to keep it drinkable. You’ll get the full flavor of real coffee, rich chocolate, and mocha without the thick, oily mouthfeel that the flavors could imply. This beer isn’t a complex brew, but is rich and in balance, making it easily accessible, and should only be avoided if you hate coffee. Get adventurous and try it for brunch!"

"A good roast forward beer. I don't pick up much from the hops but that is ok as I am not a huge fan of the style."

"O- While I agree that this can only be characterized as an American Strong, I feel it has a bit of an identity crisis and lacks focus. Has the flavor of a stout but lacks the body of a stout while having the sweetness of a barleywine and the hop character of an IPA. Color me confused. Still, it's drinkable although perplexing."

"EDIT: The other site which will remain nameless flat-out calls it a porter - and that's before I noticed this site calling it a STRONG ALE. I'm not going to raise scores, but it's still a damn good dark beer; I can still look at it in an even better light due to the fact it's not designed to be hoppy."

"Poured from a bottle with a dark brown color with a foamy tan head. Has a coffee and chocolate aroma, and taste is also coffee and chocolate, though with a bitter finish. Has a nice medium body feel. This has a stout feel and flavor, but without the roasted malts. Probably one of my favorite porters."
""
""
"This was enjoyable, though far from what I would consider an American Strong Ale. I think this one is more suited to a dry Stout. Sit back and enjoy it with conversation and hors d’ouvres."
""
"Poured a black body with one finger head on top of an aroma that is definitely roasted and coffee like along with hints of chocolate. The taste is one of strong roasted malts, again malts are similiar to coffee (maybe java is better word), a chewey, almost bready beer that is dry but mixed with some bitter chocolate and I swear I get hints of both vanilla and dark fruits like figs. Simple but enjoyable sipper."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid brew that just misses on the finer points of drinkability. This is a one and done type of brew, but I'd come back."
""
""
""
""
"I sat here in the tap room reviewing a beer on the phone.This beer is very dark brown with light brown head.Smooth feel in mouth and taste not to strong.Not real bitter with a hint of nut taste.Now the glass is almost gone I want another so it is pretty dam good."

"On-tap. Tasting glass @ BierCab (Barcelona). Black color, brown froth. Lasting crown leaves a wide lacing collar on sides. Intense chocolate & licorice aromas, toasted & sweet malt notes, slight roasted to the nose. Creamy upfront & sharp bitterness from roasted malts. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Velvet palate & dense texture. Prunes & fudge chocolate in the middle. Sweet & slight bitter finish. Long aftertaste. Delicious !!"
""
""
"Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""

"O-A good beer, increasing the bitterness would help round out the beer more or more chocolate in the tatse. Still a good beer."

"Overall, a really tasty black ale, great drinkability, nice dark malt flavors and presence."

"Medium bodied and carbonated, with an excellent creaminess to the feel overall. I think most drinkers would characterize this as a hoppy stout, at least that's how I see it. Good stuff for a midweight stout-style beer that isn't too sweet and laden with adjuncts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks heavy and velvetty smooth with a touch of alcohol warming at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lots of dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee in this big beer. Worth trying: I have no doubt some people will love this beer that drinks like an imperial American porter."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/11/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, toffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted/dark malts; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, char, toast, toffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, cocoa, toast, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent robust porter style. All around great balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt flavors with big robustness; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall / Drinkability: I know this beer is listed as a strong ale, but it strikes me as a stout, and an imperial one at that. Very tasty and I could see myself buying it again, but one an evening is enough. I wish I had some cookies to go with it, but pretty good by itself."
"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a half inch of medium brown head. Some lacing. Earthy aroma with lots of dark fruits and chocolate. Hints of smoke. The taste is smoke with some nice roasted malts and dark chocolate. Earth as well but not nearly as much dark fruit flavor as the aroma lead me to expect. Bitter dark chocolate with more roasted malts at the end. Medium bodied with a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Not sure what it is classified as but this one reminds me of a Porter. Regardless, pretty solid beer I'd have again. Good balance of the bitter dark chocolate and the smoke/roasted flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall, though, this is exceptional stuff. I pretty much picked this up on a whim: I've very much enjoyed some of the other Dark Horse beers, but there was nothing particularly attracting me to this one. I'm very glad I did select it though: this is truly a very, very good beer."
""
"O: 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, not a bad strong ale. I like the amount of roast, chocolate, and coffee in this one. Its very solid. With the mouthfeel was a bit better."
""

"Poured a jet-black into my HD pilsner glass (a birthday present) leaving a nice two-finger tan colored head. First impression was that this more a porter or stout than anything, mouthfeel and aftertaste confirmed that impression. I was expecting a black ""IPA"" based on much of what is written, though a black ale does not an IPA make, despite what some beer "" aficionado's"" would have you believe. Overall, this was a decent brew that one can enjoy without getting hammered...unless you consume a lot. The only LIMFAC is lack of bitterness I've come to expect from this genre, of course some might find that more to their liking."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a very unique tasting brew, a roast hoppy strong ale, quite neat, I really dig this beer."

"o - Overall a pretty nice beer; lots of roasted notes and malts throughout, with some bitter coffee and chocolate in the taste. Reminds me more of an american stout but whatever, it's a pretty good beer. Would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Lots of roast malt character and coffee, with an interesting underlying hop citrus profile. Just enough chocolate to add character, though I'd rather it be more prevalent."
""
""
""
""
"A nice, sweeter stout."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink for the style (American Strong Ale) and the higher ABV - drinks like a smaller beer and is pretty enjoyable.Nice complexity to the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a superior ale. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very black indeed, this pours a very dark brown/black color with a slight light brown head. If you didn't know better you’d swear it was a stout. There are some robust notes to it with a little sweet sugar too. There is a lot of flavor here for an ale. The texture is smooth, yet it is thinner than a stout. Lots of chalky malts and coffee flavors in the mix. Certainly a very interesting brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: With all the excellent malt flavor and dark color you could swear this is a porter. I think anything really goes for this style, so it is nice that brewers can just make a good beer without worrying too much about style points. This beer is great and I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark black hue and I mean black with no light let in whatsoever,the smell is dark espresso mixed with milky cappuccino,cigars,raisin bread and dark chocolate,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation which is nicely suited and has tastes of rich dark chocolate,espresso,dark fruits,raisin bread and finished with a hoppy bitterness and overall I like it and in a style of its own borderlining on stout and black ale would drink again cheers."

"I must say this is a pretty interesting beer. The appearance had me thinking stout. The nose was amazing. As soon as I poured this beer I could smell layers of aromas. Then I entered into the equally complex taste. At first there were some big, roasty, chocolate notes. Then a deep caramel presence that adds a sugary, caramel-candy flavor that meshes well with the chocolate. There are dark fruit notes in the aftertaste that also lend some depth. The alcohol presence makes this beer seem a bit bigger than it is, but that doesn't bother me too much. Overall, this is an impressive beer that is worth trying."
""
""
""
"A nice thick head atop an opaque must be black ale. Decent lacing and very nice retention. Smell is chocolate malt and coffee with a firm earthy hops. Solid English style fruitiness ties together the toffee and caramel sweetness. Taste is rather like an RIS but dryer. Much. Lots of dark roasted malts and charcoal. No sign of the abv. Figgish plum fruitiness lightly shows before a mildly astringent swallow. Earthy hops, dry finish. Feel is lighter than you might think while still chewy, carbonated with a smooth, mild character. Superb drinkability being one of its best qualities. A good roasty dark ale that goes down well ."

"O: A very drinkable take on a RIS. All the flavor, none of the booziness. Goes great with bacon. I want another and I might buy 6."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed drinking this beer because it delivered a lot of flavors of coffee beans and roasted malts without the heavier body of a Russian Imperial Stout. Any traces of alcohol are very well hidden from the taste. There is also a good balance between the malts and hops."
""
""
"This is an American Stout. I think it is a good version and would recommend this beer to others. Pair with something chocolate. Probably great with BBQ as well."
"O: This beer really took me by surprise, but in the best possible way; I am an absolute roast fiend, and this filled my kilned malt quota for a while. We’re not talking Dark Horse Lite – this is a totally different beer. And for only two bucks a bottle, this is a hell of a deal."
""
"RIS or hoppy porter? Hits like a sledgehammer with the dark flavors but there are hops there, too. Heavy duty, with just a bit too much charcoal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels creamy yet acidic, with a medium weight body that is silky overall. Easily sippable, and very drinkable for the strength of flavors. Strong effort from Dark Horse."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty roasty."
""
"O: really impressed - this is a well-crafted black ale. If you like Stone's S' Self-Righteous Ale, Uinta's Dubhe, or Dark Element, you'll find this beer is waaay better than its (current) ""good"" rating."
""
"Overall: A brew that isn't in a certain style, stout richness, with porter drinkability, a sweet maltiness balanced by the bitter dark malt and the smooth hops. Well done."
""
"O: This was an outstanding sweet, dark beer. The sweetness was very pleasing and fit very well with the dark roasted coffee-like malt flavor; and, the little bit earthy hops bitterness was just the right flavor to balance the sweetness and enhance the overall experience of this beer. In a very big and competitive world of great craft brews this is one of the very best dark beers. It should definitely be on the list of “must try” if you can find it."
"Overall, a quality beer. As I said a couple times, drinks like a stout. It's a pretty big, deep, rich, coffee flavored beer."
""
""
"I don't now why they don't just market this as a porter. It's a really nice, dark, roasty beverage. Everything is well-balanced between sweet and roasty (perhaps tilted just a bit towards sweet) and the feel is nice and slick. Try it if you like porters or sweet stouts."
""
""
"Good black ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An ambivalent beer. The front end feels confused, over carbonated, and overly sweet, but the center and finish are fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black, very thick pour, almost no head. Scents of coffee, lots of malt, chocolate, molasses, and a touch of cashew. Taste follows the nose to a tee, huge notes of coffee and malt, really a fantastic combo. Thick mouthfeel. Another awesome beer from Dark Horse."
""
""
""
"Pours thick and black beneath a small, creamy dark tan head. Highly malty aroma...dark chocolate roast, espresso, molasses, slight nuttiness, some creamy fruit. Big malt, char, heavy roast, and a dark, fruity tartness. Some sweetness, but it works well with the big roasty quality and smooths everything out nicely into the finish. The roasted malt is big at first, but I would say it's more like a quality, lighter roast coffee with it's fruity overtones...not like a dark espresso or french roast at all. The warmer this gets, the better. Medium body and smooth. Really nice all around! I've been wanting to try this for years and I'm glad it's finally available to me now. Somewhere kinda sorta between a porter, a stout, and an ice coffee...or something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured with the guys and people at Sams. Black body, with a strong smell of coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I cant relly get much but a roasty thick porter. Light Single stout if you wanna swing that way. The taste is just the same. Lots of a bitter coffee and severly bitter chocolate. Light body and the booze is hidden."
""
"A nice balanced rich and complex beer (more RIS than strong ale to me)."
"A big, bitter and malty brew with juicy citrus hops flavor."
"Note to self:  having had this several times since writing the review above, I won't be drinking this very often.  The roastiness is just too bitter and burnt for me."
""
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 05-26-2011)"
""
""
""
""
"The flavor comes off with that heavy and intense roast profile, followed by a sharply pronounced bitterness upfront. It’s a strong beer with a great body and a wonderful finish. I could easily imagine this bourbon barrel aged… (mmm… I’m drooling here.) Sip it and enjoy. I loved it!"
""
""
"O - A good beer but pretty standard. Could get this quality stout just about anywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad to have had this and would love to have another. Dark Horse has yet to disappoint me on any dark beers. Double Crooked Tree was not too good IMO but everything else has been solid."
""
"O: An interesting beer for sure. It's just an inch away from a stout but it's fruitier and smokier than most stouts I've ever had. A smooth and fairly complex beer. Doesn't stand out as amazing but it's solid."
""
""
"O. A very good little beer here, kinda drinks like a lighter Founders Breakfast Stout. More emphasis on malt than on coffee, yet chocolate and coffee roast flavors each get their emphasis. Well done."
"Interesting - American strong ale (other than a catch all) is a bit of a misnomer - the Dark Horse Website states ""has a hard time being called a stout or porter but it fits nicely into the category of a delicious strong black ale""."
""
""
"O: Nothing revolutionary here, but I enjoyed it very much. Nice roasty tastes, well-rounded body. The brewers are hesitant to call this a stout or porter, but it's close enough that fans of those styles will find a lot of common ground. A solid buy, and it drinks very easily for a beer that is pushing 8% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an intense beer. Lots of flavor, but it didn't all work for me. Tone down the bitterness or the smoke and we'd be talking."
"Steve"
"This is a rich and flavorful brew, and not at all what I'd expected from the bottle and name."
""
"O: an outstanding offering here. The flavor profile of a stout, but the body and drinkability of a black ale. At 7%my you would think more booze would be on the agenda, but its hidden well and easy to put a few back."
""
""
""
"O/D-Not a bad brew. Unique enough to set itself a part from most. Maybe a bit too richly sweet for me. I did enjoy this but wouldn't but a whole 6-pack of it."
""
"Poured pitch black with a small creamy tan head that receded to a thin patchy layer. Aroma heavy with dark roasted malts and espresso; if this hadn't been listed as a strong ale, I would've assumed it was a stout from the smell of it. More roastiness in the taste, dark malts, ash, coffee, a touch of cocoa. Pretty one-dimensional, but still pretty good. The thinner body is the only indication really that this isn't a stout. Fairly smooth with a drying bitterness in the finish, pretty easily drinkable overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great brew that is put into a misleading category. This is labeled on the bottle as a black ale, on BA as an American Strong Ale, but it really tastes like an American stout! Tasty stuff. Once again, bravo Dark Horse."
"O - This is an interesting brew that I fill fits the bill of what we're calling Black IPAs better than an American Strong Ale. The hoppy finish catches you off guard, but overall, the flavor profile is somewhat basic. I wish there were some more subtle flavors in there."
"Overall - A pleasant beer, for sure. I'm enjoying it as it keeps me guessing as to what I'm supposed to be tasting."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a very light level of carbonation. It is a decent arrangement of flavors but all together I just scratch my head and dont quite know what to make of it. To me, it sort of comes across like the makings of a black lager but without the crispness and it carries a bit more bold character across the board. It isn't bad, but then again it isn't something I would be terribly excited to have again either."
""
""
"Overall a solid, very drinkable beer with a higher alcohol content but not an alcohol taste. American Strong Ale? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, kind of like an imperial black ipa or something like that. the smell was what i was hoping for in the taste. it was still good, just surprisingly roasty. i was hoping for something more like a batch 9000."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of my favorite dark beers. Not as hoppy as a ""black IPA"" but this beer has been around way before that style became popular."
""
""
""
""
"D- took me a few minutes to wrap my head around this one nut I eventually liked it very much; not super drinkable only due to body and complex flavors but enjoyable; very well rounded beer - nice color, taste and mouthfeel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew poured out much thicker than I expected. The head was tan and creamy looking. This beer could be a stout I think. The smell of the beer was had some big roasted aromas to it along with some earthy lager notes too. The taste of the beer was pretty good. I liked the rich roasted flavors that this had. The mouthfeel was heavy and thick. Overall this was a realli interesting brew. I would probably drink it again if I came across it."
"I like this. Lots of flavor and a treat for those who are not afraid of bitter beer."
" Overall definately a quality beer,which didn't let me down and I am glad that I bought a whole case. I don't think I could polish off to many of these at a time,just a good beer to sit down and drink 2 or 3."
""
""
"Overall: A beer worthy of the winter months."

" ~ This is a good beer and one I certainly recommend to others. This was a birthday gift from a good friend of mine, Spills. Thanks buddy!"

"O - Like others have said, drinks like a porter/stout. I found it to be quite tasty and for $1.50/bottle I will drink some more."
"Pours super black in color with a very unique creamy head. Aromas of dark chocolate, leather, and tobacco in the nose. Flavor mostly consisting of dark chocolate, dark malt, and slight leather and roasty and smokiness. A great strong ale that I convinced my local pub to get on draft because I love it so much."
"O - Both sweet and chocolaty, while being roasty and with coffee flavor. Porter, stout or whatever you want to call it, this beer is delicious!"
"O - a real nice beer. I'd drink this regularly. Nothing wrong with it, and its pretty tasty."
"Overall, a very surpising dark beer with tos of hops. If that is your sweet spot, then this is for you!"
"O: This is more of a hoppy stout than a strong ale. Not too bad, but it was not really what I expected."
"I hope I can try some more from this brewery. Very nice!"
"Drinkability: Fun. Unique bottle and artwork. Loved the name. ""Reserve"" indicates something special and it fits the billing."
"O - An excellent beer. Not sure why it isnt just labeled a stout because that sure is what it tastes like to me. A great display of what can be done to showcase malt flavors without needing a big, hoppy slap in the face."
"O: If I had to describe this beer: a mix between Schwarzbier, Smoked beer and Imperial Stout. Nice!"
"Overall: This is a nice alternative to stouts or porters, I enjoyed it very much. I would get this one again, if given the opportunity."
"O: this is a bier to savor - it's more beastly than you'd think. I paid $10 for the 6 pack, so solid deal for this quality beer. Still haven't had a bad one from Dark Horse - this one could take #2 of theirs."
"O: I'm not sure what distinguishes this from a stout. But anyway, this is not bad for a stout-like beer, solidly on the roasty end of the spectrum (which is not really my cup of... beer)."
"A solid craft brew!"
"O/D: Flavors are welcomed, be it a different beer. Too mineral tasting to enjoy multiple, but oddly enjoyable. Would love to age this."
"O: Dark Horse's Reseve Special Black Bier Ale is a letdown. I was expecting a rich and complex black ale, and instead got a rather ho-hum and really weird little beer. Off bottle maybe? It's possible, and I'd certainly try this again to compare, though I'm not in a rush to do so."
"O: Great beer. Really impressed here. I cannot get over how big and rich the taste is. I wish I could get this more around my parts!"
"Thanks to Doodler for giving this to me last fall. Pours black with a nice tan creamy head. Creamy cocoa and coffee on the nose. Taste is a blend of bitter chocolate, slight creaminess, almost as if there's a bit of lactose in here, and some bitter hop presence. Nice, creamy mouthfeel with medium/high carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer. I don't care for the strong hop component of this beer, but otherwise, quite good."
"O: I could have done without the smoke, but this was a pretty enjoyable beer."
"Not bad overall, a little imbalanced at first but evens out a little with time. Can't say anything really stood out, but I wouldn't avoid it."
"Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. It tastes more like a Black IPA than an American Strong Ale to me, but thats probably a moot point."
"O: One of my first black biers, this is definitely one I'd come back to! Wasn't sure if I'd like the style or not, but I do. Too bad I'll have to go back to Michigan to get it."
"I liked this beer. Another good one from this brewery."
"All I tasted were burnt, acrid, bitter flavors, and I didn't enjoy the beer. Could not even finish the flight's sample cup."
"This beer is seriously awesome. I'm not sure what separates this from a russian imperial stout, but it is awesome. Very tasty, super flavorful, and impressively drinkable for its enormous flavor and relatively high (and might i add well hidden) alcohol content. A bit heavy on the dark roasts as you drink it, but still, yum."
"This beer improves greatly (to my palate and preference) once it's near room temperature. My complaint is that I don't want to wait to drink beer until it's warmed up that much."
"An intensely flavorful brew that highlights some rather dark flavor qualities. The mouthfeel is a bit of a deterrent to enjoying more than a few of these at a time."
"O- This beer is much more fit to be a stout then a strong ale. A good buy and an easy drinker. Glad I picked this up. Looking forward to trying more from Dark Horse. A good morning beer."
"Overall-This is a Porter in my eyes. Very roasty and balanced with plenty of flavors. Nice brew."
"O- originally ordered this beer at a local burger joint. Wasn't expecting much, so when I tried it, I was very surprised. Really good. Not the best I've ever had, but VERY GOOD"
"Overall, this was enjoyable. I think this is more of an imperial stout with some slight barleywine characteristics."
"O: This was the first time I'd had this one from Dark Horse, and I'd drink it again no problem. I'm glad it's a year round so I don't have to wait to have another."
"O: Great weight, dryness, sweetness, coffee, cocoa... what's not to love?"
"overall, as mentioned this is a solid beer if far from trascendent beer. curious as to why it falls into the americans strong ale category - to me this is much more porter / stout territory."
"O- Very great strong ale. Perfect for the colder months. I'm diggin this."
"Pours a three finger brown head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Light coffee nose and flavor is roasted coffee and oak, some bitterness at finish. $2.95 for a 12 oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Overall pretty good, I'll drink this one a little cooler than I drink most, about 53 F. I'll buy this one again and try it outside in the sun. Its that light and refreshing."
"O: A tasty beer with a bit of uniqueness. Something here reminds me of a Sprecher's black beer. Will try again."
"Overall, a well made beer that is enjoyable to drink."
"I had expected a Belgian Dark Ale or some other weaker style from this but was pleasantly surprised. This is a super thick and flavorful beer. I was stunned with the smell, and then again with the flavor and loved both. One of the best beers I have discovered in a long time and very pleasant to drink."
"Overall this is a really solid brew. I don't know if I'd consider this a strong ale(almost reminds me of Stone's SSR), but I'll definitely be buying more of this."
"Overall: Loads of coffee flavors coming through. Will gladly drink the rest of the 6 pack!"
"Overall, an above-average beer, but I don't know where the ""reserve special"" in the name came from, since neither of those words seems quite appropriate."
"O: Overall, quite good. This is definitely going to go onto the buy again list. Everything works well here."
"overall - my first beer on my first stop at dark horse. very pleasant beer, big and flavorful."
"This beer pours a thick, dark, black with a thin bit of brown head. The smell is robust and roasty with hints of dark chocolate, reminds me of a campfire. The main flavors are dark roasted barley and a nice dark chocolate flavor. This beer is thin enough to sip easily, but robust enough to coat the mouth with a pleasant flavor that lingers nicely. This is a great beer, lots of strong flavor, but smooth as well."
"O- not much to complain about with this one. i wish my nose wasnt as stuffed. hope i did it justice"
"O - Not sure why this is an ""American Strong Ale"" it tastes like a damn fine stout to me. That being said, this beer is quite tasty. Rich, flavorful and a pleasing mouthfeel. The label on the bottle may look a little hokey, but the beer is very tasty. I'd buy more if I could."
"I really dig on this one! 7.5% ABV doesn't hurt, either. As they mention on the site, it's not quite a porter, not quite a stout, but golly is it good!"
"I like this. It drinks like a hoppy milk stout to me, and it has a ton of flavor. It's smooth and even at 7.5% it's extremely easy to drink. Very tasty stuff."
"Drunkability: I like.. yes i do."
"D- easy drinking beer That is only held back by how much you like the taste. I like it so its pretty good."
"I enjoy this. Very well made. Something I would recommend."
"Overall i expected something lighter, but i guess i overlooked the American Strong Ale descriptor. I dug this beer it's a bitter guy, almost a mix of a stout and a Cascadian Black Ale. A lot of the flavor is right up front and I'm a fan of the prolonged bitterness. This is a great beer to sit and watch a movie with it's gets better as it warms."
"D: THis is a really well done beer. I love the flavors and the body is perfect, however, with the strong bitter coffee flavor, I couldn't sit down and do a session with this beer due to the style. With the style in mind, this is a great offering and the first i've had from Dark Horse, i will search out more in the future!"
"Another solid beer from Dark Horse."
"This is one of the darkest beers I have ever seen. 'Black' indeed. It pours with a big head that is a medium brown, quite dark for foam. The taste is a nice balance of dark roasted malt and hops, with a nod to the malt. You could call this a stout and no one would question you. With the vigorous carbonation, the mouthfeel is quite good, and the overall package makes this very drinkable. I've only had this and Crooked Tree from Dark Horse, but I will be checking out some other brews."
"D. This is a great medium bodied feel beer that is smooth and very enjoyable to drink. This beer has a different taste than most stouts or porters, but it is a great taste that fans of stouts, porters and even IPA's should try."
"On tap at ChurchKey in Washington, DC. Poured into snifter glass. This beer was served in near room temperature which is the norm at ChurchKey. Pours an opaque black with a 2 finger brown head that fizzled pretty quickly and spotty lacing throughout the session. Nose is powdered cocoa, roasted malts, smoked barley and a touch of coffee. Taste is charred dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans and chalky cocoa with some bittering hops in the finish. Full creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation going on. I didn't know what to expect and this one surprised me. I understand this was the very first brew by Dark Horse so I was glad to have tried this one out!"
"super smooth mouthfeel thicker body, lower carbonation. very easy to drink, and it only gets better as it warms."
"Pours black as night without much of a head at all. You can smell some coffee, honey, and a bit of smoke. The taste is coffee and chocolate w/ a bit of burnt (good burnt, not bad). Mouthfeel is medium. A good amount of carbonation w/o being over the top. I'm used to beers this color being like syrup. Definitely not the case here. Overall, a great, drinkable beer. Whatever style it is, it's good. I'd put it in the porter or stout category, but it's irrelevant at the end of the day."
"D- I thought this was a porter initially but realized its an american strong ale when coming on BA. Good mouthfeel and taste to this, I'd certainly have again."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Overall: Enjoyable beer. Especially after letting it warm up a minute. I'll enjoy this one again."
"Pours dark brown/black with a thin brown coffee-colored head that dissipated fully. Aroma is a wonderful mix of dark fruit (plums/dates), sweet malt, roast coffee, molasses, and bitter dark chocolate. Tastes of coffee, bitter hops, dark chocolate, and a touch of sweetness. Finishes quite dry."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of guy in chicago!). Pours black with khaki head. Aroma of chocolate and berries and pine. Taste is roasty bitter to along with hop bitterness and a little bit of sweetness. Thin bodied with a creamy texture. Finish is bitter. I would like this more if it were hopped less."
"D - Man when I first got this I expected a Swartz maybe even a dunkel but got a really smooth drinkable strong ale. It may have been aged since it did have a solid ring of sediment in the bottom of the bottle but definitely improved the taste. Would go back to D's for another bottle or two, great beer!"
"D: The astringency kills the driknkability. The sweetness helps the beer, surprisingly. Neither I nor anyone at my table really loved this beer, and I am honestly somewhat surprised by its high rating on here."
"The palate opens rather stout like. In some ways, this reminds me of aged Expedition - and that's a good thing. With a blend of mild, pine-like hops, licorice and rather robust roasted malt flavor and bitterness, this does command your attention. Unsweetened chocolate/cocoa and a little caramel are present, but this isn't as complex as the nose might suggest. I don't really get much of the delicate brown sugar and vanilla that I pick up on the nose. Quite thick and chewy, this has quite a bit of licorice and anise on the finish, along with a moderate bitterness. The hops don't really linger here. Carbonation is a little higher than I'd like, but other than that, I have no complaints. The intensity does hurt the drinkability, but I am glad I got to try this, it is an interesting and unique schwarzbier - stout hybrid. Thanks again, Vince!"
"D: The style says American Strong Ale, tastes like a Porter or a Stout to me but whatever, it's different and kind of unique. I would say the roasted characteristics are a bit overboard but it's a good beer to say the least."
"D-my first beer from Dark Horse and it's pretty good. Nice rich roasted malts make for a good winter beer."
"I'm kind of confused what kind of beer this is. Stout? Porter? Black Ale? Either way, it's enjoyable. If you're into those styles, definitely check this one out. Dark Horse comes through!"
"Thick body but not gritty. Milky smooth. Medium amount carbonation that gives a slight tingle."
"Another Dark Horse well worth picking up."
"This is another great beer by Dark Horse Brewing company. If you like porters you will love this beer."
"12oz bottle from Wolverine Market in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours an opaque black with one finger of tan head and sheets of lacing on the pint glass. Smell is chocolate, roasted barley, vanilla, burnt grains, doughy cake batter, cream, baking sugar, faint woodiness. Taste is roasted and black malts, coffee grounds, bitter dark chocolate, floral and earthy hops, mildly astringent bitterness, touch of smoke, ashy, charred aftertaste with a little toast in there as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, average carbonation, silky creaminess mid-palate, ultra dry and chalky finish. Overall, this beer exemplifies the American Porter style very well, so I'm not sure why it's classified as an ASA on this site. Regardless, Reserve Special is a solid purchase if you can manage to find it."
"Would be seriously nice and comforting with a big, juicy roast from the crockpot or oven."
"Drinkability: would drink a couple more"
"Pours black with a small dark mocha head that leaves lacing. The smell is inviting, sweet and chocolate notes, along with a roasted malt. The taste starts malty with a tint of bitter and some alcohol, then moves to a nice chocolate sweet and finishes with a roasted malt. The roasted malt and some sweetness linger. The mouthfeel is nice, heavier then expected for a strong ale, but adds to beer. A nice drinker, great flavor, and definitely worth checking out."
"Same with the taste, very roasty and bready, nice. Toffee and caramel in small measures, a little more of the citrus-grass, not bad at all. The only detractor for me is the bitter aftertaste, to the point of being a little astringent. Thick body, rich flavors, a good American stout."
"-bye"
"A very enjoyable brew. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of hops in the taste considering they were nearly non-existent in the aroma. This will be something I will revisit."
"Drinkability - This was a brew I enjoyed from start to finish, well blended and balanced , deep rich flavors in every sip."
"I like this a lot and intend to buy more. It is unique."
"It's hard to believe that this beer is tagged as an American Strong Ale. It drinks like an American-style stout or even a Russian Imperial Stout, with a smoothness that belies its 7.5% ABV tag. It definitely isn't a session beer by most standards, but I found myself taking seconds (and thirds) with this delicious beer from Dark Horse."
"Drinkability is very good, I'm really enjoying this brew, and wish I'd brought back more then one. Big flavor, very smooth, satisfying and not to heavy."
"Someone please message me if you have any information that I do not that explains this beers identity crisis. Cheers!"
"Overall: This is a really good stout. The other dark horse beers in this series are somewhat lacking but this one is great. I really enjoyed this one and will drink it alot more then I have been."
"They should have a foot kicking the donkey on the label, since overall, this is another kick ass beer from Dark Horse Brewing."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that Dark Horse makes well. A different take on a Strong Ale that suits the style. The ABV is well hidden and this makes it a sixer style drinkable beer."
"D - too bitter for more than maybe two."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Color is near black with a light mocha head and not much lacing. Fairly short retention period. Nose brings some complex notes of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and hints of molasses. The taste is pretty dry with chocolate and roasted malt. Feel is really nice with a good dryness. Drinks quite well and is a nice take on this ""style."""
"This was an excellent beer, though it seemed more along the lines of a Stout than an Strong Ale. The flavor was very good, well balanced and complex. This was a very easy drinker for being a little heavy, I would definitely look for this again."
"Overall: I just can't get by the sourness of this beer after the swallow. It would seem to fit better with a Milk Stout. I would drink another one, but not two in one night."
"There is nothing really special about the beer, but it is a very solid porter."
"A black opaque color with a thin beige head forming on top that dissolves away rather quickly. Chocolate is the most striking scent in the aroma that is followed by dark sweet malt fragrance. That is followed by dark bread and the slight scent of dried fruit and coffee. The malt and chocolate hit the palate at the beginning of esch taste then a bitterness starts to grow. The bitterness has burnt grain and coffee, that lingers on the palate for some time. The taste finishes with a mild citric grapefruit flavor that fades rather quickly. A heavy water feel at the front, then it rolls to a medium bodied feel. The back of the palate finishes with a mild dryness. A surprisingly very dark, inviting, and drinkable beer. The look is dark and seductive, a striking aroma, and a hearty flavor. Then it finishes with with an even feel."
"Pours jet black with a chocolaty brown head. In the aroma, roasty coffee and a hint of caramel sweetness. In the taste, roasty coffee, and hints of chocolate and caramel, however not sweet. A small bitterness and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee aftertaste. Nice big flavor, not sweet or sticky. Big, but easy to drink."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is slight high but mouthfeel is rather creamy overall. Good drinkability. Very solid beer."
"Nice dark between black and red color. Smell of cold coffee Taste of coffee, but just a tad bitter. Not in a bad way though. Mouthful has a good feeling and drinkabitlty near excellent. At 7.5% cant drink a whole lot, definitely a good for a good occasion."
"not quite black IPA, not quite stout..."
"This pours a dark black with a tight little espresso crema-like head. The nose is roasty with some smoke notes. On the tongue, the smoke comes through very clearly. It's very dry, and very slightly bitter, with maybe a prune or some other dark fruit note. In the mouth, it feels pretty full but pointy to a degree. This is my second tonight and I could do another, so it drinks pretty easy."
"It has a very smooth flow, making it easy to sip or even quaff if your in the mood. The smoothness continues as you swish it in your mouth. Over all a very good beer, easy to drink, but not a beer I'd have regularly."
"Thoughts: I like DarkHorse, they def have some great talent for brewing. So far I have liked their IPA's better though."
"Unlike my counterpart TMoney, I found this to be accurate to what a black beer should taste like. The appearance was of a general darkness to which most light didn't escape, with a finger of foam affixed to the surface. For being the ABV and style that it is I was surprised it didn't pour as thick as initially expected. Never-the-less it was still nice. The smell was of dark things, specifically coffee and dark chocolate but I do believe that i detected a hint of what may have appeared to be orange zest floating around amongst the heavy aromas. The taste was quite a lot like coffee and dark chocolate the bitterness that would be expected with those two flavors comes right along with them. Overall, I do however enjoy the taste of this one and it warms you up a bit too. As i said previously I felt this would taste better if it was a little thicker, but it's not too bad. I could drink a couple of these but I wouldn't call it sessionable. Overall I recommend this beer, but I wouldn't overpay for it."
"VDubb86 was kind enough to save one of these bottles for me to sample upon my return from my East Coast/grad school year. It was enjoyed in his basement bar. It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a half-finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises light coffee, semi-diluted roasted malts, and dark chocolate. The taste holds notes of bitter coffee, bitter dark chocolate, dirt, and some shavings of charcoal. The body is decidedly medium, with a light moderate carbonation and sorta thick feel. I had had this beer before, on-tap at a local I-Talian restaurant, and wasn't too thrilled by it but wanted to give it another chance. This was it, and I am still not feeling this beer. The taste just seems off to me in a way I can't really pin down. It almost seems to want to be a couple different beers, but in the process of combining them loses the pizazz that would accompany each individual one. Something like that."
"D_Pretty heavy stout ale but I have no problem putting down a few."
"Fantastic! Every dark beer I've had from Dark Horse (and Crooked Tree) has been a winner."
"Drinkable. Maybe a bit sweet for a ""everyday"" but rewarding and not overbearing."
"D - Wouldn't have a problem drinking this one on a regular basis. Drinks like a regular stout with the profile of an imperial. An extremely easy drink at 7.5%."
"D - Pretty nice beer and the mouthfeel really helps drinkability on this one. I don't think it'd be a regular thing for me, but very much worth keeping in mind when you crave a dark brew that isn't too overpowering. Don't know why this isn't in the stout category."
"This beer is black. As I smelled the beer I get all those wonderful roasted malt aromas, chocolate, coffee, just nice earthy smells. It tastes, in my opinion, like a great stout. You get all the roasted tastes that the aroma gave. The mouthfeel is incredible, thick and creamy. I am so blown away by this beer. One million times better than I expected. I will absolutely have this again!"
"D: Pretty good. Not a pounder, but it won't weigh yo down"
"Overall this tasted different then i expected, the hopiness and bitter flavors tended to over shadow the roasted malls and also had a bitter aftertaste that didnt seem to want to leave. Glad i tried it, but i am not sure i would pick this up again, dark horse just has way too many other good beers for me to spend time drinking."
"Notes: Nicely complex and enjoyable brew but with an assertive coffee bean/citrus hop bitterness that was long lingering and can become overwhelming at times."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Very dark in color. Dark roasted coffee fresh out of the french press come to mind when I smell this. Smell is almost overwhelming. Smooth dark chocolate and coffee meld well into a mocha flavor. Very rich flavor, bold. Mouthfeel is slightly watery for the flavor. Drinkable nature is great. If there was an affordable quality I would add that I picked this bottle for $2."
"A really solid beer overall. Rich and intense for a porter if you want to classify it as such."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has a great mix of flavors going on that keep it interesting. It seems like it would fit into the Black IPA or Cascadian Dark Ale category, whatever it's called, very well. Very enjoyable overall."
"This is a nice beer, another candidate for extended cellaring."
"Has a luscious, smoky aroma with a strong undertone of caramel that demands at least a taste. It pours an opaque dark brown like dark chocolate with a thick, persistent, light tan head. Rich flavor is smoky with a nice bite to it and tones of caramel, molasses and roast coffee. Texture is smooth and pleasing, just a little fizzy."
"D- Interested brew for sure. Easy to drink and quite a bit of things going on here for sure. More Porter or Stout like I think."
"D: Above average drinkability and very palatable. I'll be sure to re-visit the Special Black Bier Ale from Dark Horse soon."
"Falling somewhere between a Stout and a Porter, this packed in all of the complex dark and roasty flavor that only a Dark Horse beer could. This one was under my radar for a bit but not any more. Good stuff."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is coffee.Taste is coffee,chocolate malts and sweet cream.Flavorful and smooth probably better suited for the winter months.I would recommend and will purchase again shortly!! Good job by Dark horse brewing."
"D - For just a couple of bucks per bottle, this is one attractive beer. Overall, pretty solid American strong ale."
"I know this is supposed to fall somewhere between porter and stout, and that is the mouthfeel. I want more body, but that is ok. Very drinkable. American Strong Ale? WTF!!!! That couldn't be more wrong. This is stout. Glad I got the chance to try this. Buy this if you are a stout lover."
"This is an excellent beer all around."
"M- Very very smooth feel. Its truely like silk."
"Big"
"drinkable, but the more of this i had the less i liked it. i know american strong ale is sort of a catch all style, but this has more in common with a german schwarzbier or american stout. i'd consider buying this again, but not til the cold winter months."
"Taste has a fairly good roasted malt taste, finishes with a strong coffee-like bitterness, the aftertaste is where it's at with this beer since the primary flavors are a bit one-note, carbonation is soft and works well."
"Lighter bodied than expected with a lot of dark roasted malts up front with hints of chocolate, burnt toast, coffee and oatmeal. Decently balanced by a sweet chocolate and molasses/honey flavor and some nice bitter, dry hops. Very dry finish. Complex but thinner than I expected or would have liked. Well balanced and drinkable."
"Overall I'm a little confused about the classification. As an American Strong Ale (7% ABV range like a LT Double Bag, not a chocolate/coffee bomb like He'Brew Jubilation) I think this is a little overdone. As a porter, however, props. In what way does it not fit the category?"
"I would definately search this out again."
"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my DT tulip. Poured one shade shy of black with a one inch, dense, mocha-colored head that gradually recedes into a thin, broken cap. Some strands and swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals malt and cocoa and the merest suggestion of dark fruit and perhaps a metallic quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, metallic quality is not present, but a roasty, coffee character comes out, as well as a hint of lactose and a light, hops bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel falls just shy of medium with a little creaminess upfront, followed by a lively carbonation level. Not sure why this is classified as an American Strong; it has American Double/Imperial Stout written all over it. This is a really tasty brew I have to say. Dark Horse does an exceptional job with its stouts (yep, that's how I'm classifying it) and this is another solid offering from this brewer."
"Pours with a slight head of dark brown which tends to then congregate around the glass walls, minimal lacing. Typical jet black liquid, fully opaque and impenetrable without a hint of color. The nose is all about heavily roasted coffee, chicory, malt, hard caramel candy, charcoal ash and tar, soy, at times it seems like citric or floral notes trying to get out but kept locked in the trunk, absolutely takes pains to make you notice it, might be able to benefit from some hoppy balance. Medium-bodied, the carbonation causes an intense swirling sensation through the mouth entry, quite dry and semi-rough in texture. The roast far and away the dominant factor, coffee, dark chocolate, chicory, bitters, soy, less earthy and perhaps more leafy with a hoppy bite. The white grapefruit displays spunk and maybe there's licorice as well. That said, the roast lingers much longer than any other component."
"Overall, looks, smells, and tastes like a strong stout or porter. A bit unbalanced, but quite flavorful and robust."
"Notes: This quite a unique tasting American Strong Ale. I definatly enjoy this beer. Cheers."
"Black ale it is."
"Pours super dark, just about a black, into a Great Divide goblet. Mocha head forms nicely into a small ring with some bubbles of lacing. Smells roasty. Coffee, bitter espresso, with hints of a vanilla milk chocolate. Notes of dark blackberries are there as well. Taste is delicious. Coffee stout-like, but with a nice complement of bitterness. It is smooth with a Heath Bar like flavor of toffee and caramel malts while the coffee lingers into a bitter, well-balanced state. Carbonation gives it a nice sting as it goes down too smoothly for its alcohol content. I'm glad Dark Horse is now in MA. Michigan is doing some good things with beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good- the abv is nearly imperceptible and goes down easily."
"EXCELLENT BEER FROM AN OUTSTANDING BREWERY. POURS A VERY DARK COLOR WITH NICE HEAD. STRONG ROAST MALT AROMA. EXCELLENT DRINKABILITY WITH A NICE KICK AFTERWARDS. ONE OF THESE AND YOU ARE SET FOR THE EVENING. ONE OF THE BEST STRONG ALES/ BLACK BEERS I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO DRINK. CHEERS"
"D - The flavors are so strong and complex that I don't see myself drinking more than one in one sitting. I'll definitely have this beer again but not until I can find it again."
"This is a sleeper in the American craft beer world. A delicious dark ale that is located somewhere between stout and porter. ""Strong ale"" is applied by the brewery, and by American and British standards this is accurate. But in Belgium, at 7.5% abv, this would be considered moderate. Nevertheless, a most enjoyable complex recipe. That is truly a joy to imbibe, from start to finish."
"Although I loved this beer, the style classification definitely threw me for a loop. By calling it a ""black bier," I was thinking that it was going to be a German-style schwarzbier. The BA label of ""American strong ale"" does not really define it well either. Personally, I would describe this beer as something between a foreign export stout and an imperial stout. In any case, it is quite an impressive offering."
"Interesting style, in-between a porter and a stout?"
"I chose this first this evening since I was saving stouts for later. So it threw me for a bit of a loop. I shouldn't blame the beer for that. Slow one to enjoy and it just bugs me that this is listed as a Strong. This is a pretty good Dry Stout, not loving it as a Strong ale the way I think of them."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable strong ale that hides the abv well. It tastes like a slightly more complex schwarzbier. I could have a couple of these to sip, but am not likely to go out of my way and order this."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes. I'll be buying more of this for sure. No doubt about it."
"In my opinion this is one of the most underrated beers on the shelfs of indiana beer stores. Pours black as black. I would say it resembles that of an american porter. Lots of coffee, dry bitter finish, with a medium hop profile. This is a very chewy, complex beer. Its very rich with deep notes of dark chocolate and a velvety texture. Great beer."
"Dry and extremely bitter from black patent malt. More burnt than most dry stouts. The aftertaste is of coffee grounds. The taste is chewy but the body is thin (for the style). The potency is hidden by the strength of the bitter dark malt. Overall, quite delicious."
"Overall, quite nice and enjoyable -- sort of a pocket imperial stout, trimmed down a bit."
"The taste is heavy on the roasted and black malts, with a choclatey sweetness underneath it all. At over 7% there isn't really any burn, but it definitely smacks of charcoal on the finish. It's pleasant for a while, but the acrid bitterness on the finish gets pretty old."
"american strong ale? i'd guess more like a porter. pours a viscous black, motor oil, with a khaki/cinnamon colored one finger head. it looks like it's going to stain my glass. awesome. smells robust, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, candied sugars. rich and complex. tastes chocolatey and velvety. bold flavor that is creamy and smooth. lingering bitters. this beer is just excellent. highly recommend."
"I'm definitely confused with the style however. This beer is clearly more like a dry stout, kind of like Obsidian stout by Deschutes but with more of a kick."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick and creamy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a bitter black malt scent with a bit of alcohol warmth. It has a tremendous roasted malt character with some mild chocolate malt notes. The taste is great! It has a bone dry, black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with tons of earthy coffee-like character. There is a bit of chocolate malt sweetness which does add some balance, but for the most part it's all black patent and roasted barley goodness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine black ale. I would love to see this fermented with lager yeast, but I'll take this version any day."
"I would definitely call this beer a Russian Imperial Stout, not anywhere like a Strong Ale. Not sure who gave it that label. It's a pretty nice beer too, lots of roast, chocolate, creamy, but just way too bitter and dry."
"This beer is a full bodied affair, very thick and syrupy and creamy. The beer has a very charred almost burnt molasses and dark malt flavor. There is some sweeter malts hidden deep underneath, but the charred, roasted, dark malts pretty much predominate. There is a slight ABV quality to the beer and there is some leafy hop in there on the back end. The aftertaste is very burnt wood taste on the tongue. I particularly like the sweetish, almost cherry chocolate flavors in the mid section of the beer, but they are way down below. The molasses and charred flavors, coupled with the leafy hop makes this a beer that is assertive. It's a decent beer for the right occasion. The aftertaste is probably the low point."
"O: A refreshing take on the Imperial Stout by Dark Horse."
"Pours a deep dark brown, near black... minimal head and lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malts, hints of chocolate, coffee, tar, whiffs of grassy hops. Very stout-like. Taste is of dark roasted, and sometimes burnt grains & beans - coffee, cocoa, nuts. Background holds some molasses like sweetness, dark fruits and a grassy hop prsence. Acidic and bitter at times, lacks in carbonation, dry and chalky finnish. Interesting beer that is halfway between a Stout and Schwarz, strong roasted grain profile, but bitter, lowly carbonated and dry finnish dont compliment the overall beer as well as it could have."
"Drinkability: Very nice - both very complex and easy to drink. BA and Dark Horse both claim this is not a Stout, but surely it is a Stout of some kind. It seems like a ramped-up, bitter and higher alcohol Cream Stout, with a strange dash of holiday spirit."
"OVERALL: A decent offering from Dark Horse; I quite enjoyed this one. The taste was quite nice and it went down pretty quickly, and with a thicker more robust mouth-feel, this beer might actually turn some heads. At the moment, however, it lacks the body to bring the flavor over the hump, and on the whole doesn't quite live up to its potential. Too bad really. This is one I'll have again, but I don't think I'll be in a rush."
"D: Very enjoyable beer! Looks, smells, and taste great perfect for a nice chilly evening, I'm just not sure if I would want multiple of these."
"D-i really like this beer! very tasty and awesome mouthfeel. it tastes more like an imperial porter but is just great!"
"This one crosses the line between porter and stout, a hybrid. Not sure why this beer is ranked as low as it is, it is fantastic. Bursting with flavor, many roasted notes but not burnt. Smooth, bitter, black and roasted. Graham cracker, chocolate, coffee, fudge and brown sugar all fight for dominance in an extremely well balanced beer. The best I've had from Dark Horse and a real treat. Creamy, silky feel, very mellow despite the big flavor. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyable with great flavors and a nice earthy warmth to it; I'm not really sure if would do well with age or not, but I'm willing to give it a shot and throw a few in the back of the closet and see how it does with some time on it."
"Don't drink and review."
"I quite enjoyed this beer, I wish I could easily get my hands on more."
"Mouthfeel is great as well. Crisp and creamy at the same time. Not too heavy. Very drinkable, one of my favorites from a great brewery."
"Beer has medium body and finishes with a strong avalanche of roasted malt / coffee flavor. It comes up so late that one might consider it an aftertaste. Second taste, roast is dominant over all other flavors. There is a growing bitterness that isn't from the roast though. Perhaps some hops trying to squeeze through, yelling ""Taste me! I'm here too!"" Drinkability is fine and the mouthfeel is fine. Probably not a repeat for me I do recommend it for people to try if they have the opportunity."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer. Well balanced, nice flavoring, goes down easy and worthy to have a few of."
"This beer pours like motor oil. There is a dark brown head that sticks around. The smell is of faint coffee and maybe some hershey's special dark. The taste is quite a bit lighter than the aroma, but very similiar. I have to say this stuff is more of an imperial stout than anything. It is nice and thick and well balanced, perfect for a cold afternoon. The finish is very clean and leaves me wanting more."
"T/MF: Taste is much like the aroma, bitter dark and dry chocolate, licorice toasted caramel with a dry, leafy hop bitterness interspersed in between everything."
"Pours thick, curtain of black. The beer itself actually sticks to the side of the glass like oil. Beautiful orange tan head. Heavy lacing. Smells of roasted barley, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee. Roasted malts exploding on the taste buds. Great mouthfeel. Dry and slightly sour. Medium low hoppiness. Creamy, smooth and delicious."
"Inky oily black, tan head looks a bit purple, it rose and fell leaving a wispy ring and some surface spritz. Smell of black licorice, toasty malt, tiramisu. Taste features big toasted chocolate and coffee malts, rich velvety mouthfeel. Medium body, a bit dense. There is a coffee bean astringency that detracts somewhat from the overall package but there is more than enough substantial flavour to carry it. Drinks more like a porter or a stout, not bad at all."
"Holy Exxon Valdez, Batman! This looked like an oil spill as I poured it into my glass. The two fingers' of head were about as deep brown as I have ever seen in a thick, foamy head. I have had coffee that was less dense and deep black than this beer. The nose was redolent with chocolate - fudge, brownies, dark chocolate bars. Wow! Mouthfeel was thick and full with a rich chocolate flavor accompanied by light smoke on the tongue. The finish was rich, chocolaty, somewhat more charcoal than in the mouth with a dusty dry finish. This would be better as a dessert beer, IMHO."
"I do not think thinks this is a real drinkable beer, to hoppy for the style. The finish could be a lot less bitter. The hops overpower the coffee, malt forward taste. I believe this is more of an American Stout than a Stong Ale."
"Overall a very solid offering, and one of my favorites from Dark Horse."
"Through six of these, I loved it at times and didn't at others. Good for what it is but too burnt and over the top for me. About average for the style."
"Overall I've been impressed with Dark Horse Brewing."
"The darker the better and one hell of a kick to the taste buds. Big, bold, complex and in-your-face. No need to debate on whether it is a Stout or Porter or even a double of the style, its good drinking. Enough said."
"Review from notes taken on: 11/2/09."
"An Ohoove special, this beauty shows a dark brown black with a fair light brown head and decent rings of lacing. The aroma is bitter coffee and nutty seaweed. The flavor brings a tart citrus hopped coffee malt. It's light to mid-bodied but thick in taste and smooth in feel. Quite drinkable if you like the style. Charcoal becomes much more evident after a few sips and I even pick up a peach hint. Generally tart and sharp. Good stuff."
"Notes: I really believe that this tasted like a stout (I did not have access to the internet during the review)."
"This brew pours an opaque jet black with great lace left from the thick dark tan head. The aroma is highly roasty, chocolate and moderate caramel sweetness. The flavor is highly roasty with moderate-high bitterness with a bittersweet finish. The body is full and chewy with moderate carbonation. Overall a very tasty beer with sharp bitterness enhanced by roasty malts. Worth a try."
"As the name suggests, this is black, motor oil looking with a mocha head. Not much retention and some minimal lacing. Burnt malt aroma, very stout like, caramel and molasses, mild chocolate, some bitterness in the finish. Thick and smooth body, mildly syrup like, adequate carbonation for the style. Flavor is roasted malt and barley heavy with some sweet molasses and chocolate flavors in the finish to balance out the burnt notes. Also an unexpected light hop bite in the finish. A very nice, big, but drinkable stout."
"Pretty easy drinking. Coffee lovers will love this one. Alcohol is well hidden. A nice coffee forward strong ale."
"Edit- Had a few bottles two months later and this stuff really went downhill taste wise. While i enjoyed this fresh, where it's at now is just plain wrong. It reminded me of stale coffee with old cream and some smoke with old licorice. I gotta dock some points."
"Drinkability: Very good. It's a little strong to be drinking a whole bunch, but certainly will be kept in mind."
"D - Would drink again if given the chance really nice."
"D - I didn't know what this was when I ordered it...but I was very impressed to the point that I wanted to order another one...a solid beer with both stout and porter characteristics"
"All in all a very nice ale."
"Otherwise, however, there isn't much to scoff at. I don't know why this is considered a ""reserve special"" when, in fact, I would consider it a great every day drinking dark beer. Porter or stout - it is a little of both but not exactly either - this is a deliciously quaffable beer that would likely work just as well before, during, or after a hearty dinner. Enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel is ok, but drinkable."
"D: Fast or slow, this should satisfy anyone looking for a decent strong ale that is balanced very well."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, but with a nice, light, creamy carbonation that's fantastic and really increases the drinkability for me. Nary a hint of alcohol, very nicely done."
"According to the bartender this is somewhere between a porter and a stout. Indeed it had many porter like characteristics with a definitely more assertive malt profile and a considerably stronger hop note. It was a black bodied beer with a tan head that left incredible lacing. That head lasted forever, also! The aroma was hoppy! The taste was of alcohol, followed by roastiness, and then malty sweetness. Then finally it finishes with a nice bitter roastiness. I really enjoyed this beer!"
"D: Very nice sipping beer and more than one wouldnt be tough"
"D: I was surprised to see this listed as a Strong Ale. For one, its just not that strong. Really more reminiscent of a porter or a stout. I will admit I was a more impressed with this one than I expected to be, but the tongue biting bitterness can be a little tiring. Still light enough to be able to drink easily."
"Drinkability overall is decent nothing I will be draining in number but definitely a nice complex dark ale that varies from the usual stout/porter/schwarzbier path but shares characteristics of each of those. Definitely a hybrid not sure how to label this Michigan brewed gem."
"D: I think an aficionado of the stout style -- not imperial stouts, but the ""regular old"" kind, would get a lot out of this one. Unfortunately, I didn't; I respect the craft here, but the flavor was kind of off-putting and unimpressive."
"D - Fantastic chocolate-forward beer that drinks like an Imperial Porter or even a Stout. This one packs a nice blast of coffee flavor and plenty of hop bitterness, too."
"HV"
"I sampled this beer the other day at a tasting and now I get an entire bottle to myself. Poured into my pint glass the beer is dark chocolate brown. It borders on black. A tiny wisp of head sit on top of my glass. I take a huge whiff and wow! This smells terrific. Coffee, chocolate caramel, vanilla and malt. It's a perfect storm of aromatics for me. They all seem to blend together so effortlessly. No one aroma takes center stage. I love it. The flavor is a touch less dramatic. Coffee is the main player with chocolate and malt taking supporting roles. Vanilla and caramel make small cameos in the scene as well. The mouthfeel is creamy and not to heavy. Full body with just a hint of carbonation. This is a very drinkable um... I don't really know what style this fits in. I just know it's a really good beer."
"A bit of a different animal here. I'm still not convinced that a Schwarzbier proportion isn't at work here- just at the scale, gravity, and hopping rates of an American Stout."
"If I were a smoker, I imagine I'd dig this beer, but this one just smoked me out and it killed the drinkability for me."
"Drinkability is very nice though one at a time serves it's purpose very well."
"Poured a nice oil slick dark with some light brown head the dissipated quickly. Smelled of chocolate and coffee and tasked it also. The mouthfeel was a little thin but overall it was a decent brew and pretty drinkable. I'd say it was a fair mix between a stout and a medium ale."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Absolutely sublime texture in the mouth... it's medium bodied with a richness matched by the beer's stunning palate. Powerfully robust, it's an easy drinker that demands respect and appreciation."
"The bite of the alcohol and richness of the malts make this a sipper. The beer is very smooth and has a nice soft bubble feel. It's definitely a great experience you can easily get lost in."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers where drinkability is a bit of a judgment call in that I don't want more than one tonight, but I like it and want more in the future. So I'll go with this being high in drinkability because I regretted seeing the end even if I don't want to open another right now."
"This beer pours a deep black, opaque with a nice dark mocha head. The aroma is mostly roast with a touch of malt fruitiness. There's just something missing for me. The flavor has a touch of chocolate but again is mostly a mild roasted maltiness. There are some hops in there providing an interesting bitterness. It's a clean stout that sticks to roastiness for its character. I wish there was a bit more of this character, but I'm just being picky. The mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is good."
"12oz. Literally pours black with no transparency. Nice foamy light brown head keeps a decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are good - roasted malts, coffee, chocolate with a hint of oatmeal (I'm not sure if any oatmeal was used in the brewing process, but the aroma was definitely reminiscent of an oatmeal stout). Tastes were of bitter roasted malts with notes of coffee and chocolate. Bitter roastiness really rides out all the way to the finish. Mouth-feel was smooth with plenty of carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this ale, but the style blurs the line as far as what to compare it to. It seems like a stout to me, but the brewer does call it a ""strong black ale"". Very good whatever it might be!"
"American strong ale my ass... No doubt about it, Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Bier is clearly a stout. It pours An opaque black with a thin tan head that settles to a thin film on the surface. There is little to no lacing on the glass, and carbonation is subtle. Aromas of this beer are intense, with roasty malt and coffee, with a hint of fresh potting soil. Flavors are similar to the nose, but much more prominent. The roasted malt gives the beer coffee notes along with bitter chocolate and hints of damp forest floor. It's exceptionally thick. You don't sip his beer. You chew this full-bodied beast. It's a very tasty beer, and I think it should be given credit for the style it truly is."
"This is a wonderful brew. Go Dark Horse!"
"D: It was good, not something I would particularly seek out, but a solid brew."
"D--This is a beer I would order if I was out for dinner, but it may be a tad too one-dimensional to get excited about"
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is an inch of tan foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, graham cracker, cream, hints of blueberry, and only a faint gesture of hops. It reminds me of Tres Blueberry Stout, but a lot lighter on the blueberries. The taste is considerably more hoppy than the aroma both in the mouth and in the finish. There is still a strong presence of the roasted malt and graham cracker, but they are firmly in the background. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer, but the style just isn't my thing. I'm eager to taste a beer that is traditionally malty that is successfully made hoppy. As is this beer has a very nice maltiness going on, but it is made into a mess by the hops. What is even more of a disappointment it that the malt is so easily visible, yet its goodness is completely unattainable due to the mess of hops."
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours blackish with brown highlights and a dark tan head. Aroma is straightforward milk and dark chocolates, with maybe a lactose note. Super roasty flavor with black, roasted, burnt barley notes and an even bitterness. Dry, maybe a bit astringent. Still pretty good."
"(D)- This is a sipper for sure. Super rich and thick. It reminds me more of a RIS more than an American Strong Ale, but its still an enjoyable beer for sure."
"This is a pretty solid brew. I actually got quite a bit of hop flavoring in this beer which is nice. However, it is kind of chalky and has somewhat flat carbonation levels which do detract from the overall enjoyment. I would definetly buy it again."
"Eric"
"D - While it's a good beer, it lends itself to the sipping type. This beer is not all that drinkable at all, but it I wouldn't say it reflects negatively on all the other aspects at all."
"This is another beer that falls into the not good, not bad category. It has elements of both a strong ale and a stout and there are better beers available in both of those categories."
"No denying that it's a good one. It's style agnostic...torn between an SDA and a Schwarzbier. But it's one of the best tweeners you'll come upon in a while. Dark Horse, Short's...all those hole-in-the-wall Michigan outfits are pumping out quality product at a rate that GM and Chrysler would be proud to grovel in."
"Not bad, definitely would reach for others too though."
"Poured a beautiful silky black with rather modest head. The head is dark-brown, like the ""crema"" on the espresso. Has an oily look and dissipates within a minute to a thin film. Chocolate notes on the palate. Rather light formation of Belgian lace. Nice lingering. Medium body. Not as dense as the color and pour suggested. Subdued roasted notes. Hints of coffee. Some bitter hops. I like it, but am not overly impressed. I expected more ale yeast character. While I will not seek it out, it is better than a great many beers."
"D: Very nice over all. Though I think there are better example of the style... Still very good, and well worth a try."
"D= A beer worth trying for sure, but ultimately this one just didn't gel for me. Too many different things going on without anything to pull it all together."
"D - this beer has a good ABV. The drinkability is good. I like the finish, and it makes you want more. Good drinkability in this beer."
"D- Fairly high, I love this style and will definitely continue to drink"
"Overall, it is tastey but there are many better stouts, porters, and strong ales out there."
"Seems a bit thin in the mouth but decent carbonation. Not a bad beer at all."
"Another very good beer from the Dark Horse stable."
"Really nice stuff."
"Pours a dark black color like motor oil. Light brown or tan head that barely covers the surface and is slowly breaking down. Mild coffee and malt nose. A little bit of moist dough perhaps. Gentle coffee attack that carries through a mostly malty flavor and ends with a smoky finish. Thick mouthfeel. Slight touch of hops. An excellent robust beer as no one component really overpowers you, but you still know its a big beer. A little bit bitter or sour at the finish. Lots of smoke in the aftertaste."
"Pours incredibly black. Black as an RIS. Nice, full brown head. Smells like a porter on steroids. Lots of coffee and chocolate and some burnt malts. Taste is similar. Nice, roasted malt flavor that kicks up a notch as it warms. Very tasty! Taste of a very good imperial porter- think coffee and chocolate with a little alcohol burn with a more creamy mouthfeel- almost imperial stoutish. Very good beer. Another winner from DH."
"I'm not certain my sample wasn't bad. It was shipped laying on its side, and when I cracked it open there was a trail of something that had situated itself on the side of the bottle. Stayed there after I poured it too and I couldn't get the sediment out even after rinsing the bottle multiple times."
"Bought it as a single bottle on the way home tonight. Had no idea what to expect but a dark beer as the label pointed out. Formed a monster head right out of the bottle and was nice and dark definite dark black in color. Very Very hoppy, nice. It was so dark and tasty I was very suprised and I instantly just wanted six more of these in my fridge, but sadly I'll have to wait...until tomorrow. Very smooth Its medium bitter and has a nice dry, hoppy aftertaste, if you haven't checked it out its worth it. I know I should have a long time ago."
"D: This one drinks like a stout. It is a bit of a sipper for me."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and also a little bit of a sweet, fruity aroma (reminds me of a peach, but I'm not sure exactly what kind of fruit it smells like). The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, coffee, and chocolate. There's also a nice lingering roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I'm glad I picked up a six pack of this, it's a pretty good beer. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Overall, I was really impressed with the smell. It was pretty easy to drink and I highly recommend."
"Pretty easy to drink. This is a very tasty beer."
"M & D - Thick and viscous mouthfeel that leaves a bitter aftertaste. This certainly isn't a session brew in my opinion...more like a second meal. I agree with other reviews I've read that this is more of a Stout than an American Strong Ale. Overall, not a bad brew."
"D: Black Bier in name only. Drinks like a stout and fills you up like one too. A very sneaky 7.5% abv."
"An American strong ale that wants to be a stout. Interesting. A must try if you get the chance."
"I'm in love with this style of beer. This particular selection pours black. Black like molasses with a remarkably dark tan (a little thin) head that was gone too quickly. The smell is chocolate and fruit. The taste was nice dark chocolate and coffee, really smooth. A little dry at the end, but it lends itself to the dark chocolate flavor. Overall, a great beer, I will be drinking the other 4 (my wife got one). Probably soon."
"D-Medium-low drinkability. A good brew, but it seems lost in itself at times."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly strange beer, but a very good one. A high abv% schwartzbier, essentially, not quite a stout or a porter, but both very dark and still very light. The fruity notes are a nice touch, complimenting the epic quantiy of toasted malts in this one. Just very nice."
"Good stuff!"
"overall: very deliciois and easily drinkable good carbonation. leaves a strong aftertaste"
"D - This is very stout-like. Bitter malts and dark. 7.5% is well hidden."
"There's no doubt about it. This is a stout. And a pretty good one at that. There's enough roastiness to go around without all the bitter astringency. Very nice brew. Will drink again."
"Very pleasing brew"
"Dark Horse makes kick ass stouts. I'm really impressed with what I've had thus far and am eager to move on to the others. The only noteable flaw here is the mouthfeel. It's too thin. More thickness would go a long way. But, this is a very, very good beer despite that small flaw."
"D - extremely easy to drink."
"Nice smooth finish on the palate and no aftertaste. No ABV listed on bottle, so I guessed it at 6% - I was surprised to see it at %7.5."
"Black pour with a serious fluffy brown head. A hoppy,bitter aroma. Flavor is of chocolate,and coffee as promised,but not bitter at all, a nice smooth easy drinker. Nice body,nice mouthfeel. I drank the whole growler myself it was awesome and very drinkable.Thank you Dark Horse"
"I will definitely be picking up more of these wonderful beers!!!"
"Great stout, definitely a wolf in sheep's clothing, and one to keep your eyes out for."
"D-Hard to drink a whole lot. The taste is very strong and the beer is pretty alcoholic."
"For such a dark big flavored beer the mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. I would have hoped for something more commanding."
"The quaffability of the brew is enhanced by a light-medium body with mild carbonation, and the bitterness smoldering in the aftertaste begs for another quenching sip. An excellent brew. Thanks to Dr. Brad for the bottle!"
"A surprise heavier than I expected. A decent beer more of a stout than anything. Worth a try."
"dark ebony brew with a nice stout quality. quite thick. not as strong but richly backed alcohol. nice chocolate in a good bottle. alcohol gives it a cherry hint on the palate. soft coffee. great malt. warm going down with a light smokey dessert like quality. light woodiness. not the most consistent... excellent a little below cellar temperature. somewhere between american double and goose island bourbon county. candy fruit rummy... yet light, when it shines. will have again."
"Drinkability: Overall not necessarily a bad beer, but it lacks complexity and could use a little more balance."
"Near black pour, healthy brown head, slight ruby around the edge. Very roasty aroma. Tastes roasted malt, burnt malt, oat, bakers chocolate, some smokiness. A pleasant amount of carbonation. Just a slight amount of hop and coffee bitterness in the finish. Almost as much coffee in this to me as the Beer Geek Breakfast stout. Very good and to the point of what a good porter should be."
"A good beer but it did not live up to my expectations. The flavor just has too much of a burnt taste to warrant continued consumption. The high ABV limits it as well."
"3.6/5"
"Very delicious brew, definatly a stout in my mind."
"D Very approachable ale with some interesting and fairly intense flavors."
"D- Very drinkable, a nice ale."
"Not a bad drinker, but the ABV is pretty ubiquitous & got to me very quickly"
"Nearly black in color with a thin tan head that falls pretty quickly. Smell is mainly sweet up front along with a bit of roast and hop bitterness. Molasses, some dark fruit, almost milk chocolate. Decent sized roast character. Kind of husky and grainy with a light nutty scent. Taste is much of the same. A bit all over the place but when together, it is nice. More of a roast presence than sweetness in flavor. Definitely a hop presence that doesn't work so well with the rest of the brew. This seems like a Schwarzbier/Stout hybrid with a hop presence that is a little over the top. Mouthfeel is actually nice. Creamy and the hop presence doesn't create a huge bitterness. Actually seems like a Schwarzbier type feel but a little bigger. A little smoky in the finish along with roast. Not overly bitter, again. Overall, fairly drinkable but not the most exciting brew in the world. It's interesting but still not completely convincing. Somewhat boozy, which hurts this one. Maybe a bit less hoppy goodness and tune up on the stoutage...I think it could be great."
"Bottom line: This is my second Dark Horse brew I've gotten in a trade with Joe and I really like what this brewery is putting out there and apparently, a lot of other BAs do too. Way to go!!"
"Regardless if I don't agree with the style, very enjoyable brew."
"Not entirely complex or over the top, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent beer. The style is up in the air, but the flavor was nailed down very nicely, I would have no issue at all with trying this one any day. A solid beer for sure and something they can be proud of."
"Wouldn't have picked this up myself if I saw it, but thanks to lightindarkness for sending it to me. I definately enjoyed it, and would drink another on a cold snowy day or with a meal."
"poured from a bottle into a pint glass. pours jet black. i was not expecting this beer to be this dark for some reason. poured with no head what so ever. smell is roasted malts. taste is light up front with a roasted finish. although no carbonation seemed to be present at the pour, there is a subtle bit in the mouth and its pretty prefect. this beer caught me off guard and i am glad it did, sucks i only have one."
"The aroma is rich with smokey chocolate, reminds me of Old Rasputin, and I could smell it the second I opened the bottle. The flavor is full of dark chocolate with a hint of sweet cherry and bitter grapefruit. The body is a medium thickness but still very drinkable. This is a damn tasty beer, especially for chocolate lovers."
"Dark Horse also now available in the STL area - life is beer good!"
"Pours a solid ebony colour with slight tan head and reasonable lacing. Nose- chocolate milk powder and roasted nuts. Taste- dark fruits, chocolate, touch of lactic sourness and a little smokiness. Medium bodied with a vigorous carbonation. Finishes dry."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, if you're a fan of the darker and maltier beers than this is a good one for you, it's definitely worth drinking a few of if you're the mood for that type of beer."
"drinkability is good. for a brew this rich and complex, the body and finish are not typical, in that they resemble a lighter and more drinkable brew. almost like a super-rich porter, this brew is a solid example of whatever style it has been slotted into. cheers!"
"I saw a bottle of this sitting by itself in the liquor store so I picked it up and damn I am impressed. This ""Black Bier"" is obviously supposed to be a stout I assume. Really nice flavors though."
"Tasting like something between a big Imperial Porter and a small Imperial Stout."
"D- if i had a blind taste test id swear this is a stout. its something i could drink a few of in a night, but not one ill always have on hand"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark coffee color with minimal head, and then the carbonation erupts after the pour into a milk chocolate head that leaves lots of lacing. The smell is full of chocolate, coffee, and even some of the alcohol. There is a slight burnt note in the nose as well. The flavor is excellent. Strong malt flavor, deep roasted taste with a heavy burnt backdrop and some alcohol in the finish. The carbonation is light with a medium syrup body. This is a solid beer and I will enjoy more to come."
"Pours black in color, sludgy out of the bottle, nice big cocoa-colored head fades down to a thin layer on top of the beer, excellent lacing. Smell is incredible...milk chocolate, molasses, plenty of coffee, slightly doughy. Now this is effing delicious! Taste is bitter coffee, plenty of chocolate, a faint smokiness, slightly burnt around the edges....wow. Mouthfeel is really interesting....feels more like a porter, tastes more like a stout. Great lingering bitterness, perfect coffee aftertaste. This is one of the more enjoyable beers I've had in a long time. Excellent brew!"
"Even an aggressive pour produced only a thin tan head that quickly receded to just a slight ring around the top of this black opaque beer. Smell is toffee and roasted malt with a noticeable fruity sweetness that seems somewhat out of place. Taste follows but without the fruitiness. Very nice dark chocolate with some hop bitterness. Finish lasts a good long time and maintains that bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, but a little soft on the carbonation. Drinkable. Nice."
"Huge thanks yet once more to RblWthACoz for this surprise ""extra"" to what was already an unexpected beer drop. I do so enjoy being surprised with beer, and in this case, surprised by a beer."
"D - Tastes, smells, feels, and looks like a stout, so why not call it one? A bit too roasted for my tastes, and kind of cloying in the finish. Not my favorite stout nor my favorite Dark Horse offering."
"D: Smooth, but intense. Quite drinkable."
"This was my first beer last night @ the crawfish boil, I had low expectations from what locals told me about the brewery but damn they were wrong this was an incredibly well crafted beer. It poured black with a tan head. The smell was of toasted malts and caramel. I was very delighted with the flavor certainly alot of caramel flavors in it. This is a very smooth drinking beer for a dark beer and it felt just wonderful in my mouth :) Thanks for a great brew!"
"this beer was super easy to drink. i recommend seeking it out if only for the smell."
"D - If you like coffee, very."
"I'll definitely recommend this to others and try to get my hands on another the next time that I see it. It reminds me of a couple of Foudners beers and that's always nice for me."
"one of my favorite dark horse offerings :D"
"D: I really like this beer and would compare it to a decent RIS or porter. Nice and roasty!"
"Overall, decent. I'd be up for trying another bottle to see if it is any better."
"Yet the heavy, malty texture makes up for a lot, coating the tongue not unlike a good, densely-hopped IPA does. Smooth and rich, the mouthfeel is quite good. One of the more distinct beers I've had, rich and bold. Well worth trying."
"D: I could probably go through a 6-pack of these if you left it in front of me. This is a delicious brew that I'd easily mistake for an double/imperial stout. Awesome flavors, Awesome mouth-feel. They should just call this a double stout and be done with it. Either way, I'm off to find me some more. This would be a staple in my fridge if I had easy access to it..."
"Tastes like a stout to me. Rich and creamy with an assertive charcoal roasted malt middle. Fresh ground coffee wth a hint of vanilla and caramel. Almost espresso in the finish with currant and raisin."
"Low to moderate carbonation, pretty substantial, full, rich mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable, if you're a coffee-lover."
"Drinkability - call it a porter or a stout or an old ale if you like, but you'll likely call it tasty as well. Good one for cold weather, with a bowl of chili."
"Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head that really sticks around. This is a beautiful beer. I mean, it's just amazing to look at. The nose is a very nice amount of coffee. I could look and smell this beer all night. But that's not what we're here for damnit! Wow. Flavor is pretty smoked (but not in the realm of a thick ol' rauch). Nice. Very full and robust. There is a sweet edge to this, but not in the way of a milk stout. It is almost like a natural sweetness. It just happens to be there it seems. Man. This is amazing stuff. I thought that perhaps the cask version of it might have kicked it up quite a bit, but the bottle version is really bringing the love too. This is an absolutely amazing beer to be shared with people who care. Thank you Fairy Beer Mother. Thank you."
"Pours a black color, some carbonation, nice little creamy dark tan head, very minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, good tones of toffee/chocolate/coffee/caramel, slight vanillaness. The taste is slightly sweet, big malts, and dark chocolates. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, more of a stout than a ASA."
"Jet black with a nice and creamy deep tan cap. Chocolatey and roasted smelling with coffee beans and light fruity plum. Full bodied with a creamy-smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is roasted, dry, and bitter. Deep and flavorfully bitter chocolate, darkly roasted malts, and coffee. Perhaps a light amount of fruitiness as it warms. Nice strong schwarzbier that can spit in the face of most imperial stouts."
"Wow! Killer! Great rocky, textured, foamy tan head with lots of lace. Opaque black color. Deep roasty malty aroma with the traditional aromas associated with that. Just a little dark fruit in the tast. Great body and smooth long finish. Close to being a session beer but not quite. A masterwork!."
"D: Very refreshing despite >7% abv."
"Taste offers redolent burnt/roasted malts, some caramel backing, and strong coffee and chocolate notes. Really seems more like a stout than strong ale, but regardless, nicely done. I could use a bit more complexity, as the ""roastedness"" gets a bit overwhelming after a while."
"Pours a syrupy black with a very dark tan head with nice retention...beautiful. Smells of caramel and chocolate, I can smell a little hops, and some nice earthiness as well. Wow, the taste is dark molasses, coffee, bittersweet chocolate. Really thick but some nice carbonation as well, leaves the mouth coated, but has a dryness too. Hops come out late in the profile, not as much as, say, darkness, but a very nice addition. Some fruity undertones as well, complex and super roasty. I wasn't sure what to expect as I haven't had anything from this brewery yet, but I was quite impressed. The fact that they make this beer year round is fantastic as well."
"A solid brew from a solid crew. Definitely a repeat buy."
"Pours big and black with a smallish tan head. Smell is dark and roasty with a big smoky tone to it. Although the flavor of dark smoky roastiness was nice, it was a bit thinner bodied than expected, overall. Didn't get any coffee flavors in this. Would definitely like to try again and a nicely made beer. Thanks Chris!"
"I feel like I've been overly negative, hence this afterword. I've more or less rated this an Imperial Stout (or Double Stout), as that is what I feel it most resembles. It's enjoyable, no doubt (especially at its price point), but lacking compared to the competition. To me, this is quite reminiscent of Old Rasputin....something that I know isn't best-in-class (in my world), but I buy periodically since the price is attractive. Yet every time I still feel a little bit cheated. At the end of the day, it's good to have around."
"Didn't know what to expect from this one. Initially thought it would be a schwartzbier. Pours an almost black body with a small cocoa head that has some garnet hues. Some nice sheet lacing. Looks like a stout. Aroma of burnt dark malt, chocolate, and red apples. Medium body has a subdued carbonation. Taste has a biter bite from both hops and dark roasted malts. A red apple fruitiness softens the edges quite a bit. A very interesting brew here. More like a stout than anything else."
"D_The smoke can get to be a bit much but there is a a lot to like here. I am enjoying this though that aftertaste can be a bit of a hurdle."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into New Belgium snifter. Poured a midnight black color with mocha tan head. Smell is mixture of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Taste is burnt flavors of malt and coffee with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is full body with a low level of carbonation that helps maintain its creamy feel. A great drinking beer with a huge body and bold flavors."
"Drinkability: Very nice. Packed with flavor, but relatively light enough to pound down a few of these, even at 7:00AM in the morning."
"D-This brewery almost always delivers. Nice crisp stout that any stout fan would enjoy."
"D - Nice drinkable brew, doesn't overpower and has a nice roasty-ness about it."
"This was a great beer. Glad I got the opportunity to give this one a whirl. Full bodied, terrific carbonation, smooth, slightly dry in the finish as well. Certainly worth the effort to get this one!"
"Very, very dark brown with a thin tan cap of fine bubbles. Good head retention with spotty lacing. The aroma was full of toffee, roast, milk chocolate with some sour cherry and caramel notes. Leafy hop bitterness that started strong and grew into the finish. Caramel sweetness up front, followed by mild roast and semisweet chocolate, then dry cocoa towards the end followed by lingering cherry. Medium to full bodied with very low carbonation, a little heavy. Good stuff and an easy drinking bigger beer. Unfortunately, the carbonation was just a little too low and didn't do the beer justice."
"A well crafted stout. The nose was underwhelming, but the flavor is big but balanced. Bitterness complemented with sweetness, and no off flavors here. An easy drinker for the high ABV."
"This one doesnt seem balanced enough for me for some reason, too much bitterness in the finish for me, not enough balance. One of these is enough, but worth trying. not my thing"
"D - I think for the style, this is an extremely drinkable beer. It possesses all of the imperial stout character without being unnecessarily heavy or daunting."
"The taste, however, is not shy. With a fine carbonation and coating texture, the bitterness sinks into the tongue, roasted, toasted and burnt to a crisp malts, anise, molasses, maybe some coffee and a woody something. The burp tastes pretty good too:) The body, however, looses some strength, feeling a bit thinner later. One thing I must say, I don't know how accurate these classifications of stout/double stout/impy/whatever, but this beer is called a black bier by its maker, and it tastes just like that... black, dark, mean, with no redeeming qualities. Tasty."
"Heavy body and thick smooth mouthfeel. Medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out. One-dimensional and lacking in balance."
"Thanks to Pegasus for sharing a bottle."
"D: A big, tasty stout, one of the best of the lot I've enjoyed and my first from Dark Horse. Huge chocolate and coffee bittering will make this memorable; it's one I must have again somewhere down the road. Like BuckeyeNation wrote below, I also thought this was a schwarzbier, so the imperial stout-goodness was a pleasant surprise. Thanks again, Derek, for sending..."
"I've been looking for this beer for some time now (Thanks Talisker). Maybe it was the goofy cartoon donkey on the label, maybe it was the proven 'stout excellence' of the brewmasters at Dark Horse, who knows? All you need to know is that Reserve Special Black Bier is a lip smackingly good, stout lover's stout."
"Drinkability: I'd have another, but don't know how many I could have in a night. Great for havin' with some fellow beer nerds."
"Pretty good, I will definitly be looking for more of this."
"Very dark brown in pour with a quarter inch thick light brown head that dissapates quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and cocoa chocolate. Roasted coffee flavor with a slightly bitter finish also a hint of chocolate present but not as much as was in the aroma."
"Creamy and thick on the palate but lightens up to a relatively cleaner finish. Low to moderate carbonation. Well balanced and complex. I absolutely love this place."
"Another high quality brew from Dark Horse. I've sampled three or four of their offerings (all being darker, heavier styles) and everyone was excellent. I said it before and I'll say it again to the brewers at Dark Horse...Please find a distrubutor in Chicagoland."
"Overall- This is a good representation of the style. I could see drinking this as a nightcap/winter-warmer throughout the cooler months."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Seems to have low ABV and is not as heavy as many stouts, could use a more complex taste though. I could have several of these in a night, which gives it a good score here. Decent stout overall, not great, but good."
"Served a a deep brown with a dark tan head. The head was 1/4 inch tall when they brought it to me and it quickly fell to a ring around the perimeter. When I smelled it I knew it was either a baltic porter or a big stout. Chocolate malt, roasted and burnt, slight flavoring hops poking through, and carbon. The taste was big, bold, burnt at first then regressing to more of a nutty flavor. Bitter hops right at the end dry it out for the next sip. The mouthfeel is dry, chewy, and bitter. The drinkability is good for the style."
"Perfect black beer, with no highlights at all. Big three fingers of reddish tan frothy head that leaves excellent lacing all the way down. Nose is really strong on dried fruit, prunes, and some light roasted malt and spices. Taste is likewise. Spice up front, then strong dried fruit. A ton of roasted malt shows up later on in the flavor. Very tasty beer, although perhaps not the most complex. Creamy, full bodied, with solid carbonation. Liked this one a lot. The big flavor totally covers the alcohol, although these'll catch up with you if you don't pay attention."
"This is likely one of the best of the style that I have ever had. The beer is pitch black with a decent tan head. Some lacing but not too much. The smell is oatmeal,chocolate and some coffee. The same things show up in the taste. The beer is very smooth for the style. The abv does not show. Drinkability is high, maybe a little too high as this beer is good enough that it could pose some problems near the end of the sixer."
"This beer pours a shiny black color with a thin light beige head that turns wispy quickly. Very little lacing apparent. Roasted malt and caramel aroma. Medium-bodied and smooth with a pleasant roasted character. Coffee, malt and hops flavors make this one enjoyable. The finish is hoppy and leaves a charred wood aftertaste. One of the better Porters I have tasted in awhile."
"D- This was wonderful and I will definitely be enjoying this on a regular basis (less than $10 a 6-pack...). Highly recommended."
"Thank goodness I bought a sixer, but this beer is worthy of a case purchase."
"Very nice and unusual dry double American stout."
"D: Not bad, but wouldn't be my first choice of the black ales I've had."
"Overall, this is a very interesting and wonderful beer. It's kind of potent, so I don't think I'd have too many of them in one session, but it's definitely worth picking up more. (I got this one in a mixed 6er.)"
"Update April 9th, 2008: Well I didn't wait 2 years, but this bottle is now about 1 year and 3 months old. Aroma is still amazing. There's a lactic sourness I didn't notice before, and the up-front bitterness has had it's edge taken off by a milk chocolate sweetness in the background. I'd bet that that sweetness would develop further if I'd let the bottle sit a little longer. I like the balance and the interplay here. Still smoky and very bitter and roasted, but just a hint of molasses and chocolate taking the edge off. Much less one dimensional than even 8 months ago. This is a tasty brew and balls out."
"D- pretty solid, im in a definite mood for stouts, and this is perfect"
"The lower ABV, and balanced hops and heavy mouthfeel, without ridiculous maltiness, make this more drinkable than many double American stouts. The counterpart to DIPAs and the other end of the color and richness scale. Highly recommended."
"Light feeling as it first hits the tongue, it picks up a medium fullness to it as it moves across the tongue. The finish is marred by an astringent, sharp, almost harsh burnt bitter note, that is thankfully not too overwhelming. Notes of bitter, French Roast, black coffee, darkly toasted bread, a burnt acidity, and a acrid char flavor. This beer has a ton of darkly roasted grain character, it is actually a bit much, but on the upside I think that it is helping to hide some off flavors that are derived from a bit of diacetyl and perhaps some vegetal notes. In the end the dark malt is just a bit too much, if the gravity was bumped up a bit it might be more in balance."
"Pours a tar like color, no light is comin' through this one. Two finger dark khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a very nice lacing. Stickiness is amazing. Smell is of dark chocolate with roasted nutty malt that overpowers the nose. Taste is of strong espresso and black coffee with a nice hop bite that quickly moves in, quite a surprise. Aftertaste is somewhat bready with more of that black coffee flavoring. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very right and flavorful. I really enjoy this brew, but one is good enough for me. Definitely look forward to more beers from Dark Horse."
"drinkability - Nice stout, nice sipper for me."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,poured a near jet black but there was a noticable crimson hue when held up to the light a thinner quick to faid almond colored head atop.Aromas were roasted and sweet with notes of molasses and French Roast coffee and bitter chocolate no hop presence to this one.Big and sweet up front with some molasses and dark fruit notes very roasty with just a hint of earth in the finish wich doesnt dry it out much.Its a big hearty beer sweet and it packs a punch"
"D - This is a pretty good stout. It is my first Dark Horse beer and I would love to find more."
"Medium feeling that leaves a little alcohol and less carbonation. Beer seems to remind me of the breakfast stout in the first impression, but that comparisson quickly fades away as the beer does not stay on the same level throughout the beer."
"Smooth and creamy, this is some delectable stuff. The abv is never harsh, but a buzz is felt by the end of the glass. Don't let this donkey kick your ass..."
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a pitch-black color beer with a medium foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of medium coffee with light roasted malt. Taste is dominated by some medium dry coffee with some light roasted malt and some nice oatmeal notes. Body is quite creamy which I always enjoy as well as being full with some medium to low carbonation. Well done and something I wouldnt mind having again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The one weak spot in this beer is the body. The body is a bit thinner than I prefer. The body nearly approaches medium. The carbonation is low but not problematic. The flavors are long lasting. The beer provided a very pleasant beer drinking experience and I will have this one again."
"This is pretty damn drinkable to have this strong of a flavor, but I like my stouts like this and not overloaded with sweet flavors. Overall its very simple with dark toasted flavors, but just good. Good stuff...a must try."
"Cheers!"
"D: Fantastic, roasty flavors as well as the sneaky undercurrent of dark fruit and molassas. A very rewarding treat!"
"Drinkability: A really special beer that I have enjoyed again and again"
"Taste is rich milk chocolate with hints of coffee. Body is a bit thinner than I'd like but it's still shockingly smooth. Yes sir, I reckon I'd buy this again if I could."
"D - I'm finding it difficult to make my way to the bottom of the glass. This beer is trying to grow on me, and partially succeeds as it warms up a little. A sipper more by force and not by choice."
"Pours a very opaque black, very dark, thick brown head forms, nice lacing, good retention, sticky, looks pretty awesome. Smell is very roasty, some chocolate and coffee, vanilla, bit of toffee, quite rich, very astringent even in the aroma. Taste is ashy smoke, chocolate, roast, dark fruits, very astringent and bitter from all the roasted malts, medicinal finish. Mouthfeel is kind of thin and oily, medium carbonation, much to astringent, but has some nice characters. Thanks Russ!"
"4's across the board for this above average stout. It sits heavily in a pint glass, deep black with a bit of a brown head and good lacing. Nose is lots of roasted malts and some smokiness. Taste is roasted malts in good amounts, tiny hints of alcohol, and sweetness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. Nice job, Dark Horse."
"Drinkability: A very flavorful and full body drink. Good for sipping on a cold winter's night."
"Overall a tremendous brew from Dark Horse. If you're in the mood for a kick-in-the-ass double stout, this is a worthy opponent."
"A very nice beer!"
"A very good offering from Dark Horse and I'll seek out more of their beers. If you see this beer, definitely pick it up."
"Amber brown pour and a bit hazy. Very sweet palate with a bit citrus and malt. Goes down easy with little carbonation as hoppy as I would expect from a double but enjoyable. The beer is a above average to very good India Pale Ale in the American style. Laet the beer stand a bit if to cold as it comprimizes the delevery of this beer."
"Great bottle."
"drinkability is ok. the strong roast and astringency takes away from this one a bit, but it's still nice. a little warm on the way down. might be better with some time to mellow."
"Dark brown to black with a finger of dense, clingy, light tan head. Nose of rich roasted malt, scorched candy sugar, molasses, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Very aromatic and deliciously complex. Roasted, smoked malt up front. Quickly turns to sweetish milk chocolate and sugary dark fruits. Roastedness comes back along with dark coffee and herbal, bitter hops. Very nice! Smoky bitter finish. Medium-full body with a thick, chewy feel. Very well done and an amazing value at 7.99 a six-pack. Thank you Darkhorse!"
"Bold and strong, but also very drinkable and very aromatic. Delicious and well-tempered throughout the session. Highly recommended."
"D: Pretty darn good. I'd have a couple of these, make a fresh comment about the waitress, ask for a smoke, and feel like heaven is a place on earth because of beer."
"D: The slow start is discouraging but the finish is nice. This stout is above average, a good glass if you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is thin - this beer is smooth (with the taste delivering a certain bitter bite - thats a good thing) but needs more carbonation; it feels flat to me."
"Looks like some black, viscous sludge with a thin tan head. The aroma is off deep, deep, deep roasted mlats that give the idea of very strong, but slightly stale coffee grounds. The taste brings some more bitterness to the mix to help round out this great stout. The bitter coffee with some nice smokey creams to give some sweetness to such an overwhelming beer to the senses. Soliky, even oily smooth on the tongue. Goes down very easy for its thickness."
"Not to bad! dryness or aftertaste gets to me after a bit. But overall a good beer"
"D: Black beer for sure. Something different, which is nice. Good thing this one comes in a 12oz bottle...anything bigger would be tough."
"D - Mediocre. It is isn't that quaffable and it is strong abv. The burnt malt make the flavor, though initially quite pleasant, something you don't want to keep having."
"D: High abv goes unmasked. Easy drinking and smooth. Bitterness was bigger than I expected it to be, sometimes garnering to much attention by overpowering the other flavors."
"A nice winter drink. Mellow and well-crafted."
"Dark Horse seems to specialize in stouts (that means they're competing against Bell's in Michigan no less!), and this is the finest one I've tasted from them. A serious and charismatic brew. Recommended."
"I thought this was a black beer and not a stout but it is all double stout - dark thick and a beautiful dark brown head. The nose was also a wonderful compliment of bitter chocolate, toffee and dark coffee. The taste was solid but the worst mouthfeel I have ever felt in this style. Aside from this flaw it is tasty."
"overall -- after reading all of the good reviews of this beer, i'm sincerely hoping this was just a bad bottle. i really enjoy Dark Horse's ""too"" cream stout, and so i was excited to give this one a try. not a terrible experience, but i am disappointed, because it was just okay, in every sense of the word. perhaps i'll revisit in the future."
"Don't judge a beer by it's label art. Goofey looking donkey artwork on the label undermines the true gem inside. This pours motor-oil black with a nice dark brown head, which I got after coaxing it with a hard pour. Pleasant vinous aroma with cocoa and chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied. This is a big stout all the way. Chocolate and roasted/burnt malt on the front end. A dry stout-like bitterness follows. Hints of oak and burnt raisin in the middle. There's a dry hop bitterness toward the back. Finishes with layered chocolate and alcohol. Very solid yet unassuming double stout."
"Pours a jet black with a disapointing head. It is very thick as it pours, far from watery. The aroma as it pours smacks you right in the face, very coffee. Sweet, bitter, maybe a hint of chocolate. The it almost hits like a porter, the beer is rather sharp. For such a thick looking beer the mouthfeel is lighter than I expected. Alcohol is present in the back. Pretty good, would not buy again however, but worth a try."
"Overall, a harsh and not so subtle beer. It smells and looks wonderful, but doesn't beg to please the tastebuds."
"highly recommended."
"The flavor is quite strong, which I appreciate. However, it seems a bit burnt. Chocolate, coffee, and bitter. At least it's interesting. The other beers I reviewed tonight I complained about the lack of strong flavor. This beer has strong flavor, even if some of it is in the negative. However, it's a quality I was looking for. This beer has something going on, and if it hits your goals, it'll be a favorite."
"taste is very dry, kind of harsh on the back of the throat and coats the toungue. very roasty, too much roast not enough malt base to cover some of this harshness"
"Pours an dark black color with a tan and darker brown colored head, looks nice and creamy. Smell is hoppy, roasty, and chocolatey. Taste is slightly astringent, but plenty of hops in there and a nice cocoa flavor and a roasty undertone to help balance things out, quite good. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with lower carbonation, just about perfect. A very solid beer that I plan on getting again. I think this one will get even better with age, a hypothesis I plan to test out."
"drinkability: pretty good, not my favourite DH beer"
"Deep black with a seriously nice tan head. Slight head lingers on the surface down the glass. Nice roasted aroma-somewhat of a cross between mocha and a fine grade of chocolate. Somewhat faint but a pleasant aroma overall. Big, killer chocolate flavor. Huge graininess with a mellow, very rounded roasted flavor. Just a great mix. Good body but the grainy flavor leaves it a bit dry overall. Very, very drinkable beer. The dry/grain flavor is a tad much but very yummy indeed. Thank you sir may I have another?"
"Drinkability/Overall: a nice, roasty, bitter, mild, drinkable double stout. A nice alternative to Storm KIng in the category. Glad to see another good brewery being distributed in Madison. Bring it on."
"D - A solid stout that is just slightly astringent."
"The bottom line: a pretty tasty stout offering by the guys from Dark Horse. Does a nice job of incorporating hops strongly without making them unbalance the brew and make it less enjoyable."
"Opaque black beer with a thin tan head. Tan film hangs around and does give some nice lacing. Smell is a big WOW. Bitter chocolate, burnt coffee, smokeyness. Taste is so nice and full. This is one I wish I would have bought more of. Chocolate taste up front that turns into a nice burnt coffee bitterness. Finishes dry with a smokey aftertaste. I will have this beer every chance I get."
"One of the biggest suprises I've ever had in beer tasting. The label sure makes this look like an amateur beer, but everything else about it says that these guys know what they're doing. I really enjoyed this beer...not quite as much as Bell's Batch 7000, but it's right up there in my book. I really wish I could find this beer in my area. Good thing I spend a lot of time in Michigan."
"This beer poured into the glass and formed a black hole that seemed to swallow all light that tried to enter it. It formed a light tan head that slowly subsided. An aroma heavy of malt and coffee. The flavor was of malt, burnt coffee and a touch of chocolate. It had a medium body with a slight burnt aspect to the finish. All in all, a good beer."
"D - This is a wonderfully delicious beer for the style and the best new find of my Michigan trip. I wish it were more readily available on the east coast."
"This one pours beautifully, with a thick but not sludgy body and a brilliant dark brown head. The aroma is primarily of roasted malts -- lots of burny smells. The taste is bitter, bitter, bitter -- tons of roasted malt bitterness and a touch of something sour at the end. There's also a bit of egg cream and cookie spices. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but not nearly as thick as a lot of Imperial and Double Stouts out there -- this enhances the drinkability considerably, as it makes Dark Horse a substantial, but not a huge, beer. High marks overall. Not terribly complex, but very good at what it does have."
"doesn't strike me as 8%, another plus. strangely refreshing without sacrificing body. that's a strange bird, alright. recommended."
"black, with a small burnt unber head. opaque and very think and sludgy looking. roasted malt odor, pretty standard for the type. burnt taste is predominant. some creaminess. some hops on finish giving it a good bitterness. hops keep it interesting beyond the burnt roastiness. very toasty. overall pretty satisfying. going to have to visit dark horse up in MI sometime soon to drink from their taps."
"12 oz botle. Pours as black as can be, with a light head that falls to a patchy film over top. Light does not penetrate this one at all. Nose is very roasty, almost ashy, with a solid dark fruity sweetness, and coffee undertones. It seems a little distant. I'd really like it to be stronger in the aroma. Flavor is anything from distant. Initially, I'm hit with flavors of deep roast and dark fruit, that fades quickly into a coffee bitterness that is accentuated by a very nice and clean bitterness from the hopping. The hop bitterness really hangs well into the finish as well. I like the interplay of roast and hop. Feel is thick, with a light carbonation. Its not syrupy at all, really making this one work well on my tongue. This is a very easy drinking big stout. I like that the flavors come together to a nice combination of sweet and malty and roasty and hoppy. Alcohol is not obtrusive. This one is deceptively drinkable and would get me in trouble if it were on the shelves around me. Very excellent beer."
"Overall impression: A fine stout for sure. Would be in my regular rotation if available. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the astringency. Perhaps the grains were over-sparged. Still, a solid offering. Thanks malty!"
"Drinkability is definitely the weak point of this beer, but it is still good. Just not something I could drink more than one of in a row."
"Menacing dark black color, with an equally dark tan colored head. Half inch thick head fades quickly, leaving very little lacing. Delicious aroma, lots of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Hints of dark fruits and coffee in the background. The smell reminds me of melted Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bars. Full bodies taste, roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate. Quite bitter! Smooth mouthfeel, a bit thin, and leaves a definite dry feeling in the mouth. I never would have known this had a abv of 8%, very easy too drink. Another great offering from Dark Horse!"
"Deep opaque black body with a very large head more in the realm of a brown, rather than tan in color. Perfect appearence. Deeply roasted nose with hints of coffee mainly, and a touch of chocolate and blackberries. Taste follows suit with an explosion of roasted grains (chocolate, coffee), fruits and a mild hop bitterness. A tasty one for sure."
"Notes: This beer is great. I love the flavors, the balance and the body is super. I wish I could buy this one at my local store!"
"This black beer is a nice change of pace from the IPA's."
"Damn this poured like an Impy! Aroma is roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Deep black with a thin mocha head. Fore is very bitter with lots of coffee notes..hints of sweet cream in the middle along with quality milk chocolate and malt..the finish is again bitter with a big coffee finish. Intense flavor in this porter that could easily pass as a stout."
"Oh my the aftertaste on this beer is devilish. I cant help but drink it. I cant stop thinking about driving to Michigan to get more. As beefy as this beer is there are certain aspects that hid that fact very well. I could drink this all night how long that night would be is another question all to itself. Delicious complex relaxing, I really love this beer. Thank you RedHaze for the bottle, this was a great surprise! Recommended."
" Taste is well blended. Dark chocolate, coffee, and vinous fruits stand out. The mouthfeel is unique, I think. The body is thinner than one might expect, yet it feels grainy on my tongue. Tannic. And coating. This shows no sign of 8%ABV. Drink up!"
"Mouthfeel is chewy, creamy, smooth, sugary, and bitter-sweet along the palate."
"Another winner from Dark Horse...I am quite jealous I cannot obtain more of this gem...trade anyone?"
"Overall, this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. It has a nice complex, but exceedingly tolarable flavor. Sippable? Yes. But also smooth enough to drink several. Impressive."
"Full mouth that, as mentioned above, has some residual oil but the lingering hops seem to balance it out in the finish. I could drink two maybe three of these before calling it a night or at least switching to something with a lower abv."
"I could drink plenty more."
"Deep black color with a nice sized tan head that recedes quickly and leaves a good sheet of lace on the side of the glass. Nice espresso and chocolate aroma from the chocolate malt. It has just a hint a citrus from the hops, but its not overpowering. Bang! A lot more espresso in the flavor. It really comes across strong. The chocolate is there, but is a bit more subtle. The hops almost disappear, and are just there to balance the flavor a bit. Full, rich mouth feel, and a nice drinakbility. This is another nice beer from this brewery. Ive been impressed with their stouts."
"Mouthfeel is big with a nice creaminess and ample carbonation. The carbonation helps cut through this one making it more drinkable. This is a tasty stout that I wouldn't mind having around. Goes down quite easily and I would love to have a few on a cold night. Dark Horse continues to impress. Thanks to Cornboy for the opportunity."
"My first beer from Dark Horse, and I was pleasantly surprised. Can't wait to try the others in my fridge."
"What a fine brew."
"Drinkability and Notes  For a big stout this beer is relatively easy to drink, the dryness keeps the beer from getting cloying or unpleasant. However, with so many great big, available, American stouts out there this one just doesnt do anything to make itself memorable."
"D- A double stout? This is a nice beer but I'm not sure it the malt taste and texture would live up to the name double stout. It does have interesting hop notes, which you rarely see in stouts even American stouts. With more complexity in the roasted and some toasted grain this has great potential."
"[Once again, thanks to TikkiGodxxx for the great beer trade. You folk in the Midwest have some mighty fine brews!]"
"Absolutely impenetrable onyx. Fantastic, multi-layed chocolate milk lace pattern. Slight licorise on the nose seems out of place and funky, but then the flavor reassures you that this is fact one killer beer. Anise, soured milk. Roastiness is all over the place but kept in check with sweetly, almost Russian Imperial characteristics. Hoppy and bitter as all hell. Remains potent and in your face while remaining amazingly drinkable. Damned good from the source but equally good from the bottle  a remarkable achievement. Scarily similar to a smaller version of Rogues Imperial Stout."
"The title ""Black Bier Ale"" let me to expect something I might almost be able to see some light through, but this one is indeed black. The head is small, but persistent. The nose- buckwheat honey, dark coffee, malt and brown sugar. The palate- dry bitterness. The dark coffee predominates, but there is an unmistakable bitter note that reminds me of Campari. I am also reminded of a slightly burnt marshmallow. A big beer with a long, dignified finish. There is just a bit of chalkiness that mars the mouthfeel, however. Overall, though, I consider it a very good beer."
"This batch is well-carbonated, and the beer is incredibly drinkable for its strength. A fine beer for a session or a meal."
"The taste certainly gets way mo' better with temperature elevation. I was not vibing with this dark skinned beauty when we first met. Plan B: let her catch some heat. Result: Nice. Different, that is undeniable. Stout doused with India pale ale style hopping. The dryest finishing stout beer I have met in my short tenure as a guy who fancies himself a beer drinker and aspiring champion of beer. Stock stout flavors of coffee and chocolate and roasted malt challenged by hop bitters. Weird, yet foreseeable. Good shiznit. This is my second Dark Horse sample. Both times, the stuff has improved down the stretch. Watch the temperature I guess. So far, this brewer has made me appreciate the natural rawness of their styles. Realness. Purity. No selling out by Dark Horse. It beersonifies what being an individual is all about."
"OK, I was expecting something not like this. A double stout at 8% ABV? Not the ideal pre-dinner beer, but it's open, so here we go. The first shock was the appearance of what looked like motor oil pouring out of the bottle into my ""borrowed"" glass. Just a hint of mahogany highlighted the edges, and a nice tan head topped the beer and lingered for a while. The aroma was great, with dark fruits, roasted malts, and a it of herbalness. I typically discuss flavor before mouthfeel, but this one the latter demands attention. This beer is perfect for a big stout: Silky smooth, coolly enveloping the tongue, with the carbonation lifting the beer off the tongue on the finish. Best part, there's not a strong lingering sweetness that usually accompanies such a great mouthfeel. The flavor does have a strong black malt presence, and just a hint of caramel sweetness up front. Strong dark chocolate flavors develop, along with a touch of minty hop herbalness. Man, this stuff is great! I think this was about $8 a six pack. I may have to go get more before I go home. While a strong beer with respect to both flavor and ABV, I could drink a good bit of this stuff. This is one of those beers that make the effort of tracking down regional stuff worthwhile. (Also makes sitting in a hotel room easier as well....). Do yourself a favor and give this one a try. All too frequently ""Special"" beers arent that special. This one is Very Special. Nice."
" WOW! This is sooo not what I was expecting at all! I had no idea what I was in for. This one poured out like an imperial stout. Pitch brown with a thick caramelly creamy brown head that reduced quickly to a bit of a dusting and a thick ring. Huge aroma. Total shocker here too. Scents of lambic, rich imperial stout, alcohol, with tons of hoppiness. Merlot, chocolate, coffee, deep and roasty. Smooth and slightly creamy with a bitey carbination that snaps at you towards the end of the sip. Nice toasty dark hoppiness with a good bite. Blackened toast, dark bittersweet chocolate and espresso. This is damn luscious. Great flavors and feel. Nice one!"
"The beer smells strongly of smoke, milk, and burnt sugar. The initial taste is a sharp bitterness which seems like it's from the dark malts. The bitterness is reminiscent of a very dark chocolate. Subsequent sips reveal a smoother more balanced aspect to this beer as it warms up. As it warms up more a lot more chocolate comes out in the flavor. Be careful of drinking this beer too cold, it's not good, very astringent and bitter."
"Drinkability is high. Ignored this beer in my locals too long Very solid effort from the folks in Marshall."
"778"
"What a surprise when the label says ale on it thats is what I thought I was getting. Glad I got a porter. poured dark brown with a deep tan frothy head good lacing.aroma was carmel, chocolate,dark fruitsfinish a nice bitterness with hints a sweetness glad I had to buy a 6 pack of this and not just 1 bottle which I like to do when I am trying out a new beer"
"Starts with large roasted malts balanced with the ample lime-like citrus hops...then the middle settles on the toungue and departs a layered impression: chicory, medira, molasses, nuts...all over seen with the lime hops...the finish is long with the chicory molasses tastes giving way to the increased bittering...finally a deep metallic aftertaste and a slow warming....the alcohol is well buried in this rich brew...wadda stout!! recommended!"
"I don’t think I’ll be having another. However, given the topnotch reviews for this and the other brewery’s selections, I may try more from the brewer if I can find them."
"Huge head (poured semi-hard into a Duvel glass, convex atop!) with good duration and excellent lacing. Seemed rather thick at first sight, and right then and there I knew I had a true micro (or 'glorified homebrewer' as we sometimes like to say ; ) The aroma is amazing, and no matter what they wanna call this, Double Schwarzbier, triple Sweet Stout, etc, it's a super rich and malty dark beast, and the alcohol is barely discernable on both the nose and palate. Creamy mouthfeel, thinner than expected, with plenty of citrusy, aromatic hops, bittering hops, and roasted malts, all fighting for attention like paparazzi jockeying for a good photo op. Lingering, pronounced bitterness is not probably to everyone's liking but it is to mine. Notes of bitter chocolate, sour apple, and burnt toast. There's a lactic quality here that works out well, making for a more complex brew than one might expect from what at first glance seems like such a malt monster, so rather than be cloyingly sweet it's well balanced. Double Stout, huh? Not something that's done too often, and one bottle is probably more than enough bitter darkness to satisfy a couple of 'Guiness Draught' enthusiasts, as it's altogether a bit more challenging than most of the stouts you'll find. Nice dry finish too."
"I poured this beer from a 12 oz bottle and immediately I noticed its intense black color. Flowing from the bottle it looked like used motor oil. It is opaque and dark which makes it very nice to look at. It has a fizzy tan head that thins out pretty quickly. The aroma is definately roasty but has a distinct alcohol scent as well. The flavor is a dark maltiness with a sour earthy taste, some cherry, and more distinct alcohol warmth. The downfall of this beer I think is that it really only presents a dark malt flavor without much complexity in the flavor. It certainly looks great, but the flavor falls a bit short."
"This is a nice beer I would definately buy this one again."
"A good beer, but not something I could make a night out of."
"Another beer tasted at the Michigan Brewer's Festival. Opaque black in color with a decent brown head. The aroma is all roasted malt, and some sweetness. Flavor follows suit, this beer is sweet and thick like a big boned chocolate porter. Much thicker and roastier than I expected, this is a good beer."
"Well, who gives a crap, this is damned good, and that is all that the people need to know!"
"Received this bottle as part of BIF 10 from deejaydan. (See the Trading group forum for more on BIFs!) Odd, non-descriptive packaging with a cartoon drawing of a donkey (?!) Pours really dark brown... almost, but not quite, black. One of the darkest stouts I've seen. The head is not large, but is an interesting rich brown color (maybe a bit reddish) and is dense and foamy with decent retention. Some lace tries to cling to the glass, but slides back down. Smell is dark-roasted malts and maybe a little dark chocolate and coffee. Taste is more complex than expected. Roasted malt bitterness (or is that the hops?) Notes of chocolate and coffee as noted in the smell, but also hints of dark fruit and maybe a little licorice in the aftertaste. Very dry finish with some astringency. Alcohol, while initially well hidden, comes out more as the beer warms. Medium-thick mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for a strong stout. A very pleasant surprise! I liked this one pretty well and would definitely drink it again, given the opportunity!"
"Good brew!"
"Comments  A big thanks to garthwaite for sending me this offering from Dark Horse."
"A wonderful brew. Don't let the ""Black Bier"" title fool you, this is a double stout. Intense, chewy, rich, and full of complementary flavors. I would have liked this more with a smidge less flavor hops and a more velvety mouthfeel, but it still stands as an awesome brew. Considering it's dense body and ABV, this one is dangerously drinkable. I already drank half a bottle without batting an eye. Highly recommended."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 2"" of medium brown head over the opaque black brew. Long lasting head, laces well. Aroma is strongly of dark malts, but tempered with a bit of sweet creaminess. Taste is dominated by dark malts and their inherent bitterness, but closes out with a nice little hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, albeit quashed a bit by the dark malt bitterness, and drinkabilty is good as well. Good stuff, although I will admit I was fooled by the vague label as well, and was expecting a schwarz or black lager. Nice surprise."
"Sampled on tap at the brewery, then again from a 64 oz growler upon my return home. Pours black, which I guess is to be expected, given the name. Dark tan creamy head that laced nicely. Powerful aroma of blackberries, blueberries, deeply roasted malts, mild chocolate, & some earthy hops. Bitter front end with massive roastiness & the blackberry flavor to back up the aroma. Some chocolate & caramel notes as well as peppery hops make this a complex & unique brew. Not sure what style this fits in (schwarzbier, porter, stout, double stout), doesn't seem like it fits perfectly into any of them. What I do know is that this brew is no joke - it is heavily roasted, assertively bitter, and damn good."
"Another fine treat I can thank trbeer for!"
"Tan head swiftly recedes o a ring over this opaque black impressing hue. Powerful and appealing aroma. Impressively well blended and balanced, wait this is 8%? Smokey, roasted maple and gentle C-hops, grapefruity and lemony hit the nose together with molasses and licorice. Nothing overdone, nonetheless no flavor is shy. Dark malt comes out in a graham cookies and dark chocolate manner. C-Hops are just expressive enough to keep the focus and the malt interplay. Great mouthfeel with comfortable carbonation, as smooth as any oatmeal stout.. This is great psychprof.."
"A supreme stout. Exceeding the lineup of Rogues. Looks like yummy chocolate drink. Stout roasted, with chocolate aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with roast. More so than coffee, which works for me. Enough of a drink experience, that you don't know the alcohol until..klunk. Glad I bought a six-pack. Dry mouth aftertaste."
"Nearly black with a thin ring of tan head. Aroma is hoppy and piney but not very assertive. Flavor is quite bitter without much malt sweetness. Coffee and hop bitterness really overpower everything else. Slick, oily mouthfeel, but seems a bit weak bodied for the flavor. Marginal drinkability."
"Hmmm, whats this now...another awesome Michigan beer? This brew pours out an opaque black colour with a thick tan head that lasts. The aromas are all coffee, chocolate, caramel, deep roasted malts, and slight booze. The taste follows suit with tons of coffee flavors, and a lovely deep roasted malt flavor that than envelopes your tongue in dark (70%cocoa belgian) chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and soooo creamy and the drinkability is damn good as well. Oh yeah, there is also a nice freshly citirc hop flavor in this one as well....Very good."
"Yet another beauty I can thank marburg for."
"A nice tasting beer but a bit bitter for my taste. I would have a hard time drinking a bunch of these."
"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. Wow...a nice imperial stout character in a beer that doesn't seem too big. Hopefully one I'll have again this summer in Michigan."
"this one poured extremely dark and decently thick. But the head was nowhere to be seen, even though I did an extremely hard pour. Slight lacing but even that was weak. Taste was strong and malty. Lots of astringent flavors. Chalky texture to it. Thick molasses taste is dominant. Other dark flavors emerge but no chocolate or coffee which I usually taste. This one gets better the further I go along but it seems too one sided and rough for my liking."
"It pours very thickly. The head is very thin, and brown colored. The flavors are roasty with a hint of hops. it's nice tasting."
"Not what I was expecting when I ordered a ""black beer."" This has imperial stout all over it -- in the appearance, aroma, and flavor. An intense black hole for light that continues to be a visual void with its obsidian opacity. Sweet and roasty nose -- very big stout like character. Deeply bitter flavors. Pure, bitter chocolate. Roasted grains. Coffee beans. Toffee. Culminates with a big bitter finish that likes to hang out like a fun but slightly unwanted guest. A hell of a beer. I just wonder why they don't call it ""Special Reserve Stout"" or something..."
"Thanks to trbeer."
"Delicious. This pours out black in the glass with an aroma of chocolate, lightly of black licorice and coffee. The taste is complex, with roasted, burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee. A nice dose of hops on the finish. This seemed more like a stout than a swartzbier, but hey, its a highly drinkable beer whatever the style may be."
"Foamy head of fat ass bubbles over pitch. Nose of chocolate butter creme, roasted walnuts and a hard working weed whacker. An amiable roastiness hits the buds straight off to meld seamlessly into a long, but mild-mannered hop bitterness that necessitates another sip be recorded as a ring of lace on your hard working pint glass. Simultaneously lush and refreshing. Great beer!"
"Dark jet black color, small lasting head, roasted coffee-chocolate aroma, black burnt plum-coffee-chocolate flavor, very burnt and dry bitter finish. Medium body with a soft, silky and creamy mouthfeel, I put my money on this Dark Horse, this is a winner! I really like this one."
"Black in color with a very nice looking cocoa brown head. Roasty and malty nose with some fruit and hops. Wonderful deep, rich, toasted malt flavor. Also there was coffee and fruit making this a very complex beer. My favorite aspect of this beer was a very mellow carcoal flavor, like one would get if the beer were aged for some time. This really was a pleasure to drink."
"22 oz. bottle - crappy label... great beer! Pours an opaque black with deep mahogany highlights at the rim and base. The head is a full and creamy orangish-brown. It holds well and leaves some very nice lace. A simple swirl of the glass will bring up a thin surface covering. The nose is fruity and exceptionally roasty with lots of caramel and some mild floral/grassy hops. The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's gently crisp and creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with a light berry-like & apple fruitiness, becomes more caramelish and creamy as it warms with hints of floral hop flavor, and then unleashes an avalanche of bold, deeply-roasted coffee and bitterness into the dry finish. The bitterness lingers alongside short flashes of sweet caramel and deep roast. Although this beer is listed here as a German-style Schwarzbier, it is certainly not! It's much too over the top for that. And yet, it's very nicely balanced allowing the sweet caramel maltiness to show amongst a very deep roast (burnt) character and some intense bitterness. Rich and exciting!"
"Easy to indulge in this elixer."
"The beer pours darker than the inside of a cow! Head is colossal, creamy; the lace sticky thick sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both are a nice chocolate color. Nose is coffee like roasted grains, caramel, with hints of malt, very sniffable. The start is malt and somewhat sweet, the top is bulky, the finish is ponderously hopped, scantily carbonated, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, very quaffable beer, and a nice way to start the weekend, also well worth your trying."
"This medium bodied German black bier is so thick and dark light can’t even escape.  It has a strong roasted berry aroma and the complex flavor includes roasted malt and cloves.  The initial tastes do not include much of a hop presence, but there is a nice lingering light bitterness with the finish."
"Not a bad beer. There's actually a lot of citrusy hops for a porter since the darker, maltier beers tend to just eat the hop flavors and you can really pick them up in this beer. On the appearance, it really comes closer to a stout than a porter, but the flavor and aroma really fit in with the porter style. This beer gives me the impression that this brewery could really do some good stuff."
