"An extremely dark IPA, imagine a stout's maltiness with a rich IPA hop presence. Very different but delicious."

"Overall - There is a lot going on here. This is a bold, complex beer that is not for the faint of heart. Strangely, the beer reminds me, a little, of a good German Dopplebock. Pop open a Bomber and enjoy!"
""
"Unfortunately, I had this after a 97 BA Imperial Black IPA from Uinta. Maybe that  is just unfair. I mean it is okay, but nothing special.  Flat. No malty sweetness. No Hops to speak of. Minimal head and lacing. Kind of bland. Not saying it is not a drinker. It does go down rather smooth with no noticeable characteristics. That's the problem, it is just too middle of the road, which should appeal to those who like bland beers. Just won't be on my buy list again."

"O: Hmm. No quality issues, just not a delicious beer. Nice perfumey hoppy nose but the flavour is dry and boring. Black IPA? Surely it's just a porter. Not the best offering I've had from this brewery."

"O-has a great mix of hops and roasted malt that does not overpower you and leaves me wanting more"
""
""
""

"O: This beer drinks very easily although it seemed like it would have been better if the aromas and flavors were a little stronger."

"Love this one! Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a fluffy tan head. Roasted malt with some chocolate and hop aromas. Roasted malt, chocolate, hop, caramel, citrus and pine flavors. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Roasted malt and lightly sweet hop finish. A very good beer."
""
"Intense floral hop aroma. Pours black, almost entirely opaque, with a thin white head leaving behind a lot of lacing on the glass. Piney hops, malt character shows up more as it warms: roasty with some caramel notes. Finishes with a slightly bitter and very dry finish. The beer itself is very good and great to drink but doesn't stand out much in my neck of the woods where there are arguably too many IPAs (if such a state is possible)."
""
"This was a disappointing offering. First of all I love IPAs but I've only had a few black IPAs. Second, this wasn't a bad beer but it tasted more like a porter than an IPA. Smell was dark with a slight hop aroma. Taste was smokey (like a porter) and never tasted any hops. The aftertaste was the worst. It was slick, oily and tart."

"22oz bottle dated Jun 03 13. Served in pint glass. Beer pours actually more brown than black, though totally opaque in the glass, with a medium foamy chestnut head. Aroma is decent, but more big malt brew than IPA, like a brown ale or even a coffee stout. Flavor confirms it: roasty, nutty flavors, with a strong mocha flavor. Like an overly fizzy chocolate stout. Besides the fizziness it has the thinner mouthfeel of an IPA, too. But -- not to say that this brew is too sweet -- I really don't get any particular hop character. To call this an IPA is a sham. Beeradvocate calls it American Black Ale, but this is no CDA either. Still, it's decently enjoyable for what it is, even if it misses the style guidelines."

"Well, not quite pitch-black but fairly close. Some ruby highlights, and a tan head that's quite sizable and holds its own. Very nice lacing. Not too much on the nose - some malty pine, woodsy charcoal, a bit of grapefruit. For a black IPA it is very drinkable. More pine and citrus, some smokiness and malt. There's a bit of an oily feel, mild carbonation, heavier than I anticipated. Very reasonable price for a bomber at $4.99, and one I'd gladly get again if for anything to look at the great designs in the lacing: a cat, a whale, three cyclopes dancing arm-in-arm."

"O - This is what I'd recommend to people when wanting to try a black IPA, this is a very solid brew that is sessionable when you want the darker side of malts and roasted flavor with a good hop balance."
""
"Interesting brew. Sort of joins the worlds of IPAs and Stouts/Porters. I don't really know if it was a bridge that needed to be built though. Usually when I drink an IPA I'm not in it for the maltyness, and when I drink a stout, I'm not there for hops. A good beer, but a good beer with no home."

"This is quickly becoming one of my favourite styles. Not the best example I've had, but a solid offering and a welcome surprise on a rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Color was a mostly opaque black with a thick 1 finger light brown head. A fair bit of cling on the sides. Aroma was a roasted grain, with a bit of brown sugar in the back. Bits of lactose alternated with a bitter smell. Flavor was roasted grain with a bit of burnt lactose. As time went on, the burnt got a bit stronger. Felt good in the mouth, coated very well without being overly sticky. Overall not bad, but nothing special."
""
""
"Watery and not hopped enough for a CDA. Plays almost like a hoppy schwarzbier. Heard Widmer was the best of the CBA; this is a disappointment."

"Not a bad beer at all. Black IPA's always surprise me, even though I know what to expect. It's like that purple colored Ketchup. Tastes like ketchup, but it just looks weird. Nice hop profile and a good balance with the roasted malts. Definitely a better brew than I was expecting."

"O- I was going to give this an average score as i jotted down the review on paper, but as i began typing it up, the beer warmed, and i found myself liking it more and more. This is the 4th and final bottle out of the 4 pack, the 1st was such a disappointment that i drain poored it, the 2nd was ok, the 3rd good, and the 4th ended up being pretty damn tasty. I'm glad i caught it at the perfect temp and decided not to review it until now. Time to got turn the thermostat down on my fridge."

"O- Pretty good, combines styles well."

"Not much of a malt profile for a ""pitch"" black IPA. Would've expected some roasted notes or at least something in the darker category. For a fan of the dark cascadians this beer left me wanting on that subject. Otherwise this beer was good and I would drink again but cannot say I would choose it over some of the other options out there. I look forward to more brews coming out of the Widmer brothers operation."
"O: Well, this wasn't too bad, but I wasn't impressed with it either. The mouthfeel sort of killed it for me. There are probably better black IPAs out there. No memorable qualities come to mind for this beer and I doubt I'll remember it for too long. 3/5"

"I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this beer turned out. Especially as it was not at what I'd call a bargain for a 4 pack. Kudos to the brewer!"

"This is a very good beer, I just don't think it has quite enough hop character in it to truly be an IPA. I think it tastes more like a strong porter with slightly more hops in it than normal. Still, good nonetheless and it will stay on my list of beers I'd like to have again."
""
""
""
"O- Back and forth on this one, one sip is ehh, but then the next is pretty good, then there is that bad pill taste. In general, probably won't be trying this one again."
""
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a very dark brown appearing black in the glass, with a half finger light tan head with decent retention. Aroma was piney hops with light toasted malt. Flavor follows, with light pine and citrus hops and toasted malt, light singed coffee. A fairly understated black ale, but maybe I've been spoiled by black IPAs. Light to medium bodied. A satisfactory black ale, but nothing really stands out about it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was better than expected. Better than other black IPAs I have tried."
""
"Overall – A pretty decent dark IPA. It has a good hop and roast flavors. While not the best out there, as it’s transitions and complementation of the roast, sweet and hop flavors are not always smooth, it does have decent individual flavors.."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the hop freshness through the taste. The nose, however, was comparatively weak. Following in the taste, we wished there was a better balance throughout, as we felt the malts were underdeveloped, and the hops were left without any real good match."
"Overall: I like certain things about this beer, but it seemed a bit light and watery on the palate. I have enjoyed more of this when on draft, but will still drink in a bottle."
"O: OK, let me say I'm not a big hop head.... and this beer is not over the top hoppy but a little on the sticky hoppy side. A good representative for a Black IPA. If you like black IPA give this one a try."
""
"Real nice nose on this one. Has that fruity tone to it you'd expect from the style. Flavor is pretty good, though it doesn't really live up to the fragrance at all. Pretty easy to drink, but not really bringing a mass of complexity. Just hits ya in the mouth, and it's good. Just not overly memorable."
""
""
"Overall it's very nice--I' happily order this again."
""
"Looks a bit like cola. Almost opaque brown with a thin head, sandy white in color. Nice to see a blac IPA that looks more like an IPA as opposed to a stout that happens to be hoppy. The aroma is like chocolate covered hops; rich ganache with a hint of coffee, citrus, honey, and lavender. A touch of dark raisiny fruit is there as well, making this a nice balancing act between the malts and the hops. A nice sprightly carbonation keeps this pretty easy to drink in spite of its rich flavours, as does an overall dryness. The general impression is one of balance; there are some good juicy citric-tropical hop flavours here, but they share the stage with the chocolatey, kind of licoricey flavours of the malts. This isn't a beer that has me totally engrossed in its nuance, but it is a damn tasty sipper and a great example of the style."
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
"Overall, this is a good beer. It's an easy beer to sit and drink while not ruining the palate and providing solid flavors."
""
""
""
"Roasted, charred bitterness up front. Coffee and dark chocolate malts settle in, with a meaty, smoky edge. Slightly fruity. Herbal, piny, minty hops complement the malt nicely. A little spicy. A little drier in the finish, with lingering charred malts. Medium body with a slightly creamy feel. A nice black IPA."
""
"Pours very dark, nearly black. Really smells great. I grabbed a couple of bottles of this at a nearby store, and was really looking forward to it. It’s not a bad beer, malty and hoppy all at once, with a really nice roasty taste to it, but I felt like there was something missing from it. The flavor was a bit too smooth. Something was just not quite there. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s not quite a great one either. Certainly worth a try, though."

"Poured on tap at the J. Clyde in June 2011. Pours a flat black color that eats up the light with a very moderate chestnut tones at the edges of the glass. Creamy, khaki head with decent lacing overall. The nose was light on hops, mostly pine and lemons, and heavy on the roasted malt. The tast was full of oily hops, very pine driven and low key on the malt; more the opposite of the nose, which was a little off for me. Overall not a bad beer, but maybe could have produced a more harmonious interaction between malt and hop."
"Overall - Not big on the pine hop character, but the citrus is there to keep it in check. Great malt/hop balance for a CDA. Not sure I could drink more than a few of these at a time, but a standout amongst it's contemporaries in a fairly new style of beer."

"Overall - This one was a little more on the stout side of the style in my opinion. It still had some nice hop bitterness but only during the aftertaste. I'd also like a little more of a grapefruit presence. Still a very good beer that I would have again."
""
"It's a tad astringent but mostly okay. Medium body and carbonation with a moderately dry finish. Overall this is a good beer, but not a great beer. I would probably try it again, however."
""
"Really enjoyed this beer. Would love to pick up some more."
""
"My favorite part of this brew is the way it feels in your mouth. The carbonation is smooth with small bubbles but adds a nice crisp texture to the brew. Also the hops have a nice presence here with a clean bitterness balanced by the sweeter malts. A really good beer and a great cheap find at costco. Well worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Thank you sir may I have another"
"O- This one is a genre bender, never heard of a black ipa before. I like it. It isn't an over hopped stout or a burnt tasting ipa. Unique and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For me this is more like a Black IPA; Hoppy with roasted malt as oppose to a roasted malt beer with hop notes somewhere in the background."
"Overall: I am not overly familiar with a ""Black IPA"". Listed here as an American Black Ale. This has a good balance of malt and hop, both in ample quantities. Purchased a 4-pack on ""close-out"" for $3; well worth that price."
"Overall I really like this beer. It is smoother than a lot of American black ales in that there isn't a lot of tannic bitterness from the malt. A really good effort and something I will pick up again."
"Yet another nice find at The World of Beers in Fort Myers, Florida, this black IPA has a solid black color with a big tan layer of thick bubbles on top and really impressive lacing. The nose detects piney hop delight with citrus edges and just a touch of swampy malt. Very much what the doctor ordered. The flavor offers a minty pine/herbal/citrus medley of hop goodness with a touch of bread pudding sweetness. It’s medium bodied with a smooth midland feel that includes a healthy carbonation. A very solid black IPA that I enjoyed."
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, citrus hops and a mellow grapefuity citrus. In the taste, mellow citrus hops and a small roast. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hop and roast in the aftertaste. A nice hop presence, with a small roast presence, quite smooth and nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a nearly opaque, dark brown color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The retention was good and it left lacing in chunks and then, later, bands. The aroma was of toasted and roasted malt, anise, molasses balanced with pine, grass and resiny hops. The flavors were quite enjoyable and appropriate for the style. I tasted all the elements from the aroma with the roasted malt and sweet notes being in harmony with the bitter elements of the piney hops. Well balanced and I really enjoyed the light chocolate and coffee notes that ‘filled out’ and added to the traditional IPA flavor profile. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation soft. A very good example of an American Black Ale/Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale and if you’ve never tried one (though it is a little more pricey) I’d recommend picking up a four-pack."
""
""
""
"O - A great, great black IPA, and a personal favorite in the style. If you would like to explore the newfound world of black IPAs, seek this one out. If you're a hophead, I would recommend trying it if you see it. Not for the new, pretty complex stuff."
"Pours a pitch black color with a slight but quickly disappearing head but with rather good lacing. Only scent I'm able to pick out are hops yet the scent is rather mild. The texture is quite full and thick. First you get a taste of chalky malts and robust flavors which turn into a crisp bitter finish. Great overall taste a highly drinkable. A rather good and reasonable sipping beer."
"A very complex and worthwhile beer, especially if you want the best of both worlds, a dark stoutish beer with IPA hoppiness."
"This poured out as a deep brown color. The head was foamy looking and had a tan color to it. The smell of the beer gave off some lively hops on the nose with a bit of roasted malts underneath that. The taste was fairly well balanced I thought between the citrusy hops with the roasted malts. The mouthfeel of the beer was sharp and yet smooth at the same time. Overall I thought that this beer was pretty good and wouldn't mind drinking it again someday."
""
""
"O: Solid beer right here. These Portland hipsters know how to do their brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste a little toasty malt on the front end with sweet citrus notes from the hops on the back end. The beer has a very nice mouth feel and has a solid malt back bone to balance the hops over all a great shot at the style."

"Earthy, malty, and tasty. But, eh…not the sort of thing I'm going to turn to, again and again. Just doesn't thrill me. I hope this fad dies off soon, actually."
""
""
""
"O --- Disappointing. Compared to all the other solid Black IPAs on the market this one doesn't measure up. It's closer to a roasty Porter than an IPA. Not crazy about it."
""
""
" I do not recommend this, and that's unfortunate. Less of a hop boil might help. No indication this is fresh hops, but if so: the boil is probably still off. The hopping ruined it. It could have been damn good. Get a better brewer: one who knows how to use hops."
""
""
"O - I like this brew, great flavor profile, leans towards the hops but puts forth a smooth taste."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with reddish edges and a thin white head that settles to a slight haze and ring. Pungent aromas of resinous hops, coffee beans, and a touch of chocolate. Taste is similar to the nose, more citrus and pine hops with a lightly bitter roasted malt profile. Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Maybe a touch on the watery side. Overall a very easy-drinking Black IPA, but nothing special. I'll stick with Sublimely Self-Righteous."
""
""
"Appearance is black with a thin tan head. Its` nose has resin hops, roasted malts and some notes of chocolate. The taste contains piney hops, general earthiness, malts and a bit of black licorice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice, clean finish to it. All things considered, a pretty good black ale, but nothing worth seeking out imho."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also very hoppy, considerable bitterness, followed by some roasted malts.. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a decent brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love this style and I'm definitely enjoying this brew. Not as thick and chewy as I had expected but then again, this isn't a stout or porter. I see myself definitely drinking more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The overall vibe from this is more of a stout than a hop-forward black IPA, the balance is what makes me say that which I like, I just think it could be a little more dry and bitter. If you like less malt flavor in your IPA's you may enjoy this less, I like it for what it is which is a pretty decent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a slick bright black, if that makes sense, with a two inch sticky light tan head, that settles into a fluffy coating of film, and lots of lacing. Smell is pineapple, roasted chocolate, coffee, and pine. Taste is all all of those, with a wonderful balance, nothing dominates. The body is a bit thin considering the look, but that helps with the drinkability. Plenty of life and lush, as apposed to dry. This is a very solid and sessionable black ipa. Date clearly marked Oct 10 11."

"I have not had many black ales that lean towards the hops, so this was an unusual beer for me. I didn't find the hops overwhelming, as it was a smooth IPA. And, my taste buds detected some mild caramel and coffee undertones -- maybe even dark chocolate. I suppose it is possible that I found these tastes because I was expecting them from a dark beer. The malts, however, are definitely subdued and it was like a somewhat balanced/mild IPA."
"Overall this beer is very delicious and I would buy this in case quantity its one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany color under a mighty head of dense, beige foam. Zesty citrus hop, pale fruit, and grass aroma with just a hint of caramel malt. Smooth, nicely balanced flavor giving hops the edge. Lots of juicy grapefruit and pine needle hoppiness turning peppery and a little earthy. Sweet bread and mild char make up the malt component. Medium, creamy body seems a bit under-carbonated...the bitter and the roast give it a solid astringency. Solid overall, though the mouthfeel made it feel heavier than it should have."
""
""
""
"Overall it's an okay black IPA. Nothing notable. Definitely one of the weaker Black IPAs or American Black Ales that I have had"
"The palate is awash in a velvety blanket of molasses with a subtle hoppy finish. This is a very pleasant quaff, whatever it is called."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer would be better served on a hot summer night. Bottled in October, it will have lost its edge by then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good mouthfeel."
""
""
"Taste: The first sip is smoky in the finish with a floral hop presence in the front. It sticks to the glass nicely. There are almost oak like notes, a woodiness. The mouth feel is creamy. It is not a super hoppy IPA but expresses good flavor. The taste is more like a black lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I liked this one thought it was pretty solid."
"Overall this is not a bad beer, in fact it is a good beer all things considered. That being said I have had better ABAs/BIPAs. I will seek out a fresh example."
"Appearance is Dark, pitch black, nice. Smell is well, toastymalty, is that a word? Seriously this is a nicely balanced beer. Mouthfeel is very clean and crisp, leaves the mouth nicely. Taste, lovely, malty with and slightly hoppy flavor; notes of coffee or smokey flavor. Overall this beer is fridge worthy, enjoy. This will go nicely with some smoked pork."
"I'm not sure why this beer is 9+ for a 4 pack as it isn't big, it isn't bold, and it isn't impressive. Perhaps this beer is a bit old 4 months is a long time for an IPA, but this is just showed up here so it wasn't available fresh."
"Pours very dark, almost black, with a solid head of foam. The aroma is a well-balanced blend of smooth roasted amtls and floral, resinous hops. The flavour is just as balanced, with notes of dark fruit and cocoa, strong bitterness, and citrus. Finishes malty and bitter, but dry."
"Nice and easy drinkable medium to light bodied IPA."
"Taste is bitter, but not like some IPA's. The bitterness is high after swallowing and lingers,but it is not mouthnumbing. The hoparoma with the citric, lemons and grapefruit combine well with the light roasted taste of the malts. This is roasted but more in a dark chocolaty way than coffee. Does that make sense? It is a mild, unaggresive, maybe a little acidic, low burning roast and it compliments with the bitter and hops. Mouthfeel is perfect for this kind of beer. I enjoyed this very much!"
"Overall, this is a smooth drinking dark ale with a nice hop aroma and flavor without a lot of the harshness one might expect from an IPA or ABA. Good stuff - well done Widmer."
"Overall, this is a good black IPA. It toes the line between black IPA and hoppy stout. It does come across a little thin at times, but it's balanced and smooth. It's worth looking into."
"Poured into a standard pint a deep dark brown with a one finger beige colored head that never really settles completely.Wow love the big resiny/prickly hops in the nose,molasses and roast out the profile out,very nice.Dry and roasty with a healthy doe of resiny hops on the palate,a little molasses-like sweetness comes into play as it warms,but it stays on the dryer side.I think this a great ABA,its Pacific northwest in its big hop notes,a damn good beer."
" I just wasn’t digging this one. That flat tasting green citrus flavor just controlled too much of the taste here and ultimately made this a fairly bland drinking experience. It’s too bad to, as the nose showed some promise."
"Poured *almost black* with a petite light brown head leaving good lacing. Smell fluttered on what I would call 'hoppy' but was still dominated by the dark malt presence. Hops coming through were mostly fruity. Taste was rather well balanced- the hops came through enough to give the beer's ""IPA"" title merit (although that IPA title is apparently a misnomer?) I rather enjoyed the roasted, coffee like malt flavors that were complimented by the fruity hops. Mouthfeel was smooth, but a bit oily."
"Easy recommendation for those who love hops but have trouble with excessive bitterness."
"Simple yet effective. Black IPAs don't always do it for me but this one has a nice balance and drinks easily."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted dark malt and a pungent herbal hop aroma. Taste is of roasted dark malts with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is also a bit of a roasted coffee bean flavor I am picking up too. Very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip quickly fades. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good black ale with a nice balance between the roasty malt and the hop flavors."
"O: Too much roast and not enough hop flavor."
"Last beers of the day...weekend...Widmer Pitch Black IPA...SCHWING!!!! This is a great beer....and I dont care who you are!!!! This beer pours ""pitch black"" with thin good ecru head that is lacing nicely. The smell includes fresh hop, pine and subtle citrus. The taste starts as an ipa pine bitterness and a little citrus. Then the after taste is malt with a semi sweet kicker. The mouthfeel is awesome, I am glad they didnt get too crazy with abv...really makes for a great session ale!!! Good Job Widmer Bros!!! Good job!"
"O: Overall, I don't have much to say about this beer. There is a hop flavor that is cancelled out by a malt flavor, resulting in really a zero-sum beer. Yeah, that's a bit of flavor, but it's actually difficult to locate. I honestly don't know what to say about this beer. It's utter lack of distinction overall is what makes it distinctive."
"O - A nicely balanced version of the style...this is a Black IPA that you could go for anytime because it's cheap and readily available"
"A Stout IPA? You bet. My favorite two beers on two different levels come together in some strange jungle fever way. Great creamy head, lacing and dark brown color looks like a stout. Then wait give it a whiff and it's an IPA. A magical IPA! Mellow easy on the nose aromas of hops, nuts, and coffee. The taste is light and complex of hops, coal, metallic and a citrus nut after taste. One of the best and strangest beers I have ever had. Love these outside the box beers. My favorite that the Widmer Brothers make. Love it."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but not as interesting or intriguing as I would have thought."
"O - Better than I expected honestly. It's far from my favorite black IPA, but it's definitely not bad. Reminds me much more of a hoppy stout than a black IPA if that makes any sense."
"This beer provides a real nice roasted malt backbone with hints of chocolate and perhaps coffee. The finish has a pleasant hop punch with lemon zest and grapefruit flavors. I also detect an herbal quality as well. A smooth and drinkable black IPA."
"The nose features a nice balance of roasted malt with pine, floral and fruity hops. Fairly stinging bitterness and sharp burnt malt flavors make a potent 1-2 combo. The soft feel seems to balance out the beer moreso than do the light citrusy/floral hops and a dash of cocoa. A very solid offering in the style; give it a chance and you just may be surprised."
"M/O: Very crisp and bubbly. The beer has a nice tingle to it which helps to deliver the flavors. Overall, its a very hoppy interpretation of this style but you do get some of the good balanced coffee aromas I expect from a style like this."
"Overall: This is the first black IPA I’ve had and I’m not sure I’ll be trying very hard to seek out anymore. I mean, I’ll spend some time trying to get other people’s opinions on what is a good bench mark for the style. I really hope they don’t say this one."
"D/O: Drinks well, an overall pleasant hoppy black IPA. 4.0"
"Living up to it's name, Pitch Black IPA is...pitch black. Only with a directly light behind it could I get copper highlights on the very edge. Tan head on top that fell with a nice lace. Big hop off the top--Cascade hops, from smell and according to the website. Some malt in the nose underneath, but mostly the hop. Not overly complex hop continues in the mouth with a clean, solid bite. Tastes like the hop addition was fairly early--or at least fairly big for the early hops. Nice roast taste without an bitter or coffee taste. Debittered black malt can account for the lack of bite from the malt--lets the hops stand out from the base of the beer. Grass and roast off the back, dry and clean. Not a bad beer, and, depending where I was, would have another if I wasn't distracted by other choices. Mouthfeel is a bit lacking and watery, but otherwise a good beer."
"M - Thin body. Interesting juxtaposition of dark beer (in looks and mildly in flavor) and the body of a light and refreshing IPA."
"A nicely drinkable, understated black IPA. I could see this as a transition beer for the style."
"despite being an IPA slight coffee as well.. A little weird but still pretty tasty."
"I wasn't expecting much from this -- I'm lukewarm on Widmers for the most part -- and nothing's really changing that. I wouldn't turn away a pint, but I can't imagine paying that much for a 4pk any time soon."
"Poured pitch black from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Brown foam with minimal lacing in glass. Smooth bodied with full malt flavor. Thin mouthfeel that was somewhat surprising. Well balanced hops that where citrus, piney, very mild bitterness. A bit of a surprise on a for a style I am not very familiar with. Would try again with a few other black ipas to compare."
"O:Not bad example of a Black IPA but many other betters ones are on the market. Though for someone transitioning from a stout to IPAs it might be a good intro."
"Definitely has a different look and taste from most IPAs I have tried. Pretty unique."
"This beer is pretty much what a Black IPA should be, if you added a little more hops. It was very hoppy, don't get me wrong, but I think it could've used a little more to put it over the top. I was impressed with the malt base though. It was dark, as it should be, but not too roasty or harsh. I picked up some chocolate to go along with the bitter hops and it finished nice and dry as an IPA should. A surprise find at a bar I wasn't expecting much from."
"O - Great brew, this one has about a year on it and is drinking wonderfully. No bitterness and all flavor. Wonderful summer brew. I'm not an ABA fan , but f they all tasted like this one, it would be my favorite style. Super unique. Happy 4th of July!"
"O: okay beer. Last time I'm likely to drink."
"D - not a bad beer by any stretch, however this doesn't really hit the style profile. Taste and body are more like an English porter and nothing like an IPA or cascading ale. A tasty beer but not what I had in mind."
"I'm a big fan of Black IPAs, but this one really didn't do it for me. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I've been enjoying alot of Black IPAs lately. This one isn't worth the price of admission."
"Taste, just right down the middle. Bitter, hoppy, but pedestrian. No major discernable flavor, but no off flavor. Not roasty, coffee, chocolate, don't taste them. Maybe a mild toffeeness to it. Would put the ibus around 45. Dry finish, yet smooth enough for easy drinking. A decent beer at a good price. Kind of a go to for people new to the black ale emerging phenomenon."
"The drinkability is relatively high. This beer has IMO, a great flavor profile, a nice nose, and with 6.5% abv it's got a nice punch but still easily drinkable in small quantities if desired. I think it's a solid beer and I'd be happy to have another or pleased to share it with a friend."
"Nothing real special going on here, but this is a well crafted and quite sessionable brew."
"O: I feel bad because I got an old bottle, but this is just bad. Not flavorful or interesting. I don't understand why a rep would give us an old bottle when he wants us to bring this in. I will give this one more try if I find a fresher batch, but am hesitant as to the quality of this beer regardless of age."
"My first from this brewery. I am glad I picked up a four pack. Good representation of this style."
"Medium bodied with a medium effervescence. Aftertaste is where the malt is mpst noticeable, balancing the hops nicely. This is, fortunately, not one of those over-hopped IPAs we get so often these day. A well-rounded brew from start to finish."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with chestnut highlights and a frothy, skimpy head that clings to the glass. The nose is heavy of roasted malt/caramel, with steady hop presence, citrus notes, and a slight milk chocolate character. Flavors are smooth dark chocolate and roasted coffee, with a dark, wet, resinous hop profile that balances, but doesn't overpower. Take a chocolate orange, melt it in a coffee pot, and hop the shit out of it. Slight bittersweet aftertaste, with a dry, astringent finish. Delicious!"
"Overall: It's got some punch to it, but it's also still fairly smooth. These beers are going from unique to hackneyed in a real hurry with every brewery racing to produce one."
"Overall I didn't expect much from this but remembered that I did like their hefeweizen so I figure it would be a good effort. Pleasantly surprised with a very drinkable Black IPA. Give it a try!"
"Overall: Very enjoyable black IPA. I am becoming a fan of this style and this one is definately a nice compliment to the style"
"Lives up to its name, pours pitch black, not much head or lacing, but definitely a dark beer. Smell is pure hops, huge amounts of grapefruit and citrus. Not much of a malt/chocolate smell at all, but I did smell a little bit as it warms up. Taste is just like the nose, with the chocolate malts showing up more on the finish but dominated by the big hop flavor. This is a very hop forward black IPA. If that's how you like them, then this one is a damn good example. Body is on the lighter side, and also more reminiscent of an IPA. Easy to drink, very refreshing and just a downright excellent beer from a brewery that doesn't get much credit these days."
"O: Not bad, the bitterness overload from the hops + burnt flavor at the same time can be a bit much. Would go great with some food (BBQ). Pretty light and clean beer otherwise. Probably the best Widmer beer I've had."
"D: I'd order another and buy 6. This is the 2nd best CDA I've had to Stone 11th Anniversary/SSR"
"O: I like this, it's quite tasty. Good choice for a cool spring evening where the chocolate keeps you warm and the hops speak of the promise of summer yet to come. Will buy this again."
"O - Not bad at all. Could have used a bit more balance or boldness, but still nice."
"Pours a lovely opaque sable with a minimal head - but this may have been an artifact of the pour. Aroma is not strong but invitingly hoppy with a bit of a smoky hint. Flavor is hoppy and rather bitter with a malty undertone and just a hint of unsweet chocolate. Texture is fairly smooth, yet lively and tingly. If you like both IPAs and stouts, I’m sure you will dig this one."
"Better hop bite in the taste, but it's not up to the IPA levels one would expect. Nice darker malt flavor--mostly semi-sweet chocolate. Appealing but thin bodied. Low carbonation as well."
"Two fingers of tan head over a black ale with brown edges. Good retention and lacing. Aromas are prominent and quite nice, with roasty malts but also distinct Northwestern hops...florals to boot. Flavors fall a little flat. There's a metallic note underlining each flavor. Sweet breadiness from the malt, and also roasty bordering on burnt. Loved the aromas, but disappointed in the flavors not being more balanced."
"M. Not nearly heavy enough, and yet it is too oily. The biggest downfall of this brew."
"D: Very easy drink from this ""Black IPA," goes down smooth and has some nice flavor. Didn't blow me away but it was solid nonetheless."
"O-Dissapointing."
"Overall: Can't say it's a bad beer, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations for it. Oh well, no more WBBCPBIPAs for me any time soon."
"O - this is a good beer that I'd gladly have again."
"I disagree with the name, but like the flavor. This is more of a Brown IPA, which actually works better than some hoppy stouts and black IPAs that I have had. Good work, Widmers."
"D - This was drinkable, but not spectacular. A good beer for someone who wants to start trying dark ales/black ipa's. Just realize that others in this style are more aggressively hopped."
"O: Solid. Been impressed with some of the Widmer stuff I've had recently (e.g., this and the Nelson DIPA)."
"Overall, not a bad beer. It grows in the glass and is great for sipping."
"Overall: A very drinkable black ipa. I could drink a couple of these. I tend to like this style and this is a good representation. My favorite from the brewery so far."
"O - Great taste and light enough to session. Will definitely buy again."
"Balance of flavors is not quite right for me, but not a bad beer at all."
"Widmer Brothers Brewing Company--Pitch Black IPA--Smooth, Dark And Hoppy--Series 926--2011 12 oz. bottle. 6.50% ABV. 65 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) CDA--Cascadian Dark Ale.

Purchased 4-Pack for $7.99 at The Ballard Market, Seattle on 4/27/2011."
"Creamy mouthfeel, and quite dry. This drank much more like a porter than a hoppy black ale."
"What a taste! All sustained citrus sweetness (orange, grapefruit) with some pine, and a bitter finish. Very tasty, and one I'd seek out again."
"This is a good ABA to try, but as with what other Widmer offerings I've tried, not a beer to pick up with other beers readily available."
"O: I'm not too familiar with the style but this screams black ipa/cda. The color is pitch black but it's not thick enough to be a stout – and certainly not enough, if any barley malt. Very drinkable – but not as good as a couple others of this style that I've had. 3.0"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with good carbonation - just an easy drinking brew overall. A solid black IPA that I was glad I picked up and tried. Hope Widmer keeps brewing this one."
"O= if this stuff was $15 for a 25-ounce bottle and had a long German name (or dog and fish) youz guys'd be grabbing it off the shelves. Grab it if you can find it."
"Pours deep black with a decent amount of carbonation that forms a grayish head. The bubbles retreat revealing just a little bit of lace work and quarter-inch collar of foam. Complex aroma of cocoa, more subtle chocolate along with a touch of cedar and leather. Very smooth and thick on the tongue. Tastes nicely chocalately with some piney hops before a bitter finish. Hop bitterness lingers. I've liked hoppy and bitter dark ales since having my first Sierra Nevada Stout. I sort of see this beer as an IPA crossed with a schwarzbier and the result is tasty."
"I remember liking this better the first couple of times. Still it's worth a try for being interesting."
"Medium bodied, good carb. Liked this alot. Would drink again."
"Overall a very drinkable Black IPA but could use more piney hop smell and bitterness to become top tier."
"Thin almost watery in the mouth with some grainy courseness. This beer seems like it wants to be a souped up brown ale."
"Pours a pretty standard one finger head, I poured it pretty aggressively, it was fighting me, trying to not give me very much in the way of head. The head is just slightly off white, and is now almost gone, not surprising, considering it didn't give me much head. Decent lacing throughout, the body is black, that's for sure, but pitch black? No. There is clearly hints of red and brown in this beer, even when not directly held up to the light. Overall the beer looks ok-good, I have a problem with the seriously small head retention and the fact that it's not pitch black, but it's got a good look overall, nice lacing, plenty of bubbles still sticking around the rim and middle of the beer. The smell is very nice, it's got a very nice roasty smell to it, nice malt note, and a little hops. I've had an excellent black IPA before (Otter Creeks Alpine Black IPA), and I doubt this will be an excellent black IPA, it smells good and all, and it has all the necessary components for a good black IPA, it just doesn't seem as well balanced as the Otter Creek, and it's probably lacking in hops. We will see, it's a good smell, but comparing it to the other black IPA's I've had, it's only ok-good. Yeah the taste is exactly what I thought it would be, it's a really solid beer, but not as good as the other black IPA's I've had. It's not as smooth as some, and it doesn't have as much flavor. It's got a nice hop and malt flavor, but it's not as bold as it should be, and the taste is a little rough going down, like I said, not as smooth as the Otter Creek. I think the mouthfeel is what's making it not as smooth, too much carbonation. The balance on this beer isn't too bad, it's got a nice hop to malt ratio, which is critical in this style, it's just not enough flavor. If the balance is right it doesn't really matter if there isn't enough flavor. Overall a good beer, just not a great black IPA. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer at all, just not if I was presented with some of the other black IPA's I've had instead."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and one of the better ones that I have had from this brewery. The beer itself seems rather simple, like they took a good Schwarzbier recipe and changed it to American hops and bumped up the flavoring additions quite a bit. That is what you can expect with this beer, and I like it. Some people may be turned off by the malty balance in the finish, so it may be reminiscent of some American Brown Ales in that respect. Either way, this is a pretty good and I will enjoy the other three in the 4-pack."
"O - This is a pretty nice black ale. Another solid brew from Widmer Brothers."
"Dark chestnut brown with clear ruby highlights and a creamy chocolate milkshake head that leaves sheets of tan lace on the glass. The nose is tropical fruity hops and roasted malt in perfect harmony. Rich and roasty coffee-like Carafa malt and fruity hops are well balanced and pleasant. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. dry and chalky finish. I bought a few of these new Widmer IPA's on a whim and I am pretty impressed, the brewers at Widmer can make pretty darn good beer if they want too."
"Overall, a nice black IPA. Not as big as others in the style, but still flavorful enough, and well worth trying. Another good offering from Widmer, a brewery that seems to be on the rebound."
"Overall this is a good beer, a slightly different twist for the style with the cocoa. Glad i tried, definitely worth a shot."
"Pretty nice offering, and I am sure it is even better closer to the brewery. not much else that isn't already said above..."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a four-pack purchased at McKinnon's. Pours a nearly opaque black body with slight ruby-red highlights and a thin film of khaki-colored head. Grapefruit, pith, chocolate, coffee play equally in the aroma. Grapefruit, pith, orange, lemon, chocolate, and a bit of espresso. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Hoppy but balanced with dark malt flavors. Really good. One of the best Widmer beers I've had. I'd definitely buy this one again."
"This beer isn't flashy overly exciting, but it's very well balanced and strong across the board. Seeing as how I've been underwhelmed with most products from Widmer, I consider this to be an exceptional member of their line-up. I'll definitely be drinking more of these in the future."
"D: A good drinker, nothing stellar, but it works."
"My pint glass appears almost black with a creamy tan Stout style head. The nose is subtle molasses with some mild pine, citrus and floral notes. The taste is only mildly bitter with some herbal hop notes and a bit of banana on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and overall is very similar to a Porter. A dark IPA not so much as I think its a little light on the bitterness side, but American Black, maybe."
"The mouthfeel has a solid medium body. It is slightly creamy and oily. The hop oils leave a slick after feel. It is not unpleasing, but odd."
"Pours a rich black/ deep brown color with a thin off white head. Head dissipates into splotchy film on top of the beer. Slight smell of hops, buy what comes through most strongly is coffee. Taste is hoppy with hints of chocolate/coffee coming through. Mouthfeel feels right. Mild carbonation. Overall, this was surprisingly peasant, I wasn't sure what to expect from a ""black IPA"""
"A perfectly drinkable black ale - I agree with others that it's a little too roasty for the ""Black IPA"" denomination. Solid American black ale."
"O: Overall it really wasn't anything special. It was a good dark ale with a decent level of hops and bitterness. I would probably look for a better one but this one would be alright in a pinch."
"Those of us who never got the chance to try W '10 are grateful to Widmer Brothers from bringing it back in the form of Pitch Black IPA. This is a tasty little American black ale that is scratching my 'gotta have hops' itch this morning."
"Would drink this anytime."
"Yes, labeled as a Black IPA but all brewers should run with the re-named ""American Black Ale"" style and stay away from Black IPA all together. Regardless, very tasty and very easy to drink."
"12oz bottle with Feb 02 11on the bottom right corner. Pours a black color with brown hues and a thin layer of head that disappears quickly. Fair amount of lacing. Light citrus aroma along with some sweet coffee. Roasted malts as well. Taste has very little hop presence. Mostly tastes of coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malts. Not really getting any of the citrus I smelled. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Overall this beer is pretty average. Once is enough."
"Very nicely done."
"With all due respect, was out in Portland in early 2010 when this was rolled out, seemed better maybe fresher. The $6.99 sixer price was real nice to."
"D: An interesting, drinkable beer."
"D - Kind of boring. Respectable - I think it does what it's supposed to. It's just pretty boring overall, and I don't think I'd ever get this again. But I'm interested in the brewery. This is the first I've tried from them."
"I don't think I have tired a black IPA, and this was a good one to start with. It has a beautiful black and brown color while pouring, but pretty black in the glass. Has a cream colored head, pretty small. Smells like an IPA, very hoppy. Tastes like hops too. This is a really good beer. Even though it has a strong hops flavor, it aslo has nice coffee type aftertaste. I will definitely try this one again!"
"O- Overall, Pitch Black IPA is a solid beer worth checking out. I am a fan of the Black IPAs, and this one did not let me down."
"Overall a fairly average Black Ale. There are a few better ones available in Tidewater."
"Overall, a decent black IPA...a bit pricey at $9 for a 4 pack though."
"Pours nice and dark, nice two finger head that lasted about 1 minute to a minute and a half then dissipated to nice lace on the glass. Smell was citrus, hops, and a touch of floral at the end. Taste is well rounded, a great introduction to those not fond of hoppy beer. It has enough hops to please, but is well rounded for the beginner as well. Mouth feel was nice and smooth, medium bodied. Over all a pretty good beer, a nice one that both my wife (who has very different taste to mine) and I could both enjoy."
"Note: had this again from a bottle on 5/15/2012 and enjoyed it again; appearance was much better this time as it poured pitch black with a huge 2 finger foamy tan head that faded very slowly and left very good lacing with foamy rings as it went down; a nice looking beer from the bottle. It seemed hoppier as well, a roasted malt IPA comes to mind as the hops and roasted malts are equal parts in this nose and flavor, which was very good overall."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid pale and roasted malt scent. It's dry with a touch of earthiness. It has a wonderful citrus hop aroma. It's not over the top, but well integrated into aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has an earthy pale and black malt flavor. It's bitter, but on a mild level. The hop character is good. It goes down easy and finishes dry with a slight citrus hop edge. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer; well balanced with good hop character."
"I'd drink this again."
"D: The 6.3% ABV is nice and warming as the brew sits a while. The hops are a nice surprise for hopheads who might not be expecting to get their fix with this black ale. Of all the black IPAs that have recently swamped the market, Pitch Black actually makes an impression on me because it's basically a nice IPA in disguise. And from Widmer no less!"
"Fairly clean black IPA, refreshing. Lack of bold flavors made up by its drinkability."
"PROST!!!"
"Poured a blackish body with a large but quickly dying head that left some lace around glass. An airy hop aroma, light hopping, with minor sweet malts as the aroma unfortunately doesn't promise much at all. Easy to drink and smooth, there is a minor hop bitterness that lingers for a little flavor and then a touch of sticky sweet malts (mostly caramel and chocolate) and finishes w/ a soft, bitter dry edge. I enjoyed this beer but it's rather vanilla for this style and seems to be made for mass production/consumption."
"Had a great black color with a small little off white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of earthy hops and a little bit of malt in there. Tastes of earthy hops, and some malt and a little dog blanket or something. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation. Overall its a pretty nice rendition of style."
"Final thought - Widmer let's me down once again, guess I shouldn't have expectations"
"I've always enjoyed this particular black IPA, and I still do! Tasty, well-balanced, and easy-drinking, although it doesn't go too far to either extreme in the intensity of its roasty/hoppy flavors."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a solid beer but there are better ones within the style."
"The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but I thought it worked just fine, and the drinkability was quite good. A pretty good black IPA from Widmer, I rather enjoyed this one. Not worth killing yourself over, but worth a drink for sure."
"To me this was just an English IPA mixed with small amount of Schwarzbier or something similar."
"The 6.5% ABV seems a little light as this beer is packed full of flavor and body. While the thicker body does detract from the drinkability slightly, the great flavor makes up for it."
"Bottle marked Feb0211-07:52-WA. It pours into my classic early 90's era Widmer pint glass. Sampled on March 14, 2011. The color is dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light with a small but long lasting beige head. It has all the aroma of a decent IPA, full of hops. The body texture comes in at about medium. The taste is vibrantly hopped with a sharp almost sour tingle on my tongue. Nicely done."
"Pours black with a foamy, airy head. The nose is fruity with the hops dominating - (maybe cascade?). Moderate, slightly oily mouthfeel. It tastes of roasted malts and maybe a little chocolate and finishes with defined hop character. I've recently gotten into black IPAs and this is one of the better ones so far."
"Goes down easy and is tasty. I could definitely have a couple"
"Feels light and well carbonated in the mouth. Pretty drinkable, but nothing spectacular,"
"D: Its a good brew - definitely not as aggressive as other Black IPAs out there, though (although, I see that Ba has this listed as an American Black Ale - not the Cascadian Dark / Black IPA). Its not too ""in your face," which helps drinkability, but the blandness leaves something to be desired."
"As with most Widmer Bros. beers, this one is on the right track, but better flavored hops and a more malty-rich body would compensate nicely for the aspects of the beer that have unnecessary bite and lack of intrigue."
"I really kind of enjoy this beer, but am unsure how much I would want of this beer. The bitterness is nice and the dark malts provide a nice balance, but better examples of this style exist."
"D - I like it overall; it's easy drinking, though definitely not a stunner."
"Notes: A decent ABA, but not my favorite. Shows a little more dark roast than I want in a beer that's actually labeled ""Black IPA."" Just call it a Black Ale and it would score a bit better."
"It's certainly a step above Magic Hat's example but nowhere near the Hill Farmstead or Stone examples I've had. If you don't want to be socked in the face by an overload of citrusy hops, then this will probably work for you. It's not Blackwatch but it'll do in a pinch."
"Good drinkability but it could be more flavorful."
"Definitely something sessionable for fans of the black IPA; maybe not the best representation of the style, but still great."
"I like this a lot. This is what most examples of the style should be. Probably the best ""Black IPA"" that I have had. Something I would recommend."
"This is a hop forward brew with a well-balanced toastiness...perfect for the winter or cold weather. Pairs great with a spicy bean stew and/or a severe snow storm."
"Picked up a couple of these in a mixed sixer at Lukas a couple days back. Poured jet black, with a mocha colored head. Aromas of piney hops and some light roasted malts. On the palate this one is fairly light bodied and easy to drink. Flavors of pine, lightly roasted malt and coffee. A very enjoyable black ipa."
"Herbal, peppery hop flavors are found as this beer first hits my tongue and the finish has a lingering pine-like flavor. Citrus oil and grapefruit zest linger on the tongue in the long finish. The malt is a touch more noticeable in the flavor than it was in the nose; this has a smooth malty finish with some dark grain notes and perhaps even a touch of cocoa. It is interesting how the dark malt plays up the herbal and hop pine flavors (at least compared to a standard IPA). The body has a certain creamy quality to it, but this is definitely a beer with a good quaffability quotient. A back-drop of citrus and a hint of lychee anchor the hop notes along with a smooth, not overly aggressive bitterness. Nice, this is definitely an enjoyable brew"
"D: This beer is not a particularly noteworthy contribution to its style, but then most others of its peer-group come across as exceptionally crafted brews. While some of the flavors detected here are genuinely interesting for the style, Widmer fails to bring all of the qualities together into a refined final product. A good black IPA should, in the end, be greater than the sum of its disparate parts, and this one is not."
"A: Dark brown with ruby hues visible, thin head and minor to no lacing - 3.25, S: Some interesting aromas involving what I perceive as lemongrass, there is also a good deal of charring and some faint melon of all things, citrus is present but muted - 3.50, T: Lots of dark speciality malts and a solid hop bitterness, coffee grounds and grapefruit - 3.50, M: Mouth feel is medium though borders on thin, quite slick while still having a hint of grittiness - 3.00, D: A drinkable dark IPA, quite good - 3.50"
"So, it's not a traditional IPA. It is still a great beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass, black in color with some reddish tints. Head is one finger, offwhite and dissipates quickly to crown the beer. Minimal lacing. Hop aroma is present on the nose, with some slight citrusy hints. Flavor has more citrus but not a wham bam hit of hops. Feel is good and crisp, not a lot of oiliness, but nice nonetheless. Definitely drinkable and something I'll pick up again."
"Black or white, this is an average IPA, and an average beer regardless of moniker.. Drinks like a lightly hopped black ale."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer as a new twist on one of my perferred styles. It is hard not to compare this to traditional IPA's but it is a new style by itself according to the GABF (i.e. American Style India Black Ale or Cascadian Dark). This would appear to be a great IPA type beer to drink during the cooler months as it offers a slight bit more character and darker color than a typical IPA."
"On tap at the Dig Pub in Cedar Park (Austin). Gotta say I was a little skeptical when they told me about this beer, but I decided to give it a go. It looks like your classic stout: black w/ a thick, tan head. However, raising the glass the first time, it smelled mildly of citrus and hops. You know, like an IPA. hmmm.. Tasted grapefruit and moderate hops up front fading to a piney character. Left with moderate hops and possibly a mild roasted barley flavor (appearance skewing my perception??).. Will have to try again. In fact, I'm craving one now."
"pitch black is one cool looking beer. it smells like a weak IPA not anything special but still usually hop citrus. the taste is a bit sweet and little bit syrupy like that is okay but boring no real taste from the malts either. this beer could be better but it is very drinkable and enjoyable on it's own."
"Pours first deep copper then goes to a pretty opaque black with a frothy off white head that leaves behind some minimal lacing. The roasted malt and some small bit of aroma hops are there on the nose. Deep fruit flavours, and less hops than I thought for a ""Black IPA"" They are there but just not in the amount that I was expecting. Taste some vanilla and unfermenters on the after taste. Dont know if any of you homebrew but the after taste is kind of the sweet taste of the unfermented wort just before the yeast. Good not great but a great session beer."
"If reviewing to style, appearance score should suffer, right?"
"I've been wanting to try this for awhile and I am not disappointed. But, I am also not overwhelmed either. The Cascade hops are noticable on the aroma and the taste. Juicy citrus...moreo f a roasted matliness than the a burnt black malt bill....it blends nicely...finishes with a light dry bitterness on the finish...this is a nice change of pace beer and I'll probably buy it again but it is not one I sit here sipping and saying to myself ""wow this is awesome""...good...not great..."
"D: A nice, easy drinking IPA; somewhat of a pleasant surprise"
"Not quite pitch black until it fills the glass. Large tan head forms and has good retention. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. Plenty of citrus hop aroma. Smells like a straight up IPA. Not getting much from the darker malt. And the taste is the same way. More of a non-descript pale ale rather than an exciting dark beer. Nice flavor for what it is but I wanted something more. Plenty of citrus flavor and a little caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate. The body is also nice but not as big as I would like it to be. Good carbonation and smooth feel. Has good qualities but rather boring especially for a proclaimed Black IPA."
"It reminds me of Mendicino's Black Eye Stout, a brew I was particularly fond of."
"A definite winner. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark ales, porters, and hops."
"Pretty medium bodied and not harsh on your palate. It's a good beer, but nothing to rave home about."
"Drinkability is solid. this really reminds me of another IPA I've had in the past, but can't quite put my finger on it. A good, well rounded IPA with a bit of added character from the dark malts. I'm not completely sold, but I'd definitely consider picking up another sixer of this one - something I don't usually say with it comes to Widmer."
"D: Big, flavoring hops and big tasty malts. Seems to balance - it works."
"The mouthfeel is not heavy with a pleasant carbonation. I'd say this beer would be a nice session brew if you are a fan of IPAs but don't want to be blasted with a hop flamethrower. A tasty beer."
"Overall impression - watery and flavorless. Ended up dumping it down the drain and poured a Short's Huma-Lupa-Licious instead."
"Poured a deep black with good carbonation and a nice tannish. Nose is citrus, black malt. Taste is citrus, black malt, roasted. Mouthfeel has a nice citrus, floral and booze feel, just right on hop bitterness. Very drinkable and one of the best Black IPAS I have had."
"4.26.10 327pm JDH"
"I drank some more tonight just to validate yesterday's research and I'm sticking to my guns on my findings."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. This a good beer. Never really heard of a black IPA, but it works. I really enjoy drinking this beer."
"Pours dark brown with a hint of reddish color, enormous head that is quite nice, and the head is quite creamy in texture also. Nose is full of citrus. On the palate there's a big chocolately malty flavor going on initially and then the bitter hops rush in to steal the show. Finish has a nice interplay of the malt and bitter hop flavors."
"Nice to more examples of this Cascadian style as I was intrigued by Phillips Skookum Ale that used to be called IDA. This beer pours almost black with a big white head. The nose is hoppy at first but soon the malts come out to play. The taste is an IPA PNW style backed up with lots of dark malt. Very food friendly and a nice change from the big hop/ grapefruit parade of IPAs from around here. Could have been more complex but still a cool seasonal from Widmer."
"Tastes balanced as well, the hops come through more than the malts but it is seriously a well balanced beer."
"Pours a matte black color with a reddish tint. Nice tan head becomes a thick film. Very mild aroma of roasted malts. Nice roasted malt flavor with good hop spicyness. Some bitterness at the finish and into the aftertaste. Fairly constant carbonation, a bit on the strong side. Medium-bodied and smooth. The flavor is simple but tasty. Something like a porter meets IPA. Good session beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Has a nice piney citrus smell. A hint of malt but faint. Excellent lacing! Looks wonderful in the glass! Has a nice hoppiness to it. A slightly dry maltiness. A calm smooth feel in the mouth. The hoppiness lingers well after drinking. Feels warm on the way down. More than I expected for 6.5. I have to say it's a really nice change from a normal IPA. I actually like it a lot. 7.99 a 6er here in mn. A nice bargin on a budget."
"Overall, a good but not great AIPA. Only had a few black IPA's now and this one is in the bottom tier of those. Interesting to try one but won't be making the rotation. Maybe on-tap if best option over BMC. [N;BO;OTR]"
"This is a standard IBA with a light, and thankfully subdued, roasted character. Drinkable and visually appealing."
"D: Very drinkable, a nice change of pace for people who still want hops but different than an IPA."
"While more mild than other Cascadian Dark Ales, the flavor is crisp and good. Not an Imperial ala Sublimely Self Righteous, in terms of hops or alcohol, but very pleasant. Probably the best Widmer beer I have had actually. Lighter to medium in body with a nice full carbonation keeping things lively. Surprisingly tasty, I could settle down into a six pack of these for a fair price. Happy to see Widmer experimenting with positive results!"
"This was like a good - not great - IPA. If drinking this blindfolded, I'd probably not have guessed it was a black IPA. Do I care? Not really. I'd definitely drink this again at this price."
"An interesting beer. Pours very dark brown/black with an off-white head. Head could have lasted a bit longer. Creamy mouthfeel, almost as if it came from a nitrogen tap. Mild hop aroma with nice citrus notes. Taste is good with decent hop bitternessqnd a slight metallic tang. A very drinkable beer."
"Picked up a sixer of this to try, pleasantly surprised. Very drinkable, lots of pine aroma. Not much roasted flavor to it for a black IPA, but still quite tasty."
"drinkability - it's a fairly smooth and easy beer, not too complex, semi refreshing"
"After tasting this beer, I instantly remember drinking it earlier this year. A very distinctive taste that one just can't get out of his head. The malt hits your eyes first. After the pour I was excited that I might be drinking something similar to 1554, but upon first taste, you know that within the dark liquid an IPA definitely lies. The hops are in certain balance with the malt which one can only dream tastes delightful. however it was more confusing to my palate than anything. The finish was both clean and dirty. I had this beer last night, and can still not put my finger on whether I liked it or not."
"Dark brown opaque body, one finger off-white head, medium dissipation with some lacing present. The nose is roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, with grassy hops. Taste replicates the nose, but I picked up more roasted malts and esp. chocolate than I did in the bottled version. A bit of bitter hops on the backend, but fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel was full and surprising dry finish.Not a great session beer, a bit heavy to do 3 or 4. I prefer this to the bottled version, FWTW."
"D: This is an ok IPA. I've had some really tasty black IPAs recently and this one stacks up as just above average. I was hoping that you would be able to taste the roasted malts more. Others that I've had only have the cascade hop show up in the finish so that you get a nice coffee malt flavor before the hop kicks in."
"D: This is an interesting twist on the IPA. I like the extra complexity, but the acidity was a little too prevalent. A nice beer overall."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, I would have another. A great beer to have on a budget. I would be interested in trying it on tap however to see if any other flavors would come out. Definitely give it a try."
"D: Average offering, run of the mill AIPA. Whatevz."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Some slickness on the palate, but still nice and clean. Balance seems good, though, I was expecting a little more of an appearane from the roasted malts. You get a little hint of them in the aroma and with the dry grainy finish, but I wouldn't call them a significant player in this beer. The subtlety is probably a good thing, though, because if they were a lot stronger it would be two strong flavors battling for attention. Good beer, certainly could be a session candidate."
"I recommend the W '10... Cheers!"
"Quite nice. Easy drinking and well balanced. I'd get this one again."
"D: A solid brew, not something I think I'll revisit though. A good place to try this new style."
"D - Very drinkable. Refreshing, and no dominating flavors (not a hop crazy IPA)."
"Interesting beer. Worth seeking out"
"Pitch black IPA is not pitch black. That's really disappointing. When held up to my 450 Watt Light Source, I can see bloody red streaking. Nice aroma though. Mix of dark malts and resiny hops. Upon tasting I realize at once, this is no Alpha Klaus. But then again, not many reach that standard of Black IPA. This is actually quite good tough. Nice roasted, chocolatey tones. IPA traits are actully fairly muted, but citrusy in nature. Medium bodied and really quite flavorful and drinkable. Give me some roast suckling pig and a pint or two of this and I'm good to go."
"D: Eh... not a big fan of this. I don't get the ""black"" IPA thing.... roast flavors don't make much sense here."
"Notes - By far the best beer I've had from Widmer to date. It's the only black IPA I've had, so it's unique as far as I'm concerned. It's somewhat like Arrogant Bastard, but with a more porter-like malt profile. I wouldn't recommend it for a hardcore hophead, it's more for someone who likes balance but wants to get into hoppier beers."
"This beer definitely keeps you guessing and is a very good value. In the end, I would have preferred a more hoppy concentration in a black IPA but I can understand why this would have won a gold medal."
"D - Very drinkable IPA. Nothing spectacular, but good nonetheless. The roasted malts add a nice demension of flavor to an otherwise ordinary IPA. The alcohol is hidden, and the abv isn't so high that you can only have one in a night."
"Ive been really diggin this beer. Black pale ale, hilarious! Pretty much what I would expect. Very hoppy in the nose, with some roast malt character. Hops carry on in the finish and mingle well with the slightly sweet and reastrained roast malt profile. I really like it. Easy to drink and covers lots of bases."
"D- Initially I think of this as a utility micro. Good for many meal choices, or a party with hours d ovres of many styles. Hoppy and malty doesnt match it with any particular food, but makes it a choice for any."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise from the Brothers. I find most Widmer brews to be understated to the point of being almost dull, but this beer is certainly worth your time."
"Very interesting beer. Can't remember having a beer this hoppy, but still with a roasted malt flavor."
"drinkability: very sessionable and in general just a refreshing new twist on a classic style. reccommended."
"I would imagine this would be tough to nail as it needs the juicy hoppiness of a west coast IPA without a whole lot of specialty malt influence. It does just that as this is a hop-forward beer with a thin enough body to not jump into the realm of hoppy porter or stout. There is some roasty, toasty malt presence and amazingly does not get in the way of the lupulin. There is also a nice mix of flavoring and bittering hops that are an influence from start to finish. Not the best IPA out there for sure, but it is fun to drink and tastes nice and fresh. I will definitely buy at least one more sixer of this. Good job Widmer brothers!"
"Overall this was certainly worth a try, although probably not one I'd return to on a regular basis."
"The beer pours black with a cream-colored head. The aroma is piney hops with some roasted malts. The flavor is mainly piney hops, but there is some citrus hops in there as well. There is also a roasted malt backbone which is very interesting. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The combination of tasty hop flavors and a subtle, easy-drinking mouthfeel make Black Pitch terribly drinkable. Highly recommended."
"D- A decent black IPA. The flavor is on the lighter side, but I could easily have a few of these over the course of a night."
"You buy now!"
"D - Drinkability is good due to the crisp body, but I don't need more than one."
"I wish I saw more Schwarzipas. This is a fun hybrid. One of the best Widmer Brother's brews I've had."
"Verdict: This is essentially a solid, highly drinkable American IPA with just a little more malt intensity. Imminently satisfying, there's something about this beer that I just love."
"This was a pleasant surprise from Widmer. I'm not a big fan of all of the new black (D)IPAs and still found this beer quite enjoyable. There's a healthy if restrained roasted/chocolate malt note. The hops are floral and piney, strong but not harsh. It's quite dry, which is very good for this sub-style. It's a creamy, rich beer that drinks bigger than its abv. I assume this beer is a limited edition, which is really a shame as it's quite good."
"Nice smell to it with citrus dominating. Initially I wasn't sold on this but as it warmed over the 15-20 minutes that I drank it, it really grew on me. It moved from starting out as a highly hopped porter to a darkened ipa. Good bitterness but not overpowering. Overall i would buy a sixer of it again."
"Drinkability is pretty good, not great though...basically a hoppy porter that's not sweet. Did I mention I'm still not totally sold on the whole CDA thing?"
"Other comments: Love this beer! Should be one of the hallmarks of the burgeoning Cascadian Dark Ale style."
"D-This beer goes down quite well. And if sipped on, one could session this easily. I think I'll get some more actually. I got this in a make your own 6'er and I want more. I would suggest this to any hop lover like me. CHEERS!"
"Pours a dark brown-black color. Good thick coffee colored head. It dissipates quickly, but it leaves a good lace. Smells of floral hops, a bit of citrus. The malt sneaks in a bit on the finish of the smell, with a roasty smell. The taste is where this gets interesting. Starts off with the hoppy bitterness. Floral mostly. A bit of citrus, but not much. Then the malt kicks in with authority. Lots of roasty, toasty goodness. None of the flavors ever become overwhelming, they balance out relatively well. The main detraction from this one is it is a bit thin on the mouthfeel. One would expect a bit of a fuller beer. But its quite drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very unique beer. I liked how creamy the beer was for an IPA. It was just weird to see the malts and the hops battle it out. It is definitely worth a try. Pretty drinkable as well."
"It took me a few bottles into my sixer to come to appreciate this beer, but I'm liking it more and more. It has more hops than many IPAs out there, and mixes it up with some of the dark flavors without overdoing it. Great job with a hard brew to pull off, Widmer! Enjoy this one fresh to get the full effect of its excellent hops."
" Body is full and a tocuh creamy, especially on the swallow. Overall, a great example of the Cascadian Dark Ale style. Now if they'd only put that description on the bottle..."
"I don't think I'd buy this again. It was a nice party favor but not something I'd choose over SN or any other fine session IPAs I can get."
"Really dark brownmore than black but that was the least of my complaints. It smelled weird, sort of hoppy and then brown ale. The taste was more of the same, mostly dark malts with a slight bit of hops, like a hoppy brown ale but not an IPA as far as my tastebuds are concerned. Still, not a bad beer but not a true black IPA like Stone 11."
"12 oz single, carrying on my tradition of having all the 'w"" series beers. Appearance, black beer luscious tan head. smart and handsome! Aroma is mainlly of hops though the malt breadiness is there in the back. Taste well this is somthing quite unique, actually quite stong hopping as expected from a PNW IPA, then the hop biterness is somehow accented by bitter -sweet roasted maltiness with a slight hint of bread. Very nice on the palte thick and intrest holding..very bitter aftertaste lingers for some time. Overall an excellent beer from the brothers. I think they need to make this a regular winter seasonal."
"Enjoyed the beer alot, would have another but not a session beer."
"This beer is fantastic! Well rounded with astoundingly awesome balance. I will be picking up more of this beer, loved it!"
"D- goes down easily, won't kill your tastebuds or fill you up immediately either... a pretty solid release by Kurt and Rob, and an excellent gateway into an interesting style"
"All in all a drinkable beer. I don't think the darkness adds much to it, in fact I think it is reminiscent of the Broken Halo IPA. I'd have expected a black IPA to be a bigger beer, and less drinkable."
"D-This very drinkable. At 6.5% ABV it is at the lighter end for an IPA. Well done."
"The Widmer Pitch Black IPA pours like a swartzbier with a thick, creamy off white froth, good lacing, & good retention. Hoppy aromas of freshcut grass, grapefruit, orange peel, spiced/noble hops, slight smokiness, & bitter chocolate flacks that follow through as flavors on the palates along with a definite hop bitterness (good balance), creamy texture, & long finish. Overall, this is a fantastic beer & one that I'd highly recommend!"
"Overall: Very good. Surprisingly very good. It's not wildly complex in terms of hops or malt, but they picked the right flavors to showcase. Good malt flavor that still let's the hop flavor shine through."
"Very solid flavor profile on this Black IPA, with a touch of black patent malts adding some roast and dark chocolate notes. The hops steam-roll in for the finish to add a piny bitterness that smacks with resin and grapefruit peel. Slight warmth from the alcohol, too. Great mouthfeel, with a medium body and a well-designed, low carbonation level that adds just enough bubbliness to liven up the back of the palate. W'10 is one of the better releases from Widmer as of late, and I very much look forward to the rest of my six-pack."
"Overall: An easy drinking IPA that helps define this seemingly new style of IPA. The body is what I find most lacking with this brew, I'd like to see more richness here. It's worthy to a hop lover but don't expect to be bowled over by this one. That being said, the more I drink this beer the more I like it. It's very well rounded and while the mouthfeel isn't the biggest it's an IPA that doesn't disappoint on the hops. If I didn't hate the word ""drinkability"" so much, I'd say this W'10 rates high on that list."
"- Overall this beer is the best I have ever had from Widmer, and wish this was year around. This is certainly my go to beer for as long as it can be."
"There is a mild, very smooth drinkability to this IPA. The finish is crisp and the hops leave a nice dry twang. Very drinkable and really enjoyed this one. Another great season for Widmer."
"taste is creamy, pine, a touch of coffee, grapefruit, some caramel, malt, and a touch of cocoa, ends a little dry and nicely bitter."
"overall a decent brew. I don't know if I like the competing roast/citrus notes, but nevertheless a solid offering by widmer."
"An enjoyable pint worth repeating."
"I've just found a six pack at the store and will be trying the bottled version tomorrow."
"4.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
