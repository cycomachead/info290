"Pours pitch black with a thin foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are mild.  Has a malty, licorice, raisin aroma.  Smooth, silky taste.  Can definitely taste licorice, maybe some slight chocolate and raisins.  You can definitely detect the booziness.  It has a slightly astringent aftertaste with some hoppy bitterness.  Good beer, but not much of a black licorice fan."

"Overall, what a great way to commemorate one year on the market.  Their standard Hoppy Feet did wonders for advancing the style of “American Black Ale”, or however you feel comfortable calling it.  It showcases a dense malt base with a floating crown of fresh hoppiness.  Here, we truly get the enhanced version of this, although it is most noticeable in the bitterness and depth of the flavor profile.  They also take the abv through the roof, and just a pint of this 10.0% beast can send an advocate reeling.  Despite this, the beer drinks with a definite smoothness, allowing you every opportunity to appreciate the flavors as they continually drift by the taste buds.  It is nice that Clown Shoes appreciates their roots, but even nicer that they take care of the consumer by literally building off their prior successes to offer something even better.  Good on you, Clown Shoes."

"This bipa pours a very near black color with a generous tan head that lasts well into the pour and leaves very substantial lacing. The aroma was far maltier than I had expected for an imperial black ipa. The same can be said for the flavor; although that was more complex with notes of vanilla and coffee present. Overall, this one seemed closer to porter or even stout than black ipa. Would have enjoyed a hoppier presence like its little brother Hoppy Feet."

"Outlived my expectations."

"Intense... There is nothing subtle about this beer. If you like the clashing of two worlds, this beer is most certainly for you. Whether you're a hophead or you prefer to indulge in sweet malts, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with this. I highly recommend picking this one up, and I also recommend bringing a friend along for the ride. Attempting to tackling a bottle of this, alone, is madness."
"Overall: My first Black IPA, and I wasn't disappointed. It's strong in both the malt and hops department, and they're blended together very well. Great beer, will buy again."
"Smooth and a really great drinking ale over all, for the alcohol content, it’s well hidden."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a nice dark brown foamy head with medium retention and not much lacing. Aroma consists of bitter roasted malt with some dry hoppy notes. Taste is also dominated by bitter roasted malt with quit a powerful dry hoppy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. I thought this was a bit too dry IMHO."
""
""
""
""
"I like my black ales hoppy, and this one falls a little short. Even the maltiness is evened out too much, despite having good character and potential. I've never had the regular Hoppy Feet to know what this beer is really trying to accomplish, but still it makes its mark. Not fantastic, but solid nonetheless."
"Intense and unforgiving black in color. Just the faintest hint of light peeks through this brew when held up to the light. Not much head on this beer. Massive aroma of Pacific Northwest hops combined with roasted malt, plums, raisins, and black licorice. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and sticky. Flavor is an initial wallop of hop bitterness followed closely by roasted malt, fig, raisins, and plum. The aftertaste hastily returns back to a strong, bitter hop fade. An epic roller coaster for your palate that will delight those seeking dark,bitter beers. My first clown shoes brew, but when I travel I will seek out their other brews (as they don't distribute in MO."

"Overall this is quite a solid beer that I thoroughly enjoyed sipping. It was hard getting through the 22oz bomber by myself but that is just because this thing is a beast of a brew at 10% abv."
""
""
"Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet black IPA was a favorite of mine @ the GLB. So tasty and perfect IMHO. So I decided to give this a try. It poured from the bottle an impressive dark color/head. The nose was really nice. Sipping revealed the booziness of this brew which unfortunately seemed to mask much of the flavor. But I enjoyed sipping on this nevertheless."
""
"O: Pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is great. Sometimes with these big black IPAs I find the hop flavors muddled in the background and can't really differ them from a really hoppy imperial porter. This is a straight mash up of bright IPA hop flavor and IBUs with delicious roasted malts. The nose was a little pungent with the alcohol but the taste was more smooth, a little hot though. Great beer, will continue to enjoy more."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/20/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, orange rind, cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, floral, pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops and roasted malt notes; with nice strength. Taste of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, orange rind, cocoa, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, floral, pine, toast, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, cocoa, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, floral, pine, toast, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent black IPA! All around great balance and complexity of hop and roasted malt flavors with huge robustness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: black ipas are quite hard to perfect I have to give them credit they did make a 10 percent taste pretty darn good but there are a few things they could improve upon. Would I buy it again. Depends on my mood but as far as normal beers go I commend clown shoes for there experimentation and might have to try some of there more classic beers to see how this brewery overall standing is"

"An eye-popping black IPA. Good complexity and nicely balanced throughout. Hops and malts hit you first and the tingling then soothing alcohol warmth lingers on at the finish."

"Quality control, Please!"
"F-Quick bitterness on the end leaving evidence of hops, roast and alcohol in its wake"
""
"Overall, this is a great ABA. This style has been pretty popular lately and this is a good take on it. The roasted notes are extremely well balanced with the piney hop notes."
""
""
"The black ale is decent enough, though for me, black IPA's are a very touchy style. Easily hit or miss, though this is one of the few that falls in between. It's far from bad, but the palate wrecking that happens sooner than halfway through the glass is enough to bog down the drinkability like a two ton weight. This would be perfect in 4-6 oz. serving sizes. Anything more is tough."

"O: I imagined a beer like Hoppy Feet, but I got a completely different animal – I love it. If you see it, buy it."
"Overall: A very unique beer! This is more citrusy than their clementine beer!! The only black IPA that can beat this would, perhaps, be fresh escondidian IPA."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that packs a bit more of an alcohol kick but otherwise is almost indistinguishable from regular Hoppy Feet in my opinion."

"Overall, a very nice Cascadian Black Ale from Clown Shoes. Tasty and well crafted."

"Great brew by Clown Shoes. As a true hophead, this was a great mix of styles."

"O: If someone had told me this is a belgian stout I would have believed them. Not as hoppy as reg hoppy feet, more body, more roasty. Pretty interesting beer, heavy on the chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"Due to the alcohol, a sipper for sure. Not bad, but probably a little better when fresh: the bitterness may counteract some of the sweet alcoholic flavors. Not sure if I would have another."

"O: 4.75 - I dig everything going on here, especially in a style that I don't particular like; I tend to prefer roastier dark beers like RIS and porters, and, I wonder, if the age on this beer with the high ABV is increasing the appeal for me; regardless, I'd be curious to try this one fresh but it has definitely piqued my interest in v1.0 as well"

"Overall I've enjoyed it. It wasn't anything I'll be going out of my way to get in the future but that being said it was certainly above average and a great way to end a long day."

"O: I liked this beer but I think Hoppy Feet regular is a little more subtle and thus complex -- the big roast of 1.5 masks and/or blunts a lot of the nuances that I like in Hoppy Feet original. Not a bad beer and worth a try."
""
""
"A pitch black brew with a big foamy light brown head and unfailing blankets of lacing. The aroma delivers some nutty malt along with a bit of alcohol that makes for a little dishwater edge, so the aroma sort of cancels into a ""wash", pardon the pun. The flavor surprises with a fruity malt combo that offers a very interesting hop brew with nutty edges, grass and pine hops and even some bubblegum. This is a medium bodied brew with tiny carbonation that winds up in a mellow, smooth feeling delivery that is overall an enjoyable concoction to celebrate their first anniversary of delicious brewing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown to black with little to no light showing through the glass. One to two fingers of head at pour persists nicely with some lacing present. Smell is hoppy yet malty - sweet with chocolate and a hint of smoke. Good flavoring - dark & chocolate malts are present up front giving way to a nice bitter finish."

"This Clown Shoes beer has an onyx appearance, topped with a sticky froth, appearing biscuit-y in color, not unlike cafe-au-lait. As I draw in the aroma, the bouquet of citrus flavors that springs forth is astounding. Extended contemplation of the nose finds a notable presence of figs, raisins, coffee beans, and cherries...all interwoven in the mix. The taste teases my palate with an initial, syrupy molasses, only to overwhelm it an instant later with a sharp, yet floral bitterness reminiscent of pine. The mouth feel is moderate, and surprisingly, the beer does not seem to coat the inside of my mouth excessively. The alcohol heat is minimal, but the sensation once swallowed is filling. The finish is quite dry, and hints at having a dash of licorice within, accompanied by a pleasurable tingling. Overall, this beer is very gratifying, honing in on many of my preferred craft beer flavors. This experience mirrors my others with Clown Shoes- great job once again!"

"O: Overall a burnt bitterness of pine and chocolate with a 10%abv that is well played and hidden. Hoppy and bitter though flavor is somewhat shallow in hop complexity and wished it showed more variance."

"I am very pleased with this beer. Insanely complex and the flavors mesh well together. Happy new year!"

"A fair beer thats pretty decent all in all but misses the mark a bit."
"O: A very solid Black IPA and a beer that I really enjoyed - rich roasted malt flavors combined with fresh hops. Definitely one to grab if you come across it. Easy to drink and the alcohol is very well hidden in it - I could not believe that it was a 10% beer."
""
""

"Well worth checking out at least once for a better than average ABA IMO."

"Dark bodied beer. Chocolate brown head with good retention. Aroma is quite nice and typical of a well done Black IPA. Chocolate and roast mix with juicy hops. Nice. Flavor foundation is layed down quite nicely with the chocolate/caramel malts. Hop notes of pine and citrus accent nicely. Moderately carbonated and medium to medium-full bodied. For 10%, the alcohol is well hidden. Quite solid."
""
"O - a great-looking beer that is complex in both nose and taste. Definitely a nice sipper for a winter night. Would love to get a fresh bottle."
""
"Hardly exceptional!"
"Pours a midnight black with a finger of that black ale mocha tone foam. Good lacing, moderate retention. Smells of hops, chocolate, coffee, butterscotch, some citrus, and some earth tones. Caramel malts compose the backbone, smells nice and sweet. Faint odor of alcohol present, well concealed for 10%. Tastes of bitter chocolate hop, finish is very complex with a bitter floral coffee taste that hangs around for the after taste, alcohol concealed quite well. The feel is as strong as the rest of the beer, full bodied, thick and creamy. Overall a great beer, doing black ipas a great justice. Happy birthday clown shoes"
"Overall: A very good imperial Black Ale. Bold in both the hops and dark roasted malts. A truly ""Black"" Ale."

"I've been craving a Black IPA recently, and this is the biggest one I've seen since Stone's 15th. This beer pours a ""pitch brown"" color with a finger of head that quickly recedes to the end of the glass. The aroma is a nice piney hop over a very strong caramel, chocolate, and roasted malt base. The taste really skews pretty close to a lighter bodied imperial stout with a strong hop dose coursing through every bit. The malt bill is very intense here, offering huge roast and chocolate flavors that course over the very oily hops. It's very big and maybe a little too brash, with it almost feeling like a tug-of-war between the hops and the malts, with a different side winning every sip."

"Poured black into the glass with a 1.5"" rich thick khaki foam head that was persistent and left considerable sheets of lace. Very attractive. Citrus pith, resin, dark chocolate and coffee aroma. Smells delicious and yes, this is tasty. Coffee and semi sweet chocolates intermingled with citrus and resin hop are the predominant flavors. There is a pleasant roasted toffee malt presence in the background. Sweetness early on the palate is washed away by a solid dose of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel and body remind that this is a black DIPA and not a hoppy imperial stout. Medium with zesty carbonation. Alcohol shows up a little bit in the finish, along with ample bitterness reminiscent of black coffee, baker's chocolates, resin and citric pith hops. Good stuff."
""
""
"A delicious ""black IPA."" This could almost be considered an extremely hoppy imperial stout. I am a fan of this flavor."
""
"Not hoppy enough where it counts. If you're going to make a 10% BDIPA you need to hide and integrate the alcohol better."
""
""

"OVERALL: The Lamar Woodley of IPAs. A big, bruising black IPA with bold flavors and a present, but not distracting alcohol content."
"Super smooth for what it is. Nice."
""
"O= This is a well balanced black ale. My first dabble with the brewery and this isn't bad. I am a little underwhelmed with this being the first anniversary. It's nothing crazy and wonderful but it's a solid beer."
"Pours very dark with a 1.5 finger head, pine and chocolate prominent in the aroma. Syrupy mouthfeel, subdued piney hop flavor up front with roasted malt and bitter chocolate following and a lingering bitterness in the finish. Based on the description of the beer as a double black IPA I'd say that the hops have faded over time, the bottle is well over a year old at this point. Overall still a good beer, but probably a whole lot better when fresh."
"O: it’s a unique brew, but I think the balance is off. Its very bold in taste, but the complexity is lacking and I feel that my taste buds are pulled differnet ways with each sip making it average at best."
""
"Pours a dark kola hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and lacing everywhere very nice looking,the smell is piney and citrus hops,sherbet and disinfectant,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated with tastes of grapefruit,piney bitter hops and i mean piney,mandarins,blood oranges,boiled candy and finished with a mouthpuckering sherbet bitterness and overall i love it the high ABV is well hidden and its very drinkable would buy again without hesitation cheers."
"I love Hoppy Feet, but I was a little disappointed with the 1.5 version. Beautiful dark color, with coffee and bitter chocolate, but no hoppiness to speak of. This tasted like a really good Imperial Stout, but not what I was expecting. I honestly thought they may have mislabeled a bottle of Vampire Slayer! I probably would have rated it very highly if it had been labelled a stout, but for a black IPA, I'll just get the original Hoppy Feet for about $3 less per bottle."

""
"Overall: This to me is the best of both worlds in that it is combining a stout and an IPA. I love the melding of flavors in the two styles and the end result is very enjoyable. A sipping beer for me but dangerously so because of the alcohol being so well disguised. I like this beer!"
"O: I like this beer more than the regular version, that is for sure. It's well balanced, has good flavors, and it's a sipper. This is something I'd buy again if I were in the mood."
""
""
"I believe a bomber runs about $6-7, which in my opinion is a small price to pay for such a wonderful taste of antithesis, that is, the deep black and the light crisp bite of hops. Enjoy at room temperature or chilled, either way is good."

"22oz bottle with Bottled 2/2012 on the side. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of frothy tan head. Tons of lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, citrus, smoke and earth. The flavor is a nice mix of smokey roasted malts, orange and dark chocolate. I can't believe this brew is 10%. Really drinkable. Lightly carbonated with a creamy mouthfeel. Balanced and delicious. This beer certainly is an improvement on Hoppy Feet, which I also liked alot. Overall, worth seeking out."

"22floz. bottle. Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´12 (Shared with Juanjo). Pours very dark brown in color headed by beige, medium bubbled froth. Tan in color, thick, slowly dissipated, crown. Toasted malts, chocolate & coffee hues both in flavors & aromas. Underliying high-α hop aromas,hay & lavender fragancies too. Sweet/bitter ar fist sip followed by subtle spicy touch & green dark fruit notes. Medium body, moderate to high carbonation. Slightly astringent in the middle. Toasted malt texture to the palate. Just a brief illusion since resiny & oily hop bitterness –overwhelms malts- lingers into a dry bitter finish. Moderate fruit tartar on the aftertaste. Refreshing. ABV well masked while drinking but definitely present to your head. Nice beer."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass, bottled 10/11. Pours a slick black, with a three inch dark tan head, with lacing everywhere. Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, pine, and a hint of citrus. Taste is more mellow than when I had it 8 months ago and it was more bitter, do to the aggressive hops. Very strong expresso, with some bitter hops still hanging on. The body is on thick side, plenty of carbonation for its size, not overly dry, and very drinkable for such a large brew. I enjoyed its aggressive nature when it was younger, but many might enjoy it more now that the flavors have mellowed. This is a very good beer, like I said my preference is fresh."

"O - I had given up hope in finding one of these when I happened upon the last one at a Total Wine in Delaware. Although I feared that a 6 month old hoppy beer would be less than spectacular, I was pleasantly surprised. The hops were still vibrant and flavorful. There is great complexity and balance to this beer. Dangerously drinkable as well. I really hope they make this beer again, although the ""anniversary"" status doesn't suggest they will. One of the best Black IPA's I have ever had."

"Pours out pretty much black. The head is brown and dense with a rocky top. Lacing is awesome. Looks like curtains. Bitter grapefruit up front with just a bit of sweetness. Lightly toasted malts push through. Also getting a hint of coffee and chocolate. There is a lot going on in there and you don't have to dig for it. Taste just like and excellent stout mixed with and excellent double IPA. Lots of hop bitterness. Mostly grapefruit rind. Although toasted malts and coffee are very noticeable. It bitter up front then fades into the toasted part all to end on a bitter note. The end is the beginning is the end. Not super complex but damn tasty. Smooth as hell mouth feel. No rough edges an the carbonation is just right. Pretty much the best American Black Ale Iv'e had. Never really been a fan. This one right here sets the standards in my opinion. If there were more out there like this then it would be a different story. My first clown shoes beer by the way. Far from disappointed. Hats off to Clown Shoes."
""
"O: Well, this is one that I passed up on last summer and regretted it. Luckily, this is still getting bottled for whatever reason and I snagged a bottle this time around. Definitely worth it, but a tad pricey at $8 a bomber. Better priced than Blaecorn, I guess (that is $10-11 usually around here). Certainly worth a try if you missed it, even though judging by some reviews and bottle dates it seems to be a regularly rotating beer and not just a one time a year shot"
""
"Label shows bottled on 10/11. Pours an opaque black with nice head and lacing. Aroma is charred malts and bitter citrus hops. Taste is dark roasted malt, with cocoa and coffee flavors, hops are nice and bitter but not over fruity - which I think is appropriate for this style, alcohol is warming. Despite all the charred bitterness in the flavor, this goes down smooth with dry finish. Overall I like this - not a session beer by any means, but a nice one to sip on."
""

"O- A decently amped-up variant to Hoppy Feet, but I kind of prefer the original."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep black with barely any light shining through. Head was not strong or large, but had a nice presence throughout. Smells were strong in bread and malts, faint hints of citrus but no pine. Taste was a mix of malt and hops, slightly tilted toward the malt but this brew did a good job of making a tasty malt. Just enough bitters to zing the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel full. Great beer."
"Overall I really enjoyed this and am glad to tick another Black IPA. I love this style and think that this one is on the top half of the great ones. Glad I found this at Total Wine and More."
""
""
""
"O: It's Hoppy Feet on steroids (naturally) but I feel it's also a lot better balanced. Hoppy Feet was very heavy on the pine and the roasted malt character got buried. The malt is much stronger in this one and balances out nicely. Turns out like a really big, hoppy stout. I really enjoyed this one."
"Among the best Black IPAs I've had."
""
"Compared to the original Hoppy Feet, this beer lacks the hops aromas that makes HF1 so great. However, HF1.5 more than makes up for this with the unparallelled flavors and superb carbonation."
"O- These beers are oh so confused but are pretty good. So far Clown Shoe's is two for two on their beers I've had. Time to go after that crazy named stout they make and see how they fare with that."
""
""
"Oily black in color with dark brown tints, and a small, bubbly cap of off-white head; not much in the way of retention or lacing. Aroma thick with resinous hops, notes of herbs and dark roasty malts. A decent hit of piney hops right off the bat, quickly taking a back seat to a surprisingly strong chocolate profile, the two eventually duking it out and coming to a nice balance, with lesser notes of charcoal and herbal hops coming through as well. Medium body, some alcohol warmth, a little astringent, but not intolerably so. Overall pretty enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, sticky and lingering on the tongue. I thought this might turn into a booze bomb, but this was remarkably drinkable and tasty considering the alcohol content."
""
"O:: Goes down easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. I had this beer at a tasting and wasn't impressed. Perhaps a year difference or some type of tweaking, I am digging on this beer now!"
""
"HV"
"overall - well done, even if it defies categorization."
""
""
"Very dark red with some brown and black mixed in as well, looks kinda sludgy. Much darker than the original hoppy feet. Ring around the glass. Semi slight dots of lace, nothing extraordinary. Smell is piney, grapefruit that's sharp, semi boozy even with the low ABV, malts are in the forefront. Taste is a black IPA alright, sharp taste of grapefruit and oily hops, resinous. Some malt in the back, not terribly complex. Medium bodied, highly carbed, kinda prickly on the tounge there, bitterness is noted. I kinda liked this stuff, it did not blow me away, but I will look for it again, maybe."
""
""
"to Clown Shoes for their first Anniversary Ale!"
"Medium mouthfeel and only the slightest notice of alcohol for the high abv. Honestly, I am not a big fan of Black IPAs. I have never adjusted to the roasted malt combined with the hops. But, rating to style, this is one of the better and more drinkable versions I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall I’m not a huge fan of this beer, all the things that I like about IPAs have been stripped out of this Black IPA. I guess it’s just too black. I liked this style originally, but the black IPA is loosing favor with me. Even though I will rate this beer high in looks and smell, this Double Black IPA won’t be in my fridge again."
""

"O: B beer. Surprised me as this is a new line to the DE region. And it's pretty moderately priced."
""
""
"O: love it and wish it was year round. $12 is worth it but doesn't make it a regular and cheap beer."
""
"Overall: My first beer from this brewery. I felt the hops came through well for the amount of coffee, which is heavy, but the mouthfeel was too grainy and dry for me"
""
"O: A very nice black IPA. Stone 15th-like, and that's a definite compliment. Solid, tasty and drinkable."
"O. Quality beer. Great overall, very hoppy and with well balanced flavors. Just a great overall beer. This is one I could drink on a regular basis. I'm sad that we had this towards the end of the night because I really could not drink a lot of it, but it deserves much more."
""
""
"DELICIOUS, GET SOME!"
""
""
"This beer pretty much succeeds in what it sets out to achieve. It is indeed a thoroughly blackened double IPA, in looks and taste, and of the four Clown Shoes offerings I've had so far, is easily the best of the lot."
"Black with a semi creamy/big bubbly head. Foam disappears quickly and leaves a ring around the glass. Aroma is mostly sticky pine and some subtle amounts of heavily roasted chocolate. Almost like a sugar-free liquor because of the high abv. Flavors pop with a big carbonation tingle as soon as it hits your tongue. Mostly cascade at the start and then some light semi-sweet chocolate comes forward. Thin malt bill it seems and only one type of hop characteristic. Ok at first, pretty average flavors but then man does it get intense. In a bad way. So much bitterness and astringency. Too much hop bitterness of sticky pine resin and another layer of overwhelming black patent bite. It just clings to your tongue and sticks to the back of your throat. I could only get through 1/4 of this beer. One thing on the positive side is the 10% abv isn't too noticeable. Maybe with a year this might get better but I'm not optimistic."
""
""
"O: I definitely like this beer better than its cousin, the original Hoppy Feet. It's well made and drinkable."
"O- It's no Stone 15 but it is one of the better takes on this style. I'll most likely be picking up another bottle. More proof that I should try more of this newly discovered (by me, anyway) brewery."
"A pretty big beer, a worthy adversary, maybe a second level black ale."
"Seems more like a young Imperial Stout that's way too boozy and needs some time to age, even though it's around a year old? (their Second Anniversary beer just came out)"
"In mouthfeel and appearance this is like a RIS, but the hops are so potent that it quickly becomes a fantastic Black IPA. This was a fantastic beer. I'll definitely pick up another bomber the next time I'm at the store."

"found this one in the ""cellarable"" beer fridge....paused and these need to go and how did they get in here. alright bomber pours pitch black producing a 2 finger lightly tanned head that leaves lace like it gets paid. the aroma is fresh hops, floral, pine, toasted malt. the taste is typical of the style, malty ness up front some smoke, light caramel right before the bitter ash finish. a bit thin and watery on the palate but not too bad, carbonated and correlated all the while easy to drink, no alcohol. overall this is a good rep of the style but not outstanding. its little bro packed more of a feisty punch but this is solid. give me stone 15th."

"Really glad I picked one up-if you can handle the hop assault, highly recommend."
"Pours an opaque coffee brown with a fairly thick light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Aroma has a strong burnt hops note, an earthy tone, and hints of licorice and roast malt. Flavor is hoppy and smoky, only a little bitter, with hints of licorice, malt and caramel. Lively texture has slightly above-average body and leaves a nice smoky, woody, slightly sweet and slightly bitter finish."
"Dark brown body was mostly opaque, and the head atop was quite large at three to four fingers thick. While it looked like a stout, it certainly did not smell like one. The hops were very noticeable in the piney and earthy smell. There was a touch of chocolate at the end of each whiff, betraying the presence of dark malts. The taste was perfectly straddling the line between a stout and a DIPA. The hops were clearly there in the bitterness up front, which was followed by a different, more astringent bitterness from the roasting of the grains. There was also a small amount of sweetness that alternated between molasses and rock candy. The aftertaste was very bitter, and lingered long after the beer had already passed the throat. Very silky mouthfeel with no harshness. Phenomenal beer from a brewery whose products are newly being distributed around here. I will be back for more of your beers very soon."

"A flavorful beer for sure but the combination of these strong flavor profiles doesn't really do it for me."
""
""
""
"I poured this beer from a cold bottle into a cold glass and the temperature masked the flavors. AS the beer warmed up the flavors came out and you could taste the hops and the coffee like tastes of the beer. Served cold it was pretty poor but at the right temperature it was an enjoyable beer."
""
"Overall, this was a good experience. I recommend picking up a bottle."

"Overall this is a pretty smackable beer, all the elements i like in a black ale. Another nice brew from Clown Shoes!"
"(9/7/2011) Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet 1.5 is a cola black ale with a huge, foamy, turbanado sugar colored head that stays put and leaves fancy lacing all down the glass. It has an aroma of pine, lemon and burnt sugar. Tons of hop juiciness is detected. It's full bodied and creamy on the tongue. The finish is pretty chewy and it leaves the mouth a little raw. This beer is jarringly bitter, raising my heart rate, quickening my breath, dropping my jaw. Nice. The bitterness has a big juniper quality. It is resiny, wooden, almost smokey. There's light sweetness and almost a hint of melanoids. It's blurringly bitter, hot, boozy syrup. The blackness doesn't give a hint of coffee, but there may be a blackstrap flavor to this. This is not for the hoi polloi. It would kill them. This is a beer for you, Mister Beer Snob. Someone used some science to get a fluid that packed with this much flavor into your mouth and I'm impressed with that. These Clown Shoes guys are off the handle. This is a New England beer that will win a fight in a San Diego bar. I am humbled by this beer."
"O: Quite a nice beer. The alcohol builds over time, and maybe a bit more hop would be enjoyed, but it is a very nice and thoroughly enjoyable beer..."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am giving this beer the benefit of the doubt as I suspect I may have an off bottle; would like to try this again sometime but I am having a hard time drinking this one"
""
""
""
"Very solid brew and for 10% hides the alcohol very well. I'm not a huge fan of Black IPA's, but this is one of the better ones I've had. Better than the original Hoppy Feet."
""
""
""
"O - Not terrible, but too hot."
""
""
"Writing this while trailing off into a Thanksgiving coma. Popped open a bottle before dinner while we were snacking on Ritz crackers and Cabot cheese. Delicious - hoppy, rich, creamy, and super roast-y and dry on the finish. Nose was a bit overly boozy and didn't find the high abv to add to the experience of the beer but yeah, would definitely jump back in for more."
""
""
""
""
"Still the dryness makes this one slightly less than steller for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Couldn't taste much alcohol at all. I would have another, but would have to be in the mood."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is quite hoppy and bitter upfront. The hops dominate the beer and give the beer a strong fruity and resiny taste. When swallowed the beer is quite bitter and leaves a resiny and citric taste. The dark taste is subtle but roasted. Together with the bitterness the roast is bitter. The mouthfeel is a little too thin for me."
"Poured almost black, with some deep reds and burgundy highlights in the lights - but these are quite faint really. Magnificent light brown head of several fingers, sticky, chunky and generous lacing with excellent retention. Nose has some faint tropical fruits, predominantly pineapple. Some pine among other hops notes. Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder and sugary dark fruits, with a slight suggestion of alcohol. Taste starts roasty with dark chocolate, brown sugar and some subtler tropical hop notes, even compared to the nose. More sugary dark fruits. Great malt flavour, and the hops compliment and add to it quite well. Full, but not substantially heavy mouthfeel and a really creamy texture. Relatively low carbonation, and the alcohol is practically invisible. A stunning black ale, I can only imagine this being even better if fresh. A great introduction to this brewery for me."
"Overall-I only had a few ounces of the Hoppy Feet and this definitely had a little more bang for the buck. Not my favorite, but a nice 7.99 bomber."
"Overall a good black ale that was a little too boozy for me as it distracted from the other flavors. Avail now in TX. Rotation - glad I tried it but one was enough for me [N;N]"
"Opinion: I like this version much better than the original. It has a much better balance in the dark malts, so it carries through the entire experience. I am really enjoying this beer and will see about picking some more up if I come across it. If you like American beers in general, and especially if you like the American Stouts and so forth, I would give this one a try. I don't think that you will be disappointed."
"O-i dont really know what they were found for with this. If they were going to make this beer so intense why not go all the way and barrel age it in bourbon barrels. It is too extreme for what it tries to be but not as extreme as it should be."
"Notes: First go at Clown Feet and it feels rather remarkable and worth seeking out. It still rides some hype and style controversy, which I am not too keen on... But the brew felt great. Glad distribution is starting to reach this area to give it a go. While imperialized, and malty, this makes me think of the dark hoppy anniversary offering from Stone, but while that one had a thicker/stouty feel this one maybe lingers stronger on the hop profile."
"O - Not usually a fan of the style, but this one I could actually see myself picking up again."
"An ok black ipa, but the acrid roastiness becomes more and more pronounced with each sip consequently making the beer less and less enjoyable. Couldn't finish more than about six ounces, or didn't want to anyway."
"Wow, I am not sure if I could imagine a brew with more hop flavor AND bitterness packed into it. The astringency of the roasty malts and high ABV only accentuate the drying effect. Orange-peel and ganja resin all over the place here...unbalanced like a see-saw with a fat kid on one end. For me, this took regular Hoppy Feet to a whole 'nother level...maybe 2.5 as opposed to 1.5. This one is for the extreme hopheads out there, unfortunately I am not one of them...had trouble finishing the bomber by myself."
"This is an interesting beer. It reminds me of Stone's anniversary black IPA. It is malty but has a strong pine with some grapefruit hop character."
"O: Tone down the medicated backend bitterness and this black ale will be elevated to Sublimely's level."
"O- I've been a fan of everything I've had from Clown Shoes and this was no exception. Very tasty."
"O: I now some people say the word ""amazing"" is over used in beer reviews, but this beer is amazing. Now I love the Black IPA (or American Black Ale, Cascadian Dark Ale or what ever you want to call it) style, but even so this beer stands out to me. It's big and full of complex flavors, but it still easy to drink (maybe a little too easy) and hides it's alcohol as well as any beer this size I've every had. Obviously it gets my endorsement."
"Overall: Some big flavors here, and they aren't all bad. Would kind of like to see what some age would do to help mellow out the fusel alcohol, but would be worried that the hop character would go with it. Kind of a train wreck at the moment."
"Had this one up against the origional hoppy feet and it kicked its ass. The only thing that the original had over this one was a bit more fresh hops in the smell but that's just fine. It poured just as black with a crisp white, fast fading head. Lacing hangs on though. The smell is mildly piney, very roasty and then a tad chocolatey. Taste is fantastic dry pine and bitter dark chocolate with the faintest expresso in the background. The hops hang on to the tounge and the perfectly roasted malts balance them out to a t. This needs to go head to head with stone ssr ale. The mouthfeel is what's makes this beer exceptional it is creamy beyond belief and the 10% is hiden very well. Great beer will seek this bad boy out again."
"Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Poured a deep dark brown with a thinner beige colored head atop that left a broken ring of lace as it settled rather quickly.A great mix of chocolate,roast,and earthy/resiny hops all come together very well.Resiny hops are strong overtop of a roasted base,earthy hops and chocolate round out the palate,the alcohol gives off a little sweetness and zip as it warms a little.A great ABA,maybe one of the top 2 or 3 I have had to date."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Happy Anniversary to Hoppy Shoes, I have really enjoyed most of their beers that I have tried thus far."
"Overall: Quite nice! Impressive. I can't exactly say it's like no other beer I've tasted, but it is very unique. Really enjoyable - I'll have to go get more ;)"
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy light tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some very nice malt notes, chocolate/toffee, and licorice. The taste is hoppy, slightly bitter, nice malt blend, some licorice, very slight citrus note, and a good dose of chocolate/toffee upfront. Medium body, nice litte dry finish, ABV is hidden pretty well. This is a pretty complex brew overall. Very Drinkable, not a major hop bomb like a West Coast DIPA, but it sure is tasty. Well done brew from Clown Shoes. Thanks again Bill!"
"This is very drinkable despite being very potent. A good black ale...not just a one-dimensional hop bomb but a rich balanced hoppy and malty experience."
"This is a VERY hoppy beer with a nice dark finish. It appears to be dark and menacing, but it's really a hoppy and refreshing black ale. nicely done! Good mouthfeel to boot."
"Pours dark black with a very creamy khaki-colored head that settles to a thick cap, leaving lots of soapy lacing as it recedes. Quite pretty! Big, pungent hop aromas of pine resin, grapefruit, and orange peel co-exist nicely with malty chocolate and coffee. Taste starts out with more bitter hop flavors of pine and grapefruit before moving on to the roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. A very nice progression, the hop bitterness gives way nicely to the roasted malt bitterness, and it lasts for some time on the palate. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall, a really nice Black Ale, not quite SSSR, but a darn good beer on its own!"
"D - Interesting, this beer is unusually light and drinkable for a beer of this style and strength. This is mostly due to its dryness which lets the hops shine through a bit despite the robust malt character. The bitterness is a bit on the harsh side, but other than that, it is a nicely done beer."
"Powdered sweet chocolate flavor. It's chewy with a low level carbonation. The swallow gives a shot of bittering hop that balances the overall darker flavors. Overall, very flavorful, but not my style."
"O-A nice effort that is certainly worth a try, but I'd rather have regular HF. I wish I could give this one a 3.75 overall, but since I can't I'll have to give it a 4.0 because I don't feel this beer deserves a 3.5 overall."
"Taste - Grapefruit and pine are present, but the deep, roasted malt character is the dominant player. Dark roasted malt flavour, coffee fruitiness, and an intense bitterness on the finish."
"O - An excellent example of the style. The bomber was gone very quickly."
"Jet black pour with a very mocha head. Several fingers thick even. Lacing is championing the walls of the glass. Rock on. Nose is heavy hop and coffee. Some vinous grape eeks through. Hot damn this is tasty. A hop forward coffee flavored beer. Pretty exceptional tasting. It drank well and left me wanting some more. Glad I had it."
"D: After writing a review and just casually drinking this beer, I started to like it more and more (maybe it was the 11%). In fact, it's too bad this was 11% as it drank fine when not trying to think too hard about the beer. It is dangerous though, because the alcohol is very well hidden."
"The CPJ"
"o - overall i'm glad i tried this. i've been curious about this brewery for a while. this isn't something i can get locally and not necessarily something that i will go out of my way to find, but i am eager to try the other clown shoes i've got got waiting."
"O: A good beer and a great one for a hop head. Almost too much like a stout, but I think they made it work. Extremely bitter and only had half a bottle because it was too heavy for a hot summer night. Definitely a good CDA though."
"Moderately bitter and big on roastiness, blackened malts, dark roast coffee, unsweetened bakers chocolate. Dry earthy hop bitterness in the aftertaste, mingling with the dry roasty elements that linger... Something vaguely green and minty about the hops in here. Very smooth and creamy here, definitely doesn't feel like 11%."
"Definitely bolder than the regular Hoppy Feet. I indeed like it a lot, but I may like the regular a hair better."
"Poured a 1/4"" mocha colored head. Looks clear but black as coffee and with minimal effervescence. Smell has a medium hoppiness and not really much else. Taste is where this really excells. There's coffee, cocoa, and a rich mouthfeel like an Imperial Stout as well as a deep fruity hoppy taste from the IPA component. Really they did a pretty nice job with this."
"O: This is what I want in an Imperial American Black Ale. Extremely drinkable for 11% ABV. I will be enjoyably drunk soon."
"The taste starts bitter and finishes bitter. The middle adds some roasty malts, but thats it. Roasted hop citric bitterness and maybe some burnt flavors too. The heat from the abv. add to this beers overall bitterness."
"Overall, this beer may be a little bit too much black and not enough IPA. This is a good beer, but it's more stout than anything."
"O: 4.0, a bit less EtOH would bump this up a bit"
"Part one of the SwillFest 2011 after-party. It pours a dark ruby-tinted brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate-covered pretzels, light roasted malts, blueberries, black grapes, balsa, and juniper berries. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, rubber, vinyl, Pine-Sol, molasses, and menthol. Whoa, what happened here!? The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a scratchily dry finish. Overall, a nice-looking and -smelling beer, but it just tastes downright awful to me."
"O: This beer is definitely an improvement over hoppy feet, which itself is a fine ale. This is a great treat to enjoy."
"Nice night capper or with a chocolate dessert."
"I'm very glad Clown Shoes has started to make it's way into Maine. As their first anniversary beer, I look forward to trying their future anniversary beers for a long time to come."
"O: BIPA/Porter hop flavors and aromas coupled with RIS mouthfeel. Took a couple of sips for my senses to come around, but once they did everything was good. If this is what they turn out for their first anniversary, I can't wait to see what year # 2 brings!"
"Cheers!"
"I rarely rate a beer as mostly exceptional but this one definitely was. Deep dark pour into a pint glass with about a 1/4 finger tan head that left it's mark on the glass to the end. After having had a couple of beers earlier in the evening that had little if any malt character, including a micropub bourbon stout, the mouthfeel was particlarly noticeable. I've only had a couple of Black IPAs that i have thought captured What i think should be the essence of this ""new"" category. Black malt, I think, and chocolate revealed itself early along with the hops an alcohol. Well integrated and the hop finish was strong as an IPA should be. Purchased the last bottle on a visit to Chicago at a hole-in-the-wall package store and backroom pub called Maria's near Comisky Park. I will be searching for more."
"Overall, its a very good beer, just not what I would consider a Black IPA."
"D: i would definitely say more on the stouty side than hoppy IPA side, but the IPA side definitely shows its colors."
"This was quite an interesting brew. It could have been a bit more complex, and I am curious what would have happened with a little aging. I'm guessing the hops would drop, thus creating an entirely different beer."
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, excellent representation of style, not all enhanced versions of a good beer work much less show an improvement, but this beer takes a very good beer and takes it to an incredible level. I like Hoppy Feet. I love Hoppy Feet 1.5."
"O: Better than the Hoppy Feet 1, but still not what I was really looking for in a CDA."
"Get some."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors start out a bit all over the place and roasted heavy, but seem to strike a nicer balance at the end. That being said, the balance is nicer in the aroma and that is where the beer really shines."
"Overall a tasty brew. Gunna need to try some more clown shoes stuff."
"Alex, again... dark brown with a creamy light beige head, good retention... light aroma but nice, grassy coffee, a touch too sweet... the taste is a bit too green for me but one of the best beers of the night, I came back several times although its not very balanced"
"overall, this is a great beer. this bomber wont last long, which is a shame. For never hearing of this brewery before this beer, im very impressed and will certainly seek out there brews in the future."
"Herbal hop bitterness hits right away. Roasted coffee and sugary dark fruit show up early on as well. Roasted malt/coffee linger, along with the increasing herbal, numbing hop bitterness. Notes of pine and resin mix in. Sugary plums fight against the bitterness, but lose out in the end. Some tobacco and earthy notes mingle near the finish. Long-lasting pine and herbal bitterness in the finish. Lingering sugary fruit and roasted coffee. Slightly warming, but not hot at all. Full-bodied with a slightly syrupy feel. A definite palate ruiner, but it's some nice ruination!"
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice mix of black and roasted malts along with an excellent citrus hop nose. It's not too powerful, but the dry hopping comes through well. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, black malt earthiness surrounded by an intense hop flavor. It hits you up front, but the malt character tames it. It goes down easy and resinates in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with perfect carbonation. This is an improvement over the original Hoppy Feet. It's an extremely drinkable 11% abv. beer; scary drinkable."
"The alcohol was dangerously well-hidden. A big beer, very, very nice."
"D: This was smoother than the standard Hoppy Feet, although it also had more noticeable alcohol. It didn't smell quite as good, but it tasted better and had a fuller body than the standard version. An enjoyable beer that's definitely a step up from the base model, although still not the best example of the style."
"o- This beer is not terrible. just woudlnt be one of them i would go back to over and over again. Once every so often would be plenty. Also reminds me of a porter not so much a Black IPA."
"Poured black with a thick beautiful head that didn't move. My skepticism on this gimmicky-sounding beer dissipated upon first smell. Perfect combined scent of roastiness and hops, floral as this style can get. The flavor was even better, with a roasted malt balanced exactly how I like it with just the right amount of hops. Did I mention balance? The smoothness level was almost quenching, without being the least bit watery or cheap. Overall a superior beer that hangs its hat on performance and balance, not labeling and over-hopping. A shotgun blast of awesome, and strong."
"O: This was a good beer, but it's not a terribly good black IPA. Far too heavy and too much roast without enough hop flavor."
"Pours a cola black with a finger of khaki head that leaves nice lacing. The smell has very in your face pine and citrus hop aromas (reminds me of dfh 90min) along with slight grassy and herbal notes along with rich slightly roasted caramel as well. Very in your face ipa without heady alcohol aromas especially at this abv. Taste is very clean and unlike the nose, lots of hop bittnerness but stout like, with clean roasted malts. Also has some coffee as well as bitter chocolate with a light floral hint. Finishes bitter and refreshing. Very first clown shoes and found this to be a great thought provoking beer, thanks for rhettroactive for the trade!"
"Overall, a big and bold American Black Ale with huge pine notes and a ton of bitter, dark malt. Big flavors are definitely the highlight and it plays pretty smooth for the high ABV with the exception of the aroma. A nice sipper, and solid example of the style."
"This is okay; it's like a slightly hoppier porter but it still doesn't quite scratch my hop itch."
"The mouthfeel is a little heavier then average for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer, the bitter hoppiness meshed pretty well with the bitter roasty flavors. It made for a very flavorful and intense beer. I actually liked all the bitterness to it and felt it worked better then a lot of versions of the style where the flavors seem to clash more. Pretty good beer overall and one of the more enjoyable ones of the style I've had. It didn't blow me away in any category, but was very solid in pretty much all of them."
"Overall an excellent ...what ya call it(?) Imperial cascadian? Very drinkable, very dangerous, very tasty."
"Prost!!!"
"Overall: This is an awesome beer. Very drinkable despite the ABV though make no mistake, this beer is big on the bitterness and flavor. Grab this if you see it. It's worth it!"
"overall what can i say, this was slammin. a tremedously good beer."
"Considering this costs more than a third more than standard Hoppy Feet, I was hoping Hoppy Feet 1.5 would be at least 1.5 times better; it's highly unusual to be disappointed by a beer of this quality. It's essentially the same beer and as they say: all cats look the same in the dark. I called Hoppy Feet one of the best Black IPAs so that certainly makes this one of the best too, but don't pay the extra dinero if you don't have to."
"O - Very nice and quite drinkable, would definitely pick up a few bottles of this. Easy enough to get buzzed on as well."
"D - This is a pretty solid Black Ale. Not sure if I prefer this over the regular Hoppy Feet, but that may be because this isn't the freshest bottle. I may try the second batch that made it to Chicago in late March. Still, it's one of the better Clown Shoes offerings I've tried."
"I liked this, but I didn't love it. I had a tough time getting past the fowl essence I detected on the nose, and that metallic finish on the palate was unwelcomed. Having said that, I would sample this again if given the opportunity, and I continue to be impressed by the boundary pushing brews that Clown Shoes continues to create."
"O: Good overall, but not extremely memorable."
"Beer is dark brown, near black in color. The beige head is 1/4"" thick and leaves a decent amount of lacing in its wake. The aroma and flavor bring roast, hops, chocolate, coffee. The flavor is very nice, well balanced, and finishes with a pleasant hop bitterness. Alcohol presence well disguised. Overall, a good brew. I would have this again."
"Above average mouthfeel.Thanks Dr. Jay."
"This drinks very easy for 11% abv. You can taste the alcohol, but it's not hot. I enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying the regular hoppy feet."
"-Cheers"
"This brew appropriately has 2 faces between the malt and hop profiles, and they keep each other in check very well. Recommended."
"If you see the regular and the 1.5 for sale get them together and taste them side by side."
"O- I wanted this brew all day and is living up to its expectations. I love when that happens. Hoppy Feet continues to be a great APA. I'm gonna need to pick up another one of these."
"Overall pretty good, quite bitter and hoppy but earthy and spicy hops, the booze comes out a bit on the finish but is mostly hidden well."
"O/D-This is a big beer, so a bomber is plenty for me. Would have loved to try this fresh to see how powerful the bitterness was at its peak. Still, one of my favorite American Blacks/Cascadian/Black IPA/whatever its called. I think Clown Shoes is an underrated brewery, and this beer only proves my belief."
"Overall, this is an amazing style beer. I had tried a sample of this about 3-4 months ago, and even in that short time, this beer has evolved into something that I really dig. It at first was too bitter for me, but it smoothed out and the balance was as close to perfect as I've seen. Awesome beer. I hope I get another one at that stage in its life!"
"Update: Bottled dated end of March, I got a fresh one and it was amazing. Much more hops and balance, a true Black IPA!!!"
"Pours nearly black with a light tan head and some good spotty lacing. The nose brings forward some piney hops and a bit of roast. There is a mild earthiness to the nose as well. The flavor has many of the same characteristics, but also has a bit too much alcohol flavor. Quite a lot too much, actually. Bitterness and alcohol layer with a medium body. Lots of bitterness carries through the finish. Decent, but not something I would seek out again."
"D: Easy drinking for the ABV. One of the better examples I have had of this style. Really nice and at a great price point. They should make this one year round as it is a nice beer and continue to tweak it."
"If you are going to brew this style, hops need to be forward, but not overbearing. This example strikes a great balance. Check it out!"
"D- Not to used to black IPA's, but this makes me want a couple more. Very easy to kick back and sip on this while watching the game. Dnuggs did a great job getting me this beer! Got any more??"
"Looks nice. Very dark, nearly black, with a tan cap that really lasted. Tons of foamy lacing clung to the glass in solid sheets. Hoppy aroma, pine and citrus, raw powdery hops (like breaking pellets apart), but with a lot of chocolate and toffee notes as well. Bitterness was strong, kind of sharp, lots of citrus flavour and toffee/molasses. Light roast and pine, malt and caramel. Alcohol flavour and warmth lingered. Some astringency from the dark malts, carbonation was on the creamy side, full bodied but not heavy. I liked this. Powerful but still quite drinkable for a big beer."
"I love supporting local breweries, especially those which continue to produce new and exciting beers. Look for these guys to become one of the big players in town in the not-so-distant future."
"smooth, medium-plus bodied with average carbonation. drinks well. would certainly not object to a revist, only downside being that it's somewhat cost prohibitive. ($9.99 for the bomber)"
"O - Good job Clown Shoes. Congrats on your 1st year Anniversary"
"Somehow smoother than the regular Hoppy Feet, though just as flavorful. Would go very well with food."
"D- No alc detectable. Easy to sip on. A mix between an IIPA and a stout. Tasty."
"This beer is even better than the regular Hoppy feet, which was probably my favorite beer before this."
"Bleh...WAY overhopped to be enjoyable. The smell seemed decently balanced but the taste is just way too bitter. It's scathing and just not very enjoyable, a bomber is a chore. I enjoyed the original Hoppy Feet much more."
"Cheers!"
"Clown shoes keeps bringing it in force. The bottle is a redone version of the regular hoppy feet, with a purple bakcground and I think he is wearing bigger shoes. Cool. The beer itself blew me away. Dark black with a dark tan head that doesn't fall very fast. The smell is chocolate, pine, grapefruit, and all other sorts of malt and hop good stuff. The taste is a phenomenal blend of dark chocolate, roast, grapefruit and a lingering bitterness. One of my favorite beers... ever. I bought six and am going to see howm a few age!"
"D: I'm no expert of this new style (I think this is the fourth Black IPA I've had), but out of the four this one is right in the middle. Not too hoppy, not too roasted, but not too amazing either. Drinkable but bitter. I'm good with this being the only bottle I'll ever have."
"drinks very well. 10%ABV is hard to believe on this one, as there is no harshness or burn. very impressive."
"D - All in all this is a really enjoyable beer its just a bit too bitter for my liking. I have to tip my hats to Clown Shoes, this is my first double black IPA and its yet another solid beer."
"1299"
"D- Very high. Well done. A great idea on an anniv. beer- take your flagship and double down. What a good beer. Get it while it's fresh."
"i prefer the original hoppy feet"
"Very very easy to get thru this bottle, which scares me. Alcohol on the breath but not on the palate. Smooth and drinkable. Can't wait to see what they do on the 2nd anniversary."
"The feel of this beer is pretty smooth. There is a creamy feel that seems to mask the lethality of the ABV. Is goes down real easy and has a pretty drinkable feel, you hardly notice it go down."
"M/D: Big, thick, viscous body, carbonation is low. Drinkability is scary on this one. For the hop and alcohol level in this, it drinks like a normal IPA/BIPA. Very good beer."
"This is a very well balanced beer that hides its 10% abv very well. It's very drinkable and quite flavorful. Hopefully this anniversary beer will become a regular offering."
"D: This is my first beer from Clown Shoes and I am really impressed. This is a big Black IPA, which is becoming my favorite style because it basically blends my two favorite styles (IPA and Stout), but it isn't overpowering. I would recommend that you keep this beer for a little while before drinking, I was just overly excited to try it, but I will be going back for another to lay to rest for a few months. Excellent offering, excited to try more from Clown Shoes."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot, Ive been looking for a beer this flavorful and bitter for a long time and Ive finally found it. Not for someone who doesn't like hops. Best enjoyed when warmed up a little and best enjoyed with friends. This beer is young some might even want to let it sit a couple months and let the flavors meld together. I tip my hat once again to Another great job by Clown Shoes beer."
