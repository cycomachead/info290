"This pours a warming dark cola-black with cocoa foam. I get an upfront roasty malt profile with a pronounced roast on the palate cut by some bitterness and a touch of piney grapefruit hops. It’s malty and more sweet than dry, with enough going on to place it in my mind as more ‘hoppy porter’ than ‘black IPA.’ Tasty and enjoyable even as it warms."

"never buy again, no wonder it was marked down so cheap!"
"O: Definitely a good Black IPA, I enjoyed this one, good subtle flavors and not to boozie like others that I have like this beer."
""
"Taste: Very strong — lots of sweetness from the malts melding with a bitter citrus hops presence. In fact, it’s so cloying it’s actually boozy. There are also detectable notes of dark fruit and leather, even some peat, which goes way against this one being a “black IPA”. But that’s splitting hairs. This is a bold and boozy brew (at 8.5%) and not one I’d care to revisit."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, some fruits, hops are present but subdued, easy drinking for the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a little less hoppy than expected, but a  pretty good beer."

"As someone who truly enjoys malty scotch ales, this is the perfect double/black IPA."

"O - Heavy hitting Black IPA - a nice offering from Arcadia."
""
""
""
"This ale pours a dark brown almost black hue with a large and lasting light tan head. The aroma is malty with some notes of coffee and chocolate. This one sips light and smooth for an ale with its abv. The flavor is almost reminiscent of root beer with a sweet roasty maltiness accented by notes of vanilla, coffee, and creme soda. This is by no means a bad black ipa but given some of the other offerings out there, it makes one wonder why you would try this witb so many much better offerings out there."

"O: I really liked this Cascadian IPA because it had an excellent balance between the malts and hops."
"In closing, I'm glad I tried this one; it's rather different and fun to drink, but the flavors are very disjointed and the carbonation is way too high. When all is said and done, this comes across as more of a lighter stout--high in coffee flavors, low in body, high in carbonation--than anything like a DIPA. I don't worry too much about styles but when drinking this one, it's obvious that they were going for something that didn't quite happen. Still a tasty beverage that just falls short a bit."

"Tried this on tap at the Detroit Fall Beer Festival. Obviously from the name it's a Black IPA. It pours a surprisingly clear black, with fizzy head. There are notes of grapefruit and leather. The darker notes give this an interesting twist on a traditional IPA."
""
"Pours pretty much opaque. Amazing dark chocolate pine aroma. Very piney. Almost like Pine-Sol. Tastes piney hoppy with some dark chocolate, but also a touch watery towards the finish, which is piney, a bit boozy and pretty bitter. A little to prickly in the mouthfeel with the carbonation. Maybe a little bit of black pepper before the finish. Overall, it's pretty delicious."
""

"For a well-hopped beer that is almost 9% and contains a good amount dark malts, B-Craft Black is surprisingly approachable to just about anyone. Sure, some will react by spitting and running as far as possible from this considerably bitter, comparatively bold offering but, on the whole, it's an ale that marries dark malt and bright hoppy flavours in a mild and engaging fashion. Good stuff."

"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a 2-inch tan head. The initial nose suggests toasted grain, smokiness, and density. Medium full body with rich, smoky notes on the palate. Nice bitter lingering. Belgian lace. The ABV is not noticeable. Modest carbonation. Delicious. Would be excellent with grilled and smoked food. Will seek again."
""

"I had this beer at a beer tasting some time ago and decided to pick up a single for a detailed review. As the roastiness is somewhat subdued, this beer would be a good introduction to someone new to black IPAs before they try something with more intense roastiness like Stone's SSRA. On a side note, I never would have thought that coffee and lemon complement each other, yet both flavors can be found here and the combination is intriguing."

"O: excellent black IPA. I'm really satisfied with the complexities and sweetness. Again, I love how this beer smells. Even though I had it on tap, I did look at the bottle label online. The label solidified my desire to drink this over Halloween season. It just gives you that warm fall feeling while maintaining the hoppiness and bitterness of an IPA."
"Pours a near-black into my wine glass, a thin and beautiful light brown head with very fine lacing. Scents of chocolately malt are balanced with a more delicate smelling hop profile. Taste is of dark, thick, almost lactic malts very well balanced with a lighter hop component - very un-IPA like. But I love it for that, its quite well balanced. Mouthfeel is where it really shines though, very smooth, thick and creamy like that of a milk stout. Well recommended, a surprising brew and very well put together, likely my favorite from Arcadia yet."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a tannish head. In the aroma, big citrus hops and a small caramel like malt. In the taste, dryer orange citrus hops, somewhat minty even. A small hop bite, but mainly smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer orange citrus and small maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice big hops, and a nice balance of flavor between orange citrus and caramel malt."

"Lots of roasted coffee taste with chocolate malt and roasted grain flavor. It distinguishes itself more for what it is not than what it is; No IPA character, as the label suggests, but nice black ale character in taste, scent and feel."
"a tasty version with some kick, better executed than many black IPAs but lacks the deep roast or top hops of the best, a very good beer though. definitely grab one if you see it, well rounded!"
"This beer is a deep brown color. The head is a tan, thick foam. Some brownish-ruby highlights when held to the light. Murky. The smell is great...roasts malt, earth, smoke and charcoal...nice hop scents...resin and spice. It has a sugary, malt flavor, and a very sharp hop bitterness. Hoppy and flavorful. The mouthfeel is full and thick. This beer was enjoyable and worth having again."

"O-a solid black IPA, good flavor and body"
""
""
""
"O - I dont think the full potential of this brew were brought out. The hops are a little subdued and more of the roasted malt takes over, and the ABV accompanied with the burn lend this more to a hopped porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: The B-craft Black is a well done strong black Ale. Solid all day, would have it again sometime."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good black ale. A DIPA is a bit of a stretch. Still enjoyable."
""
""
"O-it's really an okay beer. it's even okay as a black ale. i could see this being mistaken as a citrusy porter. the abv isn't apparent at all. i think most black ale fans might not like this, a bit light on hops possibly. as easy as this is to drink, i don't recommend it or think i'll get it again in any situation."

"Overall I really liked this black IPA it imparts tones of Russian Imperial stouts with anise and molasses and hides the ABV well."
""
""
"O: Excellent black ale. Picked this up in a mix-n-match, which explains the bottling date being so old. I'm going to certainly pick up a 4-pack of this when fresh."
"Really great, very enjoyable beer - way beyond expectation based on other Arcadia's I've had. Easily drinkable, with alcohol content barely noticable."
"I remember really enjoying this stuff during my birthday's visit to a trade show last year, so expectations are high to begin with this time. Full disclosure, I guess. This stuff pours a deep, dark sienna topped by a finger of tan-cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light blackened pretzel, dry pine resin, and a touch of straight booze tossed in for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, softening the resin, getting rid of the booze entirely, and adding a faint hint of hickory smoke. Nice. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice black IPA, one that lived up to my pleasant memories in every way save the smell (which, to be fair, was probably getting pretty weak by the time I got to this one last year...)."
""
""
""
"Leaves a bit of an aftertaste where you can tell there is a potent amount of alcohol. Overall, great beer to try."
""
""
"O- unique and worth a try. I don't think I would drink more then one in a sitting."
""
"My bro-in-law is awesome!!! He set me up with b-Craft Black from Arcadia...and it is amazing!!! The beer poured a opaque black with thin ecru head that is lacing. The smell contains a piny roast that could be more bold if I am to compare to SSRA from Stone. The taste is more of the same of the smell. It starts off roasty then finishes bitter. The mouthfeel is very nice, full bodied and creamy with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a good beer....the 8.5% will cause everyone pause....and may be a one and done."
""
""
"O: Overall while the nose could of used a bit more ummph the flavor was generally good and easy consuming material for casual affairs."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid BIPA. They combine the dark flavors with the hops in a balanced way that keeps the astringency from being too much, but while still keeping this a pretty sippable beer. Especially considering its ABV. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty tasty black ipa. wouldnt hate for a little more body or lingering sweetness to fill up the body. otherwise really solid."
"Overall it's pretty tasty but won't be one of my favorites from Arcadia."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and a bit rough on the tongue. This is a pretty solid black DIPA, although the alcohol and strong pine hops can combine to become somewhat of an overwhelming force at times."
""
""
"This is a potent, hoppy - mainly piney - black ale. I do have issues with the term ""Double India Pale Ale"" on the label - as it should just say what it is - a hoppy American Black Ale, but as for the beer - it's nice - if you like piney beers that have a boozy character with some black (licorice/chocolate) traits - and is balanced enough not to be just pine sap - give this one a shot! Well-done!"
""
"Great black DIPA. First example of the style I had tried. Glad someone thought of this style. It was a great idea and well executed."
""
""
"Flavor carries a slight citrus sweetness,medium bodied with a fair amount of roasted malt comprising the main flavor accent. Moderately bitter with a drying finish that is somewhat chalky in feel. A textbook IBA, nothing too wild but it's drinkable with a good hop character to it."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is strange. Big body, good carbonation. Layered in a strange way hits ya from back to front. Chocolate, burnt malts, some plastic like taste with some citrus hop profile. Drinkable but I feel like it wasn't thought out enough. comes at you in weird layers with flavors that dont exactly pair up perfectly."
""
""
"To be certain, this was strong and took a little while to fully savor. I didn't taste the booze and it didn't detract from the dark flavors but by the time I got to the end of the bottle, it had already sneaked up on me and caught me off-guard. Once I was past that, there wasn't much not to like here and this was a good example of what a black IPA should be. With more and more beers of this style hitting store shelves every year, better versions can be easily found but fans of Arcadia or beers that are strong and heavy will find enough to like here."
""
""
"Overall: Fairly straightforward, not overly hoppy black IPA."
"O - Overall, This was a solid beer, with an interesting flavor, but once again, Arcadia has not astounded me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I usually like hoppier black IPAs, but this is quite nice. There is a strange aftertaste that is there and gone in an instant. So brief I can't really identify it, so I won't peg it back for it."
"A well balanced ""cascadian"" or ""black"" IPA that's a real pleasure to drink. Would highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Seems more like an English Barleywine to me, not bad, just not hop-centric enough to please me"
"Pours a black color. One inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hop oils, slight floral hops, pine, slight roasted malt, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Black Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, hint of floral hops, hop oils, citrus hops, and hint of sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and body. The blend and complexity are a little lacking."
""
""
""
"O- This is a darn good Black IPA and it even holds a candle to sublimely self righteous. It has an excellent hop profile and a really unique overall flavor to it. A great offering from Arcadia."
""
""
""
""
"Goes down smoothly, which belies the 8 and change ABV. A very good brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Alcohol is a bit hot, but the hop profile is complex, and the malt flavors support the hop character without dominating. A little on the sweet side, but worth a try!"
""
"O: This seems like a pretty standard Black IPA. I enjoyed my glass, but its piny hops coupled with roasted malt, black licorice, and alcohol flavors didn't make the beer stand out for me. I am not the biggest licorice fan (but have grown to appreciate it in other beers), so this still may be one for you to seek out. Despite the slightly below average rating in taste (made with style heavily in mind), I think this is a slightly above average beer overall. Reviewing seems to have drawn me to my least favorite characteristics of it, whereas I enjoyed it a bit more after the review finished and I was simply drinking it for the enjoyment that beer inherently brings."
"Overall, this is a great Black Ale: smoky, dense, but never overwhelming. And all the flavors compliment each other."
""
""
""
"O- This beer has full yeasty ester flavors with the hops being much softer. It is a nice beer but not much of a session beer at 8.5 % abv."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter, pours black with a thin head, even with a fairly rigorous pour, and leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas are somewhat odd, or at least not what I expected: Dank citrus, evergreen, mango, candy black licorice cigar. Tastes are well balanced and very complex with up-front citrus/grapefruit, tropical with sweet fresh pineapple and mango, then pine, anise, mint, and roasted barley. Wild ride, but comes together nicely collectively. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and resinous, finishes bitter, but rather refreshing. Alcohol is well concealed. This one was strange, but I really enjoyed it. I wasn't expecting the tropical flavors that were present, but it was well balanced, both sweet and bitter, and a pleasant surprise. I need to grab another one when I get the chance!"
""
"The body is medium with an evenly crisp and smooth feel to it. Carbonation is light and keeps it lively without overdoing it."
""
""
""
"This beer pours pitch black with strong anise and herbal hop notes rising strong. Tan head dwindles too quickly, leaving anise black licorice notes behind it's crazy. Aroma has sharp herbal hops, black licorice anise notes, dark roasted peppery base malts. Earthy flavor, alcohol flowing fully on each sip, dark malts and dark chocolate...it's unbelievable how harsh the beer is with explosive dark anise notes. Mouthfeel is dark roasted malt sweetness with a slight alcohol burn, dry fruity finish intertwined with black malts. Overall not a beer I'm looking for anytime soon, it's full of dark fruit herbal and earth hops, it's too wild for my tastes."
"O - This is a very well balanced black ipa. It has to be one of the top two that I have tried in this style. I will probably be in the minority since the hops aren't overwhelming. I prefer this style to be more balanced rather than a hop bomb."
"Good carbonation bite, medium body. A little sticky on the back of the tongue, definitely dry."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 4/24/2012. Pours almost pitch black dark brown color with a nice 2 finger tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big pine, grapefruit, orange rind, toast, roasted malt, herbal, earth, and light chocolate. Great aromas with big fresh hoppiness; and nice balance. Taste of big grapefruit, orange rind, pine, chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, herbal, and earthy hops. Moderate citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange rind, pine, chocolate, roasted malt, and herbal on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of hop flavors with the roasted malt. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a fantastic black IPA! Great hop and roasted malt flavor balance, and very smooth for 8.5%. Amazing stuff!"

"O - One of the best I've had from Arcadia, and one of the better black ales I've had."
"O- Definitely plays more like a DIPA than a regular black IPA. I'd say definitely worth a pick up"
"Overall I have to say that I really enjoyed this beer and I thought that this was a great example of an American Black Ale, the hop profile mixed very well with the malt base which made for a very complex and great tasting beer. This beer had great drinkability it was very smooth and hardly had any bitterness which I wasn't expecting, this beer went down way faster and if I had another one I would for sure drink it, the alcohol was hidden very well also, there's no doubt that a couple of these would for sure hit the spot. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I can't think of anything I would want to change, it's great just the way it is. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I wish it was just a little cheaper, but with a limited release I can't really complain. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I will be getting more in day or two and I highly recommend this beer to just about anyone, it's just that damn good. Arcadia did an awesome job with this beer, I have found that they can be hit or miss sometimes, but in this case it was a huge hit, I am now a big fan of this beer, and I think it's pretty safe to say that this is now my favorite American Black Ale, and one of my favorite beers from Arcadia, North Peak's Furry used to be my favorite but this beer is better in almost every aspect, I am glad they bottled this beer, I can see a lot more of this beer in my future."
""
""
""
"O- A really nice brew. Seems pretty unique at this point, combining the newer ""American Black Ale"" and Imperial IPA styles. Things work really well together. It's difficult to explain. It's something of a hoppy Imperial Stout, but not really. Glad I bought it. At around $2.50 for a single, it's not an everyday beer, but certainly doesn't break the bank. I would buy it again."
"Overall. Get me another! Oh wait, how much alcohol is in this?"
""
""
"not terrible, but I was hoping for better."
""
"I would buy this again looking for a unique stron ale, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hoppy stuff."
"Wow, this is a nice ""Double Black IPA"". This is a great beer from Arcadia.. there's something unique about it that I can't put my finger on. Well crafted.. I feel like it should have a higher score from me.. highly recommended."
""
""
"I have never been a huge fan of black IPA style, but this one sets the new highwater mark. A really good beer and one I plan to have many more of. Another winner from Arcadia."
"Toasted chocolate malt up front. Caramel and roasted malt settle in. Citric, piny hop bitterness gradually comes on. Some herbal, cannabis-y funk as well. Stays pretty-well balanced until the finish. Dries out, with lingering espresso and pine hop bitterness. Faint resinous notes in the end. Medium-full body with a slightly creamy feel. Nicely done!"
"Home run from Arcadia. This should give them some recognition then deserve."

"Had both on draft at Ashley's and the bottle. Smell of mostly roasted malt, some peppery presence, very little citrus or hop. Tastes of roasted grain and very little else, a watery roast to me, with little sweetness, muddled hops if any, just weird. Heavy mouthfeel for the style despite the lack of flavor. Nothing to really enjoy here for me. Bland, and no hop bite. An unfortunate miss by Arcadia."

"O - Very cool to get a tap only offering here in Columbia. Thanks, Sanford. Very nice brew!"
"Draft to tulip (at Hop Cat in Grand Rapids, MI, which is a PHENOMENAL beer bar. Everything about this beer is GREAT! The best black IPA I've ever had. Black as midnight with a great bouquet of hops and malts. The taste has great balance. And by balance, I mean the hops and malt are equally over-the-top and complement each other nicely. And the mouthfeel is great too. Surprisingly refreshing for its genre. I'd drink it again and again - if it was made with any regularity :("
"Nearly opaque black beer with ruby highlights in a strong back light from the summer sunset for my draft on site. Thick, light brown head with extremely tight bubbles. Clean and clear singular hop in the nose with a burnt biscuit and heavy malt underneath. First taste is burnt, charcoal tasting, but, oddly, no smoke. Heavy handed on the patent malt or similar? Very nice. Hops kick in quickly and the light spice and floral of the nose turns into a clean, spicy bite on the tongue. Well balanced and fun. Roast/burnt qualities mellow as this 8.5% IPA warms and is still refreshing on a hot summer night."
"I must admit this is pretty much the first Arcadia I have really liked, Hopmouth has become tiresome at this point even though I know it still sells."
"D- this was easy enough to finish. id try this one again if i could find it in a bottle. one of the better arcadia beers ive had in a while."
"D- The alcohol is well hidden and the flavors are robust but don't build on the palate. Very enjoyable."
"D: One is enough"
"Acquired during 7AM happy hour at Logan's Alley, this brew filled a pint glass with a magnificent, rich brown capped by a tan head. The nose was ripe with hop character and roasted darkness. The great malt character of this beer, with its mild roasted tones and subdued sweetness, mingled well with the hopping to produce a smooth and utterly drinkable brew while still boasting a large profile."
"It is a crying shame that Arcadia does not bottle this one. I do enjoy many of the offerings from Arcadia but can honestly say this is my favorite. Went down very easily and could see have a couple in a sitting. While many may not have the opportunity to enjoy this one, jump on it if you see it."
"Got it on-tap at Hopcat in Grand Rapids, MI"
"D_Pretty damn good."
"D- This was good flavored black IPA I thought. Arcadia seems to be on the ball and coming up with newer more flavorful beers. Do yourself a favor and try this beer out."
