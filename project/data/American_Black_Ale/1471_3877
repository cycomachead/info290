Looks pretty damn good, Imperial Stout-like with a thin brown head, but smells more like an IPA. I hoped for a more rounded malt and roast in the flavor profile, but mostly I just get west coast hops. Not my cup of brew.","Folderol","Oct 22, 2014"

Full bodied and loaded with bold flavors; a slow sipper for sure. Starts slightly sweet before the darkest of flavors, pure char, gasp-inspiring smokiness, burnt chocolate,black licorice (I get a distant whiff of a Sambuca burn) and cold coffee grounds take over at an intensity level that many might consider challenging. Not a beer for the newbies who prefer something "light," but right up the alley for lovers of dark beers that explore all aspects of beery blackness. What an unexpected pleasure.

The coffee flavor is true and earthy, with a light texture and enough gentle sweetness to keep it drinkable. You’ll get the full flavor of real coffee, rich chocolate, and mocha without the thick, oily mouthfeel that the flavors could imply. This beer isn’t a complex brew, but is rich and in balance, making it easily accessible, and should only be avoided if you hate coffee. Get adventurous and try it for brunch!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Aug 03, 2014"

Has the flavor of a stout but lacks the body of a stout while having the sweetness of a barleywine and the hop character of an IPA. Color me confused.

The taste is one of strong roasted malts, again malts are similiar to coffee (maybe java is better word), a chewey, almost bready beer that is dry but mixed with some bitter chocolate and I swear I get hints of both vanilla and dark fruits like figs. Simple but enjoyable sipper.","clayrock81","Mar 14, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, toffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted/dark malts; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, char, toast, toffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, cocoa, toast, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent robust porter style. All around great balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt flavors with big robustness; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 14, 2013"

The taste is smoke with some nice roasted malts and dark chocolate. Earth as well but not nearly as much dark fruit flavor as the aroma lead me to expect. Bitter dark chocolate with more roasted malts at the end. Medium bodied with a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Not sure what it is classified as but this one reminds me of a Porter. Regardless, pretty solid beer I'd have again. Good balance of the bitter dark chocolate and the smoke/roasted flavors.","PicoPapa","Aug 29, 2013"

First impression was that this more a porter or stout than anything, mouthfeel and aftertaste confirmed that impression. I was expecting a black "IPA" based on much of what is written, though a black ale does not an IPA make, despite what some beer " aficionado's" would have you believe. Overall, this was a decent brew that one can enjoy without getting hammered...unless you consume a lot. The only LIMFAC is lack of bitterness I've come to expect from this genre, of course some might find that more to their liking.","TheRougeBastard","Jul 27, 2013"

Then I entered into the equally complex taste. At first there were some big, roasty, chocolate notes. Then a deep caramel presence that adds a sugary, caramel-candy flavor that meshes well with the chocolate. There are dark fruit notes in the aftertaste that also lend some depth. The alcohol presence makes this beer seem a bit bigger than it is, but that doesn't bother me too much. Overall, this is an impressive beer that is worth trying.","tdm168","Feb 13, 2013"

Solid English style fruitiness ties together the toffee and caramel sweetness. Taste is rather like an RIS but dryer. Much. Lots of dark roasted malts and charcoal. No sign of the abv. Figgish plum fruitiness lightly shows before a mildly astringent swallow. Earthy hops, dry finish. Feel is lighter than you might think while still chewy, carbonated with a smooth, mild character. Superb drinkability being one of its best qualities. A good roasty dark ale that goes down well .","scootny","Jan 22, 2013"

The roasted malt is big at first, but I would say it's more like a quality, lighter roast coffee with it's fruity overtones...not like a dark espresso or french roast at all. The warmer this gets, the better. Medium body and smooth. Really nice all around! I've been wanting to try this for years and I'm glad it's finally available to me now.

Taste is charred dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans and chalky cocoa with some bittering hops in the finish. Full creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation going on.

3.68,-6.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The palate opens rather stout like. In some ways, this reminds me of aged Expedition - and that's a good thing. With a blend of mild, pine-like hops, licorice and rather robust roasted malt flavor and bitterness, this does command your attention. Unsweetened chocolate/cocoa and a little caramel are present, but this isn't as complex as the nose might suggest. I don't really get much of the delicate brown sugar and vanilla that I pick up on the nose. Quite thick and chewy, this has quite a bit of licorice and anise on the finish, along with a moderate bitterness. The hops don't really linger here. Carbonation is a little higher than I'd like, but other than that, I have no complaints. The intensity does hurt the drinkability, but I am glad I got to try this, it is an interesting and unique schwarzbier - stout hybrid. Thanks again, Vince!","DefenCorps","Jan 24, 2011"

4.12,4.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12oz bottle from Wolverine Market in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours an opaque black with one finger of tan head and sheets of lacing on the pint glass. Smell is chocolate, roasted barley, vanilla, burnt grains, doughy cake batter, cream, baking sugar, faint woodiness. Taste is roasted and black malts, coffee grounds, bitter dark chocolate, floral and earthy hops, mildly astringent bitterness, touch of smoke, ashy, charred aftertaste with a little toast in there as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, average carbonation, silky creaminess mid-palate, ultra dry and chalky finish. Overall, this beer exemplifies the American Porter style very well, so I'm not sure why it's classified as an ASA on this site.

For being the ABV and style that it is I was surprised it didn't pour as thick as initially expected. Never-the-less it was still nice. The smell was of dark things, specifically coffee and dark chocolate but I do believe that i detected a hint of what may have appeared to be orange zest floating around amongst the heavy aromas. The taste was quite a lot like coffee and dark chocolate the bitterness that would be expected with those two flavors comes right along with them. Overall, I do however enjoy the taste of this one and it warms you up a bit too. As i said previously I felt this would taste better if it was a little thicker, but it's not too bad.

It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a half-finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises light coffee, semi-diluted roasted malts, and dark chocolate. The taste holds notes of bitter coffee, bitter dark chocolate, dirt, and some shavings of charcoal. The body is decidedly medium, with a light moderate carbonation and sorta thick feel. I had had this beer before, on-tap at a local I-Talian restaurant, and wasn't too thrilled by it but wanted to give it another chance. This was it, and I am still not feeling this beer. The taste just seems off to me in a way I can't really pin down.

Some strands and swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals malt and cocoa and the merest suggestion of dark fruit and perhaps a metallic quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, metallic quality is not present, but a roasty, coffee character comes out, as well as a hint of lactose and a light, hops bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel falls just shy of medium with a little creaminess upfront, followed by a lively carbonation level. Not sure why this is classified as an American Strong; it has American Double/Imperial Stout written all over it. This is a really tasty brew I have to say. Dark Horse does an exceptional job with its stouts (yep, that's how I'm classifying it) and this is another solid offering from this brewer.","Jwale73","May 04, 2010"
3.97,1,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a slight head of dark brown which tends to then congregate around the glass walls, minimal lacing. Typical jet black liquid, fully opaque and impenetrable without a hint of color. The nose is all about heavily roasted coffee, chicory, malt, hard caramel candy, charcoal ash and tar, soy, at times it seems like citric or floral notes trying to get out but kept locked in the trunk, absolutely takes pains to make you notice it, might be able to benefit from some hoppy balance. Medium-bodied, the carbonation causes an intense swirling sensation through the mouth entry, quite dry and semi-rough in texture. The roast far and away the dominant factor, coffee, dark chocolate, chicory, bitters, soy, less earthy and perhaps more leafy with a hoppy bite.

It is smooth with a Heath Bar like flavor of toffee and caramel malts while the coffee lingers into a bitter, well-balanced state.

It has a bone dry, black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with tons of earthy coffee-like character. There is a bit of chocolate malt sweetness which does add some balance, but for the most part it's all black patent and roasted barley goodness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine black ale. I would love to see this fermented with lager yeast, but I'll take this version any day.","WesWes","Mar 09, 2010"

3.77,-4.1,3.5,4,4,4,3,"This beer is a full bodied affair, very thick and syrupy and creamy. The beer has a very charred almost burnt molasses and dark malt flavor. There is some sweeter malts hidden deep underneath, but the charred, roasted, dark malts pretty much predominate. There is a slight ABV quality to the beer and there is some leafy hop in there on the back end. The aftertaste is very burnt wood taste on the tongue. I particularly like the sweetish, almost cherry chocolate flavors in the mid section of the beer, but they are way down below. The molasses and charred flavors, coupled with the leafy hop makes this a beer that is assertive. It's a decent beer for the right occasion. The aftertaste is probably the low point.","albern","Mar 05, 2010"

Very stout-like. Taste is of dark roasted, and sometimes burnt grains & beans - coffee, cocoa, nuts. Background holds some molasses like sweetness, dark fruits and a grassy hop prsence. Acidic and bitter at times, lacks in carbonation, dry and chalky finnish. Interesting beer that is halfway between a Stout and Schwarz, strong roasted grain profile, but bitter, lowly carbonated and dry finnish dont compliment the overall beer as well as it could have.","rfgetz","Feb 22, 2010"

The nose was redolent with chocolate - fudge, brownies, dark chocolate bars. Wow! Mouthfeel was thick and full with a rich chocolate flavor accompanied by light smoke on the tongue.

Tastes were of bitter roasted malts with notes of coffee and chocolate. Bitter roastiness really rides out all the way to the finish. Mouth-feel was smooth with plenty of carbonation.

The taste is considerably more hoppy than the aroma both in the mouth and in the finish. There is still a strong presence of the roasted malt and graham cracker, but they are firmly in the background. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer, but the style just isn't my thing. I'm eager to taste a beer that is traditionally malty that is successfully made hoppy. As is this beer has a very nice maltiness going on, but it is made into a mess by the hops.

A little bit of moist dough perhaps. Gentle coffee attack that carries through a mostly malty flavor and ends with a smoky finish. Thick mouthfeel. Slight touch of hops.

The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, coffee, and chocolate. There's also a nice lingering roasty bitter finish.

Molasses, some dark fruit, almost milk chocolate. Decent sized roast character. Kind of husky and grainy with a light nutty scent. Taste is much of the same. A bit all over the place but when together, it is nice. More of a roast presence than sweetness in flavor. Definitely a hop presence that doesn't work so well with the rest of the brew. This seems like a Schwarzbier/Stout hybrid with a hop presence that is a little over the top. Mouthfeel is actually nice. Creamy and the hop presence doesn't create a huge bitterness. Actually seems like a Schwarzbier type feel but a little bigger. A little smoky in the finish along with roast. Not overly bitter, again. Overall, fairly drinkable but not the most exciting brew in the world. It's interesting but still not completely convincing. Somewhat boozy, which hurts this one.

Caramel sweetness up front, followed by mild roast and semisweet chocolate, then dry cocoa towards the end followed by lingering cherry. Medium to full bodied with very low carbonation, a little heavy. Good stuff and an easy drinking bigger beer.

When I smelled it I knew it was either a baltic porter or a big stout. Chocolate malt, roasted and burnt, slight flavoring hops poking through, and carbon. The taste was big, bold, burnt at first then regressing to more of a nutty flavor. Bitter hops right at the end dry it out for the next sip. The mouthfeel is dry, chewy, and bitter.

A ton of roasted malt shows up later on in the flavor. Very tasty beer, although perhaps not the most complex. Creamy, full bodied, with solid carbonation. Liked this one a lot.

There's a lactic sourness I didn't notice before, and the up-front bitterness has had it's edge taken off by a milk chocolate sweetness in the background. I'd bet that that sweetness would develop further if I'd let the bottle sit a little longer. I like the balance and the interplay here.

The finish is marred by an astringent, sharp, almost harsh burnt bitter note, that is thankfully not too overwhelming. Notes of bitter, French Roast, black coffee, darkly toasted bread, a burnt acidity, and a acrid char flavor. This beer has a ton of darkly roasted grain character, it is actually a bit much, but on the upside I think that it is helping to hide some off flavors that are derived from a bit of diacetyl and perhaps some vegetal notes. In the end the dark malt is just a bit too much, if the gravity was bumped up a bit it might be more in balance.","Gueuzedude","Jul 08, 2007"

Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but not nearly as thick as a lot of Imperial and Double Stouts out there -- this enhances the drinkability considerably, as it makes Dark Horse a substantial, but not a huge, beer.

Nose is very roasty, almost ashy, with a solid dark fruity sweetness, and coffee undertones. It seems a little distant. I'd really like it to be stronger in the aroma. Flavor is anything from distant. Initially, I'm hit with flavors of deep roast and dark fruit, that fades quickly into a coffee bitterness that is accentuated by a very nice and clean bitterness from the hopping. The hop bitterness really hangs well into the finish as well. I like the interplay of roast and hop. Feel is thick, with a light carbonation. Its not syrupy at all, really making this one work well on my tongue. This is a very easy drinking big stout. I like that the flavors come together to a nice combination of sweet and malty and roasty and hoppy. Alcohol is not obtrusive. This one is deceptively drinkable and would get me in trouble if it were on the shelves around me. Very excellent beer.","kmpitz2","May 01, 2006"

Slight licorise on the nose seems out of place and funky, but then the flavor reassures you that this is fact one killer beer. Anise, soured milk. Roastiness is all over the place but kept in check with sweetly, almost Russian Imperial characteristics. Hoppy and bitter as all hell.

The nose- buckwheat honey, dark coffee, malt and brown sugar. The palate- dry bitterness. The dark coffee predominates, but there is an unmistakable bitter note that reminds me of Campari. I am also reminded of a slightly burnt marshmallow. A big beer with a long, dignified finish. There is just a bit of chalkiness that mars the mouthfeel, however.

The dryest finishing stout beer I have met in my short tenure as a guy who fancies himself a beer drinker and aspiring champion of beer. Stock stout flavors of coffee and chocolate and roasted malt challenged by hop bitters. Weird, yet foreseeable. Good shiznit. This is my second Dark Horse sample. Both times, the stuff has improved down the stretch. Watch the temperature I guess. So far, this brewer has made me appreciate the natural rawness of their styles. Realness. Purity.

4.58,16.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"OK, I was expecting something not like this. A double stout at 8% ABV? Not the ideal pre-dinner beer, but it's open, so here we go. The first shock was the appearance of what looked like motor oil pouring out of the bottle into my "borrowed" glass. Just a hint of mahogany highlighted the edges, and a nice tan head topped the beer and lingered for a while. The aroma was great, with dark fruits, roasted malts, and a it of herbalness. I typically discuss flavor before mouthfeel, but this one the latter demands attention. This beer is perfect for a big stout: Silky smooth, coolly enveloping the tongue, with the carbonation lifting the beer off the tongue on the finish. Best part, there's not a strong lingering sweetness that usually accompanies such a great mouthfeel. The flavor does have a strong black malt presence, and just a hint of caramel sweetness up front. Strong dark chocolate flavors develop, along with a touch of minty hop herbalness. Man, this stuff is great! I think this was about $8 a six pack. I may have to go get more before I go home. While a strong beer with respect to both flavor and ABV, I could drink a good bit of this stuff. This is one of those beers that make the effort of tracking down regional stuff worthwhile. (Also makes sitting in a hotel room easier as well....). Do yourself a favor and give this one a try. All too frequently "Special" beers arent that special. This one is Very Special.

Scents of lambic, rich imperial stout, alcohol, with tons of hoppiness. Merlot, chocolate, coffee, deep and roasty. Smooth and slightly creamy with a bitey carbination that snaps at you towards the end of the sip. Nice toasty dark hoppiness with a good bite.

Seemed rather thick at first sight, and right then and there I knew I had a true micro (or 'glorified homebrewer' as we sometimes like to say ; ) The aroma is amazing, and no matter what they wanna call this, Double Schwarzbier, triple Sweet Stout, etc, it's a super rich and malty dark beast, and the alcohol is barely discernable on both the nose and palate. Creamy mouthfeel, thinner than expected, with plenty of citrusy, aromatic hops, bittering hops, and roasted malts, all fighting for attention like paparazzi jockeying for a good photo op. Lingering, pronounced bitterness is not probably to everyone's liking but it is to mine. Notes of bitter chocolate, sour apple, and burnt toast. There's a lactic quality here that works out well, making for a more complex brew than one might expect from what at first glance seems like such a malt monster, so rather than be cloyingly sweet it's well balanced. Double Stout, huh? Not something that's done too often, and one bottle is probably more than enough bitter darkness to satisfy a couple of 'Guiness Draught' enthusiasts, as it's altogether a bit more challenging than most of the stouts you'll find. Nice dry finish too.","Chaz","Oct 21, 2004"

The flavor is a dark maltiness with a sour earthy taste, some cherry, and more distinct alcohol warmth. The downfall of this beer I think is that it really only presents a dark malt flavor without much complexity in the flavor.

The head is not large, but is an interesting rich brown color (maybe a bit reddish) and is dense and foamy with decent retention. Some lace tries to cling to the glass, but slides back down. Smell is dark-roasted malts and maybe a little dark chocolate and coffee. Taste is more complex than expected. Roasted malt bitterness (or is that the hops?) Notes of chocolate and coffee as noted in the smell, but also hints of dark fruit and maybe a little licorice in the aftertaste. Very dry finish with some astringency.

Dark tan creamy head that laced nicely. Powerful aroma of blackberries, blueberries, deeply roasted malts, mild chocolate, & some earthy hops. Bitter front end with massive roastiness & the blackberry flavor to back up the aroma. Some chocolate & caramel notes as well as peppery hops make this a complex & unique brew. Not sure what style this fits in (schwarzbier, porter, stout, double stout), doesn't seem like it fits perfectly into any of them.

Roasted grains. Coffee beans. Toffee. Culminates with a big bitter finish that likes to hang out like a fun but slightly unwanted guest. A hell of a beer. I just wonder why they don't call it "Special Reserve Stout" or something...","marburg","Jul 27, 2003"

4.38,11.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Delicious. This pours out black in the glass with an aroma of chocolate, lightly of black licorice and coffee. The taste is complex, with roasted, burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee. A nice dose of hops on the finish. This seemed more like a stout than a swartzbier, but hey, its a highly drinkable beer whatever the style may be.","proc","Jan 22, 2003"
4.58,16.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Foamy head of fat ass bubbles over pitch. Nose of chocolate butter creme, roasted walnuts and a hard working weed whacker. An amiable roastiness hits the buds straight off to meld seamlessly into a long, but mild-mannered hop bitterness that necessitates another sip be recorded as a ring of lace on your hard working pint glass. Simultaneously lush and refreshing. Great beer!","inebrius","Jan 09, 2003"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark jet black color, small lasting head, roasted coffee-chocolate aroma, black burnt plum-coffee-chocolate flavor, very burnt and dry bitter finish. Medium body with a soft, silky and creamy mouthfeel, I put my money on this Dark Horse, this is a winner! I really like this one.","maxpower","Dec 26, 2002"
4.03,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Black in color with a very nice looking cocoa brown head. Roasty and malty nose with some fruit and hops. Wonderful deep, rich, toasted malt flavor. Also there was coffee and fruit making this a very complex beer. My favorite aspect of this beer was a very mellow carcoal flavor, like one would get if the beer were aged for some time. This really was a pleasure to drink.","yen157","Dec 04, 2002"
4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"22 oz. bottle - crappy label... great beer! Pours an opaque black with deep mahogany highlights at the rim and base. The head is a full and creamy orangish-brown. It holds well and leaves some very nice lace. A simple swirl of the glass will bring up a thin surface covering. The nose is fruity and exceptionally roasty with lots of caramel and some mild floral/grassy hops. The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's gently crisp and creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with a light berry-like & apple fruitiness, becomes more caramelish and creamy as it warms with hints of floral hop flavor, and then unleashes an avalanche of bold, deeply-roasted coffee and bitterness into the dry finish. The bitterness lingers alongside short flashes of sweet caramel and deep roast. Although this beer is listed here as a German-style Schwarzbier, it is certainly not! It's much too over the top for that. And yet, it's very nicely balanced allowing the sweet caramel maltiness to show amongst a very deep roast (burnt) character and some intense bitterness. Rich and exciting!","NeroFiddled","Nov 21, 2002"

4.06,3.3,5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours darker than the inside of a cow! Head is colossal, creamy; the lace sticky thick sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both are a nice chocolate color. Nose is coffee like roasted grains, caramel, with hints of malt, very sniffable. The start is malt and somewhat sweet, the top is bulky, the finish is ponderously hopped, scantily carbonated, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, very quaffable beer, and a nice way to start the weekend, also well worth your trying.","Gusler","Nov 01, 2002"
4.38,11.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This medium bodied German black bier is so thick and dark light can’t even escape.  It has a strong roasted berry aroma and the complex flavor includes roasted malt and cloves.  The initial tastes do not include much of a hop presence, but there is a nice lingering light bitterness with the finish.","beernut7","Aug 10, 2002"
3.48,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a bad beer. There's actually a lot of citrusy hops for a porter since the darker, maltier beers tend to just eat the hop flavors and you can really pick them up in this beer. On the appearance, it really comes closer to a stout than a porter, but the flavor and aroma really fit in with the porter style. This beer gives me the impression that this brewery could really do some good stuff.","aracauna","May 28, 2002"
