Malts, but not much sweetness at all. Perhaps a bit of chocolate roast and pine. It tastes OK, but I’m not sure why they call it a black IPA. Almost no bitterness to it. There is a good malt body, with some chocolate and roasted notes trying to peak thru but no real sweetness either. It needs a whole lot more hops to be in an IPA category. Let’s just call it a very good strong porter.","Boto","Jun 12, 2014"

4.12,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is my second go round with a Black IPA, also known as an American Black Ale, and also known as a Cascadian Dark Ale. Pours a dark brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. It smells good. A shot in the dark I would say that there are either chinook or amarillo hops, I cannot distinguish between the two, perhaps both. There is some hop funk, resin, and maybe some grapefruit. I am getting some roasted barley. Wow that is exactly what I imagined a black ipa to tastee like. Thhere is a lot of chocolate and a lot of hop flavor. The last black ipa I tried tried tasted like a moderately hopped porter. A lot of grapefruit and resinous flavors. It does finish a bit hot but I do not mind that quality. Seeing as though I can taste both the dark elements of this beer; the dark fruit, the chocolate; and the IPA qualities of this beer, distinctly, I consider this beer a success.

Hops hit the palate first, followed by a mix of smoke, black and malt sweetness. This is a very unique malt profile in that the dark roasted flavors and the sweet malt flavors combine for a wonderful experience. The citra hops ride on top the entire time.

The big aromas from the nose kinda cancel each other out when it comes to the tasting, making this just a bitter, hoppy black ale as opposed to the separation of flavors I got on the nose. It tastes good, but it’s really a one-note kind of thing. The mouthfeel is a bit rocky, but it works, and the drinkability is good.

Flavors are very strong and forward on the tongue with a dark fruit sweetness and molasses robustness. The hops presence follows quickly, cleaning everything up with a drying and pungent bitterness, with lots of wet, green characters. The aftertaste is almost all coffee, both in roast and bitterness. There is a resiny and mid-linger finish to the brew that slowly dries in mouth until it is clean and clear.

The finish is pretty dry and a little acidic. It leaves the teeth feeling a little gritty. It has a pretty bold flavor that's quite bitter and a little sweet. Flavors of mandarin orange, toffee, dark chocolate and pine resin mingle through the taste. Both the citrus flavor and the roasty, almost ashy, flavor linger well after the swallow. This is pretty richly flavored, so it's not really for chugging, but I don't let that stop me. I'm a big fan of this style and these guys did a good job with it.

Intense dark chocolate and espresso clobbers the palate, with grapefruit playing more of a supporting role and butterscotch and nut rounding out the finish.

Based on the flavor description I just gave, if you don't like ALL aspects of oranges this brew is not for you. Just overwhelming with orange.

Great timing with hop additions.","DrinkingDrake","Apr 29, 2011"
4.17,10.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O-A very good representation of the style and one of the better ones I've had. I'll buy this again for sure.","Lerxst","Apr 29, 2011"
3.9,3.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink but isn’t that sessionable due to its high alcohol content and the strong amount of dryness.","metter98","Apr 19, 2011"
4.18,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I think I've reviewed enough black ales recently to say I really enjoy this one and it's a great example of a great style. Organic? Yeah that's awesome, too!","OldIronLungs","Beers"
4.16,10.6,5,4,4,4,4.5,"I should say more than just ""piney hops"" but I can't help it. Regardless, this example reminds me of the Otter Creek and Rock Art offerings. It doesn't hit you with hops and as much as I hate to say it (much to the chagrin of session ale advocates), it's one of Peak's better offerings.","Brad007","0"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D: This is a very well balanced beer. The hops mesh well with the malts making it an extremely smooth beer to drink. The ""Black IPA"" style is one of my new favorites and this is a great example of the style.","mavbrew","Apr 18, 2011"
4.11,9.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clearish very dark brown with two finger thick, creamy tan head, fades over a couple of minutes, leaving chunky rings of lace behind. Smell: pine and pink grapefruit, roasted and burnt bread notes. Taste: grapefruit segments, piney, herbal, more than just a touch of alcohol, but it works here. Mild roasted and burnt flavors with a hint of high cocoa chocolate. A mouthful of C-hops, juicy and bitter with a drying semi-sweet finish. More than the usual black malt flavors. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Tasty, and organic to boot.","babaracas","Apr 16, 2011"
3.15,-16.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"I thought the hops dominated this beer, and not in a good way. I love hops, but this beer was way too aggressive for me.","lordofthewiens","Apr 16, 2011"
4.23,12.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O) Not a gateway beer. Definitely for Hopheads but porter and stout lovers might find some favor in the taste profile.","u2carew","Apr 15, 2011"
4.15,10.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Very nice, the hop aroma is spectacular and it works well with the dark malt. The bitterness is very strong and it lingers on the tongue to such a degree that it is almost overwhelming. This is a really nice beer, and it shows that organic beers can be excellent on their own merits when they don't rely on the organic label as their only selling point.","nickfl","Apr 14, 2011"
3.98,5.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a pretty solid black color with a creamy frothy khaki head that just wont quit. Spicy resinous pine mixed with hints of roast and a slight mineral/earthiness. This on fills my taste buds with and enormous resinous hop bite. Hints of roasty coffee break through and mix with the resinous hops, like drinking coffee out of the bong pipe. Bone dry finish with long lingering hoppy roasty aftertaste. Medium level of carbonation, medium body, slick resinous mouthfeel. I enjoyed this. This is another solid brew from a brewery that seems to be finding ways to get out from under the radar.","johnnnniee","Apr 14, 2011"
4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark brown, finger of light khaki head. Nose is pleasant citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, light roast. Taste is loads of fresh hops, feels like I am breathing hops after each drink! Fresh pine, loads of bitterness, grapefruit, coffee and roast, could use a bit more sweetness and body to balance all the hops, though I love the hop presence. Lower astringency than some black IPAs, pretty enjoyable. Thanks Rob!","ritzkiss","Apr 14, 2011"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O- A really good ABA. I was impressed by this offering from peak organic. The hops could have actually mellowed over time and still been great.","busterthecat","Apr 12, 2011"
4.45,18.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Wow this is one black beer,many of the style pour more of a deep chocolate color but this is impy stout ink black here,a fluffy one finger tan colored head atop.Spicy and resiny hop hit ya in the nose along with a little brown sugar and raw earthiness,hops command the aromas.Earthy and very dry on the palate,a little dark bread and very light molasses notes as well,it becomes really spicy after a few sips.Iam gonna say this is what this style is supposed to be,its spicy and hoppy with a real dark bread element to it,this is a damn fine beer,for me its a standard for the style.","oberon","Apr 11, 2011"
4.18,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: great beer - I'd have it again. Good balance between an IPA and a black lager without losing any flavor","Holland","Apr 09, 2011"
4.12,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall not bad, a bit astringent and light on the overall malts, nice fresh hops.","jlindros","Apr 08, 2011"
3.71,-1.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"overall a decent take at the style, but the tobacco qualities are the most dominant. not my favorite, but an excellent value, and one I could see picking up on occasion.","silentjay","Apr 08, 2011"
4.75,26.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Y for the rice. I am going to try to stock up on this.","Stoneyrok","Apr 04, 2011"
4.23,12.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I am not the biggest fan of the Black IPA but this is really good, I think those that like the style will like this it is worth giving a try.","Casey10","Beers"
4.3,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - One of the better Black IPA/CDA/ADA that I have tried.","ktrillionaire","0"
