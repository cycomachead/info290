"More of a deep brown in color and not much light seeps through.  A fingernail of khaki colored head covers the top.  Brussels lacing.  Enticing aroma of fresh,piney hops is moderately present.  The flavor is a well balanced blend of piney hops and caramelized dark malt.  There's a prominent pine hop edge that stays with you in the fade.  The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy."

"Not a fan of this style to begin with and I think this one was starting to lose some of its hop bite."

"Pours with a huge head that leaves copious lacing on the glass. I'm not the biggest fan of the black IPA style but I have no complaints. The malts provide a slightly sweet caramel flavor the melds well with the citrusy hops (the bottle says the hops are piney and citrusy, but I get more citrus than pine)."

"Beer poured into a ""pint"" glass from a 12oz bottle. Pours black with an off white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of flowery hops with a touch of pine. Tastes of darker malt with nice hop bite, citrus notes coming forward. Beer is light bodied with good carbonation, finishes great. Overall a very good beer."

"Pours brownish black. Tan head. Earthy hop taste. Flowery smell. Interesting twist on an IPA."

"Very nice hoppy aroma. The hops are more subdued in the flavor letting the medium roasted malt shine a bit. A touch of rye and anise spices are a welcomed component and meld well with the malts. Again the aroma is where this beer shines. This drinks like a session Black ale. I could easily knock down several of these in a setting."

"a hoppy black ale that combines sweet and roasted barley and chocolate malt with a rather delicate, if high volume, citrusy hopping. a very interesting marriage of flavors here. not as black as expected, dark brown glowing amber in the light under an inch of off white fluff that settles slowly. the nose here is citrus hops and roasted barley with all of its attendant bitterness. seems brighter than it looks, and a sturdy ale yeast ties the two together. the flavor starts and ends with the dark malt. not brutally dark, but earthen and well roasted. the hops are only in the middle, not in the finish, which i find odd and enjoyable. lemons and even kiwi fruit are coming from the hops, a very cool palate, before the wave of dark barley washes them clean. id like a little more body in this one, the flavors are great but the journey from a to b is too short. carbonation could also use a little kick up. overall though a very cool beer from new glarus. thanks to drlovemd87 for bringing this one back for me."
""
""
""
"overall great job new glarus. real impressive."
""
""
""

"Overall a great buy from NG. If you're a hop-head, you can't go wrong with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy and dark. Like mentioned above the flavors are complex, but do not clash. The flavors weave together to make a very enjoyable brew!"
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark russet brown with a fine half finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, pineapple, sweet malt. Flavor of biscuit, lightly toasted malt, citrus and grassy hops with hints of coffee and orange family citrus; finishes with grapefruit rind and citrus hops bitterness. Medium bodied. A nice black ale with good hop character; not quite as toasty and dark malt as a Northwest style (CDA), but pleasant and well made for a black IPA."

""
""

"Post review addition - Just learned from a fellow beer aficionado that this beer is in fact a Black IPA"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Very easy drinking and enjoyable with a solid mix of character. I would drink this again."
"Overall: Pretty solid and tasty black ale. A nice hop and malt blend that rolls off the tongue. 6.9% too. A trip to Wisconsin is seen in the immediate future to get more."

"O: Really tasty and easy-drinking black IPA. Very light on the roastiness which is unusual for this ABAs.."
"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is more like a regular IPA than the style they were going for in my opinion."
""
"This has a real pleasing flavor with the grapefruit hop profile coming across each sip. Thereâ€™s a dry finish with a touch of cocoa nib on it. I liked it."
""
""
"O- This has a nice N.W. Coast hop profile with good black malt notes without the bitterness. This is a nice session beer with lots of character."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall- a real winner here, I have tried it several times now, some days I think it is amazing, some just good to great, either way always a good choice."
""
""
""
"Still, amazingly flavorful while remaining eminently refreshing."

""
""

""
""
"O: A nice black IPA with great balance and drinkability. Black IPAs are usually hit or miss with me, and this one is a hit. Recommended"
""
"This is clearly a brew meant for knocking back a couple pints. The beer is quite tasty, though I think I prefer the juiciness of the aroma a bit more than the flavor; heresy perhaps, but the body / malt is almost a bit too light to fully be able to support the hop character in the flavor department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very very good. It isn't over the top, which I'm learning that New Glarus is very good at that. It's a lot more mild than the big black ales I've had before, but it still holds the same qualities of a great one."
""
"Its a very good black IPA. Don't think I've had a better one in a while, if ever. As a guy who loves Black Butte Porter/Eddy Fitz Porter/etc., I would like a bit more of that roasty malt presence in a Black IPA- that is what would really do it for me. Anyway, if you like both IPAs and porters, this is an interesting one for you to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - Decent black IPA. It is much like the rest of the New Glarus offerings in that I was expecting much more out of the beer than it actually provided. Another beer from NG that I feel doesn't live up to all the hype. I just wish that the minds at work in New Glarus Wisconsin would be a little bit more bold when it comes to their brews. However, I may be tainted by trying to compare it to Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale."

"i think aside from wookey jack, this is one of my top black ipa picks. too bad it's not available here!"
""
""

"O - Its not really a black ale, but its still pretty good, but there's better black IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: wanted more from the hops personally. Still a very good beer."
"Ours with a small head of off white foam on a very dark brown body. A nicely spicy hop aroma with notes of pine and citrus. Thick malt up front with a nicely balanced hop character. Notes of orange and grapefruit and light roast in the finish. Very drinkable, this has a great hop flavor and just enough dark malt character to make it more than an issue of appearance."
"O: Its a nice balance when I want the hops from an IPA and the malt of a stout and drinks much easier without the bitterness that some nights turn me off from an IPA."
"O- This was a slightly above average black IPA. It was good and had a nice aroma/taste profile but there wasn't anything about it that made it stand out too much. Definitely something that I would drink again, but nothing that I would necessarily seek out."
"O-well balanced and very good beer, not quite as complex as I would have expected but still a great brew"

"A really good black IPA. The smell mixes hops and malts quite well, and the feel is excellent. Taste is the low point, but it's still pretty good."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of fairly low intensity, resulting in a smooth, though somewhat overly placid mouthfeel. Closes semi-dry, with significant stickiness lingering on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great black ipa. It's got alot going on that gives it great complexity and balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the Black IPA for someone who wants to get into more beers of this style. Very hop forward with a citrus nose and citrus taste with light pine. There is very light roast to get the dark black hue with slight off white head. I prefer a bit more roast when I settle into a Black IPA but this beer drinks so smooth. Regardless of style this beer is very drinkable and worth seeking out. One of the better Black IPAs I've had."

"O - I really liked this beer, everything went together very well and was surprised that I like it so much. Will definitely be added to my New Glarus hauls."

"A very nice black ale and a bit potent. Cheers, New Glarus!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a perfect blend of a dark ale and an IPA. I have to say this beer pulled it off combining two opposing flavors - the roasted malts from dark ale and bitter hops from the IPA. I do not recall last time I had a black IPA so this will be my baseline comparison. Its one of those beers where I could have 2 or 3 in a single day - pretty sessionable."

"Black Top Black IPA from New Glarus pours a deep, dark brown that boarders on being black. A thin, light tan head settles atop the brew while providing a solid amount of lacing. A rich bouquet of hop aromas entice the drinker to get a deeper whiff. Aromas include tropical fruits, pine resin, grapefruit, and orange zest play out over subtle hints of roasted malt and a touch of chocolate. On the palate the brew melds together a perfect balance of floral, citrus, and hop flavors over a wonderful caramel and chocolatey dark malt base. Superbly balanced, Black Top is well carbonated and features a silky medium body. Please ship to Colorado!"

"O- Definitely an interesting beer. It seems to bridge the gap between IPA and Black Ale quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goes down very easy and won't knock you down. A very solid Black IPA. Recommended, thanks Jparker37"
""
"Roasted grapefruits and orange peels. Earthy, citric, bitter, and cleansing hops mix well with an oven roasted malt flavor of almost burnt bread crust and a little bright coffee. Bitter and easy to drink overall. Clean yet slightly oily palate."
""
""
""
"O - this beer is quality and I can't say I've really not had anything quality from NG; that said, this is the first non-fruit-driven NG beer I've had. It's traditional for the style, hides the 6.9 well, and provides a solid amount of balance and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Tasty black ale, decently hopped, and with the typically superb NG malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: nice solid, highly drinkable Black IPA. I'm not the biggest fan of this style, but this one is rather nice."
""
""
"O: A much better-than-average example of a style that I keep trying (and thinking one day I *might* like). Balance, aroma and flavor all generally worked for me and the look is superb. Glad for the bottle ~ thanks, Barry!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge hop flavor. Tons of citrus and resin. Carbonation could be dialed down a notch. Malt presence is fairly subtle. Yeah, if that carbonation was right, this would be stellar."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid black ale. Hops stand out at first but the dark roasted malts are very solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The black IPA is a difficult beast to master, but this beer is very well done. Nails the balance between hops and malt, and while I'm not sure I'll ever have a black IPA that really wows me, this is one of the better ones out there in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty drinkable. Probably on the less hoppy side compared to most other black IPAs. Fairly solid, just like everything else New Glarus puts out."
""
"3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5"
"O- I love a beer like this that finds that perfect malty/bitter and citrus/pine balance. On paper flavors would seem to clash but this one is extremely drinkable and delicious. Year-round fresh Black Top makes me happy."

"o - Overall a really nice Black IPA; loads of pine and roasted malts which work really well together. If you're a fan of this style, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite nice. Not as hoppy as I like my CDAs, but thankfully the roast has not subbed in for the hops. Like a Bitter is to an IPA. Just a nice hoppy, easy drinking beer. I'd love another and would buy again."

"This poured out as a very deep brown color, a decent looking tan colored head on top. The retention settles leaving a thin film over top of the beer and a scattered lacing. The smell of the beer is aromatic, it's got a nice piney hop aroma blended with the roasted earthy malts and chocolate in there too. The taste is really balanced, it's got a hoppy flavor upfront with a chocolatey roasted aftertaste. It's not nearly as hoppy as some of the Black IPA's out there. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's rich and slightly creamy. The carbonation is really nice also. Overall this is a very good beer, high drinkability with a lot of flavor. Enjoyable for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was an interesting black IPA. I would like abit more IPA aspects though in this beer. The notes that are there though are quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a dark black color with a few centimeters of tan foam that quickly receded. The aroma is pure hops with pine and citrus pummeling the senses. This continues on the palate. The dark malt does try to break through with some smooth dark burnt flavors but it never quite makes it to the stage. The piny hop resin and citrus and floral hops plow through front to back. A nice tasting brew with a heavy hops presence."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very good stout (says on the label), even though it is considered to be an American Black Ale; dark roasted flavors come on strong at the beginning and disappear pretty quickly, leaving behind a pleasant reminder of the good beer you just had"
""
"Overall: Wish I had some more of this stuff!"
""
""
"O - One of the best Black IPAs I have had. All the flavors blend well and it is quite a treat. If you have never had a Black IPA it is hard to find one better than New Glarus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good not great black IPA. I do like the piney hops. I would not turn this one down, but there are others in the style I would go to first."
""
""
""
"The beer feels odd in the mouth. Not crisp, not creamy, not slick. Lots of carbonation that leads to more of a stomach-feel than mouth-feel. Doesn't work for me."
"Overall: A nice dark IPA from New Glarus. The malt provides color but not too much flavor."
""
""
"My brother would tell you otherwise, but lets just say he got to finish the six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another excellent brew from New Glarus, a very balanced hoppy black ale in a style where subtlety and balance are not often appreciated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A very good beer. Personally, I'd prefer just the slightest bit more dark malt presence and a hint more hop flavor."
""
""
""
"This amazed me less as I went through it, but it's a fine drink and enjoyable drink, overall."
"4.0 D: Solid all around, this is not something I usually say about a black ipa."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a decent Black Ale. Plenty of hops and roasted malts but falls on it's face towards the end of the taste. Way to watery which almost drowns out the flavors for me."
"Overall- This is probably my new favorite New Glarus and black IPA in general."
""
""
"Well, New Glarus continues to make solid, if sometimes unspectacular, beers. I love having them accessible, affordable, and never a bad bottle or qc issue. Having said that, this batch isn't quite as vibrant as last year's."
"O: Very solid black IPA. One of the better ones I've had, and probably the easiest drinking one that I've had. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
"Pours a dark, cola brown with good, light khaki head, some sticky lacing. Scent brings balance of piney and citrus hops with a sweet and lightly toasted malt backbone. Piney hops at the front with some citrus notes, malts have an odd combo of lightly sweet and burnt, almost molasses like. Strangely bubbly and lighter in body. A little too light on the hops and ""interesting"" on the malts for me to love."
"Not a remarkable beer, not bad by any means, but not something I'll long for. Great example though, just not my favorite style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown/black with a nice tan head that dissolves into nice lacing on the glass. Very appetizing, yet subtle, scents of citrus hops and a bit of roasted malt with a touch of pine. Taking a sip releases a sharp blast of dark roasty malts paired with orange and grapefruit, melding together perfectly...excellent! I think the carbonation level of this beer is perfect, as well as the viscosity, which is medium-bodied and perfectly fitting for the style. Take care not to drink this one too quickly. Another home run for New Glarus. Will definitely buy more than a single next time I see this."
"New Glarus delivers once again with Black Top!"
""
"O: I approve of the black IPA trend. Surprisingly drinkable for how bitter it is. Does NOT destroy the palate. I would have liked a bit more of the sweet scent to translate into my tastebuds, as this guy is a little too charred for my liking, but I would gladly buy another 6 of this guy."
"O: Decent Black Ale, easy to drink at first but a bit cloying and overwhelming with the sweetness of that particular hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I haven't had many different beers of this style. I can only imagine that many tilt well to one side or other of the malt/hops balance. This one steers a very successful middle course. Flavorful and very nearly quaffable."
""
""
""
"Another home run from New Glarus, this is really great."
""
""
""
"O: Really nice, mild flavors, and extremely easy to drink. Another winner stout from NG."
""
""
"Black Top pours a light bodied dark hazelnut brown that turns to a black as it pools. It has a nice and soft one finger beige colored head and the beer has amber highlights in the light.The nose is clean and hoppy. It's slightly floral and grassy with no roasted notes. I didn't expect that but welcome the change of pace. The flavors are clean and soapy. It's slightly floral and grassy and has a little malt sweetness to it and very light roast. It has nice flavor. It drinks light and dry. I'm a fan. If I had been blindfolded I would have thought that this was a standard IPA and I love that. I wish more breweries were able to capture that aspect."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Another excellent creation from New Glarus. However â€” and I hate to say this â€” I think I prefer Summitâ€™s Black Ale."
"Overall - It's a flavorful yet unique style of IPA that deserves to be tried out at the very least. It's not perfect but it's worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Even being in Wisconsin, I've had a hard time finding this beer. I'm going to drink it as long as it's available. This beer is brilliant, world class."
"Cost: $9.99 for a six pack."
""
"When I received it in a trade with Willseph, it was moderately fresh! I guess I'm to blame for not cracking it open sooner... it's very good as is, so I bet it's even better when it's not 8 months old."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet with a nice pine hop finish and a little bitterness from the hops and the grain, a decent drinking beer, one of the better simpler black ales I've had, I would have it again."
"Pours very dark brown with a nice two-finger off-white head. Good retention and some sticky lacing as it falls. The nose has some nice pine and roast, plus backing citrus. Flavor meshes the hops and the backing roasted malt quite well. This is how an ABA should be done. Body is medium with a touch of acrid roast dryness plus hop bitterness cutting through. Quite good."
""
"Overall this beer is fantastic. It's a fruity, chocloaty masterpiece. Highly recommend picking this up again."
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a quarter inch of beige head. Nice aroma, with scents of pine, hop resin, roast. The roast character is definitely secondary to the pine and hop flavors. Easy to drink, with a lingering taste of pine and a hint of chocolate. Overall, this was one of the better examples of the style I have yet had."
""
""
""
"A delicious black IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a mildly hoppy Black IPA that was very easy going down, and had an enjoyable aftertaste..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Andy, I hope you enjoy this review, because I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Thanks again!"
"While I'm not a huge fan of the ABA style, I find Black Top to be one of the most enjoyable beers that New Glarus has put out. It has fine balance and complexity, and it's a beer that can be returned to again and again (I recommend this while ice fishing). Definitely worth trying for yourself."

"Another big thanks from 2BDChicago for the never ending Secret Santa haul. 12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 53 degrees. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, half inch, fizzy, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it dissipates into a consistent quarter inch froth. Swaths and spatters of lacing coat the walls of the class during the tasting. Nose expresses earthy/piny hops in the foreground and a suggestion of chocolate malt in the background. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a slightly metallic quality in the middle and the malt profile is very much subdued. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation that leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. There's also a little bit of acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. Overall, a pretty good representation of the style; however, I prefer something a bit more malt forward. Well worth your time if the opportunity presents and you tastes lean towards the hoppier end of the spectrum."
""
"O: The bottle lists this as a Black IPA, so that is what I'll rate it as. Sure this one is packed full of charred malts and citrus hops, but there is no balance between the two. Actually there is disharmony and, while this beer isn't a bad beer, I'm just not feeling the love from it either."
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Pours extremely dark amber. The red coloring only shows when held up to light. Not much of a head here. Holy shit, great scent! Piney hops right in your face, but not enough to think you're going to drink Pine-Sol. Mouth watering. The hops are definitely up front on this one. It finishes up sweet, and I wonder if that's the molasses they said was in it on the bottle. Another great effort from New Glarus. Cheers!"
"O - I am pretty critical of these new ABAs and prefer an opaque black color, huge hoppy nose, and as little dark malts as possible. This beer is not that dark, not that hoppy and a little on the malty side but these standards are nearly unreachable. I prefer Lakefront brewing companys IBA to this but this is an excellent interpretation of a new style that my guidelines might be construed against. Still another great beer from Wisconsin!!! New Glarus is great."
""
""
"D - This is the sort of Black IPA that I like most - low bitterness, big hop aroma, and only light chocolate and black malt notes. Crushable stuff, and with a great price to boot!"

"Slightly tannic, roasted coffee bitterness up front. Metallic twang as well. Caramel and fruit sweetness bloom in the foreground as roasted malt and hop bitterness builds in the background. Hop flavors of pine and citrus mix nicely with the milk chocolate, molasses, and dark fruit sweetness. Lingering citrus notes in the otherwise caramel-fruit finish. Medium body with a nice, creamy feel. Don't know how fresh this is, but I can believe that the hops have faded a little. Still, I really enjoyed this beer!"

"O: Quite drinkable; balanced, with some complexity; an interesting style -- another good release from a leading Wisconsin brewery."
"O- a good black ipa mine was 2 months old so some of the hops may have faded, a solid tasty brew would like a fresher one, creamy malty and citrus inspired brew"

"The Black Top from New Glarus has it positives and a few negatives. The beer pours just about opaque, slight light still coming through...the head was thin, slightly off-white and is leaving a lacing. The smell includes pine, citrus, and chocolate. The taste provides hints of pine and slight bitter citrus. There are some tones of chocolate but not overly present. The mouthfeel is a good medium body with decent carbonation. Overall it is a very good beer. Besides being a great beer, other notable positives is that the abv is lower making this a decent session beer. One draw back is that when comparing against Stone Self Righteous or Two Brothers Black Hop Juice, just do not have the big double IPA flavors mixed with big roasty finish."

"I need to drink this back to back with O'Dells and Grand Teton's black ales, these three beers make up the exemplary models for style, to this guys palate."
""

""
""
"overall: good stuff"
""
""
"O - Solid brew, easy to drink. Very fine-tuned flavors rather than big in-your-face flavors like a lot of beers."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really nice black IPA from one of the finest breweries in America. New Glarus never lets me down and this is no exception, great hoppy flavors, great malty flavors, a job well done."
""
""
"Very disappointed by this one as I've loved almost everything I've had from NG before. It just kind of tastes liked a watered down porter."
""
""
"My first ever New Glarus beer. Had a friend grab some when he went home for Thanksgiving. Pours a dark brown with a quickly dispersing head. The smell is mildly hoppy with some nutiness. Has a good mouthfeel, not to thick or thin. Taste was bitter, then citrus, then hops, and finished with a dark wood/nut tone. I havent had many dark ipa's but this is one that I will for sure seek out again. Food pairings would be fun with this beer."
""

"Picked this sixer up in Platteville, WI at the Piggly Wiggly. Smell of citrus hops, maybe some pine and roasted malts. Brownish black pour with white head. A little sweetness to it and then the hops come in. Wow, is this a great beer! Toasted malts and hops mix well; New Glarus really hit a home run with this brew."
""
""
"O: A pretty good black IPA. I feel like Stone's 15th anniversary brew is the mark to hit for this style right now...that beer is just too good. That said, this may be more available than that is..."
"Cheers."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was a nice oil black color with a decent finger milk chocolate head. The aroma is bold and full of hops. Spice, pine, and strong citrus are all present in the nose. The taste is very crisp with a decent malt up front with hints of caramel and burnt grains. The finish is all hop. Most notably citrus almost to the point of over powering all the other flavors. Despite this the medium to light body and good carbonation round out this beer. A newer style with lose parameters this brew fits the bill and is a good example."
"Overall, one of if not the best black IPA I've had. Well balanced, not too rich, definitely a go-to for me."
""
""
"O- New Glarus is solid and this is another good one from them. Happy to get a chance to try this one, will try again."
"black pour with a big head of tan lacing; a near perfect balance of rich roasted malts, smoked notes, dark earthy, and piney hops. warming only brings the hops to the front even more and allows them to steal the show. quick hitting and bitter as the first sip hits your palate it was amazing how smooth"
""
""
""
""
"Overall it took me a while to get into this one but after it warmed I really liked it. I am still looking for a Black Ale/IPA to knock off Stone 15th Anniversary as the best in the category. This one is a must try if you are exploring the style."

"One of the better examples of the style - unique and expertly balanced."
""
""
"Overall: A great IPA and one of the best black IPA's I've had. A great pine hop profile that doesn't overwhelm but pleases. There is also a great balance with the malt and while 7%, very little alcohol taste."
""
"Pours a dark brown/black color with a slight fluuf off-white head. Scent has chocolate malts, molasses, and bitter hops in the mix. Basically the taste is a more robust version of an IPA. It still has a bitter taset throughout but is nicely complimented by the sweet tastes of chocolate and molasses. A very complex beer that overloads the taste buds at first making for a great sipping beer. A great brew using a more unique style that you just don't find too many of in your local beer store. A must try!"
""
"Nice, almost sessionable balanced IPA..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - Probably the most drinkable Black IPA that i've had. It depends on your mood and taste to decide whether that is right for you. This is almost sessionable but is 7%. It certainly is black, and it has a good amount of hop aroma. It's not exceptional in any way."
""
"O: Not too bad. I felt the flavor profiles were sort of fighting for dominance with the hops just squeaking out a victory. I still don't know what to think of this ""Black IPA"" style."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with great carbonation. It's hearty but at the same time easily drinkable. A well made beer as I've come to except from New Glarus. For a brewery that does not focus on hops too much I was glad to see them release this and hopefully it will be brewed again sometime!"
""

"Overall? Yum. For a brewery that shies away from hops for hops sake, they can sure hit the nail on the head when they want the hops to shine. Great malt profile on this one too. Just enough to keep the hops in check."
"Pleasant, clean, and easy drinking, this could almost qualify as a sessionable Black IPA. Of the for New Glarus brews I've tried thusfar, it is easily my favorite. Certainly worth a try, and one which I am glad to have a few more from that 6-pack in my cellar."
"Overall: I like this beer a lot, and will definitely seek it out again. It has a unique hops profile and a lot of character. Another exceptional brew from New Glarus."
"Hop forward but more in the flavor than bitterness, a pretty great example of the style. Very drinkable even with the complexities being thrown at the palate."
"O: Really like this beer, good black IPA. Itâ€™s well balanced, tasty, and very drinkable. Iâ€™ll seek this one out once thereâ€™s some more room in the fridge again."
"O- A great ""sessionable"" CDA. If you have the means, I highly recomend picking some up."
"O: this is a really nice example of this ""new"" style, easy drinker, well balanced, good flavor"
"(D)- A new style, but New Glarus simply nailed it with this new offering of theirs. A near perfect balance of what I have always looked for in this style but never found. A solid roasty backbone with a finish of citrus hops. Well done as always New Glarus. I am by no means an expert in this style, but I really think this is the shining example I have been looking for."
"Overall - Good beer, good balance. But it does a good job of creating a good black IPA."
"Overall a really good beer. It's a very good change of pace."
"O: I like this beer, and love the smell of this beer, but it fails to live up to the standards of what I consider a ""great"" go-to beer. Still, I would get this again."
"Black top pours a black color, with a nice tan head, that lasted with the beer. There is a nice dark hoppy smell, I would imange heaven smells like this. The taste has a realllly nice hoppy tone to it, but doenst over power; a dark sorrta flavor. Very nicely carbonated, not overpowering but not weak either, fantastic balance. Overall this is a fantastic beer, loved it, would easily get more."
"O- Good black ipa. Have had better bigger black ipa's, but this beer is easy to drink and has nice roasted malt and hop bitterness."
"O: I really like this beer. It's like a sweet IPA. Definitely picking up a few more packs of this bad boy."
"D/O: This beer's strength lies in its balance, which isn't necessarily the most likely feature to be expressed in a black IPA. Unfortunately it is also boring, unable to deliver that one-two punch of unlikely flavor combination that has made the roasty and hoppy style so suddenly popular. Perhaps when the dust settles and the style moves beyond the tumultuous throes of speciation, it will be the New Glarus Black Tops and Drakes Batch 3000s of the black IPA world that ultimately endure."
"O - Hops and malt work like a team throughout the whole stretch of the way, cruisin' for a wonderful finish of balanced beauty. Abundantly flavorful and good to the last drop, New Glarus' Black Top is one fantastic Black IPA."
"Overall: If you get the chance drink this Black IPA! I am new to this style, but I love this beer! Great first attempt at this style New Glarus Brewing CO! This beer really surprised me, I will be returning to Wisconsin for another 6 pack! If you see it try it!"
"This beer drinks more like a nicely hopped English Porter, or maybe its time for Black English IPA."
"A very sessionable drink, and a perfect afternoon beer for me. New glarus continues to impress!"
"With a good pour I get a foamy and pillowy 3 finger tan head. Appears fairly clear, and as a deep brown copper/amber. Lots of interesting aromas here. Bright, almost candy like fruit, grapefruit and even strawberry comes at me. Milder pine and citrus hops round out the overall bouquet. Nice hop bite up front with citrus character, perfectly rounded by a mellow roasted malt base, caramel, toasty, chocolate all present but not overpowering, especially given the color. There is a slight smokiness to the finish. Body firmly in the middle on this one, nice hop resin feel, creamy, overall very good, highly drinkable. Excellent"
"O - Nice representation for the style. Very light on the malt backbone and mouthfeel could be somewhat thicker."
"I gotta say, this is a stellar example of a Black IPA, easy, smooth with definite drinkability. New Glarus nailed this one in a big way."
"Overall pretty good, nice hop profile that really explodes, some nice malts to back it up, nothing goes over the top or out of place, drinkable and tasty."
"Overall, another good New Glarus beer. Could drink more than one in a sitting and the higher abv kinda sneaks up on you."
"Overall its a just a good black IPA, nothing to special but not bad either."
"D - pretty solid brew by New Glarus. Really nicely balanced and chock full of flavor on both sides. Highly recommended as this is a side of NG I haven't seen before."
"O. This is a solid, easy-to-drink offering from New Glarus. Tossing back a few in one evening wouldn't be a problem."
"overall, i find this a delicious beer, but isnt exactly within the style. I think I honestly prefer the moon man IPA offering from new glarus, but this is a nice change of pace."
"D/O- If I were blindfolded the thought of this IPA being black would never have crossed my mind. Cheers to Dan and Co. for tackling a newer American beer style even if they're the (domestic) masters of classic German styles. Highly recommended."
"NOTE: Even though the review score averages out to an A-, this is a B+ beer in my opinion"
"Pretty good beer. Generally I don't care for dark hoppy brews, but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Poured a lovely, light tan, thick, foamy, billowy head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a very dark, clear garnet with some bubble trails (seen with a flashlight). Aroma is very hoppy with pine, citrus, and pineapple predominant along with malt. Flavor is similar to nose and I don't pick up much of the roastiness that I expected. Body is good and ditto carbonation. Finish is fairly long, ending with fresh hop. Good drinking beer."
"Overall, the hops dominate but there's enough balance to prevent the hops from burning you out. I expected more malt flavor since it's a dark IPA but it's more hops than anything. The hop profile is good, a balance of pine and citrus hops. Another very well done beer from New Glarus."
"This was a very enjoyable beer and it's growing on me even more. I hope it hangs around."
"No trace of alcohol despite the nearly 7% abv. Easy to down more than a few of these, and well worth the trip to Wisconsin to pick some up."
"Pours a dark mahogony brown. Beautiful colour. Lots of off-white frothy head. Smells very hoppy. Some roastiness peaking through. Definitely very drinkable. Body is a bit thin but low carbonation levels. Despite not being a huge Black IPA fan this was fairly tasty. Quite sessionable"
"O- very nice beer. Good work. Another hit from new galarus."
"Overall, although this beer largely lacks the deep roasted character of a black ale, and it isn't potently bitter like many IPAs today, it was still quite a pleasure to drink."
"Thanks orbitalr0x for the bottle!"
"O - very solid, very drinkable, while the hops melded fairly nicely with the roasted malt components there were a few flaws that kinda stuck out a bit too much for me to be completely sold on this one"
"O) Wow.... Really enjoyed this beer. This is one more reason I am thankful to have New Glarus Brewing Co located in my neck of the woods."
"O: This is a really good beer and like the best of New Glarus it's perfection is slowly revealed. Any doubts that the Black IPA style is a gimmick should be dis-splled by this brew. And, the other myth of this style being only done well by the West Coast brewers is shattered. Another big win for a championship team."
"This is another great, drinkable brew from New Glarus. It's nice that they ventured into this style, it is one of my favorites. This is not the best black IPA I've had, but certainly one of the most drinkable, something New Glarus always keeps in mind for the Wisconsin consumer. This brew could benefit by more of a coffee and roasted malt flavor profile."
"All in all, another unusual (in a good way) offering from NG. Good work, people. Keep it up."
"Still a seemingly incongruous meeting of elements, these black ales. You dig it or you don't, although not all are created equal. This one is better than most."
"I'd heard great things about New Glarus before I moved to the midwest, and this beer did not disappoint. I've enjoyed this Black IPA above all others I've tried since the trend took off, mostly because the contrast of look/smell and taste is so pronounced. Looking forward to trying more New Glarus brews."
"Better than a lot of beers of this style. The black is not just color but has some flavor."
"*EDIT* Just saw this beer won gold medal at GABF. Impressive considering how competitive the style category is this year, it looks like I'm not alone in thinking this beer is the epitome of the style."
"This has become my second favorite New Glarus brew after their world-class Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"VERY NICE; WORTH TRYING!"
"This is one of the top examples of the style that I have had. I think this is one of the most drinkable ones for the style as well. This is an absolutely well done ""American Black Ale"". The nose is killer and the overall beer is a real treat."
"Now, the thing that this beer does exceptionally well is in the nose. This is the first beer in a long long time that I can remember smelling so good from all the way across the room from my pint glass, the nose really carries that far! Heady scents of pineapple / mango, pine resin, and roasted malts as if from a porter mingle together in a combo that really makes me salivate for some reason. Tastes of all the things promised by the nose and also some interesting interplay between a sweet caramel malt tone that plays hide and seek with a roasted more bitter malt, finish is relatively straightforward bittering...overall a fantastically well-executed BIPA."
"I'm not too familiar with Black IPAs, but I did enjoy this beer quite a lot, and look forward to enjoying it and other Black Ales again."
"Overall: I've had some top shelf beers in the last couple of days, but this is really standing out for me. I don't consider myself an IPA kind of guy, but this is everything that is right about IPA. As a matter of fact, I'm calling it a night as I feel I've reached the pinnacle."
"Overall I wouldnâ€™t change a thing. It will be interesting to see if some time changes this beer. Fresh as it is now it is amazing."
"This is easily my favorite new brew of New Glarus since the Crack'd Wheat. I have enjoyed Two Women thus far, but I thought the Edel Pils was a much better example of a similar beer in the New Glarus stash of recipes."
"It is still kind of jumbled but at least black ipas are evolving into something a bit more drinkable."
"D - Very strange combination. The aroma seems like a completely different beer than the taste/mouthfeel. Everything great about the aroma just disappears."
"O- I tend to look at Cascadian Dark Ales as a full-flavored beer that blows your palate but you can only have one or two a night. I could probably drink 10 of these if i had to, but thats not really a good thing. Its pretty watery and lacking the robust flavor promised by the roasty, hoppy aroma. NG tends to make more approachable beers, which this is, but maybe not every style needs to be made approachable. I would say this is the first New Glarus beer i've had where they really dropped the ball. Its a Black IPA, but not a very good one."
" ~ I fear the complexity that longer roasted malts should have offered to the brew is not here. At 6.9% I say it's out of the realm of sessionablity but it doesn't offer enough in the taste or feel characteristics to be something I would consider a good beer to sit down and really enjoy."
