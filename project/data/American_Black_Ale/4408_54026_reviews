"Overall a tasty, complex beer combining some great features of a dark malty beer with the pungent bite of hops. Well balanced, and ABV well hidden amidst the flavors."
"Has a reallllly good taste, for whatever it is."
"Nice blend here good mix of stout and black IPA very drinkable"
""
"Pours an extremely dark black with little to no head and decent lacing. Looks a little flat. Aroma is malty with a faint smell of hops. Taste is more malt than hops and this one drinks more like a very bitter stout than a dark IPA. Malt y notes are present but am having a hard time with the bitterness.."

"There is an odd fruitiness to the taste and aroma - almost like RJ used some fruit."
""
""
""
"This beer has a dual personality. It doesn't know if it wants to be an imperial stout or an imperial IPA. In the meantime, it is one enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is a way more hoppy and has notably more earthy/herbal flavor. Medium-high bitterness (IBU = 80)."

"Overall - my expectations were low, but this one was quite the diamond in the rough. I highly recommend this beer for RIS / Black Ale lovers."

"Picked up this one on a clearance from Butler's. Guess I should have known that it was a dark IPA with the name. Decent looking beer with not a lot of head. Not a fan at all, had a lot of maltiness but then way to much bitter that seemed out of balance and had the taste of an ash tray on the end, the roast with the bitter finish just did not work. A little bonus overall due to ABV. I was disappointed."

"Poured from a wax dipped bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown-to-black coloring with a thin, foamy, light tan head. Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, subtle resinous notes, licorice, some tropical fruit sweetness, and some pine notes. The chocolate and roast characters come up the most in the nose. Flavors are heavily roasted, and yet incredibly smooth. Chocolate and caramel blend on the forward tongue, with a rich, creamy backbone, some bitter and piney notes in the background, and a roasted, almost smoky highlight. Very well blended and balanced. The body is light and smooth, with a roasted, rich, and slightly bitter aftertaste. The finish has a bitter linger, both chocolate and hoppy. This is a solid, heavy, very tasty brew. Worth searching out."

"Black opaque bod with an inch of tan head that sticks around for the duration. Aromas include roast and chocolate first, followed by some hop and pine character. Pretty tasty brew here. I wouldn't have guessed it was nearly 10% abv. Medium bodied and well balanced. Moderate bitterness but not overpowering. A nice sipper."

"Malty, Roasty, Hoppy! Cant ask for much better. Great Beer, one of the finest in the RJ Rockers collection. Get ready for a ride to the Dark side of IPA brews. Very dark appearance , great smell and tastes awesome! Try it and you wont soon forget the Black Perle."
"O: Super lush and flavorful. Love the rich chocolate and bitterness orchestrated into a well balanced brew. This is a must try. Cheers!"
""
""
"This is my first encounter with RJ Rockers and it was definitely a good one! This offering pours a very deep black color with two fingers of tan head that gives way to a handsome light brown film and a significant amount of lacing. The nose on this one is light and unremarkable but carries notes of chocolate, coffee, lots of roasted malts and a little bit of hops. Honestly for a black ipa, I'd of expected more hops here. It seems closer to a porter than a black ipa. The flavor is rich and deep. Lots of coffee and chocolate notes with a very nice roasted malt presence and a touch of hoppy bitterness. This is a very well crafted ale. Possibly mislabeled, but very good and very drinkable. I look forward to my next beer from this brewer."

"O-Overall a good beer. Seemed more like a stout than a black IPA"
""
""
"Aroma roasted malt, faint floral/citrusy hops, chocolate, coffee.Taste coffee, bitter chocolate, pepper, bitter hop finish. Excellent!"
""
""
"I was pleasantly suprised with this offering.. I'd call it a hoppy porter rather than a ""black IPA"" or even black ale. Very nice ."
""
""
""
"very tasty and well made brew, if black IPAs are your thing and you don't want it to be just a psycho hopped IPA that happens to be black... stop and frisk this beer, you should dig it... good stuff."

"Overall: A very good beer, but a bit expensive. The presentation was great and it was a very fun beer to drink all the way through. I have nothing bad to say about this beer, only pretty good things. A surprisingly subdued beer, like it's been pre-aged or something. A very good beer, but not really a black IPA I don't think."

"Not sure where the IPA name comes from. Didnt get any hop taste or smell, the quintessence of an IPA. I would definitely classify this as an imperial stout - boozy, malty and smoky. Still a great brew though. And a killer bottle - love the wax. Just not what I was looking for on a warm day. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: One and done. And let down."
""
""
"Overall: An extremely roasty, burnt, and bitter beer that isn't for the faint at heart. Its appearance mirrors its flavours."
"O: I'm torn how to score this one. This is a tasty beer, and a solidly enjoyable porter. But it doesn't come close to me as a Black IPA. I think they either need to go back to the drawing board with the hop profile, or just relabel it as a somewhat-hoppy porter. I think I'll give scores for the beer overall. I'd estimate 2.75 for style as listed."
""
""
""
"O- Great beer, thought it was more of a bitter hopped porter than a black IPA but would get again."
""
""
"Quite sippable big dark brew. I wish I could remember where I came up with this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable and flavorful black IPA that is also remarkably drinkable considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
""
"Overall: nicely balanced beer in both malt/hop mix as well as coffee bitternes and chocolate/citrus sweetness. Very good."
"D - Not bad, but the hop character is a bit lacking, especially in the aroma. Still, the malt is handled rather well and I like that there is an assertive level of roast character but it is not heavy enough to be confused with a stout."
""
"O/D - An okay beer, seems to have a tough time getting an identity. A bit filling and a pretty potent alcohol punch makes a 22oz bomber a bit hard to get down."
""
""
""
"O - Black Pearle showed some real potential, but this American Black Ale from RJ Rockers has an issue. It's very faint in the aroma and almost undetectable in flavor, but the abundant and unnecessary carbonation is a telltale sign of problems (I should know, with all the homebrew I keep botching). Beyond that, I'd ask for more hop bitterness and flavor to combat the assertive malt profile in this Black Ale, but it's definitely drinkable and not offensive."
""
"Overall Impression- Once again, this style ALWAYS makes my head hurt, wondering what I should be looking for... This one was drinkable with malt covering up most of the hop flavors. Good all around and starting to enjoy RJ Rockers and their beer portfolio."
"O - Pretty good beer, although not the best example of the style. Dark and roasty malt flavors are fantastic, but it lacks the hop complexity that I love in Black IPA. Not bad for the price, but there are better options out there."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 9/23/2011 bottle code on the bottom. Pours pitch black color with a dense 2 finger tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big apple skin, roasted malt, chocolate, biscuit, and toast. Aromas are very off balanced, way too much apple aromas. Something went wrong here. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, char, coffee, herbal, pine, and earthy spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, char, pine, and herbal spiciness for a good bit. Nice balance of roasted flavors with hop bitterness; with a very robust amount of roasted flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9.5%; with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a nice black IPA that is quite robust with roasted flavors. Other than the obvious fermentation flaws in aromas with this particular bottle, it was still quite enjoyable. I will have to revisit this again and hope I get a better bottle."
"This strikes me more like a big porter than a Black IPA. It was fine, but I wouldn't necessarily say it is deserving of a wax coating. The impression I got is there are a ton of ingredients involved, but they sort of all wash out distinct flavors."
"O - a good example of the style."
"Overall: this beer doesn't really fall into an established category. It is technically an ale which is black which is made in America, but that's about as much as you can say for putting it in this style category. Still, it is a yummy beer I'd be glad to quaff again."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- A welcome extra with some good layers of flavor and big boozy background. Dont think I would have again but still good."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty bland with some roasty malt and herbal hop aromas. Taste is the same but seems quite watery tasting. There is a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with noting that really stands out in my opinion."

"Overall the best offering I've had from this brewery. Would definitely pick it up on my next trip to SC."
""
""
""
"O - Easy to drink. Flavors meld together. More porter or stout than a black IPA though. On its on, not judging by its category, it's a great beer."
"O: One of the better Black IPAs...itza nice!!!"
""
""
"Although we were all perplexed by the style indicated on the bottle - we fully enjoyed this beer."
"O - Overall, this was a pretty solid beer. I was hoping for a bigger showing of hops to fit the Black IPA mold, but got a much bigger showing of Imperial Stout type characteristics. That said, I think I'll try this beer again if I see it, as this newly developing ""Black IPA"" style really intrigues me."
""
""
""
""
"I like the flavors in this beer. It has really nice chocolate notes to go along with a medium roast. There really isn't much of a hop presence so it takes some style point hits."
""
""
"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a near opaque black with lots of suspended hop particles. Very good head and lacing. Aroma of roasted bready malts, alcohol and carrots. Hops and roasted malt give a nicely balanced taste as neither dominates. Nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel, but dry finish. This is a tasty and mellow version of an American Black Ale. Alcohol is well hidden for 9.5%!"
""
"O - overall this was a very good beer, drinkable despite being 9.5%, flavors not too overwhelming. a balanced and tasty drink. would recommend to others and will likely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another good black ale with a nice balance between the hops and the darker malts. Nothing is overdone; nothing is missing. Good drinkability."
""
""
"I'd call this a B+/A- porter but only a B- IPA, so I'll split the difference and give overall a B."
""
"solid example of this ""new"" style. I recommend!"
"O: I don't know... IMO this is giving Stone's release a run for it's money. Would like to try side by side. This might be a tad better blended. Would like to know a bottled on date to know if this had sat a bit. Definitely one you should want to try if your a fan of the style."
"Pours a dark brow, with some deep burgundy highlights. Not black (listed as a Dark IPA) so I'm not docking any marks. A few fingers of a brown tinged khaki head. Great retention and lacing. nose is less impressive, some muddled and certainly not outstanding hopping, sweet dark fruits, burnt brown sugar. Not alot of IPA character to be found. Taste starts with the dark fruits again, and finishes roasty with some faint coffee flavour. Mouthfeel is too thin and roasty for my liking, with a bitterness that's just as undesirable. Medium carbonation. Moderately interesting overall, but I'm not picking up any real ""IPA"" qualities per say. Leans towards more of a moderately hopped English porter than anything. Meh."
"Overall a good quaff. Very drinkable for 9.5%. The alcohol is well hidden by the heavy malts. I would buy this again and recommend it to others...if nothing else for the cool bottle. But it happens to taste good too."
"MUTED."
"Tastes pretty damned good, but is this really a CDA? I say no, but it's a heckuva imperial stout. Thick, creamy and loaded with chocolate, roast and hoppy goodness. Booze is alarmingly well-hidden. Sticky, coating mouthfeel is equal parts sticky chocolate and burnt malts. In the interest of rating 'to style', I have to dock some points here (too thick/sweet/chocolatey for the CDA style), but this is well worth seeking out, style be damned. Picture a thicker, more chocolatey Smuttynose Imperial Stout. I'm tempted to cellar a few bottles of this to enjoy down the road."
"O: after having the abita black ipa at the event i think this one fell a little short to that one. it's not bad by any means. the people serving didn't really know all that much about it. it hid the alcohol well, but it's just not memorable."
"This beer pours a dark chocolate color with a finger of tan head that leaves no lacing as you drink. The aroma is strong with chocolate roasted malt. The taste starts with chocolate malt and then moves to some slight bitterness... But there is no hop flavor to speak of, which is what i would have expected from how the beer was described on the bottle. The mouthfeel is ok with slight overcarbonation. Overall I would give this a try if you are more of a porter fan."
"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a moderate light tan head. Hoppy nose. I'm not really an IPA guy, but this doesn't really taste like an IPA. It's almost like a hoppy Imperial Stout. Distinct roasted malts, maybe some chocolate or cocoa. Hops are robust but not overwhelming, and are tempered by the malts. Enjoyed it a lot. I'll buy it again."
"D- Not too heavy, but with the alcohol level it would not be a session beer."
"Drinkability is solid. The bomber will be a breeze; this goes down easy."
"No problem drinking this one. The best from RJ's I've had yet."
"In all, this was a great introduction to SC beers. I hope to try more."
"Drinkability: slower sipping big IPA. Loads of flavor but one glass on draft was just not enough for me. Nice beer."
"22 oz wax dipped bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Oily, resiny, clear lacing sticks to the glass. Off-white, almost beige head rests on an almost black body. Aroma seems to be dominated by phenol alcohol, definitely some hops in the glass but it's overwhelmed by the alcohol and maybe a touch of roasted malt. Taste is certainly bitter as expected, with a bit of expected heat following the aroma. Almost difficult to define the type or style of the hops used in the taste or aroma. Dare I say that this beer could benefit from some age? Overall, gets much better upon warming but a bit too hot."
"Taste speaks to me more in the language of a hoppy stout than a dark IPA, but even the definition of that is debatable right now. Certainly not Cascadian, as the hops on this are more earthy and blunted than its Pac-NW brethren. I like the light sweetness and the heavy roast, so this beer is quite tasty for my palate and does not disappoint in the least. Reminds me of a much smoother, less robust Storm King. 9.5% - really? Hides it well. The IPA comes out more as it warms...more in the form of bitterness than flavoring though. Very enjoyable beer, and I liked it much better than Rockhopper (only other RJRBC beer I have tried)."
"Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a one-finger, tan head of foam. It was short-lived and left minimal lacing. It smelled of chocolate, cocoa and toffee. A slight floral aroma. Would have thought of a more hoppy smell should have come from a IBA. It had mild bitterness. It was smooth. A medium to heavy bodied ale with a dry finish. This is a good IBA. But, not the best I've ever had."
"M - Medium bodied."
"I was not overly impressed with this one. Especially the mouthfeel. It felt too thin."
"D: I'm not a big fan of the whole Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale/ American Dark Ale thing, but this is pretty good. With a subtle strength that nudges toward 10% , you must respect this despite its sneaky subtleties. Worth a try...nah, strongly recommended! Thank, Ian, for introducing me to a pretty damn good CDA/BIPA/ADA/whatever... I'd have it again!"
"Just missing that all important ingredient hops."
"D - Easy drinking and pretty good. I think the brewer misclassified this one. I'd say it fits firmly in porter category. If I rated this as a Black IPA it would be rated lower but I'm only going to ding it one point in drinkability."
"Not the best ABA I've had. I'd like to put some age on it just to see what happens with the sourness. Experiments are fun!"
"D: I liked this beer but have no idea what to compare it to. I guess what I like is how different it is, yet it well balanced. But there's multiple layers of taste and flavor and in a weird way they all work together. Oh, and I drinking a year old bottle. Cool brew, must have again."
"Taste starts with almost acrid dark grain flavor, which tries to hand the baton in the middle to the piny bitterness, but the burnt character never leaves. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but it and drinkability are limited by the over-assertive darkness in this brew."
"""New style"" debate aside, this is an amazing beer--heavy on malt and hops with a whole lot of balance for the taste buds to be pleased with."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, finishes slightly tannic. Tasty, but could be more bold."
"22oz waxed bottle into a Hopus tulip pours a deep not quite opaque black that shows some brown highlights when held to light. The beer is topped by a thin slowly diminishing head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of dark malts and subtle but present citrus hops. The taste is a very nice blend of dark malts, cocoa, and nice lingering bitter citrus hops. The beer is medium bodied with fairly well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable strong Black IPA, one I would love to see available in the Raleigh area."
"Drinkability: I am rating a fresh bottle of the recently released bottling - looking over the reviews, I have the sense that the current bottling has dealt with the carbonation and hopping issues associated with the previous version(s); still, I would agree with those who maintain that this is more of a hoppy porter than a Black IPA; in any event, I really like this beer and think that in its current version it is truly an unappreciated gem"
"D: A slightly uneven beer, but drinkable enough."
"D - Good for Bomber but not multiples."
"id have to go with the notion that it really falls more along the lines of a hoppy porter. the ipa aspect just doesnt come to fruition, particularly because the malt and chocolate come through more than the hops. this is a tasty beer, i just feel its mislabeled. its very drinkable, and i love sipping on it. the carbonation is perfect and id love more, just not at the $11 price tag. worth seeking out at least once."
"Nice mouthfeel and a decent drinking beer."
"22oz bottle with blue wax on the cap. Pours a black color with some dark brown hues to it. Good amount of head. Minimal lacing. Interesting aroma. Roasted malts and pine hops. A slight bit of citrus. Taste is mostly piney hops but with a nice amount of roasted malts and chocolate flavors to it. Aftertaste has some citrus, but not a lot. I haven't had too many Black IPAs yet but I am really digging this one. Nice mix of flavors to it. Worth seeking out this beer for certain."
"The bottle looked really cool with the sunken treasure/pirate feel and suckered me in, fortunately the beer inside was quite tasty. This was the first beer I've had from RJ Rockers (I had never heard of them before either). Although they label it as a ""dark india pale ale", it is more in line with a hoppy porter."
"Drinkability for me, is limited to one. Usually I can drink IPAs all night. I can even drink Stone SSRA all night, but this is heavy to drink like a porter."
"2010 Vintage. Served from tap at the brewery release party into an RJ Rockers shaker. Poured a massively dark brown almost black with a one and a half finger light tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, and subtle bitter hops. The flavor was of roasted malt, subtle bitter hop that intensified upon swallowing, and very slight chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nicely balanced Black IPA. With this one being as fresh as possible the hop character is in full bloom right now. The aroma on this one was quite nice and had a good flavor to follow it up. This one is a must try if you are a fan of the style."
"More like a hoppy porter, as many have noted, but quite enjoyable."
"I'm pretty indifferent on this one, if that says anything."
"The ""Black IPA"" style is an exciting one, if so new that it's hard to define just yet. But I like the idea, and I like that a fairly under-hyped, even unremarkable brewery like RJ Rockers are at least delving into such wide-open territory. They've failed to truly put their mark on the style, but it's a decent stab worth trying once. Unfortunately for them and every other brewer, Southern Tier threw their hat in the Black IPA ring with Iniquity, which will be incredibly difficult for anyone to match. Let the games begin..."
"Dark to the point of opaque; kind of muddy appearance with no head. Aroma and taste are almost cloyingly sweet. Somewhat disappointing because I know the owners of RJR and wish them well. Redeeming qualities are that is goes down very smooth for such a high abv; no real alcohol bite. Nice earthy, smoky notes. In fact, if the sweetness were a bit less pronounced, this is a complex and flavorful brew."
"D - This is a pretty good black double IPA. Again, it really tastes like a very hoppy porter."
"Tried this on a whim. I really like the brown ale that RJ Rocker has to offer so decided to try this. I'm trying to branch out with IPAs. I've just developed a taste for a significant hoppiness in beers so decided this may be a good starter, being maybe a combination of a stout appearance and IPA taste. The verdict: it's pretty good but nothing exceptional. Pretty hoppy, thin in mouthfeel. Not sure what's supposed to be special this beer except....it's really dark in color and it's hoppy:? Am I missing something?"
"Overall it was a decent offering I think it needed a little more though to push it over the edge. I have had much worse though it just seemed like it was a tad too big for itself."
"D - So...I'm liking this beer quite a bit, but I'm not sure I agree with the style here. Blind tasting, I'd call this a weak Impy Stout. As an IPA it falls short in hop character...kinda defies definition. Blend half IPA and half Impy Stout and blend together well and this is what you get. More of a hoppy, thin Impy Stout than anything...in that regard it is a pretty easy drinker. More than anything, I'd say disregard the style, drink it for pure enjoyment, and don't worry about the rating. Good beer...enjoyable...I'd have another anytime."
"Drinkability: Fairly enjoyable, well-rounded brew. Not nearly as notably hoppy or bitter as some of these so-called Black IPA's (or in this case Walnut Brown IPA) on the market today, which is fine with me. It's good to see RJ Rockers rolling out some new brews now that they've settled down in their new facility."
"T/M- very heavy handed but well blended malt profile that def.overpopulkates any hops. Nice mouthfeel and is a good session beer."
"Thanks Ding!"
"Drinkability: I'm not quite sure how to approach this beer. If judged purely by style I would say it failed. If judged purely by taste I would say it did well. A very interesting beer to be sure. I will end by saying this: an IPA this is not. As a hop head I am a little disappointed. However, no matter what style this beer claims to be, it does taste good and in the end that is all that really matters. Though I may not give this beer top marks for style, it tastes good and I would certainly have it again."
"This is at least the third different example I can think of involving an in-state brewer producing a tasty beer that doesn't really fit the style guidelines. But, then again, I'd rather have a really tasty porter/sweet stout than a by-the-book, but not very good black IPA."
"D - Solid dark IPA and a cool bottle to boot. This was my first experience with this brewery, and I'm intrigued. While the mouthfeel was slightly thin, I thought this was a good IPA overall, although I didn't get DIPA from this brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slick with a refreshing bite of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed drinking this one. It really tastes like someone blended an IPA with a stout, and that's not a bad thing. The two flavor profiles balance each other out pretty nicely. It definitely has more stout characteristics then the other black IPA's I have had, with a little more of the chocolate and coffee flavors."
"bomber from Charleston Beer Exchange"
"drinkability: good"
"Pours darker than expected, compares to a dark brown ale, very slight head that isn't retained long. Smell is good but nothing that I'd close my eyes and really take in during each sip. Taste has a full malt and just hints on chocolate note before hops take over and pull the IPA style back to the fore. Mouthfeel is good but again, nothing i'm going to savor sip-to-sip. Drinkablity is down a bit at 9.5% but it's still a good brew if you're looking for something other than your typical IPA."
"Brew pours a dark soda color with a somewhat minimal head, sort of light tan, but just enough to lace the head of the beer. It's hardly as much as any IPA, black or not. Aroma is nice and solid, dark maltiness, some cocoa like a stout. Taste has chocolate an coffee notes. There is a bit of bitterness at the end, but not enough for the style. Most I BIPAs are more bitter than this, I have found. Not a bad brew, I like stretching the boundaries, but for this style, this brew is a bit behind the curve."
"J"
"Nice. Not shortage of hops or roast at all here, as this came off to me as one of the better Black IPAs that I've had recently. The higher ABV got to me after a while but it in no way stood in front of those bold flavors. It's nice to see RJ Rockers raising the bar on their offerings here."
"Very drinkable for a dark beer. The only thing slowing you down is the ABV"
"Drinks fairly easy for the style & abv. A good stab at a black IPA, hops weren't perfect, but were still well done in this one. A touch pricey @ $8 a bomber, but unique enough that I shall buy it again. Exceeded by expectations & then some!"
"Thanks to Rockers for giving me a Hoppy New Year!"
"D- Dangerously drinkable. Delicious. And the alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden!"
"D= very drinkable if you enjoy this style."
"Somewhat muddy looking and dark in color. Not much carbonation visible but some sticky lacing left behind. Ho hum aroma-quite hoppy but lacking any real ""bright"" floral or citrusy hop notes. Decent enough flavor-a mellow roasted grain flavor with a heavy handed hop presence but like the aroma stays somewhat 1 dimensional to me. Full mouthfeel-finish is somewhat dry. I was really looking forward to this and somewhat dissapointed. Doesnt scream hops enough like I thought it would. Maybe thats harder to pull off in a dark beer."
"Very drinkable. Dark IPA/DIPA's are a style that I really like. They have the best of both worlds and are pretty unique at this point. I really think this is a well crafted beer and worthy of a try for most anyone. Glad I had the chance to sample this one."
"Drinkability is good more like a hopped up porter then black ipa, while it is good brew not something i would repeat buy, at this price anyway."
"This review was written while drinking it for the first time."
"I love this beer. Brew it again. Can't wait for the next installment of the Ales from the Dark Side (make it a Belgian . . . .)."
"Good? Yeah, I guess so. This is not a bad beer, but its not one I will spend a lot a lot of time with."
"D-Not bad as it has the looks and smell of a hopped up west coast ale (which I enjoy) but is a bit more mellow without slacking on the flavor and subtlety. A pleasant drink."
"I can see sediment though the bottle, even before I pour, it seems to be really loose, but I'm not too afraid of it. Pours nice and dark, though I almost expected it to be blacker. The head is kind of thin, not exiting, looks like an average kind of brown ale. The smell immediately makes me think something is burnt, not quite like ashes, but burnt. Then comes this overpowering caramellized sugar smell. The hops are not too present, some slightly herbal and leafy smells, but it seems kind of normal for a ""black ipa"". The taste is actually quite an improvement. There's a great roasty flavor layered with a nice hop bitterness. Those two flavors create a pleasant bitterness, balanced with a nice malty, caramelly sweetness. The hop flavor comes through with some astringent lemon peel and grapefruit rind, and finish a bit piney and fruity, like an underripe mango. Still the dark malts are present throughout. The only off flavor I notice is a slightly yeasty flavor, maybe some hot yeast flavors, kind of pasty, but not too noticable. The body is pretty nice, though a little more thin than I expected. Can't really compain, but nothing to be exited about. The drinkability is rather good - I enjoyed the beer quite a bit, but eventually started to fade into the background. I don't know if that makes it more or less drinkable, but overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"Had the chance to try this at a recent tasting in Columbia, thanks to RJ Rockers for sending us such a nice gift. I can't remember ever trying a Black IPA. My initial thoughts were that it smelled and looked like a hopped up porter. The taste of the malty sweetness, coffee, and hops really seemed to work well together. Very unique, I would definitely recommend trying it and look forward to the Dark Side series coming to Columbia."
"My first Rockers review in a while after trying this on tap at The Tap Room beside the brewery. Poured into a pint glass, this one was an almost-black brown color and had a 1/2 inch tan head. The smell is a roasted-coffe-hoppy trio and quite nice. I was really surprised that this beer wasn't over-the-top hoppy in terms of taste. The sweetness of the malt really balances out this beer making it a fairly easy drinking beer. It is quite filling and I wasn't able to drink more than a pint of this, but it was a very tasty beer and I hope they brew it again next year!"
"Served in a 22 oz bottle with blue wax sealing. A really cool looking bottle. Pours a thick, dark color with big, sticky tan/off-white head. Smells of malt, mild hops, and alcohol. With this being an imperial IPA I expected a stronger hop aroma. This is a full flavored beer with the sweetness of the malt dominating on the front end while the finish is predominatly a roasted, hoppy combo. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, it leaves a layer inside your mouth. Drinkability is the best thing about this beer. For such a big beer, it is an easy drink and one you have to be carful with. Outstanding!"
