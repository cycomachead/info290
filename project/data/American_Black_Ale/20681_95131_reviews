review_text
"From bottle dated 1/27/15. Second tasting of a MBC beer. This is a black IPA and the bottle should state it that way, it was described to me as such before purchase. Dark pour with a thicker viscosity, 2 finger tab foam, laced and held the glass throughout. Very nice caramelly, smoky hop smell. A piney hop flavor hits the mouth up front and the rich malt settles in the back followed by a little bitter bite. A few seconds later the rich, woody malt flavor lingers. Overall a very good, not great, offering for a dark IPA, would purchase again without a doubt but want to try the other Maine beers first."

"On draft.  Similar to other black ipas.  Hoppy and bitter.  Didn't care for it. Very dry.  Not a lot of complex flavors.  Just sort of there."
""
""
""
"Ok now I've read others reviews - nobody else got oak, closest was smoky, maybe thats a better description."
""
""
""
""
"My second offering from MBC.  Looks pretty.   Nice frothy head that sticks around for a while.  Dark and roasty with a nice hop bite.  Paired with a couple Leadbelly tracks.  Solid beer from a solid brewery!"
""
"Caught a whiff of yeast in the beginning.  Pours dark with a moderate head.  Tastes ok.  I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Not good taste, too dark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty. Great for a dark ale. Some interesting hop aromas going on. Clean finish, but loses a bit of flavor at the end. Solid beer but not MBC's best."
""
""
""
""
"My instant impression was that of a brown ale and not having a clue to this beer's makeup when I cracked the top, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw its rich dark composition.  When first gazing upon its black body and creamy frothy head I thought ""how nice, a black ale"" which wasn't to far off. It goes down like combination of a hazelnut brown ale and a traditional black ale so it gives you the best of both worlds.  It's yet another example of how MBC has staked its claim as one of New England's best brewers."

"O - Great black ale.  I could see this working really well as a black IPA if it was a bit hoppier."
""
""
""
""
""
"Man, one of the best black ipa's I have ever had.  This beer is so on-point.  It really is every thing a black ipa should be.  A perfect balance of hops and roasted malts.  I'm really happy to have found this on my recent trip to the east coast.  Keep up the great work, MBC!"
""
""
"Overall, not a bad attempt at a very difficult genre. The black ipa is all about balance, where as with this beer it's almost split: Dark in the beginning, ipa in the end. Not bad, but wouldn't buy again."
""
"O- nice black IPA."

"Three full fingers worth medium brown colored head that is both crisp and airy while being comprised of lots of big chunky bubbles and a rocky top...  Rock solid retention...  The color walks a fine line between dark brown and flat black...   Largely still with just a stray carbonation bubble or two seen towards the top of the glass...  The nice is quite whimsical...  Equal parts piney and juicy hop resins...  There are some faint roasted malt tones beneath the surface...  Just the slightest whiff of vanilla as well...  The nose was a good indication of what to expect on the palate...  There is no vanilla sweetness, but everything else is spot on...  The roasted malts and hops ebb and flow while competing for prominence...  The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium bodied...  A slightly surprising bite of prickly carbonation...  A touch of dryness throughout before finishing with a bit of a chalky presence...  Loaded with character...  Maine Brewing turns out another winner with Weez...  A very well rounded American Black Ale iwth lots of depth and complexity...  A terrific brew all the way around..."

""

"Nice and roasty, mild grassy and pine hop character. Aroma is a little weak, but an excellent black ipa. I don't think Maine Brewing can do no wrong"
""
""
""
"First off just left Maine Brewery this beer was bottle 7 days ago. I did not get to try it on draft but purchased a bottle.  It smells deliciously hoppy.  Balanced with dark malt its the best black IPA I have had could be my favorite brew from this brewery"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I took a chance on these bottles even though most are over 8 months old and they were not bad. I think I liked the King titus porter more but this is on great Black IPA. Worth picking up!"
""
""
"A uniqur mash-up of an IPA, Cascadian Dark and a Stout. Enjoyable on its own."
""
"Overall: A nice Black IPA with well integrated roasted malts and fresh hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious smoky, roasty BIPA, smoother than expected."
""
""
"O:  this beer got even better after it warmed up slightly.  I'm an IPA and a stout guy and this is right up the middle.  Interesting hybrid!  Maine cannot make a bad beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Pour is dark brown , mostly opaque, with a tight creamy tan head.  Nose has a roasted malt up front, light smokiness, rich brown malt, and strong citrus hop behind.  Taste is even more smoky and roasted.  There is brown malt, notes of chocolate, bitter roast and the hops are light but have a presence in back.  Lighter body, nice carbonation."

"Awesome. Very roasty. Think oatmeal stout ipa. My nipples are hard...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: These are not all qualities I love in a brew, so points are flowing less than they might. But there is no denying that this is an interesting, bold (huge), and distinctive offering from Maine."

"Overall:  Nice black ale.  I like it more off draft than in a bottle.   I may have poured a little bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle even though I poured it carefully."

"Overall very tasty, it was a nice complex beer that bounced between hoppy sweetness and roasted grainy smoked flavors, settling on a mild bitterness together. Quite flavorful and enjoyable, I'd definitely have this again and it’s another winner from Maine Beer Co."

"Huge, frothy head, easy three fingers, very dark brown with an unusual amount of larger bubbles present, lots of craters across the surface, excellent retention, the lacing likewise thick and chunky and not easily washed away. The liquid is a pure black, while opaque in no way cloudy, can’t discern any visible bubbles. Early appearance in the nose of white grapefruit and orange citrus, this succumbs to cocoa, coffee roast notes, pleasingly strong floral component too, something medicinal, like witch hazel, the plum, cherry fruit scents a touch muted, never turns all that complex but what is there lingers powerfully. Medium-bodied, the creamy mouthfeel helps to delay the arrival of the roastiness and dark chocolate, moments of chicory like bitterness. In the end the citrus adds more sweetness than tartness, still not getting much more than a vestige of mixed black fruits. Carbonation assists in breaking up its inclinations towards heaviness. Pine resin, tar and campfire smoke contribute to the inner mouth perfume through the finish. Thankfully not over roasted so ends up with a clean ending rather than too astringent or bitter."

"o - Overall a good Black IPA...not one of the best I've had, and not MBC's best, but quite good. Taste is good and balanced, worth checking out."

"Poured from bottle into tulip. Color is a deep dark brown, with a thick tan head. Consistent lacing throughout. Plenty of carbonation. Smell is shocking...hops, citrus, with almost no roasted malt notes. Taste brings in the roasted flavors, lightly, in balance with the hops. Just a really balanced beer and amazing integration. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall, I'm excited to see more dark hoppy offerings from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a potent hoppy bitterness which supersedes the initial dark malt and black licorice character. You go away from this thinking ""I loved those hops."""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful dark color with a creamy tan head. Picked up a little booze in the aroma but its mostly roasted coffee here. The taste is a nice balance of hop and coffee bitterness, with some roasty malts tying it all together. This brewery is doing everything right, haven't been disappointed in anything."

"O - Porter meets IPA. Less IPA, but the flavors are there. Balanced, no one thing shines and nor really excels. Interesting mix of favors and we'll executed."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a shaker pint glass. Dark chocolate brown to black brew with a very large, rich tan head. Aroma of melon and tropical fruit (mango? faint lychee?), grapefruit, molasses, dry chocolate wafers, and a little pine needle. Nice freshness and complexity on the nose, hop forward yet mildly roasted. The palate largely follows suit, although there is more dry roast coffee and cacao powder that threatens to engulf the pine needle, orange and grapefruit rind, Earl Gray tea, canned peach, and lime juice hops flavors ... Perhaps I spoke too soon, the hops are beginning to shine through as I type this. A pleasant lemon pepper spice is revealing itself late along with a touch of garlic. Mouthfeel is a selling point, quite thick and chewy for the style and with a moderate degree of carbonation. Finishes quite bitter, with more citrus and steak spice plus a little ash. Perhaps the weakest of the four Maine Beers I've sampled to date but still pretty freaking good. The cause described on the bottle is even better (as my rescue cat nods her assent)."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another amazing beer from an amazing brewery. One of my all time favorite breweries ever. Just simply amazing."
""
""
"To be perfectly honest I picked this beer up partially because Maine Beer Company has great reputation right now, and partially because of the dedication to stray kitties. But I'll get it again (if I can find it) because it's damn fantastic beer."

"Poured a black body with decent head and lace patches along glass. Aroma is a combo of light, roasted malts and some bitter citric hops. Medium to heavy bodied with those bitter citric hops coming out but only in the background. A pronounced roasted malt base is the dominant taste profile of this beer and there is a touch of sweetness. Not my favorite style so maybe that's why I didn't rate so high but an enjoyable beer."

"Wonderful dark colored black ipa with a thick mocha head that retreats quickly. Gently lacing along the sides of the glass. Hop aroma is present as well as roasted coffee. Minute chocolate taste with some hop bitterness and stronger coffee flavor. Medium body though pretty creamy and some char at the finish. Overall I must say this is a pretty amazing beer. Really enjoyed this one and can't wait to get my hands on another bottle!"
""
"overall this thing drinks like a stout, it's not as hop forward as I expected, actually a lot of porter-esque chocolate notes. aromas have hints of grassy hop and roasted malt. but overall its a perfectly balanced beer and looks damn good in a tall pint glass"
""
""
"Overall - A black IPA with a well-rounded roasted malt flavour and supporting citrus hop backbone. A respectable brew to raise funds for local animal shelters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Since I like Maine a lot, this was a disappointment for me. Maybe I'll try again in the future if I grab a fresh bottle, but this was not my favorite in this style and certainly not my favorite from MBC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could drink a few of these with no problems its hands down a great version of the style. So far Maine's gone 2 for 2 in my books and I still have a pair in the fridge I can't wait to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My new favorite black IPA. This is still very much an IPA, with a perfect medium light amount of roasted malt."
""
""
""
""
"O - one of the best American Black Ales/Black IPA's I've had to date. Not sure I can justify another $6.99 on another bottle, but this was well worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a phenomenal beer. Is there a style these guys can't nail?"
""
""
"O: a great black ipa that's worth seeking out. The price is a bit steep but a good beer."
""
"For a style that I am mostly not even middling about, this is the exception that seems to shatter my rule - roasty, toasty malt, and the typically heady citrus, pine, and floral hops of the perfect IPA. Ok, I've seen this before, but never in such a pleasantly rounded and integrated manner - it's like I know what I'm tasting, but suddenly I'm just freakin' fine with it. Huh. Anyways, this one makes an impression, in a very good way."
""

"Black and opaque with a light brown frothy and foamy head that lingers long with lumpy moguls on top. Low aroma of dark malt and hops. Rich flavor of roasty malt with accompanying bitterness contribution, a bit ashy, hops accompany well and do not overpower, good balance. Big fat legs and rings of lace line the glass. Rich and full and round mouthfeel. Roasty hop bitterness lingers. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really strong. Great persistent head, and thick persistent lacing. Nose is Earthy and malty with nuts and dark chocolate. Bitter nutty character. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is very solid beer to pound down for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
"O- One of the best Black IPAs of all time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the fuller end of medium body with slight viscosity and soft carbonation. Very dry and bitter up front with the earthy hops and charred malt flavors playing off of each other. Strong sticky, resinous hop flavor up front with grass, pine and spruce tip but it's missing the subtle citrus presence found in the nose. The hops are countered by a deeply roasted dark malt backbone that is somewhat acrid and nearly burnt tasting. The smoke presence is a bit stronger than in the aroma with hints of ash, charcoal and burnt toast along with used coffee grinds, oatmeal and dark chocolate. This beer has a decent balance of hops and malt but tastes very one dimensional with a ton of tongue scraping, dry bitterness and overwhelming roast. Needs a lot more sweetness to balance things out. Overall, this isn't a terrible beer but it's boring, a bit harsh and tough to drink."
""
"O- I love this style when it is executed correctly and this one does a great job. I am interested to see what type of hops and malt are used in this because some of the flavors expand further than even the best black IPAs I have had. Really awesome offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now, on to try ""Another One""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium to heavy body and mild to moderate carbonation leaves this smooth and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful stuff again from these guys. While I enjoyed its normalized variant (Another One) slightly more, this is by far the most herbal and roasted black IPA I've had to date. Takes the style to another level that I hadn't even thought about before. This paired incredibly well with oregano soaked goat cheese and bread. A nice dessert to have after a meal, too. Definitely worth picking up for fans of IPAs and porters."
""
""
"Taste is roasty and moderately bitter, piney hops linger into the dry aftertaste. Creamy and fairly substantial in body. Char lingers momentarily in the middle, fading into bitter resinous hops. Overall it's good for what it is, but for the price I'll keep drinking Wookey Jack."
""
""
"I believe that Another One and Weez are the same hop bill but AO is a traditional IPA and Weez is a black IPA. Interesting that AO shows off lemony citrus hop characteristics and Weez displays lemony menthol hops."
"Poured from the simple but very informative bottle into a pint glass, Weez is very dark you can see a slight dark brown hue when held to the light but otherwise black. There is a thin, creamy mocha colored head that hangs around all day. The nose is a nice mixture of aromatic hops and dark malty notes. The taste prevails in the hop direction initially with a sweet piney, resinous hop flavor and then shifts back to a bready, burnt chocolate, semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected and goes down easy, mild but adequate carbonation helps too. Overall, a great beer and a great representative for the state of Maine!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this brew was its aroma. The hops are much more prominent here from the get go, but the flavoring does catch up more and more as it warms, with oily resins working their way in between the dense layers of chocolate, malts, and char. This beer does just the right amount of blending, with that unique black ale oily sweetness of hops that marries so, so well with the darkness of the grain bill. The product works to somehow lighten and denude the malts a bit, and is a quality that we’ve appreciated in the best beers of the style. This beer has been a long time coming, and again, and with a new style to their lineup nonetheless, continued to impress us with their versatility and general prowess."

""

"O: Maine brewing is moving up my favorites list very quickly this black ipa was really tasty and would definitely have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yet another well made beer by the folks up at Maine Beer Co., Weez. Like I said above, I'm not a normally a black IPA guy but this one fits the bill nicely with a complex malt profile and bright hoppiness. I'd give Weez another go if it was available in my area. Thanks, Ryan!"
"It seems like more and more good hoppy black ales are popping up or I am appreciating the style more. Good flavor seems to switch back and forth between rich roast and resinous hops."
""
"It's good and I like it but it could be better."
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent brew from Maine Beer Co. Definitely recommend and would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-nice black ale, good flavors and feel, solid ale"
""
""
"Overall not bad for a black IPA, nice malts, the hops get a little in the way of it, and the malts get in the way of the hops, so overall again I think this is a completely flawed style, and this shows why. Two different beers, same hops, different malts, the wheat and light malt beer in the Another One was awesome and the hops brought resin, tropical fruit, juicy generic fruit, floral aroma, very nice hop character. The dark malts drown out the nice part of the hops, and contrast what comes through from the nice hops, and brings out the less interesting parts of the hops, just not nearly as tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black with a medium creamy beige head and good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, resinous, tropical fruits and caramel. Taste is slightly sweet with roasted malt, pine, tropical fruits, caramel and a light bitter finish. Medium body. Slightly dry. Average carbonation. Good Black IPA. A tad watery on the finish, but well balanced and drinkable aplenty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: real good beer - can't see any fan of ABAs not liking it, and I think it has a very approachable character for any drinker. On par, in my estimation, with most of the popular beers in the ABA style."
""
"This beer reminds me of the original trial batch of Zoe years ago before it became an amber ale."
""
"this and Another One are the same hops with different grains. i found the hops being far more dominant in Another One. this is like a hoppy stout, and in a great way."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Good example of the style, just not my cup of tea."
""
""
""

"MF – Medium light bodied, dry finish, but not necessarily a lasting bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended by my local beer shop, I gave it a try. Did not know what I was trying as the label said ""ale."" It is a black ale with a good dose of hops. I tried it, but, not my type of beer."
"Hops are still present. Maine Beer Co loves to showcase their hops."
""
""
"16.9oz bottle that was bottled on 080613. Pours a pitch black color with 2+ inches of frothy, light brown head. Tons of lacing. Aromas of sweet grapefruit, citrus hops, smoke and chocolate. The taste is more of the chocolate and smoke than the citrus hops, which is the exact opposite of the aroma. Earthy with lots of dark chocolate bitterness. Some grapefruit sprinkled in here and there. Dark roast black coffee and espresso at the finish. Lots of malt flavor. Heavily carbonated. Most of the bitterness here doesn't come from the citrus hops but rather the dark chocolate and espresso. The smell made me believe this was going to be a lot hoppier than it was. Overall, pretty good Black IPA that I'd say tastes more like a Porter than the recent run of hoppy Black Ales."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. I love the strong hop aroma of a good DIPA with the mix of roasted chocolate malt. Well balanced and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad, but considering that this is quite a fresh bottle, the hops are surprisingly overpowered by the malt. As a companion beer, Another One is much better."
"O/D-Pretty neat. My interest and enjoyment of Black IPAs has waned but this one is a treat."
""
""
""
""
"Probably my least favorite of all the Maine Beer Co. offerings. Poured a 16.9 (8/6/2013) ounce into a chilled pint glass. That said it's still better then almost anything readily available at my local liquor store. I was tricked by the label claiming that it had the same hops as ""Another One", which is one of my personal favorites. The change to the malts, which result in the vastly darker coloring really change the taste and give it a much more subdued flavor that can almost (almost) be described as burnt. The change in malts also apparently results in the lack of delicious aroma that it's brother from another mother(Another One) boasts. Cheers."
""
"When this style is done well, it is very good. This is very good. Nice characteristics overall, and great rich flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good stab at a still developing style. It drinks very smoothly and strikes a nice balance between malt and hop."
"This is a very good black IPA, but it doesn't quite have the charm of Another One. The hop profile works better with lighter malts. This is still definitely worth a try, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty treat. It did nothing to convince me that Black IPAs are simply hoppy stouts, but its well worth having."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I expected some really great things after enjoying the dickens out of Another One. This just didn't impress me anywhere near as much. Also not as enjoyable as Collaboration Time."
"O - I'm not a huge fan of the Black Ale style and had some reservations buying this, but glad I did. One of the best black ales I've had. Hops have really good fresh citrus notes that lighten the character overall for this beer. Going down pretty easily with dinner."
"D: This was an excellent black IPA. It looked like a top stout, smelled like a top IPA, and tasted like a perfect mix of top stout and top IPA. The body was fantastic, and the finish was smooth, so it was really easy to drink. I find no fault in this brew. One of the best in class, and definitely recommended. Well done, Maine."
""
""
""
""
"D: a pretty solid black IPA from Maine. great hop nose while still remaining to show a solid malt presence, especially with the roast. very enjoyable. a little surprised not as many people agree with me."

"$7 for 500 ml bottle"
"This is a very tasty beer with a nice mouth feel. The aroma doesn't fade like other beers and the flavors are nicely balanced. Well done."
""
"O: Nice black IPA. Nothing over the top amazing but just a nice hoppy black ale. Not a hop bomb, more of a balanced brew. Great juicy grapefruit. Tasty."
""
""
"Hoppy dark ales have never been a true favorite style of mine - while this was still tasty I don't see dropping $8+ on another bottle anytime soon."

"M: Medium bodied. Drinks like a nice IPA, great."
"Overall: I was expecting a normal IPA ... imagine my surprise when it poured black. Regardless, the best black IPA I've had to date ... a beautiful malt character like those found in other black IPA's, but with some sweet juicy fruit mixed in. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"O: reminded me of a hopped up porter"
"Very dry with a strong burnt malt flavor. The finish is bitter from the hop and the overly roasted barley. Thinnish body, above average carbonation--so the flavor is the dominate feature of this brew. Think bitter stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I very much enjoyed this beer. Perfect melding of dark roasty flavors with vibrant citrus hops. I definitely prefer this to it's lighter, same hopped counterpart (Another One). If you enjoy the ABA style, I recommend grabbing one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid black ale overall. I liked the concept MBC did with Another One and this beer. Interesting take on recipes for sure, but I'm still not the biggest fan of the black ale style. Mostly become to dry for my liking. This one straddles that line ever so slightly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Closer to a black IPA - nicely balanced and really well done."
"Suffers from MBC syndrome. It's delicious and worth drinking, but the price point makes it a one or two and done. A solid black ale, and worth seeking out at least once, but at $8 or more/bottle, it's hard to swallow."
""
""
"O: Good stuff. A thicker body and more chocolate malt-type flavors to balance the roastiness and this would be a world class American Black Ale. As it is it's quite good, however."
""
""
"O - I would have liked this a little more carbonated with a little less malt, but it is a great beer nonetheless! I definitely wouldn't pass this up if offered and highly recommend trying it if you can pick it up. Another winner by MBC!"
"I definitely preferred Another One to Weez, but I'll be damned if this wasn't still a darn tasty Black IPA. It's a strange style; at what point does the beer go from being a Black IPA to just a really hopped up porter? Especially with age, I would think this would just be a deliciously-hopped porter. This was consumed with less than a month on it, though, so the hops were certainly bursting. Good beer, can't wait to try more stuff from Maine."

"O - The best black ipa I've ever had. Looks and mouthfeel are perfect."

"A GREAT American Black Ale and one that I wish I could find outside of ME. I hope this beer gets brewed in greater quantities because I LOVE this ABA."
"Poured from a bottle into a true pint, the beer is a dark, muddled, ruby-brown coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, light brown head. Aromas of floral and resiny hops characteristics, with a piney highlight, as well as heavy roast and subtle char profiles. Very balanced smell, with a dark, richly sweet ribbon tucked away in there as well. Flavors are hop forward, bitter and resiny, with a blast of citrus tart and sweet, also. Roasty and tangy sweet backbone. Hints of smoke throughout. The body is light and smooth, doing a good job supporting the robust flavors. Decent lacing left on the glass. The aftertaste is bitter hops and grapefruit tartness, well balanced and blended. Slightly bitter, slick, lingering finish. Very tasty, and very drinkable."

"Overall - This is one hell of a solid brew from Maine Beer Company. 100% recommend. Hoppy and roasted mixed together gives a bitter brew with the stones of a Stout meets IPA feel than a Black IPA."

"The beer pours like black mocha coffee with a beautiful head of medium sized, khaki colored, medium sized bubbles that sit above two finger widths in the glass and take their time in calming down. The head leaves a lacing of fat, thick bubbles that fluff out into the glass. In body the beer is impenetrable the eye. On the nose the beer smells gorgeously fruity with citric tangerine and nectarine with a touch of pine. In the roast, the beer is light with caramel and a faint touch of roasted chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes of citric bitter with a light sweet roast that draws a little bitterness from it and builds in the mouth. The beer also has a light acidic pop, presumably from the hops, which leaves the mouth with a wet scrim of saliva. This beer begins as sweet, however, and slowly works towards a more bitter palate, which is wonderfully encouraging of future sips. In flavor, the beer begins as fruity hops, with sweet orange and grapefruit citrus touching the tongue before a healthy roast of coffee and light char moves in and overrides those flavors. Chocolate and light metallic flavors also tingle on the tongue with the roast. The finish returns to fresh citric juice with a touch of roasted malts, and the aftertaste is of lightly roasted malts with a soft touch of metallic flavoring. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a little bit of weight. The carbonation is creamy and smooth, providing just a kiss of fierceness making the beer wonderfully clean and crisp on the mouth. The mouth is left with a nice bit of saliva to cancel out the acids, and a slight bitter bite on the tongue. Overall, this is a beautifully complex beer. It sits somewhere between a hoppy porter and an India Black Ale, with a beautiful nose of citric hops and tastes nicely roasty with a good juicy bite from the hops. Color me impressed by this beer. It is sweet on the front and bitter on the end. I wouldn’t call it a “Black IPA” by any stretch of the imagination, and I will continue arguing for some differentiation between India Dark Ales and their roastier cousins (Weez sides more on the roasty cousin side). This beer is great though, and is another success from the MBC. Try this beer."

"O: Definitely a well constructed black IPA which can be a hit or miss style with me - I like how the nose makes the beer seem like it will be extremely hoppy but the flavor is much more roasty. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is relatively easy to drink. Enjoyable and definitely one to grab."
"Pours a solid black color with a huge tan head that persists forever. Earthy hoppy aroma with a roasty chocolate some dark fruit and a hint of cardboard. The flavor is earthy and citrus hoppy with a fair amount of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick roasty gritty mouthfeel. Nice hoppy porter very tasty."

"A damn fine Black IPA. Cascade, Simcoe, and Citra bringing the heat on this beer."

"O - black ipas are not always my thing but this is exceptionally well done. Good job maine brewing!"

"O: Definitely on the malty side with the big roasted malts. The hops take a back seat in this beer, but provide quite the bitterness. You can tell it has the same hops as Another One, but the roasted malts really dominate this beer. Both great beers, and it's nice to compare the two"
"The body is medium with expected amounts of carbonation. Overall this one is tasty! Glad to see a new one from these guys anytime!"
""
"Overall it's very different from most Cascadian Dark, Black IPAs, or whatever you want to call it, but it's a solid well made beer from a brewery I expect only good things to come from. With this beer they are still delivering."
""
"This is another tasty beer from Maine Beer Company. Well worth a try."
"Dark brown beer, with a huge fluffy brown head. Big aroma dominated by sour, citrusy hops. The taste is a really interesting mixture of dark, roasted malts and sour hops. In the end though, the roasted flavors win out and this is what lingers on the tongue more, with a background of hops. Overall, I really enjoyable beer."

"This is a good hoppy dark ale. I'm glad to see MBC succeed at something new, even if it is another hoppy beer. I'd definitely drink this one again."
