"Black in color but still somewhat penetrable to light.  An inch of tightly knit foam comprised of tiny bubbles is resting on top.  Heavy lacing is present.  Amazing aroma of citrus hops greets the nose.  There's undercurrent of dark malt.  The taste is of bitter piney hops on the front of the palate.  The back of the palate is dark malt.  It finishes with a bitter flourish of more piney hops.  The mouth is initially creamy and then very dry and lightly sticky.  There's a lot going on here.  Why is this being discontinued again?"
""
""
""
"Strong and malty with a hoppy aftertaste. A pretty heavy beer."
""
"Stone is a popular brewery, but I've yet to have a beer I can enjoy from them.  This one definitely taste different than any black IPA I've had.  too bitter for my taste.  the Speakeasy Butchertown Black IPA blows this one away.  get that instead if you can find it."
""
"Nice roasted taste, with a hoppy, dry finish"
""
""
""
"One last go around before this gets retired.  Can't believe they won't be making this anymore.  One of my favorites of all time. Perfect balance of roasted malt and big IBUs.  Tears in my eyes..."
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic beer. Very dark and strong. Coffee and dark chocolate are present. Alcohol has pletty of taste here. Almost like a Guinness on steroids. Two thumbs way up."
""
""
"Overall, although there is a nice, rare balance of citrus and roasted malts in the taste, not quite feeling this one as much as I had hoped. Had a Ruination last night, and preferred it quite a bit more. As previously stated, I think the complexity of flavors actually played against it. Still a very good beer, just a bit disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely an experience. I'll buy a 6pk of this and drink an occasional one here and there. Too rich to drink 2-3, but still exquisite enough to appreciate from time to time."

"-amazing beer one of my favorite beers i have drank to date, so complex with the flavors that pair so well together"

"Bomber poured into a plastic cup. Appearance is nearly opaque black topped with tan head that has legs but won’t stick to this cup. Aroma consists of citrus hops, pine resin, and roasted malt. Flavors are early citrus peel bitterness, roasty/cocoa malt sweetness in the middle, and a bitter lingering finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, crisp yet creamy, slight boozy aftertaste."
"Another clear-cut winner from Stone. Impressed by the old school malt emphasis here, considering these guys' rep for hop-forward brews. They got this base covered as well, of course."
""
""
"Very solid. If I wanted an IPA, this would be one I would come back to regularly. Stone has yet to disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"O: Haven't had this one in a while and I'm now wondering why it isn't a regular. Outstanding black IPA. I'm gonna miss this one when they retire it."
""
"O: I liked the hop flavors, but thought the toasted malt could have came through more. It was a little unbalanced on the hoppy side."
""
"Great black I P A"
"Its the Hoppiest of all the Black IPAs I've had and the Black Malt sweetness brings it all home to the most unique flavored Black IPA I've had. it might best too sweet for some Hopheads, but its so hoppy it just doesn't matter. This is what a Black IPA should be. The only Competition is has is something Lagunitas did and I can'remember what its called. Bring on the 5s!!!"

"Moderate hop aroma with a resiny, grapefruity character, malt nose is low to moderate – hints of chocolate and faint toast. Brilliant chestnut under a 2” light tan foam cap. Enters creamy with traces of coffee to chocolate but no burnt roast. Medium high bitterness – grapefruit rind mellowed by malts with some bitter support from darker malts. Medium body, slight astringency in the finish. Hop driven, lingering bitterness."
""
""
"Spicy with age! Nose almost like Tobasco, and a lot of burn on the back end (non-alcohol). Very fun, and would love to have this by a fireplace."
""
""
""
""
"This could be the perfect dark double IPA.  Just a few shortcomings, like the head is too thin and the body is a bit too thick and a little smokiness or wood flavors would be welcome additions.  Really good."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a rich black body with reddish brown highlights around the edges and one finger of tan head. A gorgeous looking black IPA, quite nice. Scents of pine resin, grassy hops, medium-high levels of roasted malt, light smokiness, light citrus and licorice aromas and light fruity esters and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice black IPA, rich and true to form, with a pleasant balance that leans towards hops, but lets enough roasted malt through. Quite nice. Flavor begins nicely bitter, with notes of roasted malt, smoked malt, pine resin, grassy hops, tangerine flesh and citrus peel. This moves into a bitter middle with notes of pine resin, citrus peel and a nice undercurrent of roasted and caramel malt. Finish is highly bitter with notes of pine resin, roasted malt, grapefruit peel and some sweet citrus flesh with a mild note of grassy hops and light alcohol. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, pine resin and grassy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice, very bold black IPA. It is very hop forward and bold but still quite nice, and with enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying, sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice black IPA, like many I have had. Overall this is a pretty good black IPA. It has a good aroma and flavor and a nice mouthfeel that aids the flavor profile. Not as good as the gold standard, Wookey Jack, but still quite nice and a shame it's being discontinued."

"22 oz. bottle from Fri., 01/02/2014 tasting (thanks, Erich and Sara!), unknown brewing/packaging dates, poured into a snifter glass, drank over ~30 minutes"
""
""
""
"It pours a beautiful black color with a light colored foamy head. It smells hoppy with a spicy finish. Taste is that of hops and burnt malt with a decent citrus undertone. Slightly boozy. Feel is of medium body and active carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable brew. Nothing amazing, just another solid Stone offering."

"beautifully balanced hop/malt...great to look at, phenomenal smell...flows well and is so very tasty...."
""
"Had this poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. Color was the same as every other black IPA you've ever tried. The mouthfeel was slightly less harsh than most though, one of the better qualities of the beer. The taste wasn't as much black or IPA as I'd hoped, more alcohol and less malt, hops, or smoke than you'd want. It was good, just a bit disappointing given all of heard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well crafted black IPA, one of the best of the style, in the same league as Dubhe/NightTime/Wookey Jack. Perfect for the hop head looking to transition into Porters... or the opposite way around."

"Decided to purchase wondering what the hell a black iPa is months back and trusting stones judgment.  Pre beer advocate.  First opened. Hmm smells like a porter /stout, but what's that end note!?!  I'm gonna go for a sip...... WOW!!  this is delicious!!  Starts off like a porter stout ends like an iPa. I can't explain it. I've actually looked at the low reviews on this one AND THEY EXIST! I know everyone's taste differs but I feel like this is one of the greatest beers ever. If I had enough to spend $12 on a couple 4 packs a week I would, but rather keep it special and get every so often. Hands down best 12oz bottled beer so far in my journey though craft beer. If you like IPAS and don't mind porters /stouts try this. Just make sure you get it fresh and check the dates! Although it is understandable living on opposite coast these days.. Thank you Stone! Please don't stop brewing this. Ever. Cheers, Kevin."

"O: Sometimes black IPAs just don't jive with me because the balance just seems to be off. This one worked very well. Just a really good mix of IPA and dark malt characteristics."

"MUCH better on tap than in the bottle. In the bottle -- for me -- it had a strong aroma of urine that really lessened the drinking experience. However, on tap, this aroma was not present, making it a very nice beer ... ON TAP."

"Delicious and smooth. It smells like chocolatey, roasty goodness with some mocha. I wish I could wear this as perfume. The taste matches the aroma, plus great hoppy flavor and bitterness. This is a wonderful, good looking brew that I could drink every day (if not for the price; haven't seen this bomber under 10 dollars around here!), my only complaint is the slight aftertaste. It's a bit astringent and aspirin like, more so than other IPAs/APAs I've had. Still, pretty amazing!"

"This pours a very dark brown/black color with a foamy light brown head. The aroma is rich and hoppy. The flavor is rich and bold with deep robust tone but still very hoppy. This finishes with an oak after taste and leaves a lingering bitterness. Very well made for the style."
""

"Deep, complex and intricate flavors abound. To bring out some of the complexities in an enticing manner and to truly savor the finish this beer offers, enjoy with a cigar."
"Overall i won't i wasn't too happy with the beer, i won't ever buy it again nor will i recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying a BIPA. spent 9.99 on a bomber and drank maybe 4 ounces of it before i dumped it all"

"Pours a pitch black color that's actually a little thinner looking than I am used to. It has a big 3 finger brown head that lingers for a bit before lacing the hell out of my snifter. First smell is fairly hoppy. PIne notes mostly. There are some muted roasty notes in the background. It's pretty muted. First sip is quite similar to the nose. Piney hops. Roasted malt. Some subtle coffee notes in the background. A little char  bitterness finished the brew off. There is a pretty clean finish with a low bitterness. It's very drinkable and the alcohol is hidden well. Not one I'd seek out again but that's moreso the fact I don't love the style."

"Bang!  Love it!  Black IPA.  Drinks like a stout.  Piney hops with roasted malts?  Smooth with a hidden bite back that is darn near unnoticeable.  Almost chewy if an IPA could be called chewy.  Subtle hints of citrus fruit.  12 oz bottle."
""

""

"Subtle hops, very drinkable and delicious"

"Dark, sweet, vanilla notes, chocolate flavor, spices (chicory?), balanced and smooth with a somewhat peaty and toasted malt finish that reminds one of a hearty stout. 8.6/10 not spectacular and doesn't remind one of an IPA, where are the hops?"

"Overall: I like this style of beer, its not better than any of the other ones I have had, but its not really worse. They all are around the same in quality, at least the ones that I have tried. This one is worth seeking out. I have a 4 pack of Founders Dark Penance I am looking forward to trying, I am interested in seeing how this compares."

"O- Though I feel like this beer is better realized and a bit smoother on draft, the bottled version certainly does it justice.  An unforgiving Black IPA that is the prototype for all other Black IPAs."

"Overall (4.25): Id rather have an IPA or a stout, but as far as Black IPAs go, this has to be one of the benchmarks. My favorite in the style so far. One part hops and one part roasted malts. Good stuff!"

"Update: Just tried this beer with steak, blue cheese and soy sauce and it tasted amazing.  This beer goes perfect with really savory food."
""
"TOTAL: 47/50"
"Black IPAs are one of my favorite beer creations. The creativity of balancing roasted malty goodness and hops that complement these flavor produces amazing beers. Stone's Black IPA is a great example of a complex amazing beer. The taste is well balanced of malt sweetness and hop bitterness with an acidic middle taste of mild balsamic vinegar."

"Very good but be warned, very strong and in your face. One of the stronger Black IPA Beers I've ever had but outstanding."

"O - I expected a lot more roasted malt and bitterness considering the style, but it was a great beer nonetheless.  I'm thinking that the bottle I had was past its prime as far as intense hoppiness, but for some reason a lot of great hop flavors stuck around.  Flavor profile reminded me of Terry's Chocolate Orange."
""
""
""
"Muddy, brown color.  Not flat, astonishingly."
"Pours black with some deep amber highlights. One inch head that clings to the glass quite well. Definite hop presence in the aroma, slight citrus, and roasted coffee. Taste has a pretty strong vanilla component blending nicely with pine and citrus hop. Great black IPA, its nice to see this style picking up some momentum!"
""
"very tasty. Hoppy front with strong backbone.  Great Balance.  No overt alcohol taste even tho it's 8.70 ABV.  Came in a very reasonably priced variety case way here on the east coast. Happy with this one"
"Really enjoyable black IPA. Sets the bar high for others."

"I am not an IPA fan by nature - I gravitate towards the 'Dark Side.'  This is the Skywalker of IPAs.  Bringing the malty darkness akin to a Sith Lord with the tremendous zest of a good Jedi IPA...  OK - done with the StarWars analogies.  A very good IPA for us stout fans."

"First BA review in a few years! Dark ruby when held to the light with big sheets of thick lacing. Great aromas from this one, malty and dark roasted notes, slightly sweet and subtle vanilla. Soft on the pallet with a nice hop texture, finishing with a lasting dryness till the next sip. Very balanced BIPA, lending itself to the the hoppy side of the range. The strong ABV is controlled and not overpowering, but shows on the finish. I really like this offering from Stone and see it as one to judge others."

"I really am not a fan of black IPA's but this is one of the best it seems. The appearance was nice being very dark brown and a tan head that lasts a bit. The smell is full of hops but not much else it would seem. The taste though was very different. Starting out with a lot of floral notes in the beginning gave way to a semi sweet malt finish that I found very refreshing. Would highly recommend."

"This has to be the best black IPA on the planet. Great dark appearance!  The smell of roasted malts is phenomenal. Characteristically over hopped like many Stone beers but the Taste is a perfect blend of malt and hops. This could be my favorite Stone beer, and they have a lot of great ones!"

"O: Do you ever find yourself getting mad at just how good Stone is at making beer? Because that was my emotion while drinking this. I'm waiting for the day when I find a bad Stone brew, but that day is not today. SSR Black IPA is just another example of why Stone remains one of the big names in the game. This beer is sure to please hopheads and stout drinkers alike, and provides a unique flavor profile that is sure to please anyone into unique brews."

"Overall this is not a bad IPA but not great. Stone over-hypes themselves by doing their usual bragging on the side of the bottle but this brew does not live up to the hype. Strong hops with no subtlety, roasted malts and burnt coffee. I would still say give it a try; I know that Stone is a popular brewery and you just might like this offering more than I."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I've passed over this beer for far too long and I will do it no more. The aroma on this beer is huge but it is slightly more bitter than I would like but that's nitpicking. For awhile I thought this beer was just a German style black ale but boy was I wrong. Also they could amp up the roast presence ever so slightly and it would probably be the best black IPA out there. But I really dig the hop profile on this one, it might be coincidence that I find NightTime to have a very similar hop profile, or maybe not."

"This is great beer. It looks like a stout and tastes like a IPA. Superb hoppy biter taste. Full feeling. Pleasent taste from lips to throat. It does have very little head when poured from the bottle but i would drink this beer very often. Stone as usual hits it out of the park."
""
""
""
"Taste actually goes the other way around now with the roasted malt backbone starting first, it's very roasted with a burnt bitterness to it, the bitterness is compounded with an aftertaste of piney hops, dark bitter chocolate lends a slight but fleeting sweetness, throughly thick and creamy as if it's a milk stout, definitely one of the fullest bodies for a black IPA I've had."
""
""

"O: A very good, drinkable, complex beer. Malt and hops do a good job of working together without overpowering the other. Will definitely drink again."

"O- A pretty alright, almost outstanding beer. I will say this was the second time I tried the beer after letting my tastebuds mature quite a bit. The first time I tried it I found it absolutely horrendous and overly bitter. This second time I found it much more satisfying. So if you don't like it the first time around, perhaps wait a few months or a year (if you were new to beer) and try it again."

"overall; you have to like strong, intense, slow- sip beers to appreciate this brew. if you are that type of drinker, or if you are a fan of black ipa's at a lll, you will love this beer."
""
""
""
"Pours very dark, nearly black with a thin head, but does have good lacing in the pint glass. Smells of sweet malt. A pleasant combination of malt, and faint coffee with just enough bitterness to remind you of an IPA. For me, there is not enough distinguishable fruit, and a lack of hop presence. A solid ale but not for me on a regular basis."

"Overall- this beer rules. Stone Brewery's fancy wording on the bottle does it justice. This is the kind of complex beer you can tell they made repeat batches with its recipe for a damned good reason. Overall, this beer just tastes fantastic, is pretty easy to drink, and not SO bitter where a regular beer drinker who is into craft brews wont find it a chore to finish the pint. A TON of hops at the beginning, but it doesnt leave you with an overly sticky/bitter feeling in your mouth. There is a great and complex flavor to the beer and makes you want to come back for more."

"Pours real nice, Dark Body with a tan foamy head, nice. However I found this beer to be cloyingly sweet and not enough hop presents for an IPA in my opinion. I would expect something on the level of the regular IPA at least. I prefer other offerings from Stone, I lived just a ""Stones Throw"" away in Escondido, for a while. Now in Texas I find this and am left wanting, wanting a really high hopped IPA."
""

"Overall Stone cant brew a bad beer, they just cant! Every brew they make is outstanding. This is an IPA to remember that's for sure. Every time i see a stone brew i have not had yet I am quick to snag it up."

"Overall - I've had black ipa's in the past where it seemed like a mediocre ipa was ""blackened"" in the hopes of improving it, not the case here. This feels alot more like a fantastic ipa that has been enhanced with complimentary flavors of roast, soy sauce and a whiff of molasses. A wonderfully complex and balanced black ipa/ale. Must try!"
""
"Overall- I was impressed. This is a strong yet smooth hop bomb. Easy drinking and packed with flavor. Possibly one of the biggest heads of all my bottle pours. I never had an ale so dark. What an awesome, heavy brew."

Stone has made a beer that somehow has a strong and intense flavor that makes you wish you had another bottle when you're done!"

"I'm not really a fan of IPA's, but this was the first ""dark"" IPA I'd ever tried. It is smooth and rich, with a good thick head that lingers just long enough for an ale. I had it from a bottle, served just under room temperature (about 55 or 60 degrees). The smell and taste are that of most IPAs that I've tried, very piney and bitter, which are not up my alley, but this beer has a good mouthfeel. Not too much carbonation, and it actually goes down fairly smooth. The strong hops flavor is just not my thing. This may be a fantastic beer to a true IPA fan, but it's just not my mug of ale."

""
""
""
"RECOMMEND."

""
""

"Definitely a solid black ale. But it's Stone so why would I expect anything other than excellence?"
""
""
"I am typically not a big fan of black ales, but this is by far the best i have tried! It smells like an IPA, looks like a porter, and tastes fantastic. Floral, hoppy, slightly piney, and slightly sweet. Drinks very smooth and conceals the 8.7 very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. Complex and big in taste."
""
""

"O: More pine than I like. Nose is much better than the taste. Still recommended, especially if you like their taste in hops (I personally don't, though I love Enjoy By IPA)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The bottle had passed its drink by date by a few weeks, but I don't think it negatively impacted my experience. I'll say that am not generally a huge fan of black ales or black IPAs. I prefer the coffee and chocolate or grainy goodness of stouts and porters. With that said, this is a very good take on the style, and with Stone's signature hop profile, this is something I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
""

"I've always been a lover of all of Stone's ipa products but had not delved outside of that line of beers...boy am I glad I did. This black ipa pours and tastes much more like a porter than any ipa I've ever had. It is near perfect opaque black in color but thin and smooth in body. Starts with a small tan head that dissipates to a slight tan lacing that holds well to the glass throughout the session. The aroma is actually very subtle with a lot of roasted malt scents upfront and a little hop and sweetness behind it. The flavor is nothing like I expected following the nose. It is rich and deep with notes of chocolate, coffee, and maybe even a little pepper. Great balance of the sweetness of the malt with the bitterness of the hops. I still feel this one falls closer to porter than black ipa but what ever it is; I think I'll have another one."
""
""
""
""
"It tastes great, just hoppy enough where you know it's beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Easily one of the best IPA's around. Bold and robust. Yet tropical and refreshing. You can eat the beer, or pair it with food. Everything is in balance with this beer. I love the warming, bubbly effect. What IPA's do that? Only a Cascadian Dark Ale/Black IPA can pull this off. Sublimely Self-Righteous matches all of the best IPA's and yet cranks up the hops highly and is packed with mysterious head scratching flavors. So known yet unknown. A beer Stone has every right to brag about. Hopefully this beer will be permanently made and available."
""
"Really enjoy this beer. It is in my top 5 and has been for a while now ."
"A pretty great beer, and one of the best black IPAs I've had, for sure."

"O: I'm not a hophead. I like my English browns, but Stone continues to make me a convert. It's nicely layered with malt and hops and gives a pleasant complexity. I'd buy this again!"
"All in all, a very pleasing ale. Not my favorite, but certainly not bad and I don't mind drinking it at all. This ale in my opinion is a great after dinner drink."
""

"A very well crafted beer. Although I'm not a particular fan of this style of beer, I'd definitely drink this one again."

"Overall, another of Stone's boastful beers lives up to its name; a beer this good certainly deserves a good deal of self-righteousness. This is the perfect black IPA/cascadian dark ale/hopped black ale/etc. as I imagine the style in its purest form."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a stellar ""black IPA"". One of my favorites in the style if not THE favorite. Really does an excellent job of creating a balanced, meaty, refreshing beer that has the best of both worlds that are quintessential to a black IPA. Also does an exceptional job of concealing the almost-9% ABV."

"Another hit for me, picked this up while looking for stones porter as replacement for lack if porter.  Luckily for me the porter wasn't in stock, this was amazing.  I'm typically a quad, stout, or porter only drinker and now this will be part of my normal purchase routine."

"Really strong herbal hops dominate the aroma. Some charcoal, cocoa powder, mango and roast notes hit the nose as well. 8 Ball black appearance with some decent lacing and thin foam. Really strong bitter hops greet the palate. Shortly after, the stout quality comes through delivering strong roast, dry coffee bean oil, subtle toffee and smokey notes to the palate. Finish is immensely dry with a continuous bitterness, herbs and strong alcohol. As it warms up, the juicy, fruity qualities really shine through with grapefruit juice, mango, tropical fruits and pineapple. Really a fantastic take on the style."
""
""
""
"O- I was really impressed by this beer. The flavors balance incredibly well despite belonging to different styles. To me, this was a quality stout meets a quality IPA. Honestly, how can you beat that? For those times I'm torn between the two styles, this is will be beautiful solution. I will be having this far too often."

"Worst bottle of beer I've had from Stone, but I think I say that for personal reasons. I'm sure it's great to someone, but not to me. It looked really nice. finger and a half head. some lacing. Smelled kind of foul. It had the typical hops aroma, but it smelled burnt. Literally like a burnt piece of pine wood. It tasted like it smelled, literally. I dumped the second half out. Perhaps I had a bad bottle, that's why I didn't mark it any lower than I did. Scared to try again though. I will stick with Ruination as my Stone brew of choice >.>"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - What a great beer to ring in the fall season. It's deep, dark, bitter, complex, balanced, what more can I say. I can't wait to be rocking this around a campfire, and it's got the ABV to keep me warm."
""
""
""
""
""

"Not boozy at all for such a high abv. Delicious version if a black ipa."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- For a style I really enjoy, this one was not as great as I was hoping for. A nice example of a stronger black IPA, but not one of the better ones I have had."

""
""
"Taste starts with grapefruit and orange, moving on to a ton of resin, followed by a splash of floral sweetness, then an onslaught of pine, finishing with a charred roastiness with coffee and hints of chocolate and caramel. Has a roasty, floral, citric, coffee aftertaste. Has just below average body with above average carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium, going neither to bright and soft or too rich and thick, having elements of each and offering some dryness from the bitter element and the char while remaining almost juicy despite it. Bitterness lingers in a full finish."
"The worst Stone beer I've had."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste wise, it is the hoppiness and bitterness hitting you, but well balanced with hint of bananas and spices. Nothing is very too strong, it is well balanced. The aftertaste is bitter and round in mouth."

""
""

"O-A damn good black IPA. I personally like Thomas Creek Orange-Black IPA more, but this one is still great. Hops are a touch overwhelming."

"Black IPAs have always been an odd mix to me. Everything is there...Roasty-ass IPA."

"Stone has really outdone itself if you ask me. This is one great beer that brings together dark malt with a bit of bitter of it's own from the burnt and charred qualities and it's signature hop bitter. This was fruity and tremendously sweet. That sweetness deepens on the nose and in the drink as it warms but it never surpasses the tart fruits or the piney resin. The brown sugar goes so well with the orange. I'm in love. Sticky, sweet, full mouthfeel. I could drink this all day."

"Because they have the ratio of taste nailed down exactly the way they want it, the fellas at Stone aren't afraid to ramp up the scale of boldness. What they've left us with is a beer that satisfies with every sip. It doesn't leave you wanting more in any sense of the word because it gives you everything already. In spades. And lets be honest, if you like Stone, this is what you looking for in the first place. Get yourself a glass but do save some for me, because this is a beer I'll be seeing again."

"O = This is actually only the second Black IPA that I have had, the other one was the Black Racer IPA from Bear Republic. I think this is a very good beer, I would probably enjoy this better during the day in a hot weather but overall, a very good beer."
""
"O - A really wonderful example of the style. Plus extra points for coming in a four pack, my favorite container style."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very very good beer. I really wish I had another this is so drinkable - full of flavor, great appearance and mouthfeel, and great with food (BLTs, tabbouleh, brownies for dessert). I will have to look out for a six pack of this one."
""
""
""
"O-I should have expected a Black Ale from stone to pack loads of hops, but the tropical hop onslaught in this beer exceeded my expectations by a long way. The aroma is a real high-point. In fact, this is one of the better smelling brews I have tasted recently. That being said, I could have used a little more charred/chocolatey malts from this brew if I was going to judge to style."
"Overall: I think I got a bad bottle of this beer, because every other Stone beer I've had has been great. This one just had a funk to it that was a little cheesy. Great roasty and malty flavors with some solid bitterness on the finish."
""
""
""
"O - 4.50 - Good beer, great black iPA, not as amazing as Stone's IPAs and Imperial Stouts. I'd probably say Wookey Jack is a bit better, with Dad's Little Helper (Rogue) and Dubhe (Uinta) being quite a bit below this."
""
""

"Had this on tap in Arlington VA. It pours a nice jet black color into a tulip glass. Aroma is a mix of chocolate and coffee. Taste is a little weird to me, not sure if it's possible that my palate just isn't appreciative of black ipa's (this is my first one) but there really isn't too much flavor to this beer. It has a nice balance but the hops bite I get from other IPA's just isn't there on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Great brew, very complex."
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with no head from the bottle. Aroma of sweet roasty malt, pine hops and sweet candy. Flavor is smoky malt and some pine hop bitter. Lots of smoke for a non smoked beer. Plenty of bite from the hops, with a nice clean bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel with more than adequate carbonation. Solid beer, but I’m not sure it belongs with the likes of Wookey Jack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but the hop profile didn't impress me as much as other Black IPA's and the bitterness was just a little too aggressive in this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, and the alcohol was a little too warming for it's strength, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, I think the bitterness would really start to wear on me if I had more then one. What I like the most about the beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very good with appearance being the best, it may be the best looking Black IPA I have ever seen. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor, it wasn't bad, I just wish the hop profile highlighted those citrus hops that I got in the aroma more and I thought the bitterness was just too intense for this beer, it would really help the drinkability if it was toned down. I wouldn't buy this again, it's no a bad beer, but there's many more Black IPA's that I like more than this one so I don't think I will be revisiting it anytime soon and I think it's a little overpriced but I would recommend that any fan of the style at least give it a try. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, Stone is very good with hoppy beers, but this one fell a little short in my eyes and it didn't have a hop profile that kept me coming back for me, better luck next time guys."

"Pours an almost black color with a medium long lasting beige creamy head with good lacing. Aroma of citrus, orange peel, pine hops upfront with some good dark caramel chocolate malt. Taste is of dark chocolate malt, a bit of liquorices with a good amount of citrus hops. A medium to full oily body on the palate, slightly smooth with a sweet bitter sticky mouth feel. The finish is a combination of sweet dark caramel malt, chocolate some brown sugar, the ending is sweet bitter liquorices and citrus orange bitterness for balance. Caramel malt flavor shows through more as it warms up. Although a bit on the bitter side, it is an interesting combination of flavors, but still a very good and tasty brew, well done."

"Fresh, I don't care for this beer one bit. Too hoppy and the malt hasn't really developed much. Too smoky and roasty too. However, I sat on a bottle for like 6 months, and gave it another try, and holy crap it's amazing! It balances out so much better. The hoppiness dies down considerably, the smokiness too. The roasty maltiness tones down a ton too. Really smooths out and becomes extremely enjoyable."

"I did not take notes on this ale so I'm going on memory. I was not impressed with this ale. It had a burnt taste and smell. it was not very smooth. I was Ok with the hops level, but was way too harsh. This was a very OK beer. I would like to try this again to see if I had a bad bottle."
"Packed full of flavor, this brew is about as complex as they get. Most black ipas don't jive for me, as the roast malt character and citrusy hops often collide in a negative way, but not the case with this one. The bitterness is a touch more than I prefer."
""

""
""
""
""

"What a great beer! Dark, a really dark tan color--almost black. Fair carbonation. Coffee fan? You will love this bitter beer! Feels creamy in the mouth, goes down smooth, but has an unexpected bitter finish. This beer is overwhelming, and pretty much dominates your palette. Do not start with this first unless you only plan on drinking this all night, or plan to move up to something even more rich in flavor."

"O - Although this isn't one of my usual styles I really enjoyed this beer. Not something I would sit and drink a lot of but on its own is a really nice brew. It should go well with my steak and gravy tonight"
""
""
"O: IPA's typically don't have much appeal for me. I am a stout lover to the core, but I find this one to have just enough stout characteristics to have some merit. I also had this on tap recently, and found it to be very drinkable. The ABV is very deceptive. Definitely a good gateway beer for those who loves stouts but are having trouble with IPA's."

""

""
""
"O: a great balance of roasted malts and hops; just what I'm looking for in BIPAs, good stuff! I'll definitely drink this again"
""
""
""
""
""
"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this beer. Since its from Stone Brewing, I knew it wasn't going to bad. I didn't think it was going to be this good. In the end, this beer was very roasted and very well balanced. Would I drink it again? Yeah, I would."
""
""
" This is a really good beer. Not one I would like to drink every day, but sparingly it stands out as a true champion of beers; all beers. It's not quite inside any true style (I don't think), it kinda stands on it's own on many levels. If you haven't tried it, you most definitely should. But don't be afraid to leave this one for later in the night. It will not be pushed around by others."

"Darker than I was expecting, almost a black copper. Malts dominate the smell, big taste of caramel malts, dry hop bitterness, and alcohol. The head diminishes quickly, but leaves thick swaths of lacing on the way down. Hint of thick, syrupy mouthfeel, but vey pleasant. A strong filling ale, with lots of character. Definitely not an everyday ale, but makes a good impression when the occasion occurs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - First time trying this beer and will certainly buy again. Love the look of this beer and obviously more importantly, the taste. A lot going on, yet nothing is out of place. Have yet to have a bad beer by Stone Brewing, and they're probably my favorite brewery. Highly recommend this brew."

"Such an interesting beer. It has the hop profile of an IPA, but the malt profile of a porter or stout. Pine resin taste from the hops and a roasted taste from the malt. Also, a hint of chocolate or espresso as well. I would definitely have this beer again. Another great from Stone,"
"O: This is a really interesting beer. Tastes like an IPA/stout."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I seem to have a love-hate relationship with this style, and this one is definitely on the ""love"" side. I love the complex, dominant hop profile, but the roast malt supports the hops just right for the style. This beer reinforces Stone as a go-to brewery for me."
""
""
""
"O: I am very impressed by this beer. While I am far from a huge fan of Stone, this is definitely one of the best beers I've had by them, right up with Espresso IRS and Enjoy By. I would not hesitate to have this beer again, and I will probably purchase it again if I am in the mood for a black IPA-type beer, which is really what this reminds me of. If Hop in the Dark were available year-round, this would have a bit more contest, but as it is, this may become the go-to for me in its style."

"O: I hate this beer. I'm not a fan of Black IPAs to begin with, and this beer is exactly why I don't like them. The flavors don't mingle well together. It's too bitter (but not in super hopped up way). I just don't get this style. I may never buy another Black IPA ever again. Serious."
""

"Overall, an awesome Cascadian Dark Ale. Very strong at 8.7% abv, but very drinkable and full of huge flavors. Perhaps my favorite year-round offering from Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picture Arrogant Bastard, with a bit roasted barley, and a tad more alcohol. Hops are a bit less forward in this beer. You now have Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale. Tan head Black as night, great lacing, mouth feel just right, delicious. Definitely buy this one next time I see it."

"Overall this has become one of my favorite beers with just one tasting session. I've bought another bottle and will enjoy it again soon. I highly recommend trying a piece of dark chocolate (>85%) with the drink after thoroughly tasting it."
""
""
""
"o: I know some people are on the fence about black ales - i love them. this is really good, and the flavors harmonize well. not as good as the espresso sublimely self-righteous or hop in the dark, but a close third. plus its year round - that a plus"
"overall - very enjoyable. I don't really drink Black IPA's often but I think I should start, or at least buy this beer more often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The color is a very dark with a large, thick head, and the aroma is hoppy with citrus and resin notes showing out the loudest. The taste is bitter, slightly sweet, and reminds me of some imperial stouts out there; the aftertaste combines a long bitter finish, soft carbonation, medium body, and a slightly sticky texture."

"Overall... Boom. Friggin' awesome black IPA. Was thinking about inviting the neighbor over for a taste, but after getting halfway through the first glass decided I'm finishing this bomber myself."
""
""
"Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale pours a black color, with a small lacing head. There is a nice smokey, but mostly floral aroma. The taste has a sharp hoppy kick, then finished smooth and smokey, with hints of a burnt like malt flavors. Good full flavors. Overall this beer is soo incredibly enjoyable, great full intense flavors."
""
""
"Pours black but not too thick. Very nice creamy tan head that left ample lacing on sides of the glass. Nice job of combining a great stout with a great IPA. You get to enjoy all of the complex flavours of both beer types in just the right combination. Another great Stone offering. Would highly suggest giving it a try."

"overall: I will be buying this upon seeing it, tastes amazing. I would say this beer tastes very similar to Sweetwater's Happy Ending seasonal, if you've had that (or this), you will love the other. Except this one is a tad bit more malt heavy. Either way, I love dark beer with lots of hops, and if you do too, Stone did a great job with this one. Well crafted beer."

"Overall- Right now, this seems like a B+,A-. It's closer to a B+ for having a typical IPA flavor profile but strives toward an A- because of its unique mouthfeel."

""

""
""
""
""
"The body was moderately light. Some drying finish and ashy. astringent finishes. Carbonation was light. Overall good hop presence but because of the off yeast notes I couldn't finish it."
""
""
"O - Still a great beer. When I buy my yearly case I might start aging half of them as they were different yet delicious."
"Really well done beer - amazingly big in the nose and mouth. Not my favorite version of the style, but still really good."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic beer. Hop flavors and scents are complex and intense and the malt presence is the perfect counterpart. This is the best beer I have had in quite some time."
"If more black IPAs were like this, they wouldn't beso much like the red-headed stepchild of beer styles"

"Overall - Once again, an excellent offering from Stone. Just like the last beer I reviewed, I was not sure what to classify it as until I got home and reviewed it. I see here BA has it as an American Black, which is fine. These hybrid beers are wicked good! Hats off to the brewers. Try this beer out ASAP, Condor recommended."
""
"O - If I was entertaining an IPA-lover, I would get them this. Usually I do buy Daisy Cutter or Dog Fish Head 90 Minute IPA, but this would be good in the IPA rotation."

"O: Pretty good black ipa a bit too hoppy for a black ipa I like hops so it wasn't bad just not to style in my opinion. It also does not have that great of a scent but this is a real solid beer and I would highly recommend it very drinkable for the abv and tasty."
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby edges.  The nose is pungently hoppy.  The flavor profile is strong on the hops but the roasted malt takes a bit of a back seat."
""
""
"Note: I would be willing to try it at a warmer temp., perhaps it might mellow out or add some depth. I just don't get the bitter beer movement."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A very pleasant dark IPA. I can't say I'd enjoy more than one bomber in a night due to it's complexity, but the taste is overall impressive. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a dark IPA. I can see why this beer was brought back after being the Stone 11th Anniversary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting beer, like a super-hoppy porter or a full-bodied black IPA. Stone's beers frequently defy categorization, but in this case that's a good thing. This one gets straight 4's from me because I was impressed (albeit not floored) in every field. Would certainly buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it drinks very solid. There is no offensive flavors to be found and is very expertly made. I just don't enjoy the taste enough to finish a 22 oz bottle. Definitely presents itself as a strong, alcohol forward beer."

""
"A great drink."

"This is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: If you can't make up you mind between a Russian Imperial Stout and a Imperial IPA, this is the beer for you. It's like mixing Old Rasputin with Palate Wrecker. A Masterpiece by STONE."
""
""
"This is almost just exactly perfect. It pours up a deep ebony black with a generous foamy tan head, good retention, and lacing just about unlike any ever seen before for this style. The smell is a powerful and satisfying dark chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Taste is an initial malty sweetnesss giving way to a big coffee taste of a finish, well balanced. Mouthfeel is very thick and lucious. Almost just exactly perfect."
""
"O - 4.0 - I think I've only had one other black ale but I'm liking the style. I forgot about this in the back of my fridge for I'm thinking more than three months, and my store is notorious for old shelf stock. So I don't know how old this is but it could be substantial. Don't see a date. But knowing Stone I imagine it would have been a good bit hoppier when fresh, and that may explain the depression, which I won't quite call a hole."

"Very appealing root beer appearance with coppery edges. A large, frothy head that leaves a thin layer of foam and sparse lacing as it recedes. The aroma is a blend of citrus and sharp hops, a bit metallic; reminds me of the smell of a jar full of old pennies just opened. I loved that smell as a kid. Strong hops bitterness hits up front, citrus again with a little hint of alcohol followed by some mild maltiness. Just the right level of carbonation, the hops drys the mouth and leaves touch of bitterness in the back of the tongue. A delicious, unique and satisfying ale all around."

"This was pretty disappointing. I'm a huge fan of Stone but this ale really didn't do anything for me. However while the taste left a lot to be desired the aroma was phenomenal."
"This beer is exceptional and can be drank in nearly every setting. Much like all of Stone's brews, Sublimely Self-Righteous is a true beer, that does not make you cringe or question, but instead it delivers 2 notches above what you were hoping for. I love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall tasty, but the individual flavors don't seem to match well for me. Probably won't try this one again. Also a bit pricey compared to Stone's other offerings."
""
""
""
""
"O: Full disclosure: I am not a fan of IPAs in any form, but since this one was from Stone, I felt it warranted a try. A remarkable representation of the style, and priced reasonably (which is not always the case when looking to buy a brew from Stone). I will finish my bomber and enjoy the experience of tasting a truly remarkable American black ale. However, I probably will not purchase again - simply out of personal preference."
""
""
"O - My favorite Black Ale so far. I'm still not particularly sold on the style, but this example is pretty good."
"This is a quality ale. The great thing is that it's now being sold in 4 packs as opposed to the 22oz format. I'm a fan of Stone and will continue to support them by purchasing more Sublimely."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When it comes to taste, this is the real deal. The front is dominated by the aforementioned pine hops that bite the tip of the tongue, but the middle of the sip reveals a very creamy, slightly waxy mouthfeel that brings out a really balanced malt profile which eventually coalesces back with the hop profile near the end until a wonderful finish of dark chocolate gets the last word. Medium carbonation provides a nice bite and meshes perfectly with the slightly roasted, chocolatey finish. An absolutely stellar example of balance and linear taste progression from these arrogant bastards."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"However, I just can't get over that taste. Probably my biggest disappointment from Stone ever."

"Overall, this is a pretty good example of a style that I am discovering that I like. Not quite as Wookey Jack from my memory, but the mix of hops and dark malts is superb except for that slight finishing flavor. Wish these weren't $8 a bomber."
""
"O...nice winter beer for us hop heads. The only thing I didn't like is it seems like hops used may not be just right to compliment the malt. Something seems ever so slightly off. I bet this will go great with a maduro cigar. I will try that combo tomorrow."
"Pours a nearly pitch black topped with a one and half finger cream-colored head. Great retention and significant web-like lacing. Roasted malt, light citrus, and pronouced piney notes on the nose. Opens with roasted malt and a bit of citrus joined by grapefruit rind. Finishes with bitter rind, pine, and roasted grain and malt. Well carbonated smooth, and silky. A fantastic black IPA; a brew that was one of the first to define the style."

""
""
""
""
"O - this is the best black ipa I've ever had and probably the first I actually seeked out to try. Stone sets the bar for this style and everyone else follow in line. I'm sure there are some good black IPAs out there, but I can't imagine any being better than this. A few may be equal, but for me this is the standard for American Black IPAs and is already becoming a classic for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Amazing beer. Definitely my favorite easy to come by, drink any time beer. Possibly one of my favorite beers overall. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone, especially any one looking to explore the black IPA style."
""
""
"D: For a nearly 9% beer, this goes down almost too easily."
""
""
""
"O: this is a well made beer with terrific flavors, well hopped with dark fruit sweetness for balance, an excellent black ale"
"Pours a very dark, almost black with inch of deep mocha head. Smell is very malt forward with chocolate and other roasted notes, with some definite pieny hops. Taste is substantial, really nice body to this beer and great balance of raosted malts and piney hops with a very creamy and somewhat sweet finish. Great finish on this beer actually makes you want more."
"Final Thoughts: Another great hoppy beer from Stone. They get bonus points for adding a 'best by' date on every bottle which assured I got fresh beer. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"Overall, Stone has set the bar for black IPA's. I think this is one of the best beers on the market as it is so well rounded in all categories and is worthy of its namesake."

"This really an excellent beer, the hops taste so fresh and so well balanced."

"Note to Self: Rated #4 American Black Ale when I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the most readily available and yet best black ales out there. This style is becoming more popular, but it's difficult to find examples that are as good as this, let alone as easy to get. It does a good job of balancing hops and roasted malts, both very present but without one overwhelming the other."
""
""
"O: Overall, Stone never ceases to impress me, this was a very interesting beer, had a nice contrast of mellow, easy going mouth feel paired with the very bitter, strong hop backlash, I liked it, not a bad pick at all."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, damn it, this is what matters most right? I hold this beer like I hold my member. It is precious."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't think my palate knows what to do with black ales just yet. The tropical notes just don't seem to mesh well with the heavy malt. This is good, but nothing I'd by again. Don't think I can appreciate black ales."
"Black in color with brownish hues on the edge of the glass. Poured with a thick beige foam with excellent staying power that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Black patent malt and citrus and resinous pine hop aromas. Medium bodied with a creamy smooth feel. Dark roasted and burnt malt flavors below intense bitter citrus and pine hop flavors. A nice combination of intense flavors with a delicate feel."

"Wow - what a beer! I think this might be my favourite Stone brew yet. Incredibly hoppy, although the malt provides good balance while lurking discretely in the background. The aroma and flavour are peerless. Amazing - I don't think I could recommend this too highly. Form a line, hop-lovers! Self-righteousness shall be yours..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some have called Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale's flavor muddled. I disagree. Though they are many, the beer's flavors mingle well and complement each other. I would not call this beer balanced, but that's okay. Some beers challenge the mind and palate. There is balance and counterpoint among this brew's complex flavors, which take time to develop and never rest. Sip slowly and watch the colors dance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty and citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sublime, it truly is. Stone, as usual, never disappoints. Not only that, it over delivers all the time. Excellent stuff there. Highly recommended for hop heads for winter drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells of a wonderful blend of blackened roasted malts and fresh juicy citric hopping of both oranges and grapefruits. As the glass warms, resinous hopping aroma joins in as well. The flavor is slightly more roasted-focused than the nose is, but that is not to say that the hopping is not well represented. There is plenty of piney goodness to go around. It overall keeps very dry and ABV is about 75% hidden. (There is a rising warmth in the background, but mostly the orange peel hopping is made fruitier and richer by the ABV presence, which is a good thing in my book.) This is one of the best Black IIPAs out there on the market IMHO."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. Not something I will drink often (may enjoy as the weather really turns cold). Stone is awesome. Need I say more?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer in this category. Definitely not much in the way of balance. But that's ok, because it's damn good. I'm frequently at a toss up between the well balanced American Black Ales or the hop heavy ones. This is one of my favorite hop forward ones."
"Being my first Stone beer in nearly two years, its too early to say how it stacks up with the rest of their lineup. However, the price is great ($10.99 for a 4-pack) and I imagine this will become a part of my regular drinking lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I love this beer because it's so unique - it's almost starts off in your mouth like an IPA then transforms into a porter right in front of your palette. One of the first brews I ever had from Stone, and it surely did not disappoint. Great beer."

"O - Overall this IPA is very good. Loaded with hops, compulsively drinkable, and sublimely self-righteous. Thank you again Stone."
""
""
""
"It pours dark with good clarity and mild/medium retention. It smells super hoppy and has a mild malt taste. It has a bigger body than I expected and has a bunch of malts and then a powerful hop finish. Great beer for IPA fans."

""
"O-American black ales have always been one of my favorite styles, as counter intuitive blend of bitter citrusy hops blended with the sweeter smokier stout has always created a very intriguing flavor profile. I would say this is either my second or third favorite black ale behind Coasts' Event horizon, and potentially Southern Tier's inequity. This Stone brew, relies heavier on the stout side of things that makes it more unique than other brews and for many, a great intro into the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a great beer. One of my favorites. Stone really nailed a 'style' that can be hit or miss."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is unlike any other beer and is remarkably affordable given its quality. In a lineup that ranges from good (porter, pale) to incredible (IPA, IRS), Sublimely Self Righteous is maybe Stone's apotheosis."
"Not sure why this is classified as an American Black Ale, it’s more like a Double Black IPA to me. And a good one at that."
"O- This is seriously one bitter and dry beer, which is not surprising from Stone. This is like a black IPA version of Ruination. While the flavor profile has some differences from 15th Anniversary Black IPA, both are among the driest and most bitter beers I have had."
""
""
"O: an amazing beer and the cream of the crop in Black IPAs in my experience. In any case, a world class beer all hop heads should seek out."
""
""
""
"Had I not been able to look at this beer, I would have sworn that it was an IPA. Neither my nose nor my palate could pick up any more than an inkling of roastiness or malty sweetness. Personally, I would prefer a bit more balance, but what can you expect from Stone?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all this is the beer getting me interested in black ipas. One of my favorites, will continue to be one of my regular pick ups"
""
""
"Overall: The quintessential black IPA. I remember first trying this black IPA several years ago and being absolutely blown away, because not only did it possess the bright, hop forward and citrus-y flavor profile of an imperial IPA, but it also had the appearance and chocolate-y and slightly roasty malt characteristics of a great and smooth porter. Nowadays, it seems like more and more Black IPAs forget to include the chocolate roastiness of Porters in their taste. Sublimely Self-Righteous certainly doesn't succumb to this pitfall and definitely earns it's namesake year after year."
""
"This is one of the most deceptively colored beers. Really tastes like a standard double IPA than a black IPA. Deep roasted malt comes through a touch in the beginning of the sip but huge resinous hop presence comes through almost instantly. Despite the massive amount of hops and big bitterness pretty good balance, a bit of detectable alcohol. Touch of malt but this beer is a big hop show case. If you love double IPA's you'll love it because big pretty good tasting and pretty standard. However for such a dark beer the malt really doesnt play as much of a role as you expect it. Good but I was expecting much more, especially at the price."

""

"Great beer, one of my favorite Black IPAs, definitely the benchmark for the style."

"UPDATE: 9/4/12 - I have drank this beer a few more times since this review; once on tap and a couple bottles. I really like this beer a lot more than my original review and it is probably one of my favorite black IPA's now. I have updated my scores and review accordingly."
"O-This really is an ipa with a dark color. It's possible that due to that, this is one of my favorite black ales out there. It's drinkable and tasty and not at a terrible price."

"This ale is black, and it quickly eats up any attempt color throws at it, only in the outer edges of its deathly grasp can you faintly detect a simple shade of red escaping. This beats is trapped by a thick billowy cloud of bubbles, tan in color and very tempting, like the sirens of old as described to me by Homer…and they bring friends, many friends to lure you into their depth (good lacing). If you’ve been to hell and back, then you certainly recognize the odor of sulfur (hops, hops and more hops all mixed in with some dark fruit and citrus aromas here and there). If you’ve ever eaten Eskimo P***y then this beast will fair no different, among the best tastes in the world. Simply delightful for a hophead; relatively light bodied for this brewer, but the hops are present and do not disappoint. The roasted barley is fresh and its bite is mild and only gives you a hint of the alcohol it contains. The citrus flavors you feel when it first hits you are quickly transformed into a lasting and lingering burnt hops aftertaste. This is a very good ale!"

"Sublimely is yet another stellar showing from Stone. It's the best of both worlds with malty and hoppy characters."
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown with a foamy, persistent, root beer head. Aroma is conspicuously absent, given the gorgeous presentation. Some raw grain, some citrus hop notes. Nice, evenly balanced mouthfeel between the fullness and the carbonation. Flavors are comprised of spooned mashing grain, lemon, pine, and grass. Some dark roasted barley. Finishes with some faint pine and unfermented sugar. Big beer, but not because of any one big flavor. This is my favorite Stone brew. That's not saying a lot because I think most are deplorable. But, I do like this one a lot."
""
""
"Stone has a reason to be proud of this one. I can't understate how complex this beer tastes--so much so that I feel that I'm missing something and underrating it. Will definitely revisit--would love to try this on tap. Highly recommend"

"Overall my vote would be to rate this up there with the best of them. Pallet differences aside for anyone who likes porter/stouts and a great IPA this is for you. Hands down the best ""black IPAS"" I've ever had. Thank you Stone brewery!"

"Pours dark and black in the glass. Good head at pour - at least a finger and a nice off white color and good retention. Solid spider web lacing. Aroma is hoppy yet presence of malts even on nose - sweet, bitter and a hint of roast. Flavor is equally impressive with malts present up front and malts showing more towards the back. Extremely well balanced."
""
""
""
"Beer's body is medium to medium-heavy in weight, with fairly light to medium-light levels of carbonation. The result is a fairly smooth beer with a hefty body, resulting in a full and satisfying mouthfeel. Closes out expectedly dry, with long-lingering bitterness and a touch of residual sweetness around the lips."
""
"O- Buy it and try it. If you like stouts and Ipa's then this seems to be the perfect combo."
""
""
""
"O: I'm really disappointed it's only 'okay' instead of 'mindblowing' like its (sorely missed) big brother. I'm thinking maybe oldish bottle, but the Stone 15th I had was 6 months old, and it still blew me away. To be fair, that was clearly more malt driven - so I'll try this again fresh, or maybe on tap."

"Pours dark, dark brown. A bit of a tan head and good, sticky lacing. Smells of hops! lots of hops! The hops give off a citrus and pine aroma. Can also smell a bit of roasted barley. The taste is great. Extremely hoppy, but there is also some malty sweetness. It is roasty, yet the hops give it a light and refreshing character. It's like stone's IPA, but black and roasted! It's great! medium body and carbonation."
""
""
"O - This is a very good beer, I can understand why they decided to brew it again. Nice flavors and aroma, and heavy on the bitterness as always for their stuff. Scent needs more than just pine though, it is very overwhelming. Definitely a beer I would get again if I was looking for something dark and bitter."
""
"Overall- Interesting beer but a little too bitter for my tastes. I still prefer a good stout or porter but this would be my first choice for an IPA (black or otherwise)."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. The color is almost pure black with the most minimal notes of brown when held to the light. There is a tower or beige head that leaves sticky lacings all over the glass. The nose is full of roasted coffee and chocolate malt with a dominating citrus and pine hop character. Very good nose. The taste is very hop dominant. There is lots of citrus hops, grapefruit and orange peel with some resin. A nice balance comes from the roasted malts which even out the palate very well. The palate is big with a long bitter finish. Great black IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"So much roast. It's like an unsweetened chocolate bar, with West Coast hops. This is not the most extreme (I'm looking at you, Stone 15th Anniversary Escondidian Imperial Black IPA), but it's beyond solid."
"Overall: This is one of the better approaches to the ""Black"" IPA. Massive flavor but manages a balance. I set this as the benchmark for the style."
""
""
""
"dark brown, almost black pour with a nice head that quickly dissipates. smell is big on roasty malts with a very nice hop aroma on the back end. the taste grows on you. sweet up front, bitter finish. hops are blended perfectly. a lot of flavor here. great. medium bodied with mild carbonation. a hard style to do but stone nailed this."

"Pours an almost pitch black with thick off white head and sticky lacing. Malty hop aromas...slight chocolate malt notes. Taste is very hop forward and bitter but is well balanced with the roasted chocolate malts. Very thick and malty but bitter hoppy at the same time. Its basically a dark DIPA. Its the first Stone I actually enjoy and well worthy of #400!"
""
"Excellent take on a dark, hoppy beer. If it wasn't for the fuller body it would almost seem like a borderline DIPA with coloring added. The hop and malt characters are in near perfect complement to each other."
""
""

"Overall: As expected, it's amazing. This may be my new favorite from stone."

"Unique creation. Very good, was a pleasure to drink. Originally brewed for their 11th Anniversary in 2007 and it is still being brewed. I must drink it every year to celebrate the anniversary of trying this beer. Thin tan head on a black beer with hints of red on the perimeter. Aroma is complex and the taste is superb. Cheers."

"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours black with a tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The beer is opaque, but bubbles can be seen collecting on the underside of the head. The hop aroma of this beer is strong, but I can also pick up dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and some mild sweetness in the smell. The taste follows the nose. The citrus hop flavor is intense, but I can also pick up the malty flavors as well as bitter chocolate and anise. The alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor. The body of the beer is medium to full with plentiful carbonation. The drinkability is very high for such a big beer. Overall, this is a most excellent beer that everyone should try once."

"O: The most interesting American Black Ale I can remember having. My description probably didn’t do the flavor profiles justice, but it was clear that this was more than a simple IPA with some roasted malt flavor thrown into the mix."
""
"Overall, an outstanding beer. Basically a blend of the sweet flavors of a Belgian dubbel with a much higher hop bitterness. The choice of the more citrusy hops was a great idea because they blend well with the sweetness. It's basically an imperial black IPA. Really interesting and really good."
"O-I love the hops and for a dark ale it brings a lot of subtleties. I've seen other reviews describe it as a black IPA and it fits the bill. Good beer for a good price. Stone brewers have the right to be sublimely self righteous."

"Overall: A well balanced but still hop forward black ale that surprises with it's complexity? Check. Decent price? Check. The fun of Stone brewery? Check. Another hit from Stone and another delicious hop-heavy black ale for the world."

"Re-review 11/18/12- I had this on tap a few months ago and was disappointed ,and now I'm having it again from the bottle, and I gotta say it's just as disappointing. Too much bitter pine character overruns the entire experience. I don't know if the bottle I had initially was old and the hops had mellowed to the point that other flavors were able to shine through, or if there's been a change in the brewing process, but it's been a pure pine bomb the last few times I've had it. My score now reflects my latest assessment, which is far less favorable."

"Medium-full body with mild carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. Feels great and a dry finish leaves you wanting more."
""
"O: My favorite “Black IPA” so far. Actually one of my favorite beers. None of the yuck-y cream cheese taste that seems to be ever present in hops in the dark and back in black, just smooth roasty malts and really big citrusy and floral hops. Hella!"
""
""
"an outstanding big black ipa that sort of straddles the line between styles. pours a gorgeous looking thick dark chocolate color with an almost nitro-tap looking head on it, all creamy and white and lasting and foamy and yummy. smells great! lots of hops synergizing with very dark roasted malts to produce an exceltionally rich bitter character that radiates in both the nose and in the flavor. there are also subtle hints of vanilla, sweet spices, and wood in the flavor. feel is awesome, thich and velvety. full bodied but sessionable, with a very well hidden 8.7% abv. in the end i dont know why i looked at this one on the shelf for so long before picking it up. i loved every drop and will almost certainly purchase this again. really really good stuff here, not like any other black india pales out there."

"O - Again, I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. Like a few reviewers have mentioned already, I think this would be a nice example of a black IPA. It has the potential of a regular IPA, yet also has a really awesome roasty flavor that compliments the hop bitterness. I've had one other black IPA from another company so far, but I feel like the roasted flavor of that beer dominated the hops. With this one though, as mentioned above, it's a perfect 50/50. Stone definitely knows what they are doing, and this one is worth a try. I will have more of these in the future for sure."

"He body is medium with adequate carbonation. A dry finish here. Overall this is one of the better offerings out there. Real enjoyable."

"Usually I suspect dark beers of adding black to make them dark. I don't have that feeling here. It numbed me so fast and had me hating that I took the last sip."

"O - This has always been a favourite. Almost flawless on tap."
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a nice and rich black with a head that lingered for a very long time. The beer had great lacing. The smell is a good balance of citrus and pine hops with a molasses like backbone. The taste of the beer is the best part, although the appearance is quite nice too. The taste is a perfect balance of dark maltiness with a nice layer of hops surrounding it on all sides. The MF is rich and creamy and very easy on the palate. This is the prime example of the black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale style. It is hoppy, malty, boozy, and ever so delicious."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip, best by 2/14/2012. Re-reviewing my first rating ever from 6/3/2010. Pours almost pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, biscuit, chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, floral, and herbal hops. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, toasted biscuit, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, herbal hop, and coffee. Nice sized smooth spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, toasted biscuit, chocolate, caramel, citrus, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of hop bitterness to roasted malt flavor for a black IPA. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and sticky mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a delicious Black IPA as expected. Big hop flavors with a great balanced malt backbone that I usually prefer in black IPAs."
""
""
"O: This has given me hope for the American black ale style – what a combination of powerful hops and even bigger roasts. It’s an interesting palate, for sure. That’s really the main thing I like about this beer – that it’s unique (as are most of Stone’s offerings) – but as far as dark, hoppy beers go, I think a stout might be a bit more satisfying for my tastes. Of course, that’s not to say that this beer doesn’t have its place. If you really want to see where this one stands out, grab something salty, garlicy, or just plain spicy and crack a bottle – the darkness will soothe your burn, and the hops will rile it up at just the right times."

"Almost pitch black with a thick, luscious tan head. Great sticking power on the head, it never went away. The smell is great, with tons of spicy hops bursting through the coffee-like malt backing. The flavor is fantastic as well, giving off tons of complex malt flavor, with those citrus-like bitter and peppery spice notes that are unique to the Amarillo. So good. Kinda snuck up on me though. One flaw: the hops could meld better into the beer."

"Mouthfeel...er...not the brewer's fault, but that presence on the bar counter, with only a thin jacket for ""cooling""...meant the beer was virtually room temperature, much too warm for any beer, never mind a black IPA. However (making imaginative adjustments for the heat), I'm giving high marks for the beer that lurks within the warmth, which is a bitter hop delight. If it had been on hand-pump, they would have needed a crowbar to prise me away."
"This beer is a black, dense, heady brew. When held to the light, it's a blackish-brown, and nearly impenetrable. The smell is fantastic...very malty, with a dark fruit and yeast scent. Vanilla, toasted wood, and stone fruit. The taste is sweet with a lot of hop bitterness. Malt forward. Soft and very drinkable. This is a great beer."
"O: A different beer, in that strong flavours and delicate touches are combined."

"Dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that recedes to an inch and is foamy. Lacing is sticky. Aroma is toasted barley, citrus, coffee, and light floral notes. Taste is of toasted barley and light bittersweet chocolate. There is a bitterness that is dark coffee mixed with grapefruit. This beer is a malt and hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium and a slight bitterness lingers. This is only my second BIPA but I think it will be one to judge others against. Very good."
""
""
""
"Ok, the nastiest beer I have had since Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. The taste is horrible. It makes me want to vomit immediately and I had to do some serious meditating to get down a few swigs. However, the bottle cap came off easily, so maybe that has something to do with it. But in my experience I noticed darker beers are not for me. This is disgusting, do not buy it!"

Great pine hop and light toasted malt aroma. Taste starts with nice pine and citrus hops then melds smoothly into a hoppy toasted malt with a hint of chocolate flavor. A fabulous flavor progression. Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess. Very nicely done and delicious."

Nice thick head in the glass, taste is medium to full bodied. Hop heads delight with some smokiness flavor coming through. Super creamy and somehow well balanced. Goes down way too easy for a 8.7% ABV. Fantastic beer, will definitely be picking this up again when I need a hop kick."

"O. C.D.A/Black I.P.A perfection. Some Dark I.P.A's tend to be overly roasted, or overly bitter. Self-Righteous lives up the name by tooting its own horn and truly displaying a well-balanced, yet assertively hopped and smokey beer. A plus."

"O: That's hops are overpowering on this one. Not a bad beer, just isn't very well balanced in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's so much going on in the taste.... It's like a good burnt, roasty German beer that fell into a giant vat of American hops. Smooth, chocolatey goodness in the center, drying, drying hop bitterness on the finish. Warm alcohol. Resiny, very West Coast, very Stone. Delicious. I will gladly spend the rest of my night sipping and exploring the intricacies of this brew. Happy New Year, peeps."

"M: Great feel, with a medium body, a controlled level of carbonation, and a dry finish."
"In the mouth, I get some warmth due to the high ABV. This is truly an excellent beer. The carbonation is perfect. So easy to drink and it is well balanced in the taste. In the aroma, it lacks a little bit, and as it warms up, I don't get more than that piney hops. Not bad, however not perfect either. Otherwise, it is perfect."

"This brew is consistent through all five categories - overwhelmingly so, in that regard, and damn great because of that. Just pitch blackness when held up to light, smells of licorice, coffee, tobacco, ...must? ... the taste follows the appearance which follows the smell...mouthfeel follows the aforementioned, just big, robust, roasty...overall just wonderful big american dark ale!"

"Notes: I´m simplifying and probably need to do a side by side taste, It reminds me quite a bit of their anniversary ale with a softer edge, not meaning that this one is short of character, quite the contrary. Regretting the times I overlooked it, that is for sure. This is a really nice brew."

"This is sort of a lesser cousin to the Stone 15th Black Ale. That said, it can't be faulted at all; it offers more drinkability than the 15th, and somewhat less of a medicinal aspect. What can I say, I love both. Stone has defined Black IPA, in all its contradiction as a term, they bring the intense hop and roasted malt together perfectly in both cases. I had the 15th when it was just a week or so old, and I have never experienced such a fresh hop blast. Again, this is similar, but less hi-test and in your face. But not much, at all. I'm glad this is becoming a regular offering. Herbal hops with a touch of a medicinal aspect, which is rare and appreciated. Kick ass brew from a kick ass brewer. Get it if you can handle it."

"Great looking Black Ale, one of the best Black IPA's I have ever had. Stone had a tap takeover at one of the local bars and this was my favorite of the 6 featured beers. It has fantastic hoppy notes with a bitter/malty finish. High alcohol content does not pull through in the flavor. I would love to enjoy this every day!"

"12 oz into a snifter...big black beer with the head of an IPA (if darker for the malt beneath it). Plenty of lacing. Tons of hops in the nose, with a dryness to them moreso than in a big paler IPA. Loads of hop bitterness on the tongue with some smoky after-tones. Cheers to Stone for making a very interesting beer in a style that doesn't come in six packs. Why aren't black IPAs more popular? At least most of the brewers who decide to make one know what they're doing. Mouthfeel is excellent and I recommend trying this beer."

"O-El Delicioso. I really dig this one. awesome for my first black ale"
"D: tasty and probably the most well-known aba. good balance and showcase of roasted malts and american hops."
"More @ http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Easy to drink, enjoyable, a little off balance."
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour rocks on! This stop pours a dark amber-/garnet- tinged black-brown topped by about a finger-and-a-half of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises lime, pine, blackened pretzel, light roasted malts, light char, orange zest, and very light coffee. The taste holds notes of pine, roasted malts, light char, light vinyl, lime peel, mint, and balsa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very solid CDA, though I think the roasted elements were left in the oven just a bit too long (or something like that, anyway). Otherwise, good stuff."
"O: Quite an excellent brew. A bit more focused and balanced than the Escondidian. I'm quite jubilant that they continued to brew this great drink."
"When you let this beer warm a bit it does make it a lot more drinkable and thus a lot more pleasurable. My recommendation is to let it warm up a bit before consuming. After it warming up a bit it was delicious beyond my expectations, but cold not no so much. Another Victory for Stone."
"Tightly bubbled tan head lingers mightily on top jet black black ale that is completely opaque. One of my very favorite beers in the nose: roast and bready malt base that supports a clean and crisp hop spice. The nose continues into the taste and matches exactly. No surprises, but maybe that's what disappoints some, but I like the roast and spice in perfect balance. Bit more roast in the taste than the nose. My wife is not a hop head at all, but likes this beer because the hops blends and compliments so well into the sweet malt roast. Incredible beer that is one of Stone's best."
"I am usually not a fan of the style but have heard good things from others that aren't fans. Pours black as night but the head shrinks fast and is a bit thin. Smell is sublime. Sweet tangy grapefruit with a touch of caramel malt and toffee. The main reason I usually don't like the style is because the chocolate malts overpower the rest but seems more into the IPA zone. The citrusy notes come through as more of an orange/lemon zest and this beast is bitter as hell! Very clean and easy drinking. I think I finally found one in this style I finally like. Carbonation is spot on as well as the downplayed alcohol although there is a touch of heat. Being only a month old probably helps too."
"Review Addition on 1/28/13: I had an 11th Anniversary bottle version of Sublimely Self Righteous and the Hop character carried surprisingly well over the last 6 years. The review is otherwise similar."
"O: Interesting and good, but not my style."
"Not a bad beer to end the night. Would definitely give it another chance."
"O: What can I say. On tap, more of a black IPA flavor and smell. In the bottle, not feeling black IPA as much, but still damn good. Like I said, either way you won't be disappointed. The beer is strong and full of flavor. It got me interested in Stone again (not a dig on Stone, they know what they're doing and produce good beers. However, its been awhile since I sought them out). Nice work!"
"great black ipa...best thing ive had from stone brewery.(its about time with all the hype)...not going to go in detail too much on this one...look good...feel was great...smell hits your nose hard with a smooth finish on the palet...you gotta try it for yourself...caution---hop heads only...(and maybe some stout lovers)"
"I’m digging this from the get-go. What a surprise—a hoppy, dark beer… Funny thing is, I knew what I was getting into (a Cascadian IPA) because I’ve had this beer before—when it was called Stone 11—but the hop aroma still took me off guard. The beer itself pours a lot like a foamy cola. It’s dark dark dark brown, with a good half-inch of loose, bubbly foam lingering atop after a few minutes and a vigorous pour. Think pine more than citrus, with just a hint of dark roasted malt on the nose. Some grapefruit. Smells wonderful. Tastes fantastic, surprisingly full-bodied but not heavy (and distinct enough for me to not raise my ever-present questions about the black IPA style’s similarities to a hoppy porter). Bit of a resiny chew to this, enough to let the flavors linger but not to the point where I find it disagreeable. Hops mix with a little roast in a wonderfully delicious combination."
"This is a really good beer! The unique name fits it's character. Stone Brewery strikes again! Deep/Rich in color, perfect exagerrated biterness, small head, but heavy lacing, malty and all around well balanced. Two of these you will be alright! lol. (Don't Drive)"
"poured the bomber into a pint glass very freely.which resulted in a two finger mocha colored head that dies down rather quickly but leaves tons of lacing behind. taste and smell are one in the same with this beer. both consist of roasted malts, pine and citrus hops. the only difference between the two is that the nose would suggest tons of bitterness from the hops, however the roastieness from the malts balance this one out. mouthfeel was not what i expected. there is a nice smooth creamyness to this that was unexpected. but there was a slight bitter dryness that reminded me this was a stone ale not a porter."
"O - Can't say enough. Get this one if you (still) haven't had it."
"Mouthfeel is good, very dry, very creamy. Even though its not my favourite type of beer, I really appreciate it. Overall its very well done."
"Creamy and full on the palate, and it leaves a sticky resinous film after the finish. A little bit of warmth as the beer approaches room temperature, too. I like this one a lot. Very happy this wasn't a 1-and-done but instead is now a standard offering."
"22 oz bomber poured in pint glass: burnt malt aroma, resin, chocolate, citrus; pitch black, with frothy brown head and good lacing; very bitter, medium sourness, like pineapple and grapefruit with some syrup; full body, creamy, sticky, soft carbonation, bitter, long finish, maybe the finest brew I’ve had."
"Overall it is a great beer, I am impressed."
"O - Black IPA's are a nice change of pace for me. This is the best one I've tried to date."
"Appearance is a very dark brown with a frothy head. Very nice lacing. Really interesting powerful and complex aroma. Has hints of pine, flower petals, figs, and a smokiness. The flavor is excellent, with the hop and fig flavor dominating, toffee/chocolate and something similar to a porter or rauchbier in the background. Not overpowering in the hop, body, or alcohol depts. Highly recommended! I am liking this black IPA style more and more."
"This is worth seeking out if you feel worthy."
"O - This is one of the best beers I have ever tried. Excellent contexture! well balanced flavors. Smoky, caramelly, coffe, and chocolaty.!! :)"
"O: I'm not sure how I feel about black IPA's yet as I haven't tried many, but this is a decent offering and probably the best I have tried so far from this style."
"O - Not bad. I wish the malts came through a little more and the flavors don't hold up very well in the finish, but a grew brew for sure."
"crossposted on http://booksbitesbrews.blogspot.com"
"Overall a decent offering and a good beer on a fresh Autumn evening."
"Dr: Incredibly drinkable for the ABV - which itself is cleverly hidden. It's priced right (at least in California) and though it lacks complexity, I'd certainly have it again, particularly if I found it on draught. A nice offering from Stone that every beer fanatic should try."
"I rated it a bit loer than I should have, maybe, judging it as what I really wanted, which was an AIPA, but is it one I that would happily repeat. I am looking forward to finishing the large (and expensive) bottle."
"O: I have always found this beer to be like a roasted, more alcoholic arrogant bastard. I enjoy it every once in a while, but it’s not in my regular rotation like many other stone offerings. It is a really interesting beer to me though. The hop bitterness and roasted malt interaction is cool. I don’t find the beer as bitter as the IBUs testify. I wonder if this beer is best fresh. I wonder if aging this in oak barrels would be beneficial in bringing out some flavor. I definitely find it too heavy on the alcohol in scent and taste."
"O: For real Stone, I am so glad that it was you who popped my craft beer cherry. If you haven't yet had this Black Ale than I suggest you go out and get one, truly remarkable."
"O: Lots of flavor and a high dosage of hops are sure to make this a pleaser. Very enjoyable on tap or in the bottle, though I would say on tap the hops come out a bit more and it tasted a lot more fresh and poignant. Very enjoyable, but I don't think I could drink more than one as it fills you up quickly. If you like dark, roasted brews and are a fan of hops, this one is for you. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a very much quality brew from a style that I do like. Great hop profile that drives a great dry, yet malty, brew. It has a right to be self-righteous. It may in fact be sublime. All I know is that if I'm browsing at my local craft beer store (Four Firkins), and I see fresh Self-Righteous, I'll be hard-pressed not to grab it. Cheers!"
"O - One of my personal favorites, never gets old, and arguably one of Stone's finest. The perfect balance of malt and hops. The name says it all. Do yourself a favor and add this one to your list."
"Very deep brown, near black, 2 fingers of tan head, good lace left behind. Smell is very hoppy, lots of citrus, grapefruit, pine, malty, some roasted qualities, bittersweet chocolate notes. Taste is fairly roasted, coffee, bakers chocolate, nice hop presence, some alcohol points, citrus in aftertaste, long roasted finish. Lightish mouthfeel, med body, medium carbonation. Well balanced and enjoyable, very nice black ale, hits the mark for me."
"Awesome to drink, it has that signature Stone hoppiness that I just can't get enough of. The darker chocolate and coffee notes really finish it nicely. I wonder how similar this will be to the black IPA that Stone is just putting out now."
"Gotta love the commentary on the back of the bottle, especially the third paragraph!"
"Overall, yet another beautiful american beer, a twist to the direction usually perceived by me from Stone (and certainly its most original and tasty one). I never cease to be amazed with the brews of the states."
"O - Probably my favorite example of the style. Another well done beer done by stone. I think one bomber of this will hit the spot nicely. This one had been in my fridge for about a month so may have lost a little of that hop bite Stone is so well known for."
"This beer is a big hop bomb that has a sweet, slightly roasty balance. The hop aroma and kick are fantastic like most Stone beers."
"o - overall, a good black ipa/ale with the bitterness i'd expect from stone. worth checking out for sure."
"Overall. Great stuff. I'll be watching out for this one again."
"Overall, this beer is excellent! As an IPA lover who is trying to branch out into some of the darker brews, this is the perfect gateway beer!"
"Yes, this is a ""hybrid"" style that really works. And I expect I'll be adding it to my lineup of regular ""go-to"" brews. Well done Stone!"
"D ~ From what I have had of the style, this is pretty much the hallmark. It's not just an IPA with a dash of Specialty malts, it's a BLACK IPA. Like the Belgian IPA, it is a peculiar style, but Stone executed it as if they'd invented it."
"Overall this was a really good beer, wouldn't expect anything less from Stone. Wish it stood apart from the double bastard a little more though."
"Overall- the has a very overpowering hop taste. which made it hard for me to taste everything else. It is a good beer overall."
"Cheers!"
"A nice bitter finish ends a truly delightful beer. Will definitely purchase again whenever I get a chance."
"O: One of a handful of Black Ales that I've tried; very good. Seamless merging of hops, malt, and sweeter chocolate and caramel tones. A must try."
"When I'm in the mood for the style, this would be a, ""go to brew"". Very nice, one is good for a sitting though."
"D/O: Certain beers, due either to timing or to mastery, have taken on the role of archetypal example of their style: certainly Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the archetypal American-brewed pale ale, and within its distribution range Alaskan Amber will always be the defining American-brewed alt. Sublimely Self-Righteous (SSR) ale by Stone defined the archetype of the black DIPA--which is, I think, an important distinction to make from the black IPA. While the style has been popping up here and there and everywhere with ever-increasing frequency, this beer was very accessible within Stone's distribution range before most breweries had even discovered black IPAs or DIPAs. More hop-focused than some, it is interesting in the way that its hop profile puts it closer to Double Bastard than to the Russian imperial stout. It is worth returning to occasionally, even if it isn't your favorite black DIPA--after all, it set the mark to which all others are measured against."
"Have had this brew many times and the consistency amazes me always the same. The beer pours black like a stout with a great lasting head. The smell is a hop explosion like an IPA with a tad of sweetness some roastyness and a mild smoke character. Taste is absolutly what a black IPA should be and the best I've had in the style. I can taste candied hops perfect roasted malt flavors and the best part is the coffee taste is minimal. Will continuously go to this beer to get my fix of dark malt as its excellent and easy to get."
"O: This beer grows on you -- I like it. Less coffee as time goes on...actually, maybe not. Consummately crafted; great beer. Restores my faith in Stone."
"overall, fantastic beer, lives up to the hype too, i could have this stuff all the time"
"Overall, this is a surprisingly dark ale, replete with delicious bread and toasted nut/malt flavors, and begging to be sipped quietly in front of a roaring fire. Only a slight alcohol tinge--a result of the 8.7% ABV--mars what is otherwise an excellent beer. But even then, the alcohol is excusable and warming, much like a whiskey or cognac."
"O - gotta say this is one of my favorite styles and this is no exception. I've heard some complaints about chalky mouthfeel with this style - that's what makes it great. The bitter and resinous hops hang on the tongue for an eternity. Great example of the style."
"Thank you for another great beer to review, Stone."
"O: A great beer, wish Stone would distribute locally. Meanwhile, road trips can bring it home. Delicious stuff."
"O - A perfectly drinkable black ale for a warm evening insofar as it offers the great combination of roasted flavor, but the drinkability of a hoppy IPA."
"Overall - I found this a damn good brew. It was my first black ale and I was certainly impressed."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprising mouthfeel and the great balance. The first thing noticed at the very first sip was how soft the feel was. For this style it is easy to produce a watery beer with little substance, but they seemed to retain a good deal of body, after which the hops were added as a secondary feature. This made for a nice balance, which allowed for no component to really obtrude the other."
"BTW, this beer tastes uncommonly good with peanuts!"
"This beer is amazing. Looks like a stout. Tastes like an IPA..You have to try it."
"O-Of the Black IPA's that I've tried, this now tops my list (knocking 21st Amendment's 'Back In Black' to second fiddle). If you like, or are interested in this style of beer, look no further. Let this one warm, as this is a complex concoction that should be enjoyed at (or above) cellar temperatures to elicit all of the flavors."
"O- I like this beer a lot. Has a very unique profile that leaves your mouth wanting more of the bitterness."
"O: Overall this is a decent beer. I would buy it again but am not thinking I would ever crave this beer and have to have it now."
"Big hop slap in the mouth - bitter domination. Pine leads the way and outshines all else. It is followed by some bitter grapefruit. It gets slightly biscuity towards the end, but not enough to add any sweetness - this beer is all bitter & hoppy, but it is good, damn good."
"Overall: I'm giving this a 4.5 right now, mainly because I drank it thinking it was going to be hoppy, and that it was at least 90 degrees in my kitchen. This would be an AMAZING late fall or winter beer, but mid-July? I'll stick to my IPAs and keep this cellared for a few months."
"A really nice Black Ale. Lots of flavour with a great hoppiness. Solid."
"A great example of a Black IPA, well worth drinking if you ever have the chance to."
"Purchased at Total Wine & More for $6.99 - which is a solid price I think. I may revisit this one a while from now."
"Coal black and a nice head with excellent lacing. Smell is toasty malt with some espresso. taste is of roasty malts with some sweetness and a hop bitterness. Coffee, dark fruit, oak, astringency, juniper, grapefruit. This is a unique and complex ale that drinks like a combination of styles. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick and sticky with good carbonation. Aftertaste is clean and bitter. Seems like a black IPA. Taste comes off as extremely bitter to me. I'm gonna have to come back to this later."
"Overall, one of the standout examples of the nebulous black IPA style – which makes sense, as it was one of the first."
"Overall Impression- And Stone just keeps em coming! Great black ale and will be enjoying this one again VERY soon. It almost reminds me of a Black IPA but not hoppy enough for this style. Great price for this beer as well."
"This was an excellent beer and I definitely plan to revisit."
"This beer has a nice look, its mostly black with some dark brown edges where the light gets through with a brown head which leaves good lazing and has good retention. The hops are the strongest smell with the roasted malts and some alcohol smells. This has a medium thickness. The taste is mostly of bitter hops, to a lesser extent there are some roasted malts and a molasses taste, but they are overpowered by the hops. Overall an excellent beer and one I'll continue to buy again, but from the few American Black Ales I've tried, I actually prefer Hop in the Dark to this one, I think its better balanced between being very hoppy and having flavorful roasted malts, still this is a great beer."
"Final thought - not an everyday, but as aggressive this beer is and at almost 9% this one should be had every month. if you haven't had it on tap, get ready for a taste bud chubby"
"A decent two finger creamy tan head, not a lot of lacing present. Midnight black, completely solid. Smelled roasty, with chocolate and fruit. Creamy mouthfeel, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, dried fruit, dates. Bitterness lingers. Smooth and creamy, with low to medium carbonation."
"O- Overall, this is a very tasty offering from Stone. The hops and roasted malt characteristics are expertly melded into a very enjoyable interpretation of the American Black Ale style. Recommended."
"Stone's take on a black ale, should be good. The body is black yet still translucent, good cream-colored head. Roasty, sweet malts, molasses and fruity hops fill in the nose. Chewy molasses and dark roasted malt flavors, espresso and fig also present. As with most beer I have had from this brewery; the hops don't disappoint.This is a high-test, well made beer, it is seeing a black ale through the lens of a skillful west-coast brewer. Very, very good."
"Sorry not much flowery description here just my impressions on a beer that sets a certain standard for others like it."
"Pours a thick three finger slightly tan head. Lacing coats the side of the glass and the beer itself is nearly pitch black with a tint of red when held up to the light. The initial smell is of hops and roasted malts, but as it warms a more piney hop character and some tropical fruit are evident. A touch of alcohol present on the nose as well. The taste is hopy, with just a touch of roasted malt and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall one of my favorite black ales. Would love to see this in 4 or 6 packs."
"Great offering from Stone. Such a nice beer to sip on. This will be a go to for me in the future if I really want a good mix of hop and malt that you can really focus on either flavor and enjoy it all."
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation, drinks fairly well, likely due to its appearance tricking me into expecting a big heavy RIS. This leans more toward the IPA end of the spectrum based on what I've sampled of the style thus far. A great option for hop heads looking for a bit of a change of pace."
"Drinking this beer as well as it's aftertaste you kinda get the feeling with it's milkiness that you are drinking a melted candy bar. I feel that I've taken a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bar and melted it in Stone Smoked Porter swirled it around and drank it down."
"Poured into a pint glass a coffee brown with a nice, foamy, beige head that retained and laced decently. I really love this style of beer. Dark malts and dark fruits in the aroma, but a definite citrus hop presence like you'd get from your typical IPA. Smooth dark malts in the taste, molasses, brown sugar, quickly overcome by lots of citrusy hops, though the maltiness lingers on in the background. Flavorful and medium-bodied. Another highly drinkable beer from the consistently excellent Stone Brewing Co."
"D - Another great beer from Stone. Not an overally complex beer, but it goes down pretty smooth and if you like a chocolate profile you'll like this one."
"This beer pours dark dark brown with a decent off white head. The smell is hops up from floral and piney with a burnt malt finish. The flavor is pretty close to the smell with the hops coming out first followed by the roasted burnt malt flavor. The beer is very dry with no residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is light bodied wig good carbonation and a bitterness feel on the side of you tongue. Overall it's a good beer worth trying at least once"
"Poured a 3"" off-white head which was slow to recede. Dark walnut brown in color, and clear I think though it's so dark it's hard to tell. Smell is strong on hops and citrus and I'd agree grapefruit seems dominant. Taste matches the smell but includes quite a bitter finish. As is often the case with Stone this is a big bold beer with no shyness on hops. They're all great, but I do think most are just slight deviations from each other or from a central big beer concept by Stone."
"22oz bottle, served in a tulip glass. Pours a completely opaque black with a light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel and roasted malt, alcohol, grapefruit and grassy hops. Flavor is sweet caramel and roasted malt, grassy hops, grapefruit, pineapple, raisins, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, warming, and a fairly bitter finish. Good beer, decent balance."
"Big off-white head that leaves a lot of lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is mostly of grapefruit from the hops, with a little of the dark roasty malts shining through. Tastes like a schwarzbier with an abundance of American hops and a big bitter component. I'll definitely buy this one again when I see it."
"Narrative: “AND STAY OUT OF MY ROOM!” Becca, or GWENDOLINE as she preferred to be called in her adolescent epoch, slammed the door of her room. The Twilight posters swelled with a gush of incoming air and tusseled her Junior High School diploma on the wall. “They don’t understand my depth, and just because I leave my leather bound poetry book out doesn’t meant that she can JUST READ IT!” she fumed to herself. She had a bitter and dark note inside of herself, but she tried relentlessly to present herself in a comprehensible manner. Her acoustic guitar collected dust in the corner, next to an unfinished paint canvas, just beside her various competition dance uniforms; the items formed a confusing strata of personality layers ever weathering, ever changing. Ultimately, her interpretive dance classes would alienate school and performer alike but, she would maintain her bitter cold dignity with calm poise."
"O: a very good beer that is a pleasure to drink."
"This excellent beer will appeal to hop-heads (like me) as well as those who like big, complex flavors. Although I prefer the standard IPAs to this variety, I still found this beer to be quite tasty. I would NOT suggest this beer to someone new to craft brews."
"O: Another amazing brew from what I consider the best brewery in the world. This sets the bar as to what a damn near perfect ABA should be. And it's easy to get. What more can you ask?"
"d- very good, really exceeds expectations. i would drink this again."
"On tap this stuff is outstanding, just as it is in bottles."
"I don't always drink Black IPA's, but when I do, I make it a Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale."
"O: Overall it is a nice dark hop that is always good to just chill to."
"I've had a few black ales before but this one is BLACK, maybe just a hint of amber around the edges where the light comes through. Pours with a fluffy three finger head that recedes slowly throughout the glass. The aroma is great, a ton of roasty malt up front with some hops hiding behind it. There's a lot going on in the flavor as well, where the hops take over a little bit more and there is a hint of sweetness as well. Very smooth on the mouthfeel, with a little bite of carb and bitters on the aftertaste. I think this is a great example of the style, and one of the best from Stone"
"Pours a very deep mahogany, almost black with about a half inch foMy dark tan head. Lacing retIns well and appears smooth. Aroma is of charred nuts, raisins, hops, slightly oaky and maybe a hint if smoke. Mouthfeel is of a medium body. Taste is of all the aromas, but more earthy and almost grassy. Excellent beer."
"O - If this is representative of the style then I'm hooked. The name of this beer says it all. Stone has never let me down and I doubt it ever will. Buy this beer and drink it NOW."
"8.7abv. Enjoy slow and steady."
"O- This is one of my favorite Stone beers so far. Very unique, very smooth, and very enjoyable. If you haven't had it yet- go pick some up, it's definitely one I'll get again and again."
"Color is a rich, ruby black. Seems a bit thin on the tongue at first but really rolls off nicely. A nice head to start with good lacing as I work down the glass. I could really drink a lot of this on a hot summer day. That's where the bitterness really pays off!"
"Fell in love with this one the second I opened the bottle. The beer poured out as a dark black color with a generous brown head on top. The lacing looked pretty impressive as well. The smell of the beer was fully loaded with citrusy hops and roasted malts. The taste was a collision of the two battling it out. The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Overall it's a wonderful beer, I strongly recommend it!"
"O: This beer is deceiving in that judging by its appearance you would expect a more stout-like drink with a certain heaviness and stronger malt characters. But in reality its more or less a great, hop-heavy ,IPA that happens to look like a stout. Overall this is an excellent beer. I admittedly am not that familiar with black IPAs, but I can’t imagine one being much better than this. I recommend this beer to all those who love hops and to those who are interested in this beer style. I will certainly drink this beer again."
"overall extremely good. surprisingly not malty for how dark it is. extremely good hoppy flavor."
"Overall: ranking it on its style I guess you can say Sublimely hits all the marks, but in reality this is a style that doesn't do much more than market American IPA's. So it plays a Mindfu**k, I'm not finding a palatable reason to get this beer again, or sponsor this style."
"Overall: Very good black ale or black ipa or whatever the hell stone wants to call this thing. Bottom line is that it is a good beer that I will drink again when in the mood for a stone brew and I have no RIS around"
"I chose one of the most influential beers as my 20th review. This beer really opened my eyes a year ago. Poured a 22 oz bomber into my 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a gorgeous black, with a 3 inch light tan head. Crazy amount of lacing. Smell is heavenly. Piney, citrusy hops, with a hints of chocolate. It is amazing that they work so well with each other. The taste is similar, with some burnt malts & a hint of booze in the finish. Has a fairly thick body for such a easy drinking high abv beer. Plenty of carbonation. This is an amazing beer and did the same for black IPAs as Nirvana did for grundge music."
"O - I really enjoyed this one and it gave me hope for the style. I'd definitely get this again."
"O: The best black IPA I've had, definitely hop-forward with roasted/coffee notes underneath which is how I would prefer a black IPA."
"O- Very drinkable, much closer to a stout at this point. Its a completely different beer than a fresh selfrighteous."
"A little more dynamic, but mostly just more powerful on tap and still a good example of this style. Can't go wrong with it at all."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Duvel tulip. This brew pours a near black and creates a huge foamy light tan head that last forever and leaves tons of lacing. Aromas of bitter hops,pine and citrus fruits,particularly grapefruit greet the nose. First sip reveals a surprising roasted malt character that is nicely balanced by bitter hops. Also hints of bitter coffee,chocolate and more citrus. This beer has a very usual flavor profile but the flavors work together amazingly well. Mouthfeel and carbonation are medium and there is a definite creamy quality to this beer. The finish is long and quite bitter and any hint of alcohol taste has been completely masked. This is a very interesting brew which manages to blend flavors you would not think would go together,and does so very well. An interesting ale I would gladly enjoy again. "
"O - Not being as devout of a hophead, I went after this Stone offering first. I'm sure pleased that I did. What a great mix of flavors in this complex brew. Will have another in the future."
"Tremendous, a privilege to have tasted and enjoyed. I gave this a good go for a dozen pints/bomber bottles soon after it was introduced."
"This is an excellent American Black Ale."
"Drink- This was such a welcome extra and completely unexpected. I will have to have the SSR to compare recipes. If I had access to more 11, I'd be happy."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one, this is a new style for me that I am really enjoying, out of the few stones that I've tried this is my favorite so far."
"Overall: While not as impressive as the bottled version, this is still a beautiful black ale. Smooth, drinkable (almost chuggable). Enjoyable. Subtly and roasty... well done, but perhaps I expect more from Stone."
" I got to experience this brew at the 11th Anniv. release before I had ever even heard of the Black IPA or Cascadian Style Dark Ale. I was immediately taken by the hoppiness and that great balance or marriage of dark roasty malts here. Glad they decided to make it a regular. One of my fav Stone offerings so far."
"Finish: Long and full of flavor. Very complex and explosive as well. you get the coffee and sweet malt balanced by the bite of the hop."
"Finding this beer fresh is recommended. Great Job with this one Stone!"
"Once I cracked this open, an aroma that made me smile filled the air. Pours a thin black that turns cola color in the light around the edges. Small head but some even lacing. Smell is bitter but not of hops, initially. Slightly burnt grainy malts and molasses lead into some earthy hops, grass, spruce and citrus peel. Taste is so weird, in a good way. Jumps back and forth from malts to hops to malts to hops and back. After is sits a bit, the finish is a nice roasted coffee bean flavor. A bigger beer at 8.7%, but this is pretty thin and very easy to consume. Alcohol is hidden behind all the changing pieces as it doesn't know what to be. One drink a malt beer, next is IPA. Excellent beer from Stone, should we be surprised."
"Overall - This is probably my favorite Stone brew to date. It's got depth and the profile holds up against most ales. If you see this, buy it, smile, and then don't forget to smile while you savor the flavor of this behemoth."
"O: I can see why this one is among the best. Not my favorite ABA, but I would argue better crafted than my favorite ABA (mad River Serious Madness). This one is easily had, year around, has the best body I've had in the style, and comes from a reputable brewery with their eyes on QA."
"To say that I’ve been looking forward to this beer is an understatement. One of my buddies happened to pick this up in Denver last year but he of course didn’t share. 22 ounce bomber poured into an oversized wine goblet. Comes out of the bottle dark brown (think cola) with a frothy long lasting tan head. Wish the head was a bit thicker, but the high ABV probably makes that difficult. Aroma comes across as this dank and earthy hop character, with big notes of pine. It’s huge! Roasted grain and chocolate are buried in the nose. You have to work your way past the incredible hop aroma but they’re in there. Then there’s the whole matter of taste. Hops shatter the palate first, with a prolonged bitterness in the finish. The first taste is all hops. As you acclimate you’ll be able to start to pick at the malt profile a bit more, but the first taste is jarring. I like the mouthfeel as well. It’s slick and despite all the hops never gets sticky. This beer finishes very dry (something I’ve noticed with most Stone beers), as the malt character never goes overboard into sweet territory. Instead it opts for roasted and nutty, with a slight bitter coffee note. That’s not the best description. Let me put it this way I’ve toasted pine nuts, getting them to the point where they’re almost too dark, and that’s what this malt flavor reminds me of. It’s not burnt, but is right there on the edge. There’s also some definite alcohol warmth but I’m not picking up any fusels in the nose or taste, very impressive. It’s not often that I find a beer that lives up to my expectations when trying it, but Sublimely Self-Righteous does that and then some. Not sure if it’s possible, but this is a textbook example of an emerging style."
"D - This was a crowd pleaser in our clan, all the beer geeks really enjoyed this brew."
"22oz bottle. Pours a virtually black color with a 1/2 inch of brown head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is chocolatey and boozey. Some coffee and only a bit of hops. Taste is of piney and floral hops. Maybe some chocolate and coffee flavors but they are certainly in the background. The hops are the main focus here. This one smelled boozey but taste wise there isn't a lot of alcohol flavor. This is a pretty solid beer and certainly does taste like a Stone. Overall, I dig it and will grab it again."
"It wasn't the best beer I'd had. Not interesting enough to justify the high Alcohol by volume and too strong to drink as a refresher."
"D: This is one of the best ales I've had in a long time. Drink it! It goes down wonderfully."
"This is a nicely hopped Black IPA. The toasted malt taste does just enough to offset the hops. Watch that 8.7 ABV."
"Overall a great dark ipa, and another great job by stone. If you like dark hoppy beers you could do a lot worse then this one."
"Pours a watery-black color with a hint of caramel color. Smell is typical Stone hops with sweet-tangy citrus. The taste is bitter hops upfront with a vast array of floral. Blended flowers is the best way to describe it, but it totally works. Another great beer by a great brewery. Go out and get this."
"I can count the black ales I've had on one hand, and one of those was my own homebrew (from before I realized the style existed already). SSR is the first I've had that distinguished itself by what it wasn't: it's not just fistfulls of IPA style hops + roasted malts. There's actually a 3rd character element here, as if it's a step in the style's evolution. Me likes..."
" A MUST!"
"Another horrible offering from this company. They have one more chance with me. Their RIS. Hopefully that is good. As it stands right now if Stone was giving me free beer I wouldn't bother drinking any of it."
"MF/DK: Medium bodied and light=medium to medium bodied. A bit of spiciness from the alcohol and a long lingering astringency from the alcohol. Fair, but not one I'll be tapping again soon."
"Overall, this is good no doubt, but personally I'd opt for a good ol' Stone IPA with a touch more brightness. Maybe this is more of a wintertime brew for me cuz the darkness is vast, oppressive and soul-crushing. It's something that can come from no one but Stone."
"A very good beer, you should try it!"
"delicious if you like big beers! a must if you appreciate stones other offerings."
"O-This is a truly exceptional brew and a definite repeater!"
"Overall, a well-balanced ale with lots of interesting subtleties that indulged all of the senses. I will definitely be looking for this one again."
"C at best, had I been at home... This one would have ended as a drain pour."
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with a slightly above-average carbonation level. This goes down easily, even though it's definitely not a beer you can drink fast. Overall, this is an impressive brew. Glad I picked it up, something I'll have to pickup again soon."
"This is a complex and excellent example of this new style. Not the best I've had, but certainly an appropriate and enjoyable example that I would have again."
"A very nice CDA. The nose reveals a touch of burnt malt along with a heartier serving of roast and a ton of pine needle and grapefruit hop aromas. Fresh, bold and inviting. Taste is more of the same. A touch less chocolate and a touch more roast would send it to the top of the class, but that’s nitpicking; this is a damned fine brew. Crazy fresh hop flavor with a fair amount of bitterness. Medium bodied with a dryish finish that brings the roast back into play. Alarmingly drinkable at this ABV; indeed, the booze is barely noticeable. Without ready access to my PNW favorites, this is my go-to for the CDA style."
"This is definately a beer ive been looking forwards to sample about time we see these good brews in Australia and it pours a lucious dark kola hue that lets no light in with decent carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that stays and leaves sporadic clingy lacing,it has a nice medium bodied perfectly carbonated mouthfeel which feels ultra smooth and leaves you with tastes of piney hops,boiled candy,mandarin,mocha,a light tinge of caramel,piney hops,bitter milky coffee and on finish suprisingly the bitterness is subdued by the sweet dark malt character and overall a truly beautiful drop which really shows how an ABA should be balanced like."
"Overall/notes - Really good beer. Don’t have much of a comparison as its my first black ale, but I can say that it’s fairly enjoyable. The strongest suit is its balance"
"If you're a hop head, this is for you. Really strong hop presence and bitter. Well done."
"I experience this as a sipping brew: a beer to enjoy with time and conversation, something that warms with time, and actually improves upon it's initial taste. Strong across the board. The only thing that precludes a very high rating is it's fragrance, and that's perhaps the most subjective of the categories."
"Warming with a medium-to-full body. A somewhat sharp effervescence that fades quickly and a dry finish to end with. A good beer, quite enjoyable. It appears ""black ale"" means Dark IPA. Fine with me but a bit of notice, eh?"
"O - One of the best beers I have had this year so far. Fantastic brew."
"O: Awesome glorious dark sexy hoperfection."
"In a blind taste test I doubt I could identify it as a black ale and not an IPA. What's the point then?"
"Overall, there's lots to like about this. It looks good and tastes good. It's got good alcohol, but nothing is offensive."
"An interesting beer. I really don't care much for IPAs, so scored this one a bit lower than I might have otherwise. Still, this is a very complex beer, which scores points with me. There is a lot going on here, the only thing keeping me from really loving this is the high hops content. If you are a fan of hops, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This beer is so much better on tap than in the bottle."
"I can sit down with a bomber of SSRA, but if I'm in a mood for a black IPA, I'll do some scouting for a bit of a better representation."
"Overall this may overtake my favorite american black ale."
"This is one of my go to beers; it's powerful and unique and bursting with flavor. Hard to have anything else after one of these."
"A very flavorful and interesting black ale. Hops have a strong presence, but do not completely dominate the dark malt grain. Very nice."
"pretty good black IPA, stone certainly knows how to do hops right."
"Well its Monday...what the hell....why not have a Self-Righteous Ale!?!?!? This beer has awesome complexity....that I would argue gave birth to a whole new line of craft beers....the Black IPAs, etc. This beer is very dark with ecru foamy head. The nose screams hops like an IPA. The taste is a wonderment that begins like an IPA, but finishes with a roasty malt character. The mouthfeel is decent, but the ABV can be tough to start. I could probably handle two stingers (22oz) fairly easily, but after that someone would have to carry me home."
"Finish: Bitter hops with subtle malty sweetness and a hint of heat"
"O: Complex flavors with a good feel. Nice beer for those who like their hops flavors and aromas."
"This might rate as one of my favorite Stone beers. An extremely well done Black IPA..wish the price was a little lower because this drinks nicely as a session beer rather than a sipper..."
"This beer was a bit of a surprise for me. Didn't know what to expect, but the dark color without a ton of malt flavor, and the strong citrus hop presence, are just right for a black IPA. Quite tasty, better balanced than many beers like it, and one I'm quite likely to drink again."
"Absolutely worth a try and highly recommended."
"Score: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 3/5; Overall 4/5"
"Pours dark brown and has a noticeable smell oh hops and grain. I'd think this was a DIPA based on smell and taste. The finish had more of a whiskey-like burn. On one hand this is a very hoppy black ale and has a good blend of hops to go with a sweet, malty flavor profile. But while I like it, I'm not as in love with it as most. It seemed a little too strong on the back end. this is still a very good option form Stone."
"Pours a pretty nice one and a half finger head, which is a light brown color. There are some big bubbles and some small creamy bubbles. The body is black with hints of dark brown here and there, especially when held up to the light. The head is still there, but not as much as I would like it to be. Overall this looks pretty good. The smell on this is really surprising to me, it doesn't really smell like a black ale, it smells like a black IPA or maybe ever a regular IPA, the hops are just phenomenal for it being a black beer. I really don't detect too much malt either, maybe a little bit, but not much. It's mostly just the hops on the smell, I do get a small indication of the high alcohol on the smell. Overall it smells pretty good, not too complicated, but it smells good and powerful! Taste is really good, huge hops in the front end, and a little malt in the finish, not too much alcohol noticeable in this one, which is nice. The mouthfeel is a little light, which is ok for the style, but I do like my beer thicker. It's a very well done beer, which is expected from Stone, but just like the smoked porter, it's not that complicated or unique. If you wanted to look up in the dictionary what a good beer should be, you should (I don't know if you would, but you should) find this beer listed. On the other hand if you looked for creative beers in the dictionary this would be no where to be found. Maybe my opinion is a little biased because I recently had their scotch ale and it was super complex, who knows. We will see if there are any other flavors that come out as the beer warms, but for now, I will leave it as this: great beer, not complex."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of pine resin, grapefruit, and roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma with a sharp bitterness that hides most of the malt character. There is also a harsh alcohol heat in the finish that is unpleasant. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"This is a tasty beverage that can act as a good introduction to this relatively young style. The fact that it is available in most states surely helps. I would pick up a bottle if interested, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to obtain one if it isn't sitting on the shelves of your local store."
"Overall a very solid beer. Not quite as good as Arrogant Bastard but a nice change in pace."
"Overall: An interesting beer that seems like a mix of an ipa and porter."
"Overall: This is a style that I really like when it strikes the proper balance between roasted malts and citrusy hops. This one just misses that balance, but is very good nevertheless."
"I finally get to try Stone's 11th Anniversary/SSRA since they came to Minnesota. Very good beer, very hoppy but not bruisingly bitter. Glad to finally get to try this one."
"Overall, I'm trying to wrap my mind around all these new American Black Ales that need popping up on the market. I like stouts. I like IPAs. I'm still not sure how much I like this style though. If more American Black Ales were as good as this one, I could see myself coming around quickly."
"Overall I must say this is fantastic beer, that I am able to purchase whenever I want. Lucky Me!!"
"O - I rarely have this beer because I don't see it around all that often, but I walked into the store the other day and it was just sitting in plain sight, so I had to grab one. Glad I did. Stone is consistent and they handle hops better than most. This is one of the few hoppy black ales I've had that I think is more than just someone jumping on the bus."
"O: Great beer. Easy to drink! Definitely for CDA lovers!"
"Overall-LOVE IT!!!Its brand new to st cloud,mn and getting a good positive reaction!!!"
"Overall the stickiness and resiny qualities dominate the mouthfeel and linger far too long for such a dark beer. I have had good, bad and average Black Ales. Unfortunately this is in the bad dept because the hops are just too dominating."
"Drinkability: I could have a couple over a long night. I like the nice deep charred malt and pine--my favorite ipa flavor. One of the better in style, yet I think I would reach for others in style first."
"O: This is an awesome beer. A powerful hopsicle that offers just a brief respite in a caramel, toffee, malt middle and only continues along the road to palate ruination a la hops."
"-Cheers"
"Terrific brew."
"Beergoggles noted regarding the text on the bottle, ""blah, blah, blah get on with it""."
"The brews pretty ""clear"" in that theres lots of hues that can come through, but its a black body. Big tan head still all over the place. A bit of malt on the scent, but its dominated by a massive hop profile. As Alvey at Four Firkins said when he described it, the beer will mess with your head. Its a hop bomb, but it looks like a malt monster. There are nice sweet malts, but the hop oil is what this is about. Much thinner bodied than a stout/porter. Cool beer, very interesting."
"Notes: SSRA is a treat by any means. It's medium body and robust flavor, along with a creamy mouthfeel make it a beer that is not only very tasty, but extremely fun to quaff. Well done! I will be buying this one many times over."
"HV"
"Really supreme beer. I don't even like this style but somehow they melded flavors so well here that I'm really diggin drinking this."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The aftertaste is what I love about IPAs: grapefruit, pine, and pineapple. I really like this beer a lot, and this is the first American Black Ale that I have been a real big fan of. Way to go Stone, and welcome to Minnesota!!!"
"Goodbye."
"This is very drikable beer that suprised me from the way it looks and catagorized.? One of my favorites from STONE. A slightly sweet Double IPA that lives up to the score."
"A multitude of hop flavors with good black malts behind it. This is on the edge of being unbalanced on the hops side but the malt comes through just enough."
"My only complaint is that this is a strong beer at 8.7%, and I can't drink much more than half a bomber before I need to switch to something else. Still is something I'd recommend anyone to try out."
"EDIT: I started drinking this one too cold. It was a bit more bitter/hoppy than I expected. After warming it a solid 10-15 minutes in the glass, it became much smoother, the flavors really came alive with that chocolate/nutty background with a smooth but strong hops flavor I adore. At 45 minutes in, finishing the last third of the 22oz bomber, it was simply phenomenal. I changed my score above to a 9 based on this."
"Liquid amazement is what I would have to call this. Save for the aroma being a little on the burnt side, this black IPA is incredible. Smooth and thick, this beer brings an awful lot to the table. High on the bitters throughout the mouth-feel, its smoky, mellow aftertaste makes you completely forget that. This is definitely a beer that balances itself well. Out of all the 'newish' style of black IPA that I have had, this one is definitely the crown jewel. Congratulations Stone, for making another beer that I find to be so enjoyable."
"Hops and malt come through big together. Dry and sticky from the hops. The hops follow the aroma and the malts are a cocoa dusted almonds. Dark and dry malts combined fruity, sticky hops. Yum."
"Extremely dark, smooth body and just enough head to make this a very good beer. At first try I was surprised by the hoppiness of the beer as it's not a taste I typically attribute to dark black beers. Quality of the ingredients definitely shows in this beer."
"D: The alcohol is nowhere to be found. This is a great beer. I'm not sure that Black IPA works for me as a style but this transcends the style."
"Sublimely Self Righteous Ale pours a dark brownish amber. Off white head and lace stickage. Smells of piney hops, some malt, and earthy/woodsy elements. In the flavor, dry hoppiness and some light citrus and pine notes. Sweet caramel malt backing and some booziness. Nothing exciting, more raw and strong flavors. Overall, more of a strong ale than a black ale, would like a more pronounced roasted malt flavor and less booze. Nonetheless this is an ass kicker."
"Pours black with brown hues around the edges. Excellent fluffy brown-tan head that persists. Aroma is straight west coast hops - pine, resin, mild floral. Flavor is excellent - brief roasted malts, coffee, toffee, followed by that great bitterness. Both aspects are extremely smooth and meld together like a piece of art. I could drink this one all day long. Medium body, great mouth feel. Extensive hop and malt bitterness on the finish. Lacing up and down the glass. About as good as it gets!"
"D- a solid black ale/ipa, i wish there had been a little more roastiness but its not a huge issue, all around well done"
"On draft, this is one of my favorite beers. From a bottle, it continues to live up to its worth."
"Pours a murky brown almost black with a thin beige head. Sweet roasty caramel malts as well as a load of piney, citusy hops. Pretty complex malt versus hops but the flavors really compliment each other. Great smooth body and soft carbonation. Long bitter finish. Delicious"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable....a real palate buster (in a good way). You won't want to spoil your palate with another beer after this one."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. nothing too spectacular on that front. i'm going to pick it up a bit in the drinkability department because ultimately i think this is a really enjoyable brew, though falls short of world class. most do; nothing to be ashamed of."
"M - Smooth with a bitterness that doesn't overpower."
"From a bomber into a wine goblet, dark, nearly opaque brown. Firm pour yields a towering head of brown foam with great retention and clingy lace. Precipitating carbonation keeps the head solid straight down to the bottom of the glass. Great looking brew. Nose is complex with sharp hops-citrus and floral; some malt but no discernable alcohol; floral character overall. In the mouth, it's bitterly hoppy up front with a nice burnt toast malty character behind it. Strong hops presence with a bit of sweet malt for balance, finishing on a bitter, acrid note. Very nice flavor profile. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, very smooth, with light carbonation, complementary of the flavor. Drinkability is very good; a bit stout for mass consumption but definitely an enjoyable sipper. Overall, this is a complex and delicious brew and a nice departure from standard ""orange"" IPA's. I'd definitely try this one again."
"High in alcohol and volume, I wouldn't expect more than one would not suffice, unless you're a hophead and you'd like to get tanked. Not my cup o' tea."
"Conclusion: I will be the first to admit that I am a card carrying full-fledged hop head and this beer may not be my cup of tea. The main objections to this beer are the bad mouth feel, the coating and aftertaste. After further contemplation, I think maybe my growler came from an old barrel that was nearly empty. My experience just doesn't come close to what I read about this beer."
"A fantastic beer."
"D: The beer goes down very easily; I could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"D- I liked it as my first dip in this style, easy drinking for sure."
"Drinkability: Wow. This is a very complex beer. I am enjoying it very much, but it is so complex that I would not reach for another one after I finished the first. That, and it will never be shipped to Utah."
"D- so easy to drink this high ABV black ipa its stouts flavors mixed with citrus hops makes for an outstanding brew"
"M/D) medium to full body, very smooth feel in the mouth. Does not have the drying affect on the palate that many West Coast IPAs have. Very drinkable beer, but far from sessionable, especially at 8.7% abv."
"T: Slightly sweet from the malts upfront and then it gives way to a nice hoppy but not overly bitter finish. Hops are somewhere between citrus and floral and pleasing to the palette."
"Pours dark as a stout with a slightly off-white creamy, rocky head. Several different hops in the nose. Lots of hops in the flavor with the charred and roasted flavors finally in the finish. Lemon and grapefruit start, then the roast, followed with a familiar hop pummeling."
"Pours a thick creamy black with a nice full tan head. Minimal lacing as it goes down. You expect this to be a luxurious gooey tasting beer so the first surprised is the plentiful Hop Aroma as well as taste. Sure enough it is chock full of the high alpha acid varieties, CHINOOK, SIMCOE and AMARILLO. This one would not be out of place in the Stone Bastard series... thick and rich with the unexpected hop punch. EXCELLENT Beer! I would definitely pick one of these up again."
"OVERALL: Interesting and different beer. The Sublimely Self-Righteous is very easy to drink, but also a nice alternative to the ordinary. I will drink this again, but it probably isn't something I would make a part of my standard rotation."
"D:Very drinkable, great great brew, would love to have this again."
"d-very drinkable. This is one of my go to brews!"
"D: One more please.."
"D/O- Stone got this right. Best per style? Yes, for sure."
"The mouthfeel is a bit of a let-down, however. It's way too thick for the tropical hop flavors that this one imparts. The super-hoppy tropical taste makes me want to drink this one like water, but the mouthfeel gets in the way. The drinkability is good, it's hampered a bit by the awkward mouthfeel, but is otherwise rather good for the mouthfeel. An amazing brew from Stone, and the beer to turn the Black IPA haters into believers. Worth every penny."
"D: If I had reviewed this beer last year, I would have given it a C+. In the past, I've criticized Stone for having sort of a ""vomit-tasting"" quality on many of their hoppy brews. Maybe this is due to genetics, or maybe in the past I just haven't cared for a lot of their stuff. However, on this particular tasting of ""Sublimely Self-Righteous"" I totally dug it!"
"Living in the great northwest, i have access to some great IPAs. Ironically most come from San Diego, north of Santa Barbara, north of San Fran, and Portland (ty Black Raven for your Wisdom Seeker). SSR is Best of style. Fantastic. Stone, ironically I hate your IPAs,... but the black is badass."
"The Self-Righteous Ale reminds me very much of Deschutes' Cascadian Dark Ale. Their flavors are both fantastic, mixing a strong pale ale with the darker flavors of a porter or stout. I LOVE pale ales and I LOVE stouts so this beer is a perfect blend of the two. If you want something packed full of flavor yet very drinkable then definitely pick this up. Great beer by Stone!"
"D: I don't think I would drink this again unless it were already inebriated and it were handed to me for free."
"The beer starts with a sweet malt it quickly becomes light in the tongue but hops take over a slight roast and citrus pair to a dry finish leaving a big bitter on the tongue"
"Drinkability: very drinkable not overpowering could drink a couple servings with no problem"
"Another winner from the arrogant bastards at Stone!"
"From notes take a few weeks ago."
"It's a black, but not opaque, pour. Tan fluffy head with Don Ho approved tiny bubbles. Hops, hops and more hops in the nose, but what did you expect? Creamy mouthfeel that invites another sip. Bitter finish, all hops. Where's the malt? Don't care. Awesome like ogling a Farrah Fawcett poster while listening to Slayer. I'll buy twenty more...Sublimely Self Righteous that is."
"M/D: Very smooth. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Extremely drinkable. One of the best in this new category."
"This is an enigma of a beer. So much to take in here that it might take a few more bottles to sort everything out. Looking forward to it..."
"Pours opaque ruby-tinged black with a minimal creamy head and thin lacing. Nose is all hops upfront, a soft stab of cut grass with fresh tangerine peel lingering in the background, on a solid plank of roasted malt notes. Loving the nose. Taste opens with some distant chocolate shavings quickly enveloped by a combination of roasted malt base overcome by a sharp swing of hops. This is one awesome balanced brew. The ABV is barely noticeable in the aftertaste. And the mouthfeel is a full, a sturdy canvas."
"Another Stone I love!"
"Who cares if this is strong. I enjoyed it so much that it took a while to work my way through the bottle. I'm used to darker beers having more of a sugar or caramel bend to them but in this instance, this seemed more like a very hoppy ale or an amber ale. The balance is wonderful here and the only way to equate the bittersweet aftertaste is with my feelings as I took the empty bottle out to recycling. This is about as good as beer gets if you're a hophead. Kudos to Stone!"
"Pours a Coca-Cola colorerd deep brown. Very little head or lacing. Faint smell of hops but not a lot going on. Caramel malt taste followed by slight bitter after taste. This is an enjoyable beer with a sweet touch. I could do this beer again but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"*Okay. This beer needs to open up! As my beer warms, the malts are starting to show. There is a burnt brown sugar quality to it now that was not there before. There is also a touch of it in the nose. Still, this quality is virtually hidden behind the hops. Everything above still stands, but I just thought I needed to add that in."
"D- I thought it was a decent beer. I can't say I would drink it all the time but I would not shy away from having this one again. Good beer."
"D: Oh, I could drink this often. A very nice beer."
"D - This ale was extremely enjoyable (shared with my wife) because of the unexpected hop presence. Extremely well-crafted ale with high drinkability."
"Great mouthfeel of a fantastic medium bodied beer. What a experience, will definitely buy it again, and will try more from this brewer."
"D: Very good, but hops can overwhelm at times. I paired with a Gouda, which was pleasing."
"D - Very drinkable, and so enjoyable for a style that I had not tried before. I am quite pleased with this bomber!"
"beer spy- double ipa festival, bistro, hayward ca, 2/12/11, 6 oz. glass"
"Had on tap, In bottle and growler form from the Stone Brewery- literaly one of the best beers ever, another home run for the guys at stone its like an arrogant bastard IPA strong american strong ale characters very hoppy and citrus-ee ha anyways as dark as midnight and very strong a good beer with bbq meats overall a definate A if you haven't tried it you need to...that is all...."
"I'm still on the fence about Cascadian Dark Ales, American Black Ales, or Black IPAs if you will but this is a good beer and the style could certainly grow on me. I know this particular beer will!"
"Appearance is a dark brown with a one finger tan head, which leaves some nice lacing. The smell is sweet with grapefruit, quite a punch of hops, toffee as well. Upon sipping this black ipa from Stone, the same flavors from the nose are there & in a very balanced fashion. I also tasted some chocolate and coffee in the finish. MF is medium, smoother than I expected going in. Drinkability also gets a thumbs up with this beer, another winner from Stone."
"Pours dark black, wisps of off white foam, but otherwise very clear. Smell and taste are roasted, get the sensation of a stout with a little more IPA hop backbone. Residual bitter. More stout than IPA though. Good beer, full of flavor."
"Pours a dark brown. Very dark with reddish hints. Tons of hops on the nose. Piney and grapefruit primarily. Hops hint first on the tonue. Pine first and foremost and then lots of citrus/grapefruit. Pretty impressive how hoppy it is given the darkness. Light and highly drinkable"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, but like so many of the West Coast brewers, this beer is just way too out of balance for my particular taste. It has some significant malt, but at 8.7%, how could you not? This beer is a hop-monster, which for some people is the ""nectar of the Gods", but I prefer my nectar to be drinkable sip after sip. This beer gets rough and ugly on the palate after a few sips, forcing you to take a drink of water to ""reset"" your palate. That is a bit much for me. This beer is OK, but I don't think that I would drink it again...especially not a whole 22oz bomber by myself like I am tonight."
"This beer pours a dark, dark brown on the verge of black with a rich mahogany one finger head that laces the glass. It barely allows any light to pass through it and is medium in body. The aromas are surprisingly very hoppy upfront with a good amount of charred malts in the back. The flavor is hoppier than anticipated as well. It has a very sharp and distinct pine/citrus hop profile right out of the gate. It finishes with a load of dark roasted malts, on the verge of tasting burnt. It's good but the charcoal flavor keeps me from scoring it higher. It drinks pretty full in body and the flavors become more bold as you continue to drink it. It's a good beer but like a lot of Stone's darker beers, I don't consider it to be overly drinkable. Something about their aftertastes just throw me off."
"D: Solid flavor, medium-light body for the style, solid drinkability. There's a touch too much dry bitterness for me to drink more than a bomber."
"D - The flavors are all in good balance without any rough edges. Great beer to drink."
"Very dark, almost black with some lacing that hangs around down the glass. Roasty malts - like a porter, pretty much - with a hint of the hop assault. Black IPA is a perfect description of this beer. The hops are prominent and persistent throughout the palate. Upfront, the first impression is of a porter, with the chocolate/roasted malt flavor. Then the hops come in and dominate; the dry hopping is especially prominent in this one. The hop flavor in this beer is AMAZING-seriously like having a glass of fresh hops. This is a thick, velvety beer and the lingering hop taste does have a tongue-drying effect. Overall, a fantastic beer."
"D- A definite hop lovers beer. A bit too in your face for me to want to drink a great deal of it in a night. But I dug it. Merited another purchase."
"D: Crazy drinkable. I just finished some home brew that clocked in at 190 IBU's before this and the beer still held up hoppy. Cheers to Stone!"
"It's got nice carbonation and mouthfeel and has good drinkability."
"D: The strong flavors, thick body, slightly chalky feel, and higher alcohol make this a harder to drink beer. Maybe part of the problem was that while I loved some components, the overall beer was more of a mess than a thing of beauty. I honestly needed someone to split the bomber with me, because this beer is not tame enough for a 22 oz."
"This is a go to beer for me. When the 11th anniversary came out I must have drank 20 bottles. It was my first time with a black ipa and frankly I never looked back. Though I feel the 11th was better than the sublimely I was still stoked to have it available year round. It bours black with a root beer hue. The head is an inviting tan. Smell is pure hops and I love it. The subtle toasted malt are present as well. This beer is the definition of an iba. The color is black bit it drinks like an ipa. Super hoppy and delicious. Nothing bad to say about this other than the smaller batch of the 11th was better. I still have 4 bottles of the 11th and I drank one the other day. The profile is completely different as you'd expect. The piney hop flavors are gone and the malt flavors are huge, it's almost choclatey. It is a completely different beer but still delicious!"
"D: I love to drink this stuff. And I can drink it until it knocks me down..."
"Enjoy!"
"GO STONE BREWING!"
"Tasty beer, with pleasant characters. A bit of a falter towards the end adds a touch too much robustness, but overall a very tasty brew from Stone."
"D Can I have another PLEASE!! I think it is exceptional. Awesome beer."
"D: Very rich, but considering ABV, very drinkable."
"Not somthing I could drink everyday because of the bitterness, but a great on occasion beer."
"Overall the carbonation and ABV goes well with the flavors, but maybe slightly over carbonated. The full body makes this very strong but the bitter finish balances this out nicely. This beer would go well with a grilled steak. Stone never fails to impress and this one just keeps that trend going for me."
"A very strange and one might say extreme example of the IBA style. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing--an IPA masquerading in the guise of a dark beer. The hops almost perfectly mute everything but the colour."
"This is an excellent dark ale. A once in a while beer that smacks you in the head and wakes up the taste buds."
"(d)- This beer isn't exactly a sniffer, but it isn't something you'd be ordering a pitcher of either. Its intended to be bought and enjoyed in 2 sniffers, like im doing now. I'll definitely pick this one up again. (4/5)"
"Mouthfeel is about average, very drinkable to anyone that enjoys a hoppy bitter beer."
"Overall, excellent. It is clear why this is in the top 100, and why Stone decided to continue brewing it after it was an anniversary beer."
"A great brew! Unique in that it balances contrasting flavors better than many others balance complimentary ones. I want to try the Amarillo hop edition!"
"Cheers"
"The CPJ"
"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Pitch black with a creamy head. Smells hoppy with lots of pine and citrus. Taste is a murky mix of dark malts and hops. Very bitter with some grassiness. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Not overly drinkable, this is something you have to take your time with."
"This would be a nice pairing with a variety of beef dishes, and would probably be wonderful with nicely roasted lamb."
"This beer appears black with a thick, light tan head. The head hangs out for several minutes before leaving a thick sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of alcohol, hops, pine. The flavor is primarily of hops and pine, with chocolate and roast notes following behind. The feel is medium bodied with prominent alcohol throughout. This beer is a bit too hot, slightly degrading the drinkability..."
"D: It's tastes good but it is just an odd combination that takes a bit to get used to."
"Pours a black color that turn ruby when held up to the light...has medium off-white head. Scent is very hoppy with a tiny bit of chocolate as well. Taste is so surprisingly different than what you're expecting from the appearance. Gotta love those Cascadian Black IPAs! I'm really glad they're popping up more often, because they're delicious! At first I get much similar flavors to an Imperial IPA, with the caramel, strong malt profile as well as intense hops. The hops seem to be well balanced of citrus and floral notes. Then the darkness comes in...with slight roasty and chocolate flavors. Finishes with a pleasant balance of hops and bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and not nearly as thick as expected...Drinkability is fairly high."
"Overall, I really wished for there to be a little more emphasis on the roasted malt character in this beer but this seems to have been sacrificed for a more aggressive hop profile. As it stands there was definitely something left to be desired."
"Drinkability: Might be difficult to drink to many as it is quite hoppy, but I'd love to start the night with 1 or 2 to get things going. Will set quite the bar to measure up to though!"
"Great offering from Stone.. pretty much a must try.. seek fresh, recommended!"
"Cheers."
"D: A solid brew and a good offering on the Dark Ale side. Still, I was expecting a bit better from Stone since they set the bar so high with all their other brews. An enjoyable beer that any brew lover would enjoy, but not one to go out of your way to find."
"D - Fantastic beer; another great from Stone. A good balance to their typical uber-hoppy fare (not to say that this isn't hoppy). However, I found this to be more balanced than a lot of their other beers."
"Poured into dimple glass from a bomber. Very malty, hoppy black IPA that manages to be aggressive, yet mild and medium bodied at the same time. Poured a black ruby brown from the bottle with a nice tan creamy head. There is some brandy on the nose and a heavy roasted taste. Then the finish kick in and, wow! The finish is incredibly complex, with at least 4 stages of subtle change on the tongue. A tingling sensation followed by some sharp hints of bitterness, then a rollicking wave on the tastebuds that settles into a smooth, refined exit. Truly great."
"d- Definitely a sipper, but that's not a bad thing with a beer this tasty. Definitely a tad high on the IBU's, but that's pretty much the standard with every Stone beer. A very unique mix of flavors and one of my favorites from Stone."
"D: This is a strong one, but very drinkable. I would drink them till I fell off my chair (slowly)."
"Drinkability - Not going to have more than 1 of these in a night, but one is all you need."
"Definitely a slow drinking beer but very enjoyable non the less if you don't like hops please steer clear of this one you might just throw it out"
"Very drinkable. Great in a small glass. Too much would definitely wear your mouth down. Great beer, though."
"D: Goes down easily, extremely tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden kick. This is easily one of the best Black IPA's that I have had thus far."
"So their 11th Anniversary Ale was arrogant enough to become year-round. Thin, tan lacing on top of a nearly pitch-black brew. Thick resin hop nose with hints of burnt malt, old school. Smooth, almost full-ish body. Oh mama, insane hop presence ... enough for a hophead to get their fix within the first sip. Spikes of charred malt poke through the thick blanket of hops. Warmth of alcohol plays well. We have no choice but to love this beer."
"Other thoughts -- I'm an amateur all-grain homebrewer and admitted hophead, and am already thinking about how to clone this thing. It's that good! For those that think this style should be like a stout or porter - look elsewhere!"
"D: This Black IPA has the most hop characteristics of the other that I have tried. It's definitely the most unique as well, not much roasted malt flavor, it's masked by the bitters and resins that are almost overpowering. This is a beer you must try, it's good but not great. As of right now, if you can get your hands on Element's Dark Matter, do it. That is by far the best Black IPA I've had so far."
"Served from 22oz bomber to mug."
"D- Drinkability is kind of poor due to the lack of balance... this however may just be indicative of this 1st BIPA review. Alcohol isn't too bad and it is kind of warming!"
"Drinkabilty - I would give it a higher rating but it is 8.7%. I had no problems drinking the 22oz, and actually would have loved another one but its strong enough that i woulda been in trouble. This is the best black ipa ive had so far, its very well balanced and a real pleasure to drink. Stone nails another one!"
"This easy sipper is wicked tasty and helps to define this emerging style. Very complex and interesting beer. It is not bashful in its use of hops, but moves methodically toward an IPA/Stout hybrid."
"DB- Just a bit too hoppy in the taste, the aroma is very good though. The mouthfeel is really the only thing that falls short here. Very piney and bitter, starts to wear me down. Very strong beer."
"Poured dark brown color with a large frothy brown head that lasted and produced excellent lacing. Heavy complex toasted malt,tart citrus and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a sticky texture. Heavy balanced bittersweet chocolate malt flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout beer that I have additional bottles to try the next three years."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is between light and medium bodied, and pretty smooth drinking. Overall this is a good example of of a Black IPA, but the flavor profile is just a bit off. Still, not a bad beer."
"Poured on tap at the Stone Brewery into a pint glass. The beer is a dark brown, glassy, thick coloring, almost black in the depths. The beer has a 1 inch creamy, thick, tan head. The nose is hop heavy, with grapefruit and resinous forward notes, followed by a solidly smoked and roasted note that helps to balance it. The taste is hop forward, very bitter and resinous, and these characteristics are enhanced by the roast and smoke characters. The hop-heavy feel continues into the finish, where there is more of a citrus hops linger, but still plenty of bitterness. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, despite the boldness of the flavors. This is a big beer, with very heavy characteristics. Damn tasty, and not for the faint of heart."
"Smooth texture and drinkability."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black (or extremely dark brown) with red highlights around the edges when held up to the light. Nice big light tan head that has great retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. I've never had a black IPA before so I keep thinking more of a stout smell and taste and I keep getting thrown off...in a good way though. The smell was very hoppy way more hoppier than I expected actually. Mainly citrusy. A little bit of malt in the background which gives it a slight roasted smell. The taste is similar, very hoppy with a slight roasted bite in the background. Nice and bitter, ends with a faint coffee/roasted malt finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average and smooth, like a step below creamy. The ABV on this one isn't terribly high so finishing this is no problem. I'd actually take another. My first black IPA and it's pretty great and another great beer from Stone. Will definitely pick this one up again."
"D= probably too strong for session, came in a large 22oz bottle and at 8.7% ABV it's probably going to decrease one's capacity. Also somewhat filling. Dryness might get in the way with some foods, or most foods. Maybe good with anything smoked or grilled."
"Great beer!"
"Drinkability: Very well brewed Black IPA. Nice juicy hop flavor with some stout/porter characteristics. Stone is a very consistent brewery and this brew lives up to the high standards they set."
"Pours black with huge foamy tan head. Nose is citrus hops foremost, chocolate roasty malts apparant as well, auromas of a stout sutble. Taste is a complex blend of bitter hops and robust toasted malts. Dark chocolates combined with pine needles. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, dry in the finish. My first experience with a well recieved Cascadian Dark Ale. Honoured it was with Stone's self-proclaimed best. Great benchmark of an ABV, this bomber is goning to be perfect for the drinking session this afternoon. Cheers to great craft beer."
"Overall a wonderful IPA well worth a second glass."
"D - Wow, this is a great brew... If it were not for the color and faint roasted malt components this would compete for prominence about IPAs and DIPAs... With the black color and faint roasted malt component, this becomes a highly memorable and enjoyable brew... The only things keeping this being a ""5" in this category are the 9% ABV which is hard to hide and the hop assault that leaves the tongue blistered and battered..."
"this beer pours a dark near black color with a tan head that recedes to lacing. the aroma brings the promised hops nearly balanced by the roasted malt character. the taste has a really nice piney hop character up front filled out by the coffee notes of the black roast, the medium body and good co2 make this a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a beautiful balck/ dark mahogany with a nice, frothy espresso creme head. Lacing is consistent and substantial. Nice floral, pine smell tells you you're in for a hop treat. It doesn't disappoint. First taste denotes citrus and molasses. The alcohol is foreward initially, which I don't mind. It mellows in subsequent tastes to a nice, warming presence. The mouthfeel is creamy, more so than I expected. The hop presence wins by a nose over that malt sweetness, which is never cloying. Just an all around flavorful, drinkable beer and a real treat for the beer senses."
"This beer is really straight forward, but really well done. Amazing beer all around, and incredibly drinkable. One bomber wasn't enough, two would be no problem. Enjoy."
"A humbling experience. Its as if the best qualities of an IPA, porter, and barleywine were combined into one beer."
"This is a sipping beer to me. Partly because it is strong, and partly because it is so interesting. As a homebrewer, I am jealous of the mind that created this."
"Regarding drinkability, the alcohol at 8.7% by volume is never noticeable. You might feel it, but you won't taste it. And I think the subdued complexity and interesting 'bright points' make it remarkably compelling. It's brilliantly balanced at its core, and superbly studded with hops. Quite possibly my favorite beer from Stone."
"D: This beer is excellent...but at 8.7% abv, one must be wise. I sipped on my bomber for about 90 minutes, which gave me a good chance to note its varying nuances with temperature change. I would drink this beer anywhere, anytime, but not more than a pint or two."
"O - Overall this beer is well assembled, and as such there's nothing really ""wrong"" with it at all. Having said that, there's also nothing really impressive about it either. All-in-all: solid, but uninspiring - a bit like a girl calling a guy ""nice""."
" ~ I want more of this beer. I wish I could have one a week. This is a great beer."
"D - This is a seriously drinkable brew! Hoppy and delicious, and the 8.7% ABV is hardly detectable. I have to thank cdkrenz for introducing me to this beer that is far less than modest. Simply delicious!"
"I challenge Stone to make a beer that doesn't make me happy. This beer delivers very well. Perhaps the hoppiest Cascadian I've had yet!"
"D: Great drinkability considering the abv - there's almost no hint of it in the taste. I'm a big fan of the ""regular"" Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale (which also utilizes amarillo hops, but not at this level!)... this version definitely takes it up a notch... great stuff! Not sure what the availability on this one is, but if I ever see it again I'll be sure to have a couple -"
"I wouldn't go for this again unless it was on draft somewhere. Understandably so an IPA, though it still needs balance, something I feel the Sublimely is lacking."
"D - this is a great beer. Flavors are bold yet balanced and way to easy to drink. Great stuff."
"Stone aces it again."
"D: I really like dark ales and IPAs, so for me this is a very drinkable mixture of the too."
"Overall, not a bad beer. If I saw it on tap I would order one immediately, just to see if their is a taste differential."
"Another champion beer from Stone. Sublime indeed."
"fairly light bodied for a beer this big, overally fairly drinkable. definitely a good representation of this style."
"D: Fine sipping beer, enjoy on a special occasion. This is my first Stone beer and was rather impressed, look forward to sampling more Stone beers. I have only tried this style one other time, quite enjoyed it."
"lovers everywhere."
"Nice two finger chocolate brown head of thick foam, leaving thick clinging lace on the side of the glass. Color is dark dark brown, comparing to a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Good aroma of hops right on top, with lime, sour bread, lemon peel, coco and oats. Powerful taste of pine, citrus, sweet malt and oats. A little heavy on hops, but a good taste anyway. Not a beer you would want to drink very many of unless you are home or have a good sober driver. Well worth the price."
"D: A very good example of the style with both IPA and stout/porter notes coming through at all times. Absolutely worth a shot if you like the style"
"This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it. Sure I may have wanted more balance...but when I'm in the mood for something nice and bitter, yet clean...this is a good option. The searing grapefruit bitterness of this beer really hits the spot."
"This is the best black IPA that I've had so far, but having Upland's Komodo Dragonfly recently, the gap has closed."
"Drinkability: EXCEPTIONAL. Everything about this ale is right. Taste, smell, appearance, and feel are all amazing. This might be the IPA in which I compare all others from now on."
"Again for my uncultured taste the drinkability was poor at best, as the mix of sour grapefriut and sweet licorace was too much for my palate. In all fairness, and seeing how well liked this beer is, the bottle was most likely way past its prime. Oh yea....if you do happen to like Coors don't buy this beer thinking you will like it."
"- Cheers!"
"All about the hops and not so much the roasted malts, which is how I like this style. The best Cascadian Dark Ale I've tried to date."
"The Sublimely Ale pours a deep brown almost black color. Nice tan colored head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Aromas are coffee, malts and slight hints of raisins and prunes. Taste is pretty hot and almost too alcoholic. The alcohol overpowers a lot of the other flavors on the quaff. A nice hop finish rounds out the taste. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability is mediocre. I think this will do really well with a little age on it."
"D - I think this beer is awesome and probably the best example of this 'emerging' style. Stone at it again, well done."
"Drinkability-- even with a higher ABV there is enough ""body"" to this beer so I could see myself having emptied several 22 oz bottles and being welded to my seat but in beer heaven."
"Black IPA is one of my new favorite styles and this is a fantastic example. Another hit from Stone, a brewery that can really do no wrong. Will definitely be picking this one up some more."
"Overall, this is another amazing offering from stone. This is definitely the best black ipa i've ever had and i will be picking up another bottle in the near future."
"A really good Black IPA, maybe the best one I have ever had in that style."
"Sublime? Indeed. Self-righteous? Uh...it's brewed by Stone. Nuff said."
"D: Though delicious, this isn't the most drinkable beer. It's quite bitter with a long finish, has lots of flavors going on that get a tad cloying after a while as they don't really evolve (each flavor profile is easily identifiable and sticks out from the others), and it has a restrictive ABV of 8.7%. I managed a bomber by myself, but that was certainly plenty. I would pick this up again in a heartbeat (especially a fresh bottle), but I'd want to share a bomber with a friend."
"D. An excellent beer that would be one of my go-to beers if not for the high ABV. Still an excellent choice!"
"d - holy crap...where have you been all my life? black ipa's are easily my favorite style of the last couple years and SSR is exceptional. i'm not the biggest fan of stone so i usually walk by them when i'm making a purchase. this beer has given me a new found respect for them. BUY THIS NOW!"
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down easily, and has a lot of flavor. This was my first black IPA , and I think it is a good and interesting style. I can't wait to try some more. As for this beer though, I would pick it up again for sure."
"If you're lucky enough to find the double dry hopped version of this on tap, drink as many as you can. Rare you find something that makes a perfect beer ""perfecter""!!!"
"D: Dangerously drinkable given the ABV. Great beer overall and another solid selection from Stone."
"Pours a black brown color with a caramel colored head. Looks like an IS but has an aroma of a DIPA, grapefruit and pine. There is a very subtle roastyness to it, but very distant. Tastes like a DIPA. Sweet up front, then hit with the harsh hopiness. A resinous brew. If you look for it, you can taste hints of the roasty malts. But I have had DIPA's that are more malt forward than this brew. Excellent beer. You will notice the maltiness kick up as it warms."
"CHEERS!!"
"A bold brew with big hops, full bodied and bold. Good complexity. This one get's your attention."
"Would drink this beer any day."
"Poured dark chestnut brown with an off white head. Beautiful garnet hues in the light. No lace. Very assertive citrus, less assertive pine, and finally, a light touch of coffee and roasted barley, which I can't quite comprehend with my nose at the moment. The taste, however, seems to put it back in place and is actually quite good. The grapefruit lasts throughout, but fades into pine in the finish, followed by a touch of astringent coffee-like bitterness. How odd. I could call this an India Porter Ale... or an IPA with an identity crisis? Whatever it may be, it fools me nicely and I'm having a blast enjoying this beer."
"The rich, bitter mouthfeel finishes clean with at lovely citrus peel bitterness and faint toffee sweetness. There is a slight booziness that gently warms, but doesn't burn. This is a very drinkable beer for the ABV, it's so delicious that it's hard to stop drinking. I Love it, and am very glad that Stone has added this to it's year round releases."
"D: A lot of flavor to handle, utterly delicious. It's name says it all."
"D- This wasn't the first time I've had SSSRA, but it was the first time I've had it from a growler, let alone it was the first thing I put in my new Stone growler. This is one of my go to beers when I'm in the mood for a change up from the usual IPA. The richness of a complex porter or stout with the great flavor of a solid IPA combined seamlessly. Highly recommend."
"Note; I'm trying to be nice and keep the style in mind, but in general, I hate IPAs of all kinds. However this one was not so bad and I could certainly appreciate the bitterness. I'll never be a hophead but this was a fine drink to be sure."
"Full flavored and very easy-drinking with a well-masked alcohol presence. Wish I'd tried this one sooner...!"
"This was like an American take on a Theakston Old Peculier for those of you familiar with that particular Yorkshire ale. It is rich dark smooth and malty without ever being heavy. An awful lot of brown-ish head when you pour this into the glass that takes a while to dissipate (probably has something to do with it coming from a bottle and my walking it home from the store.) I will definitely have some more in the future."
"Drinkability: A sipper for sure. Complex and layered, this is a very fine beer deserving of accolades."
"lower carbonation, smooth. i polished off the bomber pretty quickly, easy to drink and no notice of the almost 9% abv."
"D: With everything going on, it's still a fairly easy-drinking beer, dangerously so for almost 9% ABV, and I'd easily get it again."
"D: Good drinkability. Split a bomber with some family members, but I could of had a bit more. ABV is hidden very well."
"I've always been a fan of Stone and will definitely throw this beer into the rotation now that the weather is cooling down. At nearly 9%, a few of these will have you melting back in your chair..."
"Medium-bodied mouthfeel, just like a porter. Small tactile bubbly mouthfeel. Very, very, very drinkable. Incredibly flavorful and easy to drink. I could see why the XI anniversary was so highly requested. This is a badass beer."
"Drinkability is really quite good. There's a very good balance to this beer and while I'm definitely not a hop head, even I can appreciate how well the bitterness goes with the malts and sweetness. Very well done and I definitely have to give props to Stone for crafting yet another winner in their long line of top notch brews."
"Well I've had this one a few times and now just getting around to reviewing it. Before I even poor the beer I can smell that west coast dry hopping. Pours black with a two finger light tan head with spotty lacing all around. Again crazy west coast piney hop aroma. Multi layered hoppiness, a little piney and floral, a good bit bitter with a lasting sharp after taste. Full body and rich without tasting like a hoppy porter. Well carbed and well rounded and easy to drink to boot. at 8.7 abv there is not hot flavor and no sign of the booze."
"D- delicious, with quite an intoxicating effect after the first pint. I love the roast malts and biting hop flavor."
"Stone makes great beers - period."
"This beer has a lovey black colour and an excellent light-brown head. The smell is delicious: mostly of citrussy hops. It has a malty flavour up front which is quickly overtaken by the hoppiness. Very nice. It feels great in the mouth but afterawhile the aftertaste builds up too much."
"D : A unique brew, that is a rage on the senses. A bomber of this is all ones palette could take. Bonus points for being unique. Overall, I like it, but it isn't something i'd have often. I just simply prefer more direct styles."
"D: Stone makes some solid brews but this just isn't something that I liked all that much... it was good but not great, still a good beer though and enjoyed the full 22oz bomber."
"There was maybe a bit more body than a strong IPA, but this is no thick brew. It's incredibly smooth, and the carbonation is spot on IMO. It finishes surprisingly clean, and not too dry. Sublimely easy to drink, with righteous flavor, Bravo Stone."
"Sublimely Self-Righteous was my first beer on cask, and while I really liked it, it didn't floor me as being incredibly good. It poured a solid black, with a light foamy head that lasted several minutes of sipping. The beer had a fairly light body with a malty taste and a strong hoppy finish. Slight chocolaty and roasty flavors were present, but nothing overall that greatly impressed me, although I might have enjoyed this over Deschutes Hop in the Dark Cascadian Black Ale."
"A beautiful beer. I will continue to seek out the style."
"Medium to heavy body. Decent carbonation. Drinkability is alright for how overwhelming this can be."
"Pours black with a foamy mocha head. The smell is hoppy, a very inviting citrus hop bouquet, so weird to have a dark beer with such a great hop aroma, but also amazing. The taste starts with a huge hop presence followed with some great citrus flavor, followed with a small bitter malt aftertaste with the hops lingering. The mouthfeel is medium, almost heavy, a nice smooth beer with great balance in flavor. This one has great drinkability, nice powerful flavor, a great overall beer."
"D- stone makes a pretty good brew. The smoked malt is a little overwhelming for me, but its still a good brew"
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a very good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Slight piney hop nose. Flavor is slightly more pine hops than caramel malt and with lingering piney aftertaste. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA."
"Drinkability- The 22 oz bomber just isn't enough sometimes! Maybe a four pack would suffice. If i was in between meals I could probably tackle the four. Otherwise, sits a bit heavy and is pretty potent so be responsible."
"D - One bomber is enough for me, but it went fast. Goes down smooth and makes you fall in love with it. It deserves its reputation as one of the best ABA/BIPAs in the world. Best served fresh, to allow the hops to pop a bit more."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with two fingers of head that faded slowly with nice lacing. The aroma is a mix of sweet molasses and toasted malt. The taste is thick, sweet and creamy at the front end, followed by a earthy bitterness and some slight astringency from the roasted malts. The finish is slow and lingering with some warming. Body is on the thick side of medium, and drinkability is very good given that its running 8.7%. Pretty tasty."
"Tasty brew! Will easily be enjoyed by IPA lovers."
"I like this beer, but it is one of the few that I wish I had less of. The bomber is too much for me. Maybe it is the strength of hops (duh, it is an IPA) or just the astringent nature, but by the time you are wrapping up the remainder (I have 1/3 pint left as I write), you are ready to move on. Hop heads will want to bathe in this stuff. Hop-appreciative folks will have respect for it but less affinity. Worth a try just the same. A very good, well made beer."
"Color is dark brown, almost opaque with hints of orange-ish ruby red where light can get through. Head is rich tan and very impressive - whipped cream consistency. Immediate scents of dark roasted coffee, smoke, spice (black pepper), dead pine and an odd, sweaty B.O. ""old tennis shoe"" odor which detracts. The flavor is sharp and pungent, musty and rich with smoke and earthy basement flavors. The mouthfeel is very good, rich with a nice spiky carbonation. Drinkability is a bit low due to thick gunk collecting on the back of the tongue and throat. Not a true winner. Stone was over-hyped for introduction to my market (Chicago), and has turned out to be no big deal compared to Founders, Bell's, New Glarus and other reputable midwest brewers. Plus, the price is sky high and not justified. So they ship it from CA? Big deal. A good beer, don't get me wrong, but not ""great," and not ""sublime."""
"I was hoping for some help on the label on interpreting my senses - not much there. This beer is on my list of have agains to see if I can match age to the beer taste."
"Pours a dark, slighly reddish brown with moderate-sized tan head. Aroma is an interesting combination of roast and sweet citrusy hops. Flavour has lots of character with strong citrusy hops, some dark fruit, roastiness and a hint of cocoa. Fairly bitter finish; medium+ body. Very nice."
"More excellent beer from Stone, that's it."
"Surprising offering from stone! Pours a deep black with a 2 inch tan, creamy looking head. Leaves incredible lacing down the entire glass. Has incredible hop flavor that quickly turns into incredible chocolate maltiness. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with an intense hop bitterness! Overall an incredible beer, very interesting as always with Stone! Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bomber"
"I finished the bomber with no problem, and enjoyed every drop. I would buy it again for a hybrid style, I think it is worth the try."
"D: Overall an enjoyable beer. Nice to have something that's outside the usual spectrum of beers."
"The first thing I noticed about the self righteous ale is the strong, sweet smell. Definitely a delicious strong malty smell with a dark color to match. Exactly what I come to expect from the new breed that is an American Black IPA. The taste is hoppy and bitter as you would expect from a IPA, but also of lingering malts. A beer I could drink multiples of in a night an not be tired of."
"This brew is very good, and very interesting. After recently having sculpin and nelson for the first time, sublimely self-righteous is very interesting because the hop profile is so much different than those. The Chocolate malts really show the Deeper, heavier flavors hops can offer and proves that a heavy hop profile can accent the darkness of chocolate malts very nicely. Huge grapefruit notes poound the palette."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is my first experience with an American Black Ale (Black IPA) and I am not disappointed. Another great offering by Stone. I would highly recommend this. I'll be buying more of these."
"D: I want more. I thought Hop in the Dark was best but I think this beer is way better! This beer is easy to get for me and I feel I have under-appreciated it!"
"If you like unsweetened grapefruit, you will most definitely like this beer. It is very bitter and hoppy. Oh, and one more thing, did I mention it was bitter?"
"This is a good beer but a little typical-tasting coming from Stone in my opinion."
"D: pretty good. The only other CDA I've had is the Deschutes Hop in the Dark, which I liked a lot, so I'm definitely into the style. The Deschutes version was more complex I seem to remember, and not as relentlessly bitter and alcoholic. Still I'd certainly have another if offered."
"Notes: This is another outstanding beer from Stone."
"Cheers..."
"A lighter bodied feel than I expected, but thats not to say this is a light beer. It still packs plenty of punch and you can feel that in your mouth. Overall, this is a beer that pretty much defines the black IPA category. Who knew hoppy and dark could go so well together."
"one of my favorite beers possibly."
"Great beer, great brewery. I'm really starting to like these Black IPAs, especially ones done this well."
"d - considering stone's big hop presence this just begs to be quaffed. easily drinkable and really goes down smooth."
"Bravo Stone"
"I'm going to enjoy this one. It seems like a mix between almost an imperial stout and an IPA. Very nice brew. Cheers!"
"That was a hell of a thing."
"D: This is my first taste of this style, and enjoyed it. I will definitely be back for more."
"D: A good, style-bending beer. Not sure if the experiment works for me in the long run though."
"Drinkability is high if you are into this type of beer. Take a black butte, infuse it with Ruination, and you have SSRA. Get one and bask in its glory."
"This is a top notch very enjoyable beer."
"Let's just say, I really like it. It's pretty good."
"Definitely worth a shot. This was my first Black IPA and now I want to try more!"
"One of my favorite styles and this is incredible on cask"
"Atmosphere is great. Tall, dark, and handsome. Deep, rich hue with a full, foamy head, and plenty of sticky lacing. Nose is full and a great balance of malt and hops with some woody and sweet tones in there too. Flavor is a fantastic malty, woody, hoppy balance. Very well done. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"M&D - you could name this beer balance, it is remarkably balanced between a strong hop profile and the cloying malts, these factors create an easy to drink beer that will appease hop heads and session beer drinkers"
"Pretty simple overall honestly, i didnt find alot going on, but everything there is well done."
"Very nice hop aroma. Taste is smoky, with some cocoa/chocolate and wood notes. At 8.7 ABV, this will sneak up on you in a hurry. This is another delicious offering from Stone that I look forward to trying again."
"The cask delivery ramps up the drinkability quite a bit for me and delivers the flavors with a certain purity."
"Good job Stone, I applaud your diction."
"D: For the ABV, I could ahve quite a few of these. I think it is the nice balance between thte hops and malt. Or it could just be another amazing offering from Stone!"
"Yes definitely a Black IPA"
" Needless to say I was very impressed by this Full Bodied bottle of joy. My faith has been restored in Stone Brewing Co. and I will definitely be trying some of their not so Arrogant masterpieces ....All in all you must try this beer at least once in your life.."
"A very interesting brew and successful experiment of a style if nothing else, but a brew and style I will probably only revisit when I'm in a definite mood for something this unique."
"Not super drinkable because of the strong bittering hops. Kinda cool though."
"It's certainly not a beer for all occasions - it strikes me as a really excellent option for the fall - but what it does, it does well."
"D - I could down a bomber pretty easily. Not something I really want to seek out, but tasty."
"Really easy drinking black IPA."
"d- very easy to consume if used to the more hoppier beers that stone puts out, for me its a nice beer to drink while working on a paper or reading."
"A bit much to down at 22oz of this. But, Stone even admits that there is no point in disagreeing with this beer - it is Self-Righteous for its own sake."
"Overall a very good beer with a strong flavor. If you like arrogant, then you will like this one."
"Taste is fairly similar to arrogant bastard, it's rich bitter and roasty all at once. Basically it a palate pummeled. Really nice cramy mouthfeel makes it surprisingly drinkable."
"Poured into a snifter, it begins as a monstrous gusher of mahogany colored foam. The body is as dark as night; it is absolutely impervious to any light. While the nose is overwhelmed by some aggressively cloying molasses, the palate experiences a heavy infusion of alcohol and malt that results in a bitter and lingering finish. The body is heavy, bready and somewhat gummy. It is potent and deserving of respect - and most likely restricted to a single quaff as I know of few beer lovers who could pound down more than one. I would recommend this be sipped longingly after a holiday meal."
"Drinkability- For the ABV the drinkability is good. While it is a sipper consider this one easy to drink, probably not more than a bomber's worth per sitting however."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours almost black with ruby highlights and a thin head. Smells very hoppy with citrus as well as burnt sugar, caramel, and some roastiness. The taste is quite an interesting mix of roastiness, hoppiness, and tannins. Tea-like in flavor, with burnt sugar and hops. In the mouth its smooth and a bit tannic on the finish. Very interesting."
"On a side note, thanks to Stone rep Aaron Tyrell for all the contact on the bad bottle issue. Hearing from reps or brewery employees about quality issues, or any other issue for that matter, means a lot to me an other beer geeks."
"Seriously easy to drink, where is that 8.7%? I haven't felt it yet. Stone, keep right on bringing it."
"This is a very good beer and is certainly worth a try. I would recommend this and will get it again."
"D - this was absolutely great to drink. sipped on it over an hour letting the flavors slowly evolve as it warmed. halfway through took on a handful of spicy buffalo wings and the pairing was delectable. dare I say it, this is better than Arrogant Bastard"
"D - For an almost 9% brew, fairly high. I am very impressed and will purchase again as I feel there is so much going on here, I can't nail it all down here..."
"So imagine my shock and joy upon having Sublimely appear on tap at a bar near me. When delivered it had all the velvety appearance of the bottled version and more. The aroma coming off the glass is something akin to a IPA surviving a very mild lumber yard fire (primarily ceder and oak, maybe some pine) fire; with just enough heat and smoke to darken and roast without driving off the hops. The tap better preserves the roasted character of the beer and the subtle hop aroma while enhancing the mouth feel. As with the bottled version this beer is very drinkable and something I recommend to people new to beer and more seasoned drinkers alike."
"The dark color of this strong ale belies the hop kick it brings. Very tasty, excellent mouth feel..velvety...nice aroma. But still very drinkable, not heavy tasting...even on a warm summer evening. This is definitely a benchmark example of this style."
"Another big brute of hops from Stone for their 11th. One that'll grab your tongue and pierce it with the spiked wing of a gargoyle."
"Drinkability - It drinks like an american strong dark ale, I was happy with one."
"Will buy again. Often."
"D-It may just be me but ive yet to come across anything from stone that isn't at least above avg and very easy to drink, this one is no exception I am very happy I got to have it."
"D - Great sipper. I like the complexity. The alcohol is hidden nicely. I will likely purchase this Stone beer again!"
"One of my favorites!"
"The body is supremely smooth, elegant and refreshing. Stone really hit the nail on the head with this one. While it comes in smooth and luscious, it finishes crisp and clean completely refreshing your palate. This could be such an amazing beer with a huge range of foods! Spicy, grilled and roasted meats will do amazing. Rich chocolate deserts and fatty soft cheeses will be beautiful. But really, all I want to do is enjoy this beer on its own. I'm a little sad that Stone is so far away, and I constantly debate with my roommate over what beer if any beer I could choose to be regularly available in Toronto would be. Time and time again, I end of with this black magic work of art."
"Pours a dark shade of crimson with two fingers of head and nice lacing. The flavor is bright with a floral and citrusy hop profile. The taste is very bitter initially with an earthy hop profile that is good but quite boring to my palate. The body is medium with low carbonation. Overall this is a tasty but highly uneventful beer."
"An excellent offering from Stone. Will revisit this one for sure."
"Fell in love with Black I.P.A.'s when I tried Hoppy Feet from Clown Shoes. Tried a few since and this is the best of the rest. The hops are piney with grapefruit and a good level of bitterness that is balanced by a sweet roasty body. Doesn't taste like it has so high and ABV. DELICIOUS."
"Deep black-brown pour, ruby highlight and a dense , 2 finger, tan head. Sweet, citrusy aroma with notes of fig, cocoa, caramel and vanilla. Flavor is alcohol, pine, slight citrus and some roastiness and chocolate. Oily, medium-full body with moderate carbonation."
"D - Good dark ale, more hoppy than the appearance and smell make it out to be. Stone hits another home run on this brew."
"D: this is pretty heavy. I'd better have antoher!"
"M & D - Very complex and delicious beer. Good carbonation and good medium body and refreshing. Very drinkable"
"I like this beer...it is unusual...like a super hoppy porter. But, the flavors seem to balance themselves nicely. I am surprised at the union here of hops and dark chocolate malts...it is a fine ale, one worth revisiting."
"D - I am not normally big on heavy American hops, but this one is balanced just enough by malt and alcohol to be enjoyable to me."
"D_Bomber does it for me."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong citrus/floral hops, sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of vanilla, and citrus (grapefruit). Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a strong bitterness. Tastes of floral hops, sweet malt, caramel, wood, hint of earthy malt, and slight citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"I've drank about half the bottle and still have no idea what I'm trying to figure out here. It's complex beyond my vocabulary. You haven't lived until you try this beer."
"D: So much flavor you don't want to drink too much or too fast."
"Poured into a pint glass black with a very nice two finger thick off white foamy head. Great retention and lacing. Scent has hop floral notes along with some sugars. The taste is great, a nice hop bitterness with a late developing carmel and smoke sweetness that goes back to a bitter aftertaste. Very complex. The mouthfeel isn't quite what you would think of a strong ale, maybe a little thin for the style. But this does not take anything away from this beer. It actually makes this a very drinkable beer."
"This is a weird one - smells like a CDA, tastes like a hoppy porter. Therein lies the conundrum. Good, not mind-blowing. I did this review while drinking the first 2/3rds of the glass. The last bit still had enough strength to cut through after eating some of Dirty Frank's excellent hot dogs."
"A very well made and interesting beer."
"Drinkability: This is another big winner from Stone. However, I don't see too much of a difference between this and their IRS, except that the IRS seemed sweeter with a lower hop profile. Still a very good brew and an enjoyable sipper."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Totally black pour with nice two-finger caramel colored head with great lacing. Very unuasual, unique earthy nose that's half stout, half IPA. Initially it almost reminds me of soy sauce, with just a touch of black licorice. Lots of malty burnt toffee as well as some subdued citrusy hop notes. Really unique taste that's much like the nose. All the best characteristics of a stout perfectly matched and balanced with the best of an IPA. Subtle roasty, chocolate and coffee matched with bitter, hoppy, citrus, and sweet malts to balance it all out. Mouthfeel is also part creamy stout, part bitter hop bomb. Extremely drinkable for such a big beer. Very complex and unique beer that stands out and defies classification. Can't wait for round 2 if I can find it again..."
"i believe this was a very fresh bottle. i don't have the words to properly describe this beer experience. it's fucking amazing."
"Drinkability was really low. I would struggle through a whole pint of this I fear, and I love IPAs. If you want a hop bomb then this beer is for you. If you want something with the complexity that a black IPA would suggest then I would recommend trying something else."
"A pretty strange and unusual mixture of textures - smoky, bitter, tangy and creamy.  Something that takes a bit of time to get used to, sure, but it seems to work in this case, though.  Especially in this joint."
"Pours an opaque black with huge tan head. Lots of lacing and great head retention. Smells of huge hops, citrus and pine, with some roasted malt. Lots of bitterness, with the roasted malt, a little bit sweet taste. Huge flavour to this. Rich and a little bit creamy, but not as much as some stouts. A very nicely done Cascadian Dark Ale or Black IPA (or whatever you want to call it)."
"Prost!"
"Definitely not one of the better Stone beers I've enjoyed."
"Malty,Piney and powerful."
"A very nice Indian San Diego Dark Hoppy Pale Ale."
"Very drinkable."
"D: overall the beer was quite delicious and drank good but to be honest it taste very similar to other stone brews I've had in the past, there is some type of signiture flavor in most of their brews that I can't pin point; oh well."
"Darker than anything I've ever had from Stone minus their imperial stout. I was expecting a little lighter color. It's nearly porter in color, but a little bit lighter, sort of red. The head was nice and stayed around for a while. The taste was good with a bitter old ale flavor. It reminds me a bit of the german alt style. It is a little fruity with hops but mostly exhibitsa solid malt flavor; caramel, raisin, with a bite of peppery spice. There is very little hops in the scent. It barely has any scent at all, but definitely more malt than hops. The aftertaste is good, and the beer is smooth. I would not guess the alcohol content as the bite is minimal compared to some beers over 8%. Not my favorite Stone, but worth a try, especially if you like this style."
"D. Not the easiest of beers to throw back, but a bomb... no problem. But one is enough. Lots of alcohol."
"I could drink a lot of beer, aside from the higher ABV. This is a style that I like...be it called a strong ale or a CDA in the new parlance!"
"Nice big body, smooth and so drinkable. Love this beer!"
"I'm surprised that an ale this dark was so hoppy - that said, I could definitely have more than one at a time. It went quite well with my grilled cheese sandwich."
"I love hoppy porters and stouts when there is some sense of cohesion between the big malt and hop flavors, but that's altogether absent here."
"oh so smooth. this one goes down easily with no indication of the 8.7% ABV. not traditional at all, which may throw some people off, but it works for me. This one will be copied and imitated over and over again."
"This review is all over the place I think I'm gonna leave it at that."
"D - this was an all right beer. I guess I wasn't expecting the hops aspect of the beer, which was fine, but it caught me off guard. This isn't the best Stone beer I have had, but it was still pretty decent."
"SSR is listed as a Strong Ale here, but I'm sure most will agree that this fits into the new sub-genre of Cascadian Dark Ale or India Black Ale or Black IPA. Whatever it is, I like it. I'm really looking forward to more brewers making beers like this one. I think Deschutes Hop in the Dark is a little better, but since I can't get it in PA, SSR will be my go to in this class."
"Great beer!"
"D- Heavier than I was expecting but not too heavy. The alcohol did not shine through at all. Every sip was more magical than the last!"
"A yummy beer but a mite too Hoppy for the style. I like a more malty strong ale, but still good."
"I think this is one of my least favorite Stone ales. For the hard core IPA drinker, for sure."
"Drinkability> Well, I can't have too much, but darn I would definitely buy another sometime. Quite tasty."
"We had this last year at Stone, and it seemed more vibrant then. Still, a great beer with a very interesting mix of flavors."
"All in all, this was a good brew. The thing that's always intrigued me about Stone is that they make solid brews. Beer that's usually very good, but never great. This beer definitely falls into that category for me. This is a very good brew, but not great. I'd say you definitely should try this at least once."
"D: I like this beer. I like this style. At 8% ABV this beer would kick me in the groin after more than a few, but I could see myself willingly going there, given the awesome blend of hops and malt in this beer. Well done, Stone."
"This beer may not fit everyone's palate, but I see it as a must try. Definitely my #1 favorite beer of all time. Right in front of Pliny the Elder at #2."
"6/8/2012-had an aged 11th Anniversary Ale from September 2007 and it was even smoother than the other bottles I've had, it aged very well. The flavor and nose were full of sweet oaky notes and vanilla, with hints of smoked peat moss, molasses, brown sugar and booze like rum or bourbon. The sweetness ruled the taste, but there was still a lingering smoky bitterness after each sip that left cocoa, toffee and dark chocolate notes. The aging tamed the hops but really brought out the rich malty flavor, which to me was a very welcomed change. This beer still throws a punch as one bomber got me banged up. If you are storing one of these then I suggest cracking it open as it was excellent."
"mouthfeel is nice, but can't score well for drinkability - this is one of the harshest, least drinkable beers i've ever had, albeit both delicious and interesting, but DAMN! this thing is freaking gnarly - could not drink a whole bomber of this beer, no freaking way."
"Excellent creation from Stone. I'm not one for 'balancing' hoppy beers with more malt, as I think it turns them into a barleywine with a lot of hops (I wish there were more beers like Blind Pig). But the high hoppiness combined with a big dose of dark malts works to create something new, different and delicious here. Only fault is that the alcohol is pretty noticeable and gets in the way."
"Update: On subsequent tastings, I have been blown away every time. The head has had less of the creaminess than what I noted the first time, but it's still thick and ever-present.. This beer is a powerhouse of flavor. Top 5."
"The back of the bottle reads, self-righteously, that they ""know their stuff"" at Stone. Yes, they do. They brew great beers and also know that the prevailing trend right now is to the grapefruit bitterness of the many varieties of hops from the Pacific Northwest."
"Great big beer."
"The taste was a full spectrum from roasted malts, coffee, to spicy hops. Very unique. This is not typical of my preferred brews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. I probably went through about five 22 ounce bottles until I could find no more."
"Very distinctive, enjoyable brew here. It actually reminds me of a lower viscosity, less sweet (and more bitter) version of Goose Island's Night Stalker because of the specific flavors found in each of them (roasted malts + pine, tropical fruit, etc.)."
"D: Lots of flavor and complexity and good balance. Easy to relax in to this one despite the abv."
"I will definitely be getting this one again."
"D - Incredible beer, so glad to see it back out on the market, easy to enjoy more than one, but be careful, the ABV can catch you by surprise"
"Tasty but a little harsh on the mouthfeel. The bitterness starts to wear on me after a few sips. In the beginning it was a nice compliment to the bold flavors but now I find it distracting. There is also a booziness from the ABV that you don't taste but can feel after the swallow. A strong start and an above average finish yields a strong well enjoyed brew. Well worth it and by the reviews (A- with 1,026 and counting) I'm not the only one who thinks so."
"One I've gotten more times than I can count-so glad its here to stay in my area. I love this beer!"
"Drinkability is good, I can't wait to finish this."
"D: Easy to drink a bomber, quite delicious, a real pleasure."
"As the beer warms up I still don't get that much malt in the beer, maybe a slight sweetness and a little bit of breadiness, but that's it. There is a nice round medium body to the beer, and I like it. The beer is pretty damn drinkable."
"I recommend this brew to anyone who is an IPA fan, reminds me of a stone styled hop in the dark by Deschutes. A dark bodied malty sweet ipa instead of a lighter floral fruit-sweet ipa. A great contrast between the two styles and further defines the limits of what dark brews can taste like and what hoppy brews can look like."
"Something that never ceases to amaze me is that Stone is spot on with their beers. I find that if I'm ever in doubt about buying a beer, I can always turn to Stone to keep me on edge and satiate my want for an excellent beer."
"I was told by the bartender this was a black IPA so I was excited about trying a new style. Oh well. Poured a nice bark mocha brown color. Smelled piney and citrusy from the hop. Taste was nice with a hop bitterness up front and then a solid malt backbone. What ever style it was, it was good!"
"22oz bottle pours dark brown with a big tan creamy head that stays well with lots of lace. Aromas of pine slight grapefruit and some chocolate and burnt notes. Flavor is mostly caramel and pine but there are grapefruit notes, much roast, and slight chocolate hints. Interestingly complex and honestly quite delightful in the mouth. Feels full in body but very easy to drink. Another fine brew that is worthy of an anniversary celebration! Stone never disappoints!! Great!"
"Another nice find at The Mellow Mushroom in Greensboro, NC. This strong ale shows a thick dark brown with a fair whispy light tan head and very good lacing. The aroma says grapefruit and orange citrus hops, tasteful over a slightly flowery wheat bread idea. The flavor jumps out with a delicious citrus and pine hop blend, so solid yet mellow and inviting. This is solidly medium bodied and it almost pulls out some chocolate flavors at times. Finely carbonated it has a lively but smooth feel that wants to go down the hatch readily. There is a little alcohol presence to keep you mindful...or not so mindful. Very fruity with a bit of bubblegum sweetness and toffee malt. It has a dry finish and the hops linger so nicely. A great beer for any hop fan!"
"Medium bodied witha creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this was very interesting to try and something I look forward to having again."
"Whoaaaa! This beer IS righteously titled. Normally I don't go too much for hoppy dark beers, but this one is GREAT!! Poured with a smallish tan head and a little lace. Color is a very dark almost black brown. Aroma is very hoppy, roasty, cocoa, malt, toffee, iron. Flavor's similar to nose. Hop is not fruity, thank goodness. Great body and carbonation fit the style perfectly. Finish (with good burps!) is like flavor, mostly bitter with a hint of malt sweetness to smooth it out and is of medium length. Session for sure, even though it's so rich. Excellent!"
"D. Surprisingly smooth. The alcohol content burn soon kicks in. Definitely an enjoyable sipper - not one to be rushed or you will be sorry."
"On tap at the brewery 07-10-09. Pours a beautiful dark brown with nice tan head. Great looking beer with a really unique aroma dominated with chocolate and orange. Would have love to tasted this blind as the aromas were a bit confusing to the senses. Pretty well balanced with a nice bitter chocolate finish. My notes are also saying that there was a nice woody aroma and touch of dry wood in the taste, though I'm not sure how that came about."
"The mouthfeel is medium. I am a little disappointed with this one. I've had other ""black IPA's"" that have been hoppy with porter or stout characteristics. This just tastes like an IPA. I prefer the melding of styles with my ""black IPA's""."
"D - Pretty nicely drinkable for the ABV, although the bitterness continued to become stronger and knocked it down a bit as I went."
"Drinkability-Decent, it's not up to Stone's usual standards though; it's a tad of a chore to drink."
"A: Lots of frothy to espresso like head, dark brown to black in color, slight viscosity is noticeable from a swirl of the glass - 4.50, S: Quite a contrast in aromas - loads of charred grains and ash mixed with some citrusy hop aromas, burnt cherry, possibly some anise on the nose - 4.50, T: Dates and figs which add significantly to the sweetness factor, lots of specialty grains - especially chocolate malts and also some coffee grounds, alcohol is noticeable but not disruptive - 4.25, M: Creamy mouth feel - 4.50, D: An very enjoyable and drinkable beer - 4.25"
"Fully bodied, bitter, and a bit on the dry side, but overall seems balanced. Overall this beer has a very rich complexity and is very interesting to taste due to the interesting combination of flavors. Still very hoppy, and very balanced, considering it was reviewed so close to the best by date."
"D- An interesting beer for the style. Malty, yet heavily hopped which I liked. Tastes good and is easy to enjoy. Very Good beer that I easily enjoyed"
"Drinkability is low for the style. I'm not impressed, which is frustrating because I remember it being pretty decent when I tried it as a sample on tap."
"Very good beer. I love it. I am hoping that next year I will be able to put one up side by side with a fresh HopSlam."
"Enjoyed it while it lasted, but wouldn't open another one immediately afterwards."
"I would love to find a clone recipe, for this was a great beer."
"Very cool brew. I am not sure that I even would compare to anything that I have had before."
"I think the bitterness slowed me down a bit, but it mellowed out in the end. I wouldn't hesitate to try this again."
"D: Overall, I like this as a slow sipper. A lot of things are going on in this beer and I""m overwhelmed just thinking about it. Didn't get a chance to try this as an anniversary brew, but sure glad I got to sample it as a fixture. CA here I come..."
"This beer is very drinkable, especially considering the ABV. I particularly enjoy the balance of hops and malts."
"Drinkability: A damn fine beer and another win from Stone. While I don't think most people could handle more than one of these at a time, it is definitely still a world-class brew."
"D - Light enough to quaaf but the really interesting flavors keep you coming back for another sip. Nice."
"(D)- An interesting beer for the style. Malty, yet heavily hopped which I appreciate. Tastes good and is easy to enjoy. A relative easy drinker with a tamer ABV level than usual. Another solid beer from one of my more favorite breweries."
"pours a dark brew just sort of a stout. not opaque but damn near with a smallest head that fades. nose is that of an IPA with some earthiness and coffee in it. palate is surprisingly bitter. peppery but nice. come chocolate and coffee. a mild smoky quality. fruit is raisin that isn't overpowering in comparison to the bitter. a great balance. probably fantastic after a year of cellaring. has a very delicate liquored cherry qualitied that seems like its hiding in the finish that would mature wonderfully."
"Pours a deep dark brown with thin cap of khaki head, leaving decent lacing. The scent is mild, muted hops combined with a muted earthy and muddy backbone with hints of chocolate, nuts, carmel. The taste brings a nice citrusy hop flavor the the front, followed my a smooth and mellow blend of earth, wood, carmel, nuts, dried grain and dense bread. Lighter side of medium bodied, lower carbonation, slightly dry. An all around nice beer whcih doesnt attempt to overpower the senses with any one ingredient."
"T: Full bodied and sweet upfront. Three quarters through the hoppy bitterness starts to breakthrough and explodes with full blown, tongue-cripplingly effect. Hours later the bitterness does not leave your palate."
"Very dark pour, opaque except when held to bright light; it presents a nearly inch-thick head of tan foam on top. The nose is really dominated by hops, earthy and resinous, though lurking underneath is some roasted malt. The flavor, likewise, is mostly hops. There's a good quantity of black patent malt as well, and a touch of roast, but typical of Stone, the emphasis is on the hops. The finish is dry, of course."
"Overall- Nicely done from Stone on this one. I personally love how agressively hopped their beers can be, but I understand that not everyone enjoys that. This one is well balanced and hopheads and maltlovers alike will enjoy."
"i would have it again but i do not think i can have more then one in a sitting grapefuit flavor is to much for me and i do like grapefruit"
"D - With a tiny, tiny bit of alcohol, and the high ABV, a bomber will do. This beer is near perfect, and besides, you don't want to overdo it with this one. Keep it special."
"I really can't get over how impressive Stone Brewing Co. is. Just when I think I'm giving them too much praise and credit, they deliver a beer that surpasses my expectations of them (this happens consistently). Sublimely Self-Righteous works my brain by giving me a whole new take on the so-called ""black IPA"" (it doesn't have to be a malty IPA, it can be a perfect stout with overdrive hops!), while delivering a simply fantastic beer regardless of style. If this beer were called ""Stone Stout"" or ""Stone Barleywine", it would be scoring A or above from me."
"d- really great, i'd drink this again for sure, this is a nice way to celebrate my 200th review. it was a very tasty journey - heres to 300!"
"D: Quite drinkable, yet another fine Stone brew."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable for its strength and intensity. I'd definitely have this one again."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. There are only a few Stone brews that ""WOW"" me, and this is one of them. I am honestly surprised at how high my ratings are, but I stand by them. SSRA is my shit!"
"This is good, and is nicely drinkable, as long as you like hops. Unfortunately, this is quite a bit more hop-forward than I really enjoy my beers to be. I'm not yet worthy, I guess."
"Overall, a very good offering from Stone. Definitely worth a shot if you haven't had it before."
"D- You probably are not worthy of this beer."
"D: The marriage of a barleywine, American brown ale and an IPA all crammed into one, this ale was complex and tasty. A bit rough around the edges as the 8.7% ABV and hop profile do make the brew a little hot, but it does mello a bit when let to come up to room temperature. I'd likely get it again for it's sweet and bitter complexity."
"The beer pours black with a cream-colored head. The aroma is piney hops with roasted malt. I also get a touch of citrus. The flavor is pine, chocolate and roasted malt. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D- not bad drinkableness for something this intence and alcoholic. alcohol content is barely evidenced in the flavor and by the end of a pint i'm starting to get the buzz on. hoppy and tasty but a big brew. sort of a conglomerate of porter, brown ale, and DIPA, this black beauty was well worth the $7 bomber."
"Dark, dark brown with fluffy coffee creamer head floating on top. Elegant but strong looks. Aroma that touches upon hop resin, leaves, spice, sweet malt, slight booze and weirdly reminiscent of soy sauce. Thick, creamy mouthfeel brings on a slew of flavors ranging from syrup, sweet malts, hops, tobacco-esque hop bitterness, slight bitter cocoa, coffee beans. Hop bitterness finishes out the drink and slicks the tongue. Despite the strength of the beer and its flavors, it remains a very drinkable ale that asks to be enjoyed at dusk. A tasty brew that will put some hair on the beer drinker's chest."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer, not sure why it had to be black because the dark malts don't really add anything to the beer underneath the hop character."
"D: This beer is definitely drinkable, very full of flavor. Not sure the flavors going on work well together but it sure is interesting."
"Being as I had been told that it was only going to be available on draft in my area, when I found it in a neighboring town in bottles, I bought em out...and I could happily drink the whole lot of them."
"D- unbelievably drinkable. I want more now. It drinks like an IPA but looks like a stout...I love this so much"
"Pours a dark stout like black with a generous head. Aroma is slightly malty and wort like. Taste is very similar, a bit raw tasting with a bit of grapefruit like hoppiness. I really wanted to like this beer but in the end, one is enough for me and I won't be revisiting it. It was a bit of a chore to finish the entire bottle."
"Pours stout-ish with a finger and a half of dense, tan head that recedes down to a ring with an island in the middle. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. It smells like a malty hop soaked in grapefruit juice and it tastes like a hoppy grapefruit. When I aerate it in my mouth I get bitter, dark fruits. I love it. It's viscous and it finishes sweet and dry. It's a strong, interesting beer but there is nothing offensive about it at all. I'll take pleasure in pushing it on friends who are in the mood for something new. Very worthy of my first review here."
"D- In summary-This is a very hoppy black IPA-I wouldn't say its balanced-but the malt is not hiding. And with anything IPA I expect it to be very hoppy. This brew is pretty aggressive and very good overall. ABV is completely hidden by the flavors this brew exceeds my expectations for this hybrid style."
"Purchased this at bootleggers in Thopsham, ME. Glad to see this there as was a nice tasting beer. If there was ever a beer that could be clasified as black IPA this would be it. Dark black and lots of hops this beer has it and should be a must have for anyones portfolio."
"Pours a deep opaque black with an ample tan head. Generally malty in nature with bitterness coming from what seems to be roasted and chocolate malts. Taste is similar with a chocolaty malt flavor and bitterness some coffee notes as well. Not overpoweringly chocolate but definitely good. Feel is smooth and medium bodied, with a slight fullness. Carbonation is light and tickles the senses well. Overall a very good beverage."
"Better luck next time."
"Well, I now wish I'd consumed this a year ago, but based on the reviews it seemed to be still blazing strong. Decent enough beer, but I'd drink there if you have them."
"A almost black body with a quickly dying tan head and minimal lace. Intense hoppy smell but there is a noticeable aroma of roasted and cocoa malt. Like a hoppy coffee stout this beer has a medium body that is smooth and a tad creamy with a mixture (heavier on the former) of roasted coffee and chocolate malt (gives a lil' bit of sweetness) and citric hops. Also a minor note of black cherry and other plush fruit. Easy to drink ale that is meant to relax w/ after dinner."
"22oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. These beer pours completely black when in the glass. It comes out a very dark brown when the liquid gets a little thin, but overall it's pretty black and opaque. The beer produces a tan head with some decent lacing to it, the way beer should look. A very good looking brew. The smell is truly exquisite. It's complex, but gets to the point. Overall it's completely dominated by the hops, but the malts make themselves noticeable as well. Roasted malts with a slight smokey smell that is covered by a delicious hop aroma. A little more pine than citrus in my opinion. The taste is truly outstanding, but I wish I had the opportunity to grade it a 4.9 I think that's what I go with in that situation. Like most beers of this style it's very hoppy, the good thing here is it's not to overwhelming. Along with the great hoppy taste is the good malted flavor. It has a great malted taste much like the smell, with a slight smokey taste. Wonderfully balanced overall. Mouthfeel is good, not quite full bodied in my opinion, but pretty close. Has a slight dry bitter finish from the hop, very good. Extremely drinkable beer, could drink this rain or shine on any occasion. A wonderful beer to have on standby, and you should!"
"On tap at the Brattleboro, Vermont Brewer's Festival on May 22, 2010. There is a mahogany dark brown pour with some red hues and a two-inch puffy tan head. Hops are the lead ingredient in the aroma but it seems very well-balance and not overdone. Hops also tend to be the first thing caught on the tongue but there is also a rather molasses-like sugar-sweetness in there. Definitely not as bitterly hopped as some strong ales. This one tends to be a lot mellower than other strong ales. Pretty good."
"Taste: Rich and bitter and pretty darn good. Herbal/floral/grassy hops with a nice roundness and sharp bitterness. A healthy helping of ripe pear and grapefruit oil that tickles the throat. Molasses and caramel and some barely perceptible clove with nice dark malt flavors. Mocha/Coffee emerges as it warms. Slightly interesting play between the dark, slightly roasted malts and the bitternes but the bitterness is a just a bit harsh and hurts drinkability and the mouthfeel is pretty oily. Finish is grassy with an astringent edge, grainy, bitter coffee, residual orange oil."
"I am not a fan of this at all. I did not get any of the malty notes others have mentioned. Just a black beer with to much soapy hops. No nuance or balance. I would not recommend this."
"Long finish. ABV feels about right on this one. Kinda looks like a stout, smells like an IPA and drinks like a really good brown ale."
"D) Another good brew from Stone. I'd have another."
"Alcohol is evident, tasting stronger than its percentage. This is a tasty and drinkable brew in moderation."
"D- Just really good. Very unique and a little puzzling. When you pour it you think it is a stout, when you smell it you think it is a Barleywine, and when you taste it you think that it is a brown ale with a hint of coffee stout that finishes like a strong ale. I could easily drink two bombers and feel that it is worthy of the name it is given."
"D: Hell, even my burps are delicious. What do you think it's like going down? If I had this for every day of my life, well, for one I'd have an awesome beer belly, but secondly, I don't think you could find me tired of this taste. At least give me 20 years with this stuff, then maybe I'll reconsider."
"D - nicely drinkable beer, very complex but not in any way overpowering"
"As this is my first 'Black IPA'/'Cascadian Dark Ale', there is a definite novelty. I like it, but wouldn't drink more than a bomber at a time even without taking the alcohol content into account."
"Served from bottle into a Spaten mug. Pours dark dark brown almost black with a one-finger light tan head. The aroma is mainly of a slight hoppy note. The flavor on the other-hand is of weak hops with a subtle nutty flavor. It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. There was no apparent lacing. Overall this is a very nice brew as with most Stone's. Definitely worth trying if you have not before..."
"Taste is a like too coffee-chocolate for my taste, but not sweet. Other ale styles I like better, but no question this is a great beer. If you love this style, you'll be in heaven."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. As I wrap up this review I wish I had gotten a second, post review celebration bottle to enjoy. Most certainly will I enjoy this sublime and self-righteous ale!"
"D - Man I may have to have this again but I am pretty sure its the hoppiest beer I ever had from Stone. They are know for angry beers and this one had some good rage."
"D- A pretty cool creation overall; very complex but well balanced. Definitely worth trying."
"Drink: Interesting brew. Characteristics of an IRS but slighly thinner as hops dominate and roasted malts are less pressent. Very drinkable."
"Can self-righteous be considered a beer quality? This brew earns that right.. The hops, while dominant, never overwhelm things. The malt helps balance things out yet never get in the way. The alcohol is kept in check as well. This brew is quite the achievement. It goes down smooth while never overpowering. The folks at Stone have crafted another classic."
"This beer was black, like a stout, with a thick tan head and abundant lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, sweet chocolate, and flowers. Nice melange of chocolate, roasted malt, and pine in the taste. The hops really intensified in my mouth. Nice balance of sweet chocolate and bitter hops. Will drink more of these."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer from Stone. I had this when it was the Anniversary beer and loved it then. Extremely glad they brought this back, at $6 a bomber, this is a great deal."
"The 9% is noticeable but not distracting. Taste is even more bitter than expected, with a terrific mouthfeel and finish. I feel it's a bit too heavy on the IBUs for my taste. Ever since I fell in love with the elixir that is barleywine, other styles seem to fall short. Of the Stone offerings I've tried, I'll take the arrogant, the double bastard and the barleywine over this, but this one is still definitely goood shiiit (^_<)~★"
"I think this beer deserves a perfect score for sure. I can't find anything wrong with this beer. I am very pleased with my experience indeed."
"Overall very tasty but powerful. One's good, though I could easily see myself ordering it again in the future."
"p.s. another swallow as this slightly warms and i get the dark sweet dried fruit sense i get in some really good imperial stouts....has much to offer as you try to take this one in slowly and experience its many nuances."
"Deliciously hopped sweet goodness. The hops are spectacularly citrusy in a truly American fashion. Sweet roasted barley and delicious thick grainy body. The drinkability is excellent."
"Drinkability: The feel of this beer is great and helps make it evaporate, but this is a bit hop-heavy and does not really have any distinguishing characteristics over AB or other strong ales."
"Poured into a tulip glass from a bottle that says best 6/29/10. They love their hops at Stone and I love them for that. Normally you would expect a beer this dark to be sweet and heavy. But this one comes across like some crazy hybrid of just about everything Stone does well and the result is awesome. Pours fairly thick, like a porter say, and as dark as a stout but with more carbonation. A nice, thick toasted brown head forms. The scent is almost all hops with notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is a beautiful melange of hops, dark chocolate, coffee, and raisins. Not too sweet and not too bitter. The good amount of hop bitterness gives it a lighter body and cleaner finish than an imperial stout, making it a very drinkable strong ale."
"220z bomber. Pours nearly back with slight reddish glow at the bottom when held to the light. Smells hoppy with malty notes and a strong hint of charred wood. The flavor is dominated by dry hops and toasted malt with a slight smack of cherry cough drops on the finish. The mouth is dry most the way through, the slight sweetness at the end, but that diverse of a mouth from tongue to throat. It's quite drinkable, with the alcohol well hidden, but the predominant woodiness would prevent it from being a session beer. Solid overall, but rather mundane compared to the stars in the Stone universe."
"Overall, not what I was expecting for some reason, but pretty good. I enjoy this a little more than the score indicates. The weight for my score in the mouthfeel deducts more points than I think it should. Probably in the neighborhood of a 3.9 IMO."
"Still a sipper for me. I like bitter beers, but this just didn't sit so well for me."
"This beer is still drinkable. Alcohol is more prevalent since the beer is so unpronounced now. Carbonation is lively, I could tell immediately from the loud hiss as I opened the bottle. Definitely past its prime though."
"D: goes down a lot easier than you'd think for this abv. alcohol is well-hidden and the dryish hoppy finish helps in this regard."
"pours a jet black color with spare off white head and good lacing. smells heavily hoppy and bitter although wasn't as hoppy in flavor mostly just bitter with a slightly roasted nutty carmel taste. the finish is extremely bitter. not nearly as full bodied as i would have thought by the look. this beer is delcious and goes down very easy. would definitely try again and would highly recommend."
"This was definitely a very complex, iconoclastic beer that I will continue to buy and enjoy. However, by means of comparison, I think that Arrogant (and Double) Bastard are better and more balanced brews."
"Bottom line, it is a fun beer! Drinking beer can be a fun experience and Stone did a great job creating this unique beer. It will not be a beer in my weekly rotation but I appreciate the beer for what it is...a unique style that should be distributed as a limited edition."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. It is interesting in a good way because it pushes style barriers. Although I don't see myself purchasing this beer too often it was still a great purchase and one I would recommend. A great offering from Stone Brewing."
"Overall probably the best black IPA beer I have had."
"Verdict: The emerging ""Black IPA"" style is one of my favorite new styles of the last decade, and I have to say Stone have put together the best one I've tried yet. Tasty, balanced well, and full of character, Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale has earned its cocky attitude."
"D: Quiet good but I wouldn't say its something I would drink weekly. Best saved for special occasions when you want a deeply hoppy experience."
"American Strong Ale? American Stout? Black IPA? Whatever. This is a playful, interesting, damn tasty beer that successfully marries big-time hoppy grapefruit with roasty malt. Enjoy it."
"Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, and the bitterness lingers in the mouth a bit to long. A big beer like this is hard to call drinkable, but it certainly is easy to go back to. I like it a lot."
"D-Not the easiest drinking beer I've had, but pretty enjoyable and definitely something new and different for me."
"8.7% alc/vol and you wont notice any in the taste. very sophisticated brew from those Beer Demons at stone. Not something you would overall drink a lot of."
"I'm really digging the contrasting chocolate and big bitter hops coming outta these Black IPAs and this one just might be my favorite of the style. Good stuff, hope it becomes more readily available..."
"D - Very surprising balance here. I could drink a lot of this. The novelty in combination of flavors isn't something I'd want to revisit frequently (personal preference only), but this is a very good beer."
"Overall, I was happy I picked this up and will look for it again when it's fresh."
"Nice balance and a good hoppiness give it something I would probably not be able to drink a whole bottle of but still enjoy."
"As far as introductions to a style go, my venture into Black IPA's was a good one. I will be on the lookout of more from this style to try. I personally will be buying up more SSR in the future and passing over the perennial top 100 Ruination in the process. It really is that good. Try a bottle if you get the chance too and prepare to be astonished. HIGHLY recommended."
"Definitely piqued my interest in darker ales."
"D- Still quite drinkable, despite its unbalanced hoppiness. The alcohol is very well hidden throughout."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Jet black pour with a medium white head, slight lacing. It has big pine and grapefruit notes on the nose. The flavor is lots of pine and tropical fruit, from first sip to aftertaste. The flavors are strong and linger for a long time. The beer is medium/full in body and has good carbonation. And with everything stone is aggressively hopped, a good thing. A very good black IPA."
"Sooo good. I LOVE this freaking beer. I can say hands down, this is the BEST Black IPA I have ever had! It has SUCH an incredible balance of being a hugely hopped IPA with a soft, sweet malty balance. Mmmm mmmm good."
"D- it just keeps screaming for more"
"This is an extremely complex brew, moreso than most will give it credit for."
"Pours almost jet black with a thick layer of tan head. Piney hops prominent in nose; aromas of coffee and chocolate also present. Taste is big, boozy, and complex. The combination of bitter, resinous hops and rich roasted malt is interesting and new to me; the only other ""black IPA"" I've tried is Southern Tier's Iniquity, but SSSRA is more aggressive on all fronts. Sort of reminds me of Arrogant Bastard (one of my favorites), but with more of everything. Another winner from Stone."
"Fun beer out of a Firkin."
"Overall= Overall, I am very pleased with this beer, malt monster with hidden bitterness. . . how Stone."
"D-could have a few of these and would be a great hoppy beer for the darker months. The hops linger on the tongue but for a 8.7% ABV fairly drinkable. Stone's beers tend to have a low finishing gravity and that helps in the drinkability category."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a lower level of carbonation. Another great beer from Stone."
"This was an excellent beer, lots of flavor, but quite filling."
"Drinkability - Nice. Liked it quite a bit. Great flavor profile: clean hop taste balanced with roasty/chocolatey malt. I will say it's got more alcohol warmth than I expected. Still great, will do again!"
"D: Palate exhaustion is possible with this one, so it's not exactly a session beer in the truest sense of the word. Still, drinking a few bombers of this one wouldn't be so bad, would it?"
" D- Although the bottle reeks of arrogance the beer inside is good. The big hop flavor has lots of nice depth with a little black malt for support. This is my first beer purchased in Chicago, would it taste better if I had to drive 2hr to buy it? Luckily I don't have to find out."
"Pours a very dark brown (almost black) with a large off-white head, good retention and lacing. Nice carbonation. Nose is an IPA - hops, citrus, pine with some roasted malt undercurrent. Taste surprises. The pine and bitterness are there, but so is some coffee and chocolate. Medium body. The finish is some bitterness but not overwhelming. There is also some alcohol warmth. This beer was a nice surprise and I will be seeking it out, when available."
"Really nicely done, and in fact pretty spectacular, as you'd expect from Stone. Craves my hop and malt fix simultaneously."
"this one definitely grew on me. i wasn't blown away at first, but everything is in balance. the abv is right where it should be, you get some sweetness, some bitterness... it just works. i would definitely buy this again."
"Hmmm, taste is way more complex and interesting than I thought it would be thinking of some black IPAs I have had in the recent past. Heavenly roasted malt mixes with a very nice hop flavor. Bitterness is there, but not over the top in any way. Bit of wintergreen mintiness comes in and is followed by an almost chocolaty malt flavor. Very smooth for a black IPA and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. ABV is well hidden but still lets you know it is up there. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would, and definitely would encourage any good beer lover to try it."
"D-High, so high. Try it for yourself... please."
"D: As anyone would expect of a Stone offering, this is boldly flavored and even more boldly hopped. Bitter and almost too boozy, but this pulls off the elusive ""Black IPA"" better than most. It doesn't tiptoe around, but sometimes that's a nice thing. This is a big, unique, and very freshly hoppy brew."
"definatly a drinkable beer, alcohol is hardly noticable, but this one bomber is prolly all i need in one sitting, this is for sure a good beer, and i would recommend to all ipa and stout lover a like. however in my eyes this is more of an ipa than anything. im interested to see what they will call this beer in the future as black american ipa has just been added to the beer styles list."
"22oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Poured the color of cola with a dense, three inch mocha-colored head. Some red highlights revealed around the base when backlit. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy skim that coalesces around the shoulders. Generous bands and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals lots of malt, brown sugar and molasses off the pour. Out of the glass some light hops aromas come across in the back. Taste follows nose, but the hops bitterness really asserts itself at the back and lingers between quaffs, slightly detracting from the experience. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a level background carbonation and a slightly creamy texture. Not a bad brew and reasonably priced at $6.99, but the lingering bitterness was a little off-putting for me."
"This beer is a beast. Absolutely love it. Pours a great black, tar looking body. A thick 2 inch khaki head is on top. Lacing is present til its time to refill. Smell completely catches you off guard with a left hook, your nose gets hit with a wonderful blend of citrus-floral smelling hops and a wonderful caramel malt. It tastes of a hop - malty fist fight ending with a wonderful chocolatey knockout. Full bodied with a perfect bitter. Very drinkable."
"Pretty good beer here, definitely think the nose was the best part of this beer, highly unexpected given the pour. Have had on tap and from the bottle and both were pretty damn good..."
"Drinks proper for 8.7% abv. Slight alcohol detected, but as expected."
"Coffee colored with russet highlights and an airy tan head that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Citrus fruity hops and roasty cocoa blend perfectly in the nose. Huge pine sap simcoe hop flavor with the nice roasty fudge flavor of carafa or black patent malt. The flavors are in perfect harmony with one another, it's rich and bitter all at once. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. One of the best IMO."
"D- easy to finish and i wish the glass was larger. ive tried this not too long ago when it was stone 11, glad i can try it fresher now. look for a bottle review soon. im so glad that stone is on the shelves here."
"Enjoyed every bit of the glass. Highly recommended."
"The aroma is very hoppy with both pine and citrus as well as a toasted caramel malt. The appearance is black with a large foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a huge hop kick but not a super astringent one. The palate is thin but smooth from carbonation. Overall the beer is good but a bit too hoppy for me."
"D - Not all too high, but something nice if you're tired of straight-up hop bombs or sweet stouts. I'm not going to seek this one out but if it's in front of me, I'll drink it."
"D: I'll finish off the growler but I'm starting to feel it after too glasses."
"edit: This review was written in 2010. As of 2014, this beer is much more common, and I'm quite happy, as it's become one of my go-to, favorite American beers. I have revised my ratings accordingly. I feel that this beer is the epitome of what modern American craft breweries are capable of bringing to the table."
"D: Wow, this starts out as a great beer. But it's also a fatiguing beer. It's so big and aggressive, that it's not easy to finish a 22oz bottle in one sitting. But it's still a really nice beer and I'm glad I can get this on a regular basis."
"Overall, this is my least favorite Stone beer I have had to date. Hops were incredibly bitter and not balanced to what I thought. I had an IPA directly after this and it tasted like water. I had no idea this beer would be like this. I think they were too aggressive on this one and I will not be buying this again anytime soon..."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. 2 fingers of light tan head. Black and sticky looking. Smells of mango, peaches, citrus hops, coffee and alcohol. A little hot on the nose, but otherwise perfect. Tastes like mango, bitter hop flavor, and a bit of toasted malt, vaguely coffee-like. Slightly sweet on the finish, but mostly bitter chocolate and hop. Alcohol is prevalent, but imminently drinkable for a beer at 8.7 abv. Delicious."
"I enjoyed this more than my compadre, who tastes a 60/40 blend of Tomaco Porter and Coffeed Ruination. Silly friend."
"I've only had a couple Black IPAs (Well I guess I can call them American Style India Black Ales since the brewers Association revised the style guidelines today) and they have been all over the board in terms of successfully blending the flavors together. This one is my favorite of the bunch so far."
"Pours very dark brown with a sudsy tan head. Smell is super crisp, citrusy, and sweet. A bunch of grapefruit in the taste, and other assorted hoppy layers. Hard to believe all this is coming from such a dark brew. The malt is pretty subdued, but does add a mellowness the body and finish. Bitterness expectedly rears up at the end. Maybe a little clash of characters, and except for a touch of alcohol burn, drinks quite easy for 8.7%"
"Pours a dark brown/mahogany color, with a good tan head. Nice piney hoppy aromas compete with undertones of roasted malt. On the palate, this one boasts a good malt backbone, with roasted malt, cocoa, dark chocolate easily mingling with some good pine/citrus hop flavors. A very nicely balanced beer, and one that is way to dangerous drinkable for its ABV. Excellent"
"Dispite the 8.7% I feel I could put back one after another and still ask for more."
"D: Very good. I recently had a ST Iniquity, which is considered a DIPA, but, in my opinion, this beer is much more accurate representation of the style than Iniquity. However, this beer decides to be classified, I believe any hophead would find it to be quite drinkable."
"D: wow, this beer is somewhat of a paradox .. its pitch black- tastes like a big IPA- has some touches of porter/stout like qualities, but it all comes together with the hops. Very nice brew, will drink again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily, but somewhat thin."
"All in all a solid product from an excellent brewery that is worthy of praise. Poured a fairly tame head, some solid roasted malt aroma, damn near a stout in my opinion. Fairly bitter after-taste, and definitely alcohol heavy. Certainly worth a try; if nothing else, Stone always delivers with entertaining bottling. Nice mix of hops as well. A strong beer, not for the faint of heart - but that is how Stone likes it."
"Overall I don't have much more to add here. This is a good beer, one it might be interesting to age, but it doesn't quite hit that elusive sweet spot for me."
"The so called black IPAs seem to be more gimmicks than anything, it seems like no brewers have taken the time to make the perfect recipe for it."
"Aaaand it tastes pretty much like it smells: interesting, but hugely offbalanced. There's some herbs thrown in there, along with the big giant alpha of citrusy west coast hops. That's nice. The whole front half is excellent, actually, but then in the back it's a thick, syrupy malt that's just not all that great. Overall there's a lot more good than bad but the bad still spoils much of the good."
"Poured a fantastic opaque black with some excellent head and nice lacing. Very deep malty scent, huge sweetness with a hint of bitterness in the nose. Great taste, a deep and malty hit, slight roastiness, with an excellent hop hit at the end to balance it all. A wonderfully smooth beer with no alcohol tinge even at over eight percent. An excellent brew."
"Cheers!"
"over all this is not my favorite beer, but it is definitely delicious and worth trying. i would most definitely buy this beer again."
"First beer I had at new good beer bar in Cambridge Lord Hobo. Caught my eye as a black IPA - my new favorite style. On tap into 12 oz tulip glass. Pours black with creamy off whie head. Lots of lacing going down. Very nice. Smell is mainly floral to me. Taste is great but I was having a hard time pinning it down. Citrus, coffee, roasted. Recent reviews describing it as ipa up front and stouth at the end are dead on - wish I had come up with that on my own. Thin but not watery feel with nice warming feel from the alcohol. Excellent brew but one is good for me. Already feelin this one."
"I like the idea behind this beer, and where they are trying to go with it. Intentions are good. Dark, bitter, malty, fruity. It is a cross between an IPA and a stout from what I can tell. It's good, a very strong beer, complex, with a strong finish, sort of coffee-like at the end, leaves a slight after taste. I must admit, at the first sip, I was disappointed, I have learned to expect great things from Stone, but after I started to drink it, it grew on me, and I enjoyed it. Great pour/appearance, consistency. For the price they charge, I am not sure I'd buy this again, don't get me wrong, it's a solid beer, but it is over-priced, I think you could get alot better value for the money. I probably wouldn't get it again, mainly because of the price not taste."
"drinkability: superb.... a new fav of mine"
"D - This one holds up well. Ive had it in a bomber. I'd have to say it's even better on tap with a bit of age on it."
"D: If you like IPA's you love this beer. Very good hoppy brew from Stone. It's more of a dark IPA than a strong ale. I can only handle one of these at a time. I wouldn't drink this all the time but it is something I wouldn't mind coming back to."
"I need to trade for another one of these or maybe age a Sublimely Self Righteous."
"Pours a dark ruby mahogony with a tan frothy head. The head is large with lacing that lasts a long time. The smell is a very strong citrus hops with some pine aromas. The taste is a mixture of pine and citrus hops. A very good mixture with alcohol and bread yeast that makes a very tasty beer. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. Another in the long line of very good Stone beers."
"Overall this is another good beer by Stone. Again Stone puts out another beer I like, but nothing to go out of my way for. I guess I am a little confused with my styles. This is classified as an American Strong Ale, but I thought it was a Black IPA until I read the description. What ever it is, the beer is solid and would recommend it to hop lovers."
"A solid brew with interesting flavors and roast. It's hard for Stone to do wrong."
"This beer has characteristics of a black IPA and a barleywine - I can sense Double Bastard and Old Guardian in the mix. Next time my fridge is nearing empty I'll pick up a bomber of Sublimely Self-Righteous."
"D - Wow, this beer impresses from the first whiff of the aroma and doesn't let up until long after the last drop is gone. The hop aroma is spectacular with a very intense and fresh pine note that is much less colored by dark malt than I would have expected based on the style and the color. The flavor is quite a bit darker and more typical of the style, though no less excellent. There is a very nice balance between caramel malts and citrus hops as well as between harsh, acrid bitterness and a subtle, restrained sweetness that appears at just the right moments to encourage your palate to endure the assault and keep the beer drinkable. This is one of the most surprising, complex, and well balanced American strong ales that I have come across and it is one of Stones best efforts (which is obviously saying a lot). A must try."
"this is quite an interesting beer from stone, but not one i could drink all the time. considering the higher abv and strong hop character i'd say you'd be done after 1 or 2 of these. ipa fans will love this, everyone else has quite the adventure ahead of them."
"tastes."
"D- Delicious."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, good balance upfront, with a slightly bitter aftertaste, which I enjoy."
"Smell combines all sorts of complex hops and dark malt bitter-sweet odors with high-octane ethanol. Only the yeast hides from strenuous sniffing. Taste is just totally perfect. We hardly want to swallow, the mouth-feel is so smoothly satin-lined comfy cozy unctuous. We had to get a bag of gourmet pretzels to eat with this drink it was so powerfully persistent in its sweet malty bitter aftertaste the palate begs mercy. At $7 per pint, the price (and yes, I've read the blogs where rich dudes claim you shouldn't ever consider expense in ""drinkable"" considerations) is too steep for us to want more than one pint per day; but the brew itself is so extremely intense, we wouldn't want to indulge in more than a single pint even if we didn't both have to get back on our tandem bike and pedal 3 miles steep uphill to get home with it glowing darkly like a black hole star in our contented bellies. Generally I disapprove of sending beer long-distance (sorry! mental problems with diesel transport interfere with my palate), but thanks, Stone, for the audacity of shipping that truly sublime ale all the way from San Diego to Ithaca!"
"Overall, even with all the hop flavors subdued, the strong roasted malt and bittering hops still make for a great flavor profile. Very nice balance here a well. Ages much better than most beers with such a strong hop profile."
"I enjoy it. Highly drinkable and really for the hops lover."
"Overall, pretty decent. Its an ipa that isn't. If your an ipa search this out."
"Another over hopped beer from Stone, this one could be a case of a little less would be a lot more. This one just doesn't stand out from the rest of their offerings."
"D: Very drinkable and well made."
"D - Very drinkable for such an assertive brew. Robust yet refined and beautifully layered."
"This tastes just like a hoppy west coast ipa... there is a good amount of malty sweetness but it is still VERY hoppy. It is hard to reconcile the flavor with the color but if I close my eyes I consider this an above average ipa. Mouthfeel is fairly viscous and this beer hides the alcohol very adroitly behind the substantial hoppiness."
"D- Overall, I enjoyed my first bottle.Very drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden. Wouldn't have guessed that this offering was 8.7% ABV. Looking forward to having the second bottle that I have purchased in the near future."
"I could have a couple of these. Its a little rough around the edges, yet drinks quite well."
"pretty laid back for stone, and not at a price to break the wallet, looking not to destroy the taste buds but have a nice beer with a mild hop kick ? try some."
"D - This is a slow drinker, Don't taste the alcohol which is good for a higher-ish ABV beer. This is an enjoyable beer but I wasn't blown away by it like I expected."
"In total a very high quality offering from Stone.... in their catalouge I put it slightly below their 13 aniv. ale and their RIS and slightly above arrogant bastard. Will be looking to get my hands on this one again."
"D - This beer is a wonderful sipping beer."
"*This really needs to be tried at cellar-room temp. 15deg Celcius would not be too warm. Too cold and this is just extremely hoppy, bitter and astringent."
"D - This was very interesting...I wouldn't even know how to classify this one but it was great...bold malt flavors pairing nicely with bright citrus hop flavors...another well done brew by Stone"
"This brew is certainly easy to drink, with plenty to offer the senses. This is a delicious beer at a great price."
"This is basically a black DIPA, and reminds me a lot of Sublimely Self-Righteous. Kinda wish I'd tried them back to back."
"D - dont get me wrong, this is a damn fine Strong Ale...not shy by any means. to a fault, one after one glass down, i feel like my mouth has been beat up. i will definitely seek this out again, when im in the mood for some delicious punishment."
"Medium bodied and surprisingly quite dry. Wish it was a bit more carbonated to add life to the mouthfeel. Short and sweet finish."
"Drinks great-zero hint of its 8.7%-not what I would call sessionable but definitely very drinkable."
"D-Drinkable? Sure, and while this is not one I'd do back to back, I'll definately score one of these again. To me, Stone has become a bit of a one trick pony (albeit, a highly skilled, high quality one) but I always look forward to their one offs and occasional brews. I dig when someone breaks the mold (This type of mouthfeel with this kind of hopping, appearance and taste? Come on!) and so, while a bit of an oddball, there will always be a place for this one in my cellar."
"This one had a bit of age on it. Better late than never I suppose. As soon as I popped the cap, hoppy aromas smacked my face. Beautiful cola brown pour with a nice light mocha head. Swirl bings a bit of that back up. Taste is almost all hops, but a bit more of an aftertaste. Some stone fruits, almost a back taste of prunes, brown sugar. Subtle though, because it is the hop power that shine through, and a bit too much for my liking. Not that it matters because the mouthfeel is so smooth. Like many Stone beers this has a smooth and full body that lend itself to easy drinking. Alcohol is a nonissue. The only thing holding you back is your feeling about hoppy beers. This was gone in no time. I prefer this to a double IPA, which is just too much hops for me to take any more. This and Stone's Cali will take care of my little hop fixes nicely."
"Falls somewhere between a barleywine and a black IPA. Big and winey, but still very drinkable."
"It pours a clear, dark brown body with a dense beige head on top. It has a nice aroma with chocolate, coffee, sweetness and dried fruits, as well as a lovely hop profile with pine, resin and citrus, mostly orange. Chocolate and coffee flavor, rather burnt, with fruity hop flavors, citrus notes, pine and resin. Full, rather dry mouthfeel, and a long, piney and resiny finish with citrus. This is one of those lovely beers with layers and layers of aroma and flavor. The aroma being the best of those though. I'm happy they modeled this beer after the 11th Anniversary ale...It was my favorite Stone beer to date."
"It pours black as cola with a thick sandy head. Smell of wonderful hoppyness. While being fairly strong it's imposibly smooth going down albeit intensely hoppy. This one is deffinetly worth a repeat. This goes well with a sweet and meaty entree like say honey bbq wings"
"Bottle courtesy of Irishboy, thanks Richard! Pours deep, deep brown letting some light in around the edges. The head is toffee coloured, frothy, and I like how long it lasted in my Stone IPA glass. This beer shows aromas of fresh hop flowers, coffee beans, vanilla, grapefruit, and some smokey, dark chocolate. The flavour profile is uniquely Stone's. There's a hop/grapefruit/citrus component leading into a porter like dark chocolate/coffee middle. It is also quite roasty with just a small amount of toffee sweetness towards the end. The finish is chalky, astringent, dry. Coffee bean, hoppy lingering aftertaste with an espresso bitterness. Quite a treat. Thanks for sending this my way Richard"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D- Overall, I'm a huge fan of this one. Definitely worth seeking out. Highly Recommended!"
"the bitter hops it's a mouthful."
"Drinkability - This is a great sipping ale and with its relatively low alcohol content for the style means you'll be able to have more than one beer this night."
"D/M: Fairly drinkable for the strength; super creamy and smooth, love the mouthfeel."
"This was nearly identical to SSR, but without as much lacing. Not my favorite Stone offering, but an interesting experience nonetheless."
"This is a big beer with decent drinkability. I'm not about to pound a sixer of this, but a bomber will do just fine."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable beer and the ABV is not distracting."
"another great brew from Stone"
"I have high expectations for anything Stone produces, so I'm probably a bit more critical as a result. This is an interesting beer - residing in some between-styles realm. I'd probably peg is closest to a black IPA. Nice hopping and would like to have seen just a bit more character here. Nicely moderated roasted malt flavor."
"Cheers."
"Drinakabillity: Lovely hop taste and aroma. Strong proof. Who cares the taste makes you want to have more."
"Picked up another bottle of this last weekend and it must have been a lot fresher then my previous one. Very hop bitter and quite delicious. Really suprised me this time."
"A deep red full bodied ale that barely allows any light to pass through her. A near brown head forms lacing all the way down the glass. I poured the brew quite aggressively and the thin cap of head is all the remains after the large bubbled cloud has quickly gone. The smells and aroma are pleasant but not what I was expecting from Stone.... is that too meant to be sublime? I was waiting for a punch to the nostrils with hops and grain. I was quite delighted by the taste however. Near 9% ABV and the most I get is notes of coffee and sharp hop bitterness that clings to the back of the tongue long after the sip has passed. The is a very simple tasting brew to me. Dark roasted flavors come to mind with each taste, but the hop bitterness dominates."
"D: While not sessionable, this beer does go down quite smooth, especially for a fairly high abv..."
"D: The alcohol is no more or less present than it was initially, and the beer is still quite good. I liked it better fresh, obviously, but this one has held up surprisingly well."
"d- I really liked this strong ale. I thought the taste was very complex and interesting, and I really liked the roasted malt and chocolate flavors. I would definitely buy this again."
"Pours very dark, almost completely opaque with just a little red around the edges when held up to the light. Slightly tan head with great lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, pine and dark malt sweetness. Taste is very well balanced with plenty of citrus and tropical fruit hop character and a nice, slightly roasty malt sweetness. Dark malts seem well incorporated with just a little bit of graininess in the finish and some alcoholic warmth. Very tasty and silky smooth. This is a very tasty beer, and while not exactly a session beer, does go down fairly easily. An excellent brew."
"Thanks to CaveDave for the pleasure of enjoying this one."
"IPAs aren't my favorite style. Yes, I do enjoy a good one (such as Dogfish), but I'm no hop head...I prefer malts. Given that, this IPA-styled brew still amazed me. It's a bit like Picasso - it doesn't end up being what it seems. It surprises you on two levels. The appearance and taste are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Then on top of that, both elements are fantastic in their own right. It looks like a glorious after-dinner stout, but tastes like a top-notch, flavorful and summery IPA. Definitely one of the coolest beers out there. I may not end up buying it much, because it's a bit intense, but it sure impressed me a ton."
"This is easily the best beer I've tried in months, and I try quite a few each month! How about a round of applause for Stone?"
"This is another one of those unique brews that satisfies completely. Super sweet to the nose and then a bitter smack in the face. Rich caramel head and smooth finish. I really dug the uniqueness of this beer. When poured, the the jet black visual instantly makes you think you are about to drink a porter. I couldn't believe the difference between the smell and taste. I just found out that Stone will be brewing this beer year round so I'll definitely have it on tap all the time."
"Nice brew. Another job well done by Stone."
"I don't think that Mitch and Stone could have sent me a better brew. This is fantastic. As a ""sub-style," Black IPA's always strike a cord with me, and this is a particularly great one."
"D-very interesting taste to this, very dark malty, almost smokey. some hops but very faint (lots of age mellowed those out i'm sure). great mouthfeel, complex but nice!"
"I had at d.b.a. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn out of a gravity dispense cask. Out of the many cask brews that I've tried, this might've been the best. It's almost a perfect IPA. It's very dark, almost black like Guinness. Perfectly balanced with hops and a citrus/fruity mix to it. Absolutely awesome."
"I bought my bottle down in KY, at Party Source in Newport."
"This pours a dark, dark brown - definitely not quite black, with an effervescent head, loose quick forming and disappearing head. Looks decent, but not exiting. The smell gets you with C-hops, citrus, underripe mango, lemon-lime, with a lot of pollen, resin, flowers. Super flowery. But you get just a note of chocolate, caramelly sweetness. I guess it more than does its job as a black IPA. The taste definitely has more malt balance than the smell. It's very sweet and chocolatey, caramelly, not quite roasty like a stout, but the hops add greatly to the complexity. Pleasant and fruity, a nice layer of sweetness, mango and sweet oranges on top of some chocolatey tastes, not quite bready enough to remind me of cake. The body is moderately full, the carbonation is kind of hard to predict, but is a little low. Overall, its very nice and enjoyable, though the hoppiness pushes the envelope. I think its a good beer, like Stone IPA with some chocolatey sweetness, which I think is a bit of an improvement on the enjoyability. And it gets more interesting as it warms."
"I found a dark beer, appearing black in the glass but actually a brown with no visible particulates. I found a somewhat persistent frothy white head with the slightest of brown tints. I took a whiff and a got a noseful of hops, yet was not offended. It seemed to me like it smelled oddly familiar. Up-front hop bitterness in the taste seems to overwhelm the slightly roasted-tasting malt, but after about 1/4 of the glass I became accustomed to the bitterness and it was quite pleasant to drink. It was also about this time that I realized that this beer is a less-intense Arrogant Bastard. I should of guessed that from the name, but I guess I'm just a dumb bastard. ; )"
"Mouthfeel is a little weak, a little thin, but hey, can't have it all! Overall this is, indeed, self-righteous and I enjoyed it. If you want to introduce AB to someone, and you're not sure how they'll handle it, start with this guy."
"drinkability - a perfect wintertime dipa hybrid - i just wish stone had distribution in IL."
"Thanks again Brett for this fantastic brew!"
"I've had this on tap a few times and I recall notably more balance and depth. I find the flavors from the bottle to be a bit too distinct, particularly with regard to burnt coffee flavors. Beer needs to warm up to fully appreciate."
"D: A complex and smooth offering from stone. A nice palette of flavors that seamlessly mix the desirable aspects of two distinct styles of beer into one. A fine sipper to be enjoyed over the course of an evening. Try a bottle for yourself and see if you are worthy!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, a very complex and tasty beer that I really enjoy every time I buy it."
"Yet the finish brings you back to that hops taste that you were expecting at first sniff. This is listed as an American Strong Ale, which I guess is fine, but lately a few breweries have been releasing what they call ""black double IPAs", and I would put this up against any of them any time."
"D- Definitely have no problem putting this beer down. Has a bit of every aspect I look for in a good beer and I will definitely be picking this one up again as long as I can get my hands on it. Stone, you have yet to disappoint!"
"Man, this beer rocks."
"had this on tap at The legendary Herot in downtown Muncie. Nice beer from Stone that delivers your typical Stone hops but this one is not too in your face like many of their beers are. Maybe they have learned to tone down the hops just a little to k=make their beers more drinkable. Nice hop aroma with citrus hop flavors that lead you into a well balanced IPA. Nice product from these IPA masters..recommend"
"D: Good."
"To be honest, this is a really mediocre , I was not impressed. Maybe i would have been a little more impressed by a beer from a lesser brewery, but this is by far a low point for stone."
"I bought two cases and enjoy every bottle as much as the previous. if you can find it, it's worth the price."
"Mouthfeel- The creaminess hides the full body. Medium carbonation."
"Overall- once i poured this dark brew i was worried it would be all malt but boy was i wrong. hops just take everything on this one and stone really knows how to dish them out. if you're a hop fan you don't wanna pass this one up!!"
"Great drinker. Hides the alcohol very well for a strong ale. Tastes as much like a milk stout as anything else."
" BRAVO!!!"
"Well balance, this is what experimental brewing is all about."
"Pours a very dark brown with light khaki head, one fingers worth sticks around, spotty lacing. Smell: seriously hoppy.. pine, earthy, pineapple juice, a little citrus rind. Mildly sweet brown sugar. Taste: floral, piney, grapefruit, dark brown sugar and a little powdery milk chocolate. Light roasted astringency in the end of the sip along with some nice citric bitterness. Medium bodied and exceptionally creamy in the face of a piney, dry finish. A good-great dipa with something extra, will be returning to this one."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is excellent for a ber thisstrong in the mouth, there are very light aftertastes which make this dangerously drinkable."
"Edit: I ate a peanut butter cookie and then drank another glass. Once the peanut butter cleaned my palate alot more of the fruity side of Simcoe came through. Very solid beer that goes well with christmas cookies."
"Foamy mouth feel. Good drinkability. Overall unique and good."
" Woa. That is somping special. Roasted malts up front, dueling with said piney tasting hops. They each demand your attention yet melt together seemlessly as they wash over my pallet."" You got porter in my IPA"" "you got IPA in my porter...the arguement continues. No lingering alchohol note. I'll have another please."
"D- Moderate. Strong in body, flavor, and ABV. But I love it. This one demands your respect, and its sheer monumental flavor won't let you enjoy it any way but slow. A sipper, and a great beer. I wish this one got regular distribution in RI, cause I'd buy a case or three."
"D - A great sipper for the strong beer drinker who's not afraid of some hops, this is a great addition on the mellower side of the Stone lineup. It's pretty well-balanced and not overbearingly heavy, but you'd be wise to take her slow."
"As big as this beer is, it all comes together and pleases the palate. Loads of hops come mostly in pine and citrus waves, a touch of roast, a faint sweetness detected, perhaps even a touch of floral hopping, not as much booze as initially expected but a bit there in the finish. This is a hop delight but with enough malt to seem slightly balanced. Nice carbonation helps pull it all together. Enjoyed this one! Very well done, though the ABV keeps me from going back too many times!"
"Graded on a curve for it's strength and dominant, ruinous hop taste, this ""luscious velvety hop bomb"" may be the best black IPA ever."
"Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale was served to me in a pint glass, the beer was a dark brown or possibly even black color with a tan head. This beer smells and tastes like cat piss, and I mean that in the best possible hop loving kind of way. To be a touch more serious, hops dominate the aroma and the flavor with strong grapefruit notes. A very good beer, recommended."
"Pours an awesome slick looking black. A friend of mine described the smell and taste as a black grapefruit smoothie, which I find kind of perfect really. Big hop nose, tons of grapefruity hop resinous smell. On the tongue its got plenty of bitterness to satisfy or scare, just a delicious mix of hops. I loved this beer as the anniversary and this was my first beer when I visited Stone (it still hadn't hit shelves here in VA). I'd buy a couple cases right now if someone here had it."
"M/D- thick bodied, slighty sticky on the back of the palate. Booze is present with bite but isnt totally overbearing. medium carbonation."
"Overall a very solid beverage. The transition from start to finish is great. Probably not worth the trouble of trading for it, but definitely something to pick up if easily available at a nearby store."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy with a solid amount of carbonation."
"Overall I find this beer to be a very well-crafted ale from Stone and one that certainly needs to be tried before it is all gone. Recommended."
"Pours a black color with a bit of redish brown hues around the edges when held up to the light. Thick tanned head pours more than a finger full and laces all around the glass and has some lasting retension. Aroma is strikingly citrusy with a fresh hop smell. Some burnt malt subtleness is evident in the background. Hops really prevail in the nose. Taste is hop forward with citrus bitterness but burnt grains and a little bit of chocolate/coffee character fills in as well before the bitter finish that lingers. Light carb and medium feel. As it warms the alcohol becomes a bit more evident in the taste but I am not complaining, this is a fine beverage."
"D: High. I could do these multiple times and finish off with a smoother RIS. A hoppy, dark beer. The taste truly is ""sublime"". Score another one for Stone!"
"Pours black as night with a tight tan head. This really looks like a stout or porter. It does not, however, smell like one. Hops are strong with pine and grapefruit. The grains seem only to be present in a slightly burnt aroma. It was odd drinking a beer with this appearance/taste combination. Alcohol is really not noticeable...very drinkable. The grapefruit is probably the strongest taste with the pine then blending in. That burnt taste lends itself to a hint of coffee for me. Very good."
"(Note: I drank this too cold. It gets better with a little time to warm up to cellar temp.)"
"Very good overall, finishes a little too sweet. I want another one, but the selection is too good. Hop aroma and flavor are very fresh, a little skunky, in a good way (some of you will know what I mean)."
"Sublimely is enjoyable and worth a try. However, it is a strong ale that is not meant to be consumed often, it's flavors are to strong to have a high drinkability (and here I will insert that drinkability to me is being able to consume more than one or two in a row)."
"D: I probably wouldn't want to have more than one bomber of this, although I could see myself content with it on certain occassions. It's fairly light but does leave your mouth pretty dry. Not sessionable, but one bottle goes down pretty easily."
"D - Pretty high for a beer with this much hops. If this were a IIPA and not a black ale I'd say it would be hard to drink. But with the masterful grain profile it really becomes a fabulous drink. I can serve this to folks with an aversion to high alcohol, high hop IPAs and have them smiling...and asking about other hoppy non-IPAs"
"Overall this is hands down my favorite Stone beer ever. Every time I taste it I get blown away. Award winning, awesome, give me more. Love it."
"Hands down on of my favs from these guys and probably my favorite example of the ""Dark IPA"" style. I've really enjoyed this out of the bottle several times but it seemed just so much more intense here on draft. Great stuff!"
"Pours a deep, opaque chocolaty brown with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head that hangs around for a bit. Aroma is strongly hoppy and has a hint of spice. Fiercely hoppy flavor makes drinking this beer like drinking a pine tree; it is fairly bitter but not ferociously so. Thick and silky smooth texture leaves a nice tingle and a hint of honey sweetness."
"D: drinking it faster than i thought i was, if i can find a bottle ill get it again."
"Drinkability: awesome beer. very drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"Though the hops are pretty powerful and the ABV is up there, I could do with another glass or two of this."
"Damn what a way to have fourth course BGBBD at sierra. I can still remember 11th coming out and everyone being like... this is no 10th. Well maybe it took the 12th being NOT an ipa for people to want this one back. So flavorful and smooth for its percentage and what hops! Black IPA's are rare but this one showed so much character that its a wonder why nobody else is picking up on this style."
"F: Finishes very bitter and pretty dry. More spicy floral hop flavors dangle around the mouth for a bit, and the dryness helps to accentuate the hops. A slight rich creamy stout feel stay around for a bit too. A slight chocolate taste also lingers and seems to blend really well with the juicy hop taste. I would love to have a chocolate covered hop candy bar."
"Pours almost pitch black in color but has a slight burgundy hue when you hold the glass to the light, mild head. This one smells really good - lots of pine and grapefruit with hoppy astringency coming through. This beer looks more like a porter which is why I'm so intrigued by it. The taste is really, really good! Lots of pine and citrus up front, very light malt, with a bitter chocolate finish that sticks around for 30 seconds or so before the chocolate starts coming through again, then fades away to hops. This is a very weird beer and one of the most unusual ales I've ever experienced. The feel is very smooth on the tongue and almost touches on creamy, but doesn't quite get there. This is a very drinkable beer and I could definitely have a few of these and not grow tired of it. I would say it's complex only because it fades in and out of a few flavors, there's not alot of stuff going on beyond hops and chocolate, but the way it blends is pretty impressive, especially when the color fools your brain into thinking there'll be more malt presence. Yet another well brewed and creative beer from Stone Brewing, I love their beers."
"This beer is so F'in Stone...I am however a ""Stoner"" I've shared this beer with many of my friends. It freaks most of them out! ""What the hell is this?"" is the most common response. It is a difficult beer to describe. It's hoppy, it's malty, it's, it's, it's...everything! I think Stone threw everything in this beer but the proverbial ""kitchen sink""...Not for everybody, but this ""Stoner"" loves it!!"
"EDIT: Well this was definitely a drink fresh beer. You can't really taste any of the darker malts used, but if you age it, the hops fade and some of the astringency comes out of it."
"This beer is very dark with a beautiful, thick, off white head. It looks like a porter or a stout. However, the nose immediately lets you know this is no stout. The nose is extremely hoppy. Grapefruit overwhelms the nose with a touch of pine. The flavor is very similar to the nose with grapefruit dominating, except there is a touch, and I mean a touch, of chocolate that comes through. The mouthfeel is about perfect, with the right amount of carbonation. It is pretty drinkable, a couple of bombers could probably be drank in one sitting. Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but probably will not purchase it again, unless it is on tap. It seemed weird to me for a beer to look like a stout but taste like an ipa."
"A bomber that I had back in spring of 2009. The colour was a very dark brown with a slight veil of a head. The aroma was quite sweet and malty with essence of alcohol. The palate was hoppy and frothy as well as creamy with strong coffee flavours and a very long resounding finish. Please, sir! May I have some more?"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Overall, I'm a little on the fence with this. I think a new category is in order, Black IPA. Good beer, I would have again. Skal."
"For a two year old beer this one really packs a lot of flavor. Well balanced and quite drinkable. Close to a barleywine without being overly hopped."
" Very glad it showed up at my local bottle shop: Plaza Liquors. Wish I had gotten another one, hopefully it shows up again."
"I'm not a big fan of the way the harsh, herbal bitterness of Chinook meshes with the dark malt character in this beer, but when all is said and done, it's still a hell of an ale."
"(two person review)"
"D-This is very drinkable. It must be, since I want more and don't have any. At 8.7% ABV the alcohol is not noticeable in the taste, but it definitely contributes to the overall character of this great beer. Well done, Stone."
"Drinkability: Average for the brewery."
"Pizzaria Paradiso/$7/12 oz"
"D: Weird thing about the Sublimely Self Righteous. Fresh, it's damn good. With 3-6 months of age, it's awful. But apparently it picks up again, because this version (a 2-year old bottle of the SSR) is quite fantastic. Good to know. I may not pick up a second bottle of the XI, but it makes me more confident about the SSR."
"Black body with a chalky white head that leaves some lacing. Glorious hoppy, grapefruity, piney aroma. Taste continues to bring the hoppiness. If you've had a Stone beer before, you know what you're in for in that regard. Just a hint of roastiness in the finish. Mouthfeel isn't nearly as thick and syrupy as most IPAs. In all, I like this a great deal. It's different enough to be distinctive, but it manages to retain all the features of a great IPA. Stone's braggadocio is kind of grating at times, but I'll put up with it if they continue to back it up."
"Great beer."
"stone has been hit or miss with me in bomber form..but i understand what tall the rave is about with this one...its almost perfect...a little cleaning and this one would be a 5 all around...will seek more of this out...glad its available here"
"Great offering from Stone."
"Drinkability: Good stuff. Remember to serve it on the warmer side (I'd suggest low 50's F) to get all you can get out of this powerful ale. I'll definately look for this one again."
"Drinkability: This is a class act, incredibly flavourful, and smooth as silk. A hard beer to describe, the best thing to do is to try it for yourself."
"D- The heavy presence of bitterness only allowed smaller drinks at a time."
"M/D: Definitely a full-bodied beer, but goes down easy. The 8.7% ABV is hidden very well, pretty drinkable."
"Very dark beer leaving great sheets of sticky lacing around the entirety of the glass. I'm not surprised to smell the big hops in the nose. With Stone they do it big with hops in almost all beers they brew. Very complex and dark for a Stone release with bunches of prunes and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is silky, creamy and complements the bitter finish letting the character of this beer linger on the palate. Get one if you see it!"
"Overall I love the bottle look and was very anxious to try this. The Stone peeps did a great job and all I can say to end this review is....righteous."
"I'm a big IPA fan, and love hopped up monsters, and like most of Stone's brews (admittedly not a big fan of any iteration of arrogant bastard) and this is a great beer. Just not sure what to call it -- I've had a black IPA before, maybe that's the best description of it really. Very different, very unique, and very much worth trying if you can."
"The taste of the beer is really interesting. There is a lot of backend bitterness from the hops but its balanced well with the roast character from the dark malts in the beer. Not a lot of front end sweetness to speak of. A full bodied beer, a great feel and high drinkability."
"This is a very interesting beverage. I love half, and don't care for the other half. Frankly, it's a little jumbled and incoherent. Overall, it's interesting but doesn't excite me."
"D - The alcohol is there for sure so I'd recommend this whole-heartedly, only well after a meal in the Autumn chill. Let the ale warm up a bit."
"From a 22oz. bomber, this unique black IPA was a bitter bomb from start to finish. The cooked roasted profile hits you on the nose, with chocolate malts and broasted grains. With good head and a nice quaff, an IPA porter hybrid comes to mind. The flavors tilt to the bitter side of IPA-land, with roasted dark nuts and barleycorn leading the pack. Overall a good, distinctive IPA, but a little bitter for my bulls-eye."
"D- Overall a solid brew from Stone, what they were going for? I'm not sure, but they managed to break the mold on beer categories and put out a special ale (that's what they call it) and it works very very well. IPA lovers take note."
"Drinkability: This beer has a ton of character. Very unique and very delicious. It can be slow-going at times due to the high bitterness (combo of roasted malt and hops), but I would buy this beer all the time if I had the chance."
"This is a dark moldy cellar of an ale. Although it was less ""dark," and more balanced, than the color suggested, the smell and taste were still dominated by earthy moldy pine, with a hint of citric sweetness. The feel was thick and aggressive, with tons of bitterness. For me a glass was perfect, but an entire bomber was too much."
"Brilliant and once again Stone keeps the price sane. Price per value is off the charts."
"Drinkability is up there. I enjoyed this with sirloin tips and it really made me happy."
"D - This is a good beer and good beer is drinkable! Really, even with the higher alcohol, it finishes clean and can easily enjoy a 22 oz. bomber or a couple 12 oz. or pints. Complex but not tiring."
"The body is full and just a little sticky. Drinkability is very nice but I think I'd get bored if I had more than 2 in a row. Overall, a decent beer worth trying."
"Smooth thick mouthfeel and highly drinkable, especially for the aclochol. I don't know what kind of beer this is, it's more like a dark imperial IPA, possibly the best stone beer ever."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is mostly citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, but there's also some roasted malt, chocolate and dark fruit noticable. The beer tastes pretty much just like the aroma. It's mostly hoppy, but there's enough malt in there that you can taste those flavors too. There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's somewhat creamy and coating, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is great, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy it again in the future."
"Dark brown with a tan head showing some good retention. Lots of hop bitterness on the aroma with some pine and citrus note taking the lead. Citrus again on the palate with orange/lemon peel type bitterness that's backed by a subtle malt sweetness. Definitely hop-forward, but it shows a considerable amount of balance despite being less than subtle. Sounds contradictory I guess but it's a unique beer to be sure and while not the greatest stone offering it's definitely a good beer that deserves a try."
"Poured a dark brown with a two finger head with good retention. The aroma was a musty bitter, sorry, can't do any better than that. The taste was bitter citrus/pine needles. A little bitter for me, but not bad. The feel was full bodied with more than sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good, especially if you are into hops. Not a lot of difference as it warmed up, still a good beer."
"I was surprised to see that this beer poured a dark brown color. Had a medium head that fell quickly and left some lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops - almost all citrus - with just a touch of dark malty sweetness in the background. The flavor was much the same, a touch of malty sweetness, but a ton of citrus and floral hop flavors and a lingering bitterness. The body was medium and the drinkability was good."
"A great beer! Well balanced with a very nice smooth mouthfeel. The hops and malt combine to make a wonderful combination of flavors that are just about perfect for a strong ale. It's like Arrogant Bastard refined but on steroids. Stone strikes again and we are the lucky ones."
"The pour is gorgeous, black with a dense dark brown head with great retention and lacing. On the nose, the hops are still so fresh! Yes, it's been in a 40 degree fridge for a while, but the piney hops with a little bit of fruit character (apricot and peach) really works well with the deep, roasted malt character with coffee and chocolate. Great balance. On the palate, the flavors are replicated, with a surprising amount of hops present, with pine and a little citrus before a gorgeous wave of dark chocolate, coffee and a little sweetness come in. In some ways, almost stout like. Medium in body with moderate carbonation and a long finish with a great balance between hop and malt bitterness, this beer is fantastic. I'd drink a lot more, but I have just one bottle left..."
"This beer poured an almost pitch black but with some light barely getting through. If formed a huge foamy medium tan head and formed circular lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, pine and grapefruit. The flavor was of malt, hops, grapefruit and a hint of chocolate. The body is medium light and the finish reflects the astringency of the hops."
"D - Fantastic! Easily one of the best dark hoppy beers I've had. I was surprised to see this categorized under Strong Ale instead of IPA. Either way, this is an awesome brew with a huge pineapple character."
"D: A really good black IPA style ale. It provides a complex and interesting mix of aromas and flavors with signature Stone quality."
"Quite an intense brew. Huge amounts of dark roasted malts. Gives off a coffeeish flavor. Of course, it also comes with big hops, both citrus and pine. Maybe just a little more citrus. Fairly bitter. Dark fruits, mainly prunes. Not exactly amazing, but somewhat interesting and unique. I would say pretty good overall."
"What can I say, this beer is great. Call it a Black IPA or an American Strong Ale or whatever you want. Its a big, gutsy beer that will blow you away and wash clean any assumptions you might have about dark beer."
"Find this beer if you can."
"A very dark beer, I held it agaist several light sources to no avail. Very nice perfume, piney and citrucy except you're too busy salivating to the hoppy bitterness to notice during the first few sips. Once you catch up to this brew you start to fully enjoy it. The flavor masks its alcohol content and at 8.7% be mindful you might not want to have too many of these unless you've got a designated driver."
"I'd say it's pretty drinkable as things like this go - hell, I had 3 of them, I must have liked drinking it."
"This is an exceptional beer, especially for those that love the combination of juicy fruit hops and roasted malts. For me, I typically don't like to mix the two, but this one worked out to say the least."
"Stone hid the alcohol extremely well in this beer. Huge marks for drinkability as it did not become cloying or repetitive. I wish Stone could make this a seasonal beer."
"The alcohol is very well hidden and the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. I think I could drink this beer all day. It is smooth, yet packs just enough hop bite to make it interesting. Keeps pulling me back in. Nice work Stone."
"I'm not a hops person, but I can see this beer being high marks for whoever is. Tastes like Stone met their mark here."
"D -- With how smoothly this goes down, and sporting an 8.7ABV, this could be trouble."
"D - I could drink this all day and night."
"The beer poured well. The head kept longer than I could wait to drink it. This beer had one of the most intense and pleasing aromas of a beer in a long time. Mouthfeel was pleasingly thick with a slight bite at the end. taste suggested dark burnt candy, rasins and coffee. could feel the alcohol warmth after first sip (gulp). very good beer, but could drink this all night."
"Drinkability - these kinds are beer are trouble because they go down so smooth and have that flat like finish that you end up pounding a few and find yourself a bit loaded, but well worth it."
"I had samples of the 11th when it came out but I never got around to writing a review on it, at the time I wasn't feeling the dark IPA for some reason. This bottle changed all of those feelings I had, this beer nailed the dark roasts and the bold American hops. Stone is perfect I just had the Stone 13th and that was pretty lackluster and definitely carried no finesse. This on poured a pitch black body with no ruby highlights when held to the light, it did have a big tan foaming head that rose well above the rim of my glass. Lacing was even and retention was excellent great looking brew from Escondido. Aromatics hit a solid blast of pine and herbal hops with citrus following close behind, sweet baked goods with cocoa dry powder, definitely roasted malt characterstics wtihout much coffee action. Flavor was layered between dark chocolate roasted malt and aggressive hop bitterness that did manage to work. Some citrus, pine resin, and herbal dirty hop flavors came about between layers of dark chocolate cake it was a good mix with moderate alcohol burn coming through. Mouthfeel was big but not chewy carbonation was tight bubbled it carried the brew very well, not overdone pretty natural smoothness going on with a soothing dry finish between roasted malt and bittering hops. Drinkability overall was excellent another great reintroduction to Stone's black IPA, I had Iniquity last night from Southern Tier and I'm diggin' the dark hoppy beers."
"If you see this, grab it! Worth the extra bucks for the bomber to get the real deal."
"Mouthfeel is thick and a little sticky, not flat, but heavy. Fairly drinkable."
"I had been staring at this beer in my refrigerator all weekend, then I finally got a chance to open last night and it was well worth the wait. The brewers at the Stone Brewing Company, located in Escondido, CA, pride themselves on being able to consistently produce such fine works of art like this truly self-righteous ale. This beer was first produced in 2007 as their annual anniversary edition release and was such a huge hit they had to make more. When you poor it into the glass the color is black as pitch with nose that similar to most imperial IPAs with notes of grapefruit that dissipate to hints of red fruits. The palate was bitter, but a balanced bitterness that comes from both the hops and malts, with hints of cranberries in the beginning and finishes long and dry. ABV 8.7%."
"This is a great beer, AB like, but even more over the top and better balanced."
"Enjoy!"
"However you wish to classify this beer (American Strong Ale vs. Black IPA) its not bad. My only complaint is that I kept thinking about how to differentiate this beer from Arrogant Bastard, and really I could only convince myself that the appearance was the most distinguishing factor. Otherwise, I though the flavor profiles were remarkably similar - not a bad thing since both beers are quite tasty! That being said, its a unique hybrid style and one that I enjoyed. If I see it again, I'd like to give it another try, just to see if I can try to further distinguish it from the AB."
"Taste is so mind blasting. At 9ABV Stone comes through again by making a very drinkable strong ale, that hides the booze very well. It's hard to describe the complex flavors, but it's like drinking a blended imperial IPA with RIS. The hops come through up front with grapefruit bite with a very coffee, malty and chocolate aftertaste. What a beer my friends, very complex and satisfying. If you like Imperial Stouts and IPAs this beer will not disappoint you."
"Drinkability - Still somewhat hot from the alcohol, which I thought would have mellowed a bit more. Still tasty and easy on the way down and a great brew for a hot summer night."
"Unexpected is the word for this beer. Very hard to believe it is almost 9% ABV since it drinks like nice summer time brew with a tip to a porter. Sweet, citrusy, balanced, flavorful. This is not exactly the powerhouse I expect from Stone but I like it. Stealthy!"
"A strong long lasting hop and bitter coffee finish. All around very bright hops, full bright flavored and wonderfully drinkable."
"D - Decent stuff, but somehow unoriginal. The bitterness is pretty rough but the mouthfeel provides a great delivery of the flavors at hand. For such a black beer I would expect more malt presence which hinders the brew a little. Still, a solid offering from Stone."
"A 22 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. The ale appears a dark translucent brown color with about an inch of light ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of lemon peel/rind, orange, roasted grains, caramel/molasses, fruity plums, raisins. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with more than adequate carbonation. Very nice, coming along quite well."
"Very interesting brew from a great brewery."
"Served a black, nearly opaque body with a thin ecru head that leaves sticky lacing. Plenty of roastiness, pineapple, dark roast coffee in the nose. Flavors explode on the tongue. Sweet up front ,then hoppy tropical fruit, followed by a bitterness that says ""I am righteous & here to stay!"" Solid mouthfeel on the lushly full not thick side. A one and done due to the abv."
"D- Another great offering from Stone...a very unique, and very tasty brew thats worth a try and probably a re-vist or two..."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just enough bittering to wipe away the cloying...excellent. Drinkability is quite nice as well, this bomber went fast."
"This is a sipping beer that I do not feel I could drink more than 1 or 2 of in a night, but I sure as hell would enjoy those 2!"
"Stone has a winner here, call it the summer beer for stout lovers. You can have your refreshing hoppy taste and have people still think you are drinking a stout."
"A definite must for any IPA drinker. Recommended by my beertender since he knew how big of a hop head. Busted one out that night and I bought them out. Enjoy!!"
"A bit darker than the 13th anniversary in taste and appearance, but this brew follows along that line and should appeal ton anyone who likes that or any of Stone's hoppy goodness."
"Great mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. I could see myself drinking a little too much of this in a session."
"I admit that I am a hophead, but I found this to be a little too hop forward for the style. The roasty notes were low in the mix and could really use a boost."
"In all this was a pretty sweet little secret I found up in Ypsi."
"Large head, slowly works down to around one finger, while it is mostly miniscule bubbles, you get oddly sized larger bubbles here and there and the head does dimple in spots, almost sheets of lacing down the sides, thick and clingy, light brown in hue. Completely and I mean completely black in color, you'd think it was a stout by looking at the glass. Then you smell and, wham, the hops slap you upside the head, all pink grapefruit, pine needles, tropical pineapple, guava, papaya, nectarine fruit, the floral side the weakest hops element, yields to burnt biscuits, lightly roasted coffee beans and peat moss. In the mouth it's full-bodied, muscularly sinewy and gets right up in your face. While there's no getting around that pink to white grapefruit, pine sap, licorice and bitters, here there's more equanimity shown towards the roasted malts and toasty dough elements, blends in coffee bean, hard toffee and a nip of butterscotch. The carbonation more prickly than anything else, fits in with the overall tingle. Balance for Stone is a high wire act blindfolded, but this one comes about as close as the brewery can get. More than any of the flavors you feel the energy bristle through each sip."
"D - This a pretty strong brew. Alcohol taste is pretty apparent. This almost seems like a desert beer. I could imagine having this with a ice cream covered hot cookie desert."
"drinkable for certain, and with the interesting taste it presents (compared to the usual stone lineup around here) i could have more than one easily. but it's not to be found in NJ for the most part."
"taste is strong, dry, dark fruits, touch of chocolate, a little caramel, sour malt, lots of hops, a little licorice, a tad bit of citrus, and a woodiness, end is dry and very bitter."
"Same style as Arrogant Bastard? Really? I don't see it. This is closer to a porter by my taste."
"Really interesting beer. Not sure if I would seek this one out again, but none the less it had a very unique taste. Kudos to Stone for taking it out of the box yet again."
"Interesting beer that has many different flavors to contemplate. Worth a try but make sure that you sip it."
"D: Refreshing and can't taste the high abv."
"I nice beer, but what else would you expect from a brewer like Stone? Once again this company does not disappoint serving a very good and rather strong beer. This has been a welcome addition to the Imperial IPAs that I have been ravenously consuming this summer. I will certainly be picking this up again and storing a few in the cellar to see what age does to it."
"This is one of the most interesting beers I've tasted in a while."
"M - Fluffy, fizzy, medium bodied."
"Found this on draft at the mandalay bay burger bar after they disappointed me with not having deschutes mirror mirror. Worth it, however. Didn't get the chocolate as much as expressed but an excellent double ipa with some maltiness. Great on draft in a goblet."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, caramel malt up front followed by a gigantic bitter dryness during the swallow."
"D: Just a little too out there for me, the flavors pull my tongue in so many directions, not to mention the amount of hops has pretty much decimated my tongue, that this is an enjoyable beer, but is hard to drink. A lot going on, really tasty, but definitely a one and done beer for me. Will seek out again."
"Overall, a really good beer. I'm a fan of India Brown Ales and this beer twists that style up a notch."
"Overall - An excellent and slightly bizarre ale - a bit like a blend of Schwarzbier and DIPA... well worth a try.."
"Pours jet black with a booming, fluffy light-tan head that never fully dissolves and creates a dense layer atop the glass. The aroma is filled with sticky, resinous hops and has some hints, although very subtle, of chocolate. Flavor is piney hops and sweet malt upfront and is accompanied by some touches of roasted malt and dried fruit. Its a medium bodied beer that is sticky and has a good amount of carbonation. Out of all the ""Black"" IPA's that I've tried this one certainly sets the bar. I had no idea what this beer looked like before I poured it into my glass and was surprised it was as black as it was. The aroma is purely delicious."
"Pitch black brew, tan two finger head with significant lacing-this looks good..Chocolatey, roasty malts predominate in the nose and beginning of the taste, with a dry hop finish. More of sipper than quaffer, one bomber is sufficient, thanks. I certainly like this more than Arrogant Bastard and hope Stone decides to brew on a regular basis. A nice example of the style, most certainly worth seeking out."
"D: Judging it based on the style listing here, there are quite a few Strong Ales that are probably more drinkable. If you threw it into the DIPA category, I think the score might be a bit higher."
"[1x]"
"This one toes the line between bitter and unpleasant. Had Stone made this any bigger, I don't think it would work out at all. It's definitely a beer that grows on you. Those first few sips are almost overwhelming. I know they already used the ""You're not worthy"" line for Arrogant Bastard, but it's more applicable here. All in all, this is a pretty bad ass beer."
"22oz bottle at Flying Saucer poured into a Duvel glass a nice opaque black with a nice frothy light-tan head that diminishes and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is a subtle amount of black malts and crisp hops. Taste is very nice balance of black malts and citrus and pine hops. Very nice complex amount of flavors with bitter cocoa and espresso showing up nicely as well. The beer is medium bodied with the alcohol present, but somewhat hidden. I got to try 11th when it was a year old, and this one is certainly better fresh."
"D: This is a damn drinkable beer. The growler was gone all too quick, glad they bottle this. I really enjoy this beer, goes down smooth and overall just an amazing beer. If you loved the Stone XI fresh, you'll love this beer."
"22 oz. Anniversary ale bottle. Dark brown/black pour. Frothy tan head. A little musty smelling, with piney hop and some roast and burnt malt. Taste has plenty of roasted malt, some dark chocolate. Very clean finishing with biter coffee, bakers chocolate, pretty dry. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I think 1 year of age would have been about perfect, this was just a little over. The 2 years really mellowed the hops, which was good for me. Good balance of malt, roast and hops. A real nice drinker, with only slightly high abv, which is not noticeable at all anyways. From what I understand this is now the Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale."
"J"
"- Hugely drinkable as most strong ales are from stone brewing...."
"D- Well sadly this is my last 11th from Stone so I can not drink anymore of this. Too bad cause it tastes good with some age on it."
"Overall this is a really fantastic beer. I like Stone XI, but I love this. Whatever the subtle difference is, it's for the better. Definitely something to stock up on."
"Had this at a recent tasting, poured into a taster glass. Pours a dark brown to black in color with a fluffy head. Smell has a nice hop profile, tangerine, pineapple, grass. Taste is as good as the smell, exploding with a refreshing hop bitterness of grapefruit and tangerine. This has a nice malt character with maybe a bit of smoke in the finish. Overall I didn't know what to expect from Stone on this one, it really met my expectations."
"The pour surprised me at first, because I had not read the full blurb on the back of the silk screened label, and was expecting an IPA. But the last line gave the clue to what this looked like, dark, pitch dark. When held up against the light, some ruby highlights showed up, but otherwise this was pretty much a black beer in terms of look. The head atop seemed small but stable, and was quite light in color, which was in stark contrast to the body. The smell was like a hop field, which pine and grapefruit smells being quite prominent. Underneath them, there was some chocolate lurking there. The taste was quite hoppy indeed, which made me wonder if this was not a year old bottle, but rather a fresh brewed batch for us on the East coast. The spicy, prickly, earthy hoppyness was just as intense as any IPA, however the black patent malt astringency, and some chocolate flavor were unusual, but went surprisingly well with that. The body was more in line with IPA than the looks suggested, and this was very drinkable for me, since I like hoppy beers. Quite a unique combination, but it works."
"D - I really enjoyed this one, and while it is definitely a sipper, it is quite drinkable and has a nice combination of flavors. For almost 9% abv, it goes down easy. I will probably enjoy one of these again, and I think it would make a great winter brew."
"Overall, an excellent brew, like every other Stone brew I've had (Ruination, Cali-Belgie, AB, and Oaked AB). Still, if Arrogant Bastard is too much for you, you're going to want to avoid this even more arrogant brew."
"was kinda of upset with this beer, not going to repurchase."
"D- Super easy to drink. I really like this one probably one of my favorite Stone's brews. I compared this one to Southern Tiers Iniquity and this one blows it out of the water."
"This is drinkable, but it is also powerful."
"D- A bit off putting at first and then I remind myself im drinking a fresh west coast strong so the hops dont bother me as much now. Perhaps some short term aging would do this some good as it is a bit ""strong"" for me at the moment. I could not finish a bomber now but down the line when things have shifted, hell ya."
"Drinkability: Similar to the Bastard for sure, but drinks slower due to the ABV. Although it feels closer to a 7 when drinking, it catches up as you go along. Good for a bomber, but not a whole lot more for a session, just a little too filling."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This thing was so earthy, it was like tasting & smelling tree sap! It was something I hadn't experienced before, that's for sure. This thing could be mistaken for a Winter Ale, I know I would enjoy a bomber of this, properly poured into a chalice on a snowy day, sitting in front of a fire, ah. I really did enjoy all the flavors & aromas, and although I'm not big on super hop giants, this one was uniquely herbal & earthy, and I would love to have this again. I recommend you grab it when they can brew it. Cheers!"
"I got to admit, I find Stone's brews kinda overrated. Their quality is not as high as a lot of micro brews I have had lately. But this is one of their better beers. Nice hoppy flavor that isn't overpowering, with a pretty big body. I personally prefer Iniquity to this, but this still gets a pretty high recommendation. Good but not great."
"Stone just never disappoints, do they? A black IPA huh? Looks great, has an edge of ruby to it, smells like hops and sweetness, not so much burnt as a stout or porter usually is. It tastes of resin-y hops and dark beer flavors. In fact, almost black lager-like in taste, not so much Guinness-y. Great mouthfeel and, although hard to drink because of it's heave, a great beer. Totally self-righteous!"
"D: Alcohol flavor is minimal and the flavor is solid"
"A well done brew by the folks at Stone. This is not my favorite style, but is a beer I'd consider having again sometime."
"the first sip brings lots of hops followed by a sublte caramel blending really nicely. definately some grapefruit, earthy, and pine notes. very pleasant. It tends a bit more to the hoppy side, but overall there is a good balance. Very easy to drink could probably have a few more."
"D: Couldn't drink it all day, but I sure could come close."
"I'm glad I got my hands on this one. Another excellent brew from the fine folks at Stone."
"Over all pretty good ""black ipa"""
"Had on tap as well at a DFH vs. Stone tasting. The hop bitterness has held up quite well and imparts a nice citrus feel with a roasted finish. Superbly drinkable."
"D - Not something that I could drink a whole lot of."
"Drinkability: This is a big beer but it drinks very smoothly."
"goes down easy"
"Extremely interesting beer, and definitely worth it. Complex, yet extremely well executed."
"Future outlook: Wow. Pretty pricey (~$9 /22 oz.), but I have to admit, it knocked my socks off. A super-hopped strong ale (black DIPA??), to be sure, and it worked. Extremely enjoyable, and something I won't hesitate to try again...I just wish it were cheaper!!"
"Pours a deep deep brown color, almost black, nice fluffy light brown head that settles into a puffy cap. The aroma is of grapefruit hops, some pineapple; juicy and fresh. The taste is of grapefruit, piney, and resiny hops, all in that order. A roasted malt is detected after the hop blast, also a touch of caramel. This is one hoppy and roastd malt bitter bomb. Well bodied, not quite chewy, fizzy carbonation, bitter all around, finishes with an asprin like dryness. Good contrast between the hops and malt but both bitter. A little too bitter and dry for my liking. A big hoppy bitter brew, with plenty of flavor. I'll finish off the bomber but my tastebuds might be shot."
"On tap at The Brass Tap, pours a deep, dark brown with a tan one finger head. The aroma is a strong combination of earthy/piney hops and roasted malt. Some citrus hints are dashed in there too. Flavor follows suit, in a big way. A very complex beer that changes flavor as you drink, and it warms. Starts off with a sweet malt flavor, but the hop bitterness follows. It is really an odd combination that, in the end, I really enjoy. The hops could be considered out of place, but it works! Almost like a chocolate orange at Christmas time. A bit dense, as a result of it being such a robust beer. An enjoyable beer due to all the things happening, but definitely a sipper, almost on that could stand alone after dinner as a treat."
"D: Try to take it from me, I dare you."
"A really interesting beer, but I'd have a hard time drinking a lot of this. Wow."
"Great beer. I was pleasantly surprised by the great hops in this one."
"Color is lightly black with some faint red hues when held up to the light. Head is a thick light beige color that is solid. Good Belgian lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops with some malt sweetness evident. Flavor was similar to how it smelled. Rich malt flavors up front followed by piney hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good. A big beer that is worthy of its name."
"Tastes like super-hopped IPA. Relatively thin body. There's a mild level of roasted malt in the aftertaste, otherwise it is all bitter, bitter hop."
"D- Drinkability is better as it warms up a bit. But the big alcohol taste makes me only want to stay at one of these bad boys."
"Overall, a nice brew and definitely enjoyed the hops. Fairly tame next to some of Stone's other offerings, but worth a look."
"Pours a deep dark rich black with a brown head that sticks around minimally throughout. Good lacing as well. Smell is a beautiful mixture of roasty malts and sticky piny hops--this is a combination that I haven't come across yet and its a welcome frontier. Tastes congruent with smell, most flavors are from the hops--bitter, citrusy, a commanding grapefruit character--but there are roasty chocolatey flavors as well. Mouthfeel is thick but not creamy. Drinkability is great."
"Notes: This is like Levitation on steroids to me with a higher hop profile and just a bigger beer altogether. Hop lovers everywhere should seek this one out."
"Bomber poured into DFH tulip glass. Surprising smell of hops right off the bat. Wish I could smell the full effect, dam allergies!!! I was not expecting the hoppy smell b/c of the darkness of the beer. Very dark with a 1 finger brownish head, looks like a porter. Very smooth on the tongue, silky texture. Tastes of hop, oak, roasted malt and dare I say ""coffe-ish"" at times? I didnt really notice the 8% abv, I put the bomber down no problem. I really enjoyed this beer and its one of the best stone brews I have had to date. The picture on the bottle is bad ass as well. Luckily this finally arrived my area so I plan to buy some more. Cheers."
"D- This is just a great brew that has me interested. I'm looking for more flavors all the time. It's definitely a dark IPA-style brew, and one I'm happy I got my hands on. Reminds me of a more affordable Black Sun Stout, although it is more of an IPA than the BSS. Great stuff here, probably my favorite Stone brew."
"Overall, the name, as well as the label, say it all. This one is quite sublime, and worthy of the self-righteous arrogance that the brewers bestow on it."
"This is a great beer and I really love what they've done with the balancing of the aggressive hop presence and dark malt backbone."
"I had 3 pints and could have had 3 more easily. Exceptional flavor & drinkability...so damn unique."
"Drinkability was decent, strong in the ABV so I couldn't drink much, but really enjoyed this one. Almost a cross between Hop Rod Rye and Double Bastard? As usual, Stone is awesome."
"D- Very drinkable, I wasn't expecting all the hops, even though I've had the 11th anniversary ale, which was a while back though."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D: Wow, this is my new favorite style. What is it? An IPA? Stout? Strong Ale? A mixture of everything? Stone never ceases to amaze me. As far as drinkability, wouldn't be able to have too many in one sitting, but is definitely delicious."
"Drinkability: Not too bad here - I give it a 4. A bigger beer, for sure, and something to sip on as it's a little heavy, but it tastes wonderful and has great balance."
"Drinkability: Medium - the taste is really nice and complex with a good feel, and the alcohol isn't so overwhelming to warrant low drinkability."
"Overall, outstanding offering from the beer gods at Stone Brewing. This is a limited edition ale so go get some before they disappear! Go now!!"
"This is a pretty unique beer as far as I'm concerned. IPA style hop flavour meets porter/stout characteristics. Its a big beer in ever sense of the word. I will buy this again."
"D - Fantastic and flavorful yet quite drinkable. A nice new bottled offering from Stone."
"nice beer. thanks to cdviking for the trade."
"Perhaps it needs age, for the drinkability suffers a little right now."
"Poured into a pint glass, dark coffee in color, with creamy light tan head. The faint smell of coffee, very strong taste. I'm glad I've only got one 22oz of these, I'm not eve half done with it and I can already feel it. After taste has a slight twinge to the tongue, hard to describe. A very good beer, I will definitely get it again."
"For some reason the term ""porter on steroids"" came to mind while sipping this beer. A complex and pleasing brew, I wonder if it would be served best in chilly to cold weather. Nevertheless, a tasty and fun beer."
"D - very well put together beer. more drinkable than either Bastards and more complexity than other of those beers put together."
"Basically, Sublimely Self-Righteous is like one huge industrial-sized sheet of Bounce flapping in the wind, one end of the clothesline hung on a pine tree and the other on a lemon tree. With a burning rye field nearby and a chocolate factory across the street. Hung by you as you munch on black licorice nibs. This is my kind of beer and I hope they have the good sense at Stone to offer it year round. Mold-breaking, even having a transcendental element in its uniqueness, but seriously quaffable, which is really what counts most."
"Saw a bottle of this at the newly-established Hop City in Atlanta and snatched it up immediately. Pours a deep brown with a modest head and lacing on the glass. Looks almost like a stout. Smell is alcohol, hops, spices and maybe a little bit of dark fruit. Taste is very complex...dark fruit, slightly bitter, spices, relatively smokey. Bitter aftertaste lingers with this one. Silky smooth mouthfeel. I can easily drink this 22 bomber on my own. Another fanastic offering from Stone."
"Nicely drinkable and an interesting brew."
"Drinkability is extremely, dangerously, I-can't-say-it-strongly-enough superlatively wonderful. Between a very, very mild alcohol presence, and a flavor which nearly matches what my current fantasy beer would taste like, it is most perilously, marvelously drinkable."
"Now, time to go drink the other half of the bottle :D"
"This poured a nearly opaque ruby with tan head. It smelled like pine and copper hops and honey malt with some roasted barley and a bit of lavender. It tasted like pine and floral and copper hops, with lots of roasted barley and some bitter coffee. It was slightly thick with mild carbonation, and a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very unique beer! I love the concept and execution. This is what a black and tan (or porter?) should be. It was very clean and easy to drink, with great taste and pretty good body. It hid the alcohol very well, and was fantastically well constructed. Quite original and enjoyable."
"D: I really love how this seems to walk this blurred line between a strong ale and a double IPA. Probably worth cellaring a few as well and at $6.99 it is worth it. This is a very drinkable beer but so far, in my personal experience, that goes without saying with Stone."
"D - was going to just drink half and then recap it, but I decided I wanted to keep exploring this beer, esp when it warmed, a good sipping beer but one you just can't stop sipping, Stone owns the American Strong Ale category"
"I bought this beer simply because it said Stone on it and I am not only please I did, but I will be buying it again. More complex and pronounced than other examples of the style."
"Overall this beer is quite the conundrum - a dark IPA that's definitely worth a shot."
"This is a GREAT beer, both fresh (as Sublimely Self-Righteous) and with age on it (as Stone 11th). In fact, I think I prefer this 11th. Time to throw some SSR in the cellar!"
"The flavor is punishingly hoppy, with a lot of roasted notes as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, not terribly full; more like a double IPA than a stout. Great mix of notes, and a great beer to enjoy on tap."
"Very satisfying. Highly drinkable and has a lot of variance that keeps you mind and mouth guessing."
"Drinkability is outstanding. Could go bottle for bottle of this."
"D: This beer just didn't do it for me. The sweet grapefruit theme dominates everything, and creates a rather one-dimensional experience. I'm a big fan of Stone, but I have to say that I'm disheartened by this release. It's a decent beer nonetheless. And I'm glad I tried it. It's just that in my mind, Stone has done better work than this."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a balls-to-the-wall Stone beer. I guess I should expect nothing else from them, but yeah this one is particularly ass-kicking. I was almost confused at first - the beer pours a very dark, nearly opaque brown color yet with a big fluffy head - but at a whiff it smells much like a sappy pine-riddled IPA. Lots of hops in the nose, but digging deeper you'll find a nice mellow chocolate character. The taste too is all hops up front. Really brashly bitter. Yes please. Resin and pine. Once your palate has been smacked around by the pine and resiny hop attitude you notice the whole roasty, chocolatey, rich underbelly of this beer. Real dry and puckering on the palate, but with a rich creamy finish. A little bit of heat perhaps. So much going on in this beer, quite a hybrid of styles. Wicked good."
"D- Heavier than an IPA in body and comparable to a stout or porter in color, this ale might seem like a challenge by looking at it but it has a crisp, refreshing carbonation that rounds it out and makes it extremely drinkable. Try with a heavy meal of grilled steak or pork or on its own for Jebus sake. This beer is absolutely worthy of the Stone catalog!"
"Another great release from Stone. This brewery just doesn't stop coming with the heat."
"Another winner from stone. One of these nights, I'll have to see what it tastes like with a couple years on it."
"D. Pretty drinkable, altough I don't see myself enjoying more than one of these at a time."
"D: Very good drinkability. Little alcohol comes through. I'm beginning to prefer hoppy beers with a little bit less bite than Stone provides, but beers like this will bring me back around to the Stone kick-you-in-the-face hop style."
"Black body, visible irregular lace, great retention. Unholy melange of coffee and pineapple in the nose, pungent west coast hops. Somehow this works! Sweet and luscious grapefruit, very earthy underneath with dark malt taking a backseat, and some nice multi-dimensional hop character. Rich and almost syrupy DIPA body, with hybrid flavors that confound and entertain the palate. Awesome!"
"D - Very drinkable, love this as much from the bottle as I did from the tap."
"Tasty but overall low drinkability due to the bitterness of the beer. An experince I would share with a friend again however."
"Drinkability is decent. I have sipped this one slowly like a barleywine, but it is still very very smooth. Enjoy with aged cheese if you still have one."
"EDIT: This is a merged review from an aged bottle of Stone 11th Anniversary."
"D: A nice sipper... I would have liked to try this fresh, but it has held on fairly well."
"Verdict: I'm totally having a love affair with this beer."
"D: Can drink this all night. Stone only pours an 8oz glass ($4) and I quickly drained it."
"22 oz. bomber poured into my Duvel tulip. Looks nice - it's pretty dark, if not black, but I see some light coming through the edges. The head is pretty pillowy. Some light tan lacing clings to the glass. The nose made me say wow right away. Not so much a ""this is great"" wow, but a ""this is interesting"" wow. There's pine and citrus, and orange, some fruity sweetness, and then comes in the roastiness at the end with coffee tones, and light caramel malt. When I taste it, I can tell that it's not fresh (which I wasn't expecting of course), but it still is pretty hoppy. It's a bit sweet, prickly, with some grassiness, then comes in the roasty chocolate character - it's quite interesting. I'm not sure if I'm really into it, but it sure is fun to try. Pretty good overall, quite unique. I was thinking that I'd pick up a Sublimely Self Righteous if I come across one, since I'm really curious to try this one fresh."
"Very impressive, and I was very happy to hear it will come now as a regular. Unsure if it is better fresh as some mentioned, but cannot compare as I did not have it. As it stands now, it is an amazing beer - I will probably age it again when I get my hands on it."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I had the 11th when it first came out and I loved it. I love how this beer does not taste like you would think based on its black color."
"Serving type: Bomber"
"Drinkability: This is so damn hoppy that it takes a while to put one down. Compared to the only other ""Black IPA"" I've had so far, Warrior Black IPA by Pizza Port, this is like a Double IPA versus a ""Regular"" IPA," but not in necessarily a good way. I think when experimenting with this new style of sorts, more brewers are going to have to balance out the stout flavors and the IPA flavors. It may be an IPA first and a stout second, alright, fair enough, but still. Anyway, I congratulate Stone on pioneering the style, though, this is getting a TON of praise from people I've met in person and on BA."
"D: An interesting beer to have on cask, another solid offering from Stone, a tasty imperial pint to be had if this beer is found cask-conditioned."
"It definitely sits comfortably in the Stone brand, tasting much like a double IPA but with some pleasing roasted notes from the malt."
"Nicely done, would get this again."
"Poured a very dark brown with a medium amount of tan foam and a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of hop's with a hint of roasted malts was evident on the aroma. The taste was of a bitter hoppy flavor with a mild sweet roasted malt flavor also. There might just be a touch of chocolate, but, more of a roasted malts flavor. Nice balance of soft bitter/sweet on the finish of the American Strong Ale."
"22 oz. bomber, released 9/10/07, sampled six months after that; brewed to 20.5 plato with ""lots"" of IBUs. It's a few shades away from pitch black, with a few dregs, three full fingers of khaki head and some nice lacing. Little sweet in the nose, with fruity alcohol, pine and citrus fruits (orange, grapefruit). Roasty and quite hoppy on the palate, with coffee, crystal malts, and medium to high bitterness. I can already taste some age on this one. The body is smooth, a little prickly, with a dry, roasty/chocolate finish. A pretty decent beer, unique and a pleasure to try. I'm picking up the black IPA thing, but I could stand for more hop flavor to help it along."
"Overall a very tasty brew that I would try again for sure just to see how it is aging."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Sometimes IPAs, even for a hop head like me, get to be a little much but this dark malt is a great balance. Definitely a unique brew and I'm definitely looking forward to Stone's new Sublimely Self Righteous Ale which is apparently the same recipe but hopefully a little more fine tuned which would make this beer a favorite."
"I first reviewed this beer when it was the 11th Anniversary Ale. Tonight I finished my last bottle of that brewing. It is still just fine but I'm not convinced it would have held for too many more months in the bottle. The dark roasted malts now give it a slightly bitter, almost burnt taste but there is definitely some bright citrus flavor from the hops floating around in there in the background. All in all I'm quite pleased with how well this bottle has done despite the fact it was not cellared under ideal conditions."
"Overall, a very interesting beer with IPA-centric qualities and some subterfuge thrown in with the dark appearance. Not super drinkable, but given high hopping rate and big alcohol character, it isn't meant to be a session beer."
"can't wait to see this as a regular release, it's too good to leave as a one time brew"
"Cask at O'Briens SD. Funky, blast of hops on the nose. A bit of sweetness, very complex, herb and vegital. Extremely long length. Color was black with a brown standard type cask head. Hops really dominate and the malt create a unique brew. Much different from the 11th bottle enjoyed a week prior. Interested to see how current bottles compare."
"A solidly built beer, quite a hop lover's delight. I personally wish it were a bit more fruity and less ashy, but that is a minor compliant in the presence of a well-built taste sensation. It's probably more ""in style"" (whatever that means) with the darkness of this beer."
"Overall: any time"
"Overall: Like I said before, one of the best beers to come out this Escondido brewery. A very hoppy beer that is easy to drink and full of flavor. An excellent beer and a must try as well. Cheers!"
"Pours very dark with a dense tan head and ruby highlights when held to the light. The hops on the nose is powerful and reminded me of the Amarillo hops I used in a recent homebrew. This is one interesting double IPA with a massive resiny hop bitterness in the finish. 90 IBUs completely hides the 8.7% abv, but even for the hop head that I am, I suggest drinking it on the cold side. Up front, there is a much better balance as a hint of roasted maltiness briefly rises above the piney, oily hop bitterness. A true hop head's beer, but I seem to remember it being a little less over-the-top when I had it on tap as the 11th Anniversary Ale at Stone, Escondido."
"This is a worthy and highly drinkable strong ale."
"Notes: Is it a Black IPA? Is it a very hoppy American Strong? Seems like a hybrid between the two. Who cares, though, it's fantastic! So glad this is available year-round! Highly recommended"
"A truly awesome beer."
"Very smooth mouth feel. A tongue swipe of the mouth produces sweetness, but then the hop goodness comes on again. I am going to have to try one next to an 11th, but I think the Sublimely in this fresh state, is going to come out well ahead for me and is going to be a current favorite for me for awhile I believe."
"The beer poured a very dark brown color with a great off white head and nice lace on the glass. My nose was quickly drawn to the scents of pine and pineapple and I could not wait to taste it. The flavor was event better than the smell with a bit of dark malt sweetness to start out with, followed by a very fresh, lightly piney and cirtusy hop blast, and rounded out by a touch of alchohol in the end. The perfect carbonation and smoothe, not too thick mouthfeel added greatly to my enjoyment of the beer. No, I do not think any improvements could be made on this one, but get it now while it's fresh! You will not be dissapointed!"
"Serving type: 22oz bottle"
"This dark and lovely ale poured a slow but solid two finger head with good retention. The nose had strong grapefruit and coffee aromas. The mouthfeel was silky for a well hopped brew. The taste was like a roller coaster of flavors. The smooth chocholate and coffee taste takes center stage then the big citrus hops try to peak thru the murky flavors of all the malts. This beer was darker than most Indian brown ale's I've tried. Thanks to Stone for pushing the envelope."
"One of my favorite Stones. A little more accessible that the Bastard beers from Stone, yet is has a character of its own. Pours extremely dark for an ale. Great head and retention. Aroma is very Stone, as is the taste. Hoppy and thick - lots of layers to the flavor. Fruits, figs, then some smokey dark woody notes. Very pleasant and smooth taste and feel. 55 degrees is best for this beer, similar to the Bastard beers. This has become something of a regular for me - luckily I bought a case a while back. I'm looking forward to the Self-Righteous Ale so I can get a case of that. Man I love Stone!"
"Color is a dark reddish-brown with a tan head layers the top. The aroma is made up of citrus, spicy and resiny hops with a dark biscuit malt backbone. The taste follows the aroma with a slight alcohol taste as the beer warms. Very dry finish wonderful beer. One of my favorites from Stones."
"D - I wasn't sure what to expect of this when I opened it, but I am not disappointed! A lovely beer that I'm glad I got a chance to sample (we only got Stone in GA back during the Fall). Will totally enjoy finishing this bomber. Stone really are one of the best and most consistent breweries around. Keep it up dudes, and let's get more of your awesome beers to GA already!"
"This is the rebrew of one of my favorite beers ever, 11th anny stone, and it delivers, hits well across the taste buds and leaves you wanting more. Mitch, please please please brew this more than once a year!"
"The taste is hoppy as hell from start, to finish, with pine-o-plenty and loads of citrus. Make no mistake, this is a strong hop ale of the IPA type...more hop than strong, the alcohol gets burried deep in the forest. Medium plus body with a bitter, sappy finish. Quite refreshing and drinkable. If you like your beers dark and hoppy, this is a must try."
"D - Good, but needs more hoppiness and flavor."
"Off the tap at Stone Night this beer was a nearly opaque dark brown with some very deep mahogany hues visible against bright light. The head was tan, one-finger thick and retained well as a thick collar that left lacing in broken sheets. Good looking for sure, if it were a lady, I'd be picking her up. The aroma was intriguing, like an IPA gone evil, to further the metaphor, the lady with torn fishnet stockings and red, red lipstick. Big floral hops, rich malts and a depth of spiciness. The flavors were equally complex, deeply floral hops, balanced with robust malt, elements of pine, caramel sweetness in the middle, hints of mocha and milk chocolate. The punchy 8.7% was well concealed and I had to give it high marks for being both impressive and unique. The mouthfeel was very creamy, the body full and the carbonation perfectly smooth. An unusual treat."
"From a 1L growler fill at the brewery. It's interesting how this beer has changed over time. Just in the last 6 months a ton of the hop character has started to fade since the last time I tasted this beer. It's closer to a strong brown ale now than it's former dark IPA self. It still has a good strong hop profile, but it is mellow and round with the malt. Don't expect this beer to slam you over the head with hops, but expect a big malty beer that is still fairly bitter."
"Love this stuff. Pours dark brown, almost black, with a creamy off-white head. Cascade hops, some resin, dry pine needles, some earthy leaves and wood. Clean, dry hop bite. Roasty, burnt coffee-like maltiness mixes well. This is the first time I have ever had such a blend. Kind of like an over-hopped porter or a black IPA with malt and coffee. Worked out nicely."
"A relatively muted after taste for an IPA. However, the mellow easy going character lead to the subsequent enjoyment of a few other pints. Bitterness factor is minimal and overall flavor versus drinkability ratio is superb. I personally bought multiple bottles to cellar and failed miserably at being patient."
"Like I said, I have a new found faith in Stone that Stone 12 killed. I hope a year in the cellar calms the 12 down"
"Stone XI is a solid black ale with red highlights. It has a creamy tan head with oily bubbles. Great retention and lacing. It has an aroma of licorice and medicine. It almost smells like seawater. There is salmiakki and something leafy in the nose. It's medium-bodied and a bit sharp with a gritty finish. The roast really comes out in the flavor, along with a bit of chocolate. It's quite bitter! It tastes like Christmas trees. It's bold and flavorful and has good balance. It's almost like... an imperial porter? Good stuff!"
"D - A decent beer from Stone; there is better out there, I'm not overly impressed with this one. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these but this beer is definitely worth a try."
"I guess this is Stone 11th Anniversary re-released. I'm happy as that was a favorite of mine and now that means this is too. Hopefully it will be around for some time."
"A good beer but falling short of what I would expect from Stone."
"(NOTE, mid 2009: when i was writing my tasting notes by hand, i had no idea at the time that the re-release would include the word ""sublime"" in the name. it really was just THAT good!)"
"8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"It poured out like black coffee into my snifter with a one finger tan head. There were thick tan rings left after each sip and they didn't go away. Smells of hops and more hops, malts and minimal citrus fruits. Tastes exactly how it smells and leaves you with a hoppy aftertaste. Let it warm a little and you'll really taste the malt!! Mouthfeel is wet and refreshing, I actually wanted to gargle with this beer. Carbonation is a little on the heavy side making it a bit difficult to drink glass after glass."
"Overall, sublime, and Stone has every right to be self-righteous."
"Worth a try!"
"Overall, Stone's 11th Anniversary Ale is great. I think that 10th-12th really outdid 8th & 9th for me, and personally 11th 12th outstrip 10th. While 10th was by all means great, it just didn't bring anything new to the table. It was a great DIPA, but no better than Ruination, but this ""Black IPA", now this is unique, and not just unique's sake, it is damn tasty too. Kudo's to Stone for doing something different and doing it well. Now I am going to have to go out and see if I can get some more."
"Wait a second - this is dark, REALLY dark. Unlike like any IPA I've seen before, but totally intriguing from the get go. Totally sturdy head with lots of lacing and plenty of sticking to sides goodness. Roasted malt mixed with pine and citrus is the complex aroma. Really nice and different. Taste is a cross between a really nice dark ale and a hoppy IPA. Sweet and malty but finishes bitter and citrusy. Excellent stuff. Sturdy, full mouthfeel and this is one easy to drink brew. I could have another bottle right now. But alas, I only bought one. Highest recommendation."
"D: Drinking real nice with a year under its belt."
"Drinkability: This is indeed a ""dark"" IPA, almost a barleywine at this point, given the malt content and the age on it. Definitely an ""India Black Ale."" Alcohol on this one is expertly-hidden and not too outrageous to begin with, so good show here. Recommended if you can get your hands on it."
"This has been in the cellar for a year, was going to review it election night. Instead it gets it's turn tonight. Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head and very good lacing. Wow, big hop aroma still, very surprising considering it's been in my cellar for almost a year. Some chocolate as well. Nice flavor, big hop bite still in this one. This one is aging very nicely."
"D - Could definately do a couple more of these. I would definately order this one again as it is one of my favorite beers I have had redently."
"Overall, this was one hell of an interesting strong ale. Very freshly hopped and another great offering by Stone."
"D: If I remembered this beer as good as I have just experienced, I would have been reaching for it much more often in the past year. Alcohol isn't overbearing, familiar while also intriguing, and still leaves you wanting more. I'll finish my glass and remember how great the Stone 11th anniversary party was."
"Pours a jet black color with a one finger tan head made up of little bubbles with good retention and thick spotty lacing. Extreme citrusy hop aromas-lemon rind and strong fresh grapefruit with a carmelized malt backbone. Grapefruit hop flavor up front with some pine lead to a roasted/smoked malt, espresso with a lemon rind bitter finish. Medium carbonation, full bodied this beer has a mouth coating coffe like feel to it."
"D. Very easy to drink. This is a fantastic beer I just wish i had gotten more when it first came out."
"D - This was tasty and good, but it was quite a heavy beer and a bit much to drink."
"Full in body with silky smoothness, Stone's 11th Anniversary is a fine and quaffable brew."
"Drinkability: My, how this has progressed in just a year's time! I dare say I like it much better this way."
"I enjoyed this, a somewhat creative blend of styles, very drinkable and tasty."
"aged 1 year this month and poured into a imp pint glass. pours dark, looks like a stout. smell is very alcoholic mixed with roasted malt. taste is rather sweet, like a sweet arrogant bastard and very similar to a barleywine. mouthfeel is wonderful with perfect carbonation. too bad i only have one of these."
"Pours a clear dark brown color, though purple/red in direct light, with 2 fingers of frothy tan head. Excellent retention and uber-sticky lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pineapple, roasted malt, caramel, and pine, pure West Coast IPA with a uniqueness from the malt. Tastes of pineapple and grapefruit up front followed by some hearty bread, chocolate, roasted malt, and caramel. Finishes with a nice blast of pine resins and a slight warmth of alcohol. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and bitter, but also smooth and roasty. Even after having bottles for over a year, this stuff doesn't fail to impress. Starting to taste a little more boozy than its abv suggests, but still pretty impressive for sitting over a year."
"I really dug this unique IPA meets RIS style. By no means a session brew, but I enjoyed the whole bottle."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a large frothy beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, grapefruit, floral, pineapple and berries. Flavor is sweet grapefruit, pine, earthy, chocolate, caramel, berries and peaches. Long grapefruity bitter finish. Smooth medium-full body, resinous texture."
"D- This si actually a decent drinking dark IPA. I would like to see more breweries experimenting with this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Average mouthfeel, with its unremarkable carbonation. With the boldest character of hop and malt, this offering from Stone goes balls to the wall and back again... I still say that 8.7% is an understated number."
"Drinks nicely - could use a little more age - definitely a mid-range sipper."
"as a side note, in comparison from the 11th anniversary to the 12th, it was really interesting to see the difference a year makes. One year ""overload with hops", next year hops are precious cargo. How the market controls what we consume, yet it is beautiful to see how true masters such as Stone adapt and overcome the obstacles thrown at them. Congratulations Brewmasters!!! please continue!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm guessing that the year of age really toned down the hops, as I will reiterate one final time that to me this was more of a porter or stout (and one of the better ones at that) than an IPA. It loses points because of this, but in and of itself it's a very enjoyable beer. The alcohol will catch up with you after a little bit, so one bomber was plenty for me."
"Drinkability is moderate. Decent flavor and moderate alcohol make this brew fairly easy to consume, but slightly limit it as well."
"Great beer if you can get your hands on a bottle."
"D- Good, but a little strong and a little astringent. It needs to be sipped, which works to the drinkers advantage because the malt comes through more as it warms."
"This is one of my favorites, and u"
"An interesting brew. I like what Stone does with their anniversary beers, but the 10th may always be my favorite, too bad that didn't age well."
"A very nice beer. Great as a beer to go with balsamic marinated grilled provolone. Cheers to the folks at Stone for making it to eleven. Another quality brew."
"This beer pours a beautiful black/opaque with a lovely tan head, about 2 fingers. The smell is nice with hints of nuts, chocolate and malts. The flavor is very nice as well, I don't get any nut flavor from the smell but I do get some chocolate, caramel and toasted malts. The flavors mesh very well together my only complaint would be a with the mouthfeel after I swallow I get a dry feeling in my mouth, the beer feels wonderful in my mouth but once it is swallowed its not the greatest mouthfeel. It is certainly a well crafted beer, but not something I could see myself drinking all night but one or 2 bombers would be nice :D"
"Overall, a very unique beer from Stone. Superb!"
"D- I love this beer and am extremely sad that its A) retired and B) I found it almost a year after its release. So much going on here its almost as if it starts and IPA then moves to a stout then back to and IPA. Never had something quite like this. I would highly recommend this and fortunately know a place that has a stash left!"
"D - Both a malt bomb and hop bomb at the same time. Just a bomb I guess. Just a big, bitter, malty, fruity, hoppy, badass beer"
"D- This is not a sessionable beer for me, but a really unique, and excellent brew. I can't wait to try the 12th Anni. I also need to go by my spot and see if I can pick up some more of these."
"This is a pretty good beer; a good amount of complexity and well balanced. Recommended."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. Delicious. Impressive and interesting. High ABV does limit the quantity that can be consumed."
"D - Yet another great beer from stone for a beer with near 9% abv its supper easy to drink what a great taste I could have drank it all night long Texas needs to get these limited releases so I can buy these"
"This beer is the darkest IPA I've ever seen. Stone calls this an IBA or India black ale. It is a deep and dark brown color with a full slightly dirty tan head on it. This beer left creamy rings of lacing until the very last sip. The scents that dominate this beer lean heavily towards piney hops, loads of tropical fruit like tangerines, mango, and passion fruit with a touch of caramel waving from the back row. My brain is perplexed at something that looks like this beer but smells the way that it does. The flavor profile starts with heavy floral hops notes providing plenty of bitterness, but the malt begins to show its assertiveness with dark roasted malt and dark fruits (plums and raisins) coming to life as the beer warmed. The finish brings back those hops with plenty of citrus and pine and showing you what Stone Brewing is famous for. The mouthfull is a bit chewy and sticky, but yet the finish is actually quite creamy. The drinkability is quite nice on this beer since the alcohol was extremely well hidden on this offering."
"Bomber: Aroma is nice hop texture to it with some slight lemon zest scents and a light rind texture as well. The malt notes are very subdued because of the hops but are vaguely present within the aroma. Pours a dark brownish black yet somewhat clear with a thick fluffy off white head that lingers around for quite a while. Taste is very citrusy and definite big hop characteristics. The light malt textures show through on the back end of the flavor. Palate is bitter on the tongue and nice and long lasting. With light malt notes later on in the aftertaste. Overall, A very interesting brew to say the least. Big hop textures throughout and quite a good drink. Cheers!"
"Excellent overall."
"Dark brown, with a full tan head. Ample aromas. Flavor combines dark fruits, light roast from the malt, with citrusy, rich hop flavors. I usually don't like big roast and hops, but this is different and in it's own league. Tastes similar to Double Bastard and Arrogant Bastard to me. Stone is right, the malt and hops are both well pronounced, but they don't clash at all. Very nicely balanced, as well as a ""Black IPA"" can be...this beer feels refined in every way."
"This is a very tasty & unique brew. Props to Stone for their way of thinking."
"D - My first black IPA and while the aroma was somewhat standard Stone hoppy IPA style the taste was a nice change from a regular IPA. I can't wait to try more beers similar to this style."
"D-Could definitely have a lot of these, if i could only find more."
"Honestly I remember the beer being hoppier the first time I tasted it, and I liked it a bit better then. There is still plenty of hop bitterness, but this beer has some age on it now and the hop aroma and flavor has started to mellow and fade a little. My score reflects to some extent my memory of the fresh beer. Still excellent now, but not quite as exceptional as it was. Who knows what it will become with even more age?"
"The taste starts hoppy, spicy, strong grapefruit, with a lot of fruit esters, spiced hop profile but a nice malt caramel back drop that allows for balance and quite delicious. What a unique beer fruity, hoppy, dark brown and delicious."
"What a nice strong ale from Stone. No surprise, I'm never disappointed with their products. Easy to drink and enjoy for sure."
"The pour produced a finger's worth of light brown head with good retention. The color was cola-like with ruby highlights. The nose had a malty sweetness to it, underlain by hops. The mouthfeel was medium with a licorice-like bitterness on the tongue. The finish had a chocolaty taste, but also smoky with a bit of bitterness. Mole, anyone?"
"Wonderful beer. Nice one to sip as a nightcap or enjoy while watching a movie."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, excellent representation of the ""Dark IPA"" sub-style, this is yet another very good beer from Stone that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Another winner from Stone that I wish I had picked up more of when i was released. A mistake I don't intent to repeat with XII."
"this is definately one to go down in the books"
"D: Quite drinkable."
"This is a very fine beer. Stone, you haven't let me down yet."
"A heavy beer at 8.7 percent... but interesting and not overpowering."
"Overall, stone's done it again. Like the arrogant bastard/double bastard, this beer is really good. Totally unexpected color, but that actually added to the score for me, and the aggressive-yet-balanced hopping of the beer is really pleasant to take in. Heck of a beer and gladly drink this again."
"Mouthfeel was full bodied, chewy (?)."
"D: I know that this is a new or hybrid style of beer but from the few that I have had I enjoyed this immensely. A perfect cross between IPA and Porter. Having bought four of these guys when they were released I had the luxury of aging the remaining three after my intail tasting and they are perfect right now! Recommended."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I let this one sit awhile. It had been one dimensionally big, now it's a solid hoppy black IPA... or whatever you'd call it. For an innovative, some might call it a novelty style, this isn't particularly different. It's not that I don't enjoy the beer, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't think twice before calling it an IPA in a blind taste test where I didn't know to look for the roasted malt."
"The roasted malts & signature Stone hop punch create a very interesting & complex cross-breed of a beer. I'm planning on getting my greedy mitts on as much of this stuff as i can. A true drinking pleasure."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body. Very smooth and enjoyable."
"If there's still any left out there, snap it up!"
"shipped Southward by the fuhrer of foam, dirtylou"
"An interesting creation for sure. A hybrid stout-IPA of sorts with equal proportions of bitterness coming from two different sources. Hoppy bitterness hits first and then a complete turn to roasted coffee chocolate bitterness. All in all I enjoyed this one."
"Two words here. Winter IPA. A brilliant concoction, keep a few for the holiday season '08!!"
"Poured from tap and had a nice brown head over the clear dark brown brew. Frothy head lasts and lasts, with ample sticky lace. Aroma is pungeant piney green hops. Taste is bit lacking in the chewy malts one might expect for such a dark color, but hops character and bitterness is excellent. It did have nice chocolate taste to it with that hoppy kick. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is great as well. Yet another anniversary brew from Stone that is worthy of the milestone."
"Interesting beer. Definitely different than the norm. Excellent overall, but a bit too bitter. Perhaps a little bit of age will bring this beer a bit more into balance."
"Pours a dark sludge brown with a big two finger tan head that dies down to a layer of big bubbles. Stickiness is pretty solid, no complaints there. Smell is interesting; pine hops, bitter cocoa, light citrus, and creamy caramel. A coffee aroma is present in the nose as well. Flavor is earthy hops from start to finish with some molasses and brown sugar. Pretty bitter as well, too bitter actually, sounds just weird associating that witch such a dark beer. The coffee grind flavor is there which adds more to the bitter effect. Very dry in the mouth with a full medium body. Strong carbonation on the tongue. I guess being classified as a Strong Ale is a pretty good fit seeing it beat the shit out of my mouth. I just wasn't feeling this beer. Maybe I'm crazy or just pissed off about Clarkson losing."
"GO UCLA!"
"Poured into a snifter. Beautiful obsidian color with a light khaki head. Nice head retention on this one. Moderate lacing. I read the bottle and it said IPA, but this appearance is throwing me off. Strong floral hop aroma, sweet pine, and a light dash of citrus. I am pulling some tart green apple. Some sweet malts makes this remind me of a barley wine. Very hoppy, slight citrus with a very sweet yet subtle malt characteristic. Great grapefruit taste. This makes me crave a barley wine for comparison. Definitely more hoppy than a barley wine but the malts are wonderful in this. The mouthfeel is a little on the dry side for my liking, but understandable with the high alpha hops. Mild carbonation. A nice treat. I am going to try to age one of these just to see what happens."
"A very tasty ale indeed. Slight bitterness with a hint of burnt malt. The flavors here blend nicely. I think I'll buy a couple of more and cellar them for a couple of months and try it again."
"22 oz bomber. The beer pours a deep deep brown color with a light coating of tan head over top. There is a mild stream of carbonation in it, and clarity is hard to gauge due to the dark color of the brew. Good looker here. The aroma is interesting. There is a nice pungent hop that is coming across very earthy and piney, though I imagine that fresh it was more brilliant. There is a strong malt backbone in there, with a good bit of bready and melanoidan toastyness. There is a hint of anise spicyness as well. It is an interesting mix. The flavor brings an initial hop that is slightly citrusy and earthy, this is followed by a peculiar malt flavor. I get bready and molasses qualities with an infusion of spicy anise. The hop bitterness really hits along with the sharpness that gives me a molasses. I find the bitterness to be a little too harsh for my liking. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a light carbonation. It has a bit of slickness to it. Overall, I think the flavors clash a bit in here. I find the hop bitterness to linger a bit too strong on my tongue. This one is certainly good, but I think it is a little too forceful and slightly unrefined overall to me."
"Is this a dark IPA or what? unique for sure, and very good. It reminds me of a dark version of the Tenth Ann. Ale (which is my favorite). It has citrus more then one would expect from a beer this dark... grapefruit? Hopps fill in along with some spice and caramel, then more citrus. Interesting beer, very good worth a shot!"
"Very much enjoyed this brew here in March, the weather was crap and the beer, its time at rest and the over-all result...It hit the spot!"
"Extremely dark with a small brownish head. Smell is extremely hoppy with an obvious grapefruit scent. Underneath there is a subtle burnt malt aroma. Taste starts off very hoppy, with citrus and floral, but fades into burnt malt and a coffee-like taste. Mouthfeel is good. The first time I had this I was slightly disappointed. I wasn't expecting so many hops. Knowing this my second time drinking this beer, made it way more enjoyable."
"Another great brew from Stone."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours an opaque, dark brown color. There was a fair amount of a tan head on it that lingers and leaves a good bit of lacing. The aroma is mainly pine, citrus and spicy hops. You can detect some malts trying to break through. The taste is a bit bitter, with a huge amount of malts thrown in. Some sweetness, roastiness, chocolate. It's almost as if they threw in a large amount of everything they had around, but they did it in a way that a nice balance was achieved. Very Nice!"
"D-The drinkability is pretty good, but the bomber is certainly enough for one sitting. Overall, I thik this is a little hot and bitter right now. I think this one would benefit from sometime in the cellar."
"A very tasty black IPA or American strong beer that can be very drinkable. I haven't noticed that alcohol but might once the bomber is through. Put another notch on your belt Stone"
"Overall- This one is a little overrated to me. Just a little bit too ""in your face"" but I guess that is what Stone is good at. All in all, good brew though. Very consistant for the brewery."
"What a way to kick off October. As I pour swear I've got a porter or a stout. A thick foamy 2 finger head quickly develops showcasing a rich tan hue. Body is jet black and really doesnt let any light thru even when held to light. Slight scattered lace is left. Nose has a very creamy hoppiness to it mixed with a vanilla based malt character. With first sip you get... oh what is this, smoooth well developed hop profile followed by a biscuity malty feel. Fresh fruitness gives some sweetness in the middle mixed in with some veggies and spicey malt. A hoppy burnt bitterness is left painted all over the mouthfeel. This beer is unique and hard to classify. I really believe it would balance and mellow very well with about a year of aging. Nicely drinkable now though."
"D: As this warmed up and I spent more time with it I started to like this a lot more. For its complexity and relatively high ABV this is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Cola colored pour, modest tan head with excellent retention and plenty of bubbles. Smoky, piny aroma: reminds me of a robustly hopped porter in the nostrils. Nicely chewy in the mouth. When served cold, hops are assetive in this beer, easily the strongest flavor. There are some faint suggestions of bread and honey mixed in there, but this is a hophead's brew. As it warms, balance appears, allowing a stronger malt profile to emerge. Reminds of pumpernickel bread or a dash of mocha. Strong as it leaves the mouth with a lasting bitter finish."
"The taste is though. Hopping comes on sweet and floral at first, a bit of citrus, rides out into a bittering and ends with a rind-ish drying, puckers up ever so slightly. Not a tongue lasher for sure, but no doubt this is a Stone. Underneath, there lies some tiny treats, roasted grains and some of those mysterious chocolates in the nose. Not overly complex, but nonetheless delightful. The mouth is rather smooth, the carbonation mellow, slightly warming, good body. Overall, I'm glad I got a few bottles of this."
"Black pour with a big tan head in a tulip. Smell is quite hoppy and some dark malt notes in there as well. Or maybe that is just my eyes projecting that on what otherwise is very IPA like. Taste is strong, bitter, and hoppy. Some dark roast flavors show up, but mostly what you'd expect from a strong rich heavy IPA. Light alcohol presence, but this is still nicely drinkable."
"Beer poured brown with ruby undertones when held up to light. Nose is citrus rind that is quite pungent. Taste is resiny grapefruit hops with a hint of chocolate malts that linger in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty creamy. Overall drinkability is good. This is a hop bomb with an unusual twist of having chocolate malts that make this an interesting beer. Recommended to hop heads!"
"Mouthfeel was rich and Drinkability improved as the beer warmed. This would not be a beer I would seek out again if I was looking for a high octane sipper. Not bad but not great either."
"Overall, actually a pretty drinkable beer. A respectable attempt at an unusual style. I would like to see Stone investigate this a bit more."
""
"22oz bottle purchased for $6 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a dark brown with little head but decent lacing. Hoppy aroma. Flavour is nicely hoppy with some lasting bitterness. Well balanced with a decent malt backbone. However, not all that different from a ""normal"" IPA. Good, but not extraordinary."
"Drinkability - makes me wish I had six more. Best hopper I've had in a while."
"Opaque black with a very large brown head. Settled down to a cap with lots of lacing. Smells hoppy like an IPA but sweet. Taste is dark and sweet malts, with lots of bitter hops. Mouthfeel is full, but well carbonated. Drinks very well, went though the whole bomber before I knew it. I'll be looking for more of this."
"Stone Eleven isn't as bad-ass as DOUBLE BASTARD, but it does have a remarkable quality that lends itself well to the Stone Brewing Co. lineup. It is definitely a recommendable brew, so drink up."
"Prosit, MK"
"D - 8.7% kind of stumps it, but I love it, makes me want a fresh 10th."
"Pours a hazy dark orange/brown, thick off white head forms, settles slowly dropping a nice lace ring, good retention. Smell is nice, chocolate and toffee, solid roast, lots of pine and floral hops, roast, grapefruit, nice balance with the malts and hops. Taste is similar, caramel and chocolate, roast coffee, light alcohol, nuts, oranges, grapefruit and floral, solid bitterness, excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, bit of warmth. Very good beer! Thanks Jay."
"Very nice balanced beer here. I think I would actually prefer this with age as one thing I've noticed with all Stone beers is that they all seem to blend into each other when young. Not sure if they only use one predominant hop or malt in everything or what? Burnt malts and blackerry flavors are than overwhelmed with citrusy hops on the middle and chalky bitter finish. Some alcohol shows through in the mouth and throat but evens out in the chest. One of the better Stone beers I've had of late and nearly on par with Stone's 10th. This one had wonderful ageability even with the demise of the hops."
"Overall, a somewhat drinkable brew. Definitely worth a try for the uniqueness of the brew, but not something I'd look to as a daily drinker. Not bad, not great."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy with a medium body. Good steady carbonation. This one really hits the spot. It seems to disappear from my glass and a bomber goes down without a problem with no hint of alcohol in the flavor. Overall, I really enjoyed the 10th Anniversary and I'm happy to say the 11th is just as tasty. Cheers to the continued success of Stone and thanks to warriorsoul for the bottle."
"Extremely fragrant beer. Port and whine aromas mixed with pine, flowers, rasberry and cherries, and molasses. Pours very dark brown, if not black, with a small off-white head. Excellent lacing. Initial flavor is sweet burnt molasses and over the course of the long finish, it ends with a bitter salty taste, as well as some nutty malts being present. There is also an alcholic presence on the tounge in the finish. Great smelling ""Black IPA", but I have had better from Stone."
"This brew is going to age very well... don't let the naysayer change your mind .... it may go through a significant muddy period like the 8th, but ultimately, the 11th will be fantastic... I will not drink another for probably 6 months... ooh my.. I have another glass.. cheers. Galt."
"I have had several bottles of this beer. It is definitely changing with age, and is getting mellower. When first released the beer was very raw, with hops overdominating and destroying. The beer is mellowing nicely and the roasted malt qualities are starting to poke through. Definitely still a hop bomb. I am interested to see where this beer will go."
"Overall, this was an enjoyable beer. Bitterness was balanced enough to enjoy it. Full flavored. Good beer and worth a try."
"Highly recommended..."
"Very drinkable, I'm enjoying this one."
"This beer looks great and tastes great. Not used to the brown-esqe ale from this brewery, but enjoyed just the same."
"this is a great beer, i will be buying more."
"Stone should consider moving this into regular production."
"I would drink tis again and again."
"Fantastic brew and I can't wait till next year's offering. Cheers!"
"D- I just opened a bomber so we will see if I get through that. I think that I would drink this again. I am not a huge hop-bomb fan so it isn't my favorite though. Very odd that it is so dark. You don't get many dark malt notes in this. Seems like the color doesn't influence the taste at all."
"D: very good drinkability for its abv. could easily drink in multiples, very smooth palate going down, and nicely hidden alcohol."
"D: very hoppy, yet the intense malt backbone compliments it very well. A very unique ""IPA"" that is a sipper but quite delicious. Had to save some of mine for the next night."
"This beer is big in every way - malty, hoppy, high ABV. Although called an IPA on the bottle label. BA lists it as an American Strong Ale. I really appreciate beer like this that are hard to put in a single catergory. To me seems to have the strong hops prescence and mouthfeel of an IPA with the dark carmel malts of a porter or stout."
"I enjoyed getting a hop fix from a dark beer. Great brew - more then just a gimmick."
"Deep ruddy brown. Somewhat muddy in appearance. Floral and fruity aroma. Sort of ""burnt"" smelling. Quite bitter up front against a mellow malt flavor. Very grainy tasting. Long lingering bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is ok. A decent enough beer but I am not sure what its trying to be. I would like to see Stone do something with a little less hops in it. I mean, I am worthy and all but its time for a change in spots."
"Pours very dark with smells of alcohol and malt. Thick, tan head with good retention. Taste is mostly malty with a hint of hops. The alcohol smell doesn't really come through in the taste. Overall, the taste didn't match what I expected from a dark IPA. (What the heck is an IPA doing this dark anyway?!?!) I prefer more hop and less malt but overall I like this beer. I don't think I've had a beer from Stone that I didn't like. ;)"
"Served in a generic pint glass. Pours a dark, almost black body with a big frothy tan head. Hoppy aroma. Taste is impressive; big powerful hit of hops, but a touch of sweetness and maltiness that is balanced very well. This beer reminded me of a DIPA and an imperial stout that got together to make something new. The alcohol is present, but pleasantly welcome. Goes down quite nicely; another great offering from a brewery I wish would come to Connecticut some day."
"Kudos to Stone for being creative and taking a chance. This is a finely crafted gem to commemorate their eleventh anniversary. Admittedly, I am a sucker for over the top citrus hop taste and bitterness, and this beer satisfied that immensely, but unlike most super hopped up beers, this one added considerable nuances from the malt as well. Not only did I think it cool to have an almost black IPA (or is it a IDA or IBA?), but the malts added a lot to the overall character of this brew. In all, I would say this is one of the best beers that has ever passed through these lips. My wish is that Stone will bring this one back in the future, but for now, enjoy it while you still can."
"For drinkability, all I can say is yes, more please. As far as strong ales go I probably would enjoy this more than Arrogant Bastard... is that blasphemous to say? A fitting tribute to a lucky number 11 years and going strong."
"From a 1pint, 6 fl. oz bottle copped from Home Liquors in Verona, this magnificent brew pours a jet-black, ebony color with a tan, frothy head... looks and smells similar to a stout or porter, although the bottle claims this is an ale... big bottle with a picture of a winged devil lifting a beer mug behind a blue ""XI"" logo, with ""September 2007"" on the front... Paid about $8 for this one... chocolate, espresso aroma with a rich, creamy, thick mouthfeel... taste is strong with a chocolate, velvet, dark coffee flavor with strong cocoa notes... good mouthfeel and for an 8.7% ABV, you don't really notice the alcohol so much as the unique combination of flavors... a definite winner from Stone... one of the better brews from the company that I've sampled... Definitely recommended..."
"Overall: Full bodied with strong bitterness, yet fully balanced (as an IPA). Good, strong carbonation, just enough to savor for a long time and keep the beer moving. Just awesome. This is the third time I've had one of these and felt it was ready for my review. But there is even more in here. I like this beer even more because without knowing that Stone was creating theirs, I made my own Dark Double IPA at exactly the same time. I guess, since my mind was on the style it made me appreciate the effort more. It's great, think about it."
"Outstanding beer in my opinion. Definitely a unique offering and I wish it was more readily available. I'm glad I was able to grab a case because this has become one of my more favorite beers."
"d: Like I said earlier, this is pretty good, but aside from the novelty of a black hoppy beer, I'm not sure what the fuss is about."
"D- A very good beer. Shame it is not offer regularly and shame it was not available in DE when it came out. Luckily, I got mine at the source. Another enjoyable beer experience from Stone."
"Ballsy concept with good follow through. I like it but not love it."
"Overall, I'm blown away. But this brew is really in a category all its own. Putting it into the American Strong Ale category is stupid. It's a very unique brew that I would recommend to anyone looking for an intense experience all-around."
"Very intense beer that I will be getting again."
"Recommended. Still a very tasty beer. Was a touch better really fresh, but still quite solid."
"I thought I missed out on this one, but was delighted to find them in abundance at my local liquor store one day. Poured this from a bomber into a pint glass. Looks pretty much like a good porter or stout should. Black, with at least a two-finger head that retained itself very well. Edges are ruby red when held up to light. Lacing sticks on the glass all the way down. Huge hop presence in the aroma. However, there is a solid dark malt presence. Pretty complex. Taste is very hoppy, of course. However, there is a solid malt backbone that makes this fairly balanced considering the huge hop presence. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, almost syrupy. Actually, ""creamy"" is the word that comes to mind. Carbonation is moderately high. Alcohol is a bit on the high side, but still drinkable, especially if you give this beer the time and respect it deserves."
"Pours a deep black with the slightest ruby where light penetrates. nice off white/light tan head. The smell is of an IPA with a little bit of that oaked bastard smell. Maltfunk and some light spicy cream. The taste is a two headed beast. It starts off making you think it is going to be a strong IPA. The taste then mellows into that creamy kind of Oaked bastard taste. The finish has some good hop bitterness in the back of the tongue and throat, but is smoother than your average strong IPA. Mouthfeel is nice, not too thick, not too thin. Very drinkable and the abv is incredibly well hidden. Ive put two of these in the cellar just for the F of it to see what happens. ya never know!! Good offering from stone, and defenitely not what i expected by the color. This is the darkest damn IPA related sort fo kind of hoppy thing ive ever had. Good brew tho, go stone."
"D:AWesome!!!! What a great beer and huge surpirse. I was thinking a big porter of some form, but it turned out to be a awesome IPA. Certainly would age well."
"Overall another excellent offering from Stone."
"This is a poweful beer. Dark and basically black, it pours with a nice creamy tan head. Sort of a smoky flavor and sweet aroma at first- the taste is huge- lots of hops all over. You can notice the sweetness in the ale. It tastes like an IPA, but the smokiness makes it quite different and very enjoyable. Unique."
"A light brown color, with touches of red along the sides of the glass. A two inch thock head foems, beige in color, and lacing slowly down the glass. An incrdible aroma of citrus, mostly grapefruit, pine and grass scents, with a earthy mellowness. There is a surprisingly feint scent of malt at the end. At first taste that malt is very apparent, with a sweet, nutty flavor. That flavor is overtaken by a dominant hop presence, with grapefruit and grassy tastes being the strongest. A medium bodied feel all the way through, very consistant, coats the palate evenly and a dry finish lingers for some time. WOW! What else is there to say, this is an excellent beer. I thought the tenth anniversary brew was outstanding, this beer surpasses that one."
"D: Hits pretty hard at 8.7%. Great beer for an extreme hophead."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of India ink, with a decent tan colored head - nose of flora hops, and malt  taste is malty, with good floral hops, and resin/gummy quality - body is medium, and with medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of hops, and malt"
"This is a misunderstood BEAUTY. There are very few ""black IPAs"" on the market. Greg Noonan at Vermont pub and brewery used to brew one and I lived for it. This one takes the cake though. Its appearance is as exciting as the taste profile. The dominant hops are not overpowering so that the chocolate and roasted malts come through. I am not sure why this is labeled as American Strong Ale. It is not like Old Thumper or the old Magic Hat Red Ale, its an IPA on steroids, GREAT BEER."
"Pours a deep brown color with a full, persistent head. Aroma has a bunch of citrus hoppiness in there along with some nice roastiness that pushes through once you expect the hops. taste is all IPA at first, then a bit more of a dry chocolate malt flavor comes through. The malt sweetness seems to build as you drink, and the hop flavor also becomes more sweet and less bitter. Really an enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel is solid, maybe just a tad heavy for the workout the flavor gives you. Drinkabiity is also very good. Something interesting that I'd like to see more examples of in the future."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer overall. Fairly balanced with respect to hops and malts. Smooth and full-bodied mouthfeel makes this brew a good session beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Jerc: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter hops with some light roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt with some west-coats bitter hops mostly dominating. Body is quite full with some great carbonation and alcohol is not apparent. Interesting take on the IPA style but nothing really earth shattering."
"D- The drinkablity is down because of the high alcohol content and the bitterness. But, if you like IPAs, this is a good one, but not as good as Ruination."
"Pours a dark black that shows some red highlights when held up to the light. Two finger head that dissipates, but never goes away, laces the glass all the way down. Aroma is hops citrusy, piney, grapefruity hops with a faint biscuit/caramel malt in the background. Taste is more of the same bitter hops. Another great offering from Stone."
"D- This is a very drinakble brew, easily sessionable."
"Overall a pleasure to drink. Since there are really no rules on this style other than high ABV, this is a good beer. Sould have bought another when I had the chance. Stone needs to come to Wisconsin."
"I first tried this on tap at the Hop Devil in Manhattan several months ago, but finally got around to trying a bomber over the holidays. It pours black with a tan colored foam but smells like a strong IPA, grapefruit citrus dominating. The taste is mainly hops, I don't get much of any roasted malt that other reviewers have mentioned. Very good as Stone always produces good IPAs."
"This was definitely an interesting beer. I'm not sure if I'd describe it as a hopped up porter or a dark IPA, but it's good, and that works for me. Stone is definitely going to have a hard time topping this for their 12th anniversary, but I am definitely looking forward to it."
"Id say this beer leans more towards 'black IPA' than 'very hoppy stout'. The IPA characteristics take the front seat here. Mmmmm hops."
"A good, original beer. An interesting bridge between styles."
"As I drink it, the bitterness becomes a little more intense and off-balance, but it still rocks. I do prefer Black Rye to this as it's just as intense but a scoche more balanced, but this is still damn tasty good."
"This has to be the least enjoyed of any Stone beer I have tried."
"D- more!!!!"
"D: I could drink this every day if possible. I am really pleased; another ringer by Stone."
"A Great One, a very good IPA with added thickness from chocolate malt. Pours dark and foamy, hoppy, ahh! the taste of citrus C-hop, (there is also Amarillo and Simcoe) and the c-hop aroma. Background roastiness. Full mouthfeel. Delightful as a meal in itself."
"Stone XI poured a deep ruby color, more along the characteristics of a Stout than a brown ale. The head was dark, rich, and had a ""surge"" similar to a Guinness. The smell had a noticeable aroma of earthy hops and a slight roasted malt undertone. The taste was true to the aroma; it had a solid roasted malt character that sat well on the tongue and faded gently into a distinct and enjoyable hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very good, a nice body but not heavy or thick. This beer is quite drinkable, but be careful to enjoy in moderation or it will bite you back. Enjoy!"
"In the 11th Anniversary Ale, the hops are mingled with the chocolate/coffee taste from porter, but not flawlessly so. But it is a fun diversion and I am glad I came across this one."
"Wow! Definitely one to try. I wasn't sure what to expect as its only listed as Stone XI and mentions a dark IPA on the back. Pours a brownish-black color with ruby accents around the perimeter. The head is a little too over abundant and hangs around in thick 1-2"" clumps after finishing a pint. As it warms the head only multiplies in following pours, leaving long yearning minutes of undrinkable beer due to a mountain of foam. Smell is intoxicating! A porter?, an IPA?, BOTH! Smells of toasted oats and grain while balanced by a hoppy aroma, slight citrus note, porter and some barley wine qualities. This is among Stone's better brews as it is an ensemble to the sense. Let this beer sit from the fridge for awhile and it's definitely a treat."
"Wow."
"On draught at Vintage Estates in Boardman (1 of 7 kegs in the state I understand). Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium and lasting tan head. Sticky rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a cross between an Imperial IPA and a roasty Porter. Loads of citrusy hops in the nose, with a full roasted malt undertone. Other aromas like pine and toffee are present as well. Rich and bitter with a full array of citrusy and piney hops flavors. Toasted malt and chocolate flavors are found too. Slow alcohol burn through it all. The finish is long and bitter with a tasty grapefruit hops finish. Excellent overall. Once again Stone manages to do something unique and enjoyable."
"D: The 8.7% abv is very well hidden under all the flavor. Normally I'd expect to tell you that the alcohol appears as it warms, but I've been through several bottles of this (not all tonight) and I'm now certain no bottle is going to last until it warms. Great stuff!!"
"Another great Anniversary brew from Stone. This is very interesting and complex. I was a huge fan of the 10th Anniversary brew, and the 11th is right up there with it."
"Poured into a Stone pint glass a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, which then leaves some nice small islands and thick sticky lacing. The nose is mostly malty, very slight hop tones, and lots of caramel. The taste is very malty, some hops, and caramel. The finish is dry and slight bitterness to it. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Full body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from Stone, very much a joy to drink, highly recommended."
"D: Im not sure how I feel about these hoppy dark beers. Tasty but they arent one of my favorite stylesnot yet at least. Regardless, this is a delicious beer with fantastic balance."
"On-Tap, city beer store, sf, ca. This is a dark brew, near black russett brown with haloed edges of caramel/ruby. Aromas are of a hoppy IPA but also there is some roasted and chocolate maltin there as well. This is kind of a cross between death and taxes and racer 5. The malt background is nice and the hoppy/piney/citrusy middle smooths out into a chocolate caramel coated hop finish of roastiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and helps this beer achieve a solid drinkability level. Nice one."
"The abundance of flavor really hides the alcohol nicely. I really enjoy this beer, I only wish it was available here in Missouri (thank god for mail-order beer!)."
"Stone 11th anniversary pours a deep black with hints of red when held up to the light. It has a creamy brown head that lingers nicely. The aroma is sweet and malty with loads if citrusy hops. There are hints of darker malts, but not as much as I would expect from the color. The flavor starts with sweet dark caramel, but it quickly gives way to bitter, citrusy hops. If I wasn't looking at the color of this beer I would just assume it was a big resiny DIPA, but if I look for them, the roasted malts come through in the finish. The alcohol and strength are both well hidden, probably because the beer is just overboard with flavor."
"D - This beer is impressive in craftsmanship. Nice black color, all IPA in flavor. It is not something I could see myself drinking many of, but is tasty-it kept me coming back. This ale isn't what I consider complex, but makes its point well and is very drinkable. Shame it is only around for the Anniversary."
"I knew this was referred to as a dark ipa but from a distance it could have been a stout with its dark color with ruby edges with a cream like head. Not much on the nose, a bit estery with some roasted smell. A great mouthfeel to this very smooth with little to no carbonation. Some dark fruit and black licorice as well as some little maple syrup Very easy drinking beer but I can feel the effects after one bomber."
"Interesting for sure. Im not sure how this goes as per American Strong Ales, but this seems to be an odd duck."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure this warrants outstanding from me. The 10th I thought was a lot more ballsy and out of this world. Though it was higher alcohol and more sought after I suppose. I do, however, like the experiment, and I have a feeling that this can be a kind of strong ale to set the standards for more like it, with the odd-enough and unheard-of hybird, at least from me, of IPA and Porter, which this beer does, somehow, quite singularly and successfully. Certainly beyond worth a try if you can find a bottle. And even if you wouldn't go for such a style, this isn't going to be around for long of course."
"The beer emerges from the 22-ounce bottle a sparkling deep brown, the head a crown of light chocolate, creamy and long lasting, after its final demise the lace forms a thick blanket to cover the glass. Nose has a profound hop floral spiciness at the front, backed by the sweet malt, caramel, and maybe a hint of chocolate, mouth watering. Start has a nice malt sweetness; hop bitter bite to the back, top is moderately full in feel. Finish has a determined acidity, the hops potent and spicy; the alcohol warms the tummy while the aftertaste continues the hop spiciness."
"Drinkability: Tasty, deceptive, and great. I'm sure you've had this by now, and if not, try it. Not as great as some proclaim, but a step in a new direction."
"A bit of bright orange and grapefruit pith, then a round of chocolate and coffee grounds..I'm enjoying that!"
"This is a very nice ASA and I rate it pretty high on the drinkability scale despite the high abv."
"Drinkablity is about average. The booze is certainly there, and I'm not to fond of grapefruit juice, even if it is as sweet as this. However, like most Stone brews, that second half of the bomber goes down way to quick! Still, I couldn't really take to big of a swig, that weird sweet and sour combo was just too much. I had this right when it came out, and this one tastes about the same, maybe a hair sweeter, but I think the store kept it chilled the past 3 months, as the hops are still in full effect. I'm gonna cellar one just to see what happens in about 2 years. Sure the hops will fade, but dark beers really develop well in my experience, and I expect a whole new animal by then."
"I've been drinking the Stone Anniversary Ales since 7th and haven't been blown away by any of them. Keep in mind that this is in comparison to Imperial Russian Stout, Ruination IPA, IPA, et al. 11th is probably my favorite and is a beer that deserves a repeat purchase if I'm lucky enough to run across a few bombers again. Don't age this one. Drink it now."
"Review from notes: drank during the Pitt-Baltimore game a few weeks ago. Go Lers."
"Stone 11th Anniversary Ale looks marvelous! It pours a dark brown, almost black color with a three finger, frothy tawny-brown head. Hops come through on the smell with a hint of malt and almost licorice. Grapefruit and orange hoppiness dominate with some bready malt flavors submerged in the mix. The hops are aggressive, not overly bitter, but would mitigate my desire to drink this brew all night long."
"drinkability - Not a bad drink, looks like a porter but wasn't. Would buy agin, can't wait for 12th ann."
"Really, I love this beer.And I'm happy finally to be able to say that about a beer from Stone."
"Good body. Alcohol seems pretty well hidden to me. Interesting beast this one is."
"drinkability is good. the bitterness feels a little high and out of balance, but that'll settle out with time. the solid malt base holds it all together and the alcohol is hidden fairly well. i can see this one coming together nicely with some time in the cellar, but it's still quite good now."
"D: This is a dangerous brew, since it is very drinkable and does such a nice job of masking the 8.7% ABV. I haven't had a bad Stone beer yet, and I think this might just be my favorite. Frisco has 7 of the Stone beers on tap right now in preparation for a tasting tonight - wish I could be there."
"Get it. Drink it."
" Good drinkability, although i wouldn't session this one, she's got some bite to er. Very good."
"Excellent."
"There's a lot to like about this beer, and I'm glad I tried it. One thing you can always count on from Stone is a finely crafted and interesting brew."
"pours deep brown almost black smells like a coffee and some fruit citrus and piny smells. very aromatic. taste is amazingly smooth and very balanced yet complex lots of different flavors exactly like what you smell instead of the high alcohol overwhelming the taste it warms you up with every drink. i love this stuff hopefully ill be able to get some more before its gone forever"
"Notes: This is the best American beer I've had for a long time. Really impressive stuff."
"Lots of hop bitterness. Good malt backbone. Long dry finish with plenty of hop bitterness and a lingering chocolate. Very drinkable. A unique beer that was great fun to drink. Schwartz IPA?"
"This is an amazing beer and I hope I can find more of it. Too bad its a one time batchthis is my kind of IPA."
"One of the easiest to drink strong ales I've had to date. I wish this was part of the stone line up for the rest of time."
"A pretty decent IPA, if I do say so. A bit dark on the color, but, still, very nice. Heavier in body and flavor than the arrogant bastard and lighter in body and bitterness than the double bastard. Reminds me, somewhat, of Rocket Red. Obviously, it doesn't taste like that, but the flavor profile reminds me of it. Pretty good. Almost 9%? No wonder I got toasted off one bottle (22oz)! You wouldn't know from drinking it..."
"The aroma is a surprising pine citrus , thick and juicy. Moves right into the quaff, juicy pine bubblegum. Smacks with citrus and a hint of chocolate malt in the finish. This is one loaded up brew, sips like a dream while watching football and working on some cheddar and crackers."
"Drinkability - I love this beer! Goes down easy. Reminds me of a west coast DIPA mixed with a good porter. Highly recommended!"
"Another Stone Masterpiece."
"D - Hop heads now have a leader in the ""dark"" side of the color spectrum. A bit hoppy for me but a treat none the less."
"Drinkability was very good. Doesn't really feel like a big heavy beer. One of the most unique beers I had in the festival and most unique beers up to this day."
"The taste again is strong of hops but is well complemented with a variety of dark roasted malts. The bitter hops really linger well throughout the finish. A well balanced medium body and a creamy mouthfeel make this beer quite drinkable considering it's complexity. This beer is a beautiful blend between a powerful IPA and a classic strong ale."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is an interesting beer. Kudos to Stone for making this unique beer. Not my favorite Stone brew, but this is still tasty and well worth a try."
"D: I want more! But it is 8.7%"
"Overall a great looking beer, great hop flavor without the bitterness, decent drinkablity."
"A Black IPA? and a fine one at that! It pours as Black as the Ace of Spades, with a nice head, that reduces to fine lacing that holds for the entire beer. The aroma is sweet hops that strike the nose. The first sip gives wonderful mouthfeel as the hops explode in your mouth. The aftertaste was great, leaving you longing for the next sip. This was an exceptionally great beer that can only be improved by year round production from now till the end of time!"
"I think this is one of the most hop crazy beers I've had in a long time. Be wary!"
"D- WOW, this beer is pure joy. This brew is the answer for us stout lovers who are also closet hop heads. I couldn't possibly recommended this brew enough"
"D - I wish I had more bottles!! A great IPA example! Love the hops, love the beer! This one is disappearing much too fast."
"d: interesting mix of ipa hoppiness and stout roasted malts that packs a punch. not the best stone brew i've had but still enjoyable"
"Stone Brewing Company for President!!!"
"Drinkability = 8.7% alcohol and comes in 1.5 pint bottles so not tooo many!"
"Drinkability: As the beer warms, it just gets better and better; a hopheads delight with a molasses twist"
"Solid black color with a giant three fingers of sticky rocky beige head that last the duration. Big hoppy grapefruit and pine with an outstanding malt character of dark caramel, nutty malt and wafts of roasted coffee. Layers of malt character is evident; caramel, deep roasted grains, pumpernickel bread, and sour grains going into the finish, and roasted espresso. Beautifully balanced hops; mild pepper spice, pine, fresh raw hop oil, and a touch of mint starting towards the end. Fruity tartness mixed in for extra complexity. Sweetness from brown sugar and burnt sugars with hints of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is full, smooth, and a thick creamy carbonation. Spicy, minty, some pine, charred malt, and espresso all in the finish. This beer is just wonderful, Ive got to find more!"
"Overall: WOW!! Stone really innovates with this one and messes with your head. Looks like a porter and tastes like a whack in the face IIPA. Enjoy this beer while it's still around. Ill be said to see it go"
"D: Drinkable to the max. What a surprisingly dark treat."
"Another great beer from Stone. I don't think these guys do anything wrong. A black IPA is a cool concept that I hope to see again in the future. Keep it up over there at Stone. I have yet to not be crazy about any of your brews."
"Looks like root beer, smells like hops. Nice fluffy tan colored head that sticks around for a good while. Good lacing. Aroma is mosty piney and sappy with nuances of caramel and suggestive chocolate. Some leafy suggestions as well. Very hoppy with bitterness throughout, yet some malty sweetness comes through, too. Pretty balanced and drinkable. The roasted malts make for an interesting twist on what would be, typically, an imperial IPA. Kind of feels like an ""imperial stock ale"". I like it, it reminds me of of an ale I brewed 10 years ago, except the Simcoe hop was not around then and Cascades were used and I, accidentally, used a bit too much chocolate malt in the grain bill. Anyhow, Stone's 11th is an agreeable ale worth checking out."
"Pours a very dark, almost black color. Small head settled fairly quickly. Aroma is chock full of citrusy hops. Flavor is also tilted towards citrus flavors, with hints of coffee, dark chocolate, maybe even some peat somewhere in the mix. Initially the mouthfeel seems a bit harsh, but that fades very quickly to a full boddied brew with a slightly fizzy finish. Another well rounded offering from Stone. I'm not sure if this beer is trying to be a dark IPA, or a very hoppy porter, but whichever it is, it does it quite well."
"It's a great looking and great tasting beer, and I really enjoyed the dichotomy between the black body and strong hop character."
"All in all this is another great Stone offering. Happy 12th! They have to start distributing to NC so I can buy their awesome beer constantly."
"Wow, what an interesting beer. Extremely well balanced all around - hoppy and bitter, but not too over the top. Excellent and very well crafted."
"Highly recommended for the advanced hophead."
"This is a dangerously drinkable beer."
"Pours a mostly opaque dark brown color with a nice huge, pillowy, off-white head. Tons of resin and pine with a touch of citrus in the nose. A little bit of licorice and chocolate is also there following the hops. A very subtly carbonated beer brings forth a freshly hopped beer rounded out by lots of caramel and chocolate malts. The finish is quite bitter and dry with the hop flavor carrying through. This is an exquisite beer, I'm glad to enjoy it at this date as any more aging would kill the fresh hop flavor. This style seems to be a trend with Avery's Anniversary beer and perhaps started by DFH India Brown Ale. I love hops and chocolate malts, and I love them together. Great job Stone."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a medium plus body. The carbonation is well done. The flavors last a long while. This was a very satisfying and great tasting beer. I expected nothing less from Stones. Thanks to Stones Brewing for a most excellent beer drinking experience."
"Dark dark chocolate brown with lighter edges. Tall, thick, glass-crawling, light cocoa brown head. Big citrus, pine, and scotch-tape hop nose. Roasted barley and coffee underneath with some dark fruits. Roasted malt and coffee up front; quickly followed by big, juicy pine and citrus hops. Flashes of fig and plum sweetness before numbing hops take over. coffee bitterness in the slightly warming finish. Interesting combination of roasted malt and assertive IPA-ish hops. Delicious. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Another delicious Stone Anniversary ale and an interesting one at that. Happy 11th and keep the good brew coming!"
"Notes: The darkest IPA I have ever seen/smelled."
" Body is nice and creamy, more like a stout than a strong ale. Nevertheless, it fits the big malt profile and high abv of this beer quite well. Although it runs a touch strong for everyday or session drinking, this is a very drinkable ale. Hail to the folks at Stone! I look forward to what they come up with during the next 11 years."
"I picked up a couple bottles of this while I was in Boston for work. With first pour, I knew this was an entirely different beer than one normally gets their hands on. I recently brewed a double black IPA and thought it was wonderful, but it pales in comparison to this. This is, undoubtedly, an Imperial Black IPA. The unbelievable hop powerhouse aroma unleashes itself immediately. Massive pine and grassy overtones explode in the nose. Sticking your head in a bin of freshly picked hops is comparable to this smell. Jet black body with beige head. Lacing was intense and carbonation was lively. The taste was all IPA from beginning to end. Wonderful hop presence throughout with a warming alcohol taste. Maltiness is there but well hidden behind the hops. Sharpness is intense but very enjoyable. The high abv is hidden behind the IBUs. This is a wonderfully crafted beer that hop heads need to try. I would love to know how they managed to get the dark body without the roasted bitterness. For my Black IPA, I cold steeped de-bittered black malt for 2 days. This a superb beer."
"Please make this beer again stone. Wonderful."
"M/D: Carbonation is just right, full bodied. Drinkability is fine on this one but it is definately a sipper. This is a damn fine beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Kudos to Stone for the Mouthfeel on this brew, I don't think that I could imagine it any other way. The beer is incredibly smooth, has low carbonation-which one doesn't notice until one thinks on it, then realizes that it is the perfect amount. This is a beer I'd drink all night, alcohol is hidden pretty well, slight spiciness as formerly mentioned and a slight warming in the stomach. This is a beer I'd definitely buy again, think that I'll grab another bomber next time I see one. Too bad it is a limited release, I'd like to see something like this around more, seems to me that Dark IPAs are pretty rare."
"Hard to desrcibe the taste other than a dark IPA. It really worked for me. The piney hops with some of the typical darker flavors (chocolate/coffee) worked very well. The alcohol starts to creep in after a few sips and warmed me nicely on a cold night. I would seek this out again and encourage any beer afficianado to do the same."
"A very big, but drinkable offering from Stone. Check it out if you can."
"The taste is superb with a very good blend of hops and malt. The bitterness and alcohol flavors are apparent and get stronger toward the bottom of the glass. The mouthfeel is light bodied and very very taste. This is one of the best beers I have tasted."
"Cola brown as it poured from the bottle. The head was active and bubbly at first, then settled to a thin mousse; left no lacing on the glass. In the glass, the color was dark brown with some deep red visible against backlighting. The smell is rich with both sweet malt and spicey hops. The mouthfeel was fluffy as though this were a cask-conditioned beer. Interesting! There are definite dark-roasted, slightly burnt notes in the flavor. The burnt malt flavor dominates the hops hops somewhat, so the hops in the smell are stronger than in the flavor. This is a very interesting hybrid style. I wouldn't want to to drink it all the time, but it is fun as a one time brew."
"I'm disappointed in this offering."
"good drinkability, does a good job cleaning up after itself for a probably substantial malt bill. the total package is excellent though and if i had to give it an overall score it would probably be higher than how these ratings add up. expertly crafted. if i had a vote for one of stone's one shots to become a regular, this would be it."
"D - Overall very smooth drinking, with interesting tastes and pretty well balanced. Not bad, but more complexity would have been nice."
"Drinkablility is quite low. I choked the beer down, in fact, almost sent it back for something else. Guess what, Stone is the new Rogue. Let's throw an overload of hops into a bunch of different base beers."
"Pours a deep brown, almost opaque, with a thin head and good retention. Aroma has big hoppy notes mingling with fruit - and the hops are complex and aromatic, nice. Flavor has a chewy, fruity malt backbone with fragrant, pine-tinged hop flavor and bitterness. This one is like juicy-fruit in a glass, another excellent beer form a brewery well known for its fine, hoppy ales."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/12/beer-othe-moment-stone-11th-anniversary.html"
"The mouth is medium - thick, with a biting carbonation and a slight alcohol burn. It is a very drinkable beer"
"Overall, I liked this beer. It's a complete surprise to have such a hoppy beer after it pours more like a stout. Stone was trying to mix things up a bit here, and it's a nice change. I think this will really be something in a year's time. Recommended."
"Good old Stone. Razing my taste buds as usual."
"Pours the darkest of browns,with a nice creamy tan head. Very good retention,and lacing. Smell is of piney,earthy hops,with an underlying sweetness. Medium bodied with some carbonation. Taste has a roasted edge, nicely bittered through out. This is a serious beer,but one per session would be it!"
"This beer poured dark/black color with a huge cream colored head  nice lacing and lots of retention. The aroma is strong of hops with a sweetness that is perceptible. The taste is bitter and very hoppy with an entangled sweetness from the malt. The finish leaves a nice hoppy taste. The mouthfeel is full and it lingers with an oily feel on the back of the tongue. This is a serious beer that is great, but may not be the easiest to drink freely."
"Hope you have AT LEAST 11 more anniversaries, Stone. You guys are incredible. I just wish they offered your entire line-up in Texas."
"I just have to second many of the thoughts of those that enjoyed this beer. Though I read the reviews before drinking (I already had purchased two bottles), I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. They experimented with this beer and really hit the mark in my estimation. Simply, I just wanted to give further props to a beer that is not only interesting, but pretty damn good to drink as well."
"Don't let my confusion steer you away from giving this a try. I'm not saying it's bad; in fact, I'm saying it's amazing. It's easily one of the most complex beers I've ever sampled, one that's challenging on every level. If you can still find a bottle, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot."
"D - Such and unusual style and color. Nice beer. I will be getting a few more..."
"The 8.7% alcohol is well masked. Just another great beer from Stone."
"Bitterness rides the flavor all the way through. Smokey, woody, bitter coffee, chocolate, and a somewhat pronounced smoked jerky flavor. Hop profile is earthy, green, grassy, and citric. Alcohol warmth is there but subdued. Unique flavors, they mesh well."
"I've missed the other 10 anniversary ales as I am only 2 years into my beer exploration journey. I have come to love Stone's offerings and was excited when I saw this one at the store. An absolute opaque black in appearance, with a nice light tan head. Lots of intense pungent hops in the smell. Smells like a Stone beer, it just has that smell that the Stone beers have. Wow! Lots of sticky piney hops in the taste but still sweet. With the color I was expecting some roastiness, but no there isn't any. An interesting concept brew (I'm guessing that's what it is... never heard of a black IPA before). Can't wait to see what they come up with for next years anniversary."
"This is one different beer, but its really good. This beer drinks, smells and tastes like a mellow IPA but with the hints of roasted cofee and carmel youd expect from some porters or a quadrupel. Quite unique, if you get the chance I suggest trying it."
"I think you should run out and buy a few of these."
"Beer was poured into the glass was inky black, no light would show through. 3 finger head, head dense and smoky in color. The smell of the beer was overwhelmingly one of grapefruit, odd but welcome. Taste was a blast of hops. Very bitter followed by a hint of sweentness. Again grapefruit taste at the very end. Mouthfeel was smooth with a bit of sharpness to it. An exellent beer, well worth the money I spent, but it is a one time thing I dont think I want another and least not right now."
"Overall impression: Impressive color without roastiness. A hop kick to the palate. I like the darkness with the hop blast. I'm not sure what all the controversy is about surrounding this beer. The hops have just enough sweetness to balance, the alcohol is hidden well, and this is a well-made beer. Pretty much everything you sign up for when you buy a Stone beer. It won't be subtle. It's not sessionable but it's definitely a treat to be savored. Strongly recommended."
"drinkability: If you do anything other than sip this you aren't going to be able to recover and you'll be taking in sharp hops the whole time. Great if you have the time to drink it. I had to split the bomber into two sessions."
"drinkability: a sipper for sure"
"D: Complexity, balance, and an arsenal of flavor, this beer is fantastic. I expected nothing less from Stone, but was still blown away by what I got. This one should definitely not be missed, and even though it's flavors and alcohol are dialed up, it is remarkably drinkable in nature."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" brown head over the clear dark brown brew. Frothy head lasts and lasts, with ample sticky lace. Aroma is pungeant piney green hops. Taste is bit lacking in the chewy malts one might expect for such a dark color, but hops character and bitterness is excellent. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is great as well. Yet another anniversary brew from Stone that is worthy of the milestone."
"About drinkability: Do I want another one? Yes. Do I want it right now? I think I'll wait."
"D--This is a very drinkable beer, I recommend it highly. One of the better beers I can remember having in my time on this earth..."
"D- There is a fine taste in this beer but it isn't mind boggling just hops hops and some hops. While I notice the balance in terms of bitter/sweet, I'm hard pressed to detect any malt flavor in the nose or taste. I liked this beer but not enough for the price and not that special for an anniversary beer."
"Younger35, you're still the man. Looking forward to the next exchange, sir."
"The nearly black appearance and the over the top hops content make this unique. I appreciate both alcohol and hops, but I can't drink too much of this however, without the bitterness and alcohol becoming too overpowering( hence the lower drinkability score.)"
"drinkability: I could drink this for a good long while...and have been in bottle a bit...but on tap hot damn"
"Had to pull out a special beer to celebrate UK's win over LSU. Even if I don't like this beer, this is a good day! The beer pours a lot like a dry stout: very dark brown, nearly opaque, and with a firm, withstanding head formation and retention throughout. It's basically a black beer. Aromas are very deceiving comming from a black beer; with a heavy citrus hop nose and backup notes of pine, lemon-grass, and charcoal. The beer tastes similarly from the hop's side. But the beer has a different story too: the malts. The sweet malt character is very similar to the candy-sweet flavors found in Belgian Dark Strong beers -- but without the yeasty, peppery, phenolic twang. This beer is all American with a high attenuation rate and hop domination throughout. Though the hops side and malts side make the beer enjoyable, they may be two separate beers, caught in the same bottle and need much more melding together to do. As is, it's a firm DIPA with challenging malt character. Good beer, but time will surely do it some favors. But as American Strong Ales go, I prefer Arrogant Bastard."
"overall, a big beer to celebrate another year for stone. well done to them. and a beer for the rest of us to celebrate with. hmm, what will i celebrate tonight?"
"Drinkability: I made it throught the bomber, and would have it again if it was free, but I don't understand why it's so loved. I think the bastards are better strong ales, and i'd rather have a straight up dipa if i want the aggressive hops. It's still good though, and worth a try."
"Overall, this brew rocks. Stone creates another beauty."
"Drinkability is great, seems more people making a rich hoppy porter like brew and for one I am enjoying them. Hope they get more of these in only had a couple guess I am lucky to get a couple here in Bristol but I want more."
"D-It is a good brew but wouldn't say it's anything I couldn't live without. I'll drink the rest of the ones I have but won't be buying any more."
"Drinkability is good for an 8.7 ABV, quite sessionable indeed."
"Very thick,full and syrupy. Rough drinkability,unbalanced would have like some maltiness in there,maybe with some aging. A sipper for sure,just one at a time please. If you a hophead enjoy it now,if not might want to sit on this one a bit."
"D: Man is this beer good. I may just have to go buy a few more bottles of this before it's gone. The taste makes this one a sipper, but you could really gulp these down. Of course, the alcohol catches up to you. The balance is just awesome here. Please god, let more people make black IPA's. Seriously. Great work from Stone, as always."
"I've pretty much run out of things to say about Stone, so I won't even bother. Just know that this beer lives up to the brewery's lofty standards. If you like big IPA's and are a fan of Stone's beers, then you have to give this a try. But you already knew that, didn't you?"
"650ml bottle from Henry’s Market. Pours a deep dark coffee brown color with a khaki head that has plenty of lacing and fades very slowly. Aroma is pungent with hops, grapefruit, oranges and walnuts. Flavor is ripe with oranges, green cedar, burnt toast and bittersweet chocolate; all set in a biter hops backdrop. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with light but distinct carbonation. Finish is more biter-sweet chocolate and hops. This concoction tastes (to me) like a three-way cross between Arrogant Bastard, Ruination IPA and Smoked Porter. I love it. I may get a case to stash away, this should age very well. Wow. Recommended"
"Overall, this is a good beer. I guess it is one of those situations where you look forward to something for too long - a year! The complexity is good, but the balandce is not. It is great for a hop head that likes it dark, but I don't expect to be desperately seeking this one out like I was with last year's beer."
"Cheers!"
"More of a Double Black IPA than the Black IPA name it has earned. It is reminiscent of a Black Ruination, but slightly lacking."
"D--Lots o hops and a good malt backbone...what more could you want. I really enjoyed drinking this offering from Stone...another fine offering! I could easily drink 2 or 3 in a row...well done!"
"my tongue says ""i see what they mean by black ipa"". though not featuring the sweetness or body of an RIS, some of the darkness limps through the hop front line. it's minimal, but comes through with a more roasted note. there's a touch of bitterness from the malts that plays with that of the hops. lots of high AA NW hops"
"I've never had anything like this beer before, but I'm very intrigued by it. My best description would be to call it an Inverse Imperial Stout. It's clearly a DIPA first and foremost, but with a really cool twist. I can't wait to drink my others."
" Stone has never let me down before, and judging by this 11th anniversary ale, they probably never will. Well done sirs."
"Poured into a tulip tasting glass. One word to describe how this beer looks, ""beautiful"". A very dark orangish brown with a 4 in head that settles to a nice frothy creamy brownish head. The nose roasted nuts with a little hoppiness in the background. I am really not sure how to describe the taste other than well balanced with a nice amount of bite due to the high alcohol content, but as stated before well balanced. The mouthfeel right amount of carbination slightly viscious and slippery. This is a big beer, as much as I would like to I could probably only drink a couple."
"Dark brown almost black in color. Nice fine foamed tan head that you would expect on a stout. Smell kills the idea that this is a stout right away. Big floral hops smell that just blows me away. This has to be one of the best smelling beers ever. Some sweet malt comes through in the background but it is really the floral smell that stands out. Taste is hoppy up front and then big malts kick in. Very sweet followed by a mild bitterness. Solid chewy mouthfeel that lets you know there something behind this one. Once again a solid beer from Stone."
"Overall, this is a good DIPA, very much what you'd expect from Stone. On the flip side, there's not much to distinguish this from their other IPAs, aside from abv and looks."
"Drinkability: pretty much compels you to take another sip."
"D: Great stuff, but treat it with respect."
"Pours a deep opaque amber, almost black, with a tan head. Aromas of grapefruity hops, mellow, and non abrasive. In the taste, huge grapefruity hops and a smooth maltiness. A smooth, small bitterness mouthfeel and a grapefruity hop aftertaste. A hop bomb, interesting in color and style. I felt it tasted like an IPA, and looked like a porter, not bad for a strong ale."
"It's a tough one for me. On the one hand, I expect a Stone anniversary to be very aggressively hopped. But the idea of a black IPA is very intriguing. But any flavor or character that might make this unique as a black IPA is blown out by the extreme hoppiness. I like it but I can't help thinking about what could have been if the roast or black malt might have come through a little bit."
"Bitter, drying aftertaste from this medium body beer. This one's like a mix of a DIPA, porter, cream stout, and a strong ale. I wasn't sure at first, but as it warmed some it really grew on me. Stone does it again. If you can still find it, buy it."
"D - Hard to put down more than one or two I think, but an excellent ale none the less. Here's to Stone for another excellent brew!"
"Pours a rich dark brownish black color with cascading carbonation coming after the pour. Head is dark brown and a thick 3 inches that lingers and leaves a lot of great lacing. Aroma is hoppy followed by a toasted malt presence. I can also smell some grapes I believe. Taste is bitter followed by an overly sweet hoppy flavor, and a lot of raisins making this one seem like a barleywine type flavor. Mouthfeeling is oily and soft carbonation. Somewhat heavy on the alcohol."
"EDIT: It was so good, it inspired me to write my first review"
"D: I really think it's one of Stone's more interesting offerings of late. It's at least as good as the 10th, and will likely age more gracefully. I'd like to find a few more bottles, so I can test that theory."
"I am very pleased and would highly recommend this beer. It has Stone's predictable aftertaste. I can't quite pinpoint it."
" Overall I was not sure what to expect when going into this one. I knew I would be happy, being an IPA I very seldom am not. I was just pleased that it stayed true to the stone routes and was a nice hugely hopped vehicle. I love that about the stone products and really do appreciate it. I would love to see something like this on tap, or heck dry hopped on tap. This was a really great offering and something that I look forward to having a couple more of. Definitly have to give this one a try if you can."
"Drinkability- Well, this beer is interesting. I love the nose but thats about it. I think its a little sweet and a bit unbalanced. Its too sweet at times and too bitter at others. Maybe a little time would help this a bit but until then, this definitely isnt my favorite offering from Stone."
"D-A very interesting brew. You know this is a Stone beer all the way through. Kind of like a cross between their porter without smoking and the Ruination. I will pick up a few more of these."
"Good and drinkable but I REALLY don't think this has reached its best quite yet. This is a lot like a mix of Barley Wine and IPA and I think this will be better in two years after the melon flavor mellows out some."
"It sure is dark for such a hoppy beer, very strange. It's good and most drinkers will have a good feeling for this one."
"Bottom line: This is another great beer from Stone. Well done!!"
"Poured a rustic, maple in color which was nearly opaque. Creamy, white head that stands nearly half-inch high off of the tap and never really recedes, leaving thin, sticky lacing around the glass. Notes of bright, tropical fruit and balanced citrus, hop resin. Faint hints of mustiness along with a light biscuit aroma. The flavors are rounded tropical fruit: pineapple, peach, apricot; as well as, notes of ripe pine/spruce. Light breadiness; very clean, with just a hint of phenolic mustiness. Medium in body; smooth, light as a result of the hop profile. A Double IPA-tasting brew with some great flavors and balance. The 8.7% abv is nearly undetectable. A must try for Stone fans."
"Great creation by Stone. Can't wait to have my other one."
"Buy as many bottles as you can before this beer is extinct in a couple months!"
"This is one amazing concoction from Stone yet again! A delicious mixture of stout-like maltiness and a juicy and luscious hop character to boot! This is a must-have beer, and I must say I haven't had many like it (if any). Get your hands on one of these babies, if you know what's good for you!"
"Leave it to Stone to create a complex beer of difference. I'm not sure it fits in a current category. Strong Ale, Old Ale well not that either. Stone calls it a Imperial BPA (Black Pale Ale). Well for me it poured beautifully, The thick tan head above a midnight black beer looked like the perfect stout(especially poured into a pint guinness glass), but the taste is anything but that similar to a stout. The head faded as the beer was drunk leaving a perfect lace ring to mark each sip's journey down the glass. I'm not sure I can describe all the flavors I'm tasting. First there's a strong flavor of roast coffee, and burnt malt, followed by a winey, nutty middle, that ends with the dry astingency found in this brewery most noted of hoppiest of beer like their IPA and Ruinnation. The winey flavor and the roasted hops converge to leave a long lingering aftertaste you will long remember. I had this beer in bottle and on draft within the last three days, the most notible different was the draft version had a very noticable alcohol burn, I'd even call it a rush of warmth that doesn't come through in the bottle. I still want to lay down a bottle of this complexed bottle of flavors for at 8.70% ABV the changes can only be interesting. Do pick up a bottle!"
"Drinkability: definite slow sipping beer, but extremely satisfying on a flavor front. This could be considered a meal if one had an empty stomach. The alcohol does come through as you finish the bottle, so more than the one bomber bottle would be dangerous. Awesome beer."
"Easily drinkable, as the ABV is well hidden. I thoroughly enjoyed this bomber all to my lonesome, although next time I may think about sharing this one with a friend. Maybe."
"Very nice effort from Stone. I preferred last year's edition of this beer, but this is not bad."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that lasts. The aroma is great. It's loaded with rich malt aroma as well as tons of hops as well. It's quite complex with bit of roasted and black malts as well. The hops dominate the aroma. They're bold and add balance to a hefty malt bill. The taste is awesome. It has a pronounced roasted malt character. It's dark with a warming finish. It goes down hoppy and ends hoppy. What a beautiful beer. The hops resinate after the finish, but a lingering roasted malt taste remains. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass beer; one of the best IPA's I've ever had, black or not. I do enjoy the roasted character."
"I think its hilarious what name recognition does. I tried a VERY similar beer last week called BarrelHouse Boss Cox Double Dark IPA and all the reviews are substantially lower than here. Pours a very dark ruby, almost black with a couple fingers of lacy tan head that stays well. Smells of grassy hops and a little malt. Tastes malty with bitter almost pineapple hops with a different hop profile that Im now realizing is particular to this style. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation. Took a little time to finish. The better of the two Dark IPAs that Ive tried. Though its not a bad style, I still prefer is predecessor."
"Sone should just call this a black IPA and brew it on a regular basis. Not unlike Cincinnati's Barrel House Boss Cox Double IPA, but with Stone's signature hops array."
"Mouthfeel is good, despite a little dryness. Drinkability is above average, especially for a beer closing on 9% ABV. I'm a fan of this, its in the vein of Rogue's JLS #17 Brewer, perhaps not quite as well done, but tasty none the less. Makes me want to brew a porter and throw a bucket of hops into it!"
"Poured from bomber with much anticipation. One of the first ""limited release"" beers I've been able to find. Pours virtually black, some ruby hints with light, and a 1 finger tan head. Long lasting layer of head and nice lace trails left behind. Smell is strong of spruce, pine, and hops (cascade?). Taste is virutally the same. Strong hop notes up from with a bit of pine, notes of roasted grain as well and a hint of caramel, just a hint. Bitter aftertaste but smooth going down, light and crisp. A terrific beer!"
"D: It drinks pretty heavy but just tastes so damn good. I'll be picking up more of this every chance I get."
"This is definately a differnt kind of beer from stone and for that I give them my praise. It's really not my style of an IPA but I can't hold that against them too much."
"So its another big beer from Stone. The color is what makes it different, more than anything else. Might buy one more to cellar so i can see what lies beneath the hops, but only if i happen to encounter it in a store again before it gone."
"Drinkability is good as is with most of Stone's beers. I think I might like this one more than the much acclaimed 10th Anniversary. Another winner from Stone and another I wish would be a year round offering. Highly recommended"
"Drinkability: At first, I thought I would be dissapointed. But this beer gets better as you sip it, Almost half way done, and its real nice.. Very solid beer. Not dissapointed at all. Curious to try the 9th Anniversary tomorrow night, see how well its aged. Stone continues to never let me down.."
"Drinkability- Pretty sweet to be a session brew, in fact one bomber was almost a bit too much, but I wouldn't turn down a pint if offered. Another quality and interesting style brew released by Stone."
"All in all agreat beer, but it is a thinker."
"d - considering stone's big hop presence this just begs to be quaffed. easily drinkable and really goes down smooth."
"Notes: India Dark Ale???? The bottle states that the brewers kept everybody ""in the dark with this IPA"" and it really is like a hybrid of a few possible dark beer styles and an IPA. I guess Strong Ale is the only classification that makes sense but this beer has many characteristics of a barleywine, IPA, and even some stout and/or porter like traits. I guarantee some will love this and some will hate it, but everyone who appreciates craft beer should try it. Me, I'm a fan. I'll have to grab some more."
"Comment: I am not a hop head. This is a bit heavily hopped for me. However, I still enjoyed it. I think the bitter sweet malts and citrus flavors balance the hops pretty well."
"Overall, a very drinkable and unique beer."
"Overall excellent beer, VERY unique, I love that Stone always seems to suprise for their aniversary beer."
"As big as it is, much of the flavor, and the malt especially, is rounded and subtle, which is a testament to a fine blend of quality ingredients. It's a hoppy bastard but comfortably over-the-top, Stone-style. The punchy ABV is incorporated, and it warms agreeably, making the beer drinkable and fun, but also a touch dangerous. So, happy Anniversary, and thanks for letting me in on the celebration. And I'll revisit this one at six months and a year courtesy of my cellar."
"D - Wow! The abv is felt quickly. Distribution of this beer is wide, but, hell, I might pick up a few of these as trade bait for the future. I suppose the claim that it is not a stout and not a porter, but a black IPA is warranted. It is basically to a porter what an IPA is to an ESB. So really, it is a black IPA. I am guesing more breweries will produce one of these soon."
"i grabbed a half a case and i am kicking myself for not grabbing a full case...i will definitely be back at the store very soon to pick up a full case, this is too good..."
"Pours a dark thick head with heavy retention almost looks like a stout. Intense aroma of exotic fruits and spice. Hops are tantalizing every sip with smooth well rounded flavour. This beer reminds me of Hop Rod Rye but with a little more kick. I recommend you pick up a couple of these , one to sample and the other to enjoy down the road a bit. Once again Stone puts out another doozy for us to admire and crave for the next offering."
"Tasted like a Stone IPA with some chocolate, grape, and a bit of licorice. A little bit sweet, too--tremendous flavor. I could drink this all night."
"4/5/2008: bomber was $5.19 at Safeway liquor on Mill Bay Road, Kodiak, AK. Bottle states September 2007. Same same. Meh, even. No rating numbers changed."
"This is a good beer.Im glad I got to try it.Stone outdid themselves with this one.They need to redo this beer under a different name and make it a year long beer."
"Smooth and silky mouthfeel with some oiliness. I like this beer, but I prefer Arrogant Bastards hop character. Still very nice and highly recommended."
"The aromas from the ipa/porter/stout is a strong pine tree smell. It has a hoppy ipa flavor with a malty overtone and an alcoholic taste. The mouthfeel leaves the hoppiness on the tip of your tongue with a thin body the eels down your throat. I found this to be a money beer of this broad style."
"D: This one is too good not to be a regular in the lineup. Nearly perfect and a great hybrid style."
"The bottom line: An interesting anniversary beer by the folks at Stone. I like the hop character here, and I'm going to be sad when it is no longer available because it is currently in my active rotation."
"Medium-full bodied, moderate carbonation. I won't mind revisiting this one in the near future."
"GET SOME NOW! LOTS!"
"Served from a bottle into a pint glass, enjoyed with a good friend on a Friday evening. Appearance is very deceptive, I was expecting something overly malty and sweet given the dark reddish look of this beer. Smell is very interesting, very malty, extremely hoppy, but not overpowering. This beer tastes exceptional, very well balanced, very smooth and drinkable. Alcohol taste is masked easily by the loud flavors. This is definitely a beer that I would recommend to others and purchase for myself in the near future. I have never tasted a beer similar to this one, it seems like Stone definitely took it upon themselves to make their 11th anniversary a special one."
"Drinkability: Good smooth beer with an above average hoppy IPA characteristic. Highly recommended, I'm not sure how long my other bottle will last."
"Great beer, I bought a case."
"This is a totally different kind of IPA. It's dark, nearly black in appearance. The piney and esters of an IPA are there in the flavor, but you can't really taste any raw hops, and for good measure is kissed by some cocoa. The checker at the store said he didn't like IPA's, but he really enjoyed this offering. This isn't an aggressive beer like some of the other Stone products, but a rather mellow beer that won't tax your palate too much."
"Cool idea here - black IPA. I'd call it ""hop cocoa."" My only qualm is that there isn't more malt. The hops are near perfect, just riding the line of big, but not too big. The aroma is a very sweet fruity, reminds me of the Avery's big beers. The flavor has a get mix of hops flavors that change as the beer warms. It covers floral, fruit punch, citrus rind, and finishes with an herbal black pepper taste. Yummy. There's a touch of cocoa in the background, sort of like what baking cocoa adds to a mole sauce. So, a pretty great beer, I want more like this. Thank you Stone."
"Nice - a bit much - but, oh- so nice...hefty West-Coast hops with a charcoal, dark backing. Unique and ... well - get some of this!"
"I'm a fan of Stone because of their use of hops, and was pleased to see and sample this truly unique, tasty IPA."
"Don't miss it!"
"D - Good overall. Not TOO heavy."
"This is a very visually compelling beer. It has all the look of a darker, roasted malt beer. But, aside from looking the part, drinks like a double IPA. Has a heavy hop aroma, even a little ""piney"". Then goes onto a great hoppy flavor throughout the palate. Some people may wonder why a dark/black IPA? As I drank through the bottle, I was consistently impressed with the visual/physical contrast the XI presents. A great beer!! Hop heads should enjoy."
"D: Not bad at all, just very weird. Style guidelines be dammed."
"Pours an opaque darkness with mahogany hued edges and a two finger, stiff tan colored head that resists fading. 3D lacing follows in its wake. The smell is akin to an aggressive Double IPA. The aroma is primarily a grapefruit hop. Full bodied, the mouth feel is well carbonated, but primarily conditioned to the grapefruit character. Full flavored, the taste is a fruity grapefruit hop with an understated sweet malt thing. An excellent drinker - the 8.7% ABV is REAL. I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS ONE FOR ""X"...come on!!! an India Black Ale (IBA)..WOW!!! Scoring points for imagination...is this 20/20 hindsight?"
"PS: Nice read on the back label about the 'growing pains' of opening the new Bistro..."
"The mouthfeel is medium with some high carbonation. This is very drinkable and interesting. It's not everyday you run into something this dark that tastes like something much lighter."
"Overall: GET THIS BEER!! Better yet grab a case if you can!"
"Overall impression: Very good combination of malt and hops - I like this one a lot. Reminds me a lot of the Avery New World Porter, which is another dark IPA. I'd love to see this one on a regular basis, but I won't be holding my breath."
"D: A very drinkable beer for how dark is it. A simply delicious, complex, and fascinating beer. Stone Brewing is awesome. They are constantly pushing the boundaries of craft brewing and turning out consistently unique and outstanding beers."
"D: I didn't know the abv at the time of drinking this beer, knowing stone tends to up the abv, i thought it was about 5-6 but i'm suprised to find it near 9! Unknowing, I could drink 3-4 and wonder why i felt strange. Over all a great beer from Stone again and it will please people who like their IPA and Bastard Ale. I felt like it was a mix of the two almost."
"a black sheep that is!"
"Poured a complete black with an impressive 2 finger brown head. While pouring, I initially smelt dark chocolate, but when I put the bottle down and took a whiff of this beautiful liquid in my glass, I was greeted with an extreme flowery hopnose that sent me towards heaven. Taste is solid chocolate with such an extreme hopbite it's out of this world. The hops literally assault and pillage your taste buds. Insane hopbite!!! This brew only gets better as it warms, woody/earthy tones mingle with citrus making this an extremely unbelievable brew. Mouth feel is good as well, drinkability is pretty solid as too. I wouldn't suggest slamming too many of these or you might not taste any thing else for a few days! Hats off to stone for this impressive anniversary brew."
"Not bad, but wow this is a bit tough right now."
"edit: towards the end there was a papaya like ""funkyness"" in the finish that might have been the roasted malts coming through. I didn't find it that appealing and the bomber was hard to finish...."
"Update: I just drank this reissued as Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale. My initial review stands except my comment about the bottle literature. They redeemed themselves with the reissue!"
"Very dark brown, clear, with ruby/mahogany highlights. Fine, tan bubbles clung in sheets to the sides of the glass and formed a tight cap. Good head retention with spotty lacing throughout. Intense pine resin and grapefruit rind aroma up front, fruity citrus and a hint of sweet cocoa fill in the background. Very floral and fragrant. Solid bitterness, not overpowering, that tends to linger. Sweetness is just enough to provide some balance and has more of a chocolate/cocoa character than stright-up caramel, but the hops are still front and center - mostly grapefruit flesh fruitiness and a bit of pine. Light alcohol flavour in the finish, along with mild warmth. Medium bodied, a bit chewy with creamy carbonation. Very nice texture. This is great stuff, worthy of an anniversary celebration. The darker malts, even though they're fairly subtle, really pull things together and create a nice counterpoint for the hops."
"Drinkability: POUR ME ANOTHER!"
"The 10th anniversary gave you a warm streak down the middle of your body, this one's warms it all over."
"It looks like a porter; mostly black with a tan head. Smells like an imperial IPA, but with a faint roasted note hinting at Imperial Stout. Hops up front - Stone style. If I closed my eyes, the first few sips might taste like that of a fresh Ruination, but as the beer warms up in my mouth, the astringincy of roasted malts kick in, and I would have to open my eyes at this point. Now there is not a pronounced stout character as that would add too much malt to compete with the hops, so they have wisely chosen what kind and how much dark malts to use in order to achieve this. This will no doubt spark a new age of imperial Stout/ IPA hybrids (just three days before this was on the shelves in my area, I had tasted a bartender's blend of Old Rasputin and Two-Hearted Ale) and we will see who comes out with a more roasted version that still brings the hop aroma and flavor before it just becomes an Imperial Stout with too much hops. In the meanwhile it seems that Stone stands alone on a pedestal of glory here."
"Looks like a dubbel, but taste and aroma are all IPA. A great brew. Highly recommended."
"This year's VE scared the hell out of me. This beyond reaffirms my tremendous faith in this finest of breweries."
"Deep black in color with a nice creamy nut colored head. Excellent retention with a lacing that coats the whole glass. Nice roasted barley malt aroma with an undercurrent of fresh hops. Taste starts with a solid malt front and quickly melds into hoppy citrus bitterness. Quite creamy and hoppy. For my taste the hop/malt balance is perfect. Warming sensation from the alcohol, but not to an extent where it impacts drinkability, which is very good. Resinous, full mouthfeel, but not too overbearing. Overall a solid brew. Cheers."
"Drinkability/Notes: Another great anniversary beer from the folks at Stone. I thought X was a really good IPA (glad I have another bottle), but this black IPA is so unique. The ability to combine a big, hoppy, Double IPA with dark, roasty malts is something else. Doesn't come across as a hoppy Porter as you might expect from its appearance, but its a true, honest to god, big time West Coast DIPA. Plenty of of citrusy hops (dare I say Amarillo or Simcoe?) with a subtle roastiness and plenty of malt sweetness to balance things out. Being 8.7% makes this a sipping beer for sure, but man is it drinkable. The dryness in the finish begs you to take another drink. Definitely seek out and enjoy, highly recommended. A hop heads delight for sure. Glad I grabbed a couple of bottles. Can't wait to cellar and try again next year."
"This is probably the best beer i have ever had. I love double simcoe and thought it was perfect on tap, but this is pure excellence. The smell is definitely fresh simcoe hops, and I have to stop to smell every time I go for a taste. The taste is perfect. There is a strong dark chocolate taste, and bitter like unsweetened chocolate chips, but goes very well with this. There is a lingering and pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste that seems like a perfect balance of dark chocolate and fresh hops. I can't get enough of the fresh hop taste. The chocolate taste really reminds me of FFF Alpha Klaus, but the overall flavor is definitely DIPA. After smelling this when I first poured it, I thought for sure there is no way it will taste as good as it smells. I was very wrong. I picked up two cases of this and have already called to set aside a third. Hopslam and Un-earthly will always have a special place in my fridge, but this stuff is hoppier, and just plain delicious. This brew has impressed the shit out of me. Excellent job with this one Stone."
"Overall, a Great beer. I like it. My only criticism (and I don't trust critics) would be to increase the malty body which will bring out the sweetness of this beer and also increase the aftertaste's staying power."
"Definitely an odd duck. Chocolate IPA perhaps? I'm a bit torn on this one though. I applaud Stone for their originality in this one, but I'm also a little disappointed. While it's not a earth shattering as the Stone 10th, it's still a damn fine beer. I'll be picking up a few more to drink, and a few more to cellar, just out of curiosity."
"Pours coffee black with a substantial tan head that recedes slowly while leaving a wash of sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma is brightly hoppy. Huge citrus character. Based on aroma alone, this most closely resembles the Summer Yulesmith. My first impression upon tasting is that this beer could possibly age quite well. There is plenty of malt lying just below the surface of all that hop presence. Like a furious undertow waiting to drag you out to sea as if to prove it's just as powerful as a towering wave. As it is, there is just a ton of flavors vying for my taste buds' attention. Tough to pick them out singularly, but there is definite chocolate, roasted coffee and fig presence to go along with those great hop characteristics that we all know so well. Together, these flavors combine to produce a pretty strong bitterness. Despite the intense battle going on between so many different strong flavors, this brew finishes pretty clean. Mouthfeel is dialed in just right. It's slightly thick and a bit oily, and the carbonation is ratcheted down a notch or two. Very smooth on the tongue with just enough bite to satisfy. Fits the flavor profile nicely. Overall, I really like this beer and am impressed by Stone's apparent eagerness to step outside the box and put out something so unique. Not sure I like this one quite as much as last years anniversary ale, but I'm excited about seeing what will happen to this one over time. I plan to put at least 6 of these away and won't check on it for another 6-8 months. I see great potential and think it might be even better once some of these background players step to the front of the stage."
"Drinks pretty good considering the complexity & abv, Reminds me of a Black IPA Bristols produced, just not the same hop profile as I try to recall...Worth the hype, the wait"
"wow! black in the middle and ruby on the edge with a great big tan head that sticks around for a bit and leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. smells of piney hops with a hint of malt and some coffee/toffee/chocolate in the background. hops overpower, but there's definitely something else. tastes the same. the piney hops are way way up front, but there's a nice backbone that includes sweet malt and some other stuff like coffee and chocolate. medium to full body with a slight bitter/alcohol kick. super fun to drink, but potent. a stoutdoubleipa. congratulations stone. hope to enjoy 11 more years with you."
"This is a very unusual beer -- somewhere between Stone's Pale Ale, Arrogant Bastard Ale, and Smoked Porter. It certainly has elements common to all of those beers. It's a real beast of a beer, so best not for the light-hearted. But if you want to try something really unique and bold, this is definitely one to try."
"This is the Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde of beers. I don't know how they do it. It is 100% a DIPA, but has the color of a stout without any of the taste. It's as if it's a DIPA with food coloring or something. Weird. As for the beer. It's a hop monster, and really needs some aging to take the bite off. Very reminiscent of SN Bigfoot mixed with Three Floyd's. I like it alot, and will pick up a couple more to keep for a few years. Maybe 2010 I'll crack it open again."
"This was like Rogue Brutal Bitter and Weyerbacher Double Simcoe mixed together!! 1 of the best beers I've had to date!"
"Awesome black IPA -- the tiny bit of light that makes it through the glass emerges as a ruby red gleam. Great hop flavors, reminding you that this is a Stone offering, but made complex with rye and malt sweetness. Sort of a combination black lager and Aventinus double-bock, taken to the West Coast and smacked around with a bunch of hops. More interesting than Arrogant Bastard. Delicious. Seek this one out."
"Drinkability - This beer is so damn enjoyable, that alone makes me wanna drink more than only one bomber. The abv% obviously hinders how much one can drink of this gem of a beer, but boy, is it tempting."
"Massive pine, huge hops, no bitters...how did they do that? An unbelievably great beer. Try and get some."
"this is quite possibly one of the best fresh and well balanced brews from stone i've ever had. such a better blend than last years 10th anniversery(which was also a great brew too, don't get me wrong). i'll be getting as much fresh bottles of this as possible."
"Overall, an interesting beer - a dark and roasty IPA. Kind of like a darker and roastier Arrogant Bastard."
"Overall probably my least favorite Stone brew yet, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it, it's just that I was expecting better things after last years masterpiece. Oh well."
"Aside from a nice look and a very nice aroma, I unfortunately was not a fan of this brew. It's the first Stone beer that I can recall not liking. I just felt the flavours didn't mesh well at all. The numbers will show this one as a positive recommendation, but I can't say that I can recommend this one. It's interesting for sure and has a good amount of flavour, but there's just something about this one that I didn't like. A disappointment for sure."
"Alcohol? Its in here? Can't find it. A surprisingly smooth hybrid style. Grab some while you can."
"This will probably age better than the 10th and is super to drink on a chill late summer night."
"Grabbed this brew in Porter Square, which to me delight has the familiar gargoyle from Stone's 10th Anniversary ale. I poured this beer in to a sniffer glass without really reading the description on the back...in fact I didn't really know anything about this beer, but with Stone I feel like you can bet safely that you are getting quality product when you take a chance on one of their brews. The pour was charcoal black, with no light getting through and a white head. ""Stout? fuck no, this is way too hoppy for that"" I thought, then decided to check out the label. A black ipa certainly sounds like something interesting to me. Aroma had piney hops, grapefruit, earth, and some rough spices. Beer is chocked full of hops in the flavor, with a nice malt touch in there as well. I also detect a slight hint of rye bread and garlic. Mouthfeel is bordering between medium and heavy for me, although that could be in part because of the fact that the dark coloration of this one makes you think that it is a heavy brew. Easy on the drinkability as well, although I would definitely say that this is one to sip and savor. Kickass offering from Stone right here. They should make this a year round kind of brew. Cheers"
"Dangerously drinkable. Stone can ride the IPA horse as long and as far as they want to in my opinion."
"D- A very unique beer and well worth a try. I was not expecting something like this."
"Pours a dark deep brownish black, with a creamy tan-brown head leaving lacing through the finish. Aroma is a strong hoppy presence, with some strong roasted malty deliciousness in the background. Mainly strong piney/citrusy resin hop flavors. Taste is virtual insanity (thanks for that one, Jamiraquoi). I can't describe the complexity in this beer. Strong citrus hops dominate the palate with grapefruit and orange. Earthy bold coffee flavors from the dark roasted malts with a definite alcohol flavor drying out the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is not-too-thick, but it does have a nice viscocity. Oily and smooth. Very easy drinking for over 8%, but be careful. I have only had 1 of these so far tonight, and it is getting very difficult for me to type this review..."
"D- Getting close to 9% abv means you have to watch yourself with this beer, the aroma carries more alcohol presence than the actual flavors, but this specialty release deserves to be enjoyed slowly (not in mass quantities), I am glad I have a case of this gem, if I can be so bold, I am imagining the 11th as a combination of Oaked Arrogant with 10th Anniversary punched up by a heavy dose of dark, sweet malts... Anyone with me on this one?!?!?"
"Poured out of 22oz bottle from Holiday wine cellar into a 7th annivesary port english pint glass. Poured nice coffee color with brown hue edges where any light can come through. but with less viscoity than a irs or porter. Head thick and tan that had good retention. Aroma of roasted citrus with a touch of yeast on the backend.Taste of ipa is there with pine and citrus but is backed up with a roasted coffee flavor with hint of moca similar to a porter or dry stout but a little more alcohol heat at the end. Mouth feel sides a litttle more with an ipa style. The combination is quiet amazing but at times confusing on the tongue but like anything new it makes you want to try more."
"Rating this overall is kind of hard. It's my first black double IPA, so I would say they did a pretty good job of hitting the goal they were going for. On the other hand, I just didn't find it to be my cup of tea. The dark malt and what I perceived to be a very one-dimensional hop aspect (all pine) wasn't that exciting. Of course, nowhere near bad, still a very good drink and a pretty good price for this bomber of $4.49."
"Not what I expected. A very good beer, but it basically tastes like a real good IPA with some malt backbone, and a shot or two of porter thrown in. Extremely drinkable considering how many flavors they're throwing at you here."
"Eric"
"I found this to be a very good beer. Another great offering from Stone. Tastes like an IPA and a porter. Alcohol content is not overwhelming and there is a nice smoothness to mix with the bitter hops."
"Dramatic changes occur when it hits the tongue. I like this, but give me a moment to figure this one out. Malt & molasses diligently try to fend off grapefuit rind & bitter hop with billy clubs. It's kind of messy, and maybe not as spot on focused as I would expect, but far from ingenious. I want to say this is a blended offering (10th & ?). This has presence, and it will hold your attention, as most Stone products do. I highly recommend you run out to try one for yourself, because the only way you'll be disappointed with this product is if it never touches your lips."
"Bomber. Ive been looking forward to this beer since last years 10th. Stone wins again. This is very similar to what I tasted a while ago at the brewery, they called it Smokin Indian, maybe 80% IPA and 20% Porter. I make that mix often now and its great. This 11th is very similar to that. Its cool because for such a dark beer, it tastes like a clean strong IPA. Its like a mix of Ruination and Porter. I like it. I bought a case and might go buy another one!"
"Overall: Even though it is a little off balanced, I like this beer. I see myself drinking many pints."
"Edit, 6-8-10: having recently had the Sublimely Self Righteous Ale, I'm bumping up the taste and mouthfeel to 4.5. This is a damn good beer, and a friend tells me that aged 11th Anniversary ends up stout-like and very good."
"I like it, though. 22oz bomber didn't stand a chance."
"""A new creation from Stone", happy happy...this one goes into a short wine glass, and pours near black, or at least very dark, under a long lasting dark tan head, tiny bubbles and creamy, each sips reveals gobs of sheeting and then rings of striated lacing, nice looking stuff. Distinctive, herbal, citric hoppy nose, yum. Fresh and pungent brew, plenty o'hoppy goodness, crunching along up front. Full bodied and full mouthfeel, hops continue to carry the weight. Also Some dark maltyness picked up, cafe au lait and mild chocolate, meandering around in the background. Complex, tasty and full throttle, yet more fine brew from the folks at Stone. Washed down a slice of olive bread in fine fashion...go get some and consume."
"This is one of the best beers I've tasted from Stone and certainly my favorite anniversary ale since 8th. This beer is bright and should be consumed fresh. Drink it now and savor the memories."
"This should age well."
"Drinkabilit is pretty good. I could definitely polish off a bomber, but that is about it. I don't want to go hoard this one up like I did the 10, but it is a tasty brew. Conflict is good!"
"Another interesting and complex winner from Stone. The back of the bottle hints that this is an IPA, but filing it under that category would greatly diminish its complexity. This one should age nicely, so it will be interesting to revisit in a year or two."
"This stuff is that good!"
"D: I wish they would make this a standard release. This is damn good and I can see myself drinking many, many more of these while I can get my hands on it. Once it's gone, I'm gonna miss this one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. ABV is relatively high, but it's perfect for this beer. Extremely drinkable. I really think I could drink this all night. Overall, fantastic offering from Stone. Pick it up now."
"This is a great brew, another notch on the belt for Stone. Really enjoyable."
"Note - you can't really call this an IPA as it's about as non-pale as they come. I'm going to go with India Black Ale (IBA) for this one."
"Great to see the new Stone Ann. ale here in western NY so quickly.My second time trying this new black IPA style of beer my first being Rogue Black Brutal wich I had mixed feelings about,this poured a deep dark brown but not black some ruby colored highlights thruought a thick 2 finger head atop that never completely settled just a fantastic creamy mass left with gobs of lace behind in my impy pint glass,just awesome.Mix of piney and tropical fruit hops and black malt in the nose mainly I picked up some pineapple and molasses wich was nice and it strayed away from the one dimensional resiny hop profile and caramel malt base.The hops are big but so is the black malt element of this beer sure its big and piney and citrusy but the dark bread and molasses in there is large as well in finely balanced that black malt character really shows itself.The alcohol creeps a bit but this is a very interesting brew it has it all big hops and some malty sweetness,another top notch brew form one of the best."
"Overall this is a very tasty beer fresh but I look forward to experiencing it over time as it is a bit hot right now. I will give it another shot later on this week to see what I think on the second go round. Cheers!"
"Midnight-doused dark chocolate with cherrywood highlights. Fat dusky-sand foam sticks in thick clumps to the glass. Herbal and woody aromas with sugared grapefruit pulp. Faint earthiness with alcohol vapors. Initially floral and soft, but the quiet storm quickly builds to a thrashing tide of mellowed cedar and grapefruit juice concentrate. Slightly caramelized sugar notes increase as it warms. Medium body. Sharp and lively from pugilistic c-hop and alcohol assault. Lingering citric and pine bitterness in a finish that goes for miles. Underneath the relentless lupulin blast, some slightly vinous dark fruit whispers struggle to be heard. But not here, not now. A welcome expansion of the balls-out IPA palette."
"I already knew this was going to be a dark IPA but it sure is black. Smell is initially fruity out of the bottle and reminiscent of the vaunted 10th. Second smell from the glass is chocolate and hops! This one is weird, has a chocolate taste, some hops with fruitiness and roastiness at the end. Good stuff and makes me want to revisit Averys 14th anniversary ale. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy but I am not sure that I could drink more than one bomber. For some reason the chocolate and hop combination makes me think of chocolate mints."
"Fantastically designed beer. Very, very nice. I'll miss this when it is gone."
"In a word, exceptional."
"It's hard not to like a beer with such intense flavor and aroma. Being somewhat syrupy I thought it might be a sipper but it went down pretty easy once I got used to that. This is definitely another extreme brew and just what I would expect from Stone. I would argue it's better than the 10th Anniversary so stock on up, but also drink soon because these hops will only fade and it won't be the same..."
"This is most definitely an IPA inspired beer; the lingering, tongue flagellating bitterness in this beer is huge. Astringent at times, bracing, palate dominating, but thoroughly enjoyable for the hop heads out there. I really hope this beer lasts longer than the 10th anniversary beer; for some reason that one had a 2 week window where it was a zesty hop bomb, but after that it became a train wreck of flavors (though I'll have to revisit it as some have said it has mellowed recently). Anyway, if you only have one bottle drink it now, cause it is at it's peak fresh hoppiness right now. It will be interesting to see how the dark malt character plays out; it is very subtle right now and if this was put in a blind IPA tasting (you would actually have to be blind folded though), most would have a hard time guessing this was not a typical, albeit supper hoppy IPA."
