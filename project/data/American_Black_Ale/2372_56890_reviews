"O:  A really nice beer.  This style is right up my alley and Terrapin does a good job executing it."
""

""
"What can I say not bad but I just like black ipas"
""
"Love almost all of Terrapin's brews, but this one just doesn't do much for me."
"O- Not bad, but not what I'd call an IPA. A hoppy dry stout/porter, perhaps."
""
""
""
""
"D - Nice roasty Black IPA, more of a porter."
""
""
""
"Quite carbonated. Smokey and a tad acidic. A grassy undertone. Good wintertime brew."

"Flavor: more balanced.  Unlike many black IPA;s, IMO, this one successfully integrates the substantial hop load with a substantial amount of medium and dark malts.  Its success is due in large part, I suspect, to not going overboard with the ingredients.  Terrapin also has done a fine job of matching the malts to the hops."

"A not particularly good beer IMHO. This is supposedly only available in the box set so it appears that the seller broke the set down to sell the individual bottles. Usually the offerings from Terrapin range from good to very good – I have to assume that this sample was mishandled somewhere along the line. If I can find another, I’ll update this review."
"Right off the bat, have heard some pretty good things about Terrapin (and who wouldn't love the Grateful Dead reference?)... anyways, poured from a 12oz bottle into my Breaker Brewing Co. snifter. Beautiful jet black body with a inger or so of off white head. Not a big nose on this one, but some bitter chocolate, and dark malt, and a hint of licorice were there. Not a big hop nose at all, and it would seem as though this was v. fresh (11/14/14 enjoy by date). Nice flavors of coffee up front, with a nice bitter middle note, as well as a nit of a floral hoppy taste as it warmed up. For a Black IPA, maybe just a bit lagging on the flavor complexity... wanted a bit more hop flavor to balance the nice maltiness and appropriate amount of bittering. Great mouthfeel, reminiscent of a nice porter or BIPA. Overall, a decent beer, but I would likely chase down a Self-Righteous or NightTime if the options were available. Decent grade for the style."

"Overall it was worth picking up and I am glad these are being released cheaper as 12 oz offerings. In a way though it was like that peanut butter porter they made OK but it wasn't super tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I've got to admit that the Black IPA is not my favorite style but I still try them out on occasion hoping to find one that I'll love--and now I have."

"Overall: One of the better integrated Black IPAs I've encountered.  Not as delicious as Midnight Monk, but tasty. (4.19)"

"I need another Ryan..."
"D - Oh my, I could drink this all night. I am very glad I grabbed 2 bottles. Terrapin needs to release this one again some day."
"drinkable - sure, a bomber's worth."
"O: Not a bad beer but not really as advertised. The group consensus was that it really tasted/seemed MUCH closer to a porter than a Black IPA. The malty and chocolaty notes really dominate and again, not a bad beer just not coming off as a Black IPA IMO."
"22oz bomber shared with mrmanning, StephenRich, Chris, and Erin. Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black, with a thin cap of beige froth and strings of lacing on the tulip. Complex nose is chocolate, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, perfume, floral hops, baking sugar, and coffee grounds. Quite appealing. Taste is roasted malt, burnt toast, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, grassy and leafy hops with a lingering, citric bitterness. High IBUs are evident on the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy-foamy upfront, fuller than medium bodied, bitter hop bite precedes a drying finish with some roast, cocoa, and flaked oats on the cough. A satisfying Black IPA, balanced compared to others that I've tried but no less enjoyable."
"D Definitely a repeat beer."
"D: I almost wonder if I got a different beer than everyone else, as I found this beer to be one of the most restrained black IPAs I've had with only a light flavor of roasted malts and a still able to retain a lot of the typical IPA character."
"D - Pretty nice, I'm not having any issues with the bomber. Again, a good beer, but it seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis."
"Overall this is a decent intepretation of a Black IPA, but if I tasted it blindly I would have called it a overly coffeed Baltic Porter. Needed more balanced somewhere, the Black IPA is not a beer which should be ""imperialized"" in my opinion."
"Reviewed on 5/23/2010. Bottle thanks to Tsotsi. Pours a dark brown with a small but thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, citrus hops, perhaps a hint of roasted malt. Flavor of roasted malt, smoked malt, some charred notes, and a bitter hops finish. A pretty solid black IPA from Terrapin."
"D-Big and bold with a ton of roast....too much actually. This is the downfall of this brew for me. I got through my pint but had no desire for a repeat. Has promise but this brew needs some work if it is to made again."
"Interesting brew - there's hints of a heavily-hopped stout here. If that's your thing, this would be a good one for you."
"M: The feel is fairly thick, with light carbonation and fairly dry for the weight."
"Split a bottle with my boy Kolby whilst chilling at the Library in da Burgh. Did I mention the Library has a rockin' happy hour twice a day. This big bottle poured with a pitch black dark cola vibe, forming a big tan head fill the glass with lacing spread fine and evenly between sips. Aromatics offer up dark roasts with a creamy malt accent, herbal green undertones a touch of pine and citrus as well. Flavor has herbal tea tannins buring dark ale with hopped up bitterness in the backend. Strong alcohol finish for the 7.5% alcohol, I was a bit confused with this aspect. Assertively hoppy a bit hop but nice dark roasted malts work oaky with the combination of the two. Mouthfeel was medium bodied healthy dose of carbonation carried things across the palate a touch cloying at times but this beer had no time getting down our gullets. Solid drinkability, I was hoping to find this on tap, but never did catch it flowing in the Burgh."
"D - Enjoyable, but not particularly complex. The malt is kind of one dimensional with some notes of caramel and moderate roasted notes. The malt is subdued enough to the hops shine through, but it does impart a bit of dark flavor that brings out the pine and creates notes of blue cheese and mustard. This is a nice example of the style with a particularly pleasant hop character."
"Thought this was coming out in July/August based on reports from Feb/March, then it never made it here, then thought September or maybe October, then finally showed up along with a more recent Side Project. Terrapin has really botched their distribution to FL (thus I can't give 2 shits if this is maybe is possibly 2 months old), but this one held up pretty well."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not great, just decent. Seems more like a porter or milk stout to me. Try if you like roasty beers."
"Received as an extra in a recent trade. Poured a medium black color, with a creamy beige head. On the nose, this one had a nice roasty smell, roasted malt, light cocoa and finally floral hops. On the palate, medium bodied, well carbonated, very roasty up front, even more so as it warms, before the hops show themselves."
"Mouthfeel is ok. I would have preferred a little bit more carbo but the flavors of this brew make up for it. An excellent example of this style."
"Pours near black with a bit of head. Nose is some citrus hops and a good deal of roast. Taste is slightly bitter and dry with roast. Hints of coffee. Nice citrus and a bit of pine. Medium body. Pretty good. It'd take on the good captain again."
"Easy drinker. The eyes play drinks on the buds and the brain. This one is pitch black but drinks and tastes like IPA. Interesting and delicious. A little disappointed in the lack of noticeable roastiness, but I liked it anyway."
"Beer is a porter, not an IPA, there is almost no bitterness or hop character in the mouth. Beer is medium bodied and has some mild sweetness in the front and then the roast in the back. Not much in between though. I was really hoping this was hoppy. Its not."
"Thanks again Geoff... this was a Super Trade!! Looking forward toward December!!"
"D: I could down a couple of these a night if I had the money."
"Drank it fairly well."
"D: Nothing really special about this one, but the beer itself is not too pretentious. Also, I REALLY love the bottle art!"
"Pours deep copper to a black color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast, and a small hop. In the taste, mellow grapefruit like hops and a sweet, roasty malt. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry grapefruity hop in the aftertaste. Mellow nose but big flavor, I can dig it."
"D: This was a very nice black IPA that brought great balance of super clean hops with dark roasty malts. The roasted character was a bit harsh, but the alcohol was well hidden. It had nice body too, so it was overall easy to drink and enjoy. Another solid Terrapin beer."
"Thanks Grant!"
"Final thoughts - This beer is more of a mild hopped porter. Good, but does not live up to the hype and a little expensive."
"D: Tried this in the summer and it was a bit hot for this beer. Good, but not great in 110 degrees."
"All in all, I really enjoyed this brew. It's just damn tastey and goes down easily. Does it blow me away? Not necessarily. But it's just quite delicious and rolls across the tongue wonderfully."
"Sampled this at Savor 2010. Poured black, slight mahogany when held up to light, with a thin off-white head, less-than-stellar retention, and average lacing. Smelled heavily of roasted malt, as well as some cocoa powder, sweet orange, and modest lemon/orange zest. The taste revealed lots of orange/apricot citrus, evolving to balance out with some caramel/chocolate/roasty malt, and then finishing on a sweet orange note, with only a modest note of dry peel. Not much carbonation, and medium-bodied. A little too sweet for my taste; it would benefit greatly from some more bitter/dry balance like some other black ipa's I have tried."
"Totally serviceable Black IPA here, with strong hop flavors that melded well with the darker aspects of the malts. Just enough smooth crispness to keep the drinkibility up as well. Another solid entry in the Side Project series."
"Black mole of grilled potatoes, nopales, and field peas"
"One note: I've come to believe that for the most part, Black IPAs, or hoppy porters, or Cascadian Dark Ales (ironic given the first one were brewed in freakin' Vermont), or whatever these things are called now, age pretty damn well. The generally robust, complex malt body make for a beer that, like many higher abv porters, will age quite gracefully. An interesting note given the lack of proper aging potential for most actual IPAs."
"Nice beer. Black cherry and currant with a very bitter finish. Hops are dry and grassy in the finish and citrusy in the middle. Hints of roasted malt and chocolate. Could be a bit creamier but fine nonetheless."
"As much as it pains me to try this outside of its optimal (and insanely rare) growler form, I will trudge forward. For the children. It pours a pretty much opaque black-brown topped by a couple o' fingers o' healthy tan foam. The nose comprises a nice bushel o' fruity hop aromas, with ruby red grapefruit leading the way, and some smooth, semi-toasted caramel coming through as well. The taste begins heavily in favor of the grapefruity hops; as the hops fade into the background, the caramel steps in, along with a touch of light coffee. The finish has all of these elements take a bow as the music slowly dies away and the lights gradually come down. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and rather creamy feel. I'm glad I was able to enjoy the Krunkles experience, especially after the hype. Consider it lived-up-to."
"D - Drinkability is good. All the flavors come together to make an interesting and quaffable brew. The abv seems a tad lighter than what's listed but that only helps this category. Would I have a problem putting away a bomber? No. Would I have another? Yes, but not in the same session. Glad I got to try another of the (usually) solid Side Projects from Terrapin. Much appreciated Josh."
"Capt'n Krunkles is a pretty good Black IPA or whatever you want to call it. It has a good flavor and doesn't make any huge missteps on the journey. The nose would benefit from a little more strength, and perhaps the charred/burnt flavor could be toned down a little. Overall though, this is good stuff. Definitely worth checking out if the opportunity presents itself."
"Drinkability? My palate is getting a bit of bitterness overload and I haven't even finished the bottle yet. An ""interesting"" brew but I wouldn't want another."
"This *rare* bomber poured out black with a large brownish head, good retention and lacing all around, looks great. Fruity with citrus and pineapple mitigated by roasted malts. Appealing nose. Taste is smokey with assertive hop backbone that has a pervasive fruity-resinous streak that leads to a grapefruity midpalate with high bitterness and a highly roasted, coffeelike and cookielike finish. This one is pretty heavy on the roast, while the hops are here in full force, they seem one-note in comparison to the vastness of the malt. Medium bodied with high carbonation, which works for the IPA factor, but not so much with the huge roast notes. Interesting beer for sure, I would have it again, but the balance isn't quite ideal for me."
"I would have preferred a more assertive hop presence here, perhaps like Stone's Sublime. Still, it's a nice sipper and very drinkable."
"D: 4.0 I'm not into too many dark beers, but this one is well-balanced and worth a try!"
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice little hop note, very slight chocolate, and some dark fruits, slight citrus note. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy, nice little touch of chocolate and dark fruits, slight citrus note. Medium body. Drinkable, really liking this one."
"Drinkability might be simple take a porter and hop it to high heavens but eh like roasted like hops not much to complain about on my part."
"HV"
"d - An ok IPA. I thought the hops in the taste were a bit faded and this had just hit the shelves. Would try again."
"I can't see myself drinking this one again, at all. I'm not sure why others would want to either, but that's why our palates are different. I'll leave this for someone else."
"I think this is a pretty good take on an emerging style. A ramped up hop bill might not be a bad idea, but it's decent as is. On the whole, Cap'n Krunkles is pretty solid. May he sail long & pillage along the way. Hopefully time finds him with refined sailing skills & a more bountiful stash of loot."
"MF/D: Pretty big body with a mildly aggressive carbonation. Overall it feels good on the palate. Pretty easy to put this bomber down (although I split it)."
"Drinkability was average. I'd love to see this reworked, because Terrapin has it in them to make an awesome Black IPA. This, however, is not it. I'd rather drive this crummy rental car for the rest of the year than drink another bottle of this."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter it appears a dark brown to nearly black color with a creamy tan head about a finger strong with pretty good retension. Spotty amount of lace clings to the glass. Aroma is citrus hops upfront with a nice dark malt character with both chocolate and coffee in the back. Taste is citrus hop bitterness upfront with more bitterness contributed by the dark roasted malts. Little bit of yeast character is included in the flavor. Lasting taste of hops and dark grains left in the mouth with an increasing amount of alcohol as the beer warms. Light feel with a mild level of carbonation."
"10 bucks a pop wow Terrapin is pricing themselves out of my pocket book."
"Overall a decently drinkable beer. Much better than my last BIPA."
"Shame they wasted such a great name on such a bad beer. Pours black but is an IPA, odd but we will go with it. Smell of off-roasted dark malts and some old hops (not enough hops); taste is similar, but the hops just don't mesh with the darker malts and add mostly bitterness. Pine element is more like floor cleaner than grapefruit"
"D: Drinkable beverage if you enjoy the beer with a body of a stout and the flavor of an IPA. This is the Sphinx of beer, but since the ABV is only 7.5% drink away."
"An interesting combination of flavors in this one. Would like to have it again."
"The mouthfeel I'd say is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, it melded some pretty good flavors together. That said, I think I'd still like the flavors better separately in a good IPA and stout. Still a pretty tasty and interesting beer though."
"The beer pours black with an off-white head. The aroma is pretty heavy on the smoke with some roasted malt as well. The flavor is earthy hops, smoke and roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not as much hop presence as I expected from the term Black IPA, but this is still a good beer."
"Almost more like an American Imperial Stout than the relatively new ""American-style India Black Ale," with its heavy roasted character, but the combination is quite nice, being not too strong but full in all aspects of flavor and quite drinkable to boot. Perhaps Terrapin should consider replacing Hop Karma with the Capt'n."
"drinkability: Ive had better black IPAs but it was still good"
"Deep almost opaque black that show some ruby highlights when held to light. The beer sports a nice lasting light tan head. Aroma is cocoa and brown malt in the front with slight citrus hops in the back. The taste is a nice balance of brown malts and citrus hops with a nice lingering bitter finish. There is also a nice touch of chocolate present as well. The beer is medium bodied with its alcohol well hidden. This one is a very enjoyable beer, one I hope they make into at least a yearly release."
"5/18/2010"
"Nice beer. I think I am learning to enjoy BIPA's."
"D-this has a nice balance, the chocolate flavors with floral and citric hops make for a nice contrast. the acetone and lack of carb take away slightly."
"Have had a couple of shots at this wale and am not really too excited about it. Aside from the fact that I'm not a big fan of this style (the hops and the malt do nothing to compliment another), this is just a pretty uninspiring beer from a brewery that I have otherwise had good experience with."
"Pours a deep, warm sable with a very thick, fine-bubbled, fairly persistent beige head, more like a stout or porter than an IPA. Aroma, though, is quite hoppy like a typical good IPA, except that it has an undertone of molasses and hints of smoke. Flavor is fairly hoppy and yeasty with a nice smoky overtone and subtle hints of roast coffee and brown sugar - delightfully different! I am in love! Texture is smooth and quite tingly, albeit just a teensy on the thin side; it leaves a pleasantly smoky, hoppy and fizzy finish. Recommended!"
"(D)- Not bad. Has a decent hop profile & citrus with a subtle dark background. I would have it again if it was offered a glass."
"Shout out to SincereNC for sending this my way. Dark black color with a very unassuming aroma. In fact it was bland and boring. The taste was also not nearly hoppy enough for me. I got the slightest hint of a single hop flower and the dark malts just didn't wow me at all. Boring. I think the best ""black IPA"" I've had is still Stone's 11th Anniversary/Sublimely Self Righteous Ale."
"D - Hmm, not bad for a Black IPA. It's easily drinkable for it's style but doesn't reach for anything. I don't know why it's so RARE Todd (yes, I really am kidding, please people, if you haven't heard the joke don't BM me to explain that Capt'n Krunkles isn's rare). Either way, I wouldn't walk the plain for this beer. *Rimshot."
"A very nice beer and extremely unique (to me). The flavors compliment each other very nicely, much more than I ever thought. I would not be disappointed if this was a regular from Terrapin, though the price is fairly steep."
"Drinkability: This beer is a huge win for me. I love the battle of hoppiness and roastiness in this beer. Normally a big malt beer like this I would only grab one or two, however this one keeps calling me back...sad that this is a one off."
"D: I have had this a few times and found it uite enjoyable, but i like black IPAs. That being said i only would want one pint of this at a time"
"Its good. A bit different. Hop heads will enjoy. Would have liked it better of there was a bit more variety in the taste."
"The carbonation is a little light for my preferences, and the body is a little closer to medium than most IPAs reach. But still quite drinkable."
"D- Like a lighter porter, easy to take, the best of both worlds."
"My first of take on this style. I do like it but it just isn't something I will just have to have. Would like to revisit it somewhere down the road though."
"D- This is a BIG and pretty good black IPA. This is much more malt forward than others that I have had. The roasted malt and hop flavors are almost combating in this one and the impression of black coffee spiked with grapefruit is interesting-but not necessarily my cup of tea. Decent overall but not my favorite of the style."
"Mouthfeel starts off nice with a creamy head mixed with a little bite from the carbonation. Continues to be smooth but maybe a little thin. Finishes with a nice dry bitterness. This beer is actually very refreshing and the mouthfeel makes for good drinkability."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Spaten Mug. This brew poured a dark brown (almost competely black) with a one finger tan head. The aroma of this brew was piney. The taste of this was a very smooth earthy flavor that intensified upon swallowing. The hops were very subtle and almost missed. It maintained evident lacing throughout. Overall this was a very nice brew that is easy to drink while still maintaining an earthy flavor. With that said, I would have enjoyed it much more if there was some balance to the earthy flavor. This was still quite good for a Black IPA."
"Not a bad beer at all, I wish the hops were more prevalent in the taste as they were in the nose, but still a pretty decent beer..."
"Drinkability: I had high hopes for this one but the beer just lacks balance and the counterpoint of the malt and hops is jarring"
"Overall impression: Decent take on the CDA style. Could use a few tweaks to lose some of the sweetness/tanginess."
"D- Overall, this is probably my favorite Side Project beer to date. I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to try the next new release from Terrapin!"
"Medium bodied and a good amount of carbonation. No problem putting this down. A very different change of pace brew."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Nothing world class, but I'd certainly drink it again."
"D - An interesting beer. I really enjoyed it and could easily go for more. I'm enjoying the emergence of this new style."
"Thin watery mouthfeel here and an unbalanced taste make this one 2nd tier to me. Pretty disappointing... I usually dig the Terrapin stuff and especially their Side Projects."
"M/D - On the lighter side and a little thin in the mouth. The combo of roasted dark malt and big hops just doesnt meld well in this one. Black IPA's have been a little hit or miss in my book and this one is a definite miss."
"d - Pretty good. Easy to drink though a little too much malt for me to stick with it all night. Worth picking up if you see it and I will definitely try it again, as it is a very interesting beer. Unfortunately this is the first black IPA I've had so it is impossible to say if it represents the style well."
"I would definitely buy this again and probably will next time I see it. I feel like I could drink several of these, the drinkability is much higher than I expected for the style. Very interesting and worthwhile beer for its uniqueness."
"D- I had no problem drinking this one. I don't think I could go with it all night, but I really enjoyed this."
"Really quite a good beer even though it doesn't quite fit style guidelines"
"Notes: This is definitely an interesting beer and worthy of a try. It is a pretty good combination of an IPA and a black malty ale. The balance could be a little better, but the perfection hinted at in the aroma holds some promise."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It has a jet black pour with an abundant white head. The head is very sticky and long lasting. The aroma is piney and has a delicate sweetness to it. The taste follows with sweet pine that leaves a dry, lingering finish. The beer is medium/light in body and highly carbonated. A very interesting that I would buy again."
"Overall very solid, a nice and almost sessionable black IPA. No issues in puttin down the bottle and on of the more intresting offerings from Terrapin."
"D: I didn't know what to expect with this, since it was the first black IPA I have tried. Bottom line, not sure if I would pick this up again. I'm sure this will go over well with a lot of people, but it just wasn't fit for my palate."
"D - As previously stated the mouthfeel really makes this one easier to drink. The complexity of the flavors may take away a little bit of the drinkability but the flavor is great so it doesn't take away much. I would definitely recommend anyone that has an opportunity to try this to go for it. I will probably pick up another bottle of this at the store."
"D-Nice black ipa. moderatly dry and hoppy. It might be the dark malts (carafa?) but the hop flavor/aroma seems to be hidden behind the toast/mocha. Would be perfect if they turned up the hop flavor/aroma."
"D: For my first black IPA, I am happy. I was expecting some more roast and malt presence, but then again I was expecting more hop presence as well. The bitterness does build throughout the sip, I just wish it was a little more assertive. With that said, this beer does lean toward balance and that makes it very drinkable. It looks like a heavy porter or stout, but drinks so well. Enjoyed it and glad I got a hold of a few bottles."
"pint at Tyler's, Carrboro"
"M - Medium bodied."
"D-If you can get past the bitterness, this is a nice beer; I just think it came out a bit unbalanced, so one is enough for me."
"Drinkability: Hoppy and dark, just like Lebron James! These brews are curious blending of styles that I'm still acclimating myself to. This one was pleasant enough."
"D: Of course this one deviates from the parameters of the style, but it is still drinkable."
"Huge 3-4 finger head if you are unwise enough to pour down the center, insult to injury takes some time to get down below two fingers of deep tan, heavily whipped foam, craters as much as dimples, serious lacing left behind. Starless and bible black liquid, not a hint of color and full opacity. Given its appearance, the hops leap out of the glass with pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, pine and pressed flowers, offers biscuit, cocoa, rye bread, the malts play a steady supporting role, balanced on the whole if favoring the hops. Full-bodied with more bottom than lift, the increased presence of the malts via mocha, cocoa and lighter coffee, then comes the biscuit, scone notes and darker pumpernickel breadiness. The carbonation gives its all but doesn't end up effecting much. Pink grapefruit, mandarin orange, lemon citrus in abundance. Pine and green herbs, anise seed, as before alternates frequently enough to strike some sort of balance. Absolutely intrigues and holds your interest, that said, a couple of glasses might be all you'd want."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours an opaque brown color with a good sized, frothy light brown head, lacing throughout. Aroma is roasted malts, dark chocolate, nutty, a nice amount of pine and citrus hops. Flavor is roasted malts, wood, citrus, pine, and a hint of bitter coffee. Mouthfeel is moderate, creamy, dry and bitter. Well balanced, nice and complex, I like this style and I like this beer."
"A clean, crisp, and nicely done beer overall. A winner from Terrapin."
"Glad I tried it. Interesting mix."
"This is the fifth Side Project I have tried,I have for the most part enjoyed them.Poured into an imperial pint glass a deep cola color with a nice two finger off white head that held well.A mix of dark bread spiciness and resiny hop in the nose,a light caramel note is in there to.A mix of dark bread and citri-piney flavors on the palate,each hold their own,a caramel sweetness shows through nicely in the finish.Not mind blowing but it has good balance and subtle comlexity."
"D: An easy drinking BIPA, to be sure. Not too overbearing or overpowering. However, there are better options at lower prices. I paid ~$8 for this bomber, and I would be alot happier with it in the ~$4.50 range. As it stands, I'll pick up Sublimely Self Righteous and save a buck or two. Sorry Terrapin... I Love Ya, but I gotta tell it like it is."
"Pours a dark brown color, with a nice cola colored head that leaves awesome lacing. The aroma has some nice citrus, pine and herbal hop character initially, followed by some rye bread like maltiness, some caramelized sugar and a decent alcohol presence. The taste is similar to the aroma with big, american hops upfront (mainly citrus and pine with a little herbal quality), followed by some caramelized sugar, dark malts with a bit of a rye like bite, a little coffee and some alcohol on the tail end. The mouthfeel is a bit on the oily side, and drinkabiliy is good. Overall a pretty solid black IPA, but not in the same league as Bashah or Sublimely Self Righteous Ale (which are the benchmarks of the style imo)."
"The pour looked pitch black at first glance, but holding the pint glass against a light indicated that it was actually a shade of deep red. The head was three finger thick and foamy, and dissipated into a craggy surface with lot of lace. The looks were similar to a stout, but the grapefruit and pine aroma was typical American IPA. There was hint of chocolate, but I had to inhale pretty deeply to detect it. The dark malts definitely were present in the taste in the form of a coffee like bitterness, which supplemented the already bitter grapefruit peel hop presence. There was little bit of toffee flavor, but this did not provide enough of a counter balance. The finish was spicy and slightly astringent. This felt edgy and lacked a lot of the smoothness in the mouthfeel. I prefer some sweetness to go with the IPA bitter flavors, and sadly this lacked it."
"I am not a big fan of the Hop Karma (India Brown), and I am in the minority apparently. But this is good stuff. Just the right added dimension to the hop-bomb formula. This has one of the biggest hop profiles of any Terrapin beer, yet it is quite drinkable and even pairs well with a spicy Mexican meal. Well done."
"Pours very dark brown with a decent head that fades to a thick swirl atop the brew. Smells of spicy hops and some sharp malt- almost like there is some rye in there. The taste also seems like it has some nutty, grainy, sharp rye notes as well as some black patent malt dryness and light roastiness along with bitter chocolate notes. Nice hop accents of pine and citrus peel. Firm, bitter, and full, but dry mouthfeel. I had a Brooklyn cocktail earlier in the evening made with a particularly earthy rye. This bears more than a passing resemblance to that. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I like the dry richness and bracing bitterness."
"The 10th installment in Terrapin's Side Project program pours a deep, opaque mahogany with a big and fluffy beige head with great retention and lacing. The aroma starts with some light fruity citrus, oranges and lemons maybe, and some resinous pine. There is a nice backbone of dark roasted malts to help balance out the hops, but the citrus is still fairly prominent. The taste follows the aroma pretty well , but there is a bit more balancing of the orange and grassy hops by the backbone that the aroma suggested. The dry roasted character of the malts balance the hop bitterness of the finish."
"Overall this was an above average beer not because of the flavors but because of the way they played off of each other. This may be the most well-balanced Black IPA I've had (though there aren't all that many). Worth a shot."
"6.99 @ Green's....no abc listed on label. Dark brown pour into a Duvel glass. Light sandy brown froth, quarter inch. Bright aroma of navel orange, roasted malt with subtle whiffs of nestle quik powder & black licorice. Very balanced up front, with zesty citrus meeting creamy roasty malt. Hops really kick in a few seconds later...minty orange zinger. Comes back to malty & citric bitter with a chalky mouthfeel. Dry bitter finish with pretty nice drinkability."
"The only other dark IPA I can compare this to is Yakima Twilight which has a bigger hop presence, but I also really like the chocolate in the Capt'n Krunkles."
"D:its a slightly higher than sessionable beer to me only because its quite bitter and my mouth cant take more than one bomber of that. its flavor has a lot going on considering you can taste the ""dark"" and the unusual hoppy together. I dont know what the percentage is but if it were a bit fuller body i would enjoy it more but still a tasty side project"
"I enjoyed this one a lot and I'm glad I got to try it super fresh as the hops are the dominant player now. Honestly, I'm intrigued to see what happens as the hops die down as I bet this turns into a completely different beer. Not sure if it'll be this good, but I look forward to finding out."
