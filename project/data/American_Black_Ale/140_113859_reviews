review_text
"I didn't really know what to expect from a ""Black IPA"". I've had a few different black beers before, and i've had many different IPA's. Never together, and now I know why. Best way I can describe this is burnt citrus. Unappetizing for me. Literally one of the only beers I've not been able to finish and found it's way down the drain. I'm glad it was just part of the 4-way IPA variety pack I bought and not a 6 pack of just this!"

"Sort of an IPA/Porter hybrid. Very mild hop and malt aroma. Dark red cola color. Hoppy, fruity and bitter. Malt is way overshadowed by the hops. Aftertaste fades quickly for the IBU level. Not bad but would probably only drink this when I am also eating something to contrast the hops."

"Overall I feel some of the reviews for this are not fit the style.  I think SN did a great job for the style.  Let it warm and see the difference.  I could even see the name changing to strictly Blindfold Black Ale.  Let the consumer decide what this is.  Complex and tasty nonetheless.  Good stuff."

"Pours like a lumberjack's coffee with champion grade lacing. Roasted malts and earthy aroma hops come through the nose and the palate strong. Heavy creamy mouthfeel, not bad"

"Overall, a good representative of the style. A little more bitter than I’m accustomed, but a tasty and complex black IPA."

"Poured a bit hard with a 1:1 beer:head ratio at around 45 degrees F. into a pint mug.  Head dissipates so slow leaving huge, beautiful chunks of lacing all the way around.  Dark brown with burgundy around the edges, sort of looks like a porter until the smell.  Smells of cascade hops, west coast style, Sierra Nevada standard like a dark Torpedo scent in a way.  Deep and dark molasses and hops hit the nose with a mixed dank mustiness.  Medium bodied with carbonation that makes it seem fuller than it really is.  Bitter.  Quite dank and tasty but not very sweet west coast hops, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses on dark bread toast with butter! Lingering aftertaste sort of like campfire blackened marshmallow.  As it warms, the charred chocolate campfire treats and signature cascade hop bitterness lingers ever more.  If only all beers could taste this good. Trick I think with this one is to let the aromatics out with a rough pour at just below 50 degrees F.  Kind of tones down the acidity while enhancing the natural flavor."

"Intriguing mix of stout and IPA.  Luckily it's the best of both worlds and not the worst.  The IPA is definataly the predominant style."

"Very deep chocolate/black color. Nice tan head and great lacing all over the glass. Aroma is relatively light with some malt and light citrus. Taste is hop forward with some malt sweetness and a nice roasted coffee bitterness that lingers for a while. Overall, feels good, tastes good and is pretty well balanced........."

"Translucent deep brown as it pours in to the New Belgium tulip. Impenetrably black once it collects in the glass. Remarkable 3 finger head of coffee colored foam that settles gradually in to a resilient layer, leaving impressive lacing all the way around. This could easily be mistaken for a robust imperial stout based on the appearance alone. Chocolate and coffee bean aromas mingle with a fresh, leafy hop bouquet. Toasted biscuit notes give the scent some depth. Smoky, roasted coffee bitterness bounces off of spicy, herbal hop notes creating an artful exposition of flavor. Hints of dark chocolate and minty pine come together in the finish to give the subtle impression of a peppermint patty. Medium bodied with creamy, active carbonation that really plays up the roasty bite. Perhaps a little slick for such a dark, foreboding brew, but executed well nonetheless. The pithy zing clings to your palate with a cumulative effect, reminding you that it's definitely an IPA. A little booziness on the breath also lets you know that it's a sturdy brew. The combined bitterness of the burnt malts and assertive hops yield an aspirin-like quality that's surely not for everyone. But, for me, this was pretty divine. Another win for Sierra Nevada and beer drinkers the country over. So glad they have expanded East!!!"

"A fine black IPA.  Seems to have good balance between the malt and hops.  Just not a huge fan of the double shot of bitterness that black IPA's provide."
"Exactly how it is billed, and exactly what you would expect.  Deep brown color.  Classic SN head, retention, and feel.  Nice roasty flavor that finishes with a flourish of hops.  Very clean finish.  Actually a bit softer than normal.  Very nice beer."
""
""
"O - A decent, well made black IPA that doesn't try to overdo any particular aspect."
""
""
"Overall: Almost reminded me of a slightly hoppy porter. This was just a ok beer, nothing special - not overly smitten with the style either."
"Overall: Probably one of the more balanced Black IPAs"
"Not a very good black IPA. Not much carbonation or flavors. Taste like black coffee. Wouldn't recommend it."
"Not the best black IPA I have ever had but another solid offering from SN."
""
""
""
"Pours black with a brown head that lasts.  Aroma is hop bitterness and slight roast malts.  Taste is light citrus and bitterness with roasted tones and a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is medium.  Overall this is a great black ipa with lots of roast and bitterness.  Looks like a stout, drinks like a roasted ipa."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice compliment to a mix pack, but not something that could stand out on its' own."
""
""
"not quite black, deep mahoghany would be a better description with a tan head. Nice lacing. Rye aroma blended with mild herbal hops. Flavor is rye like but maltier than hoppy, but bitters remain present. Smoother than a standard IPA but still nicely carbonated with a bit of bite."
""
""
""

"Black IPAs are very hit-or-miss with me, and this one is a miss. The weakest of the 4-Way IPA pack, in my opinion. Very harsh bitterness but relatively little hop flavor. Big roasted malts overpower. I'm rarely disappointed with Sierra Nevada, but it's happening now."
"Purchased Mid Jan., 2015 (already has 2015 on the bottle) at a Publix in Tampa. Pours a nice murky black with pillowy eggshell head. Aromas are typical IPA: pine, hops, resin, a little malt, and hints of grapefruit pith and citrus juices. Flavors are darker, with tart, roasted hazelnuts, smoke, and burnt-ness that accompany the aromas. Has a really bitter, charcoaly aftertaste that kinda sticks with ya. Body is in between that of a stout and IPA, with some silky/creaminess. Overall, this is a ""black-tar affair"" of a beer in that it is eloquent, dark, and fucking brutal... not in a bad way, just in a manly, campfire-on-a-frozen-lake kinda way. I give it a B."

"Black, malt, dry with some bitterness"
""
"Medium bodied, slight oily feel, medium-low carbonation, goes down fairly smooth. Out of the seasonal IPA variety pack, this is my favorite."
"This is a great dark ipa.. Has a strong porter taste. Very well made beer! Best of both worlds!"
""
""
""
""
"Malts feature chocolates, caramel sweetness, slight coffee on the finish. Hops are nice and bright pine, slight citrus. A wonderful combination for the style, the malt bill is quite nice and rich while still maintaining a wonderful hop aroma and taste."
"The typical SN hoppy IPA in every sense,  but with a roasted malt goodness that comes off almost coffee like on the finish. A fantastic addition to their lineup."
""
""
"Moderate carbonation. thick vanilla, off white colored head, holds well. Deep amber color. Roasted smell."
""
""
""
"Poured out opaque black and produced a massive three finger off white head that left beautiful skirts of lacing down the glass. On the nose it gave off a mellow dark roast with some coffee, citrus, and grapefruit which went back and forth from malt roast to hops.   The taste is like the nose with a bitterness, dark roast, coffee, citrus, pine, all coming through strong and coming out at different times.  Sometimes I get more citrus/pine and some times I get more of the dark bittered roast qualities.  Comes in medium bodied and slick in the mouth and comes across dry which is perfect for this beer.  This is a really enjoyable black IPA, I wish Sierra Nevada would make this a regular in their line up.  Best beer in their mixed IPA pack and one I wish to try again, Cheers!"

"d  6.8 - good buzz potential - but way to heavy to drink en masse. SAVOR THE FLAVOR"
"Overall a good Black IPA, and even above average compared to what I’ve had, but not outstanding. Easy to drink and hoppy enough to fit in with the Sierra Nevada profile, it was a good new beer from Sierra Nevada and one that I would definitely recommend and have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I am so glad I traded for this beer.  Simply marvelous."
""
""

"The flavor is far more hoppy with a black pepper.  There's still a distinct dark chocolate flavor with a bit of burnt black patent malt.  Neutral body with a mildly diminished carbonation level.  Long hoppy/burnt toast aftertaste."

"It's a superb Black IPA."

"Blacker than your X-wife's soul. More bitter than her heart. Sorta like drinking the spirit of your enemy in existential dominance. Charted malty notes up front like the sacrificial BBQ you burned her voodoo doll on. Finishes with the bitterness of vengeance all consuming. Violent yet, intriguingly addictive. Superb offering from a world class brewery."
""
"Pours black like a stout, with good head retention cream in color. Aroma is pleasant with citrus, pine, roasted malt, and earth notes. Mouth feel is balanced and nice chocolate coffee after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out pitch black.  Light off-white head.  Head is very frothy and sticks around a good, long while.  Smells of roasted, chocolatey malt and citrus/pine hops.  Flavor starts off like a stout with chocolate and coffee.  The hops don't take too long to kick in with oily citrus and pine needles.  Heavy bitterness that lingers.  Stout character returns in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel has a thickness brought on by a carbonation.  It is very active on the tongue.  Awesome example of a black IPA.  Wish this were in 6 packs."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a rich creamy head.  Floral hops dominate the smell but the flavor is a great balance between hops, malt and some coffee in the finish.  The carbonation and mouth feel as superb.  Overall a great beer."
""
"BOD 109/14.  As advertised, this one pours just like a stout - almost black with a massive head.  Lacing and retention are excellent.  The nose is more IPA like, pine and floral hops over a light chocolate with roast notes.  Medium body with a slick texture that is almost creamy.  Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The unique flavor profile is quite nice, balanced and complex.  It begins with citrus hop, then flows to pine over a light chocolate sweetness. Bitterness follows that is citric rind in nature over a very light smoke from the roast - very well balanced so each component is evident, but not over powering.  The smooth finish leaves you with a lingering citric bitterness with a chocolate note.  An Outstanding example of the style."

"OVERALL: I must confess I do not like the Black IPA style. I did however, enjoy this beer. The roasted notes in this style are usually too pronounced for my liking but this beer was pleasantly roasted in an understated way. The hop profile was like a nice traditional IPA should be. I would buy this beer again. Sierra Nevada is becoming one of my favorite brewers. The beers are excellent and reasonably priced."

"Poured a gorgeous deep black/brown with red highlights around the edges and a finger and a half of beautiful tan head. It looks fantastic, like a good stout. Scents of pine resin, peat moss, undertones of tropical fruit, with an emphasis on mango, notes of dark chocolate, coffee and roast malt and faint undertones of orange and lemon zest. A nice aroma that combines rich roasted malt aromas with bright fruity and pine-like notes from hops. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with notes of toffee and dark chocolate mingling with orange flesh and orange and grapefruit peel. Pine resin joins grapefruit peel, roast malt, black coffee and light sweetness in the middle. The finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, and light roast malt. Aftertaste is dry with notes of roast malt, pine resin and grapefruit peel. A good black ale flavor profile that combines a stout with IPA level hopping quite nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation and a resinous, slightly drying feel. Quite nice and very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good American Black Ale. It has the nice hybrid of stout and IPA in its aroma and taste and combines it with a very drinkable mouthfeel. A good experiment that is worth trying."

"Taste is similar to the aroma with the roasty toasty malt taking the front with a burnt bitterness finish, the pine adds in another layer of bitterness that is more civilized, the body is very full and smooth, carbonation is medium-low and gives a creamy mouthfeel."

"Had while at a local grill pub with family. The first thing you'll notice is the bright hop aromas enimating from the glass. It's not clear if they used fresh hops, but the smell is comparable to SN's annual ""Celebration"" seasonal. Pours a deep, dark black hue that lives up to it's namesake. Little to no head present, even with a moderately aggressive pour. As for the taste...well, the smell builds up a lot of hype, but the taste is purely middle-of-the-road IPA. Fruity, piney hops and plenty of bitterness, and not much else. The deep abyssal black hue of the brew and the special roasted malts ultimately don't matter as the bitterness overpowers any semblance of a malt profile from start to finish. It's a decently thick drink, close to stout levels of creaminess, and finishes clean with nothing lingering on the palate. It is an interesting little experiment, and I want to see where they can take it, but until they find out how to keep the hop flavour and cut the over-aggressive hop bite, I'll have to pass on any future iterations of Blindfold and it's derivitives."
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice black ale. It seems the smokey malt flavor and bitterness is a bit overpowering of the hop flavor. It still is an enjoyable beer though. Beer tasted better as it warmed too."
""
""
"O - A pretty solid black IPA, especially for $1 per bottle (part of the 4-way IPA variety pack)."
""
"This beer is masterfully made, please, make no mistakes about that; it's just not my cup of tea, per se. It's very dark, but surprisingly smooth for those of you that are concerned about that aspect of darker beers - a noteworthy amount of people prefer not to chew on the their beers, and that's what comes to mind with darker beers, but I digress... The beer is pretty fantastic, it's just not one of my favorites because, for whatever reason, I've never preferred darker beers... could be because of their consistency and overall texture. I will say that this beer might go fantastic with mesquite smoked bbq... if anybody tries that combo, let me know."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor of the beer tends to be slightly sweet but also full of roasted dark malts and slightly more biting bitterness that the aroma might indicate. A better than average black IPA."
"Overall: this is one of the more quaffable American Black Ales out there, I would say. I feel like it's been brewed for drinkability, rather than extremity, as so many beers of the style seem to be. I rather like it."
""

"Taste was great. I have had black IPAs that I thought were just like normal IPAs but colored different, this was not the case. The dark malt really gave a strong roasty-toasty flavor to the ale. Subtle coffee notes and roasted chocolate were in there too. The roasted flavor was over a sweet malt flavor that led into the sweet grapefruit floral hops and a classic IPA bitter burst at the end. Good carbonation combine with a more full-bodied IPA then is the norm, a nice combination. Overall, a well-balanced and fun IPA. Not your everyday IPA, but a real treat worth seeking out for a night time drink."

"This is a dark, nearly black beer, with ruby highlights when held to the light. The head is tan, thick, and long-lived. The smell has a hint of malt,a grain, and generous herbal hops. The taste is surprisingly well balanced. Full with bitterness, relatively dry, and very flavorful. Creamy and full in body. Nice."
""
"It has been tried before by others but I've never had a black ipa that I would seek out again.  This is the exception.  Love the combo.  Classic sn on the hoop character.  I think this is where the other's miss.  It blends ask nicely with the malt.  Smooth.  Finished one and wanted a second.  Rare in my book"
""

"Overall just a solid black IPA from these guys, and a classic solid Sierra Nevada beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste offers more malt character than the aroma yet doesn't overdoe it either. Touch of coffee and a bit of milk chocolate and thin(not sweet) cherry notes on the finish fit well with a surprising lack of coarseness of bitterness from the dark malts, perhaps debittered in nature. Offers a good carbonation and a light hop bitterness on the finish without being too drying on the palate. Overall I like this for the style, yet perhaps in part because I'm not a big fan of the style."
""
"Oh Sierra you have done it again! Another one I can't breakdown in a review because I absolutely love this offering. Black as pitch with a nice tan brown head, which leaves a great lace. Dark roasted chocolate malty goodness, with a wonderful citrusy finish. Perfect carbonation, easy and flavorful to drink, and slightly reminiscent of my favorite beer ever, Hop Rod Rye. I hope this becomes an everyday selection, as this beer ranks up there with Sierra Nevada's best."

"An escapee from beer camp, this not particularly flavorful offering just doesn’t taste very good. The flavor and texture is of an over-roasted weak stout. Albeit the age may have reduced the hoppiness and allowed the over roasted malt to predominate, this attractive beer is dragged down by its flavor."

"Pours dark cola with fluffy light coffee head. Aroma of light coffee, cola, vegetation, roast. Tastes of roast, vegetation, cola, dark chocolate, bitterness and grass. High carbonation with medium body. Balance between roast and hop bitterness is played with quite well but nothing stands out as really good about this beer."
""
"Has that piney, citrus feel I find in most of the SN IPAs but this time with a nice dose of dark, roasted malts to form a base. Clean and refreshing."

""

"O - From the original masters of the hop comes this late black IPA bloomer, Blindfold. As with the majority of Sierra Nevada's beers, it's hoppy; it's also very well done. The hop bite and flavor adds a unique twist to the chocolaty, coffee roasted malt profile that lingers on the tongue."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall, it isn't bad for the style. It does have some traits that would probably cause it to fail a blindfolded taste test. Happy to have tried it but I'm glad that I don't have an entire six pack of it."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown-highlighted, blackish coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy, off-white surface coat of head. Aromas of roasted coffee in the backbone, with tangy citrus notes and hints of resin. Flavors are very well balanced, with a blast of bitter and roasted coffee traveling across the palate neck and neck with the tangy and tart citrus notes. Resinous and piney characteristics add depth to the flavors, too. The beer is light and slightly effervesced in mouth, bringing a quick end to the roasted and bitter coffee aftertaste. The finish is fairly quick, as well, and a little on the frothed/effervesced side, and a slight resinous and coffee linger. Interesting brew."
""
""
""
""
"Hope Sierra Nevada makes it a regular offering."
""
"The feel allows for a brightness but some strong support from the malts, a good sturdy crispness, and level carbonation that never falls off. It flows exceptionally well, with lots of creamy smoothness on the palate from start to finish. Even dry and woody all the way through, it never gives up depth or richness."
""
""
""
"It takes craft to mix a hoppy ipa with a caramel malt back. Here, on a risk, Sierra Nevada has succeeded. The front side features the hops; the backside is all blackened roast, without too much burnt taste. This beer is a winner, which I hope will be featured by SN more often in retail availability. Like hops? It's there. Like malt? It's there. Very few beers mix these successfully. This one does."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada has dabbled with this style in the past, and I hope they return to it. I like the approach here; nothing is over the top, which stops this from smelling like someone tried to torch a pile of grapefruit peels. This is easy drinking, and I'd have another."
""
"Overall this is definitely the best of the 3 new brews introduced in this package. Easy drinking, the flavors meld well together. Nice take on the style!"
"Overall 4.0: This is a brew that really sneaks up on the imbiber. It seems trendy, goofy -whatever-- but there is a real depth to this beer that far outweighs any initial reaction one might have to it. The best example of this style that I have tried and definitely worth an investment if you are a fan of stouts and are wondering what the ""Black IPA"" is like."

"Poured dark black with thick, brown, foamy head. Has an average amount of lacing on the side of the glass. Has a mildly piney, roasted, caramel smell. Strong roasted, malty taste up front. Can discern mainly dark chocolate. There is some coffee as well.  There is a piney, bitter taste at the end. Strong, bitter aftertaste that persists. This one seems to fill me up like a stout would. Very good black IPA."

"such a good beer, awesome black ipa here, the best of both worlds. we sometimes dont give sierra nevada enough credit, yeah, they are huge, but this latest four way ipa box is evidence that they are among the best in the world, especially when it comes to hops. this beer is coffee black, and has some of that similar earthy bitterness on the front end. its light and airy wispy tan head is similar to its feel, also very delicate and fluffy, nice on the tongue, and subtle or a beer in this style. hops are citric and not bitter, that comes from the grain, a fun complex for this seemingly sessionable yet nearly 7% abv brew. its the perfect accompaniment to rare fillet mignon oscar, with fresh crab hollandaise sauce and wild mushrooms. i put the mushies in brandy and rosemary, and with this beer, its just unfairly tasty. a food driven beer for sure, and it could be a great compliment to a number of cool dishes, has me inspired, but tonight it was first fiddle, and this box of ipa is absolutely sensational."

"Came in a sampler 12-pack. Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz pilsner. Not actually black, but very dark brown, like a porter. Nice creamy tan head and medium-thick clinging lacing. Aroma is hoppy, floral, caramel, sweet, not grapefruit notes. Flavor is mild to moderate hops, nothing like Torpedo, mild dark roast malt, a bit sweet, coffee, a bit of dark chocolate, very nice but a bit tame. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit foamy, not bubbly or over carbonated. Overall this is very good but not quite outstanding to me. An interesting and refreshing black IPA, but not a kick in the head or a really memorable flavor experience like a couple other black IPAs I have had."

"This is a good, well-balanced black ipa. Nice hopped tones I a kind of oily base. Nothing screaming too loudly. But nothing bland by any means. Just a well done version of the style. I could go for numerous of these in a sitting. Hopefully SN keeps this around for a while."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid darker, sweeter IPA, good roast and more subtle hop flavors."
"I'm not really feeling this one at all. It's just not an interesting take on the style to me. I'd love to see Sierra Nevada brew their Juniper Black Ale again.."

"NICE; NOT MUST HAVE!"

"Overall: A solid brew all around, I'm happy with it. Would have been nicer a month or so ago when it was colder weather and I was craving some hops, it is a good way to get in a darker winter brew and satisfy a hop craving. Better drink them before it gets too warm!"
"O: Overall, pretty good but not great. Probably my least favorite one out of the ew variety pack. Definitely worth a try though."

"Sierra Nevada Blindfold Black IPA ---3.5/5"
"Overall - it's a pretty good black ipa but there are to many good beers out there for me to buy this one again."

"O - Best black IPA I have ever sampled and it's not even close. I found the hint of sweetness in the malts made this beer sing. If this came in 6 packs, I'd be buying it all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this really comes across more like a hoppy stout, a la Storm King. The hops are definitely secondary to the malts. It is a very hoppy beer, but the hops aren't presented as the most important flavor component here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice black IPA with a great balance between the malts and hops. The roast and hoppy bitterness work well together, while the light sweetness rounds everything out. Definitely a solid brew"
""
"I love this. Another shocker with the relatively low rating though. The look is great: deep black. Very inviting. The smell is roasted malt and grapefruit; like a roasted grapefruit. The taste is delicious in the same way, if not more so. I wish this was a regular offering."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/30/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense light tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, coffee, roasted malt, light char, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hop and dark roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, pine, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange/lemon zest, coffee, roast, cocoa, light char, toast, pine, floral, grass, and floral/roast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of citrus/pine hops and dark roasted malt flavors; with a very crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice black IPA. All around good balance of citrus/pine hops and dark roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Solid. Nothing extraordinary but a pleasant tasting balanced beer, focusing more on the malts than this still definitely has the IPA hops"
""
""
"appearance was a smooth, brown/ black with a finger of white head, smell was alchohal, coffee, and piney hops. mouthfeel was medium and slightly crisp. taste was strong coffee and other deep malt flavors followed by a wave of hoppy bitterness. was overall an interesting experiance but the combination of flavors didnt work so well for me."
"Ok but not exceptional, a common thing with Black IPAs."
"Overall –A rather enjoyable brew overall. A nice mix of hop, sweet and roast that creates a smooth and easy drinking style."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is really good. Relaly ahs a one-two punch of a ipa, and a porter, then it all ties in together to create a black ipa. Smooth, flavorful, sweet, bitter and bold, has it all. Id buy a 6'er of this for sure. Excellent brew."

"Great black IPA from Sierra Nevada. I had the Beer Camp version... this might be a step better because of it's approachability."
""
""
""
"O - A black IPA that is both satisfying and drinkable. As good as it gets among the limited releases in SN's IPA box, but not on par with Topedo."
"O- If the alcohol was a bit more toned down in the flavor, this would be a real winner. Instead, it's good but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad at all. The flavor of an IPA / stout hybrid and the feel of an IPA. Smooth but complex. Powerful and balanced. I just really like it!"
""
""
"Overall - Good beer. Bought as a single to try and cannot say that I'm dissipointed."

"Pours almost pitch black, there are ruby highlights at the edges when held toward the light, light tan head looks kind of like a dry Irish stout in the glass. Nice full thicket of head with chunky textures. Aroma dark roasted malts, earthy almost mint like herbal hop qualities. It also has a nuttiness that's complementing the dark roasted malt character with some generic ale fruitiness that may be characteristic of the hops as well. Flavor I'm getting more of that nutty character with the bitterness of the hops call me crazy but I'm experiencing something that almost comes off like peanut butter for a minute...maybe I've drank too much DuClaw Sweet Baby Jesus lately, but that's what I'm getting even though I know that's not intended I think it's some interaction between the roasted malts and the hop character here. Caramelized roasted malts, dark chocolate edges more like drinking a very hoppy porter with a bit more malt expression than your average dry dark roasted malt finish, the bitterness here is definitely from the hop varieties used. A very good sipping beer complex herbal/fruity/citrus hop edge wrapped in dark nutty caramelized malts that border on complex iced coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied great textures on the palate, a tad oily but flowing carbonation clears that off the palate quite nicely dry herbal/dark roasted malt finish. Overall, a very good version of the style, it's hard to come by a good Black IPA, I hope this sampler remains available for awhile...I could picture myself needing more of this."
"Pours a dark brown color with both golden and ruby edges. There was well over a finger of fluffy beige head that lingered on and on and finally left gorgeous lace rings in its wake. The nose had a balanced blend of roast and hops. There was little balanced about the flavor profile – it’s a pinch of roast with a good dose of hops. The body is hearty even though this is more on the IPA side of the world of black ales than on the stout side."
""
"Overall, an OK black IPA with lots of bitterness but it's very acidic and not well balanced."
"O: Sierra Nevada makes some great bar beer – that is, something a little more alcoholic than your typical session brew or macro, but without an intense, rich palate. Sometimes those monstrous beers are good, but a lot of times, I’m just looking for a beer to casually drink without breaking the bank (and without getting palate fatigue by the first couple of bottles). This turned out to be a pretty tasty bar beer – in other words, I’m glad I have a couple more bottles in the 12-pack."
"Overall a good beer. If a black ipa straddles the space between an ipa and a stout, this one leans more towards the stout side. After trying all of the beers out of the 4way IPA pack this one is definitely my favorite. Hope it makes a stand alone release"
""
"The Verdict: Very good. A well blended black IPA with a nice blend of malts and hops. Somewhat complex and very tasty, like a hoppy cup of mocha iced coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is, at first, roasty coffee and chocolate, with some definite bitterness from the hops shining through. Finishes a curious blend of bitter citrus hops and roasty malts. A tasty and enjoyable mix of styles."
""
""
"This is a better dark beer than Sierra Nevada's porter or stout, not a hop bomb by any means, this black ""IPA"" is very balanced and provides a near perfect integration of dark malt and hops."
""
""
"12oz bottle pours an almost black color with 1/4 inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is sweet citrus and pine with some chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is roasted malts and dark chocolate upfront followed by some piney hops. Chocolate and pine at the end with some more roasty notes. Medium bodied. Minimal alcohol presence. Certainly a nice beer to find in a Mix 12 pack. Overall, pretty good Black IPA I'd probably buy on its own."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of Black IPAs. Is anybody?"
""
""
""
""
"A very well done Black Ale, though nothing particularly memorable overall."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with only slight light transmission. Two finger tan head that dissipates slowly to a thin film, leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, piney hops, root herbs, slightly vegetal. Flavor follows with toasted malt, piney and grassy hops, mildly earthy, hints of citrus and coffee. Finishes with slightly charred toastiness and grassy hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A nicely made Cascadian black ale with well balanced roast and hops. Nice flavor progression from hops to coffee roast and malt in the finish."
""
""
""
"O: Just a weird light beer with very little hop flavor. I wouldn't call this an IPA. The roast and malts just blanket everything. Not a fan. All of this is making me less excited to try Torpedo."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I REALLY hope they continue to make this beer. Even if I have to buy the mixed 12 pack to get it, itd be worth it. I love Torpedo, Snow Wit is great.... Nooner, meh. This is a must try. Get it!"

"O/D-This style needs to be on point for it to be a success in my book. This one had no obvious flaws or 'put-offs' but it failed to be distinctive in both flavor and aroma."
""
""
""
"O- this is pretty good, lots of porter/stout character nice hop tones. Black ipa isnt my bag so much but this is really tasty."
""
""
"O: Totally disappointing. SN's standard porter is far more enjoyable. Thankfully, I have three more opportunities to give this another chance - this wasn't so horrible that I never want to drink it again. I'm just not that enthused by such a prospect. This is honestly my least favorite SN offering to date."
"O) Nice Black IPA right here... Not quite Black Top, but pretty darn good. I'd go for this again..."
""
"O - I really enjoyed this one, the roasted barley really comes across as coffee along with that huge chocolate profile; it's a nice counterbalance for the bitter hops"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very finely tuned Black IPA that unites such a difference of flavors into one delicious blend. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall: Tastes like a Milk Stout with a more bitter, pine-like finish. Not really a ""Black IPA"". Still good, but a little too fruity to compare to better examples of the style."
""
"12oz bottle from the new 4 way IPA variety mixer. Dark black color, huge head typical of Sierra Nevada beers. They always seem to get the carbonation down. Aroma is bitter coffee, roasted malts, sort of boring. Flavor is mostly bitter roasted malts, not much citrus, not much hop flavor outside the bitterness. Honestly the whole Black IPA gimmick is tiresome, these are just hopped up porters and black ales. They don't taste like IPA's."
""

"Very dark brown color with some deep crimson highlights and a glorious, thick, milky tan head. Loads of lacing. Nose of resinous, grapefruity hops merging with dark malt and coffee. Citrus rind and piney hop oils balance with chocolaty malts to form a nicely blended flavor. Well, I say ""balanced"" though the hop bitterness is clearly winning over any roasty qualities. Resinous, leafy spice with a little char in the aftertaste. Feels solidly creamy in the mouth, medium bodied, and bitter. Nicely done. It's not a hop bomb in terms of aromatics, but the end result us a good example of the style."
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a slightly above average example of a Black IPA, it was pretty true to style, but neither the malts or the hops struck me as being really well done and it just kind of fell right in the middle. This beer had ok drinkability, it was a little smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one would be enough for me since I really don't have the urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, I thought they were both good and true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but but the malt aspect and the hop aspect were just ok. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, there's many Black IPA's that I enjoy much more then this one and I might recommend this beer to someone just getting into the style but I wouldn't call it a great example of a Black IPA. All in all I didn't think this beer was that bad, but I didn't think it was that great either, it kind of fell right in the middle in most aspects and I would much rather have B Craft Black IPA, or Short's Goodnight Bodacious. I would say that this one and Torpedo were my favorite of the mixed IPA pack, but as for the new ones this was my favorite, but as a whole I wasn't too impressed with this new variety pack and I wouldn't buy it again. Nice work guys, this was a pretty solid Black IPA."

"Dark, nearly opaque with a nice large head and plenty of sticky lace that clings all over the glass. Aroma is caramel, toffee, nutty cocoa, pine, and citrus. Floral as well. Taste is more hoppy than the aroma but with a nice dark ale maltiness. Creamy, caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, and some scattered hop flavors. Hops seem more heavily bittering and along with that this beer has a hoppy resiny mouthfeel to it. Very nice. Pretty good stuff. Maybe a little syrupy in texture around the resiny qualities."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. A foamy lattice of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee bean, and slight citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and slight citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice mixture of roast and hop qualities all around."
"Got this as part of sierra nevadas new 4 way ipa mixer. Saved it for last because it was the one that I was the most excited to try. This offering pours a deep mahogany brown with a generous and thick tan head which dissipates to a half finger of creamy film and a damn lot of beautiful lacing. The aroma is complex with lots of roasty malts carrying notes of coffee and caramel as well as a generous amount of hop notes bordering on the piney side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy just as one would hope for and expect from this style of ale. The flavor is an awesome balance of deep roasted malts and bitter west coast hops. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate followed by a generous amount of citrus and pine hops. This is much more filling than one would expect. I'm tasting this along side a Goodnight Bodacious and I honestly think that this one wins out. I hope they release this on its own not just as part of a mixer."
""
"O- I don't even like this style and I enjoyed this. Got it in the 4-way variety pack and i'm impressed but not surprised by this Sierra offering. Like all of their beers it is a nice example of the style..."
""
""
"Roast is a little strong for my liking, as is the bitter finish. Wish the flavoring hops were more prevalent."
"Overall: Aside from the classic Torpedo, this is my favorite of the 4-way IPA pack. This is a great take on a black IPA that showcases roasted malts and a substantial hop presence without being overly bitter or too much like an RIS."
"Poured from bottle (part of 4 Way IPA pack)- Deep brown, nearly black and opaque pour with 2 fingers of dark khaki head. Cold the aromas are muted piney hops with a hint of coffee. As it warms the dark roast coffee aromas take over the hops. Medium bodied, this is a clean beer with nice roasted malt flavors that are quickly consumed by classic SN piney hops. The hop/chocolate bitterness on the finish lingers for quite some time."

"Very big coffee notes on the nose,and very sweet, ice coffee like taste. This was not a Black IPA for me. I like this beer. It was hard to taste any of the hop characters in this beer. It was bitter, but I didn't get any grapefruit, pine notes. Slight grapefruit as I drink more."
""
""
"O: As I said above, I'm just a little dissapointed with Blindfold because it smells, looks and tastes like a porter. This might be the only complaint and I do mean only complaint that I have with S.N. And that is for my money they don't deliver on this style. Overall not a bad beer just not what I was expecting."
""
""
""
"I'm becoming a big fan of Sierra Nevada and this is yet another beer I could drink regularly from them. Matter of fact, I will drink it regularly since the 12 packs are $12.99."
