4.13,-0.5,5,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,"Aroma is very interesting with spices, yeast, hops and a bit of resin. Outstanding appearance with a huge billowy, off-white, semi-permanent head, with lots of lace and a clear honey amber color. Flavor's similar to nose with resin coming out more and lingering somewhat unpleasantly in the finish. Body is on the soft side which enhances that resin finish. Otherwise it's a real good drinking beer.","drpimento","Mar 26, 2015"

Slight carbonation on front of tongue.  Exceptionally smooth, very easy to drink beer while still having a personality.  Nothing challenging about this IPA but be careful because it does not taste like a 7.4 ABV.  I will go back to this beer and serve to none beer lovers because of it's balance, despite the fact I don't think it's especially interesting. Nice.","Maryobeerian","Jan 16, 2015"

The banana and clove breaks through the citrus hop taste.  The banana taste lingers nicely.  The mouthfeel is very smooth with the desired hop bite and clove/banana finish.

4.24,2.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"best beer from a brewery i have never heard of i can remember. what a cool brew, amber in color, light amber, pale copper, with a tall lasting off white head. it smells way more belgian than i usually like in belgian ipa, with a ton of fruity yeast and an almost white wine vibe. the citra hops are the kicker though, they are so well dosed and so fresh and vibrant that they bring the yeast and the malt together where it always seems disjointed in the style to me. the citra is juicy lemon curd and pineapple, which matches the esters in the belgian yeast as well as the higher sugars in the medium crystal malt. a great tripartite synergy here. hops do carry enough bitterness to balance out the sweet, but they are so oily and big that they keep the finish really long. its refreshing though with high flying carbonation. this was a huge surprise to me, one of those beers i had no real expectations for and it floored me. super well made, i am now eagerly seeking more beer from these guys. are they all this good?","StonedTrippin","Beers"

2.5,-39.8,,,,,,"Dat deer be pissed, yo!  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brass-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises leek, old grapefruit rind, clove, light nutmeg, banana peel, and leafy greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, the Belgian-style yeast and spices clashing with the overdone Citra hops, making for, appropriately enough, bedlam on my tongue.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, I just could not get into this beer at all.  The overwrought Citra hops would have been bad enough, but the clash with the Belgian characters just ran things right off the rails.","TMoney2591","Aug 30, 2014"

Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, slight yeast, spice, alcohol, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, hops, floral, hint of grass, strong yeast, spice, and sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, body, and blend.","Tone","Apr 30, 2014"

The Trappist (or, more broadly, Belgian) IPA is not something I have had before, but I will certainly be seeking more out after this masterpiece of brewing craft. This is unquestionably deserving of a spot in my personal Top Five Beers, and is just a hair off perfection. As it is distributed only within a very small radius in Wisconsin, look for possible trades if you are interested. If ever there was a beer that needed exposure, it is this jaw-dropping Trappist IPA. 18.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Sep 06, 2012"

The smell of the beer is so nice, the aromas of fresh fruits like pears, peaches and some pineapple come together on the nose with the sweet Belgian yeast and the Citra hope as well. The taste of the beer was awesome too, a brilliant sweetness in the beginning that is quickly destroyed by the bitterness of the hops. The carbonation is very gentle in the beer, it remains smooth and very drinkable. Overall this beer kicked ass.","Knapp85","Jun 05, 2012"

At first sip it was an unexpected taste, upon letting it warm up and further tastes the beer is palatable but not as interesting as it could have been.

Overripe grapefruit in the nose and some pepper and spice on top of some funky, yeasty smells as well. Good but convoluted. Bite is fairly strong from the hops in the initial taste that's followed by the funky, yeasty spice. Citra hops in the website description are apparent in both. More funk that hop in the taste. Nice Belgian IPA (note how easy it is to talk about it like it's a singular style already), but the marriage of the yeast and hop on this one is not a comfortable pairing. It seems to fight a bit, but just fine for the six pack I bought of it.","FightingEntropy","Jul 23, 2011"

The hop bitterness medium-high, but definitely second fiddle to the hop flavor. The beer finishes rather smooth, with a bit of a dry finish with loads of hops lingering in the palate.

Then here I am just stuck to kick rocks with a bunch of Stoics, holy hams and eggs!” Hermes folded his arms and felt the power that he wielded. His speed could intoxicate a mortal man several times over.

3.78,-8.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Round 2 of Bedlam just came out, so I thought I would check it out. Pours a golden brown with a small tan head. Looks good. Smells like spicy orange hops and the smell that wafts out of the next door neighbors windows before they throw on loud techno and order pizza...this represents a somewhat odd combo. The orange from the citrus hops comes out strongly in the taste, but in a grassy, spicy manner. The hop profile tastes somewhat similar to Surly Furious, though not executed as well. There might be just a touch of bready yeastiness representing the Trappist component, but if you didn't tell me that was there, I am not sure I would pick it up. It mostly comes out with a flavor like a really interesting IPA with a slightly odd twist. Mouthfeel is dead on, not too sweet or heavy, good carbonation. Overall, this is the beer I get 6 packs of when I want to have a few. It's so cheap and has a more interesting hop profile than many local WI beers.","seeswo","Dec 16, 2010"

3.92,-5.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: This was pretty good, sort of like a blend of a Belgian IPA and a DIPA. There are some more enjoyable examples of the style out there.","KickInTheChalice","Aug 08, 2010"
4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"drinkability is great. excellent balance. it leans a little more american than belgian, but it's got a nice hop complexity and it is delicious.","grub","Jul 29, 2010"
4.1,-1.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Really nice hoppy character, nicely balanced, quite drinkable but the alcohol is a bit hot. Thanks Russ!","Viggo","Jul 11, 2010"
4.05,-2.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Really nice take on the Belgian IPA here, with some well balanced and robust hop character that marries quite nicely with that of the yeast. An easy drinking big body on this is only the icing on the cake. This is a winner from Ale Asylum.","Kegatron","Jul 05, 2010"
4.72,13.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"But great results cannot be second-guessed, and this is, by all means and measures, an amazing trip.","cokes","Jun 22, 2010"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Killer nuances create and exotic and deeply flavorful profile in Bedlam. Ale Asylum has proved, once again, that they know their hops and know them well. It's a very good beer with nice drinkability.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 07, 2010"
4.42,6.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: This beer is awesome, very balanced, very tasty. I read an article that said the ABV is 7.5% - if so, this is extremely drinkable! Honestly I wish I had a case or two of this, I could see myself going through a couple bottles for sure.","seh410","Jun 06, 2010"

3.97,-4.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice cloudy amber color with good lacing that sticks pretty well down the whole pint glass. Smells fantastic with a very heavy citrus aroma. Not as hoppy as I expected and a bready aftertaste, but a good balance and just the right amount of carbonation for this brew. It feels really light and I could easily drink a few of these. It's a tasty brew for sure and leaves your mouth a bit dry tempting you for another sip.","TomBrewnansky","May 17, 2010"
3.85,-7.2,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Another interesting extra from FrankenBrew. Pours from the bottle a hazy dark golden color, with some nice lingering off-white foam. Huge floral hop aroma, along with lemons and bubblegum. The Belgian yeast seems more prevalent on the palate, as the hops take a little bit more of a backseat. A really good example of the style, and much hoppier than most.","emmasdad","May 14, 2010"
4.22,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I find this one comparable to the venerable Raging Bitch, with a slightly more complex malt profile and more tempered phenols","blackie","May 12, 2010"
4.22,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Good body and carbonation add up to equal easy drinkability. This is another great brew from Ale Asylum and I love it when they bring the hops! Good way to showcase the Citra hops and the Trappist yeast brings a tasty twist. Thanks Severstad.","orbitalr0x","May 11, 2010"
4.89,17.8,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Brandished copper body. Thin off white head leaves sporadic amounts of lace. Huge hop nose of bright pineapple and all things citrus, including tangerine too. Pineapple is the main player on the nose and a nice one at that. Awesome flavor follows suit with the nose. Hugely radiant citrus hop flavors. Pineapple and tangerine again. Biscuity malt base underneath provides the support needed. Body is medium and carbonation provides effervescent feel. This is really, really good. And I only got a singe of it. Damn.","Bighuge","May 08, 2010"
4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D. Another well done ale from AA that is easy to drink and enjoyable. Though not an upper tier IPA producer yet, AA has two excellent ones with Ballistic and now Bedlam. Highly recommended and one that I will buy on a regular basis.","bound4er","May 07, 2010"
4.4,6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a cloudy, golden color with about 2 fingers of head. Smell citrus hops and a little bit of yeast. Taste is citrusy and hoppy with a clean malt finish, deliciious. The mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. I could drink a lot of this!","Lukafer","Beers"
4.15,0,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D- This was a very well balanced beer that I want more of. I am really surprised that a Belgian IPA can taste so good. I will be looking for this one again if they decided to make it again. First time beer for this company and I like what I have tasted so far!","alleykatking","0"
4.44,7,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Ale Asylum has been putting out quality beers from the get-go, and this is likely my favorite yet. I had a growler two weeks ago, and it's even better fresh. An excellent Belgian IPA!","klikger","Apr 23, 2010"

4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Bedlam...it's delicious, hop forward, yet due to all the yeast qualities, ultimately well balanced. Leaves a fruity, slightly bitter flavor on the palate. I actually really enjoyed this beer. I found the unique combination of flavors to be quite delicious.","Soneast","Apr 13, 2010"
3.72,-10.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D- A good representation of the style. They have found a nice balance between the two which equals a nicely balanced brew. This may be a little sweet for some but I think it is a solid offering from Ale Asylum.","Wisconsinality","Apr 03, 2010"
4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: A solid Belgian IPA. A bit too sweet for everyday drinking, but it was definitely an enjoyable treat.","CharlatanSin","Beers"
4.38,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,5,"Really digging this new offering from Ale Asylum...well balanced, supremely easy to drink while not sacrificing any flavor.
