4.07,1.2,3.5,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. A cloudy dull orange brew with an odd head, a matrix of small bubbles surrounded by a sleeve of much larger bubbles. Fairly good head retention. Aroma is bright and fruity, very citrus-forward (fresh orange juice) with a decent blast of sweet yeast and Belgian clove-like spice, apple, cotton candy. Palate is a very close split between Belgian tripel and American IPA, as advertised. Often a take on this style will skew decidedly one way or the other, but this exemplar really does try to meld the two in equal measure. Very bitter hop finish and tons of citrus hop flavor, orange and grapefruit rind and flesh plus a tinge of tropical nectar for good measure, mango and melon. Also getting a pungent spice like equal measures of clove and cumin, black pepper and cardamom, faint butterscotch and banana chips/peel. A whiff of bandage-like phenols. Rather spicy and pungent at first but softens over time to reveal a fruit cocktail sweetness that begins to dominate the proceedings late. Quite fizzy and there's a little booze in the finish. I dig the whole laundry list of flavors to find in here and one can telescope in and out to alternate between citrus hops and Belgian spice. For all the shit Green Flash gets for various reasons beyond the scope of this review, they produce world-class IPAs and rather solid Belgians as well, and here is where they meet.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 16, 2014"

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, candi sugar, bread, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, candi sugar, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, candi sugar, bread, floral, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of hop and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian IPA. All around awesome complexity and balance of hop and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 19, 2013"

Nose starts with heavy belgo yeast which brings some bubblegum and clove. Hops come through with notes of earth, grass, and a touch if booziness. Taste is somewhat sweet with Belgian notes which bring some sweetness and spice to the table. Hops are next and while they are very present, they don't bring much bitterness to the flavor. Mouthfeel is very bubbly with medium body. Overall, this is exactly as billed.. A hoppy triple. Not my favorite style, but nothing bad about this brew.","homebrew311","Nov 04, 2013"

The trippel part of this brew really stands out in the smell, way more so than the IPA part. The taste is actually pretty balanced between an IPA and a trippel though. Just a hint of pine and loads of citrus and bitterness with that Belgian yeast taste to sort of soften the blow of the hops. Mouthfeel is just below average I'd say. Carbonation was maybe a bit low, I like an IPA with a good amount of carbonation. This beer is basically what you'd get if you took half GF IIPA and half GF Trippel. Now, I enjoyed GF Trippel, but it really wasn't as good as I expected, and GF IIPA is of course amazing, but the two together are just so unique. It brings a smile to my face. This is exactly what GF Trippel was missing.","MisSigsFan","Jul 02, 2013"

This beer is smooth, not too spicy or bitter or anything that may have gone wrong with combining ""western style"" hops with a Belgian IPA. I find the balancing act a succesful one as there is some sweetness in this beer, both malty (candi sugar, caramel, I think) and touches of tropical fruit (tangerine comes to mind for some reason, as does apricot) but also a spicy, strong hop presence (more orange, citric, touches of grape). Finishes with crisp bite and alcohol is well contained. Overall, a pretty good and interesting beer and not too many like this one are around.","clayrock81","Jun 23, 2013"

Now, I don’t think every brewer should make their beers like Stone, with the “Enjoy By” date in huge letters on the label, but it wouldn’t hurt to date bottles in a manner that couldn’t be sabotaged by any bottle shop employee with a wet rag and a desire to sell old beer. At any rate, this is a beer that did pretty well with a little age on it. Though I wished it were fresher, I’m glad I got to try – because it was an excellent Belgo-American ale.","BarryMFBurton","May 15, 2013"

There is a half centimeter of bright white head, moderate lacing. The smell is very fragrant with decend bready malt and fruity belgian yeast of melons like some tasty honeydew. There is a slight resinous hop that sneaks through as well. The taste is a tasty belgian brew with strong bittering throughout. There is a sweet, tangy flavor as well, but not quite sour, very much like fresh, ripe cherries. There is a bit of a champagne flavor to it as well at the end.

4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"this is exceptional and very different. it pours hazy glowing blonde with a tall and delicate white head with great retention. smells like a hop bomb, which is to be expected with green flash beers. there is also some really spicy belgian yeast in the nose thats got some peppery funk to it. the flavor is deep. it starts off like a big sappy ipa with oozing citrus hops and an alcohol sting. it is quickly mellowed and enhanced at the same time by the yeast, which rounds out the hops into a full meal of flavors. a lot of stuff dances around the mouth, but the hops just keep coming back. this is a monster of a beer, fresh as can be. feel is good, bright carbonation and a medium body thats made heavier by the sticky hop quality. overall this is a great beer to share, totally unique and very strong. paired will with some ash cured goats cheese and spicy nuts. give it a try.","StonedTrippin","Aug 26, 2012"

Body is medium large, lots of carbonation, not very dry for the style, and very drinkable for the hefty ABV. This is an excellent example of a style that I am starting to love.

There are aromas of citrus and piney hops, but these are not very strong. There are sweet malts and Belgian yeasts. Having just had a tripel, I can see where this is an IPA meets a tripel. The hops are forward in this beer, but not like they are in typical West Coast hop bombs. There are flavors of citrus, bready malts, caramel, pine, and good Belgian yeast. It tastes like the perfect marriage of a Belgian tripel and an American IPA. The body is medium to full with good carbonation. There is a dry finish to this beer and this is highly drinkable.

The hops are at the forefront of the smell. The hops are readily apparent in the taste as well, but are balanced out nicely by a malt flavor. For how high the alcohol percentage is in this beer, it hides it well. After you take a swig you're again reminded of the hops in the aftertaste, there's a common theme here!

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, sweet alcohol, fruit, wheat, fruit hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, wheat, spice, spicy hop, earth, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was a lot going on in this one in both the aroma and flavor, however they didn’t all seem to work together in my opinion, but rather against one another. This really hurt the overall brew in my opinion. There was definitely a lot of spice going on here which was nice blended with the fruit tones, but the alcohol came along and wrecked it all. Too bad.

4.16,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall (4.0): So, as Belgian IPAs go, this occupies the tripel-BSPA / DIPA hybrid part of the spectrum, which is a pretty solid route if you’re crafting a Belgian IPA. Others are basically American (D)IPAs with a nominally Belgian yeast profile, and others are basic IPA recipes with a farmhouse strain. This beer is Belgian first, and IPA second. It works for me, but whether or not you dig this beer depends on what you’re looking for from the style. But if you like tripels and unfiltered BSPAs, and also love hops, then this is your beer. My only real complaint is that it isn’t as bombastically hopped as a lot of American (D)IPAs, but Green Flash has crafted a really excellent brew regardless. Definitely seek this out!

4.19,4.2,4,5,4,3.5,4,"A 22 oz bomber poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a mostly clear bright orange amber. 2 finger off white head lingers a bit and leaves nice lacing as it slowly shrinks to coat the top. Aroma is very complex. Apricot, bread, grapefruit, fresh cut grass, Belgian yeast, golden raisins, and sour apples. Taste is bitter citrus up front. Grapefruit and pine resin. It quickly moves towards a bready, sweet candi, yeasty flavor. Pretty much a perfect fusion of the styles. Mouthfeel is medium and finish is dry. Excellent beer.","thydarkprevails","May 19, 2012"

2,-50.2,2,2,2,2,2,"The fresher version is much cleaner but has a lot of odd tart and mixed up flavors. They all really dont blend all too great together. I think I prefer this one with the age despite it feeling a little heavier due to the sweeter flavors. The beer gets a lot more complex with time and a lot of great fruit flavors are aloud to come out. The hop presence and the belgian influence just dont seem to work so letting the beer age the hop flavors out is kind of nice. None the less, I wasn't incredibly impressed with this beer fresh or aged. Fresh was just too all over the place despite it being so clean. Aged is kind of nice and exhibits some unique fruit flavors but they're not good enough to store away the beer for such a time. On top of this the flavors get kind of muddied and you can find cleaner belgians ready to drink now with similar qualities.","jtierney89","Apr 21, 2012"

Excellent Head Retention and thick rings of lacing were left on the pint glass. The aroma consisted of sourdough yeasty, spices , cracked pepper, citrus lemon peels and cloves. Medium in body, this Belgian IPA had a base of malted grain, a melody of fruit including pears, granny smith apples and citrus hops. This ale was more fruity then hoppy- not bad just not what i expected. The bottle says that is a mix of Belgian ale and an American Imperial IPA. I just dont find anything ""Imperial"" about this IPA. Overall, i think this is an excellent session beer- just don't go into it thinking your getting an aggressive hopped IPA- You will be disappointed.This beer failed my time honored IPA Test....I give my wife a sip and if her face doesn't pucker - its not up to par.

The beer begins with a citrusy taste that develops into a sweet maltiness that ends with a slight hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium. The drinkability is great but because it is a hefty beer not thank drinkable. Overall an amazing beer, especially being one of my first blends for a beer.","ireyes88","Dec 08, 2011"

Hops maintain a strong fruity presence all the way to the finish where they slowly show a orange/lemon peel bitterness. Impressive this is 9.2% with such a crisp and thin body. Tasty hoppy beer.

It's hoppy, bitter, and malty like an IPA, but it's sweet and yeasty like a tripel. Honestly, this is my first foray into the style, so I'm comparing this to their Imperial IPA, which I had last night and what I'm guessing is the IPA they used in this brew. It shares a lot of the aspects of the Imperial IPA, but it's less intense. The tripel really balances it out. I'm definitely digging this more than their Imperial IPA.","TTAmod","Sep 28, 2011"

I suspect the unique qualities of this beer--specifically its bipolar flavor profile and huge bitterness--will seem offputting to many, and I can't help but feel that the brew is slightly out of balance, and tries to do too many things at once.

A good offering when keeping in mind the challenges of mixing the divergent styles, but a little more hoppy than I was hoping. I'd like the yeast to star a bit more.

4.1,2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"My first time here, might as well go for something I've heard good things about. It pours a clear amber topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, tart mandarin orange, lemon zest, ruby red grapefruit, and banana. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, orange peel, lemon zest, clove, banana, Belgian yeast, and light caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a dry, nearly sticky finish. Overall, a great BIPA, one that definitely lives up to the billing of being a collision between IPA and tripel. Very good times.","TMoney2591","Jun 21, 2011"

The smell of the beer was packed with hops and some Belgian yeast. The aromas of fruits, pine and spice all wrapped into one nosefull. The taste of the beer was really nice, the flavors of a traditional Tripel upfront that quickly gets pummeled by the big amount of hops in this brew. The taste finished with a dry spicy pine flavor in the back of your mouth. The mouthfeel is very delicate for such a beer that has an aggressive side.

That said I think you could make a case for it being more one or the other, as it will come down to the drinkers interpretation of the Belgian yeast presence. However the hop qualities are not lost, and kept me searching the depths of my mandarin tulip. I think the mouth feel and taste make for a wonderful combination. Each are good on their own, but the thing that takes this up a bit is the synergy between them. the pepper tingles with the carbonation, and the yeast coats the mouth in a way that flavor gaps are repaired. The alcohol is there, but it is not by any means a party-pooper. Give this a whirl.","Cavery","May 31, 2011"

The beer has smells of citrus and sweet spices, an even blend that is very enticing. The beer has initial tastes of round sweetness, with a base of spices that taste like coriander and cinnamon. There are also hints of the alcohol in the beer mixed in with the heavier flavors. The beer has a spicy and somewhat sour finish, with the spices and sour notes present on the aftertaste. The beer is surprisingly crisp and sharp, in spite of the bold, round flavors. Finish is pleasant, and this is easily a get-in-trouble, drinkable beer. Could polish off a lot of this one in a given sitting. Very tasty, light, and pleasant beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 08, 2010"

The sweetness of the Belgian can go well with the sweet malt of a big IPA, but the bittering that goes so well with IPA malt does not always integrate with the Belgian sweetness. While not an outstanding beer, the brewer does a pretty good job of getting everyone in the boat. There seems something here that is just a bit lacking, that I can't quite put my finger on.

The aroma has some notes of yeast, wheat, grape/apricot, and a little alcohol. The body feels medium with a kind of slick, honey-like texture on my tongue.

Taste has more of the Belgian yeast flavor at first, lightly sweet, turns sappy and bitter on the finish. Surprisingly, the aroma made this seem like it was a hop bomb, but there's more bitterness than actual hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium, surprisingly low carbonation considering the massive head it started with. Nice rings of lace are circling glass as I finish it off.

Very much a beer to have fresh. Pours a very hazy golden, edging toward orange. Looks almost like a hefeweizen, except for the head which is very finely beaded, pure white, pretty thin, but leaves some okay lacing. Smells extremely herbal from the hops- there is almost a thyme-like aroma to start, followed by more herbal notes and some late tripel swweetness almost obscured by the hops. Tastes marvelous! More of that herbal forwardness, also with thyme notes, married well to the Belgian tripel notes with some sweetness and clove and coriander spice notes with a long tangy finish.

3.82,-5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"One of my favorite beers is Houblon Chouffe Tripel, Double IPA. Le Freak should be right up my alley. From the first pour it is a cloudy orange with a nice rocky looking head. Pretty nice lacing is left along with some little Islands of foam. Others write about pineapple and other specific fruits...I smell fruit...and sweetness, (can you smell swetness?), and Belgian...Belgium...a tripel maybe. I don't smell hops. Others have written that Le Freak is like an American Dbl. IPA made with a Belgian yeast. I disagree. I think that it is a good blend of two distinct styles. For me it is like a tripel that is hopped very agressively (DUH). But, unlike a Dbl. IPA the aroma is very Belgian (yeast and fruit), and the sweetness doesn't seem to be purely malt driven...candy sugar. I am enjoying Le Freak, but...no, no buts...but, but, I am a bit confused. Le Freak is a Cali Double IPA/Belgian Trippel ""Extreme ale converging San Diego-style imperial pale and Belgian-style trippel"". I get the Belgian Trippel, but the imperial pale ale, though not lost on me, seems subdued. Don't get me wrong, there is considerable hop bitternes...lingering bitterness, but no hop aroma or flavor. Finally, Le Freak is quite drinkable. I like the roundness of the mouthefeel with the subtle sparkle of carbonation.","Sanford","Jun 04, 2009"

The mandarin orange and pink grapefruit citrus evident in the nose, avoids excessive sweetness and sourness, flowers and coriander spice add depth, same for the pear, apricot, guava fruit scents, hoppy in a gentle grain-driven fashion, not too bready nor toasty. Full-bodied, pushes into the mouth but ceases the aggression thereafter. The clove, anise, coriander spice beats the white grapefruit, orange citrus out of the starting gate. The carbonation stays at the right level to allow it to retain weight and chewiness, also allowing for clarity and separation of the flavors. The semi-tropical feel of guava, mango, apricot, pear fruit continues, with a glazed or dried fruit character. Momentary pinch of white pepper and salt, however, this only serves as entry to the herbal hops past the mid-palate.

Smell is full of earthy citrus hop, orange zest, pine apple, a bit of tropical / mango comes through. Aroma is balanced with a nice, cakey malt with hints of spicy yeast. Taste is very nice. Assertive bitterness full of earthy, citrus hops reminiscent of biting into an orange with some rind left on it. Hints of a belgian strong golden ale lie underneath... shortbread like malt flavors with white pepper and ginger spiceyness. The bitter finish pairs extremely well with the dry, heavy carbonation beer's swallow. Alcohol slightly burns the back of your throat on the way down, but easily a sipper.

Decent retention and lacing, though the head reduces in size rather quickly because of the giant bubbles. The smell is purely of hops, citrus, a bit of pine and fruitiness. It makes me wonder where the belgian part comes in...until I taste it. You get the characteristic flavors of a belgian ale, almost that yeastiness, sweetness, fruitiness of a trippel. You lose the hop flavor and aroma quickly after the head has reduced and there isn't a whole lot left to smell. There is some bitterness, but really, neither the yeasty belgian goodness nor the hoppiness is able to conquer the taste of the alcohol. You get peachiness, and burning sort of, but mostly that taste that certain unbalanced beers get, and I have not learned to love the taste, and I doubt if I ever will. That really hurts you after you let the taste sits in your tongue for a second. Then you notice that there isn't a huge amount of body to this, unlike most belgians and IPAs. I found myself early on wanting to get back and taste it again, but as it went on, I found myself satisfied but still interested.

Taste is SPICY! Everything hits you at once. Belgian yeast flavors everywhere similar to those of a spicy wit beer. Hops aren't as in your face as the American versions I am used to; hops just work with the yeast to create a wonderful spiciness. Warming alcoholic edge that is definitely perceivable but it works VERY nicely in this beer. A very very faint hint of a soy-like flavor in the finish. White pepper. Some sugary sweetness takes a backseat to all this spiciness (I really can't say it enough), but comes out in the finish. As far as mouthfeel goes, spicy tingle with a little too much bubbly carbonation for my taste...it goes with the theme of the beer I guess...I can't really decide how I feel about it.

This one comes out with a witbier appearance- canary yellow and a firm head formation that laced well and retained to the bottom of the glass. Piercing aromas of lemons, acidic berry-like tartness, and sharp citrus-piney hops that stand out over the softer pilsner malts. Flavors are acidic of lemons, berries, white pepper, and a plethera of other fruity esters and peppery phenols. Hops (Amerillo's?) give a citric orange / grapefruit flavor swirled around strong notes of pine and lemmon grass. The hop flavor is intense, religating the malts to a backup role only. The intense hops and spices give a lot of complexity and variety. A light vineous, barrel-aged tannin quality prounounces in the finish.

It's everything a traditional west coast DIPA has, citrusy hops, pale malts, but with a touch of Belgian style yeast esters. The taste is great as well. I'm a big fan of the DIPA's with belgian yeast strains. It tastes like a top notch DIPA, but the yeast mellows the finish and adds a great deal of complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent beer. It's big on flavor and aroma; highly recommended!","WesWes","Oct 14, 2008"

4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Burnt orange colour with a bit of haze. A vigorous pour resulted in a large, fluffy cap of off-white bubbles that settled to a short, dense layer of foam and left behind lots of clumpy lacing. Big hop aroma. Bracing pine hit my nose first, powdery and grassy notes soon followed, then gave way to fruit tarts and mild citrus. Floral and perfumey as it warmed. Not much in the way of malt could plow through that hoppy onslaught, but there was a bit of yeast and perhaps bready character in the background along with an indistinct spiciness. Hops were much softer in the flavour and played well against the combination of pear and apple up front and the spicy alcohol notes in the finish. Bitterness was restrained yet always present, letting the rest of the flavour come to the fore until the finish where bitterness was more dominant. Sweet tart and citrus (orange peel and lemon) flavours added depth, as did bread and yeast. Pine appeared in the lingering hoppy finish with some herbal notes. Lots of complexity here, especially as it warmed and the alcohol became more prominent. A little more than medium bodied, ample carbonation but still very creamy in texture with very fine bubbles. Dryness built up over time and warmth was there from the first sip. A very drinkable mashup of American and Belgian characters. I quite enjoyed this beer from start to finish.","DrJay","0"

Smell is pretty strong with clove (a bit much), Bazooka Joe, candy sugar, booze, and banana bread. The hops could use a bit more strength in the nose. A weak pineapple and orange zest in terms of hops, but that's about it. Flavor begins pretty strong with an alcohol bite and a big rush of clove and spice. Big bitter hops midway with pale malts and pink grapefruit...and the booze again. Aftertaste is bready with more alcohol and a touch of pepper and zest. Medium body with a stinging mouthfeel. The strong carbonation and over the top alcohol presence make this difficult to drink. This beer has pretty much ruined my mouth, save this beer for last if you plan to drink others so you can keep your tastebuds.","BeerTruth","Oct 07, 2008"

As the taste mellowed out, it became a bit bitter as the hops and malts began to complement each other better.

It smells of citrus and other sweet fruits. The taste is a superb blend of bitter and sweet. There are a ton of familiar-tasting hops, but they are presented in a different guise than your standard hoppy IPA from California (and elsewhere, I've just mostly tried ones like Stone, Russian River, Bear Republic, etc.). The mouthfeel of a Belgian is well-executed. Fine carbonation abounds and serves the taste well. I think the beer is highly drinkable, but then I think it's great. I can certainly understand other people getting sick of these heavily hopped styles. At any rate, I highly recommend it particularly to anyone who likes hoppy beers and Belgians.","popery","Oct 02, 2008"

Smell is of honey, belgian spices, clove, like a good tripel. Taste is where the hops come though...bigtime. Huge hop presence of grapefruit and aspirin-y flavors in the finish. Astringent. It's got all the characteristics of a great tripel - honey, spices ala clove, coriander, white grapes, with a very bold hoppiness that kicks you in the face and grabs you by the balls. I love it. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, very carbonated with tiny bubbles typical of Belgian Ales, astringent-dry finish.

The aroma is of candied tropical fruit, light corriander and white pepper. A tad sweet on the aroma but still nice; hops don't have much of a presence here. The taste is not as sweet as the nose, not as strong on the tropical fruit (which is good). The flavor has nice Belgian yeast phenols, nice candi sugar presence, and an American hop kick in the end. It has a bitter resiny hop which quickly balances out the Belgain characteristics. The feel is moderate and well carbonated, rather crisp, finishes on the bitter end. More of a hop driven Belgian IPA, which is what I expect from an American brewer. I prefer the more Belgian sided BIPAs but this is a very well made brew.","Gmann","0"

Aromas are a sweet mix of west coast citrusy hops melding with subtle spicy phenolics. So far on all the Belgian IPAs, Le Freak gets the aroma right: HOPS with Belgian yeast character. On the palate, things continue to be done right. This is truly an IIPA with tripel flavors, and not a tripel with subtle hop flavor. Mouthfeel hurts this beer a bit as it's nearly syrupy thick with moderately low carbonation, hurting the drinkability.

Huge nose of fresh hops and a clean Belgian yeast quality, very impressive to combine the aromas of the two styles so perfectly. Hops play a very important role here, initially they attack fresh, with lots of pine, plant/cannabis, and citrus fruit character and some subtle spice provided by the yeast, then once the quality, semi-sweet pale malt texture with a different bready yeast note really caresses the tongue it rounds and transforms this beer into a balanced animal.

4.11,2.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy orange with a decent lasting head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp citrus hops blended nicely with Belgian yeast. The taste is an interesting blend of hops and yeast with sweet malts present as well. The beer certainly shows its 9.2% but it is still crisp, well carbonated and refreshing. While it's certainly no Houblon Chouffe, this is a very respectable American attempt at the style.","atsprings","Aug 26, 2008"
4.25,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"I fell in love with this beer on tap, and I adore it from the bottle. This is absolutely my style, and the addition of the massive, American-style heavy hop hand is right up my alley. Sweet.","BretSikkink","Aug 24, 2008"

4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a fully fogged in orange with a brown hue. nose is real strong with lemon and seems to smell like Pine Sol. Yeah. I said that. Flavor is smooooth. Real smooth. Meaty hops and meaty citrus. Robust and earthy. Feel is silken on liquid. This is pretty tasty. Surprisingly, it leans much farther to Belgian than IPA, which is good. Well done. Very well done indeed.","RblWthACoz","Aug 21, 2008"
4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: easy to quaff this beer. Tasty, well balanced and somewhat refreshing. Worth picking this one up.","Gavage","Aug 18, 2008"

4.1,2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Superbly drinkable so long as you like a dry beer, this is very dry. Herbal and dry the only thing I would avoid serving this beer with is anything sweet.","Zorro","Aug 16, 2008"
4.15,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"A smooth and tasty brew with a potent 9.2% abv that probably limits its drinkability, but otherwise I could sip this one all day. An interesting blend of styles from one of my favorite breweries.","cvstrickland","Aug 15, 2008"
4.13,2.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Another very good beer from Green Flash, is it possible for this brewery to make a beer that is not delicious? Great example of the new style, glad I finally found it.","Halcyondays","Aug 06, 2008"
4.32,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability- Le Freak is as drinkable as 9% beer can be. After an hour walk with the dogs on a hot august day this is very nice. Wish I had another.","Kraken","Jul 09, 2008"
4.32,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours murky golden peach color. Nice thick frothy head, gives way to a firm steady sheet of lacing. Nice combination of spicy phenols, clove, sweet belgian candi sugar, and Belgian yeast aromas. Also some pine and citrus hop aromas layering underneath. A definate west coast spin and I like it. Taste is much the same, nice clove, candy sugar, and spicy phenol and yeast flavors to start. The finish however gives way to a nice citric, piney, grassy hop bitterness. The warmer this got, the more the hop bitterness started to come to the forefront. Body and carbonation are spot on. Phenols are there, but in a more spicy character and not detracting at all. Hey, you got your triple in my Ipa, no you got your Ipa in my triple! A San Diego style Triple, you betcha. A really nice balencing act, that hit me in my wheel house. Seek this out.","drunkmonk","Jun 13, 2008"

4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Traded to me in a brewer bottled 22 oz. bomber by Eyedrinkale as part of the BIF 2008 Race package, Le Freak was poured into a Duvel tulip. The beer looked very clear, golden in color, and had a two finger thick head of foam. The initial smell provided an enticing whiff of hops similar to an IPA, but deeper breaths revealed floral, yeasty, and spicy scents more typical of the Belgian styles. The taste was also a near 50/50 mix of the two influences, with the hops up front, and tropical fruits and yeasty funk shortly thereafter. Candi sugar like sweetness was also apparent and the subsequent peppery phenols were finished off by a bitter aftertaste. I love that this marriage of two styles has managed to present the essence of both in a melded yet distinct manner. Seems like such an ordinary concept on paper, but others that have tried it don't seem have pulled it off quite as well as Le Freak.","rajendra82","Mar 09, 2008"
4.3,7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D-ok, I'm just going to say it; this is my favorite Belgium-Calfornia IPA combination. It wasn't the first, but while others have been more of a tripel-IPA, this strikes me as a saison-IPA, and the spiciness of the yeast and hops integrate better than others I've tried (and I've had a few).","3frog","Beers"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at the Gate in Brooklyn ,NY as part of their recent California bee event. Always nice to try a new offering from a Green Flash. This pours hazy, apricot amber, under a rich looking off white head, that lasts and dissolves to tiny bubble film and shimmering lace on the glass. nose explodes with , ripe fuits, tropical and citrus, yeast, bread, and a mellow undertone of funk, wow, nice. Heady, bold and tasty brew. A lot going on here. Yeast, more tropical fruity ester, spiced up hops. Yummy, aggressive brew. Love the style and this one delivers the goods. Only wish this one was available in the local area on a regular basis. Oh well, gotta get back out to San Diego!","Billolick","0"
4.47,11.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Taster's Note: From my understanding, this is basically their West Coast IPA brewed with the same yeast that they use to brew their Trippel. Many thanks to oodeftone for the growler!","Beertracker","Oct 31, 2007"

3.75,-6.7,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"On tap at Green Flash, they said they were the first or only brwery to create a belgian IPA, sounds dubious but ok. Hazy, cloudy, murky yellow orange. Smells spicy, some herbal hops. Taste is more perfume than floral. Mouthfeel was chewy and probably the best feature of this beer.","ArrogantB","Jun 13, 2007"
4.11,2.2,2.5,4,4.5,3,4.5," This beer has a fairly heavy body, a bit too much for my tastes. Also, the unfermented sugars were present in the beer. Aside from this and the crummy appearance of the beer, it is very drinkable. If the brewery wasn't getting ready to close for the day I would have stayed and drank more of this stuff. Definately an interesting beer to try even if you aren't in to these styles.","t0rin0","May 10, 2007"
3.7,-8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer is fairly dry tasting, yet it has a heft and body to it that belies this. I think the earthy, chewy spice notes help to dry out what would otherwise be a beer with some sweetness. Grassy hop notes are noticeable up front and the beer picks up some pale-grain sweetness after the first couple of sips; still it is fairly dry over all. A biting, herbal hop note is found in the finish; an austere bitterness as well as some hop flavor contributes to this. The beer is very hoppy, yet still the Belgian yeas character comes through in a supporting role.","Gueuzedude","May 07, 2007"
4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Plenty of body with the ""cask"" smoothness, make this rather high octane brew ( 9.0% ABV if I'm not mistaken) go down effortlessly and most enjoyably. This is a kick-ass, larger than life, authentic in style offering from the Green Flash, that I look forward to having again...on tap or cask conditioned!","scottoale","Beers"
