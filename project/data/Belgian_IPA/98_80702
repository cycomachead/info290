If you aren't big on more hop-forward IPAs you have to give this one a try. Honestly, I don't understand why it's not rated even higher. Just a great beer.","Grugalug","Feb 21, 2014"

3.75,-1.8,4,3.25,4,3.75,3.75,"Anyway... We had singles of it, so I figured I'd give it a shot to be able to tell customers how it is. The appearance is hazy yellow, 1 finger white head, plenty of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass, all nice aspects of a White IPA except points off for zero lacing. Aroma seemed very faint to me with hints of orange and pineapples in there somewhere if you searched for them. The flavor outweighed the scent by a long shot -- nice burst of tropical fruits and a firm but not overwhelming hop bitterness, lemons or limes in the aftertaste. I feel like there's a sort of tartness or sour flavor that lasts on the tongue but since no one else said that I feel kind of crazy. Pleasantly surprised by this offering from Harpoon, I could see myself buying a six pack when the weather starts getting a bit warmer. Cheers.","RummyRedbeard","Jan 29, 2014"

Smell is clove, mango, oranges, fresh cut grass, and some hints of banana. Taste is all of that, a nice pucker of grapefruit that hangs on the tongue a while. Body is not quite medium, great amount of life, a little dry, and easy drinking for sure. This is a solid beer, I love so many of the cross breed's. Toss extra hops in any beer and I like it.","SawDog505","Jan 18, 2014"

Small white head and a cloudy, orange/ copper color to the body. Taste of hops hit first, then the citrus and spices take over. Finishes nicely tangy and tart at the end. Very refreshing IPA.","DFlynn","Jul 10, 2013"

They were drinking PBR and would not partake. Enjoying my third beer of the evening and really enjoy the white IPA. I can taste the orange described on the front page of the beer but cannot taste the coriander. Come to think of it I don't know what coriander tastes like. The beer is a little "hoppy" but I tend to like that. I will definitely drink this beer again. Inexpensive but good.","Eeroomnhoj","Apr 14, 2013"

The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability goes. As far as Belgian IPAs go, I actually like this one.

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, coriander, spice, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, citrus, earth, fruit, and coriander. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like what I found on this brew if I am honest. There was a nice touch of complexity and balance going on in both the aroma and the flavor. The coriander note I got was a really nice touch for the style, but the citrus notes were what made the beer for me. It added just the right amount of sweetness to the brew to keep me smelling and tasting it as long as my sample lasted. Could easily crush a pint of this and maybe a few more while I was at it.

3.75,-1.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Harpoon's BWhite IPA pours a very cloudy tangerine, with three fingers or so of fluffy white foam rising to the rim of the glass. Head retention is pretty good, and the foam sticks to the side of the glass and leaves lacing pretty well. The nose has a little bit of spice to it, but otherwise just lots of juicy, citrus aromas wafting up from the glass. There's a lightly appreciable wheat graininess right at the open, before a sturdy bitterness makes itself known. The hoppy finish has some orange tinted citrus flavors, but it's not quite as pungent and "in your face" as I would have liked. The body has just a little bit of the chewy quality that I sometimes associate with wheat. The carbonation it's matched with though is just not lively enough. Harpoon's (newest?) entry in the 100 Barrel Series is a good take on the new White IPA trend, but it could stand to be a little bit hoppier.","axeman9182","Oct 12, 2012"
