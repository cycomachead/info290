"Love this beer. One of my favorites. If you haven't had it, seek it out. It can be difficult to find."

"The nose is brown sugar with dark fruit hints of alcohol and vanilla. It pours hazy amber with a thick rocky head, alowly descenting to icebergs of foam that produce thick lace. Brown chunks suspended in the beer give it a snow globe quality or perhaps a desert sandstorm. The beer is not that old and there are no hints of oxidation on tha palate. On the palate the fruit starts as caramel sweetened peach that gradually becomes more raisin-like. The flavors at the beginning feature the alcohol interacting with the malt and the yeast while by the finish the interactions between the alcohol and the hops become more prominent. Medium body and carbonation."

"Pours an amber color with medium head that clings to the glass as you drink.  Medium malty flavor with hints of caramel in the finish."

"I think I just might be less prone to like high ABVs, because the strong alcohol taste kind of ruined it a little for me (hence the lower rating on taste value).  Still, overall, this is a fairly solid IPA: Nice color and aroma."

"Not my favourite."

"Another exotic one from Belgium. Smell like barrels, intense, resembling quality red wine. Lots of a snow white foam, but beer color is nice also, dark orange. Earth tones at first, than citrus and melons. Sweeter than expected, but doesn't overload taste buds. Nice finish with malts and hops."

"Going not by style, but by the ale, this is really nice and flavorful. If it were by style it is off the mark into a Belgian strong ipa and NOT a triple. That said....the beer pours a bright orange with thick frothy white head and EXCELLENT lacing and later pooling thin layers of foam. A ""live"" ale which I am fond of since it lives and matures much longer. Nose is sweet malts mingling with spicy hops, lemon grass, and Belgian bready yeast. Taste is up front sweet candy malts and sweet fresh bread yeast---ahhh the Belgians and their fantastic malts and yeast strains! The sweetness subsides into a citrus note, turning into a bittering hops note that lingers on and on. Very nice mouthfeel, nicely carbonated and smooth drinking. Excellent by ale standards, but not really a true Belgian triple. Great for hops heads, a bit over the top for Belgian lovers of which I AM."

"On tap at moeder lambic this was a sleeper hit in my book and made the trip. As others have said its red-orange, white head. What I appreciated is a smoothness to the middle and finish that helped make it work so well. Good for De Musketiers to take on the big guys and come up with this hit."

"An amazing beer for anybody. Such a beautiful orange color, big juicy body, all while being finished extremely hoppy and bitter. A true Belgian ""Triple IPA", and a must try for American IPA fan. My favorite part of this beer is the craftsmanship that goes in to the head, retention, and lacing. So big and white, with both fluffy and sticky characteristics. One could spend 30 minutes just admiring the head before sipping the beer. Big hit in my world."

"O - Overall very well balanced and certainly outdid my expectations for a lower IBU india pale ale."
""
""

"The beer is a murky, rusty orange with a gargantuan white head. The aroma brings some spices, particularly coriander. Floral hops and citrus. Perhaps lemon candies soaked in alcohol. Sweet up front and balanced by Belgian yeast and hop bitterness. Alcohol presence is noticeable but delicate. Easy drinking for such a big beer. Very enjoyable, especially such a fresh and vibrant bottle."
""

""

""

"Poured a cloudy orangish brown with two finger head that died quick with a little lace patches. Strong citric hop aromas with touch of spice and some yeast but not much sweetness. Taste/mouthfeel more of the same as not a complex ale but it hits is spots. Mild sugary caramel sweetness at times, the citric hops are noticeable, a touch of spice and breadiness add flavor and mouthfeel, finishes with a little boozy hop bite. Good balance and easy to drink, this is quite the enjoyable beer."
""

"Good beer from, the Brewers of de Musketiers, this Troubadour Magma."
""
""

"Whoa! Big maltiness, almost like an English old ale. Turned toffee and flat caramel tones promote high grain content. Alcohol is no joke either. Hops seem duller now, however, the flavors are still a little more exotic. More red apple, melon, orange, grapefruit, and apricot. Mouthfeel is luxurious. Very interesting bite full of fine-grained carbonation and wet body plus. Alcohol is sneakier as it warms, but the general ABV is no secret, really. Pushes for greatness; falls a little short."

"Overall: Pretty complex taste, has a little bit of everything going here and just drinking this I feel that it can be paired with anything from steak, to even dessert. Little pricey but still satisfies....Salud!"

"11.2 oz bottle into a tulip. Burnt amber, hazy, creamy white head. This is the European hopped version of a Belgian IPA. Hops are punch of herbs and spice - grassy, peppery, earthy (almost dirty, in a good way), slightly soapy and powdery. Slather of caramel on the palate seems to balance things out a little, but thankfully this isn't a sweet beer. Ethanol flairs just a little as it warms. Ultra dry finish with lively carbonation gives a nice fluffy mouthfeel. A pretty solid brew, nice flavors to sip and savor. What makes this a triple IPA as the label states - the ABV I guess? It's not quite as hoppy as even a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a honey flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mouthfeel is off on this one."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Flemish brown ale."

"O- Wonderful beer, tasty and easy to drink. Hops aren't killer, and the Belgian notes aren't too off-putting for my palate. Looks amazing."
""
""
"O: I wasn't sure what I was in for when I poured this beer, I was expecting a highly hopped Belgian and for the most part that's what I got. It has some Belgian characteristics and some more of an IPA but it doesn't really blend either to that great of a result. The hops end up being more bitter than flavorful and the Belgian notes are lost on your tongue. This isn't a bad beer by any means, just not a great one."

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Hazy amber-yellow pour with an off-white two finger head with good retention and lacing. Very tropical and earthy nose with hints of pineapple and mango along with orange peel, caramel, bready malt and a touch of apricot. The nose follows suit with hints of pineapple, apricot, pine, grapefruit, mango, candy sugar, caramel, and a bit of grass and biscuit as well. Not your typical Belgian IPA as this leans a bit more towards the West Coast. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy and slightly oily and boozey on the finish. I had this on tap at Moeder Lambic in Brussels last week and forgot to ask if it was the Special Edition version as it was much bolder with a huge fresh hop character. This bottled version is still a very solid IPA, but I preferred the draft."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 Sorachi ace edition, best before august 2015. This pours an extremely carbonated massive off white head, the color is a hazy orangish golden color, the head has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells a little barnyard and funk along with some medium lemon grass hops and a decent caramel backbone. The feel is medium to even thick for an ipa. The taste is good but lighter than an ipa, light hops and caramel, belgian funk."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 5/3/2013 printed on the cork. Pours extremely cloudy reddish orange color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big caramel, orange, grapefruit, citrus rind, pineapple, herbal, floral, grass, molasses, honey, bread, toast, light pine, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, complexity; the bottle age is definitely apparent being that this is a Belgian IPA. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, grass, herbal, floral, toast, biscuit, honey, pine, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus zest, grass, herbal, floral, toast, biscuit, honey, earth, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Excellent flavor balance and complexity; great hop/malt flavor balance; zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA! Great hop/malt balance and nice complexity; extremely smooth to sip on for a 9% beer. A very enjoyable offering as I expected."
""
"(ps. Belgian IPA?)"
"Overall average at best. Save you money and buy the American version."
"O: The heavier mouthfeel and malty caramel flavors definitely make this feel like itâ€™s a strong IPA but any traces of alcohol are well hidden."
"O: Not the greatest smell to this beer but not sure if that has something to do with the age of the beer or if that is just how it is... The flavor is still quite enjoyable and the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, orange/copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, citrus hops, citrus, sweet malt, and slight tart notes. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight alcohol, slight hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend. Even though there is a high ABV, it is well blended and not too strong in body."
""
"Served from tap into a Troubadour tulip (proper!). Poured red-orange with a two and a half finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, citrus, citrus hop, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, citrus, citrus hop, spice, and big sweetness. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. First off, the sweetness on the flavor of this one was almost too much as my score will attest to. Luckily there were some citrus notes that helped to bring it back to an average brew for the style, but there was really no real balance going on here which was very saddening to me. Glad I got the chance to try it, but doubt I would order a glass again if there were other options available."
""
"On the label it states a strong amber ale with dry hopping sounds right up my alley and pours a hazy golden amber hue which leaves a two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is marzipan,mandarins,boiled candy,grapefruit and fruitcake,the mouthfeel is full bodied and has tastes of lemon sherbet,mandarins,grapefruit,heather honey,lemon tea and finished with a toffee bittersweetness and overall i like it and would drink again anyday of the year cheers."
"O: The hops flavor is dull but I'm sure this wasn't a fresh example. The alcohol isn't very restrained and is a touch on the boozy side but overall a pretty good beer with a substantial bitterness."
""
""
""
"Pretty good - a tasty brew. Not sure if it really qualifies as a Belgian IPA, but then I don't know the brewer's intentions. Also, I suspect the bottle is rather old and therefore the hop character has probably faded. Sweet, fruity malt and lots of yeast notes in the flavour. The hops are present in the aroma but less so when tasting. Quite boozy. A tasty beer; worth sampling if you have the chance."

" Mouthfeel is fine- medium body with light carbonation. Definitely could use some more bubbles on this one. Undeniably a good brew but for the style I think Houblon Chouffe is preferable."
""

""
""
"O) An excellent triple. I will run, not walk, back to wence I came and buy more."
""
""
""
"O: a solid brew but a four pack runs prety steep go with the 750. One of the nicer looking beers out there"
"This is a nice belgian that poured a cloudy orange with a one-finger lacing head. Its got a nice citris, malty, spicy aroma. The hoppy taste came in right behind a sweet citris intro, but was perfect to cut what could have been an overly sweet taste. The beer is on the thicker side, but the hopps really come to life as you drink this one. Overall, this is a pretty good Belgian beer with a failrly unique blend of sweet citris and hoppiness."
"Overall a world class Belgian. Enjoy one today!"
""
"O: This beer is heavier and creamier than other belgian IPAs I have tried. It's good, but not incredibly drinkable. I'll have it again in a few years when my preferences change again."
""
"This was an excellent beer, all of the flavors were very prominent except for the alcohol. This is something I would definitely look for again."
"O - I like this imperial Belgian IPA and I will surely have it again. I am very glad more and more brewers on the European main land are having a try to brew this beer style."
"Not bad but I don't think I'm a fan of this Double Belgian IPA style as it would seem to be at 9%, at least not fresh maybe. It's just a little out of whack and needs some time to come together."
"4.0 D: Surprisingly a very good beer. Incredible nose and solid everywhere else."
"D: This was like orange and apricot jam on white bread, liquified. It was a pretty enjoyable scent and taste, with a nice body. The finish was a bit rough though, so it wasn't the easiest to drink. A generally nice Belgian IPA, but not the best of the style."
"Nice beer."
"Nice bite to it, not the resinous I was expecting. Low abv and easy to drink. Not 'triple' hoppy, but solid"
"Overall, a very interesting brew. I guess I expected something more along the lines of houblon. Much more bitter finish and less belgian yeast character, from what I recall. Wish the belgian yeast was more prominent and that the hops were a bit more complex...not mostly bitter."
"Overall-First time having this beer and I was quite impressed, I usually go for American IPA's but was at my local Belgium beer bar and thought I would give it a try, I was not disapointed. Nice hop flavor coming through, tasted somewhat like an americna Imperial IPA, which makes sense considering the IBU and ABV corresponds with a similar flavor profile."
""
""
"O: Love the nose, not so much a fan of the rest of it. Interesting to try, but would not be a repeat purchase."
""
"Overall â€“ Although not terribly interesting to think about while tasting, itâ€™s still a good-tasting brew."
""
""
""
"o - a pretty good Belgian IPA..."
""

"D: [DRINKABILITY] Pretty average brew and not particularly exciting. I won't be ordering another."

"O - The folks that tried this with me were put off that it tasted like many domestic IPA's. I felt differently. This is a bit of a fusion of styles and I found it to be one of the more noteworthy of the belgians out there. Worth trying; I know I will."
""
""
"O-A more hopforward Belgian IPA than I've experienced before.Good but not great."
"O-Overall this beer is just OK. Don't know if I'd ever get it again, but glad I gave it a try."
"O: This is one of the better Belgian IPAs on the market, and is also arguably the one most attuned to American tastes. If you like hops, then you'll probably like this beer."
"The finish offers a mix of sweet and fruity flavors and dryness of the hops. And if it does not really feeling fresh, her marriage to the fruity beer is extremely successful."
"Pours a hazy orange with a one and a half finger fluffy white head. The head does not leave much in the way of lacing though. The aroma is of tropical fruits up front along with some sweetness, and a hop bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste follows suit. The beginning of the flavor is of citrus and tropical fruits, sweet not bitter fruits. There is a hint of belgian yeast and spiciness in the middle before a decent bitter hop bite at the end. The flavor is balanced but not as good as some in this class. The mouthfeel is a little thick and sticky with moderate carbonation. Overall the beer was solid, it wasn't best in class for this style but a solid decent beer."
"Sampled on October 15, 2011. The pour is medium amber to orange with a significant fluffy head topping it off with lots of little chunks of sediment floating around. The head lingers forever. On the nose there is a this kind of butterscotch sweetness, malts, some fruit, and bitter hops. The body is in the medium range, which seems just about right but not extraordinary. The bittering hops jump out immediately in the taste with a more muted malty character than in the aroma. But overall well balanced. I found it to be an enjoyable brew that doesn't quite mask the alcohol in the taste but allows me to savor it without feeling overwhelmed by it."
"Pours foamy golden appearance. Hop aromas. Big and delicious hops followed by big malt. An evening beer, a good one. Yeasty.Above average mouthfeel. Quebec private order. Like a double Belgian DIPA. Good drinkability.Worth seeking out.Thanks Fred.A little alcohol."
"Troubador Magma came in the glass looking faded orange with some bright bronze swimming within. Just some sparse white bubbles on top, no lacing. Smell is fairly malty but there is also some bright citrus hops rounding out with a whiff of alcohol. Some grain makes an appearence after a bit. On first sips, this tastes more like a weak barleywine to me, it just has that bigfoot taste to it, though watered down if that makes sense. Tastes of rancid pine, highly bitter(like a fresh bigfoot) with light tropic fruits. The belgian yeast while there, is not as pronounced as some in the style. This is more American than Belgian IMO. Feel is sticky and insanely bitter especially with the aftertaste. Carbed up very low, but enough to make a dent. Glad I tried it, this is a unique beer, and it was a good kickstart to the weekend with the 9%"
"Poured into a tulip glass, a hazy burnt orange color with a nice white head that retained well, leaving a bit of lace on the glass. Decent aroma, bread and honey, Belgian yeast, and a crisp organic hoppiness. Taste was similar, crisp and bready, caramel, apple skins, and a touch of spice, nicely hopped with a good balance all around. Medium-bodied and quite drinkable, just watch your intake...higher alcohol was barely noticeable."
"overall: for an expensive IPA, there are certainly better. nevertheless, this certainly beats your average 6-pack."
"D/O: this isn't very enjoyable at all. Not repeatable. 1.5"
"I enjoyed this beer. Great balance of sweet and bitter. Easy drinking. Highly recommend."
"Great stuff here. One of the best Belgian hop bombs I've come across. When I was in Bruges and in need of hops, Magma (on-tap) was the perfect beer for the perfect moment, and this bottle does not disappoint."
"This is a very interesting beverage. The hop presence, especially in the aroma, is amazing. Very good, and extremely drinkable for a beer this hoppy/alcoholic. Yummy."
"Notes: This came highly recommended and unfortunately did not live up to the expectations. It's a new arrival in the area and should be fresh, although the smudged date is never comforting. But although enjoyable for me it hits the more astringent and unremarkable side of the style."
"O - This beer has good drinkability. It goes down easy and has a very nice flavor. Overall, I thought this was a really nice beer. I'm glad I got to try it, and I would definitely drink it again."
"Big DIPA with just enough Belgian yeast to show its origin. Simcoe dry hopping, and there is some tropical fruit in there. But way too hot to really enjoy."
"(D)- I enjoyed this one. A good happy medium of hops and belgian characteristics."
"Overall this is a great brew but when it comes to the IPA, I'm sticking with the America IPA. Definitely worth it though and would have it again for a nice IPA change."
"Overall, not bad. All of it's characteristics are well balanced."
"Overall, a beer worth trying but not the best Euro-American IPA tht I've had."
"D - just a little disappointed here, has a few good things going for it but just kind of falls apart in the end. hurt by a slightly abrasive mouthfeel without enough to make up for it. a very decent beer and I'm glad I had it."
"Overall, a much different IPA than other Belgian inspired ones. Bold tastes that hold a decent balance makes this one unique and worthy of your hard earned cash."
"O â€“ Fruiter than I was expecting, but nice flavor and balance overall."
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color with a few floaties. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light grapefruit hops, flavor is almost sweet grapefruit, malts are balancing the hops really well. Decent TIPA. $4.99 for a 330ml bottle from Kappy's Fine Wine & Spirits Peabody, Ma."
"If you encounter this beer, and you are a fan of golden Belgian ales, give it a try. I think you'll like it."
"The flavor is again quite sweet. Lots of caramel and pale Belgian malts. Pepper and earth for balance, citrus is kind of out there. A little unhinged, not necessarily in a bad way. Full body, not very crisp. I enjoyed the aggression on the palate, but it's a little sweet to me."
"The flavors are complex and interesting but not quite harmonious. The nose is unfortunately weaker than would be preferred."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry pine and caramel like notes. In the taste, pine hops and a caramel like maltiness. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry hop and caramel like aftertaste. Nice hops, but the caramel is a bit much, nice but just OK."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Slightly sweeter than I expected. Definitely a sipper and overpriced at $4.99 for an 11.2 oz. I realize this is a short review, but this beer was just not at all that interesting to me."
"I sincerely love this beer. Probably one of the best that I have tasted from Belgium. It isn't overly complex, just a simple, straight-forward beer. You really get the glamorous citrus fruits without the bitter hop burn from a lot of Belgian IPAs...but I think the major aspect of the flavor profile that distinguishes this beer from others is the well-integrated malt. The brown sugar notes just really make the beer what it is. I'll definitely spend $20 on a four pack in the future."
"Not bad; not great. Poured with a large, thick, creamy, foamy, frothy, cream colored head and lots of lace. Color is a very hazy to cloudy medium amber. Aroma is lots of caramel, malt, toffee, hops, a little fruit. Flavor is like nose with bittersweetness standing out. Body is full and good although it has alcohol warming. Finish is like flavor and of medium length."
"An interesting take on a Belgian pale, for sure, but I'll stick with the classics."
"Pours a golden orange color w/ a nice two finger off white head in a tulip glass. The smell is of citrus fruit, hops, caramel, and malt. The taste is the same. A nice combination of sweetness and malt, and hops. Nice mouthfeel- hoppy aftertaste, but the malt won't give up! This is a nice beer- maybe not world class, but very good. I'd like a little less sweetness, but overall it's pretty tasty. Drinkability is good, I really don't detect much alcohol, which at 9% ABV is impressive. Glad I tried this one- this was the first time for this beer."
"This is a nice Belgian IPA. It has plenty of well balanced flavor to go around. The alcohol isn't completely masked and is tasted."
"Good beer"
"Bottle via glouglouburp- cheers Dany- Pouts a muddy/hazzy apricot colour with a few floaty chunkies. One finger white head, minor amt of lacing. Nose- quite fruity, some iced tea notes, bready and yeast. Taste- floral hops, light citrus, then very bready with some yeast spice. A fresher example would have great balance of hop bitter and belgian sweet me thinks. Thick bodied with a vigorous carbonation- bit of booze heat as it slides down. Nice beer- would like to try again"
"D - it went down easy enough."
"The mouthfeel was medium in body and somewhat creamy."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, so I am obviously not the best judge of this one. It has a nice balance, but it doesn't hit your palate as excellently well blended as most Tripels do. The hops want to be in charge too bad, so it doesn't really let the beer do its thing. I don't know... I am enjoying the glass that I have, and will probably have another one since my palate is blasted because of all the hops, but this isn't one I would have very often at all."
"The beer had a medium to heavy body feel to it. The beer was very smooth yet felt a bit sticky but the carbonation appeared to be right. The beer's drinkability is perhaps slightly above average but the alcohol is noticeable once the beer warms and I noted a slight metallic taste. Overall there are other beers that represent the style better, but still solid and worth a go. I did note a fair amount of dust on the bottle, a one off 12oz bottle purchase (not a six pack or bomber), and so maybe that had something to do with it, so I may give it a go again at a later date."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, although there are better beers in the style, this is still a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"Bottle: Poured a dark beige color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of strong Belgian malt backbone with light sweet undertones. Taste is also a nice mix between some nice Belgian malt with balanced sweetness and some light pepper notes. Body is quite full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Enjoyable and well brewed without rewriting the rule book."
"This has become one of my new favorite triples. I think that people may be critiquing this beer a bit too harshly stating that it is not truly an IPA. Belgian IPA's can be deceiving to a person who is used to drinking American IPA's. The IBU's in an American IPA are through the roof and tend to be way more aggressive in their hoppy characteristics. This Belgian Triple IPA is a great brew in my opinion because it creates a wonderful balance between sweet citrus and bitter hops. There is not one aspect that completely overshadows the other with this beer and the complexity really hides the high alcohol content well."
"Pours a light golden copper color with a two-finger head with great retention and thick lacing. There is a great cap throughout. The nose is quite plain with a faint yeast character and a very minor amount of hops. Slightly sweet with a bit of peach. Taste is sweet and a bit grainy without any real hop or yeast character. Quite puzzling. A bit sweet and really not much else. Light caramel and stone fruits could be in there, if I try to throw out another few characteristics. Medium body and slightly cloying. Overall, not a big fan of this."
"The mouthfeel is round and there is a lingering breadyness to it. If you go into this beer expecting a Belgian IPA, you may be disappointed. But for a tripel, this will do just fine."
"Troubadour Magma pours a light orangish yellow in color with a large soapy head and quite a bit of brussels lace. Immediately greeted with a hoppy aroma, a bit earthy, along with some tropical fruits like mango, orange and pineapple. In the flavor, muted fruits and an even bitterness. Semi-sweet. Belgian style ale with some estery goodness. Alcohol presence is slim to none. Lighter body and feel with decent carbonation. Easy drinking, a nice take on the style."
"D: I'm still not quite sure what to make of the Belgian IPA style but this is definitely a solid offering. Great balance between hop presence and malt backbone here and the Belgian fruity and spicy character complements the bitterness well. Worth trying."
"Poured into a chalice which showed a bronze-orange colored, hazy beer with a moderate head that quickly faded to a thin film. A faint smell but some citrus, orange smell after some swirling--which seemed a bit odd to do for a beer. Good flavor highlighted by the orange, citrus flavor picked up from the smell, with a solid caramel malt base coming through. You can pick up the traditional Belgian yeast coming through as well. A light-to-medium bodied beer with good, but not overpowering carbonation. A very drinkable beer, though for the price, I'd probably choose a Belgian IPA with a stronger hop character. Still, very drinkable and enjoyable!"
"All in all, one of the best we drank during our beertasting on saturday. Will certainly buy some stock, perfect for tastings & for novice beer drinkers. A realm of tastes! A very good Belgian IPA, but don't buy it for the bitterness!"
"Drinkability is pretty good but this beer was rather underwhelming to me."
"Hazy medium orangish brown color. A very cidery looking beer. Thin white head, turns into nice white ring around glass. Very dark sweet buttery orange aroma. Some sweet breadiness in aroma. Smells thick. Mild to moderate carbonation. Very dense am complex flavor combo. Orangy breadiness. Very candied, almost the orange flavor of a tootsie pop. Deep orange peel taste in finish. Some alcohol on a swish before swallow. Smooth and slightly dry finish. Overall a pretty good beer, very fruity on the orange side."
"Well done, and not an easy style to pull off, Magma is a delicious concoction that should appeal to lovers of both this unique styles and IPAS alike. I haven't had anything from Troubadour in some time, and Magma is a keen reminder that I should seek out their wares more often."
"IPA? Not so much, tripel? Sure, I'd buy that. Beer is medium bodied and sweet at lead off, gives way to a blank midpalate with only minimal presence of hops and esters. A little breadiness, minimal bitterness at the back and a dry finish. Eh...this is one of the BIPAs that just doesn't quite float my IPA loving boat."
"This becomes a bit of a chore to drink after a while; I'm not crazy about the interplay between the hops and yeast. Too much astringency, not enough hop flavor. I'll pass on this one in the future."
"The beer had medium drinkability."
"D: An excellent and drinkable beer."
"Because of the bready malts (maybe stale bread) and waivering hop character, this beer might be beyond prime. Interested in trying fresh to see."
"D: I think I paid about $22 for a 4-pack of this beer. To me, the price was higher than the worth of the beer, but that is not to say that it is a bad beer. Lots of flavor, nice aroma and mouthfeel. The beer is very good, but not stellar, and not worth that price."
"D - I didn't like the beer enough to drink tons of it, perhaps I need more exposure to the style."
"D - It's a bit overhyped but it's not a bad beer by any stretch. Still, I'd rather have (fresh) Houblon Chouffe or Struise Elliot brew if I were in the mood for a Belgian IPA."
"This is a decent and drinkable ipa, if it wasn't for the soap this wold be excellent."
"D-For all the combating flavors this was a surprising beer which I found myself ordering a 2nd of. Not a session beer and two is probably enough before moving on."
"Excellent. I would recommend this to other hopheads that enjoy Belgian interpretations of our beloved hop bombs. I welcome our new belgian overlords with open hands."
"Overall impression: not my favorite style, but an excellent tripel IPA."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy and full with light carbonation. Â Very nice mouthfeel which ends in lingering dryness. Â Drinkable and enjoyable. Â This was much better than expected and I would try it again. Â Â "
"Had this on tap at City Tap House in Philadelphia. Poured a cloudy orange red with thick white head, great retention and lacing. Very complex nose, citrusy and fruity, sweet with some malt notes. Taste was very refreshing and fruity, orange/grapefruit hop bitterness with apricot in the finish. Very complex, surprisingly drinkable for the abv. Great beer."
"Three fingers of creamy orange to tan foam, airy and prone to dimpling, steady dissolve, average stickiness to the lacing. Super cloudy and opaque liquid, however, the red tinged pumpkin orange has serious glow, fills the glass with color, lots of tiny bubble beads visible as well. Sweet tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus explodes in the nose, adds juiciness to the apricot, peach, nectarine, mango fruit scents, brawny peppery component, the pine adds edginess, hard to distinguish clear malt scents but something is softening the harder edges here. Medium-bodied, heavily whipped up carbonation yet fine enough that it does not prevent the weight from getting things sinking into the palate. The pepper and crisp spice pairs up with herbal bite to set the tone early, forestalls the appearance of the tangerine, grapefruit citrus, no small feat. Drier fruit profile, more nectarine, pineapple, papaya than riper apricot or peach, tangy. More dead yeast cells than breadiness, offers a charcoal dustiness too. Near the end releases a swipe of maple syrup and molasses. High marks for drinkability given the ABV. Active, not hyperactive, mouth presence."
"Overall this is quite a nice beer, the alcohol is present and noticable, but not overpowering. Well done"
"Â  D-Â  This beer has some good hop and sweetness balance but they are both very soft.Â  I would say the triple IPA is very misleading, and it is a bit bland to drink.Â "
"Hard to think of this as a Beglian IPA, but it's definitely a delicious, easy to appreciate beer. Impressive..."
"This is a well balanced and very tasty beer. No one flavor dominates. and it hides the 9% abv well. I thought the mouthfeel would be a bit more chewy. The beer is a bit pricey, but I'm glad I bought a 4 pack since I still have 3 bottles left."
"This guy seemed a bit much for the guys next to me at the bar, so I just had to try it. Call me a glutton for punishment. It pours a somewhat hazy amber-straw topped by over a finger of white micro-foam. The nose is heavy on the grapefruit, pine, and toffee. Nothin' else...no room for anything else. The taste is a bit more varied, with plenty o' pine and grapefruit, a pumped-up bit o' toffee and caramel, red grapes, figs, brown sugar, sweet raisins, and honey. The body is a somewhat hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly gooey feel. Overall, a powerful nigh-triple IPA, easy to see how my bar-neighbors could be stunned by this."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"D - just a little disappointed here, has a few good things going for it but just kind of falls apart in the end. hurt by a slightly abrasive mouthfeel without enough to make up for it. a decent beer, just not worth the price you will likely pay to get it."
"Fantastic rendition of the Beglian IPA, some of the brewers get this style and some of them don't. Namingly most of the American versions which kill the experience with loads of American highly potent alpha acids with the Belgian yeast spiciness, this is a yin and yang that just doesn't work for me. This one appears a glowing slightly clouded orange color for me, with bright white peach tinted head. Rocky and thick effervescent head the true Belgian style lacing going on, intricate and layered perfectly with each sip from my Allagash chalice. Aromatics offer up lemon/lime/grapefruit citrus fruits with a really appealing grassiness going on, spicy edges from the yeast and sugary layers of candy coated hops from the tropical fruit mango to the simple syrup tones I'm getting. Caramel coated hops, wrapped in sugar. This is bitter but alcohol and malts stand up to European hop additions. The grapefruit, grassy/herbal, and tropical fruit mango/pineapple tones tend to explode on the palate and the bready spicy yeast blends perfectly amongst the hodgepodge of flavors going down. Mouthfeel is effevescent with carbonation smooth with occasional hop burps clearing out the sinuses this is a nice drinking beer definitely hides the 9% abv. Drinkability overall is incredible the type of beer I would love to have more often than not, conveniently it's right down the street at my local beer and wine shop."
"It tastes a ton like my BIPA, definitely some noble hops, I also had some Americans too but i don't taste it here. This is a unique recipe that should be tried by BIPA lovers."
"Overall, I feel this beer is trying to do too much in the style...it seems off track just a bit, and what could be a great beer is lost in translation."
"poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle. apparently this beer is somewhat rare but I had never even heard of it. It pours an amber color and has a ridiculous head. I am thinking it could use a long time to age before drinking. The only way to describe the smell is that it smells like beer, its kind of odd. Taste is incredibly complex: grapefruit and bubble gum. The alcohol is hidden. For being a belgian tripple IPA I cannot even tell the belgian yeasts from the hops it all blend together."
"D - This drinks nicely but needs a larger level of hop for it's ""Tripel"" name on the front. It still goes down well regardless, Magma is a nice beer overall with serious potential (from a fresher bottle)."
"Iam sometimes leary about beers of this style,Iam usually let down by to much Belgian yeastiness,this version is done nicely.Poured into a stemmed glass a deep burnt orange infused golden with a clingy one finger white head that left two full rings of lace as it settled slowly.Mainly tropical fruit in the nose along with some caramel malt,just some slight spice from the yeast.Pretty sweet on the palate with some caramel malt flavors up front,hop flavors are more of a tropical and overripe fruit variety,the alcohol is pretty well hidden.Not in your face hops but there is a hefty dose of the vine,not bad."
"Drinkability: Alcohol provides a slight warming in the stomach, but the flavor is smooth and this is extremely drinkable. Hopefully it becomes more regularly available here."
"D - Enjoyable example of this growing style. Nicely done."
"The beer was launched this year and has already scooped a number of prizes and deservedly so. It describes itself as a triple IPA but is surely one of the finest of the growing array of IPA-ish beers that are emerging in Belgium. Well done I say."
