"Beer had big flavors but they were not balanced. Sweet fruit taste clashed rather than enhance. Also, somehow even with the big flavor, the alcohol was noticeable. This one was bottled in 2011, so maybe the age detracted."
""
"Toffee sweetness, confectioners sugar, pear, green apple, and clove dominate the aroma. Great ester profile. There's a hint of must. Flavor reveals tart crabapple at the base, with notes of peach leading into a slightly sweet, toasted malt backbone. The finish is peppery and a touch bitter.  Perfumey esters add complexity. Alcohol surfaces in the aftertaste. That tart character dominates a bit more than I'd prefer, and adding in the booze makes it almost have an acetone quality."

"OVERALL: A very good beer. Lots of good aromas and flavors, and definitely showcases the spicy nature of Belgian yeast, which is a hallmark of this style. I would have liked to see more hop flavor perhaps as opposed to the hops simply providing bitterness, but the spicy and estery qualities of the yeast made this an enjoyable drink. Though the fuller feel is definitely not Belgian in character, I’m a fan and appreciated the creamy fullness here. Definitely a quality brew that’s well worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again dad!"

"The aftertaste lingers bitter on the tongue. Overall this is a appropriately big brew that works. I was hoping for a more delicate take on the style but this is brutal."

"Overall: Perhaps this beer was better when fresh as the hops could have balanced out the other flavors; at this point, however, it is unbalanced and cloying; true Belgians (even hoppy ones) typically have more staying power"
"Overall, a decent beer. Not a huge fan of Smuttynose Big Beer Series, but they certainly captured the essence of Belgian Strong Golden Ale."

"This pours a cloudy very light copper color with a medium head and average retention. Lacing is pretty good. The smell is unfortunately overpowered by alcohol, although when straining to see past the alcohol I find some nice fruit, including cherry and berry, and malt tastes, and it's clear there's some yeast being used here. The taste suffers from a lack of balance, with the alcohol flavor out of control. The yeast seems to offer some nice flavors, but the label on the beer says that it is ""Impregnated with loads of hop character", and yet I find very, very little hop character here at all. By the way, don't drink this beer when pregnant or when looking for a balanced and flavorful beer. Anyway, it's OK--it's not well thought out, like the Gravitation beer, and I wish I hadn't bought such a large bottle of it. The mouthfeel is drying but spot on as far as thickness, but overall it's a beer I would try again as it needs to be reconstructed."

"An interesting brew that will wake up the taste buds while it puts the tongue to sleep. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in North Park. Smuttynose has suddenly started showing up in San Diego."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and citrus-like hop aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."

"Overall a really great beer. Definitely true to Belgian IPA-style. Complex and highly drinkable. Lots of sweet fruit flavor with just the right amount of hops to prevent this from getting too fruity. Very nicely done"

"Wow, what a find! Homunuculus is a complex Belgian that gives you a slap in the face, then a big kiss! The flavor is a blend of malt, chocolate and citrus notes with a very smooth overall mouthfeel. Lingering and pleasant aftertaste. High ABV makes this a beer that demands your attention. Fun to drink and a kick-ass beer!"
""
"O: Quite good. Nice hoppy with an interesting banana bread malt backbone. Very well balanced and unusual flavor combinations."
""
""
"Overall: Smuttynose simply refuses to make a sub-par beer. This is another very good brew from them, and I'll likely try it again in the future."
"I am not a huge fan of high ABV beers. This is acceptable. Not too strong, but still strong. I bought a bottle of this mainly for the name and didn't think to read too much into it. Yes, my own fault, I was in a hurry before work. I could have one of these every once and a while and while it is still quite tasty, I enjoy having a few beers, and by the feel of this so far, this would be a beer I could have one over a good deal of time. Delicious as a beer, but for my drinking preferences, I would like it a little weaker. Still a damn good brew. Sorry if this was a bad review. It was my first full out review and now that I read this, it was more about my preference to drink than the beer itself. I will have to re-do this again."

"O: For such a big beer, this is quite drinkable, and it’s not just the texture I’m talking about – the taste of this beer is balanced, creating a bold yet inoffensive blend of flavors. Enjoyable, overall, and that’s all that really matters in the end."
""
""
""
""
"O: initially I liked this beer, even if a little malty for me. But as I analyzed it more, it lost some of its luster."
""
""
""
""
"O-The only big knock on the beer is that is doesn't need all the alcohol. Toning it down and letting some more hop character through would improve it greatly."
""
""
""
"overall not your normal IPA, but that's ok. its good all the same. one is enough though."
"This is an interesting complex beer that is actually quite big for the style. A really big La Chouffe or Houblon if that helps describe this beer."

"This beer poured a nice golden color but with less head than I expected from a Belgian-style brew because these brews (Dubbels, Tripels, etc.) generally have a very thick head. No matter. Smelled like a Belgian beer - with a very fruity, sweet aroma. Tasted exactly like I expected. Really a very good beer. I was very impressed with this one. If I didn't know it came from Smuttynose, I would have guessed that some order of trappist monks had brewed it somewhere in Europe."

"Chose for a very stressful day. I have a hefty interview this evening. I needed to unwind in between, poured off 8oz from a bomber to keep me sane. i'll finish the rest later. Golden spice. I can taste candy and toffee. What a nice bubbly mouthfeel as well. Certainly packs a punch at 9.37% but even at room temperature right out of the conditioning closet, only on the last part of the finish does the warming quality of the booze mellow into the mix."
""
""
"Overall, the thing we liked best about this beer was how well it represented the style. This was noticed at just about every turn throughout the tasting. The aroma possesses every required component for the style, but remains on the mild side, even with warmth. The flavoring, on the other hand, gave juiciness and depth through its Belgian base, while giving nice balancing sweetness and pucker of the hop bill. The flavoring gives equally to the experience, and this beer fits well among the other delicious beers in the Smuttynose “BIG BEER” series."
""
"This is a wonderful Belgian-style IPA that rivals the likes of Flying Dog Raging Bitch and Stone Brewing Company's Cali-Belgique. But the brewer's notes hop that it falls in the conversation of Achouffe. For that to happen, the beer has to better explore its more complex, earthy, and rustic roots. But its a fantastic beer even with its simplified taste and texture."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent BIPA. It's incredibly fruity and juicy. The alcohol is ever present but it doesn't take away from the drinkability. The yeast is present but seems to work well with the intense, complex fruitiness. This is worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"A lovely surprise. A beer that's really easy to get along with. Recommended."
""
""
"OVERALL: A tasty Belgian style ale with a generous addition of bright American hops. Brewed in homage to Brasserie D' achouffe, this is a fine ale that belongs in company with some of the giants of the style. A good choice for the big beer series."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice beer, even though it may take a bit of adjusting to. I can't remember what I paid for it, but I imagine it compares well with other big beers or true Belgians in terms of value. I would definitely buy it and session it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this take on a Belgian-style IPA. Bitterness is stronger and more omnipresent than other examples of the style, which adds a nice dimension to the whole experience. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, pretty nice, I enjoyed this beer. From start to finish the hop profile is pretty weak, and this comes off more as a Tripel or maybe Belgium Strong Pale than a Belgium IPA. Of course at this point this beer is months old, so it probably had a stronger hop profile early on. Im not complaining though, I really dig a spicy Tripel-esque beer."
""
""
""
"O- Not a home run of a beer, but good nonetheless."
""
"Pours a hazy gold with deep amber accents. Two and a half finger fluffy bright white head Belgian yeast, spices, some mild funk, and herbal and grassy hops on the nose. Fruit notes, grassy, herbal hops, phenol alcohol, bready yeasty esters, white pepper and spice. Finishes fairly dry with yeasty, mild alcohol and spice. Fairly creamy mouthfeel with lively carbonation, light bodied. A very well done beer that will please anyone who appreciates Belgian-style beers."
""
"The taste compliments the aroma with its citrus zing, light pale malt character, yeasty note, clove, and a semi-lingering finish that in many respects reminds me of a Tripel. Easier to drink than I expected."
""
""
"O - I would definitely have this again and think it is worth purchasing especially at it's price for a belgian style and thought it was a bit above average and the 9.37 ABV is not noticeable in taste but only within the good vibes, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this should be categorized as a hoppy BSPA rather than a Belgian IPA, but that might be a bit subjective. A good brew no less, but I would like to see the fruitiness shine a bit more and maybe just tone the hops down a bit (but not a lot). That being said, I'm pretty sure this is only the 3rd time Smutty has brewed this, so hats off to them"
""
"Overall kind of fruity, kind of vegital (lager like taste), yet 100% hoppy this beer is good and quite unique. Worth trying if paying 5 bucks a bomber."

"Overall (4.0): I really, really enjoy this beer. I like these hopped-up BSPA / tripel-ish hybrid beers. Take away the over-hopped-ness of this beer, and the Chouffe inspiration is not hard to see at all (see the yeasty-wheaty BSPA notes above). I was expecting the hops to be more blatantly American-inspired, but what they’ve done here is very pleasing, regardless. More evidence for my theory that the BSPA / tripel-ish Belgian IPAs are the best examples of the style!"
""
"This beer teeters between a triple and an ipa and what a fun ride. The banana notes and malty bread of a triple are upfront then the palate is hammered by bitter citrus ipa notes and a lively carbonation sting. This blows raging bitch out of the water. A very exciting and tasty beer."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is lively in the feel but lots of strange yeast aspects clash with the bitternesss that keeps this from being that enjoyable. I dont know what it is about belgian ipas but something always seems to go strange with them."
""
""
""
""

""
"O: This is a beer with some good attributes, but is too uneven to really be wholly successful."
""
""
""
"O- I absolutely loved smutty's delivery for a Belgian ipa. So much going on with the tropical properties trying to counter the Belgian spiced onslaught. Let me just say this is great fresh!!"
""
"The taste is far more balanced. Moderately sweet toasted malt at the start and even in the swallow. Yet, the aftertaste has a healthy contribution of peppery and citrusy hop. The alcohol is almost undetectable. Shocking! Full bodied and highly carbonated make for a great combination."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, opaque copper-gold coloring with a filmy ring around the surface. Aromas of funky fruit and spice typical of Belgian yeast, with pineapple and melon blending with coriander and lemon zest. Smells smooth and tasty. Flavors are smooth and rich, with a slightly sour undertone that uplifts the malty backbone of fruit sweetness. Hops are light, and used as an accent of pepper spice and a slight bitterness to the palate. Very tasty, and the beer has a solid, rich mouthfeel. The aftertaste is rich, with the tropical fruit sweetness becoming more syrupy, with a sutble roasting. Clean, smooth finish with a subtle dryness at the very end. Solid brew."
""
""
"Overall a nice slow sipper with enough flavor to satisfy. I may buy one of these fresh and compare it. I'll bet the hops profile makes it more interesting than my year or older bottle that I just reviewed."
""
""
""
"D: Goes down slow - not one to try to drink quickly for a few reasons: you'd be very drunk very fast, you'd be overpowered by sweetness, and you'd feel extremely full. This one is better for sipping by the fire (or in the hot tub). Not something I would have with most foods (except maybe some cheese and crackers/bread)."
""
""
"Very tasty. If they keep this is a yearly, seasonal release beer, I can see it get very popular"
""
"Overall is pretty good. It drinks dangerously easy for such a big beer. Clean malt and crisp hops make it almost quaffable."
"O: Overall I like the malt and Belgian character, but the hops seem to fight it a little. The mouthfeel seems a touch of. All and all I like it, but I think it could be smoothed out a bit."
""
""
"Served from growler into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured a hazy red-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, banana, apple, spices, floral, floral hop, earth, and earthy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, fruit, spices, earth, earthy hop, sweet alcohol, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this was very complex and had a lot going on. Unfortunately it might have had a little too much going on with not a lot of balance. The flavor however wasn’t as complex, but still had a pretty good bit going on. I just didn’t flow very well and the alcohol presence really took a lot of the enjoyment out of it for me. This could be a great brew if it were a little more balanced. Worth trying if you get the chance, but that’s about it."
""
"D: Way more a BGS than a BIPA. Mislabeled on the BA I’d say. This one walks a line between pleasant & aggressive. Starts off with sweetness, fruity & floral, warm & rich doughy aromatic & sweet malts – kittens and rainbows and everything nice. Then in comes the bitterness, earthy/yeasty/funk, herbal/resiny/spicy/peppery/phenolic high octane mix. Careful - this one will quietly & calmly kick your ass. It is one fairly pleasant and very potent beast."
""
""
"Overall, I do not know what to think of this Ale. The Belgium characteristics are all there. Just tone down the sweetness a little bit."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is a little solventy, strong sweet and little bitter. The yeast is winning in this beer. I drank the 22 ounces but it was a little dry, not bitter enough and the hops were a little grassy. It is an OK Belgian IPA but not a repeat for me."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange w/ minimal everlasting head and lace patches. Strong spicy and citric hop aroma, as well just a good aroma of orange. Getting some solid wheat/yeast as well as touches of sugar and funk. Light bodied but fuller mouthfeel from the yeast...yes, there is an orange citric vibe but I get a real crisp, hoppy beer that has a sour/funky tropical edge. I'm alos getting a spicy, bready beer that somehow maintains this light body and fruit taste (along with candi sugar and caramel sweetness) yet has a somewhat ""hot"" finish - the ABV kicks in out of nowhere and just packs an almost medicinal, boozy finish at the last second. This is a great beer, I love the mix of hops and citric twang against this sturdy sweet malt base and then quite frankly a high ABV that can get you in trouble. Not as complex as a Belgain triple but doesn't mean it's a great beer (and as a sidenote: here in VA it's $6 - a similiar beer - Allagash Hugh Malone which was stacked right next to it is $14 - in this economy a $6 bomber that can deliver the goods is mighty nice)."
""
""
""
""
"Recent bottle. A lot is going on in this. Pours unfiltered look, milky orange golden with a small retained head. Somewhat sweet slightly funky aroma. Easy mouthfeel, yeasty sweet with a hop bitter finish. A little orange juice. Brett aftertaste. Understated carbonation, aided drinkability.IBu 75 a little surprising."
"Not bad, but fairly average. Really no hops to speak of for any sort of IPA. Pretty much an average Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Not something I am going to revisit."
""
"22 ounce bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head which sticks around for a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is fruity (but also light), the brew smells like pears, apples, white grapes, bananas, citrus, and a bit of peppery spice. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and a slight herbal/medicinal flavor noticeable. Unfortunately, I think this brew starts to taste worse and worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I didn't care for this brew much at all, mainly because I didn't like the taste of it. I didn't think it was awful, but I didn't think it was exactly good, either. I usually like Smuttynose beers, but this one wasn't for me."
""
"Overall, this is good Belgian fare, presenting many of the common flavors of the style, but ramped up in typical Smuttynose Big Beer style to not-normally-seen levels. Even with these larger flavors, the beer manages to be fairly well balanced on the tongue, with only a fairly strong alcoholic kick (the result of the 9.9% ABV) marring what are otherwise great flavors. Worth trying."
""
"o) Enjoyed it. Big, winey, malty beer. I guess I didn't think of belgian golden ales as being this big."
""
"O: Smuttynose nails this one. Really hard for one across the pond to duplicate a Belgian style beer, but they pull it off with great yeast support and a Belgian graininess that is like silty liquid bread and makes this distinguishable. Very good enjoyment. Rare to experience a perfect balance of malt and yeast that is so forefront and showcased so strongly together however the supposed main focus of hops seem to take a back seat here. Warming alcohol, a pint is plenty, a big drinking experience."
"“The Gnome” has been reborn in this Big Beer Series. Golden in color with a touch of haze and large carbonation bub- bles that yield a creamy white head. Soft, powdery funk in the nose. Musty orchard, light phenols, gum, pepper, sweet herbal and spicy notes. Fairly light bodied. Prickly carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel, as the beer warms on the palate. Tamed alcohol heat and spice. Quite malty and sweet. Bready, candied fruit, banana, some lemon, white pepper and lingering bubblegum. A bit rough around the edges, but overall a very complex and solid offering that offers a lot to discerning palates and fans of Belgian-inspired ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Homunculus has lots of hop flavor, but it does not blend the alcohol well. The high presence of the alcohol in the flavor gets in the way of the better elements of this beer."
""
"Like it? It's OK"
"this is a really good belgian IPA. There is a touch of alcohol on the finish. Even with the slight bit of heat, this was really good"
""
"Overall: Strong beer, robust spices with a rich malt content that is somewhat overpowered by spices and hops."
"Pleasantly frothy head of about a half finger, eggshell white, not much retention but the lacing has a good deal of stickiness. Remarkably clean and transparent liquid, shows a semi-metallic orange coloration, only a few random bubbles meandering about within. The nose has a slight grainy to rye quality, boozy too, flowers, vanilla bean, spiced orange peel, more raw pie dough than yeast, maple syrup, peach and apricot then pineapple fruit scents, that booziness helps it last. Full-bodied, the carbonation is present throughout but not sufficient to impact the general creamy mouthfeel, just brings a percolation under the surface. Richer and close to poached feel in the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, guava fruit. This aided by juicy pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus notes. Crusty pie flakes and dough, cinnamon and nutmeg, no real “sharp” spiciness, maybe a pinch of pepper. Light pine to green herbal matter nuances but not incredibly hoppy, too heavy and sappy to pierce the palate. Vividly flavorful, not that complex, the booziness present in the mouth too. Quite fun to drink yet hard to imagine drinking a lot of it."
""
"Nothing on the label spells out the alcohol quotient, but it feels big. And it dwarfs the other flavors. Not as balanced as I'd like, not something I'd really reach for again and again."
""
""
""
"Notes: Another take at imperializing a Belgian IPA or hopping a Tripple, or… Dunno, this with time may deserve a different style. In any case this next notch of the takes on Belgian IPA sits for me very far from the average range of a Belgian IPA and while drinkable it is not particularly enticing… Dunno, in a similar line with Terrapin´s Monks Revenge, or Clown Shoe´s Muffin Top for instance."
"O - I'd say this Belgian IPA lends its hand towards the Belgian side...the hops were brief with the Belgian spices and yeast coming through pretty strong...the alcohol really comes out on the palate"
"O: Great IPA with a belgian twist. Loved it. like this take more than other Belgian IPAs, which I feel often come across as BPAs with extra hops."
"I wasn’t a big fan in the end. Just didn’t work for me."

"I guess I was expecting something big from their Big Beer Series. There's just an overall lack of everything. Yeast and hops are there, but um not really."
"D/O: This beer is well-rounded and successful in its representation of a Belgian-style strong golden ale. Those who find the strong pales brewed in Belgium a bit understated in flavor will appreciate the heavy layers of fruit and transformed malt. It is nearly on the level of an abbey tripel, although its restraint (or lack thereof) is purely American."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a fairly thick cream-white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Aroma has a fruity core of banana and apple with malty and butterscotch tones. Strong flavor is mainly fruity, again apple and banana, with a malty note, a hint of butterscotch, and a bitter metallic tang that gives it quite a punch. This beer is not for the faint of heart! Above average body has a lively, sassy, fizzy texture that leaves a fruity, tangy, ragged and somewhat metallic finish."
"Overall: It's not my favorite beer but for the style that it is suppose to be, I find it a bit sub-par. It's decent, good maybe, but it leaves something to be desired."
"It's a well rounded belgian; tasty, but not a lot too it."
"Cheers."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip, 2011 release. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a dense 1 finger white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some nice thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass as well. Aromas of lemon, grass, pepper. spices, banana, and clove. Some nice and fairly strong aromas. Taste of big banana, clove, pepper, spices, lemon, and breadiness. A bit of a yeasty tang in the back. Decent amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pepper, spices, citrus, and clove. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Great drinkability for being over 9%. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden, nothing but a small warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and well balanced hoppy Belgian golden ale. I would get this again."
"The taste was the runner up here. It felt amazing and looked and smelled good. The taste just was not up to the same standard. Well worth trying for the texture alone."
"O - Good beer. Lots of flavor layers here. Good offering from Smutty with the big beer series. Ill be looking out for more from the big beer series."
"O: Good for the style"
"O: Although the alcohol is relatively well masked from the taste, this beer definitely tastes like it packs some punch and is one that needs to be slowly sipped."
"If I hadn't known this was a Belgian IPA I would have thought it was just a fairly hoppy tripel; the sweetness definitely outweighs the hop character. Still very nice, though."
"Overall, a delicious brew that I would love to have more of; it feels like the perfect Spring-time brew, when the weather is naught but chilly rain and the glorious smell that comes with."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time."
"Overall: a very enjoyable slow sipping beer. The sweetness and fruitiness is bold and creates an interesting beer."
"Bomber. Wine/goblet glass. Clear honey orange. Looks crisp. Shitload of lacing. Clinging onto the glass for its life. Funky belgian yeast, sweet malts, piney spicy earthy hops. You taste delicious you belgian inspired son bitch! I like you alot, I may even purchase your services again. Candy sweet, hop punch in the back. Malty slightly chewy mouth, full body for an IPA (7/10). Smooth, bittered just right, funky, hoppy, sweet. Cheers to Belgian IPA's!"
"O - This is a very interesting beer and worth a try. I guess this has been around for a few years but yet it's the first time I've seen it on the shelves. I wish I would have purchased more than one bottle!"
"Overall: This beer is not at all a Belgian IPA, but I don't think it was intended to be by the brewer. It tastes more like a hoppy tripel than a Belgian pale ale. Its pretty good."
"This IS a Big Beer. impressive. It's interesting, and quite tasty, on the whole. I had no idea that it was as strong as it was, which is an impressive feat. tasty, interesting, easy drinking, and all in all, pretty good!"
"Bottle says ""share some responsibly with your gnomies."" So I did."
"O- This beer has a great yeast character with a nice crisp hop finish that balances the flavor and aroma. The dry finish and slight sweetness upfront really makes this beer easy to drink."
"Well done."
"This is a hoppy little golden ale with heavy booze that builds with time. This isn't setting any bars here, nothing special."
"Homunculus is a pretty good release from Smuttynose. I’m not sure I like the Belgian IPA classification. It reminds more of a Tripel. Having said that, it is good stuff. The hops add an interesting jolt to the flavor and really make it interesting. If you’re into Belgian ales with a twist of hops, grab a bomber."
"The CPJ"
"Poured into a large tulip glass a slight hazed medium golden with a nice blooming white crown that left globs of lace as it settled ever so slowly.Spiced phenols and overripe citrus fruit mainly in the nose,the phenols are the main component and that kinda turned me off a little.Medicenel and tropical citrus fruit hop flavors with spicy phenols in the background.while the phenolic flavors are held in check somewhat,the beer lacks a whole lot of complexity in my mind."
"Very enjoyable and soild Smuttynose stuff!"
"Pretty smooth, a heavy Belgian yeast presence with lots of clove and pepper phenols. Sweet and syrupy feel, with little to no bitterness. IPA? Not really. Sweet cantaloupe and more clove. Feels pretty heavy, not all that easy to finish a bomber. Honestly not one of Smuttynose's better BIG Beers."
"O: could stand to be a bit drier, and lighter on the palate but flavor wise it good."
"I still enjoyed this beer, but would have loved it more if the phenols had been better controlled."
"O - I liked but didn't love this brew. This doesn't have the light, subtle and carbonated feel of Orval. It's got more tropical, citrus and spice. It sure disguises the alcohol well. Worth trying for sure."
"A little bit of a letdown. But everything else Smutty does is right."
"Pours a burnished golden with a decent head that eventually fades away to nothing. Good clarity. The beer has a sweet Belgian nose with some spicy herbal hops on the finish. Nice. The taste, in a sense, is similar to the aroma. The problem is that things are a bit out of balance here. The sweetness is mostly lost, and there is a slightly acrid bitterness, and the hops seem a bit of a mismatch here. I'm craving a fruity note or some sweetness- instead I get entirely too much dry herbalness, a bitterness that seems a bit too astringent, and a bit of acrid sourness. Not my favorite beer from this quite good brewery."
"its good. alcohol is hidden until well after the swallow where a sight heat is noticed. a bit too sugary sweet for my liking, and its not a belgian IPA, i don't think. but, overall its a good beer."
"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy deep blonde color ale with a nice big foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of sweet Belgian malt with some dry hops. Taste is unfortunately overwhelmed with sweet Belgian malt with some dry hops though somewhat hard to discern considering the sweetness level. Some fruity ester was discernable but again overshadowed by sweetness. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad but too much sugar upfront in that one."
"Overall: Perhaps more sweeter and candyish than needed for a Belgian IPA. Instead of IPA meets Tripel, it's a slightly-more-hoppy tripel. Maybe it's just me. On a sidenote, I'm most letdown by the puerile, lowbrow label, especially when held against their previously more classier labels."
"Notes: The alcohol taste builds in intensity as the beer warms, and that vodka-like spirit taste starts to come through. A solid beer despite this little flaw."
"Normally, I like tha transition in taste from cold to warming temperatures, but I didn't really like the taste of this at all when it was cold. If I try this again, I'll definately let it warm before I sample it. It was quite good in the end."
"O - a good, complex, and well-crafted beer; a little rough in spots, and a little hot, but quite good"
"Cheers!"
"Oh my...I'm gonna need some alone-time with Homunculus. Chalk another one up to the usually AMAZING Big Beer Series. Go Smutty!"
"O: A really intriguing beer from Smuttynose. IT starts like Duvel but finishes like a very sweet Gnomegang or LaChouffe. I would like to see them idle back the malt somewhat to make this a little more palatable with less sweetness and lower ABV. Overall though, a nice effort and worth giving a run or two."
"O: A solid beer. Nice combination of a Belgian beer and an IPA. The flavors and aroma are predominantly Belgian, but the strong hop finish sets it apart. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Overall a very enjoyable member of the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. As with most if not all of their beers I am pleased with this Belgian IPA and recommend it!"
"O: Overall, a decent beer with a hilarious label design. Unfortunately it just doesn't seem to meld the Belgian with the IPA aspects, with the Belgian part dominating the nose and the hops dominating the palate. Still, it's far from bad."
"O - A nice Belgian beer with some good flavors. Not sure how much the style here describes the beer. It feels more like a complete ale with hops and malt neck and neck, not an IPA with hops dominating. The yeast did some nice things to this beer, and for its fairly cheap price, would get again."
"A good Belgian IPA but not authentic. The hop profile is too assertive and the yeast is too powedery. Its a well made American BIPA but it lacks the Belgian touch."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, prickly and lingering on the tongue. A pretty solid beer, although not something I'd rush out and buy. Also - this really felt more like a strong golden ale rather than a Belgian IPA."
"o: A nice, inoffensive beer. Fairly drinkable for its abv. Alcohol does start to become prominent especially as it warms. Not something I would seek out again but decent enough. I'd likely stick with other offerings from Smuttynose however."
"The mouthfeel is good enough, it's got a medium body but feels just a bit ""slicker"" than it should. A bit more carbonation would help it out. The drinkability is quite good, the ABV is completely hidden. Overall a good Belgian IPA, and far better than the style usually is. For the six bucks a bomber that these Smuttys command, it's surely worth it."
"Pours a hazy amber with one finger of white foam, settles to a thin ring, leaves sticky streaks of lace behind. Smell: grassy, grainy, hopping is spicy with a little citrus rind, pear, and unripe banana. Taste: grainy, big dose of spicy hops, lots of pale malt sweetness that's cut quite well by a hit of alcohol. Pear and red delicious apple, note of clove and dried citrus rind. Delicious. The label is pretty great too."
"Pours a golden color w/ an average head. Decent carbonation and lacing. Smell is that of citrus fruit, pepper, and spices. Taste is similar to the nose profile. Big malt w/ underlying hoppy taste. Very dry finish on this beer. Somewhat creamy, but thin and not very complex for the style. This is not the best beer I've had from the brewery, but it's a solid beer. Recommended, but you can find better examples for the style."
" Very bold flavor's make this a big beer for sure, major complexity, maybe too big."
"Poured into my 13oz tulip glass. Pours a cloudy orange yellow, with a inch of sticky white head. Fruity banana, orange, and some clove. Some pine into the background. Taste is the same, but the hoppy pineyness steps out of the shadows and steals the show, nice. Equal IPA and belgian, what I love. Plenty of body & carbonation in this gem. Easy to drink at almost 10 abv. Hopheads belgian-ipa for sure!"
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"I really enjoy the Belgian Golden style and La Chouffe and Duvel and some of my favorite beers. This beer is listed as a Golden Ale on the bottle and Belgian IPA on BA. To me it seems more like a fruity tripel. Tropical fruit seems to predominate in both in the aroma and taste. The flavors are very rich and the mouthfeel is thick and a bit sticky. General I like the beers that are drier and spicier with a little less on the tropical fruit. The alcohol and sweetness comes through more than I would like."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, much more so than expected but I think it suits this beer well. Overall, I have a tough time with Beligan IPAs. I like hops and I like Belgian yeast character but I'm not so sure I like them together. That being said, for what it is, Homonculus is a fine example of what a Belgian IPA should be. Hoppy and yeasty with just enough malt to keep it all in line."
"Clear gold with an off-white cap of fine and soapy bubbles. Good head retention with some streaky lacing. Grassy, slightly citrusy, aroma with notes of grain and fruit, not-quite-clove spiciness, and bread. More of the same in the flavour, but with more honey-like sweetness and moderate, grassy/orange peel bitterness and spice that lingered in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture, mild alcohol warmth/flavour and dryness. Pretty solid overall and rather enjoyable."
"22oz. bottle served in my Spiegelau tulip. Bottle conditioned in 2011 notched on the label. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a hazy clarity and a half inch frothy, bright white head that quickly disperses towards the edges leaving a creamy band around the edges and a soapy skim across the surface. Light fruity esters initially hit the nose (melon fruits); however, there is also a suggestion of candi sugar and a slightly herbal/medicinal quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - all the aromas present in the nose nicely coalesce. Fruit and candi sugar is a bit more prominent and there's a light herbal bitterness that comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation and a slightly oily texture. All and all, I really dig this brew - not at all what I would expect from a Belgian IPA (less hoppy and more fruity); more of a Belgian Strong Pale ale in the Duvel family in my opinion. The alcohol on this is dangerously well-hidden - I didn't realize it was 9.90% until a slight buzz ensued. The flavors also seem to be much more prominent as the brew warms. This is one of the best additions to Smutty's line-up in years in my humble opinion."
"Taste is semi sweet with a tart hoppy finish, but again the fruity esters dominate with hints of apple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tight small bubbles of carbonation. I really enjoy the strong yeasty fruity scent and taste, but it may be overdone for some."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty decent beer, but the estery flavors seem to dominate a little too much for me. It's still pretty good, but the hops and other flavors could have shined a bit more."
"A decent example of the style. It doesn't hit ALL of the right notes but it's still worth a try, especially if you're a fan of the other Smuttynose Big Beers."
"O: I still consider Houblon Chouffe to be the pinnacle here, but this one was pretty good... especially for the low price!"
"O - There is good drinkability here. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. It goes down smooth and has a nice big bold flavor. I really enjoyed this one, and it is probably one of my favorite belgian style IPAs so far. I recommend trying it."
"Eh, was expecting better. Not very good. Change the hops! Or something. Leans too much on the malty side for me."
"This Belgian brew, formerly 'The Gnome', pours a deep golden color. Strong carbonation, but settles quickly. Minimal head...a ring with a thin head covering the surface of the beer. Decent lacing. Strongly phenolic- in a great way. Is this La Chouffe? Alcohol is seriously hidden. Medium body, and pretty highly carbonated. Overall, a tasty Belgian from Smutty."
"A little on the crisp side. Refreshing. A very nice Belgian IPA."
"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head. Hazy raw sienna yellow in color. Mild malt smell as well as a little dried fruit. Medium rich and malty body, a little hint of dried fruit, banana, and spice. Better than many American-clamed Belgian styles but still not quite up to actual Belgian strength. Fairly long bitter finish. Cool people-sperms on the label."
"bunch of dude sperms on the front nice touch. comes out golden. thin white head sits atop keeps itself pretty well. good lacing. nose is lemon yeast clove pepper and bread. complex and inviting. taste is big clove yeast bread malts and sweet malts round out with lemon and pepper. great dry strong hop finish on this with moderate carbonation. this is one damn fine belgian ipa. go get some."
"The alcohol is there, but really well disguised behind a sweet body. Overall a pretty nice BIPA, but not really blowing me away in any regard."
"Overall, this is a good one. They balanced it great, they got the flavor just right. And the label is hilarious. Some Belgian IPAs are a bitter hop death bombs. This is so drinkable that you'd want to session a 9.9% beer. Oh, you have to try this."
"o - Overall a pretty good Belgian style beer that is heavy on the spices. Nice bananas in the taste as well. Would give it another shot."
"Overall, an interesting take on a Beglian IPA. The hops really don't provide an citrus or fruit here though, just unpleasant bitterness. The Belgian beer behind the hops is not bad, but there is just no harmony here. Not something I am likely to buy again. One of the only Smuttynose Big Beers I was dissappointed in."
"Not impressed at all. It's like the yeast gave up the ghost. A syrupy mess of a Belgian tripel I suppose. (Reminds me of that first bottled batch of Gravitation where the yeast died before reaching the intended alcohol level.) Label is disturbing, beer is flat and viscous. I usually love the Smutty Big Beers, but this is headed for the drain. Sorry folks."
"Not sure I'd say this is a Belgian IPA, especially since I think it needs to have a bit of age on it to mellow out. I'd give this 6 months in the cellar and it'll be for the better."
"O-I just didn't care for this interpretation of a Belgian IPA. The bitterness dominated to the point of drowning out the other flavors."
"Overall pretty bleh, probably the only Smuttynose beer I've not enjoyed at all. It just wasn't done right, phenolic, plastic, band-aid, a bit estery, boozy, the hops didn't come through well either."
"22oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a hazy/murky yellow-amber body with virtually no head to speak of. Smells fruity and spicy, with orange, apple and pithy notes. Fruity for sure, with orange, peach, apple, pineapple, notes. Low in carbonation, medium in body. A little more carbonation would help this a bit (maybe I got a bad bottle?) but apart from that, this beer is truly awesome. Tastes like nothing else I've tried."
"Pours a deep golden color that borders on amber, good sized fluffy white head sticks much lace. Smells of lemon and pepper with a spicy earthy twist. Citric and spicy with a herbal earthy bitterness. Taste is sweet fruity malt up front earthy bitterness comes in then a spicy yeasty flavor. Finishes sweet and fruity with a hint of warming alcohol. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation, sweet sticky mouthfeel. I like this beer. Great tasting Belgian style brew."
"Overall, this beer does a very nice job of hiding it's substantial alcoholic constitution: One is left with a consistently pleasant and fruity smell and taste in conjunction with a hospitable mouthfeel in the process of getting markedly crunked."
"Cheers"
"Overall easy to drink, especially for 9%, but the sweetness is too overwhelming for me"
"The feel is a bit full for me tastes. Even a little sticky. Nice soft carbonation. Overall this is prety much no thrilss. This one is enjoyable but I'd take a lot of Smuttynose beers over this one."
"3.5/35/35/35/35"
"(3.5/5)"
"Mouthfeel is crisply carbonated, sticky, moderate to full bodied."
"had this on tap at Andy's Corner Bar (twice), pours a rich golden hazy color with a thin off white head, it smelled of grape fruits, semi bitter hops but overall tangy fruits. taste is of nothing i have even had before as there is a lot going on here, very complex, there is lots of citrousy notes along with some pleasant hops and the taste differs slightly as it warms up, this one is very different, its unlike any other belgian ipa i have drank before, the mouthfeel is very nice with a slight bite on it as you sometimes get from eating grape fruits, this is for me is pretty drinkable, if you can find it drink it!"
"A nice, interesting American interpretation of the style. A good sipper with a great America meets Belgium aroma."
"Good stuff Smutty! Look forward to more short batch beers."
"An extremely unusual and impressive beer from Smuttynose. I've had good beers from Smuttynose in the past, but never anything like this."
"Pours nicely. No head. Mild nose. Nice tangy profile mixed with a mild dough edge. Full and consistent ride. Smooth feel. A very good American interpretation of this style. Had this and many others at Mugs Belgian shindig and this was clearly the winner for me."
"Wish I could have this more often and absolutely love it. The ABV slides up on you and slings you down on the ground. Scary...AMEN!"
"Glowing, slightly hazy tanned-amber in color. Thin coating of creamy, bright white head that holds throughout the entire tulip leaving thin lacing. Bright, almost tart fruity esters: green apple, pineapple, and banana. Underlying candied sweetness. The taste begins with a mellow candied sweetness that is soon met with a ripe citric tartness. A lingering yeast-mustiness with a faint spicy profile. The alcohol presence is subtle but warming on the back of the palate. A light medium in body; mellow and smooth. Surprisingly drinkable at 9% abv. Very similar to La Chouffe's hop offering; however, The Gnome's flavors seem more rounded and balanced."
"All in all, it seems that ""intense"" is a good word choice when describing this beer. This is definitely an American take on a style known for its smoothness and subtle nuances. In my opinion, it has nothing on the ""real"" gnome."
"Sampled several of these and even took notes (!) at the Blind Tiger in NYC, p0ured kind of flat unfortunatly, cloudy dark apricot, leaving just a smidge of lacing, nose is Belgian yeastyness, and fruits and flavor notes were of more fruits, bananas, yeast and the expected crisp and spicy and resiny hops. Alot of interest here, respectable take on a style I love, looking foward to more of this from Smutty and hopefully lots of other American and Belgian brewers."
