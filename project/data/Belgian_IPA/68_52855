3.96,2.3,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"I have mixed feelings about this one. It started so promising. It poured a beautiful combination of light copper, amber and dark golden. A modest head dissipates into a thin lace that retains throughout. The aroma was my favorite aspect. It smelled of malts, sugar and tropical fruits. I was excited to taste this one, however, the aroma and taste did not really correspond. Althought there is a slight bready, fruity and malty backbone, the intense hops finish is overpowering. The bitterness does not seem to render this a very balanced drink. The feel is good however; a stinging carbonation, medium body. This is a drinkable beer that I would not mind having again, but overall not my favorite.","Gajo74","Jan 12, 2015"

Aroma is of dried fruit, caramel, molasses...most of the elements you expect in a big Belgian.  Taste displays the same dried fruit character but with some herbal spiciness and substantial but not overwhelming bitterness.  Nice mouthfeel.  Overall, an interesting beer.  This was my first Belgian IPA and I did enjoy it, but it's not a style I'll seek out.  The Ralph Steadman graphics and quote on the bottle were nice conversation pieces.","FFreak","Aug 25, 2014"

Great dark golden color, the Bitch pours easily into room temperature pint glass. Leaves behind medium lacing with a rich golden-white head. Easy belgian taste up front, followed quickly by bitter hops. The hop takes over the flavor and lingers for a bit. Mouthfeel is overall very nice. Notes of the belgian fullness are there, but in my opinion the hop bites quickly and doesn't let go. Good beer. Would drink again.","wimteiss","Jul 11, 2014"

Those all carry over to the taste, and combine with the hops and flowers to give a distinct molasses note. The bitterness begins to come through as it warms a bit. Nice medium mouth that coats the tongue without being too oily. This isn't something I would drink frequently, but it's a really nice change of pace IPA.","MartzMimic","Jul 10, 2014"

I'm not sure that it works for my taste. The tripel style is just a little too overpowering, almost like I poured a tripel into a glass after drinking a pale ale and didn't clean the glass out or get a new one.

The taste is dominated by the hops. It's very bitter, and you can only detect a little balance from the malts. Quite piney. And I'm quite sure I can taste the Belgian yeast in there as well.

4.01,3.6,4.75,4.25,3.75,4,4,"I'd expect a "Belgian" IPA to be a little heavier on the pale malts, rather than the dark caramel, but this is a fine example of an American-Belgian hybrid. I've had it a few times before, but this is by far the freshest (bottled less than two weeks ago) and it seems to make a huge difference. As it warms, the aroma and flavors come alive and really make an impression. DO NOT drink this beer too cold, you will be doing both it and you a disservice. Overall, as long as I can find it fresh, I think I'll be buying a lot more of this.","glass_house","Mar 18, 2014"

Once poured, looks like apple cider- very cloudy, hazy, no foam or any kind of head. Citrus and grassy aromas upfront. The interesting thing about cask conditioned ales, and I really have had only a few in my life- is the almost absence of carbonation. There is some to let you know this is a beer. Amazingly smooth to me given the hop kick- which is immediate. The dryness hits you hard- grapefruit like any other IPA- but the yeast has sugary like flavor that lets you know this is Belgian style. Overall- an experience- really unlike regular tap beers. Because of the lack of carbonation, it is easy to drink quickly, and at high ETOH- it will catch up to you quickly. A must try for any beer connoisseur or anyone who wants to try something different.","AaronRed","Jan 19, 2014"

Almost medium body with a nice slick mouthfeel. Normal carbonation level. The flavor profile is interesting and complex. Against a sweet malt background, grapefruit hop flavor leads to a tasty slight bitterness that is both tart and spicy. The 8.3% alcohol is well hidden and expresses itself only as that nice residual alcohol burn on the finish. The finish is smooth and lingers with a touch of tart and bitter. An outstanding offering from FD.","tillmac62","Jan 17, 2014"

I can't say enough good things about this beer. It has a rich taste and a slightly bitter hop after thought on your taste buds.

Packed with a high 8.30% ABV, Raging Bitch is by no means a regret. With few BIPA's out there to drink it's worth a try, and that's about it.","shacawgo24","Jan 03, 2014"

I'll be having this one from time to time.","tmm313","Nov 10, 2013"

4.16,7.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/20/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, bread, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, clove, pepper, banana, caramel, bread, floral, grass, pine, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, clove, pepper, banana, caramel, bread, floral, grass, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian IPA style. All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

Nose is funky with Belgian yeast, tropical fruits with a touch of sour, grass and floral hop notes and a generous, deep and bready malt underneath to round it all out. There’s a touch of skunk in the nose that’s outrageous and frolicsome. As it warms the fruits come out banana and bubblegum. Up front taste is malt, dank, floral and fruity. The sour hops and bitter climb in mid palate for a delightful expression. It’s plenty fruity with citrus, banana and tangerine but the malt stays up strong well into the drink and the dry finish. Some medicinal alcohol on the palate but it’s agreeable & warming. Mouthfeel is buttery smooth, totally enjoyable & finishes bitter with a plucky aftertaste. This is a vivacious Belgian IPA that lives up to it’s reputation in every way.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

I like the creamy feel and the bitterness, but I don't care for the sharp acidic almost sweetness, or the way this stays filling in my stomach long after just a single beer. the 8.3% is also a little excessive, although I don't think its too forward or interfering with the intended flavors. its in balance, but its just not fantastic. probably overhyped to some extent, and like I always say, still waiting for a flying dog beer that really wows me.","StonedTrippin","Jun 04, 2013"

Great aroma of tropical fruits, fresh cut flowers, and pine. I found that this beer benefits quite a bit from being on cask, as it added earthy complexity, with the hops still very prevalent, tasting more 'resinous' than they typically do on standard tap or our of the bottle. There was a bit of a yeasty funk as well, that was not at all unpleasant. Although the mouth feel was moderately light, I felt that this was very warming on its way down. Overall a great IPA to try on cask.","Neorebel","May 10, 2013"

Several sips later, it's clear that this beer tends to use it's 10% alcohol content punch-up it's flavor profile instead of letting the ingredient speak for themselves. That's actually not a bad thing, but it does leave something to be desired after the experience is over. I'd revisit this review after a heavier meal prior to consuming another bottle. On its own, it doesn't do much to leave a lasting impression.","Bauzen","Mar 29, 2013"

4.02,3.9,4,4.5,4,3,4,"My third review, and as I said in the first two, please bare with me. Out of the bottle and into the glass, this is a pretty beer - a dark, transparent copper. The average pour produced about an inch of light white head, and as I drank the lacing clung to glass the entire way to the initial pour. The smell really made me want to dive right in; sweet biscuit, some banana, a touch of piney hops. The taste closely mimicked the smell, yet only sweeter. That delicious biscuit is up front but the sweetness surges forward. Next, I tasted a rush of banana and some unique candy, which is best described as bubblegum, but is much more indescribably unique. The hops don't appear until after the brew leaves the pallet. With the hoppy aftertaste, I get a nice boozey rush as well. The mouth feel is a bit watery, maybe even oily for the style. Overall, this beer is delicious, but the sweetness deters from the style and may prohibit prolonged drinkability.","eddie_g","Mar 22, 2013"

Some pine and yeasty esters poke through with just a faint hint of booze. The flavor profile follows the nose. Citrus and pine with some floral hops poke through up front. Some bready malt through the middle with spicy esters from the yeast. The finish is a touch spicy, with bitter citrus, and some faint warming. Medium body, a bit oily. Smooth. This beer is a little all over the place. Brash in spots and not congruent from one layer to another. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but not as tight and smooth as the best in the class.","ColForbinBC","Nov 29, 2012"

Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel. The taste is slightly sweet due to the Belgian yeast but neither that nor the taste of the hops linger. This is a very drinkable beer.","Ryanm1","Nov 26, 2012"

The body is light enough to be refreshing. Great interpretation.

Smell is of malt, herbal hops, spices, Belgian yeast, and slight banana. Taste is of Belgian yeast and herbal hops up front with a malt finish and a slight banana aftertaste. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The Belgian style takes a backseat the the aggressive hoppy flavor.

You look at the bottle and think, "what kind of post-apocalyptic nightmare have I found myself in today?" As you pour, you inleash the fury of the raging hounds of hell. They first assault your senses with a subtle and spicey smell, luring you into thinking this clear, perfectly carbonated drink might not be the violent ride thought it was. When you take your first sip, all doubt is put to rest. You are being attacked by an animal of a beverage. It's already got you in it's jaws. It's going for the kill. Violent hops, stinging spices, strong yet masked alcohol...this beer is a killer. When it's over, the only thing you are left wondering is "what the hell just happened?" and "what's a Belgian-style IPA doing being so American"? Then you do what Hunter would do and have another.","Maximusmaximus","May 12, 2012"

Not in a bad way though. Tons of flavors each sip with this beer that you tend to notice till the last bit. At $48 a case and $14 a six pack i dont get much of it.

The aroma sets up the tasting beautifully, with all the bittering Belgian activity that one might hope for, while leaving plenty of room for balance from equally as bittering hops, and a sweeter malt base. One criticism is that the booze, particularly at the end of the flavoring, could be a bit overwhelming at times, taking away some of the balance previously lauded.","TheBrewo","Apr 29, 2012"

The aroma is a tango of spicy yeast character, fruity esters and citrus--lemony hops, nice. The initial flavor is largely spicy phenols, immediately replaced by moderate citrus hop flavor. The beer finishes with a dry hop bitterness that lingers and welcomes the reemergence of the yeast character. The body is moderate and carbonation medium-high. Overall a good looking, good smelling and tasty brew. Definitely worth trying, though some tweaking with hop flavor/bitterness and carbonation would be interesting to see if this beer could be elevated further.","uwmgdman","Apr 20, 2012"

On the nose, I notice the aroma of Belgian style yeast, and some pine. Also some sweet malt. I am also getting some citrus, orange peel. This beer begins bitter, then you get the familiar Belgian beer flavor, then you get the hops again. I am picking up notes of pine and citrus, some grapefruit. Although this beer has a relatively high alcohol content, though it does not taste hot. i would say that is of medium body, though the alcohol does catch up to you. I am quite pleased with this beer.

It has a nice, cloudy gold and amber hue with lots of fruity hop aromas. The body and taste work well together, as the malt is present, but soft, which works well with the lower carbonation of the cask, and the mild diacetyl.","ThePortlander","Apr 04, 2012"

Light bready maltiniess, and hints of spice. Alcohol is detectable. Malt and yeast take over on the palate, light sugariness and a bit of dryness in the finish. Hop notes are muted, and there a slight candy note; gentle and understated bitterness in the finish. Some resin-y notes come through.

High carbonation, quite dry, nice weight and fairly full bodied. Though at first I really couldn't decide if I liked this or not but this is pretty good, definitely something I would revisit.","peensteen","Feb 13, 2012"

This one is definitely more on the IPA side than the Belgian side –mostly an IPA but with some Belgian-banana-smelling softness. Within the style, this is sort of opposite the White Birch Hooksett Ale from NH - that one is more Belgian-ey, less hoppy.","NardiByNature","Feb 06, 2012"

4.15,7.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"overall: this beer really blends the two styles of tripel and ipa together beautifully. After getting an idea in my head of what the style should be, this has definitely come the closest to that idea. Pretty damn close, in fact. The only quip about it that I have is that while I think it is pretty much stylistic perfection because it fits my definition almost exactly, it just doesn't have that intangible bliss factor that comes with a perfect beer. It is because it so closely fits the definition that it isn't perfect. There's just no feeling of bending the rules to make something unique but still stylistically accurate. I will most definitely be buying this beer again, but it just doesn't have the ability to make me break from thinking analytically about the beer like an A+ beer should. I'm still giving it a 4.5 overall because it is so well crafted, really and truly. Just a technically astounding beer.","etaggie09","Sep 26, 2011"
3.8,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O - Not a bad beer by any means and one I would definitely have again. I would really like to try it a) on-tap and b) in a different glass.

3.12,-19.4,3,3.5,3,3,3,"O: Flying Dog makes some good stuff, but this is underwhelming. It's far from undrinkable, but there's no single redeeming positive, either.

4.16,7.5,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a lovely beer. It's pretty much a light American IPA that is spliced with the interest and roundness of Belgian yeast to give it something surprising. A very clear exemplar of the style, and one of the best of the style I've had.","lacqueredmouse","Aug 27, 2011"
4.45,15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: A very tasty and solid take on an IPA. The spicy yeast and American hops make for a nice combination.","MattyG85","Aug 26, 2011"
3.83,-1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O- I'm loving this beer, especially as it warms up. For a beer that incorporates ingredients and flavors that can easily run wild and take over, a delicate balance is achieved and makes this one very memorable. I would certainly buy this again.","JoeBCBC","Aug 23, 2011"
4.17,7.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A pretty good beer if you like IPAs and are in the mood for one with a nice twist to it. Definitely worth tasting if given the chance.","PCampbell","Aug 23, 2011"
4.05,4.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Smoother than expected, and of a style I drink rarely, this is a good brew. Dry finish with a nice grapefruit linger. Medium bodied though leaning fuller. Lightish effervescence though prominent on the tip of the tongue to start. Warming in the throat. A good brew to be sure but the ABV says "just one, son".","PorterLambic","Aug 22, 2011"
4.27,10.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was pretty good beer, and it made for a pretty good first experience with a Belgian IPA. Since this was my first Belgian IPA I was unsure of how the Belgian yeast would work with a hop forward beer and I was pretty happy with how well the two went together and I will for sure be looking to try more of this style. I thought that the alcohol was hidden pretty well and I wouldn't mind having another one but I think two in one sitting would be my limit. The things I liked most about this beer was its appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel they were all awesome and very well done. I liked the sweetness and the lesser presence that the citrus hops had in the taste of this beer the least, but that would be borderline nitpicking. I would for sure buy a four pack of this sometime, its a nice change from your average IPA. I think this beer is for sure worth a try, especially if you love IPA's, so pick this one up if you haven't tried it yet. It seems like all the beers I have had from the Canis Major series have all been a step above Flying Dogs regular lineup and this beer is no exception, I am glad Flying Dog stuck it to the man and got their beer into the hands of the people in Michigan that want it, I admire them for that and I wish more brewery's were as passionate about their beer as Flying Dog is.","StoutHunter","Aug 21, 2011"
4.13,6.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall--This is probably not what most people are looking for in an IPA, but I love it. It's balanced, tasty and refreshing. If you're looking for something outside the norm in IPAs, this is it.","Kuromaru","Aug 21, 2011"
3.66,-5.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a good IPA if you’re looking for classic East Coast qualities blended with Belgian notes.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A lively grapefruit flash up front leads the flavor profile, with a nicely married hop presence accenting the grain, followed by a slightly bitter back palate and a hint of sweetness in the finish. This is a well balanced IPA that is so smooth on the tongue the high gravity is hardly noticeable. Seems almost too clean though, and not so raging.","tubacharlie","Aug 18, 2011"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O: A solid take on the style. I was actually expecting this one to lean more towards and American style IPA than it did. Drinkability is good. 4.0","Florida9","Aug 17, 2011"
4.07,5.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall: If you’re still new to Belgian style IPA’s, I bet you could do a lot worse than Raging Bitch.

I’m glad I made myself give this a go before Flying Dog disappears from the shelves in my hometown.","Pintofbrown","Aug 14, 2011"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Raging Bitch pours a slightly hazy reddish copper with a nice fluffy head. The aroma is fruity and estery, with some nice tropical fruit and a undertone of a medicinal phenolic character. Hidden under the yeasty aroma is a nice herbal, and slightly citric hoppiness. The spicy, sweet esters dominate the flavor, but after the estery sweetness fades quickly and the hops are become apparent. They are herbal and earthy, with hints of pine and citrus. Some bready malt is apparent as well. There is bitterness and phenols linger in the aftertaste, but the alcohol is hidden.","ericj551","Aug 14, 2011"
3.25,-16,4,4,3,2.5,3,"O - Different. Not sure if it's a good different. I just don't think that the belguin flavors and the IPA flavors go together that well.","clint1019","Aug 14, 2011"
3.44,-11.1,2.5,3.5,3,4.5,4,"Especially considering the very affordable pricetag, this one is a great gateway into Belgin IPAs for someone who doesn't wish to spend $15 on a 750 of Houblon Chouffe or $8 on a small Piraat.","BeerImmediately","Aug 14, 2011"
4.45,15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- This has been one of my favorite beers for a while and it is about time I got around to reviewing it. I consider this my gateway IPA. Please Flying Dog, keep sending it to Texas!","HopsKeepDroppin","Aug 12, 2011"

3.91,1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer appears amber and clear. Atop the fermented beverage sits an inch of dense head that leaves copious residue about the pint glass. The aroma brings spice, pepper, yeast, hops, and alcohol. The flavors are a bit scattered and rough, with too much alcohol in both the nose and taste. That said, the beer offers some pleasant spice and yeast character, and is certainly drinkable and enjoyable. Perhaps this was inspired by Belgian IPAs, but Raging Bitch is not in the same echelon with Duvel Tripel Hop or Houblon Chouffe, a couple of my favorite beers of this ilk. Overall, a decent brew.

Smell is initially of Belgium yeast esters, some banana, spice, oddly I don't get a very over powering hop presence? The feel is medium, some alcohol burn, a little more hops, nice sweet belgium yeast taste. The taste is a little different, it starts nice with some banana, a little sweet malt, and ends with a decent hop presence and an okay bitter after flavor which seems slightly off. Overall its about what I expect from Flying Dog, I've had three of their beers, none were great, none were bad, just average.","DavidST","Jul 19, 2011"

4.32,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Roaring out of the bottle, you can immediately smell the sweet Belgian malt, but wait. There’s something else there. Why it is the strong (almost cannibis) aroma of high alpha American hops barking sharp orders to your palate. The two are a match made in bitchdom. The initial swig shows sharp resiny hops on the sides and back on the tongue, but the candi sugar character slowly melds with that character and settles into a finish that is both malty and hoppy at the same time. Fruity yeast esters a long earthy bitter finish round this one out. Complex, yet refreshing, this one hides its 8% attitude well.","BeerBeatnik","Jun 29, 2011"
4.12,6.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a nice reddish, amber hue; a little on the lighter side of Red Ale. A very stick lacing on the insides of the pint glass. It smells of a fruity mix, but I can pick out the smell of tangerine on the hops. The spiciness of the hops is rather smoothed-out, different from many IPA styles - the bitterness isn't as profound here. Rich in malt flavors, the traces of yeast are covered very well.

There's also something distantly spirituous, like good vodka or perhaps limoncello. There's a strawberry and chopped cucumber note in there that reminds me of Pimm's as well. A good mouthful develops big sweetness cut off by a quick, sharp bitterness of hops and booze. Quinine and bitter lemon, musty yeast, grapefruit rind, baked apple, and burnt orange dominate, fading into a green banana and lemon peel finish. Not bad!

That said, it doesn't really do it all very well as the flavors and aromas seem to not really get along all that well. Perhaps if there was a sour component to it as well, that would make it world class, to bring it more on the Saison side of things, which is more like what this beer really is...but stronger than most. This is one of the better beers I have had from Flying Dog, so I wouldn't mind trying it again on draft or something, but this wouldn't be a beer that I would buy regularly...but I bet it would be absolutely excellent mixed with Girardin 1800 Gueuze with about 20-25% gueuze.

Smell is bubble gum spicy with a fruity grapefruit kick. A bit of a solventy alcohol smell but not enough to change my mind that is smells great and very strong. Taste is a very sweet tart grapefruit laced with banana and some earthy notes. Bitterness is there but nicely stays away from the other flavors. Not a big fan of Belgians but I really enjoy this taste. A touch of heat on the throat. Very slick and oily mouthfeel with well rounded carbonation. This is a really good beer.

Hops grab a hold of the palate and slap it around some, almost to the point it missed the Belgian aspects that the yeast had tried to lay out. Trace phenols are soon chased away from the fruity warming alcohol. Bitter finish has a faint aspirin flavor. Belgian style? Perhaps just inspired 'cause of the popular- ity of the style?

The nose is very hop heavy, and it seems like there is a hint of coriander or some other spice deep down below the hops. The sharpness of the beer hits your tongue before the taste does. The taste follows up nicely with a bold blend of spice and malt riding a wave of sour hops. The beer, for all its grandness early in mouth, slips quickly off to a quiet and smooth finish.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a good beer, and one of the better Belgian style IPA's I've tasted. I like how the hops don't overpower the Belgian qualities of this beer.","KarlHungus","Jan 05, 2011"

I really dig how this brewery names all of their beers in a doggy spirit without holding back on the bite...clever and attention grabbing. Appearing a clear burnt orange with copper highlights, the Raging Bitch held a respectable sandy head that gradually faded to sticky sheets of lace. The nose came across as a bright orange peel citrus combined with a light lemon zest making the aroma quite crisp and bitter. There is also quite a bit of Belgian yeast, as there should be, and in the end, the nose is really pleasing. Leading straight into the flavor, there are a lot of hops (Warrior, Columbus, and Amarillo - holy goodness) that make up a large, fantastic bitter bite. The orange is still quite present as a quick zest in the spicy carbonation and medium mouthfeel, though I found myself searching for the yeast after a while. Regardless, this is one Bitch that is definitely raging.","Lucklys","Dec 01, 2010"
4.26,10.1,4,3,5,5,4,"At first it smells like that clove/spice Belgian yeast smell. Then when you give it a swirl you really get that citrus almost pine like smell which all together smells like a forest. The taste is even better with that Belgain yeast taste at the beginning reminiscent of Dogfish Head's Raison Detre but then sweet in the middle and the citrus hop bitterness on the back. Normally I'm not really a fan of the Belgian style because all you really taste is the fruity clove like yeast that dominates all the other flavors. Where this has that taste but mixed in real nicely with my favorite American IPA taste. This beer actually makes me like Belgian beers more just like the Raison Detre made me like it better because of that added sweet roast malt with the raisons. It has a nice candy malt sweetness to it as well that mixes in with all the flavors perfectly. The mouthfeel is awesome too because it has that thicker rich like malt taste that you'd get in well crafted higher alcohol beers. Definitely worth the price especially because your getting a 6 pack of a higher alcohol beer. Also, the alcohol is very well hidden. All in all my favorite Belgian beer I've ever head and that's mostly because of the subtle but well mixed Belgian yeast taste with those awesome citrus American hops.","thebrood1987","Nov 30, 2010"

Aroma is quite sweet & fruity, must be the influence of the Belgian yeast. Not quite what one would expect from an IPA. 1st sip brings a potent, resiny piney blast of hops that is a 180 degree u-turn from the aroma. There is a slight hint of dry fruitiness on the swallow but it is quickly subdued by those hops. The alcohol makes it's presence know as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sparkly! The drinkability is good, although this doesn't quite qualify as a session beer, IMHO. Overall, a very nice melding of styles!

Whatever yeast strain they're using for this beer is awful, it's heavy on the bubblegum and medicinal flavors, while finishing with a phenolic kick that almost overwhelms the bittering hops.

While I'm still not sure if I'm convinced that this is a completely unique sub style, I AM convinced of its deliciousness. I'd hate to call myself a "hop head", but this beer certainly satisfies my (probably too substantial) hop cravings. Though I was probably too mesmerized by the hops to notice many other flavors, I still find this beer to be remarkably comprehensive in taste. It is well-hopped without being too bitter to displease or exclude the other ingredients. Its high ABV is very well hidden, and therefore makes it very sessionable- provided the session doesn't last too long! For any fan of IPAs, I highly suggest this beer.","BMoldy","Nov 10, 2010"

Fortunately the taste is much better with milder hops than I'm used to in American IPAs, but very tasty. I read they use American hops, and perhaps they are just very nicely balanced with more pale malts then I'm used to. Or perhaps they use the candied sugars often used in Belgian ales to increase the sweetness. The yeast taste Belgian and really just makes everything alright with me. When cold the alcohol is less noticeable, but as it warms the alcohol becomes more obvious. I like high gravity beers, but I prefer the alcohol to be more hidden, but that's a minor complaint that I feel a little awkward even mentioning. The alcohol is more pronounced in the smell than on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium or even a little beyondwith low carbonation leaving it a very drinkable beer. I will buy this again for sure.","airheadmtrcycle","Oct 24, 2010"

It featured a good mix of breadiness with sugars and some light alcohol on the backend. The mouthfeel was light, crisp, and well carbonated.

Taste is Bam Bam hoppy with a grapefruit and pine right away followed by an oily hop leafyness. Then you get a tripel like malt backbone and a return to grapefruit with caramel sweetness. Some more of that faint banana. Finish is very dry and clean with an astringent touch of hop oil lingering. No trace of alcohol anywhere. Feel is crisp and effervescent with an almost cream like quality. This is a real sneaky one to drink as it goes down like a milder mannered IPA with all the smooth complexity of a Belgian ales.

An interesting nose, with lots of grapefruit and general fruit basket smells up front giving way to lots of bready malts and cloves. The full, heavy body pounds the flavors home. Initially bitter, the lemon notes slowly sweeten to grapefruit and then sweeten more to reveal multiple layers of complex fruit, spices, and herbs. There's a lot happening here.

Caramel and toasted bread in the aroma, fruity and powdery, a bit yeasty. The flavour was surprisingly mild and balanced - I was expecting something more bombastic. Malty and fruity up front, a bit of alcohol, some citrus and spice towards the end along with sugary sweetness, followed by a slightly bitter and somewhat quick finish. Pretty easy drinking for the abv. Light peppery warmth, a bit dry, medium to full bodied with lowish, nearly creamy carbonation. I liked this and enjoyed it.

3.73,-3.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I know a beer should be judged by what is inside the bottle, but I've always found myself turned-off by Flying Dog's rather frightening label art and general attitude. The name and label art on this beer are disturbing, but, with the beer receiving consistent high marks, I decided to give it a chance. Pour was a beautiful vibrant amber/copper. Aroma was both Belgian funk and hops. Flavor was redolent of fruity Belgian yeast notes, carried on a substantial current of hops. A big beer with a big abv to match. ETOH was moderately evident at the finish. The Belgian/IPA marriage has always seemed to me a tricky proposition - like paring sweet and salty, the balance has to be just right. Here, the two flavor profiles seemed to retain a consistent distinction - like drinking a half-and-half of each style - it never quite came together for me.","Brent","Jul 28, 2010"

Aromas included mild banana and a somewhat floral hoppiness. The taste was an unusual combination of strong banana/clove and up front bitterness. There was some maltiness noticeable underneath, but it was not a large component of the taste. The menu claimed an ABV of 8.3%, but I did not notice an alcohol flavor.","sonata2008","Jul 26, 2010"

4.02,3.9,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy amber color with a small off-white head. Smells of freshly cut grass and heated plastic (lol, in a good way). Taste is cinnamon up front, with a grape juice middle, and a phenolic, clovey, medicinal finish. Piney hops are in the aftertaste along with a bitterness that clings to the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, its the beers lowest point though, as the high alcohol and intense flavors make this a sipper. I would definitely get this again though.","tronester","Jul 24, 2010"

Is it weird that after I smell this beer for the first time I think of the way that Saison Du BUFF smelt? Had that beer quite a while ago, but I get the same herbal, spiciness to this beer as well. Smells like an herb garden with a bit of hops and sweet malts. Initially, I taste the herbs and spices. Lots of oregano, clove, thyme, and pepper. Then it gets very sweet and hoppy. This beer is so damn tasty. Very unique in my opinion. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden and the mouthfeel is just perfect for this style.

The American hops contribute expressive flavors of lychee, kumquat and tangelo just underneath the herbal notes. The finish has some peppery alcohol, ginger flavors and phenolic notes that lean more towards turpenes than the typical clove notes.

I didn't review that one, as I was at home w/my family and just drinking and hanging out. I almost gave the remaining five away. I'm glad I gave this one another shot; it's one of the better beers I've had from FD, a brewery I'm not usually (except for Horn Dog) that big of a fan of.","BedetheVenerable","Jun 23, 2010"

Raging Bitch is an apt moniker for this one. Very bitter taste, seems like the hops are some that you might find in an American IPA, but the yeast is all Belgian.

A combination of west coast hops less of the citrus and more of the pine variety with some Belgian yeast character and spice. So the taste...there is a malt backbone in there somewhere but this beer is dominated by the hops. The Belgian character is a bit lost behind the hops which really dominate. I'd say there is a small lack of balance, but it's a great IPA. The body is good and the carbonation is moderate, the finish is dry with a lasting bitterness overall pretty good. When cold this beer is incredibly refreshing. The high alcohol and high bitterness don't detract from the drinkability of this beer in any way. I've never tried any other flying dog beers but have to say that I'm pretty impressed by this one. A solid IPA with some refreshing Belgian character.","fank2788","Jun 19, 2010"

The taste isn't as exciting as the aroma: faint apple fruitiness, booze, burnt bread towards the finish and rides out grassy with patches of mud and some candle-wax. Light-medium in body. The raging bitch must have hit menopause. There's no mojo here, no great flavor, no lasting impression. Flying Dog never ceases to fall short of expectation.","JRed","Jun 18, 2010"
3.19,-17.6,4.5,3,3,4,3,"Pours a clear amber orange color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving some good rings of lacing and had a lasting cap. Aroma is peppery, piny, and full of Belgian yeast. Alcohol is noticeable in the aroma as well as a touch of anise, presumably from the yeast. Taste follows the nose pretty evenly. First thing that hits are the spicy, peppery hops that give off just just a hint of pine and herbaceous qualities, followed by a good dose of caramel malts which are bready, and overall pretty balanced. I gotta say I'm not a fan of the spicy hops nor am I huge fan of Belgian yeast being used in IPAs. Maybe this just isn't my style, but it's hard for me to really get into this beer. It has some nice qualities, but could use a little more citrus/tropical hop flavors to balance the spiciness. Body is well rounded and nearly full for the style. Alcohol isn't as present in the taste as it is in the nose. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite either. Still searching for the Belgian IPA that blows me away!","KeefD","Jun 17, 2010"

3.08,-20.4,4,3.5,3,3,2.5,"I had high hopes for this one but came away fairly disappointed. It looks nice - amber-orange transparent liquid with a mess of fine white bubble on top. The aroma is pretty good - orangey/floral/cat piss hops, clean wood, honeyed malt and light Belgian earth. It's actually a tad boring for the style, to be honest. The taste is just disappointing. There's a lot of bland bitterness from both hops and wood. I've never much cared for Amarillo hops, so that could be to blame, but this beer just doesn't have much going on. The more delicate hop notes have faded, the wood doesn't provide much interest and the yeast is understated. For the style, it's harsh on the palate and drinkability is poor.","popery","Jun 14, 2010"

That promise of pine certainly lives up when tasting it for the first time--resiny hops fill the palate, but it subsides into a malty, caramel finish with a deeply satisfying alcohol undercurrent. It's a well-bodied beer that's neither too light nor too heavy.

The nose comes off as sugar-dipped hops steeped in some funky straw and garnished with some parsley. Not only does it add a bit of color, but a dash of spicy aromatics as well, adding to the whole dining experience. The parsley is also on the tongue, joined by some mightily bitter hops, some light caramel, a dash of soap, and I think I've got a pinch of paprika in there too. Something like that.

In the aroma, there is a strong hint of clovey Belgian yeast followed up closely by hop bitterness that creeps out. Same thing in the palate except a little less Belgian yeast clove/spice character - more hop bitterness that makes you pucker up, I love it. Mouthfeel is that of a traditional Belgian-style ale - a tad thick yet soft carbonation. Very dry finish. The mix between the high level of hops & Belgian character is wonderful - very different. This is a wonderful ale, I cannot wait to get more.","tim9887","May 03, 2010"

The taste is pretty good too, I get an increased hop presence, a sweeter grapefruit base, and underlying malt that is excellent. Sharp bitter and spicy finish; a bit carbonated. The alcohol percentage is about right, as I detect but a small amount of burn on the end. I would be happy to drink one of these every once in a while.

This is one of the better beers I've had in a few weeks. Not sure about the "Belgian" appellation here, since it doesn't seem akin to any Belgian beer I've had. A regular IPA title would be fine.

Definitely smells the part of an IPA. Definitely getting the citrus and a hint of grapefruit, alongside with scents more common in light Belgians such as pear and yeast. A strange, yet intriguing taste. It seems like each sip varies back and forth between styles - sometimes it is IPA, sometimes it is pale Belgian, but these don't seem to mix like they should, not very well balanced. Also much more IPA flavors are detectable as a whole rather than Belgian. Still, the flavors that come through from are both good. Heavy citrus and pine, slight caramel, the Belgian tastes seem to focus on mostly sugary yeast and spice. A bit of booze. Mouthfeel is fine, carbonation and thickness is in a good place.

It resides at about two fingers and has very good retention. Even after a minute or so, the head does not want to go away, a very nice looking beer. The suds stick well and there is some medium lacing left behind. The smell reminds me of a Belgian white. Hints of bubble gum, yeast breadiness, light grainy malt, some citrus fruit and spice. I definitely get some orange peel and banana. The nose has good strength, nice. The taste is similar to the smell but hits the palate much harder. I pick up some huge spice, maybe from hops and yeast but it feels added, cardamom? either way, I have tasted it in Belgian style ales but not to this degree. The light grainy malts stick around and so do the yeast products like banana and bubble gum. The citrus peel aspect is also there and makes for an interesting beer. To me, the spicy/yeasty aspect is way to big in this one. The hop bitterness seems out of check too, too bitter. It has some cool flavors but I don't see much balance here, it is a raging bitch. Mouthfeel is nicely creamy and medium bodied. The carbonation is lower and allows the flavor to come through maybe a bit too much for me. A hugely bitter coat of Belgian yeast spiciness is left on the palate. Drinkability is alright. The flavor is too strong for me in spiciness and bitterness. The price, as always, is very good from flying dog and the ABV is very well hidden.

The color was a deep, coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was definitely Belgian yeast with esters of banana and must. Speaking of bananas, the taste was initially that of banana bread, then suddenly, the pine hops kicked in for a riot of flavor. It was like a King Cake, except that instead of a baby, somebody baked a pine cone into the middle of a loaf of banana bread. Zoinks! Mouthfeel was kind of abrasive, lots of CO2 scrubbing the nooks and crannies of my tongue. The finish was all hops, leaving me gasping for breath. Almost forgot the beautiful lacing throughout.

3.73,-3.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a chimay chalice transparent orange with a thick white head, great lacing all the way down. Smells of weak floral hops with a hint of yeast. The taste is rather odd for an BIPA. The hops flavor up front doesn't really mix well with the belgian yeast used. There's a conflict of flavors going on that may just be too complex for my palatte. But there is flavor with this beer, lots of it. The mouthfeel does leave a unpleasant aftertaste, but the alcohol is not evident. Making this a rather confusing drinkable beer.","whoneeds8","Mar 23, 2010"

The aroma is of sweet malts and some dark fruits as the base with floral and earthy hops over the top. Very nice pleasing smell. The taste is on par with the smell, sweet malts, dark fruits, and a slight roasted malt taste, for a backbone. Over the top is a nice floral hop bite with some hints of earthy hops. Very complex and interesting. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a moderate carbonation.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a frothy and clingy khaki colored head. The aroma is definitely of hops; floral and juicy with some pineapple and other tropical fruit notes. The hop presence it a bit more subtle in the flavor letting the sweeter belgian style to pop through. Not much in the way of yeasty phenols. Definite tropical fruit flavors coming from both the hops and yeast. There is some spice and pepper, though it seems that its main job is to offset the hops, which it does. A light to moderate feel with fizzy carbonation, very nice balance, especially for an American made BIPA. Very enjoyable though I still prefer the Belgian made BIPAs, I just enjoy a more Belgian flavored BIPA.","Gmann","Mar 20, 2010"

The nose is full of piney, citrusy, and fruity hop aromas with subtle hints of bannana and Belgian yeast coming out on the end as it warms. The flavor seems to follow the aroma pretty closely with each sip with a touch of honey sweetness coming out as it warms. There is a nice and refreshing hop bite lingering in the finish.

Strong, slightly citric, hoppiness with lots of oranges, and a hint of zesty lemon. The taste is bitter with a mouth coating perfuminess. The Belgian yeast is very apparent, offering, adding a harder edge to the familiar Flying Dog pale ale flavours. An interesting beer, was expecting a bit more though I think, given the hype it received from beer bloggers over here in the UK. To me it taste a bit like their Classic Pale Ale on steroids, however, the power seems to have unbalanced the subtle bitterness that makes the pale ale so great.","PartyBear","Mar 12, 2010"

Taste is again forward with a wonderful blend of the above mention hops, slight sugary sweetness and belgian yeast flavors, slight bitter bite. The hops are the star, but the other ingredients round out the flavor perfectly. Great body to it, i love the feeling on the palate - fuller side of medium bodied, slightly coating and hints of a sweet and fruity aftertaste all with a nice carbonation profile.

It has a solid malt base of pale and Carapils malts. It goes down smooth with a killer hop flavor. It's incredibly refreshing. It's also well balanced and highly drinkable. What a delicious IPA. The Belgian yeast character is limited. There's only hints of it in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Medium-bodied with big carbonation and a subtle alcohol heat which appears randomly throughout the session.

The hops and yeast esters are both very strong but just about even in proportion. Banana hits first, then mango and guava, some bubblegum, slight herbal resins. Smells like that Dole orange pineapple juice. Really luscious and potent aroma. Unfortunately the flavor isn't as robust. It's not bad but it lacks complexity. Simple, lightly sweet malts emerge up front and then a light tropical fruitiness washes into a mild bitterness and a very very clean finish. I didn't expect this to be filtered but with a yeast-free final pour, it must be. Explains the clarity and cleanliness. Body is not too thin on the palate but it finishes like water. Carbonation is rather subdued after such a prominent display of head upon pouring. Great aroma, decent flavor, good beer.","illidurit","Feb 16, 2010"

There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is great, it's sweet, fruity and hoppy. It smells like pine and citrus hops, tropical fruit, candy sugar, Belgian yeast, caramel and peppery spice. No one aroma overpowers the others. However, the hops are stronger in the taste at first. Once the beer warms up more, the flavors start to balance out. It tastes like pine and citrusy hops, peppery spice, yeast, and bready and caramel malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink.

Head eventually settles into a half inch cap with delicate, semi-concentric bands of lacing formed as the brew recedes. Nose presents with some citrusy sweet hops initially, but as you tease the aromas out there's something else there, perhaps herbal or candi sugar or both. Taste consistent with nose; however, the citrusy sweetness is there, but well masked. Herbal quality expresses itself as somewhat bitter and lingers between quaffs (maybe anise), and I still think there's some candi sugar in there. Mouthfeel is medium-light and very lively, just shy of prickly with a fairly dry finish. A very interesting and tasty beer - better than I expected, but I found it a little tough on the palette.

This beer has a lot of slightly carmely malt sweetness, yet still maintains a finish that is not too sticky. This beer is on the lighter side of medium bodied and I find that mouthfeel fairly smooth and pleasing, though I find myself wishing it was a bit more carbonated.

Very hoppy but its balanced out, has the typical Belgian yeasty sort of taste to it. Nice smooth finish.. for being a strong ABV beer not too harsh at all either, but it will definitely hit you after one.

A light citrus character and a deep "purple" earthiness that're indicative of Amarillo, fill all corners of the palate and are chased by pleasant alphaic acid bitterness. A crisp light medium body delivers round lingering hop wonderfulness throughout the mouth. For an 8% and change abv beer with 60 IBU's Raging Bitch is dangerously drinkable. This beer epitomizes the class of beers we, in America, call IPAs, Belgian Style IPAs, Double IPAs.

Just a bit of peppery character that compliments the pine hops. The dryness is the most Belgian aspect of the beer, which leaves it feeling like a dry IPA with a strong malt flavor.

3.71,-4.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Opening with a fairly potent bitterness with a lot of pine needles and grapefruit and citrus rind, this is quite the palate-bruiser. The hop bitterness is really strong, quite dominating the Belgian yeast character that's relegated to the background with a yeasty, spicy, estery character. There is a definite malt presence, mildly sweet and honey like. Resiny on the finish with more hop bitterness, this is EXACTLY what I'd imagine an East Coast Belgian IPA to taste like. Medium-light in body with a fairly high level of carbonation, this beer is solid. Great for the style, but unfortunately, the style just doesn't do it for me.","DefenCorps","Jan 18, 2010"

4.47,15.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a surprisingly light orange amber with a full finger foamy off white head that resists fading and leaves a nice amount of lacing behind. The smell is really good...an aggressive and unique fruity candied-melon-tangerine-apricot and piny hop resin. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is smooth and crazy creamy. Full flavored the fruity sweet aspects of the nose are well balanced by the intense hop resin mirrored in the nose. The piny hop and melon characteristics linger nicely. A real easy drinker...the 8.3% ABV is really well integrated. Scoring CRAZY points for CREATIVITY...Highly recommended!!!","jjayjaye","Jan 16, 2010"
4.22,9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Saw a sixer of this in the local BeerMart and it looked interesting. Poured a bottle into a tulip glass. The pour leaves a thick bubbly head that fizzles out into a thin ring. Moderate amount of lacing left on the glass. The color is a clear copper/light orange. The aroma is real heavy on the citrus. A noticeable grapefruit presence. It smells like an IPA should smell. Real nice. The taste is much the same as the aroma. Real strong citrus punch up front. Grass and pine follow and give way a nice bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. This beer drinks well and is quite enjoyable.","mtbbaboon","Jan 16, 2010"

4.46,15.2,5,4,5,4,4,"Drinkability: Given the finish is less intense than its beginning, and the fact that it is a unique balance between a tradtional IPA and a Belgian ale, it makes for a very enjoyable beer.

Smell: spicy, lemon, green apple, nectarine, caramel in back, a little yeasty earthiness. Taste: piney, lemon peel, spicy with a vague tropical fruit flavor and cantaloupe beneath. Just a little mustiness. Bitter throughout with a very dry finish. I don't know that I'd pick it up again but it was enjoyable. Best before June 2010.","babaracas","Jan 14, 2010"

Flavor is lightly malty and just sweet enough to balance the hops , lots of cirtus and orange type hops with very little bitterness , lightly earthy but very good flavor .

4.06,4.9,5,4,4,4,4,"Resinous, herbal hop flavor and bitterness up front. Hops become sappier and bitterer as the fruity (melon and pear), slightly sweet malt shows itself. Yeasty, funky character throughout. Aging hay, pine, and minty hop bitterness in the finish. Slightly warming. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Big and bold and definitely what we now call a Belgian IPA. Oh, and a steal at 8.99 a six pack!","alexgash","Jan 06, 2010"
3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"It's a dark copper beer with white foam on top. There are some carbonation bubbles rising within. It leaves patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma is hoppy, slightly earthy and farm-like (recalls hay and other grains you'd find in a barn). As you'd expect, the taste is dominated by hops. It's mostly bitter, with some sweetness and detectable alcohol. The combination of sweet and bitter in the aftertaste is interesting, unexpected and very good (probably my favorite aspect of this brew). It has a medium body with a lot of carbonation. There is some mouth coating, but it disappears as you swallow. I find this to be pretty drinkable for a strong hoppy beer. I could easily drink a few glasses of this...slowly.","ToasterChef","Jan 06, 2010"

4.8,24,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"What's not to like about this beer? An IPA brewed with the glorious simcoe hop, finished with Belgian yeast. The beer will pour a golden orange hue that is topped with a sumptuous white head. The aroma of the simcoe hop and mild clove and coriander create a beautiful bouquet. As for the taste, this is easily one of the more satisfyingly flavorful yet refreshing IPA I have had for a long time. The Belgian IPA is a great trend for other breweries to catch on to, I look forward to see what other places have up their sleeve.","at1234","Dec 27, 2009"

Grapefruit and other citrus and sweetness. Lots of citrusy hop spiciness on the front. Classic Belgian spiciness on the back. It's like a flavor mullet! Palette seems about right for this beer, keeps it crisp, not too thick or thin. Really well balanced, no hint of the considerable alcohol.

3.9,0.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a golden honey color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is very floral, with some very perfumy hops backing the light fruity sweetness. Flavors replicate the nose, and I have to say this is one of the hoppier, bitter, domestic Belgain style IPA's I've tried. There is some underlying sweet white peach and honey, but the hops really come on strong in this beer, giving if a long, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light and drinkability is OK. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable then I would like, and I can't see myself having more then a single glass at a sitting. Still, this was a nice effort by Flying Dog; one of the more interesting beers I've had from them of late.","John_M","Oct 26, 2009"
4.1,5.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Growler pour, clear medium dull amber, has an olive oil sheen to it, sits under a luxurious and creamy light khaki head, that stays and stays forever. Leaves thick frothy sheeting on the glass and rings of thick lace. Heavy/pungent tropical fruit/hop nose. Hopped up ale, fresh pineapple notes predominate. Not really getting whats all that Belgian about this one, perhaps some phenolic yeasty notes in the back ground, but mostly what I'm experiencing is a tasty, fruity, hoppy ale. Tasty and enjoyable, hop lovers will love this one, actually a real nice looking and smelling brew, but I'm not sure if they hit the note they were going for.","Billolick","Oct 21, 2009"
