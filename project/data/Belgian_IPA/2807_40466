4.13,-2.4,,,,,,"This is a very good beer with a slightly weak aroma; otherwise it is a flavorful version on a Belgium IPA.  The yeast phenolics do not overpower the hops, but instead blend to create a well-balanced taste bud stimulation.  A 10.5% abv is hard to hide but the balance between the phenolics and hop terpenes ties the ethanol up nicely – it is only hinted at by flavor and not noticeable in the aroma.  The heavy lacing and golden body make this an attractive pour as well.  Overall, if you like the style, you’d be well-advised to buy as many bottles as you can find.  If you don’t like the style, it is definitely worth your time and money to buy one bottle and try it – it may change your mind.","Ozzylizard","Aug 24, 2014"

4.63,9.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Final Grade: 4.63, my first A+. I've reviewed 300 beers now, and Dominus Vobiscum Lupulus is the best one yet. How's that for a capper? It is mouthwateringly good, with perfect balance and absurdly high drinkability for something of its heft. At over 10 bucks a bottle (and with limited availability - I had to drive to London to get this), it's not something I can get regularly, but I may just head back to procure a few more bottles before it's gone for another year. This is a must-try, combining the best of both the IPA and Belgian beer in general.","thehyperduck","Jun 21, 2012"

4.23,0,5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Clear gold body with a voluminous white head. Great retention and loads of lacing, exemplary for the style. Nose has herbal Noble hops, tropical fruits, and some orange. A bit of sulphur as well I think. Still quite vibrant for what I've been used to recently within the style. Taste has a sweet fruity malt component almost reminiscent of a Belgian golden strong at points, before being cut but a tropical hop profile and some bitter citrus rind. Long and significantly drying herbal finish. Full feel with a medium high effervescence and some alcohol. A very nice Belgian IPA, but a bit too bitter for regular and mass consumption in my eyes.","liamt07","May 06, 2012"

4.25,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pale blonde colour 3 fingers of dense white head, lots of lace stuck to the glass. Smell is of citrus fruit and candy apple, floral and vibrant with a huge hop profile, spicy belgian yeast works well with all the hop aromas, malt with some more citrus, grapefruit, orange and tangerine. Taste has a nice semi-dry spiciness too, more of the giant hop bill on the palate, yeasty, light sweet points, with citrus and tropical fruit flavours. Medium drying carbonation, medium to full body, nice consistency from the yeast and oils. Great stuff here, truly a treat to drink, ABV of 10% nowhere close to present.","peensteen","Beers"

The nose is spicy, yeasty, honey-like, floral, grassy, mildly rustic and has a prominent Saaz hop character. Very fruity, this is brilliant. The palate opens a little sweeter than I'd like, with honey, grainy sweetness, sugar, a little bit of Splenda. A real hop tea flavor is present on the mid-palate, with a ton of Saaz flavor. Sweet but with a lingering hop resin character, Saaz tea, there is also a touch of butter, earth and yeast flavors. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer has an excellent finish with a lingering resiny hop character. Highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Aug 29, 2011"

4.5,6.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"i was lucky enough to have this in the same stretch as the duvel triple hop and must say that this is a bit more broad. the interesting thing is that it has a healthy abv interaction. its not noticeable but it does have subtle hints that make it more pleasant. it just as brisk as a duvel would be. there is fruits in this one. golden clear with a wonderful cauliflower head... but the pop gave way to a pilsner hop/malt quality that was undeniable. this was almost momentary though. this quickly opened up into something more. acidic notes of triple like esters. fruit qualities of persimmon and sour earthy hints. palate was a hint of sweet with a sour white grape and a floral earthiness that first gave way to rosemary then a mineral hop quality that make me think of the grit of straw. palate as it warms has hints of lychee but with a significantly more bitter note than that i came across in the hill farmstead E. this has almost a chalky note to it. which dries any quality of elixir sugar the 10abv sweetness could provide. on the spectrum of palate range this is a lot of flavors that seem to come into the palate very pin point but expand violently as it is experience by whom which ever. brings on an appetite too.","rtepiak","Apr 01, 2011"

I don't really like the sweetness here, but the flavour profile is still pretty good. Sweet mango and apple with yeasty flavours lead to spices and candied malts.

This bottle had mellowed to the point of faded hop glory, but malt profile was still plenty sturdy and the alcohol nearly invisible - had become very sneaky for 10%. Retained a puffy, long-lasting head and the aroma, although muted, was still inviting. Highly-hopped, this beer gains no benefit from aging if you are a hop-head, but is still enjoyable if the balance more toward the malt end is preferred.
