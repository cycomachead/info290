"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, light wheat. Taste is also strong of citrus, a bit of wheat is present, a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Blue Moon appearance, IPA taste"
"D: This was a nice IPA, not exactly sure what makes it white. The scent and taste were decent, and the body was nice. The finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. Nothing special, but still enjoyable."
"This is one Heck of a hybrid ale. Wit grain bill, strong ale yeast, American IPA hopping. Sizeable head, good lace, wispy covering. Cloudy orange gold. Nose is lively with wheat twang, light pils breadiness, tropical fruit hops. Taste is an amalgam and it works out beautifully. Light malty body that seems to be overwhelmed by the huge hop content but the yeast and mellower hop artifacts bring a balance to the finish that makes this highly quaffable and refreshing.  Feel is smooth with a mild carbonation that brings a gentle dubbing of the mouth. I like this stuff. It's hard to define out pigeonhole bit it's good."

"Pours a nice light yellow color with a decent head and some off the chain amazing lacing that coats the inside of the glass and holds on for dear life. Aroma is full of grapefruit. Taste is decent, hop bitterness and some grapefruit and citrus peel. Feel on the palate is thick and holds on for dear life before going down the gullet. Good hopped beer !!!!!!!!"

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable - a nice white IPA with the touches of wheat as well as the moderate hop presence. Definitely worth grabbing and better than I expected."

"decent but nothing real special here. i dont get the white part really, at least not as much as others in the style. its only a little cloudy and wheaty, still more of a regular ipa to me in grain composition and flavor, although there is a slight hint of belgian yeast fruitiness to this that may take it there, but its so subtle as to be an accent. the hops are also a little mild for what i like an in ipa, and would call this more in the session family, except its over 6% abv, so it doesnt really fit there either. i need to assess this just as a beer, not how well it fits into a style, especially one as poorly defined as a white ipa. its clean drinking, no yeast or grain weight to this slowing it down, and carbonation is high, all of which i like, but i am looking for more hops in this, and for a sturdiness that matches its alcohol content."

"Overall, a good beer.  It gives you the taste of an IPA with the look of a witbeir.  A nice combo in my opinion."

"O: tasty, interesting and easy drinking."

"3.86/5.00"

"Overall: More a tangy grapefruit IPA vs. a true Belgian influenced IPA. No matter, it tastes very good."
""
""
"O: Delicious white IPA."
""
""

""

"Overall it's more of a weak pale ale, and doesn't really come across as anything even remotely different in this style."
""
""
""
"Overall, I wish I would have tried this sooner. What an awesome IPA. Sweetwater never fails to disappoint with just about every beer they release."

"O - They claim it to be a 500 YO Belgian recipe hit with a truck load of hops and that is pretty much what you get. This is definitely worth having again."
""
"O - not crazy about this one."

"Very flavorful. Not much Belgian character. Too bitter for my liking. Couldn't get past the phenols."
""
"Not a bad offering from Sweetwater. It's not what I typically look for in an American IPA. It lacks a substantial malt backbone and feels a bit sharp and thin, but the flavor is rather nice. I like the fruity character of the hops and found this beer to be one you want to drink 2 or 3 of."
""
""
"O: Definitely a different take on the IPA, but not unwelcome. It's light, refreshing and easy to like."
""
"The ale is a little messy, but is still quite desirable as it does something compelling and unique- creamy-dry like American Ale, fruity and spicy like Belgian Ale and then with a clean perfume character that is somewhat flamboyant."
""
""
""
"This is likable enough and not offensive at all, but it feels like Sweetwater really played it safe and went the moderate route. Not sure it's worth a purchase over other white IPAs this yar like accumulation."
""

"Nice work and cheers to the brewmaster"

"M - Light bodied, certainly well carbonated, great drink ability."

"Overall: Better than expected!"

"O- The aroma got me all pumped up but the rest of the beer wasn't quite as good. Still one of the better ""White IPAs"" I've had even if I'm missing the white part."
""
""
"Pours a beautiful clear amber with some white head. Hoppy aroma has a strong citrus undertone, more Mandarin orange than grapefruit. Flavor is monumentally hoppy and has a bold sour citrus tone, as much grapefruit as Mandarin orange. Texture is quite fizzy so you feel it inside you as it heads downstairs. This is one whiplash you will be glad you got!"
"O: This beer isn't amazing and I wouldn't seek it out. But it's new, and I love what Sweetwater has to offer. I think it's solid and well balanced. I'd recommend you try it at least once."

"O: Not a bad beer, but not one that I'm likely to buy again. It's refreshing, but I wouldn't call it drinkable. Maintains its IPA teeth rather nicely."
"So I noticed this beer in Publix and had never seen it before, so here we are. I really like this beer. It seems to be vastly different from Sweetwater has usually done. Has a great balance and all in all is very drinkable. This is pretty new beer and I would definitely suggest you go and pick some up to try for yourself."
""
"O- This was a damn good beer. It was very well balanced with a nice complexity. I will be having this many more times to come."
"Pale golden amber appearance, with haze in the body, made it clear, that this was a beer drawing on both IPA and wheat beer traditions. The smell was sweet, delicate, floral, and lightly citric. The taste struck a good balance between a Witbier and an IPA, as I could first detect bubblegum, banana, and a peppery yeast, and then got a dose of grapefruit, and some pine. This was not quite a thorough melding of the two style, but more of a layering effect, with two distinct waves of flavors. The mouthfeel was creamy and soft, being close to basically a Witbier, while the finish was drawn out hops similar to, but not quite as intense as an IPA. Nicely done blend of styles."
"O - Sweetwater nails this belgian IPA. Glad to have a new seasonal. A very close cousin to their IPA but with a belgian yeast strain. Great brew!"
