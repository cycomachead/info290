"Excellent beer. Hop-forward, yet it maintained the characteristics of classic Belgian brews. R E C O M M E N D E D  !"
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 02/25/2015.  Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like stone fruit, apples, citrusy and pine hops, and bready malt.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice, candied oranges, citrus peel and a bit of clove noticeable.  There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick, smooth and goes down easy.  Moderate carbonation.  I liked this brew, certainly worth picking up!  $11.99 a bomber."

"O - Not too surprising that this is a massively hopped attack.  There is not really balance here.  It is more like a dance on the edge that manages to step back from the abyss.  A delicious, heavy, full DIPA."

"A nice, flavorful beer but not sure I would pay $13.00 for another bomber. Glad I tried it though."
"Overall: I'd drink it again but that's as much as I can say."
"Awesome Belgian yeast and hops!"

"O - Good tasting and quite drinkable Belgian IIPA.  I would drink it again.  Prost!"

"Belgian perfume yeast but not over the top. Candy orange. Good balancing bitterness."

"O - Very happy with this beer.  Passed it by the first time I saw it on the shelf last year but I did not pass it by this time and I was rewarded with a very fine brew."
"maybe my least favorite beer from these guys so far, and while i can appreciate it for what it is, i think its over rated on hype alone. its overly belgian, i mean way past bubblegum and high tone fruits, its over the top with that, probably fermented in the 80 degree range or warmer, and just because it has a lot of flavor, does not make it good. its honey colored beer, nice and clear and holding on to a very lacy white head, looks nice in the glass. it smells like leftover belgian yeast, and sweet oily west coast hops. the yeast is just too much, not that there is sediment or anything, but its flavor, its run wild away from the reasonable range, and feels almost sharp as a result. the beer isnt all that dry though, which i find a little confusing. the hop profile on this is excellent, i would guess some simcoe, sticky and rich for sure. it just doesnt need this yeast intensity, it would be a far better beer as an american double ipa, with some nondescript ale yeast, rather than this white winey, taffy, even corny strain that dominates the beer. finish is long, and the alcohol cuts sharply through the oily hoppy tail end, leaving a boozy belgian tang on the tongue. i appreciate making very very bold beers, but this one never really comes together for me. that said, the rest of our tasting group enjoyed it very much, and i am thankful to thebrewo for having shared this rarity with us."

"Overall: One of the better Beligan IPAs I've had.  I have seen a lot of variation in this beer, but this one is a fresh and fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure what I'm tasting, but there's tons of hops! A little spicy and yeasty. Like I said, I'm not a fan of the style, but this is making me think that might change."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this is a really nice brew"

"O - 4.75 - What a damned fine brew, one of the better DIPA's I've had in a long time. Highly recommended!"

"Life a Rich life is a Belgian Style IPA that in thought was one of the stoopidest names ever.... Until I read on the side of the bottle that it was dedicated to a young gentleman named Rich Sheppard. It pours with an aggressive foamy bright white head. It looks translucent amber/orange... Reminds me of orange/cherry 'Jell-O'  The taste isn't nearly as 'yeasty' as I expected. In fact, I wouldn't  know it was a Belgian style at all init weren't on the bottle. Taste was very pine heavy, starts off extremely piney and finishes with a heavy dose of  citrus, mostly orange, tangerine and Pineapple.  Feel is rich and creamy. Rather light and crisp. While it is def worth seeking out. I will say a drawback for me is, the 'Soap' taste that some IPA's have. Overall, great brew by one of my fav breweries~"

"Glass on tap at the brewery. Cloudy pour with ample head. Sweet aroma with some citrus notes. First thing I noticed about the taste was how much it reminded me of pineapple. tasted almost like those canned ringed pineapples you can buy in the store. After getting used to this flavor, I was able to taste some bitterness and malt character. Interesting drink."

"Mouthfeel is dry and crisp with a sweet cracker finish. This is a wonderful beer that I wish I had more easy access to. I still think this is a bit of a misunderstood style for most of the hop heads out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Word: While the sweet fruit flavors on the tongue are full and refreshing, the finish is too unbalanced and potently bitter for a typical drinker. While anyone can enjoy the flavors in the first sip, the dry, bitter, astringent finish immediately overwhelms them and defeats the subtle fruit flavors up front. As it stood, it was a beer that only hop lovers or thrill seekers could truly enjoy, but anyone else should take a pass for a more trustworthy IPA."

"Another winner from FFF. Perfect hazy orange color with a thick rich head when poured. Not much of a nose but great initial taste. Rich smooth flavor and the best Belgium IPA I've come across. Leaves just enough hoppy bitterness in mouth. Reaffirms FFF as possibly best overall brewer there is."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really haven't been a big fan of belgian ipa's until this beer - FFF pulled this off perfectly, really an excellent and flavorful ipa. The belgian yeast and bright peppery flavor is completely complimentary, definitely a must try imho."

"Overall, a stellar Belgian IPA that drinks like an American IIPA. In fact, I thought it was very reminiscent of Hopslam, with just a bit more hoppiness and a bit less sweetness. Very glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- nice IPA by FFF but I don't even get the Belgian contribution. Very good but not that much different than their other hoppy offerings."
""
""

"DELICIOUS; TREAT YOURSELF!"
"O- An awesome bitter IPA with a since Belgian style twist. Very enjoyable, really hope to get this again."

"Pour a crystal clear gold with 3 inches of fluffy white head. The head settles down and retains about a cm and leaves significant lacing. The nose starts with heavy American hops. Pine, citrus, orange, and mango come through strong up front with fruity notes of Belgian yeast to follow. The belgo characteristic are largely overshadowed by the aromatic hop profile. The taste starts with a moderate to high bitterness with notes of grass, lemon, pine, and citrus with strong resinous notes throughout. The middle sweetens up a bit and exposes some of the Belgian notes, but bitterness again comes through and leaves a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a moderate body. Overall, the Belgian qualities of this IPA are pretty mild, which I actually like. I'm not a fan of Belgian yeast esters over taking the hop profile and it is certainly not the case here. This tastes right up the alley with the rest of Three Floyds IPAs."
"O - Live A Rich Life a.k.a. Shark Pants as it was formally named is a sheer piece of brewing class. When FFF are bottling rotating ales of this quality they are a brewery that's hard to beat. I enjoyed this maybe too much as I've craved it since. Lets hope this one keeps finding its way into bottling distribution, bc its one of the best brews you'll ever get your hands on. Long live Rich Life."
""
""
"O: A very interesting and unique offering from the Floyd family. I enjoyed this bomber, but it's not necessarily the beer I'd go for when craving a hoppy brew. Balance leans strongly towards the herbals and pine throughout, especially when it warms up a bit."

"Verdict: I've been enjoying bombers of this beer since the 2/17 release and it's showing no signs of slowing down, which is admirable considering how quickly many of the IPAs from Three Floyds begin to wilt. It's definitely a maltier beer than what fits the FFF stereotype, but it's still a great hoppy beer and one of the fruitier IPAs they've made. The belgian yeast adds a great level of intrigue to this and it's not one to be missed, easily one of the better Belgian IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance was a reddish amber color. Not much of a nose on this. Taste was straight up bitter. I couldn't detect any real hops, just pure bitterness. Very dry with almost no sweetness. The opposite of a juicy IPA. I really wanted to love this beer but it fell short for me."

"If I wasn't told this was brewed with Belgian yeast I probably would have never picked it out. This is, in my mind, a juicy, ripe, extremely drinkable IIPA. Three Floyd's brews some better versions of the style, in my opinion, but this is in no way a slouch. RIP Rich, you have an excellent beer brewed in your honor."

"Pours dark apricot with a thick off cream head. Lots of roasted citrus aromas on the nose. Some grilled peach, grapefruit, and lemons. It's very bitter at the first taste, but it does follow the aroma quite a bit. Mouthfeel is full and a little over carbonated. Like most 3 floyds offerings this is overpriced but worth a try."
""
""
"Three Floyds Live A Rich Life ---4/5."
""
"Mouthfeel is great. Crisp sticky feel from the loads if hop oils and resin. Milt is mildly sticky and sweet and carbonation is moderate to high. There is also a slightly dry finish."
"Overall, a pretty good DIPA that just doesn't quite hit the right notes for me. There's too much sweetness and a harsh alcohol bite that makes it a nice beer to try but a beer I wouldn't clamor for again."
""
"O. Very nice. A hop forward ale for sure. The yeast doesn't impart much flavor but the malt certainly is noticeable. I recommend this but I prefer Zombie Dust and A Cow much more. The appearance is my favorite aspect."
""
"O - Another delicious IIPA from Three Floyds. I don't even hesitate when a new one is available to buy, they are always worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my favorite beer from Three Floyds – yeah, it even beats Zombie Dust. As usual, there’s a lot of hop character in the nose and palate, but it’s never tongue-smackingly bitter; here, the hops are offered up to the palate like a gourmet spice. With everything this beer has going for it, it’s safe to say that it’s pleasing beyond just “I like this taste or that taste, so this fits my palate.” As far as I’m concerned, Three Floyds has come just about as close to bottling happiness as any brewer can – what a way to remember Rich! Cheers."

"O: Another exceptional IIPA from Three Floyd's Brewing company. I would compare this more to Permanent Funeral, than I would Arctic Panzer Wolf or Dreadnaught. Well worth the $11.99 price tag for a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A good beer, it didn't blow me away like some of FFF's other IPA but it was still good."
""
""

"O- I don't get much of the Belgium coming through in this beer but is fantastic never the less."

"Pours a deep golden amber capped by a two finger off white fluffy head. Excellent retention, bunches of sticky lacing. Huge notes of grapefruit, citrus, pine sap, flora, and fruity Belgian yeast. Opens with mandarin orange, grapefruit, pine sap, floral accents transitioning into light caramel and toffee notes. Light mustiness and fruity yeastiness midpalate. Finishes dry with bitter citrus rind, ""juicy fruit"" notes, and abundant clean alcohol. Heavier side of medium bodied; smooth and silky mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. An absolutely wonderful brew and one of my faves from FFF. Highly recommended."
""
"Pours a deep reddish amber body that is transparent and clean. Big light straw almost golden head in a FFF Teku. Big tropical fruit aroma on the nose. Very inviting. Really slick, oily, resiny mouthfeel. Fairly thin and very west coast style body. The taste is quite aggressively bitter with some citrus rind and sweet pine. There is some fruitiness to the flavor put this isn't a citrus juice bomb, so go elsewhere if you're looking for that. Very unique and interesting. Hard to place the hop bill, but it plays well together. Only a hint of malt sweetness. I'm not getting the Belgian notes but I'm fine with that. Really aggressively bitter but just enough fruitiness to make it enjoyable. Really fun drink. The only other thing I'd note is that as it warms the finish is quite boozy."

"I have been holding onto a bottle of Live a Rich Life for at least a year...waiting for the right moment to pop it...well Father's Day is as good as any. The beer poured a nice clear copper with 1/2 finger thick head that is leaving a nice lace. I left a heal in the bottle to keep the sediment from getting into my tulip glass. The scent includes Belgium malt and fresh hops that provide citrus, slight pine and some floral tones. The taste briefly bitter, then a nice sweet malt comes to the rescue to balance the beer...settling into a smooth slightly bitter, peppery dry finish. The mouthfeel is full in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer and falls in line with all the really awesome small batch beers that 3F brews."

"O: Appearance and Smell stands out above all. Taste is a bit of a let down -- but that does carry the caveat that this beer has about six months on it. A fresh beer might taste differently. I'm actually a little surprised there isn't more of a belgian ale taste. That's kind of what I was looking for, but this looks and tastes like a straight DIPA. Overall, a good beer, but not one of the best of its kind."

"This one pours a clear light copper with a finger or two of tight off-white foam. Nice head retention and lacing. Bold, juicy hops make their presence quickly known. Grapefruit, lemons, and tangerine. Lightly toasted bready malt detected as the beer gets a chance to breathe though the citrusy hops are pervasive and continue to stick around. As you might expect from the nose, flavor skews heavily towards fruity hops with mandarin coming into the fold along with an herbal component. Since the beer is classified as a Belgian IPA, I would expect more belgian yeasty esters but I'm not detecting them at a level that I've found in other examples of the style. Finishes medium-dry with a lingering grapefruit juice. Medium-light bodied, moderate level of carbonation. Three Floyds consistently does a great job with their lineup and I'm especially a fan of beers in which they feature hop forward flavors. No exception here, well done."
""
"O- A tasty take on the style. The alcohol is fairly well hidden. Tasty."
""
"this is a SOLID ipa. not getting much of the belgian flavors, but maybe it's because it's so hopped up and still fairly fresh that the hops take over the majority of it. don't get me wrong, it's not a hop bomb.. they're very well balanced and blend in perfectly with the rest of the beers' features. pick this one up for sure if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A cool beer, but not really something I'm going to clamor for FFF to make again and again."
"O - I'm not sure it's geared toward Belgian IPA like the style implies but it's definitely a great beer. There's just a lot of balance in this beer between the hops and malt."
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice dipa but don't see how this is classified as Belgian style dipa? Good but not $15 a bottle good."
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't hate it, but struggled with the sweetness, to boozy and rich for a Belgian IPA, needs more hops."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber, big cap of soapy white froth, good sticky lacing. Scent brings big amounts of citrus and tropical fruits with a heavy dose of pine, firm spicyness, sweet sugary malt backbone. Taste brings strong fruity hops, backed by spicy and lightly bready yeast component, malts sweet but not overly aggressive. Smooth, almost creamy body. Really nice beer with strong flavor and good balance between the components."
""
""
"M - Medium body, creamy. Lots of tongue-coating hop oils. Light carbonation."
"Bang on DIPA. Yeast flavour exceeds the malt backing, well balanced. Intensive IBU and hop flavour. Great drinkability for a DIPA. Better than average. Big retained head. Above average mouthfeel.Fruity, piney, a little caramel.Very clean.Bottle from Steven."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy amber with a nice white head. Aroma is hops first but there is a certain perfum-y-ness which is perhaps the Belgian contribution. Tastes better than it smells... very very citrus; lots of rind. Good balance of flavor and bitterness. Medium body but still crisp, especially considering the ABV. Glad to have had it."
"O - This was probably one of my favorite Belgian IPA's I've had."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is not as hoppy as I hoped but it is fine, mild to moderately hoppy Belgian amber, a little grassy with a nice finish, great yeast character, easy drinking, I'd have it again."
""
"Dark orange with some copper hues. Dense offwhite head, excellent retention and lacing. Nose is bold but not abrasive by any stretch. Tropical fruits, mango, clementine, tangerine, honeydew melon and a sugary, cookie-like malt. Perhaps some honey Some mild herbal and piney notes also. Complex. Taste is just as hoppy, more of the same in terms of tropical and citrus profile with grassy and herbal notes highlighted in the finish. Strong malt presence as well. Only a suggestion of some Belgian character, perhaps imparting a bit of dryness. Full feel, medium high carbonation. A superior Belgian in real FFF character - awesome, I really don't know how this style gets much better."
""
""
"o - overall, i had heard that this was the same beer as shark pants but only brewed at FFF? not sure if that's true, but my impressions certainly are the similar. this is a bitter bomb. the shark pants i had from de struise was way more barleywine like so i wonder if it wasn't as fresh as this? either way this is a hophead's dream. this is a nice beer and worth seeking out while still fresh. didn't blow my mind, but a solid ipa...not so much belgian."

"A lot of the flavors and textures that I love so much about Dreadnaught manifests themselves here. But where Dreadnaught is focused on the dialogue of hops and malt, this more complex and characterful version is reinforced with the yeasty spice and estery fruits from Belgian influences to show artistry in recipe formulation and perfection in brewing execution."
""
""
"22 oz bomber poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a copper amber orange with a thick 2 inch off white head that slowly recedes and leaves great lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, lemon, fresh cut grass, earth, bread, and caramel. Super complex, maybe one of the most complex DIPA's as far as aroma goes. Taste is similar. Lots of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is medium and chewy and alcohol is well hidden. This is like dreadnaught with Belgian yeast. Awesome beer."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers FFF has produced, they seem to be outdoing their year rounds on purpose. This has all the bitterness you'd want from an iipa, like Dreadnaught on steroids and with tropical fruit abound."
""
""
"Tastes very much as it smells. Starts out of with lightly bitter fruit nodes--orange peel and white pepper--which veer impressively into pine, grapefruit, and orange before calming down into a peppery finish of burny alcohol."
"O: This is solid. I don't know how I'd tell this is a Belgian IPA; if you gave it to me blind, I'd swear it was an American interpretation. Maybe it's the dryness. Either way, it's damn good."
""
"O - Very nice. The Belgian aspect is pretty muted, but this is a nice DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Smells and tastes great. The label says Belgian, but I got more west coast ipa. Very nice."
""
""
"Absolutely love it. Once again a new beer from these guys still suprises me. Just goes to show this is the best brewing company around. I walked in, asked about the beer, got an honest response, purchased it an it was even better than described. These guys are their own scene and their beer is the best. Period"
"O: Another excellent beer by 3 Floyd's. Even those who don't like said one would love this beer. Very good balance between sweetness, hippiness, and alcohol content. I enjoyed this one one tap @ 3 Floyd's and will definetly pick up a couple of bombers to go on the way out ( evevn @ $15/22oz it's worth it)."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is quite exceptional with citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, slight tropical fruit, malt, and some Belgian yeast flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good tasting beer with a fantastic smell."
""
"o: Picked this up at DLD '12. Such a good beer. Tropical fruit delight...could easily drink this with breakfast. If you have a chance, please pick this one up."
""
""
"O: Picked this one up on a whim at DLD and now I'm wishing I picked up a few more. This is an excellent beer and really was much better than I was expecting it to be. Paired it with some charcuterie from Smoking Goose and it couldn't have complemented it any better. Fruity, juicy, and hoppy, make this one a very easy drinker."
""
"Highly drinkable althought this is one of my favorite style. For whatever reason this is much tastier than when I had it last summer on tap from FFF. Thanks egrace84 for the revisit!"
""
"Poured from bomber into dimple glass mug. Pours bright orange with a good white head. Beautiful lacing that lasts throughout. Wonderful citrus and floral aroma. Mild hops, beligan yeast, some pink bubblegum, and sweet fruit. Medium bodied, great carbonation. Stickymouth feel. Overall a really nice “tamed down version of Dreadnaught”!"
"M: Medium bodied."
"Cost: $15 for a 22 oz bottle."
"O- I haven't had many, but this is my favorite Belgian IPA. Great FFF hop character that is only enhanced by the tasty Belgian yeast. I'll definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an incredible beer, really blends the glory of American hops with Belgian yeast in a great way, can we get this in six packs?"
"O - What happens if you take Dreadnaught and brew it with Belgian yeast? You get this beer. Solid DIPA. However, I was hoping for the Belgian aspects to shine through a bit more instead of playing such a small role."
"O - The best Belgian IPA I have ever had. This beer is just absolutely fantastic. I couldn't be happier that they are bottling it (although very expensive...$6 for a glass in brewpub, or a $15 bottle. Ouch.) This is one to seek out, period."
"Wonderful. Also had in a bottle picked up on DLD. Great as well."
""
"Taste of the citrus and hops blends very well making this an easy drinker. I wish I had bought a second bottle, would drink again."
""
"Overall, this is one of the best Belgian double India Pale Ales out there. Floyds once again takes a style and dominates it with those amazing fresh hop notes. Don't overlook this one and grab it if you have a chance"
""

"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. Much better than Stone Cali-Belgique and on par with Raging Bitch."

"O- Glad I have had the opportunity to try this quite a few times, definitely a treat.This beer is driven by the classic FFF hop profile balanced out with a solid caramel backbone and the hints of Belgian yeast which make it unique from the other DIPAs FFF makes. Above all else is the great cause this beer supports. Nothing like giving back to help out your favorite brewery."
"overall: stellar"
" "
"OVERALL: My notes just say ""really good"". And after having the good fortune to try this a second time, I have to agree with my initial assessment. It is a really good beer. I hope there's some left out there for a few more of you BAs to try."
"This is a excellent Belgian IPA."
"At Three Floyd's with Sean and Mike... Dark copper orange with an awesome bright white head, great lacing... Aroma of fruit, oranges, a little belgian yeast, ok... The taste is a little to solvent hoppy on the front but its fruity and hides the 9% really well"
"Overall Impression- Very nice, complexed beer but for a Belgian IPA, not too impressive. I'm starting to like how much complexity and different flavors/ingredients they bring to each and every drink. This one was much harder to drink but still thought it was a good brew! VERY limited batch so get your hands on it if you can."
"The flavor brings quite a bit of Belgian yeast, especially as it warms. Nice combination of floral, citrus, and piney hops. Everything there plays really well with the yeast. Medium body and good carbonation. Bitter in the finish. Quite bitter. This is one of the best, if not the best, Belgian IPAs I've ever had."
"Lush feel, big citrusy orange and layered tropical fruit notes with an undercurrent of bitter earthiness of resiny pine and aspirin. Creamy feel, extra smooth. At 260 ibu, its surprisingly not intensely bitter. Very tasty and deceptively strong. Cheers to FFF and Struise on their successful collaboration!"
"Shark Pants is, like Dreadnaught, on the medium-bodied side of the double IPA mouthfeel continuum. Soft carbonation helps to amplify the tropical fruit flavors. Overall, this is good stuff. It’s AS good as Dreadnaught in the abstract, but I am forced to dock it half-points in a few areas for not reaching its Belgian-yeast potential."
"Very solid beer, would love to have again."
"Overall, a too drinkable beer that I would love to have a few bottles of. Alas, only available on tap."
"This beer pours a nice muddled copper in color with light cloudiness. It arrived with a one finger off white head which dissipated within a minute or so. It smells like an imperial version of Alpha King. It smells of light and resinous piny hops with a solid malt backbone. It tastes of sweet and resinous hops and there is little to no Belgian characteristics. Where's the yeast? It drinks medium in body and drinks decently for the abv. Its not what I wanted but its solid. The artwork is legendary, which is why they should bottle it!"
"Very nice, a fantastic Belgian IPA, but I still prefer the house versions of American IPAs."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer, particularly for the style. Would easily drink this again."
"O-great beer. They set the bar here"
"Overall -- Tasty, but not a massive departure from the other DIPA's in the FFF ouvre. Absolutely worth trying, though."
"D - I seem to have encountered two awesome Belgian (D)IPAs after a long dry spell. I think brewers (at least in the Midwest) are finally realizing the potential for Belgain yeast and malt backbones combined with American hops (and not just early in the boil). If this comes out in bottles I'll certainly buy one or two."
"O: I'm stunned this is only 8.5 abv. It is a leviathan of a beer. Little beers that drink like bigger beers always rate well for me, but this is almost too much. Still, really well done, although drinkability is definitely below average. "
"Alcohol seems a bit hidden in this."
"I've tried this once on tap out of a snifter and then found it again at a local's only brew fest. Please believe that I wore out my welcome at their tasting tent!"
"O - Delicious beer. Well balanced and packed with flavor. Could drink plenty of this beer for sure."
"O: I really enjoyed this collaboration. The yeast added a wonderful creaminess that really smoothed this out. Will def. buy bottles whenever they start doing that."
"O - I really love what they did with this one. The hops, fruit notes, and Urbain's yeast really makes something to enjoy. Very easy to drink and def a treat being able to try this. Best of all, proceeds from this beer goes to a former FFF employee who recently passed away. Cheers to FFF and Urbain!"
"O - Fantastic beer. Almost hard to explain how good this is. I had two of them and then followed it up with a dreadnaught. The dreadnaught is 100 IBU's but it actually tasted bland after the shark pants. This beer really is a hop explosion. Try it if you can. It is worth it."
"O- This beer to me was very good. After having a couple snifters of this I must say these two need to do many many more brews together. The flavors were settle and while the hops dominated everything they didn't go too out of their way in making this a palate crushing beer. The alcohol was present only toward the ending and did a good job at not over drying the palate. Will be looking forward to trying this in a bottle if they ever bottle it."
"A must try 3F Belgian ale."
"O: a nice take on the style...try it."
"Get down here and try it-- it is currently ""no growlers"" and might not be bottled..."
