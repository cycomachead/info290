The hops dominate the taste, which makes it a medium bitter beer. The texture of the beer is thin, and the initial hop accents are completely absent in the finishing.  Overall a nice beer, which tastes better if you drink it slightly warmer than the recommended serving temperature.","Wanne","Jan 10, 2015"

Hoppy as it tries to be, the estery elements in the beer still play a very important role, esp. on the nose, while on the palate the hop elements add more complexity and enjoyment, esp. in the aftertaste where yeasts and hops converge to deliver a palate ideal for anyone who appreciates Belgian yeasty magic and hop consolidation at the same time. Personally, I think this is a nicely hoppy Belgian ale with a decent balance and evolving flavour profile to savour. If fixed at a lower gravity, this beer could’ve been even quaffable.","wl0307","Jul 06, 2013"

There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Excellent retention and some lacing. The nose is peculiar yet nice, blends of belgian yeast, hints of dark fruit, almost wild character. The flavor is equally distinct, mild caramel malt base provides a mild sweetness from which the light belgian yeast builds. Hints of banana and apples. Mildly bitter, more fruity. Finishes with a hint of tart. Odd flavor for a Belgian IPA, but not bad at all. Medium bodied and carbonated the beer finishes dry yet smooth. Overall, an interesting beer.

A touch of hops and sweet malts in the nose, but there is an odd, vegetal aroma in there that is pretty offensive. The flavor yields pale malt, spicy/floral hops that contribute a soft bitterness, skunk?, a bit of alcohol, and lightly fruity, chalky yeast on top of a crisp, highly-carbonated body that has a bitter linger.

The basic malts reminded me of Duvel - for the white grape, bready taste - but it didn't have the same rich yeast character.

3.38,-9.1,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"D: It's O.K. I would say. Basically, it feels like a Belgian Pale Ale with some hops thrown in... but the hops changed the overall character of the beer very little.","MrDanno96","Jan 02, 2010"
3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bitter, hoppy slap to the palate up front, then softly faded back...gets milder, slightly sweetwhile retaining the hoppy flavor. Needs more body, and a bit more from the hops to compare to Poperings and the like.","feloniousmonk","Jan 01, 2010"

3.06,-17.7,4,3,3,3,3,"D: It's not offensive, it just lacks the Belgian IPA kick that I like. I'm glad I only bought one bottle.","akorsak","Dec 08, 2009"

I think it goes down well, but I would'nt ever buy this beer again. But I'm glad I tried it. hmmmm... I think it just doesn't have enough hops for me...","hoplover82","Nov 18, 2009"

3.55,-4.6,2,2,4,4.5,4.5,"mouthfeel and drinkability: this beer is very sessionable and would also be great for introducing some non beer advocates to different styles. it has a well masked high abv and a very complex flavor. some aspects of this beer i really dont like and others i do.","northaustin","Oct 30, 2009"
3.7,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Unusual bottle, its an 11.2 ouncer and its a swingtop...rinsed and will be a sauce dispenser of some sort in its next life...this one poured cloudy light tangarine. Sweeter nose with a moderate hony whiff. Pleasant enough Belgian pale, the hops seemed to be on the muted/subtle side, so not sure what makes this one an ""IPA"". Worth a try but nothing to get overly excited about.","Billolick","Oct 29, 2009"

3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I tried this as it was new on the menu of the local belgian bar in my girlfriend's town. Not bad, though I'm not sure I'd use the title of IPA to describe it. The hop taste is definitely more apparent than other Belgian beers, though compared to other Belgian IPA's, it seemed somewhat lacking. Everything about it was good, though I would like to see less sweet and more bitter. The appearance was great though, served in a tall, narrow, thick glass. Cloudy tan with a slight orange tint. The smell was not necessarily distinctive, though it did not detract in any way from the overall experience of the beer. All in all a good beer and definitely worth a try. I can't say it's a favorite, but like I said, pretty decent.","friendofthedevil","Mar 01, 2009"
