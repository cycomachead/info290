"Pale yellow White fluffy head with a Grapefruit aroma. Tangerine and Mango flavor of the hops is upfront. Carried by a light body mouth feel. Very refreshing beer."
"Opened this to very nice grapefruit citrus smell and taste.  The beer had a great mouth feel and tasted as good coming in as going down.  This should be a year round seller."
"This is one seasonal that should clearly be sold year round. Already craving the absence of Accumulation."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow. Nice and foamy and very refreshing. This is my favorite part of winter."

""
"Decent if not spectacular."
""
"One of my favorite IPAs.  Purchased a six pack of bottles at the store and have twice gone back for more.  Very crisp with a light mouthfeel, yet bold in flavor. Brings together a nice balance of bitterness and drinkability.  Absolutely loved it."
""
"Very good IPA, great winter beer."
"Pours gold with a slight haze under a 1” white foam cap that produces thin lace. Has a grassy, herbal nose with some fruit and bread.  The palate is creamy, citrusy and fruity with traces of bread. The hop bitterness is between orange and tangerine rind. There is a light sweetness that dries out on the finish. It has a creamy wheat texture with medium body and slightly below average carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Decent brew, however I expect better from New Belgium. I can respect them for thinking out of the box in terms of an IPA. Regardless I just found the taste rather strange."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a decent beer, but nothing amazing. Hop centric, and fairly refreshing, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice wheat style white IPA, very enjoyable."
""
"Unfiltered wheat beer appearance.  Grapefruit & slightly harsh bitterness similar in taste to their ranger IPA but with a better body."
""
""
""
"Easy drinking but not that flavorful.  Hop presence on the nose though.  Enjoyed smelling it more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid!  Very crisp without that over sweet finish.  Different but good."
"Overall: This is a really good, refreshing tasty beer. I am sorry it is only a winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp and clean. Very good, but not too strong for a white IPA."
""
"O- A very nice offering from New Belgium and one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had. I very much enjoy the drinkability and the light citrus and tropical notes you get from Mosaic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful drinkable IPA,my new football watching beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O (4.25) – I’m not quite sure why I bought this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I always like New Belgium beers, and this one was above average for sure.  Not very familiar with the white IPA style, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely buy again!"
"I can't put it in to words the best but smell and flavor are top notch for an IPA!  I wish they had this for a summer brew! I've had a decent amount of IPAs but this one easily lands within my top 5!"
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing wheat summer like ipa"
"Overall:  A solid White IPA.  Per the bottle, this beer employs Mosaic and Amarillo, two of my newer favorite hops that shine in this beer!"
"Overall I thought this was a good IPA, something that I wouldn't mind drinking again in the future."
""
""
"1/3....pours hazy opaque yellow with white foam. Lemon rind nose, citrus bitters. Pine bitter open balanced by a wheaty citrus base. Continue to find white IPAs an odd combination of flavors, and this is no exception."
"It's ok, I would not get it again"
""
""
"It was delicious and smooth"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is bright, light to medium with consistent crispness.  It's smooth beginning to middle with a sharpness in the back."
""
"Final score: 3.49"

""

""
""
"I did enjoy this one. As others have mentioned, it did have a piney smell, and absolutely a piney aftertaste. The piney-ness, I oddly enjoyed. It was as if I was drinking a liquid form of my christmas tree this year. The rest of the flavors were mixed, though I did not notice any peanut butter as someone else had mentioned. Then again, I don't catch every little nuance in smell and taste, admittedly. But it was thoroughly enjoyable and a good solid winter ale."
""
"Overall, unsure about this one, I didn't expect the peanut butter and am unsure if that was intentional, the soapy smell wasn't that appealing. I'm not thinking about coming back to this one. Wish I could find a date on this beer, but I know its this season's batch."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow that makes me think of grapefruit.  Nice, thin, creamy head.  Very pleasant piney grapefruit fragrance.  A very crisp, light hoppy taste with lemon and grapefruit hints.  Finishes with a little more prominent piney hop.  Actually very refreshing.  This one surprised me.  I could drink several of these and I would have never guessed it was 6.2 percent.  I think more highly of this one as I think more about it.  Not super complex."
""

"Not too bad for a mass produced, seasonal IPA."

"Very good with a holiday dinner!"
"Very interesting. The smell is unique in its funkiness, and the taste has a bitter pine something going on. I like it. I don't know if I'd get it again though. It's certainly good, just unique."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer. Extremely pale, almost watery, complexion.  Decent head and lace.  The smell is pungent....musty hops....tree ark, mushroom, earth, and grain. Me nteresting, but not great.  The taste is dryish, but no overly so.  Moderate bitterness.  Just okay."
"I don't remember being impressed"
"Taste is fairly subdued. It's somewhat fruity and piney and not much else. Not really digging it. It's not real bitter, but it has some bitterness. Not picking the spice in the taste. Kind of blah."
""
"I am a New Belgium fan boy but this is darn good."

"Outlier detected. Please enter a review."
"Not really what I was expecting. The flavor was pretty bland and poor. Straw yellow color."

"Over all a decent beer. Kinda felt like I was drinking a light beer rather than a IPA"

"Doesnt drink like a belgian ipa to me which is a good thing. Nice light hoppy brew with no overly assertive yeast or spice. Not the greatest but for the price it would be something i could take to a holiday party where i dont want to take the best but still want something drinkable."

"Accumulation of snow is not a problem here, but a white IPA?  Something extraordinary, lets give it a whirl.  Popping the top I get a huge citrus waft of lemon, orange and grapefruit oils with a nice sweetness in the background.  Pours into my trusty SAPP to a slightly cloudy watery bright yellow with a massive white pillowy head that stands for what seems like forever,  On the taste this brew has a nice citrus hop bite that is well balanced with a citrusy sweetness.  The taste transitions to a more bitter middle with sweet and bitter finish that is mostly clean.  Mouthfeel is light but insignificant due to overall flavor.  Head holds up all the way through the brew, a nice light drinker with a good flavor kick, definitely a keeper."
""
""
""
""
"Great taste. Lighter than a hearty IPA, but with a similar taste. Nice beer!"
"easy to drink, very smooth and sneaky strong, not to bitter"

"Overall impression:  A bit restrained for a Belgian IPA.  Needed more of ""something"" but not bad.  Probably won't seek out again."
""
""
""
"Finally, a winter beer that isn't Ultra Dark Night Coffee Bourbon Stout. And a solid IPA to boot. Medium bodied and pale yellow, big head initially then persistent lacing. Pine and citrus in the hop profile, which are my favorite hop notes. Very faint wheat. Big fan and my *light* winter ale of choice (the ""dark"" one going to Sierra Nevadas Celebration)."
"Poured a bottle bought 2014-12--07. Very pretty straw color though none of the touted unfiltered cloudiness. Smell: absent (and I don't have a cold).  Taste: about as much character as your typical mall store chain. Seriously. Every single time I go back to New Belgium cuz I want to give a good bicycle- and environment-advocating company some shouts, I am always so disappointed and angry that I wasted cash and calories. Where is the wheat? I can barely taste it but it takes closing my eyes and searching for the wheat. Bitterness is present, but has no character (not grassy, not floral, not esterly, so ... just, bitter?). The carbonation is good and fizzy; the body is solid and not thin. But that just doesn't warrant the drinking."
""
""
"This ale pours a pale yellow and cloudy. Leaves a nice fine head and very nice lacing. The aroma is very fresh and clean. Hops and citrus abound with a prevalent grapefruit overtone. The first sip hits you with hops and then the grapefruit comes through with a smooth slightly malt finish. Very clean mouth feel and quite smooth overall. A nice Winter offering from New Belgium. 6.2% ABV"

"A bit too fruity tasting for my liking. Grapefruity, bitter finish. Rather have a Bud than this."
"OVERALL:  this is my favorite winter seasonal beer so far, I like it better than SN Celebration.  This is high praise because I really enjoyed that one as well.  This beer will become a yearly tradition for me going forward.  New Belgium is an excellent brewer and I'll be trying more from them in the future."

""
""

"good beer, I'm surprised by the overall rating. Should be higher, I'd say."
""
"One of my favorite beers I wish i could get all year-round. Has a delightfully balanced floral/hop taste that makes for a great ""have to try beer""."
""
""
"Initial flavor and aroma is IPA, but the white beer element gradually sinks in after a few more sips.  Plenty of citrusy hops--mostly lemon and lime--in the aftertaste, but there's a good malt body as well.  The coriander and wheat is really nicely integrated with the hops."

"Accumulation brewed by New Belgium Brewing, with an ABV of 6.20% This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a nice white head.  Accumulation is a unfiltered brew. This brew is cloudy you can not see thought it.  The smell is citrus, with some grains and malts.  There is nothing bad so far.  Now for the taste, it is rich with citrus and hops.  You pick upon some grains at the end of this brew.  New Belgium Brewing did a nice job with this one. Accumulation has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is bold and clean.  At first it is citrus with some bitterness ,then it is smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. Thank You New Belgium Brewing."

"O - Solid white IPA - good offering that I would go back to."
"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic. A hazy pale lemon yellow with a thin layer of foamy white bubbles on top and leaving concentric rings of lace on the sides of the glass. Bright and fresh aroma of lemon and pineapple, grass, something else faintly tropical or gummy candy-like, coriander seed, a ghost of pine needles. Palate is refreshing, citric, subtly sweet ... I get more of a session IPA vibe than the expected witbier base, at least initially, although there is a solid undercurrent of Belgian seed spice and dry phenols. Grapefruit, lime, and some mango complement the lemon on the nose. The combination of Belgian yeast and citrus hops recalls ginger root, in a way. Body on the low end of medium with moderate carbonation. Finishes rather dry, with lingering citrus rind, clove, and coriander notes. I stand by my earlier ""session"" assessment, flavorsome yet light and drinkable. Good balance between American hop and Belgian flavors, with the former front and center and the latter playing a competent supporting role."

"This is one of my favorite New Belgium seasonals, and I always grab at least a couple of 12-packs to get me through the winter months."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I can see this as a good choice as something in between a bigger IPA and session IPA. I just find myself wishing it packaged the impressive flavors with a more substantial body. That being said, I will grab a few more of these when I'm in the mood for something with a lighter feel."

"On tap at Lala's, the only interesting beer I saw. Served in a New Belgium globe which was nice, this was a very cloudy yellow color. Aroma was interesting, wheat and spice and hops. Flavor was a really nice citrusy lemon with hint of wheat, this surprised me."
"Overall, one of the better white IPAs alongside Deschutes Chainbreaker!"
"This is a fun beer to drink, but isn't overly impressive. Like I said before, it's your typical New Belgium hoppy beer with a subtle kiss of wheat."

"O - Its a solid White IPA but not my style."
"Overall - What a surprisingly great IPA! I'm sure this doesn't get much respect in the beer geek circles because it's New Belgium and not brewed in some dudes barn on a farm somewhere, but it's truly well done. The hop flavor is bright and juicy, balanced nicely against a very light, crisp malt body. Maybe the only thing I find ""off"" about this release is that it's a winter seasonal, when it's refreshing crispness just screams ""SUMMER!"""

"Overall (3.87) : This one had been sitting on the shelf for awhile (maybe 1+ year) before I purchased it. It was a bargain at roughly $1. I'm wondering if some fermentation didn't happen and now I've got some diacetyl going on here. Overall though, it is an enjoyable beer and even though I don't like IPA's, I can see myself finishing this one."

"Not much snow out there today, but when have these seasonals matched up with reality anyway?  This stuff pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises coriander, pine needles, light biscuit, and grapefruit zest.  The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine takes on a bit of a minty character on the edges.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, a decent ""white IPA", but nothing close to special.  Next."

"Pours a clear, straw color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, floral hops, hint of sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of pine, slight citrus hops, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a strong bitterness. Tastes of earthy malt, citrus hops, slight pine, hint of sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of yeast. Overall, very pale appearance, great lacing, good blend, but too much earthy malt for my taste."

"Poured from a bottle straight into a wide-bodied goblet. Pale straw (2) with a two-finger, fluffy white head with a lot of staying power and significant lacing. Nose is very light with big hints of pineapple, funky yeast, and light sweet malt. Taste is very bready, which seems to be a tendency with several New Belgium brews, and, it’s worth admitting, is not a flavor profile I enjoy all that much in my beer. Also present are light grassy hints, very mild lemon citrus, light toasted cereal grains, generic sweetness, and french fries. The hop presence is there in terms of light bittering, but not in any larger sense of flavor. Finish is mildly bitter, toasted wheat, and subtle sweet citrus. Mouthfeel is light and somewhat slick with low carbonation. All in all, this just doesn't do much for me, which is about par for the course in terms of how I feel about New Belgium products in general. As a white IPA, I was also expecting a bit more in terms of both a fuller hop presence and some Belgian yeast notes, such as coriander, neither of which is present. As it stands, this reminds me of a clumsy wheat beer and not something I’ll be drinking again anytime soon."

"O/D-I enjoyed this brew and find it a bit underrated. Don't get New Belgium in my parts so this was a bit of a treat. White IPAs aren't the most beloved style but I generally enjoy them and this one I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty beer in it's own right, but I can't help but dock the score a bit because it doesn't really have much in the way of the ""white"" aspect of the White IPA--and by that, I mean the spice profile of a traditional witbier. I do enjoy the change-of-pace as a light and refreshing winter seasonal compared to the many winter warmers and darker beers that come out around this time, so kudos to NB for thinking a bit outside the box."

"Poured golden straw yellow with a nice creamy head. It was a lot lighter than I expected. Nose was faint hops with some very slight cereal notes, lackluster nose. The taste is well balance and the alcohol is hidden, this beer is quite a bit lighter than I expected. I give it a C."

"Pale golden hued with great clarity. Minimal wisp of head covers half of the top of this beer. I get a bit of floral hop and pale wheat in the nose. The mouth is moderately carbonated. The flavor is pale wheat and I just get bit a light taste of floral hops."

"Very Pale White India Pale Ale. Nice floral aroma, nice crisp clean mouth feel. An mild citrus finish with minimal bitterness. Nice white lacing . The beer and its hops may of mellowed a bit with age. 6.2 % ABV. A decent seasonal from New Belgium Brewery from Colorado"

"A flavor powerhouse packing a juicy, citrus punch with a nicely balanced hop bitterness and subdued malt backbone to round things out.

"Accumulation pours a see through straw like color with a small but long lasting lacing head. There is a very spicy aroma. The taste has a bold spicy note, some citrus fruits, and a very mild soggy hop flavor. Nice feel, and drinkable, decent flavors. Overall its enjoyable, but nothing special."

"O - Seriously enjoy the S**T out of this beer, the drinkability is high and easy to have more than a few (Look out) it's strong ABV takes it's hold quickly as the third cap is popped off. I will cry the day this beer is no longer brewed, rather hoping for the next winter to roll around. (crosses fingers)"
""
"O - Wow, I loved the flavor of this beer. Something about it was perfect to me."
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer, and would drink it again. At 6.5% abv there is the slightest hint of alcohol in the beer, though nothing like a true high gravity imperial or strong style. It makes for a nice seasonal change for anyone who enjoys IPA or pale ale and is looking for something slightly different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A well made beer, but the hop choices didn't suit my palate. Others may like it a lot more than me."
""
""
"O: I think the Target bittering hop should be replaced with another hop. Its just too dirty, and it imparts earthy and herbal flavours. Almost like fruit that has rolled around on the wet ground. Clean bittering hops like Magnum could've worked better. But, Green Bullet or Willamette would've probably been best as bittering hops, because the dark fruit would've gone well with the Mosaic."
"O: Definitely not my favorite beer from New Belgium (that would still be Fat Tire). I can't say I recommend this seasonal brew. Drink Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale instead."
""
""
""

"Certainly worth a try."

"Pretty ok IPA from new Belgium. Not much mouthfeel or smell but a distinct hoppy fruity balance. Very drinkable. One that I could have afew in the night and not get sick of. Needs a bit more hops but a good beer for non IPA drinkers to enjoy. It's drinkability makes it appeal to me for sure"

"Favorite beer ever, along with Rolle Bolle from New Belgium. Cant help but love the interesting concoction, since I love IPA's and I love Witbiers. Pours a nice light honey-straw yellow, clear and crisp. If the mark of a good beer is lacing, this is king, since I have a shot's worth of beer lining my glass from top to bottom. All around a great drink, and nice at 6.2 abv to accumulate many beer sweaters for cold weather defense. I drank one of these on the lift at Red Lodge Mountain in Montana and it made for a darn fun ride down the hill."

"Overall: A nice beer and definitely worth drinking. Seems more like it's suited for summer as opposed to winter, but a good beer nonetheless."

"Since New Belgium came to florida i have been trying all their beers as they become available in my local package store. Different but great tasting IPA, im a big IPA fan and also a citrus beer fan so this beer goes great for my taste budz. #YUMMMMmmmm"

"An odd choice for a winter ale. Really strange. This would be much more appropriate as a day time brew during the dog days of summer. It's a little refreshing, but boring, and doesn't yield any of the warm and fuzzies that a good Winter Warmer or seasonal Belgian (I'm thinking Goudon Noel) provide."
""
""

"Overall a nice light IPA. Not sure it's a winter ale. It would be just as good or better on a hit summer day."

"Better than good, crisp White IPA Taste is hoppy goodness. Color is Brilliantly golden.  Head a good 3/4 inch  after the poor. Lacing is good at first but dissipates towards the end.  This is a damn good beer. Color is ...oh who cares As I said Damn good beer."
"O: This is a very nice White IPA. Could session on it no problem. Somewhat of a bridge for non-IPA and IPA fans? I'll leave that up to you. Recommended."
""
"Poured from tap into large New Belgium pint glass. Crispy clear with fairly full head, which remained largely in place. Ample lacing, lots of bubbles, good carbonation. On the nose, very nice (almost sweet) floral piney scent dominates, with hints of lemon, grapefruit, grass, and melon. On the palate, the hops appear, but are well balanced by citrus tones of orange, lemon, and grapefruit. Really like how crisp this one drinks, which makes it imminently quaffable. No heavy malts or alcohol are apparent. Mouthfeel is good, if a little thin, but that's OK. This is a very good IPA to sip before trying something hearty. Probably great during summertime as well. Kudos!"

"BBD 06APR14. Pours a clear golden yellow with a very nice head and lacing that lasts. Mild nose of citrus hops, grapefruit and lemon, over a very slight sweetness. Light medium body, on the thin side, that has slightly above normal carbonation. The taste is well balanced between moderate hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit is the dominate hop flavor. Crisp finish followed by a pleasant lingering grapefruit bitterness. A very good beer for non-hopheads."

"very glad they went with an ipa as a winter seasonal, but this isnt not as good as i was hoping ti would be. it doesnt have much head, and is really thickly cloudy with yeast in a pale yellow suspension. the nose is well hoppy with some citrus notes and bitterness, and i get some orange peel too. i am glad the coriander that is in most of these is not so prominent here, its helpful for the hops i think. the flavor is a little all mashed together, with the wheat being denser for winter and a ton of yeast left over. the hops dont taste as bright as they smelled, but they impart bitterness and i find this to be a rather refreshing beer overall, if a bit less refined and sessionable than i was originally after. it went well with a big burger, and i can see this being better in bottled form. i appreciate this as a seasonal instead of the classic malty spice type."

"Fullness from the carbonation really fills the mouth up. Prominent finishing bitterness with a a pleasing lingering. Nice hop flavors and nice pale malt foundation with no apparent crystal or other sweetening grains. A nice format for a hop presentation. The hops get a little ""green"" and weedy, but not bad and still enjoyable. The big carbonation makes it a little too filling. But with all that said I generally like NB beers and while not on the top of my list a nice diversion today and a new way to go."

"Pours a pale gold with a mild haze. White head forms and leaves tons of sticking lacing. Nose starts with resinous hops, notes of pine, grapefruit, and citrus. Taste starts with a Bit of grainy bread notes followed by grass, pine, and a decent amount of bitterness. This is quite tasty and well balanced. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, this kind of reminds me of Daisy Cutter in terms of hop profile and malt presence. Quite drinkable!"

"O- I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. The 83 rating led me to believe this was going to be something else, entirely. I loved how the mouthfeel, flavors, and aromas played together in this beer! If it comes back around next winter, I promise I will have again."

"Overall: Delicate beer with strong hop bitterness. I like it, but it could use a bit more balance."

"Hops and yeast with just a hint of malt. The hop character is nice, but not great. It's a different IPA. It's pretty good."
""
""
""
"O - Over-the-top with nothing to counterbalance the grapefruity hops. Good if you're into that, I guess. But, aside from it's appearance, I can't say it's very distinctive compared to any number of other IPAs."

"Poured a cloudy light gold with decent head and lace on top of a citrusy, strong hoppy aroma with mild spice. Tastes and feels like your average IPA; citric hops, very minor sweetness, dry, crisp finish. A decent beer that was alright to try but nothing special about this IPA."
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (4/5) and smooth (1/5) mouthfeel that suits the beer well, as well as the style (a light-bodied, wheat-malt IPA). Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: seems very sessionable. If I was to compare this to Celebration which is released in the winter time, I'd pick Celebration as the hops are a bit more aggressive. However this would be a great beer for someone who's new to IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this one better than the score shows. I would try this again and certainly not shy away from ordering it in a bar. It is a touch too one sided to rate very well. I do like tropical hops so this one is great there."
""
""
""
"Overall a half decent hop sided IPA with no malt depth and light bodied. I was wondering if there was going to be some chewy wheat body perhaps or something, but this beer just as a style and flavor just feels partially incomplete."
"Accumulation is a good beer. The flavors on the palate are muddled, and the nose is far too soft. And it would be hard to guess white ipa, very little here in the way of phenolic or estery spicing that would get me thinking in that direction. Easy to drink, and unoffensive."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of grassy hops, lemon, pale malt, slightly tart and vegetal. Flavor is citrus and dry grassy hops, pale malt, grapefruit and lemon citrus, finishing with astringent grassy hops with mild, pleasant stone fruit hovering at the edges, but not helping the finish. Light to medium bodied. Possibly the most grassy hop presence I've experienced in a beer, as I'd imagine a beer made with hay would taste. Not much Belgian presence. A citrus, grassy IPA that did not quite hang together for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a nice head, good lacing and very clear as you might expect from a white. Nice hoppy aroma with a pleasant nose feel. Taste is light with a nice mix of hops, something that I didn't really expect. Actually found myself pleasantly surprised by this one."

"might be my favorite NB ipa."
""
""
""
"Overall - worth a try for the price."
"overall a nice changeup from other winter seasonals. white IPA is a bit confusing for me but i'll go with it. the only thing that detracts is the NB house yeast which i don't care for and sort of dominates all the other attractions that this ale has to offer. go try it and form your own opinion."

"O: A nice change for a holiday seasonal but I would describe it as an IPA rather than a Belgian IPA - not a lot of ""white"" to it. Easy enough to drink and enjoyable though."
"It is difficult to do a ""black"" IPA well, as the malts tend to overwhelm the hops; however, it seems the ""white"" IPA can suffer from the opposite problem, where the base malts are too bland to provide the back-bone I'm used to encountering in a standard IPA. A shame this isn't actually a Belgian IPA, as the addition of some phenolic complexity from a Belgian yeast strain would make for a more well rounded brew. A decent beer despite these shortcomings."
""
""
""
"Overall: Looks good, smells good, feels good, but someone forgot to work on the taste (or accidentilly mixed my bottle with half beer / half water). This was so close to a success. If only the taste (the exact taste I am detecting) was stronger."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - not crazy over this one. Too peppery for me. It makes it very hard to drink and discern its other notes. It's not terrible,  but it needs work."
""
""
""
"Pours light golden with small foamy head that quickly dissipates., leaving a small amount of lacing on the glass. Hoppy, citrus smell with hints of pine/grass. Bitter, hoppy up front taste. Slight citrus taste but overall very grassy. Hop bitterness gets stronger and leaves a strong bitter aftertaste that persists."
""
"Overall: A solid hoppy IPA taste. Not much of a ""white"" presence as the name would suggest, but the mix of resinous hops is good."
"Why mess with a good thing? Snow Day was a great beer and im disappointed you replaced it with Accumulation. Accumulation is a good beer also but no were near as good as Snow Day. Its a Disappointment it is not returning as I was looking forward to it in 2013. Bring it back please"
""

"O-I'm not gonna lie, it is mid-December and I have had my share of typical fall and winter seasonals already, so this non-traditional seasonal IPA was a nice break from all the dark, heavy spice bombs. Maybe I'm a sucker for marketing...I dunno. Anyway, this is an alright IPA with a heavy dose of spice and sweetness for the style. It is drinkable, but I'm not sure I would want a lot of this."
"O- I like the hop profile here but it is kind of forgetable. The body is a pretty big let down. Not bad, but not worth going back."
"Overall, this has me scratching my head. I think the individual flavors are nice, but the combination presented doesn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer doesn't seem remotely winter-ish. It's hoppy, like a basic IPA, not overwhelmingly. The color is yellow, plain and simple. It has lemon hints, which is perfectly in line with its color. It almost tastes like a lemon cookie. Besides that, nothing really stands out, besides its fantastic bottle art."
""
""
""
"bottle. light gold and hazy with a medium sized, fizzy white head. Hop aroma is noble and grassy with a touch of lemon. Taste is mildly sweet with bitter finish. Clean finish. Mouthfeel is both smooth and crisp. Texture is light for an IPA. Overall impression is perfect for its name. It's snowy. This IPA does not hit you over the head with hops and leave you disoriented and dazed. It satisfies the same impulse that makes us want ice cream when it cold. It doesn't make sense until you do it. A really beautiful IPA. The hops are where they should be...in the aroma and not in the taste-bud destroying bitterness."
"Overall Drinkability: I wouldn't say this is a missed opportunity at a unique light winter IPA, but a little more crispness and some fruity notes would lend it some great seasonal traits."

"O - I will not be having this again. Purchased a 6 pack of this for $10, kinda upset I'm stuck with 5 more bottles... definitely not worth the price. The smell is subtly awesome; however, drinking this was reminiscent of drinking a bud light. No taste and carbonation that drowns the palate. The only thing I liked was the smell and finish. Other than that, this was extremely disappointing."
""
"Overall - Who put this into the American IPA categorization? This is clearly a Belgian IPA. Recommendation for change will be made. This isn't the most funky or most hoppy of Belgian IPAs; instead a basic, well-balanced representation of the style. While it's miles away from Stone's BIPA, this is the kind of beer I could see myself sitting down and watching a game with, when my thoughts are more focused on sport and not on the brew I'm drinking."
""
"Solid stuff. A style I haven't seen much yet but a good one, nonetheless. I'm impressed."
""
""
" Overall: This is a great White Ipa. Recommend to all hopheads! Comparable to a S.A whitewater yet that Amarillo hop sets it apart. worth $8.99 a 6er"
""
"D: Better than I was expecting. Crushable with the light body and fresh hops. Would make for a much better warm weather sessions brew if you ask me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Accumulation is so ripe with fresh, tropical fruitiness you'd swear there was fruit in the beer but New Belgium's flurry of hops generates the whole avalanche of fruit flavor, piling on top of the beer's perfect wit-like base of grainy pale malts and soft wheat. It's incredibly drinkable and refreshing in a sea of spiced, high alcohol, warming winter beers."
""
""
""
"Overall this has to be the most underrated beer on the site. I get winter beers are generally heavier, but this has to be hands down the best ipa to come out of NB other than the LOF Super Ipa. Reminds me a lot of Lagunitas sucks, surprised it's not rated near as well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. A light and refreshing winter IPA. There’s not enough malt to call it balanced, but the hops aren’t overpowering. I could handle this year round."
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of an IPA, as a Wheat Ale it's not that great and as hybrid of both which is what the brewer intended, it's just ok, the two style aren't as balanced as they could be and it comes off pretty IPA like and not that recognizable as a White Ale. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, clean, not filling, and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these without getting bored or tired of it. What I like the most about this beer is the aroma and appearance, I thought they were both pretty good and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the the White Ale aspect wasn't more apparent, if it was more noticeable I think it would balance out some of hops and make it more of truer hybrid of an IPA and a White Ale. I would buy this beer again, I already got a 12 pack so I don't know if i'll buy anymore this season but I wouldn't rule it out and if they choose to release it again next year I;m sure I will buy at least a six pack. I recommend this anybody who likes hoppy beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, I wasn't flawless, but it still had enough aspects that made this a good beer. Good job New Belgium, keep up the good work."
""
"Beautiful hoppy aroma at the twist of the cap, has a nice golden hue to its color when poured , taste is lovely , sweet with a bit of citrus, not all that bitter , very mild mouth feel and not a prolonged after taste, I am a bit of an IPA junkie and this did not disappoint, easy to drink and would enjoy again"

"I like the flavor on this one. The hop flavor really stands out.bitterness level is average for the style, but the fresh hop flavor is great. My only true complaint with this beer is the light and watery mouthfeel. The light body makes this one easy to drink, but there isn't much substance to it. Would like a little more body. Although it is light bodied, it isn't too crisp to make this one worthless, but a pretty solid beer overall. I will have no problem drinking 24 of these."

""
""
"I know it is not particurally professional to ""slam"" a beer - but potential victims and the brewers must know that, thouth other beers from New Belgium are fantastic, they completely missed the mark on this one."
"Taste is biscuity-sweet, with citrusy hops, a little banana and pineapple, and maybe even something like an anise note. Very light pilsner-y mouthfeel with a buttery finish. As somebody for whom the novelty of having New Belgium brews on the east coast has not worn out yet, this is a really nice winter offering that does the unexpected. Highly recommended."
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a 2-finger foamy white head. Left lots of lacing when sipped. Above average carbonation. The aroma is of some grassy grains with some citrus with not much of spice. The taste was OK at first was was VERY bitter with a harsh after taste. After a few more sips, the bitterness lingered and got worse. This is WHY I don't like I.P.A. types of beer and actually bought this by mistake. Couldn't drink it and poured it out after a few more sips! First time in a long time time I poured a brew out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, making for quite the refreshing beverage. Wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer but I'm glad I picked it up. A nice hoppy and refreshing beverage in a relatively light package that won't beat up your taste buds."

"O-I wasn't expecting much from this beer, and it more than delivered. For the price, a solid winter IPA. (but it is no Celebration of course)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a semi-hazy light yellow with a finger and a half of frothy white head. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, sugar, and orange. Taste is much the same, with pineapple being the primary flavor followed closely by grapefruit. The mouthfeel is thin with moderate carbonation, not much lingering aftertaste. A decent beer but not one I'd seek out again, especially not in winter. Maybe in spring and summer."
"O – Not bad, not great. Would have been happier buying a single than a sixer, but hey. It was unexpected, very bright, sweet and tropical. Does not fit at all as a winter beer in my book, but I prefer my winter beers to be big and rich and boozy. I'd drink this one again, but would be better in the spring when the grass starts growing green again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger fizzy white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is slightly malty with a nice little hop note, very slight citrus note. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some nice hop notes and citrus. Medium body. This is a nice little brew, but nothing I would call a winter seasonal."

"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 2/2/2014. Pours fairly hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, wheat, pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and floral earthiness. Moderate amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pineapple, passion fruit, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wheat IPA! All around great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall - I think this is a great seasonal from New Belgium. It id different than most winter seasonals - you normally think porters, stouts and other dark beers; so it is refreshing to see a white IPA to break the norm. I think this is a great IPA for anyone. If you are not an IPA fan I would give this one a try due to the fact that it is a mild one."

"O - The first time I tried this beer I thought the taste was weak. Upon further sampling, I find the taste mild yet satisfying. I really like the flavor that are in this beer. I could drink this all day. It is actually reminiscent, flavor-wise, of some session IPA's that I have tried."

"This isn't a bad beer, it's just light in everything. Light appearance, aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. I wonder the motivation behind this beer, especially for a winter release. Seems it would do well in the summer. Easy drinking. Mild hops, mild malt."

"Despite other reviews, after drinking I get what they are going for in this white IPA, its cold, crisp and has stone fruit and pineapple undertones. Just like the weather, this is a crisp finishing white IPA that is IMO a welcome change to the hearty filling Winter Warmers that are released en masse this time of year. Good change of pace and a welcome refreshment that appears to a wider range of beer drinkers who want something more than a standard lager, but less than a darker spiced. Going to get a case to keep around for holiday guests"

"A very nice IPA with a fruity after taste. This does taste more like a spring beer than a winter ale. It also seems like a session IPA. I can see my self drinking 3 or 4 of these in one sitting. I purchased this in Delaware since this is not availlable in my home state of PA. I'm glad I made the purchase."
"12 oz single from Trader Joe in Salem. $1.35 Pours a very pale yellow ( for an IPA), large frothy white head..very pale . The aroma is reasonable enough..grassy/lemon hops and biscuity malts. Taste is very nice again lemon,grass,crackers and a bit of wheat. OK Nice enough smooth mouth feel. OK beer but for me more of that ""new style"" IPL than IPA!!!"
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Pretty nice persistent head, and some fair lacing. Nose is yeasty with some savory spice. Yeast and citrus, with something of a paper or cardboard characteristic and a really steely finish. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"O - Nor my favorite style, but well-done overall. I would really like more citrus hop character to balance out the dank, resiny character in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and dirt covered berry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with the Mosiac hops adding a dirty berry like quality that comes through more in the taste."

"Overall: I have to say, not as bad as I expected it to. I still question the move by new belgium to release this beer as a winter seasonal, it seems to be more fitting as a spring time or very early summer beer. One of the more solid beers from new belgium, I still wish they didn't do away with snow day. Idk to each there own. Wouldn't buy this beer (unless on some-kind-of super sale), but wouldn't turn it down."

"Overall: New Belgium typically puts out decent to exceptional brews. You can really do no wrong with this brewery. This beer is certainly not overwhelming but it tastes good and I do not regret trying it. This IPA will not kick your butt with hops but it could definitely make a great session beer."
""
"This a Winter offering from New Belgium. I normally drink thick Belgians, Trappists, Porters, and stouts in colder weather rather than hoppy beers. This white IPA is a surprise though. The label says fruit and citrus, but when first poured the nose is very pine and spruce and the flavor backs this up nicely. When I think ""Winter," I think cold, crisp, air and the aroma of evergreens. So to me this ale is like Winter, or Christmas even, in a glass. A good beer to drink while ""decking the halls."" This clear, white ale has a white head that lasts and there is lacing on the glass. As it sits, more of the citrus aromas come through."

"Not sure why this is listed as an American IPA - the yeast, and somewhat elevated ABV seem worthy of a sidestep to Belgian IPA territory, no? You'd think with the slavish Low Countries attitude of this brewery, one might make that connection. At any rate, a way too yeasty IPA, yeah, I said it, with little to associate it with the winter season - the 'white' moniker being tenuous at best."
""

"Overall this beer is a good APA/IPA but im really puzzled as to why New Belgium chose to brew this as a Winter Seasonal. 2 below and Snow Day were some of my favorite winter seasonals and to replace them with a lighter bodied/flavored pale ale is unfortunate. Would have preferred to see this one as a summer seasonal but its still a solid beer."
""
"Overall: A good beer. Not a west coast IPA, more of an international profile. Nice to see a light colored beer brewed for the winter."

"O - another fine brew from New Belgium, those expecting Snow Day will be surprised, and disappointed if they were seeking malt/hops balance, but as previously noted, not so hoppy as to wreck the palate. Much more of a session beer than most winter seasonals. I'll be buying more throughout the winter beer season"
"	Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste, and just how dang refreshing it was. Our first thought was that it reminded us of the Three Floyds pale ale series. It was not at all close to the same level of quality and freshness that they are able to capture, but it had the same vibe to it, as if they were attempting to recreate that type of profile. To that end, this was a highly pleasurable beer to drink. We also felt that it did the style justice, despite the recent bashing of the hybrid “white IPAs” across the forums here. It wasn’t so much of a blend of the two, but rather a sweetly hoppy IPA, with some transient features of more wheaty varietals found here and there. While we haven’t always been please with New Belgium’s selection as a whole, this beer confirms that they know how to select and incorporate hops across a range of different styles."

"This starts out seeming to be not so bitter, but the already acidic note of the sheat malt seems to add to the bitterness in the aftertaste. The fruit is a pleasant novelty but it's not particularly drinkable. I'll try anything that New Belgium puts in 12 oz bottles-- they are bound to be an intriguing bargain compared to the unending supplh of overpriced bombers."

"Totally surprised with this change of pace, not as bitter as I am accustomed to with their brews and the after taste was smooth."
"Hazy, straw yellow topped by egg white head. Herbaceous nose, with some tropical fruit and pepper. Good flavor with more fruitiness up front, finishing up dry and bitter. I wonder what more malt would do here, especially for a winter seasonal that's lacking body. Is this the equivalent of a lawnmower beer meant to refresh after shoveling snow? It's not bad at all, but it has me thinking spring before the leaves have even fallen."

"O: Interesting. Definitely an easy drinker that packs good flavor and a nice bitter hop finish. Reminds me of Sav Blanc wine with the grapefruit/gooseberry, melon and flintiness which is pretty cool for a beer. I wouldn't peg this as a winter beer but it is pretty solid nonetheless. I usually like a little more body to a beer but in this case it seems fitting."

"Pours a hazy gold with a nice amount of carbonation. Thin white head with a bit of lacing. So far, so good. Smells of lemon or perhaps grapefruit. Also i get some more floral notes in there. OOoo the taste is good. Solidly hopped with a smooth finish. I get more grapefruit in the taste as well as that white IPA taste. It reminds me of the only other white IPA i've ever had, Chainbreaker from Deschutes Brewery except it's more mellow and less hoppy. I love the mouthfeel, carbonated well but with texture in mind, it finishes smoothly. Overall i really like this beer. I wish this was a year-round offering as I really like the idea of a white IPA other than Chainbreaker, for when i want hops and texture without the intensity of the regular and Imperial IPAs."

"I can think of other IPA I like better than this one, but it is certainly not a bad product and it has enough unique qualities- and good flavor- to recommend. It is a unique product and most will find it at least acceptable."

"To good health and good beer."

"O: I'm pretty sure my experience with the nose was an anomaly, but still, I can't really get over the crap aroma. Everything else is pretty solid, though. I'd reckon it is worth trying."
"Check it out if you're a hop head but this isn't worth a six pack purchase imo. Just another IPA on the market. le sigh."

"I had a friend get a twelve pack of this so I thought I would try one. This beer was a white IPA. What I found interesting about this beer was it was almost like looking out my window on a snowy night and seeing snow slowly fall which ties into the name ""accumulation"". The color was a straw yellow with a white fog. It was pretty hoppy. When I drank it, I guy a grassy taste up front and a taste of rosemary on the back end. A little bit hoppy for my taste, but I am not a big IPA guy. Not a bad beer but probably woulnd't buy a six pack of it."

"This is a great IPA. Light, hoppy, fruity, and well balanced. Very impressed."

"Pours a cloudy golden straw with a frothy white head. A refreshing aroma of light floral hops and sweet citrus and pine. Tastes of dry bitter grapefruit with notes of sweeter citrus, green hops, and a refreshing sweetness. Beautifully balanced. Full-bodied and crisp in the mouth. I'd love to see more beers crafted with such wonderful simplicity. This beer manages to accomplish something fresh while projecting a singular purpose without needless complexities. An impressive, mature offering from New Belgium."
"Overall: I really liked this beer, and it makes up for the fall seasonal beer that i had from this brewer. I would definitely recommend this as a good American IPA."
""
""
"Overall, it's the return of Belgo! Without all that darn alcohol. Which I actually liked. OK, Belgo was superior, but this is pretty good. This is like Belgo Light. I'll probably get it again. It's good and the 6.2 makes it a good selection for an evening of football and snow."

"Pours almost clear. Has a pleasant aroma but not my favorite. Almost a citrus smell. The beer does taste pretty good. Well hopped with a clean finish. I've seen reviews that claim tastes of vanilla and malty undertones, I do not taste that. Just my opinion."

"O: A pleasant wheat IPA that brings across that unique Mosaic character nicely. Nothing to go crazy about but solid."
""
"Slightly hazed straw color topped with an excellent, tight, frothy head. Nice bright hoppy aroma...clean lemon/lime, floral hop, and a wee bit of spicy pine. Fresh hop pellets on the tongue as well - general citrusy greenness with a sweetness through the finish. Lively, light bodied, and a bit crisp. I like it...very drinkable and fresh."

"O - Ehhh, not the best offering from New Belgium by any stretch of the imagination. I much prefer the Imperial IPA or even Ranger. Pretty forgettable beer. Not bad but there are a wealth of better options out there."
"Taste is lemon zest, hazelnuts, grainy malt and an underlying grassy hop. It is more simplistic than both Snow Day and 2 Below, and I fear I dont like it as much as either. The hop profile is pretty good, but it lacks depth...not surprising with the pale malts used. Its not a bad beer by any means...in fact, tasty enough for me to buy another sixer at least. But I miss my 2 Below something fierce."

"I'm not into the cloudy looking beers, so as far as appearance I wasn't too impressed, even though it had a good head with lacing all the way down. The smell was awesome - citrusy, strong, and crisp. This IPA wasn't as carbonated as the last one I had, but it's tasted wasn't as good either. Overall, it was pretty decent - not necessarily the first IPA I would reach for, but decent to partake."
"O=as others have said this is a hopped Witbier tropical and fruity if you look at it as such its a good brew"

"This is a very light IPA. I agree with others that it seems more like a wheat beer, but it has the citrusy qualities of a good IPA. It's very refreshing. I'm not sure why it's a winter seasonal; it seems like a great summer beer to me (thankfully I'm in Florida where summer extends on into October). I think it's a pretty great find!"
"It is a disappointment but its still drinkable"

"O: Labeled a White IPA (a new style for me), I would put in the category of a Pale Wheat Ale. Great fruity hop aroma, hops balanced by good wheat and malts. Balanced and easy drinking, creamy mouthfeel my only drawback. Labeled a Winter Seasonal, I could drink this one year-round though. Nice work New Belgium."
