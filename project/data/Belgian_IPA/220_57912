The nose is fairly subdued but I get a bit of the acidic Belgian yeast with a hint of citrus hops.  The taste is intensely bitter citrus hops in the front of the palate.  As it hits the back of the palate you get a bit of that acidic champagne like dry Belgian yeast.  The yeast also provides a nice crisp finish.","Franziskaner","Mar 27, 2015"

Light upfront florals and citrusy fruit, but then also a great depth of farmhouse yeast, some tropical fruit notes, and spicy earthy notes. Lovely lovely beer, each sip keeps you on your toes and bring new flavours.","mick303","Dec 14, 2014"

4,-2.4,,,,,,"Bottle, no date. Beer pours a light, cloudy, tan with a frothy white head. Aroma is citrusy Belgian yeast with it's sourdough bread like notes. To be honest my expectations fell at this point, I have never had a Belgian IPA that I really liked, all that changed. Taste is that same Belgian yeast and citrus from appropriately selected hops, but there is a pleasant malty sweetness that makes this beer work. All too often Belgian IPAs end up too dry and the bitterness is poorly balanced and unpleasant, not so here. Great job. Mouthfeel is on point with that nice stickeyness IPAs should have. Again, great beer.","grammodesguapote","Nov 22, 2014"

Have to say, it is very similar to Flying Dog's Raging Bitch in most all attributes (had a RB just the other day).  Perhaps this one has a tad extra bitterness in finish but overall this is yet another very solid brew from Lagunitas.","bubseymour","Nov 05, 2014"

Poured a golden yellow with a 1 inch frothy head, very well carbonated and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  The smell for lack of a better term is very Lagunita's, I think all their beers have a certain aroma that clearly defines them.  The taste is slightly sweet and bitter at the same time, sweetness up front then a more bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is terrific, very smooth.  Overall another very good beer by Lagunita's, they really have yet to disappoint me in any of their offerings.","TooGood","Nov 03, 2014"

The nose is hoppy, but with a nice malty sweetness thrown in, slightly yeasty, slightly citrusy.. The taste is very nice, hoppy, malty, kinda chewy, and citrusy. Medium body with a nice bitter, slightly dry finish. Overall another very tasty brew from Lagunitas. I'll say it again, and I've said it for years,  for the price it's very hard to beat this brewery.","Wasatch","Nov 02, 2014"

Aroma isn't huge, but I get some slight pineapple, a little bit of slight yeasty funk, and some grassy notes. The taste is much bigger than the smell, with lots of pineapple, mango, and biscuit, along with that funky, yeasty flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, with a lot of carbonation to add some good ""bite"" to this beer. The alcohol is very well hidden in this 8.8% beer.

4.21,2.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass, orange due and 1/2 inch head that stays around and sticks to the side. I had just brewed an all Motueka hop IPA that looks almost identical poured, so I have high hopes from the start. Plus, Lagunitas is a great brewery. It still retains a nice hoppy nose although I should have finished off the bottles long ago for a fresher hop flavor. I wasn't expecting a typical west-coast IPA flavor based on the Trappist yeast and knowing it was an attempt at a Belgian version of the regular Little Sumpin', but it remains very west-coast in flavor profile with just bit of the phenolic flavor profile I expected. Still, it is hard to complain when it is absolutely delicious...just not exactly what I expected. Somewhere between fruity and peppery. Nice bite, but not harsh. Overall, well balanced with adequate malt, but finishes appropriately dry. I will definately add this to my regular inventory.","captaincoffee","May 25, 2014"

Can really pick up on the spice in the taste and it blends well with the citrus, and sweetness. Not a very bitter IPA, with only bitterness at very end. This beer is extremely good. Nice fizzy feel, yet very creamy. Overall this is one great beer form a great brewery. Lagunitas IPAs never seem to disappoint me.","JerUrbans","Jan 28, 2014"

3.81,-7.1,4,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Comparing this Belgian IPA to likes of Piraat, Wild Ale is much different, resembling more an American IPA. American Hops are evident, with a tad of sweetness. Aroma of molasses, pine, and light fruitiness. Carbonation is high, feels almost like drinking soda. Full bodied, non-existent head. Bitter (pleasant) aftertaste lingers for a little bit. Overall, decent Ale, but was looking forward to try this and it did not meet my expectations.","retry4z","Jan 16, 2014"

4.34,5.9,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Trademark aggressive Lagunitas flavor hopping meets a Trappist yeast strain? How could this conceivably suck? Of course it couldn't. In fact is pretty freaking amazing. A peachy orange color, very fizzy, quite cloudy and with a whole shit ton of yeast and hop character on the nose ... Smells AND tastes of sugary caramel malts, saltwater taffy, rye bread, juicy red grapefruit, blood oranges, canned mandarins, pine resin, woody pineapple, and non-descript wildflowers. Spicy phenols abound and remind one of caraway, cumin, and white pepper. These and the strong piney hop resins prevent things from becoming cloyingly sweet, nicely balancing out the influence of the fairly syrupy body and saccharine citrus/tropical flavors. There is a pleasant degree of aromatic alcohol character. I actually brought a few of these to a house party despite figuring that this sort of thing would be too much for most people. In fact two of my good buddies were angry that I did not bring more (""Mmm, boozy pineapple juice""). Apparently a Belgian IPA done right can score new fans and this is a world-class brew, redolent with complexity and yet balanced enough to be drinkable in quantity (but watch the ABV. Seriously).","CalgaryFMC","Dec 21, 2013"

Seeing as this is a summer seasonal, my guess is that this keg had been sat on for a good six months, which allowed the bretty qualities to intensify and the hops to fade. Regardless, this is a very impressive offering from the folks at Lagunitas and one that I will be revisiting when the warmer weather rolls around again.","Damian","Nov 27, 2013"

Nice appearance, good foamy head. About one finger. Smells of a familiar IPA, citrusy and lemony. Just like a good summer beer should. Tastes hoppy as soon as it hits the tongue.

4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet, generates some short head that levels down pretty quickly. Beer is totally clarified and effervescing from the etching at the bottom of the goblet. The nose on this is very interesting. There's candied citrus fruit as well as pine and then some yeasty funk. There is no detectable alcohol on the nose, but pushing nine percent, definitely has a tiny bite to it and a warming quality. Certainly not overpowering though, and seems to be blending in with the hop bitters almost seamlessly. Flavor is citrusy-sweet, some peachiness, mango, and certainly a grapefruit-like bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly sticky, with adequate carbonation. Overall, I like the fruit-funk and hop-citrus combo, and I think this is well done for the style. If anything, I'd like more funkiness to it, but I think they took it to a good place regardless.

There are no sour flavors or funkiness in that regard although the trappist yeast thrown into the mix does give off hints of a slight funk. The Wild poured a golden amber with a substantial fluffy white head. There were loads of the signature citrusy Lagunitas hops on the nose with a bit of funk underneath from the Belgian yeast. The taste was big juicy citrus and fruit hops with Belgian yeast flavors coming through on the end. The Westmalle yeast gave it a bit of funk though not to the Brett levels, but nicely undertoned and complementary to the juicy hops. Loving this one!","brurevu","Sep 05, 2013"

To me the beer tasted similar to the other IPAs (which are really good) they make and didn't have the wild yeast characteristics. I was expecting spice, clove, bubble gum, etc and although I could tell there was something different about this one, the hop profile seemed to just dominate the entire beer.

4.67,13.9,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours an orange brown, with a 1-2 finger head. The head retreats fairly quickly, but leaves some real lacing behind. Smell hits like a regular belgian, though the hop is a lot easier to notice. In taste it's fairly complex. A wall of yeast hits first, followed by a big hit of hops and bitterness. Alcohol is certainly not hidden in this beer. It provides characteristic warming, but also seems to be a bit punchier than I am used to. Alcohol is more of a flavor than a sensation, if that makes sense. The beer is not too heavy in the mouth. I think it's a little smoother than most American IPAs. Overall it's a delicious beer--I'm really starting to warm up to Lagunitas, and it's not just due to the high alcohol content of their beer.","Wukk","Aug 19, 2013"

The dried citrus/wheat profile of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' combines very well with the spiciness and funkiness from the Westmalle yeast, making this very tropical, zesty, and complex overall. The aftertaste goes on forever on this thing. I'd drink it more often if it weren't so goddamn boozy overall - well hidden booziness, at that - but this is better and way more closer to style than most American made officially titled ""tripels"" brewed in the country. Great stuff - I'll always seek this out when I get the chance.","magictacosinus","Aug 15, 2013"

Belgian yeast and sweet malt and spicy aromas down the middle with sharp tropical fruit aromas on the edges and a touch of banana sweetness beneath. Medium bodied with rich, lazy carbonation that tapers to a slick oily finish. Flavor is similar to aroma. Solid bready, sweet malty backbone throught. Intense pugent hop flavors through the middle that turn tropical at the end. A touch of banana sweetness at the finish followed by lingering tropical and pine hop bitterness. A wide variety of aromas and flavors with that signature Lagunitas spicy, malty sweetness.","IronLover","Aug 14, 2013"

4.06,-1,4.5,4,4,4.25,4,"Overall (4.0): As I’ve noted in other Belgian IPA reviews, I have a theory that there are a handful of different formulas that brewers use to create beers that are then classified as “Belgian IPAs”—the hopped-up BSPA/Tripel, the hopped-up saison, the American IPA brewed with Belgian or nominally “farmhouse” yeast, and occasionally you see a hoppy Belgian Pale, Belgian Amber, or even a Dubbel. This is, I think, about as good as the “American IPA brewed with Belgian yeast” example of the style gets. The malt and hop character are classic American DIPA in character; the only real difference is the Westmalle yeast, which Lagunitas manages to wrangle into this beer pretty effectively. For me, it’s still not close to the best of the “Belgian IPA” style (I prefer the hopped-up BSPA/Tripel formula, personally) but for the American IPA w/ Belgian yeast formula, this is easily one of the best examples. Add the pricetag and bang for your buck factor, and this beer is hard to beat.","fmccormi","Aug 05, 2013"

Ethanol present in nostrils and mild burning on back of throat, perhaps a bit too high, even for an 8.8% beer. Aftertaste is expectedly dry, from the substantial hopping and ethanol presence.

Suddsy lacing, receding to reveal oily clear, sticky resinous lacing. Double barreled lacing? Cool. Aroma is a beautiful fruity, citrusy grapefruit with some malty sweetness, candi sugar and belgian yeasty goodness. Taste is wonderfully hopped, piney and grapefruit, mild sweetness with a fruity, yeasty. Ever so slight alcohol presence, amazing for 8.8%. Tongue coating mouthfeel. I guess this beer is the result of mixing two of the worlds best things, pacific northwest hops and belgian yeast.","KickbacksSteve","Nov 18, 2012"

I have to state that I did enjoy this beer for what it was and all the interesting characteristics together and I enjoyed comparing the differences between this and the regular Sumpin’ Ale. Overall, a good Belgian IPA that I would personally have to classify as a double IPA/Tripel/German Hefeweizen. I would recommend this to anybody who really enjoys the year-round available “A Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’ Ale.","Stoutfan23DJ","Oct 22, 2012"

Beautiful, well-developed Belgian lace after each sip. The nose intermingles yeasty notes with distinct hops, tropical fruit, citrus, wood, and cloves. Light and delicious on the palate with excellent balance that hides the 8.8% ABV, but don't be fooled. The ABV is there! Lingers well but leaves a clean palate with hints of hop flavors, hop-bitterness, citrus, and cloves. Moderate carbonation with tiny bubbles. Expected more sourness given the ""wild"" descriptor, however, it is delicious! The moreishness increases as it rises to/above cellar temperature. Would be excellent with rich or fatty foods needing to be balanced with the increasingly evident hop.","carlborch","Oct 21, 2012"

The aroma was not exactly wild, but it was very edgy due to the aggressive hop presence, which asserted itself as papaya, pine, tangerine, and mango. The taste was not sweet like the aroma hinted at. Instead the beer was dry, tart, and smooth, with just a touch of radish like spiciness in the finish. Very delicate in the feel, and very sneaky in the alcohol expression, this was like a dirty Duvel. I like the unusual combination of characteristics that work in this creation.","rajendra82","Oct 19, 2012"

It starts out well with a nice, playful, tasty hop profile, but then the yeasty Belgian aspects tread a little too heavily. The bite of clove, pepper, and spice just seems too harsh and out of place.

3.77,-8,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, golden-yellow coloring with a filmy, sparse, white film coating parts of the surface. Aromas of bubble gum, lilac, and chamomile ride a subtle toffee backbone. Flavors are sharply roasted, with a very spice dominant forward flavor, both from the hops and the yeast strains. Bombardments of pepper and basil from the hops combine with off the wall characteristics of licorice, xantham gum, lemon zest, and cedar. This beer is very tasty, and very ""all over the place," for lack of a better term. The body is smooth, but fairly light and crisp. The aftertaste is has some fruity characteristics, with touches of citrus and tropical fruits trying to balance all the different spiced components. Carbonation keeps the finish light, and slightly filmy, with a spicy linger that continues to puzzle and challenge the tastebuds. Tasty and interesting.","GarthDanielson","Sep 05, 2012"

Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon, pepper, clove, banana, bubblegum, honey, caramel, earth, and herbal spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, pepper, clove, light banana, pine, lemon, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, clove, banana, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of spicy yeast flavors with hop flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish; extremely smooth to sip on. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian IPA. Fantastic yeast character and hop flavor balance; and very crisp and smooth to sip on. Wow, outstanding.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"
4.41,7.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nose is pine right up front. Grapefruit, maybe something like green onion, lemon and some really grassy notes wrapping it all up. Taste is citrus, grassy, grapefruit, some sweetness that is almost honey like. The bitterness makes the mouth pucker in a good way and it lingers around filling your mouth with piney flavors. There's a slight warming in the stomach from the ABV, but there's no heat or booziness in the taste. This is a damn fine brew. Pretty unique while remaining familiar to hopheads.","DonDirkA","Aug 25, 2012"

3.87,-5.6,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. Color is golden, most likely a byproduct of the wheat in the recipe. Appearance is somewhat cloudy, this beer may have been bottle conditioned. Aroma is of bready yeast, with pineapple, grapefruit, and other citrus fruit shining through. With a name like Wild, you would expect this to be somewhat sour, but it really isn't. Instead this feels more like a heavily-hopped Beligian Tripel or Belgian Golden Strong. Not that that's a bad thing. Trademark Lagunitas malt sweentess shines from start to finish, which helps to mask the size of this beer - 9%+ ABV. There's a slightly minerally or metallic thing going on in the finish that I wish wasn't there, but overall this is another nicely crafted beer from a brewery that clearly knows what it is doing.","eclaycamp","Jan 03, 2012"

A golden, copper clear pour with a very generous 2+ finger off white pillow head. Obvious carbonation with decent lacing and rentention. Smell was a bit mild. Some notes of citrus and lemon grass. Maybe a hint of cloves. Taste was surprising for an IPA. It was pretty well balanced with some bready malts poking through the hop bitterness. Pretty smooth and refreshing. Feel was quite a bit of carbonation, but not too watery. Quite balanced. Overall- I was pretty impressed with the balance and flavor of this IPA. Again, not my style, but I've had a lot worse.

Candy pineapples, orange, zesty spices, mint, and something along the lines of fresh soap. Taste is just the right kind of sweet, embedded in a plethora of flavory goodness with a bright, smooth bitter hop tingle. There's a nice candied fruit variety, both tropical fruits and sweet citrus. Chewy caramel and bready malts are all over too. A very nice combo of all sorts of things. I would certainly have this again. Mouthfeel is slick, syrupy, smooth, and chewy. A tad resiny too.

Flavor is like nose; hop on top (?!), followed underneath with slight sweetness, good carbonic tang and, perhaps, a yeast bitterness that all told make this a good drinking beer.

The choice of hops really compliments the yeast. First the dry herbals, then the carmely sweet and aromatic, then with the dry again. There's only a little bit of sweetness that smoothes out the bitter, but after that it's gone. It almost smells like a hoppy saison. There's a good amount of carbonation, but it doesn't show in the head or bubbles. I'm guessing that's because of the extreme clarity of the beer, there's not as many little micro surfaces in the fluid to disturb the CO2.","musicman575","Oct 18, 2011"

The ""Wild", I assume, implies there's some non-standard yeast like Brett or something, but my taste buds aren't good enough to detect it among the assertive other flavors of this beer.

Slight booze odor given off beneath the floral hop and sweet bready aromas, with a ripe something on the very back end.

But....it doesn't make me think of a Belgian Strong Pale. The alcohol is perfectly hidden which can be a characteristic of this beer, but it's a DIPA in flavor. I'm not complaining exactly as it is quite tasty, but I'm not seeing the connection to the style at all. However, I'll give it this - just like Duvel which will sneak up on you, this one will too. High ABV so well hidden, yep, devilish is one way to describe this, but tasty enough that I want another one. So maybe it is this style after all, just hop forward in fine west-coast style. Quite drinkable despite the fact the even with the devil egging me on I should stop at one.","damndirtyape","Sep 29, 2011"

Yeast seems to mix/cover hop smell a bit. Hop aroma that I can detect is citrus-piney and very American smelling. Tastes very a lot like Centennial hops in the flavor. Reasonable malty sweetness to back up the booze and bitterness. Slight bread malt notes as well. Westmalle yeast is great tasting, very clean, but the bitterness hits at the same time and really conflicts in my opinion. I do like the idea of American hops mixed with the traditional Belgian Abbey yeast. Other than the high bitterness this beer has no notable flaws in my opinion. Well crafted and fun to drink.

This definitely has a Belgium slant to it, an Americanized Saison, and for that reason I find this Ale to be just delicious! Overall everything comes together in this ale, the yeast, the malt, the hops, and even the sweetness, to deliver an excellent balanced ale. A pleasure to drink, and for me, despite the virtually unnoticeable 9.4% ABV, an Ale I can drink several of back to back.

Later that afternoon, I had the bartender draw me a sample and sure enough, it's what I had earlier. Maybe I was expecting a wild ale and the name was misleading, as there were no sour characteristics present in the beer. Appearance was golden with a bit of amber and slightly cloudy. Head was a bit on the short lived side and there was little lace. Aroma was strong C-hops, grapefruit and tropical fruit. Flavor was the same. Medium body and carbonation. I would have rated this beer a half higher overall if it were billed as a DIPA, as the hops were too overwhelming.","LittleDon","Sep 18, 2011"

The aroma is of rotten grapefruit, rotten oranges, and pine. It is not an appealing aroma. The taste is hoppy with the same rotten quality of the aroma. I can't detect anything remotely wild/sour in this beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty bad beer. If this truly is a wild ale then it is way too hoppy to let the wild ale qualities come through. As is it tastes like a poorly crafted DIPA. I will not drink this beer again.","KarlHungus","Sep 16, 2011"

The original Sumpin' advertised the wheat, but that doesn't jibe well with most Belgian Strong Pales. I didn't know what to think of this beer. It would have been better without the strong carbonation and bite in the tongue. I guess I could just let it simmer a bit after pouring if I buy a sixer, though. This is interesting if not complex.

The fact that I plan to buy this beer again says that I approve. Go get yourself some and give it a shot. If you like IPA and/or sour beers, you probably won't be disappointed.

3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall this beer met expectations. It was unique and likable but I'm not sure that's enough for me to want to buy it regularly. It's interesting to experiment making a malty Belgian beer and lots of hops, but a heavy handed dose of American hoppiness shouldn't go to waste. That's why the parent beer to this (Little Sumppin Sumpin) is more of a success. Focus on the hops. That's why I say this is just worth a try...","bennetj17","Aug 27, 2011"

4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - Over all this has to be one of the best Belgium style beers I have had/liked. I don't like the Belgium styles much (more of a hop-head).

4.15,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Very bitter of course, grapefruit rind comes to mind as big waves of citrus and pine combine in the taste. Thick mouthfeel, but crisp and dry as well. Sweetness is brief, but there in an attempt to balance some of the bitterness, quite unsuccessfully, but that might be a good thing for me and other hop heads. Malted barley flavors help a little to bring this down to earth. Boozy notes come through as it warms a little, but it doesn't take anything away from the overall flavor. What this beer lacks in balance it makes up for in its in-your-face hoppy quality. Another really good hop bomb from Lagunitas and definitely worth a try.","chodinheaven","Aug 23, 2011"
4.23,3.2,2.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall I though this was a pretty good beer and after everything is all said and done I think I like this slight more then the original beer. I find that the combination of the Belgian yeast with the base of this beer really work well together and help take this brew to another level. I also like the heavier amount of citrus hops that show up in the beer, it makes for a really nice mixture of different citrus fruits. I like the flavor and aroma the most about this beer, everything seemed to come together very nicely and with great balance. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, the color was a little pale and head and head retention was lack luster. This beer had pretty good drinkability, the alcohol was hidden well and the flavor kept me coming back for more, if I had another one I would drink it, I would for sure buy this again. I recommend this beer to just about anyone, if you like Belgian IPA's this beer would be a great choice. Lagunitas has been impressing me a lot lately, every beer I have had from them has been good and impressing, they are making a nice run at being my favorite out of state brewery, they sure now how to use their hops. You guys keep making different variations of this beer and I will keep drinking them.","StoutHunter","Aug 23, 2011"

The smell is of citrus, grapefruit and orange, some yeast funk and spices, very good and sweet smelling. Feel is medium with a mouth coating hop resin. The taste is pretty exceptional, I do get the alcohol boozeiness taste, but there is a good amount of grapefruit hop bite, some nice belgium yeast esters / funk and a load of bitterness on the back end, overall this is an amazing brew, I like it more than the great Little Sumpin regular.

The aroma is medium-high fruity esters, lots of pineapple, some citrus, hints of bready malt, inviting. The flavor is sweet and hoppy upfront, citrus hops, chewy, bready malt. The beer swallows velvety smooth, dries a good deal and a solid hop bitterness emerges. The hop bitterness lingers just a bit with a bit of phenolic yeast character also noticeable. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a tremendous beer, complex yet easy to drink. Very glad I got a full 6 pack, probably should get another.","uwmgdman","Aug 19, 2011"

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Light golden with a big pillowy off-white head. The aroma is slightly sweet, like cream soda with belgian spice and plenty of minty, piney hops.

Big mouthfeel, initial glasses of it demonstrated the yeast, followed by the hops and finished by a lot of malts. The third glass was mostly malt and just a variation of a double IPA, stong American ale. Still good drinkability, but would like to have enjoyed more of the yeast and all the complexity it promises.","Sammy","Jul 30, 2011"
3.58,-12.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a golden orange color with a nice quick fading head that leaves nothing behind. Nose is somewhat subtle but some nice funk with malts and a slight hop presence. Taste is decent. Not quite as in your face as some american wilds but still tasty. Some sour funk finishes the palate with breads and bananas up front. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is a decent brew. More sessionable that some of the other wild ales. Not overly sour but nice complexity.","abrand","Jul 30, 2011"

Another winner from Lagunitas!","ChopperSmith","May 13, 2011"
4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4," The flavor has a good fruity yeast and hop cohesion which gives the hoppy citrus and light tropical flavor with spice from the yeast a lot of room to expand and cover the palate with an array of juicy and peppery notes. The yeast adds elements of melon while there is a rind-like taste from the hops and moderate amount of alcohol in the flavor with mild caramel malt which gives a light sweetness to the flavor but comes forward slightly as it wams with a gentle toasted character. Overall I recommend this to anyone who likes hops and belgian yeast together -this strain is nice to combine with west coast hops and Lagunitas did a good job incorporating in a pleasant way. I think this is drinkable especially for the amount of alcohol in the brew -you barely taste it -A solid offering.","Slatetank","May 10, 2011"

4.47,9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the mystery sweetness. In many aspects this was quite a unique beer, especially for the style.

Light and delicate flavor with a crispness that was very nice. Clean with little in the way of funk showing up here. Light grains and some peach and pear/apple notes that were followed up nicely with the slightest amount of sour flavor, just enough to let you know it was there.

The smell has a lot of citrus to it, but not over bearing! The taste is tart and heavier on the grapefruity....doesnt come off the pallete right away. Lingers somewhat.

The taste is spot on from the nose, mildly sour, sweet, bready, vanilla, and citrus, and such juicy hops. Mouthfeel is very pleasant with a dry finish and mild carbonation.

4.61,12.4,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours out a golden-amber with a sticky, frothy and full off white head. Excellent lacing after each sip. Smell consists of intense pine notes, grapefruit rinds, and just a touch of alcohol. Taste begins with toasted malt character, followed by a wave of caramel sweetness. Spicy resinous hops then barrage the palate, bringing those pine and grapefruit characteristics into full swing, with some lighter citrus notes tailing behind. Sweetness lingers around with this brew, lots of brown sugar and caramel noted. The finish is moderately bitter with just a slight alcohol presence noticeable. Hops leave a lasting impression on the tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this one has a lighter feel to it, much more than expected. Oily resinous hops leave a slick coating and the carbonation is moderate. Overall, this brew is super smooth. There is hardly any alcohol noticeable due to the seemingly intense focus on hop character. This beer is dangerously drinkable and affordable.","jsdunlop","Mar 02, 2011"

The flavor is much more dominated by the Belgian character than the aroma. Lots of pungent clove and bubblegum esters upfront with a healthy dose of honey, candi sugar, and creamy wheat in the middle. The hops come out strong on the finish with lots of bright orange peel and lemon and a long bitter grapefruit note lingering afterward.

The heavy body and yeast almost knocks you down. It is smooth and well balance for being such a strong beer. I taste malt followed by strong hops. It is not boozy like you might expect.

I know this is brewed with a wild yeast strain and i don't know if it is that smell the primarily overwhelms my pallet or something else. It definitely is a wild smell. The taste is right along with the smell, the wild smell carries right onto the tongue. A really wild taste but for all its worth i don't think that it helps cover the alcohol as well as it could; I just mean to say i can tell this is AVB 8.85%.

While certainly adding interest, the qualities encountered here aren't all desirable, compared to their IPA and Hop Stoopid. Once or a few times a year is fine, but this is not a flavor profile the typical IPA-lover would want to be stuck with. While not reviewed here, I did sample this beer on-draft during a recent visit to the brewery and found it to be generally more appealing, with less emphasis on the funk and more vibrant hop aromatics.","beagle75","Jan 11, 2011"

The Westmalle yeast is immediately present in the nose, floral and fruity esters, some sweetness aroma-wise and a goodly amount of hops for balance. Taste mirrors the nose but the hops are even more pronounced, citrusy finish not overly bitter, very interesting taste. Mouthfeel a wee bit on the full side of medium, really active effervescence, a bit sticky of a finish. Scary good drinkability, we didn't have any trouble finishing the bottle and really wish we had another. This was either a really hoppy BSPA or IMP a Belgian IPA.

It will definitely give the palate a workout, but is well worth the experperience.

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Well, truth in advertising, I can always appreciate - a stock (in a good way) Lagunitas strong ale, leavened by the addition of some old-school monk-yeast. The result: exactly what one would expect - a slightly yeast-tinged (a Westmalle joint, yo), usual suspect hop and malt bomb. An interesting experiment, what with the familiar West Coast eye-opener, melded onto a sudden realization of noble Belgian heritage. Wild, in doubt? 'Wild', indeed.","biboergosum","Dec 30, 2010"

Nice sweet fruit taste at the beginning and finishes with a nice amount of hop bitterness and a nice amount of alcohol taste. Medium body with mild carbonation.

Some yeast aromas, too. Kinda sweet with a more upfront pine-almost-grapefruit aroma. I'm also smelling just a hint of melon. Chewy texture, like a thick Belgian Pale Ale, no strong carbonated presence. There's an interesting play with the hops and the 'wild' aspect of the beer. This beer as some subtle 'funk' to it, for sure, but it's not sour. It's more like a tangerine flavor. It plays with the hops in a curious manner. Burnt-sweet malt flavors, too. There's some hope aftertaste with a sour-sweet finish. Lagunitas has a way with their beers, especially when trying to make things come together. Like I've said in the past, all the right flavors are there, just not always working together. There seems to be a little more team work in this beer, but I'm not in love with the conclusion. Definitely worth a try, just not going back for seconds.","100floods","Dec 27, 2010"

A segue into sweet grapefruit hops follows, and by the end, an assertive bitterness leaves me wanting another drink. All the while, a mellow base allows room for all the other flavors to happen.

Smells like a Belgian triple and an imperial IPA (can you say Le Freak). Very smooth, almost creamy texture but not heavy. Lighter bodied than I expected. Very drinkable. The taste is very well balanced. For such a unique beer, there is nothing really overpowering about it but it maintains an appealing complexity. I get hit with the sweet malt and the spicy quality that must come from the yeast. Then the resiny hops come in and linger through the finish but they don't dominate, they just add an extra dimension to the flavor profile. Okay, I'll say it: this is a great beer.

3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22oz bottle served in my Southern Tier tulip. Pours a translucent honey-gold/orange with a loose, half inch, bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a thick, loose band around the edges and a soapy slick across the surface. Some thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests aromatic hops, citrus, a touch of spice (coriander) and maybe a trace of candi sugar. In some regards, it actually reminds me a little of a Belgian IPA. Taste follows nose - definitely comes off as a Belgian IPA/Strong Pale hybrid in my opinion. There's also a subdued tropical fruit character, as suggested by the label, but it is somewhat buried behind the herbal/earthy hops bittering. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a prickly carbonation and a slightly oily texture across the tongue. Citrus astringency lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks.

Again, the sweetness is low, just a little caramel and not much else. Drying and bitter on the finish with some fruity sweetness, this beer is light in body with moderate carbonation. As it warms up, the alcohol does appear, especially on the palate and its interaction with the spice is interesting.

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops along with some bready malt. It tastes mostly like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel), with some pine hops, Belgian yeast, cloves and sweet malt noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. The soft carbonation in this brew makes it smooth and easy to drink.

It's light and hoppy and doesn't give you cotton mouth but actually makes your mouth water. It's very tasty and an excellent interpretation of a Belgian Strong Pale.

Not digging the ""wild"" part of this brew very much. Solid mouthfeel. A lot going on with the carbonation. The drinkability is low for myself as I finished the bomber but struggled on the bitter/sweet combo taste.

3.78,-7.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3,"This poured very well, the creamy but thick white head (I was sad to see it go in a few gulps) and it laced proper, it did. Crystal clear, too, a very light copper or amber, but on the pale side of that spectrum. The bouquet immediately hits with typical belgian yeast flavors (fruit, specifically peaches and banana) with hops (citrus, and maybe a few greener notes) intermingling. Gotta say, it's a nice combination, but, like with the taste, alcohol and (a little) plastic show through a touch. The malts are simply overshadowed by the esters and it finishes very dry (a touch astringent) with those hops (with which they must have been very generous). But again, a nice pairing of fruity american hop varietals with fruity belgian yeast. It can't help but feel a bit hot, and hides it less well than its belgian counterparts or other american IPAs, and tasting the alcohol through, does detract a bit from drinkability. If you want a glass of intense belgian fruitiness paired with american citrusy hops that still finishes dry? This one is for you.","philosobeer","Nov 02, 2010"

Aroma is piney with just a hint of grassy yeast. Flavor starts out as a hoppy IPA, but then fades and finishes with a tad of sweetness. This is a really unique take on the style. Although I agree with some that it may be more a Belgian IPA, its still delicious. The sweetness keeps this from being just another IPA, and therefore very drinkible.

I suppose if I had this side by side with A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' I could find this Belgian influence, but as a standalone, I cannot. The hops are the main flavor influence with plenty of citrus. Alcohol even dominates the limited malt aspect of this beer. Has a nice body with a carbonation that gives a nice soft texture.

The flavor is big: the peach and mint are there with great spiciness - white pepper (I thought this before reading the guy below - so you know it's in there) with an herbal, citrus kick. I feel like I should marinate a chicken in this stuff and grill it. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy but silky smooth, too. I don't get the ""Belgian"" designation. This tastes like an Imperial IPA all the way, with the slight addition of fruit flavors which are up front but soon obscured by the spicy kick. This beer is a serious contender in the strong, ass-kicking category. Damn good stuff. Really enjoyable if you prefer a beer that runs on 220 volts.

Transparent, faint metallic glow to the yellowish-orange color, pumpkin-esque, maybe a subtle brown patina. Typical Lagunitas nose of super-sweet tangelo, pink grapefruit, lime citrus supported capably by pine sap, rose petals, basil leaves and nectarine, pineapple, papaya, peach and litchi fruit, block of milk chocolate, the herbaceousness has more of a savory then green nature. Medium-bodied, the carbonation gives if a fluffy, downy soft mouth entry as well as relieves what might be more fat than the beer can nimbly handle. Mint, basil, sage intertwine here with the orange, grapefruit citrus to temper the latter's sweetness. Not that this is a ""dry"" brew texturally, the hops have bounce but no real bite, lets the cocoa and mocha malts, brown sugar glaze and pine oil the joints. The apricot, papaya, peach, pineapple, green apple fruit can let you both enjoy a soaking effect as well as keep it jogging briskly. Bit of biscuit to scone but nowhere near yeasty.

The yeast character is a bit more noticeable in the flavor, but it is still a weak supporting cast member when compared to the hops, but at least it does a good job with the role it does play; it is not overly phenolic, nor does it contribute flavors that clash with the hop notes, instead it integrates quite nicely with the dominant hop character. Some part of me wishes that this had more characteristics of the Westmalle yeast strain present, but in my hop-heart I know that I would not have liked the beer nearly as much even though this would have ended up a more complex. So yes, this is simplistically hop focused, but there is just enough malt and yeast character to support the hops and to really let them shine here.

Seems like they are following suit and making a hoppy Belgian style west coast IPA. Westmalle yeast strain, brings out banana/pineapple spicy esters. Flavor is competing with the Belgian yeast strain and American brash hop bitterness, sometimes this works sometimes it's a rough combo. Really great tasting version here spicy Belgian yeast with tropical fruit edges/banana/spice and upfront hops with citrus/grapefruit tones.

The fruity hops work perfectly with the Belgian yeast and in the finish it is hard to tell which flavors are coming from hops and which are the yeast. All of this complexity is supported by a lightly sweet and perfectly smooth base of malty goodness that makes the beer eminently drinkable.

Underneath the hop aromas, the Westmalle yeast chimes in with earth, bright stone fruits and some very mild spice. The malt lends a honeyed bread note. It's quite a nice aroma, though much more hop-dominant than any Belgian beer I've tried. The flavor is fairly sweet with an excellently bitter finish. The hop-malt balance is quite nice.

After trying Flying Dog's Raging Bitch a while ago, I've learned that Belgian yeastiness works well with IPA flavors: this beer does not disappoint. It's a bright, rich auburn with some pleasing head that settles into a sparse film. It smells absolutely delicious, floral and grapey and pretty sharp, but pleasantly so. Tasting it isn't a letdown; very cold, it was extremely reminiscent of some Riesling wines I've had, a very sweet grape flavor. Warming and opening up some, it is still a bit grapey but with some great yeasty, bittersweet palate play and a hoppy finish.

The beer is every bit as impressive on the nose, and showcases that telltale perfumy, hoppy nose I've come to expect from Lagunitas. This beer just reeks of grapefruit, spice, and light sour funk. The latter is no more than an afterthought, and just adds another layer of flavor both on the nose and palate. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and reminds me very much of a little sumpin extra, but with the added sour funk. It really enhances both the aroma profile and the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a long, bitter finish. Also, this a West Coast all the way still of wild IPA, so there is very little sweeetness in this beer, and the finish is dry and hoppy/bitter. Drinkability is the only area where this beer drops off a bit. The beer is close to 9% abv., and you can kind of tell. It's not alcoholic or hot, but still, the high abv. wears you out a bit at the end. Regardless, this is another excellent beer from the talented folks at Lagunitas.

Smells heavily of citrusy hops, reminding me of Diasy Cutter and Dreadnaught in that regard. Slight yeast and fresh-cut grass like taste followed abruptly by a heavy hop presence that I knew would be there according to the smell. On the thicker side of hoppy beers that aren't considered DIPAs but it goes down very smoothly. I can tell that the alcohol by volume is higher than most IPAs but not in a bad way.

I like this much better than the regular Sumpin Sumpin, but I'm not convinced it's from the yeast. Grainy, cracjer like malt is overshadowed by the big standard Lagunitas hop bill (I mean seriously, do they only use certain hops for their beers??) and only a touch of clove like, Belgian yeast.

4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I enjoyed several samples of this at the recent ACBF in Boston, this review is from a follow up visit enjoyed at the Birdsall House in Peekskill, NY. Poured pretty typical looking medium almond amber, near clear. Light tan head, that stays at about 1/2 inch, develops a nice looking maraingue and leaves ample sheeting and strands of lace. Floral, grassy, and Belgian yeast/spice nose, yum, my kind of beer. Boldly hopped, notes of light clove, Belgian infused yeasty/spiciness, more then moderate hops presence continuing to exert itself and adding to the sizzle. Quite worthy example of a style that I love. Fine folks at Lagunitas, please make lots more of this one and send it to the NYC area.","Billolick","Jul 01, 2010"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4,4,5,"D- Really good beer overall; the wild element really give is some more complexity over what would just be a hop-dominated beer.","TommyW","Jun 16, 2010"
4.22,2.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Despite its big beer badge of 8.5, this is a supremely drinkable and wonderfully inventive wheat beer from an underrated brewery.","deapokid","Jun 11, 2010"
4.1,0,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazed golden straw color with frothy white cap of head leaving nice lacing. Scent is of belgian yests, floral and tropical hops and a pale biscuty malt nose. Taste is a touch more aggressive than the taste, the belgian yeast and citrus and tropical hops work well together, the background has a slightly spicey and biscuity flavor. Lighter side of medium bodied, actively carbonated, dry. A nice beer that misses being top notch by just a hint of aggressivenes.","rfgetz","Jun 06, 2010"
4.4,7.3,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Medium bodied with a nice dry hop bite up front with hints of earthy pine that are quickly balanced by swee tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as a pale malt backbone that has hits of graham cracker and biscuit. Hints of mango, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon peel and orange along with some subtle spice and a sweet yet bitter dry finish. I'm also picking up some crisp light fruit, mostly apple and pear, and slight alcohol sweetness but overall the ABV is excellently masked. A very unique hybrid of a west coast IPA and a belgian strog ale. Complex, uber fresh, delicious and dangerously drinkable. I have to stop myself from pounding the whole glass down too quickly. Highly recommended!","corby112","Jun 05, 2010"
4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - A nice drink all around, and well worth a try. this is one of those specialties and I don't see it becoming a part of the regular line-up...it works well as a limited. Fun.","JTahoe","Jun 04, 2010"

4.15,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an orange-amber color with a sizeable creamy white bead. Aroma of grapefruit and a touch of pine, with some sweet caramel malt. Palate is very hoppy upfront, grapefruit, pine, anda whiff of astringency. Malt comes through mid-palate, but is still subservient to the big dose of hops. Body is full and just a touch sticky. An interesting deviation in the Little Sumpin series, but still a hop bomb on the whole.","ElGordo","May 19, 2010"
