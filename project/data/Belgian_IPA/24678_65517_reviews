"Very flavorful and easy to drink beer with out the bitter after taste."

"A simple American IPA spiked with Belgian yeast. It works just fine."
""
""
""
""
"Can poured into nonic pint glass. Great citrus nose and golden color. Has a very well balanced hop profile, with the yeasty Belgian feel that this beer promises. Drinkable. almost to the point of sessionable - despite the 6.5% ABV. Very solid"

"The Bros. review pretty much matches my experience (except I didn't detect any tobacco or green bananas). This ale is a real class act. Cheers!"

"Poured from a pint can into my goblet. Caramel colored with a reddish haze. Poured a solid finger of white head with some big bubbles. Aromas of Belgian funk and some banana, and then some nice lemon. Lemon/citrus came through on the flavor side, the funk was very smooth, and there was a nice bitterness to boot. Excellent balance and flavor. Light mouthfeel, more of a nice, clean IPA feel than a Belgian (or at least those I have tried). This was a really well done beer, and the best 'Belgian IPA' that I have tried. I may have to try more!"

"Overall (4.0): This is interesting to me because it kiiind of breaks the mold(s) of other “Belgian IPAs”. Most are some combination of American IPA with nominally Belgian yeast, legit but over-hopped saison, or hoppy tripel/BSPA. This is more like an amber-ish Belgian pale ale with a moderate but well-placed load of mixed American and classic noble hops. That’s how it comes off to me, anyway. That said, it’s not phenomenal by any means—just solid to very solid in almost every way (though I am a sucker for lacing). Definitely worth trying if you’re into the “Belgian IPA” thing."
"O: Overall this was an excellent IPA, the belgian yeast strain and the hops compliment but do not over power each other. Recommended."
""
""
"Overall, a very unremarkable beer. It has a decent appearance although the rapidly disappearing head and the poor lacing detract from it. The flavor does not support the aroma which, at least, supports the claim to be something of a Belgium nature. Perhaps it is significantly better on tap. Worth trying once to tick."
""
""
"Fusion beer-hoppy pale ale. Light brown and cloudy looking beer. Aroma of citrus and pine along with sweet smell from yeast. Can definitely taste the hops in this beer. Leaves a bitter taste in your mouth after the initial sweet taste. Overall delicious beer!"

"O- Pretty decent Belgian style IPA. For me it's a little sweet. But being a hop head and trying to rate fairly per style I think this brewski is a better than average representation. Not a favorite of mine but will do in a pinch."

"The mouthfeel was medium bodied and it had a smooth, modest carbonation."
""
"Poured from a tallboy can into a pint glass. Huge head with lots of lacing. Tough to get a decent pour out of a can. Just another reason to love bottles. Color is a coppery amber. Smells a fruity cooper aroma. Tastes as it smells, no surprises, bland grapefruit and mild copper taste. Mouth feel is thin and not memorable. I love IPA's and DIPA's and this is not one of the better offerings of the style. So many better craft beers out there. Pass on this one. And pass me a Two Heart!!"

"Overall: a well crafted Belgian IPA worth seeking out."
""
""

"Nothing short of amazing, very well rounded with no compromise when it comes to the American IPA part of this brew. The Belgian side pulls its own weight; rustic but very drinkable. One of the best things this brewery did for this amazing brew is packaging it in a tallboy can. Hell yeah!"
""
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent twist on the American style IPA - really like the dry finish and hop character."
"Golden brown pour, slight haze. Four finger, off-white, highly perforated head that persists. Sweet, yeasty, bright floral nose. Faint medicinal and bubble-gum notes. Forward malt on the palate with hints of burnt candy sugar and lingering hop notes. Perfectly-balanced sweet and bitter. Beautiful, thick Belgian lace. Certainly moreish. Refreshing. The ABV is not evident. Some flocculence at the final pour."

"Poured cold into a pint glass this brew has a clear, calm, caramel-copper color with a fair off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma offers a very solid bubblegum, floral hop with delicate grain some cotton candy sweetness. very nice and just what I like in a BIPA. The flavor comes on with a slightly more subdued bubblegum with more of a yeasty bite and bright wheat and sweet corn. The body is medium light and there's a fairly lush feel from the frothy carbonation, but it hints at a bit of a watery quality at times. The taste really is a minor let down after the attractive smell that introduced it. But it's certainly a good brew. There's some apple and pineapple ideas here and I guess I have to identify some clove, some general spiciness and pumpernickel bread. It seems to get better as it warms up. Nice brew but there are others I like better for this style."

"Overall Drinkability: A wonderfully quirky IPA."
""
""

""
""
"Overall, a solid offering. Very drinkable, good with pizza. I'm not embarassed to say I prefer it to other IPA's. It doesn't taste like reefer madness or diabetes."
"Semisweet earthy yeast flavors play nicely alongside a mellow hop profile. Dry, slightly metallic mouthfeel but highly drinkable. I'm really developing an appreciation for Vivant. Well done."
""
""
"Overall a stellar Belgian IPA and I love the fact that it comes canned. They find a grat balance between the Belgian yeasty, floral characteristics and the hoppy bitterness. I wish it was easier to get in my area."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Regardless, DEFINITELY seek this one out and try it for yourself. For the love of GOD, do it! And YES, I drank this beer sober."
"I'm going to go out on a limb here and put this up as one of the best IPAs that I have ever had. If you strictly love the hops, then this won't be a great IPA for you. However, if you enjoy Belgian style beers and also enjoy American IPAs, this is a good mix of the two. It focuses on the hop aroma and bitterness, but still has that farmhouse flavor that Vivant always looks for. I appreciated this adventurous IPA."
""
""
"Aroma & Taste: Nice hop notes of herbs and pine and medium body. Slight malt notes to it. Overall the beer had good hops that added a nice bitterness to the beer. The beer didn't take to long to finish with no lingering bitterness."
""
"The Triomphe Belgian IPA from Brewery Vivant was pleasantly surprising. It had an orange or amber appearance with a full body. It had a strong smell of hops. The flavor and mouth feel were very full-bodied. It was both rich and heavy but a great beer all and all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lovely orange color. The smell is quite sweet and fruity, without any spice or funk. Flavor is too sweet for my tastes, with a lot of cherry/orange and only a little tartness. A nice beer, but I'd prefer something with less fruit, more tart, and a bit of earthiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It was good but it could definitely use some work. The rotten aftertastes have got to go. I'm sure Vivant could work on this very well."
""
"O - I had one when I bought it two weeks ago and hated it. Today it is not as offensive. I'll chalk it up to being drunk the first try."
"Pint can pours copper with a tall, rocky, ivory head that holds excellent retention and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Awesome nose with floral hops, fruity, tropical notes, citric, spicy Belgian yeast. Tastes are a nice balance of sweetness, bitterness, and complexity; fresh grapefruity citrus shines through the caramely and biscuity malt. Fruity and spicy notes come through with the Belgian yeast, finishes bitter with some pine and astringency. Thinner body, but ample carbonation. Overall, it did pull through in flavor even though it didn't quite live up to the initial wow factor with appearance and aroma. Definitely recommendable."
""
"Not a bad beer at all. I bought it for my can collection, but would go out of my way for another."
"Good mouthfeel. Nice beer overall."
"O: Great brew from Vivant. I don't know why I've always hesitated picking this up, but I am definitely going to pick it up more often."
"There’s a boldly hoppy aroma that states its presence, sharp, crisp and strawlike. The flavor is hop forward with a strong straw presence that finishes with some orange citrus. Very light “Belgian” character, to be honest. This strikes me more as a straightforward IPA with some floral notes at the end, which I suppose is the Belgian aspect. A nicely enjoyable blending of styles which I enjoyed. I certainly won’t have any trouble working my way through the remainder of the four pack."
""
""
"Overall, I find it to be a very tasty and approachable beer, very friendly to food. I am guessing it would be a little more versatile with food than most IPAs. The Belgian notes? Meh. Id like some more phenols and fruity esters to give a more characteristic Belgian flair."
""
"The idea for a Spelunky drinking game came to mind during this beer: every time you die, you take a drink. Could be deadly. Anyway, this stuff pours a partly-cloudy sunset amber topped by a finger of slightly-glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises pine resin, grapefruit rind, light grass, and very light Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a good amount more grapefruit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice Belgian IPA. Though nothing amazing, it'll definitely quench your BIPA thirst."
"c/3 = Average"
"Taste again shows great balance and has a firm, assertive malt presence. The yeast gives it more of a phenolic flavor than most of this style. Hops are grassy and don’t seem to fight the yeast as much as a tropical or overly citric variety. Mouthfeel is a tad watery; despite the sweetness...maybe some more CO2 is solution would be better. This is a good beer, I think it is one of the better Belgian IPAs I have had, admittedly not a favorite style for me."
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper with a beautiful head and steady lacing. The smell is fairly sweet, with the yeast and clove prominent, and it tastes kind of like a mulled IPA--citrusy hops but also cinnamon, clove, even a touch of nutmeg? I'm digging this one. Mouthfeel is also creamy and smooth with a pleasant lingering spice. Will definitely buy again."
""
"O- This beer has a great blend of fruity and abbey yeast characters that blend with nice hops flavors. The beer is fairly dry with is a good balance with the fruity flavors. It just loses the aroma to quickly. Very nice Belgian IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours coppery bronze, like so many of them. Smells a little sweet, like a distant bakery, and malt, and grain, and breads, and only sweetish fruits and desserts. Taste is malt and sweet, and biscuits and some bitterness, but subdued for an IPA. It has the feel of a Belgian, that's for sure. Mouthfeel is fussy and refreshing, and zippy and dry...great here. Overall, a fine offering."

"A quality belgian ipa. It was also nice to have with some brisket."

"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and a slightly above average example of the style, it was going in the right direction but it seemed to be a little rough around the edges. It had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and refreshing, I could drink a pint or two but that would be my limit. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the drinkability, this beer looked really good and was much more drinkable then I thought. What I liked the least about this beer was that the flavors seemed just a little muted and not as intense as they should be, it might be a little old but with no canning date I can't be sure so I'm holding that against them. I would buy this beer again, I would like to try it fresh and I would recommend giving it a try if you are into this style. All in all this is another solid beer from Brewery Vivant, it seems to me that all their beers are pretty solid at the least and that is really reflected in their three year round beers, I would say this is my second favorite, with Solitude being my favorite and Farmhand being my least favorite. Good job guys, you make some quality beers and you can beer sure that I will be waiting for the next new brew from Brewery Vivant to hit the shelf's, I see good things in the future for this brewery."
"Overall, I have been to Vivant and know they are better than this. Try a different style of theirs."
"This is my kind of beer with good hop flavors and bitterness built around good belgian characters of fruit and spice."
""
""
""
"Reddish brown, slightly hazy with a good cap of offwhite head. Nice lacing and good retention. Nose is quite yeasty, light spicing, some tropical fruit notes (pineapple sticks out) and perhaps a bit of citrus zest. A good sweeter malt character is evident. Taste is yeasty, grainy breads, light citrus notes and the pineapple is less pronounced. Drying feel, but not too much in the way of body or mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, a pinch of spice and alcohol in the finish. A bit bitter. Not a bad Belgian IPA, but really doesn't put everything together in a way that I dig."
""
""
"O: This beer looked great, but the rest was pretty ho-hum. I'm a little spoiled with Live a Rich Life/Shark Pants at my disposal, but I digress. Pretty average for this relatively new style, but I applaud the effort. A little more balance between the malts and the hops and it would be much better."
""
"O - Certainly not one of the better Belgian IPAs I have had. Tastes like a very malty, floral IPA and lacks the belgian flavors associated with the style. I suspect that this beer is past it's prime, but I can't find any canning date. Not terrible, but I didn't really enjoy it."

"Thanks to Justin for sharing!"

"A bit better than average for a Belgian style IPA, but a very interesting offering for a pounder can. I'd like to try more of there stuff, but unfortunately they aren't in the Pittsburgh area."
"Overall: Its almost 3 beers in one. A farmhouse, a hefewiezen, and a weak IPA. Its nice beer with decent complexity, but I wanted more hops from this beer to withstand the strong belgian influence in this beer from the yeast. Its still a nice summertime brew!"
"Overall a great twist on the normal IPA. Would love to see more breweries take a stab at this. Cool brewery too, worth a visit."
"Too much boiled vegetables. No sir, I don't like it."
""
""
"Pleasant IPA, an American IPA moderated by the Belgian yeast flavour.Citrus hop. A different hop would have added some differentiation. Light coloured body and light coloured though substantive head. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty good drinkability. This beer would do well in Ontario."
""
""
""
"O: Great beer for a style that, for me at least, misses the mark more often than not. I'd love to get my hands on some more of Brewery Vivant's beers."
"16 ounce can into tulip, no canning date. Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 3 finger dense khaki head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clings to the glass; with decent carbonation streaming up. Aromas of grapefruit, orange, caramel, pine, herbal, bread, and yeasty spices. Nice and well balanced aromas, but on the weak side. Taste of big grapefruit, caramel, pine, herbal, biscuit, orange, and yeast spices. Good amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, and yeast spices. Great balance of hop flavors, bitterness, and Belgian character; with a hop character being a little more pronounced. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Drinks fairly easily at 6.5%; with only a slight alcohol warming after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian IPA. Has the Belgian character without going over the top; and still retaining good hop flavor. I really enjoyed this one."

"overall, it was tasty, but there were some flavors and feels that just did not mesh well together. some good points to the beer, but overall, it fails to come together into anything more than an above-average beer."

"An easy-drinking and tasty Belgian IPA from Brewery Vivant."

"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. The flavors are distinctly Belgian, but I can't help but feel that the IPA influence is lost within the mix. This isn't very hoppy at all, which loses it some points for the style."
""
"O: milder than what I expected and that's a plus, an easy drinking well-balanced Belgian IPA"
"O: a decent brew...but I think there's plenty of Belgian IPAs out there that are better... I'd probably revisit this though, to get a better feel. The one can that I have may not be quite enough to give a fair judgment.. freshness? Possible updates in the future..."
"Tastes fresh and lively coming from the can. Just does not taste particularly Belgian to this drinker."
"deep golden, straw color coming forward right away. Nice two fingers of white foam quickly come up and over the top of the glass settling down with a nice amount of lacing that quickly takes over the glass. Very cloudy, even through the final pours. First thing I notice is the aroma of honey, lots of grains, bready malts and a noticeable amount of honey, whether intentional or not it is there. Grape skins start to come forward now as does a light touch of grass, nothing really bowling me over though. First sip is very smooth, rich and well carbonated the flavor is allowed to explore the palate quite nicely and really makes for a very full feel. Light grains, pears, peaches, apples, all seem to be well represented,"
"Overall: A good representation of the style. I enjoyed the fruity notes along with the hops. I would have another."
"Serving type: draft"
"Interesting but not so pleasing. Some malt flavors but more on the sourish side. Meaty and bitter at the same time Minerals and salt. Definitely worth a taste on tap, however."
"Overall this is a fairly tasty beer that leaves me wanting a bit more. More flavors and a bit more interest would take it to the next level. Brewery Vivant has proved that they can make a quality beer, but I have yet to try one that really tugs at my heart strings."
"O - A nice beer. I like the combination of the belgian and the IPA. It combines the fruity aromas and flavors of a typical belgian with the hoppy flavors of an IPA."
"Brewery Vivant 4packs are tasty and perfect drinkability for watching football. I have been impressed by their Belgian styles and farmhouse ales."
"This is an excellent beer and I will definitely be buying it again. This is easy to drink and I really enjoyed it. Pleasantly surprised. Do try it!"
"Lighter bodied, plenty of carbonation and easy to drink. Pretty solid. Once again, probably greatly depends on the freshness."
"Overall it's an ok beer. Does most things good, but nothing great."
"D - Very drinkable. The beer feels a little off balanced with the hop flavor really not standing up next to the strength of the yeast and malts. I like the depth of the yeast flavor, and just a bit more hops could make this a winner."
"I would gladly trade two Schlitz tallboys for a pint of Triomphe."
"Brewery Vivant did a pretty decent job with Triomphe, but it could easily be improved with a little more of everything. More hops, more Belgian yeast, and more body would do it. It’s not bad at all. Just needs to be dialed in a little. It won’t affect the score, but I do like the can. Belgian beer in a can…who would’ve thought? It’s alright. Definitely worth a try."
"O: An above average, but not overly exciting beer. Flavor is predominantly malt and the watery mouthfeel is a bit distracting. Even the Belgian aspects of this beer are downplayed. Drinkability is good."
"Ah, the auditory portion of tonight's program, otherwise known as the Crack & Glug. The opening overture to any symphony that may or may not proceed, but you will never get it from a bottle. I am simply astounded by the way that each of them has produced a thick, dense layer (anywhere between a finger to two or more fingers) of head and even more so by its sustainability. ""Beer Drinkers Get More Head", so reads a patch on one of my many jackets and if you are drinking a Brewery Vivant beer from a CAN, truer words were never spoken. Then the lacing ... This World, and Then, the Fireworks, or in this case, the elegant, delicate lacing that makes me want to drop to my knees and lick every succulent inch. Whoops! I have been warned against such digressions and so we return to the beer. A deep orangish-amber in color with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Is it hot in here, or is it just me? The nose was absolutely floral, like being in a hops field, but underlain by a light mustiness. This is the equivalent of one of my neo-hippie redheaded girlfriends distilled into a glass! I have known you many times, my darling, and you are always unwavering in your intensity. The mouthfeel was full and big-bodied and I could name names, but I won't. The spice of the hops intermingled well with the sweetness of the malt and suddenly I was in the back seat of an Oldsmobile the night before a deployment in 1993. I remember you well and I hope that you have the same fondness for my memory. The finish was dry, bitter and lingering, the same way that each of my redheaded relationships have ended. I need merely to lick my lips to conjure up a memory of each and every one of them, but to what avail? A slap across the face, perhaps spit upon like a llama being told what to do, or worse, a knee to the groin. C'mon, baby, I love you, but your intensity is sometimes too much even for me. As to the cooler, me and my redheads NEVER went to the beach. We were all big on movies, especially screened movies, which is one of the things I do miss about California - the ability to buy beer at the cinema or to sneak it in and not have anyone care. A movie marathon, a CAN of beer and thou, or words to that effect. Oh my."
"Overall, perhaps a bit pricier than its worth, but a tasty example of the style."
"Drinkability: I could have a few of these. It's the best one I've had from Brewery Vivant so far."
"Overall a very low-key, very balanced Belgian IPA that earns high marks for dinkability (and container portability)."
"The appearance is a nice Golden Clear color with wonderful white head retention that seems to be lacing. The smell is frothe with pine and citrus undertones. The taste begins with nice cirtus start hints of grapefruit that then pass to lean more towards apricot. The taste does not linger long comes off the pallete quick. The mouthfeel is awesome and could session this one! Its nice."
"I'm glad I picked this up and am looking forward to the other Brewery Vivant singles I unexpectedly found on this trip. I'll grab some more on my next trip to Michigan."
"A quality beer, subtle for an IPA, without the quirkyness of the Belgian versions."
"Cheers!"
"O: good stuff from Brewery Vivant"
"4"
"D: Tasty, light and thin. I'd be alright ordering another. I probably won't buy again. Bummer cause I was psyched about the idea of a Belgian inspired brewery canning tallboys in the vicinity!"
"Overall- very good and well repped Belgian IPA."
"O - I would have to say they nailed the style with ease. A wonderful brew. I would have to think this brew is quite underrated. Thank you for sharing Another6Pack."
"Thanks to hurfer for opportunity. "
"Overall a great beer and a near perfect representation of the style."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. If I lived within 3 hours of this brewery I'd be making a trip there this weekend to try some of this, and their other beers on tap, and also take some more home with me. Having only one can of this is just a tease!"
"Overall, this brew is fantastic. Perhaps even better than the tap version I can compare it to. It manages to project a cleanliness and flavor that are just superb. I will definitely be putting another quad pack of this in my fridge soon, which is a statement I don't make all that often given the sea of quality we craft brew enthusiasts swim in these days. I am excited about this brewery. Solid drank."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this. With the can packaging, this is going to be an epic summer beer out on the boat."
"O- It's a solid beer. It could be a little more bold, but I'd definitely buy it again as an easy drinker. It seems like it could be a good multi-purpose beer. It was really nice on this warm spring day. Potentially good paired with food."
"This is drinkable but feels a bit light for the style."
"D: Would drink another."
