"O (4) - Overall a solid beer.  I've never *loved* any of the Peace Tree beers, but they're all good.  This is no different."

"A little on the bitter side at first"

"Nose herbal fruit with light graham cracker. Pours amber with a slight haze under ½” head that dissipates to a thin film but leaves tons of lace. Palate starts hinting of fruit then blossoms into melon flavors that dissolve into a big, drying bitterness with a touch of herbal astringency. A light graham cracker slightly sweetened with caramel lies under the fruit flavors. Medium body and slightly below medium carbonation."

"O - The strong aromatics call out Belgian yeast but the decidedly American hop profile overcomes and makes the flavor it's own, both aspects working together with some harmony. It's in the feel that this beer falls somewhat flat - literally. It's hard to peg but even though this beer is carbonated, it doesn't feel like it so even though the direction in which Hop Wrangler is headed is a fantastic one, it's not quite ready to ride off into the sunset just yet."

"OVERALL: I will most definitely pick this beer up again when heading through Iowa. The other beer of theirs I had was infected and I was bummed, but this is fresh and delicious. Very solid offering."

"In the end the bitterness is too emphasized. not very pleasing and too much."
""
""
""
""
"O: My overall experience was fair, but could be better. I will give it another try due to the fact of the bottle being ""damaged""."

"Overall: good. More balanced than most. Love the stubby bottle.t"

"O: One of those ""sum is greater than the parts"" type beers, a tasty take on a style I like - one I'd probably drink often if I lived in Iowa. Alas, I don't. Tried it once on tap there; it's every bit as good from the bottle."
"While perhaps not spot on compared to a Belgian brewed IPA, Peace Tree does a great job with this and the generous flavor character is very desirable."

"I’m really enjoying my first Peace Tree beer, and I look forward to trying more of their beers. I probably wouldn’t buy this IPA often if I had access to it, but I’d enjoy it from time to time. Then again, as it continues to warm, that Belgian yeast finish is growing on me and reminding of the enjoyable Devils Backbone Belgian Congo Pale."

"Cloudy copper, very carbonated, producing large heads with every bottle. Smell is sweet and caramely, with familiar tones of Belgian-style yeast. Flavor is drier than you would expect from a Belgian styled IPA. Has a metallic twang, and a sizable hop bitterness. Versus the style, it is what I would expect a Belgian IPA to be. The beer feel think, but the champagne-like carbonation really cuts the underlying viscosity. Definitely worth checking out, maybe the best beer from Iowa I have had to this point."

"You could definitely use this as a hot summers day beer or a good introduction to IPAs as it isn't as abrasive as west coast styles or as heavy as english/belgians."
""

"That said, this Belgian is drinkable and almost pleasant. If only the label on this one even hinted at the cross-cultural nature of this one (beyond the paragraph on the back). It's a Belgian for hopheads or an IPA for Belgian lovers, but it's a long way from a straightforward IPA."

"Served on tap at el bait shop. Pours an orangish color with a half finger that leaves a nice lacing down the glass. The nose is a little fruity from the Belgian yeast with some grapefruit hops. Palate is similar. Starts off with some cereal and caramel Malta that transition to some fruitiness. Ends with a very pungent onion. Pretty solid Belgian IPA. I think hop sutra is better, but this is delicious in its own way."
""
"O: A decent Belgian IPA. Don't know how fresh but the hops definitely take a back seat to the Belgian side of it."
""
"An interesting mix of (Belgian, English, and American) ingredients combine to make for a unique style defying IPA."
"Mostyly bitter, resiny palate with a little tartness. Taste more like an American IPA than a Belgian IPA to me. Still, not a bad, beer and I'm happy I got to try it."
""
""
"O. Average Ipa, would most likely pass this up if it was alocal on the shelves unless priced very reasonably."
"Overall- The hop mix in this beer is very good, smells and taste great. The feel is a little off and I’m not sure what makes this a Belgian IPA when I drink it. I think many could easily agree it is an American IPA. It is still a very good IPA nonetheless."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with modest carbonation. I was glad to try this one but also not one I would seek out."
"O: This was one of my favorite beers last summer, and hard to imagine I haven't had it since then. Plenty tasty and a good choice for when you want a nice, dry IPA."
"O: I'm not a fan of Begian IPA's. However this one was tasty and easy drinking."
"It wasn't until writing the review I found out this a Belgian IPA. I was at the bar thinking it had just standard flavor and less intensity than others, but for a BIPA it's nice. It does have the added fruitiness, some lemon and maybe a bit or orange. It has a bit of a kick but levels out towards the end. It looks and smells pretty and has s nice body to it."
"the aroma is light citrus aromas, lemon, with hints of banana, light clove and grassy notes and a touch of light bready malts, well rounded i have to say.as i take the first sip, crisp, clean with a nice touch of lemon zest that cracks the lips. smooth yeast notes and light banana then grace the palate and leave a light fruit flavor that mingles well with the grainy malts on the way out. light dry, clean and smooth finish"
"O- I am very glad I had the opportunity to try this. I do feel this is one of the better American takes on an IPA with a Belgian twist (not that I have had a ton yet, though); but I just can't find myself to enjoy these more than a straight west coast IPA. Well balanced and drinkable. Definitely doesn't feel like a 6.25% beer. Though it lacks some aspects I enjoy in my IPAs, it makes up for it with its execution in other areas. I recommend this beer to anyone who could try it! Thanks again, Matt!"
"Overall: A more than solid Belgian IPA, which has some nice English IPA components in addition to the expected American hops. The beer may be a little too yeasty, as I learned you really do need to leave the sediment in the bottle (which is almost the last 2 ounces), or it takes over. A little amateur and homebrewish, but very tasty nonetheless."
"Moderately bitter with pine, dried orange peel, and herbal hop flavors. Dry, moderately bitter aftertaste with a resiny feel that sticks to the teeth. Medium to full bodied with the extra yeast. Ironically the brewer recommends decanting off the yeast... i'll review the bottle sample soon for a better comparison."
"Drinkability: Again, the yeast triggers bad memories of their saison, but this is a decent IPA. I would prefer it not be Belgian-style, but that is not Peace Tree’s thing."
"Okay I went back to the bottle and sniffed the sediment which the bottle specifically said not to pour, and all the sharp bready aromas from the Belgian yeast was there. I wonder how pouring the whole thing, residual sediment and all, into the glass might have changed the aroma and taste. Now I really do wish this were more readily available! Good, complex stuff."
"M - Perfectly viscous for an IPA. I've definitely had more than a few that feel like i'm drinking hop-essence water. Good carbonation that tickles the sides of the tongue and on the lips."
"Pretty solid IPA. One of my favorite beers to come out of Iowa."
"Great work to the people at Peace Tree. This is my first six pack of your beer, and I will buy some more later!"
"A nice beer that falls somewhere between an English IPA and a Belgian IPA. Not as hop forward as I was expecting. The beer does drink pretty well. Glad to have had this one."
"A high hop beer that worked well with the Belgian malt and yeast."
"D - I really liked this one. All three Peace Tree beers that I've tried have been very good."
"Pours a clear light amber color with a finger of head and spotty lacing. The aroma is boozy and a bit medicinal, with notes of spice and clove as well as a floral hop bouquet. The flavor is lighter that the aroma suggested, there really isn't a ton here other than some medicinal hop notes and light grassiness. The body is light. Overall this one was drinkable, but completely unmemorable."
"Quite nice, this style is hit or miss but Peace Tree has done it well. Good to know that good beers an get brewed in Marion County, Iowa."
"Get rid of the fire-phenol thing and this would be a solid beer."
"D. Easy drinking. I would actually say this is one of the best Belgian IPA's I have had. Very nice Iowa beer."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a good head retention and plenty of lace. The aroma is a great fruity oarnge and fresh hop with some of that fruity British maltiness. The flavor is awesome with lots of fruity hops, some pineapple, some orange and a mild bit of grapefruit. There is a nice herbal character as well with a bright maltines shining throguh while maintaining a fairly dry character. Really tasty stuff."
"All the parts are good, and this a nice and fairly interesting beer, but it doesn't cohere into anything special. It's just the sum of its parts. That's it."
"D: Decent little IPA from a little Iowa brewery; maybe not quite the right balance just yet between the American hops, English malts, and Belgian yeast, but I love the concept and the beer definitely has its moments; so although not spectacular, it's worth a few pints"
"The flavor amps up the spiciness, as the Belgian yeast adds cracked white pepper and to combine with zesty, minty, herbal hop notes. Drying malt suggests toffee and woody tannins. Mouthfeel is crisp and well-carbonated, with a medium consistency and lingering hop kick. All in all, an excellent interpretation of the style. Peace Tree didn't really impress me with their Rye Porter, but Hop Wrangler is superb! Give it a try."
"Notes: Really a good beer, especially for a new brewery. Very good example of a Belgian IPA with distinct flavors from all three countries coming out well. Definitely would recommend this."
"So, Peace Tree Hop Wrangler 3 is a solid effort that doesn't come close to challenging the greats of the style. It is encouraging, though, that an Iowa brewery can brew a Belgian IPA that has many more positives than negatives."
"Pours a rich, deep dark mahogany amber. Fairly clear body with a large, dense khaki colored head that fades to a film with some bubbles and large amounts of dry, sticky web like lacing. Aroma is odd...citric and caramel dominant with a musty and smoky (as in ash tray) like undertone. Body is medium thick, chewy and pleasantly sharply carbonated with a clean dry earthy finish. Flavor packs a massive caramel malty body with a potent bitter hoppy and mildly orange and grapefruit citric finish. Unexpectedly, I really enjoyed this beer. Still not a top tier IPA, but for my tastes, the balance of strong caramel malt and citric sweetness with aggressive bitter hoppiness was very enjoyable."
"Future outlook: A friend scooped this up for me in Iowa recently....if only I knew then what I know now, I would've had him scoop me up some more....Has me anxious to try my Rye Porter from Peace Tree."
"The flavor is much less unique from the tap. A little wishy washy in the flavor profile, with the citric notes overtaking the Belgian notes. Yeasts add a hint of pepper, with a bitter finish. Body remains a little low, while the carbonation doesn't kick quite as hard. My opinion: get a six-pack and avoid the draft."
"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is orange hops with some bready malt notes. The flavor is orange hops with some pine and grass mixed in as well. Low to medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Poured from a 12oz. stubby bottle (no bottle date) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a nice brownish/copper color with some head retention and medium carbonation. Smells of some nice citrusy/grapefruit hops, sweet candi sugar with some phenol/estery aromas. Gives a good hop bite that surprised me. Lots of hop flavor with some malt sweetness that finishes with some alcohol warmth. Flows through the palate pretty good with lots of perceived hop bitterness. A little more caramel malts for balance and this would be a very good drinker."
"D: Unlike a few IPA's I've had, I could definitely throw down a few. The refreshing feel makes you want to pick up the glass as soon as you swallow. I'm lucky to have this beer locally and at a nice price!"
"Overall, a job very well done from this new brewery. I look forward to more of their brews."
"It could use a little more carbonation, but is quite easy to drink and well done."
"Beer from my wife's hometown. I've been frequenting their brewery, and I'm pretty impressed with their efforts. I'm hoping that their full flavored beers catch on in the land of BMC."
