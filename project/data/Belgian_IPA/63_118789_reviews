"I was thinking initially that the hops were winning this particular battle ... The fruity and spicy yeast is making a late resurgence though. As was the case for the red ale genre, Deschutes absolutely kills this style space and this one goes down as a personal favorite."
""
""
"Belgian IPA just not my cup o tea"
""
""
"A solid IPA which looks great, smells good, has a strong flavour and is refreshing. However, its bitterness may be a tad strong for some, and the fruit flavours are more subdued than you'd expect from the aromas. Still a great brew overall."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a 3 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Has a fresh lemon aroma.  I can detect grapefruit and small amount of resin as well.  Malty up front, followed by a strong lemon burst of a hop.  Very tart.  There may be some grapefruit thrown in, but there is mainly a lemon tart aftertaste.  Very bitter.  Not sure what to make of the lemon tartness of it.  Not much in the way of a Belgian flavor either.  It is good but different.  Probably couldn't drink much of this beer in 1 sitting."
""
""
"There is something wrong here. The interplay between yeast and hops is astringent, like some sort of abrasive counter cleaner. It's got a nasty bitter lemon peel thing with no body. Too bad. It is really pretty."
""
""
""
"Beautiful fluffy white head and a floral bouquet to go with it. Smooth taste and hops are dominant but pleasant. Nice offering for a Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light and refreshing. Citrus.  The balance of flavor and carbonation were very good.  Nice white foam at the top."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ This is a rather nice crisp Belgian style IPA.  Quite refreshing and delicious."
""
""
"Flavours include more spicy hops with some phenolic notes derived from the yeast. Some soft booze in the finish."
"Not exactly what I was expecting but very good.  Somewhat golden in color with a good persistent head.  I was expecting the Belgian style yeast to dominate, but instead both the taste and smell were a good combination of fruity hops and rich malt flavor with the yeast working in the background.  The mouthfeel is quite smooth and the finish good.  I'm glad I gave this one a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deschutes seems to have played it safe on this one by creating what tastes more like a Belgian-influenced IPA than a Belgian IPA. And it works. The non-aggressive Belgian yeast works well with the fruity, floral hop profile. Worth drinking again."
""
""
"I thought that this was very similar to Zombie Dust."
""
""
"O- If only this beer tasted like it smells.  The nose is wonderful, complex, just what I'm looking for in a Belgian IPA.  The flavor isn't nearly as complex, but I still like it.  They really fell short on the mouthfeel-what could be smooth, bready, and juicy is very dry and over-carbonated."
""

"It smells wonderful and the taste is good too."

"overall I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The beer was neither lacking nor full of character. It had a good balance to it.  Admittedly I don't yet fully ""get"" Belgian ipa's. Have had quite a few but not a ton.  So far, the style never seems to quite engage me, but never disappoints per say either. I'd like to get a few together to compare at the same time. This one was solid."
""
""
"O - Its a subtle IPA and subtle on the belgian yeast. Not a top in style but good."
""
""
"Overall: Almost like an IPA with just a little distraction to remind you it's a Belgian IPA. Wonder if this was properly stored. If only I knew when it was bottled rather than ""best by date."" It might have been better if I purchased this outside of Utah. State liquor stores do not refrigerate beers."
""

""
""
"Strong, feel it after a few, great bitter after taste."
""
""
""
"I found this to be very enjoyable."
""
"It's barely an IPA. It's highly drinkable and crazy mellow and subtle. Just is a Deschutes beer and that's good enough for me."
""
""
"Foray pours a medium yellow with a medium foam head that dissipates in a few minutes . It leaves a light laceing as it is consumed. It had a medium to light mouthfeel. The taste to me remained fairly consistent over the 45 minutes or so it took to drink it. The label suggests that it delivers hints of Apple and pear.... I never really got the hint! I did however taste bits of citrus and a light pepper finish. I really enjoyed this one ! I like IPA's and  Belgium brews, and this was neither ""way hoppy"" nor ""unhoppy""... So to speak. I'll be buying this one again for sure! Deschutes comes thru again !"
""
"Hazy orange color.  The head clings to the sides. Aroma of pine trees.  As the head still clings.  Initial taste of... what is it??  Pineapple,  orange,  ahhh, lemon.  What this lacks (?) is grapefruit.  So many other IPAs have grapefruit,  you expect to taste gf, but no. Peppery aftertaste.  And the head still clings.... The lightest mouthfeel you will ever experience.  Overall, an IPA that is not like any other. Is that good or bad?  You decide. As the head stilllllll clings."

"Overall a middle of the road Belgian IPA."

"A large billowing slightly off-white colored fluffy pillow like frothy goodness comprised of big (read: huge) chunky bubbles...  World class retention...  The color is an exceedingly pale lemony yellow...  A slight to moderate bit of carbonation some of which moves in streaks and some of which sticks to the sides of the glass...  Gobs of lacing cling to the sides of the glass...  The nice is mild yet quite complex...  To start there are Belgian yeast, euro hops and lemon zest in near equal proportions...  A slightly musky funkiness...  Some overly ripened fruits...  A hint of white pepper...  The flavor profile is near identical to the aromas detected, but the white pepper notes are dialed up a notch or two...  Medium bodied...  Starts brisk before turning a bit juicy on the finish...  Sharp carbonation...  A slight it of stickiness...  I'm fairly certain that Deschutes does not make bad beer...  This is just another rock solid offering and a pretty good bargain given the price point..."

"Medium body. The above average carbonation is a little harsh for the style."
""
""
"Overall a very nice IPA.  Lacks malt balance but a full flavored citrus beverage."
""
""
"O-tasty sweet and drinkable reminds me a little of chainbreaker an easy drinking brew"
""

""

"Overall a very good buy for just 6 bucks for the bomber. Try it!"

"The taste is sweet/tart with a dry finish. Malty and a slight yeast phenols come through. Some warming alcohol in the finish. It finishes a bit gritty. A pretty desent BIPA."

"Brilliant golden. Aroma is reminiscent of Amarillo hops. Very dry finish, slightly piney. It's more bitter than I prefer. Good Belgian yeast ester character, though."

"Trailing dry, light-bodied and deeply resinous, its fast-fleeting finish leaves a fresh grassy, piney and juniper character attached to its long lingering bitterness. Refreshing, crisp and clean, its quite clear that the ""Belgian"" aspects of the ale act in a supporting role and lets the hops take center stage."
""
""
""
""
"Very nice beer, especially for the (relatively) low alcohol. Not sure what bottles are like, but on tap this was a fairly dry, lightly bitter, well spiced version of a Belgian IPA that was quite easy to take."

"Overall just another great beer from another great brewery."
""

"So good. Slight mango in the finish. Definitely taste the Belgian style, but it's a fresh unique beer. I loved it. I'd love to get a six pack of this instead of a 22oz, which was my only option. Deschutes can do no wrong!"
""
"Would pair well with chicken, salad, and/or white fish."
"It pours almost a neon yellow color, and slightly hazy.  Aromas of apple and pear hit the nose, with a hint of banana.  The hops are very gentle here, but strong enough to twist the yeast to an awesome cooperation.  It tastes bright and fresh, with citrus and fresh cut grass.  Overall I think this is awesome.  A mixing of styles thoughtfully done to complement one another."
""
"Another excellent brew from Deschutes. Enjoyed in the New Belgium snifter and poured from the 22 oz bottle. Purchased at The Market in Anacortes."

"Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat dry. Overall, not bad. Mostly just not my style."

"O: Yet another delicious IPA from Deschutes. Definitely recommended."
""

"Overall a good beer but not bitter enough or hoppy enough to really be a Belgian IPA."
""

"O: A nice ipa that was clean and easy to drink. Hops were exceptionally juicy. Definitely a citrus bomb, and not overly Belgian."
""

"deschutes can do no wrong, and while they may have overexploited their talent with the citrusy hop varietals in a lot of beers with similar hop complexions, it really never gets old for me, and this is another awesome brew from them. really pale blonde in color, mostly clear, and sporting a luxurious pillowy white head with nice airy lace that gets more elaborate with each sip. the nose is all citra for me, maybe a little leafy greenness to it, but its real fresh and clean, not dissimilar to the fresh squeezed hop profile, but much much lighter in the grain bill in both color and body. almost pilsener-esque, like a belgian yeast lagunitas day time or something similar, the hops are definitely close. the flavor is really clean too, wight he malt being really delicate up front and although the hops are heavy handed in this beer, they aren't sticky or bitter, so the beer drinks awfully easy. the other thing i dig about it is that the belgian part is secondary, its minimally belgian yeasty, not dominated by the fruity high notes, which allows the hops to do their thing, an appropriate focus. so many belgian india pales get lost in their yeast, this one doesnt, its accent flavors of green apple and even green chestnut, its real cool, real subtle, and overall an exceptional bottle of ale, especially at 5 bucks a bomber. great carbonation and supremely refreshing. love it."

"Overall, I was skeptical when this was coming out because of Deschutes' Chainbreaker, which seems to be in a similar wheelhouse as this one, stylistically. However, they've done a great job of separating the two beers and ended up with two IPAs that harken to some classic Belgian beer characteristics in unique ways. I would love to see this one become a regular seasonal, because it is quite a good summertime IPA."
""
""
"The Foray is probably one of the best Belgian style IPAs that I've had. The beer poured a slight hazy yellow with floaties and white head that left a spotty lace. The scent carried Belgian yeast and sugar mixed with pine like hops. The taste followed suite....started like a white Belgian then finished like a west coast ipa. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was a good ipa and worth a shot."
""
""
""
"Overall - I can't help but be disappointed by this one. Pretty weak flavor; much less flavor than the Paulaner Hefe I had before this. Frankly, when your IPA is getting outflavored by a hefeweizen, you might wanna go back to the drawing board."

"22oz bottle $5.99. Very light yellow color, sudsy and soapy head. Aroma is very hoppy, grassy, my girlfriend said cat pee but I didn't get that at all. Flavor is citrus hops, very light malt backbone, doesn't really have a strong Brlgian yeast flavor at all. Almost seems like a variation of chain breaker, definitely a summer drinker, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a solid beer: one I'd certainly drink again, but wouldn't go out of my way to acquire. Deschutes is one of the most reliable breweries in the country IMHO, and do not disappoint here, though I don't feel that they necessarily broke new ground either. Nothing wrong with that, not every brew has to be _insert current craze/popular innovation here_ , despite what the forums would have you believe."
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Belgian style IPA. Good mix of fruit esters and spice with a citrus presence that almost tastes like straight mango juice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I often have mixed feelings about Belgian IPAs as sometimes the yeast and hops don't seem to get along. I found this beer to be very well integrated and balanced and it was hard to tell what flavors were imparted by the hops vs. the yeast. This is a massive win for the style. However, the taste is slightly muted vs. some other examples, so I guess that was the trade off. Regardless, I really liked it."

"Fairly light bodied, zesty carbo, I'm not digging this much. I have had a few of this style before and this brew doesn't hold up to any of them, imho. Not for me but if you like it, enjoy!"
"Did not dig the flavor and one of the very rare Deschutes letdowns."
""
""
""
""
"O - I like it, but I think I got my hopes up too much. All things that come from Deschutes are good, and that was still well worth the try!"
""
"Overall another damn tasty brew from Deschutes, they never really disappoint!"
""
"My first example of a Belgian IPA from Deschutes, and of course they nailed it."
""
""
"A very session like IPA. Low malt, low hops. Big apricot taste. You get the Belgian yeast effect for sure as advertised. A very good IPA, NOT GREAT. But one you could drink a lot of. The aroma is tropical fruits, and a slight pine. Very little bitterness, but big flavors despite the low amount of malt and hops."
