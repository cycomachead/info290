"From my tasting notes: The Belgo Belgian Style IPA poured a dark gold with a white head. I let it sit and warm to allow all of the flavors and aromas to reveal themselves. You get the signature Belgian yeast aroma of sweet cloves and bananas with a bit of hops as well. The taste was complex with the Belgian yeast hitting you first with the bitter hops on the back end. The mouthfeel was creamy smooth on this well balanced beer which made the Belgo dangerously easy to drink considering its 8% ABV."

"Not bad, as with most Belgian yeast fermented IPAs, the yeast character clashes a bit with the ample hop character; I find that a beer like this is better as the second or third (though I rarely get to that point) of an evening. Still, I will always have a hankering for a nice hoppy Belgian Ale and I am quite enjoying this one."
""
"A kind of like the light spices that come through in the taste of this beer."
"I have never been one for India Pale Ales but after trying this one I might have to give them another try the Belgian yeast and also the really great smelling Hopsin they put in here give it a very India Pale Ale smell but unfortunately dissipates quickly after opening the taste the real winner here reminds me of great grapefruit cut grass and also a few other fruity notes probably from the east I will definitely be buying this. Little disappointed on the mouthfeel doesn't seem to last very long"

"I think this may be one of, if not the best Belgian IPA's that I have ever had. It does many things right here, from the good balance of yeasty qualities and hops, to the excellent aroma, to the well-suited body. This beer may not be a ""session"" IPA, but well worthy of seeking out if you want something in the Belgian IPA category. This is phenomenal, and would hold up easily against the likes of Houblon Chouffe and Piraat."

"The Belgo IPA is very good. The beer pours clear golden with foamy white head that is leaving a lace in my tulip glass. The scent carries spice, hints of bitter citrus with touches of sweet Belgium malts. The taste starts with a zip of spice then a hoppy bitter citrus and sweet malt takes over and then a peppery finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with decent carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer."
""
""
"3.84/5.00"
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
""
""
"This is another classic example where to things that I like by themselves aren't incredible when combined. I love both belgian triples and American IPA's, but this, although interesting, doesn't really do it for me. Although a gorgeous beer packed with flavors, the notes don't really seem to gel and the stupidly acidic and tart crab apple finish really only motivates me to take another sip to get that flavor out of my mouth for a bit. This significantly degrades what is otherwise a pretty sold beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was half expecting the standard IPA flavor and smells, but this was a pleasant surprise and change of pace. I might actually like it better than New Belgium's Ranger IPA. It doesn't linger as long, thought it does have a nice kick to it at 7% ABV. Good beer."
""
""
"Interesting beer, but not very tasty. If you enjoy belgians and hops, you'll probably love this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very odd beast. Tropical sugary fruit and some American hop notes of bitter citrus with a hint of pine on the back end. Weird and interesting, but not outstanding. Seems a bit bizarre."
"O - Not a bad showing from a brewery that rarely impresses me on their brews outside their Lips of Faith series. This is certainly drinkable and I would have one again."
""
""
""
"O-This was a decent beer, but a touch on the sweet and yeasty side of the style for me. The hops and yeast work well together here, but I found myself wanting a drier, crisper feel and a little more prick from the carbonation. High marks for the lacing, however."
""
""
""
""
"O: One is enough. This is definitely Belgian and an IPA. Many BIPAs are tnot Blegian enough or not hoppy enough. This one achieves both. I would order a pint, but I won't buy 6 again I don't think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good one for New Belgium. Really easy drinking for the ABV. I could see downing these in the front yard with neighbors on a nice summer afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"O.... this is an easy drinking beer. Would be great on a hot day. Light body with a crisp feel and quick finish. I think non hop heads would like this."
"Pours a dark yellow, slightly murky, but inviting and good looking and everything. Smells floral, and citrus and fresh garden and good. Clean taste, sweet but not too malt forward, and then bitterness, really fresh high note hops, and with nice sustain of the bitterness. Some yeast and fermented back notes too. Mouth-feel is slick, a refreshing, the carbonation moderately assertive. Nice. I could do rows of these."
""
""
"Overall: I think at $8.50 a 6-pack this beer is extremely good."
""
"M - Light-to-medium body. Crisp and dry as one would expect from a true belgian style IPA. Finish is clean and somewhat tannic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good flavor and lingering but pleasant aftertaste. Decent, not spectacular take on the Belgian IPA."
""
"Overall a reasonable beer, not sure I'd feel compelled to buy it again though. It does hide it's abv though and is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure I'd call this a Belgian IPA, more like a standard one. A true Belgian IPA should have less hops, and a bit more complexity. Not a bad beer, but I think is closer to an American IPA than a Belgian one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer that i would like to try more of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I bought this because I saw that my local store finally had it. The appearance of the beer is very average. Looks like just your basic beer and wasnt anything special. The smell of the beer was very nice. You pick up a lot of tripel and IPA style scents. The smell is very sweet. The taste was also very nice, the beer was very hoppy and with a bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice, but not great. It has a bit of crispness and thats about it. Overall this beer is very nice and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I found this to be a bit unbalanced as the yeast flavors overpowered the other flavors in the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a puzzling combination that comes across as confused, chaotic, and isn't well suited together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Fruity and lighter take on the style, lots of tropical fruits, and yeasty goodness. Very enjoyable and quite easy drinking. Wish they distributed to the NY/NJ/CT area. Well worth picking up a six or a case of this nicely crafted brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Complex, bright, and refreshing with great drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably wouldn’t want more than two of these in a row, but I’ll definitely be making Belgo a part of my regular rotation of beers. I’m glad they made it a year-round offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"M:Medium bodied, medium carbonation, finish is nice and dry. Tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer, very well done belgian ipa with a great flavor profile and mouthfeel to match."
""
""
"O - This is a really tasty Belgian IPA. It's hard to put down. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
"A solid, well done Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
"Beer pours a nice mellow amber and gold color with a tad of copper. This brew pours with the exact right amount of lace and head. Has a yeasty aroma of malts and bitter hops, but goes down smooth. Beer is a bit sweet in nature and relatively light for being seven percent. I was not expecting much out of this brew, but I was pleasantly surprised nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Powerful starting and deep with a nice flavor profile, Belgo is a bi-polar beer that's got it's down sides, but evens out to a well-balanced, Belgian-influenced, hoppy beer with a nice clean bitterness. A good pairing with spicy pepperoni-coated thick-crusted pizza!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a nice light brew good for summer"
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite styles of beer. I love the addition of Belgian yeast to a hoppy IPA. I love this beer. I’ll have another."
""
"Overall a good mix of a Belgian Ale and an IPA, giving this brew a nice smooth drinkability..."
""
""
"On-tap at the brewery. An excellent version of this relatively new style. Great balance between American hops and Belgian yeast character. Citrus...lots of citrus. Orange, pineapple, lime, and grapefruit. Some complimentary pine, herbs, bright floral notes. The Belgian yeast notes fight their way into the mix with more spice and citrus. Dry and evenly bitter, but smooth."
""
""
""
"Overall: A little weak on the hop character. It is a nice belgian style beer though making it nicely drinkable."
"D - A well crafted Belgian style ale, though I might be inclined to question its IPA pedigree. The hop character is lacking, both in its intensity and its American character. There are hints of pine, but most of the hop flavor gets lost in the spicy yeast notes."
""
""
""
"O: I understand this is a controversial style and so frankly this beer isn't getting the recognition it deserves. It is a perfect blend of the two styles. I am thrilled to have it available, and will buy it as often as I can and hope to keep it in stock."
""
"I thought this was quite solid, liked the crispness and good flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice drink"
"Overall: A pretty good take on the style. Good fruity candy flavor that avoids becoming too syrupy. Solid presence of yeasty spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, it has an awesome body to it, slightly cloudy, plenty of carbonation, light lacing and a slight burnt orange hue to it all topped off with a nice white fluffy and creamy head that lasts quite a while. The hops are very present in the aroma, there a fruity aromas mixed in as well. I can pick up some grape fruit, apple, a slight grape aroma, and it’s got a fairly clean smell to it. Its light to medium bodied, the hops are quite flavorful but not over powering. It has some slightly bitter flavors mixed in with some apple and orange, overall its sweet with a semi-harsh aftertaste that has a hint of alcohol. It goes down pretty smooth, this is another good beer from the New Belgium Brewing people…"
""
""
"Fresh bottle, BA review 6100. A good head and lace. A lace sheet in fact. A little funky aroma, that gets in the taste. Hoppy Belgian taste, tasting as it should.A dry finish a little pepper. Needs a bit bolder flavour or complexity. Just not outstanding or greatly drinkable."
""
""
"O: A fine example of the style. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final thoughts - Only $7-8 a sixer, nice 7% abv and just all around awesome. Once again another New Belgium beer that has the notes of fat tire in it. I really think all of them do"
"Initial taste is more like pilsner than bpa, with a slightly bitter finish and a bit of heat going down. Nice lacing continues throughout. A bit of tannin on the tongue I the finish. A little thin on taste, again sweet banana most prominent but a pretty nice beer and good for Belgian fix at a decent price for a sixer."
"Overall - An above average brew that has some nice vibrant flavours. It's a tad on the sweet side so I'm not sure how many I could have on one sitting. It seems to be a little more on the american IPA side of the spectrum than the belgian as well."
"Definitely one of the better Belgian styles I've had from New Belgium Brewing Co. Belgian IPAs are hard to make right and they did a good job here. Smooth, tasty, and I approve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good Belgian IPA. The hop notes come in strong and work well with the Belgian side of things."
""
"O: This was a great representation of the Belgian IPA, which is a style that I'm starting to come around to."
"clear golden yellow pour with about 2"" of creamy white head, tons of sticky lacing. smells of orange peel, coriander, soap/detergent, pine. bitter earth flavor up front followed by a bitter sweet orange peel taste. a little too bitter with the hops to be able to determine the other flavors.. has a slight zest to it. light to medium bodied.. watery at first but then gets creamy and coats your tongue with a heavier body.. nicely carbonated creates a subtle fizz on the roof of your mouth. overall a nice thirst quencher, has a dry bitter finish. feels like it should be a session beer but at 7% abv, i would be careful!"
""
""
""
"A high quality beer, but it's seems much more Belgian pale than a hybrid with an America IPA."
"like a belgian trippel. Tastes like a belgian trippel with extra hops on the back end, similar to another Raging bitch ive been with. mouthfeel is pleasant with mild carbontaion. overall this is a very good beer, the new belgium brewing co never disappoints me"
""
""
""
""
"o- This is a great beer. A really smooth IPA that has a big, full body. It hardly tastes like the 7% abv labled on the bottle and if I didn't know that i'd be tempted to call this a session beer"
""
""
""
""
"A pale amber color with a fair white head and modest specs of lacing. The aroma is a nice peach cobbler and wheat clove. Pretty interesting and likeable. The flavor is sweet caramel and gentle citrus hop with vanilla clove. Body is about medium with goodly carbonation that makes for a lively feel that drinks easy. Not highly memorable but enjoyable enough to recommend. I would drink again but not quite in my wheelhouse for this style."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent Belgian IPA. The heavy yeasty character is blended well with the hop character that gives it a clean, citrusy, refreshing flavor. I will try this again."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good carbonation, very drinkable beer."
"O - This is a very enjoyable beer! In many ways it represents the best of both worlds - the refreshing citrusy flavors of a Belgium ale and the hoppy high alcohol content of an American IPA. Well done! Highly recommended, especially to novices (like myself) who are intrigued by the compelxity of IPAs, but occasionally find them to be a bit harsh and heavy on the palate."
"o: i really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Have never had a belgian yeast ipa.. A very different ipa than I was expecting. Simple.. yet complex, and fairly imaginative in flavor."
"D - A solid American interpretation of the style... Absolutely stellar appearance... The nose and flavor are solid, but a bit understated... The mouthfeel is a bit too sharp... Overall is a solidly above average Belgian IPA..."
"Taste is sweet up front and a bit void in the middle, though warming does challenge that perspective. Offers a unique orange character throughout the palate. Finish is floral and spicy yet not very bitter. Slightly coarse in nature, and bready, this beer finishes with a peppery clove flavor. More Belgo. than IPA yet pleasant and never abrasive. As I struggle to grasp the wide range of brews that fall into this style, I think I like this one. Hoppy yet not overly bitter and in balance with a malt character that is well accentuated by the yeast esters. More subtle and delicate than a certain Raging Bitch I know..."
""
""
"O: Drinkable, but pretty average overall. This beer seems confused, it has the flavor of a pleasant session beer, but it's alcohol is a bit too noticeable in general for that. A bolder flavor profile would really help this a lot. As it stands, not bad, but not great."
"Overall: Liked it al lot. I'd buy/drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"My only gripe with this beer is that there's a harsh aftertaste - more so than what most IPAs have."
"O: the best of both worlds! This beer is an IPA and a belgian beer in one! Its a nice beer to enjoy! Definetly a must!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my new favorite beers of the year. I am obviously a big fan of hoppy beers and as far as hoppy beers go this one has chosen wisely and delivered a great complex yet very enjoyable beer like some of the other great Belgium styles from Europe."
""
"Poured from bottle stamped 13May12 to a pint glass the beer pours a clear golden straw color with a dece 1 finger white head, some retention and nice lacing. The nose is very belgian dominated with strong banana and clove character, a noticeable sweet malt essence as well as perhaps a hint of apple. Not alcohol detected. A mild earthy hop character. The flavor starts crisp with a strong bite that gradually mellows to a blend of earthen hops, sweet malt, banana, clove, and apple flavor. Medium bitterness, again no alcohol detected. The flavor is sharp, overly so, in my opinion as it distracts from an otherwise enjoyable beer. Finishes crisp. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, not a bad beer but not outstanding. Glad I purchased only the 1."
"Overall: a good beer, but nothing special. I was hoping the Belgian quality would add complexity, but no luck."
""

"Poured a rocky mountain looking head which its craters and hills filled the entire top of my glass. As the head slowly sunk into the beer it left beautiful fluffs of lacing behind. Smells of resiny hops,banana, citrus fruits such as tangerine and orange peel. Earthyness and piney. This IPA brought the whole party with it and is here for business. First flavour that caught my attention was the spices that touch the tip of the tongue but quickly trails behind an explosion of hops, bananas, citrus. Bitter on the tongue but complements the fruityness of this beer. Slightly dry finish with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall this beer seems to have a lot going on. Very well balanced IPA. Thumbs up my fellow hop heads."
""
""
"This one's complex and rich, and well worth a try. It may not be my favorite New Belgium brew, but it's certainly good."
""
""
""
"More malt could help this one some to hide the alcohol and balance out the hops but that NB biscuit note is already in there so I don't think that would improve my overall impression. Hops are coming in droves but the dankness comes off like it's a bit old and contributes alot to the bitterness. Belgian character is perfectly balanced and adds a good dimension to what would otherwise be a very basic IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite a nice beer. It has qualities of Saison, but defiantly is more reminiscent of an IPA. I like it a lot as a whole experience - super drinkable too."
""
"D - This is a surprisingly decent beer, particularly as I'm not the biggest fan of this style. Considering this has widespread availability and a reasonable price I'd actively recommend it for those just getting into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall, I really enjoyed this beer very much, it reminds me of the Belgium IPA I brewed in the summer time last year."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 2/12/2012. Mild gusher upon opening. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with amazing retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some nice lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of pepper, clove, grapefruit, bubblegum, biscuit, lemon, grass, and herbal spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big lemon, clove, pepper, grapefruit, bubblegum, biscuit, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, clove, bubblegum, biscuit, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of Belgian qualities to hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and slightly resinous mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking, and alcohol is well hidden for 7% with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and well executed Belgian IPA. Really balanced, enjoyable, and drinkable."
"A really good entry into the growing Belgian IPA ring. New Belgium continues to keep their focus on quality. Good for them."
""
""
""
"overall - 4.5/5 - Despite that I think it needs a little more balance in the body, I enjoy this beer. In fact, it's one of those that with every sip, it gets better. That might just be the 7% talking..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it wasn't too bad of a beer. The beer tastes like a close approximation of a Belgian IPA, but just doesn't quite hit the mark. I probably wouldn't drink it again. It's better than many beers out there, but it just tastes unfinished!"
""
"O: A good beer, all around, and at a solid price. Definitely one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had, though I'd like a bit crisper body and more hop presence in the nose."
"Overall, not a bad beer at all. Definitely sessionable, but not my first choice at all. IPA's still are not my thing, but naturally I have understood why they are so popular."
"Pours a gold color with a nice one finger off white head. Excellent lacing on the side of my snifter glass. It's fairly clear in appearance. The nose is really nice- peach, pear, spice, hops- really extremely balanced, and very nice. The flavor is the same profile, but it's not as complex as the best Belgians in this style. Feel is nicely carbonated, with a very dry fruity finish. Overall, this is a solid beer, but you can find better in the style. Cheers."
"Pours a clear, dark gold with a persistent albeit flat head. Complex, spicy, grassy aroma with notes cinnamon fades to an aroma of cooked canned vegetables. Tastes a little better than it smells. Nicely peppery and spicy hop flavors mingle well with Belgian yeast esters, but the lingering aroma of cooked cauliflower lingers and spoils it a bit. I do appreciate the lean body and dry finish though."
""
""
""
"Good brew, good to see New Belgium is still creating good beers"
""
""
"Overall: I have not had many good beers in this style. They too often lean too far on the funky, or hoppy side. This is a bit too yeasty, with little solid hop character."
"O-New Belgium does a solid job of making consistently good brews. I flew with one of their sales reps and he comped me a free beer so I try and pick up a 6 pack from time to time. This is a solid beer for pizza to make every bite of a good pie, a great experience."
""
""
""
""
"I recommend it. I've had better Belgian IPAs (again, stone), but for the price and availability, this is a really good beer."
""
""
"O. This is my first foray into Belgian IPAs. I did enjoy this, but I don't know that it's a style I would reach for very often. Still, a nice brew."
""
""
""
"O'all - A nice hoppy IPA, but Belgian character muddies the picture rather than enhances it for me."
""
""
""
"Medium on thin with moderate carb and some decent slick on the finish. This beer has the one flavor that kills it for me overall in this beer, wish I could pinpoint it, but nonetheless, it's a no go for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is pretty decent. I probably wouldn't go pick it up at the store over any of the other beers I like to get somewhat regularly, but would enjoy this in a mix pack or if someone offered me one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I felt like I was mixing 2 different beers here. Impressed with the balance between hoppiness and funkiness. Very crisp and refreshing. Very sessionable even with the higher ABV. It is usually a hit or miss with New Belgium and I would definitely hit this again."
""
"I was going to try to follow this with another IPA for a taste comparison but I put that one back as I didn't think I could appreciate it after the Belgo, although I did treat myself to a second Belgo."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer has some good qualities, but the taste is only average for a Belgian IPA. It is not nearly in the same league as gems such as Lupulus or Duvel Triple Hop. The Belgian and IPA aspects are not well integrated but seem to be in conflict with one another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has a tart taste to it. There's some wheatyness to it. A slight bitter bite. True to the name, it has a bitter hop taste mixed with a Belgium wheat. Solid, and well made."
""
"New Belgium Brewing Company added Belgo, a Belgian-Style IPA, to it's ever growing, award winning lineup in 2011. This bottle conditioned brew rolls in at 7% ABV and is chock full of Amarillo, Cascade, Centennial, and Simcoe hops. Belgo pours a clear, pale gold with a rocky white head and tons of small bubbles from the bottle conditioning, lacing is there, but very light. A bright bouquet of piney and spicy hops are underlined with estery yeasty notes from the Belgian strain. A thin, light to light-medium body is in tune with the low-level carbonation. A bit of Belgian funk greets the pallet in the beginning, but quickly gives way to more assertive hop flavors that linger throughout the finish. A great beer to sip and to share."
""
"The body was pretty typical for an IPA, medium-ish, and except for the yeasty spice lingering had a clean finish. Drinkability was terrible due to the weird flavoring. Overall, a substandard brew from a brewery that, if it rarely thrills, even more rarely completely misses. I got no joy from this beer and can't recommend it."
"Poured from a 12 oz. Bottle into a pint glass. It pours a real light straw colored yellow. Super transparent. A big 1 1/2"" white head rests on top and lightly laces the glass. Big Belgian funk. It's not the P funk but I still want to get funked up. Mild hop aroma. This has a surprisingly good hop taste that accompanies this spicy complexity of the yeast. Light bodied and well carbonated. This is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally got around to trying a bottle. Wow, I am impressed. The good qualities of my favorite regular New Belgium beer-- the Trippel-- plus a huge spicy hit and the aromatic hops."
"Beer is surprisingly hoppy given the aroma was nearly absent. Earthy, grinding, good, dry finish, quite carbonated on the palate, strong finish. Nice. I'd have it again, I got a six pack, I'll drink the whole thing."
""
""
"O - A bit lighter and not as powerful as some of the other Belgian IPAs I regularly enjoy (Raging Bitch, for example) but it's lighter body and clean flavors make it more drinkable than others, and the Belgian influence is spot on."
""
""
""
"A decent easy-to-drink Belgian IPA. I must confess that, despite my love for IPAs and Belgian ales, this is one of my least favorite styles... but I still don't think it is that great compared to other beers of the same style."
"Not bad, a little bland but a reasonable amount of flavor and good attenuation. Recommended for a change of pace."
""
"Admittedly, I am not a fan of this style for some reason, despite that I like Belgians and IPAs, albeit on absolute terms. This is a beer that won't overwhelm the enthusiast but then perfect for someone not familiar with craft beer or this style. Can drink this beer anytime, anywhere and that's probably the appeal."
""
"Been looking to try this guy for some time now. It pours a clear brass topped by a light-cream-white froth a few fingers tall. (And I don't remember shaking it at all...) The nose comprises pine needles aplenty, melon rind, grapefruit rind, and banana. The taste holds notes of honey, banana, light grapefruit zest, light honeydew, light watermelon, and rather light caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a solid BIPA; though nothing to write home about, it's pretty tasty."
". 12 oz single from Safeway in West Salem. $1.85 Slightly cloudy orange with a small yet thick white head. Nice piney/spice aromas..sugary yet yeasty nice. Taste is good too the bitter hops meld well with the yeast and spices..a surprising balance really. Good mouthfeeel..not boring and importantly not cloying. Overall a nice Belgian IPA"
""
"O- Definitely a favorite of mine. I like the way the citrusy hops work together with the yeast and wheat-like characters."
"The amber colored body was clear, and the head was one finger thick. The smell was quite hoppy, with clean grapefruit aroma. The Belgian yeast showed up in hints of banana, clove, and orange peel. The taste was not quite as layered as the smell. I could taste some white pepper, hay, rock candy, and lemon peel. The body felt a touch watered down and thin. The hops lingered in the finish. an easy drinking take on this emerging style."
""
""
"Sessionable."
"Pretty forward with the hop character and story the yeast wants to tell. Both meld well rather than clash, really good drinking here."

"O - Okay, probably won't have this again."

"Superbly made beer. It was really a wonder to drink. The combinations of taste, smell and mouthfeel are one-offs."
"D - Could be really good if they toned down the bitterness."
""
"overall i would say that this belgian IPA has all the requisite building blocks for the style, yet (again) lacks the panache that makes belgians (and faux belgians) unique to the style. all substance and no style, i guess."
""
""
""
"Belgo is not a bad beer, but not really worth picking up from my sampling. The above section I think sums it up well with 'soft'. The concept and marketing are brash, so live up to it!"
""
"Bought a 6 pack for around $9. Pours a cloudy orange color, great aroma to it. Taste is hoppy with the typical Belgian yeasts and fruitiness flavors. One of the better Belgian IPA's I've had and is actually really tasty, New Belgium has a solid line up of beers and this is one of the better ones... it won't let you down."
""
""
"Drinkability- Surprisingly tasty beer that is deliciously hoppy and a welcome surprise at this place. I’m starting to like these Belgium IPA's more and more and this is a better version of the style. Nice beer!"
""
"O - This would be a good Belgian pale ale, which is what it is as far as I am concerned. But they call it a Belgian IPA and although it shouldn't be a hot hammer like an AIPA the hops really take a back seat and just peak through at times. If you are going to call it an IPA you need to feature hops a bit more. Not a bad beer, one that I would enjoy again, but it falls short in the style."
""
"Overall: This is a good IPA, and you can defiantly tell that it is of the Belgian persuasion with its unique yeast characteristics. It looks great in a glass and it goes down very easily. The abv. may be a little high to turn this into a session brew, but it really is a nice beer to drink by itself. I also had one with some thanksgiving leftovers and it paired up with that nicely. I liked this beer a lot, as with a lot of the Belgian style ales from this brewery I would highly recommend it as a way to get into this style. Very good beer."

" This IPA has a strong yeast presence -very tannic and spiced with bitter herbal flavors that carry a light amount of astringency into the taste. The flavor is light on malt with a heavy dose of phenols in the yeast flavor, kind of fruity in a tangy sort of way, perhaps citrus if you look for it, but in the general not as flavored with hops as it is bitter and the citrus is muted by the spice of the yeast. overall I wasn't sure what to expect but feel this missed the mark and was just average for the style. I probably would try it again, but this is not my favorite Belgian IPA that I have tried."
"I enjoy New Belgium’s Ranger and expected to see more of its flavor profile come through in the BelgoPA but to make a metaphor it’s like meeting the relative of a good friend and hitting it off—there’s some similarities but enough differences to make it unique and able to stand on its own merits."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very fine beer. I have not been too impressed from New Belgium beers so far but this one is a very finely crafted beer. Skip the hype of the Fat Tire...this one is the winner."
""
"Overall: It's fine, it's not like it didn't work out for me, but I just found it to be merely so-so."
""
"Served at a good temp with a nice off white fine head that lasts forever and loads of lace. Color is a clear amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is hops, resin, malt, yeast. Flavor's a lot like nose, pretty dry, a bit fruity, but mainly hop bitter. Body is faultless, ditto carbonatiion. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and fairly balanced. decent brew."

"D: part of me wants to say this drinks like an ipa with a belgian yeasty twist and the other part wants to say this drinks like a belgian golden with a healthy dose of american hops. regardless of categories, this is a good tasting brew from nb."
"O. Pretty easy drinking beer. Overall one of the better New Belgium beers and better Belgian IPAs I have had. Based on NB's other regular lineup up, I think they should consider adding this to the year round mix."
""
"O- Haven't had lots of Belgian IPA's before. This was a good drink, but nothing made it great. Good flavors and nicely put together. Would maybe pick up a sixer of this sometime as it was easy to drink."
""
""
"A nice take on a Belgian pale from the folks at New Belgium. Definitely a must try."
""
"Notes: Not extraordinary but very well rounded. It feels like we are hitting a well recognized standard for what is minimally expected of a quality Belgium IPA. This works."
""
"Golden pale in color, light pallet, descent head, good lacing, good hop level, and hints of freash herbs, it may sound crazy,but it reminds me of rosemary. It would pair well w/ lightly seasoned pork or a burger. Descent percentage. The blue moon IPA."
"Drink- A solid outing from NB as always. This was tasty, solidly balanced albeit a little bit more dense and thicker. I would've like to see more brightness but you have to make your beer unique."
""
"Sampled from a bottle, best by April 1, 2012. Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and a slight chill haze that clarifies shortly after the pour. Poured with a tall, rocky foam that clung to the edges of the glass. Bubbles never stop rising from the bottom of the glass. Musty belgian yeast and citrus and orange aromas with hints of banana and spice. Thick feel with rich never-ending carbonation. Citrus and pine hops from beginning to end with a sweet malt and belgian yeast backbone. Pine hop bitterness intensifies at the end with a slightly boozy, bitter hop finish. Lots of nice aromas, flavors and feel on this belgian IPA."
""
"Overall an excellent beer that I more or less stumbled upon by accident. I would gladly buy twelve packs of it if they were availilbe. Definitely a more excellent member of the New Belgium family."
"New Belgium is not for sale here in Ohio; this was brough in from Illinois, which is quite a shame, because every brew I've had thus far of their's has been quite good. This is an excellent BIPA, with plenty of spice from the yeast to complement the bitterness of the hops. Definitely one you'll want to try if you can get your hands on one!"

"Nice enough but I wouldn't make a point of seeking it out again."
"O: A serviceable beer, but not what I wanted nor expected based on the label."
"taste is hops, a bit of spice and a nice round off-sweet belgian character...but then if finishes with a terrible watery mouthfeel that really has a bad effect on the brew...overall, decent but probably the least impressive BIPA i've had so far."
"Overall, this is a style I like, and this is a solid representation of the style. I enjoy the malt profile that accompanies the amount of hops bitterness. This beer does a decent job of mixing the two."
"Much better on tap then in the bottle."
"O: What a difference compared to my previous experiences! Although it shouldn’t be surprising that the best beers a brewery named “New Belgium” puts out are their Belgian ones, it certainly shocked me. Craft beer always has a way of catching you off-guard, which is one of the things I love about it. And New Belgium, you just hit me with a dose of Belgian love that I won’t soon forget – Lips of Faith, here I come!"
"Other comments: It's like a cross between an American IPA and a Duvel. Yummy."
"O - I almost like it but not quite, I've always disliked that Belgian yeasts flavor though. That taste is pretty over powering here not leaving room for many other flavors"
"O: This is probably the best Belgian IPAs I've had (I haven't had many though). It offers up a good amount of Belgian yeasty goodness and a very good malt backbone. However, I wish the hops weren't so crowded out by the yeast. Also, the skunky aromas were a little off putting, but overall a solid offering from New Belgium."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise, I picked this up on whim at the nearby grocery store, but it turned out to be pretty tasty. Well worth trying,"
"Nice amber hue with persistant lacing that firmly resisted gravity. Nice aroma...not overpowering. Slight scent of a fermenting fruit bowl - a mixture of tropical and citrus. Taste still had a faint biscuit flavor that tips off the brewer's origin - New Belgium. Nice spice...maybe some anise and coriander? Only slightly stringent bitter aftertaste. The exceptional balance of all of these qualities are what make this an excellent beer. It will be a regular offering in my home for guests."
"The aroma was full of yeast and spice with a very nice light fruit vibe coming off of it. Lots of peaches and pears were readily apparent and easily transferred the aroma into one of a nice Belgian pale. There was a large amount of hops present on the nose as well, what seemed like citrus A touch of alcohol was present hidden under all of this as well but it served more to round out then to distract. huge hoppy flavor coming off of it. nice fruity flavors worked their way in, lots of peaches and pears, apples and a touch of orange, probably coriander starting to break through. A good amount of yeast gave way to a nice dry hoppy finish that was accented by some grape like flavors in the end"
"Notes: Great Belgian IPA. Fruity and spices are all present but nothing is too intense. Very smooth and creamy with great flavors coming out. Wonderful overall."
"Plus, I really like the label."
"Pours a clear light honey orange with a 3 inch puffy white head that settles to an island of chunky foam. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is first and foremost of a typical Belgian yeast along with some spices and malt aromas. I am not really getting any typical IPA smells from this one. It smells more like a witbier/hefeweizen hybrid than anything. Taste is of citrus fruits and citrus zest up front along with a malt backbone and a clean Belgian yeast flavor on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers on the tongue with each sip. This beer has a medium body with a smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel. A lower level of carbonation on this one. Overall, this is a good Belgian take on an IPA. The smell is deceiving however as it does not really identify that what you are about to drink has any IPA qualities to it."
"This is a fine Belgian IPA, but nothing I would pick up again to quick, a little light on the hops for my taste, needs a touch more dry hopping."
"O: If I just pretend the Belgian part of the beer didn't exist, then this would be a great IPA. Falls short of other Belgian IPA's I've tasted, but this one makes much economical sense ($7.99 a six pack)."
"A great Belgian IPA. This will now be my go to for the style. Tasty. Highly recommend."
"O- A nice beer that is very enjoyable. First non Lips of Faith beer that I have really liked from New Belgium. Definitely will pick this up again!"
"Pours a golden body with a rich white head with good retention and lacing properties. Th aromas are predominantly of citrus hops, but the Belgian yeast definitely imparts the smell of cotton candy and tropical fruits. Tastewise, the front palate is hop-forward before quickly giving way to caramelly malts and fruitier elements such as pineapple, kiwis, and something reminiscent of strawberries. The overall yeastiness feels very Belgian. I wish that the finish didn't wasn't so lemony -- it seems inconsistent with overall candied sweetness and fruity character of the beer to end on such a bitter note, but it doesn't wreck it."
"Loved this beer. First experience with a beldium IPA and I'm pretty sure Im gonna try a batch myself. Why don't more breweries do this???"
"Note to New Belgium....Please bring your beer to NEW YORK!"
"O - Overall this is a very good beer. Smells and looks wonderful. The flavors just didn't match up well with the nose. Everything was there just a bit vague and unorganized. And lite. It makes for easy drinking though. I would buy this again."
"Belgo has a nice, if overly sweet flavor; however, the strong yeast presence and weak feel makes it more like a poor Belgian Ale than a middle-of-the-road IPA. Either way, there are much better options."
"Overall it's not as good as their ranger IPA, but is certainly a good beer and worth trying, as well as being a good value."
"Overall: Decent but lacking in character. I probably wouldn’t purchase this again."
"One of the best beers I've had from these guys in a long time, reminds a lot of Tank 7 in many ways, just about as good. Well done New Belgium!"
"O - Brilliant effort buy the fellows at NB. Refreshing, flavorful and not overly heavy while carrying tons of flavor and depth."
"I will say that im not a huge fan of most of the belgians; i think its something about the yeasts and others that make me not the biggest fan; i will say that i do appreciate the style. This bursts of wild yeasts and hops. A nice golden to pale straw color in the glass with a HUGE frothy head that almost burst out of the glass. This had a nice smooth feel to it and was extremely drinkable for a 7%er. I will say that having this right next to the ranger and looking at the botle; im just a bigger fan of the hop profile in the ranger; it had a lot more going for it but obviously that is the focus. Overall this is a great brew."
"Tight mouthfeel, dry and crisp, making for some very refreshing sips. Alcohol bite in the very back that is mostly hidden, but shows its head a few times. Hops are mildly bitter, but have a nice flavor that vibes well with the Belgian yeast. That funk from the smell is in the taste mildly, but adds a nice balance to the pleasant hops. A crisp taste of malts brings it full circle and gives this beer a simple straightforwardness that makes it easy to drink. Nothing too extreme, but a very enjoyable take on a style that has a history of going either way. I would buy this again."
"I'm very pleasantly surprised by this offering and will look for it from now on."
"Hazy, brassy blonde with corn silk highlights and a million tiny susupended yeast particles when backlit. Nice dank hoppy aroma with a small blast of yeasty funk. Piney hops with a lemon taffy sweetness imparted by the yeast and a solid malt backbone. Well balanced flavors of American IPA & Belgian yeast which is refreshing as I have grown tired of the ""extreme"" attempts at this newer style. Finishes mostly dry with a hop oily mouthfeel in the finish. Hey, I love good affordable beer and NBB Belgo certainly fits the bill."
"Overall an excellent value... like getting an 'imperial' or special edition at regular micro prices."
"Overall a decent Belgian IPA except for the soapy character."
"Pours clear golden with a lively, moderately sticky head and good streamers of carbonation. The aroma is pungent and phenolic, fruity and spicy, but with a solid pale malt backbone and an aspirin-like tang. The flavor is crisp, with apple and clove and coriander, but a satisfying pale malt bottom-note and a pleasant bitter snap, like an acidic cider. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp."
"This style isn't exactly in my wheelhouse, but I've had a few better executed beers of this ballpark of a genre (Houblon Chouffe, Ommegang BPA). I'd personally prefer a sweeter hop profile to pair with the belgian yeast. Solid, not amazing."
"Overall this is an exceptional beer. It is a little odd at first and maybe even eccentric, but that being said, I like it."
"Nice interplay of yeast and hops. Wonderfully flavorful and simple Belgian IPA for 7-8 dollars. Nothing overpowering just nice crisp IPA with a touch of Belgian yeast. A beer that’s more than the sum of it’s parts."
"O - Great blend of the two styles, its perfect if you want a good IPA but not something that's going to slap you in the face with hops"
"Poured into a standard pint a slight hazed burnt orange infused golden with a fluffy 1/2 finger white crown atop.A burst of fresh citric hop really hit home in the nose along with toasted corainder seed,the aromas are really fresh and bold.Sharp citric hops upfront on the palate followed by a light yeasty phenols,the phenols are kept in check pretty well though with the hops being the main component.A very good BIPA,American hops with just a little yeastiness,I would buy again."
"Overall this is an IPA I will always look forward to drink when I want something a little different than the straight forward in you face hopped American IPA. This IPA just gives me some different for a change and does a great job at it!"
"This was a very good hop-forward variation of a Belgian IPA. Still, balance was there and the taste was very enjoyable. Definitely one to seek out and try again, the only aspect I'd like to be a bit more developed was the aroma."
"D/O: While it is unclear whether or not this beer's core is the same as their Ranger IPA, New Belgium has managed to produce a worthy American-brewed contribution to the style. Its flavor profile is structured around concise yeast phenolics that face little competition from hop aromatics. It is a stylistic crossover of sorts, appearing as much like a Belgian pale ale as a Belgian IPA. It will satisfy the Belgian beer enthusiast more than the West Coast-hopped Stone Cali-Belgique, but that other beer manages to remain more true to the IPA label."
"DO NOT MISS THIS BEER. This one is unique. It's probably love/hate, but for this craft beer drinking fool...it's love all the way. Enjoy."
"O: a nice brew, really doesnt hit with much in the way of what id call an ipa taste but is still a nice smooth and crisp brew, enjoyable and overall good"
"Aroma, Taste, and Mouthfeel: Clovey spiciness dominates the aroma, though there is enough hop to inform you that there is more to the beer. The carbonation bite is aggressive at first, but if the beer is savored before swallowing, there is a nice malty back of the mouth malty sweetness that is complemented by the clove. The sweetness is balanced by hop bitterness and citrus rind, which falls just short of clashing with the clove, or maybe it doesn't fall short. Close call. Pretty aggressive. The finish is dry, with astringency from the hops and bite from the carbonation lingering."
"UPDATE: My overall opinion of the quality of this beer remains the same, but I did want to qualify that my tastebuds were indeed altered by the Fixed Gear I drank before I gave my review. There is a definite hops presence in this beer. Still, it was interesting to have reviewed this beer with an altered pallete. There was plenty to discover beyond what the hops had to say."
"Oddly, I wasn't too enthusiastic with the first three bottles I tossed back. For beer #4, sitting down and really thinking about…I'm very happy with this one, and will come back for more."
"Overall – unique taste and very interesting and intriguing to sample."
"O: One of the first New Belgium beers I have like in awhile. Initially I did not like the beer, but I think my expectations were skewed given how much I like Flying Dogs Raging Bitch. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, that I'm glad I bought. I'll definitely have another one of these....I bought a six pack!"
"Belgo is a nice effort. Hopefully it will make it out of the mixed pack it came in and into its own sixers."
"D- Enjoyable. Got it in a mix pack. There are better Belgian IPAs, but for the price it's rather tasty."
"Overall a good beer. All the basics are there for a Belgian IPA. Still seems a little on the raw side. Certainly worth the price I paid for the beer. Will buy again. An added benefit is the Low Alcohol level for the style. This doesn't have the KO effect of say Raging Bitch."
"a fusion of two styles that you dont see all the time. pours a very alive deep golden color with a rising head. smells yeasty and hoppy, enticing! its muc more of an ipa that i thought it might be. these usually tend to be european versions, and thus not as bold with the hop additions. not belgo though, this is an ipa through and through with a nice crist belgian yeast finish. not one i'd probably drink every day, but a well executed rendition of the style."
"Pours a clear, gold/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, earthy malt, hint of floral hops, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, slight yeast, sweet malt, slight citrus hops, and slight floral hops. Overall, good appearance, feel, and blend."
"New Belgium Belgo Belgian IPA: This one is a must try! Close your eyes, take a sip and you will experience a great IPA that magically transforms into a Belgian Trippel. Amazing how New Belgium has done this. Two beers in one. New Belgium is a master at marketing with their quirky ads, great beer names (hard to beat “Fat Tire” as a beer name, even though I personally do not care for that brew) and traditional labels. They missed it with Belgo. The name does nothing for me, and the label is ugly at best. But let’s not judge the beer by the packaging. The Belgo pours with a honey colored body, little carbonation, and a great pillowy head with fine lacing. It looks fantastic in the glass, and the looks are outdone by the aroma, which is prominent with a complex blend of hops and malt coming through. Lots of enjoyment even before you takes a sip. The flavors will blow you away! It starts out as a fine IPA with lots of hops coming through, then mid sip transforms to a Belgian style Trippel, malty, yeasty and wonderful! The Belgo is a great find. Take a six over to your most discerning beer snob friend and you will get the pick of the month award."
