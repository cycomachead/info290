"White Hatter brewed by New Holland Brewing Company, an has an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a cloudy amber color, with a small white head. There is a lot going on in this brew.  The smell is sweet, grains, and malts.  Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. You pick up on some citrus, malts, and hops. This is a nice drinking brew. The mouthfeel is bold , but clean, and relishing. Overall I'm giving White Hatter a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. New Holland Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. There is also some things floating in this brew, but it a nice drinking brew."
"Floral, hoppy aroma and flavor. Great with spicy food but to hoppy by itself for my taste."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while."
"Way under rated on this site.  Great tasting beer with great body and very drinkable.  This beer has won several awards for good reason......Great job New Holland!"

"Overall: Pretty tasty, better than I expected."

"To much sediment in this, big turn off. Then the flavors just did not mesh at all. I would pass on this one."
""
"Overall – A decent Belgian IPA.  Not bad overall, but nothing super exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely an interesting combination. I think if the wheat flavour had been toned down, and the hops bumped up, this would have been a pretty damn good beer. As it is it is only a decent beer. For the price though, I'll drink it and be happy."
""
""
"Here's the best I can do: this is distinctly indistinct...but not in a bad way. I said it...hope that helps."
"Tasty and more malt than any belgian white, but this is a belgian style pale ale so maybe i shouldnt compare.  Refreshing citrusy a bit of orange and grapefruit."
""
""
""
"Yums tasty. Yum yum yum. Drink this all day. Hey hey"
"New Holland makes some good beers; this is not one of them."
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. NOT a nice looking beer. Definitely unfiltered, light amber with very little head. Great carb bubbles though. Looked kind of like grapefruit juice. Some nice floral notes on the nose, also a bit of orange (and ironically grapefruit). Taste was v. nice... interesting yeasty and crisp malty notes (bit of biscuit?). Strong citrus punch. Much better than the aroma dictated. Rather light mouthfeel, with a clean aftertaste. Wasn't super excited to try his one, but there were some nice surprises anyways... unique and worth a go."

"O: I appreciate the grains of paradise and the more tropical notes for a Belgian; that made it very interesting. But, the lack of carbonation and any bite made it pretty mediocre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice and flavorful citrusy wit. The bitterness is not as pronounced here as it has been in other examples of the style I have had. This is a beer I would reach for if I wanted this style."

"I agitated the beer prior to my usual aggro pour and as such, I stirred things up real good. It came rushing out, filling the glass with a pseudo-cascade and producing two fingers of mountainous, fluffy, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was a VERY cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose had a musty citrusiness, kind of lemony, but also very dry and dusty like newspapers in an attic. Mouthfeel was soft, caressing my poor, bruised tongue like an old friend. This was like hops tea! It was really mellow, with loads of flavor, like lemon zest, mango, peach, pear, garden flowers and some black pepper. i felt like I was being lulled into a nap. The finish was quite dry, thanks to the spices, but on a hot, humid afternoon, I really enjoyed it."

"This is my first review of a New Holland beer on here.  Had this poured into a weizen glass.  Pale golden color, clearer than I would have expected.  Subtle malt and spice flavors, neither of which were as strong as I expected, not a lot of the flavors you'd expect to get from a wheat come through. Soft mouthfeel, didn't have a ton of head on this one.  It was decent, just a little ho-hum."

"Final Word: Sorry folks, but I don’t recommend this one! I’m always reluctant to tell people not to try a beer, but this one just felt like New Holland needs a bit more time to perfect it. The hop and wheat flavors countered each other very well, but the sticking point with this beer was the bubblegum fluoride aroma and flavor. Some wheat beers have a bit of a bubblegum flavor in them, but the degree to which it’s present in this beer is completely out of balance with the other ingredients. It doesn’t complement nor mesh with the other flavors, and doesn’t seem to have a place in the brew. I don’t feel like this is a problem inherent to the fact that it’s a Belgian Style White Pale Ale, but instead that it’s a sub par batch or a recipe that needs perfection. If you’re the type that wants to try something new, I’d wait a year or two and see if this brew is still around, as by then I’d say they’ll have worked out the kinks or you have a chance of getting a better batch than I did, but otherwise I’d choose many other wheaty beers over this one if I wanted that fix. But hey, if you love bubblegum fluoride, have at it!"

"This offering makes for a nice smooth session beer on a warm summer day but there is nothing extraordinary here."

"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer with good flavor and great body."

"i am quite surprised to see this beer rather so low on here. i find it delightful, and different from the rest. the belgian yeast isnt nearly so ester laden, not so fruity and dominating, its just drying and complimentary to everything else going on. wheat base is a little darker than most, with a bronze hue to it and a nose propelled primarily by the orange. seems like more than just orange peel, but flesh too, especially in the flavor, like it was just fresh squeezed right in. the chamomile is subtle in this, but adds another layer thats accentuated by the yeast. more green tea bitterness than anything else, herbal, fun, bright. its hopped more like an american pale ale than an ipa to me, not subtle, but not huge and oily and bitter either. its in the middle somewhere, with hops that balance and add backbone to the citrus of the orange. the finish is clean and light, and thats where i taste the belgian yeast the most. great carbonation, thicker body for the style too, which makes it rather satisfying. a very cool take on the style, and i think this beer deserves a little more credit than it currently has. not the best white ipa out there, but one of the more interesting ive had lately."

"O: A near incredible Belgian IPA that, judging from previous reviews, does not get the credit it deserves. Really well executed with an exceptional malt body and unique hopping (I love the combination of Brewer's Gold, Glacier, Motueka, and Crystal), this one is definitely worth a try."
""
""
"O - A good example of the style, not my favorite but an awesome summer time brew I'm happy to drink any time."
""

""

""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Wheat beer. Good mix of spices and fruit esters with a nice hop kick."
""
""
""
"O: I see what they're trying to do here. A WPA - blending a Belgian wit and an IPA. Seems more like a Belgian pale to me. No IPA characteristics at all. The orange peel overwhelms the hop character."
""
""
"I’m not quite sure what the reason was to brew this beer – as it warmed up, still no flavor or aroma, just developed a more lively carbonation. For me, this beer has to be described in null terms. It was cellared by a six-pack store in Erie under low light conditions at about 29 degrees C. At least it was not offensive, kind of like drinking a weak sparkling water."

"Overall: I applaud this beer for being highly unique. The interesting combination of flavors and smells, along with that distinctive mouthfeel, make for a very memorable experience. It is listed here as a Belgian Pale Ale, which it is not, but I honestly don’t know what else to call it. I’m guessing that’s what the brewers had in mind. I wish that my bottle had been a little fresher as I would really like to like it more. I’ve tried to neutralize the aging flaws in my rating (3.5/5)."

"Great hoppy flavor that is quite earthy with a little pine. Definite pale malt character and a little earthy yeast character as well. An interesting blend of a white ale's starchy/estery/spiciness and an IPAs sharp bitterness and pine/citrus hop character. Definitely refreshing and earthy overall."
""
""

"Had this on tap at Public House in Norfolk. Poor's a light lemony golden color with a thin white head that sticks to the glass as you drink. Smell of slight lemon grass and wheat, citrus hop aroma fallows. Taste of slight malty wheat and lemon peel. The hops have a very piney quality at the end. I enjoyed this beer, very drinkable especially for the summer months. A fairly overlooked brew with a unique quality."
""

""

"Although this wasn't strong, it felt a bit more potent than it was in actuality. This was pretty unique but only because I've never had a Belgian IPA that was supposedly brewed like this. The bottle says that there were notes of coriander and grains of paradise here, along the lines of a Sam Adams Summer offering. While they could be detected to some extent, the citrus bite faded quickly after the initial kick. Had they endured longer, it would have rounded out this beer nicely and complemented the Belgian aspects of this. Take it for what it is - it's a fun style that served as a steppingstone for what else is possible and still went down relatively easily."
""
""
"Very similar to new holland's monkey king. Initial sweetness fades quickly to spicy yeast flavors and earthy and herbal hop flavor. The bitterness tends to mask some of the belgian flavors. Besides a lot of spicy yeast flavor. Very herbal, some faint fruit underneath it all, almost apple like. Bitterness lingers with an apple like sweetness lingering on the tip of the tongue. Medium bodied with prickly mouthfeel. Beer gets a bit better as it warms as your tongue grows accustomed to the bitterness as well. Let's some of the more subtle flavors come through and shows off the complexity of the beer. Flavors are a little muddled and some greatly overpower others."

"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. Slightly dry finish."

"Pours into a tall Prima Pils glass with a turbid glowing orange amber hue with a bright light off white head forming thick, you can see proteins and yeast sediment suspended in the body. Aroma is full of citrus, spice, and orange peel notes. A nice bready yeast/malt combo going on, almost like a Sam Adams Summer Ale I also notice grains of paradise on the ingredients listed on the bottle. Flavors are really combined into a spice mix pack with a mediocre IPA with citrus forward hops. Very dry presentation the bitterness comes from the spices, orange peel, and hop additions. Somewhere in the mad mix of adjuncts you have a drinkable beer, medium bodied spritzy carbonation, dry bitter finish. Overall not a bad beer and much better than some of the other White IPAs I have tangoed with."
"O: Ok beer, not the best example of the style I've had but definitely not a bad beer. It seemed like they didn't commit to which of the two characteristics they want to feature. It wasn't very IPA like nor belgian like. Sort of a bland mashup of the two. Easy drinking and not a bad beer but probably won't seek it out again."

"O: A distinct and unusual flowery PA."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a fluffy white head, as expected, that dissipates quickly. Orange, coriander, and chamomile in the aroma. Light, crisp, and very refreshing. Mostly citrus fruit flavor, but piney hops come in at the end. Especially noticeable in the bitter finish. This is a sacchariferous and subtle beer, with balance from the hops to keep it from getting cloying. Clocks in at just 5.5% ABV, so several of these on a warm summer night would do quite well."

"Pours a hazed white-yellow with a white sizzling, crackling head that forms a pillowy foam. Laces the glass expertly and looks like a good looking Witbier. Smell of citrus, herbs, lemongrass, bread. In the taste, some lemony citrus, green banana, coriander, orange peel and pine all join together. Strongly bitter, which works well with the citrus peel and lemony wheat notes. Medium bodied feel, well carbonated and finishes with citrus and hop. Overall, this was a very good beer. I would certainly have it again sometime, as White Hatter makes for a refreshing drink."
""
"Poured into a small tulip glass a slightly orange tinged lemony yellow with a half finger white head that left a few broken chunks of lace as it settled pretty quickly.Spiced phenols and tropical citrusy fruits really stand out in the nose over top of toasted grain.Very citrusy on the palate,I mean the citrus really jumps out at ya,mild phenols and again toasted grain underneath.Not bad with it's big citrusy flavors but not real overly complex."
""
"A BPA? That's a stretch. I'll say it was fun."
""
"I haven't had anything that I've truly *REALLY* enjoyed from New Holland, and White Hatter is no different. It's a decent beer, but it's not all that interesting or memorable."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it was a good example of the style, it had a nice combination of both styles that was kept very balanced which worked out nicely and I thought the hops complemented the base beer nicely. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these on a nice summer day, the taste keeps me coming back for more. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, both styles were represented nicely, they worked well together and seemed to complement each other. There wasn't anything that I disliked about this beer, it was fine just the way it was. I would buy this beer again, I thought it was good and priced nicely and I would recommend it to just about anyone. All in all I was impressed with this beer and it turned out better than I expected and I like it much more than Mad Hatter. This was another good beer from New Holland, keep up the good work guys."
""
"Beer pours a cloudy golden color with two fingers of coarse soapy white head. Good lacing on the glass. Very yeasty nose. The flavor profile doesn't really work. Yeasty funk overwhelms and doesn't allow the more nuanced flavors and spices typical of a wheat beer to shine through. Not terrible, but it clearly misses the mark. Wont be getting this again."
"Not a bad beer with a desent depth of flavor."
""
""
""
"O - Would definitely recommend. If you like Mad Hatter you will enjoy White Hatter. Really hits the spot if you want some hops in your life but arn't feeling the bitterness of an ipa."
"O - Good American made BPA."

"O: Nothing overly special here, although I am sure it could be used to great effect in getting Blue Moon fans to venture out into the beer world."
""
"This is a pretty nice, well balanced, drinkable white IPA. It has a nice herbal hop character as well as an enjoyable citrus note. The nose was tremendous. Overall, very enjoyable. It's definitely worth a try though it won't appease those looking for something dominantly hoppy or dominantly belgian-y."
""
""

"Decent BPA. Not bad, but nothing special. This would be nice for spring/summer/warm weather."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a hopped up, overly spiced witbier."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a pale, almost translucent orange - lots of visible carbonation and a small amount of white head that disperses quickly. Smell is very potent out of the bottle, dominated by coriander and citrus, but it fades almost as soon as it is poured into the glass. Taste is similar, some coriander, some orange and lemon flavors, and a lingering bitterness that is probably the hops and maybe the chamomile flavors mentioned on the bottle. Mouthfeel is pretty thin with heavy carbonation. Overall this is a pleasant Belgian White."
"O- easy drinking Belgian pale, nothing extreme, but enjoyable on a warm day."
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable. In my opinion a pretty typical new holland brew, nothing mind blowing, nothing awful, nothing shocking... ect"
""
""
""
"O: A great beer for a summer's eve, more complex than Hoegaarden and Blue Moon. Not too overwhelming, nice fruitful light beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me, this seems to lean into Belgian IPA territory. The back label basically states as much, and there are definitely hop tones going on here. Somewhat earthy with spice tones on there and the typical Belgian characteristics. It works for me and I like it."
""
"O- This beer starts of pretty tasty but it falls off quickly to a harsh odd hop flavor and the yeast character disappears as well."
"An interesting take on the Belgian PA from New Holland. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it."
""
"Overall disappointing on two fronts; firstly my brother who got me a few hatters said it was his favorite; secondly compared to the Farm House Hatter (consumed the previous night) it was a let down"
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? yes."
""
""
""
"Meh, it's a pretty average beer that doesn't offer much."
"O: Enjoyable and mildly memorable. Would order another, only possibly will buy again. I think a white IPA would be less funky and more hoppy and coriander-y."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an easy drinking white IPA and I liked it"
""
""
""
"3.0 D: Decent beer, but I was looking forward to drinking a wit. Oh well, I know now. Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
"Disappointing. I've enjoyed the Hatters over the years, & this one is by far the weakest of the bunch. Not bad by any measure just kind of...there. There Hatter. Present Hatter. Mediocre Hatter. There you go."
"The New Holland White Hatter is very nice. I am trying a 2012 vintage. I poured the beer in a tulip glass and it is light copper with thin white head that is leaving a slight lace. The smell provides coriander and slight pine tones. The taste has the scent plus some peppery kicks. The mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer and certainly worth a try."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage(June release). Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, pepper, wheat, coriander, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of lemon, pepper, clove, orange zest, herbal, wheat, earth, floral, coriander, grapefruit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, coriander, wheat, clove, earth, floral, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Medium high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly sticky and quite crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian White. Awesome balance of hops flavor, spices, and yeast character; and extremely crisp and smooth to drink. Fantastic, and I really did not expect it to be as good as it was. A welcomed surprise."
""
"Overall - Refreshing is the word. Great for a sunny summer day; only draw-back being that it's not really a sipping beer -- you could down this stuff like gatorade (at four times the price and alcohol). Very much a seasonal beer, but an overachiever in its own right: Strongly recommend."
""
"Yes, very good indeed. Couldn't quite put my finger on the unique flavor... but on reading other review, yes I think it is grapefruit rind. Good summer brew. Only problem is that its hit or miss on whether stores have in stock. (The remainder of this review is to bump me up to the 250 character minimum.)"
""
""
"This beer pours hazy orange with an underwhelming white head. The beer has a ligt fruity aroma from the hops. This beer is all about the hops. The hop profile is really mid country, there is a lot of pineapple, orange, and lemons zestas well as a lot of other fruity notes. I did not get much of the ""white"" aspect of this beer but I bet it would be easier to differentiate by doing a side by side with the classic mad hatter. Drinks really easy and quite refreshing. A great white IPA, if my memory serves me right I like this more then the original but I didn't have the original fresh from the tap."
""
"O: Very enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale. Really enjoyed the aromatics and flavors and the slight hint of coconut makes this brew different from most others and I found it very enjoyable. Would love to try it on tap to compare."
"O: Nice white ale, almost witbeer like malting with a pale ale bitterness that was smooth, tart but refreshing as a summer drink."
""
""
""
"O - This is an interesting ale. It definitely blurs style boundaries."
""
"Overall, a good belgian-influenced wheat beer with substantial complexity. Finish was a bit short and dry."
"O - New Holland's White Hatter is a harmonious masterpiece that could quite possibly be my favorite of their offerings! This delicious treat skillfully blends a moderately hopped IPA with the subtleties and drinkability of a witbier for a refreshing, super-tasty outcome! Hats off to you New Holland!"
""
""
"22oz bottle. Rigorous pour reveals a hazy, golden/pale rust colored ale with a bubbly, white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity grapefruit zest, wheat, biscuit, orange zest, Belgian yeast. Tastes are orange peel, orange pith, grapefruit, chalk, wheat, coriander, pine, acetylsalicylic acid. Body is medium with higher carbonation, finishes bitter and astringent. Overall, it's good, but the aspirin notes coupled with its dry finish takes away from it."
"Cap says, ""cheese."". While I know the caps are pretty much random words, I'm thinking a mild flavored Havarti or Gouda might work here."
"Drinks easy, not a great BPA, but not too bad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bomber bottle from The Wine Seller in A2. A nice light IPA. Pours a hazy light golden color with a massive frothy head when poured. Smells a bit funky, with definite pine hops and some lemon peel. Equal notes of IPA with the pine and light lemon, and spicy belgian Witbier with the hint of honey sweetness and clove. Light mouthfeel and plenty of carbonation. Not usually big on this style but though that this was nicely done."
""
""
"But somehow I rather enjoyed this hastily stitched together beer. I still feel that witbier is a formidable base style to experiment with high hop character. Although it's alcohol is slight and and the support is sparse, I rather enjoy the complex complement of spice to hops and feel there's a lot of potential if the witbier part were more authentic."
"But not a bad experiment, in the least. And, actually, what do you know, but halfway in, the best of it's parts outshine the least. Liking it more."
"Poured into a pint glass. The appearance is slightly hazy and very faint straw in color. Thin white head with dense bubble has nice retention and a considerable amount of lacing. The nose is very spicy with significant waves of coriander, cloves, orange peel along with plenty of earthy hops. The nose is incredibly floral and fragrant. The taste matches the nose with flowers and spices up front. The beginning is all White Ale, the finish features a nice wave of hop bitterness. This is an interesing combo, reminds me of some of the other Belgian Pale Ales with more spices. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing wiith a nice balance. Overall, this is worth a try. Not the best of the ""Hatter"" variants, but interesting nonetheless."
"O: Really not much of a Belgian Pale with only a light amount of Belgian yeast characteristics and just not a whole lot of anything else in the mix. Simplistic, watery, and, in the end, just a fairly average beer."
""
""
"Light bodied with average carbonation, and a dry finish. I have liked the other beers in the Hatter series, but this one is not to my liking. Trying to merge a Belgian Pale Ale with a Witbier is a bad idea."
"Hazy light golden with a finger of persistent head, leaves copious lace. Smell is simply faint. Slightly fruity, hoppy I suppose, but that's stretching it. Taste is lightly hoppy, citric, fruity, tropical, refreshing. I'm not sure if it's Belgian or a pale ale, but it's pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is medium to light, but it fits the style with a crisp carbonation. Not much on the nose, but no matter, it's a tasty beer."
""
""
"This one is worth checking out, especially if you are not a style purist sort of person."
