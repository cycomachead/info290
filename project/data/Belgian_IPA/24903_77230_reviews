"Pours a nice yellow color with a fluffy, cloud of white head. Smell was that of fresh cut grass and citrus. Taste was a full on hoppy blast mixed with grass and citrus and some what floral. Overall a great IPA!"

"A different IPA experience."
"The taste and color of a great ipa!"
""
"Lots of bottle variability on this one.  I've had a few gushers with corks hitting the ceiling and two totally flat nearly undrinkable bottles.  This beer is good but I would avoid aging or buying old bottles."

"O: Intriguing for sure. When I'd had enough citrus I could focus on the funk. Kept my attention the whole bomber through, although by the end the lemon did start wearing on me- I could have appreciated a wider variety of hop flavors. My bottle was about a year and half old, I wonder how long it should be kept so that the funk becomes the main component?"
""
"Bright golden color, foamy and cloudy, citrahop sour, coriander, very crisp and light.  Great White IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this isnt that impressive of a beer, especially from Anchorage Brewing, they put too much time into trying to re create the IPA and failed miserably. This is a completely unbalanced beer and has funky bitterness from places that shouldnt contribute to the taste of a great IPA. I can only hope that Bitter Monk is their answer to this."
""
"Delicious, smooth drinkable white ipa. The kumquat add a odd but enjoyable sweetness. Very good, a must try."
""
"O- A damn tasty Brett IPA.  I kind of wish this came out in the summer since it would taste even better under the hot sun.  All the ingredients in this beer work harmoniously to create a unified flavor profile."
""
""
"Light, Lacey, quickly fading head. Good lacing. Pale yellow in color. Not a lot of smell to it. Flavor was a bit off to me at first. Half way through the first glass the hops, kumquats, and peppercorns became very detectable. Very tasty after getting used to it. I'd buy it again, maybe age it.."

"M/D- This is a highly carbonated beer, as noted before, and scrubs the palate very much so!  It's a decent balance between bitter and citrus that, while I find thin bodied, is very refreshing and I'm finding it very easy to get through this 750ml bottle quickly.  The alcohol is hidden very well but will sneak up on a person I'm guessing.  I'm pleasantly surprised that I am enjoying this as much as I am, as I'm not a huge IPA guy, but the melding of styles works beautifully!  I recommend this one and would have no issues picking this up again!"

"Overall (4.0): This beer is a bit all over the place, but in a thoroughly entertaining way. The appearance is excellent but a little non-standard for the style; the aroma is funky and slightly off-kilter, but bright and aromatic at the same time; the flavor is very complex with some unexpected characters, but well-crafted; and the feel is as close to perfect as anything could be, especially how well it complements the flavor. Some things don’t mesh at all times, and I’ve never been big on the garlicky hop notes, but it still works. This is just a very complex, deeply interesting brett beer, and I like it. (Still like Bitter Monk better, though. :-)"

"A very complex brew. The bottle is from April and still hoppy, but I would like to age a bottle and see how the beer evolves and if there is a sense of the Brett that I did not get this time."
""
""
"Overall: This is a damn fine brew. Refreshing, balanced and funky with still an earthy hop quality. Tropical goodness with spicy overtones. Do you crave Wits to be on the hoppy side? I know I do! This brew is recommended."
"750 ml corked bottle poured in a chalice.  The bottle has two intro paragraphs describing various frontiers of human achievement, plus some information about the white IPA in the bottle.  Quite amusing.  The beer pours yellow in color, with a thin white head.  The first smell that hit my nose was grapefruit, then a bit of tangerine.  A lot of citrus and fruit notes.  The taste is like a fruit salad at first, transitioning to a bitter hop flavor once it reaches the back of your palette.  The finish is a bit of oak and herbs, and the spices are noticeable.  Overall, excellent."

"Pours a clear straw yellow with rocky white head, rings of lace down the glass. Smell: dough, hay, citrus rind, pepper, barnyard and dried pineapple notes. Taste: orange citrus, light stone fruit sweetness, coriander. Herbal in the finish. Dry, slightly sticky finish. April 2014 bottling. Get the dregs in the glass and more dried pineapple and oak comes out."

"O - This is the first time I have seen this (or any Anchorage beer) in Delaware. Hoppy Belgian beers are typically among my favorites so I had high hopes for this one. I couldn't have asked for more in the aroma. It is a complexity of brett, citrus, hops, and spices. The flavors followed suit, but I would have liked a little more. There are no flavors out of place, but the flavor came off a bit diluted, the more I drank. A great beer, but I was looking for something with more flavor. Still among the best int he style I have ever had. Well done, but I won't be running back to the store to get another $11 bomber."

"Bitter Monk and Darkest Hour are more stupefying offerings from Anchorage Brewing Co. and encourage all who read this to investigate these brands."
""

"This one drinks like a mix between a belgian IPA and a saison. I like what it's trying to do but I don't think it was successful. I'm also not sure time was kind to this. There are a fair amount of hops but the hop flavors are not fresh. The Brett is very developed and the additives make for an interesting and very fruity experience. But it just doesn't come together for me. Add in some off flavors and I will pass next time."

"O: This beers struts some impressive plumage but ultimately falls flat. I may have to get used to this style and then give it another try."
"Overall - This is an acquired taste that I have learned to appreciate over the past year or so. This particular brew has more balance that other ""brett bombs"" I have had. Tasty and refreshing, relies less on fruit than non-brett whites, however, both have their respective places. This is the brett counterpart to Allagash White."

"Thin bone white head, mostly loose and bubbles off swiftly, very bright and seems to reflect light nicely, the lacing is the sort which initially forms a very thin yet broad sheet but has little stick and as a whole it just glides down the glass sides. Cloudy yet bright canary yellow colored liquid, very difficult to see any bubbles inside the glass, warm luminescence to it. The nose most prominently hits you with tart white grapefruit notes, lots of salty accents and burnt dark bread crusts, more finished bread than yeasts, quite grassy, there’s something like an herb infused olive oil thing going on too, maybe pineapple or nectarine but you would be hard pressed to call the scents fruity. Medium-bodied, the carbonation swells immediately through the attack which gives it a creamier mouth feel, needed for when that lemon and white grapefruit citrus slash on through. Pepper and salt, green grass, clove and coriander, all contribute to a bright, tangy experience. Here the peach, apricot, nectarine and persimmon fruit is sweeter and more longlasting. There is a certain vinous quality, not sure I’d call it out and out bretty, likewise the yeasts are tame and not particularly softening. Fresh finish, given the elements it throws at you remains very good on the drinkability scale."
""
""
""
"D/O: An excellent brett beer, this Belgian-style strong pale ale struggles to live up to the IPA label. Instead, it delivers an austere dose of wild yeast funk with little associated tartness."

" If there's another Belgian IPA that's better, someone please hip me to it. This is fantastic, although I couldn't possibly justify the $16.99 price tag as a regular in the rotation and that's a shame. I will however be grabbing at least a few more of these to cellar for the long haul the next time I see it."
"Overall- Good to really good beer. Doesn't do anything amazing but is impressive in its delicacy. Definitely worth a try but try to find it on tap. I'm on the fence whether it's worth the bottle price."
""
"I split a bottle of this with a friend tonight, 1/17/14. It was from batch #5, July/13. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. This brewery has yet to do anything but bow my mind. My only regret is that I don't live close enough to frequent the brewery. At least there is another bottle in the fridge I can drink tomorrow."

"A very nice Belgian/white IPA. Bitter with spices in the right places. I'll be giving Anchorage my patronage in the future."
"This starts off interesting, and actually gets more interesting as you make your way to the bottom of the glass. The use of Brett is quite lovely, and the hops have held up (even through this is months old at this point). This is the first beer I've had from Anchorage, and it's far from a disappointment."
""
"Two finger bright white head with excellent lacing on a cloudy pale golden body. Aroma is strong and full with coriander dominating and notes of yeast, pale malts, herbal hops, lemon zest and peppercorn. Citrus aroma from white pineapple and tangerine. Flavor reminds of Saison with a lot of yeast and coriander throughout. Lemongrass herbal notes, white pepper, tropical citrus, clove and chardonnay wine. Medium body, semi dry finish and moderate carbonation. Complex, unique and memorable. Galaxy hops paired well with this combination which has a lot going on but the drinker isn't overwhelmed."

"O- My first from this brewery and I look forward for many more to come. Happy to see they have finally got distribution in MO. Balanced, complex, cracked pepper crispness, and journey of bold flavors that seem to explore something new with every sip."

"An easy drinking and tasty Belgian IPA from Anchorage. It's so good to have them return to St. Louis."
""
""

"OVERALL : Very impressive beer. Very original mixture of ingredients. Bold and intelligently crafted. I'll be aging some of them, the brewers say the brettanomyces come out a lot more given time. I'm curious to see what it'll be like. I'll probably send out another review for an aged bottle."

"The problem with beers like this, incredibly hoppy / citrusy but bone dry, is that much of the juicy citrus character is lost in the flavor due to the dryness. This beer is a testament to the wonders of Indian coriander, it doesn’t have that dirty herbal character that western coriander does and it really integrates very nicely with the kumquat and Galaxy hops; interestingly enough, I hadn’t realized that coriander and kumquats were used here; I wholly attributed their flavor contributions to the hops, but now having read the label they most definitely contribute. The pepper to adds a nice spiciness to this brew that was again mistaken for hop character. Back to the problem, without the residual malt sweetness that even supports the driest of the usual IPAs, this beer has lost the juicy citrus character that would be otherwise be noticeable in the flavor. While I have compared this a lot to an IPA, it is clearly not one, given the interpretive take the style can have, I would say this fits into the Saison category (at least better than it fits anywhere else). Since I do love hoppy and I do love Saisons, this beer is right up my alley; exceedingly enjoyable and I doubt I will be able to hold on to my second bottle long enough to allow the Brettanomyces presence to increase much."
""
"Lots and lots going on flavor wise but it all comes together pretty nicely for me. I like the way the Brett, spices and big fruity flavors work with each other."
""
"Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. The white IPA is style I don't usually care for, but I like the Belgian / Brett twist here."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; batch 3, bottled 8/2012. Cork shot the ceiling upon cage removal. Pours lightly cloudy bright golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, pepper, clove, coriander, white wine, light oak, floral, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and wine barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, peach, pineapple, pear, pine, coriander, clove, pepper, white wine, light oak, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Moderately earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, peach, pineapple, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, white wine, light oak, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and moderate wine barrel flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic wild Belgian IPA! All around awesome balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and barrel flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Too much attempted and not enough results in the taste experience (wood aged! Galaxy hops! Spices! Brett!) Still I give them props for trying this"
""

"I wouldnt buy this again."
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the story on the back of the bottle, and the idea of it that they executed. Seriously though, read the back of the bottle if you have the opportunity, because it is especially inspiring. That aside, the most enjoyable quality of the beer itself was its taste. The nose starts off nicely, giving bright florals and grain against the included advertised ingredients. The Bretty remains ever pervasive, but really begins to pop in the flavoring, even as the aroma fades into booziness with warmth. The taste, again, shows all of what you would expect, with bitterness from the whole peppercorns and citric kumquat inclusions alike. The oak, coriander spiciness, and Brett also blend through the finish, giving a final picture of cohesion and fullness. This is reflected in the creamy feel, which helps keep the aforementioned robustness in check. While certainly made headway on “the trail” with this one, with the wildness of the yeast and the unconventional fruit and spice, hopefully those to follow with further mold and refine what Anchorage classifies as their “White IPA”."

"I wanna make a Men in Black reference, but after witnessing the horror of the third film, I'm not even gonna bother. This stuff pours a hazy auburn-brass topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises funky Brett, grapefruit rind, mild grass, and a touch of lime. The taste brings in more of the same, with the Brett hamming it up on stage and some lemon and lime trying their best to blend into the background. Some minor notes of earth and wood (need we build a log cabin in Louisiana?) sneak in there as well, but aren't able to cause much of a ruckus. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, this seems like a godsend for any lovers of Brett and/or hops. For me, I felt the Brett overdid it a bit, but not by too much."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It's brett done right, with the added bonus of really refreshing hop components. Solid on all accounts. I'd love to drink more of this in the future."
""
"O: This is different, complex, and while I don't love it I definitely like it. If you don't tolerate brett well, you may not want to pick this up. If you don't mind it, it's definitely worth trying"
""
""
"O - Well this was my first 'White IPA', although it reminded me more of a brett saison, which isn't a bad thing. Very complex, and even more so as it warms. They took a risk doing as much with the beer as they did, but damn if it didn't pay off. I would like to try a fresh bottle at some point to compare experiences."

"Caged and corked 750mL bottle pours with a pale yet bright gold body with faint haze supporting a tall densely cobwebed white head of foam. The aroma offers up lime, tangerine, grapefruit and a sour lime sort of wild yeastiness. The taste has a very effervescent quality and it is so much so it is tough to sink you teeth into the experience. I’m getting fruity and tart grapefruit notes that are sliding into lime like citrus and some citrusy tartness. Pretty nice but the huge carbonation detracts from the experience."
""

"O: I'm not one to think too highly of beers that push the edge but this one is pretty interesting. And it just keeps getting better and better as I linger over it. I don't think that it's completely together but it's pretty darn good. I'll definitely look and buy another bottle."
"O: A complex, strange beer but so thoroughly enjoyable"
""
"Brought back from Maine 750 ml cork and cage. Slight misfiring cork grazed the side of my head before ending up across the room. Pours out half foam atop a cloudy light straw liquid. Lots of lace and mad retention. The aroma is certainly tart and a bit funky. Saison like aroma with lots of spice a bit of tart citrus and tropical fruits with some hops still evident and a vinous character deep underneath. The flavor is more funk than tart with bits of citrus evident as well as some light wine notes. Medium to light body with a huge level of carbonation and a dry crisp funky mouthfeel. Nice beer but not much of an IPA after a years aging. I enjoyed this aside from the cork headache."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light with ample carbonation. Very good for the style. Overall, I thought this was a very good Belgian IPA. I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one was very well done. The prominent funk aside, lots of great tropical fruit scents and flavors make this beer a good one to try."

"First Alaska rate! Pours cloudy yellow with a massive light fluffy head that explodes up the glass. Aroma is big lemon peel, oak, funky brett, some light spices and hints of earthy hops. More of a farmhouse ale than an IPA on the nose. Light bodied with lots of carbonation (maybe too much?). Flavor is dusty bitter up front, followed by a bit of pine hop, and then finishes with some sweet lemon and pineapple. Sour kumquattyness. Very, very dry to the point that I need a drink of water afterward. The up front bitter is unpleasant and seems a bit off for my liking. I could definitely see this as a summer beer, and it drinks extremely light for 7.5%. But overall I am much less impressed with this than others. The appearance and huge carbonation hurt the final rating, but it seems to have hit what they were going for."
""
""
"Overall, I came into this beer pretty excited. I dig hops, brett, and witbier. This one just didn't come together well. The barrel is hidden by the bold hopping, as is the wit yeasts and spices. The brett comes through, as does the kumquat, but none of these flavors are in harmony and treat the pallate more like a battlefield than anything else. Glad I tried it, but won't be goiing back for more."
"Nearly a year past bottling date, it's taken on a distinctly saison-esque flavor profile, with the pepper and brett really doing a number on things here. There's also a solid hop presence still lingering, providing a fruitiness and a nice background bitterness. It's an extremely dry beer, with the brett and hops contributing strongly to that. So much going on here that it's really not worth picking apart in the review, each sip reveals new facets. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, highly carbonated, and (as before mentioned) very dry. Overall, Anchorage's Galaxy White IPA has held up very well a year past bottling. It's very interesting, extremely complex, and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"D - I'd like to try this again fresh to see how intense the Galaxy hops are, but even with age this is a really nice mix of hops, brett, and adjuncts. Nice to see that these Anchorage beers hold up over time too. Very enjoyable, but I expect nothing else from Gabe."
""
""
""
"O: Why you would call this an IPA, I don't know, but it's an interesting, complex beer to sip on the porch when the weather changes. An excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: With the bit of age this bottle had on it, I suspect that the Brett character has gotten more pronounced. This was quite enjoyable, although it isn't drinking too much like an IPA at this point. Two beers from Anchorage, and two big winners in my book!"
""
"I'm not digging on peppercorns in my beer and/or this seemed to have a pretty heavy dose of such. Smells lighter than it tastes. If you find yourself loving this, try Poivre Noir from Pipeworks. Wish this was more refreshing-bummer."
"This is a really nice, very complex, highly drinkable offering from a solid brewery. This beer is truly impressive. Each sip revealed a new flavor. This beer was so intricate that I know this review won't do it justice. It is definitely worth a try."
""
"Overall - nope. I'll have to find someone to trade for the other bottle, not interested in seeing how much funkier this can get over time."
""
""
"O- A nice balance of brett, galaxy, and the additional citrus fruit. A bit too crisp for me, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
""
"A really unique beer, in my opinion, and probably the first ""IPA"" I've had that might actually age nicely due to the brettanomyces and wine yeast. It'd probably develop into something completely different than what I've had today, but it would be an interesting experiment."
"MOMMA Lucia Im diggin it!"
""
"A very interesting beer. More of a saison than an IPA. And with a hefty 18 dollar price tag, no where near worth it. Of course I am drinking this on the east coast and it may have lost an edge in transit. The Brett is drying the beer out and over carbing it in the process. I would say drink it if you got it. Or you'll be chasing the cork and foam all over the kitchen."
""
"O-really enjoyed this white IPA, the flavors were good and well-balanced"
"An easy drinking WIPA with a good depth of flavor. The only drawback is the attenuation."
""
"Overall a quality beer. I must be honest that I expected to be more blown away, but it seems like White IPAs tend to peak sooner than 12 months after bottling. I have another bottle, so I may have to see if extensive aging allows the Brett to turn this into a completely different beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the entire drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, yeast, wine, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with wine and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but smells better in my opinion."
"O: A very refreshing beer. Great beer to have on a hot day."
"Light body and highly carbonation, bubbles gently sweeping across your tongue and wiping it clean. Very refreshing, and the flavors would go well complementing some food."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting and complex flavour profile, I have a feeling this beer will be like Orval where it will be very different and much more sour with some age on it. Actually, this seems more like a Belgian beer than a North American. Either way, this beer is fantastic."
""
""
"one of the more interesting and delicious beers ive had in some time. very very impressed with my first beer from anchorage. pours a hazy pale yellow color, creamy looking, with one of the most prominent, airy, long lasting, bone white heads ive ever seen, rising well above the rim of my globe. fluffy! the nose is crazy, lots of bitter hops, quite a bit of citrus too from the kumquats, and of course the brett, which is subtle but definitely a contributor. the flavor is super complex, but perfectly balanced. I would leave the coriander out, as I think it doesn't add a ton to the flavor that couldn't be there otherwise, but it does sort of crowd a some stuff out. wheat malt first, with the Belgian witbier yeast and some lemon pepper stuff, which I guess is aided by the peppercorn addition, works well with the yeast anyway. it gives way to a fruity hop bitterness that's really intense, and there is some acid from the wine barrels that exacerbates this. there is a ton going on here, and the bretty bitter finish is unique and memorable. white ipa with galaxy hops, coriander, kumquat, peppercorns, wit yeast, then aged in wine casks, dry hopped with galaxy, and conditioned with brett. its insane, and it works. light airy feel from the carbonation, it seems almost too light to handle all the flavor, but it does somehow. a really phenomenal beer that im sure a quantum physicist is behind, its just so advanced..."
"Well impressive. The interplay and balance between the IPA and Yeast characteristics is a thing to behold."
"The number of discriptors on this bottle is ridiculous. The cork hit the ceiling as it popped off. The beer pours a straw gold with a fluffy head that eventually fades. Brett is apparent in the aroma, with some tropical fruitiness from the hops (or maybe the cumquots, I have no idea). The flavor is dry with plenty of funky Brett, earthy hops, and some nice corriander and spice. The finish is bitter and dry with hits of oak. The bitterness lingers nicely. Pricey at $12 but delicious none the less."
"Liked it where I could've loved it."
""
"O: A gold standard for this new style?"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy white/yellow color ale with a super large pale white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry hoppy notes with some strong Brett notes also dominating. Taste is a mix between some solid wheat alt notes with some strong fruity and dry hops notes with a finish dominated by the funky Brett notes. Body is full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Really well put together with huge amount of complexity while retaining a great level of drinkability."
""
""
""
"A very unique beer. It is difficult to say what the aging in oak wine tanks has done, but there is a greater complexity present that I have difficult picking out the individual favors that may be due to the aging. Very enjoyable."
""
"Yep...brought a taste to a distinguished beer taster and she said bitter and gave me the puckering ""uh what's this"" expression. Not pretty. Still, I appreciate this...am amazed I guessed kumquats, find it bold and tasty, especially after some opening up, but unnecessarily complex, busy, bitter, and weird."
"O: A bit too bitter/resinous, good fruit character overall. May have been better a couple months ago but still solid. Not especially wit-like but good"
""
"Overall: a tasty beer. A Belgian style wheat beer. Not so much of an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is tangy and fruity as the aroma indicated with kumquat quality standing out with sweet and bitter citrus with peppery element from the hops and mild yeast with wheat sweetness and grapefruity bitterness with acidic finish. Overall a top notch drinkability for the style with very good blend of flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Complex and very unique in terms of flavor profile. I absolutely loved this beer, although I am quite the lover of all things hoppy and all things brett. There are many different parts of the brewing process that played major roles in the final product, frequently this would lead to a beer with muddled flavors, but not this one, incredible balance. Can't wait till my next trip to alaska, great fishing and now great belgian-style ales!"

"D: very tasty stuff. glad the Brett characteristics are as prevalent as I was hoping they would be. also, I would like to say this is one of the most appealing looking BIPA's I have seen ever. kudos to Anchorage for doing a stellar job with the bottle conditioning here."
""
""
""
"Overall: slow sipping beer and a bit too crisp here. Well balanced flavors and the oak and Brett make this very interesting."

"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a straw yellow color with a generous white head. A high level of carbonation made this one want to jump out of the bottle. I will forgive the minor inconvenience. The aroma was very discreet with floral notes and some Belgian accents. In the initial taste, I thought I was drinking soapy water. The citrus notes that come with the Brett combine with the floral notes to make me wonder if the glass was properly cleaned. The backbone of hops is mild, even for a Belgian IPA. The mouthfeel was aggressively bubbly, like drinking a warm can of Sprite. The carbonation mercifully subtracted the soapy taste from my mouth. I can not endorse this beer."
"Pours a straw almost white yellow color with a big three finger head despite a pretty easy pour. Thre are big lines of lace all over the glass. The aroma is of breadiness, lemon zest and floral and earthy hops. The aroma is deep and full. The taste is unique. There is a lemonzest and corriander taste up front along with brett. The middle waters out a little and you get belgian yeast and some funk. The back end is all hops, it is a floral earthy hop at the back end. Not overly bitter but it balances out very well. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, in fact when I uncorked the bottle i almost killed three people. Mouthfeel is stingy and bubbly. Overall it is a decent belgian ipa, it starts out strong but starts to fizzle a little at the end."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty impressive. Interesting hue, great primary head which settles to a nice secondary head. Pretty solid lacing, too. Nose is a sourdough bready tone, with plenty spice, floral, and some sweet components. Very well-balanced. Flavor is a buttery feeling combination of fresh flora, with pine and savory spice. Not too bitter, not too sweet...subtle all the way around, except for the steely, biting finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"As soon as i cracked the cage on top of the cork the cork blew straight off without even touching it and pours a hazy light yellow hue basically looks like urine and has a fluffy three finger rising head and similar lacing,the smell is flowers in bloom,oranges,herbacous hops and lavender,the mouthfeel is light bodied yet creamy and has tastes of kumquats,citrus,corriander,the slightest touch of spice and funk,pineapple and finished with a light zesty herbal hoppy bitterness and overall i like it and its definately something id buy again just like the rest of their range you have to try it."
"the carbonation is a bit bitting witch make it a bit hard to quaff but needless to say it's really enjoyable."

"O: this is good for its style but since I'm still not much of a fan of the lighter Belgian styles, just ok to me. I'll keep looking for lighter Belgians to try and maybe I'll find my niche in one of these things some day."
"O: Whats not to love when you have brett and the zing of galaxy hops. This white IPA is out of this world and delivers its name claim. Super complex yet well blended. Nothing over dominates but all layers work together in one harmonious universe of flavor."

""
"One complex beast of a Belgian-style IPA, with the overall effect well-skewed to the former - the fruit, yeast, and funk generally subsuming the hops in their tidy little cabal. Maybe it's the Galaxy hops, which I have yet to find worthy of providing a big IPA experience, but here, they're probably an unfair patsy, as there is just so much else going on, in a crazily, somehow balanced manner. A rather enjoyable tipple, and worthy of its entry into my little Boardwalk Empire-enhanced Volstead Act flight of fancy."
""
"One of the best beers I've had. Extremely complex and delicious. Looking forward to trying their Love Buzz Saison soon."
"If you like brett, you will like this."
""
"Overall- A unique Belgian IPA from Anchorage that pushes the envelope with some adventurous fruit flavours (peach for example). The flavours mingle well, making this an easy-to-drink Belgian IPA."
"Killer beer. A friend of mine tried it when it was fresh, and said it was an average IPA with some off flavors. I had a bottle last night that was bottled in January 2012, and it was amazing. Definitely let this beer age in the bottle for at least 6 months. The brett does it's thing, and the beer has amazing lemon and sour notes, but the galaxy still comes through. An effervescent and enjoyable beer..."
"O - A great take on a white IPA; the brett adds a nice layer of complexity while still keeping the balance in check. Stellar execution."
""
""
"O: I wrote in my notes: ""not fresh?"" I couldn't figure out when it was bottled at the time of my note-taking, but I was informed later that it was over 3 months old at that point. Still, having purchased it from a refrigerated store and also having spent about $15 on it, I had a reasonable expectation that this would be better than it was."
"As a side note, don't aim the cork at anyone. You could probably take someone's head off."
"Poured from the corked and caged bottle into a snifter. Body is a pale, hazy golden-white color topped by a huge, egg white head that slowly recedes to a thin coating. Aroma of mild wheat, citrus, and sharply floral spices--primarily coriander. Palate is a complex blend of citrus peel, dry wine yeast, light wheat, and a melange of spices. Finish is very zesty and sharply astringent. Body is lively and light, with a tangy, dry finish. This is a thoroughly interesting beer that has held up well after a few months of aging."
""
""
"Notes: Nice flow, same issues as before with the pricing but the quality is memorable. Really enjoying these brews."
""
""
""
"O:Would love to age this bottle but away from home... Extremely unique drinking experience. Recommend fresh to enjoy the hops on a farmhouse ale or age to enhance the funky yeast."
"Overall, another fine beer from a fine brewery."
"Overall, a strong entry in the field."
""
""
"O: Very well done. Anchorage is fastly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
""
"Overall another really great, creative beer from Anchorage."
"O - this one is tough to decipher, in some ways its unfocussed and busy, but I think most of the flavours do jive well enough to create a unique brew within this burgeoning style, may not be for everyone but you have to try it to make that call"

"Taste, chalky bretty, spice, coriander, mild citrus notes. Lacked the hops and bitterness of bitter monk. This was more like a wit straight up. It also lacked the tartness/sourness and acidity that I was hoping for. If I was in charge, this would have more hop character, and less belgian wit character. Alcohol seemed higher than their other beers that are actually higher in alcohol content. A little bit of grassyness to it as well. I dunno, I think they should drop the 'ipa' reference on the label. A decent beer, but nowhere near as good as the Bitter Monk, for many reasons."
"O: an interesting take on the style it's great to see a beer that is 100% barrel fermented and then finished with Brett tough to find and worth the wait"
"O-A nice interesting take on the style with the slight tartness. However more bitterness and hop flavors would have made this beer better."
""
"O: Overall sour lemony hops, drinks like a cross between a saison and wit. A lot of breweries hold back on the brett, this one is very well pronounced and goes balls to the wall. Slow methodical drinker, offers a varying degree of complexity and a good dose of brett."
""
"Interesting, lots of flavour, easy drinking. No complaints here."
""
""
""
"Have a big, thirsty towel handy when you open a bottle, because when you work off the cork guard - Houston, we have liftoff! Pours a hazy, barely translucent butterscotch yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head. Strong aroma is quite hoppy with a citrus undertone and a grassy hint. Hoppy flavor has lemon, grassy and even floral notes, with some hoppy bitterness. Body is good, fizziness strong; finish is hoppy and lemony. You can feel this one going down the pipes. A truly stellar beer."

"DELIGHTFUL, TREAT YOURSELF"

"M: Huge large carbonation, overcarbonated IMO but very refreshing until the end of the bottle."

"Anchorage's Galaxy White IPA pours a fairly hazy lemon yellow. Four fingers or so of frothy white foam balloons up to fill the top two thirds of the glass. Head retention is very good, but lacing is a bit on the spotty side. Eight to nine months after bottling, it's hard to rate this as a Belgian IPA, as it's more of a wild ale at this point. The nose has a good bit of barnyard funk to it, as well as a citric tartness to it. There's also the last remnants of some more tropical fruit aromas from the fading Galaxy hops. Again with the flavor profile, there's a strong funky, brett presence. I don't know what kumquats taste like, but given that they're related to oranges, I'm attributing to them the citrus bent that the light tartness here has. Just as with the nose, the fruity hop flavor is a shell of what it must have been soon after bottling. The body is wonderfully dry, and the carbonation is very lively. It could stand to be just a little bit more so, but it's still very close. I really dug this bottle of Galaxy White IPA, and I'd love to try one that's much more fresh, as I think it'd be a very different, but still very good beer."
"This is a fantastic beer with plus points for being highly original. A definite must try."
""
"I’m stoked to drink this one and could take down another 750ml no problem. The Brett’s already strong and I’m going to find out how funky this will get, I’m going to buy another to drink now and lay one down for fun"
""
"Try this beer."
""
"O: Fairly light and refreshing. The Galaxy hops combine well with the brett and wheat and spices. Very enjoyable and look forward to what is next from this brewery."
""
""
"While it seems like a lot thrown together coming into it, brewing expertise is showcased in that these guys can do so much without making it a muddled mes, and blending it all together so well. I hope they come out with more."
""
""
"O: I thought this was really good beer - has a lot going on, and I like the effect of brett in beers. Classified as a Belgian IPA, but open to interpretation. Hoppy, sure, but not really bitter. This is going to remind folks of farmhouse ales and witbiers. If you like ales with brett and barrel-aging, you will want to try this."
""

"Had as a part of a free tasting held at GBX! Served from bottle into a sampler shaker. Poured a pale yellow with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spice, coriander, funk, earth, fruit, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, fruit, wheat, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with very high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like the level of complexity that the Brett addition to the bottle added to this brew. This was a fairly light IPA as the name would imply, so the nice kiss of funkiness went really well here. Anchorage is definitely doing good things and I can't wait to try more offerings from them that I have not tried yet."
"Wasn't sure what to think of this one at first, but a few sips in and I was really digging it. IPA is a bit of a misnomer here, this is sort of an Imperial Wild Wit or something like that. Seek this one out."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch #2, April 2012. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a huge off-white head that grew for a while and took some time to settle. Also, there's a lot of lacing. The brew smells like lemon peel, brett, hay, peppery spice and some coriander. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also the addition of some white wine and pineapple flavors. I liked the taste of this beer more and more the longer I drank it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's very carbonated. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, although I do wish the carbonation was lower. $13.99 a bottle."
""
"Overall, not bad. I like it but was expecting more. I would not call this a Belgian IPA, but it is admittedly hard to classify. The brett aspect is most dominant, so perhaps an American Wild Ale."
""
""
""
"The brew is delicious. Anchorage really knows how to do these Belgians. I love their Love Buzz and this is right up there."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting well done beer. One of the better Belgian IPAs I've had. I still don't really love the blend of Belgian yeast and the hops - maybe fruitier hops would be better for me. I'd also like more Brett out of this one."
"Kosher certified."
"This is a re-write as apparently my first review was not committed to the database :( Picked up a bottle for $12.99 based upon my experience with Bitter Monk. First off this si much more of a wild ale than an IPA but that's ok. Bright white-yellow color. Smells a lot like the chardonnay barrel with hints of brett and stink. Flavor is mostly brett, fruit, citrus but not necessarily hops. good stuff and got me to pick up a bottle of whiteout wit."
""
""
"50 IBU"
"O- I honestly expected more. I was looking for an experience like Bitter Monk, and got a slightly tart white IPA. Disappointing overall, especially at $20/bottle"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a very musty, earthy flavor from the oak, brett and hops that dominates the flavor until it warms up a bit. Dry toasted oak, funky brett and coriander followed by earthy and citrus hops and vinous light fruit. Again, I'm not picking up the kumquats but they are possibly lingering underneath everything else. The peppercorn and coriander provide a dry spiciness that compliments the dry, resinous hop flavor. After a while, the white wine and bready yeast notes come forward. Pretty dry from all of these elements and the citrus characteristic from the galaxy hop and sweetness from whine and wit yeast are kind of overshadowed. Slightly tart and dry toward the finish but not sour. More funky than anything else. Pretty complex but could use some more sweetness for balance."
""
""
"I had a couple of samples of this at EBF 6 months ago and it was much different. Strong galaxy depth with Brett complimenting the profile. This bottle was all Brett. I am going to have to seek this one out again."
"O:n A very nice beer. Incredibly complex, yet still so drinkable. This beer would be an excellent introduction to Brett."
""
"Extremely complex. Huge Brett notes throughout; earth, funk and dried hay. Tropical fruits, wheat and spice. A blend between a Wit, American IPA, funky Saison and a white wine. I couldn’t really ask for anything more."
""
""
"Overall I'm glad I got to try this, and it's a different take on an IPA, but it's not something I would grab regularly."
""
"Though I'm not huge on the ""White IPA"" style this beer is definitely well done and really enjoyable. I'm hoping I have another beer stashed away somewhere as it'd be interesting to see if this one gets funkier with time."
"O - Very very tasty, im not big into Belgian wheat's but this was a fantastic combination of belgian wheat/orange, spices, and hops/bitterness. While drinking all I could think was ""well worth the $17.50""."
""
"Overall - Very nice and different. Huge flavors that you really need to have many sips to understand and enjoy. This could easly be called a saison with its barnyard funky flavors. The price was a little more then it should be but its worth a drink for its unique, and huge flavor."
""
"Overall this beer lives up to the hype. As a monster hophead myself, I like the overall balance of the beer to bring the galaxy forward, but still maintain the 'white' aspect and add a slight funkiness to the mix. I wish this was cheaper and available all the time. If it was $9 I'd buy it all the time. Definitely worth the money for a beer as unique as this one."

"Still, this is a really good brew: refreshing, solid and very, very enjoyable. Other Anchorage beers might be better, but this really nicely fits into the range. Great stuff."
""
"This was a really tasty belgian IPA with a bretty touch."
"O- A well crafted, classy beer. The fruit and yeast balance Each other out and the hops blend nicely as well. Anchorage continues to be one to watch."
"Anchorage lands in Kentucky with a remarkable beer that'll sure win over lovers of both IPAs and characterful Belgian-style wild ales. Deeply rooted in tradition and encouraged by experimentation- these guys aren't hampered by history, they seem propelled by it!"
""
"Bare hints of sweetness in between the oaky middle and dry bitter finish. Grapefruit pith, oak, champagne. Dry and clean, equal parts Brett funk and galaxy hop bitterness, with touches of coriander/pepper in the background. Nicely structured, complex layers emerge and lend unique aspects to the beer. If you ever dreamed of a hoppy version of Calabaza Blanca, this is it."
"Very nice beer. Brisk effervescence. Bright citrus from the cumquats, Spicy coriander and pepper. Spicy citrus hops with a bit of pine. Drying hop bitterness that lingers. At only 50 IBUS its got a nice bitterness. Nice lingering sweetness as well. Rich and complex beer. The spice from the coriander and peppercorn go along well with the citric bittering galaxy hops. Touches of passion fruit and citric fruit salad. Deeply complex and highly drinkable. Lots of earthy yeastiness. Musty funkiness. Very awesome beer. I love it. Lots of passion fruit as the beer warms."
"The flavor is also good. Honestly the hops don't come through much, it is more of a witbier with brett and citrus than anything but it is a refreshing take on it even with the odd experimentation. The Bitter Monk was unbelievable,the Whiteout Wit was horrendous, this is closer to Bitter Monk but not quite as awesome. The sweetness and oak come through with a few more sips. Brett is tame with a hint of funk and medicinal flavor, pretty low tartness."
"A pale golden color with a rocky white head. Really nice hoppiness on the nose. Great citrus and pine with a light floral character. The Brett gives a good funk and there’s a lot of straw and earth notes. Taste-wise, the hops are a little bit less pronounced. Very dry with lots of earthy tones and a little bit of straw and grass. Some light malt character, but it doesn’t really contribute much sweetness."
""
""
"Overall, the creativity of this recipe, in combination with the difficult but successful execution, is what really sets it apart."
"Hazy, dull gold with a dense white head that settles to a nice cap. Superb aromas of tropical hops (mango, peach, and tangerine), white wine, French oak, and spicy coriander. Bitter hop flavors of tangerine, grapefruit, and mango with a slightly funky Wit yeast, white grapes, citrus, and oak. Really good, I just wish the Galaxy hop presence was more noticeable. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, with a medium body and great carbonation. Another superb Anchorage brew, love these guys!"
"Grade: B"

"A good beer, drinks more like a nice Berliner Weiss than Belgian IPA, but seems almost like a waste to use Galaxy in such a minor starring role."

"Excellent, funky take on the style. Another great one from Gabe."

"O: This is a very enjoyable beer and the addition of the brett really adds to the enjoyment of the beer. This beer is easy to drink and I would enjoy sipping on this one for quite a while. Impressive take on the style and one to have again."
"O - An excellent beer. It is nice to see that the brett didn't overpower the base beer flavours."
"Note: Batch #1, January 2012"
"Notes: Didn't quite live up to my expectation (but they were pretty high given Brett and Galaxy hops) and I prefer the Tripel, but this was a nice beer. Interesting play with the hops and kumquat. Could use a bit more Brett on the taste but all in all I can't complain."
"O - Overall, while I liked this beer it was easily my least favourite from Anchorage. Glad I got to try it though."
""
"O: Once again, Anchorage bends the style guidelines of American craft beer and ends up winning. Galaxy is refreshing, complex, and an absolute joy to drink, much like The Tide and its Takers. I might even grab a bottle or two for aging – that brett will be something to behold in a few years’ time (even more than it is now)."

"The mouthfeel was medium to light in body with a modest amount of fine carbonation."

"The beer pours a hazy yellowish with a fluffy white head. The nose is a slightly citrusy with a mellow yeast undertone and slightly biting alcohol. The initial nose was a lot more intense and aromatic in comparison to several minutes later. The beer tastes the same way with a lot yeast upfront followed by a lingering bitterness. It's got a slightly dry and packs a medium body which is broken up by ample carbonation. Overall this beer reminds me of the bitter monk, but the yeast completely overpowers the galaxy hops."

"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber with a small white head settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing. Big fruity aroma with lots of mango, light brett, some oak, lemon, pear, and apricot. The taste has a light initial sweetness with mango, apricot, some spiciness, and a bit brett earthiness. The finish has a decent bitterness. Medium-light body. Low carbonation. Quite enjoyable."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"I love what Anchorage has been doing, though this did not hit the spot for me. It is not bad at all, I am just not a fan of the chalky flavor/consistency that I get. Worth a try if you are a fan of their other offerings however."
"M- Medium carbonation. Not enough to affect the taste of the beer or leave a sour note on the tongue."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice White IPA. The spices and the Wit yeast really compliment the Galaxy hops nicely. The Brett also adds some nice complexity."
"O - Always stellar products out of Anchorage. They love using Brett and it works for them."
"M: It's a medium bodied IPA. Very highly carbonated which helps the flavors clear the palate."
""
""
""
""
"TASTE: First reaction is a surprising division of the mouth feel. It feels like it divided in half, the top being bright and citrusy while the lower part is strangely dry and clear. Very clear, refreshing vibe overall, with a mild spicy bitterness seeming to follow. The bitter hops lingers forever almost uncomfortably bitter."
"Beer pours a hazy light yellow/straw color with a pretty fluffy white head. Smell is very nice and interesting, a mix of citrus from the hops and spice from whatever else is in here goes really nicely with the brett. Unfortunately the flavor isn't as exciting as the aromas was. The taste comes off more like a Belgian IPA with brett, which is I guess what this beer is, but the smell indicated it could be more. It's very hoppy/bitter and a little citrusy with a nice dryness from the brett and a bit of oak. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, another very tasty, interesting beer from Anchorage. It's not quite on the level of Bitter Monk, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"""Ale brewed with Galaxy hops, coriander, kumquats, and peppercorns. Fermented and aged in French oak foudres with a wit yeast. Dry hopped with Galaxy hops. Bottle conditioned with brettanomyces and wine yeast."
"Overall I just can't get over how juicy this beer is. A real nice marriage, nearly perfect for me."
""
"Really nice looking beer, slightly opaque golden color with a decent looking head. It is one finger but the bubbles are rather medium sized and tehy all line up to try and reach the top to escape into the atmosphere. My nose detects citrus, orange, lemon, grass, and then hay and a slight note of basement and funk...yes some barrel too. Everything seems good so far, then I tast the beer, bummer. Right off the bat it is good. Hoppy, citrus forward flowery punch, a hint of crisp white wine, but then...dirt, earth, just poor fermentation management on the brett scene. The minerally quality of anchorage brewing has got me down. Mouthfeel is overly spritzy to style. A let down, I'm over this brewery."
""
"Pours a clouded straw gold color, big plume of soapy white froth, diminishes slowly but leaves little lacing. Scent brings notes of citrus and tropical fruits - grapefruit and pineapple - before musty, earthy funk presents itself, segues into a dry, earthy grainyness, moderate spice. Taste lacked the hop punch or brett funk expected from descriptors on the bottle, moderately bitter with light citrus and tropical notes, mildly earthy from yeast and grain, faint spicing, a touch of sweet fruit juice on the end. Medium bodied, lightly prickly, dry. Maybe a little too much expected from this and maybe a little too much advertised on the bottle, would have liked a touch more aggressiveness on some flavor fronts, maybe the bottle just in a weird spot with aging with faded hops and muted brett."
"Medium-low body with high hybrid natural-spritzy carbonation. Exceptionally dry. Very easy to drink and leaves you wanting more."

"While this one doesn't bash you over the head with bold flavors or aromas, it has subtle complexity and great balance. Gabe gets it done again. If he keeps it up, beer geeks may someday have to re-rank the top breweries in Anchorage (and Alaska) with ABC as # 1 and Midnight Sun as #2. When I first learned Gabe had was leaving Midnight Sun to do his own thing I was a bit bummed, but I am all for it now."
"I love a good Belgian IPA - quickly becoming one of my favorite styles and this didn't disappoint."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma if full of brett, with some orange notes as well as some bread from the malt. The flavor is similar. I get a ton of brett and orange citrus notes, with a little bit of bread and biscuit malt. There is also a nice yeasty component to the flavor and a low amount of hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"T: Not as good as the smell, but still pretty tasty stuff. Opens with a touch of citrus sweetness and then moves towards a more bitter middle and finish with grapefruit pith, brett, biscuity malt and some peppery hops."

"The brett is a bit overpowering in this and it was downright bad to the harsh pepper aftertaste while cold, but the warmer it got, the more that receded and the better the beer got. Marked down a bit because of the initial taste, but by the end of the bottle was actually pretty good."
""
"O: Almost as good as Bitter Monk. This brewery can do no wrong in my book. This beer is so complex and flavorful yet so smooth and drinkable. I could drink this all day. Thank you, Anchorage!"
"D: An interesting beer and an interesting style (white IPA). Refreshing and complex. Definitely worth a try. Drinker beware: Huge hop bomb here. In hindsight, I would give this one a little more time for the hops to settle down and for the brett to do its thing."
"O) This started out slow, but I must say, this grew on me. Not something I would care to drink regularly, but worth a try. Not to shabby."
"This beer has a pale yellow, slightly cloudy color that almost makes it look like its glowing. A nice thick head gives it a stunning appearance. Very fruity aroma with citrus and herbal notes. Characterizing flavor for this beer is a real challenge because I've never had a beer that changes so much with almost every sip. This alone makes it exciting. It started out slightly funky and yeasty which gradually mellowed as honeysuckle and melon-y flavors began to peek through. I'd definitely love to try another bottle to see if there are differences between batches but unfortunately it's pretty pricey."

"Beer is light in body and very effervescent on the palate, stinging and sweet, with a late oakiness and funk with a nice hop palate. I'd have it again."

"Overall, really nice use of Brett and I could have gone for a bit more hops in the flavor, but that's a minor complaint considering how much I'm enjoying this one."
"This beer just arrived in Indianapolis today. It pours a light bodied milky and cloudy pear juice gold in color with a one finger whispy head. The nose is dry and full of brett with a moderate hop profile with a good amount of coriander and lemon peel. The flavors are a really interesting mix of fresh and pungent hops with a boatload of brett and dried citrus fruits. It's about as complex as could be. It drinks light in body and of course finishes dry and tart. It is just incredibly different. I don't know if I could drink a whole bottle BT myself and thoroughly enjoy it hut this is definitely a beer to share with a friend."

"Overall, this was delightful. I am already looking forward to having it again."
"750 mL bottle from AJ’s in Aptos. Pours a pale gold color -- not quite as light as a wit or berliner weisse, but still very pale. Aroma is zesty and bright. Big tropical papaya and grapefruit and pineapple, lemon verbena, no trace of malt. Just as it should be. Flavor is a little light on hops due to the aging, but it still has a solid tropical fruit presence. Reminds me of orange pineapple juice a bit. A bit of musty oak and brett, moderate bitterness and a lingering tickle of black pepper. A very impressive beer."
"O - Light and hoppy, and AMAZING!"

"Very nice! Galaxy hops combined with Brett is a dream come true. Super fresh and juicy flavors contrasted by the mustiness of the brett just works. Brett is way stronger in the aroma than the flavor. Highly recommended!"
"Holy hell this was a great beer, and it's going to be hard on my self discipline to wait and see how the funk levels develop in the other bottle I have in the basement."
"- This is a very good IPA. I don't like the price of it. There was a lot of hype around this beer, and along with the packaging.. it fell a bit short for me. Though I do not, and will not grade any of my scores on anything but the fluid. There is some nice Brett character, and a slight funk to it. It is probably the first IPA I would actually even consider aging. The base beer must be stellar, but beyond that.. a little over-done. I like the Whiteout Wit much better."
""
"O: My favorite Anchorage beer since Bitter Monk and maybe my favorite overall. I can't believe this beer isn't getting any hype. At some point, Anchorage will be recognized for its greatness, and people won't complain about the price, they'll offer their whole cellars to get their hands on it. What Gabe's doing is virtually unprecedented outside of Belgium. Can't wait to see what he does next. Can you say Quad?"
""
""
"O - Not exactly a textbook witbier or IPA. This is my first experience with Anchorage due to the high cost of these bottles...but this bottle was given to me, so happy to give it a try. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this one. There really is a whole lot going on in this beer and it defies classification a bit. I tend to throw this into my somewhat catch-all style of saison...but its even on the fringes of that as well. Might think about getting another bottle of this (if I find a deal) and let it age for a while to see what kind of effect the brett has on this for an extended aging."
"overall, full of unique character and very good. seems to me it could benenfit from bit of sweetness. with a little sugar to balance slightly, i think the flavors could sing."
"UPDATE: if you want to let this one sit for about 6-7 months the brett will come out to play with some nice barnyard and funk. the hops aren't quite there anymore but still provide a nice bitterness. the nose on the beer has gone nuts in that time as well with some sourness and funk."

"I think I had higher expectations for this beer than it delivered. That said, it was an interesting beer and I appreciate the experimental nature of it. Perhaps a little bit more of the citrusy Witbier qualities to help balance out the dryness of the wood aging would help."
"Overall very nice, great hops and light Brett characteristics blended well without either overpowering the other, and even a nice light malty base to back them up. A well done tasty beer."

"This beer's definitely a pleasant surprise. An IPA with the malt balance of a wheat beer and every bit as drinkable as the two styles."

"Poured at the EBF night session. The beer poured out as a pale hazy yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer gave off the aromas of bread, citrus and Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer seemed to me like a typical witbier, it was citrusy and rather mild in flavor. The peppercorn didn't stand out too much for me but there was a bitterness in there from the fruits that were brewed into it. The mouthfeel was light, carbonated and refreshing for the most part. Overall it was a pretty good brew but nothing too exciting to me."
