"Not bad. I like it. Don't love it."

"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow with a 1/2 inch head that stays for a little bit.  Moderate amount of lacing along the glass -- aroma is hoppy with citrus/grapefruit being the most overwhelming characteristic.  Very pleasant.  Slightly sour finish, but overall very solid and enjoyable."

"A orangey citrus IPA with spice aroma, which is very unusual. It doesn't work 100% but is not altogether objectionable either. So not a great IPA but not bad. Bevmo had a these for half off, at $8 for a 12-pack I filled my fridge with this very decent and drinkable (if a bit unconventional) IPA."

""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. This is a mild blonde brew with plenty of citra hops. Well balanced with a nice citrus flavor. Bonus: I picked it up from BevMo at a great price!"

"Overal this beer is OK. Not something I'd actively seek out again but not something I'd be disappointed in seeing again either."

"Saranac White IPA brewed by Matt Brewing Company with an ABV of 6.0% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The small is rich with wheat, sweetness, hops and other gains. There is nothing overpowering in smell of this brew. The taste is bitter but smooth. The bitterness is not overpowering in this brew, it is a nice touch. You pick up on some citrus brew but not much. The mouthfeel is an clean. Saranac White IPA has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again."
""
"Overall: I could see myself drinking this all Spring and Summer. Very enjoyable beer from Saranac, who kind of drifted away from me in the craft beer market over the years. This beer will make me want to come back again, as this is one of their better beers I've had in many years. Like I said, a very cloudy beer, which at first I attributed to the initial pour from the keg. The second and third pour gave me the same cloudy results. Not in a bad way, but a little unexpected since this beer is a mixture of two equally distinct styles. If you like the Belgian Witbier & IPA style, this beer is definitely worthy of a try."

" Overall, a 3.75 for Saranac White IPA from Matt Brewing Company. I think they did a pretty good job with this fusion style of brew. Its not outRAGEOUSLY awesome,but I like it all the same. I'll probably pick this up again."

"Pours a cloudy/smokey off-white copper. Smells fruity. Taste is not overpowering. Overall I am gonna have to say its nothing special. Perhaps, its needs a little more bite for my taste. Its not an unpleasant beer but its nothing so memorable that it deserves any special praise either."
""
""
""

"This is actually pretty decent for a Belgian IPA. Carries a lot of the trademark characteristics. The one detractor is the almost soil flavor to it. I can't quite say it's too earthy, because it's more like dirt really. But overall, it's consistent and pretty well done. A good one from Saranac."

"Part of an assorted sixer called an Adirondack Trail Mix. Popping the top this brew has a citrusy and piney hop smell. Pours into a handy glass to a cloudy faded yellow with an off white head that disappears quickly. On the taste this brew has a bold sourness upfront, then gets a little spiced malt sweetness followed by a bitterness of the hopping that then fades into the finish. Kind of a unique flavor. Odd indeed."

"used to like this better. still pretty clean tasting but too dry. the hops aren't there like I remember, its too perfumey. still, a clean drink and I can go through a sixer and not mind getting it again. in fact, all Saranac beers have agreed well with me, just not always blowing my mind with flavor"

"O: This would be a really great refreshing beer for a hot summer day and it is going down pretty well on this warmer fall evening here in NC... Light hybrid style of beer with attributes of Belgian IPA and witbier. I enjoyed it and would get it again."
"Overall: An decent beer, but nothing to write home about IMO."

"It's crisp, and initially it's not quite smooth. The medium body titlts to the lighter side, and it's definitely refreshing. Smoothness kicks in toward the middle and finishes it out."

"This is a cloudy, blonde-muddy brew. It has a thin, quickly disappearing head. The brew is average looking, at best. Light brown at the edges, with yellow fringes. The smell is spicy...with citrus peel. For an 'IPA'', the beer has a very subtle hop scent. The taste is equally unremarkable. Spritzy, balanced, and a bit hoppy, with a moderate bitterness. Medium in body."
"Overall, this is reasonably tasty stuff—it's certainly something I could see myself drinking regularly. I don't feel it really does all that could be done with the style, but it's interesting enough in its way. I'm pretty happy with it."
""
"Overall, a very well done white/belgian ipa from saranc, great flavors and mouthfeel with very nicely done smell."
"O - I like the idea, but I'm not sure it works. The citrus comes in too late, too light, and too flat (peel vice pulp). The spices don't seem to complement the overall flavor of the beer. Definitely not a bad beer, and refreshing for a warm day, but I won't be revisiting this one."

"O A very pleasant surprise. I've had Saranac offerings that were run of the mill, this stands out. It holds its own as is and compares well or better to others in this hybrid style."
"pops like the first miller highlife you had with your best girl in her brother's car. if only all things in life could be as perennial as fresh IPAs..."
""
"Not too bad, but nothing stunning. Drinks mostly like an IPA, with a shot of spices near the front. Not much of a malt presence."
""
"Date tasted: June 14, 2013... Glassware: Chimay chalice... Occasion: Celebrating Will's second violin recital, a successful ""Come Little Children""... Appearance: fuzzy peach body allows a splotchy off-white head-unfiltered... Aroma: crisp, peachy citrus--coriander, grapefruit prevail--a nice overall sentiment.. Palate: light and refreshing with a tingle of substance--so light for an IPA--and little aftertaste... Taste: a mixture of flowers--soft hops really allow for a smooth, pilsner-like crispness... Overall: this beer presents an odd problem--it tastes so little like any other Saranac I've had, and that is saying something. The difference is not only noticeable but welcome! A refreshing and palpable spring/summer sipper--more of what I wish the Sam Adams summer/white ale offered...."
"A revelation from this brewery- this is one of the best of the style I've ever had."

"Saranac White IPA - Creamy head. Good lacing. Deep misty yellow color. Heffenweizen like in appearance. Pine and citrus odors. Lemon and coriander. Clean nose. Crisp notes of spice and citrus. Mid-taste breaks into hard notes of pine and bitters. Fades into final roll of creamy malt undertones highlighted by lemons and oranges. Sour and spice lingers. Creamsicle after taste. Wafting more piney hops and minor alcohol tinge. Smooth mouth feel. Fairly drinkable. Flower notes may be an issue with aggressive session. Sipped slowly and respectfully, this is not an issue. Meant for a ""slow drive through the country on a hot day"" not for a drag race. Very good. If you're a hops head you'll like this fusion of Heffenweizen, Blonde Ale, and IPA. Each quality is there and well balanced. Good experiment. 3.56 out of 5."

"Thick hazy dirty gold, looks solid. White foam sits on top. Stiff pine opening nose. Murky. Citrus in nose as well. Taste is a blend of malt, citrus. yeast, and a light hop. Some bitter sticks out at the finish. Really smooth with enough kick to leave a mark. Quite good actually."

"O - What a great example of what this now popular style can be. Amazingly drinkable."

"Overall: Picked up in a sampler, but don't think I would actually buy a pack of it itself. Good to have but wouldn't say it I would keep having it. Still satisfies....Salud!"

""

""

"It looks like a Creamsicle in color. The cloudiness is thick, but it's pretty. The smell predominately reminds me of grapefruit-flavored cough drops, but not in a bad way. The orange and tangerine is quite nice. The taste is only slightly less enjoyable than the smell, but it's a good taste. The carbonation fills the mouth entirely. This is an interesting IPA, especially its appearance. I like it. I would definitely drink this again, but it'd be because it came in a sampler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looking at this, you ask yourself: ""This is an IPA?!"" Unfiltered, opaque golden (almost orange) color with bit more head than usual. The stream of carbonation adds a nice touch. Fruity, floral, citrus notes. You can definitely discern the orange peel and coriander used. In tasting, you're hit with an intense orange citrus note and the bitterness from the hops. Consistent over the palate. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a cloudy, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a steady flow of carbonation, some sediment throughout, and a sparse, filmy, white surface coating. Aromas of subtle banana and clove, with a solid resiny and green overtone. Cut grass is in the nose, too. Flavors of resiny hops and lemon on a sharp, crisp body first, with more of the clove and cardammon spicing at the end. A bit sharp from the carbonation and light body, but tasty. Lemon zest and resiny hops in the aftertaste, with a sharp, crisp, slightly drying finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium bodied with a nice balance. Low to moderate carbonation. Smooth drinking and good spice mix."
"Good beer, would drink it again."
""
""

"Tired of people saying it's bitter, it's an IPA you're supposed to taste the hops. If you can't handle this one, then I probably don't trust your opinion about beer anyway."
"I saw it at the brewery in Utica a couple of weeks ago and have been kicking myself ever since for not buying one or two. All six varieties are versions of IPA's including a dry hopped new one!"
"This has a huge sticky head that stays and leaves a clumpy covering and chunks on the sides. Super cloudy withs a dusky golden straw color. Wow is there a lot going in the nose of this one. Citrus is big but there is a ton of other aromatic excitement. Belgian spice melange of coriander, funky yeast, and bread notes. Pine hop bed show a light caramel. Taste is hoppy with grapefruit and sweet pine. Spicy notes of pepper and a lemony tartness. Feel is crisp with good active carbonation. Great overall. A hybrid of a wit and an IPA with a unique flavor."
""
""
""
"Way too bitter and unpleasant for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed this American IPA. Similar in taste/appearance to a Blue Moon but a refreshing IPA with a nice fruity/spicy taste. I would happily drink this IPA again. Good job by Matt Brewing Company."
""
"Overall I think this is past its prime but it's still drinkable. It's very much though reminding me of blue moon just with more bitterness and an obvious hop presence. It's alright, I would like to try one I know is fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured with a fluffy white head and a hazy amber body. It's not the richest hoppy Belgian ale, but it's an admirable stab at the style. I'd call it a Belgian-American pale ale. The aroma has a mix of bready, creamy malts, mixed with sharp fruity and citrus rind hops. The flavor picks up more on the hops, but they roll subtly through to the finish. The aftertaste leaves a good mix of berry fruit and grapefruit, with light spice. Nice beer."
"Wow! Hands down the best Saranac beer I have ever had. Will buy again."
""
""
""
""

"A hazy, golden body with a huge, billowy paper white cap. Good retention and moderate spider web lacing. Some stray bubbles find their way to the top. The nose is full of bright orange rind. Coriander, pine, perfume, doughy yeast, and banana seem to round things out. Solid aroma. My first venture into White IPA's and the nose on this is pretty enticing. The flavor profile follows the nose. Bright orange rind throughout with coriander, banana, doughy yeast, and some pine in the finish. There is a lingering citric bitterness that intermingles with the spice and yeast flavors. Medium body with on point carbonation. This has some real solid qualities and is a great introduction to the style. There is a nice hop imbalance with a sturdy wit underneath. This was a nice surprise."
"O- I have enjoyed every beer that I've tried of this style and this one is no exception. Bold citrus flavors and balanced evenly by the wheat and the spiciness leaves a pleasant finish. One if the next I've had from Saranac."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So happy I picked up a single of this because now I know to go back and buy a full six-pack. This is a fantastic wheat IPA. So full and rich on flavor. The only other beer that is similar to this and either rivals or bests it is Sam Adams’ Whitewater IPA. And I say that because they take the apricot flavor further which I like."
"O: Extremely satisfied with this beer. Looking forward to many more, as these are available in a limited release 12pak for only ten bucks down the street from me! Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall - I can't track down a freshness date on my bottle, but this one tastes a little stale. There is a fair amount of bitterness, but there isn't any vibrant flavours."
""
""
"overal, easy to drink and a good beer"
"O I love the White IPA, there are not many examples of this style that are less then $10 for a 4 pack. Being a Midwesterner, this is a new brewer for me. New York seems to be a Belgian style hot spot."
"Golden look, sudsy bright white head, oversized wine glass. Lots of hops on the nose, citrusy and floral, pungent, orange peel. Taste is well balanced with sweet and sour, yeastiness too. Grapefruit, orange, clementine, lemon/lime. Feel is bubbly, airy, light and wet"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good white IPA. I could see myself stocking up on this affordable brew."
"O - I really enjoyed this one...this was my first take on the style and it has been my favorite so far...I hope to see more brewers take this approach...nice job!"

"Appearance is a hazy orange tone with 1 finger of an off-white head. Its` nose contains hops, citrus, spice and caramel. The taste is pine, coriander, grapefruit, hops, some bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, the carbonation is moderate. An easy drinking white ipa, that is one of the better beers that I have tried from Saranac."
""
""
"I sensed that clarity may not be their object on this one, so I went with a highly aggressive pour resulting in a finger of French Vanilla-colored head with good retention. Color was a downright cloudy orangish-amber, like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose had a wild melange of spiciness and hoppiness going for it. The coriander was big, followed closely behind by the minty hops. The Utica boys are becoming mighty innovative in their third century of brewing. Mouthfeel was medium and exactly unlike the nose, I caught the hops initially, followed by the orange peel, then the coriander on the tongue. Very nice and quite refreshing on a hot day. Finish was bone-dry, just the way I like my IPAs. I ight have thought that there was going to be too much trying to happen here, but this was mighty tasty."
""
""
"O- Not really a bad beer, but not one I'd necesarily seek out. I do appreciate Matt trying things like this though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked the flavor but I can't get over how much sediment was in the bottles I got."
""
""
""
"This is an interesting beer, but a little disjointed. I bet it works better from the tap, than the bottle."
""
""
"O- On the whole it's one of the best beers I've had from Saranac. Could use a little more carbonation and a little more wheat on the nose."
""
"Two styles blended together and I think the Matt brewing company has done a great job. Cheers"
"This beer pours a bright, golden almost orange body with a thick white head that slowly dissipates leaving a white lace around the top of the glass. The smell is full of citrus hops and sweet malt. The taste is a good hoppy IPA, but the wheat does not provide enough of a base for the hoppiness. It is a good beer but the hoppiness is not quite balanced. As it sits for a little while the hoppiness mellows out and more of the citrus/orange flavors become prevalent making it taste more like a wheat beer. A different style that was fun to try, but will not replace any of he favorite IPAs."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice orange straw with a nice white head. Smells of very sweet grain and flowery hops, very pleasant. Tastes of a Belgian in terms of grain, with floral hops, very nice combination and balanced. This light bodied beer is nicely carbonated and goes down real easy. Overall, a very good beer."
""
"Pours into a standard pint glass. Pours a yellow brown, as foggy as it gets, with nice white lacing, a solid inch worth. Smell is orange, wheat, clove, and a hint of pine. Taste is much larger, with some assertive grapefruit to finish the flavors from the nose. Body is large for the ABV, nice carbonation, not dry, and very drinkable. It is a nice beer and unique even for this new style."
"I'm not too impressed with this one, but it isn't an entire failure. Hey, at least they tried to do something interesting and thoughtful; it just didn't turn out so great. For the most part it doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste good. I'll probably finish the bottle."
"O: light spicing but strong orange component in this very drinkable IPA."
""
""
" Back off on the orange peel, or at least add later for less astringency. Mayber needs more of a dry hop approach w/peel?"
""
"Price Point - $7.99/6pk"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium and a little sticky. Soft carbonation on this. Overall this one surprised me. I enjoy it quite a bit."
""
"If you're looking for an Ommegang or Duval like Belgian, with a little more IPA characteristics I don't think this is what you're looking for. It's too much like a regular IPA in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent example of an increasingly popular style. I am glad they made this one more IPA than witbier."
""
""
"Saranac's put out a pretty interesting beer in their White IPA. Now, that's not exactly a new idea, but they've done it pretty well. And I think to a certain extent it's because of the way they did it. A lot of the beers I've seen like this have started by bumping the white ale up into a beefier IPA style - but you get a lot of wheat malt that way (more body/more filling/more malt flavor). Saranac started the other way around, adding the coriander and orange peel to an already decent IPA. In fact, the Citra hops are so bright in the nose I'd be more than happy to drink it straight. Fortunately, they've kept the hops a bit more restrained in the flavor, and the the orange peel and coriander are noticeable as well. They appear after the hops, there's no doubt about that, but then they lend it another interesting component that helps to keep it pretty drinkable. Well worth trying!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"
"To be honest, labeling this an IPA seems to be a tad generous. But it certainly is worth checking out and I would not mind if this became a year-round beer from Saranac."
""
"Cheers!"
"The floaties are not the most appetizing part of this beer and unfortunately knock the appearance down a couple pegs. The aromas are spot on for the style with a good emphasis on the malts. The flavor is decent but lacks the strong hops flavors one would expect to find in an IPA. If anything, this beer is more like a Belgian Pale or hoppy Witbier. On the plus side, the body and carbonation are spot on, making this a great warm weather beer."
"Saranac White IPA is a very cloudy, dull golden ale with a frothy, bubbly white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a very citrusy aroma, like grapefruit and orange peel. It has a very smooth medium light body; fluffy in the mouth with a dry finish. It tastes citrusy throughout. There's lots of wheat in the middle of the taste and then resiny hop flavor takes over. Orange peel seems to be ever present and brings everything together. It finishes like an IPA but the aftertaste has a little wheat and something doughy in it. This is a very clever beer. An IPA and a Wit work together very well."
"12oz. bottle served in my Weyerbacher tulip. Pours a golden orange with a hazy clarity. Head is 2.5 inches, bright white and tight. Thin, textured rings of lacing are revealed as the head recedes. Nose expresses citrus rind, grapefruit, phenols and belgian yeast. Taste follows nose; however, flavor profile is a bit duller than suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a decent, albeit lackluster Belgian IPA. Definitely one of the better brews I've had from Saranac."
""
""
""
""

"Great variation of the style. Easily, the first Saranac beer I've been impressed by. 4.0"
"This is a nice twist on an IPA. It takes many of the traditional characteristics of a Witbier and combines them with an intense hop character. The flavors come together quite nicely to make this easy to drink, smooth, enjoyable beer."
"Hmm a white ale IPA? Interesting mix let's give it a whirl. Pours a cloudy faint yellow color, nice head to it. Medium body to it, nice mouthfeel. Bit of an interesting taste, upfront is the white ale-ish part, get some lemon notes. Finishes with a nice hop bite, and smooth and clean. Somehow blends together quite well and makes for a tasty brew. Wasn't sure what to expect but it's definitely an above average beer worth checking out."
"O - It's not a bad beer. I won't be searching this out again, however. I'd like to see a wheat IPA with some more hops. If you're looking for a witbier with touch of hops, this is a good choice."
""
"O: Is this the best value in craft beer? $7 for a six-pack says it might just be. I've avoided Saranac in the past, but if this ends up being the rule from them (instead of the exception) in the near future, I'll gladly give them the time of day."
""
""
""
""
"D: interesting brew. a malted up, hopped up belgian wit. like i said above, i wish the grain made a little bit more of a showing."
""
"Saranac. The floral notes, the complexity of the spice in the aroma and taste, the well-formed carbonation, all mean that this is truly well done."
"O- very interesting beer, probably the best I've had from Saranac overall"
"O - This is a very interesting beer. I like the combination of styles, witbier and IPA. It works well. I almost get a citrus overload from it . I recommend trying it."
"One of Saranac's better beers; enjoy!"
""
"This is the first beer I've had of this style (unless you count Little Sumpin Sumpin, which hides its wheat roots). Not sure it's quite my thing, but I'd try another."
""
"I'd like to see more of this style, but it definitely needs some work."
""
""
"Lots of hops, hearty, and not too heavy. One of the better Saranac brews that I've had. Very interesting and would totally have it again."
"Overall I was quite surprised how well balanced this beer is. Nothing mind blowing but very solid offering from Saranac. My favorite Saranac to date!"
"O: This is a unique style of beer that manages to combine the refreshing properties of a wheat beer with the strong citrusy hop aromas/flavors and bitterness of an IPA. It would be the perfect beer for IPA fans to drink on a hot summer day."
""
"O: Absolutely delicious combo for witbeer and IPA lovers. Saranac has always been ""ok"" for me, but this one really competes. You hear that, Matt? Keep it!"
"Overall: Easily the best beer I have ever had from Matt; wasn't expecting this but let's be fair - this beer is a keeper"
"O: Welp, it's probably the best or second best brew I've had from Saranac. Still not very impressed by this brewery though."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy whiteish/golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with hops and citrus. Taste is good, hops, spice, citrus, a touch of wheat, well done. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall sometimes these merging of styles fail, but Saranac got it right with this one."
"sampled on February 25, 2012 from the ""What Ales You"" mixed 12-pack. The pour is a hazy, milky lemon-pale yellow with a quick burst of fizzy head that diminishes almost as quick as it erupts. There are aromas galore in this including coriander, pineapple, other spices, and floral-rich hops.The body is thin to medium but that is appropriate to the style. The taste is as vibrant as the aroma with hops and citrus. If you are looking for malts they are de-emphasized. Still, a pleasant beer."
""
""
"O - A good, different take on an IPA."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good variation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a while if you’re in the mood for a hoppy wheat beer."
""
"Wow, this is maybe Matt Brewing's/Saranac's best. A case worthy brew that looks, tastes, feels and drinks great. Great stuff here - for anytime of year, especially summer."
"O-an interesting beer, my first tasting of this type. Is enjoyable as an alternative to usual IPAs."
"O- I didn't particularly love this, the mouthfeel was just too much to overcome for me. Too thick and the great flavor couldn't save it for me. I wish the citrus held on throughout and didn't drop out towards the end. Okay Saranac brew."
""
""
""
"O: Not a terrible representation of this relatively new style, its still a Saranac product. When Saranac tries a ""trending style," I shy away. This is likely the best they could do with a product that hasn't proved its full worth yet."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad. Very well done for a Saranac brew. Nice blend of Wit and IPA. Wish the grapefruit citrus notes held on longer. I'd buy this again."
""
""
"O: I'm really impressed with the wheat/ipa hybrid going onto here. This would be a perfect warm weather/ summertime beer (not sure it'll be around then, as this is a Limited Release). Congrats Saranac, this one rocks."
"O: A very very solid offering from Saranac, hopefully this style catches on!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I had no idea this was limited it's really so good it should be brewed year round. Solid IPA with hefeweizen flavors."
""
"This interesting IPA is a cloudy yellowish iced tea color with a modest white fringe of head and similarly weak lacing. The aroma captures swampy citrus and herbal hop qualities, with a mellow wheat grain blended in. As a hop lover this seems pretty promising. The flavor comes on with sharp citrus hop and a woodsy wheat. It’s got oak and orange, grassy bite. This is a bit too stark to me but I do enjoy the rye bread qualities that result here. Not that it’s too bitter but just a bit caustic. This is a fizzy brew with an aggressively effervescent feel with a touch of dryness in the finish and a medium-light body. It grows on me so I can certainly recommend it to hop lovers as worth a try."
"Wow. One of the better ales available from Saranac. The rave reviews are much justified."
""
"O: B"
""
"Pours a clouded golden shade of yellow, with two fingers of white head. Head lasts a fair time and a bit of scant lacing. Very citrusy aroma, and the taste follows the nose. Like a lemon/grapefruit hefeweissen, with a nice hoppy bite. A remarkable, go to again beer!"
"Definitely worth a try."
"O - Not bad, but not great. I like the spiciness, but I think the flavors are all a bit forced together. Still, I enjoy it more as I drink. I think I would like it better in the summer, when I drink many more wheat beers and many fewer stouts. I like the combo of the citra hops with the wheat flavors, but I think it could be done better."
"I haven't had the chance to taste anyone elses White IPA's, but this one just didn't sit right with me, not a big fan or either this beer or the style. I will need to come back and review this again once I have some others. Good attempt though."
"Pouring an incredibly cloudy light yellow with a dense, white head with reasonable retention and lacing. Moderate chunks of yeast are also present, making this rather ugly. The nose is that of an over-spiced, over-hopped wit. Moderately yeasty with plenty of coriander, no real orange peel, citrus hops (surprisingly light, for an IPA), very wheaty. The palate has plenty of coriander with some citrus peel, citrus hops, bread and yeast. This really is a witbier IMO. Drying on the finsih with plenty of coriander. A wheaty, moderately bready palate, highly carbonated, this beer is pretty decent."
"Definitely a good bitter kick up front with a mouthful of Citra hops...it lives up to the ""IPA"" in the title. This is the predominant taste of the beer, though some orange and lemon with just the smallest touch of coriander peeks through afterward. I do wish that the wit characteristics were more noticeable here. It's an IPA first, and definitely ""white"" second. The balance just isn't really there like some of the great ones of this style."
""
"Overall, the white IPA definitely has a place in today's beer world. Interesting flavored brew, but everything is in harmony here. This style could be all the new rage."
"Overall a tasty fresh faced ale. Clean and vibrant."
"Overall – An interesting beer, although I think too much Belgian wit and not enough IPA. A bit more spicy and piney hoppiness and a little less lemon would be more for me."

"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention, and lots of lace. Aroma is of citrus, and grassy hops. Body is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is a great combination of a wheat and a IPA. Hoppy, but not overly so. Hints of lemony spice, and piney hops. Smooth finish. Excellent."

"O: Pretty much as stated on the bottle, this brew tastes like a hybrid of a white and an IPA. Even though though the taste is a bit on the light side, it's still good for someone searching for a hoppy beer that is easy drinking and not too in-your-face."
"Overall: Glad I picked up the six pack. A step in the right direction as a style. Would like to see more breweries give this a shot."
"Pours a super hazy golden orange with a 1 finger head that films it way around the side of the glass. Orange peel strike the nose first, then a big stinky marijuana scent follows up. Some citrus tones found in the smell as well, grapefruits, lemons etc. Big weed funk, big citrus orange, and a fair amount of oat like wheat. The taste a tad bit grainy on the front, followed by all those delicious flavors from the smell. Grapefruit, pine and lemon from the big hops, banana, orange and coriander from the wheat and spice, super delicious. Medium bodied, easy on the tongue, high carbonation and very drinkable. Overall this is a homerun! This is by far the best Saranac beer i've had, so interesting and fun to drink, different styles flash before your tongue. This is a great hybrid of the two styles and a great beer in general."
"Overall I think this brewery is improving it's product slowly but surely. I've really liked the last few new offerings I've tried."
"A new concept from of all brewers...Saranac,kinda cool.Poured a hazed peach infused lemonade color with a thinner but well sustained white head atop.Alot of coriander in the nose along with toasted wheat malt,a smattering citric hops comes thru as the beer sits more.A little more hop forward on the palate with citrus and tropical fruit-like flavors,a firm toasted wheat base with a little more subdued coriander in the finish.Not bad it's something I would drink alot of in the summer."

"O/D-A nice brew at a great price. I would definitely buy this again. Won't blow your socks off, but a six-pack will go down incredibly quick. Easily my favorite Saranac beer."
"Refreshing and interesting all around. I look forward to seeing how other brewers will handle this style and I'm impressed that Matt Brewing handled this as well as they did."
"O - It's an interesting and unique tasting brew coming from a brewery that rarely wows me and I consider fairly mediocre. It's a solid attempt at something new and they succeeded. Whether or not this will catch on like the black IPA craze is yet to be seen, but definitely worth checking this one out."
"Crazy new style, Saranac seems to have jumped on this one before the scores of brewers fired up the bandwagon. Its basically a hoppy witbier or a spiced IPA ... you figure it out. LOL! Good drinking, perhaps one of the more flavorful and enjoyable beers that Matt Brewing Co. has put out in a while."
"So I'm not a huge Saranac fan. Their beers are hit or miss for me but I must say they really hit the mark on this one. I had this beer from a growler and I have to say the unfiltered hue Was impressive. Looks a lot like apple cider. It has that clean crisp wheat taste with citrus notes and a great hop finish. Saranac has finally impressed me. Cheers!"
"This was a very enjoyable beer. It reminded me of a New Belgium Ranger IPA with a bigger hop profile. It was very nice."
""
"Overall, Interesting combination, never had a white ipa before, but I like the result. Not too extreme on any flavor or style a nice balance of wheat and hops."
"Overall this was a nice spin on an IPA, but a little off base to be a true IPA and more like a Belgian style pale ale. Nice new beer by Saranac that's worth a try. Glad BA listed this under American Pale Wheat Ale, since to me that style or a Witbier is more in line with the flavor and less like the “IPA” title, so I'll rate this on the BA style and not the label title. I look forward to trying this again."
"The color is cloudy straw. The flavor is full of citrus and hops. The finish is slightly sweet and clean. I have had the draft as well as the bottle and would naturally have to give the edge to the draft but the bottle is awesome too. Don't pass this one up!"
"This is my first encounter with a ""White IPA"". I am a big Wit and IPA fan, so I was interested in this to say the least. Believe it or not, it was hard to find, and WalMart of all places had 6-packs, $7.99. Poured into a DFH pint glass, nice 3 finger head with good retention and excellent spider web-like lacing. The color resembled a textbook unfiltered wheat ale style with the golden hazy yellow hue. The aroma was just what I had anticipated, a mix of citra hops, corriander, and wheat. The taste is a direct mirror of the smell. The first few sips were almost strange with the two distinct styles clashing. As the pint became less full, the flavor was growing on me. Each one was better than the last. I enjoyed 4 bottles. The first sample pack of Sarnac was dissapointing, but each brew I have sampled since has increased my fondness for this brewery. Prost!"

"O-A solid beer. One of the better white IPAs I've had."
"O - I got this beer in a mix pack but I will go out and get it on it's own before it goes away."
"6.49 a six need I say more than that in the review, well I guess I can describe my experience. Jumping on the White IPA bandwagon even Saranac is throwing down with their own version, holy shit A-B is really missing the bus. Nevermind the next shock top beer due out is supposed to be a White IPA. This one pours like a clouded banana smoothie orange cloudy glowing slurry of yeast suspensions and spice and protein. Lacing is a brilliant egg shell white with a nice thicke tof billowing head. Aroma again very perky with the citrus hoppy green notes, this one even seems a bit like perfume. Harsh bitterness between spices and hop pellets this is over the top with the citrus bang and green hop pellet finish making you wish you could brush your teeth and clean that flavor off the palate. Crazy thing about it despite harsh qualities I still take big sips and continue to drink, almost like a zombie in cruise control eating brains. I just can't help myself, and believe it or not your palate gets adjusted with each sip, I can see the white ale spice a touch of clove coriander with big green hops bringing the citrus clove bitterness this one seems to wear it's orange peel on it sleeves (and the label). Mouthfeel despite the harsh feel and medicinal spices left on the palate there's still a good amount of hops in this NY state Matt Brewing offering, the most bearable hoppy beer I've had from them yet."

"pretty interesting. the first sip was very good, but as the glass empties, my interest wanes a bit. Still one of the better Saranc beers I've had recently. would be a decent beer to get people more used to hop flavors, as its not quite as hoppy as an IPA, has little bitterness and has some approachable flavors on the forefront."

"!2oz bottle. Pours a cloudy dark straw color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of citrus hops, grains and orange peel. Smells pretty hoppy, especially for Saranac. Taste is of citrus hops and wheat up front. Orange peel near the end. Nice hop bitterness. A bit of a floral finish to go with the orange peel. This is a solid beer from Saranac and is right up there with Wet Hop IPA as being one of their hoppiest offerings. Overall, this is an interesting style that is well crafted. I will be buying it again given the chance."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on December 7th, 2011 (julian date stamped on label). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with about an inch frothy white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is mostly hoppy, it smells mainly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, lemon and orange peel), along with some coriander and bready/wheat malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but the hoppy and malty flavors are pretty even and none of them are much stronger than the others. It's a nice mix between a witbier and an IPA. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and a bit creamy with good carbonation. At just $7.99 a 6-pack, I'd buy this again for sure. It's a great deal for the price, I can't think of many beers this good for that low of a price."

"Nice refreshing take on an IPA. Wheaty, but bitter and hoppy with a bit of citrusy fruity hops. Its a very refreshing IPA and a really good brew from Saranac. Worth a try for sure."
"Nice citrusy taste to it. Sweet, but not overbearing. Not much of an IPA at all, but there's a wonderful wheatyness to it. Very crisp. Refreshing."
"O: Wow. I've been drinking Saranac for close to 20 years now, I'd suspect, and this one might be my highest-rated beer from a brewery that generally comes across as average, nothing more (though I have a soft spot in my heart for their Pale Ale). Not sure why they chose winter to release this, though, as I think this would make an excellent summer beer."
""
""
"O: A surprisingly delicious beer that I will definitely go back to. If someone handed me this brew with an option to guess the brewery, Saranac wouldn't have entered the picture but they did a really nice job on this and the price point is great at ~$7 per 6-pack."
"overall- really cool new beer coming from fx matt, can't wait to try it on draft."
"Overall this is one of Saranac's better beers. I would definitely buy it again!"

"Awesome price and a really good beer! Saranac, you've finally made something I'll drink."
"I have never said these words about a Saranac beer- go out and get some of this you'll love it."
""

"O: IMO this is the best beer saranac has made to date, that is taking into account the fact that i have enjoyed 99% of their other beers, i really think that they just nailed it on this one, really awesome through and through"
"Overall (4.0): You know what? This is a good beer. Saranac takes a lot of shit on this site, but they brewed a nice beer here. What’s more, Citra hops supposedly have a short life in terms of bitterness but personally I think their byproduct flavors are enjoyable in their own right, so this beer will satisfy those looking for hops, but also those who aren’t—drink it fresh for hops, or a few months old for a nice wit. Very glad to have tried this!"
"O - I'm happy to say that for a wheat beer, this wasn't half bad. Saranac is a trusted hometown brewery, and this is another fine ale. I think the good people of upstate New York will enjoy it this holiday season."
"This is an exciting new brew from Saranac. A hybrid ale that blends the Belgian White and American IPA styles beautifully. I might have to try to brew a clone at home! Easily worth a try."
"a new winter seasonal from saranac. pours super cloudy barely letting any light through. heavily unfiltered, like the bottom of the blue moon keg, great white head. smells yeasty and pine hoppy. flavor is akin to our familys christmas tree with fresh aromatic pine hops, sappy and vibrant. yeast flavor isnt as pronounced as the smell or look, and adds a richness and nice bitter aftertaste. a bold new beer from saranac, will look for this in the bottle. on tap at the blue tusk syracuse, ny."
