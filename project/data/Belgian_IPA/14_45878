This beer does that, blending thick, hoppy DIPA flavors with a flowery, estery Belgian yeast character in satisfying unison.

Not that it's bad 'cause it's a reference, it's just not as awesome as it could have been with the innate originality. Regardless, this stuff pours a hazy sunshine amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises Belgian yeast, pine sap, light clove, a pinch of black pepper, melon rind, and a hint of sourdough. The taste brings in more of the same, the yeast and the now slightly-earthier pine jockeying for position, occasionally all-out clashing. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid-enough BIPA, but the yeast and the hops don't fully mesh for me. It's not bad by any stretch, but not something I'm gonna be picking up again any time soon.","TMoney2591","Sep 03, 2013"

This is a Belgian IPA with a good amount of hop flavor. Mixes both qualities of a Belgian and an IPA very well. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style.

However, the Belgian part of the beer is largely lost because of the potency of the hops, and seems imbalanced because of it. Had this simply been labeled a “Double India Pale Ale,” rather than a “Belgian Style Double India Pale Ale,” there wouldn’t have been such a problem; as it is, the fruity, spicy bananas and cloves seem almost an afterthought. This is not to say that the beer is bad—in fact, it’s very delicious, though likely far too hoppy for the novice—just that it seems mislabeled.","jondeelee","Apr 07, 2013"

There's a lot of hops. Quite juicy. Big pineapple and bright citrus with a twist of a floral, spicy noble hop aroma. That part is very nice. Belgian esters and simple malt sweetness round things out. The hops are so nice that I can almost overlook that the flavors don't quite mesh. There's also a bit of booze and a touch of acetone, but I'm still loving the hops. The taste has more grassy and spicy hop flavor and less tropical fruit and citrus. It's not quite as gentle as I was hoping. Fair bit of pepper. A touch more booze. I hate to say it, but I get the feeling that the hop loveliness is hiding a not so great Belgian-style base. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, and there's a definite booziness right at the start of the finish. I like this beer, but I think I'd love it with a cleaner yeast. If they just brewed it as a standard DIPA, I'd probably be happier. That said, the hops are so bright and flavorful that it's easy to see past the flaws.","popery","Mar 11, 2013"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"A clear copper-amber color with a fair off-white head and tenacious lacing. The aroma offers sweet pine-citrus hops with a touch of piss and vinegar. The lemon edges blend with some skunky caramel. Very nice although I don't detect much of the usual Belgian ideas. The flavor brings a nice blend of caramel-pine and lemon along with a modest clove yeast that just hints at the Belgian theme. This stuff is pretty yeasty with a slightly funky hop. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The feel is gentle but with a pleasant frothy quality. Although it did not provide the classic Belgian IPA flavors it is none-the-less a very enjoyable concoction. Very much recommended.","Durge","Nov 19, 2012"

The off white head approaches, but maybe doesn't reach two fingers in height. Head retention is just OK, but there's a decent amount of lacing coated onto the side of the glass. The nose is a little on the weak side, but there are definitely clove and tropical fruit notes there to appreciate. The flavor profile steps things up big time though. The front end has some candied sugar sweetness, before an aggressive charge of bitterness come through. The back half is where things get interesting though, as phenols, esters, and hops come together to bring wave after wave of flavor coming through. Notes of bubble gum, tropical fruit, light citrus, clove, and a bit of earthy herbs all come through in time. No one sip is exactly like the last, but they're all delicious. The body is nicely dialed in, not desert dry, but tending towards the dry side of the spectrum. The carbonation however, is just a little bit dull. I'm thrilled that CBC is bottling some of their beers now, and only wish I lived in MA so I could have a glass of Audacity of Hops (or any of their other beers) at home more often.","axeman9182","Feb 06, 2012"

Huge amounts of pine and citrus waft into the air long before I get my nostrils over the top of the glass. Slightly spicy with a hint of green onions and just a touch of yeasty esters. Taste is resinous, pine, citrus, spicy, woody hops with barely enough bready malt to call this anything other than fresh squeezed hop juice. Belgian yeast adds a hint of phenols and a touch of pepper to round out the flavor. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly, prickly, resinous mouthfeel. Finally a Belgian IPA where the yeast funk doesn't hide the hop funk on my palette. Very nicely done.","johnnnniee","Dec 23, 2011"

3.4,-16,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I'll admit I let this bottle sit a little longer than I should have. It still retains it's Belgian characteristics and yeast profile. Being a one off I would have liked to have it on draft as well. Nice head retention/Belgian lacing. Cloudy body with a spiciness that lingers. Not that hoppy, hints of earthiness(?) (not that it needs to be for this style), but once again it may have been hoppier while fresh. Not much rye character but a little dry in the finish. If you still have a bottle than I suggest you drink it ASAP. IPA's do not age well. I look forward to the CBC this April in Chicago and what it has to offer!","SiphonKing","Nov 13, 2009"

3.87,-4.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Tried this on tap at The Armsby Abbey at the meet the brewer night. Poured a nice golden color with a largish head which dissipated and left a nice lacing on the glass. Lots of good hoppy aromas, very strong. At first all I could taste was the hops and was really questioning the Belgian IPA classification. As I continued more Belgian yeast characteristics emerged. The drinkability is okay, at 8.5% I really only wanted one. I would love to see this brewed again and bottled.","mat","Jul 11, 2009"
3.61,-10.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Certainly a beer for the hopheads out there. It's about as caustic and bitter as I can stand without having to tap out on the mat. Though, having said that, I was happy and relieved this was available in a sensible twelve ounce format, as finishing anything bigger might prove to be a daunting task. Even with the lone twelve ounces, it might be best to share this with a friend. Or as dear Samwise Gamgee might say, ""Share the load.""","ChainGangGuy","Jun 26, 2009"
3.53,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Aroma of citrus hops and caramel malt. Flavor of sweet melon, citrus, with a bitter hops finish. Hmm, I thought this was just a regular IPA when I had it, although now I can see how there were some Belgiany notes in there too. Pretty decent.","LilBeerDoctor","Jun 05, 2009"
3.95,-2.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"bold american hopping is nice, although seems to blunt out the belgian yeast character more than should be for it to still be classified as a ""belgian ipa"".","tai4ji2x","Jun 01, 2009"

4.39,8.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - A nicely balanced, fruity and drinkable IPA. The belgian character is not overly strong, as any spice and fruit notes from the yeast blend with similar characteristics form the hops. The hop character is excellent, with a strong aroma and flavor as well as smooth, balanced bitterness. Overall a very nice beer, too bad I can't get any more.","nickfl","Beers"

4.24,4.7,4,5,4,4,4,"Glad to have the opportunity to try this collaborative brew. Hazed yellow in a nice shapely glass, big foamy and very thick and dense head. Rings all the way down the glass with each sip. Smell is just out of control hops. Really smells like when you go to the homebrew store and stick your nose in a pouch of hops. Taste is much the same, totally hoppy, but somehow balanced by a nice caramel malt and a nice fruity Belgian yeast presence. It is almost too hoppy. I can't believe I'm saying that as a lover of all big flavors but it almost tastes more like a hop pellet than the desirable flavors imparted by hops. Still, it's unique and I dig it. Smooth on the palate and really very drinkable. Wish this would be around for longer. A great beer for a great occasion.","twelvsies","Apr 27, 2009"
4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this one on tap at Union Brewhouse- quite a treat. Served in a thin tulip glass. Pale yellow color but almost had a neon hue to it, with a huge white head. The barkeeps were having trouble keeping the head in check when pouring it. Smells were dominated by the hops. Some light citrus and minty hop aromas. Taste was the same, at first. Then the belgian yeasty flavors come through. Some light spiciness and pepper come through. Very interesting. Drying mouthfeel but the hops come through again at the end for a bit of bitterness. Good beer, very original.","DrDogbeer","Jan 06, 2009"
3.58,-11.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"On tap at Deep Ellum, Allston this past weekend. Served in a Unibroue glass. Huge white head. Maize color body. Not quite opaque, but not quite clear body. Can smell the hops right up front. Interesting flavor. Hops dominate the mouth, but there is that subtle bit of Belgian sweetness that appears in there to tone down the hops just a tad so I can enjoy it. Very smooth finish. Served in small portions, I could drink a couple of these. But for a hop head, it could be an all night affair. I would consider this more of a Belgian IPA than the way it was described on the menu (to paraphrase) as a Belgian style hoppy tripel. Another high quality creation from CBC though.","morebeergood","Nov 29, 2008"

4.74,17,4,5,5,4,4.5,"What a tasty and interesting concoction. Like nothing I've had to date. This beer flips the Belgian IPA mutant-style onto its ass and brings us an ultra-hoppy IPA with the Belgian characteristics taking the back seat. The fruity Belgian yeast is there in the finish but a big simcoe-heavy, West Coast hop aroma and flavors dominate, staying on the palate until your next sip. Lots of pine in the taste as well. The 8.5% keeps me from drinking this all night. A must try for hopheads.","yossarian14","Nov 12, 2008"
4.44,9.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I could drink this beer all night. The only complaint is that the Belgian characters are just whitewashed by the huge, and I mean huge amount of hops!","SFLpunk","Beers"
