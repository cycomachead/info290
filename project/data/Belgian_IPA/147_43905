3.98,-0.3,4.5,4,3.75,4.5,4,"With the only difference being the yeast supposedly, there are some major differences. Unlike the Stone IPA (IPA) being a hazy gold color, the Cali-Belgique (CB) is crystal clear. The smell is also drastically different, the aroma is overwhelmed by spicy, belgian yeast aromas with only hints of the pine and citrus. The taste reflects this exactly, tastes like the IPA but overwhelmed by the flavors created by the Belgian Yeast. Overall an ok beer, but I definitely prefer the regular stone IPA. I feel the belgian yeast hinders the IPA flavor instead of improving it.","Joe_Howard","Monday at 07:46 PM"

Smells fruity and hoppy, the yeast adds a pleasant note. Taste is impressive, a very flavorful mix of sweet fruit, citrus, and rather bold hoppyness. It is also slightly grassy, and the sweet aspect falls off in the finish to leave a satisfying bite. Medium body, active carbonation. A very pleasant, enjoyable spin on an IPA. I'll probably pick up another bottle in the near future.","ZebraCakez","Jan 04, 2015"

Waiting time on the head is long, but a good thing. I love observing the beer as long as i can. Carbonation is healthy. Nice sweet taste on a flat tongue. Brings out a lot of flavor. Pleasant sweet malts with a tinge of bitterness. The hops bring up the back and remain with the nose. Love how clean tasting this is. Really easy to drink. Great after a hard day work. Aromas from the beer keep you focused and interested. Watching the beer descend in the glass is a show. Presentation is outstanding. I will continue to enjoy this for the winter. Definitely recommend this. Cheers!","silverevo9","Nov 30, 2014"

Leaves nice concentric rings of lace around the glass. Aroma of fresh grapefruit, burlap sack, cloves, a little orange as well, light caramel. Ample rustic Belgian yeast and sturdy citrus and pepper hops. Palate is quite wonderful, one of the better compromises between yeast and hops I've observed in this rather murkily defined style. Impressive resinous green bitterness coupled with grapefruit, lower key orange and pineapple, green banana, medicinal phenols to a surprising degree. Moderate body with some heft and similarly robust carbonation. Finishes intensely bitter and dry, decent pucker power that recalls more citrus rind (lemon with no juice to sweeten things), floral tobacco, herbal tincture and flinty minerals. I am enjoying this brew's bucolic intensity and unapologetic spicy edge. Smooth mouth feel despite these traits. Stone may be old news down south but this ought to make waves up here.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 21, 2014"

Unique tastes in this beer and certainly not what I was expecting by reading the label and skipping through the (now) typical idiotic drivel that Stone feels compelled to waste valuable paint printing on each bomber-size bottle of their beers. Seriously, who writes this garbage? Regardless, this beer is not focused on what I would associate with Belgian beers, but instead is focused on a more funky yeast strain that -nonethless-- works with Stone's excellent IPA recipe. Definitely worth a try for fans of Flanders-style beers, lambics, geuze and bretts. Recommended.","BeerDocT","Apr 25, 2014"

One can definitely taste a Duvel type yeast. (dry finish and pear like flavor) I really like the Chinook, it gives a really dry type of flavor (similar to the the APA by schlafly, almost like sucking mint leaves: almost hairy in some ways). The dryness of the hop flavor and of the body (the beer is well attenuated) really complements the Duvel yeast well. A different beer but that worked well for me.","lulubrewer","Apr 18, 2014"

This ale pours a gorgeous golden color with a thick long lasting white head. Very European in appearance. The aroma is quite sweet with tons of Belgium yeast and malty notes. Though there is definitely and underlying aroma of west coast hops. This one has a lighter body than I expected. The flavor of this ale is more European influenced than I expected with a lot of sweet yeast flavors and Malt. Yet there is a definite American ipa influence. A very decent amount of hops that would not be found in a typical belgium ale. This is not my favorite Stone offering or my favorite belgium ipa but it is a very good well crafted ale blending two of the best styles if beer ever created.","lochef81","Jan 28, 2014"

Warm and bready like a Belgian but with a much more pronounced hops character, and I think I taste more grapes in the back. I've been thinking about Stone's Enjoy By series a lot recently and in my eyes this could have never lived up to that, but it's solid.","James773","Jan 21, 2014"

Aroma is unmistakeable Belgian yeast, dry, with a hint of fruity hops, mango, pear, apple. Flavor is dry yeast and light apple and pear flavors. Tiny bit of grass from the hops. This seems really more like a dry Tripel with nearly no influence from the IPA portion. High carbonation and light mouthfeel. Overall not bad but was hoping for more IPA influence.","BMMillsy","Oct 10, 2013"

The taste was very dynamic. You could taste the Stone IPA base with its hoppy profile and bitterness. The Belgian Yeast gave it a subtle tang that boosted the flavor without being overwhelming. The Cali-Belgique was a nice twist on the Stone IPA and one of the best Belgian Style IPAs I have tried as the yeast was a nice compliment to the beer rather than overpowering it. This was another well crafted brew from the brewers at Stone.","brurevu","Sep 18, 2013"

APPEARANCE: beastly swirling tornado of effervescence ripples up to a snow-white two-finger head that frames a burnt-orange body--a beautiful glass to behold... AROMA: sugary, candied fragrance sits atop the classic Stone hops head bang--worth the price of admission just to soak in its aura... PALATE: soft, mildly hopped yet beguilingly medium-bodied; warming in the throat but not intrusive; a paradox that seems to bare out the uniqueness of the beer's namesake...TASTE: provocatively complex tart--grapefruit and pepper indelibly cascade with each swallow; balanced and substantial,, but in a way that invites a second bottle... OVERALL: Playing off the film, I will say this beer does not possess a stutter-inducing ABV, but the flavor, frame and aroma, this beer has a lot going for it...the over-babble on the bottle label could be severely edited, but no mistaking the beer is one I will recommend to friends, give as a gift and seek out when disposable income is more readily available...","dacrza1","Jul 28, 2013"

It's somewhat warming after each swallow. Although this is a little unusual for a Belgian IPA, it's complex, which I love and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it and purchase it again.","Neorebel","Jul 04, 2013"

While it isn't quite as good as the original, it is a nice departure from the norm and a worthy entry in Stone's lineup of year-round beers. Try it out if you're like me and a little bored with the garden variety IPA. I think you'll enjoy it.","hagbergl","Dec 18, 2012"

Smells of a strong piney hop and similar to the regular Stone IPA. Flavor is also nicely bitter and sweet with the hops - I want to say the Belgian yeast makes this slightly less hoppy in taste and more balanced than the regular version.

3.91,-2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A decent interpretation of the style; the Belgian yeast character certainly shines through. Not overly IPA-like; the hops don't come across all that well (and certainly not by Stone standards). Impressively yeasty aroma and flavour, with a nice bitter finish to round it off. I reckon this could have done with a greater addition of hops but it remains a well-crafted effort. Although I'm not a fan of Belgian IPAs I find this pretty good, and better than some others that I've tried as it achieves a degree of balance between the yeast and hop notes. In general the style has a muddled character that leaves you unsatisfied. Worth trying, even if I probably won't pick one up again.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 11, 2012"

4.1,2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 7/18/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a good 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, clove, pepper, banana, orange, grapefruit, herbal, grass, honey, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon, orange rind, pepper, clove, banana, grapefruit, honey, bread, herbal, floral, pine, earth, and yeast spices. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, banana, clove, pepper, herbal, pine, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and lightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA. Great balance of hop and yeast character; and extremely smooth to drink. Very well done.","superspak","Aug 09, 2012"
4.2,5.3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours out a dark golden yellow hue with a thick offwhite head that leaves s. ome good lacing and retention. The beer has a very pleasant yeast, bread, fruity, and peppery aroma. The taste starts out with some yeast followed by some pine and citrus hops and finishes off with some fruity sweet malts. The flavors are very well balance in a creamy but slightly dry mouth feel that makes this an IPA to enjoy when wanting something that is different than other IPAs, but still from a reliable brewery.","DannyDan","Aug 09, 2012"

The taste is an exquisite blend of citrus - tart grapefruit and apple, lemon and orange. There is also a slight clove and banana flavor that is a bit reminiscent of a hefeweizen - this is what makes it different from the standard Stone IPA.

Thats really it; its got Belgian in its feel, with a nice crisp finish that hints of spices with the citrusy hop bite of Stone's IPA. And if that sounds appealing to you, go for it. But to me, its pretty much on par with their regular IPA. I will say it does hit the spot better for the summer weather, hence a slight edge in its favor comparably.","DM1293","Jul 02, 2012"

Leaves a mild lacing on the glass. The nose is very sweet with lots of fruity esters and the ever-present hops of all Stone beers. Good balance on the nose that continues into the taste. There is the usual citrus hop profile of grapefruit and lemons, but it blooms into a white bread and estery sweet fruit of the Belgian yeast. Very interesting taste. The mouthfeel is light on carbonation, very full with a long bitter finish that reminds you that you are drinking a Stone. Overall, this is a quite tasty beer.

The malt and hop profile is their IPA to a T, but that Belgian yeast kick adds a whole 'nother layer of complexity. It's a delicious beer, but I think it's more interesting in the context of experimentation, in just how big an influence a yeast strain can have on the final outcome of of a beer. Most people tend to think of the yeast as an afterthought... I know I have. It's been "hops this and malts that".

It certainly defies any attempt to pigeon hole it. For my taste, I would prefer it to be either an IPA or a Belgian Ale. There is a bit of a clash between the IPA level hops and the Belgian yeast.","mschind","Apr 04, 2012"

It was mildly spicy and funky, but I didn't get anything in the middle of the spectrum. This combined with the typical Stone "in your face" hop profile made it a beer of extremes. The malt was not the central point, although it complimented the beer when necessary. I like the aspects it showcased, but felt it was a bit thin in the flavor profile, leaning too much on the extremes of taste and smell.","Philousa","Feb 01, 2012"

The nose is a mix of orange fruitiness together with a granny smith sweetness, together with the bubble gum yeast character. A faint hint of peppery spices. Nice aroma. The flavor follows suit: Citrus upfront, orange, grapefruit together with some apple and pear flavors. The spiciness found in the nose follows, though mellow. Medium bitterness. Very smooth. Finishes with a lingering bubble gum fruitiness. Nice. Lighter bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Dry. Overall, one of the better Belgian IPA's I've had.

Strong hops, spices and citrus, mostly grapefruit, come through in the aroma. It’s got a medium mouth feel and is really crisp on the tongue. Over all flavor is just a bit bitter, spices are well detectable. The aftertaste gets a little more bitter but is just as complicated as the taste itself.","vickersspitfire","Nov 20, 2011"

3.95,-1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Great effort at a crossover style brew. I let the bottle warm some out of the fridge. Then I poured a large, billowy, frothy, fluffy, off-white head with some lace. Color is a clear amber with no bubble trails. Aroma is a tad mild and with crackers, bread dough, yeast, malt, hint of hop. Flavor is like nose but the hops leap to the fore, followed by sweet/tang, yeast bitter, and other stuff. Body is good, but carbonation seems a shade flat. Finish is like flavor, still maintains complete hop profile, adds a touch of banana and is overall, nice. But not too nice. Maybe more like - engaging.","drpimento","Nov 12, 2011"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall this is an easy drinking, high quality and very enjoyable Belgian IPA. The smell is very straight-forward in that you get exactly from the taste what the aroma advertises. Recommended for IPA or Belgian beer fans.","bpk59","Nov 12, 2011"
3.43,-14,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"O: This is definitely an interesting style. This brew definitely succeeds at what it aimed to do.

Balancing a beer is nice, but I simply enjoy stronger flavors to emerge.","TheAlamoWrocker","Nov 11, 2011"

3.3,-17.3,4,4,3,3,3,"I think there's two ways something like this has to be judged: accuracy of style, and simple beer-as-beer. Stone's stated intention (it's right on the bottle) is California-meets-Belgium, and on that I think they could've used a touch more west coast g-funk. On beer-as-beer merits, it still works though. I averaged the two.","longbongsilver","Nov 08, 2011"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! This stop pours a clear amber-tinted gold topped by a finger of light cream-white micro-foam. The nose comprises dank pine needles, wet grass, lime, light lemon zest, light-ish toffee, and pineapple. The taste holds notes of nutmeg, clove, black pepper, rich toffee, light pretzel, banana, pineapple, light pine resin in the back, and some very light balsa even further in the back. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, a very nice BIPA, one that goes down way the hell too easily...","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2011"
4.09,2.5,3,4,4,4.5,4.5,"palate: the hops dominate the taste at first, but there is a hint of the yeasty/fruity flavor of belgian styles. i would say that the taste comes out as bitter with citrus aftertaste. it really feels like i just bit the tip off of a douglas fir","kcinlober","Nov 07, 2011"

3.82,-4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured in a Dogfish Head tulip glass, pours a golden straw color, the smell lets you know that this is very much so a Stone IPA with a citrus, and a floral aroma. Taste is hop forward very similar to a fresh Stone IPA but with a fruity character from the yeast. Very drinkable, the best of both worlds- California hops and Belgian yeast.","isaiahcutright","Oct 17, 2011"

3.97,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Much more Belgian (or at least anti-Stone) than even the spunky label could lead one to believe. Cali-Belgique goes a long way to illustrate the effect of yeast on any beer's impression, i.e. there's a Stone IPA under there, but it is ensconced in DNA-rewriting, Euro-lowlands mind shiftiness. Bottom line: still tasty, but the hoppier, bitter beast that you have hitherto known has been co-opted by a surprisingly agreeable, um, (I know) Belgian character. Bigend of Blue Ant, represent!","biboergosum","Oct 13, 2011"
4.12,3.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: This is certainly a unique brew that helped open my eyes to what a different yeast strain could do to change the flavor of a beer. I'm not acclimated to Belgian styles, and this was educational to say the least. I enjoyed to experience but I'm not sure I'm ready for funky beers, at least not any funkier than this one.","setexascustoms","Oct 10, 2011"
4.45,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The Cali-Belgique definitely lives up to its name...features of a west coast IPA and a Belgian beer are both present and blend together nicely. If you like both styles, give this one a try. Another great and distinctive offering from Stone!","WMEugene","Oct 10, 2011"
4.03,1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Stone has done a great job again. I like many other people may be partial on the judging but I love Stone brewing. They are one of the only outside outstanding brews that we can get in the state of MT so I but it up when I can.","bravejoejoe","Oct 02, 2011"
4.53,13.5,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Ok. Here's the deal: if you are a Belgian fan, and you also like a good IPA, you have got to give this a try. There are a few hopped Belgians out there now, and this is a good one. Pours well, lacy head, kind of a goldenrod color. It starts like a funky Belgian on the tongue, then the IPA character comes through, and the finish is smooth. Overall, a nice balanced beer. One of my favorites because it is very drinkable, and unique.","Thee","Oct 01, 2011"
4.02,0.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall if I ever get a chance to try this with no yeast on the bottom (or with a best by date) I will re-review it. It still was a very solid offering and surprisingly hoppy and balanced.","DrDemento456","Oct 01, 2011"
4.42,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: This IPA took me by surprise. The fruit notes in the smell and the taste are awesome. This a great all around IPA. Cheers!","Heatwave33","Oct 01, 2011"
3.71,-7,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours a translucent peach blonde with creamy white fluffy head that sticks all over the glass. The aroma is dominant Belgian esters, some sweeter fruity notes, slightly phenolic (getting a little band aid scent here). The hops don't really shine through like they would in the regular IPA (I believe this is the same beer but fermented with a Belgian strain), very masked and hidden in the aroma. Slugging this thing down, the taste at first comes as Belgian candi sugar, very nice but not too overpowering. The sweetness doesn't linger for too long, and a light bitterness follows through to the finish. Body's on the light to medium side, with a smooth, dry finish. Not sure how much of a fan I am of the style -I'm either in a Belgian mood or a hoppy mood, so this one doesn't really satisfy either BUT an excellent beer nonetheless.","californiakebab","Sep 30, 2011"
4.42,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall a much better experience than the exploding Chouffee IPA, and I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to try a Belgian style IPA.","TheSarge","Sep 28, 2011"
3.5,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, it's not bad, but rather one dimensional. Not an IPA I'd look to get again.","tdm168","Sep 24, 2011"
4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This brew poured out as a nice lightly hazy yellowish gold color. The head doesn't stick around too long really and the lacing is very minimal. The smell of the beer had lots of Belgian yeast aromas coming off of it and plenty of hops on the nose. The taste of this brew is really nice and soft feeling with some bubbles in there to give it a slight edge. The hops go really well in this brew also. The mouthfeel is pretty light but still had enough going for it to keep it alive. Overall this brew is really nicely done. Big fan of this one.","Knapp85","Sep 17, 2011"
3.85,-3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste was good. I certainly can taste the Belgian influence int his beer that helps balance out the bitterness that we all like to see in an IPA. I certainly can taste the alcohol kicking through, and for some it might be a good thing. For me, though, I think it would be better if it was masked better.","2xHops","Sep 17, 2011"
4.6,15.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall, This beer might be my favorite offering from Stone. While it falls more on the American IPA side than an actual Belgian IPA like La Chouffe Houblon, it's just an amazing interpretation of the style. As it warms the Belgian side opens up a little more. My new favorite from stone. World class.","dsprainman","Sep 15, 2011"
4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had the chance to try this again on tap at the Alamo Draft House. Belgian aspects were way more prevalent than in the bottle, and it was beautifully balanced between spicy tripel and hoppy IPA. This was damn enjoyable to drink.

4.22,5.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a yellow/burnt orange with a big amount of fluffy white head which dissipated quickly down to nothing but a ring. The aroma is a combination of orange and lemon/lime citrus with a spicy/fruity, slightly sour, Belgian yeast. Any malt character is subdued by the big yeast aroma. Flavor is fruity orange and mango but countered with a peppery spice of yeast. Malts are present more now than in the nose giving the hops a caramel/toffee backing. The spicy, clove, character dies down for the finish leaving only fruity hops and a bitter bite. Yeast subdues a massive hop character which goes well over a light and creamy body.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 09, 2011"

The head has nice retention and leaves some pretty good lacing down the glass. The aroma right away reminds me of a nice Belgian style beer. Spicy, fruity, lots of yeast aroma. And of course their are hops there as well. Mainly citrus hops. The taste like the smell reminds me of a Belgian beer right away but unlike the smell the hops stand out more in the taste. Citrus, spices, nice hop bite at the end. Pretty balanced not over hopped but enough to give it a nice bitterness. The aftertaste leaves a nice spicy and yeasty taste in the mouth with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is good pretty medium bodied. Overall this is good.

A well balanced malt strikes first with classic Belgian ale notes of coriander and banana but there is an extra crisp element to it. It doesn't come across like a classic IPA would but I can definitely detect an element of hoppiness to go along with it. Medium bodied. Coats the entire palate but not in a heavy manner. Carbonation seems a bit low. The palate is very interesting. It comes across as more half Belgian golden ale and half IPA than does the nose. The hops stay with you the entire way but don't dominate at all. They give only a very mild resiny quality but manage to be bright and crisp without being overwhelmingly bitter. You still get enough coriander and malty sweetness to remind you of the Belgian influence. The finish is fairly clean and smooth. Very drinkable. This is a neat beer.

Hop profile is distinct on the front and back end while maintaining a palpable mouthfeel and overall flavor profile. Hides the alcohol extremely well; one of the more drinkable IPAs in my opinion. It seems that this beer led Stone in the direction of brewing techniques outside the US (Saison du Buff and their 14th Anniversary) not to mention their prospective brewing collaboration with a Belgian brewery. While the beers that followed were met with much more mixed reviews (I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed the 14th Anniversary), it is safe to say that this brew is approachable for all types of BAs.","ebin6","Dec 04, 2010"

The taste of this is really nice. The mouthfeel is good. It has a medium body with very good carbonation. It goes down really easy, and it also feels a bit creamy. Drinkablility is good as well.

The hops smell stood out more when I smelled it in the bottle. Once in the glass, the hops took a backseat to funky banana, caramel, bubblegum, and clove. The hops come across as a fruity mango/pineapple like aroma. There's a hint of funky earthiness in the taste that reminds me of a saison. Pepper notes make there presence known as well. Goes down pretty easy, but there is a grassy bitterness in the finish that hangs on a little too long.

At first smell I pick up a ton of hops but after while they become overpowered by the belgian yeast. Once I pull away and go back to it I get a blend of both. It's citrusy and piney, almost like someone poured a tripel into an IPA. The taste is vastly different from the smell. It's unlike anything I've had. At first I'm a little confused then strong grapefruit breaks through and an almost grassy undertone. Mouthfeel is much thinner than I would have expected or wanted. It's also a little flatter than I would have liked as well. Drinkability is decent. This is a different beer and I'm glad I tried it.

The hop flavors are allowed to shine, while the bitterness is kept well under control. Props to Stone for creating another tasty offering.","Sweasty","Jul 16, 2010"

A traditional looking IPA except that it is a little light in color. Clear. Tall rocky head that left sculpted concentric rings. Amazingly the yeast aroma really battle with the hops in the nose. On first sniff I was confused. My curiosity aroused. Very spicy as well dominated by cloves. I have never had a beer with such overt clove aroma. Is it the Belgian yeast that does this? The taste was all Stone IPA but more. The brew tasted like a blend of caramel malts, citrusy hops and a fruity taste. The fruit was pineapple-mango-peach-tangerine. Very intriguing. Then the hops wrestled the aftertaste away again. A fresh grassy sort of hops. Very fresh like a wet-hopped beer. The body was medium light with average carbonation. Call the texture soft to oily. Overall a great and refreshingly different beer. It's not your traditional IPA. I give Stone top marks for attempting this unique hybrid and pulling it off.","chickenflea","Jun 19, 2010"

Belgian IPA's are one of the newest, yet best styles of beer around today. Cali Belgique does not only set the standard for this style it almost makes it impossible to replicate. From a bottle it pours a nice and golden with a two inch white head. This beer not only satisfies the quench of belgian beer fans but hop heads as well. The aroma is complete with a belgian/pine combination. I started out as a novice beer drinker, soley focused on Belgian styles but once my pallet for IPA's devopled this beer was able to my beer needs from all angles.

Exactly what I expected, with the best characteristics of a Belgian, expertly infused with that classic Stone IPA flavor. Highly drinkable with a nice, crisp, clean, dry finish.

Once the foam subsided, giving the beer a taste, you definitely catch the hops, immediately, I would expect nothing less from Stone. Strong taste, good amount of bitterness following up the fruity/hoppy mixture. Good amount of fruit/lemon flavor, and you get that light almost vanilla flavor present in a farmhouse ale. All in all a good combination, I think it was balanced well so all flavors come through equally.

Cali-Belgique is the beer that originally got me excited about the style, and finally returning to it again (and fresh!), I can see why.

Big hop notes lead to floral aromas with a slight hint of citrus.

Definite crisp piney flavors to go along with the unique Belgian spiciness in the taste as well. Crisp, light bodied feel with a dry aftertaste that lingers.

A definite bready and yeasty taste along with a pleastant bitter hopiness. A little more of a bitter hop kick than a citric hop kick. Some sweetness, some malt, and some grain as well.

The hops still punch the nose, but there is an underlying sweetness in that Belgian yeast. Different from that sweetness that you get on the other side of those hops. This is a more round and broad sweetness that come only from Belgium (or areas very close to...) There is bubblegum hidden in the glass too. I love how much the yeast changes everything. The smell, the structure, the flavor, the mouthfeel, and the overall drinking experience. It's like your tongue wants to taste Stone IPA, but the yeast makes you forget what it tasted like. The American Ale yeast normally used in this beer works differently with the hops. It normally acts as strong object for the hops to lean on and use to exert themselves. But the Belgian yeast almost embraces the hops and wraps them up in a buffer. You can still taste the specifically bitter aspect that these hops are traditionally meant to have, but there is so much else going on before you get there, that is doesn't have the same effect.

Very well blended overall but losing half a point for perhaps pushing the spice out front a little too much in my opinion. The variety of flavors really reaches every corner of the palate and creates a sensory whirlwind. Great carbonation that's lively and not overpowering. Very drinkable all in all but I would have liked the spices to be a bit more subdued. Nonetheless, this is an excellent beer.","apbarwood","Sep 18, 2009"

The flavors were equally well balanced and pleasantly complex displaying an excellent balance of yeast and hops. Spicy, fruity and herbal all at once. The bready malt seemed slightly shy (especially for this brewer) but otherwise it was very well thought out. The finish was just a little bitter, but not unpleasantly so.

Poured into a tulip glass a crisp pale orange with a decent off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice blend of spice and citrus hops. The taste is a wonderful blend of spices, citrus hops and sweet malts that leaves a nice blend of spice and hops on the tongue.

Tastes of citrus, pine/wood, more hops, some sweetness, belgian yeast and a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is kind of fizzy for me but is light-medium with a good malt aftertaste coating on the tongue.

Sporadic chunky lacing simply clings to the sides of my Gordon Biersch Imperial pint glass. I know not exactly the choice for many Belgian style ales, however this one retains enough American hops to fit smoothly into this style of glass. Big grapefruit and citrus tones simply crash down on my senses, excellent American hop profile...in fact it's one I don't think that I've enjoyed since early on in Stone's uprising. A bit of Candied sugar and sweet biscuit or cracker sweetened malts lay open to a load of citrus hops, and since that's the case that is all I can recall from recent Stone Cali-Belgique examples. Sweet sugary hops and malts with spicy Beglian malts not as much of a train wreck as some of the Belgian style ales, I just hope that Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale makes it out to southeastern Ohio more often. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with soft effervescent carbonation from your atypical Stone creation, I thought I was going to hate the American hops with Belgian yeast but this version worked for me and I hope to see more of it in greater Pittsburgh area.

Same in the flavour, coming together in a sweettart-like fruitiness, but with a solid bitterness. Mild sweetness was mostly fruity, with a hint of strawberry, rather than malty. Closer to light than medium bodied and fairly dry, moderate carbonation, a bit on the rough side. I liked it.

Great smell, a combination of the malty sweetness of a tripel overlayed with a good hop freshness. The taste mimicked this scent but with a little stronger hops flavor bordering on citrus.

The bready yeastiness hits the palate at the front, blending to a mild grapefruit bitterness, with a touch of grassiness at the end. a light feel at the front, it crisply dances across the palate, leaving a mild dryness on the back of the palate.

A floral hop smell is what I notice first (so typical of Stone) and then also picked some citric and lemon-zest smells. Also some orange and/or heavy fruit in the smell along with that Belgian smell of yeast and sweet/caramel malts. The taste is similiar with this being a medium-bodied beer that is balanced between both styles. Has some caramel and sweet malts and bread to make it a little chewey and sweet, while the hops are clearly evident in both passing (citric, floral taste) and on the backbite (crisp and dry). Also minor fruit notes include orange and a tad of grape and tartness - has a VERY minor champagne like quality (could also be from carbonation).

The color is a wonderful bright gold with an pretty good beige head. The nose is yeasty and hoppy. It's much more yeasty than I was expecting and not quite enough hop intensity. The same goes for the flavor, but lack of stronger hops kind of frustrates me. It might just be that they should have upped the malt and alcohol, so that the hops pronounced more flavor than just grapefruit rind bitterness and light astringency. The mouthfeel also doesn't quite work for me. The hops really want to be fruity, but the aftertaste is more astringent than bitter, nearly unpleasantly so. It's a fairly drinkable beer. I'm probably being a little too harsh. It's good beer, definitely enjoyable. My criticism is sort of nit-picky. I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered.","popery","Feb 13, 2009"

The aroma is very sweet, tropical fruit and candied apricots, some peppery spice, and a light grassy hop. Interesting mix of the sweetness and the hops in the flavor. The flavors hit a different times yet kind of mix nicely. Noticable Belgian flavors from the yeast, pale malt, sweet though not sure from candi sugar, some honeysuckle, and a nice balancing hop. The hops are more pronounced then the European hops typically used in Belgian made BIPAs. The feel is quite light, prickly carbonation, finishes sweet and slightly sticky. Definitely an American made BIPA, there is always an odd sweetness with these, perhaps the strong tropical fruit flavor. The hops are in perfect balance, they don't overpower allowing the Belgian yeast to shine through. Seems boozier than the 6.9ABV.","Gmann","Feb 13, 2009"

Fruity and yeasty nose, with definite pear and floral notes, very inviting and reminiscent of the Kuhnhenn beer (which is an exciting prospect to me). Flavor is quite nice. Kind of sweet and fruity, like a pear/apricot jolly rancher, but with a nice floral hop complement and a solid malt base thats syrupy, but not too much so. A dry bitterness on the finish that isn't altogether welcome, but a solid, tasty flavor nonetheless. I like it more as i get further along (isn't that always the case? urp!) Medium bodied, even a little cream-like feel, not think but still milkshake like in texture somehow. Drinks well...hey, i guess i really like everything about this one.

Poured from a bomber into a couple of tulips to split with my wife since she is the Belgian fan and I am the IPA fan. Pours a thick foamy white head on top of a golden, highly carbonated looking ale. Definitely takes on the appearance of a Belgian golden ale. The aroma is lacking much distinct character, definitely some citrus hints and maybe what I would call a "crisp" aroma, nothing much in the way of hops though. Taste is light and tart, due to the previously mentioned carbonation. I do enjoy the balance between what the Belgian yeast did to the West coast IPA style. It is a light ale, and the carbonation takes a bit away from the mouthfeel in my opinion. I realize its not an IPA, but this one lacks a bit too much in the character department for me to seek out, but it is certainly an enjoyable try.","bhalter8","Feb 12, 2009"

The taste was nicely balanced between the Belgian fruity version of the Pale Ale style and the drier American IPA variant. The hops were present but subdued, and some Brett type funk was evident as well. The finish started dry and bitter at first but ended on a sweeter candi sugar and some spice.

It tastes like bready malt, pine and citrusy hops (grapefruit and orange peel), Belgian yeast, peppery spice and ginger. There's good balance in this beer, it's not too sweet and not too bitter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. With the relatively low ABV it wouldn't be hard to drink a couple bombers of this at all. It reminds me a little of the Vertical Epic 08/08/08 I just drank, but I think this is a bit better. If you get the chance to try this beer, you should.","bluejacket74","Jan 01, 2009"

Like a very bitter trippel; more bubblegum and spice, but dry white pepper and pine are right there with it. The beer sweetens as it warms and your palate adjusts.

Carbonation is slightly aggressive and the liquid is smooth. Overall this is a below par Belgian IPA IMO.

The taste is likewise representative of both styles, much better suited to my tastes than the Belgian IPA's I've tried in the past (Urthel Hop-It, Chouffe tripel IPA, etc).

A bit darker (copper-golden) than most tripels, but this one also gives a light toasty-toffee note that balances the fruity esters and spicy phenols well. The strong hop flavors compliment the peppery, clovey, yeasty spices very well with a sharp citrus, chai-tea herbalness that never wavers from the other complex 'Tripel-like' notes. Evaporative feel to the mouth from the dry hops, minty alcohols, and efforvescent carbonation. The beer just lifts off of the toung and dries out in the finish for superb drinking enjoyment Finishes spicy, citrusy, and with a mild phenolic-soapy note that I pick out in most all hoppy Belgians. Not quite a Houblon Chouffe, but very close in quality.","BEERchitect","Nov 12, 2008"

It's amazing what the adddition of a different yeast will do. I like Stone IPA quite a bit, and I like this as well, but the addition of Belgian yeast to the IPA has yielded an entirely different beer. This beer smells and tastes bready and meaty- almost of bacon. There are the standard Stone IPA hop flavors of citrus and lingering piney bitterness, but this bacony breadiness with some tangy notes overlies that. Unusual, and takes a bit of getting used to, but I like it.","Georgiabeer","Nov 05, 2008"
