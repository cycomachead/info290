4.28,0.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 02/25/2015.  Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like stone fruit, apples, citrusy and pine hops, and bready malt.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice, candied oranges, citrus peel and a bit of clove noticeable.  There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick, smooth and goes down easy.  Moderate carbonation.  I liked this brew, certainly worth picking up!  $11.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Thursday at 04:48 PM"

3.47,-18.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,"maybe my least favorite beer from these guys so far, and while i can appreciate it for what it is, i think its over rated on hype alone. its overly belgian, i mean way past bubblegum and high tone fruits, its over the top with that, probably fermented in the 80 degree range or warmer, and just because it has a lot of flavor, does not make it good. its honey colored beer, nice and clear and holding on to a very lacy white head, looks nice in the glass. it smells like leftover belgian yeast, and sweet oily west coast hops. the yeast is just too much, not that there is sediment or anything, but its flavor, its run wild away from the reasonable range, and feels almost sharp as a result. the beer isnt all that dry though, which i find a little confusing. the hop profile on this is excellent, i would guess some simcoe, sticky and rich for sure. it just doesnt need this yeast intensity, it would be a far better beer as an american double ipa, with some nondescript ale yeast, rather than this white winey, taffy, even corny strain that dominates the beer. finish is long, and the alcohol cuts sharply through the oily hoppy tail end, leaving a boozy belgian tang on the tongue. i appreciate making very very bold beers, but this one never really comes together for me. that said, the rest of our tasting group enjoyed it very much, and i am thankful to thebrewo for having shared this rarity with us.","StonedTrippin","Mar 12, 2015"

Until I read on the side of the bottle that it was dedicated to a young gentleman named Rich Sheppard. It pours with an aggressive foamy bright white head. It looks translucent amber/orange... Reminds me of orange/cherry 'Jell-O'  The taste isn't nearly as 'yeasty' as I expected. In fact, I wouldn't  know it was a Belgian style at all init weren't on the bottle. Taste was very pine heavy, starts off extremely piney and finishes with a heavy dose of  citrus, mostly orange, tangerine and Pineapple.  Feel is rich and creamy. Rather light and crisp. While it is def worth seeking out. I will say a drawback for me is, the 'Soap' taste that some IPA's have. Overall, great brew by one of my fav breweries~","BrewUSA","Nov 07, 2014"

While anyone can enjoy the flavors in the first sip, the dry, bitter, astringent finish immediately overwhelms them and defeats the subtle fruit flavors up front. As it stood, it was a beer that only hop lovers or thrill seekers could truly enjoy, but anyone else should take a pass for a more trustworthy IPA.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 19, 2014"

4.05,-4.7,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pour a crystal clear gold with 3 inches of fluffy white head. The head settles down and retains about a cm and leaves significant lacing. The nose starts with heavy American hops. Pine, citrus, orange, and mango come through strong up front with fruity notes of Belgian yeast to follow. The belgo characteristic are largely overshadowed by the aromatic hop profile. The taste starts with a moderate to high bitterness with notes of grass, lemon, pine, and citrus with strong resinous notes throughout. The middle sweetens up a bit and exposes some of the Belgian notes, but bitterness again comes through and leaves a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a moderate body. Overall, the Belgian qualities of this IPA are pretty mild, which I actually like. I'm not a fan of Belgian yeast esters over taking the hop profile and it is certainly not the case here. This tastes right up the alley with the rest of Three Floyds IPAs.","homebrew311","Mar 20, 2014"

It's definitely a maltier beer than what fits the FFF stereotype, but it's still a great hoppy beer and one of the fruitier IPAs they've made. The belgian yeast adds a great level of intrigue to this and it's not one to be missed, easily one of the better Belgian IPAs on the market.","kevanb","Mar 15, 2014"

Light mustiness and fruity yeastiness midpalate. Finishes dry with bitter citrus rind, "juicy fruit" notes, and abundant clean alcohol. Heavier side of medium bodied; smooth and silky mouthfeel.

Really slick, oily, resiny mouthfeel. Fairly thin and very west coast style body. The taste is quite aggressively bitter with some citrus rind and sweet pine. There is some fruitiness to the flavor put this isn't a citrus juice bomb, so go elsewhere if you're looking for that. Very unique and interesting. Hard to place the hop bill, but it plays well together. Only a hint of malt sweetness. I'm not getting the Belgian notes but I'm fine with that. Really aggressively bitter but just enough fruitiness to make it enjoyable. Really fun drink. The only other thing I'd note is that as it warms the finish is quite boozy.","PHBoiler","Feb 14, 2014"

The beer poured a nice clear copper with 1/2 finger thick head that is leaving a nice lace. I left a heal in the bottle to keep the sediment from getting into my tulip glass. The scent includes Belgium malt and fresh hops that provide citrus, slight pine and some floral tones. The taste briefly bitter, then a nice sweet malt comes to the rescue to balance the beer...settling into a smooth slightly bitter, peppery dry finish. The mouthfeel is full in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer and falls in line with all the really awesome small batch beers that 3F brews.","WoodBrew","May 31, 2013"

Grapefruit, lemons, and tangerine. Lightly toasted bready malt detected as the beer gets a chance to breathe though the citrusy hops are pervasive and continue to stick around. As you might expect from the nose, flavor skews heavily towards fruity hops with mandarin coming into the fold along with an herbal component. Since the beer is classified as a Belgian IPA, I would expect more belgian yeasty esters but I'm not detecting them at a level that I've found in other examples of the style. Finishes medium-dry with a lingering grapefruit juice. Medium-light bodied, moderate level of carbonation. Three Floyds consistently does a great job with their lineup and I'm especially a fan of beers in which they feature hop forward flavors. No exception here, well done.","BrewerB","Aug 17, 2012"

Tropical fruits, mango, clementine, tangerine, honeydew melon and a sugary, cookie-like malt. Perhaps some honey Some mild herbal and piney notes also. Complex. Taste is just as hoppy, more of the same in terms of tropical and citrus profile with grassy and herbal notes highlighted in the finish. Strong malt presence as well. Only a suggestion of some Belgian character, perhaps imparting a bit of dryness. Full feel, medium high carbonation. A superior Belgian in real FFF character - awesome, I really don't know how this style gets much better.","liamt07","Jun 09, 2012"
