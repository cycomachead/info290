"I'll admit, my first Belgian IPA...my frame of reference is Trappist brews and American IPAs. The IPAness is there, but it feels like a good Belgian ale, not a good IPA...I will have to reevaluate."

"Great beer. Perfect blend of Belgian yeast and hops."
"Just tasted this beer. Pours a nice reddish amber hazy beer. Smells sweet and alcoholic. Taste is odd, sweet, then fruity then bitter as hell, bitterness keeps growing with each sip, It was hard to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very odd taste, different than any other Belgian!"

"Smells good looks good but, the combination isn't as good as I taught"

"O - 2 - To me, this is not a Belgian style IPA but rather an IPA mixed with a Belgian golden and tripel. I understand that Belgian yeast strains are used in the production, but there is just way too much bubblegum and spice in this for me to call it an IPA at all. Didn't enjoy this one bit and thus cannot recommend it."

"Belgian fruity smell. Belgian yeast and banana up front and hoppy, citrusy, pine in the back."

"This was very good, liked the style, which I hadn't had too many of before, good balance."

"Unique hybrid and very different"

"Pours amber with two finger white head.  Nose is hoppy banana bread.  Definitely Belgian yeast.  Flavor is quite unique - some fruity banana hops and melon followed by a citrus finish.  It is growing on me with each sip.  Medium/full body, moderate carbonation.  I liked this more than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Le Freak pours a golden bronze color with a nice long lasting head.  There is a strong spicy aroma, very hoppy and strong Belgian candy notes.  The taste has some big sweet Belgian candy flavors, with a harsh bitter hoppy finish.  Good feel, nice body.  Overall it is as advertised a Belgian IPA mixed with IIPA, the only problem is the IIPA flavor is a bit odd, overpowering and tastes a bit old."
""
"D:  I do enjoy getting my Freak on.  Amarillo is always a good choice.  Pretty solid beer that hits more on the American IPA side while incorporating that Belgian yeast.  Remarkably well balanced for its size too."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Other than some off smells in the beginning, this pans out to  be a decent brew, an interesting mix,  and worth a go."
""
"Tap. Pours clear orange with white head. Aroma of hops, citrus and grass. Tastes of bitter hops and citrus. Bitter aftertaste. Very good"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a really good Belgian IPA. Almost made me understand why the style is thus named. There were nice yeast and malt notes like a good belgian ale, sweet and alcohol very present. But at the same time the hops just punched your tongue. I really liked this. I'd have it again any day, though it is for sipping slowly."

"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp.  This is an exceptional beer that I am sure I will enjoy again."

"Hazy amber pour with an ample  head. Clove taste comes out fairly strong in the beginning but tapers off through the drink and warming. This beer is not bad but not my taste."
""
"Fruitiness is very strong, but not over powering.  Not sure I would get it again, but still enjoyed it."

"Very unique.  All the fruitiness of Belgian ale with lots of clove banana and maltiness goodness.  Work in the nice hoppy finish that one would expect from west coat friends.  The finish also let's through the banana bread taste as well.  After thought of the combination of two great types of beers makes this one of my recent favorites!  Very exciting new type of beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I didn't really care for this one, I'm not really a fan of the style in general, I don't find Belgian yeasts really complement higher hopping that well. One note of caution for me though is that I had this at a place where the beer sometimes has a funny taste to it, so I might have to grab a bottle of this sometime to compare."

"Overall, this is a pretty standard DIPA brewed with a good, but not exceptional Tripel yeast. It could be better, sure, but the hops and the yeast combine to give this thing an extraordinary balance. It's deceptively drinkable and relatively refreshing for such a high gravity beer. Drink this."

"MMM MMM good! I love this smooth baby. I usually get it bottled and can't remember if I've had it on tap. I've only see it in bombers so far. Nice little treat to have on occasion! I've run out of things to write but I have to reach 200 characters... ;)"

"O-Overall was a great blend of my two favorite styles. Not hoppy."
"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. A cloudy dull orange brew with an odd head, a matrix of small bubbles surrounded by a sleeve of much larger bubbles. Fairly good head retention. Aroma is bright and fruity, very citrus-forward (fresh orange juice) with a decent blast of sweet yeast and Belgian clove-like spice, apple, cotton candy. Palate is a very close split between Belgian tripel and American IPA, as advertised. Often a take on this style will skew decidedly one way or the other, but this exemplar really does try to meld the two in equal measure. Very bitter hop finish and tons of citrus hop flavor, orange and grapefruit rind and flesh plus a tinge of tropical nectar for good measure, mango and melon. Also getting a pungent spice like equal measures of clove and cumin, black pepper and cardamom, faint butterscotch and banana chips/peel. A whiff of bandage-like phenols. Rather spicy and pungent at first but softens over time to reveal a fruit cocktail sweetness that begins to dominate the proceedings late. Quite fizzy and there's a little booze in the finish. I dig the whole laundry list of flavors to find in here and one can telescope in and out to alternate between citrus hops and Belgian spice. For all the shit Green Flash gets for various reasons beyond the scope of this review, they produce world-class IPAs and rather solid Belgians as well, and here is where they meet."

"O - This is a big, complex malt monster, in my sample. The Belgian heritage is obvious and delicious. If it was intended to have Imperial IPA character, the aroma is way too muted, but that is probably due to an aged example."

"What I identify in my more memorable Belgian pale ales and Belgian strong pale ales (and which I don't get here) is that banana-taffy flavor and aroma. I think that might be what some reviewers call a ""tropical fruit"" flavor? Wish I knew what gives a Belgian that odd banana sweetness. Time for research mode..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- an excellent beer. Very different. It combines the best elements of a Trippel and a DIPA: hops, bitterness, spice, clove, and lighter fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Again, this is not necessarily what one would think of when the term ""Belgian IPA"" is bandied about. This is a tripel souped up with West Coast dry hopping. Excellent."

""
""
""
""

""
""

""

"I need a fresher bottle."
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with fluffy white foam, with better than average lacing. Floral hop and bubblegum predominate the nose with some herbaceous earthy spice coming in at the end. Floral, slightly bitter grassy hops start leading into traditional Belgian spice and yeast with clove and bubble gum flavors. Slightly sticky on the palate with a peppery drying finish, and slightly tinny aftertaste. This will be a go to this Spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm finally getting to review this beer after drinkin it on many occasions. One of my if not my favorite Belgian ipa. Super drinkable and tasty beer"
""
"Overall, a very well put together Belgian IPA that nicely balances the hop notes with the yeast esters. Alcohol is well-hidden as well. Definitely one to pick up."
"Medium to heavy body with a noticeable fusel alcohol heat. Firm where needed and yielding when called for. I stand corrected, and bring me another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have been nothing but impressed with Green Flash so far. I have rated others of their beers very high and this is no different. For a Belgian Triple / American Imperial IPA this goes in the ""must try"" category. Delicious."

"O- Interesting hybrid. Bitterness isn't over the top, but more so than in a Dubbel, but the Belgian spice is also subdued. The two styles seem to mild each other out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was enjoyable drinking this from the first sip. Nothing that really stood out for me. A solid beer, but just not my style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a typical Belgian, not a typical IPA. But Green Flash puts its own stamp on the style and blew me away with its appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Not as aromatic as I would have expected, but still a very strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice mouthfeel adds to my admiration of Le Freak. I'm enjoying it."
""
"While hardly my favourite style, this at least comes off as a pleasantly capable version, the Belgian yeast and Yankee hop astringency playing together nicely enough. The experience softens as things move along, which may have more to do with the well elevated and integrated ABV than anything flavour oriented."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this was a hybrid, it's like 4 parts IPA and 1 part trippel. The IPA pieces mask a lot of the trippel pieces, but the trippel pieces are pretty special while you notice them. It's a good beer, is easy to drink, and even with high ABV, is very approachable."
""
""
""
""
"O- when done correctly, I love Belgian IPA's and this is a great blend of two styles. One of the best everyday Belgian IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Alcohol pretty well restrained. Great beer, but I'd have enjoyed it more without the belgian spice/yeast."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be pretty fresh. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, candi sugar, bread, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, candi sugar, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, candi sugar, bread, floral, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of hop and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian IPA. All around awesome complexity and balance of hop and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"A mix of styles, clearly a Tripel hop-turbinated the American way. But this is a Belgian IPA, right? A style that I believe is hard to get it right. Drinkability not so high, given its sweetness, it is a big bottle though."
"Overall: A really good take on a Belgian IPA. Good taste of yeast, fruits, and juicy hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is pale gold with fluffy white head which leave loads of lacing and has nice retention. Tons of cascading bubbles as the beer sits in the glass. Nose starts with heavy belgo yeast which brings some bubblegum and clove. Hops come through with notes of earth, grass, and a touch if booziness. Taste is somewhat sweet with Belgian notes which bring some sweetness and spice to the table. Hops are next and while they are very present, they don't bring much bitterness to the flavor. Mouthfeel is very bubbly with medium body. Overall, this is exactly as billed.. A hoppy triple. Not my favorite style, but nothing bad about this brew."
"A must try, Drink It!"

"Tripel with hops, love the idea, end result is a good beer. Can't see this accelerating into a trend, but I'd love to see the concept run up the flagpole again."
"So, yeah, that's all I've got to say. What do they say? ""An 'out of the box' modern ale crafted by converging two beer styles, Belgian Trippel {sic} and American Imperial IPA. Dry-hopped and bottle-conditioned--it's a zesty brew with enticing American hops and fruity Belgian yeast aromatics."" --signed, ----(I can't read his signature), Brewmaster."
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting beer that I would drink again. It's definitely one you need to sit down, sip, and enjoy to detect all of its nuances. Great job by Green Flash!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a style that I don't try very often. I usually find the blend of tastes off-putting or forced. This one is really not bad. Don't really know if I'd have it again, but it's pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""

"The Belgian yeast goes remarkably well with the West Coast hop levels. Just too bitter for my personal tastes but still a great beer and see how this could appeal to many beer geeks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty tasty Belgian - IPA hybrid. The Belgian elements are obvious as is the hop flavor and bitterness."
""
""
"Overall: Comes across as a very bitter Tripel, as the yeast is the driving factor and the hops taste a little more continental than American to me. Very enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
"has that smell and tatse of a belgium beer plus the hoppy effect of an American IPA"

"Le Freak poured a bright golden color with a large fluffy white head that reflected its bottle conditioning. The aroma was big and fruity with a fresh hop nose and Belgian yeast undertones. The taste started lightly sweet and fruity and melded into a slightly bitter citrus hop flavor that was expertly nuanced and balanced. The best flavors and profiles of the Trippel and Imperial IPA blended exceptionally and continued to pull me back in for sip after sip."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a medium, rocky off-white head. Aromas of freshly cut granny smith apples and a tiny hint of band-aid. Taste begins with a sweet apricot flavor, followed by some sharp herbal, medicinal tastes, then finishing with a grapefruit and asprin finish. Mouthfeel is quite rich. Overall a very good BIPA."
""
"It's a good beer, though the yeast character is a bit much for me. However, for those really going after Belgian IPAs, this is up there."

"Overall this brew is pretty plain for something that is called ""Le Freak"" It does taste as advertised, a cross between a Trippel and an IPA; more Trippel than IPA."
""
"O: Impressive. Still not completely onboard with Belgian strains of yeast, but this is a good starting point."
""
""
""
"O- Can definately tell that this beer has degraded a lot but it’s still a solid drink"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very nice beer. I will definitely pick up some more in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a new favorite. I'm not normally a fan of Belgians or Belgian/IPAs because of the yeast flavor profiles but the strong hops and dry hopping counterbalance this perfectly. I will definitely be enjoying this again."

"Poured from a bomber into a Mike Hess glass. Pours a golden amber with a nice, foamy white head. The trippel part of this brew really stands out in the smell, way more so than the IPA part. The taste is actually pretty balanced between an IPA and a trippel though. Just a hint of pine and loads of citrus and bitterness with that Belgian yeast taste to sort of soften the blow of the hops. Mouthfeel is just below average I'd say. Carbonation was maybe a bit low, I like an IPA with a good amount of carbonation. This beer is basically what you'd get if you took half GF IIPA and half GF Trippel. Now, I enjoyed GF Trippel, but it really wasn't as good as I expected, and GF IIPA is of course amazing, but the two together are just so unique. It brings a smile to my face. This is exactly what GF Trippel was missing."
""
"Overall - Solid, solid brew. Green Flash is great at blending and interpreting styles. Definitely recommend trying this one."
""
""
""
""

"Poured a golden orange body with good head and moderate lacing, thanks to active carbonation, on top of a bountiful aroma of citric and grape like hops that mix, not overpower, with Belgian yeast and some sweet (candi sugar?) malt and orange peel as well. This beer is smooth, not too spicy or bitter or anything that may have gone wrong with combining ""western style"" hops with a Belgian IPA. I find the balancing act a succesful one as there is some sweetness in this beer, both malty (candi sugar, caramel, I think) and touches of tropical fruit (tangerine comes to mind for some reason, as does apricot) but also a spicy, strong hop presence (more orange, citric, touches of grape). Finishes with crisp bite and alcohol is well contained. Overall, a pretty good and interesting beer and not too many like this one are around."

"Overall I thought it was a very good beer but for the off-putting aftertaste of plastic. The aroma and other flavors were very good."
""

"O very awesome and very belgium , quite tasty and enjoyable. Much better than the band of the same name..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Initially I was very excited by the looks and aroma of the beer, but in the end I think that there's just too much packed into here. I feel it would be better with an alcohol content in the 6-7% range, or even lower, as then there would be some nice thirst-quenching potential, given the citrus-like flavours and aromas. Still, it's a good beer and I'm happy to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it scores 100 based on pure uniqueness and the brewers ball size of even attempting to pull off a Belgian style ipa with a tripel lol. This is what I love about Green Flash.. The have the imagination to attempt something like this yet the class to pull it off. A pretty refreshing Belgian ipa. Something ill buy again no doubt."

"O: I’m left wondering whether I got all that I paid for. I know that Green Flash started bottle-dating recently, but it’s possible that the light yellow ink had been rubbed off, which is frustrating. Now, I don’t think every brewer should make their beers like Stone, with the “Enjoy By” date in huge letters on the label, but it wouldn’t hurt to date bottles in a manner that couldn’t be sabotaged by any bottle shop employee with a wet rag and a desire to sell old beer. At any rate, this is a beer that did pretty well with a little age on it. Though I wished it were fresher, I’m glad I got to try – because it was an excellent Belgo-American ale."

"Had on tap at the Sierra Grille. Beverage had a great and orange-copper appearance with a rich, frothy head. Aromas included smells of yeast and hops. Wish I could have pin-pointed the fruit aroma I smelled, but there was a nice ripe, fruit aroma to the drink. Taste was a good mix of fruits and hops. I felt like I could taste a flavor of pineapple and bready hops. Good mouthful of a medium carbonation that helps the flavors come out without being muted. Overall, a pretty good drink. Never tried too many Belgian IPAs, but this definitely makes me want to try more."

"A very complex mix of flavors. Awesome Belgian yeast with good use of hops. This packs a punch in all ways but keeps it's balance. Very nice."
"O-A very complex brew. Combining a Belgian Trippel and a DIPA was a fantastic idea, as the flavors blend perfectly in Le Freak. Everything is mixed well, but no typical notes of the two styles were too subtle. Exceptional brew."
"Nonetheless I like my beer like my women. This one is just throws itself onto you and there isn't a whole lot of discovering involved."

"Served in a tulip on-tap at Big Orange on 4/10. Pours a golden amber, almost burnished bronze color. It was fairly cloudy, but it did allow some light penetration. There is a half centimeter of bright white head, moderate lacing. The smell is very fragrant with decend bready malt and fruity belgian yeast of melons like some tasty honeydew. There is a slight resinous hop that sneaks through as well. The taste is a tasty belgian brew with strong bittering throughout. There is a sweet, tangy flavor as well, but not quite sour, very much like fresh, ripe cherries. There is a bit of a champagne flavor to it as well at the end. The finish is heavy on the bitter and finishes extremely dry. Overall this is a very good beer (so I had another)."
"Overall - I picked this up on a whim because I first heard of it a week ago, thought it sounded very interesting, and just happened across it this weekend. It is very tasty, and very unique so I'm glad I picked it up, despite being a bit pricey. I don't think I'll seek this out very often due to the price tag, but this has definitely sparked my interest in Belgian IPAs. If other examples of the style are as complex and unique as this, then I am in for a fun ride."

"Overall - Fantastic Belgian IPA. Reminds me a lot of the Stone Cali-Belgique, albeit with a significantly stronger ABV. At twice the price, though, I'd opt for the Stone more often than not."
"O: I actually liked the beer for a couple of reasons and didn't like it for a couple also. Liked: 9.2 ABV. - gave me a good-beer-buzz. & was disappointed when the bottle was empty, which happened before I realized. Not liked: Price, the most I ever paid for a 4 pack - $14.00. A little too much. &. The Belgian yeast was a little too strong for the mix, I desire a more fresh-hoppy flavor."

"This is a nice beer. It is a nice BIPA in the sense that it showcases some bright hops and also some Belgian yeast but maintains balance. The alcohol is also relatively well hidden adding only a slight warmth in the finish and some body. This is a BIPA that I could sip on for a while. I like the balance and the flavor profile. It was enjoyable throughout."

"O - poorly executed, i dont think this is a bad bottle, it doesnt taste infected... It just tastes like a poorly brewed beer. I have had way better examples of a Belgian style ipa. This is very one dimensional, bitter and alcohol. I expected much more distinct flavor and a much more enjoyable beer. I feel there is some good favors deep down but they are not coming through. Not a drain pour, I can drink it, but won't buy another."

""
""
"Overall, a very nice offering."
"O- one hell of an interesting combo here. Trippel takes the cake as far as the blend goes but the hops are sneaky and tasty too"
"O- This is a damn fine beer, Deliciously drinkable, not much I didn't like here, has a big, diverse body and combines the great flavors of a Trippel and an IPA. Looking forward to having many more of these."

"Wonderful take on a belgian IPA. Really more like a true belgian tripel with loads of american hops added. Typically, this style just has the belgian yeast, but this one adds the sweetness and malt/candi sugar flavors that are found in tripels. A very tasty beer that stands out for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a little murky as I poured into a wine glass and there was active yeast still bubbling away in the glass. Drank it at temperature in the 45-50 degree range which was just right. smell and taste are a perfect match in this beer as the very hop flavor you anticipate is what you get. No other off flavors to surprise."
""
""
""
"Fantastic job once again from the people at Green Flash. If this weren't such a hybrid, I'd say this is one of the best tripel-styled beers in America. However, the better news that because it's a hybrid recipe, it's a beer that's *unlike* any other I've ever had! Excellent stuff, and will definitely buy more in the future."

"O: nice Belgian pale with hoppy twist. very good"
""
""
"There is at least 1"" of white foam against an hazy golden orange color in my clear glass. The smell of spices, fruit and mild pine filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste of cloves, banana and alcoholic fruit put a surprising finish to the ""zesty brew"". This has a great balance of components in on 12 fl. oz. bottle. This is a #1 brew from Green Flash. I'll be back for more!"
""
""
"O: My first beer from Green Flash I really like this one it's an amazing blend of the two styles. Refreshing complex and well balanced."
"ADDENDUM: As beer gets a little warmer, the tartness fades and the sweetness from the grain expresses itself, making it a little more appealing."
"Pours hazy golden with huge frothy head. Aroma is a nice combination of belgian yeast, citrus hops, and some peach/pear/apple light fruit mix. Both the trippel and the pale flavors are apparent here. A nice blend. Very sweet light fruit up front, with some bitterness on the way down that lingers. A bit of alcohol burn on the back end.medium mouthfeel. Nice beer."
""
"Overall: This is tasty. It has a nice hit of hops for a Belgian style beer. Overall, the Belgian flavor is the dominant one, so only get this if you’re in the mood for that, but it’s a nice taste that mixes well with the hops and it is definitely gulpable. Also, it is shockingly non-boozy for being 9.2%, making it a great beer to get a buzz from."
"Le Freak - The bottle says: ""ZESTY BREW"""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy darker amber, dense offwhite head, settles slowly to a thin layer; spray of lace on the glass. Smell: bubblegum, pepper, medicinal, funky (horseblanket) whiff, lemon peel. Taste: a little grainy and funky, sweet-ish, some peppery and citric balance, then finishes dry with citrus rind reemerging. Booze note."
""
""
""
"O: Solid Belgian IPA, like the orange/citrus thing, like the way the alcohol is well hidden, could be a bit more Belgian-y, the yeast is more prominent in the nose than in the taste."
"O: Solid beer that is big on aroma and taste, very impressive. I would buy this beer again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another solid beer from Green Flash. They impress me in a variety of styles, perhaps none better than their belgian offerings. This one has big belgian flavors, improved upon by the hop additions. A little bit more expensive than I would like, but a very solid beer I will probably get again."
""

""

"M - Thick! This is one big IPA. Very full body and subdued carbonation (I could actually stand for a bit more here). Finish is not dry, but not overwhelmingly sweet either."
"A very nice take on the style, combining American double IPA and Belgian Trippel."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I think it is over hopped, and the bitterness detracts from anything interesting that the yeast is doing for it. It's good, but it's hard to see this as anything but an overhopped beer."
"Pours a clear, very slightly hazy golden with not much head action. The aroma is a combination of autumnal fruit and an almost barbecued pork smell. Slightly offputting but intriguing. But then bam, the first taste is a chewy, Thanksgiving stuffing, savory Belgian nougat, and then the citrusy, resiny hops kick in mid-palate. I find the combination to work very well--manages to combine the two styles in a way that both stand out equally and neither cancels the other out. Way better than Stone's Cali-Belgian. Impressive."
"Nearly flawless beer.... beatiful beer... nice amber colorkng with huge fluffy white head... nice head retention. Huge aromas... the name fits the nose... freaky funky aromas.. lots of belgian yeast fighting with a huge helping of citrus hop presence.. medium bodied and green flashes best beer... atleast from the oned ive had."
""
""
""
"O- In many aspects, this is the king of Belgian IPAs. All of the key factors are there: intense fruity bitterness from the hops; rich, somewhat chalky yeast character; complimentary malt body; vibrant carbonation. Truly a world-class beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Seems a little more Belgian than IPA. Usually, not a fan of Belgian IPAs but I would come back to this one. Green Flash never fails to impress."
""
"Most definitely a tongue ripper as far as bitterness and boozy character goes, yet it does have its appeal. Based solely on my first review, the second tasting is much more balanced yet just as ripping as ever (and that's a good thing). Second opinions (and tries) certainly can paint a new or different picture of things. In this case, I'm much more pleased (and impressed) with this second go-around..."
""
""
"Overall - Another winner from Green Flash - one of my favourite brewers. While this beer does have a lot of vibrant flavours; I was expecting a little more punch. I guess that makes it more drinkable however. The booze is very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with above average carbonation, and a sweet aftertaste, balanced out somewhat by pepper. This is a nice Belgian IPA, which I would gladly buy again."
""
""
"O: I love this West Coast Belgian; it combines my favorite element of each in an assertive yet balanced beer. It'll make hop head somewhat happy , just don't except a total hop bomb."
"Great beer with lots going on funky and just works! Daring to combine a Trippel with an IPA and it comes up a winner!"
""
"Two finger head with nice lacing on a cloudy orange with golden hues body. Grapefruit citrus hops, light pine resin, caramel malts, breads, herbal hops and standard belgian yeast. Flavor follows very nicely with excellent belgian character in the yeast with your prototypical mix of herbal, earthy and citrus hops for the style. Pineapple and orange peel for citrus hops. This one is overly carbonated though and medium in body. Overall a great representation of the style in my opinion even though it is supposed to be an american IPA and trippel hybrid of sorts."
"O: So unusual but so good. The combination of a Belgian trippel and an IPA is daring yet tasty."
"O: Green Flash's version of marrying Belgian and California style brews. A brew which at first may confuse and overwhelm the palate, but remains interesting, exploring new flavor combinations, and creating a style of its own. Although a brew with good ideas, it is far from perfect and I am interested to see how California breweries build on this style of Belgian / West Coast blends."

"This is an ok beer, but it is just too hot and spicy right now... needs some serious time to mellow out."
""
"Overall, one of my favorite beers of all time."
""
"O - A fantastic beer. A great take on combining the best of a triple with an IPA."
"Notes: The hop flavor was big and bold which made for a very interesting beer."
""
""
""
"this is exceptional and very different. it pours hazy glowing blonde with a tall and delicate white head with great retention. smells like a hop bomb, which is to be expected with green flash beers. there is also some really spicy belgian yeast in the nose thats got some peppery funk to it. the flavor is deep. it starts off like a big sappy ipa with oozing citrus hops and an alcohol sting. it is quickly mellowed and enhanced at the same time by the yeast, which rounds out the hops into a full meal of flavors. a lot of stuff dances around the mouth, but the hops just keep coming back. this is a monster of a beer, fresh as can be. feel is good, bright carbonation and a medium body thats made heavier by the sticky hop quality. overall this is a great beer to share, totally unique and very strong. paired will with some ash cured goats cheese and spicy nuts. give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This reminds me more of a traditional Belgian IPA brewed overseas than some Americanized interpretations. The hops don't shine like with Sumpin' Wild and Raging Bitch. So if you like Belgian IPAs with balance, this is great. If you're looking for a hop flavor forward Belgian IPA, this might not do the trick. Either way, this is a well crafted beer."
""
""
"Overall this was different and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a delicious Belgian IPA that stands out in a field of clones. As this genre becomes more popular there are plenty of half-assed attempts out there; this is not one of them."
""
"O: I really like the attempt at the hybrid style, but it just finishes too bitter for me. The bitterness really detracts from wanting to take another sip, regardless of how complex this beer might or could be. Just a little too muddled for my taste"
""
""
""
"O: this isn't a bad brew, however I'm still finding my bearings on the ""Belgian IPA"" style. Yes, this is good, I'm pretty sure I'd have this again."

""
"Drinkability: This is an excellent brew that is well worth the price."

""

""

"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with a very yeasty flavor and a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer. You get the greatness from being an IPA with the extra hoppiness, finished with the malty Belgian taste. I wasn't sure about this beer, but I try almost everything Greenflash puts out. This one is excellent, and definitely something I will drink again."
"This is a very fine beer. There is a delicate sort of balance about it between very intense hoppiness and traditional Belgian malts and yeastiness. I will definitely be picking this one up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not a bad brew at all. Very interesting and good-tasting."
""
""
"Mouth feel is velvety and lovely. Overall, I think this one is a repeater. It's not easy to categorize other than it goes in the category of ""I like it""."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled in the middle of May. Pours an attractive reddish orange with a half inch of sticky white head, that leaves ample lace. Smell is clove, orange, bread, banana, pine, and grapefruit. Taste is big clove and orange up front, with grapefruit and pine in the powerful finish. Body is medium large, lots of carbonation, not very dry for the style, and very drinkable for the hefty ABV. This is an excellent example of a style that I am starting to love. I am not a huge Belgian fan, but when you give me the hop fix like Raging Bitch, Smuttynose Hormonuculis, and Le Freak I truly enjoy."
""
"O - The more I drink from Green Flash the more I love them. This is a fantastic BIPA, only slightly below Rich Life from FFF. Super easily drinkable for a 9%+ ABV. Great fresh flavors and clean finish. Keeps you coming back for more. Wish I could find a 22oz bottle!!! Green Flash = most underrated west coast brewery."
""
""
"O- Pretty smooth, with an interesting mixture of flavors, but it isn't a world-beater. Good mixture of flavors. Overall, I like it, but I'm not in love with it."
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy golden with a large, white head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of sticky lacing is left behind as the head dissipates. There are aromas of citrus and piney hops, but these are not very strong. There are sweet malts and Belgian yeasts. Having just had a tripel, I can see where this is an IPA meets a tripel. The hops are forward in this beer, but not like they are in typical West Coast hop bombs. There are flavors of citrus, bready malts, caramel, pine, and good Belgian yeast. It tastes like the perfect marriage of a Belgian tripel and an American IPA. The body is medium to full with good carbonation. There is a dry finish to this beer and this is highly drinkable. This is an excellent beer. Green Flash has yet to disappoint me."
"O: a nicley balanced Belgian ipa, I was nervous at first but this one really pulled through, a great hybrid of two styles, if you like Belgian ipa's this one is a must try."
"D - A great beer, overall. As with every offering from Green Flash, I'm very impressed. They might have overtaken Founders as my favorite brewery with this one. It's a brewery that really just gets it. Drinking a beer from Green Flash is like watching a movie from your favorite director where the director is on point with his usual, familiar aesthetic, where he is expert, and where everything is exceptionally bold but never overdone. I recommend anyone with similar affinities to try Green Flash's Rayon Vert - it's like no other beer I've ever encountered."
"Overall: Haven't had a Belgian IPA in some time, and this one was a great find. The 9.2% ABV is an afterthought with this one, very drinkable after a long day at the office. Definitely recommend and will pick up this and more Green Flash brews now that they are available in ATL. Good stuff."
"O- Really glad that this finally made it's way to NY. I'll definately be picking up a few more 4-packs of this one! Great complexity... tons of flavor, and goes with so many different foods."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good offering by GF to the BIPA style. Super hops up front that leave a lingering bitterness, but the beer did get better as it warmed up. Hops could be toned down a bit or just add a bit more sweetness,which in turn will add more alcohol to the beer. The alcohol is veyr well hidden too."
""
""
"Enjoyed this beer. Just a nice hybrid and good change of pace. Would definitely try it again."
""
""
"Fantasic brew here, love this take on Belgian IPA. Great beer."
""
"O: I think of this beer as one of the best DIPAs I've had in awhile. The Belgian yeast ads some complexity, and the cane sugar dries it out."
"What are you waiting for? Go get your Freak on."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. The white billowy head on this is gigantic atop of a amber body that had cloudy swirls in it, which alarmed me at first since I'm unfamiliar with this style of beer! The hops are at the forefront of the smell. The hops are readily apparent in the taste as well, but are balanced out nicely by a malt flavor. For how high the alcohol percentage is in this beer, it hides it well. After you take a swig you're again reminded of the hops in the aftertaste, there's a common theme here! The mouthfeel of this beer is great, thanks to the balance of the ingredients. Truthfully, if I have to tell someone what my favorite beer is, I'll respond with this one."
""
""
"Overall: This is an interesting beer for sure. Never had anything quite like it. The intent - to mix a tripel with an imperial IPA - is achieved quite well on the taste, if not so well on the nose. Really enjoyable. Would benefit from better carbonation and improved feel."
""
"O: to me, this was like a double IPA with a Belgian strong pale ale finish; an excellent beer"
"Overall this one underwhelmed me. Not enough hops (IMO) and a bit to sweet. I feel like the flavor profiles don't come together in the end. Drinkable, but I won't buy it again (hell I didn't even buy this, it was given to me)."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, sweet alcohol, fruit, wheat, fruit hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, wheat, spice, spicy hop, earth, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was a lot going on in this one in both the aroma and flavor, however they didn’t all seem to work together in my opinion, but rather against one another. This really hurt the overall brew in my opinion. There was definitely a lot of spice going on here which was nice blended with the fruit tones, but the alcohol came along and wrecked it all. Too bad. Worth trying to judge for yourself."
""
""
"Overall (4.0): So, as Belgian IPAs go, this occupies the tripel-BSPA / DIPA hybrid part of the spectrum, which is a pretty solid route if you’re crafting a Belgian IPA. Others are basically American (D)IPAs with a nominally Belgian yeast profile, and others are basic IPA recipes with a farmhouse strain. This beer is Belgian first, and IPA second. It works for me, but whether or not you dig this beer depends on what you’re looking for from the style. But if you like tripels and unfiltered BSPAs, and also love hops, then this is your beer. My only real complaint is that it isn’t as bombastically hopped as a lot of American (D)IPAs, but Green Flash has crafted a really excellent brew regardless. Definitely seek this out! AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY PLEAS FOR LE FREAK IN 12oz BOTTLES, GF!!"

"This is full bodied, with very lively carbonation. This isn't terrible, but the yeast flavor isn't great and the hop flavor is mostly just bitter. I should disclose I don't love this style in general."

"This was one of the first craft brews that I tried as I got into craft beer, and this is first time I have gotten around to reviewing it. It is as good as I remember. It really combines the aspects of the ipa and tripel quite well, balancing the flavors in a very natural way."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty enjoyable beer overall although I would pick a Belgian yeast strain with less tart and more fruity esters to go with the hops and evident alcohol fruit character."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid ale. The brewery bills it as a combination of an IPA and a tripel, and I think that description is apt. Combining the hoppiness of an American IPA with the delicate malt and yeast balance of a Belgian tripel, this is one seriously complex, interesting ale. Nicely done Green Flash!"
""

"Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a dry finish. Very quenching and easy to drink beer; not much indication at all of the relatively high ABV. Recommended."

"A surprising and intriguing beer. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of so-called Belgian IPAs, but I enjoyed this. It's not something I'd want to session all night, but as a stand alone bottle, I dig it."

""
""

"O: This is my first foray into Belgian IPAs. Tastes similar to what you might expect, like a Belgian ale with strong hop flavor. Still, interesting and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is not a bad brew by any means, the scent is really quite wonderful but i feel a bit like the wrong notes popped out in the taste, none of the spiciness from the nose came through in the mouth, probably a one time shot for me"
""
"O- This is one of the most strange beers I have had in a long while and I quite like it. Having read the very mixed reviews on this beer it looks to be a love it or hate it type and I can definitively tell why. If you like to taste something different every so often, here's your beer."
"A 22 oz bomber poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a mostly clear bright orange amber. 2 finger off white head lingers a bit and leaves nice lacing as it slowly shrinks to coat the top. Aroma is very complex. Apricot, bread, grapefruit, fresh cut grass, Belgian yeast, golden raisins, and sour apples. Taste is bitter citrus up front. Grapefruit and pine resin. It quickly moves towards a bready, sweet candi, yeasty flavor. Pretty much a perfect fusion of the styles. Mouthfeel is medium and finish is dry. Excellent beer."
"There are better Belgian IPA's out there."

"This beer poured a golden hazy color with a full foam head. The aroma was that of floral hoppiness with a citrus undertone. Upon my first sip I instantly loved this beer. Mild hop flavor hidden by the sweet spiciness of the triple. The beer finished with a nice hint of lemon. I highly recommend this beer as a truly wonderful experience."
""
""
""
"O - A damn good beer! A trippel mixed with a Double IPA? Nice!"
""
""
""
"The fresher version is much cleaner but has a lot of odd tart and mixed up flavors. They all really dont blend all too great together. I think I prefer this one with the age despite it feeling a little heavier due to the sweeter flavors. The beer gets a lot more complex with time and a lot of great fruit flavors are aloud to come out. The hop presence and the belgian influence just dont seem to work so letting the beer age the hop flavors out is kind of nice. None the less, I wasn't incredibly impressed with this beer fresh or aged. Fresh was just too all over the place despite it being so clean. Aged is kind of nice and exhibits some unique fruit flavors but they're not good enough to store away the beer for such a time. On top of this the flavors get kind of muddied and you can find cleaner belgians ready to drink now with similar qualities."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is an amazing beer. Very tasty and refreshing without sacrificing body, taste or aroma. This is a top notch brew. I wish it was more easily accessible because I would keep this brew stocked from March to October for sure."

""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, gold/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, yeast, hint of wheat, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight wheat, hint of coriander, hint of pale malt, and slight yeast. There is a strongly cloying aftertaste. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
""

"this is great for a sunny but windy/chilly day like today. puts a nice warming sensation in your chest. a very great smelling and looking beer but in my opinion could've worked a little better with a bit more hop flavor."

""
""
""
""
"O: More IPA than Belgian, I felt this beer definitely improved as it warmed up a bit. Probably not a style I'd seek out often, but I was glad to give it a taste."
""
""
""
"Slightly watery up front with a nearly full bodied middle and finish. Slight dryness with some ABV warming presence from the swallow on. Nice brew without the overkill hops of the standard west coast breweries."
"Although the IPA part seems to dominate more time on the palate of my mouth, I really enjoyed the overall beer. Will drink again."

"Overall – This was quite a fantastic beer. It takes some of the best features of each beer style; the very nice yeasty/spicy/bready/creamy feel of a good Belgian and the great hop flavor of a nice IPA. Very well done!!"
""

"Overall: this is quite a good beer. I tend to be impressed by Belgian-style IPAs which are based on tripels, and Le Freak is no exception. I'd definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Really good brew. Get one if you see it!"
""
"O - This brew is unique, but is a *slight* miss on style. It's flavors are very strong and at times quite pleasant, however, once in a while bad tings come out... It's recommended, but I'd let it sit for a month or two to ""mellow"" out a bit."
""
""
""
"What a tasty Freak, segueing perfectly from the big, creamy Tripel character into the dry, snappy DIPA character. And those fruit tones are absolutely stellar. This and the Imperial IPA are by far my favorite GFs that I've tasted, but this may just have the edge with its freakness."
"bottom Line: worth a try"
""
""
"(D)- Not bad, but a little strange and disjointed. Too old? I cant be for sure due to no bottled date."
""
""
""
""
"This has a lot of the Imperial IPA character, with the malty richness and huge hops. Very bitter aftertaste. Overall it's just too much of the bitter hops but the yeasty and bacteria flavors are quite forward. On the coarse side and quite sharp. 22 oz bottle from Mega Liquor in Hemet."

"Body is medium to medium-heavy, with modest carbonation that is a bit too low weight of the beer. Mouthfeel results in a slightly sluggish feel. Finishes dry. Really, the only aspect of this beer I wasn't particularly impressed with."
""
"Had the hop character been present in the aroma, I would've been more impressed, but the beer is a solid offering, with the flavor profile making up for the aroma shortcomings. Still think I like houblon better."

"Poured this Belgian IPA from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a clear golden color, produced a thick, off white creamy head. Excellent Head Retention and thick rings of lacing were left on the pint glass. The aroma consisted of sourdough yeasty, spices , cracked pepper, citrus lemon peels and cloves. Medium in body, this Belgian IPA had a base of malted grain, a melody of fruit including pears, granny smith apples and citrus hops. This ale was more fruity then hoppy- not bad just not what i expected. The bottle says that is a mix of Belgian ale and an American Imperial IPA. I just dont find anything ""Imperial"" about this IPA. Overall, i think this is an excellent session beer- just don't go into it thinking your getting an aggressive hopped IPA- You will be disappointed.This beer failed my time honored IPA Test....I give my wife a sip and if her face doesn't pucker - its not up to par. Not only did she not pucker...she said mmmm this one is good. ....IPA Fail! ;) Prost!"

"O-I had pretty high expectations for this one but unfortunately they fell short.Nice looking beer with a good nose but something didn't quite work for me."

"This one was interesting, but ultimately a bit disappointing. I guess I should have tried this first in my sampling, because the Rayon Vert set the bar too high. Ultimately, this one is too yeasty and pungent. Don't know if I would buy again, to be honest. Understand that this is only because GF makes better beer. This is still a complex, interesting Belgian inspired IPA."

"O - Very enjoyable Belgian IPA. Noticeable alcohol takes it down a notch."
""

"Crazy fucking beer but I love it! Some may deride projects like this but chances are, they're too close-minded to meet Le Freak!"
"I may have this again on Tap if I see it but no luck on bottles since the price tag is around 10.50 and that's beyond my limit."

"What you have here is basically a DIPA dialed-up with Belgian yeast. And you know what? Le Freak works."
"Overall: A must in trying. This will broaden your horizons on beer styles if you have not ventured out much. Even if you have, it's still a great beer to enjoy a different hybrid."
"Compared to other Belgian IPA's that I have tried this one just doesn't seem to have the same balance that would raise it above the bar. If you are a hardcore Green Flash fan and love their over the top hop profiles, then I think you will love this beer. But for me, I found it to be worth a try but not worth seeking out again."

"Appearance is light orange, slightly hazy, nice cream colored head. Its` nose contains apple, banana, clove and belgian yeast. The taste of Le Freak has some malts, a good amount of hops, more belgian yeast, quite a bit more citrus. MF is pretty dry with some bitterness in the finish. It was nice to try this beer again, the last time I had it was a few years ago and at that time from a bottle that could have been past its` prime."
"O: A little too hyped in my opinion, but definitively an interesting beer. Appearance wasn't great to me, smell was adequate, taste was lacking the Belgian side, and mouth was decent. Worth trying at least once, but not something I would buy again, or recommend."
"This beer is pretty good but a bit too bitter and dry. I like to see it with more hop character on the back end, because i wasn't really picking anything up there."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip, sadly no freshness date. This pours a light orange color with a massive white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are wonderful, a nose full of sweet yeast esters, banana and spices, along with a little hop. The feel is medium with even more carbonation. The taste us outstanding, first is a bitter mouthful of hops, followed by a semi sweet taste, then a nice bitter after taste, another great one from green flash."

"o - Overall a decent beer, but not my favorite. Some nice citrus hops in the nose, but a bit tangy and too sweet for me. Not something I'd probably seek out again."
"Glad I took the plunge again, as I really enjoyed the beer, and it's new label."
"Overall: I'm not a big fan. This truly is freaky, and I recommend trying it, just to see what it's like, but I don't think bubblegum and cotton candy go well with grassy bitter hops."
"Pours a cloudy, copper color. Head is very creamy but dissipates quickly, with medium carbonation left behind. Smells of wheat, oranges, and a slight twang. The beer begins with a citrusy taste that develops into a sweet maltiness that ends with a slight hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium. The drinkability is great but because it is a hefty beer not thank drinkable. Overall an amazing beer, especially being one of my first blends for a beer."

"Hazy, dirty yellow. Frothy white head, about a fingers worth. Citrus hops in the nose right up front. Spicy yeast also becomes a dominant aroma. Light wheat bread malts. Peppery spice and orange, tangerine and lemon hops once it hits your tongue. Malt character is similar to the nose. Light and crisp wheat and bread flavors. Hops maintain a strong fruity presence all the way to the finish where they slowly show a orange/lemon peel bitterness. Impressive this is 9.2% with such a crisp and thin body. Tasty hoppy beer. Hops overpower the yeast character but it does faintly compliment the hops."
"Overall – Have never been a fan of Belgian IPA’s, not going to lie. This one was not so much IPA as it was a Trippel in my opinion. Would not revisit."
"Smells hoppy and aggressive. Some nice floral aromas. Very belgiany under the hops. Tastes bitter and hoppy. A bit harsh but a really nice flavour profile. Thick, a bit syrupy moth feel. Overall pretty enjoyable but harsher than i typically i enjoy"
"O: Not a bad Belgian IPA overall, but I get the feeling that most would be able to find an IPA that is either American, English, or Belgian which would suit their palate better."
"overall - A very nice beer. Reminds me of Houblon Choufe Doublon IPA Tripel, but fresher and more floral. Very tasty. I'd highly recommend this as one of the best beers you could consider buying if available."
"O - a real good Belgian ipa. Not much more to ask for"
"O - this was a pretty good beer. I'd buy it again. I'd like to get a pour with a good head on it and see if it changes this beer for me."
"O: Yum! This essentially takes two of my favorite beer styles and takes the best aspects of each one. What's not to like? It's hoppy, bitter, and malty like an IPA, but it's sweet and yeasty like a tripel. Honestly, this is my first foray into the style, so I'm comparing this to their Imperial IPA, which I had last night and what I'm guessing is the IPA they used in this brew. It shares a lot of the aspects of the Imperial IPA, but it's less intense. The tripel really balances it out. I'm definitely digging this more than their Imperial IPA."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was that funky bitterness. With this yeast mixing with the Belgian type malts, this made for a sticky and sweet, and delicious beer. This beer is very characteristic of the style, with big bitterness. This bitterness could have been enhance, and arguably better, if the hops had even more of a presence overall."
"O - A very nice triple, a bit to much hop but I guess thats American."
"Dr: Very drinkable, but the quality of the flavour is limited. The ABV is high, but it suffers from low quality."
"This ia more of a Belgian IIPA than BPA. Starts off with a very tropical hoppy aroma. When it hits the tongue I get some that tropical fruit, a bit of pine, then a slight malt sweetness. There's a noticeable alcohol burn and taste just before the finish that leaves you with a boatload of hop bitterness! Wow, I didn't expect that. A unique experience, highly recommended."
"Overall, this is amazing beer, and has obviously been crafted by experts dedicated to the betterment of their craft. I suspect the unique qualities of this beer--specifically its bipolar flavor profile and huge bitterness--will seem offputting to many, and I can't help but feel that the brew is slightly out of balance, and tries to do too many things at once. Still, this is an ale that has to be tried to be believed, and is worth seeking out."
"Overall, this was a really enjoyable beer- I would seek it out again for sure."
"That stylistic schism makes the mouthfeel on these beers hard to score too. If this is nominally an IPA then the beer is too thick. But it's mostly spot-on for a Tripel. I'm going to score it as above-average and call it a day. Overall, this is not the kind of beer that I'll likely revisit. I don't much care for Belgian IPAs that aren't IPAs first. To its credit, Le Freak gives a strong effort as far as that kind of beer goes."
"This one pours Orange and cloudy. Medium sized and almost white head. Fruity, sweet and hoppy aroma. A nice mix of bitter and sweet. It has the long bitterness of an IPA but there is a sense of the belgian yeastiness and sweetness. It seems like the new wave of ""New Style"" brews."
"overall, nice mash-up, very glad i got to try it."
"O: At 1st I was unsure what to think of this brew; however, afterwards I was quite impressed with this brew! Normally, I pass Green Flash brews up because the labels just do not stand out...I'll keep my eyes open from now on."
"O: The alcohol is well hidden from both the smell in taste, but the combination of bitterness and spiciness makes this more of a sipping beer."
"Another excellent summer drink, wonderfully balanced, tasty and refreshing. Love this beer."
"O- This beer is right up my alley. It is pleasant to drink and packs a punch. I'll be grabbing a bottle of this on a regular basis and might try to brew a clone myself."
"O: Eh. This beer is pretty forgetable. Not bad at all. But it does not come through as advertised. If you're looking for an interesting blend of styles (as I was), this will dissapoint. Through no fault of their own, I got the impression that this is a West Coast Brewery struggling to expand their profile. Maybe it was the influence of the boring label, but I think this is a poor example of a Green flash beer...they have better beers on the market."
"O - This beer is great. Might not be my favorite true Belgian IPA but still is a delicious take on the style and a great beer in general. Thanks to arniepnminne for this great brew."
"O:"
"O - As a huge tripel fan who drinks IPAs mostly during the warmer summer months, I found the scent of this beer irresistible once I sniffed it. However, the tripel quality really seems buried in the hoppiness at the end of each sip. A good offering when keeping in mind the challenges of mixing the divergent styles, but a little more hoppy than I was hoping. I'd like the yeast to star a bit more. But for a hophead who likes the bready nose of a tripel but would prefer it finish with the bitter hoppiness of IPA instead of that sweet maltiness of a Belgian, this is perhaps a dream come true."
"D - A good beer was definitely not dissappointed, I enjoyed this one, different kind of IPA."
"Overall-Very nice blend. Nothing wow'd me, but it definitely is a nice representation for the style, and for someone who hasn't had many(like me)"
"T: Lots of belgian yeast and spice upfront with a bit of tropical fruit and piney hops on the finish. Pretty solid take on the style."
"O-definitely a belgian IPA. its a good mix of bitter hops and belgian sugars/spices. its also fairly complex as well as fairly well balanced. i like it. its not something i want a lot of, but its definitely a decent attempt at the style."
"A good marriage of Belgian yeast and a San Diego style hoppy and bitter IPA. Better carbonation would have significantly improved a couple areas, but still a pleasure to drink."
"Opinion: Overall I have been really happy with this beer. It has a different experience in flavor, and really favors a Belgian Pale overall and would compete with any of the best of them in my opinion. That said, it isn't necessarily my favorite style, so I doubt that I will feel the need to go back here, but it was a good experience and I am glad that I took Robert's word for this one. He's racking up credits, IMO."
"My first time here, might as well go for something I've heard good things about. It pours a clear amber topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, tart mandarin orange, lemon zest, ruby red grapefruit, and banana. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, orange peel, lemon zest, clove, banana, Belgian yeast, and light caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a dry, nearly sticky finish. Overall, a great BIPA, one that definitely lives up to the billing of being a collision between IPA and tripel. Very good times."
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden yellow color, the head was fluffy and white. The lacing on the glass was really nice too. The smell of the beer was packed with hops and some Belgian yeast. The aromas of fruits, pine and spice all wrapped into one nosefull. The taste of the beer was really nice, the flavors of a traditional Tripel upfront that quickly gets pummeled by the big amount of hops in this brew. The taste finished with a dry spicy pine flavor in the back of your mouth. The mouthfeel is very delicate for such a beer that has an aggressive side. Overall this beer was a lot of fun to try."
"Overall it's very interesting and a bit odd, but quite enjoyable. Great job on creating a new and interesting beer for me to try whilst on vacation in Cali!"
"O: You get a lot of what's typically good about west coast style IPAs and Belgian Tripels in this beer, but very little of what is potentially great in either or the combination of the two. Overall a solid mix of styles that I could see myself picking up again or recommending to somebody, but I did find the idea of this beer out of Green Flash was more exciting than the reality."
"O: I liked the variety of flavors and smells, but I think this beer could do with a little more fizz. My mouth was pretty pumped with all of the many different flavors and smells, but the finish is a little bit bitter and lingered in my throat. Overall, complex, tasty, with a weird finish. Good."
"O: This is a solid beer, and I think of it as being more trippel than IPA. That said I think you could make a case for it being more one or the other, as it will come down to the drinkers interpretation of the Belgian yeast presence. However the hop qualities are not lost, and kept me searching the depths of my mandarin tulip. I think the mouth feel and taste make for a wonderful combination. Each are good on their own, but the thing that takes this up a bit is the synergy between them. the pepper tingles with the carbonation, and the yeast coats the mouth in a way that flavor gaps are repaired. The alcohol is there, but it is not by any means a party-pooper. Give this a whirl."
"O - i wish i could get this on the regular, good representation, i enjoy the good hop presence to keep a control on the belgian influence that can be overpowering sometimes with the style. i love the style and how it is outside the box, if the joker had a favorite beer style this would be it drink it and let your freak shine."
"Medium body, a little sticky and with a long-lasting bittering hop aftertaste, this is definitely a good blend of styles."
"Bit alcoholic and metallic taste lingers on the finish. Overall a nice quaffable brew that hits the spot."
"I'm a huge fan of Flying Dog's Raging Bitch Belgian IPA, so I held high hopes for this brew. Unfortunately, I feel a bit let down, as it seems the brewer could not decide which direction to go with this beer, so s/he decided to go a few at once. The alcohol content is very evident in the taste, and the bitterness ismmore metallic than bitter. For $10 for the bottle, I'd spend my money elsewhere next time."
"On first sip, I was dissappointed that the west coast IPA destroyed the tripel, but this brew warms up nicely on the palette."
"1Pt .6 FL oz bottle purchased in San Diego. Not a huge Pale Ale fan but this is a good beer. Fair hoppy flavored with a little bit of citrus not bad for a Pale Ale beer. Good overall color, body, texture and finish. ABV % of 9.2 is definitely there. Taste is more robust as beer warms up but finish heats up a bit too."
"O - A long way behind the Belgian versions of this style"
"This beer is really interesting, fresh is a nice citrus and floral IPA with just a hint of funk, older gets fairly funky with less of the hop profile. On both ends its a great beer IMO. This is a fairly standard go-to for me when I have to pickup a beer for a party or something, especially for newer beer drinkers to really show them the ropes."
"D - Fun and flavorful. An interesting blend of styles but for for me, it's more west coast than Belgian."
"Lots to mull over here. Plenty of character but a real mild drinkability as well, in spite of the ABV. Pleasant drop."
"Yeah, it's a good blend, and it's a good use of the blend. Individually, the hoppy characters and the Belgian spice wouldn't make either a good IPA or a good Belgian Ale, but together they mesh nicely to complement one another. What you end up with is a rather tasty and rather unique brew."
"Green Flash mixed two styles perfectly almost like those old, old Reesee cup commercials where the choclolate bumps into the peanut butter."
"One of the better Belgian IPAs, though it leans a little too far toward the Belgian side for my tastes. I could use some more hops."
"D- The beer itself is good, will certainly seek another out to have by itself. The label's design is nice too, making it stick out in my mind."
"Final verdict: A drinkable Belgian IPA to be sure. Worth the trade."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip glass. Slightly hazy orange bronze with a thick, frothy well-lacing off-white head. Aroma of big citrusy grapefruity hops and sweet caramel and biscuity Belgian malts and yeast. Body starts with good malty fullness and sweetness well balanced with bountiful citrus flavor and bittering hops before a crisp, slightly warming bittersweet finish. Definitely my favorite brew from Green Flash."
"D: Crazy-good; very drinkable. Definitely recommended. After just two of them, I've concluded I'm a big fan of Belgian IPAs. I could absolutely go for another bomber of this *right now*. I can't taste the alcohol at all."
"The ABV--and the alcohol is rather present--and the woody aftertaste, don't make it highly drinkable, but having just one is very pleasurable."
" ~ Very unique characteristics in this rather unique styled beverage. The combination of a San Diego Pale Ale and Begian Tripel makes for one of the more interesting brews I've had in awhile. This is a sipping brew and one that should be enjoyed by all... or at least me and the freaks."
"This is a nicely balanced malt and hop concoction, with a tropical fruit undertone. In terms of the Belgian IPA style, Le Freak is more malty and hoppy than their collaborative Bier de L'Amitie (with St. Feuillien), which I think better presents the tropical fruit elements of the Belgian yeast. But this is a very well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable beer. Don't really taste the ABV level due to the powerfully flavorful elements of this beer, but it can creep up on you."
"Alcohol comes through mid-glass and slows this down to an easy sipper."
"a nice blend of styles"
"Pours a cloudy orange colour with thin white head. Nice head retention and some lacing on the glass. Smells of strong citrus hops, candy sugar and Belgian yeast. Lots of bitterness in the flavour, with the dry yeast coming through. Quite smooth on cask. I'd love to have this again."
"The 9% is somewhat detectable which is the only thing that would limit the drinkability on this one. Otherwise it's a fine blend of two styles that I very much enjoy. If you are looking for a hop bomb or a belgian sweet bomb then look elsewhere; Le Freak tries to marry the two and pulls it off quite nicely"
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a beer mug. The beer is a bright copper-golden color with a foamy, 2-inch head. The beer has smells of citrus and sweet spices, an even blend that is very enticing. The beer has initial tastes of round sweetness, with a base of spices that taste like coriander and cinnamon. There are also hints of the alcohol in the beer mixed in with the heavier flavors. The beer has a spicy and somewhat sour finish, with the spices and sour notes present on the aftertaste. The beer is surprisingly crisp and sharp, in spite of the bold, round flavors. Finish is pleasant, and this is easily a get-in-trouble, drinkable beer. Could polish off a lot of this one in a given sitting. Very tasty, light, and pleasant beer."
"D - This is a damn fine BIPA even though its not as hoppy as others out there still very drinkinable and a beer thats worth finding to give it a try sometime"
"A solid drink and really tasty."
"Pours dark gold with a solid two finger head. Hop bitterness up front with a sweet malty aftertaste. The richness from the tripel with the up front flavor of a good pale ale. Nice thick lacing. As it opens up the flavors flip, the tripel up front with a pale ale finish. Does not taste at all of a 9.2% brew."
"The marriage between Belgian and IPA always seems a tricky proposition. The sweetness of the Belgian can go well with the sweet malt of a big IPA, but the bittering that goes so well with IPA malt does not always integrate with the Belgian sweetness. While not an outstanding beer, the brewer does a pretty good job of getting everyone in the boat. There seems something here that is just a bit lacking, that I can't quite put my finger on. Just needed a bit more punch in either the hops or the Belgian character."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bomber with no lot code/date. Sampled on December 2, 2010. The pour is a highly carbonated pale orange-light amber with a good inch of delicate, foamy tan head that sticks around and leaves lacing. The aroma has some notes of yeast, wheat, grape/apricot, and a little alcohol. The body feels medium with a kind of slick, honey-like texture on my tongue. The beer has a playful weirdness about it with its spectrum of yeast, malts, wheat, and spices up front and a sour, but thin hopped ending."
"IMHO, a pretty poorly executed beer. The balance between the hops and the belgian flavors is completely out of wack. This brew would get much higher marks from me if it was just listed as a DIPA, but I'm rating to style. This brew is completely over hopped (and I'm usually a fan of hoppy beers). I would not seek this out again."
"A Hops forward ipa. Earthy hops have a good bite, alcohol well hidden along with the other ingredients. If you like hops and alcohol up front this brew will suit you!"
"This one really benefits from the warmer serving temperature, but still isn't as enjoyable as a traditional SD IIPA or a Belgian IPA."
"D - I really don't like the flavors that come with a tripel and unfortunately they are way too present in this for this to be enjoyable for me. I like the citrus hop flavors but they just aren't strong enough. I'm glad I got to try this but I don't see any reason to try it again in the future."
"overall, i really enjoy this beer it is very nice"
"Overall this ale is well crafted and balanced. The flavors of Belgian yeast are not over-done and the the hops bring a nice complexity. It's not quite on par with similar beers of the style such as Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel, but I would drink this again."
"D - Nice enough & worth trying but I probably won't be buying this again."
"D- An above average brew, but not something that I'm feeling excited about. 1 was probably enough."
"D: This beer is good but not exactly what I was expecting. If I were to compare it to triple I would say it represents the style well. I dont feel it holds up well as an IIPA. There isnt much, if any hop flavor or aroma."
"D: It's been my experience that American hops don't really go well with Belgian yeast. This beer didn't disabuse me of that notion. A shame, too. Ive been a big fan of every other Green Flash beer I've had."
"Very drinkable a great example of the style."
"D-- Excellent. Well balanced between Belgian and US styles. ABV is well hidden and although it is a sipper due to the bitterness, it is quite drinkable. Such a good beer. Wish I had more of it."
"Drinkability overall isn't what I want from the style, most versions are their own worst enemy this is a perfect example of that. American hops and Belgian yeast are hard to harmonize."
"I am really suprised at how good this beer is."
"A touch of warmth towards the finish is nice, and considering many similar beers with less alcohol are far more boozy, Green Flash pulled off a great job of providing flavor instead of just alcohol."
"Overall this is a really amazing Belgian Tripel/IPA, I have a feeling that if it was hopped differently if could stand on its own as a Tripel, or if it was fermented with an American ale yeast, it could easily be a solid DIPA. The combination of the two is done quite well. I paid $10 for the bomber, which I find to be a bit expensive. I feel like it is fairly well worth the price, but it will not be a frequent purchase because of it."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, a dry candy sugar and small hints of hops. In the taste, dry candy sugar and a pine like hop presence. A small hop, but mainly smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry Belgian like yeast on the aftertaste. Nice hop presence, with Belgian like hints."
"Pours a nice golden color, slightly hazy, with a big, durable white head. On the nose, I get lots of Belgian yeast, along with aromas of citrus, candi sugar and a little spice. This one is medium bodied, with some citrusy hops on the palate, along with a little spiciness, Belgian yeast and dark brown sugar. A noble experiment and a delicious beer."
"has a medium-plus bodied mouthfeel with about average carbonation. so-so drinkability: not bad, but personally i'll be set with the one bottle."
"drinkability is great. great balance, showing but a small portion of its alcoholic strength. a fine example of the style - american hops paired well against the base belgian yeast and malt. delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, feels a bit slick going down, some alcohol burn. Not bad, but has some strange character to it. Thanks Russ!"
"MF/D- Medium/Full body without being syrupy. Nice dryness. I know this is highly rated, but I wouldn't buy it again. Was expecting more from this. Again, in no way is this a bad beer, but I've had much better Belgian IPAs"
"D: For how freaky and demanding as this beer is, it's quite good. It definitely takes an open mind, and a little getting used to. Tasty though ... and that's all that matters."
"I recently saw Le Freak on tap at SideDoor in Corona Del Mar, but opted for New Belgium's Eric's Ale, and faced with the same choice, I'd probably do it again, but I'm a sucker for sour beers. Le Freak is a well orchestrated blend of an American IPA and Belgian Tripel. Hoppy and herbal on the IPA side, but sweet, spiced, with hints of dried fruit in the finish. One of the better style combinations I've had lately. Le Freak is aptly named, very classic belgian styling with a hoppy, American kick. If you're tired of the same ol' beers pick this one up, Green Flash doesn't disappoint."
"A wonderful beer well worth trying with great depth on the palate."
"Pours a clear amber, with the slightest haze I've ever seen. It's there if you really look. Beautiful soapy head that leaves tons o' lacing, and mildly carbonated. Aroma is crammed full of apricot, and some clean and crisp hop characteristics right underneath. Maybe some green apple, too. Flavor is very full and rich, carrying the apricot from the aroma, and melding smoothly into a great hop finish. Very nice and well balanced considering it's supposed to be hop forward. Nice round flavors in here, even something akin to butter. Smooth and delicious. Not the cheapest in the world at $6.49/bomber but very unique and pretty good. Worth tracking down."
"O: Cleaner and better than other BIPAs i've had, the yeast and hops don't clash but the don't work together, an in your face beer"
"BIPA's are clearly a style that is trying to find its definition. I am not sure I've found what that is for me (not even Piraat quite does it and Belgica is a bit light/simple). Hopefully though, the full-on pairing of west-coast hops with a phenolic tripel will be dialed back to something more refined."
"This beer is an interesting mix of flavors...hoppy enough to satisfy the heads, with a fair amount of Belgian yeast and even certain barleywine-esque notes. Not sure how many other beers would fit a new category, but this is a Belgian DIPA for sure. I'm very glad I got to try this and will look forward to cracking another one open when the opportunity presents itself."
"Poured a dark golden color into tulip glass. About a 1"" head with lots of bubbles. Smell of citrus off the glass. First taste of a Belgian trippel hits the tastebuds. The mouthfeel is a nice Belgian trippel taste then goes a little sweet on the backend. Good drinkability as the different styles of Belgian trippel and IPA mixes together. I can taste the two styles together. Very interesting."
"D: A good, drinkable, interesting beer--a nice marriage of the Belgian and American styles"
"This is a very bold belgian IPA. Hardy flavors from top to bottom and throughout the entire bottle. A fine pairing with Youth in Revolt considering Michael Cera is certainly a freak."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"Considering this is such an odd hybrid style and that it's 9.2%, this is a damn drinkable beer. It's got a nice Belgian floral bite to it, and a really good Belgian character with a little bit of funk, it combines for a very beer-geek-centric flavor profile that's really enjoyable. I think I paid $10 for this, and it's worth the price."
"D- Overall pretty good. Has the feel of a typical Tripel, but not with the sweet or heaviness."
"Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, full body and a dry finish."
"D: Definitely an interesting take on the triple. The hops add a nice, crisp character and go nicely with the spice and candied sugar. Not overtly sweet but enough to notice. Would recommend this beer"
"Lives up to its billing as a freakish Tripel-DIPA hybrid, though I would not classify it as a Belgian IPA. It's too big."
"Smell is of wood and alcohol. Taste is a powerful drying effect from hops that probably include Fuggle, along with stiff caramel malts and a bitter alcohol backbone. Body is medium to full, but the beer finishes dry. If you're a Fuggle and Northern Brewer fan, line up for a romp through the woods."
"D - Unusual and fun to drink."
"Drinkability, despite this ales high abv, is great given it wonderful balanced flavor."
"D: If you like bitter beers, you'll like this. It has everything an American IPA should have, plus some malts that you wouldn't get otherwise. This is kind of a beer lover's beer in that way. If you just wanted a mondo-bitter IPA, it doesn't fit the bill. Likewise, if you wanted a classic Tripel, you'll also be disappointed. Wanna try something new? You'll like this. 9%+ ABV makes it a bit hairy, though."
"I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't order it again."
"The pour resulted in a big, yellowish-tan head with outstanding retention. Color was a very cloudy deep-apricot. Nose had an odd yeast-driven earthiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a strong sourness, undoubtedly borne of the yeast that wormed its way through the liquid. Extreme? No doubt! IIPA and Trippel? I would not have guessed without cheating up. It was quite sour, especially on the finish. I did not feel that it was the sume of its parts, although mine was definitely the minority opinion on this occasion. I even thought it compared to a saison."
"A slow sipper, this one knocks your mouth out on first punch and keeps coming. Delicious, but I can't imagine drinking more than half a bomber."
"22 oz. bottle, served in a tulip glass. Pours a clear (prior to sediment) golden orange color with a good frothy off-white head, lacing throughout. Aroma is sweet, pale malts, orange, lemon, grass, and yeast. Flavor is caramel, orange, peppery yeast, and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, bitter that sticks around for a good while. Great one, I really enjoy this style."
"Overall, a pleasant take on the Belgian IPA. The Belgian yeast and the hops do not meld together as nicely as I'd like and at times this can seem like two seperate beers. Even with this, I found this enjoyable. Certainly worth the opportunity to try."
"D - Really great beer, but probably just want to have one considering the bitterness and abv"
"Huh. Weird beer, but I like it. Poured with a nice foamy frothy sudsy thick cream colored head that lasts and good lace. Color is a slightly hazy medium amber. Aroma is vineous yeast malt fresh baguettes and fresh hay. Flavor is like aroma but also uncludes good hop and some pale malt sweetness. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and also has a tinge of acid and is of some length. MMmmm, not a session; perhaps one or two."
"I think this could have a bit more carbonation, and the Belgian profile lends a bit of chewiness. The ABV limits the drinkability, but this is still a very nice beer."
"Deep golden with a slight amber tinge. Creates virtually no head. Honey sweetness with some allspice like spiciness. Very slight hop oiliness is also present in the aroma. I also get bananas as it warms. Very foamy on the first sip (without a carbonation bite). No noticeable sign of high ABV. Typical Belgian-style aromatic esters up front, but very muted and hard to determine any overriding characteristics. Very bitter back end without the pine or citrus from a West Coast IPA. IMO, a good example of combining two styles with results substantially below the sum of the parts."
"Pours a deep golden amber color with a large fluffy bubbly white head that sticks for a while. Smells of spicy hops, slight twinge of orange or tangerine with a spicy Belgian yeast character. Taste is sweet up front with a slight mineral edge followed by some spicy earthy hops finishing with a sweetness and that twang of Belgian yeasties. Moderate level of carbonation, sweet syrupy mouthfeel, medium body. Nice Americanized Belgian IPA. Taste leans more towards an IPA, but I'm good with that."
"D: Overall, I thought this was quite nice. I liked the big hop bitterness and more minor role played by the Belgian yeast. It was a touch sweet at times and I would be concerned that the beer wouldn't age well. As the hops die off, I think the sweetness would become increasingly unwelcome."
"A great balance between tripel and IPA. Not necessarily a beer that wowed me, or one that I'd hunt down again, but you can tell its well-made and it wouldn't be a bad world if all beers were like this."
"The IPA hoppiness added a really interesting flavour to the typical Belgian style. It's both calm and slightly syrupy, and a little carbonated at the same time. I really like this beer, and think it would go well with any meal - it would match a nice dinner just as well as an outdoor picnic."
"pint at Galaxy Hut, Arlington"
"D-too bitter for me so I probably wouldn't have it again, but if that is your thing you would probably like this one a lot"
"D - It comes across as a bit heavier than I would like, but that could be the malt-forward aspect. It certainly hides the 9.2% ABV."
"D - If this beer were not 9.2% this would be one of the most drinkable beers around. This beer is an absolute gem in the ""hybrid"" style of Belgian IPA's. Many breweries try but there are only a few that have managed to meld the 2 styles together as flawlessly as Green Flash has done on this one. FIND THIS BEER!!"
"This beer tastes and feels much more like a DIPA than an Belgian IPA. Very hop forward with lots of earthy pine and citrus fruit notes. Hints of grapefruit, mango and pineapple with a decent malt back bone that provides nice balance. Very bitter throughout with a slight alcohol warmth and bone dry finish."
"So this is how you do this style. I loved it. In a tulip, it was a gold color, maybe a bit on the orange side. Thick white head with copious lace. Aroma of an IPA and a tripel. Floral and citrus combining with sugar and yeast. Same thing with the taste. Mostly grapefruit, a little pine, with cotton candy and yeast. A balanced combination. Would drink this one anytime."
"D- A great once in a while Beer, I couldn't have it everyday but once in a while it would be perfect, very nice with indian food."
"D: Out of this and Piraat, the only two Belgium IPA's I've tried, I like Piraat better. This is a fairly drinkable beer, it's just a tad syrupy and medicinal for my tastes. Probably won't buy again."
"Beer is oddly spicy, bittering in back with kind of a sharp bite to the whole thing. Overall, the bitterness and the citrus just don't quite work together, definitely not doing it for me. It just seems off."
"Eh. I thought this was going to be a unique beverage. Instead it's just a grassy, boozy DIPA. Oh well, not for me."
" Such a great flavor combination. I will definitely be having this one again!"
"Not bad at all. Though this is more of a one and done for me. This tries to be a Tripple and a Belgian IPA. It comes up short on both ends. There are much better examples of both."
"A costly bottle. Worth checking out at least once though. But definitely not the best San Diego area belgian ipa."
"Verdict: Le Freak could break either way: bitter and pithy Tripel or Belgian-infused San Diego IPA. It's pleasant enough, and certainly lives up to the promised mix of San Diego and Belgium, though it doesn't quite strike the note I was hoping for. I like the concept and most of the flavors, but the hops are just a little too medicinal for me."
"D- Very interesting. I can't remember the last time I had a beer with such a deep flavor profile. Every sip was a different transition from sweet to bitter. I liked it and I could easily drink more than one, but I don't think I will buy it again because of the $8 price tag."
"pleasantly surprised by this one. perhaps a little too much going on, almost muddled instead of complex, but in the end stays together decently enough, as an expression of some of the best of both worlds. might get a little ahead of itself in terms of boldness, and thus being categorized alongside the likes of chouffe and de ranke doesn't do it any favors, unfortunately."
"Probably not one i'll be reaching for again, with many better examples out there."
"Overall, a great beer. very complex and different."
"Pours hazy and dark golden in color. Thick, fluffy head with great retention and lacing in the tulip glass. Smell was of a hoppy belgian beer to point out the obvious. A nice hop kick to it along with some sweet sugar, ripe fruit (banana stood out to me), and yeast. Taste was great. Starts out slightly sweet with some fruit (very hefe like almost) with a nice dry, bitter hop presence on the back of your tongue as it goes down. Slightly oily, a little chewy but not too thick on the mouthfeel. Overall a really nice beer and probably my favorite of this particular style."
"Overall if you want a good BIPA make sure it is a ""B" IPA if you get what I mean."
"D - A bit off-balance perhaps, but Green Flash is a good operation, so it is still on a fairly high level."
"D- This things amazing. The alcohol reduces the drinkability a bit though."
"This is a good belgian example with a very complex feel, threw me off a few times. worthy."
"hophead or anything."
"Not bad, not as complex as some other Belgian IPAs. Alcohol is a little unwieldy, but I'd still have another."
"Flavor has a slight bite at first, on the back of the tongue...followed by a sweet grapefruit body...with good carbonation, and ends a little dry and hoppy. You can taste the Belgian aspect/yeast in the middle body. Picking up a slight apple as well. Beer resembles a Belgian Tripel mixed with a DIPA. Pretty tasty!"
"To start off, an interesting tasting beer. A interesting tasting beer. Clear amber body, quick dissipation, nice spider legs. Nose is a bit spicy for a tripel, orange peel and cardamon rounded off by hops. Taste mirrors the nose with the hops being even more prominent than the nose. Some effervesce in the mouthfeel, fairly dry tripel like finish. Pretty drinkable, not too heavy. May have been a bit heavy on the tripel characteristics for the style, but overall quite tasty. Worth a try."
"D: I wouldn't think that you could do more than a couple of these in an evening, but I'm finding myself sipping it with regularity. I'm sure I'll slow down at some point though..."
"Familiar flavors within the style, done pretty well. American aggression mixed into Belgian ideals. I can dig it."
"A definite improvement on other Green Flash IPA styles I've had."
"Very good beer, one I hope to see around the Midwest more. I wouldn't quite refer to it as freaky as the name implies, but this is a bit unusual, and welcome in its distinct style and flavor."
"D - I'm a beer, and Le Freak was my idea. I wish... this is great, very enjoyable, imaginative, and brewed with skill. This one should nearly be a sipper, but goes down almost too easy..."
"I would also like to note that this style is different in that nearly every beer I try in this style tastes completely different and had it's own unique qualities to it, more then I can say for most mainstream styles. Great iteration of an awesome style."
"D - Drinks good for 9.2%. Would have liked to get more hop flavor in here, but oh well."
"Balance and lack of astringency make this beer a nice sipper. The 0.5 deduction in drinkability was due to the high carbonation. Otherwise this was spot on."
"Overall, a decent beer that you're just going to have to judge for yourself."
"Drinkability: Great sipping brew. I can drink a bomber but that's it. Its meant to be sat with and enjoyed. This is a great example of the style. One of the best being made in America that I've had so far."
"Pours an almost clear pale ornage color with a two finger white head that was quite lasting,leaving some good lace. Nothing really screams tripel to me when I smell this brew. It's all American hops, and lots of them, plenty of citrus and pine, an underlying sweetness, like candied fruit. Taste has more of the Belgian yeast flavor at first, lightly sweet, turns sappy and bitter on the finish. Surprisingly, the aroma made this seem like it was a hop bomb, but there's more bitterness than actual hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium, surprisingly low carbonation considering the massive head it started with. Nice rings of lace are circling glass as I finish it off. Good brew, but the bitterness of beers like these starts to wear on me these days, and the alcohol is a tad too warming. I enjoyed this one bomber though."
"- Super good Belgian brew. The yeast writes the story with this one. If you are a newb to Belgians... grab this one up... enjoy its clean and fresh ingredients... and absorb its Belgian nature. There you have it... a fantastic introductory brew to Belgians. Americanized."
"D: This is not one of my favorites, but I would try it again because I have a feeling my sample was none too fresh."
"d - delicious belgian ipa but not quite as good as stone cali-belgique."
"Pours cloudy golden in body with frothy head that sticks around. Hop aroma with slight spice, sugars, resin, and citrus. Flavors of citrus, resin, sugars, west coast hop tastes, and sour notes. Medium-heavy bodied brew with thick flavors. A treat to have and a great mix of styles. Two thumbs up for Green Flash."
"Overall, I would say they almost pulled off this marriage of styles, and I definitely appreciate the attempt and would drink again."
"Notes: A bit sweet for my liking, it leans on some US trippels that while likable for me are not a big match for the style. Here it plays nicely with the hoppy profile, although I think I lean towards Belgium IPAs that explore a crisper and a touch funky profile."
"taste is smooth, bread dough, some caramel, malt, hops in the back, and some fruit, ends thick and a tad bitter."
"D - bottle says its a derivative of a Belgian IPA and Triple, but the Triple qualities are few and far between (maybe just a touch of clove in the aftertaste). little bit of an abrasive Belgian IPA at that, needed something else to balance that just doesnt show up. not a bad brew by any means...just falls short of being anything more than ""good""."
"Fruity, yeasty and bitter with some spice. I felt like the hops punched through but are covered in syrup so they play nicely with the belgium half of this brew but unfortunatly are striped to the point of only imparting bitterness, which dominates the aftertaste. A very interesting beer but not my favorite example of the style."
"A Belgian IPA, or a hop infused Belgian Tripel. Whichever you like. For such a strong beer, this one drinks pretty easy. The very astringent, almost caustic hops of the Green Flash IPA juxtaposed against a rich Belgian golden malt, sweet with big apricot fruit. The balance is good. Finish is dry, and almost all hops, though the late-mid palette carries a lot of the malt flavors."
"Drinkability- yum!"
"M/D: Medium bodied, heavier than I expected, prickly carbonation. This one is a sipper, it's just so in your face in terms of hops and yeast character. Very well done."
"Poured a clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate complex citrus hoppy aroma with a alcohol tone. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium bitter and small alcohol bite finish of moderate duration. This is a good beer."
"Medium body with a good amount of carbonation, adding to the belgian feel. Some alcohol is felt. Pretty nice beer here."
"All in all, a tasty beer that I would be glad to enjoy pretty much any time. Easy drinking for any self-respecting hophead, with plenty of crossover appeal for those who love saisons and other Belgian blondes."
"Drinkability: this beer is very powerful and a pleasure to try"
"Good beer overall. just had great lacing and IPA flavor, the Belgian just wasnt a good mix. but I am sure some one out there would love it. just no for me."
"This one looks like a double ipa, smells like a mess and tastes like alcohol."
"Pours orangish-yellow with a white head. The aroma is very fruity, with a big Belgian yeast component. Smells very similar to a Belgian tripel. The flavor is fruity with some hop bitterness as well as a strong Belgian yeast character. Medium mouthfeel."
"That said, this isn't bad. Nice heavy duty west coast hop profile with plenty of grapefruit rind bitterness. Lots of clove and banana."
"D: Very good. An interesting combination that works well: light, but flavorful, with a user-friendly sourness. I served this with a Provençal-style omelette and it paired very well."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, making this a quite drinkable beer."
"Otherwise, a terrific stab at the hybrid style, tasty!"
"Overall a BIPA that leans heavily toward the Belgian side."
"I really liked Le Freak, in case you couldn't tell. More breweries should attempt marriages of two styles like this. The DIPA is a good DIPA, the Golden a good Golden, and together they make something not only delicious, but memorable. Send more Jared!"
"I am really liking this Belgian IPA style and this is a great example . The hop notes are west coast big and piney but the Belgian flavours really anchor the beer. I noticed that it seemed a little confused in focus in the first couple sips but soon the hops came to the front and the beer truly tasted like an IPA from Belgian. This is a big beer and a sipper but very drinkable ( much like the DIPA from Green Flash). Cool beer"
"palate is a little too fried and abv is a little too high for me to want another. or even for me to be excited about finishing the bomber. (oh don't worry, i finished it. i was just looking forward to moving on to something else.)"
"I've had their IPA & their Trippel ... both very good brews, but this combination is where it's at."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strong bite of carbonation, very nice."
"D: Surprisingly good considering the abv. We likey!"
"D - Not super hard to drink, but would be hard to session these."
"What a great beer. Complexity and flavour of a trippel with the power and balancing bitterness of a 2IPA. Really good. Did start to get a bit 'chewy' toward the end, but didn't leave my mouth feeling quite as osmotically shocked as many other trippels. Must look out for more of these hybrid styles."
"D- i really liked this one. it was a great blend of two very contrasting styles. too potent to attempt a second one, but the bottle i had went down in a hurry. check this one out oif youre a fan of the style."
"More California than Belgium. Very SD hops. Not entirely on style, but strays in a direction I like."
"Bottle sample courtesy of my friend Adil- A deep hazed golden pour, topped with a frothy and rocky white cap. Intense nose of fresh hops with spices, flowers, citrus, yeast. Tastes sweet and of candy, tropical fruit,pear, and has a massive hop flavour of pine and citrus. A bit of a yeasty funk lingers towards a very lengthy and bitter finish. Very good!"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a dark gold color with a tinge of orange and has a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, cloves, and some tropical fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pine and citrusy hops, peppery spice, Belgian yeast and a bit of tropical fruit and cloves. Also has a good bitter hoppy finish. The taste does start off very hoppy, but it does balance out as the fruit flavor shows up more as the beer warms. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit dry and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, the alcohol is well hidden and it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a good overall brew, I enjoyed it."
"D: ABV is pretty damn high for an IPA, even a Belgian. Tasty and interesting, though."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice stronger beer with some complexity that makes it worth drinking for a long time."
"22oz. bomber served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a brilliant clear gold with a thin white head. Bottle conditioned. Lots of piney hops in the aroma. Medium bodied with a solid malt base. Alcohol is well hidden. Pretty drinkable for the ABV. The Belgian spice is there along with a load of hop bitterness in the finish. Not quite sure if I like this one, but it is an interesting mix of two brewing styles."
"D=very enjoyable and a great change of pace, though these hybrids arent usually my favorite."
"Very good mouthfeel and little alcohol taste with such a high abv."
"had this beer an many occasions i feel it fits the description perfectly IMO it tastes and feels like a tripel that has been hopped to hell and its delicious golden orange color the smell is spiced and the big west coast IPA hop smell and the taste is spot on to the smell the carbonation is spot on and the drinkability great for being upwards of 9% this beer is great for its style is recommend it to any one"
"Very, very nice orange/amber color with a decent head that receedes all too rapidly. Muted aroma-I think any Belgian notes overshadow the hops. Only slightly floral, somewhat earthy. Great flavor! Big ole blast of hops set against the malt and ""sulfuryness"" of a triple. Lingering bitterness. somewhat metallic ring to it. Sort of slick and oily. Finish is somewhat dry. Very nice body-very full. I find I almost want to gulp this-the great flavor and body rolled into one make this a very, very drinkable beer. Quite enjoyable."
"all in all, a pretty enjoyable beer. really complex and unique and done better than the version brewed by stone. i just don't get the tripel in this."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich amber color with about two fingers of dense off white foam. The head leaves a minimal lacing on my glass. Nose and flavor are of herbal, woody earthy hops, some citrus such as lemon and orange, spices such as coriander, hints of caramel, yeast. A notch or two better than medium in body with ample carbonation. Pretty tasty stuff."
"D: This beer is an easy sipper with a complex flavor profile and demonstrates a rather unique styling, but for all its frills, does not take my breath away like some others in this style have done in the past, though it is nice to be reintroduced to the style after such a prolonged absence."
"D: Definitely a challenge to the palate, but an enjoyable one."
"Tastes much like it smells, which is a good thing. Toasted malts and mineral-y bitterness up front, briefly. Big, yeasty, sweet wheat bread and hay malts follow. Flashes of fruit as well. Soon, big numbing hops take over. Minty, peppery, resinous, and piny. Some sweetish, soft, fruity (banana) malt reemerges in the finish. Slightly warming. Full-bodied, with a thick feel. Delicious."
"Drinkability: More of an imperial IPA without the American malt taste. This combines two of my favorite beer styles, however I would of liked to see more spicey clove notes from the yeast and the trademark sweetness of Belgian candy sugar. That would make this beer fully complete I'd say. Otherwise a fantastic and interesting idea, a beer to respect in more ways then one as the 9.2% ABV is enough to get you goofy."
"Drinkability - This is actually quite an easy-drinking ale. Again, at the risk of sounding repetitive, the balance makes this a fabulous offering. The various flavors work in perfect harmony and produce a big, giant beer with what could easily be competing flavors but that work incredibly well together and go down like nobody's business. Grean Flash pulled off a miracle with this effort - it is a unique beer that speaks to the boldness and creativity of the brewmasters. Well done!"
"On tap at 1702 in Tucson. Pours a hazy golden colour, with thin strings of lace along the side of the glass. This is a pretty classic belgian style tripel infused with hops. I've had a few 'belgian IPAs' and normally the hops dominate, but this is an example of one that is still mostly belgian. It is sweet and yeasty up front, with a nice hoppy and dry finish to it. Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"Since Belgian IPA is such a broad category- basically meaning any Belgian style to which lots of hops are added- more specifically this beer is a highly hopped tripel, and man, there are indeed a lot of hops here. Very much a beer to have fresh. Pours a very hazy golden, edging toward orange. Looks almost like a hefeweizen, except for the head which is very finely beaded, pure white, pretty thin, but leaves some okay lacing. Smells extremely herbal from the hops- there is almost a thyme-like aroma to start, followed by more herbal notes and some late tripel swweetness almost obscured by the hops. Tastes marvelous! More of that herbal forwardness, also with thyme notes, married well to the Belgian tripel notes with some sweetness and clove and coriander spice notes with a long tangy finish. Firm and crisp in the mouth. Really one of the best Belgian style tripels I've had."
"the flavor holds a good bit of hop dynamics. sticky and bitter, but with plenty of herbal, citrus notes. some bright fruit. it's sweet but this element is not allowed to overstep its bounds, as the solid bitterness buffers any such possibility. some spice going on--coriander? boozy heat rounds out the flavor profile and, ultimately, this is a complexly flavored brew. it's thick and lingers on the tongue, as well, so as to heighten/sustain my experience"
"The brewers at Green Flash Brewing Company have really out done themselves with this convergence of beer styles where American Imperial IPA meets Belgium trippel. The end result is a zesty brew with enticing American hops and Belgian yeast aromatics that lead you to delicious malts and a complex layering of hop flavors that quench and refresh your pallet. When you pour it you notice its orangish amber color with a huge amount of American hops on the nose with notes of citrus. The palate itself feels heavy at first but then leaves you with a silky smooth mouth full of yeast and hops beautifully layered with fruity flavors of banana and grapefruit."
"A great job blending both styles, which complement one another nicely here. Both drinkable and enjoyable!"
"On tap at The Trappist in Oakland. Pours cloudy, white head. Looks like a saison or witt. The aroma is great. Lots of fruity spicy yeast character that mixes well with the citrus hops used. The flavor is ""balanced"" for an IPA with Belgian yeast. The buttering hops are relatively subdued that make this beermuch more drinkable than others I have had. I was not previously a fan of this type of beer, but le freak changed my mind. Worth a quaff."
"This beer poured a clear dark tan color and formed a foamy off white head that left latticed lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, and Belgian yeast and candy elements. The flavor was of malt, hops, pepper, and slight butter undertone. The body was medium light, creamy and the finish was peppery."
"If you love IPAs, and you love Tripels, this is a no-brainer - a nice representation of both with great flavor and appropriate mouthfeel to represent each. Serve it up... Immediately!"
"All in all, not an everyday drinker. Not sure If I'd ever get this one again. Flavors are intense but a bit confusing. It pulls in a bunch of directions without picking one and sticking to it. Which is what they were going for... It does taste like a DIPA trippel... whatever that is."
"22 oz. brown bottle no freshness date on the label pours a dark hazy yellow orange thick two finger white head that held very well big patches of lace to the finish and a ring of sediment at the bottom. fruity citrus aromas come through fairly strong. bready grainy dry taste with citrus notes sharp needle like carbonation and medium, warming mouthfeel 9.20 abv limits drinkability."
"Love this beer, I purchased a couple of bombers and will enjoy these I'm shure."
"D- Its drinkable and the 9.2% is very well hidden. Medium high carbonation and lots of spice keeps this one interesting but its not for me."
"D- Excellent beer that combines two popular styles without junking up the mix with too many added flavors."
"drinkability: ok"
"22oz bottle received in a BIF. Poured into a tulip glass. Orange in color, big frothy head, very active carbonation. Smells more like an IPA than a Tripel. Citrus fruit, bready, some clove like spice also. Alcohol up front in the taste, citrus. The tripel blend of this comes out more as it warms. The clove flavor really comes through in the taste as it warms."
"Unique beer, you will like it or you will hate it. I can't see anybody not having a strong opinion on this one."
"poured into a tulip, without the yeast this is a bright clear golden orange, with a really nice, thick, creamy white head and lacing that lasts. lots of yeast sediment in the bottom of the clouds up the second pour quite a bit. tropical fruit, belgian spicy yeast in the nose along with some citrus and honeyed bread notes. taste starts off like a tripel, round and doughy, spicy sweet, and finishes like an ipa. medium bodied and a really nice level of carbonation leads to a prickly and frothy mouthfeel. with the yeast, mouthfeel is more chewy. long, big smooth bitter, drying, finish. a complex sipper."
"I am always looking out for Belgian IPAs to try. Fell in love with Urthel's, but this one didn't disappoint. Hope to look for more from these guys soon."
"Drinkability is a good. This is a very nice Belgian IPA. I drank this on draft in San Diego a couple of months ago, and it was fantastic. This bottle doesn't quite stack up to the draft version, (what does?) but this is a still a fine beer that I would recommend trying."
"D - This hybrid brew presents the best of both worlds: complex Belgian hop characteristics, only amped up to west coast levels. Good stuff!"
"The body is moderate and a bit big for style. Would have liked to see it finish a bit drier. Overall a good Belgian IPA but limited Belgian quality really deters."
"D= This was a good but not great beer. I wish the IPA qualities were slightly more in-check and the ""Belgian"" qualities were turned up just a bit more, but it was enjoyable all the same."
"Drinkability: this one is very drinkable - I felt that it's a sipper - I wanted to savor this beer moreso than drink it because I liked it so much. I wish we got Green Flash in Charleston - then I could enjoy this beer on a regular basis. Great fusion - I recommend for the beer drinker/geek who appreciates both styles. Very cool!"
"My sister picked up a 22 ounce bottle of this for me from Bruisin' Ales in Asheville, NC. Popped it open tonight and poured it into a British pint glass. Color is an opaque orange that produces little head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Alcohol, citrus and sweet candy in the nose. Taste is slightly alcoholic, with orange and citrus undertones. Very hoppy with a decent malt backbone up front but finishes relatively bitter. Good amount of carbonation in the mouth. Very interesting beer - the unique taste and the high ABV make it hard to drink more than one."
"One of my favorite beers is Houblon Chouffe Tripel, Double IPA. Le Freak should be right up my alley. From the first pour it is a cloudy orange with a nice rocky looking head. Pretty nice lacing is left along with some little Islands of foam. Others write about pineapple and other specific fruits...I smell fruit...and sweetness, (can you smell swetness?), and Belgian...Belgium...a tripel maybe. I don't smell hops. Others have written that Le Freak is like an American Dbl. IPA made with a Belgian yeast. I disagree. I think that it is a good blend of two distinct styles. For me it is like a tripel that is hopped very agressively (DUH). But, unlike a Dbl. IPA the aroma is very Belgian (yeast and fruit), and the sweetness doesn't seem to be purely malt driven...candy sugar. I am enjoying Le Freak, but...no, no buts...but, but, I am a bit confused. Le Freak is a Cali Double IPA/Belgian Trippel ""Extreme ale converging San Diego-style imperial pale and Belgian-style trippel"". I get the Belgian Trippel, but the imperial pale ale, though not lost on me, seems subdued. Don't get me wrong, there is considerable hop bitternes...lingering bitterness, but no hop aroma or flavor. Finally, Le Freak is quite drinkable. I like the roundness of the mouthefeel with the subtle sparkle of carbonation."
"D- Damn exquisite and damn smooth. The artwork on the label confuses the sh*t out of me but I have a great time drinking the contents."
"D - This is a very tasty brew. I'd like to try many more brews from Green Flash."
"Creamy and fizzy on the palate. Burns on the way down. A big, fiery concoction. One glass is about all I can handle."
"This is a truly wonderful beer. I have been burned out on IPAs and this has made the difference. A great combination of two worlds. I had the Stone Cali-Belgian but this beats it hands down. I can't recommend it enough."
"Wasn't sure what to expect from a hybrid IPA / Belgian style beer but the end result is absolutely delicious. Lots going on but still manages to be relatively subtle and very easy to drink."
"When cracking the crown on a bomber of Le Freak, don't expect a freakishly delicious Belgian IPA. This is, however, a worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes both American hops and Belgian yeast. It helps if you like big beer enough to forgive some of its excesses."
"Drinkability: A real tug of war on the palate, and that ultimately limits its drinkability; I liked it, at first, but then struggled with it the more I had"
"Thanks For Reading"
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Pear nose. Flavor is sweet and sour pear and grapefruit. Not bad but not a Belgian trippel. High ABV is hidden. $9.95 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry citrusy hops. Taste is also dominated by dry citrusy hops with a lightly sweet malt body. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no sign of alcohol. Very well done with great balanced between hoppy notes and malt; some more fruity ester would have brought this to another level."
"Powdery mouthfeel with bitter alcohol fusals. Some serious gerianol and indole going on in here, strong floral geranium, jasmine, and slightly skunky. It's complex, with good unique characteristics, so it's getting points for that. The abv is higher than I would like, the 22 is gonig to be shared with friends, or i'll get bored (and drunk) with it."
"At 9.2 ABV, this is a real sleeper! Grapefruit resins do a great job of taming alcohol content."
"Overall a solid beer. Glad I tried it."
"Full, rich body. Smooth drinker. Appropriate level of carbonation. Crisp. Dry pine finish. Very interesting, and very tasty."
"A must try."
"Poured a nice golden color with a nice white head. Nose is hoppy, citrusy, floral. Taste was great from beginning to endwith citrusy hops up front, sweetness in the end. ABV was well hidden and this beer is so easily drinkable its no even funny. Best Belgian IPA I have had to date."
"D- This beer is a bit like the husky kid at his first school dance. Some parts are really good but the big dandelion bitterness steps on everyone's toes and there isn't that much depth or complexity noticed."
"Drinkability is good, but not great simply because this is a strange beer. Still, I am *really* glad I picked this one up. I'd definitely grab it again given the chance."
"Much love to WasTrikenSie for this one ! A great beer."
"Poured into a tulip, pours a clear golden orange with a big fluffy rocky head with great retention. The smell is so unique, much more so than any other Belgian style IPA i've had. The yeast phenols explode out of the glass but don't contribute a huge earthiness or funk, it more combines with the abundant hop aroma to produce something really unique, that I don't even know if I have a descriptor for. Sometimes I feel like I smell orange, sometimes there just seems to be hints of banana and other yeast products. The taste is just the same. Citrusy at times, yeasty at others, sometimes both. Just an excellent beer that I really enjoy more than the Houblon Chouffe Doublon to be honest."
"The body is good, the finish dry and the carbonation low"
"Poured into my Rochefort chalice, beer forms a 2 finger white head that dissipates quickly. Apple juice golden in color with some lacing, beer looks enticing. Nose is yeasty with notes of banana, clove, hops, and pine trees. Hops are mellowed well on the forefront by the malt but the hops kick in big time in the finish and linger in mouth for a while. Taste like a Tripel until the finish when it transforms into a strong IPA. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy, very nice. I appreciated the uniqueness of this ""combo"" styled beer. I typically don't enjoy Tripels or IPAs too much but thought this one was pretty good."
"Overall I would definitely drink this one again. Very solid and very much a nice beer, that drinks much lower then its ABV would suggest."
"This is a nice beer. I'm not a tripel fan per se, but this is very good. The rather large bottle was easy to finish, and the abv was not noticeable."
"D - love this combination, Green Flash did a great job accentuating the distinct flavors of the two types of beer while at the same time allowing them to complement each other"
"I like it."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for the high ABV."
"A very nice hoppy hybrid."
"I'm passing on this one, a one and done beer."
"Mouthfeel: Body is a little fuller than I would have expected for a tripel, but in line with an IIPA. Impacts the drinkability some, along with some hot alcohols, but a good bottle to split with someone."
"A great American take on the Belgian IPA - up there with Houblon Chouffe."
"Drinkability: I have had this beer on cask and in a bottle. Let me tell you that any version of this beer is delicious. While the aroma was hooked on the citrus and exotic fruits, the taste was concentrating on the bitter citrus hops. ""La Freak"" is Freakishly delicious! One bottle of this fine beer will not last long. If you can find it, good for you! Hope you enjoy it!"
"Very nice combination of styles here. Scent brings plenty of fruity notes and spices that I can't quite place. Very hoppy yet biscuity with a dry finish. Moderately carbonated and not too over the top on alcohol makes for an easy to drink, very tasty Le Freak."
"A touch thin but I really dig the hop bitterness. Finishes stark dry and completely pallate cleansing. Quite refreshing. I should have bought more of these. I really liked this one. Certainly any hophead would love this as well."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a great drinkability."
"Definitely a different take on your standard hopped up brew. Pours a dark copper and being unfiltered there is plenty of goodness at the bottom of the bottle. The flavor of hops is not lost amongst the smoothness of the trippel. Goes down extremely smooth, does not taste like a >9% abv beer. All of the beers that I have had from Green Flash have been well done."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little on the chewy side. The hop resins coat the mouth. Excellent carbonation and very easy drinking. The alcohol does provide a nice warming but is not too overpowering. Could be dangerous at 9%+."
"D - The alcohol is over the top but I can see swirling this down with hop heads on a warm, sunny deck somewhere. This might work with mussels."
"What a massive interpretation of a Belgian IPA. The spicing, hopping, and warming alcohol are almost over the top. A real sipper."
"Taste: Pepper, Lemon, Bread, and Apples. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Nice dry bitterness."
"The aroma is very hoppy with citrus and grass. It's also got fruit and malt. The appearance is hazy gold with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma and rather bitter. The palate is thin but smooth. Overall it's decent but a little to astringent."
"noticing some yeast sediment swirling up from the bottom of the bottle - smells nice, good hop aroma - tastes real good - quite complex, none of it off-putting - better on the 2nd glass, as it had warmed a bit, also more bready notes(due to more yeast content towards the bottom?) - very enjoyable - i got a good buzz off this - le freak!"
"D: I sure liked this beer; like the label implied, trippel-meets-IPA. Its flavors and complexity seemed to ahnge with every swallow. The abv keeps it from being a sessionable - it turned me into a uni-bomber."
"Great beer, and now that I think about it, my first ""Belgian IPA."" I will definitely be seeking out more of this style, and this will be the bad boy that started me on them."
"Just what I would want in a Belgian IPA. A break from the easily accessible San Diego hop bombs."
"Remember Rick James? This beer is a Super Freak, Super Freak, its Super Freaky...awwww. I love it."
"Drinkability: From what I heard before I tried this, it's a love it or hate it beer, and it seems that for most folks it's the former. And I'm certainly also in that camp. The biggest detractor is the $9-ish price tag, which just seems a bit outrageous. Take it down to the $7 range and we'll see, but Green Flash -- unlike someone like Lagunitas -- always has their prices high, so I suppose you have to expect it. But man, what a wild beer, and a style that I hope continues to catch on."
" Body is robust and creamy, but with a mild chalky streak that is a little offputting. Still, on the whole, the body is a good balance between the thick, syrupy backbone of a double IPA and the creamy carbonation of a tripel. A good effort on Green Flash's part, but there are still a few flawed elements."
"D: The piney hoppiness of this one turns me off a little bit. It makes it a bit more harsh than others I have had of the style."
"D - One of the hoppier Belgian IPA's I have had. Very good but the flavors seem to be in contrast at times."
"M + D: Full flavoured, and full bodied to go along with that. Not TOO heavy, though... it's on the richer side of medium, really. Moderate, but assertive carbonation does it justice, and makes for a very enjoyable beer. This is an impressive beer, I'd certainly recommend trying it out. Green Flash has done a terrific job with this, and I'll most definitely be getting some more in the near future!"
"This beer is kind of all over the place, and sometimes in the wrong places. This is an OK tasting beer, although not really for me. I have yet to taste a better Belgian IPA than the one Furthermore Brewing makes. That being said, I would drink this again if I saw it on tap somewhere. Cheers."
"D: Dangerously high, the trippel aspect of it really hides the alcohol. Very interesting beer. Highly recommended. One of my new favorites. Excellent beer."
"I'd have another right now!"
"Overall, an incredible beer! Just great complexity, and great balance; all these flavors work together so nicely. This style is such an interesting concept to me, and i with the others i have tried this one stick above the rest."
"Strong pine and pepper with lots of bittering hop. The alcohol is strong. The malt flavors is subtle...unlike most Belgian style ales, this is mostly hoppy. The body is what I'd expect of this style; the carbonation is appropriate."
"A fantastic Belgian IPA, I like it quite a bit. I wish came around these parts more frequently - maybe now that its popped up at RFD that means it will."
"So unique. So drinkable. So good. A must try."
"D: Another? Yes please."
"Poured into a large Val-Dieu chalice, this beer is a slightly hazy honey-gold color. A small head forms on top, and disappears quickly. The nose is luscious, with wonderful citrus hoppiness and spicy, fruity undertone of fresh pears. The taste is dominated up front by a grapefruity hops, and a high, drying bitterness. If you look for it, you can find a lot of underlying sweetness, and a fair amount of fruity flavor like a good Belgian golden. Good carbonation level, and the beer isn't too heavy. A nice effort."
"I couldn't wait to try this one. Double IPAs and Belgian Tripels are two of my favorite styles--how could a top-notch brewery like Green Flash go wrong? They certainly didn't. Le Freak is delicious and a bit elusive. It's a tough one to fathom, and for that reason I wouldn't rate the drinkability higher than I have. Maybe my mere human tongue and brain aren't sufficiently equipped to process this new style--I look forward to acquiring more in the future to try and tackle its mysteries."
"I love this hybrid beer!"
"clouded haze of yellow straw with a white head that holds around a bit and leaves a little lace. not amazing, not bad. a lot has already been said about this beer, so iwill say this: it really changes as it warms up, and i found the best way to pour it was a bit at a time into several glasses. balanced? in a wierd way it was. the sweetness and the clove/corriander were mellowed by the hops and vice versa. i love san diego ipas, especially green flash, and i'm a big belgian beer fan as well. that being said, this one didnt' do it for me quite like stone's cali-belgique, but it was a very pleasant beer, and i was glad to have sought one out. let's retire this one now and move on."
"Not really freaking out here."
"Overall, this is a very good example of this style. If you like belgians and IPAs, this one is for you. This beer tastes like those two styles had a baby."
"Pours a cloudy amber yellow colored body, with an average but quickly diminishing white. Pretty good lacing. Very bitter hoppy aroma. Also sweet and flowery. A lot of sweet spiciness. Soft palate, spicy taste. Some light floralness. Some bitterness too, but not very hoppy tasting. A little sourness. Definitely tastes like a weak cross between an IPA and a Belgian. Alcoholy as it warms up more."
"Drinkability - Becomes too sweet towards the end. One of these is plenty."
"This is a decent example of the style. I wish there was more hop aroma, but the bitterness and hop flavor that mixes with the phenols of the yeast is nice."
"Pretty drinkable."
"Big thick rocky head. Color is a bit darker than a normal trippel. On the nose the belgian yeast and sugar dominate (practically screams trippel), hops light in the background. Taste is satisfyingly bitter. The hops really take over in the body. Otherwise, coriander and spiciness round out the flavor. And don't forget citrus abound. Carbonation is on point for the style. It's quite easy to drink. I will definately have more of these in the future."
"Generous two-finger plus head of uneven white foam that takes a good long time to dissolve and leaves a sticky lacing behind. Zinc orange to copper in color, warm hazy glow to it, draws you in. The mandarin orange and pink grapefruit citrus evident in the nose, avoids excessive sweetness and sourness, flowers and coriander spice add depth, same for the pear, apricot, guava fruit scents, hoppy in a gentle grain-driven fashion, not too bready nor toasty. Full-bodied, pushes into the mouth but ceases the aggression thereafter. The clove, anise, coriander spice beats the white grapefruit, orange citrus out of the starting gate. The carbonation stays at the right level to allow it to retain weight and chewiness, also allowing for clarity and separation of the flavors. The semi-tropical feel of guava, mango, apricot, pear fruit continues, with a glazed or dried fruit character. Momentary pinch of white pepper and salt, however, this only serves as entry to the herbal hops past the mid-palate. Tries hard to achieve a lot, thus don't see this as a beer to ""relax"" with."
"D: A bit of a chore to drink this much of it, even over the course of a couple of hours. I don't need to have it again, so I won't be buying it. An interesting creation, but not on the frequent flier list."
"Would love to try this on tap and another impressive offering from GF."
"Very good melange of West COast IPA and Belgian. Aroma is hoppy, and complex. Taste is above average mouthfeel, almost full mouthfeel. Taste is satisfying: Controlled hoppiness, with yeast notes. A bit ore to sweet side, not too bitter. Nice small white head."
"A very nice Belgian IPA, not quite up to Urthel or Houblon Chouffe but damn good."
"Cloudy orange colored ale with a very slow fading head.Aroma is hoppy and citrusy.Taste starts off hoppy and citrusy then changes to more warming belgian ale flavors.Very sweet and enjoyable.I would recommend for someone to try this ale at least once!!"
"D - Not to bad but wish it was more subtle and balanced"
"This was a nice west coast Belgian IPA, exactly what you would expect from Green Flash. Easily quaffable for a high abv. I had to remind myself to slow down."
"Well done Green Flash."
"Pours a lively orange with amber undertones. A nice, thick, stark white head bellows up and then clings to the walls while falling to a slick. Smell is full of earthy citrus hop, orange zest, pine apple, a bit of tropical / mango comes through. Aroma is balanced with a nice, cakey malt with hints of spicy yeast. Taste is very nice. Assertive bitterness full of earthy, citrus hops reminiscent of biting into an orange with some rind left on it. Hints of a belgian strong golden ale lie underneath... shortbread like malt flavors with white pepper and ginger spiceyness. The bitter finish pairs extremely well with the dry, heavy carbonation beer's swallow. Alcohol slightly burns the back of your throat on the way down, but easily a sipper. Another win from Green Flash in my books. My favorite of the style so far."
"this brew pours up a murky orange color easily resembling orange juice. Nice bubbly white head with great lacing on my Duvel glasseroo. the nose is a symphony of WHOA! American hopfest! citrus, subtle floral, pale malts, a hint o'booze, very spicy. the taste is thick and creamy. orange citrus, grapefruit, nice hop bittering, couldn't even tell that it has high alki. full bodied, crispy heavy carbo. A very bitter and tasty beer."
"D: Oh how I missed Le Freak. I didn't find the bottle tasting as good as I remember it served from the tap, but it is still damn good. A nice SoCal spin on the Belgian IPA. Chuck really nailed this one. 9.2% ABV is well balanced with the serious flavor packed into each serving."
"i can't stand to see a robot cry, let's watch T.V.... ever drank a whole bottle of NyQuil just for shits and gigs? ... wheres the wick? $125 for rockstar shit? ... and who is dumb enough to buy a fast food sandwich for $8?... Le Freak, man, glad to try this in my neck of the fat sucked wheather mans neighborhood ... lots of belgian honey hops... damn frigidy good lacing and coco white head ... parole officer says i need an upgrade, or they won't give me back my stabbin knife... wow, fantastic brew here.. bitter , sweeet, balanced like a eraser on a pencil erasing a doodle of a naked man at that porno dudes house ... so so easy to drink... smooth, enjoyable, the real mccoy ... at&t, ever been to brussels, cuz i want to kick your arse... quite an amazingly enjoyable and crisp bitter example of the hop (and the genius thinking out of the box yeast examples in this brew)and the playful sensation of bitterness on the tongue and complete coating of the trap... ballack, what a goal, but roons was tap-rific! ... i may not make sense to you the reader, who reads my crap anyway, but this is a great beer, great bitterness, smooth as silk, aggressive yet retarded kitten like... buy this if you see it, me personally will be buying quite a few more bottles of this wonderful elixer, or butt sex..."
"The aroma felt a little subdued with the typical yeasty smell accustomed to the Belgian style. The taste had a good malt backbone but then the bitterness and dry finish came into play. It was a lively beer and left the humus lupulus in the mouth long after the drink was finished. I found it to be a pretty solid effort from an American brewery."
"This is a good Belgian IPA and maybe more of a trippel, but, either way, it's tasty."
"Very easy drinking, only the thick mouthfeel gives away how big of a beer this is."
"This New age trippel pours a large l.t and frothy head that has great retention. The Nose gives off a fresh bannana bread mixed mix with a hint of cloves. The taste starts with the spicy hops and quickly fades into a sweet gum and burt caramel fade. The mouthfeel is kinda on the light side wich is a nice touch that let's the hops really shine thru the mix. At 9.2% abv. this ale really drinks well."
"Tastes more of a Tripel than an IPA, as Green Flash calls it a cross between the two. Hops are present yet swarmed by the rich malts, yet the yeast isn't that prevalent either. Still it is enticing and complex and rather drinkable for its size. Flavors improve notably with some warming. The alcohol is pretty well hidden here but the sweetness would limit the drinkability. A unique beer worth a try."
"D - Definitely one of the better beers around. can see why the cult status with many people. Highly enjoyable brew but more than one can be overwhelming on the palate."
"Mouth feel was medium bodied. Drinkability was great. It is definately a different tasting beer but one that seemed to blend the two styles very well."
"The aroma is nice but I wouldn't mind seeing more hops in the taste. Since it's a bit unique I guess I can want what I want. As it is it's a fun, enjoyable beer that I would like to have something like this every 2-3 weeks. Good effort, nice beer."
"Taken from my tasting notes on 12.27.08. Glowing orange with a pretty white fluffy head. Very striking in the snifter, exceptional. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerines and rock candy. Huge bitter orange peel hop flavor with a lingering hop finish. Spicy, dry mouthfeel. Slightly prickly on the tongue, very big tangerine hop flavor. Great lacing in the glass...very tasty."
"Pours a beautiful, clear golden-amber color with an enormous head. It almost escaped my liter-sized snifter. Decent retention and lacing, though the head reduces in size rather quickly because of the giant bubbles. The smell is purely of hops, citrus, a bit of pine and fruitiness. It makes me wonder where the belgian part comes in...until I taste it. You get the characteristic flavors of a belgian ale, almost that yeastiness, sweetness, fruitiness of a trippel. You lose the hop flavor and aroma quickly after the head has reduced and there isn't a whole lot left to smell. There is some bitterness, but really, neither the yeasty belgian goodness nor the hoppiness is able to conquer the taste of the alcohol. You get peachiness, and burning sort of, but mostly that taste that certain unbalanced beers get, and I have not learned to love the taste, and I doubt if I ever will. That really hurts you after you let the taste sits in your tongue for a second. Then you notice that there isn't a huge amount of body to this, unlike most belgians and IPAs. I found myself early on wanting to get back and taste it again, but as it went on, I found myself satisfied but still interested. I finished it kind of slowly, but I still enjoyed it enough to want more."
"Good but not as good as their Trippel."
"Drinkability: Not one of my favorites, but I can appreciate this craft brew. It is an enteresting extreme beer, but the alcohol-astringent flavor turns me away."
"UPDATE: I did not edit anything in my original post which was based on the first glass of chilled Le Freak. As the beer warmed up and as I drank more of it, its taste moved more and more towards hoppy bitterness. I was pleasant, but if you're not a hophead, you won't enjoy it."
"This is probably the first American attempt at a Belgian IPA that I've tasted that wasn't just trying to reverse-engineer Houblon Chouffe (not that that's a bad thing), and I can't wait to see more like it."
"Golden color with a white head that has excellent retention and lacing. Bubblegum, citrus hops, clove, and nutmeg in the aroma. Bubblegum, clove, citrus, nutmeg, and allspice in the taste. This beer reminded me of New Glarus' Dancing Man Wheat. Medium body and medium carbonation. I'd definitely enjoy having this again; very good beer!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky of sugar & hops, boozy, and warming."
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Pours a transparent golden orange with a big pillowy cap of foam. Looks sticky and icky. Man, the marriage of those Belgian yeast aromas and piney hops create the perfect smell of Christmas...Christmas trees..mmm. Tingles the nose. Subtle maltiness infused in these smells. Fuck yeah. Taste is SPICY! Everything hits you at once. Belgian yeast flavors everywhere similar to those of a spicy wit beer. Hops aren't as in your face as the American versions I am used to; hops just work with the yeast to create a wonderful spiciness. Warming alcoholic edge that is definitely perceivable but it works VERY nicely in this beer. A very very faint hint of a soy-like flavor in the finish. White pepper. Some sugary sweetness takes a backseat to all this spiciness (I really can't say it enough), but comes out in the finish. As far as mouthfeel goes, spicy tingle with a little too much bubbly carbonation for my taste...it goes with the theme of the beer I guess...I can't really decide how I feel about it. I won't have any problem drinking this bomber."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy mandirin orange color with a massive sticky white head. The smell is heavy on spices. It smells like a triple. The beer is crisp and leaves a fruity/ spicy taste in my mouth. I was expecting more of a hop profile, but I guess that is why it is a Belgian IPA. The beer is medium bodied and highly carbonated. It is a sipper, which is good because the high ABV is barely noticeable. A solid hybrid type of beer, worth trying but maybe not worth the hype."
"Even amongst Stone 08-08-08, Chouffe Houblon, and Urthel Hop It, I'd certainly recommend it."
"A little surprising that the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts, but when the parts are this good, it probably doesn't matter. Pours orangey-yellow with aromas of orange peel and belgian candi sugar, plus a little pear and peach. Big flavors of trippel and sugar up front, quickly washed aside by a delicious wave of bitter citrusy hops. Finishes bitter hoppy with a trail of sweet. Worth buying, but ultimately will it be more than a great tasting novelty? I'm not sure."
"It's like a belgian trippel with a good amount more hop bitterness."
"D: The spices do hurt the drinkability but I'm glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability is great. I would definately have this again and could have easily finished the bomber on my own. A bit pricy but definately worth it, if only as a one-time (or once in a while) treat."
"D- It kind of grew on me as I finished up my bomber but I still think this isn't something that I'd go out and look for."
"Overall this beer certainly lived up to my expectations. I was a huge fan of West Coast IPA, and this certainly has the same aroma up front. As it warms more trippel characeristics become apparent and they don't fight, instead they join hands and collectively make their way to my tastebuds. Definitely give this one a shot if you see it around."
"D - Good question. Unbelievably delicious but at 9.2 and fairly hoppy at the end not sure how many 22oz' one could take. then again...it's freakin' good."
"For me, this beer is the model of the IPA-Belgian crossover. Pours clear copper with a puffy white head. Rich, spicy aroma characteristic of a Belgian trippel: yeast, pepper, banana, but with a citrus zest. Clean, crisp, yet sweet taste. Good amount of grapefruit and resin, but tempered with the sweetness of the spice and yeast. Spicy and bitter, citrus and sweet; it all formed a great beer with the best qualities of both the DIPA and trippel coming through."
"Drinkability: Not bad. I like the style and i like this beer so I could have a few pints of this beer on its own or with food."
"D: It does hide the alcohol very well and it is very tasty I don't know how many of these or how often I could put one of these down, though it would be a great beer to share amongst friends."
"Nice. I've enjoyed the Belgian Style IPAs that I've had before but Green Flash takes things to the next hoppy level with this concoction. This is very West Coast but the Belgian qualities definitely get their day in the sun as well, making for a well balanced and easy drinking sipper."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy white head, with lots of nice thick creamy sticky lacing and some small islands. The nose is malty, with some yeast, corinader, pepper. The taste is very nice, malty/yeasty, with a very nice spice note. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, glad to have had a chance to try it out, thanks Joe."
"Note - This is a beer that needs to be brought closer to room temperature to fully enjoy the nuances and subtleties of this outstanding brew... Average at best when served too cold, world class when served appropriately..."
"overall: this is one hell of a beer, really super complex with great characteristics from both of the styles it says that it represents. THe more green flash I have the more i really like this brewery. Must try for a unique experience."
"I was very happy to learn Green Flash has decided to brew this one again. 'Le Freak' was definitely no miscreation; it happened to be one of the most ingenious, praiseworthy and admirable brewing aspirations I've had the pleasure of drinking. Mission accomplished Green Flash... now do it again!"
"I had a burger with blue cheese and mixed greens, and it went quite well. I drank the whole 22 oz bottle by myself, and it's a bit strong, but I'd have considered another one under different circumstances. It was reasonably priced; and I'd suggest giving it a try."
"Sample on 11/23/2008. This IPA/Belgian Strong Ale pours a orange gold color from a 22oz bottle. Medium to large sized white foamy head, with good retention and nice long lasting lacing. The aroma is fruity and sweet, with bubble gum and candi sugar, but with a large dose of grapefruity and piney hops. A medium bodied IPA. The malts are fruity and sweet, with some bread and cookie. The hops are grapefruity and piney. Nice meld of a Belgian Ale and an IPA, it has that sweetness, fruity, yeast and pepper flavors of a Belgian Strong Ale and the big malts and aggressive hops of a California IPA. It really works well. Nice carbonation. Hides the 9.2 alcohol fairly well, there is a touch of bite in the middle. Nice beer, curious to see how this one will taste with some age. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and very dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I'm not sure I'll finish the bottle but I'll be giving it a good try. Hopheads rejoice, all others beware."
"If youre a hop head, this beer is a MUST. Even though I like some IPAs, Im no hop head. I will always think of Belgian IPAs as less hoppy (La Chouffe Houblon)"
"Notes: I'd definitely buy this again if it were a little bit cheaper (I think it was around $8 or $9 for the bomber)."
"You've got to be a serious hop head to thorougly enjoy this. For the rest of us, it's a one and done beer that you may want to sample on occassion but not actively seek out."
"this is a great brew if you are digging the recent trend of hoppy belgians. one of my favorites of the year."
"Unlike many of similar style, this beer is content being both distantly Belgian and American in style. It never blurs so much that it loses its intriguingly dual personality. Whatever the ABV, now known to be hefty indeed, it mixes well but it lays on a buzz quite capably. For me, this is one more reason to go on being a Green Flash fan."
"Overall, I almost considered a drain pour at points. As the beer warmed up, the complexity of the taste was more acceptable. Still, I was on edge the whole time just trying to put this one down."
"Drinkability - no, I can't do this one again. Much thanks to the good folks at Hyde Park W&S for stocking this, but it is not for me."
"Had this on tap at the Roadhouse BBQ in Brookline. Came served in a small 12 oz stemmed glass. Hazy orange color. Thin white head. The smell tingles the nose; there are some hops in there for sure. Taste was very different. Had a very unusual initial flavor of a sweet Tripel with that upfront alcohol flavor, then before you could swallow, there was a tons of hops in your mouth. For an IPA, very different. For a Belgian IPA, very tasty. Alcohol was very pronounced, hence the small pour. This, plus the stringent hops profile, makes this beer a sipper, and not something to drink all night, in my opinion. Well worth a try though."
"Drinkability: really enjoyed this beer, great blend of two styles, green flash continues to impress me. Lived up to the hype in my opinion"
"Poured a hazy light amber with thin white head. Some good retention and a bit of lacing. Smells of citrus and pine, yeast, fruits, candy, caramel, and clove. Tastes of fruits like pear and apple up front followed by banana, clove, and honey. Belgian candy and yeasty funk follow, then a medley of citrus and pine hops for a West Coast style finish. Medium full in body, smooth. Fruity with a nice spicy bitter finish. Another impressive brew from Green Flash, combines both Belgian and West Coast IPA styles nicely."
"4.5/4.5/5/4/4"
"I would drink this beer again but I like it best in small amounts with other beers."
"Good beer. Worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel was zesty and full-bodied. Mouthfilling creaminess."
"An interesting merge of two different flavors in the mouthfeel. I'm getting somewhat of a spiciness from the belgian yeast, but then back again with the hops. The candy sugar is quite evident. I'm not a huge fan of triples but the 'blending' between that style and an american IPA is appealing to me. However I am slightly unsure how to feel about this one. It's definitely worth revisiting. The style in general is a good one to try (albeit tough to find sometimes) ."
"D: The ale is too strong to have more than one bomber. I want to love the beer, I really do. I just struggle with fact that it comes across as too big. Damn, damn, damn."
"D: Put the bomber down by myself without a problem. Wish I had taken this one home from Denver to share with the local tasting group."
"Overall: one timer for me"
"Overall I will most definetly order this again if I see it on someones beer list."
"The color is a light orange, with a fluffy white head, leaving a bunch of lacing all the way down. Smells of hops, but not much belgian content to the aroma. The initial taste is mostly of hops, but after a few swallows, the belgian character starts to make itself known. So you get the hoppy attack of grapefruit and orange, along with the more subtle peach and apricot hints. It's an intriguing combination, though overall I'd say the hoppy aspect overbalances the belgian component. Still a helluva brew."
"Drinks pretty good for the style & abv, this Belgian PA certainly has a west coast slant, as you'd expect from Green Flash"
"GABF Weekend '08: I'm a'luv'n the hoppy Belgians. This one comes out with a witbier appearance- canary yellow and a firm head formation that laced well and retained to the bottom of the glass. Piercing aromas of lemons, acidic berry-like tartness, and sharp citrus-piney hops that stand out over the softer pilsner malts. Flavors are acidic of lemons, berries, white pepper, and a plethera of other fruity esters and peppery phenols. Hops (Amerillo's?) give a citric orange / grapefruit flavor swirled around strong notes of pine and lemmon grass. The hop flavor is intense, religating the malts to a backup role only. The intense hops and spices give a lot of complexity and variety. A light vineous, barrel-aged tannin quality prounounces in the finish. And so does a mild lactic astringency and a light soapy phenolic character. Otherwise a near-flawless beer."
"A: Crystal clear coppery orange, cottony head, signs of layering on the glass - 4.50, S: Perhaps it is a little too cold but the aromas a more subtle than I expected, the Belgian side is what is most noticeable - orange peel, some spices - likely coriander, citrusy/lemony off the hops I assume - 3.75, T: All of a sudden this beer becomes a hop bomb, loads of piney bite, some syrupy sweetness to try and moderate the hops though in reality the hops just dominate, only the slightest sign of the Belgian makes it through all the hop juice - 3.50, M: 4.00, D: Always a fan of the IPAs, this one is a good representation of the style though the balance is a little too far skewed in the direction of the hops - 3.50"
"Drinkability: Alcohol is completely muted in this 9.2% freak - however, the hop bitterness really keeps you from drinking too much of this. I'll be honest, in that I was quite disappointed. Certainly complex, and interesting, but the rave scores led me to believe that I was going to be in complete lust here due to my love of Belgians and serious hops. This is my first Green Flash tasting - so perhaps I just am not used to their hops."
"Big puffy whitish head on a light brown to orange body. Sticky lacing. Smells of white grapes, candi sugar, fusel alcohol (though not too much). Flavor is a fruity bitterness that transforms into a nice sweet malt and candi sugar with hot alcohol. Bitterness and a warming sensation meld in the finish and make a nice final impression. Approaching full-bodied with a hint of syrup-quality. Drinks well, and tastes good, though im not sure it's as memorable as i expected it would be."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat creamy and smooth. Goes down with ease for being nearly 10%. Overall, a tasty Belgian IPA for sure. I've only had a few so far but I have enjoyed them. Thanks to PatronWizard for sending this my way."
"Beer poured into my Duvel tulip a clear orange with an outstanding white head initially. Nose is a lovely Belgian yeast strain, light spices, and floral hops. Taste is peppery, with hints of candied sugar, finishing with a heavy dose of west coast hops that leave a resiny hop oil. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and mildly carbonated, very smooth as it glides across the palate. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very intriguing style of beer that is a lot of fun to try. Recommended."
"D: A Belgian pale with a KO for hoppiness, well crafted, well balanced, dry, and is sure to please."
"Drinkability- Something I wouldn't mind drinking again in the future if it were offered to me. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination."
"Both the smell and taste are dominated by the hop flavors, which are everything you expect from Green Flash. I found the Belgian yeast spiciness to be relatively subtle. An excellent beer for us hopheads."
"Get it. Get 2 or 3. In every sip I kep tasting something different; try i cold, but let it warm up a bit and the spicy hops give way to floral hops, and a whole basket of fruits starts to develop."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It's everything a traditional west coast DIPA has, citrusy hops, pale malts, but with a touch of Belgian style yeast esters. The taste is great as well. I'm a big fan of the DIPA's with belgian yeast strains. It tastes like a top notch DIPA, but the yeast mellows the finish and adds a great deal of complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent beer. It's big on flavor and aroma; highly recommended!"
"Overall a great mix of the Triple and IPA that is no doubt influenced by the West Coast hop style. Very good beer that is very, very different. I enjoyed this one much more than the Hugh Malone from Allagash (but I'm a serious hophead) and is one to seek out. Green Flash just amazes me with what they are doing with their hops. Well done."
"Overall, I didn't really care for the taste profile of the hops or the balance of gummy sweetness and hops."
"Very tasty, if odd at first. Finish is quite bitter and dry, which impacts overall drinkability a tad. But its a nice belgian to savor."
"D - Now this is the kind of Belgian ale I can enjoy over and over again. Ultimately, this is quite a complex brew that combines the best characteristics of both the tripel and the West Coast IPA. The citrus notes work especially well with the sweetness and yeastiness of the tripel. While the alcohol is noticeable in this brew, it does not hinder its drinkability. Props to Green Flash for brewing this fantastic Belgian IPA!"
"D - Not really drinkable for me. The flavor is somewhat unpalatable to my taste. I would prefer something with a little less spice. Just not my style. This will be the last of the like that I will try."
"Burnt orange colour with a bit of haze. A vigorous pour resulted in a large, fluffy cap of off-white bubbles that settled to a short, dense layer of foam and left behind lots of clumpy lacing. Big hop aroma. Bracing pine hit my nose first, powdery and grassy notes soon followed, then gave way to fruit tarts and mild citrus. Floral and perfumey as it warmed. Not much in the way of malt could plow through that hoppy onslaught, but there was a bit of yeast and perhaps bready character in the background along with an indistinct spiciness. Hops were much softer in the flavour and played well against the combination of pear and apple up front and the spicy alcohol notes in the finish. Bitterness was restrained yet always present, letting the rest of the flavour come to the fore until the finish where bitterness was more dominant. Sweet tart and citrus (orange peel and lemon) flavours added depth, as did bread and yeast. Pine appeared in the lingering hoppy finish with some herbal notes. Lots of complexity here, especially as it warmed and the alcohol became more prominent. A little more than medium bodied, ample carbonation but still very creamy in texture with very fine bubbles. Dryness built up over time and warmth was there from the first sip. A very drinkable mashup of American and Belgian characters. I quite enjoyed this beer from start to finish."
"Pours a semi-cloudy bright orange with an off-white head that slowly dies down to a chunky layer of foam. Wonderful spiderweb lacing left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty strong with clove (a bit much), Bazooka Joe, candy sugar, booze, and banana bread. The hops could use a bit more strength in the nose. A weak pineapple and orange zest in terms of hops, but that's about it. Flavor begins pretty strong with an alcohol bite and a big rush of clove and spice. Big bitter hops midway with pale malts and pink grapefruit...and the booze again. Aftertaste is bready with more alcohol and a touch of pepper and zest. Medium body with a stinging mouthfeel. The strong carbonation and over the top alcohol presence make this difficult to drink. This beer has pretty much ruined my mouth, save this beer for last if you plan to drink others so you can keep your tastebuds."
"Drinkability- 9.2% bah, lies! This baby goes down smooth with little heat. The dryness does take it's toll, though. A bomber goes down no problem, but I think I'm ready to move on to something with less going on and that isn't as wearing on the tongue. Definitely keep the bomber to yourself, though. One pint would not be enough. Shit, I'm really torn on this score. Oh well, I'm getting buzzed and shouldn't second guess myself. A great beer. Worth trading for."
"D: Combination of two styles that I am a fan of, and this one melds them well as do some of the offerings from the other side of the pond. Flavors are complex, nice, but strong punch. See this one as being a tiny bit rough but still more than enjoyable. Somewhat pricey but my opinion is that its worth it."
"D: A decently drinkable beet. Typical of the style, which does not seem to really have a set plan. I was hoping for a little bit more smoothness to the mouthfeel, which would have complimented the taste better. As the taste mellowed out, it became a bit bitter as the hops and malts began to complement each other better. While I understand the high ABV was important to the character of this beer, I felt that it took jsut a little bit away from it due to the hindering of the malts. Either way, worth a try if you can get one."
"This stuff was pretty good but it seems like it was missing too many of the tripel flavors that I really enjoy. They were there in the aroma but the hop bitterness took them over in the taste. I know it's supposed to be an IPA, but I think it was a bit too much."
"Much better than the draft iteration; now I see what people are talking about. Still, a whole bomber was too much for me to finish at one sitting; it's quite alcoholic and the flavors drift off into bitterness and spice burn if this one gets too warm."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers ive had in a while, simply outstanding. Ive had this beer from the bottle, but on cask its a totally different beast, simply outstanding."
"D: I think this is pulled off really well...you get a nice bit of each individual flavor in there, and then the combination of all the effects at the end. The hops are a bit harsh, something I noticed with the Green Flash IIPA as well. Not a bad thing, but if you're not into that it could be a detraction. Pretty high alcohol, so a pint is enough for one sitting. I don't really have anything to compare it to...so it's hard to say how it compares to other Belgian IPA's...but I gotta say this is pretty good. It was great on tap too...even better than in the bottle IMO. Also, really makes me wanna try Green Flash's trippel...I bet it's really good."
"This is a solid beer although the clove character is too bold for my liking. I so like to see more of these Belgian Style IPAs hit the market though. Thanks again for the great box Dyan!"
"Overall, a very hoppy Belgian IPA. Very crisp and refreshing and hides the alcohol very well. Grab this if you get the chance."
"D - very good drinkability for a 9.2% abv brew."
"Well, I am glad that I listened to advice in the forums about this beer. It's excellent. It pours a deep orange with great soapy head with tons of fine bubbles. It smells of citrus and other sweet fruits. The taste is a superb blend of bitter and sweet. There are a ton of familiar-tasting hops, but they are presented in a different guise than your standard hoppy IPA from California (and elsewhere, I've just mostly tried ones like Stone, Russian River, Bear Republic, etc.). The mouthfeel of a Belgian is well-executed. Fine carbonation abounds and serves the taste well. I think the beer is highly drinkable, but then I think it's great. I can certainly understand other people getting sick of these heavily hopped styles. At any rate, I highly recommend it particularly to anyone who likes hoppy beers and Belgians."
"Pours a semi hazy, bright gold with a magnificent white, thick head that goes absolutely nowhere. Terrific lacing and tons of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Smell is of honey, belgian spices, clove, like a good tripel. Taste is where the hops come though...bigtime. Huge hop presence of grapefruit and aspirin-y flavors in the finish. Astringent. It's got all the characteristics of a great tripel - honey, spices ala clove, coriander, white grapes, with a very bold hoppiness that kicks you in the face and grabs you by the balls. I love it. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, very carbonated with tiny bubbles typical of Belgian Ales, astringent-dry finish. Tremendous beer and the best of the style I have had so far...better than La Chouffe, Hop-It, etc. I've only had their IPA and now this but Green Flash has got it goin' on."
"D- Fairly drinkable. The sweetness can be a little intense at times, but overall this beer is very good and a few can be had in a night. The alcohol will get to you before the taste does."
"Pours a slightly hazed honey/orange color, gloriously foamy tan head fades very slowly, and leaves behind big clumps of lacing. Seriously piney hoppy aroma, sticky and resinous pine, some grapefruit aroma. Really bitter, and I like it. Bitter grapefruit, and an almost aspirin-like bitter aftertaste, and some lemony citrus flavors. Smooth, and very finely carbonated. I could drink this all the time. Really tasty, and a style I quite enjoy."
"Well balanced beer, this one doesn't have an overpowering hop presence compared to the malt and yeast flavors. Everything is just in the right place. Quite tasty and good for washing your licker."
"Pours golden color. Very Beligan like. The smell is a mixed bag of IPA and tripel. Duh. Very interesting. I didn't know what to expect as I put the beer to my lips. After I got over the mixture of flavors I really enjoyed the taste. The hops balanced nicely with the malty sweetness. Very pleasant. I could drink this all night, which would be dangerous with the high abv. Excellent beer."
"I would rather drink this beer all night long, than listen to Lionel Richtie."
"I think this beer would be an absolute knockout if the hop bitterness was not so intense. A more moderate bitterness would serve it better. Still, a very tasty beer from Green Flash."
"Although this beer has character and attitude in spades, the Belgians always seem to have a more subtle and well-rounded approach. Of course, the west-coasters always go for BIG and in this one, Green Flash certainly succeeded."
"Green Flash did a pretty solid job in fusing an ""imperial pale ale"" and a tripel. It could be improved by toning down the spices a little and bringing more hop flavor to the forefront. But, it's a solid beer nonetheless. Definitely worth a try."
"A very interesting brew. Plenty of complexity and depth to keep things interesting. The floral hop and Belgian yeast melded on the palate in ways that I hadn't anticipated. A must try."
"The alcohol is high on this one, but it is very drinkable. This one would be great with some blue cheese or a salad. Great stuff from Green Flash as they show their brewing prowess once again."
"A wonderful marrriage of Belgian and American characteristics!"
"Pours a golden orange color with a small but dense white head that dissipated into a sparse yet chunky cap. The aroma is of candied tropical fruit, light corriander and white pepper. A tad sweet on the aroma but still nice; hops don't have much of a presence here. The taste is not as sweet as the nose, not as strong on the tropical fruit (which is good). The flavor has nice Belgian yeast phenols, nice candi sugar presence, and an American hop kick in the end. It has a bitter resiny hop which quickly balances out the Belgain characteristics. The feel is moderate and well carbonated, rather crisp, finishes on the bitter end. More of a hop driven Belgian IPA, which is what I expect from an American brewer. I prefer the more Belgian sided BIPAs but this is a very well made brew."
"the drinkability it good. this beer has some serious hop balls, but manages to retain decent complexity beyond the hops. the most hop loaded begian IPA i've had so far."
"Pours a hazy medium light amber color with a solid half inch of white head and excellent tracing. Aromas are a sweet mix of west coast citrusy hops melding with subtle spicy phenolics. So far on all the Belgian IPAs, Le Freak gets the aroma right: HOPS with Belgian yeast character. On the palate, things continue to be done right. This is truly an IIPA with tripel flavors, and not a tripel with subtle hop flavor. Mouthfeel hurts this beer a bit as it's nearly syrupy thick with moderately low carbonation, hurting the drinkability. Overall, however, I think this beer hits the nail on the head for BIPAs."
"Overall, this was a standout brew (at least for me) at the 2nd Chelsea Cask Festival in Manhattan. Really great stuff, and would highly recommend. Looking forward to trying the bottled version"
"D: this is really good. a good example of the two blended styles. well worthy of a try in my book. alcohol is a little high, but hey, who doesn't like a big high ABV bomber?"
"Le Freak pours a dirty orange color with a big creamy, frothy white head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Huge nose of fresh hops and a clean Belgian yeast quality, very impressive to combine the aromas of the two styles so perfectly. Hops play a very important role here, initially they attack fresh, with lots of pine, plant/cannabis, and citrus fruit character and some subtle spice provided by the yeast, then once the quality, semi-sweet pale malt texture with a different bready yeast note really caresses the tongue it rounds and transforms this beer into a balanced animal. One of, if not THE best in the Belgian IPA style i have ever had. Medium bodied, slight alcohol heat but very quaff-able. I highly recommend this beer to hopheads and Belgian beer fans alike."
"West coast Hop Bomb tripple? I am not sure about that-but I like this beer-what ever it is."
"Sips rather nicely, though notably impeded by the impressive, if not awesome bitterness throughout. Alcohol, while only mildly notable in character, is still a detractor in overall drinkability given its strength. It's admittedly a difficult blend of styles, and this is one of my preferred examples of the attempt, but I think I still prefer a trippel to be a trippel and an IPA an IPA."
"Drinkability: Yep, it's a bitter tripel, alright. It performed a bit better than expected, but I wouldn't push over an old lady to get a bottle unless she was really really asking for it (to be pushed, not the bottle)."
"Very unique and enjoyable overall, recommended."
"Exciting new style. Tasty & interesting brew. Seek this one out."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Hazy orange color with a fluffy white head. Good thick lacing. Tropical citrus aroma with some Belgian yeast esters. A bit of tree sap too. Bready and yeasty malt undertones, mango notes, perfumey alcohol, medium bitterness. Soft carbonation, maybe a little undercarbonated. Semi dry and mostly clean finish."
"Poured into a goblet from the 22 oz bottle. Pours an extremely murky yellow with a huge piloowy head. Smells of some light citrus hop and some begian yeast. Pretty sweet smelling. Taste is more along the lines of a tripel for me. I wanted a bit more bitterness, but it is very drinkable. Some candied sugar flavor with jsut a hint of cinammon spice. Some hop bite to finish but not tons. Very smooth and oily mouthfeel. Good beer and it hides the 9% abv well."
"Lacy Belgianesque head over a glowing golden color. The nose has sweet malts, tart fruits and peppery Belgian yeasts followed by a piney hop bouquet. As with the nose, the flavor profile is a superb balance between a rich Triple and an American IPA. It has some almost bready candy malts and topical fruit along with the spicy yeasts and a variety of hops that last through the finish. Full creamy body drinks well. A world class artisan ale."
"Pours pale/yellow in color, very clear with a small head. Smells of malt, yeast, and hops. First sip is bitter and hoppy. Nice malty backbone nicely compliments the hops. Strong yeasts also add to this beer's intense flavor. A strong bitter with above average carbonation. A fine showing"
"As for the flavor, spicy yeasts and a breaded malt note pair perfectly with a finish of gentle, floral hops. The body is medium in thickness and nicely carbonated, with a grassy hop & biscuity malt finish. All in all, a great interpretation of the style that's certain to please."
"D- This is a totally cool GF creation. It reminds of frosted mini wheat with its two sides. The smell is a blend while the taste is seperate. I try to get this anytime I am out and about."
"I'm sold on this one, and with the price as the only drawback I would certainly recommend giving it a try."
"D. This is a very well crafted beer. Its not quite as strong as some tripels/DIPA's. Certainly a must try."
"I will be picking up a few more Le Freak to enjoy in the future."
"Drinkability- If the carbonation we a tad less and the sugar level was brought down a tad, this would be a very good beer. As is, still definitely above average and pretty tasty."
"This feels like GF accomplished its goals, but it needs some Beautiful Chemistry to help the elements play nice in the sandbox. Balance is present only in over-abundance of the yeast, oak, spice and ultra-piney hops but the bitterness and spice have a little turf war going on. Within style, a little more malt and oil on the hops could be the ties that bind. The hop bitterness overpowers the yeast and malt and/or wheat electricity common with this style. Can't argue with the individual ingredients, though, but this has a fair complement of austerity - maybe a little too much. Age may help this one mellow. Still, it's prettty interesting and enjoyable stuff. I would definitely try this again."
"Highly recommended..."
"Had a light carbonation, which was surprising, but I felt actually enhanced the drinkability of this brew. Went down way too easy."
"I had Super Freak before this which is a barrel aged sour version and I was disappointed to say the least, this beer impressed me quite a bit and is part of a fairly new style, if there was a Belgian DIPA category, it would probably be in that, will be drinking again judging by the bottles I picked up while down south, recommended"
"An unusual animal for sure, but with a nice, smooth mouthfeel and a subtle alcohol warming at the end, this stuff is oddly satisfying."
"D: This is one more interesting beer. I'm almost glad I'm not having this with food. There's so much going on I wouldn't want to be distracted as I savor the nuances of this brew."
"Poured a light, hazy amber color with a huge pillowy head. Very nice Belgian aroma at the start-lots of spice, but then a good whiff of leafy American hops. Taste was an interesting hybrid of spices(coriander and anise maybe?) and citrusy hops up front, with sweet peachy malts in the finish. Alcohol was well hidden, so the drinkability was very good. I'll be picking up some more of this the first chance I get."
"D - its pretty nice. I'd try this again, but probably would think to make the nite of it. It's not over crazy impressive, but still really good and enjoyable"
"Fairly drinkable brew, an interesting drink."
"By the way the ABV is a shockingly high (for me!) 9.2%..its definitely a sipper."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Candy-like sweetness and fruity esters up front. A bit of yeasty funk is present in the background, lending some nice complexity until the abusively bitter hops begin to rape the palate. This beer has to have the worst balance of hops I've ever tasted - there's little hop flavor or aroma, while the bitterness is completely over the top. Midway through the glass my palate was numb and I couldn't actually taste anything beyond bitterness. Pretty ridiculous stuff, and not in a good way."
"D: Very nice. Still not as nice as the Houblon but a damn fine example of the style and the best one I have had made in these United States."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Duvel goblet. Big voluminous head, color was a cloudy golden, great lacing. Aroma was yeasty with come citrus. Slick mouthfeel, good body without being heavy. Flavor was that great belgian yeast along with citrus from the hops along with some stone fruit maybe a little peach. Very drinkable and something I'll definitely return to."
"Interesting, the hops don't kick in until the aftertaste. The initial flavor and aroma are of white bread, orange peel, and yellow cake. Then once this beer rolls back, it bursts with citrus and pine hops for an American IPA-strength bitterness. If you're into Belgian IPA's, this one's for you."
"Pours a hazy orange with a decent lasting head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp citrus hops blended nicely with Belgian yeast. The taste is an interesting blend of hops and yeast with sweet malts present as well. The beer certainly shows its 9.2% but it is still crisp, well carbonated and refreshing. While it's certainly no Houblon Chouffe, this is a very respectable American attempt at the style."
"I fell in love with this beer on tap, and I adore it from the bottle. This is absolutely my style, and the addition of the massive, American-style heavy hop hand is right up my alley. Sweet."
"An interesting beer from GF. Wouldn't want this all the time, but it's a solid beer."
"Pours a fully fogged in orange with a brown hue. nose is real strong with lemon and seems to smell like Pine Sol. Yeah. I said that. Flavor is smooooth. Real smooth. Meaty hops and meaty citrus. Robust and earthy. Feel is silken on liquid. This is pretty tasty. Surprisingly, it leans much farther to Belgian than IPA, which is good. Well done. Very well done indeed."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this beer. Tasty, well balanced and somewhat refreshing. Worth picking this one up."
"D- Very drinkable! If there wasn't such a large selection of revolving beers at Beechwood that I wanted to try, I definitely would have ordered a second!"
"Superbly drinkable so long as you like a dry beer, this is very dry. Herbal and dry the only thing I would avoid serving this beer with is anything sweet."
"A smooth and tasty brew with a potent 9.2% abv that probably limits its drinkability, but otherwise I could sip this one all day. An interesting blend of styles from one of my favorite breweries."
"D: Another very good beer from Green Flash, is it possible for this brewery to make a beer that is not delicious? Great example of the new style, glad I finally found it."
"Drinkability- Le Freak is as drinkable as 9% beer can be. After an hour walk with the dogs on a hot august day this is very nice. Wish I had another."
"Pours murky golden peach color. Nice thick frothy head, gives way to a firm steady sheet of lacing. Nice combination of spicy phenols, clove, sweet belgian candi sugar, and Belgian yeast aromas. Also some pine and citrus hop aromas layering underneath. A definate west coast spin and I like it. Taste is much the same, nice clove, candy sugar, and spicy phenol and yeast flavors to start. The finish however gives way to a nice citric, piney, grassy hop bitterness. The warmer this got, the more the hop bitterness started to come to the forefront. Body and carbonation are spot on. Phenols are there, but in a more spicy character and not detracting at all. Hey, you got your triple in my Ipa, no you got your Ipa in my triple! A San Diego style Triple, you betcha. A really nice balencing act, that hit me in my wheel house. Seek this out."
"This is a nicly balanced beer and a catagory that is sure to keep growing. Get your notes in on this one first, then enjoy it with a Ashton VSG cigar, holy ----!"
"I will say the high ABV came out in the taste a bit which had me switch beers after just one."
"Traded to me in a brewer bottled 22 oz. bomber by Eyedrinkale as part of the BIF 2008 Race package, Le Freak was poured into a Duvel tulip. The beer looked very clear, golden in color, and had a two finger thick head of foam. The initial smell provided an enticing whiff of hops similar to an IPA, but deeper breaths revealed floral, yeasty, and spicy scents more typical of the Belgian styles. The taste was also a near 50/50 mix of the two influences, with the hops up front, and tropical fruits and yeasty funk shortly thereafter. Candi sugar like sweetness was also apparent and the subsequent peppery phenols were finished off by a bitter aftertaste. I love that this marriage of two styles has managed to present the essence of both in a melded yet distinct manner. Seems like such an ordinary concept on paper, but others that have tried it don't seem have pulled it off quite as well as Le Freak."
"D-ok, I'm just going to say it; this is my favorite Belgium-Calfornia IPA combination. It wasn't the first, but while others have been more of a tripel-IPA, this strikes me as a saison-IPA, and the spiciness of the yeast and hops integrate better than others I've tried (and I've had a few)."
"On tap at the Gate in Brooklyn ,NY as part of their recent California bee event. Always nice to try a new offering from a Green Flash. This pours hazy, apricot amber, under a rich looking off white head, that lasts and dissolves to tiny bubble film and shimmering lace on the glass. nose explodes with , ripe fuits, tropical and citrus, yeast, bread, and a mellow undertone of funk, wow, nice. Heady, bold and tasty brew. A lot going on here. Yeast, more tropical fruity ester, spiced up hops. Yummy, aggressive brew. Love the style and this one delivers the goods. Only wish this one was available in the local area on a regular basis. Oh well, gotta get back out to San Diego!"
"Taster's Note: From my understanding, this is basically their West Coast IPA brewed with the same yeast that they use to brew their Trippel. Many thanks to oodeftone for the growler!"
"drinkability....bottle this stuff now please!!!! I love it I could drink it all day...but with the alcohol content at 9% it might get me kinda drunk though"
"Personal Score- 88"
"On tap at Green Flash, they said they were the first or only brwery to create a belgian IPA, sounds dubious but ok. Hazy, cloudy, murky yellow orange. Smells spicy, some herbal hops. Taste is more perfume than floral. Mouthfeel was chewy and probably the best feature of this beer."
" This beer has a fairly heavy body, a bit too much for my tastes. Also, the unfermented sugars were present in the beer. Aside from this and the crummy appearance of the beer, it is very drinkable. If the brewery wasn't getting ready to close for the day I would have stayed and drank more of this stuff. Definately an interesting beer to try even if you aren't in to these styles."
"The beer is fairly dry tasting, yet it has a heft and body to it that belies this. I think the earthy, chewy spice notes help to dry out what would otherwise be a beer with some sweetness. Grassy hop notes are noticeable up front and the beer picks up some pale-grain sweetness after the first couple of sips; still it is fairly dry over all. A biting, herbal hop note is found in the finish; an austere bitterness as well as some hop flavor contributes to this. The beer is very hoppy, yet still the Belgian yeas character comes through in a supporting role."
"Plenty of body with the ""cask"" smoothness, make this rather high octane brew ( 9.0% ABV if I'm not mistaken) go down effortlessly and most enjoyably. This is a kick-ass, larger than life, authentic in style offering from the Green Flash, that I look forward to having again...on tap or cask conditioned!"
"D: Nice beer. Would like to try it non cask to see what its really like."
