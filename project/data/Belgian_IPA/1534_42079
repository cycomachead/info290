As I type this, the current BA score is 91 (outstanding) and I'm finding little to disagree with - definitely worth seeking out.","interzen","Dec 01, 2014"

4.16,3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/21/2013. Pours slightly cloudy golden orange color with a 3 finger dense and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, black, pepper, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, honey, biscuit, black pepper, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, honey, biscuit, clove, black pepper, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great sweetness/spice/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian IPA style. All around great complexity and balance of yeast, hops, and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

I love the expansive decadent richness, but the lightness and sessionability too. this is everything one could hope for in a Belgian ipa and more, complex, drinkable, refreshing, special. well hopped and gorgeous in feel. a must.","StonedTrippin","Sep 13, 2013"

Well, things didn't start out too well, what with about 90% of my tulip glass being filled up with foam. Once I worked it out, it looks pretty nice, with the more acceptable head on top of a light, VERY hazy body. I dig the smell. Kind of hard to describe, but it has a tangy, yeasty hops smell. Pretty strong aroma. I like the taste. Hops, but with that crisp, light taste that I associate with European brews. The mouthfeel is ok. Seems very carbonoted, whether it is or not. Looking forward to trying the other styles.","DrStiffington","Sep 01, 2011"

3.83,-5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A thing I like about Belgian beer is that in Belgium, "hoppy" doesn't mean the same thing that it often does in America. It means a beer that may be sharp but it's also soft, especially when balanced nicely with a good wad of malt. It doesn't mean you'll be assaulted by a crate of sophomoric brewers with a fixation on arid bottles of grapefruit-juicy beer. Carolus is a good example of Belgium in a bottle: not too squishy, not very sharp but pointy enough to give a decent, refreshing sting. A good, nicely priced bottle of beer.","gfreed","Apr 21, 2011"

Lots of little white floaties settled on the bottom of the glass. Love the look. An intense floral aroma gives way to baking bread and pepper. Strong lemon & leaf hop flavour and bitterness, malt gives it some mild sweetness (balance!), while the yeast brings a nice peppery flavour, a little bit of peachy fruit, and a hint of clove to the table.

Let's just call a spade a spade, this isn't something to reach for in the heat of a hop withdrawal - it's something better slowly savored with a fine meal.

The carbonation is steady and medium. Teh aroma is of grassy, earthy hops; the European varities are what you smell and taste. The flavor to me is a little too much on the grassy side. The hops dominate the flavor throughout, a little bit of bandaide taste comes to mind. The spicy hops have no malt to give a counter balance.

Nose holds some banana, pear, light spiciness and spicy and floral hops. Sweet and dry it seems. Taste starts off dominated by the pale malt, dry and the carbonation falling on the tongue and palate is evident immediately. After a second, the pear and light fruits come through mid-palate. Finish is quite dry, with a small kick of the spicy and floral hops (Hopsinjoor uses Golding, Spalt, Hallertau and Saaz).

For one thing, the 8 ABV really shows through, but it works for this beer and is actually a good thing. This beer is quite hoppy with plenty of herbal, grassy, lemony and spicy hops dominating the flavor. There is a definite sweet malt presence as well, but it seems like the hops and the Belgian yeast are the stars. I also get a bit of banana and green apple, maybe a bit of bubble gum. This beer sort of reminds me of a cross between an English IPA, a saison and a wit. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, and is very smooth with a nice slightly tart finish.

The beer tastes a bit sweet at first. There is a gentle hop bitterness and a slight peppery bite in the finish. The menu description claims there is a citrus flavor as well, and I think I can taste it, but it may be entirely through the power of suggestion [as I type this up the day after taking the notes, I can still clearly recall the pepper aspects; that doesn't usually happen to me]. It has a light body with a bit of mouthcoating. There's plenty of carbonation and a bit of a peppery burn, but nothing like the feeling of a chili beer. I find this beer to be fairly drinkable. To me, it should be enjoyed at a moderate pace; not too fast, but it doesn't need to be sipped over an hour either.

Personally I think it can only be a good thing, as on my recent (Jan '09) visit to Belgium I found that far too many beers were under hopped and oversweet. While this Belgian IPA isn't quite up to the standard of the Trappist ales, it is still a very good beer and should appeal to the American hop heads.","LittleCreature","Jul 02, 2009"

On the other hand, pretty much all of the top Belgian IPA's look great, so it's hard to give full marks. The aroma is of juicy tangerines and interesting dry and earthy Belgian yeast. The flavor is like a light and hoppy tripel. There's a great sweet malt backbone, some phenolic character, sour apples, hops like a bite of a very ripe apricot and a refined, complex Belgian yeast. The feel is creamy and light for the alcohol content. It's quite drinkable. The malt sweetness is balanced by an excellent hop bite.","popery","Jun 28, 2009"

Compared with my recent encounters with three other "Belgian IPAs", this one keeps the original Gouden Carolus beer base loyally, as hops are not incorporated in a rather unconventional, American way; rather, hops are felt most explicitly in the level of higher-than-normal bitterness, but overall the impact is deeply intertwined with a very clean palate that the yeasty Belgian ales are renowned for. All in all, this is a very enticing hoppy ale, even thirst-quenching, thanks to the overall balance.","wl0307","Jun 17, 2009"

A tight nose bellows from the meringue, another BA sampling with us notes that this batch may be in 'shock' from recent shipment to the US, a very good point, mainly a mild Belgian yeast and fresh piney/peppery hop aroma that subtly intensifies as the beer warms. Sharp, well carbonated and assertive in character, bitter on the back end, some minty wintergreen, some crackery malt sweetness, subtle peppery spice and little alcohol presence. I havent tried the Duvel Tripel Hop yet but i imagine it to be something like this, although i expected this one to be way more hoppy than it is.

Even then the hops aren't that big, though flowery hops dominate the taste. There's a light bready flavor in the background and behind the more citrusy hops in the aroma.

Not too much alcohol feel though this is beginning to shift to the realm of heavy beers at 8%ABV.

It has an interesting flavor that boasts of pale malts and Belgian yeast. These too elements created about 80% of the taste, with the hops finishing it off. It goes down bone dry with considerable bitterness up front and in the finish. It does have much in the way of "hop" taste, but the bitterness is undeniable. The yeast character is incredible. It seems to work well with hops to create a unique experience. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. I like this beer, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

The flavor included soft, grassy hops, mellow citrus, a hint of honey, slightly sweet pale malts, and more herbal, earthy hops. Huge hop presence, but not overly bitter. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and lush. Ample carbonation, yet very soft on the tongue. Mostly dry at the finish. Dangerously drinkable! One of the best hoppy Belgians I have tried. The herbal Euro hop profile is a welcome change of pace. Quite tasty!","mdm46410","Dec 08, 2008"

Hard to contain this one with the crazy Belgian head, which forms a giant pearlescent pillow atop this tasty brew. Huge peppery spiciness on the tongue, presumably a product of the masterful mingling of four different hop varieties, along with tropical fruit flavors. Just awesome.

Nose of cotton candy malts, yeast, tropical fruit, pepper, and big spicy sea-air funk hops. Nice. Starts out with a tantalizing mix of sweetish malts and spicy hop bitterness. Soft candy and tropical fruit sweetness swells mid-palate, before big spicy, peppery, herbal, minty, funky, medicinal hop bitterness takes over. Yum. Bitterness and hop flavors carry into the finish with lingering fruit malt and powdered sugar sweetness. Full-bodied with a very active, rollickingly carbonated feel. Maybe a little too bubbly! Otherwise, very well done.","alexgash","Nov 07, 2008"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy golden pale orange color with a huge soapy pure white head that left some chunk lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of Belgian pale malt, spicy Belgian yeast, candi sugar and a stale metallic hop towards the end. Not very strong in the hop department. The taste is your typical BSPA, sweet candi sugar, flowery, honey, some champagne grapes. Then there is a stale grassy hop that hits towards the end. Nothing special but enough to balance out the sweetness. Well carbonated may be an understatement, very champagne like. It could use some softer carbonation to help the flavors stand out. There is a nice balance to this beer. Starts off sweet but is neutralized by the bitter end. A very good BIPA but not my favorite. It hits spot on the BSPA flavors but could use a bit more of a fresher or stronger hop presence.","Gmann","Sep 23, 2008"

Frothy, fully developed, huge head that forms great shapes, laces and lasts very well. Nose is alarmingly vibrant and full of hop (spice, peach, lemon) and nice yeast derived smells (farmhouse, leather.) Flavor is devastatingly complex and utterly amazing. Was expecting something good after reading Ernest's and Jeff's reviews, but this is beyond good. Starts off dry, peppery, spicy and all hop accented, then settles into an amazingly well extracted vinous-like range of flavors, which leads into the finish that lasts for at least 10 seconds.

Aroma is distinctively Belgian with plenty of fruity esters combined with a floral and citrus hop background. Throughout all these Belgian IPAs I try, I have a hard time really distinguishing hop aromas from yeast notes; however they are very complimentary and pleasant. On the palate, things continue to open up as massive carbonation delivers waves of flavor starting with bright citrusy fruits followed by a really definitive hop flavor and an assertive bitterness (something really missing from all other BIPAs). There's certainly a nice malt breadiness to this beer as well really rounding it out well. It's extremely balanced, flavorful and well done, better than any other BIPA out there. Certainly one to seek out.","dreadnatty08","Aug 05, 2008"
