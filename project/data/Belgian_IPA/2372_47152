It's consistently the same, Belgiany sort of spritzer-like zing with a nice hoppy (genuine IPA-style) batch of hops. It's delish! The feel is a little flighty, as the bubblies flatten to a finish rather than tickle the cheeks (it IS a beer). Haven't I seen this in Cabernet barrels?

3.59,-5.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a translucent copper with about a half inch of bubbly, white head. It fades quickly, and leaves little to no lacing. This one smells of some earthy, piney hops, lemon, apple, and some tart pear, and some floral, faintly yeasty notes. A really interesting nose here. Taste begins with some of the fruits and citrus, moves to some bitter, resiny hops, but finishes with an almost sour funk. Really odd; not unpleasant, just unexpected. Mouth is smooth and refreshing, but feels a bit thin and undercarbonated. Overall, a decent brew, but not one I'd seek out again. The blending of these styles just doesn't do it for me in this one.","eclipse54","Aug 24, 2011"
3.55,-6.8,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Pours a light copper color with a stingy white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of candied dark fruit, slightly earthy with a hint of Belgian yeast esters. IPA? Hops? What? Very little in the way of hops find their way into my nostrils. Tastes is sweet with dark fruits and candy sugar. There I found some hops and a bit of ethanol. Earthy and resinous hops come through but are quickly drowned out by a bit of alcohol burn. Fairly dry finish with lingering lighter fluid and sugary fruit. Medium body and carbonation level, sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Decent brew, wasn't at all what I was expecting. The heat is a bit harsh and the hops a bit muted, but tasty nonetheless.","johnnnniee","Aug 23, 2011"

Poured with a thick, frosty, belgian head that slowly reduced to a healthy white cap that left a few sticky lacings on the glass. Belgian yeast and citrus hops are the dominant aromas, with hints of spice, banana and biscuit malt. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly resinous feel. Belgian yeast, citrus orange and pink grapfruit flavors in the beginning, with a spicy, tangy taste and feel jumping into the middle. Banana and biscuit malt flavors show up from the middle through to the end. Hop flavors go from bitter and tangy to sweet at the finish. Alcoholic heat is very apparent from the middle to the finish. Lots of interesting flavors.This style is growing on me.","IronLover","Jul 24, 2011"

3.5,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3,3,"12 ounce bottles newly released I'm guessing due to the new Terrapin green caps with the turtle bursting through. This label shows a horse back riding, leute playing terrapin. Aroma has strong tropical accents with citrus hops shining bright, a bit of alcohol present and spicy Belgian yeast notes. Flavor is a clash between American hops alcohol and Beligan yeast a bit of a cluster you know what I'm trying to say. Mouthfeel can be cloying because of the same tug of war I'm talking about, hot alcohol in the finish a bit of resinous hops and spices that coat the palate. Even carbonation medium bodied but I wouldn't call the experience smooth, overall I'm surprised they chose to mass produce this beer I'm still waiting for another Imperial Pils...btw their new limited release 22 oz bottles is a pun on Indian Jones.","WVbeergeek","Jun 07, 2011"

Feel is very crisp, spicy, and has a medium carbonation level. Not much oiliness, and light bodied.

The flavor follows in with the taste. The alcohol is not over powering, but it certainly is noticeable. The body is on the thinner side as compared to our American style. The hops give off more of a drying effect than anythig else.

Smell is very juicy sweet pineapple with the expected belgian yeast twang of clove and banana. Also slightly peppery. Nice sharp bitterness upfront. Muddled with a twist of pineapple but any other flavor is kind of muted. Has a peppery aftertaste. Carbonation works nicely and not overdone.

Tastes like a mediocre tripel, with an interesting, and distinct hops finish. The hops firm up and define the broadly, beglian base, giving it a crisp finish. The finish is helped by a bubbly carbonation that helps to make this otherwise heavy beer lighter and more drinkable. Not bad at all.

Aroma is a blast of bright citrus hops, more on the tropical spectrum with some pine involved. Pineapple/peach predominantly and potentially some green apple, with a bit of Belgian yeast faintly and alcohol as it warms. Bitter and citrusy upfront, different fruit comes out here, of a more lemon/orange scope but fades into a wash of alcohol and the Belgian yeast again. As another reviewer wrote, it comes across like a hybrid DIPA and tripel which I think comes close to this. A bit fuller in the mouthfeel, with medium-high carbonation.

The taste follows closely, heavier on the honey, but with plenty of hoppy pine and grapefruit to go around. Some banana, clove, and flowers are swirled around in the maelstrom as well.

The fruity flavors are followed by some hop bitterness and then finish with more bitter hops and a little astringency actually. For the style, for me, could be a bit maltier to balance the hops and strong yeast flavor and aroma. But the carbonation is good and has a medium to medium full mouth feel.

An estery essence works itself into the aromas, adding complexity, and putting a pleasant finish to the aromatic experience. Tastes of citrusy hops which are immediately subdued by a mixture of sweet malts and phenols. A good alcohol heat hits the back of the throat and a another bite of bitterness is also felt. Goes down fairly smooth, although the lingering alcohol heat might detract somewhat, but doesn't bother initially, although eventually, after finishing the first glass, makes you understand who's the boss.

I love watching the bubbles rise up through this one, and the head is sort of thin, about a cm, but its clingy and very pretty. A good looking beer. The smell is pleasant, but it doesn't make the style evident. There's a faint bready maltiness, with whiffs of powdery pale malts and a bit of sweetness. There's just a hint, barely a hint of earthy, spicy hops, like tobacco. Doesn't smell much like a Tripel or an IPA. The taste is very nice. I love the malty flavors, there are raisins, and sticky, very sticky bready flavors. Then the hoppy spicy flavor kicks in. I like it, there's even a hint of fruitiness in the back. But let me explain it a bit more, off the bat there's an orange flavor, like a fresh sweet Valencia orange, maybe a Clementine, this an earthy, leafy, almost like compost flavor, something like tobacco, finishes with a very spicy, like coriander, clove, citrus peel, even a bit of flower resins. The bubblegum flavor is quite nice in there too. This one is very complex, and I'm quite interested, this doesn't seem much like a combination of a Tripel and a DIPA, but like layers of both mixed in together. I really love the flavors in this. It is very full and enjoyable. Just like sticky and bready from the start, with the hop resins keeping it a little dry and clingy. But the bubblegum flavor slows me down in drinking it. It's definitely a sipper, slow drinking, but not too sweet or too dry, really fascinating and recommended. Definitely worth a shot.","taylorhamrick","Apr 27, 2009"

3.83,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a light golden color. There's a bit of haziness to it. Smell is peppery and spicy, with just a touch of hops and belgian yeast. Taste is even more of the spice, very well balanced with the hops. Very smooth and easy drinking. Quite surprised on how well this drank and just how balanced and smooth it was. A little bit of citrus in the finish. A very good offering from Terrapin, glad I had the chance.","FtownThrowDown","Apr 17, 2009"

3.32,-12.9,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"A nice, relatively clear and crisp looking golden ale, a bit of bubbly head but fades. Pale malt and a dry musty hop profile, faint fumes of alcohol. A decent crisp flavor to this one, a nice dry finish, and lively on the palate, but the alcohol seems to come through a bit to much and is kind of distracting. I'm not usually too sensitive to that but it's not really working here - not really enough hop flavor in this to cover it up. Almost a wanna-be Duvel or something but more like a weak Belgian Pale than an IPA. Decent though, but I much prefer some of Terrapin's other brews.","twelvsies","Apr 13, 2009"
2.95,-22.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Mouthfeel is fuller than expected, and probably the best part of the beer. Overall not very drinkable. I'll have to try this one on tap if I see it, but for now I'm basing it off this one bottle and it is my least favorite of the series.","shivtim","Apr 12, 2009"

Smells of fruits, Belgian candy, peppery spices, banana, pale malt, and white grapes. Tastes of fruits like pineapple, tangerine, melon, lemon, apple, and banana followed by some honey, sweet pale malts, and Belgian candy with a peppery spice, hoppy resin, and alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium in body with effervescent carbonation. Sweet and fruity with a nice dry bitter finish, slick with a touch of alcohol burn.","HopDerek","Apr 08, 2009"
3.97,4.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"22oz bomber into a Duvel glass at Flying Saucer. Pours a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice fragrant blend of fresh hops, burnt caramel and mild yeast ans spice. The taste is a nice amount of Earthy hops, sweet malt and Belgian spice. The beer is somewhat heavy with slight sticky alcohol. This one is very enjoyable, one of the best American brewed Belgian IPAs I've had yet.","atsprings","Apr 08, 2009"
3.87,1.6,3.5,4,4,3,4,"D= This was a damned interesting beer. I think I prefer the Chouffe DIPA Triple to this example, but it is still a good beer in its own right. I wish the carbonation was a bit more effervescent, and that the ""Belgian"" qualities were turned up just a bit more (or the DIPA toned down a bit) but its drinkable and worthy for sure.","spointon","Apr 06, 2009"
4.14,8.7,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Bomber. Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a small white head, very little lacing. Aroma is a little estery with bananas and then a good amount of pine (slight resin) and citrus (grapefruit) hops. Flavor is abound with hops. There is a little bit of banana, some sweet malts, and finishes with citrus and resiny hop flavor. Mouthfeel has a tingle to it, pretty good body and a nice bitter finish. Overall a very good beer. Yet another solid Side Project from Terrapin, so far I would call this my favorite.","mtstatebeer","Apr 06, 2009"

3.6,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I have had only a few of beers of this style and havent been overly impressed with them,this seems to go along that line.Poured into a large tulip glass a mix og deep golden and burnt orange with a thin white head that is gone quickly leaving no lace behind as it settled very quickly.Belgian yeast aroams stand out most in the nose,slightly smokey and quite spicey with some overripe pineapple,just a hint of resiny American hop.Flavors are also more like a tripel in my mind than a dipa but its is pretty darn good.Phenolic spice flavors with some grilled pineapple flavors meld into a bit of citric hop but it never really comes thru to strong.If your a fan of say a hopped up tripel than you will be all about this,me I think its good but not anything to seek out for my taste.","oberon","Apr 04, 2009"

Not bad in my opinion.","jdubjacket","Mar 28, 2009"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Overall I was pretty impressed with my first Belgian IPA, and I'm glad I got a chance to try it. I have little faith that Terrapin will make this a regular beer in their lineup or even a seasonal, but if they did I'd definitely buy it again - and that's the highest form a praise a beer can get. It is, overall, more mild than Hopslam or other Imperial IPA's, but if you're looking for something that fits that description than make sure to try Monk's Revenge before it's gone.","johnmichael712","Mar 28, 2009"

3.94,3.4,3,4,4,4,4,"D: Well this is a drinkable brew. My only squabble is that this is far more DIPA than Belgian. There just isn't that balance I was looking for. If this beer is cold, that DIPA quality really comes out big time. Closer to room temperature, you get more Belgian qualities. I must be fair in that respect, but this is a very hop-centric brew. I just feel like they took the IPA side a bit further than the Belgian side. Still both are represented. Still I am love of all things Terrapin. If Terrapin were a band, I would be a groupie (like a hardcore groupie). I am going to take this experience as if they put on a show where I wasn't completely satisfied. Maybe the set list didn't have my favorite song, but I still had a good time. I may have contemplated whether or not I'd go back stage on this night, but I still went and made the best of it.","everetends","Mar 21, 2009"
4.09,7.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"When I saw that Terrapin's Side Project Release 5 was a Belgian DIPA, I had to pick up two bottles, and not just my usual one. The second I popped the cap, the hops hit me from an arms length while the beer was still in the bomber and I was not attempting to smell it. After poring into a Duvel Tulip, the beer looked clear, orange golden, and bubbly, but the head was tiny and remained that way. The smell from the glass was dominated by floral and citrus hops, and was true to the DIPA side of this hybrid style. The taste was mellow and hoppy and probably closer to a milder Belgian Pale Ale like Duvel than some of the other highly yeast driven beers from there. The spices showed up much more clearly after the beer warmed and the beer turned less hop centric. Decent body, but a little under carbonated for either style in my opinion. Not as bold as I was hoping, but very enjoyable anyway.","rajendra82","Mar 21, 2009"

Pours medium golden with an okay head that fades to a thin swirl. Smells sweet and citrusy to start, with a nice undertone of lemon and then some Belgian sweetness and more earthy hops. Taste is somewhat similar- anice blend of citrusy hops that pack just enough punch to make a statement, but restrained enough to not completely overwhelm the sweet malt and fruity Belgian esters. Smooth, citrusy, and slightly sweet in the mouth- refreshing. Very nice, I can see drinking this a number of times.","Georgiabeer","Mar 19, 2009"
