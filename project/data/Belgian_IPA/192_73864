3.88,2.9,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"From my tasting notes: The Belgo Belgian Style IPA poured a dark gold with a white head. I let it sit and warm to allow all of the flavors and aromas to reveal themselves. You get the signature Belgian yeast aroma of sweet cloves and bananas with a bit of hops as well. The taste was complex with the Belgian yeast hitting you first with the bitter hops on the back end. The mouthfeel was creamy smooth on this well balanced beer which made the Belgo dangerously easy to drink considering its 8% ABV.","brurevu","Nov 14, 2013"

This beer may not be a ""session"" IPA, but well worthy of seeking out if you want something in the Belgian IPA category. This is phenomenal, and would hold up easily against the likes of Houblon Chouffe and Piraat.","MusicaleMike","May 02, 2013"

Although a gorgeous beer packed with flavors, the notes don't really seem to gel and the stupidly acidic and tart crab apple finish really only motivates me to take another sip to get that flavor out of my mouth for a bit.

The hops are very present in the aroma, there a fruity aromas mixed in as well. I can pick up some grape fruit, apple, a slight grape aroma, and it’s got a fairly clean smell to it. Its light to medium bodied, the hops are quite flavorful but not over powering. It has some slightly bitter flavors mixed in with some apple and orange, overall its sweet with a semi-harsh aftertaste that has a hint of alcohol.

This IPA brought the whole party with it and is here for business. First flavour that caught my attention was the spices that touch the tip of the tongue but quickly trails behind an explosion of hops, bananas, citrus. Bitter on the tongue but complements the fruityness of this beer. Slightly dry finish with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall this beer seems to have a lot going on. Very well balanced IPA.

Belgo pours a clear, pale gold with a rocky white head and tons of small bubbles from the bottle conditioning, lacing is there, but very light. A bright bouquet of piney and spicy hops are underlined with estery yeasty notes from the Belgian strain. A thin, light to light-medium body is in tune with the low-level carbonation.

3.92,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a style I like, and this is a solid representation of the style. I enjoy the malt profile that accompanies the amount of hops bitterness. This beer does a decent job of mixing the two.","boilermakerbrew","Nov 11, 2011"

Although it shouldn’t be surprising that the best beers a brewery named “New Belgium” puts out are their Belgian ones, it certainly shocked me. Craft beer always has a way of catching you off-guard, which is one of the things I love about it. And New Belgium, you just hit me with a dose of Belgian love that I won’t soon forget – Lips of Faith, here I come!","BarryMFBurton","Nov 09, 2011"

3.73,-1.1,3.5,3,4.5,3,3.5,"O: This is probably the best Belgian IPAs I've had (I haven't had many though). It offers up a good amount of Belgian yeasty goodness and a very good malt backbone. However, I wish the hops weren't so crowded out by the yeast. Also, the skunky aromas were a little off putting, but overall a solid offering from New Belgium.","logmacschlog15","Nov 06, 2011"

4.38,16.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice amber hue with persistant lacing that firmly resisted gravity. Nice aroma...not overpowering. Slight scent of a fermenting fruit bowl - a mixture of tropical and citrus. Taste still had a faint biscuit flavor that tips off the brewer's origin - New Belgium. Nice spice...maybe some anise and coriander? Only slightly stringent bitter aftertaste. The exceptional balance of all of these qualities are what make this an excellent beer. It will be a regular offering in my home for guests.","RedBiddy","Nov 05, 2011"
4.08,8.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The aroma was full of yeast and spice with a very nice light fruit vibe coming off of it. Lots of peaches and pears were readily apparent and easily transferred the aroma into one of a nice Belgian pale. There was a large amount of hops present on the nose as well, what seemed like citrus A touch of alcohol was present hidden under all of this as well but it served more to round out then to distract. huge hoppy flavor coming off of it. nice fruity flavors worked their way in, lots of peaches and pears, apples and a touch of orange, probably coriander starting to break through. A good amount of yeast gave way to a nice dry hoppy finish that was accented by some grape like flavors in the end","mikesgroove","Nov 05, 2011"

3.88,2.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear light honey orange with a 3 inch puffy white head that settles to an island of chunky foam. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is first and foremost of a typical Belgian yeast along with some spices and malt aromas. I am not really getting any typical IPA smells from this one. It smells more like a witbier/hefeweizen hybrid than anything. Taste is of citrus fruits and citrus zest up front along with a malt backbone and a clean Belgian yeast flavor on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers on the tongue with each sip. This beer has a medium body with a smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel. A lower level of carbonation on this one. Overall, this is a good Belgian take on an IPA. The smell is deceiving however as it does not really identify that what you are about to drink has any IPA qualities to it.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 02, 2011"
3.23,-14.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This is a fine Belgian IPA, but nothing I would pick up again to quick, a little light on the hops for my taste, needs a touch more dry hopping.","bashiba","Nov 02, 2011"
3.8,0.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: If I just pretend the Belgian part of the beer didn't exist, then this would be a great IPA. Falls short of other Belgian IPA's I've tasted, but this one makes much economical sense ($7.99 a six pack).","diamondc","Nov 01, 2011"

3.91,3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a golden body with a rich white head with good retention and lacing properties. Th aromas are predominantly of citrus hops, but the Belgian yeast definitely imparts the smell of cotton candy and tropical fruits. Tastewise, the front palate is hop-forward before quickly giving way to caramelly malts and fruitier elements such as pineapple, kiwis, and something reminiscent of strawberries. The overall yeastiness feels very Belgian. I wish that the finish didn't wasn't so lemony -- it seems inconsistent with overall candied sweetness and fruity character of the beer to end on such a bitter note, but it doesn't wreck it.","droomyster","Nov 01, 2011"

3.33,-11.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Belgo has a nice, if overly sweet flavor; however, the strong yeast presence and weak feel makes it more like a poor Belgian Ale than a middle-of-the-road IPA. Either way, there are much better options.","MetalHopHead6","Oct 30, 2011"
3.95,4.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall it's not as good as their ranger IPA, but is certainly a good beer and worth trying, as well as being a good value.","AlCaponeJunior","Oct 30, 2011"

3.87,2.7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"I will say that im not a huge fan of most of the belgians; i think its something about the yeasts and others that make me not the biggest fan; i will say that i do appreciate the style. This bursts of wild yeasts and hops. A nice golden to pale straw color in the glass with a HUGE frothy head that almost burst out of the glass. This had a nice smooth feel to it and was extremely drinkable for a 7%er. I will say that having this right next to the ranger and looking at the botle; im just a bigger fan of the hop profile in the ranger; it had a lot more going for it but obviously that is the focus. Overall this is a great brew.","HOPPYKC","Oct 28, 2011"
4.08,8.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Tight mouthfeel, dry and crisp, making for some very refreshing sips. Alcohol bite in the very back that is mostly hidden, but shows its head a few times. Hops are mildly bitter, but have a nice flavor that vibes well with the Belgian yeast. That funk from the smell is in the taste mildly, but adds a nice balance to the pleasant hops. A crisp taste of malts brings it full circle and gives this beer a simple straightforwardness that makes it easy to drink. Nothing too extreme, but a very enjoyable take on a style that has a history of going either way. I would buy this again.","chodinheaven","Oct 27, 2011"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Hazy, brassy blonde with corn silk highlights and a million tiny susupended yeast particles when backlit. Nice dank hoppy aroma with a small blast of yeasty funk. Piney hops with a lemon taffy sweetness imparted by the yeast and a solid malt backbone. Well balanced flavors of American IPA & Belgian yeast which is refreshing as I have grown tired of the ""extreme"" attempts at this newer style. Finishes mostly dry with a hop oily mouthfeel in the finish. Hey, I love good affordable beer and NBB Belgo certainly fits the bill.","biggred1","Oct 27, 2011"

4.27,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours clear golden with a lively, moderately sticky head and good streamers of carbonation. The aroma is pungent and phenolic, fruity and spicy, but with a solid pale malt backbone and an aspirin-like tang. The flavor is crisp, with apple and clove and coriander, but a satisfying pale malt bottom-note and a pleasant bitter snap, like an acidic cider. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp.","Seanibus","Oct 27, 2011"
3.58,-5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This style isn't exactly in my wheelhouse, but I've had a few better executed beers of this ballpark of a genre (Houblon Chouffe, Ommegang BPA). I'd personally prefer a sweeter hop profile to pair with the belgian yeast. Solid, not amazing.","Gobigvt7","Oct 25, 2011"
4.39,16.4,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is an exceptional beer. It is a little odd at first and maybe even eccentric, but that being said, I like it.","LeeryLeprechaun","Oct 24, 2011"
4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice interplay of yeast and hops. Wonderfully flavorful and simple Belgian IPA for 7-8 dollars. Nothing overpowering just nice crisp IPA with a touch of Belgian yeast. A beer that’s more than the sum of it’s parts.","Bfarr","Oct 24, 2011"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"O - Great blend of the two styles, its perfect if you want a good IPA but not something that's going to slap you in the face with hops","ncsutton","Oct 23, 2011"
4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint a slight hazed burnt orange infused golden with a fluffy 1/2 finger white crown atop.A burst of fresh citric hop really hit home in the nose along with toasted corainder seed,the aromas are really fresh and bold.Sharp citric hops upfront on the palate followed by a light yeasty phenols,the phenols are kept in check pretty well though with the hops being the main component.A very good BIPA,American hops with just a little yeastiness,I would buy again.","oberon","Oct 23, 2011"
4.53,20.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is an IPA I will always look forward to drink when I want something a little different than the straight forward in you face hopped American IPA. This IPA just gives me some different for a change and does a great job at it!","Luigi","Oct 22, 2011"
4.02,6.6,5,3,4.5,4,4,"This was a very good hop-forward variation of a Belgian IPA. Still, balance was there and the taste was very enjoyable. Definitely one to seek out and try again, the only aspect I'd like to be a bit more developed was the aroma.","falloutsnow","Oct 19, 2011"
3.8,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D/O: While it is unclear whether or not this beer's core is the same as their Ranger IPA, New Belgium has managed to produce a worthy American-brewed contribution to the style. Its flavor profile is structured around concise yeast phenolics that face little competition from hop aromatics. It is a stylistic crossover of sorts, appearing as much like a Belgian pale ale as a Belgian IPA. It will satisfy the Belgian beer enthusiast more than the West Coast-hopped Stone Cali-Belgique, but that other beer manages to remain more true to the IPA label.","beagle75","Oct 18, 2011"

3.92,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: a nice brew, really doesnt hit with much in the way of what id call an ipa taste but is still a nice smooth and crisp brew, enjoyable and overall good","BigPlay1824","Oct 17, 2011"
4.06,7.7,5,4,4,4,4,"Aroma, Taste, and Mouthfeel: Clovey spiciness dominates the aroma, though there is enough hop to inform you that there is more to the beer. The carbonation bite is aggressive at first, but if the beer is savored before swallowing, there is a nice malty back of the mouth malty sweetness that is complemented by the clove. The sweetness is balanced by hop bitterness and citrus rind, which falls just short of clashing with the clove, or maybe it doesn't fall short. Close call. Pretty aggressive. The finish is dry, with astringency from the hops and bite from the carbonation lingering.","pweis909","Oct 13, 2011"
4.09,8.5,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"UPDATE: My overall opinion of the quality of this beer remains the same, but I did want to qualify that my tastebuds were indeed altered by the Fixed Gear I drank before I gave my review. There is a definite hops presence in this beer. Still, it was interesting to have reviewed this beer with an altered pallete. There was plenty to discover beyond what the hops had to say.","anglagard1","Oct 11, 2011"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Oddly, I wasn't too enthusiastic with the first three bottles I tossed back. For beer #4, sitting down and really thinking about…I'm very happy with this one, and will come back for more.","feloniousmonk","Oct 10, 2011"

3.67,-2.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"a fusion of two styles that you dont see all the time. pours a very alive deep golden color with a rising head. smells yeasty and hoppy, enticing! its muc more of an ipa that i thought it might be. these usually tend to be european versions, and thus not as bold with the hop additions. not belgo though, this is an ipa through and through with a nice crist belgian yeast finish. not one i'd probably drink every day, but a well executed rendition of the style.","StonedTrippin","Oct 07, 2011"
3.61,-4.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear, gold/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, earthy malt, hint of floral hops, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, slight yeast, sweet malt, slight citrus hops, and slight floral hops. Overall, good appearance, feel, and blend.","Tone","Oct 07, 2011"
4.57,21.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"New Belgium Belgo Belgian IPA: This one is a must try! Close your eyes, take a sip and you will experience a great IPA that magically transforms into a Belgian Trippel. Amazing how New Belgium has done this. Two beers in one. New Belgium is a master at marketing with their quirky ads, great beer names (hard to beat “Fat Tire” as a beer name, even though I personally do not care for that brew) and traditional labels. They missed it with Belgo. The name does nothing for me, and the label is ugly at best. But let’s not judge the beer by the packaging. The Belgo pours with a honey colored body, little carbonation, and a great pillowy head with fine lacing. It looks fantastic in the glass, and the looks are outdone by the aroma, which is prominent with a complex blend of hops and malt coming through. Lots of enjoyment even before you takes a sip. The flavors will blow you away! It starts out as a fine IPA with lots of hops coming through, then mid sip transforms to a Belgian style Trippel, malty, yeasty and wonderful! The Belgo is a great find. Take a six over to your most discerning beer snob friend and you will get the pick of the month award.","iSip","Oct 07, 2011"
