"Not a fan of that yeast strain, whatever it is."

"Maybe I'm a little biased, being from just an hour outside of Cleveland, but this is a spectacular brew."

"Overall:  This is a very, very good, great even, Belgian-style pale ale!  Lots of Belgian yeasty funkiness, toasted malt and spices.  Delicious!  Highly recommended!"
"overall a good ipa"
"Overall - I think this is a great belgium ipa!"

"A great mix of hops with mild yeasty spice flavors and subtle earthiness up front with sweetness from the malt adding a grainy base bu mostly dry and herbal in flavor with a mix of hop and yeast flavor augmented by some mild alcohol and spice in the finish which lasts a long time. Overall a very good belgian from the style standpoint with a nice degree of drinkability for the strength. I probably should have tried this the first time I saw it for sale as I like it a lot and it would have been fresher perhaps."

"An earlier reviewer said this brew seemed suspiciously reminiscent of a tripel, and I wholeheartedly agree.  As soon as I took my first swig, I got that aftershave bite that I associate with tripels.  Sorry, but I am not a big fan.  However, that said, I am not going to judge this beer simply on the fact that I don't like tripels.  The Spacewalker was served to me on tap, and it had a nice amber-gold color with a lovely but quickly dissipating white head.  The smell was of rich spices mixed with aftershave, the taste being extremely similar.  However, it was also fairly smooth, and I could quickly forgive the awful aftershave aftertaste.  I won't be having this again, but it was worth a try just to say I won't."

"(3.75) O: Overall a strong belgian yeasty attribute, funky, dry, big flavor. very good, worthy a try."
"Complex full flavored Belgian style with noticeable hop finish. I wish I could get this all year."

"Overall I really enjoy this brew... However It doesn't seem like a try 'Belgium' style to me. So,e spice and sourness. Almost drinks like a heffenwiezen I hope to see this again. Great Lakes does excellent work with their seasonals and this is no expection~"

"  Overall â€“ A rather tasty Belgian style IPA with a good crisp, but still somewhat fruity flavor.  Not the best out there, but a nice try and rather enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall for just 10 bucks a four pack I could see getting this again a very smooth high octane Belgo IPA."
""

""

"Pours an orange amber with a medium white fluffy head, some light lacing. Aroma is of ripe fruit, Belgian yeast, mild grains. Taste is fruity, yeast, with some peppery spiced hops bitterness. A medium crisp body on the palate with some lively carbonation. Finish is a combination of sweet ripe fruit, Belgian yeast, mild grain notes with some mildly spiced peppery hops bitterness and a sweet alcohol mild dry ending. A good solid flavorful brew."

""
"O: No doubt, this is a very unique beer, just not one of my faves (and I really like white IPAs)."
"Love me some Great Lakes right off the bat... poured from a 12oz into my snifter (pretty standard). Poured a translucent, cloudy golden color with a pinky of white head. Some banana, funk, and maybe a bot of nutmeg (or similar spice note) on the nose. Tasted funky, with some interesting spice and a hint of alcohol. Discouraging metallic note in there too... kind of faded as the glass warmed. Light to medium body, with a bit of the metallic aftertaste. Interesting overall, but not a great experience on this one... shouldn't kill my love for GL though!"
""
""
"The aftertaste similarly is better on the warmed up version. This may not be my favorite Belgian (far from it), and Great Lakes isn't really known for this style, but this is worth drinking, just warm it up a bit."

"I like what Great Lakes has done here. Complex with plenty going on. The white pepper gets intense but it doesn't linger and there is still a good dose of hops for the hop heads."

"T: Grassy, biscuit, and green apple work at low levels, but they seem very prominent here. Good clove like spice quality adds depth. (3.5/5)"

"O 3.5 - I liked it; it wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it is good. I'm not sure that I'd buy it again though. I've had other white IPA's I've enjoyed more than this one, and this didn't meet expectations."
"Served from the tap. The beer is a transparent gold with a one-finger head along with some lacing. The aroma includes some Belgian funk as hoped along with some spice. The taste follows but with the addition of citrusy hops. In the end, the hops prevail including a grapefruity aftertaste. This is an interesting beer, and I would get it again whenever I'm in a hoppy mood."

"3.1/5: Tastes unfinished; wait for it to be tweaked in next year's batch (maybe?)"
""

"This is a stunning looking ale with a beautiful bright orange color and stiff foam head. Pepper, clove and spice dominate the nose as the Belgian yeast components are at the front. The flavor is almost all yeast with peppercorns, cloves, and floral tones. Apple ,pear, apricot and hop bitterness are also found. This is an acquired taste, but very flavorful for the style."
""
""
""
"After the first sip I knew I was right. I was punched in the mouth with a nice bitter hop. I thought that overall it was a worthy selection."
""
"Overall, I can't understand all the negative reviews of this beer. Great Belgian notes with a high but very nice bitterness. Wish I would've picked up more than one."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely wonderful. I'm a sucker for American Belgo beers and tend to rate them way over the rDev, I've noticed. I can see why some would be turned off with this as it sort of tastes like a Hefe or Wit IPA, but I like that funkiness. It's unusual as hell, and I absolutely love it. Weird thing is, I don't usually care for standard Hefe's or Wit's, but when those flavors are put together into a beer like this, I find it truly outstanding. I often get turned off for 12oz beers that are $3 a single, but this is a beer I'd not hesitate having again."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Belgians may not be my favorite family of beer styles but that doesn't stop me from recognizing a great beer when I taste one. The assertive hop bitterness paired with the earthy/fruity belgian yeast esters create a multi-dimensional flavor that just doesn't quit. Nicely done by a brewery that's renown for its great line-up. Would I drink it again? Probably not, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a belgian IPA."

"D: This was a decent tripel, but not very American. Nice scent and taste, and great body. The finish was a bit hot, so not the easiest to drink. Nice to try once."

"O. ""Buzz, your girlfriend...woof!"" That's how I feel about this beer. Great Lakes is quite possibly my favorite brewery and I could not be more disappointed in the Cleveland boys for this effort. Extremely imbalanced and oppressively dry, yeasty, boozy, and plasticky on the flavor profile. I cannot believe this is what GLBC set out to do and I'm wondering how the hell this got past QC. This is a black eyed embarrassment for a brewery that puts out such a typically top notch product. God bless you if you bought a whole 4 pack of this. I barely got through 5 sips. Hello drain."
""
""
"Not quite a 4, but close, and highly original. A bit too much going on for may palate."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very good blend of two styles of IPA an Belgian pale ale. Distinct flavors of the two which seem to compliment and not clash with one another. I'm definitely glad I bought a 4 pack of this and I look forward to having more of these over the next few weeks. Easily drinkable with a well hidden alcohol but I find it's more of a savoring beer rather than one to be drank quickly. The hops are strong enough that they'll slow you down."

"Ale pours a hazy yellowish orange with a thin white head that lightly dissipates to a very thin white pool with excellent lacing. Nose of bittering hops, light bread, light clove, light candy malt, and light banana from the Belgian yeast. Taste is almost a cross between a farm house ale, a triple, and a bitter ipa. Hops up front, VERY light sweetness from candy sugars, and light clove hidden amongst bittering hops. Mouthfeel is on the high side of moderate carbonation with a citrusy dry aftertaste. I would personally like to try this in a bottle to compare notes. It misses the mark from the highs of triple dog dare which was true to the mark. This is a hoppy mess. I am sorry, but as a lover of Belgian style ales the over abundance of hops wrecks this brew. A shame since I am such of a fan of this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"A rare miss from great lakes, for me. The ester complexity is lacking, and the bitterness overwhelms. Reminds me of a farmhouse."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, high carbonation, and finishes nice and dry. It keeps you coming back for another sip each time. Overall, this is a decent example of the style, but nothing that will blow you away. It is another enjoyable brew from GL."
"Overall: This is basically a really hoppy Triple, which I guess is different than a Belgian IPA. Excellent beer IF I pace myself really slowly. I don't like having to think about how to drink the beer so much, so I really am stuck on how to score this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Belgian style ale. Pretty hoppy and bitter for the style but it works well for me. Good fruit flavors."
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a cloudy orange color with a small (quarter inch) head of foam, but it's fairy persistent, leaving modest lacing. Aroma hits that great balance of yeasty fruitiness and spicy (rather peppery in this case) phenols. This smells like many good abbeys and other Belgians I've had. The initial taste is a high hoppy bitterness, with earthy, grassy hop notes--after, a candy sweetness, light summer fruitiness, and lots of clovey, spicy phenols. The hoppiness lasts through to the bitter, dry finish. The body is light despite the strength, well-attenuated, and spritzy with carbonation. Highly good Belgian style!"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/8/2014. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/floral hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast spice/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, banana, pear, apple, bubblegum, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of citrus/pine hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good hoppy Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Poured into a goblet a slight hazed medium golden with a full one finger dense head that didn't last very long.Some toasted cereal grain and phenols in the nose.Toasted cereal flavors along with some lemony hops with the phenols being lighter than in the aromas,pretty refreshing.Not a bad Belgian pale here,it might not be as complex as many but it's pretty good."

"O: I love the theme and label. Overall a solid beer, decent for the style as is typical for Great Lakes, though I prefer much of the rest of their brews better A bit less bitterness on the finish would improve it"
"This is a bold beer, but not as refined as I'd expect from Great Lakes. The over the top bitterness hurts. It's solid, but nothing crazy. I would describe it as an ""Imperial Belgian Pale Ale", if there was such a style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good beer but not great. Its a little overpowered by the sharp bitterness of the Belgian yeasts. I Feel that the pale ale aspect is buried under this, and makes me wish I could have this beer minus the Belgian yeasts. Id drink again but I hope this gets a tweaking for next release."

"12 ounce bottle, best enjoyed by 10/17/14. Served in a Great Lakes Brewing chalice, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that sticked around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like Belgian yeast, candy sugar, cloves, citrusy hops, bananas, pears, and peppery spice. Taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also some lemon peel and light grassy hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth, and is well carbonated. Overall I liked this brew, it's an enjoyable brew for a hot summer day. $9.99 a 4-pack."

"O: I really enjoy this beer - the combination of the Belgian Pale Ale and the hop profile of an American IPA (this is a really successful combination in this specific case). I think the beer is pretty easy to drink considering the strength of this beer and there is a decent amount of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth grabbing."

"Overall, a decent example of a style that I'm surprised to see Great Lakes take a stab at, but definitely has a few flaws. As this is one of my very favorite brewers, I'll happily try (just about) anything they release. I found this enjoyable, but I do believe that it needs some additional sweetness."
""
"O - It starts out good with the Belgian aspects, but the hops are too bitter for my liking. The contrast from start to finish just seems too great for me. Maybe more subtle bitterness would be a better option for my palate. This beer might appeal to me more as the hops fade. I will hold onto one for a few months to see how it develops."
""
"Meh. Unusually poor offering from Great Lakes. Without the chalky bitterness, it would be OK, but still not good. As it warms up, there is slight improvement as the spiciness mellows out, but the chalky bitterness still hangs. And hangs. And hangs."
""
"The body leans interestingly light, though it just manages the threshold of medium. The crispness is softer than expected, though by no means inconsistent, making for a creamy smoothness in a lingering bitter leafy and citrus peel finish."
"Spacewalker American Belgo brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 8.2% and pours out a cloudy amber color. There is also a small white head to this brew. Spacewalker American Belgo Is an unfiltered brew. The smell is rich with some citrus and grains. Nothing bad about the smell of this brew. The taste has a bite to it. At first you get some bitterness at the end you get a hint of citrus. I'm not feeling the taste it is to bitter. This is not a well balance brew. The mouthfeel is bitter and clean. If you like bitter this would be a good one for you. Overall I giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5."

" Overall an outstanding 4 is given to Spacewalker American Belgo from Great Lakes Brewing Co. I was blown away on how the mixture of spice/zest mixed with mellower witbier attributes worked out so well!! This was a unique experience I will recommend."
""

""
""
"O- A pretty good belgian-style ale from Great Lakes. It doesn't seem to subscribe a specific belgian style, but does have a big belgian yeast presence."
""
""
""
"Great Lakes delivers again!"
"In the end, the characterful ale is creamy-dry, nearly bright like champagne. An earthy kick of grassy hops fuse beautifully with Pacific Northwest resin flavors to amplify dryness and to promote a sharply bitter finish. With is persistent perfume, a detergent-like character trails in aftertaste, reinforcing all things floral, bitter, sweet and solvent."
